CONFIDENTIA LProtocol Sy nopsis
Title:   A Phase 1b /2Study Assessing Safety and Anti -tumor Activity of AMG [ADDRESS_547727] Advanced Solid Tumors
Study Phase:   1b/2  
Indication:   Colorectal cancer ( CRC ),pancreatic cancer and non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC ),and other indications dependent on emerging data
Hypotheses:
AMG [ADDRESS_547728] advanced solid tumors
AMG 820 can enhance the anti -tumor activity observed with pembrolizumab alone and/or 
overcome lack of response to pembrolizumab monotherapy in subjects with select advanced 
solid tumors
Primary Objective:
Evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG [ADDRESS_547729] advanced solid tumors
Evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of AMG [ADDRESS_547730] advanced solid tumors
Secondary Objective (s):  
Evaluate the anti -tumor activity of AMG [ADDRESS_547731] 1.1
otime to response (TTR), duration of response (DOR), and time to progression (TTP) 
oprogression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) at 6 and 12 months
Characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AMG 820 after intravenous (IV) infusion 
administration of AMG 820 in combination with pembrolizumab
Evaluate the relationship between the immune infiltrate status in pre- study  tumor biopsies vs. 
clinical response
Primary Endpoint:   
Dose limiting toxicities (DLT), treatment- emergent adverse events, treatment -related adverse 
events and clinically significant changes in vital signs, physical examinations, and clinical
laborator y tests
ORRas per irRECIST in subjects treated at the recommended combination dose
Secondary Endpoint(s):
Objective response ( OR)as per RECIST 1.1; TTR, DOR and TTP ; OS and PFS at 6 and 
12months
PK parameters for AMG 820 including, but not limited to, maximum observed concentration 
(Cmax)andminimum observed concentration (C min).In addition, area under the 
concentration -time curve (AUC) and, if feasible, half -life (t 1/2)for AMG 820.
CD4,CD8 & CD68 cells number sin fresh pre -treatment bi opsies
Study Design:   This is a multi -center Phase 1b/[ADDRESS_547732] advanced solid tumors . Phase 1b of the study (part 1) will 
have a 6+3 design aimed at assessing the safety of the selected starting dose of AMG 820 in 
combination with pe mbrolizumab . Phase 2 of the study (part 2) willfurther evaluate safety and
test whether AM G820 can enhance the anti -tumor activity observed historically with

CONFIDENTIA Lpembrolizumab alone and/or overcome lac k of response to pembrolizumab monotherapy in 
subjects with select solid tumors .
Part 1 : Up to [ADDRESS_547733] advanced solid tumors with 1400 mg AMG 820 plus 200mgpembrolizumab 
every three weeks ( Q3W)using a 6+3 design. 
If 0 or 1 of the initial 6 evaluable subjects experience a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) then the 
dose combination will be determined to be tolerable and Part 2 initiated . The study Part 1 
DLT per iod is 21 days .
If 2 of the initial 6 evaluable subjects experience a DLT then 3 additional evaluable subjects 
will be enrolled. 
If 3 or more of the evaluable subjects experience a DLT (eg, 33% or higher with 9 evaluable 
subjects) then the dose combinatio n will be determined to be non-tolerable and a second 
Part [ADDRESS_547734] a decreased dose of AMG 820 in combination with 
200mgpembrolizumab. Further degree of dose modification and/or schedule of 
administration will be decided based on analysis of emerging safety and PK data.
Part 2 : The evaluation of safety and efficacy in this part will include [ADDRESS_547735] 5groups , which will be 
evaluated using a Simon two -stage design .Analy sis of data in Part 2 will be done separately for 
each group (Group 1, 2, 3, 4a, 4b).
Group 1 will enroll up to 43 advanced MMR -proficient CRC subjects who are naïve to 
anti-PD-1/PD -L1/CSF -1/CSF -1R therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . Eighteen ( 18)subjects will be enrolled during the 
first stage and treated with the AMG [ADDRESS_547736] then further enrollment may  be 
discontinued ;otherwise ,enrollment up to 43 subjects will occur.
Group 2 will enroll up to 29 advanced pancreatic cancer subjec ts who are naïve to 
anti-PD-1/PD -L1/CSF -1/CSF -1R therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . Ten ( 10)subjects will be e nrolled during the first 
stage and treated with the AMG 820plus pembrolizumab combination. If nosubjects have 
an objective response per irRECIST then further enrollment may  be discontinued ;otherwise ,
enrollment up to 29 subjects will occur.
Group 3 will enroll up to 55 advanced NSCLC subjects with low (<50%) tumor 
PD-L1-expression who are naïve toanti-PD-1/PD -L1/CSF -1/CSF -1R agents .  
Nineteen (19)subjects will be enrolled first during the first s tage and treated with the 
AMG [ADDRESS_547737] then further enrollment may be discontinued ;otherwise ,enrollment 
up to 55 subjects will occur.
Group 4will enroll up to [ADDRESS_547738] relapsed 
during monotherapy with anti -PD-1/PD -L1 agents , and are anti -CSF- 1/CSF -1R naïve. These 
subjects will be further distributed equally between two sub -groups (4a and 4b) depending on 
the  PD -L1 expre ssion in the tumor tissue: high ( ≥50%) and low (< 50%) expression . 
Ten(10)subjects per subgroup will be enrolled first , during the first stage. If no objective 
response per irRECIST is seen in either of the subgroups then further enrollment may be 
discontinued ;otherwise, enrollment up to 58 subjects will occur.
Sample Size:   
It is anticipated that 67to 197subjects will be enrolled overall in this study. 
Part 1 will enroll 6 to 18 evaluable subjects. The sample size in Part 1 is based on practical 
consideration, and it is consistent with conventional oncology studies with the objective to 
evaluate the safety and tolerability of a treatment combination.  W ith 6 subjects in a cohort, there 
is a 47 -91% pr obability of observing at least one DLT if the true DLT rate is 10 -33%.

andAMG 820
The c-fms receptor (also known as M -CSF receptor [M-CSFR] or CSF -1 receptor 
[CSF -1R]), belongs to the class III receptor tyrosine kinase family that includes PDGFR 
α and β, VEGFR1, R2 and R3, Flt3 and c-kit (van der Geer et al, 1994; 
Blume- Jensen etal,2001 ). Expression of c-fmsis primarily restricted to cells of the 
myelomonocytic lineage (including monocytes, tissue macrophages, microglial cells and 
osteoclasts), hematopoietic precursors and trophoblasts ( Dai et al, 2002; 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_432469],2004 ). The colony stimulating factor -1 (CSF -1, also known as macrophage 
stimulating factor [M -CSF]) seems to be the main ligand for CSF -1R

CONFIDENT IAL(VanWesenbeeck et al, 2005; Wiktor-Jedrzejczak et al,1990), while the relevance of 
IL-34, a second pos sible ligand  ( Lin et al, 2008 ), is yet to be fully elucidated. CSF-1 is 
expressed both as a membrane -bound and a soluble cytokine ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_432470], 2004). It 
influences the survival, proliferation, differentiation, chemotaxis and activation of 
macrophages and their precursors ( Bourette et al, 2000; Cecchini et al, 1994, 
Hamilton, 1997 ).
All normal tissues are populated with macrophages, which are part of the innate immune 
system, recognizing, engulfing and destroying potential pathogens 
(Sasmono etal,2004) through the release of react ive-oxygen species and 
reactive- nitrogen metabolites ( Adams and Hamilton, 1984; Nathan et al, 1991 ). In 
addition, tissue macrophages contribute to both humoral and cell- mediated immune 
responses as antigen presenting cells. Conversion from a quiescent state to an 
immunologically active or microbicidal state can be induced by [CONTACT_432498]-inflammatory cytokines including CSF -1,  IL -1, TNFα, IL -4, IL- 12, IL- 13, GM -CSF, 
IFNγ ( Bingle etal,2002; Pollard, 2004). Atthe tumor level, macrophages can represent 
a prominent component of the inflammatory infiltrate: tumor associated macrophages 
(TAMs) or tumor infiltrating macrophages (TIMs) ( Noy an d Pollard, 2014; 
Chanmee etal,2014, Pollard, 2004; Chen et al, 2005 ).
Over the past decade s, the mechanisms supporting the tumor promoting functions of 
TAMs have become increasingly clear ( Noy and Pollard, 2014; Colegio et al, 2014; 
Chanmee et al, 2014; Ribatti et al, 2007; Sica et al, 2006; Condeelis et al, 2006; 
Leek
etal, 2002 ) through their production of various pro -angiogenic factors 
(Bingle etal,2002; Mantovani et al, 1992 )such as proteases that degrade the tumor 
extracellular matrix thus aiding invasion and metastasis and mitogenic factors directly 
stimulatory to tum ors (Leek et al, 2002). In addition, CSF- [ADDRESS_547771] 
been shown to be immunosuppressive via production of factors such as prostaglandins, 
indolamine 2,3 dioxygenase, nitric oxide, IL -10, and TGF -β (Bronte et al, 2001; 
MacMicking et al, 1997 ). CSF-[ADDRESS_547772] been 
associated in different ways with prognosis in cancer depending on various factors 
including tumor type and TAM content in the primary tumor vs metastases 
(NoyandPollard, 2014; Chanmee et al, 2014; Lewis et al, 2006; Funada et al, 2003; 
Ohno et al, 2003; Caruso et al, 1999 ). However, in all preclinical tumor models tested to 
date (using both human tumor xenograft and syngeneic models) decrease of TAM 
number and/or their function/survival through tar geting CSF -1R axis ( Colegio et al, 2014;

Luo et al, 2006 ) resulted always in inhibition of tumor growth, never tumor progression. 
2.1.2 PD-1 AND PD-L1 inhibitors
Programmed cell death 1 (PD -1) is a negative co stimulatory receptor expressed 
primarily on the surface of activated T cells. Binding of the ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2, to 
the PD -[ADDRESS_547773] 
can contribute to inhibition of active T cell immune surveillance of tumors
(PhilipsandAtkins, 2015; Swaika et al, 2015 ). 
To date, the two leading PD -[ADDRESS_547774] been 
approved in advanced, previously treated melanoma and non -small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). Especially in the NSCLC setting, PD -L1 tumor expression seems to indicate 
an increase likelihood of responding to anti -PD-[ADDRESS_547775] been developed 
(http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm466413.htm ;

2.1.3 Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most common forms of cancer worldwide. CRC 
has the third highest cancer incidence and rate of death in the [LOCATION_003] for men and women, 
although the related numbers have been steadily d eclining in the past decades
(Gilletal, 2014 ).Among patients already diagnosed with CRC, approximatel y one -fifth 
present with synchronous metastasis, and half of the remaining patients will develop 
subsequent metastases. In the treatment of metastatic CRC (mCRC) several cytotoxic 
agents have demonstrated efficacy, including 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU), folinic acid, 
irinotecan, oxaliplatin and capecitabine. These drugs are commonly combined in 
various regimens, and can be further partnered with monoclonal antibodies targeting 
VEGF or EGFR signaling. Recently, two additional therapeutic options have gained 
approval. The clinical efficacy and safety of STIVARGA (regorafenib), a kinase inhibitor, 
were evaluated in an international, randomized (2:1), placebo -controlled trial in 
previously -treated 760 mCRC patients (Grothey et al, 2013) . The major efficacy 
outcom e measure was OS which showed significant, although modest, improvement 
(6.4 vs 5mo), and no effect on PFS nor ORR: 2mo vs 1.7mo, and 1% vs 4%, 
respectively (Stivarg aUSPI, 2012 ). LONSURF is a combination of trifluridine (a 
nucleoside metabolic inhibitor), and tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965] (a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor)

Protocol Number:  20150195

CONFIDENT IAL(LONSURF USPI, 2015 ). Its clinical efficacy and safety were evaluated in a similar 
setting (800 patients with previously treated mCRC). A statistically significant 
improvement in overall sur vival (7.1 vs 5.3mo) and progression- free survival were 
demonstrated.  Evidently, for most patients with mCRC available treatment is pal liative 
rather than curative , with an overall 5 -year s urvival of approximately 10% . 
Subsequently, additional options ar e needed for patients who have disease progression 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_432471], since many of them maintain good performance 
status and might be candidates for further treatments.
In the light of recent advances in the immunotherapeutics space, th e potential 
significance of the immune system in tumor biology has been investigated for CRC as 
well(Kroemer et al, 2015; Markman and Shiao, 2015 ).  The presence of tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes —especially CD8  + lymphocytes —in the tumor microenvironment, as well as 
regional lymph nodes, has been linked to better prognosis . Also, increased infiltration of 
specific regions of the CRC tumors by [CONTACT_432499] T lymphocytes 
(CD8+ CD45RO +T cells) was highly correlated with reduced risk of recurrence o f CRC 
and better survival . The prognostic significance of T cells—unlike other inflammatory 
cells—argues that cancer immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_432472] T cell responses could lead to 
improved survival. Nonetheless, there was an almost co mplete lack of response to 
anti-PD-1/PD -L1 agents in CRC patients, except when adm inistered in combination with 
bevacizumab +/ -FOLFOX (a ph1b study with MPDL3280A) , or in CRC patients with a 
deficit in mismatch repair genes (dMMR). A dMMR system is present in 10 –20% of 
patients with sporadic CRC and is associated with a favorable prognosis in early -stage 
disease. In contrast, dMMR occurs in only 3 –6% of pat ients with advanced CRC
(Llosa et al, 2015) .Recent findings have suggested that checkpoint inhibitors may have 
increased activi ty in dMMR tumors, since dMMR have several times as many somatic 
mutations a s proficient MMR tumors , and have prominent lymphocyte infiltrates , which 
are m ore likely to express PD -L1,  a hypothesis which was tested in a Phase II trial
(Leet al, 2015) . This study showed that MMR status may be a predictive biomarker for 
clinical benefit from checkpoint inhibition . Although immunotherapy in dMMR tumors 
holds great promise, the complete absence of response in patients with proficient MMR 
CRC—who represent the vast majority —highlights the ongoing need to understand why 
patients with conventional CRC lack robust responses to immunotherapy.

CONFIDENT IAL2.1.4 Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), representing 95% of pancreatic cancers, 
remains one of t he most lethal cancer types with an overall 5- year survival rate of less 
than 5 %, and a median survi val of less than 6 months . It is estimated that near 
40,000 people died of PDA in 2014, rendering it the fourth leading cause of 
cancer -related death in the [LOCATION_003] (Cid-Aregui and Ju arez, 2015 ). Early -stage PDA is 
asymptomatic, while patients with symptoms are often diagnosed as advanced and 
metastatic disease when less than 15 % are sui table for surgical resection. Hence, 
chemotherapy is the only option for most patients. For the last two decades, 
gemcitabine has been the standard first -line drug, however with only modest survival 
benefits. While different gemcitabine based combinations have been investigated in a 
number of randomized trials, only very few showed some beneficial effects, like for 
example gemcitabine plus erlotinib or gemcitabine plus S -1
(Cid-Aregui and Ju arez, 2015) . Recently,  gemcitabine plus albumin bound -paclitaxel 
(nab-paclitaxel) as well as a regimen combining fluorouracil, irinotec an, oxaliplatin, and 
leucovorin (FOLFIRINOX) have shown clear therapeutic advantage in advanced PDAC 
in phase IIItrials, over single agent gemcitabine. With the pending issue of their higher 
toxicities, these regimens now set the reference for ongoing an d future clinical studies in 
advanced PDAC. FOLFIRINOX showed significant improvement i n median overall 
survival (11.1 months vs. 6.8 months with gemcitabine) in patients with Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG) performance status 0-1. Progression -free 
survival was also improved, from 3.4 to 6.4 months. Definitive deterioration in the quality 
of life at 6 mo was observed in 31% of patients in the FOLFIRINOX and in 66% in the 
gemcitabine group. However, the toxicity associated with FOLFIRINOX is im portant, in 
particular grade 3 and 4 myelosuppression and fatigue . For nab- paclitaxel combined 
with gemcitabine the median overall survival improved to 8.5 mo from 6.7 mo with 
gemcitabine alone (p < 0.001). The 1 -year survival rate was 35% and 22%, respectively, 
and the 2 -year survival was 9% and 4%, respectively. ORR was 23% and 7%, 
respectively. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher, such as myelosuppression and 
peripheral neuropathy were however increased in the combined nab- paclitaxel plus 
gemcitabine arm(Cid-Aregui and Ju arez, 2015) .In addition to chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], a 
number of agents targeting signaling pathways in tumor or stroma cells are being 
investigated. Likewise, immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_432473] a number of c linical trials (Cid-Aregui and Ju arez, 2015) .

CONFIDENT IALA heavy infiltration of CD4 and CD8+ T cells expressing programmed cell death 1 (PD -1) 
and smaller numbers of myeloid cells and regulatory T cells seen in the PDA tissues 
provided rationale for the clinical evaluation of immune checkpoint inhibition as a 
pancreatic cancer therapeutic strategy (Komura et al, 2015; Brahmer et al, 2012 ). 
However, anti -PD-[ADDRESS_547776] been unsuccessful when tested in a small number of 
patients with advanced stage PDA, suggesting that it may be necessary to address the 
immunosuppressive effects of other PD -1 ligands or block additional co -inhibitory 
pathways (Brahmer et al, 2012) . The PDA tissues appear also to be infiltrated by 
[CONTACT_179968], especially M2 macrophages. In the recent years, line of evidence had 
tried to clarify how the monocytes were recruited and the mechanism by [CONTACT_432500]. CSF/CSFR is a commonly accepted signaling pathway 
that associates with the process . Generally, the r egional microenvironment, which is 
featured by [CONTACT_432501], plays a decisive role in recruiting monocytes and 
modulating macrophage phenotype. Since different areas of a solid tumor may exhibit 
distinct microenvironment, TAMs differ in phenotype as well as function from one region 
to another. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], TAMs in the hypoxia region polarize to M2, while those within the 
normoxic regions tend to be M1- like(Colegio et al, 2014 ).  Recent reports suggested 
that the macrophage phenotype is also st age d ependent. For example, the 
anti-inflammation M1 -like macrophages, which usually locate in chronic pancreatitis 
where tumor occurs, gradually converted to M2 -like during tumor initiation and 
progression , reflecting the plasticity as well as heterogene ity of TAMs. As a support, 
pathological data revealed that M2 -like macrophages were more abundant in PDA 
samples than those diagno sed as chronic pancreatitis (Komura et al , 2015) . 
Consistently, further analysis showed that the M2 -like macrophages associated with 
lymphatic metastasis, distant metastasis, chemoresistance, and hence the survival of 
the PDA patients .Additional evidence of inflammatory features of PDA form findings of 
the significantly elevated levels of interleukin (IL) -6, IL-7, IL- 15, mon ocyte chemotac tic 
protein -1, and interferon-c- inducible protein -1 in the sera of PDAC patients. The g ene 
expression profile of CD14+ monocytes and CD4+ T cells was discernible between 
PDAC patients and healthy volunteers, and the differentially expressed genes were 
related to active inflammation. Intriguingly, PD -1 was significantly upregulated in the 
peripheral blood CD4+ T cells of PDAC patients. Correspondingly, the frequency of 
CD4+PD -1+ T cells was increased in the peripheral blood cells of PDAC patie nts, and 
this increase correlated to chemotherapy resistance. In conclusion, inflammatory 
conditions in both PDAC tissue and peripheral blood cells in PDAC patients appear to be

survival for advanced disease of less than 5% despi[INVESTIGATOR_232221] a comprehensive therapeutic 
approach. In few tumor types with distinct molecular alterations, unprecedented benefits 
can be delivered by [CONTACT_432502][INVESTIGATOR_014] .For most patients with 
advanced NSCLC, platinum -based chemotherapy with or without maintenance therap y, 
and subsequently followed by [CONTACT_91307] -line cytotoxic chemotherapy, is the standard 
treatment (median survival of approximately 1 year).  Second -line cytotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (ie, 
docetaxel, pemetrexed and erlotinib) have only moderate efficacy and are associat ed
with significant toxicities .For this reason, strategies such as immunotherapy, which may 
have efficacy irrespective of histology or mutational status, are particularly attractive
(Minguet et al, 2015; Garon et al, 2015 ). Latest approvals (2015) of several 
immunotherapy agents reflect the scientific progress poised to shape further the patient 
outcomes in this indication (Garon et al, 2015; Romero, 2015 ). As such, anti –PD-1 and 
anti–PD-L1 antibodies have been shown to produce durable responses in cl inical trials in 
approximately 20% of patients with advanced non –small -cell lung cancer, even without 
selecting for PD -L1 tumor expression .  Pembrolizumab has been recently approved for 
the treatment of subjects with advanced (metastatic) NSCLC whose disea se has 
progressed after other treatments and have tumors that express PD -L1. In a phase 1 
study (KEYNOTE -001) 495 patients received pembrolizumab (at a dose of either 2 mg 
or 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 week s or 10 mg per kilogram every 
2weeks) (Garon et al 2015 ).Among all the patients, the objective response rate was 
19.4%, and the median duration of response was 12.5 months. The median duration of 
progression -free survival was 3.7 months, and the median duration of overall survival 
was 12.0 months. Among all the patients with a PD -L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) of 
at least 50%, median progression- free survival was 6.3 months, and the median overall 
survival was not reached. In a subgroup of  these patients (73/[ADDRESS_547777] 50%), the response rate was 45.2%. Among the 
1143 screened patients, 824 had samples that could be evaluated by [CONTACT_46685] -trial 
assay, with a prevalence of 23.2% of patients with a PD -L1 TPS of at least 50%, 37.6% 
with a score of 1 to 49%, and 39.2% with a score of less than 1% by [CONTACT_46685] -trial 
assay. The prevalence of a proportion score of at least 50% was 24.9% among 
previously untreated patients and 22.7% among previously treated patients. The ORR in

(PD-L1 TPS <1%) (Garon et al, 2015 ).
A recent sensitivity analysis of nivolumab, and pembrolizumab activity according to the 
tumor expression of PD -L1 (Carbognin et al, 2015 ) suggests a significant differential 
effect in terms of activity according to PD -L1 expression on tumor cells status, which 
translated into a higher ORR for PD -L1 positive adva nced tumors in comparison to 
PD-L1 negative tumors. W ith respect to disease setting, the analysis showed evidence 
of such effect for melanoma and NSCLC, and less for genitourinary cancers. 
Considering the PD -L1 expression cut -off, the difference in ORR between PD -L1 
positive and negative patients was significantly higher in studies adopting the cut -off of 
5%, with an absolute difference of 15.5% (95% CI 9.5– 21.4). No significant difference 
was seen for trials where the cut -off was 1% (p=0.108) (Carbognin et al, 2015 ). In two 
randomized phIII studies in squamous NSCLC (CheckMate 017) (Brahmer et al, 2015 ) 
and non- squamous NSCLC (CheckMate 057) (Borghaei et al, 2015 ) OPDIVO was 
evaluated again st docetaxel. Significant improvement was reported in both trials for OS 
(9.2 vs 6.2mo, and 12,2 vs 9.4mo, respectively). ORR in the CheckMate 057 study was 
19% in the OPDIVO arm vs 12% in the docetaxel arm. In the CheckMate 063 study , a 
phII, single arm study of OPDIVO in squamous NSCLC patients who had progressed 
after platinum based therapy and second line systemic chemotherapy, ORR was 15%, 
with 59% patients having responses of 6 months or longer (Rizvi et al, 2015 ).

AMG820 mediated pharmacodynamic effects included increase in CSF -[ADDRESS_547781] ion of macrophages number in the skin, and decrease in TRAP5b levels. No

2.2.3 AMG 820 Pharmacodynamics
Serum CSF- 1 levels were determined for several time points following each AMG 820 
dose for subjects in the 0.5- mg/kg QW  and 1.5- mg/kg t o 20-mg/kg Q2 W cohorts.  At 
0.5mg/kg QW  AMG 820, CSF -1 levels were observed to rise from baseline over 3 to 
5days following dosing before decreasing towards baseline.  At higher doses of 
AMG820 (1.5 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg Q2 W AMG 820), CSF -1 levels were similarly 
increased after dosing and elevated CSF -1 levels were sustained for the remaind er of 
the dosing interval.  At 10 mg/kg Q2 W AMG 820, CSF- 1 levels appeared to reach a 
plateau after 3 weeks of exposure to AMG 820.  
Changes in serum IL-34 levels over time were assessed in all cohorts.  IL -34 levels did 
not demonstrate a dose- response relationship to AMG 820 administration.
2.2.4 AMG 820 Dose Rationale
In this study, AMG 820 will be administered at a fixed dose of 1400 mg in combination 
with 200 mg fixed dose of pembrolizumab as an intravenous infusion Q3W .
TheAMG 820 dose of 1400 mg Q3 W IV infusion is supported by [CONTACT_53441] 820 PK and PD
(serum CSF -1 concentration) observed in the first -in-human FIH study (20060347).
Maximum concentrations (C max) are predicted to be within a range of observed C max 
exposures at AMG 820 dose levels that were safe and tolerated in the FIH study.  In 
addition, AMG 820 concentrations after IV infusion at 1400 mg are predicted to remain 
above concentrations associated with the observed maximum CSF- 1 response in the 
FIH study.
In the FIH study, subjects received AMG 820 Q2W by [CONTACT_432505] 1.5 to 20 mg/kg, with body weights ranging from 44.4 to 159 kg.  Among all 
subjects, AMG 820 was determined to be safe and tolerated. A maximum tolerated 
dose level was not identified in the FIH study. 
A transiti on from weight -based dosi ng (mg/kg) to fixed dosing (mg) is supported by 
[CONTACT_53441]820 PK in the FIH study.  In terms of clinical experience ,the [ADDRESS_547783]:  A MG 820
Protocol Number:  20150195

CONFIDENT IAL(Cmaxand C 336h) were observed for all subjects.  Predictions of AMG 820 exposure at 
1400 mg include:
The range of C max (at 1 hour, end of infusion) values observed in FIH subjects on
day 1 were 44.9 to 744 μg/mL. At 1400 mg IV, a C max of approximately 550 μg/mL 
was predicted from interpolation of C max versus dose.
The range of trough concentration (at 336 hours), C 336h, values observed in FIH 
subjects on day 1 were 1.23 to 231 μg/mL. At 1400 mg IV, a C 336h of 
approximately 150 μg/mL was predicted from interpolation of C 336h versus dose.
Importantly, a summary of C max and AUC exposures from the FIH study, no rmalized by 
[CONTACT_2715], did not reveal an apparent trend over the rang e of body weights of subjects , 
providing support for a flat -based dose approach.
In addition, a population PK model developed from the FIH study was used to predict 
trough concentrations anticipated at the end of the proposed 3 week dosing interval.  
Based on population PK predictions, following Q3W  dosing of 1400 mg AMG 820, trough 
concentrations are predicted to remain above concentrations associated with maximum 
CSF-1 resp onse observed in the FIH study.
2.3 Risk A ssessment
There are no important identified risks for AMG 820.
Important potential risks for AMG 820 include increased extracellular matrix, infection, 
growth plate changes and immunogenicity.  Refer to the AMG 820 IB for additional risk
information.
No significant risks or drug -drug interactions with pembrolizumab are anticipated at the 
AMG 820 starting dose of 1400 mg in the proposed study.   Explored AMG 820 dose 
levels ranging from 0.5 mg/kg QW and 1.5mg/kg to 20 mg/kg Q2 W were genera lly 
well-tolerated in the FIH study. Approximately [ADDRESS_547784] Background : Pembrolizumab
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) with high specificity of binding to the programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1) receptor, 
thus inhibiting its interaction with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) and 
programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD -L2).  Based on preclinical in vitro data, 
pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD -1.

the majority of patients do not show a response to monotherapy. A potential mechanism 
of resistance to anti -PD-1 therapy is the immunosuppressive activity of tumor 
infiltrat ing/associa ted macrophages , which may impair the T cells’ ability to enter the 
tumor itself or hamper the intra -tumoral T cell activation. CSF -1R mediates proliferation, 
survival, and differentiation of tissue resident macrophages. Inhibition and depletion of 
TAMs t hrough CSF- 1R blockade may therefore relieve immunosuppressive pathways 
that restrict productive anti -tumor T cell res ponses and result in enhanced T cell 
responses against tumors. CSF -1R blockade as monotherapy was shown to reduce 
TAMs frequency in human tumors and pre -clinical murine tumor models, and had mild 
efficacy in syngeneic murine tumor models. CSF -1R blockade combined with chemo 
and/or T cell -targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as anti -PD-1, has led to increased T cell

If 0 or 1 of the initial 6 evaluable subjects experience a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) 
then the dose combination will be determined to be tolerable and Part 2 initiated.
If 2 of the initial 6 evaluable subjects experience a DLT then 3 additional evaluable 
subjects will be enrolled. 
If 3or more of the evaluable subjects experience a DLT (eg,33% or higher with

Prior to opening a subsequent cohort for enrollment, the Dose Level Review Team 
(DLRT) will evaluate data from subjects enrolled into prior cohorts (at least 21 days of 
safety follow -up) including events with a longer onset time or events following exposure 
to multiple doses.  If late onset events occur during a cohort, the DLRT may adaptively

5. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT
Before subjects begin participation in any study -specific activities/procedures, [COMPANY_010] 
requires a copy of the site’s written IRB/IEC approval of the protocol, informed consent 
form, and all other subject information and/or recruitme nt material, if applicable (see 
Section 11.2).  All subjects must personally sign and date the IRB/IEC and [COMPANY_010] 
approved informed consent form before commencement of study -specific 
activit ies/procedures.   
A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met
all eligibility criteria.  The investigator is to document this decision and date, in the 
subject’s medical record and in/on the enrollment case report form ( CRF).
Each subject who enters into the screening period for the study (defined when the 
subject signs the informed consent ) receives a unique subject identification number 
before any study -related activit ies/procedures are performed.  The subject identification 
number will be assigned manually .  This number will be used to identify the subject 
throug hout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that 
subject.  Subjects who do not meet all eligibility criteria may be rescreened at the 
discretion of the investigator.  If a subject is being rescreened, he or she may need t o 
reconsent to the study to ensure that the IRB/IEC approved main informed consent form 
is signed within [ADDRESS_547830] remain constant throughout the entire clinical 
study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, includ ing if a subject is 
rescreened.

[IP_ADDRESS].3 Dose -limiting Toxicity  Definition
An adverse event will be considered related to study treat ment (possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to the study treatment)  if there is a suspected “reasonable causal 
relationship” to the study treatment (ICH E2A), and not only a lack of an alternative 
explanation for the toxicity. All toxicities will be g raded using the CTCAE version 4.0 
(Appendix A).
The occurrence of any of the following toxicities during DLT evaluation period (ie, 21 day
period from the initial administration of AMG 820 and pembrolizumab in combination) will 
be considered a DLT, if judged by [CONTACT_432510] 820 and/or pembrolizumab:
Grade 4 non -hematologic toxicity
Grade 3 or higher pneumonitis 
Grade 3 non -hematologic toxicity lasting > 7days despi[INVESTIGATOR_301977]
Grade 3 fatigue will not be classified as DLT, irrespective of duration
Any grade 3 or higher non -hematologic laboratory value if:
-medical interv ention is required, or
-the abnormality leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or
-the abnormality persists at grade 3 or higher for > 1 week unless deemed not 
clinically important per both investigator and sponsor

thrombocytopenia lasting > 48 hours or any thrombocytopenia requiring 
intervention
Delay in cycle 2 treatment for > 2 weeks due to study drug -related toxicity (unless 
clearly attributable to pembrolizuma bonly and delay is caused due to tapering of 
steroids)
Any other intolerable toxicity leading to permanent discontinuation of AMG 820 or 
pembrolizumab 
Lymphopenia of any grade is not considered a DLT 
Dose limiting toxicities do not include the following:
A transient (resolving to grade ≤  1 within 6 hours of onset) grade 3 
infusion- related adverse event
Any grade 3 endocrinopathy that is adequately controlled by [CONTACT_432511] -escalation. 
If an AE is clearly attributable to pembrolizumab (based on its known safety profile) and 
does not exceed the expected severity, this specific AE may be considered exempt from 
being a DLT.
Disease rela ted events should not be considered a DLT.
Any subject meeting the criteria for Hy’s Law case (ie, severe drug -induced liver injury) 
will be considered a DLT.  A Hy’s Law case is defined as: AST or ALT values of 
≥ [ADDRESS_547844] AND with serum total bilirubin level (TBL) of > [ADDRESS_547845] without signs of 
cholestasis and with no other clear alternative reaso n to explain the observed 
liver-related laboratory abnormalities (see Section 6.4on hepatotoxicity management 
andAppendix Afor further explanation of Hy’s law case and Management of Hepatic 
Function).
If a subject experiences a DLT during the DLT evaluation period, study treatment should
be discontinued for that subject.  Additionally, any treatment related toxicity meeting th e 
DLT definition after day 21 should result in discontinuation of therapy.  In subjects with 
irPR, irCR or evidence of clinical benefit (as determined by [CONTACT_093]), an option to 
continue at the same or at a reduced dose level can be considered once the toxicity 
returns to the subject’s b aseline value or CTCAE grade ≤ [ADDRESS_547846]:  A MG 820

Criteria in Solid tumor irRECIST (ref,  Appendix D ).  A contrast-enhanced MRI should be 
the preferred imaging method for tumor staging.  A CT should be done when MRI is not 
possible, is relatively contraindicated (eg, allergy to contrast) or for the evaluation of 
body sites where MRI is not the recommended adequate staging method.  In order to 
reduce radiation exposure for subjects, low dose CT techniques should be applied 
whenever possible.  Organ-specific imaging protocols or existing diagnostic guidelines 
should be followed whenever possible to evaluate the full extent of the disease 
appropriately.   
Radiographic imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis are required at screening.  
Tumor assessments must also include all other sites of disease.  The screening scans 
must be performed within [ADDRESS_547908], along with tumor assessments 
of all other sites of disease, will be performed independent of treatment cycle at week 10 
(±1 week), and then every 10 weeks (±2 weeks) or more frequently if clinically indicated 
until confirmed PD per irRECIST or start of new anticancer treatment.  Response 
(immune-related Complete Response [irCR], immune-related Partial Response [irPR]) 
and progression (immune-related Progressive Disease [irPD]) require confirmation by a 
repeat, consecutive assessment no less than [ADDRESS_547909] imaging assessment was performed  [ADDRESS_547910] has not had evidence of confirmed disease progression. 
All radiological imaging scans will be done as indicated in the Imaging Manual provided 
by [CONTACT_89709].  All subsequent scans will be performed in the same manner as 
at screening, preferably on the same scanner (unless a subject develops hypersensitivity

consultation with [COMPANY_010] and the imaging core laboratory).
Determination of disease response for clinical management of subjects will be assessed 
at the clinical sites per irRECIST.  Scans wil l be submitted to the imaging core laboratory 
and may be used for response assessment including RECIST 1.1, irRECIST and 
exploratory analysis such as volumetric and viable tumor measurements.  Detailed 
information regarding the submission of images to the core laboratory is found in the 
Imaging Manual.
7.4.1 Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scans
Brain MRI scans will be conducted at screening for all NSCLC subjects.  In subjects with 
known brain metastasis, brain MRI scans will be conducted at screening and at th e 
same schedule as MRI/CT scans. Brain MRI scans may also be performed at any time, 
if in the judgment of the investigator, the subject displays signs or symptoms of central 
nervous system (CNS) disease progression.

outlined in Appendix D.
7.5 Antibody  Testing Procedures
Blood sample(s) for Antibody testing are to be collected as indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments, Table 5 ,for the potential measurement of anti -AMG 820 and 
anti-pembrolizumab binding antibodies.  Samples testing positive for anti-AMG 820 or 
anti-pembrolizumab binding antibodies may also be tested for neutralizing antibodies 
and may be further characterized for quantity/titer, isotype, affinity and presence of 
immune complexes.  Additional blood samples may be obtained to rule out 
anti-AMG 820antibodies during the study.

9. SAFETY DA TA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING
9.1 Definition of Safety  Events
9.1.1 Disease Related Events
Disease Related Events are events (serious or non- serious) anticipated to occur in the 
study population due to the underlying disease.  These could include overall disease 
progression or pain or discomfort caused by [CONTACT_304397]. Such events do not meet 
the definition of an Adverse Event unless assessed to be more severe than expected for 
the subject’s condition. 
Disease Related Events and/or Disease Related Outcomes that do not qualify as 
Serious Adverse Events: 
An event which is part of the normal course of disease under study (eg, disease 
progression in oncology or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44814]) is to be 
reported as a Disease Related Event. 
Death due to the disease under study is to be recorded on the Event CRF.
If the outcome of the underlying disease is worse than that which would normally be 
expected for the subject, or if the investigator belie ves there is a causal relationship 
between the investigational product(s)/study treatment protocol required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_75586], this must be reported as a n Adverse Event or Serious Adverse 
Event.
9.1.[ADDRESS_547920]’s medical record.  
The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre- existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying disease 
(eg,diabetes, migraine h eadaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than would be expected , and/or has an association with a significantly 
Product:  A MG 820
Protocol Number:  20150195
Date:  15 June 2018 Page 78of 117
CONFIDENTIA Lworse outcome than expected.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more 
than anticipated (ie, more t han usual fluctuation of disease) during the study or involves 
an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study ,
is not considered an adverse event.   
For situations when an adverse event or serious adverse event is due to the primary 
tumor type being studied ,report all known signs and symptoms.   Death due to disease 
progression in the absence of signs and symptoms should be reported as the primary 
tumor type (eg, metastatic pancreatic cancer).
Note:   The term “disease progression” should not be used to describe the disease 
related event or adverse event.
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally acceptable representative requests to withdraw from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21884], refer to Section 8.1for additional instructions on 
the procedures recommended for safe withdrawal from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_83310].   
9.1.[ADDRESS_547921] 1 of the 
following serious criteria (unless it meets the definition of a Disease Related Event as 
defined in Section 9.1.1 ):
fatal
life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)
requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
congenital anomaly/birth defect
other medically important serious event
A dis ease related event (eg,disease progression or pain or discomfort cau sed by 
[CONTACT_432521] t umors) is to be reported as a serious adverse event if 
the subject’s pre -existing condition becomes worse than what the investigator would 
consider typi[INVESTIGATOR_21885] a patient with the same underlying condition, or
if the investigator believes a causal relationship exists between the investigational 
medicinal product(s)/protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21886], 
and the event meets at least [ADDRESS_547922]:  A MG 820
Protocol Number:  20150195

CONFIDENTIA LAn adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”, if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).  
If an i nvestigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix Afor 
drug-induced liver injury reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an emergency 
room visit , outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.

AMG 820 or pembrolizumab, whichever is later )are reported using the Event CRF.  
Additionally, the investigator is required to report a fatal Disease Related E vent on the 
Event CRF.  
Disease -Related Events assessed by [CONTACT_432522]/or related to the investigational medicinal product(s)/study

pembrolizumab through the safety follow -up visit (ie, 135[+7] days after the last dose of 
AMG 820 or pembrolizumab, whichever is later )are reported using the Event CRF.
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:
Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms),
Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved or improved to a lower grade ),
Severity [and/or toxicity per protocol],

This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  Is th ere a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_73639](s) ?  
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any 
study -mandated activity (eg, administration of investigational product, protocol -required 
procedure (including any screening procedure(s)).  This relationship is indicated by a 
“yes” or “no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by a study ac tivity (eg, administration of investigational product,  
protocol -required procedure”? 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory 
findings without clinical significance (based on the 
investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require t reatment 
or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  W here applicable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event.
If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to th e date of 
resolution, record a single event for each level of severity on the Event CRF.
The Investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Procedures for Serious A dverse Events
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by 
[CONTACT_432524] 135(+7) days after the cessation of all study treatment are recorded in the 
subject’s medi cal record and are submitted to [COMPANY_010] .  Additionally, treatment related 
serious adverse events that occur after the safety follow -up visit through the end of the 
long-term follow -up will be reported.
All serious adverse events must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the

studies where the first notification of a Serious Adverse Event is reported to [COMPANY_010] via 
the electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form, the data must be 
entered into the EDC system when the system is again available.
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
any study -mandated activity or procedure.   This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by a study activity/procedure”? 
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events un til stabilization

All new information for serious adverse events must be sent to [COMPANY_010] within [ADDRESS_547925] be submitted to [COMPANY_010].
[COMPANY_010] will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs

[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious A dverse Events A fter the Protocol- required 
Reporting Period
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for new serious adverse events 
following the protocol -required reporting period after the end of study.   However, these 
serious adverse events can be reported to [COMPANY_010].  In some countries (eg, European 
Union [EU] member states), investigators are required to report serious adverse events

CONFIDENTIA L9.6 Definition and Reporting of Pembrolizumab Drug -induced Liver 
Injury
For the purpose of this trial, potential DILI associated with (“resulting from”) 
pembrolizumab will be defined as:
elevated AST or ALT ≥[ADDRESS_547931] and elevated total bilirubin ≥[ADDRESS_547932]
AND ALP < than [ADDRESS_547933] of protocol -specified laboratory 
testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.*
*Note:  These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents.  The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnorm al hepatic tests that may 
require an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology.  The trial site guidance for 
assessment and follow -upof these criteria will be provided in separate guidance 
document entitled, the pembrolizumab Event of Clinical Inte rest Guidance for Potential 
DILI in Clinical Trials .  
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of DILI associated with pembrolizumab , 
cases of concurrent DILI according to the criteria specified above require the following:
The event is to be repo rted to [COMPANY_010] as an adverse event of potential DILI within 
24hours of discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic 
investigations have been concluded)
The appropriate CRF (eg, Event CRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitate the evaluation of treatment -emergent liver abnormalities is to be completed.
Workup to confirm DILI should be immediately initiated as described in the 
pembrolizumab Event of Clinical Interest Guidance for Potential DILI in Clinical Trials 
document.  Any confirmed event of DILI is tobe reported as a serious adverse event 
within 24 hours after confirmation of the event.  
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a s erious adverse event defined in Section 9.1.3 .

10.1.3 Covariates and Subgroups
The relationship of covariates to efficacy endpoints will be explored if appropriate.
Biomarker data (eg,PD-L1 expression) may be incorporated in additional explo ratory 
subgroup or multivariate analyses. The exploratory analyses of biomarkers may be 
performed after collection of all samples during the conduct of the study and therefore 
may be reported af ter the primary analysis of the safety and efficacy endpoints.   
10.2 Sample Size Considerations
It is anticipated that 67to 197subjects will be enrolled overall in this study. 
Part 1 will enroll 6 to 18 evaluable subjects. The sample size in Part 1 is based on 
practical consideration, and it is consistent with conventional oncology studies with the 
objective to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a treatment combination.  With 
6subjects in a cohort, there is a 47 -91% probability of observing at least one DLT if the 
true DLT rate is 10 -33%.

in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work 
are appropriately investigated and resolved .  Authors should meet 
conditions 1, 2, and 3.
When a large, multi center group has conducted the work, the group should identify 
the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals 
should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above.
Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship.
All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who 
qualify should be listed.
Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content.

CONFIDENTIA LAppendix D.  Modified Immune -Related Response Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(irRECIST )
The Immune -related Response Criteria (irRC) based on bidimensional measurements 
were derived from WHO/RECIST to serve as guidelines to systematically characterize 
additional patterns of response in patients with advanced melanoma receiving 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_432485] -enhancing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_432486] (Wolchok JD et al., 2009 ).  
Recent evaluation showed that irRC using unidimensional measurements provided 
highly concordant tumor response assessment and less measurement variability 
compared with bidimensional measurements ( Nishino M et al., 2013). This study will 
utilize amodified criteria (irRECIST), adapting the immune -related response criteria to 
conventional RECIST 1.1 (Eisenhauer et al, 2009) as outlined below.
Antitumor response based on total measurable tumor burden
For irR ECIST , only index and measurable new lesions are taken into account (in 
contrast to conventional RECIST 1.1 , which do esnot require the measurement of 
new lesions, nor do they include new lesion measurements in the characterizati on of 
evolving tumor burden).
Tumor burden assessment :
All measurable and non -measurable lesions should be assessed at screening and at 
the defined tumor assessment time points.
oAt baseline tumor assessment: tumor burden is the sum of the longest 
diameters (S LD) of all index lesions ( 5lesions per organ , up to 10total 
lesions) . 
oAt each subsequent tumor assessment: tumor burden is the S LD of the index 
lesions and of new, measurable lesions ( >10mmin the longest diameter ; up 
to 5new lesions per organ and up to 10 total lesions) added together
Tumor burden = S LDindex lesions + SLDnew, measurable lesions
Time point response assessment using modified irR ECIST
Percentage changes in tumor burden per assessment time point describe the size and 
growth kinetics of both conventional and new lesions as they appear.  At each tumor 
assessment, the response in index and new measurable lesions is defined based on the 
change in tumor burden (after ruling out irPD).  Decreases in tumor burden must be 
assessed relative to baseline measurements (ie, th e SLD of all index lesions at 
screening).  
Product:  A MG 820
Protocol Number:  20150195
Date:  15 June 2018 Page 111of 117
CONFIDENTIA LDefinitions: 
Methods of measurement:
oThe same imaging modality, method of assessment, and technique must be 
used throughout the study to characterize each id entified and reported lesion.
oMRI or CT scans should b e performed with contiguous slice thickness of 
5mm or less according to the Imaging Manual . Subjects should be evaluated 
at screening for tolerance to MRI/CT IV contrast.  Subjects intolerant of CT IV 
contrast ie ,allergy or renal insufficiency should be imaged using non -contrast 
CT for the chest and MRI (with or without contrast) for the abdomen and 
pelvis to enable the best detection of disease throughout the study starting at 
baseline.  If a subject develops a m edical contradiction to the MRI/CT IV 
contrast while on study, preapproval of the sponsor is needed to switch from 
contrast enhanced MRI to non- contrast MRI or to CT(and vice versa).
oIf a combined PET/CT scan is performed at the discretion of the investig ator
at baseline and subsequent timepoints , the CT portion of that exam should 
not be substituted for the dedicated diagnostic CT exams required by [CONTACT_432534] a PET/CT is of identical diagnostic quality to the
diagnostic CT as described in the Imaging Manual, then the CT portion of the 
PET/CT can be used for tumor measurements.
oPathological lymph nodes (short axis >10 mm ) should be assessed by 
[CONTACT_9268]/CT.  Only node s with short axis >15 mm are to be included as 
measurable lesions.
oPatients with suspected brain metastases will also undergo MRI of the brain.
oAll baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment ,and not more than 28 days before the beginning of 
the treatment (cycle 1 day 1) .
Measurable disease: Subject must have radiographically measurable disease per 
RECIST 1.1 ( Eisenhauer et al, 2009 ).  
oMeasurable le sions:
Lesions with clear borders that can be measured accurately in 
onedimension (longest diameter > 10 mm as measured by [CONTACT_9268]/CT 
with scan slice thickness <5 mm).
Pathologic lymph nodes aremeasurable when the longest diameter 
perpendicular to the long axis (s hort axis) is>15 mm on MRI/CT . 
Must exclude cystic lesions, pleural/pericardial effusions and ascites.
oNon-Measurable lesions: 
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 mm but < 15 mm sh ort axis) and 
other truly non -measurable lesions are considered non -measurable 
and characterized as non- index lesions. 
Product:  A MG 820
Protocol Number:  20150195
Date:  15 June 2018 Page 112of 117
CONFIDENTIA LOnly cancerous lesions should be selected as non -measurable 
lesions and not indeterminate lesions and lesions that could be 
cancer. Oth er examples of non -measurable lesions include some 
bone lesions*, leptomeningeal disease, inflammatory breast disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of the skin or (lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis), 
and groups of lesions that are small and numerous.
Fluid collections
oAscites, pleural effusion, or pericardial effusion, should not be 
selected as non- measurable disease at baseline or, if new or 
increased, as evidence of progressive disease. These 
collections may occur with both benign and malignant 
conditions, and thei r etiology is often not clear. These 
collections may often be removed via interventional 
procedures, which can lead to a false interpretation of disease 
response. Thus, these fluid collections should not be used as 
a baseline non- index or as evidence of di sease response.
Bone Lesions
oBone scans, PET scans or plain films are not considered 
adequate imaging techniques to measures bone lesions. 
However, these techniques can be used to confirm the 
presence or absence of bone lesions.
oOsteolytic (lytic) bone les ions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, 
with identifiable soft tissue components, that can be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_12783] -sectional imaging technique such as CT or MRI can 
be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue 
component meets the definition of measura bility described 
above. Only the soft tissue component of the bone lesion 
should be measured.
oMany osteoblastic (blastic) bone abnormalities can be benign 
and should not be selected as baseline lesions. An isolated 
new small blastic lesion should not be selected as a new 
lesion unless there is demonstrated growth on subsequent 
scans. Multiple new blastic lesions that are clearly cancerous 
may be considered for new lesions.
Cystic lesions:
oLesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined 
simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions 
(neither measurable or non- measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.
oCystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be 
considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition 
of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic 
lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred 
for selection as index lesions. If a cystic lesion is clearly 
cancerous and has both cystic and solid components, then the 
complete les ion should be measured including both 
components without excluding the cystic portion of a cystic 
tumor lesion when measuring.

CONFIDENTIA LLesions with prior local treatment:
oTumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or an 
area subject to other loco -regional therapy, should not be 
considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated 
progression in the lesion.
oIndex lesions: all measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5lesions per organ 
and [ADDRESS_547989]’s tumor 
burden and overall d isease status .
oNew lesions: New measureable lesions (ie ,accurately and serially 
measure able in at least 1 dimension >10 mm for non -nodal lesions or the 
short axis is ≥15mm for nodal lesions).  The new measurable lesions should 
be selected on the basis of their size and suitability for accurate repeated 
measurements by [CONTACT_462].  If there are more than [ADDRESS_547990] , lesions not selected 
for measurements would be considered non -Index lesions.
oNon-Index lesions: measurable lesions, other than index lesions, and all sites 
of non-measurable disease, will be identified as non -index lesions.  
Non-index lesions will be evaluated at the same assessment time points as 
the index lesions.  In subsequent assessments, changes in non- index lesions 
will contribute only in the assessment of complete response.
Pathologic lymph nodes with short axis ≥10 mm but < 15 mm at 
baseline should be considered as non -index lesions 
oUnable to evaluate (UE):  Any lesion present at baseline which was not 
assessed or was unable to be evaluated leading to an inability to determine 
the status of that particular tumor for that time point
oNot Available (NA): Scan not available
oNot Done (ND):  Radiographic imag ingwere not perfo rmed at this time point 
to evaluate the index lesions
oMerging lesions:
When two or more index lesions merge, the smaller lesion should 
have [ADDRESS_547991] diameter of the merged 
lesion recorded for the current assessment and be followed for future 
assessments.   
oSeparating lesions:
When anindex lesion splits into [ADDRESS_547992]:  A MG 820

CONFIDENTIA LIndex lesion response
oImmune -related Complete Response (irCR) –complete disappearance of all 
index lesions in two consecutive observations at least 4 weeks apart
Pathologic lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm 
oImmune -related Partial Response (irPR) –decrease of 30% or greater in 
tumor burden compared with baseline in two consecutive observations at 
least 4 weeks apart 
oImmune -related Stable Disease (irSD) -  not meeting the criteria for irCR or 
irPR, in the absence of immune -related progressive disease
oImmune -related Pr ogressive Disease (irPD) –at least a 2 0% increase in 
tumor burden compared with nadir (at any single time point) in two 
consecutive observations at least 4 weeks apart
oWhen the size of the tumor lesion is considered ‘too small to measure’ 
(eg,less than 5 mm), a default value of 5 mm should be assigned for index 
lesions.  If this is nadir, irPD will be judged from the tumor burden calculated 
using the default value.  
Non-Index Lesion Response
oirCR –complete disappearance of all non -index lesions.  
Patho logic lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm 
oirPR and irSD –non-Index lesions are not considered in the definition of irPR
or irSD.  Measurements of non -index lesions are not required, but they are 
evaluated at each timepoint as ‘present’, ‘absent’ or ‘unequivocal 
progression’.  If a significant partial response is observed in a non -index 
lesion, it should be described as a comment.
oirPD –increases in number or size of non- index lesion(s) does not constitute 
progressive disease.  New l esions that are measurable up to 5 new lesions 
per organ and 10 total ) are included in the calculation of tumor burden in 
response assessments
Overall response
oirCR –complete disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not, 
and no new lesions) 
Confirmation by a repeat, consec utive assessment no less than 
4weeks from the date of the first documented response
oirPR –decrease in tumor burden > 30% relative to baseline. 
Confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than
4weeks after the first documentation
oirSD –not meeting criteria for irCR or irPR, in the absence of irPD
oirPD –increase in tumor burden ≥ 20% relative to nadir (minimum recorded 
tumor burden) and at least 5 mm absolute increase compared to nadir .   
Confirmation by a repeat, consec utive assessment no less than 
4weeks from the date of the first documented assessment.

CONFIDENTIA LResponse confirmation:
irCR and irPR:
othe repeat confirmation scan may be performed any time after [ADDRESS_547993] suspected radiologic evidence of response and may be delayed until 
the next scheduled scan to avoid necessary procedures
irPD:
oIn subjects who have initial evidence of radiological PD by [CONTACT_90589] (irPD on 
one scan) , it is at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_193352] a subject on 
study treatment until repeat imaging is obtained based on their assessment of 
clinical stability.  Subjects may receive study treatment and tumor 
assessment should be repeated ≥ [ADDRESS_547994], the local site investigator should consider all index as well as 
any incremental new measureable lesion(s).
oirPD is confirmed at repeat imaging (irPD on t wo consecutive scans at least 
4 weeks apart) if tumor burden remains ≥ 20% and at least 5 mm absolute 
increase compared to nadir
oSubjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation 
of treatment without radiographic confirmation of disease progression
(confirme d irPD) at the time should have the reason for treatment 
discontinuation classified as ‘ clinical disease progression’.  In this case, irPD 
cannot be assigned at the time as the overall objective tumor response.  
Every effort should be made to radiographi cally confirm irPD even after 
discontinuation of treatment.

have disease progression on or after platinum -containing chemotherapy or 
FDA-approved therapy for EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations 
(Keytr uda®USPI, 2014).
Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG4 kappa immunoglobulin with
an approximate molecular weight of 149 kDa) that blocks the interaction between PD -1
and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2 (Keytruda®USPI, 2014). Consequently, the PD -[ADDRESS_548008]:  A MG 820

With: 
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal 
antibody  (mA b) with high specificity  of binding to the programmed cell death 1 
(PD-1) receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with programmed cell death ligand 1 
(PD-L1) and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD -L2).  Based on preclinical in vitro 
data, pembrolizumab has high affinity  and potent receptor blocking activity  for 
PD-1.  Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety  profile and is in clinical 
development as an intravenous (IV) immunotherapy  for advanced malignancies.  
Keytruda™ (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across a 
number of indications.  For more details on specific indications refer to the

Amendment Date:   03 October 2016 
Rationale:  
The following updates were made to the protocol dated 11 December 2015 to 
incorporate requested changes from EU VHP review:  
• Updated Safety Follow Up period from [ADDRESS_548029] study 
treatment throughout the protocol.  
• Added a Dose Rationale section for AMG 820 ( Section 2.2.4) and corresponding 
Table of Contents entry. 
• Clarified important identified risks, important potential risks, and referred to most 
current IB for AMG 820 in Risk Assessment Section 2.3. 
• Added new exclusion criterion to exclude subjects  with active infection within 
2 weeks prior to study enrollment. 
• Added new exclusion criterion to exclude subjects who have received systemic  
immunostimulatory agents within [ADDRESS_548030] dose of study treatment (except anti PD -1/PD -L1 treatment if 
recruited into Group 4a or 4b) . 
• Modi fied existing exclusion criteria to also exclude subjects with prior stem cell 
transplantation. 
• Modi fied existing exclusion criteria to also exclude subjects who have other 
signs or symptoms of clinical immune system suppression.  
• Part o f an existing exclusion criterion was updated to be a stand-alone criterion 
(previ ously part of Exclusion 205, the following is now Exclusion 206: receiving 
systemic immunosuppressive therapy (> 2 weeks) within [ADDRESS_548031] 
dose of study treatment, including oral steroid doses > 10 mg/day of prednisone 
or equivalent except for management of adverse events during the course of the 
study. Subjects that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injection will not be excluded from the study ). 
• Updated exclusion criteria to include only highly effective methods of birth 
control which are in accordance with CTFG’s recommendations (removed 
statements regarding barrier methods of contraception as being acceptable). 
• Updated exclusion criteria to define women and men of reproductive potential or 
childbearing potential , respectively.

any Grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia with bleeding, and Grade 4 or higher 
thrombocytopenia lasting >48 hours or any thrombocytopenia requiring intervention is  considered a DLT. 
• Updated Schedule of Assessments to require urine pregnancy test prior to each 
infusion for women of childbearing potential. 
• Updated Schedule of Assessments and relevant areas of protocol to require MRI of brain for subjects with NSCLC at screening.  
• Updated Reasons for Removal from Treatment to include “pregnancy” and “potential hepatotoxicity” (in accordance with section 6.4.1). 
• Removed reference not cited in protocol.  
• Corrected spelling and grammatical errors throughout protocol. 
• Table of Contents page numbers updated at page [ADDRESS_548032] addition of Section 2.2.4 AMG 820 Dose Rationale.

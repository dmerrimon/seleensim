Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) substudy: 
In the [LOCATION_002], a substudy employing Continuous Glucose 
Monitoring (CGM) technology will be performed to assess detailed glycemic profiles. The details of the CGM substudy procedures, 
endpoints and statistical analyses will be provided in a separate 
substudy protocol document. 
STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind (with 
single-blind Run-in Phase), place bo-controlled, parallel-group study. 
Patients with T2D will be included in this study if at Screening they have inadequate glycemic control (as demonstrated by a mean 
HbA1c ≥7.5% or HbA1c ≤10.5%), despi[INVESTIGATOR_799918] (at a 
total daily dose that has been stable within ± 20% of the dose at 
Screening for 8 weeks, inclusive). Patients may also be using up to

1500 mg/day or the maximum tolerated dose (documented). Patients 
who satisfy the entry criteria will be switched to Lantus®  (1:1 dose 
conversion from basal insulin being used at Screening). 
The trial will consist of 3 periods: 
• An up to 6-week Screening Period comprised of: 
- An up to 2-week Screening phase 
- A 4-week Lantus titration/single-blind placebo Run-in 
Phase. 
• A 52-week double-blind Treatment Period comprised of: 
- An initial 18-week fixed-dose phase during which 
Lantus dose is held constant except for safety reasons 
- Subsequent 34 weeks during which Lantus can be titrated. 
• A 2-week, post-treatment Follow-up Period. 
Screening Period 
Up to 2-week Screening phase (see Section  1.2) 
4-week Lantus titration/single-blind placebo Run-in Phase If the patient satisfies the entry criteria, their basal insulin will be 
converted to Lantus supplied by t he Sponsor (1:1 conversion based 
on units) and a 4-week Lantus opti mization phase will commence at 
Week -4 (Visit 2). 
Lantus titration:  The target range of fasting SMBG is 80-100 mg/dL 
(4.4-5.6 mmol/L). The titration will be based on SMBG readings 
performed before the first meal of the day for at least [ADDRESS_1103736] recent fasting SMBG values according to the following 
titration rule: 
• ≥140 mg/dL ( ≥7.8 mmol/L): increase Lantus by 4 units, or 
split to 2 x 2 units 
• ≥120 mg/dL ( ≥6.7 mmol/L) but <140 mg/dL (<7.8 mmol/L): 
increase Lantus by 2 units 
• >100 mg/dL (>5.6 mmol/L) but <120 mg/dL (<6.7 mmol/L): 
increase Lantus by 1 unit 
• 80-100 mg/dL (4.4-5.6 mmol/L), inclusive: no change in 
dose 
• <80 mg/dL (<4.4 mmol/L): decrease Lantus by 2 units. 
Lantus dose adjustment will occur every 3 days (twice a week). The dose adjustments will be made in consultation with the study site either at site visits, phone visits, or unscheduled phone contacts. In 
case of hypoglycemia, insulin titration may be withheld according to 
the Investigator’s medical judgment. 
During the 4-week Lantus titrat ion/single-blind placebo Run-in 
Phase, patients will also take sing le-blind placebo, given as two (2) 
placebo tablets (identical to sotagliflozin 200 mg in appearance), 
once daily before the first meal of the day. In order to qualify for randomization, patients must demonstrate compliance at the end of

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 6 the Run-in Phase, based upon tablet count ( ≥80%) and the 
Investigator’s discretion. 
Patients will not initiate any new antidiabetic medication. The 
pre-existing OAD should remain stable without any changes. 
Monitoring for serum ketones:  At Visit 2, patients will be provided 
meters and test strips for monitoring capi[INVESTIGATOR_799919]-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Patients will be instructed to measure 
their BHB levels by [CONTACT_799939]/ketoacidosis throughout the entire study 
period. Patients will be instructed on how to respond (seek help, 
hydrate, ingest carbohydrates, etc) if they present with possible 
ketoacidosis symptoms and the BHB value is abnormal (>0.6 mM/L). 
Randomized Core Treatment  Period: Weeks 0 to18  
Randomization:  To be randomized, patients must have HbA1c 
value ≥ 7% based on value obtained at Week -1 (Visit 5). 
Patients will be randomly assigned at a ratio of 2:1:1 respectively to 
one of 3 arms: 
• Sotagliflozin 400 mg, given as two (2) 200-mg tablets, once daily before the first meal of the day 
• Sotagliflozin 200 mg, given as one (1) 200-mg tablet and one (1) placebo tablet (identical to sotagliflozin 200 mg in 
appearance), once daily before the first meal of the day 
• Placebo, given as two (2) placebo tablets (identical to sotagliflozin 200 mg in appearance), once daily before the 
first meal of the day. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_716] 3 binary factors: HbA1c at Week -1 ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%) and SBP at Week -1 
(<130 mmHg, ≥ 130 mmHg), sulfonylureas use at Week -1 (yes, no). 
Administration of blinded investig ational medicinal product (IMP) 
begins at Randomization (Day 1). 
Lantus dose: The dose of Lantus should be held constant for the 
first 18 weeks unless glycemic rescue criteria are satisfied (see 
below). 
In addition, the doses of the two OADs (if applicable) should be held 
constant throughout the entire 52-week double-blind Treatment 
Period (ie, not changed except for safety reasons), and the dose of 
all antihypertensive medications s hould be held constant for the first 
12 weeks (until Visit 11) except for safety reasons. 
Hyperglycemic rescue:  For the first 18 weeks, the total daily insulin 
should remain stable (< ±10% from randomization dose, or 
<±4 units, whichever is less). Patients requiring glycemic rescue 
may initiate rescue therapy with prandial insulin, or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, or another antidiabetic medication 
(except sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 [SGLT2] inhibitors), 
according to the Investigator’s clinical judgment and in accordance 
with the treatment guidelines. Criteria for hyperglycemic rescue have 
been set for different phases of the study (see STUDY TREATMENTS, Rescue Therapy) and are consistent with accepted 
treatment goals for diabetic therapy.

will not be adjusted throughout the study. 
Weeks 19 to 52 Treatment Period Lantus Titration: Lantus titration resumes after Visit 12 (Week 18). 
During Weeks 19 to 52, SMBG values will be reviewed with site staff 
at site visits as well as extemporaneously if the patient calls site due to low or high SMBG readings. The same titration rule as described 
above (for the 4 week pre-Randomizat ion Lantus titration period) will 
be followed. The Lantus dose will be adjusted based on the mean of the [ADDRESS_1103737] recent fasting SMBG values according to the following 
titration rule: 
• ≥140 mg/dL ( ≥7.8 mmol/L): increase Lantus by 4 units, or 
split to 2 x 2 units 
• ≥120 mg/dL ( ≥6.7 mmol/L) but <140 mg/dL (<7.8 mmol/L): 
increase Lantus by 2 units, or split to 2 x 1 unit 
• >100 mg/dL (>5.6 mmol/L) but <120 mg/dL (<6.7 mmol/L): 
increase Lantus by 1 unit 
• 80-100 mg/dL (4.4-5.6 mmol/L), inclusive: no change in dose 
• <80 mg/dL (<4.4 mmol/L): decrease Lantus by 2 units. 
The doses of the two OADs (if ap plicable) should be held constant 
throughout the entire 52-week double-blind Treatment Period (ie, not changed except for safety reasons). 
In case of hypoglycemia, insulin titration may be withheld according 
to the Investigator’s medical judgment. 
Hyperglycemic rescue:  During Weeks [ADDRESS_1103738] approach. If up-titration of the Lantus 
regimen, based on the previously described titration rules, has been 
unsuccessful (ie, increase in basal insulin is associated with low 
FPG values despi[INVESTIGATOR_799920]1c or elevated post-prandial values), it 
is appropriate to initiate rescue therapy with prandial insulin, or a 
GLP-[ADDRESS_1103739], or another antidiabetic medication (except SGLT2 
inhibitors), according to the Inve stigator’s clinical judgment and in 
accordance with the treatment guidelines. 
Hyperglycemia rescue criteria: Rescue is defined by [CONTACT_799940] (see STUDY TREATMENTS, Rescue Therapy). 2-Week, Post-treatment Follow-up Visit Blood pressure (BP) and laboratory values will be assessed, and 
safety information including adverse events (AEs) will be collected
. 
The HbA1c and centrally measured FPG will be masked to study 
sites and patients after Randomization and until study end. 
Additionally, urinalysis by [CONTACT_799941].

 Placebo 
• Tablets identical in appearance to sotagliflozin 200 mg 
• Oral 
• Two (2) placebo tablets, once daily before the first meal of

Noninvestigational medicinal product(s) Lantus (insulin glargine, 100 U/mL) 
• Prefilled pen (3.0 mL solution) 
• Subcutaneous injection 
• Lantus to be provided by [CONTACT_799944]. Patients who are receiving any basal insulin other than Lantus before screening will switch to 
Lantus. For patients who are using long-acting insulin analogs other than Lantus (eg, Levemir, Tresiba, Basaglar), 
the existing basal insulin will be converted to an equivalent 
dose of Lantus on a 1:1 unit basis (ie, the same dose on the 
day before Visit 2). If the patient is using Toujeo ® (glargine 
U-300/mL), the initial Lantus dose is 80% of the existing 
Toujeo dose as recommended in the Lantus label. If the 
patient is using NPH twice daily, it’s recommended that the 
converted Lantus dose should be reduced by 20% and given once daily. If using NPH once a day, it can be converted to 
Lantus unit-to-unit. 
• Metformin (optional) tablets to be administered as per Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_799921]  
• Other OADs (up to 2 in total, including metformin) to be administered as per Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_799921], with the exception of SGLT2 inhibitors. 
 Rescue Therapy 
The threshold values for resc ue are defined as follows, depending 
on study period: 
• From Baseline Visit (Visit 6, Day 1) to Visit 10 (Week 8) 
(including value at Visit 10): FPG >270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) 
• From Visit 10 (Week 8) to Visit 11 (Week 12) (including value at Visit 11): FPG >240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) 
• From Visit 11 (Week 12) up to Visit 12 (Week 18): FPG >200 
mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c ≥8.5% (the 8.5% criteria 
does not apply if the HbA1c decrease from Baseline was ≥1.5%) 
• From Visit 12 (Week 18) up to the EOT, Visit 15 (Week 52): FPG >170 mg/dL (9.4 mmol/L) or HbA1c ≥8.0% (the 8.0% 
criteria does not apply if the HbA1c decrease from Baseline was ≥1.5%).  
Routine fasting SMBG and central laboratory alerts on FPG (and HbA1c at Week 12 and onwards) are set up to ensure that glycemic parameter results remain within predefined thresholds.

ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE See Section  1.2 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Sample size determination: The sample size/power calculations were performed based on the 
primary endpoint. Assuming a common standard deviation (SD) of 
1.2% and using a 2-sided test at a 0.[ADDRESS_1103746] 95% power to detect a treatment difference of 0.5% 
in mean HbA1c change from Baseline to Week 18 between 
sotagliflozin 400 mg and placebo. 
A sample size of 140 patients in the sotagliflozin 200 mg arm and 
140 patients in the placebo arm will provide 80% power to detect a 
treatment difference of 0.4% in mean HbA1c change from Baseline 
to Week 18 between sotagliflozin 200 mg and placebo (SD 1.2%; 5% 
significance level 2-sided).

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 13 The total sample size will be 560 patients to be randomized 
(280 patients in the sotagliflozin 400 mg arm; 140 patients in the 
sotagliflozin 200 mg arm; 140 patients in the placebo arm). 
Analysis population: 
Efficacy analyses will be based on the intention to treat (ITT) 
population, defined as all randomiz ed patients irrespective of 
compliance with the study protocol and procedures. Patients will be 
analyzed according to the treatment group to which they are 
randomized. 
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint: 
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (change from Baseline to 
Week 18 in HbA1c) will be perform ed using the ITT population, using 
HbA1c measurements obtained during the study, including those obtained after IMP discontinuation or introduction of rescue therapy. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of c hange in HbA1c from Baseline to 
Week 18 will be analyzed with missing values imputed by 
[CONTACT_268139]-based multiple imputation method under the missing not at 
random framework. 
• For placebo patients, missing data will be imputed based on the placebo group data 
• For patients in the sotagliflozin groups, missing data will be imputed as if the patients were on placebo group throughout 
the study, where all patients’ measurements including the 
on-treatment measurements will be considered as if the 
measurements were from the placebo group in the 
imputation model. 
Each of the complete datasets will be analyzed by [CONTACT_234519] (ANCOVA) model with treatment groups (sotagliflozin 
400 mg, sotagliflozin 200 mg, placebo), randomization strata of Week -1 HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%), randomization strata of Week -1 
SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥ 130 mmHg), randomization strata of 
sulfonylureas use at Week -1 (yes, no), and country as fixed effects, 
and Baseline HbA1c value as a covariate. Results from each 
complete dataset will be combined to provide the adjusted mean change in HbA1c from Baseline to Week 18 for the sotagliflozin 
400 mg arm and placebo arm, as well as the between-group 
difference (comparing sotagliflozin 400 mg arm versus placebo) and 
the 95% confidence interval (CI) using contrast statements. 
Summary statistics (for Screening value, Baseline value, observed 
values, and observed changes from Baseline) at scheduled visits will 
be provided for each treatment group. The summary will include the number of observations, mean, SD, standard error (SE), minimum, 
median, and maximum. Graphical presentations will also be used to 
examine trends over time us ing mean values (±SE) and mean 
changes from Baseline (±SE) at eac h of the scheduled visits (using 
observed cases [OC]). 
Baseline definition: 
The Baseline value is defined generally as the last available value 
before the first dose of double-blind IMP or the last available value

exposed to IMP. 
Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints: 
The secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a similar approach 
to the primary efficacy endpoint, with missing values imputed by [CONTACT_400297]-based multiple imputation method under the missing not at random framework. For each of the continuous secondary endpoints, 
each of the complete datasets will be analyzed by [CONTACT_799945] (sotagliflozin 400 mg, sotagliflozin 
200 mg, placebo), randomization strata of Week -1 HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, 
>8.5%), randomization strata of Week -1 SBP (<130 mmHg, 
≥130 mmHg), randomization strata of sulfonylureas use at Week -1 
(yes, no), and country as fixed effects, and Baseline secondary endpoint value as a covariate. Results from each complete dataset 
will be combined to provide the adjusted mean change from Baseline 
to Week 18 (Week 12 for SBP endpoi nts) for each treatment group, 
as well as the between-group difference (comparing each sotagliflozin group versus placebo) and the 95% CI using contrast statements. For HbA1c endpoint, results from each complete dataset 
will be combined to provide the adjusted mean change from Baseline 
to Week 18 for sotagliflozin 200 mg arm and placebo arm, as well as 
the between-group difference (comparing the sotagliflozin 200 mg 
arm versus placebo arm) and the 95% CI using contrast statements. 
The categorical secondary efficacy variables of HbA1c <6.5% or 
<7% at Week 18 will be analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
method stratified by [CONTACT_799946] -1 HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, 
>8.5%), randomization strata of Week -1 SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg), and randomization strata of sulfonylureas use at 
Week -1 (yes, no). For the HbA1c <7% or <6.5% analysis, patients with missing HbA1c data at Week 18 will be considered non-responders in the ITT population. 
Summary statistics for the secondary endpoints at scheduled visits 
will be provided for each treatment group. 
Analysis of other efficacy endpoints:  
Except for patient reported outcome (PRO) endpoints, the analysis 
of other endpoints will be descriptive with no formal testing. 
Summary statistics at scheduled visits using OC will be provided by 
[CONTACT_81591]. Graphical presentations will also be used to illustrate trends over time. 
For TRIM-D scores (total and domain scores), descriptive statistics 
will be presented by [CONTACT_799947]. The change from 
Baseline to endpoint will be analyzed using a similar approach as the primary efficacy endpoint with missing values imputed by 
[CONTACT_268139]-based multiple imputation method under the missing not at 
random framework. 
Analysis of Safety Data:  
All safety summaries will be descriptive; no statistical significance 
tests will be performed on safety data. These analyses will be based on the safety population, which is defined as all randomized patients 
who receive at least 1 dose of double-blind IMP, regardless of the

from Weeks 19 to 52 ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). Patients will review SMBG values with site staff either at site visits, phone vi sits or extemporaneously  if patient feels hi gh or low SMBG values may necessitate a dose 
adjustment. See Table 2  for permitted adjustments. Patients should be advised to check SMBG whenever they experience any symptoms of hypoglycemia, if possible, before taking the treatment. Note:  Units in 
table represent plasma glucose values as glucometers used for SMBG display results already adjusted to plasma concentration and  no conversion is required.

4.1 BACKGROUND: SOTAGLIFLOZIN AND DISEASE 
Sotagliflozin is a dual inhibitor of the sodium -glucose cotransporters (SGLT) type 1 and 2 
(SGLT1 and SGLT2). Sotagliflozi n is being developed for use in type 2 diabetes (T2D), a 
metabolic disorder characterized by [CONTACT_400301] a combination of increased 
insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction ( 1). The microvascular complications of diabetes are 
well known and can result in impai red renal function, retinopathy, and neuropathy, while results 
of macrovascular complications are coronary artery disease, peripheral arteri al disease, and stroke 
(2). Other comorbidities that are frequently associat ed with diabetes are hypertension, obesity, and 
cardiovascular (CV) disease. According to the most recent International Diabetes Federation Diabetes Atlas, it was estimated in [ADDRESS_1103763] diabetes, equivalent to 
415 million people, which is estimated to rise to 642 million adults by 2040 ( 3). 
According to the World Health Organization, th ere are about 60 million people with diabetes in 
the European Region, or about 10.3% of men a nd 9.6% of women aged 25 years and over ( 4). 
While these numbers include both people with T2 D and type 1 diabetes (T1D), over 90% of 
adults with diabetes have T2D. Diabetes is among the leading causes of death by [CONTACT_234485] a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, and amputation ( 3, 4). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_400273], none of the current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_400274]. 
Although lifestyle changes, including diet, exer cise, and education, are valuable components of 
diabetes treatment, the vast majority of people with T2D must receive pharmacological therapy to 
control the disease. In the [LOCATION_002] (US) and Europe, metformin is the standard first-line 
therapy in the absence of any contraindications or tolerability issues, as per guidance from the American Diabetes Association ( 5). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_400275], monotherapy fails in many patients as beta cell 
function continues to deteriorate leading to pr ogressively increasing hyperglycemia. Aggressive 
glycemic control with the currently available agents often leads to side effects, most notably weight gain and an increased fr equency of hypoglycemia. These concerns emphasize the need to 
develop new agents that effectively and sa fely lower glucose in diabetic patients ( 6). 
In patients with diabetes, it is desirable to ma intain blood glucose in the normal range without 
exhausting the ability of the pancreatic beta-cells to produce insulin. Glucose is transported across the cell membrane by 2 different types of glucose transporters: glucose-faci litated transporters and 
SGLT proteins ( 7). In the kidney, after blood is filtered by [CONTACT_638182], glucose passes into the 
urine, but 99% is reabsorbed, primarily via SG LT2, which is responsible for 90% of glucose 
reabsorption, while 10% is reabsorbed by [CONTACT_23265]1.  When functional SGLT2 is lacking in humans, 
a significant amount of glucose remains in  the urine and is removed from the body ( 8). This way 
of reducing blood glucose is an insulin-independe nt mechanism and therefore hyperglycemia may 
be reduced while the pancreas is spared from an increased demand for insulin production that is

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 32 caused by [CONTACT_157710]. Since obesity is a significant comorbidity in T2D, and insulin 
resistance is increased in obesity, the caloric loss from glucose in the urine may represent an additional benefit resulting in decreased weight, which should result in decreased insulin 
resistance ( 8). 
SGLT1 is expressed predominantly in the gastroin testinal (GI) tract and is responsible for the 
majority of glucose absorption by [CONTACT_343655] ( 9). Inhibition of SGLT1 in the GI tract 
delays glucose absorption and lowers peak postprandial glucose levels ( 8). Additionally, there is 
accumulating evidence that SGLT1 inhibition stimu lates secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 
(GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY), gut hormones invo lved in pancreatic beta cell function and 
appetite control, respectively. Reduced glucose absorption in the proximal intestine leads to more glucose being delivered distally, which allows L cells in both the ileum and the colon to sense 
glucose and its by[CONTACT_799949], as a result, they secrete GLP-1 and PYY. Although a complete lack of functional SGLT1 may be associated with symptoms of glucose and galactose malabsorption ( 10), pharmacologic inhibition of SGLT1 by [CONTACT_400302] T2 D. Selective inhibitors of the SGLT1 transporter 
are in early stages of development. 
Extensive clinical studies conducte d for selective SGLT2 inhibitors have established this class as 
effective agents for the treatment of T2D (6, 11) and have led to approvals by [CONTACT_3361] (FDA) and the European Me dicines Agency. Studies with sotagliflozin, a 
dual inhibitor of SGLT1 and SGLT2, have shown th at this agent produces significant glucosuria 
in preclinical animal models, healthy human vol unteers, and patients with T2D. Single- and 
multiple-dose administration of sotagliflozin to healthy human patients has resulted in dose-dependent increases in glucosuria. Multiple-dose (28-day) administration in diabetic patients produced improvements in severa l metabolic parameters, includi ng urinary glucose excretion, 
fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), GLP-1, and PYY ( 12). These data 
suggest that sotagliflozin should be of th erapeutic benefit to patients with T2D. 
4.2 CLINICAL TRIALS OF SOTAGLIFLOZIN IN HUMANS 
Approximately 840 subjects (698 assigned to so tagliflozin and 229 assigned to placebo) have 
participated in completed clinical studies of sotagliflozin. No significant safety concerns have 
been identified in the sotagliflozin drug program, and sotagliflozin has been well-tolerated in all 
studies to date. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) 
have been infrequent and have been balanced between treatment and co mparator groups. Reports 
of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) across all sotagliflozin studies for which data are available were generally balanced between treatme nt and comparator groups. The most frequently 
reported TEAEs ( ≥2.0%) were headache, nausea, diarrhea , constipation, dizziness, and upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], all of which were  reported at a frequency greater than placebo. 
However, the majority were described as mild to moderate, and most reso lved spontaneously and 
without discontinuation of the study drug. 
In completed and ongoing clinical trials, no additi onal safety issues beside those already described 
in the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) ha ve been observed. In general, no significant 
imbalances of SAEs/AEs between sotagliflozin and comparators were observed in completed

EFC14868 - sotagliflozin Version number: [ADDRESS_1103764] udies, 8 SAEs were re ported in 6 patients 
(4 patients with T2D and 2 with T1D), all of wh ich were assessed as unr elated to study drug; 
those reported in [ADDRESS_1103765] stone, cholangitis and lower limb fracture, while a patient 
receiving placebo had a myocardial infarction (M I). Two SAEs of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) 
were reported in 2 patients with T1D in the ongoing (blinded) Phase 2 T1D study (LX4211.1-203-
TIDM) using insulin pumps; in each case basal insu lin was within 7% of Baseline, and both SAEs 
were assessed as due to failure of insulin delivery via insulin pump. Both cases were associated 
with high blood glucose readings >300 mg/dL, a finding expected in DKA and notable in that this 
value did not appear to be mask ed by [CONTACT_799950]. 
A drug interaction study with digoxin, a sensitive P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, indicated that sotagliflozin acts as a weak P-gp inhibitor. T hus, sotagliflozin increases systemic exposure of 
digoxin and could also increase the exposure of ot her P-gp substrates. Patients taking sotagliflozin 
with concomitant digoxin should have digoxin co ncentrations monitored and doses reduced as 
needed. In addition, other P-gp substrates may be affected and the labels of P-gp substrate drugs 
should be consulted with regards to monitoring and dose adjustments. 
Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic effects of sotagliflozin are 
supported by [CONTACT_7609] 1 and Phase 2 studies and animal  toxicology data in rats up to 26 weeks and 
dogs up to 39 weeks as well as 2-year carcinogenicity data in rats.  
More information on the safety of sotagliflozin and on the clinical program can be found in the 
IB. 
4.3 RATIONALE FOR SELECTION OF DOSE 
Both the 200 mg and 400 mg doses are being developed in the Phase 3 program for sotagliflozin for the treatment of T2D. These doses are being tested in several Phase 3 trials, including the 
current trial in patients with T2D and inadequate glycemic control. 
The proposed sotagliflozin 200 mg and 400 mg once daily doses are based on the results of the 
Phase 2b study LX4211.1-202-DM. In this study sotagliflozin doses of 75 mg once daily, 200 mg once daily, 200 mg twice daily, and 400 mg once daily were tested over a 12-week, double-blind 
period. The sotagliflozin 200 mg and 400 mg once daily doses were chosen for further evaluation 
based on their HbA1c lowering effects and the overall safety and tolerability observed at these 
doses. At 12 weeks, the 200 mg and 400 mg once daily doses lowered HbA1c by a mean of 0.52% and 0.93%, respectively (p <0.001 for both arms), while placebo lowered HbA1c by a mean of 
0.14%. Sotagliflozin also produced statistically significant reductions in body weight (BW) 
(200 mg and 400 mg doses) and systolic  blood pressure (SBP) (400 mg dose). 
The overall incidences of AEs on sotagliflozin 200 mg and 400 mg once daily doses were similar 
to placebo.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 34 From a safety perspective, sotagliflozin was we ll-tolerated across studies. In healthy subjects, 
sotagliflozin was well-tolerated following single doses up to  2000 mg, and in multiple doses up to 
800 mg over 10 days. Furthermore, in a thorough QT  study, single doses of sotagliflozin (800 mg 
and 2000 mg) were well-tolerated a nd did not prolong the QT interval. Additionally, evaluation of 
metabolites in urine and plasma of healthy subjects resulted in no safety concerns following single 
doses of 400 mg sotagliflozin. In patients with T2D, single doses of 400 mg in combination with sitagliptin, and multiple doses up to 400 mg in combination with metformin over 12 weeks were 
also well-tolerated. 
4.4 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN AND CONTROL GROUPS 
This study is designed to assess the efficacy a nd safety of sotagliflozi n (compared to placebo) 
when used as add-on therapy to basal insulin (Lantus), alone or in combination with oral antidiabetes drugs (OADs). Patients will be switched from their current basal insulin to Lantus (1:1 dose conversion, or 20% reduction if on tr eatment with Toujeo or Neutral Protamine 
Hagedorn [NPH] twice daily) and will have a 4-week dose titration period to improve their basal insulin dose prior to Randomization, utilizing a st andard titration algorith m. During this period, 
compliance with the algorithm will be reviewed by [CONTACT_799951]. During this Lantus titration peri od, the dose of concomitant OADs should stay 
unchanged, except if decreases are needed due to hypoglycemia. 
The primary endpoint is HbA1c reduction from Base line to Week [ADDRESS_1103766] 18 weeks no adjustment of Lantus is 
permitted (except for safety reasons or if rescue criteria are met) to enable the assessment of the 
effect of randomized treatment drug on top of  a stable background therapy of insulin ±OADs. 
After Week 18, titration of Lantus may resume following the same titration algorithm utilized 
during the Run-in period. This will enable the assessment of the effect of the randomized study drug in a context of total dose of insulin bein g simultaneously adjusted and more typi[INVESTIGATOR_12340] a 
real-world setting. Prandial insulin or GLP-1 agonists will be the recommended rescue therapy for patients on a stable regimen of oral antihypergl ycemic agents who cannot adequately achieve 
glycemic control by [CONTACT_25764]-titrating their Lantus dose, as per international diabetes treatment 
guidelines ( 13, 14). However, the investigator will be allowed to choose from any antidiabetic 
agent (with the exception of the SGLT2 inhibitors class) according to their clinical judgment and in line with the local standard of care. The prot ocol stipulates that pa tients be provided rescue 
therapy according to increasingly stringent hyperglycemia criteria (based on FPG and/or HbA1c) as aligned with regulatory guidance ( 15). 
Randomization will be stratified based on HbA1c at Week -1 ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%), SBP at Week -1 
(<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg), and use of sulfonylureas at Week -1 (yes, no), to achieve balanced 
randomization for assessment of the primary and main secondary study endpoints.

data. Bias will be minimized by [CONTACT_400307], blinding the 
patients, the Investigators, and the Sponsor to the treatment allocations, and by [CONTACT_400308] a blinded fashion. 
Two Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) will be assessed in this trial. The Patient Qualitative 
Assessment of Treatment (PQAT) will be assessed at Week 18 and at the final on-treatment visit (Week 52). This instrument includes a 7-point Like rt Scale for the patient  to evaluate his/her 
subjective response to the treatment (-3 to +3 in cluding 0 for a neutral response) and [ADDRESS_1103767] 
Measure – Diabetes (TRIM-D) includes questions  related to satisfaction with weight and 
hypoglycemia; it will be assessed at Screening, at Baseline (after the Lantus titration phase), and at several visits durin g the Treatment Period. 
A continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) substudy is planned to include a subset of patients. This 
study will allow assessing the impact of sotagliflozin on additional parameters of glucose control 
and variability over 24 hours which cannot be inferre d by [CONTACT_755331]1c as an aggregate measure of 
overall glycemic control. The details of the CGM substudy are specified in the separate substudy 
protocol. 
4.5 BENEFIT/RISK OF SOTAGLIFLOZIN 
Sotagliflozin is currently being investigated as  an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve 
glycemic control in adults with T2D. The development program will also provide efficacy and safety data for sotagliflozin in combination with other antidiabetes medications. In addition, the program will evaluate clinical outcomes in patients with high CV risk and in patients with renal impairment. The use of sotagliflozin in the treatme nt of T1D is also being studied in a separate 
development program. 
Sotagliflozin may benefit a wide variety of diabetic patients based on multiple potential beneficial 
effects of dual SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibition, and its insulin-independent mechanism of action. 
Improvements in HbA1c, FPG, and postprandial glucose were observed with sotagliflozin in 
multiple studies. As anticipated from the mechan ism of action, treatment  with sotagliflozin 
resulted in increased urinary glucose excretion (fr om inhibition of SGLT2) as well as increased 
levels of the intestinal peptides GLP-1 and PYY (from inhibition of SGLT1). In addition, the 
improvements in BW and blood pressure (BP) observed with sota gliflozin treatment have the 
potential to benefit patients with diabetes through their effects on common diabetic comorbidities. 
Phase 2 data indicated that sotagliflozin may reduce SBP by 10 to 15 mmHg in patients with SBP 
≥[ADDRESS_1103768] in patients w ith SBP <[ADDRESS_1103769] and consequently reduce the insulin requi rements of patients mana ged with basal insulin. 
This outcome can result in a clinical benefit in patients on insulin therapy by [CONTACT_799952]

increased rate of genital infections, which are usually mild and well tolerated in clinical trials. 
Overall, sotagliflozin has been well-tolerated in all studies to date, with the majority of events assessed as mild to moderate; most of which resolved spontaneously. Serious AEs and 
discontinuations due to AEs have been limited and balanced between treatment and comparator groups. 
Events of special interest (EOSI) are evaluated based on either their potential link to the drug’s 
mechanism of action, events that occur in other SGLT-inhibitor drugs, or regulatory 
interest/guidance for diabetes products, but found not  to be in imbalance in clinical trials. In 
addition to the identified and potential risks (genital mycotic infections [male and female], metabolic acidosis, DKA, urinary tr act infections [UTIs], volume de pletion, severe hypoglycemia) 
for the sotagliflozin program, other EOSI have been defined. These EOSI are: major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and other CV events, venous thrombotic events (VTEs), drug-induced liver injuries (DILIs)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase  >3 times the upper limit of normal 
(ULN), diarrhea, pancreatitis, bone fractures, re nal events, malignancies of special interest 
(including but not limited to: breast, bladder, renal cell, Leydig cell, pancreatic, prostate and thyroid cancer), and AEs leading to amputation. 
However, reports of these events have been in frequent and have responded to standard treatment. 
The improvement in glycemic control, the reductions in weight and BP, and the tolerability and 
safety profile of sotagliflozi n to date demonstrate a favorab le benefit-risk assessment for 
sotagliflozin.

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY 
This study is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized , double-blind (with single-blind Run-in Phase), 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study that is an ticipated to enroll appr oximately [ADDRESS_1103772] of 3 periods: 1) an up to 6-week Screening Period comprised of a Screening 
phase of up to 2 weeks and a 4-week Lantus titrat ion/single-blind placebo titration Run-in Phase; 
2) a 52-week double-blind Treatment Period; a nd 3) a 2-week, post-tr eatment Follow-up Period. 
The study design is presented graphically in Section 1.1. 
In the [LOCATION_002], a substudy employing CGM technology will be perform ed to assess detailed 
glycemic profiles. The details of  the CGM substudy procedures, endpoints and statistical analyses 
will be provided in a separate substudy protocol. 
6.1.1 Screening period 
[IP_ADDRESS] Screening phase (Visit 1) 
The Screening phase will last up to [ADDRESS_1103773] the data 
required to establish whether the patient sa tisfies the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Patients with T2D ( 16) will be included in this study if at Screening they have inadequate 
glycemic control (as demonstrated by a mean HbA1c ≥7.5% or HbA1c ≤ 10.5%), despi[INVESTIGATOR_799923] (at a total daily dose that has been stable within ±20% of the dose at Screening for 
8 weeks inclusive). Patients may also be using up to any [ADDRESS_1103774] 1500 mg/day or the maximum tolerated dose (documented). 
At the Screening Visit after signing of the informed consent form (ICF), eligibility criteria will be assessed, and Screening assessments will be performed. Women of childbearing potential 
(WOCBP) not willing to use highly effectiv e contraceptive method(s), and/or who are 
unwilling or unable to be tested for pregnancy during the study will be excluded; guidance on 
highly effective contraceptive methods and colle ction of pregnancy information is provided in 
Appendix A . If another contraceptive method is used (s uch as a barrier method), it should be used 
in combination with one of the highly effective methods described in Appendix A  (such as an oral 
contraceptive). 
The interactive response technology (IRT; eith er Interactive Voice Response System or 
Interactive Web Response System) will be contact[CONTACT_400310] 1 for notification of Screening and

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 40 [IP_ADDRESS] Run-in phase (Visits 2 to 5) 
The Lantus titration/single-blind placebo Run-in Phas e will last 4 weeks. If the patient satisfies 
the entry criteria during the Screening phase, the basal insulin that the patient is currently taking 
will be replaced by [CONTACT_799953] (Section  8.2.1) provided by [CONTACT_1034]. A 4-week Lantus 
optimization phase will commence. 
During the 4-week Lantus titration/single-blind placebo Run-in Phase, patients will also take 
single-blind placebo (2 tablets, identical to sota gliflozin 200 mg in appearance) once daily before 
the first meal of the day, starting from Visit 2. 
6.1.2 Double-blind Treatment Period (Day 1 to Week 52) 
Eligible patients will be randomized on Day 1 (V isit 6). In order to qualify for randomization, 
patients must have an HbA1c value ≥7.0% at Week -1 (Visit 5) and must demonstrate compliance 
at the end of the single-blind placebo Run-in Phase based upon tablet count ( ≥80%), and as 
assessed at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Randomization will be stratified by: 
• HbA1c at Week -1 ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%) 
• SBP at Week -1 (<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg) 
• Sulfonylureas use at Week -1 (yes, no). 
Following randomization, patients will be treated in a double-blind manner for 52 weeks. A total 
of 560 patients ≥18 years of age (or ≥ legal age of majority if greater) will be randomly assigned 
2:1:1 to the following 3 treatment groups: 
• Sotagliflozin 400 mg, given as two (2) 200-mg ta blets, once daily before the first meal of 
the day (N = 280 patients) 
• Sotagliflozin 200 mg, given as one (1) 200-mg ta blet and one (1) place bo tablet (identical 
to sotagliflozin 200 mg in appearance), onc e daily before the first meal of the day 
(N = 140 patients) 
• Placebo, given as two (2) placebo tablets (identic al to sotagliflozin 200 mg in appearance), 
once daily before the first meal of the day (N = 140 patients). 
The doses of the OADs (if applicable) should be  held constant throughout the entire 52-week 
double-blind Treatment Period (ie, not changed ex cept for safety reasons), and the dose of all 
antihypertensive medications should be held consta nt for the first 12 weeks (until Visit 11) except 
for safety reasons. The dose of Lantus should be held constant for the first 18 weeks unless gl ycemic rescue criteria 
are satisfied (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). Insulin titration resumes after Visit 12.

a regular basis, and will be responsible for: 
• Review of accumulating clinical trial safety data by [CONTACT_3148] 
• Making a recommendation to the Sponsor rega rding the study following each meeting. 
Safety data to be reviewed w ill include events and outcomes desc ribed below for adjudication, as 
well as any additional safety data considered re levant. Details describing  the DMC processes and 
procedures are outlined in a separate DMC Charte r. To maintain continuous blinding and study 
integrity, the analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_1629] i ndependent statistic ian, and measures will be taken 
to ensure the validity of the data. 
6.3.3 Clinical endpoint committee(s) 
The Clinical Endpoint Committees (CECs) is/are comprised of experts in cardiology and 
nephrology (and other appropriate medical specia lties such as neurology and endocrinology as 
needed) who are independent of the Sponsor and the contract research organization (CRO). The 
CEC(s) will review and adjudicate all deaths, MACE/selected CV events (MI, stroke, unstable 
angina leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and heart failu re leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), selected renal 
events, bone fracture, and DKA. 
The details regarding the CEC processes and procedures will be outlined in the CEC Charter(s). 
6.3.4 Safety adjudication of events requiring ongoing monitoring 
Two independent committees will review safety events that require ongoing monitoring to ensure 
timing protocol amendments in case a safety signal is identified. These events are: 1) potential cases of DILI, and 2) cases of amputations.  
The 2 committees will review the cases in a treatment-blinded manner and will present their 
assessment to the DMC. 
The members, roles and responsibilities of the tw o committees will be desc ribed in a separate 
Charter.

80 units is required, it may be given as two or mo re consecutive subcutaneous injections at the 
same dosing time with daily dose split in equal or close to equal doses. Patients who are receiving NPH (or any other basal insulin) twice daily prior to Screening should administer Lantus once a day either in the morning or evening, following the Investigator’s advice since the beginning of 
Run-In. However, once the NIMP Lantus starts, the patients should not change the injection time during the study course. Lantus should be given at the same time daily within a ±1 hour window, 
which should be maintained for the duration of the study. 
Lantus should be administered by [CONTACT_495540], alternatin g between the left and 
right anterolateral and left and right posterolateral abdominal wall or thighs or upper arms. Within 
a given area, location should be changed (rotated)  at each time to prevent injection site skin 
reactions. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Starting dose 
From Visit 2 (start of the single-blind Run-in period) all patients will receive Lantus as basal 
insulin. Patients who are already receiving Lantus prior to the study will start Run-in (Visit 2) at their pre-study dose level.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 49 Patients who are receiving any basal insulin othe r than Lantus before Screening will switch to 
Lantus once a day. For patients who are using long-acting insulin analogs other than Lantus (eg, 
Levemir, Tresiba, Basaglar) the existing basal insu lin will be converted to an equivalent dose of 
Lantus on a 1:1 unit basis (ie, the same dose on th e day before Visit 2). If the patient is using 
Toujeo (glargine U-300/mL), the initial Lantus dose is 80% of the existing Toujeo dose as recommended in the Lantus label. If the patient is using NPH twice daily, it’s recommended that the converted Lantus dose should be reduced by 20% and given once daily. (If using NPH once a 
day, it can be converted to Lantus unit-to-unit.) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose titration and modification 
Lantus will be titrated during the 4-week sing le-blind Run-in Phase and if necessary after 
18 weeks of the core Treatment Period to reac h and maintain the target fasting glucose. 
The target range for fasting (pre-breakfast/p re-injection if available) blood glucose is 
80-100 mg/dL (4.4 to 5.6 mmol/L) avoiding hypoglycemia. 
During Run-in (Week -4 to Week -1) : after initiating the study pr ovided basal insulin, Lantus, 
the insulin dose will be up-titrated every 3 days (twice per week) until the patient reaches the 
target fasting blood glucose according to the recommended regimen ( Table 2). The dose 
adjustments will be made in consultation with the study site eith er at site visits, phone visits, or 
unscheduled phone contacts. At the e nd of Run-in, patients with HbA1c ≥ 7.0% measured at 
Visit 5 (Week -1) are eligible to be randomized to receive the IMP treatment (sotagliflozin 
200 mg, sotagliflozin 400 mg or placebo) on top of Lantus.  
During the randomized core Treatment Period (Weeks 0 to 18) : no insulin titration should be 
implemented.  For patients with HbA1c <7.5% measured at Week -1, a 10% reduction in the Lantus dose at the 
randomization may be considered by [CONTACT_799954], to reduce a potential risk of 
hypoglycemia. Lantus daily dose will remain stable (< ±10% from the dose at randomization, or < ±4 units, 
whichever is less) unless it is deemed necessary by [CONTACT_799955] (ie, severe hypoglycemia or AE/SAE) or the patient has met the hyperglycemic 
threshold for rescue therapy. In such a case, rescue assessment will apply and be implemented 
(Section 8.2.4). Increase and optimization in Lantus dose will be the first step of rescue therapy 
prior to initiation of prandial insulin or GLP-1 receptor agonists. 
After the core Treatment Period (Weeks 19 to 52) : if the target fasting SMBG level is not 
achieved at the end of Week 18, insulin dose shoul d be continuously up-titrated to maintain the 
fasting SMBG in the target range until the EOT. Titration will be done on a weekly basis, or as 
frequently as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_737]. Lantus dose adjustment is based on fasting SMBG values using study glucose meter that displays 
results already converted to plasma glucose concentration. Regular self-monitoring of plasma glucose is very important in order to achieve the blood glucose targets. It is recommended to

SMBG = self-monitored blood glucose 
In addition: 
1. Lantus dose titration may be withheld for a week or reduced in a patient who experiences 
two or more epi[INVESTIGATOR_179260] (with symptoms of hypoglycemia and an SMBG reading ≤70 mg/dL [ ≤3.9 mmol/L]) or one epi[INVESTIGATOR_66677] 
(patient required assistance from others to treat the hypoglycemic event; see  Section 10.6.1). 
2. In both Run-in phase or post-Week 18 Treatment Phase, Investigators are allowed to 
modulate or stop titration or te mporarily reduce dosage if th ey believe further titration 
would be hazardous to the patient (eg, due to  age, comorbid conditions, individual patient 
considerations, other than hypoglycemia). In such a case the reason for the exceptions 
should be recorded in the source document. 
Good clinical judgment is to be exercised while titrating the insulin dose. For example, when implementing the weekly Lantus titration dose, a dose increase could be split into two incremental increases over the course of the week, rather than implementing the entire dose increase at one time, if it was concluded by [CONTACT_799956]. 
Patients will be familiarized with the titration schedule so that they would be able to monitor the 
titration with the assistance of the investigator or medically qualified designee. All dose 
adjustments must be discu ssed between the patient and appropriate s ite personnel. 
Patients who experienced mild to moderate hypoglycemia as a result of a missed meal, unusual 
exercise, or alcohol use will be counseled on the correction of those behaviors and may not need 
to have their insulin dose decreased.

8.2.4 Rescue therapy 
If a patient needs to receive rescue antidia betes medication, assessment of HbA1c should be 
performed before the introducti on of the rescue medication. 
The threshold values for FPG and HbA1c are de fined as follows, depending on study period: 
• From Baseline Visit (Visit 6, Day 1) to Visit 10 (Week 8) (including value at Visit 10): 
FPG >270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) 
• From Visit 10 (Week 8) to Visit 11 (Week 12) (including value at Visit 11): FPG 
>240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) 
• From Visit 11 (Week 12) up to Visit 12 (Week 18): FPG >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c ≥8.5% (the 8.5% criteria does not apply if the HbA1c decrease from Baseline was 
≥1.5%) 
• From Visit 12 (Week 18) up to the EOT Period Visit 15 (Week 52): FPG >170 mg/dL (9.4 mmol/L) or HbA1c ≥8.0% (the 8.0% criteria does not apply if the HbA1c decrease 
from Baseline was ≥ 1.5%). 
Routine fasting SMBG and central laboratory  alerts on FPG (and HbA1c at Week 12 and 
onwards) are set up to ensure that glycemic parameter results remain within predefined thresholds. 
• If one fasting SMBG value exceeds the specific glycemic limit on one day, the patient will 
check again during the two following days. If all the values in [ADDRESS_1103787] th e Investigator and a central laboratory FPG 
measurement (and HbA1c at Week 12 and onwards) will be performed as soon as 
possible, preferably within 7 da ys, to confirm the hyperglycemia. 
• Likewise, upon receipt of a central laboratory rescue alert, a central laboratory re-test 
must be completed and confirmed as exceedin g the criterion for rescue before rescue 
therapy is initiated. The re-test confirmation should be performed as soon as possible, but within 7 days of receipt, by [CONTACT_234477]. 
In the event that a confirmatory FPG and/or Hb A1c exceed the threshold, the Investigator should 
ensure that no reasonable explanation exists for in sufficient glucose control and in particular that: 
• The increased FPG has been tested at a fasting status (ie, no food intake for ≥8 hours) 
• IMP is given at the maximum planned dose and the basal insulin is titrated according to the titration algorithm 
• Lantus is appropriately titrated, according to the titration algorithm, during the Run-in Phase and from Week 18 to EOT 
• There is no intercurrent disease, which may jeopardize glycemic control (eg, infectious 
disease) 
• Compliance to treatment is appropriate

dose is the first choice prior to initiating prandial insulin or a GLP-[ADDRESS_1103788]. 
If any of the above can reasonably explain insuffi cient glycemic control, the Investigator should 
consider not initiating rescue  medication and should undert ake appropriate action, ie: 
• Assess plasma glucose in fasting cond ition (ie, after at least 8-hour fast) 
• Initiate an evaluation and treatment of intercurrent disease (to be reported in 
AE/concomitant medication parts of the eCRF and the medical record) 
• Stress the absolute need to be compliant with treatment. Increase in Lantus dose is the first choice prior to initiating prandial insulin 
• Organize a specific interview with the patient and a Registered Dietician or other qualified nutrition professional and to reinforce on the ab solute need to be compliant to diet and 
lifestyle recommendations, and schedule an FPG/ HbA1c assessment at the next visit (in 
case the next visit is a phone call, it should be replaced by [CONTACT_63689]-site visit). 
If none of the above mentioned reasons can be fo und, or if appropriate action fails to decrease 
FPG/HbA1c
 under the threshold values, rescue medica tion may be introduced. However, patients 
exceeding glucose rescue limits should have thei r Lantus dose up-titrated without a maximum 
limit as a first approach. If up-titra tion of the Lantus regimen has been unsuccessful (ie, increase 
in basal insulin is associated with low FPG valu es despi[INVESTIGATOR_799920]1c or  elevated post-prandial 
values), it is appropriate to initiate rescue therapy. 
The recommended approach to rescue, if rescue thresholds have reached despi[INVESTIGATOR_799926]-titration of the 
Lantus dose, is to initiate a prandial insulin, or a GLP-[ADDRESS_1103789] or another antidiabetic agent (except SGLT2 inhibitors) as per the Investigator ’s discretion and in line with local treatment 
guidelines. The prandial insulin can be any injectable short-acting insulin including fast-acting insulin analogs (such as, Humalog, Novolog, Api[INVESTIGATOR_27976] , and Fiasp) or regular insulin (eg, Humulin) 
or inhaled insulin (Afrezza). 
If a patient requires glycemic  rescue, the IMP received dur ing the randomized, double-blind 
Treatment Period should continue  and must remain blinded until the EOS. The dose of the 
existing OAD may be adjusted after rescue therapy. Rescue therapy is considered an  NIMP. Rescue therapy is to be reported in the eCRF. This 
information should include specific drug name, dose, route of administration, and frequency. If not covered by [CONTACT_150401], the cost of  rescue therapy will be reimbursed by [CONTACT_799959].

performed by a local study Investigator, sponsor phy sician or healthcare professional with direct 
responsibility for patient care. If the blind is broken, the Investigator should document the date, 
time of day, and reason for code breaking. The identity of the unblinded personnel, how the code 
was broken, and the treatment kit number should also be recorded. The Sponsor should also be informed. If the code is broken by [CONTACT_18413] (or other medical doctor in emergency 
situation), the patient must be withdrawn from IMP administration.

During the study Treatment Period, the following medications are prohibited: 
• Initiation of any antidiabetic agents, including oral, inhaled, or injectable antihyperglycemic agents other than the IMP and NIMP is not allowed before the rescue therapy. The existing background medication (N IMP) should not be modified before the 
rescue. 
• SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, canagliflozin, dapaglif lozin, or empagliflozin) are not allowed for 
rescue. 
• Systemic use of glucocorticoids for more th an 10 consecutive days (topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], intra-articular, 
ophthalmic, nasal spray, or inhaled applica tions are allowed). 
• IMPs in any other clinical study. 
• Modification of any antihypertensive medication before Week 12 is not allowed unless for safety reasons. 
• Initiation of any weight loss drugs (eg, phentermine, orlistat). 
Patients taking sotagliflozin w ith concomitant digoxin should have digoxin concentrations 
monitored and doses reduced as needed. In addition, other P-gp substrates may be affected and the 
labels of P-gp substrate drugs should be c onsulted with regards to monitoring and dose 
adjustments. 
Note: short-term use (<10 consecutive days) of th e prohibited medication, eg, short-acting insulin 
for treatment of acute illness or surgery is allowed. Other medications which are unlikely to interfere with the PK or pharmacodynamics of the IMP 
or confound interpretation of the study endpoints are allowed as ne eded and following discussion

medication that will be used to treat hyperglycemia when a patient’s hyperglycemia reaches the 
rescue threshold, plus the protocol-specified background therapy (Lantus), and/or up to 2 OADs 
(metformin and/or other OADs). Th e recommended approach to rescue , if rescue thresholds have 
been reached despi[INVESTIGATOR_799926]-titration of the Lantus dos e, is to initiate a prandial insulin, or a GLP-[ADDRESS_1103793] or another antidiabetic agent (except SGLT2 inhibitors) as per the I nvestigator’s discretion 
and in line with local treatment guidelines. 
8.[ADDRESS_1103794]-STUDY TREATMENT 
As sotagliflozin may reduce BP, decrease of antihypertensive medication may be needed during the study in patients with hypertension. Conversely,  monitoring for an increase in BP should be 
performed after withdrawal of study medication. If the BP is elevated after withdrawal of study 
treatment, the Investigator should consider a dding or adjusting antihypertensive medication. 
Sotagliflozin will not be provided after EOT. Patient’s further treatment, for diabetes and other 
pathologies will be at the Investigator’s discretion based on his/her clinical judgment.

9.1.4 Assessment methods of efficacy endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hemoglobin A1c 
Hemoglobin A1c will be assessed at Screening (Visit 1), Week -1 (Visit 5), and all on-site visits 
during the double-blind Treatment Period. 
For the eligibility and efficacy assessments of the study, HbA1c is measured by a certified level I 
“National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program” central laboratory to allow estimation of the change from Baseline to Week 18 in HbA1c and the proportion of patients with HbA1c <6.5%, <7.0% at Week 18. 
If a patient needs to receive rescue antidia betes medication, assessment of HbA1c should be 
performed before the introducti on of the rescue medication. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Fasting plasma glucose measurement 
Plasma glucose is measured in the fasting state at Screening (Visit 1) and all on-site visits during 
the Treatment Period. Fasting plasma glucose will be  performed in fasting state, ie, without any 
food intake (except for water) for at least 8 hours.  For the eligibility and efficacy assessments of 
the study, FPG is measured at a central laboratory to allow estimation of change from Baseline to Week 18 in FPG. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Blood pressure measurements 
Systolic BP and DBP will be asse ssed at all on-site visits. Blood pr essure measurements taken as 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] with details provided in Appendix D .

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 63 [IP_ADDRESS] Body weight measurement 
Body weight is measured at all on-site visits to allow the estimation of change from Baseline to 
Week 52 in BW. Change from Baseline to Week  18 in BW will also be assessed (secondary 
endpoint). 
Body weight should be obtained with the patient wearing undergarments or very light clothing 
and no shoes, and with an empty bladder. The sa me scale should be used throughout the study, 
and calibrated on a regular basis as recommended  by [CONTACT_3455]. Calibration should be 
documented in source documents. The use of balan ce scales is recommended; if digital scales are 
used, testing with standard weig hts is of particular importance. The floor surface on which the 
scale rests must be hard and should not be carpete d or covered with other soft material. The scale 
should be balanced with both weights at zero and the balance bar alig ned. The patient should 
stand in the center of the platform as standing off-center may affect measurement. The weights are moved until the beam balances (the arrows are aligned). The weight is read and recorded in the eCRF and source data. Self-reported weights are not acceptable; patients must not read the scales themselves. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Kidney function parameter measurement 
Serum creatinine will be assessed at Screening (Visit 1), Week -1 (Visit 5), Baseline (Visit 6), and all subsequent on-site visits. Urinary albumin, total protein, cr eatinine, calcium (adjusted for 
creatinine), phosphorus (adjusted for serum phosphor us and creatinine), magnesium (adjusted for 
serum magnesium and urinary creatinine) and glucose will be assessed from overnight urine samples taken at Weeks 0, 12, 26, and 52. A central laboratory will analyz e samples and estimate 
change from Baseline in serum UACR. 
[IP_ADDRESS] 7-point SMBG profiles 
Before (pre-injection after randomization) and [ADDRESS_1103796]; be fore and 2 hours after 
lunch; before and 2 hours after di nner and at bedtime: at least one day in the week before the 
Baseline visit (Visit 6), and before Vi sit 12 (Week 18) and Visit 15 (Week 52). 
Note: Patients should be reminded at the preceding visit to perform at least one day 7-point 
SMBG in the week prior to above study visits . If found missing performance (or any missing 
point), the visit should be postponed to allo w the patient for repeating the performance. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Proportion of patien ts starting rescue therapy 
The use of rescue medication for hyperglycemia  will be assessed and reported throughout the 
Treatment Period. Routine alerts on FPG and/or HbA1c will be sent  to the Investigator from the 
central laboratory to ensure that glycemic parameter results remain within predefined thresholds. For details and further actions should FPG values fall above thresholds, refer to Section 8.2.4.

Patients will record their Lantus daily dose in the diary since Visit 2 at the beginning of Run-in 
and throughout the Treatment Period. In case of re scue therapy with prandial insulin, the meal-
time insulin will also be recorded in the patient’s diary. The insulin doses will be reviewed and verified by [CONTACT_478410], and then be documented onto the eCRF. 
The total daily insulin dose (Lantus and prandial, if applicable) will be analyzed by [CONTACT_6660]. 
9.2 SAFETY ENDPOINTS 
Assessments for safety include AEs, SMBG, clinical laboratory assessments, physical 
examination, 12-lead ECG, weight, and vital signs. An independent DMC will meet on a regular basis to review accumulating clinical trial safety data. 
Adjudication of all deaths, MACE/other selected CV events, selected renal events, bone fracture, 
and DKA will be performed in a blinded manner by a CEC(s) comprised of experts. Details will 
be provided in the charter of the CEC( s). Further details are available in Section 6.3.3. 
Two expert committees will review all potential cases of DILIs and cases of amputation in a 
treatment-blinded manner. 
The following safety endpoints will be assessed throughout the 52-week double-blind Treatment 
Period: 
• Adverse events, AEs leading to discontinuation from the IMP, adverse events of special 
interest (AESI), EOSI, SAEs, and deaths 
• Hypoglycemia (all, severe a nd/or documented symptomatic) 
• Markers of calcium metabolism 
• Safety laboratory results (including amyl ase, lipase, and fasting lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]; see  
Section [IP_ADDRESS]), vital signs results, and 12-lead ECG results. 
Observation period of safety endpoints  
The observation period of safety data will be divided into 3 segments: 
• The pre-Treatment Period is defined as the time between the date of informed consent and the first dose of double-blind IMP. 
• The on-Treatment Period (TEAE period) is defined as the time from the first dose of double-blind IMP up to 10 days (1 day for hypoglycemia) after the last dose of double-blind IMP, regardless of the in troduction of rescue therapy. Th e 10-day interval is chosen 
based on the half-life of the IMP (approximately 5 times the half-life of sotagliflozin) in patients with moderate renal dysfunction. 
• The post-Treatment Period is defined as the time starting [ADDRESS_1103797] dose of 
double-blind IMP (after the on-Treatment Period).

laboratory urinalysis by [CONTACT_234495]. Central urinalysis includes: 
• Urine dipstick includes: specific gravit y, pH, protein, blood, ketones, bilirubin, 
urobilinogen, nitrite, a nd leukocyte esterase 
• Urine microscopy includes, but is not limited to: detection of formed cellular elements, casts, bacteria, yeast, parasites, and cr ystals in centrifuged urine sediment. 
In the event of abnormal urinalysis findings suspic ious of UTI, urine culture should be performed. 
Positive urine culture determina tion will be based upon the criteri a of the reporting laboratory. 
Additionally, urine culture should be performed if at any point th e Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_400279] a UTI. 
If the urine dipstick is positive for blood, the centr al laboratory will perform reflexive testing to 
include microscopy. Additional testing will be performed according to the judgment of the 
Investigator. Referral to urology/urologic ev aluation is recommended for new or unexplained 
cases of confirmed hematuria (urology/urologic evaluation is not required where hematuria is 
considered to be related to diabetic nephropathy). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital signs 
A complete physical exam (including sitting BP and heart rate, temperature and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) will be performed at Visit 1 (Screening) and Week 26 (Visit 13). Abbreviated physical exams (including sitting BP and heart rate) will be performed at all other on-site visits. The abbreviated physical exam should focus on cardiac and respi[INVESTIGATOR_799928], as well as any areas important for 
assessment of AEs if necessary. 
Three separate seated BPs and heart rate measur ements should be taken with at least [ADDRESS_1103804] period, and prior to phleb otomy. Full details and 
directions for the measurement of BP are presented in Appendix D .

[IP_ADDRESS] Diabetic ketoacidosis 
During the Run-in Phase patients will be provided meters and test strips for monitoring capi[INVESTIGATOR_799930]-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Patients will be instructed to measure their BHB levels by 
[CONTACT_799963]/ketoacidosis throughout the 
Lantus titration phase/Run-in Phas e and randomized Treatment Period. Patients will be instructed 
on how to respond (seek help, hydrate, ingest carbohydrates, etc) if they present with possible ketoacidosis symptoms and the BHB value is abnormal (>0.6 mM/L) (see Appendix C ). 
Patients will be provide d with instructions on how to recognize the symptoms of DKA and 
perform the BHB measurement at home in these situations, and will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_779] (or seek emergency medical services if after business hours) if these symptoms develop. 
Patients should have a full clinical evaluation with laboratory testing for possible DKA by [CONTACT_799964]. If such an evaluation and laboratory testing 
confirm the presence of metabolic acidosis, then appropriate treatment should be implemented and the “Possible DKA” eCRF should be completed. 
In addition, serum BHB will be a ssessed at the study site via a central lab determination at 
Baseline (Visit 6), Week 4 (Visit 8), Week 8 (V isit 10), Week 18 (Visit 12), Week 26 (Visit 13),

should call the patient to assess if the patient experiences a suspected DKA, insulin dosing 
compliance, and any action to take, eg, seek urge nt care or unscheduled site visit for further 
evaluation. 
9.3 OTHER ENDPOINTS 
9.3.1 Pharmacokinetics 
The PK endpoint for sotagliflozin is: 
• Plasma concentrations of sotagliflozin and its 3-O-glucuronide metabolite.

The addition of sotagliflozin to background therap y consisting of Lantus with or without up to 
2 OADs (which may include metformin) is expect ed to lower HbA1c over 18 weeks of treatment 
(primary efficacy analysis). Sotagliflozin treatment for [ADDRESS_1103805] of a treatment on glyce mic control. The duration of study treatment (18 weeks for the 
primary HbA1c endpoint) is considered to be suffi cient for achieving stable conditions with IMP 
and for enabling an adequate assessment of time-dependent changes in HbA1c. 
The problem of weight gain in T2D is widely recognized. More than 80% of individuals with T2D 
are overweight, many at the time of diagnosis. Consequently, iatrogenic weight gain is not only unwelcome, but represents an important clinical issue that can become a barrier to the successful management of glycemic control. Therefore, in this study, assessing change in BW from Baseline 
to Week [ADDRESS_1103806] of sotagliflozin on BP reduction will be assessed in all trial patients 
and in patients with a mean SBP ≥[ADDRESS_1103807] 12 weeks of Treatment Period ( Section 8.8.1). The beneficial effect of sotagliflozin to patients with 
inadequately controlled hyperten sion could be best assessed by [CONTACT_799966], “the 
change in the SBP from Baseline to Week 12 for patients with Baseline SBP ≥ 130 mmHg”. In 
addition, the effect of sotagliflozin on BP will be evaluated in all patients,  including normotensive 
individuals. 
Improvement in FPG has been observed with sotagliflozin in multiple studies. Therefore 
assessment of FPG is relevant in this study. Th is parameter is also considered by [CONTACT_799967]. 
The other efficacy and safety assessments in  this study are standard, well established 
measurements for a Phase 3 study evaluating the treatment of T2D in a dult patients. Safety 
laboratory parameters include BHB (beta-hydroxybutyrate), which is considered as a sensitive 
indicator for DKA diagnosis and monitoring ( 20). The values measured during study course will 
be analyzed between the treatment groups.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 73 The length of the study is considered appropriate for detection of efficacy endpoints given the 
power estimates (see Section 11). 
Phase 2 data indicated that sotagliflozin may reduce SBP by 10 to 15 mmHg in patients with SBP 
≥[ADDRESS_1103808] in patients w ith SBP <130 mmHg, and 
did not induce hypotension in normotensive patients.  Since this could be of benefit to patients 
with T2D, this finding is being followed up as a secondary objective in this trial, as well as the 
potential in patients with DBP ≥80 mmHg. Although effects on BP in Phase 2 data were observed 
with the 400 mg dose at 12 weeks, the effects will be examined at Weeks 12, 26, and 52. 
Because of potential effects on calcium metabolism, specific biomarkers for calcium metabolism 
will be assessed at regular time points.

10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE 
The visit schedule and procedures/assessments  are listed in the Study Flow Chart ( Section 1.2). 
The aim of this section is to provide details on how so me of the procedures/assessments should be 
performed. 
This is an out-patient study and consists of 12 on-site visits and 4 telephone visits, although 
optional on-site and/or telephone visits can be scheduled at any time for any reason during the 
study whenever considered necessary by [CONTACT_737]. The patients need to be fasting for on-site visits Visit 1 through Visit 15 (Week -6 through 
Week 52), unless otherwise instructed by [CONTACT_108899]. Throughout the study, “fasting” is 
defined as at least 8 hours without any food intake (except for water). Note: if the patient is not 
fasting at the visits specified above, the blood sample will not be collected  and a new appointment 
should be given to the patient for the following day if  possible, with instruction to be fasted (other 
procedures can be performed as scheduled). The first Run-in Visit (Visit 2) can be performed as soon as the results of all Screenin g tests are available and the patient  is confirmed to be eligible 
for participation in the study. The visit window for Visit 5 is ±2 days, and Visits 7 through 13 
should occur within ±3 days. Visits 14 and 15 should occur at the scheduled time point ±7 days. Visit 15 (EOT) should occur from Day 357 to Day 371. For the Follow-up Visit (Visit 16), the visit should occur within a window of ±[ADDRESS_1103809] dose of IMP. If one date is 
changed, the next visit should occur according to the original schedule, ie, calculated from the 
date of Baseline Visit (Visit 6, Day 1). 
For a complete list of procedures scheduled for each study visit, please refer to the Study Flow 
Chart (Section 1.2), which details the procedures to be performed. 
All data obtained during the trial visits are review ed by [CONTACT_11219]/or Sub-investigators 
who are qualified in the treatment of  T2D and are trained on the study. 
10.1.1 Screening Period 
The Screening Period is up to 6 weeks in dura tion and includes the Screening phase and the 
Run-in phase. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Screening phase (Visit 1) 
The Screening phase will be up to 2 weeks in duration and includes Visit 1 (Week -6) only. It 
must be long enough to collect the data to establish whether the patient satisfies the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Temporary treatment discontinuation may be consider ed by [CONTACT_179639]. Low extremity complications (such as skin ulcers, infection, osteomyelitis and gangrene) 
requiring treatment should lead to temporary disc ontinuation of IMP.  Re -initiation of treatment 
with the IMP will be done under close and appropriate clinical and/or la boratory monitoring once 
the Investigator will have considered according to his/her best medical judgment, that the 
occurrence of the concerned event was unlikely to be related to the IMP. 
It is in the interest of the patient to m onitor their blood glucose during the temporary 
discontinuation period, therefore regular deter mination of SMBG is to be performed and 
documented (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
For all temporary treatment discontinuations, the duration should be recorded by [CONTACT_799968] e CRF when considered as confirmed. 
Temporary treatment discontinuation, as decided by  [CONTACT_737], corresponds to more than 
1 dose not administered to the patient. 
Use of any other antihyperglycemic medication during the time of temporary treatment 
discontinuation (ie, insulin during a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) is recorded as concomitant medication with 
the name [CONTACT_799983]. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_1103820](s) 
Permanent treatment discontinuati on is defined as any treatment discontinuation associated with 
the definitive decision from the Investigator or the patient not to re-expose the patient to the IMP 
at any time. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_1103821] of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
Patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP at any time for any reason or this may be the Investigator’s decision. Patients should discuss stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_799934], glycemic therapy adjusted, and a follow-up 
assessment arranged. All effort s should be made to document the reasons for treatment 
discontinuation and this should be documented in the eCRF. 
The following reasons lead to permanent discontinuation: 
• At the patient’s own request (ie, w ithdrawal of consent for treatment) 
• If, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continua tion with the administration of the study 
treatment would be detrimental  to the patient’s well-being

long as the abnormality persists and if the ca usal relationship of the concerned event and

• Pregnancy (in female patients) 
• Specific request of the Sponsor. 
Any abnormal laboratory value w ill be immediately rechecked to confirm the result before a 
decision is made to permanently disc ontinue IMP for the concerned patient. 
For patients who prematurely discontinue the IMP, the assessments planned at the EOT Visit (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]) will be performed at the Premature EOT Visit scheduled preferably prior to 
treatment discontinuation or as soon as possible after the time of discontinua tion (at the latest at 
the next scheduled on-site visit). In the case of premature IMP disc ontinuation, PK samples 
should not be drawn at the Premature EOT Visit, or  at any subsequent visit. The reason(s) for IMP 
discontinuation will be clearly specified. This EOT assessment may occur at a regularly scheduled 
or unscheduled visit. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_1103822]. 
If a patient decides to discontinue study treatment early, a Premature EOT Visit (see   
Section [IP_ADDRESS]) should be scheduled prior to treatment  discontinuation, if possible. If not 
possible, the Premature EOT Visit should be sc heduled as soon as possible after treatment 
discontinuation. In the case of premature IMP di scontinuation, PK samples should not be drawn at 
the Premature EOT Visit, or at any subsequent vi sits. For patients that di scontinue treatment but 
remain in the study, remaining study visits s hould occur as scheduled where possible. The IRT 
should be notified of EOT.

An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or 
• Is life-threatening, or 
Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_56385], or

The Sponsor will report all safety observations made during the condu ct of the trial in the CSR. 
10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 
10.6.1 Hypoglycemia 
During the study, patients are instructed to do cument the presence or absence of hypoglycemic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_799935]. The hypoglycemia will be reported in 
the specific eCRF page with onset date and time, symptoms and/or signs, the SMBG value if 
available, and the treatment. If the event fulfills SAE criteria, hypoglycemia will also be reported as an SAE. 
Hypoglycemia is categorized according to th e American Diabetes Association workgroup on 
hypoglycemia classification ( 21) and summarized in Figure 1. 
In addition to the threshold of ≤ 3.9 mmol/L ( ≤70 mg/dL), hypoglycemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_49576] a plasma
 
glucose of <3.0 mmol/L (<54 mg/dL) will be analyzed separately.

Severe hypoglycemia 
Severe hypoglycemia is an event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer 
carbohydrate (sugar), glucagon, intravenous glucose, or other resuscitative actions. These epi[INVESTIGATOR_799936], unconsciousness, 
or coma. Self-monitored plasma glucose values may not be available, but neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of  plasma glucose to normal is cons idered sufficient evidence that 
the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration. 
Note: “Requiring assistance of another person” means that the patie nt could not help himself or 
herself to treat the hypoglycemia. Assisting a patient out of kindness, when assistance is not required, should not be considered a “requires assistance” incident. 
Any hypoglycemic event which leads to uncons ciousness, coma, or seizure should also be 
reported as an SAE. 
Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia 
Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia is an event during which typi[INVESTIGATOR_234458] a measured plasma glucose concentration of ≤3.9 mmol/L 
(≤70 mg/dL).

Asymptomatic hypoglycemia 
Asymptomatic hypoglycemia is an event not acco mpanied by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_277100] a measured plasma glucose concentration ≤3.9 mmol/L ( ≤70 mg/dL). 
Note: low plasma glucose values without symptoms or signs should not be reported more than 
once within 30 minutes. Repeated low glucose valu es within a short period could be due to 
malfunction of the device, error testing or following up a low glucose reading. The Investigator 
should try not to document false low SMBG va lues or redundant low glucose values as 
asymptomatic hypoglycemic events. Further clarification with the patients is needed. 
Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia 
Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia is an event during which symptoms of hypoglycemia are not 
accompanied by a plasma glucose determination, ( but that was presumably caused by a plasma 
glucose concentration ≤3.9 mmol/L [ ≤70 mg/dL]), ie, symptoms treated with oral carbohydrate 
without a test of plasma glucose. 
Relative hypoglycemia 
Relative hypoglycemia recently termed “pseudo-hypoglycemia” ( 21) is an event during which the 
patient reports typi[INVESTIGATOR_10921], and interprets the symptoms as indicative of 
hypoglycemia, but with a measured plasma gl ucose concentration >3.9 mmol/L (>70 mg/dL).

All events will be managed and reported in compliance with all applicable regulations, and 
included in the final CSR.

patients with 0, 0 to 20% , and >20% under-planned  dosing administrations. 
11.4.2 Analyses of efficacy endpoints 
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population. 
Statistical testing will be performed for primary  endpoint at Week 18, and at Week 12 (for SBP) 
and Week 18 and Week 52 (for HbA1c and BW) for secondary endpoints. All other efficacy 
variables will only be summarized by [CONTACT_799975]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint 
The statistical test will be two-sided tests at a nominal 5% significance level. Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (chang e from Baseline to Week 18 in HbA1c) will be 
performed using the ITT population, using HbA1c measurements obtained from visits during the 
study, including those obtained after IMP disc ontinuation or introduction of rescue therapy. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of change in HbA1c from Baseline to Week 18 will be analyzed 
with missing values imputed by [CONTACT_268139]-base d multiple imputation method under the missing not 
at random framework. 
• For placebo patients, missing data will be imputed based on the placebo group data 
• For patients in the sotagliflozin groups, missing  data will be imputed as if the patients 
were on placebo group throughout the study, wh ere all patients’ measurements including 
the on-treatment measurements will be considered as if the measurements were from the placebo group in the imputation model.

Summary statistics (for Screening value, Baselin e value, observed values, and observed changes 
from Baseline) at scheduled visits will be provided for each treatment group. The summary will 
include the number of observations, mean, SD , standard error (SE), minimum, median, and

• Ethnicity (Hispanic, Not Hispanic) 
• Age group (<50 years, ≥50 to <65 years, ≥65 years) 
• Gender 
• Baseline BMI level (<30, ≥30 kg/m2) 
• Baseline HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%) 
• Baseline SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg) 
• Country 
• Use of sulfonylureas at Week -1 (yes, no). 
The treatment effects across the subgroups defined for each of these factors will be estimated for 
the change from Baseline to Week 18 in HbA1c in the ITT population, and using a similar 
approach to the analysis for the primary effica cy endpoint. The adjusted estimates of treatment 
mean differences (sotagliflozin [ADDRESS_1103829] acebo) with SE and 95% CIs will be provided as 
appropriate across the subgroups. 
In the event that the subgroup factor is identical  or similar to a randomization strata factor (eg, 
Baseline HbA1c category, Baseline SBP category, or sulfonylurea use), only the subgroup factor 
will be included in the model in order to avoid the issue of co-linearity in the analysis. 
Baseline definition 
The Baseline value is defined ge nerally as the last available value before the first dose of 
double-blind IMP or the last available value prior to Randomization for patients who were 
randomized but never exposed to IMP.

Once the main study primary variable (change from Baseline to Week 18 in HbA1c comparing 
sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo) is statistically significant at α = 0.05 (2-sided), a hierarchical 
testing procedure will be performed to test the following main study secondary efficacy variables by [CONTACT_638204]. The testing w ill stop as soon as an endpoint is found to be not

DEFINITIONS 
Non-reproductive potential 
• Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: 
- Documented hysterectomy 
- Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] 
- Documented bilateral oophorectomy. 
• Postmenopausal - A postmenopausal state is defined as no mens es for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high FSH level in the pos tmenopausal range may be  used to confirm 
a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormone 
replacement therapy (HRT). However, in th e absence of [ADDRESS_1103838] disc ontinue HRT to allo w confirmation of 
postmenopausal status before study enrolment. 
Reproductive potential (WOCBP) 
A woman is considered of reproductive potential (WOCBP), ie, fertile, following menarche and 
until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently  sterile. Permanent sterilization methods 
include hysterectomy, bilateral salp ingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. 
CONTRACEPTIVE GUIDANCE 
Women of reproductive potential (WOCBP) must us e a highly effective method of contraception 
during the treatment period and the post-treatment follow up peri od (14 ± 3 days). If another 
contraceptive method is used (such as a barrier method), it should be used in combination with 
one of the highly effective methods (such as an oral contraceptive).

Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent 
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctlya 
• Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing ) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation 
- Oral 
- Intravaginal 
- Transdermal. 
• Progestogen-only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
− Oral 
− Injectable. 
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent 
• Implantable progestogen-only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
• Intrauterine device (IUD) 
• Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion 
• Vasectomized partner 
(Vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the 
sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential and the absence of sperm has been 
confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method(s) of contraception should be used. 
Spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days.)  
• Sexual abstinence 
(Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.)  
NOTES: 
a Typi[INVESTIGATOR_35818]. Use should be consistent with local regul ations 
regarding the use of contraceptive methods for patients participating in clinical studies.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 119 COLLECTION OF PREGNANCY INFORMATION  
Male patients with partners of reproductive potential who become pregnant 
• The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partner of a 
male study patient who becomes pregnant while participating in this study. This applies 
only to patients who receive study treatment 
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed  consent from the pregnant female partner 
directly, the Investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy 
• Partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor 
• Generally, follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery 
date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence 
or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure. 
Female patients who become pregnant 
• The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female patient, who becomes pregnant while participating in this study 
• Information will be recorded on the appropriat e form and submitted to the Sponsor within 
24 hours of learning of a participant’s pregnancy 
• Participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator will collect follow-up information on participant and neonate, which will be forwarded to 
the Sponsor. Generally, follow-up will not be re quired for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond 
the estimated delivery date 
• Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure 
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be  an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication 
or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE 
• A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such 
Any SAE occurring as a result of a post-study pr egnancy which is considered reasonably related 
to the study treatment by [CONTACT_737], will be reported to the Spons or as described in  
Section 10.4.3. While the Investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former 
study patients, he/she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 122 Appendix C Recommendations on basic ge nitourinary hygiene, maintaining 
hydration, and recognizing diabetic ketoacidosis 
Patients with T2D are at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_638177] (GU) infections. The following 
guidelines should be communicated to females an d uncircumcised males regarding GU infections. 
Patient communication cards will be printed with the following: 
For females: 
“The following advice may be useful in helpin g you to keep your bladder and urethra free from 
infection: 
• Go to the toilet as soon as you feel the need to urinate, rather than holding it in 
• Wipe from front to back after going to the toilet 
• Practice good hygiene by [CONTACT_638212], and before having sex 
• Empty your bladder after having sex.” 
For uncircumcised males: 
“The following advice may be useful in helpin g you to keep the foreskin free from infection: 
• Wash the end of your penis and foreskin with soap and water (do not let soap get in the 
opening) 
• After your shower or bath, dry the end of your penis and foreskin properly and replace the foreskin 
• Also, when you urinate, slide the foreskin back enough so that urine does not get on the foreskin-this helps to keep it clean.” 
Maintaining hydration: 
Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors are associated with osmotic diuresis and volume 
depletion, which may lead to dizz iness or hypotension, especially in the elderly. Before initiating 
study drug (at Screening, Run-in and Randomization)  and during all on-site study visits thereafter, 
assess volume status in patients with  renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low SBP, or if 
receiving diuretics, angiotensin- converting-enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers. 
All patients will be advised to maintain proper fluid intake and to consider increasing it if they sense greater thirst, more urine producti on, or if they feel dizzy or faint. 
Patient communication cards will be printed with the following for patients with T2D: 
“The following advice may be useful in helpin g you to maintain prope r hydration and prevent 
dehydration: 
• Dehydration is when your body loses too much fluid, frequently due to diarrhea or 
increased urination

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 123 • Consider increasing the amount of fluids you drink if: 
- You sense greater thirst than usual 
- You have a dry mouth or cracked lips 
- You have a fever 
- You have diarrhea or vomiting 
- You urinate more frequently or in larger amounts than usual 
- You get up in the middle of the night to urinate (more than usual) 
- You feel dizzy or light-headed 
- You exercise, or when it is hot outside.”  
Recognizing diabet ic ketoacidosis 
Potential GI AEs occurring with sotagliflozin may mask presenting symptoms of DKA. Patients 
will be provided with the BHB meter and instructions for use at the start of the Run-in Phase at 
Visit 2 (Week -4). Patients will be instructed to measure their BHB levels by [CONTACT_799980] s/ketoacidosis throughout the entire study period. 
Patients will be instructed on how to  respond (seek help, hydrate, ingest  carbohydrates, etc) if they 
present with potential ketoacidosis symptoms and the BHB value is abnormal (>0.6 mM/L). 
Patient communication cards will be printed with the following: 
“If you have any of these symptoms on the list, measure your glucose and BHB by [CONTACT_171254], 
and then contact [CONTACT_799981]: 
• Inability to maintain oral intake 
• Generalized weakness 
• Abdominal (belly) pain 
• Increased weight loss 
• Fever 
• Frequent urination, including at night 
• Fruity-scented breath 
• Confusion 
• Acute illness 
• Consistently elevated blood glucose 
• Feeling very thirsty or drinking a lot 
• Nausea or vomiting 
• Having trouble thinking clearly or feeling tired.

for evaluation. 
If your blood BHB reading is >0.6 mM/L and you have symptoms of ketoacidosis, seek help, 
hydrate, ingest carbohydrates, etc, as described above. If you are scheduled for a procedure or surgery th at requires you to not take any food or liquids, 
please contact [CONTACT_799982] r instructions on continuing study drug. In such cases your 
study doctor may advise you NOT to take your st udy drug from the day prior to the procedure or 
surgery until after the procedure or surgery is co mplete, and you are taking food and liquids as 
you normally do.” Whenever AE data is collected or the patient  reports DKA or intercurrent illness (including 
infections), generalized weakness, increased weight loss, GI symptoms including nausea, 
vomiting, or abdominal pain or other symptoms or signs that the Investigator believes may be 
consistent with DKA, then the site will determine if an assessment for DKA is appropriate. If 
laboratory testing confirms pres ence of metabolic acidosis, then the “Possible DKA” eCRF will 
be completed.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 125 Appendix D Measurement of blood pressure and heart rate 
Equipment 
1. Blood pressure measurements will be taken by [CONTACT_400363] a manual 
sphygmomanometer. Same equipment should be  used throughout the study and should be 
calibrated as per manuf acturer recommendation. 
2. Bladder Length – Should nearly or completely encircle the patient’s arm. For many adults, 
the standard “adult” size bladder is not l ong enough and the “large” size bladder is 
recommended. 
3. Bladder Width – Should be at least 40% of the bladder length. 
Patient factors 
Extraneous variables associated  with the measurement of BP should be minimized. These include: 
1. Food intake, caffeine-containing beverages, cigarette smoking, or strenuous exercise 
within 2 hours prior to measurement. 
2. Full urinary bladder. 
3. The patient should not be allowed to talk while BP is being measured. 
4. The patient should be placed in the examination room and the cuff should be placed on the patient’s nondominant arm. The proper sized cuff should fit snugly with the lower edge [ADDRESS_1103840] (temperature 
around 25°C or 77°F) for [ADDRESS_1103841] and with no restrictive cl othing on the arm. The patient should be 
encouraged not to tense his/her muscles. 
Determination of the reference arm 
At Visit 1 (Week -6), seated BP should be measured in both arms after 5-minute rest period, and 
then again after [ADDRESS_1103842] SBP will be 
determined at this visit, and BP should be measur ed always in this same arm throughout the study. 
Measurement technique 
At Visit 1, immediately following arm selecti on, with the patient in the same position, an 
additional seated BP should be measured in th e selected arm (at least [ADDRESS_1103843] 
measurement). 
At all other on-site visits, following the 5-minut e rest period, [ADDRESS_1103844] 1 minute between BP measurements and with the cuff 
fully deflated between measurements.

 In the [LOCATION_002], 80,000 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures are estimated to 
occur annually, with an increased likelihood of these injuries involving individuals participating 
in sports and aged between 15 -25 years [7]. A potential long -term consequenc e of ACL injuries 
is the development of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) in the years following injury [8,9]. 
There  are no curative treatments for osteoarthritis , increasing the importance of minimizing the 
occurrence of PTOA following ACL injuries. Current literature has begun to indicate that 
biochemical changes in the knee joint cartilage, such as chondrocyte death, following injury can 
contribute to the development of PTOA [10 -12]. 
 A non-surgical treatment option  for the management of osteoarthritis include  injectables such 
as corticosteroids  and platelet rich plasma (PRP) . These injectables work by [CONTACT_423765],  also known as  chondrocytes , and the cells of the  joint lining tissue, also known as 
synoviocytes.  PRP is an autologous derived blood product , i.e. a joint injectable made from the 
patient’s own blood at the time and location of injection  with simple blood centrifugation .  
Studies in the bench -top lab oratory setting have provided in -vitro evidence that PRP decreas es 
synoviocyte  production of metallometal  proteases, an inflammatory protein with negative effects 
on cartilage, decreases the effects of inflammatory proteins such as IL -B on chondrocytes , and 
has an anti -inflammatory effect upon the gene expression of chondrocytes and synoviocytes [14-
16]. While these are mechanisms that can help manage osteoarthritis after it arises, they also are 
mechanisms that could help prevent osteoarthritis before it forms.  Recent comparative studies  of 
PRP to other injectables in the management of osteoarthritis suggest  a greater, long -lasting effect 
of PRP than other injectables  [1-6]. 
 Orthopedic research has focused on methods to prevent PTOA after ACL injury.  Recent 
study involving the post -injury ACL joint milieu suggested that  an early intervention of  joint 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_423761], including a decrease in biomarkers 
responsible for chondral degeneration  [13]. This combined with in vitro study on the effects of  
PRP on chondrocyte and synoviocyte activity  suggest that PRP has potential  to affect the ACL -
injured joint . However , current literature is lacking in regard to this assertion, and in vivo study 
of PRP to positively affect the joint after  following ACL injury  is warranted . 
[ADDRESS_535359] the biomarkers representative of chondral degeneration in 
patients with ACL injuries. We hypothesize that the intervention  will reduce the volume of 
inflammatory and chondrodegenerative  biomarkers following ACL injur y.

 PRP Manufacturing:  PRP preparation will involve Autologous Conditioned Plasma disposables 
(Arthrex, Naples, FL, [LOCATION_003]), a commercially available kit for the production of PRP.  
Preparation will follow the manufacturer’s instructions . The treating physician will then inject 
the PRP into the involved knee joint following standard aseptic technique per the physician’s 
standard of care. This entire process will be completed in a single patient visit. A 0.1 -0.5 mL 
sample of the PRP will be inserted into a vacutain er for analysis of cell count.  Any unused 
portion of a sample in the physician’s office will be disposed of through standard biohazard 
waste disposal systems as required by [CONTACT_2371].   
Biomarker Analysis:  Samples will be prepared and frozen at -80 C until all study sample have 
been obtained. Enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay kits will be used to assess 
chondrodegenerative & synovial fluid biomarkers.  
6 Expected Risks and Benefits  
 Risks and Discomforts:  Potential risks include those expected with any injection 
including syncope, dizziness, headache, nausea, tachycardia, infection (septic arthritis, phlebitis, 
and osteomyelitis), bleeding, or pain. Additionally, participants  may experience knee stiffness or 
inflammation associated with the PRP injection . Knee aspi[INVESTIGATOR_423762].  
As with any research involving patients there is the inherent risk of a breach in patient 
confidentiality though this will be minimized through the use  of participant  code numbers and 
adherence to all HIPAA guidelines.  
 Benefits:  Direct benefits of the study include potential pain relief, improvement  of knee 
function from joint aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] , and the potential to decrease the risk of PTOA after ACL injury . It is 
also believed that the information obtained in this study will help advance treatment of PTOA  through 
the use of regenerative medicine.

10  Quality Control and Assurance  
All protocols will be monitored and analyzed data will be checked for accuracy by [CONTACT_1961] [INVESTIGATOR_1238] /or a designated AREF r esearch team member. All medical data will be kept in 
compliance with HIPAA guidelines.  
11 Regulatory Requirements  
 Informed Consent:  
The informed consent process will be performed by [CONTACT_423766], in the 
office. All participants  will have the study described to them and will give as much time as they 
require to read an approved, stamped version of the informed consent document. After signing of 
the informed consent document, participants will be g iven a copy for their records. This process 
will take place only after the patient has consented to proceed with the study . 
 Participant  Confidentiality:  
Participant  confidentiality information is listed above in #7 (Data Management Procedures). All 
medical data will be recorded and stored in compliance with HIPAA guidelines.

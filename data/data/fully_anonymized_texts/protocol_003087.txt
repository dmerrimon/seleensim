PI: [INVESTIGATOR_578122] 26, [ADDRESS_759486] of care (SOC) imaging will be recruited 
from the UNC Breast Clinic for participation in the study. The primary 
objective of this single arm study is to compare the sensitivity and 
specificity of a coustic angiography  with traditional b- mode  ultrasound in 
the distinction of malignant versus benign breast lesions .  Secondary 
objectives include a comparison of area under the curve (AUC) for 
acoustic angiography versus b- mode ultrasound, comparison of radiologist 
preferen ce for the two imaging techniques  for each of [ADDRESS_759487] common cancer type among women. Approximately 10% of women in the [LOCATION_002] develop breast cancer during their lifetime and 30% to 40% of these patients will die from it.[33, 34] Mammography is an effective tool for the early detection of breast cancer  in the majority of women.[35] However , for women with dense 
breast tissue (considered an independent risk factor for breast cancer) and younger women, mammography performs poorly  due to lower 
sensitivity and specificity in these groups.[37] For young women with heritable mutations who wish to begin screening at a younger age, these limitations are especially problematic.[38] Additional ly, mammography is 
less sensitive in  women who have undergone breast augmentation. Given 
these limitations , most of these women may undergo additional imaging  
with breast ultrasound or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).  
 MRI is time consuming, extraordinari ly costly, and has limited availability, 
especially among rural and underserved populations . Another screening 
option, breast ultrasound (without contrast) , is widely used when additional 
imaging beyond mammogram is required due to its real -time imaging

2 capability (>30 images per second), portability, safety (does not involve 
radiation), and relatively low cost compared to breast MRI.  Unfortunately, 
while breast ultrasound is highly sensitive (96%), it is less specific (70%), 
resulting in a high false positive rate.  This results in unnecessary biopsies  
with associated complications , additional  follow- up and negative 
psychosocial impacts on patients , e.g., significant anxiety . A significant 
clinical need exists to improve breast ultrasound sensitivity and specificity .  
1.[ADDRESS_759488] reported an association between microvessel density and poorer recurrence- free, cancer -specific 
and overall survival.[39- 46]. Furthermore, both microvessel density and 
microvessel morphology have been reported to be associated with the clinical response to chemotherapy.[16, 47- 49] However, no curr ent clinical 
imaging modality can directly evaluate the microvasculature associated with suspected breast tumors.[50] Histological techniques based on core needle biopsy or surgical biopsy may evaluate only a small portion of a lesion, and require additional invasive procedures. Thus, direct non-invasive evaluation of the tumor micro- vasculature may provide a powerful 
prognostic tool for the diagnosis of breast cancer, and also provide a potential tool for treatment evaluation.  
1.3.1 Screening Based on Angiogenes is-Acoustic Angiography  
Acoustic angiography allows for the viewing of vessel shape and delineation of ‘tortuosity,’ which can indicate the presence and progression of cancer. This ability to image the microvasculature depends on the use of a multi (high) frequency ultrasound scanner in addition to a traditional 
single -frequency pulse -echo ultrasound scanner (b- mode ultrasound), the 
latter to ensure accurate anatomical location of the lesion.  Because of this dependence on pulse- echo, the technique is referred to as “acoustic” 
angiography  [62].   
 Acoustic angiography also depends on use of an ultrasound contrast 
agent. Contrast enhanced ultrasound imaging has been used for nearly two decades for clinical cardiology in the [LOCATION_002] (and is currently routinely used in UNC Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_560972]), and is much more 
widely used in Europe and Asia for visualization of blood perfusion in organs, tissues, and tumors.[51] Early concerns about the safety of ultrasound contrast  (specifically with the contrast  agent  (perflutren lipid; 
Definity®)  due to events in a clinical trial have been resolved; the 
overwhelming amount of more recent evidence from large clinical studies has shown that contrast ultrasound is very safe.[52- 54] In fact ,it is much 
safer than other commonly used techniques, such as coronary angiography, exercise ECG, or myocardial scintigraphy.[55] Furthermore, 
LCCC 1405  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_578122] 26, [ADDRESS_759489] 
agent to be used in LCCC1405 is perflutren lipid.    
1.4 Perflutren Lipid  Background and Known Toxicities  
See http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/  for full 
prescribing information on perflutren when used according to its FDA -
approved indication.  Also see section 6.1.5. 
1.4.1 Background and Current Indications  
Definity ® (perflutren lipid) is an FDA -approved lipid- shell microbubble 
ultrasound (US) contrast agent that may be admini stered by [CONTACT_501347] (IV) bolus or infusion. Currently, this contrast agent is approved for use in patients with suboptimal echocardiograms to opacify 
the left ventricular chamber and to improve delineation of the left ventricular endocardial border. It is not approved as a contrast agent for 
acoustic angiography in the breast . 
 When used according to its approved indication, the maximum dose of 
perflut ren is administered as either two bolus doses or one single 
intravenous infusion.  
For our study, perflutren lipid will be administered intravenously by a nurse 
or trained medical personnel  (see section  4.3). 
1.4.2 Associated Toxicities  
In pre- market clinical trials 1716 subjects were evaluated with activated 
perflutren lipid. Of the 1716 subjects, 144 subjects (8.4%) had at least one treatment -related adverse reaction. There were 26 serious adverse events 
and 15 (0.9%) subjects discontinued because of an adverse event. Nineteen subjects (1.1%) suffered serious cardiopulmonary adverse events including eight deaths. The deaths occurred several days after activated perflutren lipid administration and appear to be related to the course of underlying disease. Of the [ADDRESS_759490] pain, dyspnea or back pain.

4 Adverse events (AEs) appeared within 1 – [ADDRESS_759491] common events were (% of patients experiencing): headache (2.3%), back and renal pain (1.2%), flushing (1.1%) and nausea (1.0%).  
 
Cardiopulmonary Reactions  
In 2007, in response to post -marketing reports of 4 deaths and 190 
serious cardiopulmonary reactions, the FDA issued a black box warning 
for both Definity® and Optison® adding disease state contraindications and a mandatory [ADDRESS_759492] agents. In all those s tudies a 
composite rate of serious adverse events was calculated to be 1 – 3 in 
10,000,[22] compared to gadolinium -based MRI contrast which has an 
incidence of NSF of 2 – 5 in 100 patients with chronic kidney disease.[23]  
 
Following a meeting of the FDA C ardio- renal Advisory Committee in 2008, 
the black box warning was revised. The revisions shortened the 
contraindications to include cardiac shunts and hypersensitivity to perflutren, and mandated the [ADDRESS_759493] included anaphylactoid events and other serious but non- fatal 
adverse reactions, typi[INVESTIGATOR_16195] 30 minutes of drug administration (see the package insert, and section 6.1.5  for additional information. In order to 
avoid a potentially fatal event, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_294366]® (epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) injections will be kept near the US machine for all patients.

High Ultrasound Mechanical Index (MI)  
High ultrasound MI values may cause microsphere cavitation or rupture 
and lead to ventricular arrhythmias. In addition, end- systolic triggerin g with 
high mechanical indices has been reported to cause ventricular arrhythmias.  
 
Use in Patients with Known Breast Lesions  
US contrast agents including perflutren should carry no additional risks in 
patients with  a known breast lesions, as they are cleared by [CONTACT_55964]. 
The phospholipid component of perflutren lipid microspheres are thought to be metabolized to free fatty acids, while the octafluoropropane (OFP), as a stable gas, is not metabolized. In a small (n=8) pharmacokinetic study in healthy subjects, OFP was undetectable after [ADDRESS_759494]

lesions (BIRADS 4 or 5) from the UNC Breast Clinic that consent to 
undergo an acoustic angiography in conjunction with b- mode ultrasound 
prior to their scheduled biopsy .   
 
4.2 Enrollment/Recruitment  
A total of 60 women will be enrolled to this study. The 60 study subjects 
will be consecutively recruited from women who are scheduled to undergo core needle or surgical biopsy (BIRADS 4 or 5) to have pathological confirmation of malignancy status.  Eligible patients will be identified by [CONTACT_578130].   
Once a patient has been referred, the patient will be approached by a coordinator from Radiology to assess interest in participation.  
 All eligible women  who agree to participate in the study will be asked to 
come to their scheduled biopsy appointment thirty minutes early to complete the informed consent process.   
 Review of the consent will take place in the privacy of an exam room, or when possible, a sample consent form will be sent to the patient via email prior to the patient’s visit to allow for ample review.  Once the patient has consented, women of child bearing potential (WCBP) will be given a urine pregnancy test in order to ensure that they are not pregnant.  If a urine pregnancy test shows a result positive for pregnancy, the patient will be excluded from the study per the exclusion criteria because the investigators cannot, in good conscience, expose a fetus to the contrast agent used.  Women who consent for the study and are eligible will be 
escorted by [CONTACT_560986] a dressing room, where the subject will change into a gown.  

LCCC 1405  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_578122] 26, [ADDRESS_759503] agent perflutren lipid  (see section 4.3) 
will be administered. See 
http://www.definityimaging.com/pdf/VIALMIX_Users_Guide.pdf, and the package insert, for instructions on perflutren lipid preparation and activation. Per flutren lipid is intended for intravenous (IV) administration 
only after activation in the Vialmix® apparatus.  Cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation personnel and equipment  will be readily available prior to 
perflutren administration, and all patients will be monitored for acute 
reactions.  
 
Perflutren will be administered in a single dose using a bolus 
administration.  (see http://www.definityimaging.com/how -
administration.html). Although the prescribing information allows for two 
10 uL/kg doses separated by 30 minutes, we will be administering double the package recommended dose (administering 20 uL/kg ) administered 
within 30- [ADDRESS_759504] -

study will be conducted in Mammography of the UNC Cancer Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , so 
trained medical personnel will be available as needed.  
 The initial concentration will be diluted, although the final dilution amount 
is not finalized (most likely to range from  1:1 (full dos e) to - 1:5 dilution in 
saline).  This dilution technique is still to be determined based on 
performance because this is a new type of imaging . We w ill infuse via 
hand bolus injection.  The infusion time will be approximately  30 - 60 
seconds for the dose.  
4.3.2 Acoustic Angiography Imaging Procedures  
Acoustic angiography imaging involves a research high frequency ultrasound scanner (VisualSonics Vevo 770; see section 5.0) in contrast 
imaging mode .  In addition, we may use a standard FDA -approved clinical 
ultrasound system to obtain a second  conventional B -mode ultrasound 
image as a gold standard.   Imaging will be performed within th e package 
insert guidelines for ultrasound system mechanical index (a measurement of output power) when imaging perflutren contrast agent (less than 0.8).  
 Acoustic angiography imaging will be performed by a trained medical personnel using mild compression to eliminate motion.  A linear translation 
stage will be attached to the transducer to mechanically translate the

10 transducer the imaging distance (up to approximately 3 cm).Total imaging 
time per pass  is estimated to be [ADDRESS_759505] Abstraction  
A secondary objective of this study is to q uantify the vessel tortuosity and 
develop a “ model -based malignancy score” to predict malignancy of a 
lesion based on quantitative tortuosity metrics  from the acoustic 
angiography imaging . In order to meet  this objective, we will review  each 
patient’s clinical records, including their pathology report  from biopsy .  The 
malignancy will be determined as indicated by [CONTACT_578131].   
4.6 Reader Study    
A total of five readers (radiologists trained in breast imaging) will be recruited to participate in evaluation of all imaging performed under 
LCCC1405.    
 
In the reader preference study, each reader will be asked to compare the 
acoustic angiography case to the conventional b- mode ultrasound case to 
evaluate the imaging characteristics based on the BIRADS ultrasound lexicon (http://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/PDF/QualitySafety/Resources/BIRADS/USLexiconClass.pdf). Specifically the relative ability to evaluate shape, margins and vascularity will be evaluated using a seven-point scale (-3 to +3) for the paired modality comparisons for each of the 
60 cases.  
 The data collection form for the reader study portion is given in Appendix 
A, section 13.1.  
 
The readers will be asked to assign a subjective malignancy score ( -2 
(highly not malignant) to +2  (highly malignant)) and their confidence for 
each lesion for each modality (0 to 100%).  These will also be documented 
on the form in Appendix A.  These scores will be used combined for a 
binary analysis.  Malignancy scores of +1 and +2 will be considered 
malignant.  Scores of -2, -1, and 0 will be considered not malignant.  
The confidence of malignancy will be used independently  in the analysis .

the package insert for instructions on the use of Vialmix®.  
6.1.5 Clinical Safety Summary  
See prescribing information on perflutren when used according to its FDA indication (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/), and see section 1.3 for a summary of toxicities reported in clinical trials. In addition, the following warnings and precautions are noted in the October 2011 labeling:  
 
Serious Cardiopulmonary Reactions:  
Serious cardiopulmonary reactions including fatalities have occurred 
uncommonly during or shortly following perflutren- containing microsphere 
administration, typi[INVESTIGATOR_16195] 30 minutes of administration. The risk for these reactions may be increased among patients with unstable cardiopulmonary conditions (acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary artery syndromes, worsening or unstable congestive heart failure, or serious ventricular arrhythmias). Always have cardiopulmonary resuscitation personnel and equipment readily available prior to perflutren  
administration  and monitor all patients for acute reactions.  
The reported reactions include: fatal cardiac or respi[INVESTIGATOR_13374], shock, syncope, symptomatic arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), hypertension, hypotension, dyspnea, hypoxia, chest pain, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], stridor, wheezing, loss of consciousness, and convulsions.  
 
Anaphylactoid Reactions:  
LCCC 1405  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_578122] 26, [ADDRESS_759510] -marketing use, uncommon but serious anaphylactoid reactions were 
observed during or shortly following perflutren- containing microsphere 
administration including: shock, hypersensitivity, bronchospasm, throat 
tightness, angioedema, edema (pharyngeal, palatal , mouth, peripheral, 
localized), swelling (face, eye, lip, tongue, upper airway), facial hypoesthesia, rash, urticaria, pruritus, flushing, and erythema have occurred in patients with no prior exposure to perflutren- containing 
microsphere products.  
 
Syste mic Embolization of Perflutren in Patients with Cardiac Shunts:  
In patients with right -to-left, bi -directional, or transient right -to-left cardiac 
shunts phospholipid- encapsulated microspheres can by[CONTACT_578136] -filtering mechanisms and directly enter the arterial circulation 
resulting in microvascular occlusion and ischemia. In an animal study 
utilizing intra -arterial administration of activated perflutren, microsphere 
trappi[INVESTIGATOR_578124] <15 μm, especially at branch point s 
and in capi[INVESTIGATOR_544694], including doses directly applicable to those used in humans. An animal study utilizing intravenous 15 administration did not result in arterial microvascular obstruction presumably because of filtering by [CONTACT_55964]. Do not administer perflutren 
by [CONTACT_90169]-arterial injection.  
 
High Ultrasound Mechanical Index:  
High ultrasound mechanical index values may cause microsphere 
cavitation or rupture and lead to ventricular arrhythmias. Additionally, end-systolic triggering with high mechanical indices has been reported to cause 
ventricular arrhythmias. The safety of activated perflutren at mechanical indices greater than 0.8 has not been evaluated.    
 
QTc Prolongation:  
ECG parameters for doses up to10 microL/kg were monitored in [ADDRESS_759511] bolus injection. In the 221 subjects, QTc prolongations of >30 msec were noted in 64 (29%) subjects. Forty -six out of 64 subjects with QTc prolongations 
were further evaluated and 39% (18/46) showed associated cardiac rhythm changes. The effects of concomitant drugs were not studied.

7.0 ADVERSE EXPERIENCES- DRUGS  
LCCC 1405  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_578122] 26, 2014  
16 7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., an 
abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug) in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.   
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129297] (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE.  Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable by [CONTACT_578137].  
7.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a 
reasonable possibility  that the drug is the cause.   Reasonable possibility  
means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the AE.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
 
Causali ty assessment to a study drug is a medical judgment made in 
consideration of the following factors: temporal relationship of the AE to study drug exposure, known mechanism of action or side effect profile of study treatment, other recent or concomitant drug exposures, normal clinical course of the disease under investigation, and any other underlying or concurrent medical conditions.  Other factors to consider in considering drug as the cause of the AE:  
• Single occurrence of an uncommon event known to be str ongly 
associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome)  
• One or more occurrences of an event not commonly associated with drug exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population (e.g., tendon rupture); often more tha n once occurrence from one 
or multiple studies would be needed before the sponsor could 
determine that there is reasonable possibility  that the drug caused 
the event.   
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial 
that indicates the events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group  
LCCC 1405  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_578122] 26, [ADDRESS_759513] information (e.g., 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product).  Unexpected also refers to AEs or SARs that are mentioned in 
the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.   
  
7.1.4 Serious AE or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered serious if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes : 
• Death;  
• Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred);  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (>24 hours) or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];*  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life f unctions;  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed in the definition.  For reporting purposes, also consider the occurrences of pregnancy as an event which must be reported as an important medical event.  
 *Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_578125], central line insertion, metastasis interventional therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered serious adverse events.  
 Pregnancy that occurs during the study must also be reported as an SAE.  
7.[ADDRESS_759514] begin from day 1 of 
study treatment and continue through the 30 day follow -up period after 
treatment is discontinued.   
 
Collected information should be recorded in the electronic Case Report Forms (e -CRF) for that patient.  Please include a description of the event,

18 its severity or toxicity grade, onset and resolved dates (if applicable), and 
the relationship to the study drug.    Documentation should occur at least monthly.  
7.3 SAEs or Serious SARs  
7.3.1 Timing 
After informed consent but prior to initiation of study medications, only 
SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. 
SAEs relate d to invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication 
washout, or no treatment run- in).  
 For any other experience or condition that meets the definition of an SAE or a serious SAR, recording of the event must begin from day 1 of study treatment and contin ue through the 30 day follow -up period after treatment 
is discontinued.  
7.3.2 Documentation and Notification 
These events (SAEs or Serious SARs) must be recorded for that patient 
within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.   
7.3.3 Reporting  
IRB Reporting Requirements:  
• UNC will submit an aggregated list of all SAEs to the UNC IRB annually at the time of study renewal according to the UNC IRB policies and procedures.  
• The UNC- IRB will be notified of all SAEs that qualify as an 
Unanticipated Problem as per the  UNC IRB Policies using the IRB’s 
web-based reporting system (see section  8.2 ) within 7 days of the 
Investigator becoming aware of the problem.   
Pregnancy  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on study should be recorded as SAEs.  The patient is to be discontinued immediately from the study. The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician- gynecologist, preferably one experienced in 
reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.  
 The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must document the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome). If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE.  
 
LCCC 1405  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_578122] 26, [ADDRESS_759515] (UADE)  
The investigational device exemption (IDE) regulations define an 
unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) as “any serious adverse 
effect on health or safety or any life- threatening problem or death caused 
by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare  of subjects” (21 CFR 
812.3(s)).  
8.2 Unanticipated Problems (UP)  
As defined by [CONTACT_11604]’s IRB, unanticipated problems involving risks to study 
subjects refers to any incident, experience, or outcome that:  
• Is unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related 
docum ents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
• Is related or possibly related to a subject’s participation in the research; and  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) related to the research than was previously known or recognized.

 For this device study , investigators are required to submit a report of a 
UADE to the FDA, the manufacturer of the device  and the UNC IRB as 
soon as possible, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_759517] learns of the event (§ 812.150(a)(1)), using the MedWatch Form 3500A .   Sponsors (LCCC) must immediately conduct an 
evaluation of a UADE and must report the results of the evaluation to FDA, the UNC IRB , and participating investigators within [ADDRESS_759518] (§§ 812.46(b), 812.150(b)(1)).

9.0 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_578126] i n this trial with periodic reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC).  
 Meetings/teleconferences will be held at a frequency dependent on study accrual, and in consultation with the study Biostatistician.  These meetings will include the  investigators as well as protocol nurses, clinical research 
associates, regulatory associates, data managers, biostatisticians, and any other relevant personnel the principal investigators may deem appropriate.  At these meetings, the research team will discuss all issues relevant to study progress, including enrollment, safety, regulatory, data collection, etc.  
 The team will produce summaries or minutes of these meetings. These summaries will be available for inspection when requested by [CONTACT_578138], but not limited to, the oversight (Office of Human Research Ethics (OHRE) Biomedical IRB, the Oncology Protocol Review Committee (PRC) or the North Carolina TraCS Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).   
 The UNC LCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review the study on a regular (quarterly to annually) basis, with the frequency of review based on risk and complexity as determined by [CONTACT_87228].  The UNC PI [INVESTIGATOR_578127]: 1) safety and accrual data including the number of patients treated; 2) significant developments reported in the literature that may affect the safety of participants or the ethics of the study; 3) preliminary response data; and 4) summaries of team meetings that have occurred since the last report.  Findings of the DSMC review will be disseminated by [CONTACT_87229], PRC, and the UNC IRB an d DSMB.

ultrasound), which is assumed to be 70%. (We will determine the specificity of b -mode ultrasound during the trial to confirm that the 70% 
represents the specificity in the hands of UNC radiologists)  Under the alternative, we expect that the specificity of the new device is at least 90%. The specificities are measured relative to pathological diagnosis as the reference standard. With [ADDRESS_759522] larger than 90% is 9 8% 
at the significance level 0.[ADDRESS_759523]. With 50 lesions (half are 
benign), the power to see specificity  of 90% is >96%; with 25 lesions 
(about 13 are benign), this power becomes 72%.   The power to reject the 
null hypothesis is 98%.  Although we will study both sensitivity and 
specificity, our power calculation is based on specificity, which is the primary interest.  
10.[ADDRESS_759524] error of the average sensitivity and specificity estimate will be calculated using the bootstrap method, where each patient is treated as independent unit with 5 ratings. The confidence interval of the final estimate will be provided using the norm ality 
assumption.

PI: [INVESTIGATOR_578122] 26, 2014  
22 Furthermore, we will estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the b- mode 
ultrasound in this study and compare it with the sensitivity and specificity 
estimate of the acoustic angiography device using the bootstrap approach 
and the confidence interval of their differences will be provided using the normality assumption.   
 Malignancy scores of +1 and +[ADDRESS_759525] Preference  
The secondary analysis will be to estimate the receiver operating characteristic ( sensitivity and specificity) curve for the acoustic 
angiography system, with an additional aim of evaluating reader preference for specific breast lesion characteristics.  Specifically, to compare the diagnostic performance, we will non- parametrically calculate 
the area under the ROC curve for each reader and each modality, where the ROC curve is derived using the different cut -off of the probability 
scores across [ADDRESS_759526] whether the acoustic 
angiograph has a significant larger AUC than the conventional b- mode 
ultrasound (with significance level 0.05).  
 To assess the  reader preference for modality for each characteristic 
including shape, margins and vascularity , we will fit a random effect model 
with only intercept and random terms for patients and readers while the outcomes are the confidence scores ( -3 to +3) . By [CONTACT_560995], we will conclude that the new modality provides more confidence for readers than the conventional one.  
 
Image Segmentation and Tortuosity Quantification  
In order to derive quantitative vessel tortuosity metrics for the a coustic 
angiogr aphy images, we will perform an image processing workflow. The 
de-identified DICOM images will be converted to a 3- D volume and 
linearly up- sampled using MATLAB to create isotropic [ADDRESS_759527] (ROI) for vessel analysis. Using a series of algorithms [59, 60], each vessel in the ROI will be segmented and a series of tortuosity metrics will be calculated. The vessels are segmented using semi -
automated multi -scale ridge t raversal and stored as a series of center -line 
point coordinates (x,y,z) forming a spline. The radius of the vessel is estimated at each point and saved as a fourth parameter. [14, 61] Each

based malignancy score). We will construct a receiver operator curve 
(ROC) by [CONTACT_578139]. We can then compare the performance of the quantitative tortuosity model to the reader study by [CONTACT_578140].  
11.[ADDRESS_759529] (IRB) Approval and Consent  
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance with federally mandated regulations.  The IRB should approve the consent form and protocol.  
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their 
origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
   Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. Each consent form must include all the relevant 
elements currently required by [CONTACT_44316]. Once this essential information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the implications of participating in the study, the patient will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by [CONTACT_10001] -approved consent 
form.

11.5.2 Single Patient/Subject Exceptions  
Any request to enroll a single subject who does not meet all the eligibility criteria of this study requires the approval of the UNC Princi pal 
Investigator and the UNC IRB.  
11.5.3 Other Protocol Deviations/Violations  
All other planned deviations from the protocol must have prior approval by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_65446].  According to UNC’s IRB, a protocol deviation is any unplanned variance from an IRB approved 
protocol that:  
• Is generally noted or recognized after it occurs  
• Has no substantive effect on the risks to research participants  
• Has no substantive effect on the scientific integrity of the research plan or the value of the data collected  
• Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the investigator(s).  
 
An unplanned protocol variance is considered a violation  if the variance:  
• Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more research participants.  
• Has damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the 
study.  
• Results from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the investigator(s).  
• Demonstrates serious or continuing noncompliance with federal regulations, State laws, or University polic ies. 
 If a deviation or violation occurs without prior approval from the Principal Investigator, please follow the guidelines below:  
 
Protocol Deviations: UNC personnel will keep a log of any protocol 
deviations and report them to the study sponsor or data and safety 
monitoring committee in accordance with their policies.  Deviations should be summarized and reported to the IRB at the time of continuing review.  
 Protocol Violations: Violations should be reported by [CONTACT_560998] (1) week of the investigator becoming aware of the event using the same IRB online mechanism used to report Unanticipated Problems.   
11.6 Amendments to the Protocol  
Should amendments to the protocol be required, the amendments will be originated and documented by [CONTACT_45822] [INVESTIGATOR_353190].  It should

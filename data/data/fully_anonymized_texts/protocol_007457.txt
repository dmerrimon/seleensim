15 OBJECTIVES 
The primary objectives  of this trial are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of injecting higher dose 
allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) into the native myocardium of LVAD recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. 
 
The secondary objectives  of the LVAD MPC II trial are to explore the functional and physiologic 
effects of intramyocardial injection of the higher dose MPCs in LVAD recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. 
 
BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE   
 
LVADs and Stem Cells: a Novel Strategy for Myocardial Recovery  
Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have well -documented survival and quality of life benefits 
in patients with advanced heart failure both as a bridge to cardiac transplantation (BTT) and  as a 
long-term therapy, so -called Destination Therapy (DT), in patients who are not transplant 
candidates.1-[ADDRESS_1197733] LVAD recipi[INVESTIGATOR_859460] (LV) as evidenced by [CONTACT_859557], myocyte contractile strength5, normalization of extracellular matrix and tissue and 
circulating neurohormones6, and progra ms of gene expression,7-[ADDRESS_1197734] between reverse remodeling and 
recovery of cardiac function, or “passive recovery”, have prompted our efforts to investigate 
“active recov ery” to augment ventricular recovery with adjunctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_859461], 
such as the administration of stem cells at the time of LVAD implantation.  
 
Recent pre -clinical and clinical evidence suggests that myocardial transplantation of allogeneic 
mesenchymal stem cells, in particular, can enhance cardiac performance in settings of acute and 
chronic functional impairment.12-[ADDRESS_1197735]  donor suitability in LVAD recipi[INVESTIGATOR_859462].  To this end, the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) recently conducted, 
in collaboration with the Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network (CCTRN), an 
exploratory trial of  a single low dose (25 million [M]) allogeneic MPCs (Mesoblast, Inc.) injected 
into the native myocardium at the time of LVAD implantation.  The objectives of this trial were to 
provide evidence of safety as well as explore the efficacy of the intervention .  If safety were 
established, the pre -specified plan was to conduct a follow -up trial with higher dose MPCs.  
 
Study Product: Mesenchymal Precursor Cells 
Mesoblast’s allogeneic, immunoselected, ex vivo  expanded MPCs are derived from bone marrow 
mononuclear cells, which are obtained from the posterior iliac crest of healthy human donors. The 
allogeneic MPCs are produced in a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) facility and 
cryopreserved until use. The allogeneic MPCs are a STRO-3 immuno-selected, culture-expanded, 
immature sub-fraction of adult bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells.14,17   They are formulated 
and cryopreserved in 7.5% DMSO/50% Alpha Modified Eagle’s Medium (MEM) and 42.5% 
ProFreeze® and stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen until use.  Cell procurement, 
processing, cryopreservation, and storage procedures are performed by a contract manufacturing

CONFIDENTIAL facility under GMP conditions.  Donor and process testing are conducted for transmissible 
infectious diseases, karyotype, tumorigenicity, sterility, endotoxins, and mycoplasma.  The 
product is characterized by [CONTACT_859558], viability, surface antigen expression of STRO-1, CC-9, and 
HLA class I and II.  Cryopreserved products are shipped to clinical sites for local storage, and 
cells are thawed and injected according to study procedures.  Mesoblast, Inc. contributed  its MPCs 
for the initial trial conducted and will provide them for this current trial (see section on Study 
Administration).  Further information on manufacturing and product characterization is presented 
in the Investigator’s Brochure.   
 
Pre-Clinical Studies   
An extensive nonclinical program has been conducted to explore and confirm the safety and 
efficacy of administration of allogeneic MPCs for the treatment of patients with ischemic or 
nonischemic heart disease and heart failure. Mesenchymal precursor cells have been evaluated in 
vitro as well as in vivo in nonclinical studies with rodents and sheep (acute and chronic 
myocardial ischemia and doxorubicin-induced nonischemic cardiomyopathy). 
 
Results from several in vitro studies, which included mixed lymphocyte cultures and T-cell 
proliferation assays, demonstrated that immunoselected and culture-expanded MPCs are 
nonimmunogenic in allogeneic settings and demonstrate immunosuppressive activity. 
 
In nude rat models of myocardial ischemia, implantation of allogeneic MPCs into the acutely 
ischemic myocardium was associated with arteriogenesis at 2 weeks following administration of 
MPCs and improvement in global parameters of systolic and diastolic function at both 2 and 
6 weeks after implantation.  
 
The ovine models of chronic ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy (CM) demonstrated a 
dose-related improvement in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) (ischemic model) and prevention of deterioration of LVEF and 
stabilization of ventricular remodeling (nonischemic model) with transendomyocardial delivery of 
allogeneic ovine MPCs. In contrast, the control groups for the chronic ischemic and nonischemic 
ovine models of CM showed time-related worsening of critical cardiac parameters. 
Cell-tracking studies have shown that less than 1% of injected human MPCs persist at [ADDRESS_1197736] can be 
delivered safely by [CONTACT_859559][INVESTIGATOR_660119], transendocardial injection by [CONTACT_13988], and

Clinical Studies of Cell-based Myocardial Repair   
Mesoblast is conducting several clinical trials involving the administration of allogeneic MPCs by 
a number of routes and in various cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular indications. 
 
As of [ADDRESS_1197740] been well tolerated 
in dose ranges of up to 246 Million (M) allogeneic cells.   
 
The adverse events reported in these studies have been generally mild to moderate in severity.  
Across all indications evaluated, the most frequently reported adverse events that occurred at a 
rate of > 5% in the combined MPC treatment group and higher than controls, were chest pain 
(7.1% vs. 5.5%), fatigue (6.0% vs. 5.5%), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (6.6% vs. 2.2%), neck 
pain (5.5% vs. 4.4%), dizziness (7.1% vs. 2.2%) and hypotension (7.7% vs. 2.2%). There has been 
no dose-limiting toxicity observed to date.  In all studies to date, antibody responses to MPC

CONFIDENTIAL donor-specific HLA have been observed in approximately 10-15% of treated patients.  No clinical 
events or adverse sequelae have been attributed to this sensitization to date.  
 
Based on review of cumulative and aggregate safety data to date the systemic safety and local 
tolerability of MPCs has been acceptable. 
 
The allogeneic MPCs used in each of the ongoing studies are identical with respect to 
manufacturing, characterization and lot release testing.

Safety Considerations 
In pre-clinical animal studies, it has been found that less than 5-10% of stem cells applied directly 
to the myocardium engraft and remain long-term at this site. The other cells either die through 
apoptosis or disseminate systemically through the circulation, and can be found in the spleen, 
liver, bone marrow and other organs.  Consequently, any stem cell treatment that is delivered to 
the native heart of an LVAD recipi[INVESTIGATOR_859466], 
potentially resulting in direct exposure of the injected stem cells to biomaterials on the LVAD 
surface.   
 
No patients in the initial CTSN LVAD/MPC trial, evaluating 25 million MPCs in LVAD 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], experienced any of the key safety endpoints, defined as infectious myocarditis, 
myocardial rupture, neoplasm, hypersensitivity reaction, and immune sensitization syndrome.  
While there were three deaths (30%) in the control group and none in the MPC group at 90 days, 6 
MPC patients (30%) died over the 12 months, such that the 12 month mortality rates were 
identical between groups.  The serious adverse event rates seen in the initial trial were similar 
between the MPC and control groups at both 90 days and 12 months, and the AE profiles were 
consistent with those seen in the LVAD population. 18  
 
Importantly, the initial CTSN trial (n=30) demonstrated safety with regard to allosensitization. Of 
patients randomized to the MPC group, 10% developed donor specific antibodies (DSA) 
compared to 30% of the control group, and DSA resolved by [ADDRESS_1197741]’s allogeneic MPCs 
manufactured under identical conditions as contemplated in the present study (150 million) have 
been safely administered  although not in this particular patient population .  
 
Rationale for Selection of the Efficacy Endpoint   
The field of mechanical circulatory support, particularly in the context of evaluating myocardial 
function and recovery in the setting of adjunctive interventions, remains nascent.  Standard heart 
failure efficacy endpoints such as [ADDRESS_1197742] (6MWT ), NYHA class or HF 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], are of limited use in this population because of the presence of the LVAD itself 
and the physiologic state of off-loading the left ventricle.  I t is becoming increasingly accepted 
clinical practice, however, to periodically evaluate the ability of LVAD recipi[INVESTIGATOR_859467] a 
temporary wean from LVAD support and to assess their functional capacity off support for 
evidence of myocardial recovery.  LVAD explantation, however, regardless of the results of the 
wean assessments, remains rare.  Whereas the initial CTSN LVAD/MPC trial was designed 
primarily to assess the safety of intramyocardial injection of MPCs in LVAD recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], the 
secondary objectives were selected to explore a clinically meaningful effect of the intervention 
within the constraints imposed by [CONTACT_859560].  The current 
assumption remains that the most meaningful cardiac assessments in LVAD patients are those 
performed on little or no LVAD support.  Accordingly, the key efficacy outcome for initial CTSN 
InCHOIR    Date Written: March 2015 
Document Number: LVAD MPC II Trial Protocol Rev 4.1  Date Revised: October 2016 
Page 21 of 68  Date Effective:  
 
CONFIDENTIAL LVAD/MPC trial was defined as the ability to tolerate a wean from LVAD support for 30 minutes.  
The utility of the ability to tolerate a wean as a predictor of long-term recovery has yet to be 
established, however, it is generally accepted that those unable to tolerate a wean (in the absence 
of non-cardiac causes) have persistent and profound cardiac debilitation.   The preliminary trial 
ex
perience, however, demonstrated that non-cardiac factors, such as intermittent bleeding which 
may prompt clinical decisions to avoid adjusting anticoagulation necessary for the safety of a 
wean, impact the ability to wean from non-cardiac causes at a particular time point.  In order to 
mitigate the impact of the inability to tolerate the wean at a single time point for non-cardiac 
causes, the primary efficacy endpoint selected for this next trial is the number of weans tolerated 
over [ADDRESS_1197743] on reverse remodeling, and explore alternative predictors of myocardial 
recovery.  
 
The clinical management of the patients enrolled in the trial will be based on the judgment of the 
multidisciplinary heart failure and transplant teams, and not on the results of the study-related 
evaluations.  It is increasingly accepted, however, that the ability to tolerate a wean is influenced 
by [CONTACT_859561], including aggressive off-loading of the LV.  
As such, guidance for optimal medical therapy on LVAD support is included in this protocol. 
 
Rationale for Dose Selection 
Given that the initial LVAD/MPC trial did not demonstrate any safety concerns, including 
allosensitization, the Network investigators decided to proceed, as originally planned, with the 
follow-up trial in a larger cohort of patients.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_859468], a potential efficacy signal was observed in that a greater proportion of MPC patients 
experienced successful temporary weans at [ADDRESS_1197744] of the pre-clinical studies was a dose escalation study in a sheep model of 
ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) with progressive HF.  The results indicated that transendocardial 
delivery of allogeneic MPCs was safe.  Progressive deterioration of cardiac function and LV 
remodeling were prevented in the high-dose MPC (225 M) treatment group, but not in the lower-
dose MPC (75 M and 25 M) groups and the control group.  The second pre-clinical evaluation of 
transendocardial delivery of MPCs (mean ±SD, 109x106±5x106 cells per animal) in a sheep HF 
model demonstrated improvement in LV systolic function, stabilization of left ventricular 
remodeling, and histologic improvements in the non-ischemic cardiomyopathic left ventricle.  The 
burden of fibrosis was lower after transendocardial delivery of MPCs compared to the placebo 
arm, although it was still greater than that found in normal healthy sheep hearts.

CONFIDENTIAL  
In addition to the results from the animal studies, the dose of [ADDRESS_1197745] trial enrolled 60 patients with chronic systolic heart failure and 
randomized them to 25 M, 75 M, or 150 M MPCs dose cohorts (patients were randomized 3:1, 
MPC to control within each cohort). A blinded post-hoc analysis of the data was performed to 
evaluate the HF-major adverse cardiac event (HF-MACE) rate, defined as cardiac death, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859469], or successful resuscitation of documented ventricular 
fibrillation. The analysis demonstrated that the [ADDRESS_1197746]-hoc HF-MACE outcomes were consistent with the outcomes observed with the 
pre-specified endpoint assessments, including 6MWT, left ventricular end systolic volume 
(LVESV), and left ventricular end diastolic volumes (LVEDV).  These surrogate endpoints have 
previously been associated with clinical outcomes and have been demonstrated to correlate with 
morbidity and/or mortality in patients with chronic HF due to LV systolic dysfunction. Kramer et 
al., for example, demonstrated a significant correlation between long-term clinical outcomes and 
the shorter term changes in LVESV, LVEDV and LV ejection fraction (LVEF).[ADDRESS_1197747] in LVESV and LVEDV reported 
in the 150 M MPC group would be associated with an approximate 20-30% relative risk reduction 
in HF-MACE. Changes from baseline LVESV and LVEDV observed were consistent with 
clinically meaningful reverse remodeling (improvement) in the 150M dose cohort.  No significant 
changes in LVEF were observed in any of the dose treatment groups over time.  
 
Compared with control patients, the [ADDRESS_1197748] improvement in exercise 
capacity as assessed by [CONTACT_941] 6MWT at 6 and 12 months.  The control-corrected change from 
baseline at 12 months (52.5 meters; P=0.062) exceeded the 30-meter value considered to be 
clinically important. While Opasich and colleagues concluded that “when the 6-MWT is used as 
an end-point in intervention studies, the clinical relevance of the results must be considered 
cautiously if the variation in distance is less than 10% in individuals even though the results are 
statistically significant”20, the treatment effect of 14.5% (52.5 m) observed in the Mesoblast HF-
AB002 trial surpasses the 10% threshold considered clinically relevant. 
 
In aggregate, the concordance of results observed for these three important efficacy outcomes (i.e., 
HF-MACE, LV remodelling, and exercise capacity) indicate that the [ADDRESS_1197749]’s experience, the current protocol will evaluate a single dose of 150 million 
MPCs in LVAD recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].

TREATMENT ASSIGNMENTS 
Patients will be enrolled in a single dose cohort and randomized in a 2 :[ADDRESS_1197756] or control (cryoprotective media alone  [sham 
procedure]) at the time of LVAD implantation: 
 
Group 1 (n= 106):  150 million allogeneic MPCs (Mesoblast, Inc )  
Group 2 (n= 53): 50% Alpha-MEM/42.5% ProFreeze NAO Freezing Medium/7.5% 
DMSO (Control) 
 
RANDOMIZATION   
Patients will be enrolled in a single dose cohort and randomized in a 2 :[ADDRESS_1197757] (MPC) or cryoprotective media alone (Control), 
during LVAD implantation.  Randomization will take place only after it has been determined that 
all study eligibility criteria have been met.  LVAD implantation and study intervention must be 
administered within [ADDRESS_1197758] the trial.  
The syringes, once prepared will appear identical for both groups.  Site personnel and patients, as 
well all core lab study personnel will be blinded to treatment assignment throughout the trial.    
TREATMENT INTERVENTION 
 
Treatment intervention (and LVAD implantation) must occur within 24 hours following 
randomization.  The treatment intervention will be performed in the following manner:  
 
Four [ADDRESS_1197759] (MPC or Control ) will be thawed and prepared as detailed in the Study Product 
Technician Manual of Procedures (MOP).  The injection process should take place within [ADDRESS_1197760].  A total of 16 -20 epi[INVESTIGATOR_859470] 0.2 mL

CONFIDENTIAL each (not to exceed a total of 4 .0 mL) will be performed as detailed in Appendix I.  Injections 
should target as much left ventricular myocardium as possible, as suggested in the diagram below 
(Figure 1). The location of each injection delivered will be documented on the Intervention 
Injection Verification Case Report Form (CRF) by [CONTACT_859567].  See the 
Study Product Technician MOP for detailed study product (MPC or Control) handling and 
preparation.  See Appendix I (Intramyocardial Injection Procedures) for the injection procedures. 
 
Of note, study product thawed longer than [ADDRESS_1197761] be discarded. 
 
LVAD IMPLANT AND MANAGEMENT  
Any permanent surgically implanted non-pulsatile LVAD approved by [CONTACT_859568]-stage heart failure may be implanted at the discretion of the 
surgeon for patients enrolled in this trial.  NOTE:  Only FDA-approved LVADs will be utilized at 
US sites, and only Health Canada-approved LVADs will be utilized at Canadian sites.  
Implantation and management  will be performed according to the Directions for Use for the 
specific LVAD.  Long term LVAD management should include optimization of hemodynamic 
off-loading of the left ventricle to target: (1) reduction of LVEDd to 5.5-6 cm; (2) reduction of 
mitral regurgitation to, at most, mild regurgitation; and (3) reduction in mean blood pressure to < 
100 mmHg.

DEFINITION AND MEASUREMENT OF ENDPOINTS  
 
Primary Endpoint s 
 
The Primary Safety Endpoint   
The primary safety  endpoint of this study is the incidence of potential study intervention-related 
adverse events, defined as (a) infectious myocarditis, (b) myocardial rupture, (c) neoplasm, (d) 
hypersensitivity reaction, and (e) immune sensitization syndrome, will be determined.   Posterior View

Page 28 of 68  Date Effective:  
 
CONFIDENTIAL The Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy  endpoint of this study is functional status, defined by [CONTACT_859569] [ADDRESS_1197762] randomization.  A successful 
wean is the ability to tolerate temporary weaning from LVAD support for 30 minutes without 
susta
ined symptoms of worsening heart failure.  Wean failures are defined as follows: 
o Inability to tolerate the temporary wean for 30 minutes;  
o Death;  
o Patient too unstable, in the judgment of the primary heart failure cardiologist, to tolerate 
the wean attempt (in ICU,  on inotropic support or having persistent heart failure symptoms 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_859471]).   
 
LVAD weans will be performed at 60 days and at 4 and 6  months (or until transplant, whichever 
comes first).  
 
LVAD Wean 
The continuous flow LVAD wean guidance was adopted from the Harefield Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859472]. Emma Birks.   
 
Non-pulsatile LVAD (e.g., HM II, HVADTM) Weaning Guidelines : Patients with an INR < 2.[ADDRESS_1197763] 5 
minutes prior to reducing the pump speed.  The LVAD flow will then be reduced as detailed in the 
CTSN LVAD MPC II Trial LVAD Wean Procedure Guidelines, which are located in the LVAD 
MPC II MOP.  Blood pressure measurements will be taken prior to wean and monitored 
throughout the wean.   
 
Early termination of LVAD Wean   
The guidelines for early termination of device turn down during echocardiography and the 6MWT 
dictate that the LVAD will be returned to full LVAD flow if the patient develops persistent signs 
or symptoms of low output or vascular congestion as determined by [CONTACT_859570].  Signs and symptoms may include: light headedness, dyspnea, fatigue, chest 
pain, or pulmonary edema.   
 
Based on the collective experience of its multi-center international collaborators and experience 
for the first CTSN LVAD MPC Trial, an absolute change in blood pressure alone, in the absence 
of the clinical signs and symptoms listed above, will not necessitate terminating the LVAD wean. 
 
Secondary Endpoints 
 
Safety   
The following additional secondary endpoints will be assessed for all patients  (including those 
who do not tolerate LVAD wean):  
 
Serious & Study-Intervention Related Adverse Events 
The incidence of potential study intervention -related adverse events , defined as (a) infectious 
myocarditis, (b) myocardial rupture, (c) neoplasm, (d) hypersensitivity reaction, and (e) 
immune sensitization  syndr ome, will be determined.  In addition , the incidence and frequency 
InCHOIR    Date Written: March 2015 
Document Number: LVAD MPC II Trial Protocol Rev 4.1  Date Revised: October 2016 
Page 29 of 68  Date Effective:  
 
CONFIDENTIAL of all anticipated and unanticipated serious adverse events will be determined.  Moreover, the 
incidence of all adverse events classified by [CONTACT_859571] “possibly” or “probably” study -intervention related (to either the 
study product or to the intramyocardial injection procedure i tself) will be determined.  See 
Causality and Expected Serious Adverse Event sections that follow.   The study intervention -
related events  above, or mortality in excess of rates expected for the BTT and DT LVAD 
populations will trigger cessation of enrollme nt (see Statistical Analysis Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_571701]).  
 
Anti-HLA Antibody Sensitization  
The incidence of anti-HLA antibody sensitization will be measured by [CONTACT_859572]-study intervention, and will be compared among 
groups.  Immune reactivity results for % IgG Class I  and IgG Class II, will be assessed.  All 
measurements will be performed by [CONTACT_859573] (See the LVAD  MPC  II MOP 
for details ). 
 
Overall Survival & Survival to Cardiac Transplantation 
Overall survival and survival to cardiac transplant (in the BTT patients enrolled) will be assessed 
and compared between groups. 
 
The following secondary endpoints will be assessed during the temporary LVAD wean from full 
support for patients able to tolerate the wean: 
 
Functional Status  (over 6 months and over 12 months) 
Ability to Tolerate Wean from LVAD Support for 30 Minutes  
The ability to tolerate the temporary wean from full LVAD support to target low flow for 30 minutes 
will be assessed at 60 days and at 4, 6,  9 & 12  months, and will be compared between groups.  See 
LVAD MPC II MOP for LVAD Wean Procedure Guidelines.   
 
Duration of Ability to Tolerate Wean 
The duration of ability to tolerate wean from LVAD support will be measured until the patient:  
(a) Reaches 30 minutes at target low speed LVAD support, and  
(b) Completes the echo and 6MWT (if this takes longer than 30 minutes and the patient 
remains stable), or  
(c) Requires early termination of device turn down (e.g., during echocardiography and/or the 
6MWT ) and resumption of LVAD at full support, for persistent signs or symptoms of low 
output or vascular congestion as determined by [CONTACT_859574].  
Signs and symptoms may include: light headedness, dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, or 
pulmonary edema.  
 
These signs and symptoms will be assessed at each time point post intervention.

CONFIDENTIAL Timeline of Functional Assessments Completed During LVAD Wean:   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The LVAD wean will continue until the patient (a) reaches 30 minutes at low target speed of  
LVAD support and completes the functional assessments, or (b) fails the wean.  The LVAD will 
then be increased to the pre -wean (baseline) full support . 
 
[ADDRESS_1197764]  
The total distance walked in six minutes will be assessed.  For those who tolerate the LVAD 
wean, the 6MWT will be performed immediately following the 15 minute full echo assessment 
(at 20 (± 10) minutes following initiation of wean).  The distance will be measured (in feet), 
regardless of the number of times stopped or the rate of ambulation.  The 6MWT instructions 
are detailed in the LVAD MPC II MOP. 
 
Weaning And 6-Minute Walk Schedule : 60 days, 4 mos, 6 mos, 9 mos, and 12 mos (or until 
transplant, whichever comes first). 
  
Physiologic Assessments 
 
Echocardiographic Assessments of Myocardial Function  
Echocardiographic parameters (refer to the LVAD MPC II MOP) will be assessed at each 
wea
n assessment time point at (a) baseline with the LVAD on full support  prior to wean, (b) 
15 minutes following initiation of wean from LVAD support (while LVAD flow remains 
weaned), and (c) immediately following the 6MWT, as tolerated by [CONTACT_102].    
 
Echocardiograms will be read by [CONTACT_361872].  The following values will 
be calculated from the measurements: left ventricular fractional shortening, left ventricular 
mass by [CONTACT_859575] (only full support, comprehensive echo study).  Regional 
wall motion assessment will be performed using the American Society of Echocardiography 
scoring system, modified to exclude the 4 api[INVESTIGATOR_859473].  Therefore, 12 segments (basal and mid-ventricular segments) 
will be utilized instead of 16.

ventricular segments) will be utilized instead of 16. 
o RV function (normal, mild, moderate, severe)by [CONTACT_859564]  
o RV systolic pressure (RVSP) from tricuspid regurgitation jet  
 
The following secondary endpoints will be assessed in ALL patients,  unrelated  to the ability to 
tolerate the temporary wean from LVAD support:  
 
Neovascularization and Cardiomyocyte Proliferation 
Myocardium from the api[INVESTIGATOR_859475], if applicable, will be 
categorized with regard to region, including anterior, anterolateral, lateral, inferior, 
midventricular and basilar specimens.  All samples will be evaluated for neovascularization, 
quantification of cardiomyocyte proliferation by [CONTACT_859576], 
general histology, and DNA analysis (Detailed in the LVAD MPC II MOP).  
 
Cell Engraftment and Fate  
Myocardium from multiple samples taken at the time of explant for cardiac transplantation or 
any other indication, if applicable, will be evaluated for cell engraftment.  Relative number of 
donor cells in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_859476]-DRB alleles different from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_859477]. 
(Detailed in LVAD MPC II MOP ). 
 
QoL and Neurocognition 
Quality of life data will be collected and evaluated as a secondary endpoint.  Quality of life will be 
assessed with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), a widely used tool in 
heart failure populations, and the Short Form 12 (SF12), a widely used overall health status 
measure (refer to the LVAD MPC II MOP for questionnaires).  QoL will be compared between 
treatment groups at 6 months (±14) and 12 months (±14 days) post randomization. 
 
Neurocognition will be compared between treatment groups at 90 (±14) days and 12 months (±14 
days) post randomization, but not during LVAD wean.  Cognitive performance will be assessed 
using the following battery of tests: Hopkins Verbal Learning Test; Trailmaking Tests A and B; 
MCG Complex Figures; Digit Span; Digit Symbol Substitution Test; and Controlled Oral Word 
Association (refer to the LVAD MPC II MOP).  Neurocognitive testing will be administered by

CONFIDENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS   
An adverse event is any unfavorable, harmful or pathological change in the health of a research 
subject.  It may be indicated by [CONTACT_30597], symptoms, clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities, and/or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical (investigational) 
treatment, procedure, or product, whether or not related to the medical (investigational) treatment, 
procedure, or product.  This definition includes inter-current illnesses, injuries, exacerbations of 
pre-existing conditions and events occurring as a result of product abuse or overdose.  Stable pre-
existing conditions and elective procedures to address such conditions are not adverse events.  A 
change in a laboratory variable is considered an adverse event if it leads to a change in the 
patient’s functional status, or is considered by [CONTACT_859582] (or may have caused) the investigator to reduce or discontinue the use of the product 
or to institute therapy.  
 
All investigators conducting clinical studies supported by [CONTACT_859583] (DCC) and their individual 
Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Research Ethics Boards ( REBs) in compliance with their 
institutional policies.   
 
All protocol-defined and serious adverse events will be collected from the time of randomization 
into this trial until induction of anesthesia for cardiac transplant or [ADDRESS_1197766].  Any condition that was pre-existing is not an adverse event unless there is a change in the 
nature, severity or degree of the condition.  In addition, information regarding the occurrence of 
the events that trigger the Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_859483], and their 
absence will be confirmed at each study visit.   
 
Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_859484] a halt to enrollment.  These events include: 
infectious myocarditis, myocardial rupture, neoplasm, hypersensitivity reaction, and immune 
sensitization syndrome.   (See Statistical Analysis Section, Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]). 
 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_859485].  All patient 
identifiers will be removed from the source documents, and will be replaced with the patient’s 
study identification number.  
 
Serious Adverse Events 
Serious adverse events are defined as any experience that results in a fatality or is life threatening; 
results in significant or persistent disability; requires or prolongs a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; results in a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect; or represents other significant hazards or potentially serious harm 
to research subjects or others, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_7372]. Important medical events that 
may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious 
adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.  Examples of such medical events include bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

CONFIDENTIAL Unexpected serious adverse events are defined as any experience that has not been described in 
the package insert for a given product/device or investigator’s brochure, protocol, or the informed 
consent document.  Expedited reporting is required for serious adverse events that are unexpected.  
  
Expedited Reporting (Procedure for Reporting Serious Adverse Events) 
Protocol defined (expected) and unexpected serious adverse events, as well as all events that 
trigger the Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869], must be reported to the DCC and entered into the electronic data 
capture (EDC) system within [ADDRESS_1197767] 
be reported to the respective IRB/ REB in accordance with the clinical center’s policies.  The D CC 
will notify the NHLBI program officials of any unexpected serious adverse events (including 
death),  and events that trigger the Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869],  via e-mail within 24 hours of receipt of 
the event.  The DCC will report all expected deaths (regardless of relationship to intervention), as 
well as all adverse events that are unexpected,  serious and intervention-related to the NHLBI 
program officials within [ADDRESS_1197768] semi-annually at the discretion of the DCC medical monitor.  The IND Sponsor will 
promptly upon discovery, report serious and unexpected adverse event s for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the cell therapy (i.e., study product and/or injection procedure) caused 
the events,  to the FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 regulations and ICH E2A guidelines.  
The Clinical Trial Application (CTA) Sponsor will also inform Health Canada, in an expedited 
manner, of any serious unexpected adverse drug reaction that has occurred inside or outside 
Canada in accordance with Canadian Food and Drug Regulations Division 5, Section C.05.014. 
 
Causality   
The investigator will assess the relationship of an adverse event to the treatment intervention.  If 
possible, the investigator should distinguish the relationship between the event and (a) the LVAD 
implant and (b) the investigational intervention.  Causality will be defined as follows :  
 
Probable 
Adverse events that, after careful medical evaluation, are considered with a high degree of 
certainty to be related to the LVAD implant  or investigational  intervention .  The following 
characteristics will apply:  
o A reasonable temporal relationship exists between the event and the L VAD implant  or 
investigational  intervention, and  
o The event is a known reaction to the L VAD implant  or investigational  intervention, which 
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_587600] c ommonly occurring in the 
population/individual.  
 
Possible 
Adverse events that, after careful medical evaluation, do not meet the criteria for a probable 
relationship to the L VAD implant  or investigational  intervention , but for which a connection has 
reasonable  certainty. The following characteristics will apply:  
 
o The event occurs after exposure to the L VAD implant  or investigational  intervention , and  
o The event is not a known reaction to the L VAD implant  or investigational  intervention but 
cannot  be ex plained by a commonly occurring alternative etiology, or

CONFIDENTIAL o In the absence of a temporal relationship, the event cannot reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_859584].  
 
Unlikely  
Adverse events that, after careful medical evaluation, do not meet the criteria for a possible or 
probable relationship to the L VAD implant  or investigational  intervention  and for which a 
connection is unlikely  but cannot be ruled out . The following charac teristics will apply:  
o The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the L VAD 
implant  or investigational  intervention , or 
o May be explained by a commonly occurring alternative etiology in the population/individual, 
or 
o May have been produced by [CONTACT_80238], and there is no apparent pattern of 
response to the L VAD implant  or investi gational  intervention . 
 
Expected Serious Adverse Events 
There are certain known and expected risks associated with products that are used in the 
production of MPCs.  These risks include: 
 
Reaction to Fetal Calf Serum or Murine Mouse Antibody 
For immunoselection of the allogeneic MPCs, the technology incorporates an antibody 
based  sorting process using murine derived antihuman antibody. In the cell expansion 
process, fetal calf  serum is used. The risk of sensitization from this formulation is 
unknown, but expected to be extremely rare.  
 
Reaction to Dimethyl Sulfoxide 
Dimethyl sulfoxide 7.5% is used as part of the MPCs cryopreservation process. The 
therapeutic and toxic effects of DMSO include its own rapid penetration and enhanced 
penetration of other substances across biologic membranes, free radical scavenging, and 
effects on coagulation, anticholinesterase activity, and DMSO-induced histamine release 
by [CONTACT_157066]. The systemic toxicity of DMSO is considered to be low. The DMSO 
exposure in this therapy is minimal and is locally applied.  
 
Potential Cell Contamination 
MPCs are an allogeneic, immunoselected, ex vivo expanded cell product, which has the 
potential to become contaminated and subsequently cause infection in the study patient at 
the time of surgical implantation. This risk is greatly minimized by [CONTACT_2224] a Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant production facility. As with any blood or 
marrow-derived biological agent, infectious risks from unknown pathogens are possible. 
 
Potential Inflammatory Responses 
The addition of allogeneic MPCs may exacerbate local inflammatory responses resulting 
from the allogeneic exposure to the MPC donor.  The risks of exposure are unknown but 
will be monitored throughout the study duration. If sensitivity occurs, persistent expression 
of anti-HLA antibodies could limit subsequent allogeneic transplant donor selection. 
Subjects will be monitored for these responses by [CONTACT_859585]-up visits.

CONFIDENTIAL  
Possible Effects of Cells on Fetus 
Because of potential or unknown side effects of the study on the fetus, if the patient is a 
female of childbearing potential, the patient must have a negative serum pregnancy test 
prior to study entry. In the event that the study patient is confirmed to be pregnant during 
the study, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_859486] ’s 
Medical Monitor about the pregnancy and record it on the Adverse Event CRF. In 
addition, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_859487]-up information 
regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Infants 
should be observed and monitored through the first year of life.  
 
LVAD-related adverse events in this study will collect data using updated definitions consistent 
with the INTERMACS registry definitions to enable standardization by [CONTACT_859586].

(MCSD) system ceases to operate to its designed performance specifications or otherwise fails to 
perform as intended. Performance specifications include all claims made in the Instructions for 
Use for the device.  
 
Device malfunctions  are defined as major or minor : 
 
1. Major device malfunction, otherwise known as failure, occurs when one or more of the 
components of the MCSD system either directly causes or could potentially induce a state 
of inadequate circulatory support (low cardiac output state) or death. A failure that was 
iatrogenic or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]-induced will be classified as an Iatrogenic/Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]-Inducted

does not apply to “routine” maintenance which includes repair/replacement of external 
controller, pneumatic drive unit, electric power supply unit, batteries, interconnect cable. 
 
Pump Thrombus  represents a special case of major device malfunction and will be classified as 
“Suspected” based upon clinical, biochemical, or hemodynamic findings or “Confirmed” based 
upon device inspection or incontrovertible radiologic studies or absence of appropriate Doppler 
flow signals that confirms thrombus within the device or its conduits that results in or could 
potentially induce circulatory failure.  
 
o Suspected pump thrombus  is a pump-related malfunction in which clinical MCSD 
parameters suggest thrombus on the blood contact[CONTACT_785606], 
cannulae, or grafts. Signs and symptoms should include at least 2 of the 3 following 
criteria: 
 Presence of hemolysis  
 Presence of heart failure not explained by [CONTACT_859588]  
 Abnormal pump parameters  
Suspected pump thrombus should be accompanied by 1 or more of the following 
events or interventions: 
 Treatment with intravenous anticoagulation (e.g., heparin), intravenous 
thrombolytics (e.g., tPA) or intravenous antiplatelet therapy (e.g., eptifibatide, 
tirofiban) 
 Pump replacement 
 Pump explantation 
 Urgent transplantation (UNOS 1A)

DATA MANAGEMENT 
In order to capture the highest quality data, we will use a web-based system with electronic 
validation.  In addition, we will cross-validate the data for complex errors.  Ongoing review of 
data collection by [CONTACT_15780]. 
 
Electronic Data Capture 
All study data will be entered in the electronic data capture (EDC) system. Study personnel 
requiring access will have their own Login/Password. Access to clinical study information will be 
based on individuals' roles and responsibilities.  The application employs fine-grained role-based 
access control for data entry, viewing, and reporting options. All study data will be transmitted 
over an encrypted SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connection that requires user authentication.  This 
application is designed to be in full compliance with the International Conference on 
Harmonization and Good Clinical Practices (ICH-GCP), the FDA’s Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) [ADDRESS_1197789] and Electronic Signatures, the FDA's "Guidance: 
Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Trials,” and the Privacy Rule of the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  
 
EDC supports efficient data collection and management and facilitates rapid data closure. A strong 
advanta ge of web-based design is that the DCC has immediate and ongoing access to the data 
from all clinical centers so that queries can be generated and distributed to the sites in real-time, 
the frequency of missing data can be reduced by [CONTACT_15781], the coordinators will receive a 
list of queries generated by [CONTACT_15782], and any data required 
during a visit is immediately evident through the system and can be collected before closure of the 
visit window.  The EDC will be a vital part of the centralized monitoring planned for this study. 
 
Monitoring   
The DCC will employ a risk-based approach to monitoring for this study.  This will be 
accomplished via centralized or remote monitoring of data via the EDC with a focus on safety, 
study endpoints, data completion and data outliers.  Clinical centers will provide source 
documentation (with patient-identifying information redacted) to the DCC for remote monitoring 
via upload to the EDC or remote access to electronic medical records.  The DCC will also 
centrally monitor study logs including the Informed Consent Log, the Protocol 
Violation/Deviation Log and the Serious Adverse Event/IND Safety Report Log periodically to 
ensure that the sites are adhering to the study protocol and procedures. The DCC will generate 
performance metrics to analyze site characteristics such as recruitment rates and timeliness of data 
entry.  This will allow the DCC to identify trends across sites and to address low-performing sites 
appropriately.

CONFIDENTIAL The DCC will also perform on -site monitoring visits at each study site at least once a year.   The 
monitoring visits will be an opportunity to verify a minimum of the following data points for all 
patients:  age, sex, signed informed consent, eligibility criteria, medical history, date of 
enrollment, protocol-defined serious adverse events (SAEs) and mortalities.  The monitors will 
also conduct a review of the regulatory documents for the study. 
 
The frequency of site visits will be based on the following considerations:  
o The first monitoring visit will be scheduled soon after the first patient has been enrolled. 
o Routine visits will be scheduled based upon enrollment rate, site experience, previous 
performance and information collected via centralized monitoring.  
o Additional visits are scheduled as needed to resolve study-related problems including 
query resolution. 
o The DCC will conduct close-out activities with each site as an on-site visit or via 
teleconference. 
 
The primary objectives of the DCC are to educate, support, identify and resolve issues related to 
the clinical trial.  The monitors will discuss the protocol in detail, and clarify any areas of 
uncertainty.  At initiation of the study, the monitors will conduct a tutorial on the EDC system.  
The coordinators will practice entering data so that the monitors can confirm that the coordinators 
are proficient in all aspects of data entry, query response, and communication with the data 
management team.  
 
Through the combination of centralized and on-site monitoring, the EDC system, instantaneous 
electronic validation, and visual cross-validation by [CONTACT_15783], it is 
anticipated that the best possible quality and most complete data will be collected.  
 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION    
The primary aims of this trial are determining safety and potential efficacy of MPC therapy at the 
studied dose. Safety will be based on the absence of all of the following: infectious myocarditis, 
myocardial rupture, neoplasm, hypersensitivity reaction, and immune sensitization; and on 
mortality.  Efficacy will be based on measuring functional status; the number of successful 
temporary weans achieved out of three planned over the first six months of follow-up.  Patients 
who expi[INVESTIGATOR_859510], or whose morbidity precludes assessment, will be considered 
weaning failures.  Few patients are expected to undergo cardiac transplantation prior to the 
primary endpoint assessment, but if they do, they will be censored at the time of transplant.  For 
patients who undergo cardiac transplantation, the incidence rate of successful weans will be 
calculated as the number of successful weans out of the number of weans performed over the time 
of follow-up until transplantation. The information fraction contributed by [CONTACT_859606]-up time until transplantation.   
 
A Bayesian approach based on the posterior distribution that active therapy is superior to control 
will be used to assess the strength of potential efficacy, should safety continue to be demonstrated.  
The procedure will be carried out as follows.

CONFIDENTIAL A binomial likelihood is specified for the 
primary efficacy outcome, the number of 
successful weans out of the three planned 
(or the number attempted).  The reasons to 
have fewer than the planned number of 
weans include cardiac transplantation, 
patient refusal, or missed visit due to 
logistical obstacles.  All patients considered 
too unstable to tolerate the wean attempt 
(e.g., patient in the ICU or on inotropic 
support) in the judgment of the primary 
heart failure cardiologist are considered a 
wean failure.  The prior distribution for the 
success probability of the binomial 
likelihood is based on data from the control 
patients in the previous trial, where the rate 
of successful wean was found to be 
approximately 0.18. Independent gamma 
priors with this mean and standard deviation of 0.10 are assumed for each group. The induced 
prior for the relative rate of success for active versus control therapy is shown in the figure.   The 
prior is centered at one (consistent with no difference) with nearly all mass between 0.5 and 2. 
 
Prior to any data collection, equipoise implies that the probability that active therapy is superior to 
control is 50%.  Based on observed data, an increase in this probability to 80% or more, without 
safety concerns, will be considered a positive signal of efficacy for MPC therapy.  Simulations 
indicate that our sample size of 159  patients provides a probability of 80% to detect such an 
efficacy signal if the true rate ratio is 1.5, with a false positive rate of 15%.  These values are 
based on the estimated posterior distribution for the rate ratio, to be determined by [CONTACT_167889]. 
 
As enrollment is expected to be completed within 20 months, a formal interim analysis of efficacy 
is not planned (see below for continuous monitoring of safety). NHLBI will determine whether 
and how future development of MPC therapy continues within the NHLBI funded Network 
infrastructure based upon all efficacy results, safety outcomes, feasibility, and the state of the field 
as it relates to the scientific validity and integrity of a proposed future trial.   
 
Analysis of secondary endpoints 
Duration of time weaning is tolerated.  The duration of time weaning is tolerated will be examined 
at each time point post randomization.  Random effects models will be used to characterize 
changes over time in the duration that a patient tolerates weaning.  Orthogonal contrasts with the 
Tukey’s HSD correction will be used to compare the two groups at each point in time. An 
interaction term of time*treatment group will be used to determine the difference in the 
longitudinal course of duration of weaning between the two treatment groups.  We will use an 
additional approach that separates the data into strata defined by [CONTACT_859607].  We 
will then estimate a separate linear model, including a treatment effect, for the data in each 
stratum.  This method, known as pattern-mixture modeling is not sensitive to un-testable

Pattern of successful weans over time.   The pattern of successful weans over both the 6 and 12 
month follow-up periods will be explored using logistic regression with parameter estimation 
using 
generalized estimating equations.   
 
Echocardiographic assessments. All of the echocardiographic measures (left and right ventricular 
dimensions, LVEF, regional wall motion score) will be described using both graphical and 
numerical summaries. Analysis of covariance will be used to estimate and assess differences 
between treatment arms in the change from baseline (defined as [ADDRESS_1197790] randomization) to [ADDRESS_1197791] 95% confidence intervals 
(based on the Poisson distribution) for the risk ratios for individual adverse events will be 
computed.  In addition, the proportion of patients who exhibit anti-murine and anti-bovine 
antibodies following study product administration will be compared among randomization arms 
by a chi-squared test of the equality of proportions.  
 
Anti-HLA antibody sensitivity.  The proportion of patients with anti-HLA antibody sensitivity 
while on LVAD support will be compared among randomization arms by a chi-squared test of the 
equality of proportions.  
 
In addition to the analyses of clinical outcomes described above, explanted native hearts will be 
examined to quantify the extent of neovascularization, MPC cell engraftment, as well as histologic 
and gene regulation responses to cell implantation as detailed in the LVAD MPC II MOP. 
Confidence intervals will be used to compare treatment groups on these histological measures. 
Differences between groups in the prevalence of these measures will be quantified using relative 
risks and associated 95% confidence intervals.  
 
Quality of life. Quality of life will be measured using the KCCQ and SF-12. We will employ two 
approaches to the analysis of quality of life. The first will be to base the analysis on longitudinal 
mixed effects models.  These models would predict outcome from treatment group and time. The 
mixed modeling approach requires an assumption that patient dropout is ignorable in that the 
probability of droppi[INVESTIGATOR_859511].  Of 
course, this assumption may not hold, and moreover it is impossible to test robustly from the data

with the DSMB’s recommendations, will determine whether enrollment should be continued, 
suspended or terminated should any of the proposed stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_859513].

CONFIDENTIAL Missing Data 
Patients who require an LVAD are a highly dependent patient population and are extremely 
compliant with their care and follow-up. They receive extensive training in adverse event and 
alarm recognition prior to discharge, and they are called at least once a week when at home. Due 
to diligent patient and site monitoring, we anticipate that there will be few missing data points in 
this study.  Imputation procedures will be used as appropriate.     
 
 
ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY 
This section describes the overall study organization.  The study is conducted by [CONTACT_859608].  The following 
committees and institutions will be involved in the administration of the study.     
 
Event Adjudication Committee 
The charge of the Event Adjudication  Committee (EAC) is to review source documents and to 
adjudicate all adverse events, the severity and causality of the adverse events, and the causes of 
mortality. The individuals who will serve on the committee will be appointed by [CONTACT_15791], and 
will be independent of the study intervention manufacturer (Mesoblast, Inc.) and the DCC.  EAC 
members may be affiliated with the clinical centers but refrain from evaluating AEs at their site. 
The committee will consist of, at least, a cardiothoracic surgeon with LVAD experience, a heart 
failure cardiologist, a neurologist and an infectious disease expert. Additional experts in transplant 
immunology and cardiac pathology will be consultants to the committee as necessary. The EAC 
will meet every [ADDRESS_1197793] (DSMB)  
To meet the study's ethical responsibility to its subjects, an independent data safety monitoring 
board (DSMB) will monitor results during the study.  The board consists of physicians, 
biostatisticians, ethicists and bioengineers, who have no formal involvement or conflict of interest 
with the subjects, manufacturer (Mesoblast, Inc.), investigators, the DCC or the clinical sites, and 
will be appointed by [CONTACT_15792]. The DSMB will act in a senior advisory capacity to the DCC and 
the NHLBI regarding data and safety matters throughout the duration of the study. In addition, the 
DSMB will review interim summary results of the accumulating data from the Event Adjudication 
Committee every 6 months.  These data include adverse events (e.g., infection, bleeding, righ t 
heart failure) and mortality.  They will communicate their findings directly with the DCC and the 
NHLBI.  The clinical centers will have no contact [CONTACT_15793]. 
 
Data Coordinating Center (DCC)   
The university-based CTSN DCC (InCHOIR) will monitor interim data, and analyze the study's 
results in conjunction with the investigators and the sponsors.  The CTSN DCC will also 
administrat e the DSMB and EAC.   The DCC holds the study-specific IND with the FDA and the 
study-specific CTA with Health Canada and will be responsible for reporting serious and 
unexpected adverse events due to the study product to the FDA according to 21 CFR 312.32 and 
ICH E2A guidelines and to Health Canada according to C.05.012(3)(c) and C.05.014.  In addition, 
the DCC will be responsible for submitting the required progress reports to the FDA and Health

See the Study Product Technician Manual of Procedures for the list of supplies needed as well as 
detailed instructions on the procedures for preparing the study product for injection.  
 
PREPARATION OF SYRINGES FOR STUDY PRODUCT INJECTION 
 
Study Drug Injection Procedure 
 
1. Four (4) sterile 1cc syringes must be prepared under sterile technique (see MOP), and labeled 
numbers 1-4.   
 
2. Wrap the lower portion of the syringe with a wide steri-strip to obscure the lower barrel of the 
syringe and blind the operator to the nature of the contents (cell or placebo).  Mark the plunger at 
least [ADDRESS_1197794]. 
 
4. Note:  During any downtime or delay, each syringe should be gently hand rocked in order to 
prevent clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
 
5. The injection process should take place within [ADDRESS_1197795] no longer than 90 
minutes following thawing of the MPCs. 
 
6. A total of 16-20 intramyocardial injections of 0.2 mL (not to exceed a total of 4.0 mL) each will 
be performed.  Note:  Cells thawed longer than 90 minutes will be discarded and the process 
will be continued with a new vial . 
 
 
INTRAMYOCARDIAL INJECTION PROCEDURE/DOCUMENTATION 
 
Consider injecting cells during or around the time of LV api[INVESTIGATOR_859517]. 
 
1. The intent is to inject study product intramyocardially, across as much of the left ventricular 
myocardium as possible. 
 
2. Twenty (20) suggested locations are identified in the diagram below.  
 
3.  Injections should be made from an oblique angle into the mid-myocardium, with particular 
attention to avoid injection into the LV cavity.  
 
4. Each 0.2ml should be injected slowly, over [ADDRESS_1197796] for an additional 5 seconds before removing.

PURPOSE OF STATISTICAL ANALYTICAL  PLAN (SAP) 
The purpose of this SAP is to outline the planned analyses to be completed for the LVAD  
MPC  II trial.   The analyses  identified in this SAP will be included in abstracts and  
manuscripts reporting the results of the trial.  E xploratory analyses not necessarily 
identified in this SAP  may  also be performed. Any post hoc, or unplanned, analyses not 
explicitly identified  in this SAP will be clearly identified as such in any published papers  
from this  study.  
 
This SAP may be updated in response to additional developments, either within or outside the trial.  
                                        
[ADDRESS_1197802] devices (LVADs) have well -documented survival and quality of 
life benefits in patients with advanced heart failure both as a bridge to cardiac 
transplantation (BTT) and as a long- term therapy, so -called Destination Therapy (DT), in 
patients who are not transplant candidates.1-[ADDRESS_1197803] LVAD recipi[INVESTIGATOR_859520] (LV) as evidenced by [CONTACT_859615], myocyte 
contractile strength5, normalization of extracellular matrix and tissue and circulating 
neurohormones6, and programs of gene expression,7-[ADDRESS_1197804] between reverse remodeling 
and recovery of cardiac function, or “passive recovery”, have prompted our efforts to 
investigate “active recovery” to augment ventricular recovery with adjunctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_859521], s uch as the administration of stem cells at the time of LVAD 
implantation.  
  
Recent pre -clinical and clinical evidence suggests that myocardial transplantation of 
allogeneic mesenchymal lineage cells, in particular, can enhance cardiac performance in 
settin gs of acute and chronic functional impairment.12-[ADDRESS_1197805] donor suitability in LVAD recipi[INVESTIGATOR_859522].   
 
To this end, the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) recently conducted, in 
collaboration with the Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network (CCTRN), an 
exploratory trial of a single low dose (25 million [M]) allogeneic mesenchymal precursor 
cells ( MPCs; Mesoblast, Inc.) injected into the native myocardium at the time of LVAD 
implantation.  The objectives of this trial were to provide evidence of immunological 
safety , provide preliminary data on clinically important serious  adverse events,  and 
explore the efficacy of the intervention.  If safety were established, the pre- specified plan 
was to conduct a follow- up trial with a higher MPC dose administered in the same 
manner and timing as the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] . 
 
Given that the exploratory trial did not demonstrate any safety concerns, the Network 
investigators decided to proceed with the current follow- up trial (LVAD MPC II) using 
the MPC  dose of 150M in LVAD recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  This document serves as the SAP for the 
LVAD MPC II trial.  
 
1.1 Study Objectives  
 
1.1.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of injecting 
approximately 150 million allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) into the 
native myocardium of LVAD recipi[INVESTIGATOR_859523] . 
 
1.1.2 Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objective of the trial is t o explore the functional and physiologic effects of 
5  
 
intramyocardial injection of the 150M dose of MPCs in LVAD recipi[INVESTIGATOR_859524].  
 
1.2 Study Design 
This is a prospective, multi-center, double-blind, randomized (2:1), single dose cohort, sham procedure- controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of injecting a dose of 
150 M allogeneic MPCs into the native myocardium of LVAD recipi[INVESTIGATOR_859523] .  A total of 159 patients with advanced heart failure who are 
scheduled to be implanted with an LVAD as a BTT or DT will be enrolled in this trial.    
FDA -approved LVADs will be utilized at US sites, and Health Canada- approved LVADs 
will be utilized at Canadian sites.  
 
1.3 Study Duration and Time Points   
 
All patients will be followed until cardiac transplantation (for bridge to transplant 
patients) or until [ADDRESS_1197806] randomization (or until transplant, whichever comes first).  Safety will be assessed continuously throughout the 12-
month follow-up period.  A vital status follow -up assessment will be conducted at 24 
months to document whether the patient is alive and to determine if the patient has 
undergone a cardiac transplant, LVAD explant, and/or LVAD replacement.   
  
1.4 Randomization and M asking 
Patients will be enrolled in a single dose cohort and randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_1197807] (MPC) or cryoprotective media 
alone (Control) into the mid LV myocardial wall as add -on therapy, during LVAD 
implantation.  Randomization will take place only after it has been determined that all study eligibility criteria have been met.  LVAD implantation and study intervention must be administered within 24 hours following randomization.  
 
This is a double-blind, sham procedure controlled trial.  Site personnel and patients, as well as all core lab study personnel will be blinded to treatment assignment 
throughout the trial. 
 
2. STUDY POPULATIONS  
Two populations will be used for all summaries  and analyses.   Subgroup analyses will 
also be performed.  
 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT population is defined as all  randomiz ed subjects, regardless  of when  they 
withdrew from  the study or received the assigned treatment .  The ITT population will  be 
used to present all efficacy  data (including the primary efficacy  endpoint) by [CONTACT_859616].   Subjects will be analyzed  according  to the treatment to which  they 
were randomiz ed, regardless  of the treatment they actually  received.   Subjects with at 
least one assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint will be included in the ITT 
population. 
 
 
Safety Population 
The safety  population, defined as all  randomiz ed subjects  who received  the study 
6  
 
treatment , will  be used to present the safety  summaries  by [CONTACT_522059].   The 
Safety  population will therefore  be identical  to the ITT population if all randomiz ed 
subjects receive the assigned treatment.  
  
Population Subgroups  
Population subgroups will be defined for analysis purposes. These subgroups include 
patients who, at the time of LVAD implantation were categorized as Destination Therapy 
(DT) or Bridge to Transplant (BTT); patients who receive the HVAD or HeartMate II 
LVA D; and subgroups based on demographic variables (e.g. gender and age). 
 
3. DEFINITIONS  AND VARIABLES

Immunologic Assessment  
Immune reactivity results for % IgG Class I and IgG Class II will be recorded.  Presence 
of  > 10% anti-HLA antibody titers triggers a comparison of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_859525].   A baseline peripheral blood sample will be obtained to measure anti-murine and anti -
bovine antibodies.  
Hemodynamics   
Hemodynamics includ e central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary artery pressures 
including systolic, diastolic and mean pulmonary artery pressures (PA
S, PA D, PA M), 
pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_47469] (PCWP), transpulmonary gradient, cardiac output 
(CO), cardiac index (CI), pulmonary artery oxygen saturation (PAO 2 sat), and pulmonary 
vascular resistance (PVR measured in Wood Units) will be assessed by [CONTACT_137910].   
 
Echocardiography  
Echocardiogram will assess ventricular size, fu nction and regional wall motion.  
 
NIH Stroke Scale  
The NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is made up of [ADDRESS_1197809] health without 
symptoms to  death.  
 
Neurocognitive Testing  
Cognitive performance prior to LVAD implant includes following battery of tests: 
Hopkins Verbal Learning Test; Trail making Form A and B; Digit Span; Digit Symbol; Medical College of Georgia ( MCG ) Complex Figures; Controlled Oral Word 
Association.  
 
Quality of Life  
Quality of life measures include the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire 
(KCCQ ) and the Short Form 12 ( SF12 ), which will be completed by [CONTACT_102].    
 
4. EFFICACY ENDPOINT S 
 
4.[ADDRESS_1197810] randomization.  LVAD weans will be performed 
at 60  (±7) days and at 4 and 6 months (±14 days) (or until transplant, whichever comes 
first).  
 
8  
 
The wean begins when the patient reaches his/her low-speed LVAD flow (rpm) threshold 
(also called minimal support/time 0).  Low -speed is defined as the lowest possible LVAD 
flow (rpm) the patient will tolerate for the wean assessment.  The protocol recommends a 
target low -speed of 6,[ADDRESS_1197811] 
overseeing the wean determines that the pat ient has developed persistent signs and 
symptoms of low cardiac output and vascular congestion, in which case the LVAD will 
be returned to full LVAD flow.  Signs and symptoms may include: light headedness, 
dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, or pulmonary edema.  A complete  wean ing assessment ends 
when measurements for the mean arterial pressure and heart rate are taken after the final comprehensive echocardiographic exam following the 6MWT.  This occurs prior to 
increasing the pump speed back to the original pre- wean settings.  
 If, for any reason, the end of wean time is unknown, the time at the s tart of the weaning 
echocardiograms  recorded on the CRF or the time recorded by [CONTACT_859617] b e used . If that time is  not available, the end of wean 
time may be extrapolated from sources for the 6MWT and times to when the mean arterial pressure and heart rate measurements were taken throughout the w eaning. 
 A successful wean is  defined as the ability to tolerate temporar y weaning from LVAD 
support for [ADDRESS_1197812] successful weans for all the assessments following pump explantation.     Wean failures are defined as follows:  
o Inability to tolerate the temporary wean for 30 minutes; this includes patients who attempted the wean but were unable to reach minimal support and patients who achieved minimal support but were unable to tolerate the wean for 30 minutes;  
o Death.  Patients who die will be considered weaning failures for all assessments following their death;  
o Patient too unstable, in the judgment of the primary heart failure cardiologist, to tolerate the wean attem pt (e.g., in ICU, on inotropic support, having persistent heart 
failure symptoms despi[INVESTIGATOR_859471], suspi[INVESTIGATOR_859526], aortic valve intervention, stroke within 30 days, evidence of hemolysis defined as LDH > 2.5x the upper limits of normal).   
 Missing weans due to other reasons (besides death) including cardiac transplantation, patient refusal, missed visit, or study dropout (withdrawal, lost to follow- up) will not be 
counted as a failure and will not be imputed.  Detail s on how missing values  on the 
primary and secondary endpoints will be handled and the sensitivity analyses for missing 
data that will be performed are provided in Section 6.1.2 
 
This endpoint will be analyzed  using a binary  goal attainment  variable (30 minute wean  
achieved  [yes/no])  at each time point . 
 
4.[ADDRESS_1197813] randomization. The 
following secondary endpoints will be analyzed.  
 
9  
 
 
4.2.1 Overall Survival and Survival to Cardiac Transplantation  
Overall survival and survival to cardiac transplant from randomization will be assessed 
over 12 months.  For the overall survival analysis, the endpoint is death from any cause at 12 months (+14 days) .  Patients who receive a transplant will be censored at the time 
of transplant.  Patients who withdraw consent or are lost to follow-up will be censored at the date of early termination.  For patients who are lost to follow-up, the early termination 
date will be the date of last known proof of life def ined as whichever chronological date 
that is last of any available dates such as: contact [CONTACT_859618], including encounters with other services, correspondence with study team, or in-person visit. Patients who are alive at [ADDRESS_1197814] not exited the study early for any reason will be censored at the time the 12 month window closes.    A second mortality endpoint is death from any cause at 24 months (+30 days).  Patients who are alive at [ADDRESS_1197815] is cardiac transplantation at 12 months (+14 days) and 24 months (+30 da ys). Follow-up time for patients who withdraw 
consent, drop out of study, or are alive without experiencing cardiac transplant and death will be defined similarly as the overall survival endpoint. 
 
4.2.[ADDRESS_1197816] Randomization  
Weaning and 6-Minute Walk will be assessed at 60  (±7) days, 4, 6 months (±14 days) (or 
until transplant, whichever comes first).   
 
• Ability to Tolerate Wean from LVAD Support for [ADDRESS_1197817] 30 minutes will be assessed at 60 days and at 4 , 6 and 12 months.  Wean 
successes and failures are defined similarly as the primary efficacy endpoint and will be 
analyzed  using a binary  goal attainment variable (30 minute wean  achieved  [yes/no]) at 
each time point.  
 
• Duration of Ability to Tolerate Wean  
(a) The duration of ability to tolerate wean from LVAD support will begin at the time the 
patient reaches his/her low -speed LVAD flow (rpm) threshold and will be measured 
until resumption of LVAD at full support. The duration of ability to tolerate the wean 
will be measured for all patients who attempt the wean regardless of whether they 
successfully complete the wean . 
  
10  
 
 
 
  Patient s will receive a value of 0 for their duration of time weaning if they meet any of 
the following criteria:  
• Wean attempted but minimal support not reached 
• Wean not attempted because patient too unstable in the judgment of the primary 
heart failure cardiologist to tolerate wean attempt  
 
• Six Minute Walk Test  
 
The total distance walked in six minutes will be assessed.   After maintaining the 
patient at minimal support for 15 minutes, the patient will undergo a comprehensive 
echocardiogram if stable and asymptomatic.   For those patients stable and 
asymptomatic at the completion of the echo, the 6MWT will be performed (about 20 
minutes into the wean) while the patient is at his/her low -speed LVAD flow 
threshold.  The distance is measured (in feet), regardless of the number of times stopped or the rate of ambulation.
 
 
In most cases, patients who tolerate the wean for 30 minutes will undergo the 6MWT.  
However, since the 6MWT begins immediately after the 15 minute comprehensive echo, 
it may be performed by [CONTACT_859619] 30 minutes.  The distance walked for these patients will still be included in the 6MWT endpoint.  Patient s will receive a value of 0 for the total distance walked in six minutes if they meet 
any of the following criteria: 
• Wean attempted, minimal support reached, and 6MWT not performed  
• Wean attempted, minimal support not reached, and 6MWT not performed 
• Wean not attempted because patient too unstable in the judgment of the primary heart failure cardiologist to tolerate wean attempt  
 
4.2.3 Physiologic Assessments  
 
• Echocardiographic Assessments of Myocardial Function   
Echocardiographic parameters will be assessed at each wean assessment time point at (a) 
LVAD on full support prior to wean, (b) 15 minutes following initiation of wean from LVAD WeanBaseline

6MWT, as tolerated by [CONTACT_102].    
The following echo assessments will be recorded and/or calculated at each time point 
before and after the LVAD wean as per protocol:  
• Left ventricular end- diastolic dimensions (LVEDD) and left ventricular 
end-systolic dimensions (LVESD)  
• LV fractional shortening 
• LVEF by [INVESTIGATOR_203917]’s Rule (when possible).  
• LVEF by [CONTACT_55799]  
• LV r egional wall motion score index ( WMSI ; comprehensive post 6MWT 
echo at 6 and 12 months).  WMSI assessment will be performed using the 
American Society of Echocardiography scoring system, modified to exclude the 4 api[INVESTIGATOR_859527].  Therefore, 12 segments (basal and mid- ventricular 
segm ents) will be utilized instead of 16.  
• LV mass by [CONTACT_859575] ( only full support, comprehensive 
echo study) 
• RV function (normal, mild, moderate, severe)by [CONTACT_859564] 
• RV chamber size (normal, dilated [mild, moderate, severe])  
 
• LV Chamber Remodeling  
Echocardiographic assessments of LV chamber remodeling will be performed while 
the LVAD is at full support. The baseline echocardiographic evaluation will be 
defined as the LVEDD minor axis assessment prior to LVAD implantation . The 
percent change from baseline in LV end -diastolic minor axis dimension (LVEDD) 
will be determined.  
 
The following secondary endpoints will be assessed in ALL patients, regardless of the 
ability to tolerate the temporary wean from LVAD support: 
 
• Neovascularization and Cardiomyocyte Proliferation 
Myocardium from the api[INVESTIGATOR_859528], if applicable, 
will be categorized with regard to region, including anterior, anterolateral, lateral, 
inferior, midventricular and basilar specimens.  All samples will be evaluated for neovascularization, quantification of cardiomyocyte proliferation by [CONTACT_859576], gener al histology, and DNA analysis. 
 
• Cell Engraftment and Fate 
Myocardium from multiple samples taken at the time of explant for cardiac 
transplantation or any other indication, if applicable, will be evaluated for cell 
engraftment.  Relative number of donor c ells in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_859529]- DRB alleles different 
from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_859477].   
 
• Immunologic Assessment  
Immune reactivity results for % IgG Class I and IgG Cla ss II will be recorded.  Presence 
of >10% anti- HLA antibody titers triggers a comparison of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_859525].   
12  
 
A peripheral blood sample will be obtained to measure anti-murine and anti-bovine 
antibodies.  
4.2.4 Quality of Life and Neurocognition  
Quality of life  (QoL)  data will be collected and evaluated as a secondary endpoint.  
Quality of life will be assessed with the KCCQ, a widely used tool in heart failure 
populations, and the SF12, a widely used overall health status measure.  QoL will be 
compared between treatm ent groups at baseline,  6 and 12 months (±14 days) post 
randomization.  
The KCCQ is a 15 -item questionnaire that  assess es how heart failure affects a 
patient’s life.  T en summary scores can be calculated within the KCCQ including but 
not limited to the Ove rall Summary score, Clinical Summary score, and Total 
Symptom score.  These 3 scores range from 0 to 100, with high higher scores 
indicating better quality of life, fewer symptoms, and physical limitations associated 
with heart failure.  
 
The SF 12 is a 12- item survey that assesses a patient’s view about their health. The 
Physical and Mental Health Composite Scale scores can be derived from the SF -12.  
These composite scores are normed as T -scores (mean=50, SD=10) where a higher score 
indicates a better health state.  
 A neurocognition battery will be administered  at baseline and at 90 (±14) days and 12 
months (±14 days) post randomization, but not during LVAD wean.  Cognitive 
performance will be assessed using the following battery of tests: Hopkins Verbal 
Learning Test; Trailmaking Tests A and B; MCG Complex Figures; Digit Span; Digit 
Symbol Substitution Test; and Controlled Oral Word Association.  Neurocognitive testing will be administered by [CONTACT_859620].   
 
4.2.5 Index Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859530] ≥ 24 hours will be considered. Readmission s due to heart 
transplantation or LVAD explantation for myocardial recovery will be excluded. 
 
• Total Number of Days Alive and out of the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859531], from the day of randomization to 12 months (+14 days) post randomization during 
which the patient is not in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  For patients who die, receive a heart transplant, or drop out of study (withdrawal, lost to follow-up) before month 12, the total number of days alive out of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859532], from the day of randomization to death, transplant, or study discontinuation during which the patient is not in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   
 
• Length of Index Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859533]-operative length of stay for the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_455890] (and 
broken down by [CONTACT_859579]/step down unit and 
regular floors).  In addition, discharge location will be captured. 
 
• Time to First Readmission 
[ADDRESS_1197818] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859534].  
 
• Readmission R ates 
The rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859535] 12 months (+14 days) study period. Readmission s due to heart transplantation or LVAD explantation for myocardial 
recovery will be excluded.  Readmission rates will be calculated as the ratio of number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859536]. 
 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859537] -04/[ADDRESS_1197819] -to-Charge Ratios (CCRs) 
obtained from annual CMS cost reports. In addition to index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14051], costs associated with subsequent readmissions will be included in the study. Patients will also be asked at each follow -up visit if they have been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859538]. Outpatient costs incurred at non-Network and non-US hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859482]. 
 
4.3 Tertiary Endpoints  
 
4.3.1 Cytokine Quantification 
Plasma samples will be processed at the site at baseline (prior to study intervention), 
at day 1 (+1) post intervention, and at days 7 (±2), 30 (±3), 60 (±7), and 120 (± 14) 
days post randomization, and at 6 and 12 months (± 14 days) post randomization.  Chemo/cytokine quantification of plasma derived from peripheral blood samples will be performed by [CONTACT_859621]- α, IL-1, IL–6,  IL–10, 
IL–17, TGF-β, RANTES, SCF and SDF-1.  
 
4.3.2 Angiopoietin-1 and Angiopoietin-2 Quantification 
Because angiopoietin -1 and -2 play important roles in vascular development and 
maturation of normal stable angiogenesis, these analytes will also be measured  in 
peripheral blood plasma collected at the following timepoints:  at baseline (prior to 
study intervention), at day 1 (+1) post intervention, and at days 7 (±2), 30 (±3), 60 
(±7), and 120 (± 14) days post randomization, and at 6 and 12 months (± 14 days) 
post randomization.     
 
5. SAFETY ENDPOINTS  
The following additional endpoints will be assessed for all patients (including those who do not tolerate LVAD wean):   
5.1 Primary Safety Endpoint 
The primary safety endpoint of this study is the incidence of potential study intervention-
related adverse events, defined as   
(a) infectious myocarditis,   
(b) myocardial rupture,  
14  
 
(c) neoplasm,  
(d) hypersensitivity reaction, and  
(e) immune sensitization  syndrome  
 
Infectious Myocarditis: Evidence of myocardial infection manifest by [CONTACT_859622]/or cultures, with or without signs or symptoms of systemic infection.  May be accompanied by [CONTACT_859623] (if absent on histological examination of the api[INVESTIGATOR_859539]).  
 Myocardial Rupture: The presence of myocardial r upture as evidenced by [CONTACT_859624] (intra -operative or at autopsy) or by [CONTACT_859625], but not limited to echocardiography or ventriculography, with or without hemodynamic instability.  
 Neoplasm: Any new uncontrolled gr owth of aberrant cells.  
 Hypersensitivity reaction: Clinical syndrome including but not limited to fever, 
leukocytosis, or rash with onset ≤ [ADDRESS_1197820] treatment intervention and lasting < 24 hours, in the absence of clinical signs of concomitant infection.  Immune sensitization  syndrome: Clinical syndrome including but not limited to fever, 
leukocytosis, rash or arthralgias with onset ≥ [ADDRESS_1197821] the donor cells detected ≤ 30 days following onset of syndrome, in the absence of clinical signs of concomitant infection.  
5.2 Secondary Safety Endpoints 
 
5.2.1 Incidence and Rate of Non-Surgical GI Bleeding Events and/or Epi[INVESTIGATOR_859519] 
[ADDRESS_1197822] Randomization  
Evidence from the LVAD I study involving 30 patients suggests that treatment with MPC may reduce GI bleeding events and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_859519] 6 months after 
randomization. Therefore, particular emphasis will be placed on the analysis of these events.  
 Serious GI bleeding and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_859540] 6 months (+14 days) will be defined using the INTERMACS definition for mucosal bleeding. Based on the INTERMACS criteria, a non -surgical major mucosal bleeding event that occurs >7 days after initial 
LVAD implantation is defined as a bleeding event that results in death, re-operation, re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859541]/or transfusion of red blood cells.  
The latter is quantified as the number of units given per 24 hour period. 
Bleeding due 
to trauma (e.g. falls) will be excluded.  
 
5.2.2 Serious & Study -Intervention Related Adverse Events   
The incidence and frequency of all anticipated and unanticipated serious adverse events 
that occur prior to 12 months (+14 days) post injection of MPC or cryoprotective media alone, will be determined.  Moreover, the incidence of all adverse events classified by [CONTACT_859626] “po ssibly” or 
“probably” study-intervention related (to either the study product or to the 
15  
 
intramyocardial injection procedure itself) will be determined.   
 
5.2.3 Anti-HLA Antibody Sensitization  
Anti-HLA antibody serum sample will be collected at days 30 (±3) and 90 (± 14), and at 
months 6 and 12 (± 14 days). Immune reactivity results for %  IgG Class I  and IgG Class 
II, will be assessed.  If the PRA (percent reactive antigens) of either class I or class II 
HLA antibodies are >10 %, specificity analysis will be performed. The specificity test is 
to measure the presence of antibodies to HLA antigens including MPC donor specific HLA antigens.   
  
6.   STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY  
 
6.1 Statistical  and Analytical Issues  
 
6.1.1 Statistical  Methods  
All data will be presented by [CONTACT_859627].  Subgroup 
analyses will be performed as described in section 6.5. 
 
For all  baseline,  demographic and efficacy  variables , data will be summari zed and 
analyzed  by [CONTACT_859628] .  Safety  variables  will be 
summari zed by [CONTACT_522059].  
 In summary  tables of continuous variables, the following descriptive statistics will be 
used: minimum and maximum, mean,  median,  95%  confidence interval (CI),  standard 
deviation  (SD)  and standard error (SE). 
 In summary tables of non-normally distributed variables data will be presented using the  
minimum, maximum,  median  and lower  and upper quartiles.  
 In summary  tables of categorical  variables,  counts and percentages  will be used. The 
denominator for each percentage will be the number  of patients  within  the randomization  
group unless otherwise specified.  
 
Rates of events will be calculated as the ratio of the total number of events recorded over 
a period of time over the total patient/time (months or days). Total patient/time will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_260968] (in months or days) that patients were at r isk for a 
specific event from the time they were randomized in the study. For patients who die, are transplanted , or drop out of study (withdrawal, lost to follow-up) before they experience 
an event , their patient/time will be calculated as the time from r andomization to death, 
transplant, or study discontinuation.  Rates and 95% confidence intervals will be reported.  
 
For any variable measured at different points in time, change from baseline will be calculated as the difference between the value of the v ariable at a specific point in time 
(e.g. 90 days) minus the baseline value.  
Relative change from baseline will be calculated as the value of a parameter at a specific 
point in time minus the baseline value of the parameter divided by [CONTACT_859629] 
16  
 
the parameter.  
 
Percent change will be calculated as the relative change multiplied by 100.  
 
All hypothesis testing  will be carried out  at the 0.05 (2 -sided) significance level , unless 
otherwise specified .  There will be no formal correction of the Type I error rate for 
multiple testing of statistical hypotheses.   
 
P-values  will be rounded to three decimal  places.  P-values  less than  0.001 will be 
reported as  <0.001 in tables.  P- values  greater  than 0.999 will be reported as  >0.999.  
 
Should any of the statistical methods proposed prove unsuitable during data analysis,  
more  appropriate methods will be used . These include data tran sformation  (for example 
to a logarithmic  scale)  to satisfy  model assumptions  such as  normally  distributed 
residuals with constant variance , or the application of non- parametric techniques.  
 
Additional  ad-hoc analyses  may be conducted as deemed  appropriate. 
 
All statistical analysis  will be performed  using SAS V9.[ADDRESS_1197823] once a 
week when at home. Due to diligent patient and site monitoring, we anticipate that there 
will be few missing data points in this study.   
 
• Missing Values for the Primary Outcome  
Missing outcome values on the primary endpoint will not be imputed. For the primary efficacy endpoint, missing data can be the result of patient receiving  cardiac 
transplantation, patient refus al, missed visit, or study dropout (withdrawal, lost to follow-
up).  Patients who receive a heart transplant will be censored at the time of transplant and 
the number of successful weans out of the number of possible wean assessments  up to the 
time of transplant will be considered in the analysis.  Intermittent missing data due to 
patient refusal or missed visits are assumed to be missing at random (MAR) and the 
number of successful weans out of the number of possible wean assessments will be used 
for analysis. Study dropout is  also assumed to be MAR and the number of successful 
weans out of the number of possible wean  assessments up to the time of dropout will be 
computed.  As described in Section 4.1 patients who do not attempt the wean because of 
death or physician contraindi cation will be considered as failures.  
 
• Missing Values for the Secondary Efficacy  Outcome s 
Missing outcome values on secondary endpoints will not be imputed.  Analytic rules 
[ADDRESS_1197824] been developed in Section 4.2.2 for missing wean duration and /or 6MWT due to 
patient’ s morbidity that precludes evaluation or patient’s inability to complete the entire 
wean assessment . Echo parameters related to LVEDD chamber remodeling  are measured 
while the LVAD is at full support and therefore, do not depend on the ability to perform 
the wean.   Since longitudinal models will be used for th e analysis of wean duration, 
6MWT , and echo parameters  over time  (see Section 6.3.2) , intermittent missing data 
under MAR  are allowed .  To accommodate for missingness due to death, transplant or 
study drop-out (withdrawal, loss to follow-up) pattern -mixture analyses will be us ed for 
longitudinal models.  Values of the duration of weaning that are missing because the 
patient was not able to reach minimal support or did not perform the wean because of cardiology discretion will be assigned a value of zero.  
 
• Missing Values for All Other  Outcome s 
Consideration for missing data for secondary and tertiary outcomes will be handled similarly to what described above. 
 
• Sensitivity Analysis 
Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to investigate possible violations of 
the missing  at random assumption. Using a pattern -mixture model approach for 
MNAR18 (missing  not at random), we will impute the missing data under several 
MNAR scenarios.  Specifically, we will use delta adjustments after several 
multiple  imputation models in which the imputed values will be modified  (e.g. 
shifted  by a constant) to reflect a better or worse score for specific patients (e.g. 
patients who do not perform the 6MWT because of refusal or withdrawal of 
consent will receive a worse score). The consistency of results across these different models will indic ate the robustness of the assumptions.

• The number (%) of patients who received a transplant by [CONTACT_24473] 12 
• The number (%) of patients  who  complete d the study at month 24 
• The number (%) of patients  in the ITT population 
• The number (%) of patients  in the Safety  population 
 
The number (%) of  subjects who  complete  and withdraw /lost to follow -up from  the study 
and the primary  reason for withdrawal  will be summari zed by [CONTACT_859631].  
The percentages will be calculated based on the total number of patients randomized in 
each randomization group. 
 
6.2.2 Protocol Deviations and Violations  
Protocol deviations and violations  are defined as deviations from  the procedures outlined 
in the protocol. There is no “ Per Protocol” population defined for this study.  All 
statistical analyses  and summaries  will be conducted on an intent- to-treat basis  for the 
18  
 
efficacy endpoints and on an as-treated basis for the safety endpoints. 
 
6.2.3  Demographic Characteristics  
Demographic  and baseline characteristics  data including age, gender, race , ethnicity, 
indication for LVAD (DT, BTT), device type ( HeartMate II, HVAD)  will be summari zed 
using summary  statistics for  continuous variables or by [CONTACT_859632],  as appropriate.    
 6.2.4 Prior and Concomitant  Medication  
The number (%) of patients  receiving cardiovascular medications prior to or at the time 
of randomization will be reported and categorized by [CONTACT_859633].  
 6.2.5 Medical History 
Information pertaining to the etiology of heart failure, NYHA and Intermacs classification, the history of cardiovascular disease and other co- morbidities, and 
cardiovascular procedures will be summarized.  
The number of patient  with specific conditions in their medical  history will be 
summari zed using frequencies  and percentages.  
 
6.2.6 Pre-Implant Echocardiographic Parameters  
Pre-implant echocardiographic parameters such as left ventricular ejection fraction will 
be presented with summary statistics for continuous variables.  6.3 Efficacy Analysis  
 
6.3.1 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint and Determination of Sample Size  
A Bayesian approach based on the probability  that active therapy is superior to control will 
be used to assess the strength of potential efficacy, should safety continue to be 
demonstrated.  Simulations will be conducted to estimate this probability.  The procedure 
will be carried out as follows : a binomial likelihood is specified for the primary efficacy 
outcome  of the number of successful weans out of the three planned. The prior distribution 
for the success probability of the binomial likelihood is based on data from the control patients in the LVAD MPC I  trial, where the rate of successful wean was found to be 
approximately 0.18.  Independent gamma priors with this mean and standard deviation of 
0.10 are assumed for each group.  Under the null hypothesis of no difference between the two groups, t he simulated prior  distribution of the success rate ratio is centered at one with 
nearly all mass between 0.5 and 2.  Before  any data collection, equipoise implies that the 
probability that active therapy is superior to control is 50%.  Based on observed d ata, an 
increase in this probability to 80% or more, without safety concerns, will be considered a positive signal of efficacy for MPC therapy.  Simulations indicate that a sample size of 159 patients provides a probability of 80% to detect such an efficac y signal if the true rate ratio 
is 1.5, with a false positive rate of 15%.   
 
An additional analysis based on a frequentist approach will also be conducted on the 
primary outcome as a sensitivity analysis. Negative binomial regression will be used to 
compare t he number of successful weans in the first [ADDRESS_1197826] 
heterogeneity , and accommodates over-dispersed data .  If there are excess zeros due to 
19  
 
failure to wean that cannot be satis factorily accounted for  in the negative binomial 
model, a zero -inflated negative binomial regression will be considered.  
 
6.3.2 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
All secondary  efficacy analyses  will be performed  using the ITT population, unless 
otherwise specified.   
 
• Overall Survival and Survival to Cardiac Transplantation 
Time to death will be calculated as the number of days between randomization and death 
due to any cause at 12 (+14 days) and 24 (+30 days) months . Patients who are alive at the 
respective time points  will be censored. Patients who undergo cardiac transplantation will 
be censored at the time of transplant. Patients who drop out (withdraw, lost to follow-up) 
will be censored at the time of study discontinuation. 
 
Survival at [ADDRESS_1197827] randomization will be calculated 
as the number of days between randomization and transplant. Patients who do not receive a transplant by [CONTACT_24473] 12 or month 24 will be censored. Patients who drop out (withdraw, 
lost to follow -up) will be censored at the time of study discontinuation.  Death before 
transplant will be considered a competing risk in the calculation of the cumulative incidence curves of time to  cardiac transplantation.  
 
Time to cardiac transplant ation  by 12 and 24 months will be described by [CONTACT_859634]’s test.

• Functional Status by  [ADDRESS_1197828].  If a random slope on time is needed, an unstructured 
20  
 
covariance matrix among the random effects will be used  and independence among 
the residuals will be assumed.  The model makes assumptions regarding the 
distribution (mean and correlation structure) of the random effects and the residuals 
which will all require checking.   
 
The method of Wu and Bailey20 is an instanc e of pattern -mixture modeling.    
 If there are excess zeros, a two -part mixed effects pattern -mixture model will be 
considered.  A pattern -mixture binary mixed model will be used to analyze the zero part 
of weaning duration and a pattern- mixture Gauss ian (or other appropriate link function) 
mixed model for the non-zero response. 
 
Six Minute Walk Test  
The 6MWT will be analyzed similarly to the duration of time weaning is tolerated  using 
random effects pattern mixture models.  An interaction term of treatment -by-time will be 
used to determine the difference in the longitudinal course of the 6MWT  between the two 
randomization groups.   
 
• Physiological A ssessments 
At each wean assessment , echo parameters are measured 3 times – prior to wean, [ADDRESS_1197829] the analysis to descriptive measures and their 95% 
confidence intervals.  LV performance and LV chamber remodeling  
The percent change from baseline in LV end- diastolic minor axis dimension (LVEDD) 
will be measured from the echocardiogram performed when the LVAD is at full support 
before the wean . Similar to the duration of wean and 6MWT endpoints, changes in echo 
parameters over time will be analyzed using random effects pattern mixture models with 
an interaction term of treatment- by-time group to determine the difference in the 
longitudinal course of LVEDD between the two randomization groups.   
    
• Index Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859542] 6 months (+14 days) 
post randomization will be analyzed using negative binomial regression models in which the randomization arm will be the independent variable of interest and the total days alive as an offset.

• Quality of L ife and Neurocognition 
Quality of Life 
Quality of life will be measured using the KCCQ and SF -[ADDRESS_1197832] deviations for the whole sample.  Function of 4 cognitive domains (verbal learning and memory, visual learning and memory, executive functioning, and visuospatial/constructional functioning) will be measured by [CONTACT_113116] Z- scores 
of tests that correspond to each domain.    The impact of M PC treatment over time will be assessed using linear mixed effects 
models with random intercepts.  In these models, the standardized neurocognitive scores assessed at each time point will be used as the dependent variable, treatment, 
[ADDRESS_1197833] 
of the MPC treatment in particular subgroups of patients. These analyses will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_859636] (DT or BTT). Since the randomization was not stratified according to this  factor, there is no assurance that the randomization groups 
will be balanced within these strata. An assessment of the available sample size within each stratum and reasonable balance of the treatment assignment will be conducted 
before performing the subgroup analyses. Strata that contain less than 20% of the 
sample size and/or in which the number of patients assigned to a specific group is less 
than 10 will not be considered. 
 
6.6 Safety Analysis

Incidence and Rate of Non-Surgical GI Bleeding Events and/or Epi[INVESTIGATOR_859519] [ADDRESS_1197834] that treatment with MPC may reduce GI bleeding events and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_859519] [ADDRESS_1197835] serious GI bleeding and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_859549]. Time to first bleeding event over 6 months 
(+14 days) will be calculated as the time from randomization to the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_859550].  Time to first bleeding event will be described by [CONTACT_859637]’s test.
[ADDRESS_1197836] bleeding event .  Patients who do not 
experience bleeding by [CONTACT_2671] 6 months period will be censored. For patients who undergo cardiac transplantation prior to a bleeding event, censoring will be at the time of transplant.  Similarly, patients who drop out without having a bleeding event 
will be censored at the time of study discontinuation.    The rate of serious GI bleeding events and/or e pi[INVESTIGATOR_859551]/months. A negative binomial model will be used to compare the rate of bleeding between the MPC and the control group. 
 
[ADDRESS_1197837] of baseline factors, such as type of LVAD 
implanted (Heartmate II or HVAD), the LVAD indication (DT or BTT), or history of GI 
bleeding, negative binomial models  will be fitted  to examine  the effect  of these factors on 
bleeding. I nteraction terms may  also be added to these models depending on the 
frequency of the outcome variable in the subgroups.  
 
6.6.2 Treatment -emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)  
All adverse events in this study will be analyzed  from the time of injection . All safety 
analysis will be based on  the safety population. Subjects who were randomized, but 
never been administrated with the study drug (either MPC or control) will be 
excluded from the safety analysis.  
 AEs will be mapped to the MedDRA coding system.  The incidence of TEAEs and serious TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1196], MedDRA Preferred Term and treatment .   
 
Separate tables  will be presented for all  TEAEs, TEAEs by [CONTACT_926], serious TEAEs, 
study intervention- related  TEAEs, LVAD related TEAEs and TEAEs leading to 
death.  
 The number and percentage of patients with a TEAE or serious TEAE will be 
presented.  A patient will be counted only once in the incidence count for a specific MedDRA Preferred Term, although a MedDRA Preferred Term might be recorded more than once for a particular patient.  
 The number and rate of each TEAE will be presented.  Differences in the incidence of 
individual TEAEs  s will be assessed using negative binomial regression  with the 
treatment  groups  as the predictor .  
 
6.6.2   Anti-HLA Antibody Sensitivity, Anti -Murine and Anti -Bovine Antibodies  
The proportion of patients with anti-HLA antibody sensitivity while on LVAD support will be reported along with 95% confidence intervals by [CONTACT_1570] .  In addition, 
the proportion of patients who exhibit anti-murine and anti-bovine antibodies following study product administration will be reported similarly . The analysis will be based on all 
available samples at each time point. Missing  data will not be imputed . In addition to the 
analyses of clinical outcomes described above, explanted native hearts will be examined 
to quantify the extent of neovascularization, MPC cell engraftment, as well as histologic and gene regulation responses to cell implantation. Confidence intervals will be 
constructed and differences between treatment groups in the prevalence of these 
measures will be summarized .

syndrome) be observed.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_859552] a very diffuse beta (2, 8) prior for mortality for both groups, and will be initiated following the 
randomization of the 10th patient. We would propose to halt randomization if the probability that mortality on active therapy is increased compared to control exceeds 
80%.  The probability will be determined sequentially, after each mortality event. NHLBI, in conjunction with the DSMB’s recommendations, will determine whether enrollment should be continued, suspended or terminated should any of the proposed stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_859513].

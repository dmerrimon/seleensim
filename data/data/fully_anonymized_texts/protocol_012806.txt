Indication Under 
Investigation  Approved indication of spi[INVESTIGATOR_481345], intractable pain of the trunk and limbs.   
Investigation 
Purpose  To characterize the effects of amplitude titration on subject satisfaction and pain 
relief with high dose (HD) stimulation  (90 µs and 1000 Hz ) in subjects with back 
and leg pain being treated by [CONTACT_307888] . 
Product Status  All devices used in this study are commercially available and will be used within 
the intended approved indication.  
Primary 
Objective(s)  To characterize the minimum amplitude as a percentage of perception threshold 
that maintains SCS therapy satisfaction . 
Secondary 
Objective(s)  To characterize the minimum amplitude as a percentage of perception threshold 
that maintains  overall pain relief.   
Additional 
Objectives  1. To characterize the subject population who responded to HD stimulation, 
which is defined as having an average overall Visual Analog Scale ( VAS) 
pain score ≤ 4 at baseline. The characterization will include:  
o Demographics  
o Therapy sat isfaction  and description , as measured by [CONTACT_481392] ( SSA) 
o Function, as measured by [CONTACT_481393] ( ODI) 
o Quality of Life, as measure d by [CONTACT_481394] 5 -
Dimensions  (EQ-5D) 
2. To characterize the subject’s overall pain, back pain, and leg pain at 
baseline, as measure d by [CONTACT_8298]  
3. To characterize the amplitude of active therapy at baseline and the 
amplitude at perception thresholds collected i n supi[INVESTIGATOR_481346]   
4. To characterize the locations of the active contacts  
Safety Objective  To characterize therapy and device rela ted adverse events and device deficiencies . 
Study Design  This is a prospective, multi -center, single -blind post -market feasibility study.  This 
study will be conducted in the [LOCATION_002] at no less than 2 sites.  To reduce the 
possibility of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_481347] a site overly influencing the combined results, 
no more than 30 subjects will be enrolled at each site.  Eligible subjects will 
receive four different programmed amplitude settings (80%, 60%, 40%, and 20%

  of perception threshold), each for appro ximately two weeks. Subjects will be blind 
to the different amplitude settings and will not be informed that the amplitude is 
being titrated down, beginning at 80% of perception threshold.  
 
The overall study duration, from first subject enrollment to last subject visit, is 
expected to last approximately [ADDRESS_618423]’s participation in the 
study is expected to last approximately [ADDRESS_618424] 40 subjects to 
proceed beyond the Baseline visit.  
 
A sample size of 40 subjects is reasonable t o characterize the distribution  of the 
minimum amplitude as a percentage of perception threshold that maintains SCS 
therapy satisfaction , as well as to provide data for consideration of future studies.

4.1. Background  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_481350], intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs , 
including unilateral or bilateral pain associated with the followin g conditions:  failed back surgery 
syndrome  (FBS) or low back syndrome or failed back, radicular pain syndrome or radiculopathies  
resulting in pain secondary to FBS or herniated disk, postlaminectomy pain, multiple back operations, 
unsuccessful disk surgery, degenerative disk disease /herniated disk pain refractory to conservative and 
surgical interventions, peripheral causalgia , epi [INVESTIGATOR_481351], arachnoiditis or lumbar adhesive

pain relief. Stimulation parameters (amplitude, pulse width, frequency, electrodes) can be manipulated 
to provide patient -specific pain relief. Traditionally, parameters have been chosen to balance pain relie f 
with comfortable paresthesia.  
In the last s everal years, clinical evidence has emerged to suggest that paresthesia may not be required 
for pain relief .1,[ADDRESS_618429] focused on two branded types of stimulation that seem to 
allow pain relief with either: 1) no paresthesia, as reported i n studies on 10 kHz SCS, or HF10TM 
therapy1,2,3,4,5 or 2) minimal paresthesia, as reported in studies on burst SCS, BurstDR.6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14  The 
use of higher frequency stimulation of 1000  Hz with a pulse width of 90  µs has also been investigated for 
clinical outcomes as a consistent starting point for a pplying high dose ( HD) stimulation .15  
Conventional SCS therapy has primarily been driven by [CONTACT_481396]. There is evidence that the T9/T10 intervertebral disc space has 
been a common l ocation to target stimulation for chronic low back pain and leg pain using conventional

Eligible subjects will receive four different programmed amplitude settings (80%, 60%, 40% , and 20% of

It is estimated that [ADDRESS_618432] up 
to 6 study visits (including Screening, Bas eline/Programming Visit #1, Programming Visits #2 -4, and the

  Based upon the limited data in the literature, this study was designed as a feasibility study focused on 
characterization rather than specific hypothesis testing. For  this reason, a simpler longitudinal study 
design was favored over a cross over clinical study. The outcomes of this study may be used as the basis 
for future  clinical studies .  
The use of a longitudinal study design with decremental dose is intended to ch aracterize a trend in the 
amplitude dose relationship for HD stimulation. The titration of amplitude by 20% decrements applied 
over bi -weekly periods, and the assessment of each setting  at the end of each period is intended to try 
and minimize any carryover effects.

Subjects may be recruited through the investigator’s practice and referring physicians.  It is 
recommended to recruit subjects who live within a reasonable distance from the site.  
Potential  subjects may be identified through chart reviews or as new or existing patients attend clinic 
visits.  I f subjects are recruited from outside the investigator’s practice, sites are to ensure that 
appropriate release for access to the subject’s records (paper and/or electronic) is obtained. Any subject 
recruitment materials disseminated to subjects (advertise ments, handouts, posters, social media) must 
be approved by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB) prior to use.  
Recruited  subjects will be screened by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_481355]’s inclusion and exclusion criteria.  All subjects must be consented in accordance with 
the protocol , and IRB requirements,  prior to any study -specific procedures.  Subjects who do not meet 
any of the inclusion or who meet exclusion criteria may not be rescreened.  
9.3. Subject Consent  
The informed consent process will be performed in accordance with the ethical principles that have  
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and with 21CFR§[ADDRESS_618440] 
the purpose and nature of the study, procedures, expecte d study duration, available alternative 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and the benefits and risks involved with study participation and the potential treatment.  
Subjects will be given a copy of the IRB -approved ICF/Health Insurance and Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIP AA) form and any other written information.  In addition, subjects will be given 
adequate time to review the document and to ask questions and will be informed of their right to 
withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice. Subjects must be able t o read and comprehend 
the ICF written in English.  After this explanation  and review period,  and before any study -specific 
procedures have been performed, the subject will voluntarily sign and date the ICF/HIPAA form.  The 
date the subject signs the ICF/HI PAA form represents the date the subject is considered enrolled in the 
study ; subjects are considered enrolled in the study upon signing the ICF/HIPAA.  
The principal investigator , or appropriately delegated personnel,  will document the informed consent 
process, including the date of consent and name [CONTACT_481424]’s medical record.  The original signed ICF/HIPAA should also be placed in the subject’s medical 
record. Subjects must complete the informed consent pr ocess prior to any study -related procedures or 
testing be ing conducted. If the informed consent process is obtained the same day the subject begins 
participating in study -related procedures, it should be clearly documented in the subject’s case history 
that consent was obtained prior to participation in any study -related procedures.

Clinical Investigation Plan  
  
MDT17046  Version  1.[ADDRESS_618441]’s understanding of the 
informed consent or the study, or the subject’s decision to continue to participate, wil l be brought to 
the subject’s attention by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_95823].  
9.4. Study Visit Procedures  
Subjects will be assessed for eligibility to the study -specific inclusion/exclusion criteria through the 
Baseline visit.  
9.4.1.  Screening Visit  
The Screeni ng visit will commence after each subject has been enrolled. Subjects who do not meet all 
eligibility criteria will be exited from the study.   
During the Screening visit the following will be collected:  
• Subject demographics  
• Medical  and surgical  history  
• Device information  
• Pain medication usage  
 
Each subject’s device will be interrogated and a report session will be generated to capture the subject’s 
initial active therapy settings.  
Eligibility criteria will be evaluated to ensure su bjects have a program with only 1 anode and 1 cathode 
with 90 µs  and 1000 Hz  and the group that contains the program is used ≥ 50% . Any additional programs 
and groups within each subject’s device will be removed  during this visit . 
Each s ubject ’s device will be set to the program with only [ADDRESS_618442]’s final active therapy  settings.  
Subjects will be provided with a multi -day diary and asked to record their VAS pain scores for  the last  7 
days of the Baseline period .  A telephone call will be placed to the subjects one week before they return 
to the clinic to remind them to b egin completing the diary .  Subjects should bring their completed diary 
with them to the Baseline visit.

  9.4.2.  Baseline/Programming Visit #1  
The Baseline/Programming Visit #[ADDRESS_618443] Satisfaction Assessment (SSA), and baseli ne eligibility criteria will be assessed.  
To proceed on with the Baseline visit, the subject must meet the following inclusion criteria:  
1. Has an average overall VAS pain score ≤ [ADDRESS_618444] not meet  any of  the following exclusion criteria:  
1. Has provided response to Baseline SSA as “Neutral”, “Somewhat unsatisfied”, or “Very 
unsatisfied” with the therapy  
2. Completed less than 5 of the 7 days of the Baseline diary  
 
Subjects who do not meet Baseline eligibility criteria will be exited from the study and will be considered 
a screen failure.  
Subjects who meet the Baseline eligibility criteria will continue with the study and complete the 
following assessments:  
• Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)  
• European Quality of Life -5 Dimensions (EQ -5D) 
 
On the day of the Baseline visit, or during the course of the study, subjects must have imaging 
performed (eg, fluoroscopy or x -ray), which will be annotated with a  vertebral marker.  
 
Each subject’s device will be interrogated and a report session will be generated to capture the subject’s 
initial active therapy settings.  
The perception threshold and description of the sensation will be collected for Setting 1 (90 µ s and 1000 
Hz) with subjects in both the supi[INVESTIGATOR_107780]. Furthermore , the perception threshold will 
also be collected for one or more of the other 3 settings in Table 3 (eg, if time permits and the subject is 
not in too much discomfort) with subjects in both the supi[INVESTIGATOR_107780] , beginning with the 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_481356] r listed.  
Table 3: Perception Threshold Settings  
 Pulse Width  Frequency  
Setting [ADDRESS_618445]’s device will be programmed with four groups at [ADDRESS_618446] used during the Baseline period and 
should remain the same for the duration of the study. The only difference between the four groups will 
be the amplitude, which will be set to 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20% of the determined amplitude perception 
thresholds in the sitting and supi[INVESTIGATOR_481357] . If subjects are unable to 
reach a perception threshold at 90 µs  and 1000 Hz , the maximum amplitude allowed by [CONTACT_8121] (9.9 
volts) will be used as the perception threshold.  
Subjects will begin their first treatment period programmed to  the group  with  80% perception threshold  
and AdaptiveStimTM enabled . 
At the conclu sion of programming , a report session will be generated to capture the subject’s final 
active therapy settings.  
Subjects will be asked to give their patient programmer to site personnel for the remaining duration of 
the study. If the subject does not bring  their patient programmer to the Baseline visit, the 
commencement of the first treatment period (80% perception threshold) will need to be postponed 
until the subject is able to bring their patient programmer to the site. Once a subject exits the study, 
their patient programmer will be returned. Subjects will be informed, although they will not have access 
to their patient programmer during the study, they can turn their device off using their recharger.  
During the study, patients may need to recharge thei r device more or less often and should check their 
device daily to verify whether recharging is needed.  
Subjects will be provided a diary to record their VAS pain scores for the last week of the follow -up 
period prior to coming back into the clinic. A tele phone call will be placed to the subjects one week 
before they return to the clinic to remind them to begin completing the diary.  
9.4.3.  Programming Visits #2, #3, and #4  
Beginning approximately two weeks after the Baseline visit, in accordance with the targeted windows in 
Section 9.4.6 , subjects will return to the clinic for Program ming Visit #2 and should bring back their 
completed diary.  After Programming Visit #2, subjects will return to the clinic about every two weeks 
for Programming Visits #3 and #4.  
 
During Programming Visits #2, #3, and #4, subjects will be asked to complete  the SSA  to reflect their 
satisfaction of the last therapy setting. Subjects will also record on the SSA whether they have felt any 
stimulation sensations during the last follow -up period and, if so, to describe the sensation.  
 
Each subject’s device will be interrogated and a  report session will be generated to capture the subject’s 
initial active therapy settings.

With the device programmed to  90µs  and 1000 Hz , the amplitude will be programmed based on the 
perception thresholds obtained in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_481358]:  
• Programming Visit #2: 60% of Baseline perception threshold  
• Programming Visit #3: 40% of Baseline perception threshold  
• Programming  Visit #4: 20% of Baseline perception threshold  
 
If subjects are un able to reach a perception threshold at 90 µs and 1000 Hz , the maximum amplitude 
allowed by [CONTACT_8121] (9.9 volts) will be used as the perception threshold.  
At the conclusion of programming, a report session will be generated to capture the subject’s final 
active therapy settings.  
Subjects will be provided a diary to record their VAS pain scores for the last week of each follow -up 
period. Subjects should bring back their completed diary each time they return to the clinic at the end of 
a foll ow-up period. A telephone call will be placed to the subjects one week before they return to the 
clinic to remind them to begin completing the diary.  
9.4.4.  Final Study Visit  
During the Final Study visit, subjects will be asked to complete the Satisfaction and S ensation 
Assessment (SSA).  
Each subject’s device will be interrogated and a report session will be generated to capture the subject’s 
initial active therapy settings.  
The perception threshold and description of the sensation will be collected for Setting 1 (90 µs  and 1000 
Hz) with subjects in both the supi[INVESTIGATOR_107780]. Furthermore, the perception threshold will 
also be collected for one or more of the other 6 settings in Table 4 (eg, if time permits and the subject is 
not in too much discomfort) with subjects in both the supi[INVESTIGATOR_107780], beginning with the 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_481359].

  9.5. Medications  
All medications prescribed for the treatment of pain will be collected during the Scr eening visit. Only 
subjects who are on stable (no change in dose, route, or frequency)  prescribed pain medications for at 
least [ADDRESS_618449]’s pain medications while they are enrolled in the 
study will be collected.  
9.6. Assessment of Efficacy  
9.6.1.  Satisfaction and Stimulation Assessment (SSA)  
Subjects will be asked to indicate their satisfaction with the therapy and details pertaining to any 
stimulation sensations. The SSA will include questions such as the following:  
• Overall how satisfied or unsatisfied are you with this therapy?  
o Very satisfied  
o Somewhat satisfied  
o Neutral  
o Somewhat unsatisfied  
o Very unsatisfied  
• Specify reason for this response ? 
 
• Have you felt any stimulation sensations?  
o No 
o Yes, specify the following:  
▪ Occasional or Continuous  
▪ Pleasant or Unpleasant  
▪ Position when felt  (lying on back, lying on front, lying on right, lying on left, mobile, 
reclining, upright, other)  
9.6.2.  Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in Pain Diary  
Pain will be assessed using the VAS in a pain diary. The VAS is a 10 cm line, with “No pain” on left and 
“Worst pain imaginable” on the right .  
Subjects will record their overall, back, and leg pain using a paper pa in diary once a day for a [ADDRESS_618450] of questions such as the following :

  • Please rate your pain by [CONTACT_7328] a vertical slash mark through the line that best describes your 
average overall pain during the last 24 hours. (Line with “No pain” on left and “W orst pain 
imaginable” on the right)  
• Please rate your pain by [CONTACT_7328] a vertical slash mark through the line that best describes your 
average back pain during the last 24 hours. (Line with “No pain” on left and “Worst pain 
imaginable” on the right)  
• Please rate your pain by [CONTACT_7328] a vertical slash mark through the line that best describes your 
average leg pain during the last 24 hours. (Line with “No pain” on left and “Worst pain 
imaginable” on the right)  
9.6.3.  Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)  
The ODI (version 2) is one of the most highly recommended measures for patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_481360].22,[ADDRESS_618451] -reported sections on the ability to 
perform activities of daily living. A raw ODI score will be calculated from the tot al score of 10 sections.  
This ODI raw score will be normalized to a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 to 20 categorized as minimal 
disability, 20 to 40 as moderate disability, 40 to 60 as severe disability, and more than 60 as severely 
disabled in several areas o f life.  
9.6.4.  European Quality of Life -5 Dimensions (EQ -5D)  
The European Quality of Life – Five Dimensions (EQ -5D), version 5L, is a standardized measure of health 
status developed by [CONTACT_131492] 24 and a widely used validated tool to determine health -related 
quality of life.  The EQ -5D descriptive system consists of 5 dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels of severity: no 
problems, slight problems, moderate problems , severe problems, extreme problems. The subject will be 
asked to indicate his/her health state by [CONTACT_248991] 5 
dimensions. This decision results in a 1 -digit number expressing the level selected for that dimens ion. 
The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined into a 5 -digit number describing the respondent’s health 
state. It should be noted that the numerals [ADDRESS_618452] no arithmetic properties and should not be used as 
a cardinal score.  
The EQ Visual Analog Scale ( VAS) records the respondent’s self -rated health on a vertical, visual 
analogue scale where the endpoints are labeled ‘Best imaginable health state’ and ‘Worst imaginable 
health state.’ This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcom e as judged by 
[CONTACT_112775].  
9.7. Assessment of Safety  
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_481399]:

9.8. Recordin g Data  
This study will use a remote data capture (RDC) system to collect study required Case Report Form (CRF) 
information.  Electronic CRFs (eCRFs) will be provided by [CONTACT_456]; required data will be taken from 
source documents and directly entered int o the study database via the eCRFs by [CONTACT_481400], in accordance with applicable regulations.  Source documentation for pain 
diaries and subject assessments will be captured in a paper format and completed confidentially by t he 
subject only.  Data from the paper assessments will be entered into the database by [CONTACT_59752].   
Representatives  from the clinical site may not make changes to the diaries except for  administrative 
entries.  
The principal  investigator , or appropriately delegated personnel, are responsible for entering data on 
the eCRFs.  The principal investigator , or appropriately  delegated personnel, is required to approve all 
data on eCRFs via electronic signature.  
9.8.1.  Programming Data  
Through device interrogations with the 8840 N’Vision® Clinician Programmer , parameter data (eg, 
session data files) will be collected from the neurostimulator.  
Report Link is a commercially available tool, which will be used during this st udy that allows clinicians to 
electronically transfer and save session data files as a PDF document from the 8840 N’Vision® Clinician 
Programmer to the computer. Those PDF files can be printed to local or network printers and stored into 
electronic medical  record systems, and uploaded into the Neuro Programmer Upload (NPU) application.  
The NPU is an application designed to capture programmer interrogation output reports (eg, “session 
data reports”) from the 8840 N’Vision Clinician Programmer and store them within a Medtronic 
database for analysis and reporting.  
9.8.2.  Imaging  
Images (eg, fluoroscopy or x -ray) performed during the study will be annotated with a vertebral marker.  
For subjects with more than one lead, the highest electrode on each lead will be annota ted, and or 
described on the eCRF, to reflect which one is electrode 0 and which is electrode 8.  
Site personnel will de -identify each image prior to securely sending them to Medtronic.

  After receipt by [CONTACT_13735], the images will be evaluated by a qualifi ed reader to define and characterize 
the locations of the active contacts.  Medtronic will keep all copi[INVESTIGATOR_481362] a 
secure location and may use them for other business purposes outside of this study.  
9.9. Deviation Handling  
A deviati on is defined as an instance(s) of failure to follow, intentionally or unintentionally, the 
requirements  of the clinical investigation  plan  (CIP) . The investigator is not allowed to deviate from the 
CIP, except under emergency circumstances to protect the rights, safety and well -being of human 
subjects.  
Prior approval by [CONTACT_481401], conte mplates, 
or makes a conscious decision to deviate. If the deviation affects subject’s rights, safety and well -being, 
or the scientific integrity of the study, prior approval from IRB is also required. Prior approval is not 
required when a deviation is nece ssary to protect the safety, rights or well -being of a subject in an 
emergency or in unforeseen situations beyond the investigator’s control (e.g. subject failure to attend 
scheduled follow -up visits, inadvertent loss of data due to computer malfunction, i nability to perform 
required procedures due to subject illness).  
All study deviations must be reported on the eCRFs regardless of whether medically justifiable, pre -
approved by [CONTACT_13735], an inadvertent occurrence, or taken to protect the subject in an eme rgency.  
Study deviations must be reported to Medtronic as soon as possible upon the site becoming aware of 
the deviation. Reporting of deviations must comply with IRB policies, local laws, and/or regulatory 
agency requirements.  
Medtronic is responsible f or reviewing deviations, assessing the effectiveness of the CIP, confirming 
appropriate deviation reporting requirements are met, identifying site trends that require action. 
Repetitive or serious investigator compliance issues may result in initiation of a corrective action plan 
with the investigator and site, and in some cases, necessitate suspending enrollment until the problem is 
resolved or ultimately terminating the investigator's participation in the study.  
9.10.  Subject Withdrawal or Discontinuation  
A subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to 
their future medical care by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_481363] .  Subjects will be provided standard 
medical care by [CONTACT_481402] s tudy participation ends.  
The study sample size accounts for expected attrition, thus exited subjects will not be replaced.  
Examples of reasons for study exit include the following:

  • Subject death  
• Subject lost to follow -up 
• Subject voluntarily withdraws from the study  
• Subject becomes pregnant  
• Investigator terminates the subject’s participation in the study due to lack of compliance, violation 
of/change in eligibility criteria  
• Any clinical laboratory abnormality, inter -current illness, or other medical conditio n or situation 
occurs such that continued study participation would not be in the best interest of the subject  
• Normal study completion  
 
A study exit  eCRF will be completed for all enrolled subject s; the reason for withdrawal shall be recorded 
on the study exit eCRF . If a subject exits  from the study prior to normal completion, the eCRFs for visits 
that have occurred up to the point of withdrawal as well as the study exit  eCRF should be completed.   If 
a subject exits due to an adverse event or device d eficiency, the appropriate event eCRFs should also be 
completed.  
 
If the subject proceeds beyond the Baseline/Programming Visit #1 but chooses to withdraw from the 
study early; if they are willing, the Final Study Visit procedures may be completed prior to  study exit.  
 
If a subject requires a system modification or replacement during the study, they should be exited from 
the study.  
In the case that the subject is determined to be lost to follow -up, details of a minimum of two attempts 
and the method of atte mpt (e.g., one letter and one phone record or two letters) to contact [CONTACT_481403]’s medical records. In addition, regulations set forth by [CONTACT_481404].  
10. Risks and Benefits  
10.1.  Poten tial Risks  
This is a post -market study and subjects will be treated in accordance with the labeled instructions for 
use and indications for Medtronic’s SCS therapy.  There are foreseeable risks  that exist for all SCS 
patients regardless of whether they are in the study.  There  are no expected new or increased risks 
associated with this clinical st udy.

  neurostimulation system includes, but is not limited to, the fo llowing risks:  
• Allergic or immune system response to the implanted materials  
• Infection  
• Lead, extension, or neurostimulator erosion through the skin or migration  
• Leakage of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872]  
• Loss of pain relief may return patients to their underlying pain condition  
• Patients on anticoagulation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_481366]  
• Persistent pain at the neurostimulator site  
• Placement of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_481367] -extension is a surgical procedure that may expose patients to 
risks of epi[INVESTIGATOR_307865], hematoma, or paralysis  
• Radicular chest wall stimulation  
• Seroma or hematoma at the neurostimulator site  
• Stimulation -dependent gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, incontinen ce or 
constipation  
• Stimulation -dependent bladder symptoms such as urinary retention, incontinence or frequency  
• Change in stimulation, possibly related to cellular changes around the electrode(s), shifts in 
electrode position, loose electrical connections, lead or extension fractures, which has been 
described by [CONTACT_397580] (jolting or shocking sensation).  
• Formation of reactive tissue around the lead in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_481368], requiring surgical intervention. Time to onset can range from 
weeks to many years after implant.  
• The safety and effectiveness of this therapy  has not been established for  pregnancy, unborn 
fetus, or delivery. The study procedures may involve unknown r isks for female subjects, their 
embryo or fetus (unborn child) , or delivery  if they become pregnant. For this reason, pregnant 
females have been excluded from participating in this study.  Female subjects must agree to not 
become pregnant during the study by [CONTACT_2329] a medically acceptable method of birth control ; an 
identified pregnancy will result in immediate study withdrawal . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Device Deficiencies Risks  
The use of SCS systems includes risk of the following device deficiencies:  
• Mechanical failure/damage of sy stem components, eg, premature battery depletion, lead 
fracture (increased impedance), or breach of insulation  
• Migration or dislodgement of the lead(s)  
• Migration, dislodgement, or flippi[INVESTIGATOR_481369]  
• Programming and/or telemetry problems that m ight limit the capability to program or 
determine what parameters are programmed  
• Potential coupling or telemetry problems during recharging may cause inconsistency or limit 
battery charge restoration

  • Over -discharge of the neurostimulator battery may shorten battery life, permanently damage 
the battery, and/or result in the need for a replacement  
• Premature battery depletion resulting in the need for a replacement  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Risks Associated with the Recharging System  
• The recharger, antenna, belt and holster are n ot sterile, and contact [CONTACT_481405]. The recharger is not intended to be used on an unhealed wound.  
• Use of rechargeable neurostimulation systems may be associated with adverse events including 
heating sensation, discomfort, blis tering not caused by [CONTACT_481406], skin irritation, or redness near 
the implanted neurostimulator during or after recharging. Patients should check for skin 
irritation or redness near the neurostimulator during or after recharging.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Radiographic Imaging  
As part of the study, subjects will be required to have fluoroscopic or X -ray images taken of their 
thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  This may be beyond what is standard of care.  The risk associated with these additional 
images has been considered and determined to be minimal . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Additional Risks  and Information  
Additional information including precautions, warnings, and contraindications is included within  the 
packaged labeling of each system component.  
Parameters used during the study may not be effective.  Additionally, be cause the amplitude level will 
be titrated down, some subjects may not receive effective therapy after a certain threshold is reached , 
which could result in an increase level of pain . Furthermore,  prescribed pain medications should remain 
stable (no change  in dose, route, or frequency)  during the study.  
Depending on the programmed parameters the subject was using when they entered the study, it is 
possible subjects may need to recharge more frequently during one or more treatment periods.  
There may be addit ional risks related to this study, other than the ones described, that are not yet 
known.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Mitigation of Risks  
At any time during the study, subjects will be able to turn their device OFF using their Patient Recharger. 
Furthermore, a subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason (eg, due 
to insufficient pain relief) .

MDT17046  Version  1.[ADDRESS_618453] benefit from participation in the study. The SCS settings used during this study 
may reduce subjects’ pain intensity, return subjects to a more fully functional status, and/or improve  
their  quality of life.  Additionally, with stimul ation delivered at sub -perception threshold amplitudes, 
subjects may avoid uncomfortable or even intolerable stimulation sensations, such as painful 
paresthesia. During the study subjects will have increased interaction with physicians or medical staff 
com pared to routine clinical care, which may provide some indirect health benefits.   Another possible 
benefit for participating in this study may be a reduction in the number of required recharging sessions 
for individual subjects.   
Data from this study may have the anticipated benefit of helpi[INVESTIGATOR_481370].  The information 
gathered from this study could also help clinicians optimize therapy for thei r patients.

Neurostimulation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as SCS, are used as an aid in the management of chronic, intractable 
pain that cannot be effectively managed with medications and/or other conservative treatments alone. 
Patients considere d for neurostimulation therapy have typi[INVESTIGATOR_481371].  
Medtronic has carefully designed and tested the RestoreSensor® Neurostimulation Systems for the 
approved indications. Medtronic has complet ed an extensive risk analysis to ensure the identification of 
potential hazards and subsequent mitigation of these hazards to eliminate them entirely or reduce them 
to an acceptable level.  With existing PMA approval for the commercially available RestoreS ensor® 
Neurostimulation System s, an established safety profile of probable benefit outweighing risk already 
exists for SCS Therapy for chronic low back and/or leg pain. In most cases SCS is a reversible procedure 
that can be turned off or removed. Moreover , stimulation parameters are adjustable to minimize or 
reverse complications and maximize therapeutic effects.  
The study investigates the relationship between amplitude dose, therapy satisfaction , and pain relief in 
subjects being actively treated with SCS using HD parameters (90 µs  and 1000 Hz ).  The s ystem output 
and programming parameters used with the SCS Dosing  study are within the approved ranges of the 
commercially available RestoreSensor® N eurostimulation Systems.  The anticipated benefits of the 
clinical outcomes of SCS therapy per the study design outweigh the overall risk.

  11.3.  Recording of Adverse Events  
Adverse Event (AE) information will be collected from the time the subject has been enrolled until they 
are discontinued from the study. AE information will be reported to Medtronic on an adverse event 
eCRF, one for each Adverse Event.  
Only those AEs whic h are related to the following will be collected:  
• The implanted SCS system  and accessories  
• Spi[INVESTIGATOR_481372]. See the eCRF s 
for the information to be reported for each adverse event .  
Documented pre -existing conditions are not considered adverse events unless the severity of the 
condition has worsened  and is related to the implanted SCS system, accessories, or therapy.  
For adverse events that require immediate reporting,  initial reporting may be done by [CONTACT_648], fax, or e -
mail, or on the eCRF by [CONTACT_481408]. The adverse even t eCRF must be 
completed as soon as possible.  
In case the investigator requires information from the sponsor in an emergency , the investigator can 
contact [CONTACT_481409] 11.[ADDRESS_618454] is  in a stable condition. “Ongoing” adverse events must be assessed at each study  visit. The 
adverse event eCRF should to be updated when there is a change to the information provided on the 
form (e.g. change in intervention, outcome, relatedness, etc.).  
11.4.  Recording of Device Deficiencies  
Device deficiencies are events associated with a medical device that do not result in an adverse event 
for the subject. Device deficiency information will be collected throughout the study and reported to 
Medtronic on a device event eCRF, one for each device deficiency.  
11.5.  Reporting of Adverse Events  and Device Deficienc ies 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to abide by [CONTACT_481410] . Unanticipated Serious Adverse De vice Effects 
([LOCATION_003]DE), must be reported to Medtronic within [ADDRESS_618455] the 
study team  using the following email address : [EMAIL_9260] . 
11.7.  Deaths  
The investigator must notify Medtronic immediately and the IRB, as required, after learning of a 
subject’s death, regardless of whether or not the death is related to the device system or therapy.  The 
investigator should also attempt to determine, as conclusively as possible, whether such deaths are 
related to the device system or therapy. If the death is evaluated as device -related or th erapy -related, 
and unanticipated, the event will be reported as an [LOCATION_003]DE by [CONTACT_481411].  Deaths will be 
captured by a study exit eCRF and an adverse event eCRF if related to the device system or therapy.  
If an autopsy is conducted, a copy of the r eport should be provided to Medtronic.  Medtronic requests 
that all device system components that were being used at the time of the death be returned to  
Medtronic for analysis per Section 7.2.  Requested death certificates and/or source documentation 
should be provided to Medtronic.  If the death occurs at a location remote from the study site, it is the 
study site’s responsibility to make every atte mpt to retrieve all pertinent information related to the 
subject’s death and submit the investigator’s death summary of the known events surrounding the 
death to Medtronic.  
12. Data Review Committees  
This study will not use a Clinical Events Committee or Data Monitoring Committee. Instead, all reported 
adverse events and device deficiencies will be reviewed by a Medtronic Medical Advisor to ensure 
consistent reporting. Regular meetings will be held by [CONTACT_169260], including the Medical 
Advisor, to review adverse events and identify potential trends in safety data during the clinical study.  
13. Statistical Design and Methods  
13.1.  General Statistical Considerations  
Data analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_13735] -employed statisticians or desi gnees. A validated statistical 
software package will be used for the analyses of the study results (e.g., SAS).  
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be developed prior to data analysis and will include a 
comprehensive description of the statistical met hods and reports to be included in the final study 
report. Any change to the data analysis methods described in the CIP will require an amendment only if 
it changes a principal feature of the CIP. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the 
CIP, and the justification for making the change, will be described in the clinical study report.

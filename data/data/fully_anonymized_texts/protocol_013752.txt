2 BACKGROUND AND R ATIONALE  
Per the World Health Organization, antimicrobial resistance is “one of the greatest 
threats to human health worldwide”. In the US, infections caused by [CONTACT_750585] i-drug resistant 
organisms (MDR O) add between $21 billion and $34 billion to health care costs 
annually, as compared to susceptible pathogens  (2).  In many bacterial pathogens , 
resistance has been increasing over the last few decades and as a general rule 
 Multi -Drug Resistant Organism Network (MDRO ) 
[ADDRESS_1027590] any specific novel antibacterial either precedes or 
relatively quickly follows the  introduction of the antibacterial for clinical use ( (1), figure of 
timeline) . 
 
In addition to increased healthcare costs, infections with MDRO have been linked to worse patient outcomes including increased mortality (3).  The study of the treatment 
and diagnosis of patients with MDRO infections is limited by a number of factors.  First, patients with MDRO infections tend to be more chronically and acutely ill as compared to their counterparts infected with more susceptible organisms. This results in an added difficulty in prospective enrollment of these patients.  Second, evaluation of outcomes in patients with MDRO infections may be complicated by a high rate of poor clinical outcomes unrelated to the infection (4).  For instance, mortality unrelated to infection is 
unlikely to be impacted by a different antibiotic treatment strategy or an earlier diagnosis.  Third, use o f concomitant antibiotics prior to diagnosis of the MDRO 
infection is extremely common in these populations which in turn further limits enrollment into trials with restrictions on such prior treatment.  
This study is specifically designed to provide data which can help in the design of future randomized clinical trials on both therapeutics and diagnostics , and  describe, on the 
basis of observational data , patients with MDRO  infections in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643] . 
These data will include a detailed clinical and epi[INVESTIGATOR_750549] . In addition, data will be  collect ed 
on species, strain type, and mechanism of drug resistance of the causative organism . 
Knowing the molecular characteristics will further inform future trial design as not all diagnostics detect and not all therapeutics are active against the same mechanisms of resistance ( 5). 
[ADDRESS_1027591] MDRO  
isolated from clinical cultures during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_750550].  Molecular and 
microbiological characterization will also be performed on MDRO isolates.

[ADDRESS_1027592] of potential inclusion/exclusion 
criteria on enrollment in future trials  
Detailed clinical data will be collected  to guide the future development of clinical trials. 
The eCRF is designed to collect data on the most common barriers to enrollment in 
clinical trials. Data  can then be used in the design of future trials to be presented to 
pharmaceutical companies , as well as to regulators from the FDA, to provide a rationale 
for requesting exceptions in inclusion/exclusion criteria. This will result in clinical trials that are more readily generalizable.  
3.[ADDRESS_1027593] a MDRO – as def ined in the specific sub- study protocol 
(Appendices)  – isolated  in a clinical culture are targeted for inclusion .  
5.[ADDRESS_1027594] one MDRO – as

eligible for inclusion.

culture for MDRO during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
6 STUDY DESIGN  
6.1 Overall S trategy 
The MDRO Network  will enroll at multiple sites globally . For each patient  identified  as 
having an MDRO , the data manager at the site will access  the patient’s medical record 
and use web-based data entry  to enter the relevant data into the electronic case report 
form (eCRF) for the s tudy’s  centralized database.  
All MDRO  isolates will be sent to the central research laborator ies for molecular and 
microbiologic analysis . Molecular and microbiologic analys es may include, but will not 
be limited to,  antimicrobial susceptibility testing, determination of mechanisms of 
antibiotic resistance, and strain typi[INVESTIGATOR_007].   
6.2 Clinical Variables  
At both enrollment and then at 90 days after discharge from the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_750552], a limited data set will be collected for each patient, 
and entered into a secure database. Patient demographics and co- morbid conditions ; 
antibiotic allergies ; length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_750553]; ICU stay ; reason 
for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; complications during hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_750554]; 
components of  the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_750555] ; anatomic 
site-specific risk factors such as lines and devices ; antibiotic use; and outcomes 
including all -cause and attributable mortality  will be included. Specific data will be 
collected based on the anatomical site from which MDRO  was isolated; data will include 
relevant symptomatology, radiographic imaging results, laboratory results, and specific 
interventions . Length of stay after isolation of MDRO , disposition, and readmission rates  
will also be collected. To specifically track the origin and spread of MDRO , detailed 
information regarding the origin and post -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_750556] ; for long term care facilities, the specific facility will be noted, for home origin 
or discharge, the first 3 digits of the international  zip code will be used.  
6.3 Clinical Definitions  
MDRO: Specific  Multi-Drug Resist ant Organisms  of interest are defined in the 
Appendi ces 
Culture epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]:  A positive MDRO  culture from any anatomical site marks the 
beginning of a culture epi[INVESTIGATOR_750557] 7 days from 
the same site and during the same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  If a period of more than 7 days 
elapses between positive cultures , this is considered the start of a new culture epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
A positive MDRO  culture from a different anatomical site is considered a separate 
culture epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_204094]:   For the purposes of this protocol, patients are considered to be in a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_750558] a short -
term acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or if they are in the  emergency department awaiting admission 
with a subsequent admission. In addition, a stay in the emergency department of >24 
 Multi -Drug Resistant Organism Network (MDRO ) 
[ADDRESS_1027597] 2018  
hours will qualify as a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885].  
Infection:  A patient is deemed to have an infection if a MDRO  is isolated from blood or 
any other sterile source. For patients with positive respi[INVESTIGATOR_750559] (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) are used (6, 7).  For patients with positive cultures from urine or 
surgical wounds, the CDC/National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) criteria are used (8).  Patients with cultures from non- surgical wounds are considered infected only if the 
treating physician documents infection in the medical record and evidence of systemic inflammation on the day the positive culture is documented, defined as an abnormal systemic white cell count (either >10K cells/uL or <4K cells/uL), and/or abnormal body temperature (either >99.5 ºF or <96  ºF).  
Colonization:   All culture epi[INVESTIGATOR_750560] ( 9). 
Renal failure :  Renal failure will be defined using the Risk, Injury and Failure 
components of the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End- stage kidney 
disease RIFLE criteria ( 10).  
Severity of acute illness:   The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_750561] (PBS) is calculated using 
temperature, mental status, cardiac arrest, blood pressure, mechanical ventilation, as 
described  (11). 
Chronic comorbidity : The Charlson Comorbidity Index will be calculated using 
documented history of myocardial infarct, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, connective tissue disease, ulcer disease, liver disease, diabetes, hemiplegia, renal failure, any tumor, leukemia, lymphoma, AIDS, as described (12). 
6.4 Participant Enrollment and Follow-up 
The demographic and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_750562]. The timing of the remaining data entry will be at 90 days 
after the conclusion of the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  If a patient is readmitted to a study 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_750563], a new enrollment epi[INVESTIGATOR_750564].  
7 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
7.1 Sample Size Estimate   
The estimated sample size for each MDRO  is document ed in the MDRO specific 
section of the Appendi ces.   
7.2 Primary Analysis  
Data will be analyzed as outlined in each appendix.  Furthermore, comparative analyses between different organisms will be performed.  
The primary analysis will summarize the key clinical, epi[INVESTIGATOR_50123], and molecular data 
 Multi -Drug Resistant Organism Network (MDRO ) 
[ADDRESS_1027598] 2018  
on patients with MDRO  isolated  from clinical cultures during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Data  will 
serve to determine potential eligibility for future trials. Strain data and mechanism of 
resistance will aid in determining the likelihood of response to novel antibiotic options, 
based on other in vitro  and animal studies. 95% confidence intervals will be provided on 
key outcomes.  
Data to be summarized include the following:  
• Demographics  
• Origin (skilled nursing facility, home, long term acute care facility, transfer from another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])  
• Disposition (skilled nursing facility, home, long term acute care facility, transfer to 
another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125])  
• Charlson Score  
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_750565]  
• Source of positive culture (blood, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], urine, wound, abdominal, other)  
• Outcome (length of stay, ICU admission, discharge location, death)  
• Antibiotic summary  
• Status at 90 days  
o Defined as 90 days after the index culture. However, data will be collected through 90 days after discharge from index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
7.3 Timing of Analyse s

1    Background 
Carbapenem resistance is increasingly common in Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) , 
especially Klebsiella pneumoniae ( K. pneumoniae) isolates, and represents a major 
threat to our global population. Since the first reported carbapenem -resistant K. 
pneumoniae (CRKP) was identified in 1996, the incidence of infections due to this 
multidrug -resistant (MDR) pathogen has increased dramatically. According to data from 
the Centers of Disease Control (CDC), 11% of K. pneumoniae that cause healthcare-
associated infections are carbapenem resistant . Regrettably, outcomes after CRKP 
bloodstream infections are generally poor. All -cause mortality rates of  42-72% have 
been reported. The globally endemic CRKP strain type 258 (ST258) is responsible for the majority of infections in the US . The mechanism of resistance for most ST258 
isolates in the US is the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) family.

1 Background  
Vancomycin- resistant enterococci (VRE) are one of the leading causes of health- care 
associated infections, causing approximately 20,000 infections and 1,300 deaths per 
year in the US alone (1). Moreover, VRE are a major cause of bloodstream infections (BSI) and preferentially affect patients who are severely ill and have an impaired 
immune system, such as cancer patients and subjects in the intensive care setting (2). Currently, there is only one FDA -approved drug to treat VRE (linezolid). However, 
linezolid has major limitations for the treatment of severe VRE infections and its use in patients that need prolonged therapy is discouraged due to an unfavorable toxicity profile. Although several new drugs have been approved for the management of other 
important drug -resistant gram -positives (e.g. methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus ), the majority of these new compounds lack bactericidal activity against VRE. 
The most common anti -VRE used drug is daptomycin (off -label), a lipopeptide antibiotic 
with in vitro bactericidal activity against these organisms (3). However, the emergence 
of resistance during daptomycin therapy is a serious concern and uncertainty in the best 
dose regimen to treat severe VRE infections remains (4). Thus, robust clinical data to determine the best treatment approaches for these multi -drug resistant organisms are 
urgently needed. Indeed, despi[INVESTIGATOR_750573], prospective multicenter studies evaluating clinical and microbiological factors that impac t patient outcomes have not yet been conducted in the U.S.

2.1 Aim 1. To assemble a multicenter prospective cohort of patients with 
VRE BSIs to provide data on outcome s of patients with VRE BSIs for sample 
size calculations for future trials  
We will leverage from an ongoing effort (VENOUS I) that has prospectively collected 
data from ca. 200 patients with enterococcal infections from three active centers to assemble a l arge multicenter cohort of patients with VRE BSIs. The data collected 
under this protocol will provide valuable information regarding outcomes and prognostic factors (both from the patient and isolate perspective), along with real -life data on which 
patients are the target population for any trial directed against invasive VRE infections. Also, we expect this cohort to help pi[INVESTIGATOR_750574]/or centers with high incidence of VRE infections, facilitating the rational selection of sites f or future 
trials. Data on outcomes (i.e. survival and microbiologic clearance) will aid in guiding the design of future clinical trials by [CONTACT_750595] (see 3.3 in main MDRO protocol).

clinical trials. Data can then be used in the design of future trials to be presented to pharmaceutical companies, as well as to regulators from the FDA.

1 Background  
Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are common in immunocompromised patients, are 
a leading cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -acquired infection, and are associated with poor outcomes. 
Treatment of P. aeruginosa infections is complicated by [CONTACT_750598], 
including resistance to carbapenems. Carbapenem resistance is especially challenging 
because it is often associated with resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics, leaving few therapeutic options. Novel technologies and drugs are needed to better diagnose 
and treat P. aeruginosa infections, but designing the clinical trials necessary to address 
this demand is challenging given the lack of detailed data on P. aeruginosa resistance 
mechanisms, clinical and molecular  epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], treatment, and outcomes. This 
proposal aims to fill this gap by [CONTACT_750599] -resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA)  pulmonary and bloodstream infections. 
We believe that this study is ideal for the ARLG, as it will utilize the existing the MDRO 
Network, which already has similar ongoing studies in patients with carbapenem -
resistant Enterobacteriaceae and carbapenem -resistant Acinetobacter  infections.

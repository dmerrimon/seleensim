Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that affects 
1-1.[ADDRESS_59973] signs marking onset of disability in people with PD [1]. Walking 
difficulties and other symptoms are not fully addressed by [CONTACT_55456] 
[2, 3], making clear the need for additional approaches. Exercise is one such approach. Current literature supports use of exercise as an adjunct to traditional treatments for 
improving gait, balance, and quality o f life [4]. The primary aims of the proposed work 
are to compare the effects of three community based exercise programs on locomotor 
function and to determine whether and how these interventions alter the function and 
connectivity of locomotor control networks in the brain. To this end, we will utilize task -
based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting state functional connectivity (rs -fc) MRI to assess brain function and connectivity before and after the 
exercise interventions.  
 
One hundred twenty people with PD will be randomly assigned one of three 
community -based exercise groups: tango dancing, treadmill training or stretching 
(control) . Tango has been chosen because evidence suggests tango may be superior to 
a more traditional exercise program for improving gait, balance and quality of life [5, 6]. Treadmill training has been chosen because studies suggest that it can improve gait and 
quality of life [7]. Stretching has been chosen for the control group because it is an 
intervention that  does not directly target walking and will allow us to control for the social 
and attentional aspects of participating in group exercise. Each group will receive 3 
months of intervention, attending tri- weekly one- hour group classes. Each participant will 
be evaluated at three time points over 6 months. MRI and behavioral measures will be  
conducted with participants OFF medication, with behavioral measures also assessed ON medication.  
A2 Primary Hypothesis  
 Hypothesis 1a: Both tango and treadmill training will  improve forward walking 
performance, but only tango will improve backward walking performance. Walking performance in the stretching group will not change.  
 Hypothesis 1b: Tango and treadmill training will similarly improve disease severity. 
Tango will result in larger improvements in balance and quality of life compared to 
treadmill training and stretching.  
 
Hypothesis 2a: Following tango, a differential BOLD signal increase will be observed in 
the premotor area, supplementary motor area, and putamen during both imagined 
forward walking and imagined backward walking; following treadmill training, BOLD 
signal will increase in the primary somatosensory cortex and cerebellum during imagined 
forward walking, but not during imagined backward walking. No BOLD signal changes 
will occur in the stretching group.

 5 Hypothesis 2b: BOLD signal changes will be directly related to changes in actual 
locomotor performance.  
 
Hypothesis 3a: Following tango, resting state functional connectivity of the premotor 
area, supplementary motor area, and putamen will increase; following treadmill training, resting state functional connectivity of the primary somatosensory cortex and cerebellum will increase. No changes will occur in the stretching group.  
 Hypothesis 3b: Changes in resting state functional connectivity of the locomotor control 
network will be directly related to changes in actual locomotor performance. No changes will occur in the stretching group.  
A3 Purpose of the Study Protocol  
 
B Background 
 
B1 Prior Literature and Studies  
SIGNIFICANCE 
Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 1- 1.[ADDRESS_59974] area of difficulty reported by [CONTACT_55457] [1]. As such, the emergence of gait difficulty is  
considered a red flag and there is a clear need to develop interventions that can effectively address gait deficits such as reduced speed and reduced stride length [2, 3]. 
These gait difficulties have been noted in PD not only for forward walking, but also for 
backward walking, where gait speed and stride length are even more reduced relative to 
healthy controls [4, 5]. While pharmacological and surgical approaches to the 
management of PD can help to partially alleviate some gait problems, they do not 
completely address the issue, indicating a need for additional and complementary 
approaches to the treatment of gait in PD. Numerous studies have demonstrated the 
effectiveness of exercise as a complementary treatment for improving gait function in PD. Among the exercise approaches known to improve walking function, tango and 
treadmill training have recently emerged as two promising therapi[INVESTIGATOR_55435] (for 
reviews see [6 -8]). While these studies have been helpful in identifying possible 
intervention approaches for improvement of gait dysfunction, they have done little to 
elucidate the neural mechanisms by [CONTACT_55458]. 
 
One of the difficulties in understanding the role of exercise interventions in improved gait 
function for individuals with PD is that the underlying neural mechanisms responsible for gait-related disturbances in PD are not well understood. Our lack of understanding of the 
locomotor network may be due in part to the difficulty in collecting imaging data during locomotion. Because of the difficulty in accurately using brain imaging techniques to 
examine online locomotion, imagined walking has been used to gain a functional 
understanding of the neural correlates of gait in both healthy controls [9, 10] and 
Earhart, GM                                                                      Revised July 25, 2015

 6 populations with neurological disorders [11, 12]. In healthy controls, la Fougère et al. [9] 
compared real walking using positron emission tomography to imagined walking during 
functional magnetic resonance imaging and concluded that while some differences were 
apparent in the final motor pathways, the two tasks resulted in activation of very similar 
locomotor networks. The advent of resting state functional connectivity, which assesses 
activity  at rest and therefore eliminates the need to evoke real or imagined locomotor 
behaviors, presents another viable means of assessing locomotor networks using 
imaging. Rs -fcMRI, as its name [CONTACT_55474], measures activity at rest and only requires that 
participants lie quietly in the scanner. Rs -fcMRI focuses on spontaneous fluctuations in 
the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal at rest. These spontaneous fluctuations 
are not random, but rather are correlated among functionally related regions. Previous rs-fcMRI results have shown correlations equal to those seen during task -based MRI 
[13, 14]. These spontaneous fluctuations show coherence across areas of the brain known to be not only functionally related, but also anatomically connected as  
demonstrated by [CONTACT_55459] -fcMRI with diffusion tensor imaging (a technique 
used to trace white matter tracts) [14]. Rs -fcMRI identifies related networks within the 
resting state BOLD data, providing insight regarding the neuronal activation patterns of 
differ ent brain regions and reflecting the amount of functional communication between 
these regions [15]. Rs -fcMRI techniques have been used to successfully identify several 
networks, including the visual, auditory, default mode, and motor networks, among others  [15, 16]. Rs -fcMRI methods have also been employed in groundbreaking studies 
examining connectivity in disease states such as Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia, depression, and several others yielding key advances in our understanding of these conditions (for review see [16]). Rs -fcMRI holds great promise as a potential biomarker 
for progression of disease, elucidating compensatory mechanisms associated with disease processes, informing targeting of neurosurgical treatments, and investigating 
new treatment strategies. Although used successfully in many other populations with 
neurological disorders, rs -fcMRI has been little utilized to date to study PD. We are 
excited about the possibility of utilizing rs -fcMRI to study individuals with PD. We will 
combine measures of imagined walking (Aim 2) with measures of resting state functional connectivity (Aim 3) to gain a fundamental understanding of the human locomotor 
control network in PD and how it is altered by [CONTACT_14759]. Both the imagined and the 
resting state ta sks have the benefit of not requiring any actual motor output from the 
participants, thus limiting the extent to which the effects of the disease on movement 
production might confound the data collection process.  
 
Tango and PD  
Over 50% of the general popul ation does not achieve recommended daily levels of 
physical activity [17], and activity levels in those with PD may be lower than those of 
individuals without PD [18]. As such, development of exercise programs that are 
enjoyable and engaging, thus promoting regular participation, is critical. Dance may be a 
highly suitable intervention as it incorporates many features recommended as key 
components of exercise programs for those with PD [19] in a format that is engaging, 
motivating and social [20]. Evidence from our studies over the past five years supports 
the beneficial effects of tango on balance, quality of life, disease severity, and most importantly for the present proposal, locomotor performance. We have repeatedly 
demonstrated improvements in both forward and backward walking, with increases in 
gait velocity of approximately 0.1 m/s following tango [21 -24]. This is not surprising, as 
the basic tango step for the leader is forward walking and for the follower is backward walking. In our classes, we have men and women dance both the leader and the 
follower roles equally to ensure that all participants get similar experiences  
Earhart, GM                                                                      Revised July 25, [ADDRESS_59975] recently completed a 12- month tango intervention study which suggests that in 
addition to improv ed gait, participation in tango may convey several other substantial 
benefits including reduced disease severity and a slowed progression of disability over 
the long term [25]. Our earlier work also suggests that  tango may be superior to some 
forms of trad itional exercise for those with PD [21]. However, the traditional  exercise 
program used for comparison to tango in our earlier work was modeled on community -
based classes  offered in the St. Louis area that were considered the current standard of 
care. This  traditional exercise program did not include many of the elements now 
recommended for a PD -specific exercise program. In the  present application, we 
propose to compare tango to an intensity -matched treadmill training program designed  
to specifically target locomotor function in people with PD.  
 Very few studies have examined the neural underpi[INVESTIGATOR_55436]. Brown et al. [26] utilized task -based fMRI to study brain 
activity during production of tango -like leg movements performed to music by [CONTACT_55460][INVESTIGATOR_55437]. This study  specifically implicated the 
putamen in the control of dance movements performed to a metered and predictable  
beat. This work informs our hypotheses (2a and 3a) that locomotion- related activity and 
connectivity of the  putamen will increase following tango training in people with PD. To 
our knowledge, the only study to utilize neuroimaging before and after tango training is 
that of Sacco et al. [27], who also studied healthy young  controls. Following one week of 
tango training, participants showed increased activation of the supplementary motor 
area (SMA) and premotor area (PMA) during imagined forward walking as compared to baseline. This  study informs our hypotheses (2a and 3a) that locomotion- related activity 
and connectivity of the SMA and PMA will increase following tango training in people 
with PD.  Treadmill Training in PD  
Over the past decade, there have been several studies examining the effects of treadm ill 
training on gait in people with PD. These studies have consistently shown improvements in forward walking velocity following training, regardless of the training paradigm or training schedule used (for review see [7, 8]). These improvements are, similarly to 
tango, on the order of 0.1 m/s. Some have also noted improvements in balance [28] and 
quality of life [29] with treadmill training, though these aspects have been investigated on 
a very limited basis and are not addressed by [CONTACT_55461]. Treadmill training has the 
advantage of being task specific, as walking is the focus of the intervention. We will 
utilize traditional forward walking treadmill training, though we recognize that multi -
directional treadmill training including backward and sideways walking has been utilized successfully in people with PD [30]. Multi- directional training is beyond the scope of this 
proposal, however, as we aim to determine the effects of traditional treadmill training. Very recent evidence suggests that low intensity treadmill training with more minutes per 
session may be superior to higher intensity training with fewer minutes per session [31, 
32]. As such, we have chosen to implement treadmill training at a speed matched to preferred overground walking speed in our proposal. We will utilize a low intensity 
treadmill training approach which will not only follow in line with the latest available 
evidence, but also allow us to keep the intensity of the treadmill training similar to that of 
the tango classes.  
 
Earhart, GM                                                                      Revised July 25, [ADDRESS_59976] injury, and hemispherectomy [33- 35]. These studies have noted 
increases in activity in the primary somatosensory cortex following treadmill training in people with spi[INVESTIGATOR_32692] [35] and strokes [33]. Furthermore, increases in  
cerebellar activity following treadmill training were seen preferentially in those 
participants with spi[INVESTIGATOR_55438] [35] to the point of being functional. These studies inform our hypotheses (2a and 3a) 
that activity and connectivity of the primary somatosensory cortex and cerebellum will 
increase following treadmill training in PD.  
 
Exercise and Imaging: A Multi -Faceted Approach 
The proposed direct comparison of tango to treadmill training is critical as  it will put these 
two emerging forms of therapy head- to-head in order to determine their differential 
effects on actual locomotor performance (Aim 1), on brain activity during imagined 
walking (Aim 2), and on resting state functional connectivity of the locomotor control 
network (Aim 3) in people with PD. The combination of neuroimaging with exercise 
interventions is novel and will fill important gaps in our knowledge regarding basic 
locomotor control in PD and the mechanisms by [CONTACT_55462]. Previous neuroimaging work in different 
populations, as well as prior work in PD examining the effects of either tango or treadmill 
training on locomotion, sets the stage for this exciting work. Our use of different 
interventions along with two different neuroimaging techniques makes for a powerful and 
multi- faceted approach that will yield an extremely rich data set capable of addressing 
multiple gaps in our current knowledge. 
B2 Rationale for this Study  
Effective treatment of locomotor dysfunction in PD is essential, as gait difficulty is an early and major contributor to disability. The proposed study will provide important 
insights into the effects of different modes of exercise on locomotor function i n PD, filling 
current knowledge gaps and guiding future design and delivery of optimal exercise interventions. This work is innovative because it: 1) uses a community -based exercise 
approach, 2) examines dance as a novel form of exercise and directly compares it to 
traditional treadmill training and stretching, 3) tests participants OFF medication to allow 
more accurate assessment of disease severity, and 4) utilizes two distinct neuroimaging approaches, in conjunction with interventions, to explore potential mechanisms of the 
effects of exercise on both brain function and brain connectivity.  
C Study Objectives  
 
C1 Primary Aim  
SPECIFIC AIM 1: To determine the effects of tango, treadmill training, and  stretching (control) exercise on locomotor function and other aspects of PD. The 
primary variable for this aim is gait velocity. Additional gait variables of interest are stride 
Earhart, GM                                                                      Revised July 25, [ADDRESS_59977] distance. A secondary aim is to compare 
the effects of the different interventions on disease severity, balance, and quality of life.  
 
C2 Secondary Aim  
SPECIFIC AIM 2: To determine the effects of tango, treadmill training and stretching on 
brain activity assessed by [CONTACT_55463] -based fMRI blood oxygen level  dependent (BOLD) 
signal during imagined walking.  
 
SPECIFIC AIM 3: To determine the effects of tango, treadmill training and stretching on 
resting state functional connectivity of the locomotor control network assessed by [CONTACT_55464] -fc 
MRI.  
 
C3 Rationale for the Selection  of Outcome Measures  
To our knowledge, there are currently no studies that have utilized neuroimaging to 
examine the effects of treadmill training in PD. This represents a major gap in the 
literature and an obvious hole in our understanding of the mechanisms of action of treadmill training in PD. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_55439], there is currently a small 
body of literature describing changes in neural activity following treadmill training in other 
populat ions including those with stroke, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828], and hemispherectomy [33- 35]. 
These studies have noted increases in activity in the primary somatosensory cortex following treadmill training in people with spi[INVESTIGATOR_32692] [35] and strokes [33]. Furthermore, increases in cerebellar activity following treadmill training were seen 
preferentially in those participants with spi[INVESTIGATOR_55440] [35] to the point of being functional. These studies inform our  
hypotheses (2a and 3a) that activity and connectivity of the primary somatosensory cortex and cerebellum will increase following treadmill training in PD.

E1 Overview  and Design Summary  
This study will directly co mpare tango dancing and treadmill training, to each other and 
to a control group that participates in a stretching program to determine their effects on gait and function in people with PD. One hundred twenty people with PD will be 
randomly assigned one of  three community -based exercise groups: tango dancing, 
treadmill training or stretching (control). Each group will receive [ADDRESS_59978] Intervention Evaluation Visit - 4 hours - off medication 
Follow -Up Evaluation - 12 weeks after conclusion of exercise class - 2 hours (no fMRI) - 
off medication

Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ -20)[42] with an additional four question imagined gait task 
assessment. This test is used to assess ability to imagine motor tasks and has been 
previously used in PD [43]. Participants with a mean KVIQ -20+gait subsection score 
more than one standard deviation below the mean of an age -matched healthy cohort 
(Earhart lab, pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]) will be excluded from the study.  We anticipate that individuals in 
Hoehn and Yahr stages of I -III will participate. Informed consent will be obtained from 
each participant.

Earhart, GM                                                                      Revised July 25, [ADDRESS_59980].  
 
During the consent process, it will be emphasized that participation in this or any other 
study in our lab is done on a voluntary basis only. The investigator completing the 
consent procedure will verbally state and make reference to the written statement about 
withdrawing from the study at any time.  
 
A copy of the consent form will be provided to all participants.  
2.c Randomization Method and Blinding 
Participants will be assessed during the week prior to starting the intervention (pre-
intervention), the week following completion of the intervention (postintervention),  
and three months after completing the intervention (follow -up) (Figure 1). At the 
preintervention visit participants will be notified as to whether they were randomized to 
the tango, treadmill or stretching group. Randomization sequences will be generated a 
priori by [CONTACT_55467]. Prior to commencing exercise all participants will 
undergo a physical examination and will be required to complete an on medication 
screening graded exercise test per previously established protocols [44 -46] in order to 
determine whether or not they can exercise safely. All groups will receive 12 weeks of 
exercise, meeting 3 times per week for one hour each session. The exercise groups will 
thus participate in 180 minutes of exercise per week, meeting the CDC guidelines for physical activity[17]. All groups will exercise in community -based group settings to 
ensure that participants have similar experiences with respect to social interactions associated with participating in a group exercise class. Participants will be assigned to 
groups using a process of stratified blocked randomization. Self -selected forward gait 
velocity measured at baseline will be used to stratify participants into three categories: 
<1.1 m/s, 1.1 -1.3 m/s, and >1.3 m/s. These strata have been chosen based upon our 
preliminary data from 60 individuals tested OFF medication. The average velocity for this 
group was 1.2 +/ - 0.1 m/s (mean +/ - SD). Thus the middle stratum includes individuals 
within one SD of the mean and the upper and lower strata include individuals more than one SD above or below the mean, respectively. Each stratum will be randomized to the 3 groups using a block size of 10 to ensure that there is no temporal bias and guarantee 
that the number of participants at each level of walking performance who enter each 
study arm is the same.  
2.d Risks and Benefits 
There are no identifiable legal, social, or psychological risks associated with participation 
in the proposed studies. The identifiable risks are minimal and we are aware of no 
alternative procedures that can provide the same information.  
 
The potential risks to subjects are: a) effects of withholding overnight medication, b) loss 
of confidentiality, c) stumbling during locomotion, d) falling into the safety harness during 
testing on the treadmill, e) mechanical injury involving moving apparatus, f)Skin irritation 
from surface electrode preparation or rubbing of the electrodes on  your skin during data 
collection may occur. g) fatigue associated with long periods of exercise and MRI

and j) effects of the loud noise generated by [CONTACT_55468].  
 We do not yet know the full extent to which exercise may benefit people with Parkinson 
disease. Recent evidence suggests that the benefits may include improvements in 
physical function as well as quality of life. This study will allow us to determine what the benefits may be and if different types of exercise have different benefits.  
 This project will be the first to directly compare tango to treadmill training and will explore 
the neurophysiologic changes in brain function and connectivity following these two 
different forms of exercise. The information gained will provide critical insights regarding the relative merits of the two exercise approaches for improving function in people with 
PD and add to our understanding of the potential mechanisms by [CONTACT_55469]. If the three interventions both impart 
improvements in function and do so through very different effects on the brain, as 
hypothesized, this would suggest that both interventions are beneficial and that a 
combination of exercise might be more effective than either intervention alone as 
different aspects of locomotor control may be targeted. This could lead to future studies comparing different combination approaches to exercise rather than single mode 
exercise programs. Future work could examine the effects of different doses of exercise 
or different exercise intensities, the effects of long -term participation in exercise, and the 
retention of benefits through inclusion of follow -up evaluations. The imaging techniques 
proposed herein will also lay the groundwork to allow us to answer many other questions regarding locomotor control mechanisms in PD. The potential implications of this work 
are vast and the proposed study will set the stage for much future research. 
2.e Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
Based upon our previous intervention studies, we anticipate an attrition rate of 
approximately 15- 20% due to dropouts or failure to complete the required minimum of 
85% of classes.  
2.f When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Individuals may withdraw at any time during the duration of the study  
2.g Data Collection and Follow-up for Withdrawn Subjects  
No follow -up will be completed for withdrawn subjects  
 
E3 Study Drug

F1 Screening for Eligibility  
Possi ble participants will be screened via a phone interview. The screening process will 
identify if the individual meets the inclusion criteria stated above and does not meet any of the exclusion critera.  
Earhart, GM                                                                      Revised July 25, 2015

Follow -Up Evaluation - 12 weeks after conclusion of exercise class - 2 hours (no fMRI) - 
off medication 
 Screening phone call 
Following the consent process we will complete an MRI screening form. If the individual 
is not excluded from completing an MRI scanning session we will continue with the 
screening process.  
 
In addition, all eligible participants must be able to perform the imagined gait tasks in the 
MRI at or above a previously determined threshold. All participants will complete the 
Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ -20) (Malouin, et al, 2007) with an 
additional four question “imagined” gait task assessment (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_41274], Peterson & Earhart, 2012). The KVIQ -20 is used to assess vividness of mental imagery during motor tasks 
and has been previously used with PD patients (Heremans, et al, 2011). Participants 
with a mean KVIQ -20 + gait subsection score more than one standard deviation below 
the mean of an age matched healthy cohort (data recently collected in [CONTACT_55475]’s lab) will be excluded from the study.  
 Any individual who is accepted for the study based on the above will be given a packet 
of questionnaires to complete at home and continue on following the procedure below. 
This portion will be completed with a researcher who is blinded to the individual's group 
assignment. The specific questionnaires that will be included in the packet are as 
follows:  
Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_55445]-Motor Symptom Questionnaire  
Stages of Readiness to Exercise Questionnaire  
Fall History Questionnaire Footedness/Handedness Questionnaire  
Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Adults

Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)  
Prospective & Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ)  
 
Visit 1  (pre-test):  
Prior to commencing any exercise all participants will undergo a physical examination 
and will be required to complete an on medication screening graded exercise test per 
previously established protocols (Schenkman, M., et al., 2008; Christiansen, C.L., et al., 
2009; Katzel, L.I., et al., 2001) in order to determine whether or not they can exercise.

 15 ms, TE=455 ms, 1.0 mm3 voxels, 4:43 min). Two functional connec tivity scans will be 
acquired via BOLD sensitized fMRI (TR=2200 s, TR=25 ms, 4.0 mm3 voxels, 7- min runs 
of 194 frames). During these scans, participants will remain still and keep their eyes 
closed. Participants will be visual monitored via an eye tracking device during data 
acquitions and will be given an emergency indicator which can be pressed at any time to stop the scans. During the imagined walking component 9 minutes of eco -planar 
imaging data will be acquired (TR=2200ms, TE=2.5ms, 4 mm3 voxels) will be acquired 
while the participant views the cue or null condition on a mirror mounted to the head coil.  
 
All individuals will then complete the following battery of questionnaires and 
assessments(approximately 90 minutes): Montreal Cognitive Assessment  
Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR)  
Spatial Delayed Response Task (SDR)  
Nback Working Memory Test (Nback)  
Trail Making Test

RMswitch task  
Go-No-Go (GNG)  
Spatial Delayed Response Task (SDR)  
Nback Working Memory Test (Nback)

Spatiotemporal gait assessment will be completed simultaneously with the GaitRITE 
assessment. 
 
Exercise training begins:  
 Each Participant  will be a ssigned to a group (treadmill training, tango dance training or 
stretching) using a process of stratified blocked randomization and notified of their group assignment following their initial visit. This is necessary as walking speed must first be assessed prior to group assignment.  
 Within one week of the initial visit, the training sessions will begin. All groups will receive 
[ADDRESS_59985] to social 
interactions associated with participating in a group exercise class  
 The individual groups will complete 1 hour of training following the protocol listed below:  
 Tango Training: Tango classes will be modeled on those of our previous studies, and will include a brief warm up and a cool down, with [ADDRESS_59986] and gets  experience dancing with many 
different partners. Partners will be individuals without PD and will include spouses and 
caregivers of those with PD as well as healthy  volunteers.  
 Treadmill Training: The treadmill training group will have the same warm up and cool 
down period as the tango group with 45 minutes of the hour devoted to walking on the 
treadmill. Participants will walk on the treadmill at their own self -selected comfortable 
pace. Overground walking speed will be reassessed every 2 weeks and treadmill speed adjusted as needed to ensure that it continues to match overground walking speed. This model of treadmill training was chosen for two reasons: 1) to be of comparable intensity 
to the tango class where the basic dance step is walking done at preferred pace and 2) 
because recent evidence suggests that training at preferred speed for longer durations is 
more effective in enhancing gait than training at higher intensity for shorter blocks of 
time. The periodic reassessment of overground preferred speed and subsequent adjustment of treadmill speed will help to ensure that the treadmill training is also 
progressive in nature and in that way mirrors the progressive nature of the tango classes 
as much as possible.  
 Stretching Group: The stretching class will also have the same warm up and cool down 
as the other groups, with [ADDRESS_59987]-Intervention Evaluation (4 hours):  
This assessment will be completed off medication and will exactly mirror the pre -
intervention assessment with the following exceptions:  
No KVIQ/GIQ No physical examination and medical screening.  
No consent documents and payment forms. 
 
Follow -Up Evaluation - [ADDRESS_59988] ended (2 hours):  
This assessment will be completed off medication and will NOT include an MRI session. All other components completed in the post -intervention evaluation will be repeated.

F8 Safety and Adverse Events  
 
8.a Safety and Compliance Monitoring 
 
Earhart, GM                                                                      Revised July 25, 2015  
    
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 21 8.b Medical Monitoring  
Effects of medication withdrawal will be monitored via patient report and if the effects are 
too severe, participation in the study will be terminated prior to the second day of "off 
medication" testing.  
8.c Definitions of Adverse Events 
An adverse event is any patient reported  
8.d Classification of Events 
We do not anticipate any adverse events; however, the following procedures will be 
followed to minimize the risk.  
 
a) Temporary Worsening of Parkinson's symptoms. A temporary worsening of 
Parkinson's disease symptoms may result from not taking anti -Parkinson's medication 
for study evaluations. Once the individual resumes taking their medication, symptoms 
should return to their typi[INVESTIGATOR_55446]. Effects of medication withdrawal will be monitored 
and if the effects are too severe, participation in the study will be terminated prior to the 
second day of "off m edication" testing .  
 
b) Loss of confidentiality. Loss of confidentiality is highly unlikely. To safeguard against 
this, we will comply with all HIPAA regulations. Data will not be identified by [CONTACT_55470]. All data will be coded, and code sheets will be stored in locked files.  
 c) Stumbling during locomotion. Subjects will be closely attended by a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_55447]. Walking will be performed in a large, open space and the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_55448]. It is therefore unlikely that subjects will 
experience falls during testing or will be injured as the result of a fall.  
 d) Falling into safety harness. During testing on the treadmill, subjects will wear a 
modified parachute harness connected to an overhead beam that is rated to support 
heavy loads. A subject who falls will be supported fully by [CONTACT_55471]. Subjects will also be able to hold the support guides which will 
help them to stabilize balance during treadmill t esting. In addition, the treadmill will be 
equipped with redundant safety features to prevent subject injury and allow immediate cessation of treadmill movement at the touch of a button. 
 e) Mechanical injury involving moving apparatus. The treadmill is equipped with a safety 
switch that, when pressed, will immediately stop treadmill movement. The treadmill is 
also equipped with a break that can be applied at any time. Treadmill design is such that 
accelerations and decelerations are not abrupt, but are smooth, non- jarring transitions. 
Furthermore, it will be laboratory policy that: 1) the PI [INVESTIGATOR_55449] 2) on the day of an experiment, the 
exact protocols to be used will first be run without a subject to ensure proper system 
function.  
 f)Skin irritation may be prevented by [CONTACT_55472] (i.e. skin preparation). 
 
g) Fatigue. The proposed study involves one- hour exercise training sessions. Rest 
breaks will be provided as frequently as needed but you still are likely to be tired 
Earhart, GM                                                                      Revised July 25, [ADDRESS_60001] with the participant through out the 
session to monitor them. Additionally we can remove the individual from the scanner if they report being too sleepy to continue.  
 h) Dizziness. At the completion of the test, when the subject may be a little dizzy, 
investigators will walk very near the subject to the outer room and make sure the subject 
is not dizzy before he/she is dismissed.  
 
i) Claustrophobia. All individuals will be screened for previous claustrophobic 
experiences prior to participation. During the scanning sequence all participants will 
have an emergency squeeze bulb in their hand that, when squeezed, will notify the 
researchers of their distress. We will immediately remove the individual from the scanner 
at this time.  
 
j) Loud noise. While inside the magnet, subjects  will be able to communicate with the 
investigators through an intercom. To help protect the participant's hearing two levels of hearing protection will be worn by [CONTACT_55473]. Ear plugs will be inserted into the ear 
and outer headphones will be placed over your ears. Also, they will be given an alarm 
device to press if the intercom system should be ineffective because of the loud noises. This alarm will create a definite signal to the investigators that the subject wishes to 
communicate or exit. If a test is in progress, the test will be stopped and investigators will 
either speak to the subject using the intercom or enter the room and take the patient out 
of the magnet.  
 
The risks associated with these studies are minimal. Participant safety will be 
continuously monitored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_55450].  
8.e Reporting Procedures 
Any adverse events will be reported to the local IRB immediately and will trigger an 
immediate review, like the annual review described previously, to determine what changes need to be made and whether the study should continue or conclude.  
8.f Adverse Event Reporting Period 
Patients will be followed for [ADDRESS_60002]-study Adverse Event  
Any advent reported to the investigators following the conclusion of the study will be 
documented and reviewed.

Using PASS software (NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, UT), we have powered each aim based 
upon preliminary data. Our primary variable of interest in Aim [ADDRESS_60003] gait velocity +/ - SD was 1.2 +/ -  0.1 m /s and average backward gait velocity was 
0.6 +/ - 0.1 in a sample of 60 individuals with PD (H&Y = 2.4 +/ - 0.2) tested OFF 
medication in our laboratory over the past year for a different study. The study has been 
powered to be able to detect differences of  1 SD, or 0.1 m/s, which is equivalent to an 
effect size of 0.4. Changes of 0.1m/s or more in gait velocity have been reported previously following both tango [22 -24] and treadmill training [8, 29, 61, 62]. With an 
effect size of 0.4, 27 participants per group will provide 89% power to detect differences 
between or within groups using two -tailed tests at a significance level of 0.05. Based 
upon additional preliminary data from our lab, we have determined that this sample size is also more than sufficient to adequately power our secondary variables in Aim 1 (MDS -
UPDRS -III, mini -BESTest, PDQ -39).  
 Aims [ADDRESS_60004] size of 0.91 for change in beta weights 
using the cerebellum as an exemplar region (pre = -0.094 +/ - 0.111, post = 0.418 +/ - 
0.116, Figure 9) during imagined forward walking. We recognize that res ponses in those 
with PD may be less pronounced than in controls and as such have used a very conservative effect size of 0.45, half the size of the effect observe in controls, for our 
power calculation. Our preliminary data from people with PD (n=8) imagining forward 
walking indicate a beta weight of -0.075 +/ - 0.097, which is comparable to the value 
obtained from young controls at baseline. Utilizing the data from the sample with PD and an estimated effect size of 0.45, 18 subjects per groups will provide 80% power to detect  
differences between groups and 88% power to detect within group differences. 
Significant findings of differential BOLD signal changes have been localized in PD 
populations during similar imagined walking MRI paradigms with a total of 12 PD 
participants per group [59], further supporting that our proposed sample size is likely  
adequate. For Aim 3, utilizing rs -fcMRI (Figures 7,8) to determine correlations between 
regions in the locomotor control network, we have powered the study to enable detection 
of differences in correlation coefficients of 0.1 (mean correlation = 1.0, SD = 0.1, p = 
0.05, effect size = 0.44, per data from Wu et al. 2009 and our own preliminary data). We 
will have 80% power to detect between group differences and 88% po wer to detect 
within group differences with 18 subjects per group.  
 Based upon our previous intervention studies [23], we anticipate an attrition rate of 
approximately 15- 20% due to dropouts or failure to complete the required minimum of 
85% of classes. We also expect MRI related complications due to head motion in roughly 30% of tested individuals. This estimate is based upon our preliminary data from 
individuals with PD (Fig. 4, 5) where we lost 24% of scans due to head motion greater 
than 2mm of translation or rotation during a scan. As such, we will recruit [ADDRESS_60005]. Dropouts will be excluded from analyses in Aims 2 and 3 as full imaging data are needed from two time 
points.

 24 G2  Interim Monitoring and Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_55451].  
G3  Analysis Plan and Statistical Methods  
For Aim 1 , we will employ a repeated measures ANOVA with group (tango, treadmill, 
and stretching ) and time (pre- intervention, post -intervention, and follow -up) as factors to 
determine whether and how these interventions impact gait velocity, our primary variable 
for Aim 1. Similar analyses will also be performed for secondary variables of interest, including the MDS -UPDRS -III, mini- BESTest, and PDQ -39. As a secondary analysis for 
gait velocity, MDS -UPDRS -III, and mini -BESTest, we will determine percent difference 
between OFF and ON medication values at pre- intervention and post -intervention time 
points and compare these difference values using RM ANOVAS with group and time as facto rs. (If prescribed medications change over the course of the study then levodopa 
equivalent daily dose will be included as a covariate in these analyses.) This will allow us 
to determine if response to medications was different before vs. after intervention and 
whether this effect differed between groups. Analyses will be conducted using NCSS 
software (NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, UT). All imaging analyses will be conducted using Brain Voyager (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands) and custom written Matl ab 
(MathWorks, Natick, MA) software. For Aim [ADDRESS_60006] imagined tasks as individual contrasts. A false discovery rate (FDR) correction will be used to compensate for 
multiple co mparisons. BOLD signal changes within the previously specified regions of 
interest will be compared for pre- and post -intervention conditions. Additionally, the three 
groups will be compared to each other in the post -intervention condition using RFX 
ANCOVA . For Aim 3 , we will use an independent component analysis (ICA) to examine 
the strength of the correlation coefficients for anatomical regions identified as part of the 
locomotor control network. The strength of these correlations before vs. after 
intervention will be compared via two- tailed RM ANOVAs with group and time as factors. 
Finally, we will correlate BOLD signal changes during the imagined walking tasks (Aim 2) and changes in connectivity (Aim 3) with changes in motor performance.  
 
G4  Missing Outcom e Data

concerns that arise outside of these sessions. Data quality will also be assessed on an 
ongoing basis,  as data will be processed immediately after each experimental session. 
In addition, [CONTACT_55475] and [CONTACT_55476] will conduct a twice yearly review of data to ensure that the studies are progressing in a timely manner. The protocol will also be evaluated and the risk to benefit ratio assessed twice annually. Any adverse events will 
be reported to the local IRB immediately and will trigger an immediate review to 
determine what changes need to be made and whether the study should continue or 
conclude. All data and data monitoring will be kept strictly confidential according to 
HIPAA regulations. Results will be coded and the code sheets will be stored in locked files.

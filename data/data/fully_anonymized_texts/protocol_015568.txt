 Page 6 of 14  Revised: 1/19/2018  2.0 Objectives  
2.1 Purpose:  To evaluate the movement of the diaphragm after an interscalene 
block with liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (LB) compared to inters calene block (IB) 
with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  This study will evaluate if there is a possible prolonged phrenic nerve paralysis when using liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_656493], using ultrasound.  
3.0 Background  
3.1 Significance of Research Question/Purpose: To date there is no previous 
study looking at diaphragm movement after an Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_656494] .  It is important to see how long the phrenic nerve is 
affected  by [CONTACT_656509].   
3.2 Preliminary Data: We have not routinely examined that patient’s diaphragm 
via ultrasound after ISB at M Health.   Patients have not been readmitted 
for breathing problems with our current practice.  
3.3 Existing Literature:  There is no previous literature in LB ISB.  Urmey et al. 
showed 100% phrenic nerve block post ISB. But others (Renes et al) have 
evaluated it using bupi[INVESTIGATOR_656495] l ess 
diaphragm blockade. Cuvillon showed that those with a catheter had 66% 
phrenic nerve paralysis at 24 hours.  
4.0 Study Endpoints/Events/Outcomes  
4.1 Primary Endpoint/Event/Outcome:  The primary study endpoint will be 
diaphragm excursion (movement in cm) from re st to sigh in a sitting 
position.  
4.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)/Event(s)/Outcome(s): The secondary endpoint will 
be the diaphragm excursion (movement in cm) from rest to a quick 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_99807].  
4.3 Secondary Endpoint(s)/Event(s)/Outcome(s): Evaluation of baseline FEV1, 
FVC (or FEV6) and FEV1/FVC ratio via spi[INVESTIGATOR_038].  
5.0 Study Intervention(s)/Investigational Agent(s)  
5.1 Description: This study will be run concurrently with two other studies 
comparing bupi[INVESTIGATOR_656496]. We 
will either use already randomized patients for our randomization process or 
if they are not enrolled in either RCR or TSA study we will randomize them to one of the two groups . For this study in particular w e will use an 
ultrasound machine to scan the diaphragm of any patient who had an Interscalene Block for T otal Shoulder Arthroplasy or Rotator Cuff Repair. 
Patients are to be scanned in an upright sitting position and scanned from a low intercostal or subcostal approach using the liver or spleen as an acoustic window. M Mode will be applied and the range of diaphragmatic movement from the resting expi[INVESTIGATOR_656497] (sigh test) will be

 Page 7 of 14  Revised: 1/19/2018  recorded as was the range of diaphragmatic movement f rom resting 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_656498] (sniff test). The blocks will be done regardless of the study as they are standard of care for pain control.  The only intervention is ultrasound examination of the patient ’s diaphragm at baseline, [ADDRESS_884200] FEV1 and FVC via a portable spi[INVESTIGATOR_656499].  If patients did stay in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_656500] 2 we would also evaluate their diaphragm function.

6.0 Procedures Involved  
6.1 Study Design: This is a prospective  study  
Study Procedures: All patients who are enrolled in our TSA or RCR studys fit the criteria 
of being scheduled for overnight shoulder surgery and having an ISB with or without LB. The patients will already be randomized into either an ISB with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_656501]. If the patient is not enrolled or does not fit inclusion criteria for the 
RCR or TSA study they will then be randomized to either bupi[INVESTIGATOR_656502].  The  patients wi ll perform spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (one large exhale into a 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007]) and have an ultrasound examination of their diaphragm at  baseline prior to 
the block, in PACU after their procedure, and on postoperative day 1 (24 hours after ISB).  Diaphragmatic movement will be evaluated by [CONTACT_5203] -time M -mode ultrasonography 
of the hemidiaphragm using a 17- mm 1 - to 5-MHz broadband phased array US probe. 
Patients are to be scanned in an upright sitting position and scanned from a low intercostal or subcostal approach using the liver or spleen as an acoustic window. M Mode will be applied and the range of diaphragmatic movement from the resting expi[INVESTIGATOR_656497] (sigh test) will be recorded a s well as  the range of 
diaphragmatic movement from resting expi[INVESTIGATOR_656498] (sniff test). This will occur three times, at baseline prior to surgery, in the recovery room, and on the ward on postoperative day 1. All nerve blocks will be confirmed to be functional via a sensory skin test prior to surgery or in the recovery room prior to the recovery room evaluation. 
6.2 Study Dur ation: The patients will be in the study for 2 days.  The duration of 
the study should be 3 months to enroll the 22 patients.  
6.3 Individually Identifiable Health Information: PHI will be recorded but once 
data collection is done then the phi will be removed and replaced with 
unique identifier.  This is just to ensure we see the correct patient for the data collection.   
6.4 Use of radiation : n/a

10.2 Additional Safeguards:  
11.0 Local Number of Participants  
11.1 Local Number of Participants to be Consented: 40 patients consented with 
goal of 22  patients enrolled in the study 
12.0 Local Recr uitment Methods  
12.1 Recruitment Process: No recruitment posters.  Only recruit from surgical 
lists. Patients will be recruited from the group of adult surgical patients at 
the University of Minnesota undergoing shoulder surgery  and receiving an 
interscalene block sched uled for overnight stay that elected to participate in 
another ISB bupi[INVESTIGATOR_656506] . Patients will be 
approached at the preoperative assessment clinic or sur geon’s clini c at the 
Clinic and Surgery Center if possible by a resear ch staff member to 
determine their interest in participation.  If they decide to be a participant they will be consented and given a copy of their consent form for their records and a consent will be scanned and placed into EPIC.   These patients will have  significant time to review the study with research staff as well as 
the physicians performing the procedure due to the fact they arrive several hours prior to their scheduled surgery.  All subjects will have enough time to 
ask questions about the study and the potential risks involved regardless of 
which venue they are consented. 
12.2 Identification of Potential Participants: Patients will be identified by 
[CONTACT_283159]’s clinic, pre -assessment 
clinic, or preoperative area.  Patients who have opted out of research will not 
be asked to participate in the study. Patients will be approached to consent for the study by a surgeon, anesthesiologist, or member of the research team. Patients who agree to participate in the study will sign both a study

12.3 Recruitment Materials: n/a 
12.4 Payment: n/a  
13.0 Withdrawal of Participants  
13.1 Withdrawal Circumstances: Subjects who have consented prior to the day of 
surgery and for some reason choose not to participate will be withdrawn and 
a notation will be made in the study records and these people will be considered screen failures.  The surgeon may choose to withdraw the patient from  the study prior to surgery for  any medical reason or if they suffer a 
major life threatening  adverse event . 
13.2 Withdrawal Procedures: If the patient is withdrawn from study prior to the 
procedure, they will be noted in study records as screen failures. If they undergo the procedure and they decide they no longer want to be a part of the study or withdrawn by [CONTACT_099], they will be withdrawn and no further data will be collected.  This will also be noted in the study documentation. 
13.3 Termination Procedure s: If the study is terminated for any reason, or there 
is more than 5 % major adverse events the data that is already collected will 
be stored in a secure location only accessible to research personnel on this 
study. No further data will be collected if the study is terminated.  Risks to 
Participants  
13.4 Foreseeable  Risks: There is a risk of loss of privacy as well as 
inconvenience the patient as we will ultrasound them prior to and after 
surgery. Otherwise this is a minimal risk study  
13.5 Reproduction Risks: n/a  
13.6 Risks to Others: n/a  
14.0 Potential Benefits to Participants  
14.1 Potential Benefits: There are no potential benefits to the patient from this 
study.  
15.0 Statistical Considerations  
15.1 Data Analysis Plan: We will use the average of the three US exams for each 
timed measurement as the definitive measurement.  We will also use FE V1, 
FVC (or FEV6) and FEV1/FVC (or FEV6) ratio for each time period as a 
secondary measurement. This data will be be given to the statistician who will compare those in the LB ISB group to the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_656507] (if any) betw een the movement of the diaphragms in 
each group.

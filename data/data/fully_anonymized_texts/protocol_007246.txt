 1 Introduction  
This document is a clinical research protocol for a human clinical research study. This study will  be 
conducted in compliance with the written protocol and in accordance with U.S. federal research 
regulations , Good Clinical Practices standards, and NYU Langone Medical Center (NYULMC) i nstitutional 
research policies and procedures . 
 
The proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_890694] (rtACS) for the treatment of visual impairment in people with glaucoma. We will evaluate a study protocol to use in future clinical trials to test the effectiveness of rtACS to ameliorate the progressive effects of vision loss both structurally and 
functionally in the eye, the visual pathway, and in regard to people’s independence (i.e., functional ability).  
1.[ADDRESS_1247005] with and understand the many facets of everyday 
life. Vision is integral within other sensory systems as well (e.g., vestibular system). The health of 
people’s visual system influences how they learn, communicate, work, engage in leisure, and interact with the environment that surrounds them. Vision changes as a normal part of aging. Aging Americans are living longer; the generation of Americans living into older age (i.e., Baby [CONTACT_547395]) is a larger population 
cohort than previous generations. The number of Americans aged 65 years and older, ages when people 
are more vulnerable to vision loss due to age- related eye diseases, is projected to increase from 
approximately 47.8 million (2015) to 98.2 million (2060).
[ADDRESS_1247006] 
common causes of disability in the U.S.3 In a 2014 population survey, 11.3% of adults aged 45 to 64 
years and 13.5% of adults aged [ADDRESS_1247007] prevalent 
causes of progressive visual impairment and is a leading cause of irreversible blindness.13 
1.1.1  Glaucoma  
Glaucoma affects people’s capabilities to perform daily living tasks (i.e., functional ability)14-19 and their 
quality of life (QoL),20-22 even when people were unaware of their diagnosis.21 The prev alence of 
glaucoma is increasing. In the U.S. the estimated number of Americans with glaucoma will more than double from 2.7 million (2010) to 7.3 million  in 2050.
23 As many as 50% of affected people with glaucoma 
are unaware of their diagnosis.[ADDRESS_1247008] medical costs for glaucoma- related health 
care are approximately $2.9 billion annually ,25 an estimated $[ADDRESS_1247009] costs of financial burden on individuals, 
caregivers, and non- governmental healthcare payers.  
The silent burden of glaucoma is its insidious nature. The pathophysiology of glaucoma is not well understood; factors contributing to its progression include mechanical, vascular, and biochemical mechanisms.
27 The structures in the eye affected by [CONTACT_890723] (e.g., retinal ganglion cells), 
vascular (e.g., central artery and vein), and connective (e.g., trabecular meshwork) tissues. Glaucoma is typi[INVESTIGATOR_890695] (IOP), retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and optic nerve (ON) damage, and progressive loss of visual fields (VFs). Glaucoma is a chronic optic neuropathy that manifests through damage (degeneration) to the ON and death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). RGCs are neurons in the eye that transmit visual information from the retina to the brain via the ON.  
In glaucoma, secondary damage to and death of RGCs result  in visual function deficits, such as VF 
defects  and diminished contrast sensitivi ty (CS).
28,29 These secondary damages are attributed to primary 
damage at the ON  head and lamina cribrosa, a vulnerable area where the ON  connects with the axons of

authorized in writing by [CONTACT_890724] (Figure 1). In the visual system, information about the visual world is acquired, processed, and 
conveyed from the retina to visual centers in the brain by [CONTACT_890725], parallel information pathways (e.g., 
parvocellular and magnocellular pathways). These pathways represent different types of RGCs, thus play 
different roles in visual function. Glaucoma appears to selectively affect the magnocellular (M) pathway; 
this fact is important in understanding how degenerative changes in glaucoma that affect M cell s result in 
selective loss of particular visual functions. While RGCs are selectively affected by [CONTACT_78541], glaucomatous damage extends beyond the retina to upstream cortical networks
30-34 employed in vision.  
 
 
 
Figure 1.  A. The optic disc is composed of neural, vascular, and connective tissues. The convergence of the axons of 
retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) at the optic disc creates the neuro retinal rim; the rim surround s the cup, a central shallow 
depression in the optic disc. RG C axons exit the eye through the lamina cribrosa (LC) forming the optic nerve, and 
travel to the left  and right lateral geniculate nucleus, the thalamic relay nuclei for vision. B.  Glaucomatous optic 
neuropathy involves damage and remodeling of the optic disc tissues and LC that lead to vision loss. With elevated 
intraocular pressure, the LC is posteriorly displaced and thinned, leading to deepening of the cup and narrowing of the rim. Distortions within the LC may initi ate or contribute to the blocka de of axonal transport of neurotrophic factors wit hin 
the RGC axons followed by [CONTACT_890726]. Strain placed on this region also causes molecular 
and functional changes to the resident cell population in the optic nerve (e.g., astrocytes, microglia), remodeling of the extracellular matrix, alterations of the microcirculation and to shrinkage and atrophy of target relay neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus .

[IP_ADDRESS]  Glaucoma Treatment  
By [CONTACT_890727]; there are no 
interventions to restore function or reverse damage. The mainstay of treatment is management of IOP 
(Figure 2), pharmaceutically and/or surgically, because IOP is the only modifiable risk factor to date, 
though it is only one of the multiple contributors to glaucoma (e.g., loss of neurotrophic factors, localized ischemia, excitotoxicity). Beyond IOP, there is no clinical treatment for neuronal tissue loss associated with glaucoma progression. And herein lies a large focus in research: how do we intervene at the neural level to prevent further disease progression and treat the damage that neural tissue has already sustained? Two approaches are neuroprotection and neuroplasticity.

[IP_ADDRESS].1  Neuroprotection  
Neuroprotection refers to the relative preservation of neuronal integrity (i.e., neuronal structure and/or 
function) to slow or prevent disease progression. Measuring the neuronal morphology of key structures affected by [CONTACT_78541] (e.g., RNFL), even with current imaging technology, remains limited; no imaging tools are able to distinguish between complete versus partial defects versus healthy RGCs. Some RGCs survive even within damaged retinal regions.

Neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system are transient40 and only delayed the progression of 
neuronal degeneration in animal studies .41,42 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Neuroplasticity  
Another promising area of neuroscience gaining attention in vision research is neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to reorganize itself during normal aging, disease, or following injury; it

Version:  04.06.[ADDRESS_1247011] either on the border of the damaged areas of the retina 
(i.e., border of the scotoma) or within the impaired VF. A portion of cells may survive within a damaged 
structure; thus, some degree of function exists. Given the parallel processing and retinotopic nature of the 
visual system network, disease or injury that occurs at the site of early visual processing affects upstream neuronal networks.
30-34,44,[ADDRESS_1247012] and thus influence brain network connectivity (i.e., neuroplasticity).  
 The residual vision activation theory also suggests that there is therapeutic value in regions of the VF where respondents demonstrate reduced stimulus detection thresholds or in areas where they respond less reliably or slowly to the stimulus presentations. The partially damaged areas may be more susceptible to sensitivity changes, attention, and fatigue, all factors generally thought to be negative, that influence the inherent nature of subjective measurement of visual function. However , while these areas 
may be viewed as variable outcomes or less severely affected, they may be a critical target for intervention because these regions may represent only partially damaged function. Studies reported a non-linear relationship between structural damage in the eye and visual function;
43 the visual system 
involves many brain mechanisms and networks that include feedback loops with higher -order, top- down 
processes of cognition that influence visual function. For example, typi[INVESTIGATOR_890697] (see 
Attachment 1).  
 The goal of intervention based on the principles of neuroplasticity is to activate neuronal residual capabilities in the areas of residual vision. Activating surviving cells leads to increased synaptic activity and repeated activation elevates cell activity, which strengthens synaptic efficacy.  One therapeutic 
method of influencing neuroplasticity is electrical stimulation therapy (EST). And, repetitive sessions of EST are necessary to produce cumulative effects as shown in neurophysiology studies and clinical trials in rehabilitation. In this study we will evaluate the effect of one method of electric current stimulation, rtACS, as an intervention to treat visual impairment in people with glaucoma.  
1.1.[ADDRESS_1247013] to form functionally specialized networks and communicate with each other via the generation and transmission of electrical impulses carried along 
their ax ons. Neuronal network activity occurs through rhythmic firing patterns of synaptic interactions, in 
which the rhythmic changes in electric potential result in synchronized input to other brain regions, thus 
evoking oscillatory brain activity (i.e., rhythmic activity pattern).
46 When groups of neurons spi[INVESTIGATOR_890698] (i.e., nearby [CONTACT_890729]), they give rise to oscillations that reflect neuronal activity which can be measured (i.e., changes in the electric field). As a result, synchronized activity generates a more pronounced electric field (Figure 3). This electrical signal activity 
of neuronal networks is measured by [CONTACT_890730], such as electroencephalography 
(EEG), which provide information about the temporal relationships between synchronous responses.

oscillations are an organizing factor by [CONTACT_890732].
47,48 The point in time within a 
waveform cycle (i.e., phase) influences neuronal firing rates over a wide range of frequency bands:  delta (<4 Hz), theta 
(4-7 Hz), alpha (8- 12 Hz), beta (13- 30 Hz), and gamma 
(>30 Hz). Studies found frequency -specific coherence 
between cortical areas as a function of behavioral demands (e.g., sleep, wake, solving a mathematical calculation);
[ADDRESS_1247014] to the brain uses an electric current to exert an external modifying influence (i.e., modulation) to 
activate or to inhibit brain processes. Initial studies have found EST to be effective in a range of clinical 
conditions to treat functional deficits (i.e., behavioral performance) related to dyslexia,[ADDRESS_1247015] for the treatment of 
ophthalmic disease;66,[ADDRESS_1247016] called 
alternating current stimulation (ACS).69  
 
The application of ACS is a relatively recent therapeutic development. ACS influences brain physiology on a network level through synchronization of neuronal network firing using a low -intensity sinusoidal 
waveform electric current (Figure 4) to induce 
neuroplastic changes.
69 The current intensities 
produced are lower in magnitude than other stimulation 
techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation or electroconvulsive therapy, that are approved by [CONTACT_2165] ( FDA) for certain 
conditions. Francis  and colleagues (2003) 
demonstrated that neurons are sensitive to low -
intensity electrical fields and that neuronal networks are more sensitive to field modulation than the average 
single neuron.
70 The theory behind ACS is that neuronal network activity can be entrained over time (i.e., 
endogenous oscillating element starts to cycle with the same period as the exogenous stimulus) in a frequency band- specific manner when the exogenous stimulus is similar to that of the endogenous electrical 
field of that network.
71-77 Neurons acting in synchrony with the stimulation frequency can potentially induce 
restoration of function following disease or injury. Consequently, the brain activity in the range of the electrical stimulation frequency is then enhanced.

used to modulate brain oscillations at the alpha frequency. The alpha rhythm is modulated by [CONTACT_890734], likely relies on interaction dynamics between the thalamus and cortex (including occipi[CONTACT_1639]- parietal 
areas of the brain), and is thought to reflect the spontaneous rhythms of visual areas.82,83 Studies 
reported decreased alpha band activity in people who were congenitally blind84,85  or had ON 
impairm ent.80,86-88 Occipi[INVESTIGATOR_890699]; therefore, likely involved in signal transmission involved in visual perception
89 particularly in the early (ret inotopic) stages of visual information processing.90 
Therapeutically, brain oscillations are used to modulate function (i.e., behavioral performance). Studies demonstrated that transcranial ACS induced frequency -specific effects on brain dynamics as measured 
by [CONTACT_66594].
72,77,91,92 This specific stimulation paradigm has been applied to modulate vision, motor function, 
somatosensation, and cognitive and mood disorders .77,81,93,94 
 The intervention delivered in this proposed study is rtACS. Transorbital refers to the site of electrode placement and stimulation delivery; electrodes are placed on the skin near the eye. While transcranial ACS likely modulates neural oscillation focally in several  brain regions (based 
on electrode montage
95), rtACS may be effective in more 
directly modulating the neural oscillation of visual networks because the plasticity induced by [CONTACT_890735] (e.g., retina).

While there is emerging study on the mechanisms of ACS, 
what is established is that sustained ACS (minutes) can produce changes in brain oscillations and that these 
changes are plastic and cumulative with repeated sessions (Figure 5). rtACS requires further study to fully leverage this treatment modality for maximal clinical 
benefit in people with glaucoma.  
 
With innovative imaging technologies, human studies research of the neuroplasticity of visual pathway structures  has advanced. The theory of neuroplasticity is 
that after damage, structures with residual visual capabilities can be reactivated through repetitive stimulation leading to improved visual function and br ain 
network connectivity.

 1.1.4  Clinical Data to Date: Repetitive, Transorbital Alternating Current Stimulation  
The following clinical data is summarized from the published literature for rtACS in people with ophthalmic 
diseases. All of the studies reviewed involved administration of rtACS in people with ON impair ment. 
Attachment 2 summarizes the studies’ published rtACS protocols.  
 In a retrospective data analysis of 446 people, Fedorov and colleagues (2011) reported that following 
rtACS participants’ VFs significantly increased ( p < .001) by 7.1% and 9.3% in the right and left eyes, 
respectively, as measured by [CONTACT_890738].
98 Significant improvements ( p < .01) in distance visual 
acuity (VA) were also reported for each eye. A sample of [ADDRESS_1247020] 
course of treatment, VFs decreased by 4.6% ( p = .11) and 5.6% ( p = .08) in the right and left eyes, 
respectively. After the second course of rtACS, participants’ VFs remained significantly improved ( p < .05) 
in each eye compared to their baseline status (VFs increased 3.9% and 4.9% from the first course of treatment to following the second course of treatment in the right and left eyes, respectively).  
 In a masked, randomized controlled trial,
86 participants who received rtACS (n = 12, 19/24 eyes) 
demonstrated significant improvement post -intervention in their detection accuracy (high resolution 
perimetry) in the defective VF areas ( p = .03) and VA ( p < .05), both near and far, compared to a sham 
stimulation group (n = 10, 14/20 eyes). Effect sizes, comparing rtACS to sham, were moderate (.51 to 
.67) for changes in detection accuracy measured in both the defective and the entire VF and reaction time 
(high resolution perimetry). Alpha frequency significantly increased ( p < .001) in EEG recordings following 
rtACS. At 2 -month follow -up, all participants who received rtACS (including those in the sham group who 
were offered rtACS once allocation was revealed, n = 29/40 eyes) demonstrated a significant improvement in their detection accuracy measured in both the defective and entire VF and reaction time 
(p ≤ .05), mean threshold (static perimetry, p  < .01), and near VA ( p < .01).  
 
In a multi -center, masked, randomized controlled trial,
88 participants who received rtACS (n = 45) 
demonstrated significant improvement post -intervention in detection accuracy (high resolution perimetry) 
in both the defective and entire VF ( p < .001), decreased reaction time (high resolution perimetry, p = 
.02), improved mean threshold (static perimetry, p < .01), and mean eccentricity (kinetic perimetry, p  = 
.04) compared to the sham stimulation group (n = 37). Detection accuracy in the entire VF was 
significantly different between groups in favor of rtACS ( p = .01 ). Additionally, alpha frequency 
significantly increased ( p = .01) following rtACS. At 2- month follow -up, the rtACS group continued to 
demonstrate significantly better detection accuracy in the entire VF ( p = .03) and mean threshold ( p = .01) 
compared to the sham stimulation group.  
 Gall and colleagues (2011) reported QoL outcomes, using pooled data from two separate but similarly 
designed studies, for a combined number of [ADDRESS_1247021] of rtACS on both vision- related 
and health- related QoL was compared between participants who received rtACS (n = 24) versus a sham 
stimulation (n = 18). Significant differences between groups were reported in regard to vision- related 
quality of life (VRQoL) for general vision ( p = .04), distance activities ( p = .02), and social functioning ( p = 
.03) and for health- related quality of life (HRQoL) in the mental health component score ( p = .01) and 
emotion- related role limitations ( p = .03).  
 Schmidt and colleagues (2013) conducted an open- label, prospective study  and reported significant 
effects of rtACS on alpha frequency ( p = .01) in participants who received rtACS (n = 18) compared to a 
sham stimulation (n = 6).
80 The study demonstrated that, with repeated sessions, rtACS induced 
enhancement of alpha oscillations following a progressive amplification over the 10- day course of the 
intervention. Concerning visual perceptual performance (high resolution perimetry), detection accuracy 
improved following rtACS by 17.8% ( p < .001).  
 
Bola and colleagues (2014) conducted a case- control, randomized controlled trial for rtACS (n = 7) versus 
sham stimulation (n = 8) with 13 age- matched healthy controls.87 At baseline participants with ON 
impairment exhibited a breakdown in alpha frequency compared to the healthy controls ( p < .05), which 
was associated with worse visual perceptual performance measured by [CONTACT_890739] (VF

strengthened ( p = .03) compared to the sham stimulation group and was associated with better visual 
perceptual performance (detection accuracy, r  = .57, p = .04; reaction time, r  = -.56, p  =.05). The authors 
suggested that alpha frequency in the resting state could be a marker for both loss and restoration of 
visual perceptual capabilities in people with ON impairment; vision loss may not just relate to tissue damage but also to breakdown of synchronization in the neuronal network.  
1.2 Investigational Device 
We will use the DC- Stimulator MC (neuroConn GmbH, Ilmenau, [LOCATION_013]) to deliver the rtACS 
intervention per protocol.  The device is considered a medical device using the definition by [CONTACT_1622]. Non-
invasive or cutaneously administered electrical stimulation devices are deemed a Category B, Class II medical device, for which the DC -Stimulator MC qualifies.
100 rtACS is a non- invasive procedure because 
it does not involve penetrating the skin or a body cavity. The DC -Stimulator MC is a non- significant risk 
device based on: (i) it is not an implantable device, (ii) it is not used for supporting or sustaining human life, (iii) it is not used for substantial importance to diagnose, cure, mitigate, or treat disease, and (iv) it does not present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a participant. The device 
labeling (in accordance with FDA regulations at 21 CFR §812.5) includes name [CONTACT_890786], contraindications, hazards, adverse effects, interfering substances or devices, warnings, 
and precautions.
101 Additionally, the device displays the label: Caution for [LOCATION_002] Owners and 
Operators: Investigational Device. Federal (or U.S.) law limits this device to investigational use. 
 
The DC -Stimulator MC was chosen for this study based on its capacity to deliver the established rtACS 
intervention protocol documented in previous efficacy, safety, and interventional studies.80,[ADDRESS_1247022] (IRB) approval.
100 The DC -Stimulator MC allows for frequency band stimulation in the range of 0- 1,000 Hz 
and currents up to 3,000 µA (peak -to-peak) with adjustable phase for ACS. Unique to this device, it can 
be used simultaneously with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with minimal artifacts related 
to the electrical interference (though we are not using the MRI function for this study). Additionally, it has a computer -controlled sham stimulat ion function for masking interventionist to study group. The device 
will be used to deliver a weak electric current stimulation protocol to participants  via electrodes placed 
transorbitally, with one reference electrode positioned elsewhere.  
1.3 Research Risks & Benefits  
1.3.[ADDRESS_1247023] studies in the U.S. designated non- significant risk by [CONTACT_890741]. 
Evidenc e suggests that there is a general lack of observations concerning adverse events or adverse 
effects, only documentation of mild side effects. In experimental protocols following evidence- based dose 
and delivery parameters, the mild side effects of ACS included: local skin reddening, skin tingling, skin itching, skin warming sensation, nausea, diffuse or migraine- like headache, blurred vision, forgetfulness, 
difficulty concentrating, dizziness, general fatigue, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_86879] (temporary), spontaneous  
phosphenes (independent of stimulation), blood pressure fluctuation, and difficulty breathing.
103,106,108 The 
safety of ACS has been tested80,81,86 -88,98 and researchers conclude that ACS, as applied in a dose-
specific manner, is safe and tolerable.  
 We w ill assess and document per protocol adverse events (safety) and adverse effects (tolerability, see 
sections 6 and 8). To minimize the risk for adverse events and adverse effects, there are no deviations to the established rtACS protocol used in previous studies in this study design. Standard parameters for the 
application of weak current stimulation in general are
100: (1) current is less than 2.5 mA, (2) the current is 
applied through electrodes that are known to minimize skin burns at the specific current level 
administered to a participant, (3) the current application duration is less than 20 to 60 minutes per 
rtACS for people with glaucoma   Page 14

(1) dose (session duration, amplitude, electrode size and position, number of sessions) and (2) participant 
exclusion and treatment protocol.46,103,109,[ADDRESS_1247024] with a participant, research personnel will examine 
and document that: the rtACS device is functioning properly, the experimental setup is performed per 
protocol, and specific questioning and examination (as appropriate) is performed to the participant.  
 Infrequent risks that may occur include fatigue, breach of confidentiality of participants’ identifiable information (medical record information and questionnaire data), or participants may experience frustration in regard to the administration of particular tests (e.g., attention/information processing) and/or 
the time to complete study procedures. To minimize the occurrence of fatigue, participants will be 
informed that they may stop as frequently as needed to rest at time points appropriate to the standardization of the test being administered. Research personnel will provide assistance in the administration of assessments per standardized protocol as needed. To reduce the likelihood of a breach of confidentiality, access to participants’ personal information will be limited to research personnel on a need- to-know basis. Additionally, we will secure personal identifiers and clinical information in a separate 
location and limit access to this information by [CONTACT_890743]. Screening forms will be placed in a locked file cabinet and stored separately from participants’ identification files. We also will provide assurance to the participant that the recorded information will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity (other than members of the research team) except as required by [CONTACT_815641]. Participants will be advised to inform research personnel if they feel any frustration or discomfort 
about answering questions on the questionnaires. To minimize frustration or discomfort with these 
questions, participants will be educated on their purpose in this study and assisted as per standardized protocol in the completion of assessments. Any comments from participants and/or assistance provided by [CONTACT_890744].

multi- site randomized controlled trial to explore the influence of rtACS versus sham stimulation on 
neuronal morphology and physiolog y to imp rove people’s visual function, functional ability, and QoL. The 
expected outcomes (hypotheses) for this project are that (1) rtACS activates viable but poorly or non-
functional RGCs to improve their structural and functional capabilities, (2) measures of retinal, ON , and 
visual brain structures and function will correspond with improvement in visual function, and (3) changes 
in visual function following rtACS will be associated with improvements in participants’ functional ability 
and QoL.

3.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
3.2.1  Assessment of Ophthalmic Structure and Function  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assess neuronal structure and function (see section [IP_ADDRESS].1)  
Optical coherence tomography (OCT): Spectral domain OCT is a commonly used imaging technol ogy 
to evaluate glaucomatous structural damage and to detect glaucomatous progression.111,[ADDRESS_1247034] is that it enables a comprehensive assessment of the thickness of the RGC and ganglion cell nerve fiber (i.e., RNFL) layers as they approach the ON head.
[ADDRESS_1247035] is a 
reliable and reproducible method to measure RNFL and macular thickness and demonstrated sensit ivity 
and specificity in discriminating glaucomatous eyes from healthy eyes.114-119 
 
We will measure (1) peripapi[INVESTIGATOR_890701] ( µm), (2) macular ganglion cell -inner plexiform layer 
thickness ( µm), and (3) ON head cup- to-disc ratio (%); all three measures are determined from the device 
software automatically. Testing will be performed using an FDA approved device for its approved 
indication and will require 10 minutes to perform. Testing results will be printed and included with participants’ source documents.

area of large vessels and both the area (vessel density) and velocity of capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037] .123,124 Testing will be 
performed using an FDA approved device for its approved indication and will require 10 minutes to 
perform.  Testing results will be printed and included with participants’ source documents.  
 
Multi -modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) : 
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)  is a neuroimaging pr ocedure that measures brain activity 
by [CONTACT_890746]. fMRI typi[INVESTIGATOR_890703]- oxygen- level dependent (BOLD) 
contrast to map activity in the brain and has been studied to assess how glaucoma affects brain 
function.125,[ADDRESS_1247037] 
in magnetic resonance images to map white matter integrity in the brain. Studies reported compromised 
structural integrity of the optic radiations and frontal lobe in people with glaucoma.
126 We will use diffusion 
MRI to measure structural connectivity (e.g., tract -based spatial statistics of fractional anisotropy maps) of 
vision -related structures.  
 MRI scans have long been held to be a safe way to non- invasivel y visualize tissue in adults. This study 
will be performed in an FDA approved scanner. Testing will be administered per standardized protocol and will require up to 90 minutes to perform. MRI testing may be scheduled on a separate day than other testing due to timing, location of MRI facility, and patient scheduling. Testing results will be included with participants’ source documents.  
 
Electrophysiology:  
Visual evoked potential (VEP)  non-invasively assesses the function of visual pathway structures (from 
retina to visual cortex) by [CONTACT_890747][INVESTIGATOR_96067] (amplitude [ µA], latency 
[ms]). VEP is used clinically to detect glaucomatous changes and discriminates glaucomatous eyes from 
health eyes.
127,128 
 
Pattern e lectroretinogr aphy (PERG)  non-invasively assesses the function of RGCs by [CONTACT_890748] (magnitude [ µV]). PERG is used clinically to diagnose and manage 
glaucoma.129-131 
 
Testing will be performed using an FDA approved device for its approved indication and will require 15 
minutes to perform. Testing results will be printed and included with participants’ source documents.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assess areas of visual function (see section [IP_ADDRESS].2)  
Visual field : A VF test is a method to measure the full extent of the areas visible to an eye (i.e., objects 
seen centrally and in the periphery) when the eye is fixated straight ahead. VF loss is one of the leading 
visual function deficits resulting from glaucoma. Hence, VF testing is a benchmark assessment in 
ophthalmic standard of practice to quantify severity of glaucoma. We will use the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA, [LOCATION_003]), using the Swedish Interactive Thresholding Algorithm, to measure VF. Specifically, we will use the mean deviation (dB), a measure of VF sensitivity through threshold testing. The mean deviation is the deviation from the expected threshold value for a person of 
the same age and ethnicity. The Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer is a reliable and valid testing method for 
VF integrity and is considered a gold standard for the diagnosis and measurement of glaucoma.
132,133 
Testing will be administered per standardized protocol and will require 20 minutes to perform. Testing results will be printed and included with participants’ source documents.  
 
Visual acuity : A VA test is a method to measure people’s ability to distinguish detail clearly. We will use 
the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) VA tests, as they are the worldwide standard 
for VA testing in ophthalmic disease, to measure both near and far acuity (logMAR). Testing will be

documented and included with participants’ source documents.  
 
Contrast sensitivity : CS is the ability to detect detail having subtle gradations in color or luminance 
between a target and its background. It is measured over a range of spatial frequencies and contrast 
levels. In people with glaucoma, CS had a strong correlation with and was a significant predictor of 
people’s performance of daily tasks.[ADDRESS_1247038], to measure CS (log units). Testing will be administered per standardized 
protocol and will require 5 minutes to perform. Testing results will be documented and included with 
participants’ source documents.  
3.2.2  Assessment of Functional Ability and QoL  
Per standardized assessment guidelines and in order to accommodate and minimize the amount of time 
subjects may be willing and/or able to participate in research procedures at the Eye Center, assessments of functional ability and QoL may be coordinated with subjects for virtual administration (e.g., via phone, Webex, etc.).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assess the feasibility of procedures for assessment of functional ability (see section [IP_ADDRESS].1)  
Assessment of Life Habits (LIFE -H), short form 3.1: The LIFE -H is a 77 -item questionnaire developed 
to measure: (1) how a respondent accomplishes regular activities and social roles and (2) respondent’s satisfaction with how regular activities and social roles are accomplished.
135-138 Regular activities and 
social roles are daily tasks that are valued by [CONTACT_890750] -being in society 
throughout their lifespan. Regular activities include nutrition, fitness, personal care, communication, housing, and mobility and social roles include responsibilities, interpersonal relationships, community life, 
education, employment, and recreation. Testing will be interviewer -administered per standardized 
protocol and will require 30 minutes to complete. The questionnaire will be included with participants’ 
source documents.  
 
Minnesota Low Vision Reading Test ( MNRead ): The MNRead is a standardized assessment designed 
to measure reading performance in three ways: (1) reading acuity (the smallest print that can just be read), (2) maximum reading speed (reading speed when performance is not limited by [CONTACT_890751]), and (3) 
critical print si ze (the smallest print read that supports maximum reading speed).
139 Evidence suggests 
that reading speed is slower among people with glaucoma compared to normal -sighted controls140 and 
reading performance had a significant influence on people’s reading engagement (e.g., reading avoidance or restriction of tasks that required sustained reading).
141 Testing will be administered per 
standardized protocol and will require 10 minutes to perform. The MNRead score sheet will be included with participants’ source documents.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assess the feasibility of procedures for assessment of vision -related and health -related 
QoL (see section [IP_ADDRESS].2)  
National Eye Institute Vis ual Functioning Questionnaire  (VFQ -39): The 39- item VFQ is designed to 
measure VRQoL. It is a frequently used measure of VRQoL in vision science research. The VFQ -39 is 
divided into 12 subscales: general health, general vision, ocular pain, near vision, distant vision, vision-specific social functioning, vision- specific role difficulties, vision -specific m ental health, vision- specific 
dependency, driving, peripheral vision, and color vision. Responses are rated on either Likert or dichotomous (yes/no) scales. Testing will be self -administered per standardized protocol and will require 
25 minutes to complete. The questionnaire will be included with participants’ source documents.  
 
36-Item Short Form Survey (SF -36): The SF -36 is a 36 -item questionnaire developed to measure 
HRQoL. It is divided into eight subscales: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical 
health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well -being, social 
functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health. The SF -36 also includes a single item that probes a 
respondent’s perceived change in health. Testing will be self -administered per standardized protocol and

3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluate recruitment, enrollment, and adherenc e procedures (see section [IP_ADDRESS].1)  
The following feasibility information, at minimum but not limited to, that pertains to recruitment and enrollment will be tracked: number of scheduled clinical appointments reviewed, number of patients considered potentially eligible as determined during review of the clinical appointment schedule, number 
of patients who are potentially eligible but express no interest in participating in the study, number of patients who are determined ineligible following screening procedures, and etc. Additionally, data will be 
collected in regard to participants’ adherence to the study protocol regimen. All information obtained 
during pre- screening activities of those patients who do not enroll in the study will be de- identified  and 
destroyed after feasibility information is documented.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assess data entry and data management procedures (see section [IP_ADDRESS].2)  
Data will be entered and managed using an NYU and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant data collection system. Feasibility of this system between sites and timing of data 
entry/management will be assessed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assess evaluation methods: Other (see section [IP_ADDRESS].3)  
Demographic Q uestionnaire: Data will include gender, ethnicity, race, education, living situation, marital 
status, caregiver assistance, socioeconomic status, date of glaucoma diagnosis, medical and eye 
histories, glaucoma treatment regimen, glaucoma symptoms measured with the Glaucoma Symptom 
Scale,
142 and depression risk measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire- 9.143,144 The demographic

with participants’ source documents.  
 Pre-/Post -session Q uestionnaire: A data collection form and questionnaire designed specifically for this 
study will track basic health -related and intervention- related information including the following data: heart 
rate, blood pressure, visual skin observation at electrode sites, any changes in participant’s typi[INVESTIGATOR_890704], and symptoms. It will be completed at baseline, each study intervention visit (1- 10), and post -intervention. The form will require 5 minutes to complete.

4.3.1  Recruitment [NYU Langone Eye Center and [LOCATION_001] Eye and Ear Infirmary of 
Mount Sinai]  
Recruitment procedures include pre- screening activities and an introduction of the research study to 
potentially eligible patients by [CONTACT_292541] (including the clinical staff under their supervision) and/or 
members of the research team. Patients will be recruited in [LOCATION_001], [LOCATION_001], from the following 
centers: NYU Langone Eye Center and [LOCATION_001] Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai (referred to as Centers from this point forward).  
• Recruitment from the Centers will occur simultaneously.  
• Patients will be recruited in accordance with the pace the research personnel are able to schedule recruitment and screening activities.  
• Patients will be recruited until the estimated sample size is achieved, the metric for which is when the 
total number of enrolled participants projected to be randomized to the intervention group complete 
the rtACS intervention through the follow -up time point.  
 
NYU Langone Health will enroll NYU employees, including those working within the Department of Ophthalmology. Employees, who are listed on the delegation log as study team member, will not be enrolled into the research study.  
IRB approved advertisements are distributed and displayed at approved NYU Langone Health locations. Interested employees will approach the study team members to discuss the study. The eligibility 
determination procedures will follow the standard methods listed above. The study team members will 
emphasize that participation is voluntary. The person obtaining consent will also emphasize that the candidate’s  decision will not affect their employment within NYU Langone Health and/or NYU School of 
Medicine.  
Procedure  
• Pre-screening activities:  Patients’ clinical appointments scheduled with ophthalmologists involved in 
this study will be reviewed to identify potential participants with a known medical diagnosis of glaucoma. Additionally, patients’ relevant medical histories will be reviewed preparatory for research only to identify exclusionary medical and/or ophthalmic criteria. Trained research personnel in 
partnership with a clinical research coordinator and/or clinical staff will complete these procedures 
during the week prior to the scheduled appointment. This step will be implemented: 1) to minimize the 
time burden for patients and physicians in regard to research activities associated with determining study eligibility and 2) to allow patients time to consider participation in this study to maximize the efficiency of the screening process.

o Patients’ medical records will be reviewed only to identify whether they generally meet 
the research study eligibility criteria (see Attachment 3, Pre- screening Form).  
o For those patients identified as potentially eligible for the study, a research notification alert will be provided to the clinical team the day of the patient’s clinical appointment (see Attachment 3, Physician Form).  
o In addition to the eligibility criteria identified during the medical record review and only when all criteria are met, the patient’s age and phone number(s) listed as the means of contact [CONTACT_890755] -m. 
o Following pre- screening activities, de- identified information will be entered into a 
password protected electronic research file for tracking purposes (see Attachment 3, Tracking Form: Clinical Appointments Review). Recruitment forms for non- enrolled 
patients will be disposed of, following PHI procedures, once the data is entered into the research file.  
 
• An ophthalmologist, using conventional techniques, will examine patients during t heir clinical 
appointment (routine standard of care). Physicians will complete the appropriate Physician Form (see 
Attachment 3) to indicate there was no change in patient’s medical history (as it relates in general to 
the eligibility criteria for this study) identified during the pre- screening review of patient’s medical 
record. For those patients who generally meet the eligibility criteria, the physicians will introduce the research study.  If a patient expresses interest in learning more about the study, research personnel 
will discuss the study with the patient (no research activities conducted other than exchange of general information about the study and answering any questions; see Attachment 4, Recruitment 
Script [recruitment section only]).  
 
o Researc h personnel will be present as often possible at the Centers on those days when 
the physicians involved in this study are scheduled with clinical appointments.  
o When research personnel are not physically available to discuss the study, the patient 
will prov ide his/her contact (phone) information for the research team and the process will 
be documented on the Physician Form. The patient will be informed that a trained research team member will contact [CONTACT_12552]/her to discuss the research study. The research personnel’s contact [CONTACT_890756]/she is aware of whom to expect will be contact[CONTACT_139724]/her. Once the patient has been contact[CONTACT_518376], his/her contact [CONTACT_890757]. If the 
patient decides to engage in screening activities, procedures as outlined for screening 
will be followed.  
4.3.2  Recruitment [Other]  
In the case when NYU Langone Eye Center/a member of the research team is contact[CONTACT_890758],  general information in regard to 
the purpose of the protocol and the eligibility requirements  to participate  will be provided. In said case, 
said entity may send a copy of both the (1) ophthalmic health record and (2) medical health record of the 
potential candidate to [CONTACT_890788] at NYU Langone Eye Center, attention toDr. Maria De Los Angeles Ramos Cadena, for review in regard to eligibility. It is the responsibility of the interested entity to request from their eye care and primary medical providers the release of their ophthalmic and medical 
health records, respectively, to be sent to NYU Langone Eye Center. Said records sent to NYU Langone 
Eye Center will be scanned to EPIC by [CONTACT_890759]; the records are reviewed by [CONTACT_822119] a glaucoma specialist involved in this study as part of the pre- screening research 
procedures. In the case when clarification of ophthalmic and/or medical health histories is required, the record’s provider will be  contact[CONTACT_890760].  
After review of the ophthalmic and medical health records, screening procedures for the screening interview (the same as those already established, see section 4.3.3) will be con ducted ( see Attachment 4, 
Recruitment Script, Verbal Consent, and Screening Interview) which further queries/verifies potential participants’ ophthalmic and medical health histories. If eligible to participate in the protocol, said entity

Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai.  
4.3.3  Recruitment: Flyer  
An IRB approved recruitment flyer will be displayed at NYU Langone Eye Center and may be used in 
conjunction with discussions with interested persons in regard to rtACS. When a potential subject contacts a study team member, information regarding the next steps for eligibility determination will be 
conducted.  
4.3.4  Screening  
Screening procedures will be performed to identify patients’ eligibility to participate in this study. All participants will be screened to determine that they meet all eligibility criteria. Screening procedures to 
determine eligibility will be performed by [CONTACT_59856]. The screening procedures were designed such that the screening tools that require patient interaction can be administered either face- to-
face or via the telephone. This screen is minimal risk to the patient and collected information will be maintained in secured, locked files.  De-identified information (assigned a study screening code [screen 
pass or screen fail]) will be entered into a secure, NYU and HIPAA compliant database. When a patient is 
not eligible, they will be considered a screen fail. No additional information will  be collected. Only study 
personnel will have access to said records. Clinic recruitment tracking data will be collected (see 
Attachment 4, Tracking Form: Clinic Recruitment). For any patient who is determined not to be eligible or declines to participate,  any identifiable health information that was collected will be disposed of, following 
PHI procedures, once the de- identified tracking data is entered into the research file.  
 There are two components to the screening process (see Attachment 4): 1) interview and 2) medical record review. Screening procedures will require less than 30 minutes of patient’s time.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Screening Interview  
The screening interview (see Attachment 4, Recruitment Script) involves educating patients about the 
study and obtaining their verbal permission to conduct screening activities (under waiver of 
documentation of consent). Interview questions pertain to eligibility criteria, anxiety and cognitive screens.  
 Anxiety:  The GAS -10 is a 10- item instrument that measures anxiety symptoms in adults/older adults; 
items were derived from the range of anxiety disorder symptoms in the DSM- IV-TR.
148,[ADDRESS_1247050] a poorer response to rtACS. The GAS -10 will be administered per protocol. Patients who score ≥ 12 
are excluded from the study based on receiver operating characteristic analyses. Eligibility for enrollment in the study based on the GAS- 10 score will be indicated on the Recruitment Script form.  
 
Cognition: The TICS -m is a 13- item instrument that will be administered as part of the screening process 
to identify potential patients with a cognitive impairment who are likely unable to accurately complete self -
report questionnaires.
150,151 The TICS -m can be administered either face- to-face or via the telephone, 
which is why it is the tool chosen for the screening process. The TICS -m will be administered per 
protocol. Patients who score ≤  27 are excluded from the study; based on score interpretation that these 
people have greater than mild cognitive impairment.152 Eligibility for enrollment in the study based on the 
TICS -m score will be indicated on the Recruitment Script form.  
 
• Setup:  The GAS- 10 and TICS -m will be administered in a distraction free room. When administered 
via the telephone, patients will be prompted that they should be in a distraction free area and should not be interrupted during the interview.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Medical Record Review  
A review of patients’ ophthalmic medical records will be conducted as part of the screening process to 
ensure there were no significant changes identified during their ophthalmic examination to determine 
patients’ eligibility for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (see Attachment 4, Screening Form). Eligibility for enrollment in the study based on the medical record review will be indicated on the Screening Form. Patient identifiable information will only be recorded from the medical record after patients enroll in the study.  
 
Procedure: Screening  
• When trained research personnel are present at the Centers, screening procedures will be conducted 
the same day as the clinical appointment per patient’s availability.  
 
o Research personnel will be present as often possible at the Centers on those days when the physicians involved in this study are scheduled with clinical appointments.  
o Screening procedures will be conducted in a private room, distraction free, to safeguard privacy.  
 
• When trained research personnel are not available to conduct screening activities, the patient’s verbal permission that his/her information can be shared with the research team will be obtained and documented and the patient will be informed that a trained research team member will contact [CONTACT_12552]/her to discuss  the research study and screening procedures. The research personnel’s contact 
[CONTACT_890756]/she is aware of whom to expect will be contact[CONTACT_890762]/her.  
 
o Patients will be contact[CONTACT_890763].  
o Research personnel will contact [CONTACT_890764]’s permission that his/her information can be shared with the research team. 
Three attempts will be made within [ADDRESS_1247051].  
 
• When patients are not able or available to participate in screening activities the same day as their clinical visit, screening procedures will follow those described for when trained research personnel are not available.  
• Once all screening procedures are completed and the information analyzed, patients will be informed of their eligibility to participate in this study.  
 
o Patients will be i nformed of their eligibility to participate in the study as soon as possible, 
no more than two business days following completion of screening procedures. This timeframe is established to account for potential variability in the timing of the screening 
procedures, patients’ availability, and documentation of medical record review.  
 
• For those patients who meet the eligibility criteria and agree to participate in the study, trained 
research personnel will schedule a date and time to meet with the patient to r eview and obtain written 
informed consent prior to initiating administration of study assessments (see Attachment 4, 
Participant Visit Schedule).  
 In the case when NYU Langone Eye Center/a member of the research team is contact[CONTACT_890758], the screening interview will be 
conducted via phone. A health records review will be conducted again to confirm no conflicting reports 
between information gathered during the screening interview with what is documented in the entity’s 
health records. All other screening procedures are the same as conducted for the Centers.

 4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Research personnel will monitor participants throughout the course of the study. Participants may be 
withdrawn from the study as decided by [CONTACT_890765]’s role in the study. Reasons for withdrawal may include, but not be limited to:  
• Adverse event  
• Change in status relevant for inclusion or exclusion eligibility  
• Change in medical diagnosis or treatment  
• Non- compliance with study protocol  
• Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_890706]*  
• Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_890707]** 
• Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_890708]*** 
*Erythema (skin reddening) is not a criterion for withdrawal. It is an anticipated effect (monitored) that may occur following the 
intervention as a result of increased blood flow at the site of the electrodes due to vasodilation as a secondary effect of c urrent 
application across the skin and tissue barriers . 
**Headaches naturally occur in the normal population. Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_890709].  
***Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_890710] a participant expresses a desire to terminate a session, i.e., electrical stimulation would 
be aborted. In this case, when a participant requests to terminate a session, they will be withdrawn from the study.  
 
Because the risk profile of ACS is very low, no research- related injury is anticipated. The delivered current 
is weak, such that it can hardly be felt. In the unlikely event that a participant reports clinically -relevant 
harm from the study, this information will be conveyed to the study physician who will evaluate the participant. The physician will ensure that the participant has appropriate medical follow -up when 
indicated. If the event is serious and unexpected, the event will be reported to the IRB, per their reporting 
guidelines.  
4.4.2  Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects 
In the case when a participant is withdrawn from the study,  prior to the expected completion of that 
participant’s role in the study as decided by [CONTACT_59856], we will obtain written permission 
to collect relevant follow -up data that directly pertains to the safety of that participant in regard to the 
intervention (e.g., adverse event/adverse effect related to intervention). Participants may withdrawal their consent to participate in the study at any time. Any identifiable research or medical information recorded for or resulting from the participant’s participation in the study prior to the date that the participant formally withdrew consent (written notification of withdrawal) may be used and disclosed by [CONTACT_890766].  
5 Study Devi ce  
5.1 Description  
The DC -Stimulator MC (neuroConn, GmbH, Ilmenau, [LOCATION_013]) will be used to deliver the rtACS protocol. 
It can be classified a Category B, Class II non- significant risk medical device. It has the capacity to deliver 
the established rtACS protocol documented in previous efficacy, safety, and interventional studies. It is a 
multi- channel electrotherapy device consisting of a programmable waveform generator that connects to 
electrodes to deliver a non- invasive, weak electric current (see section 1.2).  
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
After obtaining written informed consent, participants will be allocated (1:1 ratio) to either rtACS or sham stimulation intervention group. The intervention protocol for each group involves 10 daily sessions delivered over 2 weeks, 1 session per day, < 60 minutes of continuous/sham stimulation (0- 100 Hz) per 
day following the established dose parameters. The rtACS group will receive the stimulation dose per protocol. During a sham stimulation session, the DC -Stimulator MC will be programmed accordingly 
which may include brief periods of stimulation at the beginning and/or end of the session, serving to 
rtACS for people with glaucoma   Page 27

authorized in writing by [CONTACT_890767] a true stimulation session. Researchers report  this is  necessary to designing the 
mask ing component of this study .  
5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
For the randomization scheme, participants will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to the rtACS and sham 
stimulation groups using blocked randomization stratified by [CONTACT_890768] (to determine any differences between the Centers). Random varying block sizes will be used to balance group allocation and minimize the risk of unmasking group assignment, and a randomization table will be computer generated accordingly. A statistician will generate a randomization table and a research staff member indirectly involved in the conduct of this study will conduct the process of allocation. Participants will be assigned in 
the order that they are enrolled. The randomization and allocation concealment will be uploaded to a 
secure database.  
5.[ADDRESS_1247052] Compliance Monitoring  
Research personnel will monitor and document participants’ compliance with attendance at scheduled baseline assessments, daily intervention sessions, and follow -up assessments. As part of the recruitment 
process, patients will be interviewed in regard to their availability to attend 10 daily sessions over a 2-week period. Participants’ baseline assessments will be scheduled to accommodate their schedule within 
reason and the timeframe for the conduct of this study. In the event when an enrolled participant is unable 
to adhere to the study protocol, consideration for withdrawal will be discussed and documented by [CONTACT_5051].  
5.5 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
During the study, participants will continue their normal glaucoma treatment regimen prescribed by  [CONTACT_153155]. Any change in said regimen or clinical procedures will be evaluated based on the eligibility 
criteria for this study.  
5.6 Packaging  
N/A. The DC -Stimulator MC device will be owned by [CONTACT_890769]. The device is treated like any patient -
care instrument used within the department. Therefore, there are no individual packaging or kits for each 
participant. Each participant will have their own set of  electrodes that will be managed per protocol (i.e., 
setup and cleaning), kept in individually labeled and sealed storage vessels, and will be stored in a 
research- designated space. In the event of device malfunction, a back -up device and extra electrodes will 
be stored onsite to avoid disruption of the study procedures.  
5.[ADDRESS_1247053] will be masked to rtACS versus sham stimulation intervention group. He/she will not be 
involved in the allocation process. The DC -Stimulator MC has a programmable sham feature to maintain 
masking.  A trained personnel who is not involved in data collection or analysis will be involved in the 
setup of the DC -Stimulator MC according to group allocation and rtACS protocol for each participant, 
following setup parameters and current standards for masking. Participants will be blind to group allocation. Following completion of the [ADDRESS_1247054], 13th floor, [LOCATION_001], NY

Version:  04.06.[ADDRESS_1247055] -
intervention and follow -up assessments for all participants will be conducted in a research- designated 
room at NYU Langone Eye Center.  
 Per standardized assessment guidelines and in order to accommodate and minimize the amount of time subjects may be willing and/or able to participate in research procedures at the Eye Center, assessments 
of functional ability and QoL may be coordinated with subjects for virtual administration (e.g., via phone, 
Webex, etc.).  
 The IRB -approved recruitment script used during the screening procedures for this study will be used for 
contact[CONTACT_890770], in conjunction with the COVID -19 Updates Research Participant Recruitment 
script provided by [CONTACT_890771]/IRB. In addition, the applicable COVID information sheet for potential and 
enrolled subjects will be provided in the appropriate situation and while they are applicable to subjects.  
 
Trained personnel who are not involved in data collection or analysis will be involved in the progr amming 
of the DC -Stimulator MC according to group allocation for each participant and the masking procedures 
that distinguish the delivery of rtACS versus sham stimulation. All intervention procedures will be conducted the same for both groups (rtACS and sham). Adverse events/adverse effects will be assessed 
in either condition.  
 
Refer to Attachment 5 for the study schedule of events and Attachment 6 for documentation forms described below.  
6.1 Visit: Baseline  
Within five business days prior to the start of intervention sessions, the informed consent procedures and

7.1 Sample Size Determination  
Given the objectives of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (see section 2) and limited data about the effect of rtACS for 
people with glaucoma, we estimate to enroll 16 participants to complete the study protocol. Our rationale 
for this number includes the following considerations: feasibility, quantifying an estimate of effect and 
estimate of variance, and validating methodologies.153 We are using a block randomization scheme with a 
1:[ADDRESS_1247058].  
7.2 Statistical Methods  
All study participants will be included in efficacy analyses as randomized (intent to treat population). Treat ment effects on all outcomes will be estimated with 95% confidence interval. Supportive analyses 
will include estimating effects in study participants who received at least five sessions of their randomized assigned treatment as supportive analyses and hypothesis testing with two- sided tests at significance 
level of 0.05.  
 
The primary outcome variables that will be evaluated in this study are structure and function of the retina 
and visual pathway (using imaging and electrophysiological technology), visual function, functional ability, 
rtACS for people with glaucoma   Page 31 
Version:  04.06.[ADDRESS_1247059] deviations (or by [CONTACT_890774]) and categorical variables will be described by [CONTACT_82658] (count) and percentages. Overall, to analyze our aims and test our hypotheses we will use between and within group 
comparison analyses (e.g., t-tests) to evaluate change scores from baseline to post -intervention and 
follow -up between rtACS and sham stimulation groups. We will use effect size calculations to evaluate 
the magnitude of differences between and within groups. Additionally, we will quantify an estimate of 
variance using 95% confidence interval. Analyses will be conducted using R statistical computing software.  
 Aim 1 ([IP_ADDRESS]) : Measure structural and functional capabilities of neuronal physiology and reorganizati on 
of the visual pathway (from eye  to visual brain)  
 We will calculate change scores between baseline and study end scores on primary outcome variables. These difference scores will then be described and compared between and within groups for: 1) structure and function of the retina and visual pathway measures and 2) visual function. We will perform a multivariate analysis to examine the correlation between measures of reti nal and visual pathway 
structure/function and measures of visual function. We will quantify estimates of effect and estimates of variance.  
 Aim 2 ([IP_ADDRESS]) : Measure objective ability/disability and subjective well -being (i.e., QoL)  
 
We will perform a multivariate analysis to examine the correlation among measures of visual function, 
functional ability, and QoL.  Aim 3 ([IP_ADDRESS]) : Evaluate the data collection, data management methods, and study procedures for 
targeted outcomes other than the primary objectives  
 
We will use descriptive statistics to analyze secondary outcomes  to measure feasibility of procedures and 
methodologies for recruitment, enrollment, data collection and data management, etc.  
7.[ADDRESS_1247060] Population(s) for Analysis  
Our primary analysis will be an intention to treat analysis. The data for all participants randomized into the 
study, regardless of study group, will be subjected to the study analyses, both for the primary and any applicable secondary analyses.  
[ADDRESS_1247061] to this pi[INVESTIGATOR_890712]’ participation in the study. Unexpected and serious adverse events that 
occur will be reported to the IRB according to the IRB protocol. The primary investigator (PI) and research 
investigator(s) involved will monitor a review of the outcome, anticipated effects, and adverse event data in determining whether the study should continue, change, or terminate. If there is a major unresolved dispute between a research investigator and a research participant or between research investigators, a letter will be submitted to the IRB describing the dispute and identifying the parties involved.  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of  the following criteria. 
• Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency  (i.e., not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent f orm, etc.)

 • Related or possibly related to participation in the research (i.e., possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156])  
• Suggests that the re s earch places participants  or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm)  
 
U
nanticipated Adverse Device Effect   
An unanticipated device effect is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, or any life- threatening 
problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated 
with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of participants . 
 
Serious injury  
Any injury or illness that  is any one of the following:  
• life-threatening  
• results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to body structure 
• necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure  
 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurr ent illnesses or injuries will be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results  of diagnostic procedures are considered adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal , 
• is associated with a serious adverse device effect , 
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms , 
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnost ic tests, or  
• is considered by [CONTACT_1372].  
 
Based on International and U.S. guidelines on serious adverse events from medical devices (including 
the Office of Human Research and Protection of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; FDA regulations at 21 CFR §312.32[a]; 1996 International Conference on Harmonization E -6 Guidelines 
for Good Clinical Practice; ISO/DIS [ZIP_CODE]- Clinical investigations of medical devices in humans, Good 
Clinical Practices, 2008), we classify a  severe adverse  event related to rtACS as a documented event 
that: 
1) Based on scientific judgment is determined to be caused or aggravated by [CONTACT_890775], such that serious adverse events not linked to stimulation are excluded, even if they are subject to reporting requirements, AND  
2) Results in irreversible damage of brain tissue, OR  
3) Results in persistent disability or incapacity that produces an unwanted and substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal  life functions (i.e., the adverse effect resulted in an 
unwanted significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in the participant’s body function/structure, physical activities and/or QoL), OR  
4) Results in unexpected inpatien t hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], where 
emergency room visits that do not result in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11241] (e.g., life- threatening; required intervention to prevent permanent 
impairment or damage; other serious medically important event), OR  
5) Results in death or is life- threatening where the patient was at substantial risk of dying as a result 
of the adverse event, or use of the device was discontinued based on evidence rtACS might have 
resulted in death, OR

a body function due to rtACS, or prevent permanent damage to a body structure, due to rtACS.  
8.[ADDRESS_1247062] (see Attachment 7) and Case Report Form. All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedure results will be recorded in the source document, gr ouped 
under one diagnosis.  
 All adverse device effects occurring during the study period will be  recorded. The clinical course of each 
event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment 
or parti cipation is not the cause.  Serious adverse device effects that are still ongoing at the end of the 
study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome ( see section 8.3).  
 
The minimum initial information to be captured in the participant’s  sourc e document concerning the 
adverse device effect includes:  
• Study identifier  
• Study Center  
• Subject number  
• Device model and serial number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  • Investigator assessment of the association 
between the event and study treatment  
• Current status  
• Whether study treatment was discontinued  
• Whether the event is serious and reason for classification as serious  
8.3 Reporting of Adverse Device Effects and Unanticipated Problems 
8.3.1  Investigator R eporting: Notifying the IRB  
Federal  regulations require timely reporting by [CONTACT_890776] . The following describes the NYULMC IRB reporting requirements, 
though investigators at participating sites are responsible for meeting the specific requirements of their IRB of record.  
 
Report promptly, but no later than 5 working days:  
Researchers will submit reports of the following problems promptly but  no later than 10 working days  from 
the time the investigator becomes aware of the event:  
• Unanticipated problems including adverse events  that are unexpected and related  
– U
nexpected:  An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately 
reflected in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, any 
applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed consent document 
and other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling.  
– Related to the research procedures : A n event is rel ated to the research procedures  if in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_17439] , the event was more likely than not to be caused by [CONTACT_28821].   
– Harmful :  either caused harm to participants  or others, or placed them at increased risk  
 
• Unanticipated adverse device effect : Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects ).

The following events  w ill be promptly reported to the IRB, though no later than 10 working days : 
• Complaint of a research subject  when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint 
cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Protocol deviations or violations  ( includes intentional and accidental/unintentional deviations  
from the IRB approved protocol) for any  of the following situations :  
– one or more participants were placed at increased risk of harm  
– the event has the potential to occur again  
– the deviation was necessary to protect a subject from immediate harm  
• B reach of confidentiality  
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C 
and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.  
• New Information indicating a change to the risks or potential benefits  of  the research, in 
terms of severity or frequency (e.g., analysis indicates lower -than- expected response rate or a 
more severe or frequent side ef fect, other research finds arm of  study has no therapeutic value,  
FDA labeling change or withdrawal from market).  
 
R
eporting Process  
The reportable events noted above will be reported to the IRB using the Reportable Events Log (see 
Attachment 7) or as a written report of the event (including a description of the event with information 
regarding its fulfillment of the above criteria, follo w-up/resolution and need for revision to consent form 
and/or other study documentation).  
 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_890713] . 
8.[ADDRESS_1247063] with the participant, the investigator will seek information on the occurrence of any known 
(anticipated) effects of the intervention by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148] (see Attachment 7, Adverse Event Reporting).  Information on all anticipated effects will be recorded 
immediately in the source document. All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic 
procedure results will be recorded in the source document, grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All anticipat ed effects  occurr ing during the study period will be reported to the appropriate research 
personnel involved in the participants’ intervention programs . The clin ical course of each event will  be 
followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or 
participation is not the cause.  Any effects that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will  be 
followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any effects that occur after the study period will  be recorded 
and reported promptly. The minimum initial information to be captured in the subject’s source document 
concerning the anticipated effects are listed in section 8.2.   
 Documented cases of mild side effects related to delivery of ACS which occasionally occurred include: erythema (skin reddening), skin tingling, skin itching, skin burning sensation, sensation of warmth at site of electrode placement, nausea, diffuse or migraine -like headache, facial muscle twitching, blurred vision, 
short -lived localized head pain or pressure, weak headache, forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, 
change in mood, dizziness, general fatigue, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_86879] (temporary), spontaneous ph osphenes 
(independent of stimulation), blood pressure fluctuation, and difficulty breathing (103, 106) . 
 Participants may experience double vision and difficulty in near vision tasks (e.g., reading), which is common, as an effect of dilating eye drops used during the clinical vision evaluation. Additionally, dilating 
eye drops may cause: redness of the eye, tearing or stinging of the eye, feeling faint or dizzy, and/or 
sensitivity to light. As it is standard of care, it is recommended that participants arrange for someone to 
rtACS for people with glaucoma   Page 35 
Version:  04.06.[ADDRESS_1247064] them in their transportation after the study visit. It is also recommended participants wear 
sunglasses when they go outside or into a brightly lit room. The effects of these dilating drops will 
disappear within 3- 4 hours after they are instilled in the eye. Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_890714]- closure event, which happens in a rare configuration of the 
eyes. There is a low risk that the instrument used to check participants’ eye pressures (standard of care) 
might cause a scratch on the cornea. All participants will be examined clinically before dilating drops are instilled to identify eyes at risk, in which no dilation drops will be used. If either of these risks should occur, the participant will be treated immediately at no cost.  
 There is minimal risk of eye infection to participants from the ophthalmic testing procedures. To reduce the risk of eye infection, all exposed surfaces near the eye, as well as chin rest and forehead rest of the instruments, will be cleaned with alcohol before participants are examined per standard practice.  
 Some research subjects have reported mild discomfort with MRI scans. MRI uses a strong magnetic field 
to create images of the body. Because of the strong magnetic field, there are risks. One possible risk is 
burns to the skin. There is an increased risk of burns from devices that conduct electrical energy. These devices can include metallic objects or skin tattoos. These devices can be either in or on the patient in order for a skin burn to occur. The FDA has found that 70% of all who reported injuries from MRIs were burns to the skin. To reduce this risk, all participants who are scanned in this study must complete thorough screening to ensure that no conductive materials are present in or on the participant’s body. 
Additionally, the power limits of the magnet will be adjusted as necessary. Another possible risk is that a 
metal object could be pulled into the scanner and hit the participant. To reduce this risk, everyone near 
the magnet will remove all metal from his/her clothing or pockets when in the scanning environment. Participants will be carefully screened to ensure no metal objects enter the magnetic field and they will be asked to place all metallic and magnetic objects in their possession (e.g., keys, jewelry, credit cards) in a 
secure location outside the magnet room.  
 
The magnetic fields, at the strengths used, are felt to be without harm and the MRI scanning procedures fall within the FDA guidelines for radiofrequency electromagnetic field exposure. It is felt these are safe levels and less hazardous than a comparable x -ray computed tomography examination. Exceptions 
include if a person has electrically, magnetically, or mechanically activated implants (such as cardiac 
pacemaker), or clips on blood vessels in their brain, or other metallic objects in their body such as 
shrapnel, bullets, buckshot, or metal fragments. Therefore, participants will be carefully screened for previous exposure to metallic fragments or to implanted devices.  
 If participants are prone to claustrophobia, they will be asked to notify the researcher in charge of the scan, who will discontinue the scan upon the participant’s request. The MRI scanner makes loud 
knocking or beepi[INVESTIGATOR_392678]; earplugs will be provided to help reduce this noise. Due to 
the rapid rate of change of the magnetic gradients during imaging, peripheral nerve stimulation is possible. If this happens, participants may feel creepi[INVESTIGATOR_144814], typi[INVESTIGATOR_144815]. Dizziness and nausea may occur if the participants move their head in the bore of the magnet. Finally, rarely there may be some heating from the radio frequency coils, the cables to the coils, 
response and physiological monitoring devices. If at any time participants feel discomfort, they will be 
instructed to contact [CONTACT_890778]. They will also be instructed in how to use an emergency 
handheld device to inform the operator if they wish to immediately stop scanning and be removed from the magnet.  
8.5 Unmasking  Procedures  
Allocation to group (unmasking) will be revealed once all participants complete the study procedures. In the event when the safety of the participant is in question, per protocol participants will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_890779]/or referred accordingly. Given the consistent 
reports for safety and tolerability of rtACS across several clinical trials, we don’t anticipate the occurrence of any adverse events or adverse effects that are the direct consequence of rtACS; therefore, there is likely not a justifiable need for unmasking to occur prior to the study’s end.

processes will reveal the allocation (database) to the study research team involved in any subsequent 
communication with participants. Participants will be informed of their group randomization at the 
conclusion of their participation in the study via face- to-face or phone conversation with research 
personnel, documented in the participant’s source document.   In the unlikely event when unmasking is deemed to occur related to managing an adverse event, the unmasking will be reported with the adverse event. In the unlikely event when unmasking is not 
associated with an adverse event, unmasking will be reported to the research team in an immediate and 
timely manner.  
8.6 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her sit e. This safety monitoring will 
include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 9). Medical 
monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of adverse events. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_890715], recruitment, retention, confidentiality, and adherence to the study protocol.  
[ADDRESS_1247065] Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
9.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study participants  will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements 
of HIPAA (1996). Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the 
following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why 
• Who will  use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 In the event that a participant  revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], 
retains the ability to us e all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.   
 All medical information collected from participants and documentation related to their participation in the 
study will be kept in a locked cabinet designated for research conducted at NYU Langone Eye Center 
during the conduct of the study. Unique patient identifiers will be used to label all data; a password-protected linking file will be accessible to/managed by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_7706]- PI. Strict standards of 
confidentiality will b e upheld at all times.

All study r elated essential documentation will also be kept in the Regulatory Binder. The assigned study 
staff will maintain participants’ study files and source documentation. Study files will be kept locked in the research offices. Following completion or termination of the study, all study documents will be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1247068], some research- related information in subjec ts’ Electronic 
Medical Records will not be immediately available in order to protect the randomization integrity of the research. The suppressed information will be accessible to subjects once the study is concluded. The information to be suppressed includes: visual field results, OCT imaging, and ophthalmic report.  
10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting 
10.1 Study Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
We will utilize operating procedures for reviewing patient safety data and source data generated from this study.  This will include routine monitoring according to the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (see 
Attachment 8), allowing for adequate time and space for such monitoring activities  and that  the monitor or 
other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access to all the above noted study -related 
documents and study related facilities.  The following aspects will be specifically monitored: enrollment 
and retention, data collection, confidentiality, multi -centers, breaches from the study protocol, and any 
adverse event.  
 Data and safety monitoring will include monthly meetings between the PI, research investigators, study 
coordinators, and pertinent study research personnel as necessary. The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
encompasses the research -related activities as they apply to recruitment and screening procedures 
conducted at [LOCATION_001] Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai. At these meetings, the research team will review the clinical ratings, assessments, clinical course, and study processes for each active participant as they apply to each Center. Specific attention will be given to data quality and timeliness, HIPAA comp liance, safe storage of data, and data backup of electronic source data. Attention will also be given 
to participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, adverse events, and other factors that can affect study outcome, including scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of the participants or the ethics of the study.  
 There are no predetermined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_890716]. As needed, a yearly report will be 
submitted to the IRB during the renewal as to the frequency of monitoring and a summary report 
addressing any recommendations to adjust the risk/benefit ratio, participant privacy, or confidentiality procedures.  
 All data will be shared with previous PI  [INVESTIGATOR_890717].

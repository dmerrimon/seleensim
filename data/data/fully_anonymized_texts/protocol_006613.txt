Title: A Non-Invasive Neuromodulation Device for Treatment 
of Migraine Headache 
Background   
 
This “Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688]” is a multi-center, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743153] 
a caloric vestibular stimulation (CVS) Device developed by [CONTACT_743231], LLC 
(SNS).  This Study has been reviewed by [CONTACT_743232] (non-
significant risk). 
 
Set forth at the end of this document is an alphabetical listing of the various capi[INVESTIGATOR_743154], and attached are various 
forms that will be used to conduct and collect data during the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688]. 
  
Efficacy of neuromodulation therapy for migraines is reasonably well-established.  
Traditionally, however, neuromodulation, especially when accomplished through an 
expensive, surgically implanted device, has been available only as a treatment of last 
resort -- to be used (and covered by [CONTACT_150401]) if, but only after, patients have 
failed all other interventions, principally pharmaceuticals.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], patients receive 
neuromodulation for migraines only after they are refractory or close to being refractory.  
SNS envisions changing that paradigm, providing effective early interventions and 
thereby [CONTACT_743233].  The CVS-M Device is non-invasive 
and utilizes the same underlying mode of neural modulation (activation of the vestibular 
nuclei in the brainstem) that for a century has been well-understood by [CONTACT_743234] -- in 
ENT practices to assess balance and in the ER to assess brain function.   The SNS Device 
is relatively inexpensive and easy to operate; it can be used safely at home by a patient 
under the supervision of a prescribing physician.   Through availability and use of the 
SNS CVS-M Device, prophylactic neuromodulation therapy for migraines can become an 
inexpensive and early, rather than an expensive and belated, therapeutic option.  
 
Experience with pi[INVESTIGATOR_743155] a theoretical understanding of CVS 
indicates that the SNS Device likely can effectively treat both epi[INVESTIGATOR_743156], but this Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743157].  The 
Investigators at the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743158], select and treat a carefully defined 
population of individuals who are current patients with an established history of epi[INVESTIGATOR_743159], but who have not

 yet become refractory to all conventional treatments.  CVS-M Device treatments will be 
evaluated as a therapy to be used alongside the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_743160] (i.e., as an adjuvant), again underscoring the potential 
advantages of earlier neuromodulation therapy intervention. Limiting participation to 
patients who meet the carefully selected qualifications will simplify how the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743161].  
 
All participants will be patients whose response to prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_743162], but limited, and whose disease state and current course represent risk for 
eventual refractoriness but who have not yet become fully refractory.  As defined in 
detail below, under International Headache Society (IHS) guidelines all of these patients 
will be classified as “epi[INVESTIGATOR_49564]” or acute.  None will be classified as “chronic.”  In 
assessing the effectiveness of the SNS CVS-M Device, the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743163] (1) a patient’s number of Headaches as well as (2) the severity of each and of all of 
those Headaches.  The current design path involves evaluating those two disease factors 
both separately and on a blended basis. The primary endpoint is based on a traditional 
measure with which both the FDA and the medical profession are quite familiar:   
outcomes data collected during the Treatment Period vs. baseline data from the Pre-
Treatment Baseline Period, focusing on comparative number of Migraine Headache 
Days. Additionally, the concept of blending those two disease measures into one 
quantitative assessment will be introduced:  a Total Monthly Headache Pain score.  As 
defined below, that Monthly measure will be the cumulative maximal Headache Pain 
Scores for all Headache Days (days on which the patient’s Headache Pain level is one or 
higher on an eleven-point scale) during the Month in question – thus, a quantitative 
indication of Total Monthly Headache Pain.  Study data can (and will) also be analyzed 
using other metrics, as described below. 
 
For the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743164]-M Device treatments, the 
therapy must provide prophylactic and/or abortive-response benefits for patients.  
(However, for clarity, CVS-M is viewed as providing adjunctive prophylactic therapy.) 
Experience from IRB-approved pi[INVESTIGATOR_743165]-M 
treatments, but not necessarily beginning immediately upon the first treatment.  For that 
reason, patients will be treated for three Months and only the Headache burden during the 
last Month will be used for comparison with baseline data. 
 
Description of the Treatment Paradigm and Study  
 
1)  Intended Use/Indication for Use 
 
• Intended Use:  The SNS CVS-M Device is intended to stimulate the vestibular 
system via external ear canals using controlled thermal waveforms.  
• Indication for Use: The SNS CVS-M Device is specifically indicated to treat epi[INVESTIGATOR_743166].

 2)  Patient Selection Criteria Pre-Treatment Data    
In working with and through their respective designated Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743167](s)/coordinator(s), the Investigators will identify and screen potential 
participants, all of whom will have previously been diagnosed as epi[INVESTIGATOR_743168]. The Investigators will review the patients' medical records to select those 
individuals whom they identify as meeting the inclusion criteria for participating in the 
Study.  
• Inclusion Criteria: Each participant must have a Pre-Treatment History that, 
when initially screened by a Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743169], documents 
that she/he meets all elements of the following:   
o The patient must have been diagnosed with epi[INVESTIGATOR_743170], consistent with the 
International Headache Classification of Headache Disorders-II (ICHD-II) 
guidelines. 
o The patient must have a history of at least three consecutive months of stable Migraine Headaches prior to entering the Study.  The patients will 
not have had changes in medication usage for the three Months leading up 
to the Study, nor will they introduce new medications during the Study 
period. Patients will satisfy these criteria: On a Monthly basis, at least 
four, and not more than a total of fourteen (4-14), Headache Days  of which between four and fourteen (4-14) are Migraine Headache Days.  
o The patient must not have failed on more than two classes of properly administered prophylactic pharmaceutical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_743171].  The patient may be on a single migraine prophylactic as long as 
the dosage has not been altered within three months of starting the Study 
and the dosage must not be altered for the duration of the Study; 
o The Investigator must have confidence in the patient's ability to reliably use the CVS-M Device and promptly complete the Daily Headache Diary 
forms and promptly return them to the Study coordinator.  That Daily 
Headache Diary will be completed from the beginning of the Pre-
Treatment Baseline Period through the end of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688]. It is 
described more fully below and in the Definitions section at the end of this 
document. 
 
• Exclusion Criteria : Individuals who:  
o are pregnant  
o have a history of cardiovascular disease  
o work night shifts 
o have been diagnosed with vestibular migraine  
o have been diagnosed with migraine with aura  
o have menstrual migraine exclusively

Page B4 of [ADDRESS_1016023] a diagnosed vestibular dysfunction   
o abuse alcohol or other drugs  
o are experiencing medication overuse Headaches (individuals with respect 
to whom the Investigator is concerned that analgesic abuse is involved 
based on the ICHD-II guidelines).  
o are less than [ADDRESS_1016024] 30 days or are 
currently enrolled in another clinical trial   
o are using Botox treatments for migraines.  
o Though not excluded, patients taking anti-histamines or anti-nausea drugs 
will be encouraged not to take such medications within four hours prior to 
a CVS-M treatment.  The Investigator should review other medications 
taken by [CONTACT_743235]-nausea or anti-
dizziness drugs as these may reduce responsiveness of the vestibular 
system to caloric stimulation.  Such medications should also be avoided 
within four hours prior to a CVS-M treatment.  
   
• Withdrawal Criteria  
o Subjects must be withdrawn from the clinical trial if any of the following 
events occur: 
 A subject does not continue to meet Inclusion/Exclusion criteria. 
 A subject is significantly non-compliant with the requirements of 
the protocol (Investigator decision). 
 A subject becomes pregnant during the trial as evidenced by a positive pregnancy test. 
 The subject develops an illness (Adverse Event) that would interfere with his/her continued participation. 
 The subject is unwilling to continue due to lack of efficacy.

  The subject withdraws his/her consent. 
 The Investigator feels that it is the subject's best interest to be 
withdrawn. 
 Scion Neurostim discontinues the study or has achieved the targeted enrollment.   
 
If the subject is discontinued from the participation in the study for any 
reason, the Investigator must make every effort to perform all evaluations 
for the final visit and document the reasons for discontinuation.  
 
• Concomitant Medications 
o The use of acute abortive medications for the symptomatic treatment of migraine headache will be allowed during the clinical trial. Subjects may 
use their usual acute abortive medications, and medications should not be 
changed during the clinical trial.  A Treated Headache will be a Migraine 
Headache for which a patient has taken an acute abortive medication. 
o The patient may be on a single migraine prophylactic as long as the dosage has not been altered within three months of starting the Study and 
the dosage must not be altered for the duration of the Study.  The patient 
must not have failed on more than two classes of properly administered prophylactic pharmaceutical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_743172]. Prophylactic 
medications used to treat other medical conditions may be used, at the 
Investigator's discretion, if the subject is taking a stable dose for at least 
three months prior to screening and continues throughout the study. 
 
3)  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743173]; Randomization 
The design size contemplates enrolling up to eighty (80) patients who will successfully 
follow through to completion of their participation in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688].  Half of these 
patients will be assigned a Treatment Device, and half will be assigned a Placebo Device.  
Whether a patient is in the treatment arm or placebo arm will be decided randomly based 
on an assignment within a sealed envelope, which will be opened only by [CONTACT_76017][INVESTIGATOR_743174].  The envelopes will be randomized 
as described below and provided to the participating clinics.  A given patient and the 
Investigator will remain blinded as to the arm to which the patient has been assigned. The 
assessment of the primary endpoints will be completed by a blinded, central Statistician. 
The patients will be told, within the informed consent document, of the existence of a 
placebo arm. 
Block randomization with a block size of four (4) will be used at each site.  Each site will 
receive sets of well-shuffled envelopes in packets of four.  A given packet will be 
completed before the next packet is opened.  Each packet of four will contain two cards 
specifying that a subject should be in the active treatment arm and two cards specifying 
the placebo arm.  This procedure results in six possible different arrangements, for four 
patients, of the ordering of treatment and placebo assignments. The unblinded Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743175]’s designation but will not share the assignment 
with the patient, Investigator, or Statistician.

 4)  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743176]; Subject Enrollment and Activities; Monitoring 
The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743177], beginning with a Pre-
Treatment Baseline Period of one Month (28 days), at the end of which the Investigator 
will reconfirm the appropriateness of the subject’s participation in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688], 
followed by a Treatment Period of three Months (84 days). 
As noted, subjects will be advised that during the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743178], medicating patterns or other interventions. 
Accommodations for rescue medications will be made, using pharmaceuticals from an 
approved list developed by [CONTACT_32366]. 
Potential participants will be required to keep a Daily Headache Diary throughout the 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743179], inter alia , to document times of CVS-M treatments.  They will 
enter the Daily Headache Diary information using a computer-based system.   
The phases and activities of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743180]: 
(i) Screening & Baseline Period:  Once the subject has been established as 
having the appropriate Pre-Treatment History, she/he will be asked to 
complete a review of the informed consent.  If the subject agrees to participate 
in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688], the subject will then complete a Screening Visit. If the 
subject is recommended for continuation in the Study after the Screening Visit 
and tentatively approved by [CONTACT_39595], she/he will start a Daily Headache 
Diary and continue to make entries for twenty-eight consecutive days. The 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743181] a Headache History Questionnaire for 
the subject. The subject will undergo a Vestibular Testing Procedure to 
establish a baseline record.  Any abnormality identified during the Vestibular 
Testing Procedure for a potential subject will be reported both to the relevant 
Investigator and to the Vestibular System Coordinator, either of whom can 
disqualify such potential subject from participating in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688]. 
 
(ii) Clinic Period : After enrollment, the completion of one Month of Daily 
Headache Diary entries, and reconfirmation by [CONTACT_743236]’s participation in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688], the subject will come to the clinic 
for appointments for two days (within the same week) for treatments and for 
training with respect to use of the CVS-M Device. During the first clinic visit, 
the subject will complete a Quality of Life and Cognition Assessment exam.  
Also, women of childbearing age will complete a urine-based pregnancy test to 
reconfirm that they are not pregnant.  The local Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743182], at random, an envelope assigning the patient to the treatment arm or the 
placebo arm.  The second clinic day may be skipped if the Study Coordinator 
feels that the patient is prepared to use the CVS-M device properly (this should 
be confirmed with a phone call on the second day). The clinic period is 
described below. 
 
On each visit during the clinic period, the subject will receive a treatment and 
be instructed in how to self-administer a defined, controlled treatment using

Page B7 of [ADDRESS_1016025] visit, the patient will complete a training 
session based on a set training module.  The patient will complete a 
proficiency evaluation and the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743183]’s proficiency in the use of the CVS-M Device.  Blood pressure will be 
monitored every five minutes until the treatment is completed. The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743184] a Visit Assessment form each day. During the 
first clinic visit, the “2-week” visit and the final visit, the relevant Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743185]-M 
Device.  The treatment delivery data from the CVS-M Device consists of 
temperature waveform files that contain actual measured temperature values 
that were delivered to the earpi[INVESTIGATOR_743186].  This data will be 
plotted in graphical form and the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743187].  This data is an independent record of 
the expected Device performance and is used for confirmation purposes only.  
The data files also record treatment times and patient compliance will be 
verified based on those time records.  At the end of training, a first Usability 
questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_102]. 
 
For clarity, the treatment schedule is: 
• Days 1 & 2: Completion of a set training module.  A single 
treatment administered by [CONTACT_76017][INVESTIGATOR_743188].  Both before 
and after the treatment the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743189] a treatment procedure is 
initiated and successfully completed.  At the end of the session 
the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743190] a treatment to herself or himself, and the 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743191], monitor and instruct as 
advisable.  If the Study Coordinator believes that the patient does 
not need a second day of training, a phone call interview can be 
conducted instead (in that case, the usability questionnaire should 
be completed on Day 1). If a second treatment day is used, a 
single treatment at the clinic administered by [CONTACT_743237][INVESTIGATOR_743192]-treat is 
recommended. If the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743193], the subject will then be allowed to continue 
twice-daily treatments at home until the end of the Treatment 
Period.  The patient will be instructed that if she or he has any 
questions or encounters any issues at home, the patient should 
immediately call the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743194]. If the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743195]-
treating at home and that additional training is needed, the patient 
will be instructed to return to the clinic the next day to receive 
such additional training.  A usability questionnaire will be 
completed.

 • Day 3-4: repeat the schema specified for Day [ADDRESS_1016026] 
needs additional training time. 
 
(iii) Treatment Period:  The eighty-four days (3 Months) following the Pre-
treatment Baseline Period constitute the Treatment Period.  This is the test period, the results from which will be measured against the Pre-Treatment 
Baseline Period data.  Specifically, data from the last Month of the Treatment 
Period will be compared with the Monthly data from the one-month-long Pre-
treatment Baseline Period. Roughly two weeks after the start of treatment, a 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743196], treatment delivery data from the CVS-M Device will be 
collected, and a Quality of Life and Cognition Assessment exam will be 
performed.  A Vestibular Testing Procedure will be completed.  A second 
usability questionnaire will be completed.  The patient will be asked to bring 
the CVS-M Device to the clinic to perform a treatment in front of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743197].  Any issues 
related to balance or other safety concerns will promptly be referred to both the 
relevant Investigator and the Vestibular System Consultant, either of whom 
can terminate the patient’s further participation in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743198]. 
 
(iv) Return of CVS-M Device & clinic visit: At the end of the Treatment Period the patient will be asked to return the CVS-M Device and a Quality of Life and 
Cognition Assessment exam will be performed. A Vestibular Testing 
Procedure will be completed.  A third usability questionnaire will be 
completed.  All remaining treatment delivery data from the CVS-M Device 
will be collected.  
 
(v) During each of the clinic visits, the relevant Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743199], collect treatment delivery data from the CVS-M Device 
according to the schedule above and complete assessment forms. Collectively, 
data from the Daily Headache Diary, Quality of Life and Cognition 
Assessment and Visit Assessments will ensure assessment of safety and also 
coverage of all six core areas of assessment highlighted by [CONTACT_220238].:  (1) 
pain; (2) physical functioning; (3) emotional functioning; (4) global ratings of 
satisfaction; (5) any negative health states and/or adverse events; and (6) 
subject disposition.  Additionally, Visit Assessments and usability 
questionnaire forms will provide information to SNS with respect to 
satisfaction with the comfort, fit, operation, etc. of the CVS-M Device.  At all 
times throughout the Study Period all subjects will have access to an Investigator or her/his designated Study coordinator by [CONTACT_756], email and/or 
visit.

 5)  Active Treatment Parameters; Placebo Treatments 
 
The following parameters will be set for active treatments using the CVS-M Device: 
• A standardized CVS time-varying waveform lasting approximately [ADDRESS_1016027] one hour. 
• The waveform schedule for active treatment patients will consist of a warm 
sawtooth delivered to one ear and a cold sawtooth delivered to the other ear.  
The warm sawtooth will go from body temperature to 42 °C, and the cold 
sawtooth will go from body temperature to 17 °C.  The two waveforms will be 
delivered simultaneously, but will have different oscillation frequencies.  After 
each two-day period, the warm and cold waveforms will be switched so that 
the opposite ears will be treated with the different caloric stimulation.  Thus 
every two days the ear receiving the cold stimulus will be switched to the 
warm stimulus and vice versa. 
 The following parameters will be set for the placebo treatments using the CVS-M 
Device:  
• A standardized CVS time-varying waveform lasting approximately [ADDRESS_1016028] one hour. 
• The waveform schedule for placebo treatment patients will consist of turning on the cooling fans and leaving the earpi[INVESTIGATOR_743200] a ~4-minute period. 
• The earpi[INVESTIGATOR_743201]. 
 
The Placebo Device will look identical to the Treatment Device and will show, on its 
screen, a time-varying waveform similar to that for an active treatment.  The y-axis of the plot will be labeled “stimulation intensity” and will not list temperature values (the same 
will be true for the Treatment Device).  A patient receiving a placebo treatment will have 
the sensation of the earpi[INVESTIGATOR_743202]. Placebo patients will not undergo material 
caloric vestibular stimulation since no temperature gradient will be created across the 
horizontal semicircular canal. (The threshold for therapeutic benefit using CVS has not 
been established, but even small temperature changes can result in nystagmus 
(Sedjawidata et al. & Vesterhauge et al.).)  The term “CVS” will not be used in 
describing the Device to any patient and no reference to caloric stimulation will be made.  
The Device will be referred to as a neuromodulation device and the specific mechanism 
of action will not be disclosed to patients. 
 
All patients will be told that they may or may not benefit from the Device in terms of

 pain reduction and that, further, the point in the 3-month treatment period at which a 
change may be noticed is unknown and may vary from patient-to-patient – i.e., the 
treatment duration necessary for a potential reduction in pain is unknown for any 
particular individual.  Patients will be told that they may or may not sense slight pressure 
from the earpi[INVESTIGATOR_6928], a warming or cooling sensation, or slight nausea or dizziness, 
especially at the end of the treatment session.  At the conclusion of the Treatment Period, 
patients will be asked to identify which arm they believe they entered (active treatment or 
placebo). 
 
6)  Safety; Vestibular System Examination and Monitoring 
CVS has been used extensively and safely in the practice of medicine since its discovery 
more than a century ago by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Robert Barany, a discovery for which he received the 
Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine in 1914.  There have been no reports in the literature 
of adverse events or significant negative side effects associated with CVS.  The side 
effect profile from use of the CVS-M Device is expected to be the same as that associated 
with diagnostic CVS procedures. 
CVS-M acts on the central nervous system via the vestibular organs.  This mechanism is 
distinctly different from most forms of neurostimulation that involve either electrical 
currents applied directly to a target nerve or region (implanted neurostimulators) or a 
diffuse current to larger areas of the cortex (TMS, CES, tDCS).  CVS is non-invasive and 
easily employed.  The SNS CVS-M Device enables its therapeutic use and utility by 
[CONTACT_743238]. 
The Berg Balance test (Berg et al.) is well-established and widely used in clinical settings 
to asses a person’s static and dynamic balance abilities.  Inter alia , the Test is used to 
quantify clinical improvement or deterioration in patients -- from evaluation of “normals” to assessment of individuals with a wide range of balance impediments.  The long form 
Test consists of 14 balance- related tasks ranging from standing up from a sitting position 
to standing on one foot.  Each task is graded from 0 – 4, and the final measure is the sum 
from all elements of the Test:  
 
• 41-56 = low risk of fall 
• 21-40 = medium risk of fall 
• 0–20 = high risk of fall 
 The Berg Balance test will provide a consistent and easily administered, task-based 
scheme for identification and quantification of deterioration, if any, of a subject’s balance 
that could be associated with use of the CVS-M Device.  The local clinical coordinators 
will undergo training on administration of the Berg test prior to the Study.  Abnormal 
findings with the Berg test may lead to a more extensive vestibular assessment 
evaluation. No unexpected side effects, nor any adverse events, have occurred in prior 
studies utilizing the CVS-M Device.

• Primary Efficacy Endpoint for the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743204]-treatment subjects as a group: During the third Month of the 
Treatment Period, their average total number of Monthly Migraine Headache 
Days will be lower than their comparable averages derived from the Pre-
Treatment Baseline Period. 
• Secondary Efficacy Endpoints for the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688]  
o The number of active-treatment subjects having a reduction of 50% or more in Migraine Headache Days during the third Month of the 
Treatment Period as compared with the Pre-Treatment Baseline Period 
will exceed the number of placebo-treatment patients having that 
response rate. 
o For active-treatment subjects as a group: During the third Month of the Treatment Period, their average Total Monthly Headache Pain Scores 
will be lower than their comparable averages derived from the Pre-
Treatment Baseline Period. 
o For active-treatment subjects as a group: During the third Month of the Treatment Period, their average number of Treated Headaches will be 
lower than their comparable averages derived from the Pre-Treatment 
Baseline Period. 
o For active-treatment subjects as a group: On average, in comparison with their Pre-Treatment Baseline Period, they will have at the end of 
the Treatment Period, improvement in scores associated with the 
Quality of Life and Cognition Assessment measures. 
• Safety Endpoint for the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688]: 
The principal safety endpoint for the Study is to verify the absence of material 
dizziness, with the associated risk of falls, as a consequence of using the 
active-treatment Device.  The Berg Balance test will be used to assess any 
changes in balance performance as a result of Device usage.  Transient nausea 
and minor dizziness may be experienced by [CONTACT_1962], as is sometimes reported 
in the diagnostic CVS literature, and patients will be trained to verify balance 
stability after a treatment and before standing up.  Previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_743205], based on patient self-reporting. 
 
8)  Calculating Total Monthly Headache Pain Scores    
For each subject the following Total Monthly Headache Pain calculations will be made: 
a. Using the Daily Headache Diary data from the Pre-Treatment Baseline Period, the 
cumulative Pain Scores for all of the days on which the subject had a Headache 
during the Month will be calculated; and 
b. For the third Month of the Treatment Period, the cumulative Pain Scores for all of

Page B12 of [ADDRESS_1016029]: Pre-Treatment Baseline Period vs. the third Month of the 
Treatment Period.  Additionally, such Total Monthly Headache Pain scores for the active-
treatment subjects as a group will be compared with those for the placebo-treatment 
subjects as a group. 
 
 
9)  Statistical Analysis and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743206], an experienced, independent and blinded Statistician will be utilized to 
analyze and summarize the Daily Headache Diaries for all patients.  Also, as noted, a 
blinded Neuropsychologist will analyze and summarize the Quality of Life and Cognition 
Assessment data, and a Vestibular System Consultant will perform a blinded analysis and

Summary of the analytical methodology to be used for the Primary Endpoints  
 
• No prospective stratification: Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
there is no medical reason to stratify the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688]’s epi[INVESTIGATOR_743207]. 
 
• Statistical method:  The Pearson’s chi-square test will be used to evaluate the 
null hypothesis, which is that “There is no difference between the number of 
Migraine Headache Days (during the third Month of the Treatment Period as 
compared with the Month during the Pre-Treatment Baseline Period) when 
comparing subjects treated with the Treatment Device and subjects treated with 
Placebo Device.”  
 
The corresponding alternative hypothesis is that: “There is a reduction in 
Migraine Headache Days (during the third Month of the Treatment Period as 
compared with the Month during the pre-Treatment Baseline Period) when 
comparing subjects treated with the Treatment Device and subjects treated with 
Placebo Device.”  
 
We seek to power the Study so as to reject the null hypothesis and accept the corresponding alternative hypothesis.  The following power calculations are based 
on probabilities from binomial distributions (2-sided test): 
• Assumed efficacy metric (response rate): a reduction of 50% or more in Migraine Headache Days with respect to baseline. 
• Assumed range of efficacy measured in the placebo arm: 10-15% 
• Assumed range of efficacy measured in the treatment arm: 45-55%

The ONSTIM (occipi[INVESTIGATOR_5617]) study (Saper et al.) recorded a placebo 
(preset stimulation) efficacy of 6% and a responder rate (reduction of 50% or 
more in headache frequency) of 39%.  Results from the PREMICE study (Cefaly, 
supraorbital transcutaneous neurostimulation) cited by [CONTACT_743239] a placebo 
efficacy of 12.1% and a responder rate of 37%.  Both studies evaluated between 
60-70 patients. Therefore, the range of 10-15% for placebo efficacy is felt to be 
relatively conservative as compared with other recent studies involving 
neuromodulation devices addressing Migraine Headache.  The assumed efficacy 
rate range for the CVS Device is based on non-statistically significant 
observations in the two previous Migraine pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602].  We therefore conclude 
that a total Study size of [ADDRESS_1016030] 
likely treatment and placebo efficacy cases.  For comparison, Topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] 
(Topamax) used as a prophylactic migraine treatment reports responder rates in 
the 37-54% range and a placebo response in the low 20% range.  Therefore CVS-
M responder rates in the 45-55% range would be clinically meaningful.  
 
• Cohort size:  Each of the sites will enroll subjects with an overall goal of [ADDRESS_1016031] completed the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743208], enrollment in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743209] (at least temporarily) and the data 
will be analyzed and summarized.  Using expected levels of efficacy for the 
Treatment and Placebo Devices, this cohort size will likely be more than adequate 
to demonstrate statistical significance and reject the null hypothesis.  The cohort 
size is also expected to be adequate to establish the low rate of unanticipated 
adverse events associated with usage of the Device.  The Sponsor may choose to 
extend the Study, with IRB approval, should it be necessary to increase the patient 
cohort size.  
  
Summary of analytical methodologies to be used for additional safety assessments 
and for the Secondary Endpoints: 
 
• Impact with respect to usage of abortive pain medications and co-morbid conditions such as nausea, dizziness, photophobia and phonophobia will be assessed based on the subjects’ Daily Headache Diary entries and the Visit 
Assessments performed by [CONTACT_743240].  An assessment 
will be made by [CONTACT_743241]: TNM™ Device 3.2

 sustained alterations in the listed measures and co-morbidities during the 
Treatment Period as separately compared with the Pre-Treatment Baseline Period. 
• Data collected from the Quality of Life and Cognition Assessment questionnaires will be utilized for two purposes.  Scoring and analysis will be performed by a 
single, highly experienced, blinded Neuropsychologist.  Analysis first will involve 
review for safety, with protocols being reviewed for changes from baseline on the 
order of one standard deviation or greater on cognitive measures (using published data) and declines indicating clinical change on affective measures. Triggering 
during this review will prompt a broader review for consideration of withdrawal 
due to negative effects. Analysis will then secondarily involve pi[INVESTIGATOR_743210]. While the present Study is not powered for detection of treatment effects on cognitive/affective measures, the acquired data can serve as pi[INVESTIGATOR_743211]. 
• The following null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis will be evaluated for the Total Monthly Headache Pain secondary endpoint: 
o  “There is no difference between the Total Monthly Headache Pain scores 
(during the third Month of the Treatment Period as compared with the 
Month during the Pre-Treatment Baseline Period) when comparing 
subjects treated with the Treatment Device and subjects treated with 
Placebo Device.” 
o “There is a reduction in Total Monthly Pain scores (during the third Month of the Treatment Period as compared with the Month during the Pre-
Treatment Baseline Period) when comparing subjects treated with the 
Treatment Device and subjects treated with Placebo Device.”

Headache Diary will ask the subject to record, for that day, what 
her/his maximum Headache Pain Score has been and the times at 
which she/he administered the treatments.  The Daily Headache 
Diary will be the principal instrument for assessing the Primary 
Endpoints and Secondary Endpoints, and the Diary data will be 
analyzed by a qualified, blinded clinical studies Statistician.  
• Enrollment Re-Confirmation Period shall be a few days (as few as 
reasonably practicable) immediately following the end of the Pre-
Treatment Baseline Period, during which time the relevant 
Investigator will evaluate a potential Pi[INVESTIGATOR_743218]’s data from the Pre-Treatment Baseline Period, assess all other factors and 
determine whether the individual should be enrolled and scheduled 
to begin treatments.  
• Headache shall mean a pain located within the subject’s head when 
the subject assigns to it a Pain Score between one and ten on the 
Headache Pain Scale. 
• Headache Day shall mean a day during which the subject has a

have a Headache – that is, a day when the subject has a Headache 
Pain Score of zero. 
• Headache History Questionnaire shall mean a listing of patient 
history elements relevant to the assessment of her or his migraine headache status. 
• Headache Pain Scale shall mean an eleven-point pain measurement 
scale from zero (no pain) to ten (most intense pain).  The pain data will also be mapped onto a four-point (0 – 3) scale and to a 
description based on “mild/moderate/severe” categories to facilitate

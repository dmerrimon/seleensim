1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care (JJVC) has developed a soft contact [CONTACT_607938] 
(EMO -118) for the purpose of controlling myopia progression in pediatric populations .A six -
month dispensing clinical trial ( )wasconducted , which indicated that EMO -118 lens 
was efficacious in slowing myopia progression in  children between 7 and 12 years of age af ter
6 months of wear .5The EMO -118 lens is further e valuated in a longer -term, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397] 
( ) for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the lens meeting sp ecific 
requirements from heath authorities.  study is currently on -going.
The EMO-200 lens is a “re-design ”of EMO-[ADDRESS_805786] the same geometr y and optical design, and are in the same 
senofilcon A material. The “re-design ”was driven by [CONTACT_607939] .In other words, the EMO -118 
lens design was “re -generated” using the upgraded lens design sy stem and w as given a new 
lens design code of EMO -200. Asdocumented in , the two lens designs are 
equivalent. Based on the thorough comparison between theEMO -[ADDRESS_805787] methods, raw 
materials, and/or manufacturing process, it is d etermined that it is prudent to confirm the 
clinical per formance of the EMO -200lens in a sample of pediatric pati ents that the lens is 
intended to be used.
The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that the redesigned EMO-200 lens is non-inferior 
to the EMO-118 with regards to visual perf ormance and lens fit acceptance. These two 
endpoints are selected as surrogate assessments of the optics introduced to the eye that drives 
myopia control.
1.1. Name [CONTACT_607969] -200 (Test lens) an dEMO -118(Control 
lens).Both the Test and Control lenses aremade of the same mater ials using the same 
manufacturing p rocess as the ACUVUE OASYS®Brand Contact [CONTACT_449269]™ 
Technology (cleared by [CONTACT_179937] K042 275). Both lenses have the same op tical design 
intended for controlling the progression of m yopia through introducing relative plus powers to 
the lens, an d both lenses have the same diameter and ba se curve. As specified in the technical 
report ( ), the two lens designs are equivalen t.Further details about the test 
articles are found in Section [ADDRESS_805788] lenses (Test: EMO-200, Control: EMO-
118) is for correcting myopia and slowing axia l elongation and myopia progression in children.
Both lenses are intended to be worn in daily disposable modality. During this study, eachsubject will wear both test articles once within on e study visit (one lens type in each of the two 
periods). Each lens type will be worn by [CONTACT_607940] 2 hours. This is a non-
dispensing study; no study lenses will be dispen sed to the subjects to take home to wear.

1.3. Summary of Findings from Nonclinical Studies 
All previous pre-clinical findings were deemed satisfactory prior to proceeding with clinical 
trials on humans. For the most comprehensive nonclinical information regarding the
investigational lens refer to the latest version of the Investigator's Brochure for EMO Design 
Family Lenses.[ADDRESS_805789], glaucoma, periph eral retinal degeneration, retinal detachment, and 
myopic macular degeneration,11myopia is likely to become a leading cause of permanent 
sight-loss.12-14Research has shown that early onset of myopia and moderate amount of myopia 
at young age are risk factors for future high degrees of myopia,15while “s lowing myopia by 1 
diopter should reduce the likelihood of a pati ent developi[INVESTIGATOR_607922] 
40%”.16As such, it can be considered most advan tageous to control the progression of myopia 
and start treatment at an early age when myopia is at a low level.[ADDRESS_805790] lenses for myopia control include 1) contact [CONTACT_607941]; 2) contact [CONTACT_607942] a pediatric population; and 3) risks 
specifically associated with EMO family of lenses, such as potential sub-optimal visual 
performance and long-term physiolog ical and/or neurological impact. 
Assessments regarding contact [CONTACT_607943] a daily wear basis. 
The daily disposable modality of the investigational lenses further reduces risks associated with lens care and the use of care products (e .g., cleaning, disinfecting, rinsing and storage, 
etc.). Anticipated adverse reactions with these len ses are the same as any other soft contact 
[CONTACT_607944] 13.1. In addition, the most recent review of the
safety of con tact lens wear in children concluded that “the incidence of corneal inf iltrative 
events in children is no higher than in adults, and in the youngest age range of 8 to 11 years, it 
may be marked ly lower”.
18In addition, in all JJVC-sponsored prospective, pediatric soft 
contact [CONTACT_607945],  which involves [ADDRESS_805791] lens wear in children (aged 7 –15 years at baseline), there have been 
no serious or significant ocular  adverse events (AE) reported.5,19The rates of contact [CONTACT_607946]-significant ocular AEs were found to be consistent with those reported in the 
literature and are similar to, if not less than, the rate for adults, supporting the conclusion that 
children can safely wear daily disposable soft contact [CONTACT_13276]. 
Due to the unique optical design of the EMO lenses, visual performance of these lenses may 
not be equivalent to that of lenses with a c onventional spherical lens design. To manage the 
risk, special attention will be paid to visual acuity, visual complaints (e.g., blurry vision or 
CR-6441, v 2.0

Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
visual artifacts such as ghosting or haloes, etc.), and subjective visual acceptance while fitting 
the study lenses. In addition, the study lens power may  be modified based on visual acuity and
refraction over the study lens. There has been no evidence in the literatu re suggesting any long-
term physiological or neurological risks associ ated with children being exposed to chronic 
myopic defocus (e.g., due to under correction)  or to multi-focal optical interventions. For

4. STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE 
4.1. Description of Study Design 
This is a multi-center, randomized, controlle d, double-masked, 2x2 cross-over, non-dispensing
study. Each subject will be bilat erally fitted with one of the two test articles in each of the two
periods during a single visit, which includes:Visit 1: Subject scre ening, baseline evaluation, random ization, lens fit #1 and #2, and final 
evaluation
If a subject meets all edibility criteria, then they will be randomized to one of two lens wear 
sequences. Subjects will be fitted in a bila teral fashion in their first study lens per the 
randomization scheme. Study assessments will be performed on the first lens. After undergoing 
all assessments, the first study lens will be removed, and subjects will have a 15-minute 
washout period prior to be fit with their se cond lens per the randomization schedule. Study 
assessments will be con ducted while wearing the [ADDRESS_805801] articles at study closure. 
CR-6441, v 2.0  
Page 24 of 133JJVC CONFIDENTIAL 
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
4.2. Study Design Rationale 
This study is designed as a confirmatory clinical trial to demonstrate that visual acuity and fit 
acceptance of the EMO-200 lens is non-inferior to those of the EMO-118 lens using a 2×[ADDRESS_805802]  variability from the treatment comparisons. 
Subjects will be randomized into the two lens w ear sequences: Test/Con trol or Control/Test. 
Randomization removes potential for systematic err or or bias and balances both the known and 
unknown confounding factors that may affect the study outcomes. A potential limitation of crossover design is the carry-over effect from th e previous treatment. A washout period of [ADDRESS_805803] the same diameter and base cure and are made in the same 
material. The EMO -200 lens is manufactured in Ireland for support ingcommercialization . It 
isconsidered a “re -design” of the EMO -[ADDRESS_805804] no reason to believe that the clinical 
performance of the two lenses would be differe nt.The effective ness of the optical design in 
myopia correction and slowing axial elongation and refraction change of t he eye has been 
demonstrated in  with the EMO -118 lens. Any deviation in the EMO -200 lens from 
the intended optical and/or mechan ical designs, which m ay lead to the lens potentially being 
less effective, will be manifested as differences in the lens visual performance and or fit 
performance, compared to the EMO -[ADDRESS_805805] reported ocular symptoms with the study lenses will be collected. 
4.3. Enrollment Target and Study Duration 
Approximately 67 subjects will be  enrolled in the study with a minimum of 56 subjects targeted 
to complete the study. The point of study enrollment is defined as the execution of the informed 
consent and assent at Visit 1.
Approximately 4 –6 clinical sites in the [LOCATION_002] will participate in the study. Each site 
is expected to screen (enroll) up to 17 subjects with a minimum 10 subjects completing the 
study. Subjects will be enrolled among participati ng clinical sites to ensure the target number 
of completed subjects is met.The total duration of the study enrollment will be approximately 10 weeks, unless otherwise 
approved by [CONTACT_1034].
CR-6441, v 2.0  
Page 25 of 133JJVC CONFIDENTIAL 
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
There will be one scheduled visit in this study. Eligible subjects will be bilaterally fitted with 
both test articles within one visit. The total durati on of the study is expected to be 12 weeks 
(including the enrollment period).
5. TEST ARTICLE ALLOCA TION AND MASKING 
5.1. Test Article Allocation  
The study lenses will be worn in a bilateral an d random fashion using a 2x2 crossover design 
with [ADDRESS_805806] will 
randomly be assigned to one of two unique sequences of the two lens types (Test/Control, or 
Control/Test).
Permuted block randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to 
treatment, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. Each 
block will contain two different lens trial sequences. The randomizat ion scheme will be 
generated using the PROC PLAN procedure in Statistical Analysis System (SAS) Software 
Version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]).[ADDRESS_805807] occurred prior to 
randomization: 
•Informed consent must have been obtained.
•The subject must have met all eligibility criteria.
•The subject’s screening and baseline in formation must have been collected .
When dispensing test articles, the following steps shall be followed to maintain randomization 
codes:
1. Investigator or designee (documented on th e Delegation Log) will consult the lens 
fitting schedule to obtain the test article assign ment for that subject prior to dispensing.
2.Investigator or designee will record the s ubject’s number on the appropriate line of the 
lens fitting schedule.
3. Investigator or designee will pull the a ppropriate test articles from the study supply. 
All test articles that are opened, whether di spensed (placed/fit on eye or dispensed 
outside the clinical site) or not, must be  recorded on the Test Article Accountability 
Log in the “Dispensed” section .
5.2. Masking 
Masking will be used to reduce potential bias. This is a double-masked study where subjects, 
investigators and clinical site personnel involved in the data collection will be masked to the 
identity of the assigned study lenses.

Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
6.4. Packaging and Labeling 
The test articles will be packaged in blisters a s the primary packaging. The test article will be 
over-labeled to mask the subject and investigator s to the identity of the lens. The test articles 
will be in plastic bags as the secondary pa ckaging form. The sample study label is shown 
below:
6.5. Storage Conditions 
Test articles will be maintained at ambient temperatures at the clin ical site. Test articles must 
be kept under secure conditions.
6.6. Collection and Storage of Samples 
When possible, any lens or test article associated with an Adverse Event and/or a Product 
Quality Complaint must be retained and stored in  a glass vial with moderate solution pending 
directions from the sponsor for potential return to JJVC.
6.7. Accountability of Test Articles 
JJVC will provide the Investigato r with sufficient quantities of study articles and supplies to
complete the investigation. The Investigator is asked to retain all lens shipment documentation 
for the test article accountability records. 
Test articles must be kept in a locked storage cabinet, accessible only to those assigned by [CONTACT_35500]. The Investigator may d elegate this activity to authorized study site 
personnel listed on the Site Delegation Log. All tes t articles must be accounted. This includes:
1. What was dispensed for the subject for trial fitting;
2. The number and reason for unplanned replacements.
If there is a discrepancy between the shipment documents and the contents, contact [CONTACT_265230] .

13.2. Assessing Adverse Events 
In conjunction with the medical monitor, the Investig ator will evaluate advers e events to ensure 
the events are categorized correctly. Elem ents of categorization will include:
xSeriousness/Classifications (see definition in section 13.1).
xCausality or Relatedness –i.e. the relationship between th e test article, study treatment 
or study procedures and the adverse event (not related, unlikely related, possibly 
related, or related - see definition in section 13.2.1).
xAdverse Event Severity –Adverse event severity is used  to assess the degree of 
intensity of the adverse event (mild, moderate, or severe - see definition in section 13.1).
xOutcome –not recovered or not resolved, recovering or resolving, recovered or 
resolved with sequelae, recovered or resolv ed, death related to adverse event, or 
unknown.
xActions Taken –none, temporarily discontinued, permanently discontinued, or other.
13.2.1. Causality Assessment 
Causality Assessment –A determination of the relationship between an adverse event and the 
test article. The test article relationship for each  adverse event should be determined by [CONTACT_19575]:
xNot Related- An adverse event that is not re lated to the use of the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures.
xUnlikely Related –An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more 
likely, e.g. concomitant treatment, concomita nt disease(s), or the relationship of time 
suggests that a causal relationship is not likely.
xPossibly Related –An adverse event that might be due  to the use of the test article, or 
to the study treatment or study procedures. An alternative explanation, e.g. concomitant 
treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is 
reasonable. Therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded.
xRelated –An adverse event that is li sted as a possible advers e effect (device) or adverse 
reaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably exp lained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g.
concomitant treatment of concomitant disease( s). The relationship in time is very 
suggestive, e.g. it is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]-challenge and re-challenge.
13.2.2. Severity Assessment 
Severity Assessment –A qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an adverse event 
as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The assessment of 
severity is made irrespective of test article, study treatment or study procedure relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale:

xMild –Event is noticeable to the su bject but is easily tolera ted and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities .
xModerate –Event is bothersome, possible re quiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subjec t’s daily activities.
xSevere –Event is intolerable, necessitates a dditional therapy or alteration of therapy 
and interferes with the subject’s daily activities .
13.3. Documentation and Follow-Up of Adverse Events 
The recording and documenting of adverse events (ocular and non-ocular) begin when the 
subjects are exposed to the test article, study  treatment or study procedure.  Adverse events 
reported before the use of test article, start of  study treatment, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if the co ndition deteriorates at any time during the study 
it will be recorded and reported as an AE. Unto ward medical events reported after the subject’s 
exit from the study will be reco rded as adverse events at th e discretion of the Investigator.
Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_93792].  
Complete descriptions of all adverse events mu st be available in the subject record. All
Adverse Events including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for “serious 
adverse events” shall be captured on the approp riate case report form or electronic data system. 
All adverse events occurring whil e the subject is enrolled in the study must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship.  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to maintain documentation of each reported adverse event. 
All adverse events will be followed in accordance with applicable licensing requirements. Such 
documentation will include the following:
xAdverse event (diagnosis not symptom).
xDrawings or photographs (where appropriate)  that detail the finding (e.g., size, 
location, and depth, etc.).
xDate the clinical site was notified.
xDate and time of onset.
xDate and time of resolution.
xAdverse event classification, severity, and r elationship to test articles, as applicable.
xTreatment regimen instituted (where appropr iate), including concomitant medications 
prescribed, in accordance with applicable licensing requirements.
xAny referral to another health care provider if needed.
xOutcome, ocular damage (if any).
xLikely etiology.
xBest corrected visual acuity at the discove ry of the event and upon conclusion of the 
event, if the AE is related to the visual system.

Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
Upon discovery of an AE that is deemed ‘pos sibly related’ or ‘related’ to the test article or 
study procedures (whether related to the vi sual system or not), an AE review form 
must be completed. Addition al dated and initialed entr ies should be made at follow -up 
evaluations. Separate forms must be completed for each eye if the AE is bilateral. 
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he/she will complete the Corneal Infiltrate Assessment 
eCRF. Where necessary, a culture of the corneal lesion will be collected to determine if the 
infection is microbial in nature. If cultures are collected, the date  of culture collection and 
laboratory utilized will be recorded. 
Changes in the severity of an AE shall be docu mented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of the onset  and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Changes in the 
assessment of relationship to the Test Ar ticle shall also be clearly documented.
Subjects who present with an adverse event shall be followed by [CONTACT_737], within 
licensure, until all signs and symptoms have r eturned to pre-treatment status, stabilized, or 
been satisfactorily resolved. If further treatmen t beyond licensure is required, the patient will 
be referred to the appropriate health care provide r. The Investigator will use his/her clinical 
judgment as to whether a subject reporting with an adverse event will continue in the study. If 
a subject is discontinued from the study, it will  be the responsibility of the Investigator to 
record the reason for discontinuation. The Investig ator will also document the adverse event 
appropriately and complete the Adverse Even t eCRF. Any subjects with ongoing adverse
events related to the test article, study treatment or study procedures, as of the final study visit 
date, should be followed to resolution of the adverse event or until referral to an appropriate 
health care provider, as recommended by [CONTACT_18413]. Non-ocular adverse events that are 
not related to the test article, study treatmen t, or study procedures may be recorded as 
“ongoing” without further follow -up.
13.4. Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an ad verse event by e-mail, facsimile, or telephone 
as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours from discovery for any serious /significant 
adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for any non-significant adverse event. In addition, 
a written report will be submitted by [CONTACT_607957]/IRB according to 
their requirements (section 13.4.2). The report w ill comment whether the adverse event was 
considered to be related to the test article, study treatment or study procedures.
13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor 
Serious/Significant Adverse Events
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of all serious/significan t adverse events occurring 
during the study period as soon as possible by e-mail or telephone, but no later than [ADDRESS_805812] igator is obligated to pursue and obtain 
information requested by [CONTACT_35519]. All 
CR-6441, v 2.0  
Page 49 of 133JJVC CONFIDENTIAL 
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
subjects experiencing a serious/significant adve rse event must be followed up and all outcomes 
must be reported.
When medically necessary, the Investigator may break the randomization code to determine 
the identity of the treatment th at the subject received. The Sponsor and study monitor should 
be notified prior to unmasking the test articles.
In the event of a serious/significant adverse event, the Investigator must:
xNotify the Sponsor immediately.
xObtain and maintain in the subject’s records all per tinent medical information and 
medical judgment for colleagues who assisted  in the treatment and follow-up of the 
subject.
xProvide the Sponsor with a complete case history which includes a statement as to 
whether the event was or was not re lated to the use of the test article.
xNotify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB reporting procedure according to 
national regulations.
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE)In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) A dverse Device Effect (UADE), the Investigator 
will submit a report of the UADE to the Sponsor and IEC/IRB as soon as possible, but no later 
than [ADDRESS_805813] report the results of the 
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB and participati ng Investigators within [ADDRESS_805814].Non-Serious Adverse Events
All non-serious adverse events, including non-ser ious adverse device effects, will be reported 
to the sponsor by [CONTACT_35521] 2 days from discovery.
13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to the Respo nsible IEC/IRB and Health Authorities 
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requirement s for reporting must be reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site w ill refer to and follow any guidelines set forth 
by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site wi ll refer to and follow any guidelines set forth 
by [CONTACT_19582].
The Sponsor will report applicable Adverse Events to the local health authorities according the 
written guidelines, including reporting timelines.
13.5. Events of Special Interest 
None identified.

[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
13.6. Reporting of Pregnancy 
Subjects reporting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270]-report) during the study will be discontinued after the 
event is recorded as an Adverse Event. On ce discontinued, pregnant participants and their 
fetuses will not be monitored for study r elated purposes. Pregnant participants are not 
discontinued from contact [CONTACT_129815], but due to 
general concerns relating to pregnancy and con tact lens use. Specifically, pregnant women are 
discontinued due to fluctuations in refractive error and/or visual acuity that occur secondary to 
systemic hormonal changes, and not due to unforeseen health risks to the mother or fetus.
14. STATISTICAL METHODS 
This section is a general outline of the statistical methods that will be implemented in this 
clinical trial. More details will be included in the stand-alone Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
The standalone SAP will be finalized and si gned prior the database lock and unmasking. 
14.1. General Considerations 
Statistical Analysis will be undertaken by [CONTACT_35522]. A 
general description of the statistical methods to be implemented in this clinical trial is outlined 
below.
All data summaries and statistical analyses will be performed us ing the SAS software version 
9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]).32Throughout the analysis of data, the results 
for each subject/eye will be used when avai lable for summarization and statistical analysis. 
Unscheduled visits will be summarized separ ately and will be excluded from the statistical 
analysis.Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or fr equency tables) will be provided for all baseline 
variables, efficacy variables and safety variables as appropriate. Continuous variables will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean,  standard deviation [SD], median, minimum 
and maximum). Frequency count and percentage of subjects or eyes within each category will 
be provided for categorical data.
14.2. Sample Size Justification 
This study wasdesigned and powered to demonstrate non -inferiority of the Test lens (EMO -
200) compared to the Control lens (EMO -118) with respect to monocular distance logMAR 
visual acuity under bright HLHC and lens fit acce ptance after 10 -minute lens settli ng period. 
The ample size was calculated for both the primary and secondary endpoints to achieve a 
minimum statistical power of 80% using a 2-sided type I error of α=0.05 based on historical 
data from  was a 2×2 crossover study w ith two study lenses (EMO -116 
and EMO -118). In  all eyes had acceptable lens fit. Table 6 below presents the 
descriptive statistics of monocular logMAR  visual acuity under bright HLHC at fit ting 
observed from .

Lens Fit 
AcceptanceNon-inferiority (-10%) 56 81%
As indicated in Table [ADDRESS_805815] 80% for both primary and 
secondary endpoints. The plan is to enroll approximately 67 subjects with a target of 56 to 
complete the study. 
14.3. Analysis Populations 
The following analysis populations will be defi ned and used in the analysis and presentation 
of the data.
All Enrolled:
All Enrolled Population includes all subjects with  recorded data in the electronic Case Report 
Form (eCRF) database.
Intent-To-Treat (ITT):
Intent-to-treat will include all th e subjects who were randomized to study treatment. Subjects 
will be analyzed as per randomized treatmen t. At least one observation should be recorded.
Subjects with major protocol deviations, including, but not limited to non-compliant to protocol specified lens wear time requirements, ineligible subjects who were inadvertently 
randomized and primary endpoint measurements collected without or with non-valid device 
verifications, etc., will be included in the ITT analyses.
Safety Population:
All subjects who were administered any test article excluding subjects who drop out prior to 
administering any test article. At least one observation for safe ty endpoints should be recorded 
(e.g., ocular symptom, slit-lamp finding, etc.) on or after treatment start date. Subjects will be 
analyzed as per treatment received.
Per Protocol (PP)
All subjects who have completed the study and di d not substantially deviate from the protocol 
as determined by [CONTACT_35524]. Justification of 
excluding subjects with protocol deviations in the per-protocol population set will be 
documented in a memo to file. See Section 10 for definition and examples of major deviations.
14.4. Level of Statistical Significance 
All planned analysis for this study will be condu cted with an overall type I error rate of 5%. 
14.5.  Primary Analysis 
Non-inferiority of Test compared to Control with  respect to the primary endpoint of monocular 
logMAR visual acuity will be assessed on the Per-protocol population (PP). 
CR-6441, v 2.0

Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
Monocular Distance logMAR Visual Acuity (VA)
Monocular distance logMAR VA under bright HLHC will be an alyzed using a linear mixed 
model to compare the Test and Control lenses after a 10-minute lens setting period. The model 
will include lens type, lens sequence, and period as fixed effects. Other subject characteristics 
such as age, gender and race will be include d as fixed covariates when appropriate. Site and 
subject will be included in the model as random  effects (G-side). The covariance of residuals 
between measurements on the same eye across peri ods within the same s ubject (R-side) will 
be modeled using Unstructured (UN) covarian ce structure. If the model does not converge, 
then other covariance structures, such as compound Symmetry (CS) covariance structure, will 
be considered. The Kenward and Roger method (Kenward & Roger, 1997)35will be used for 
the denominator degree of freedom. 
Hypothesis Testing
The null and alternative hypotheses for testing non- inferiority of the Test lens relative to the 
Control lens with respect to logMAR visual acuity are as follows: 
ܪ଴:ߤ்− ߤ஼≥0.05
ܪ஺:ߤ்− ߤ஼ <0 . 0 5
Where, ߤ்represents the mean logMAR VA score for the Test lens and ߤ௖represents the mean 
logMAR VA score for the Control lens. Non-infe riority will be declared if the upper bound of 
the 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the difference (Test –Control) is less than 0.05.
14.6. Secondary Analysis 
Non-inferiority of Test compared to Control with respect to the secondary endpoint of lens fit 
acceptance will be assessed on the safety population. 
Letܻଵandܻଶdenote the binary outcomes of lens fit acceptance (Yes/No) in left and right eyes, 
respectively, when wearing a study lens. Considering the correlation, ߩ , between ܻଵandܻଶ, the 
distribution of the sum ܻ = ܻଵ + ܻଶis obtained by [CONTACT_340377]. One of them 
follow a binomial distribution ݊݅ܤ(2,݌)with mixing probability (1− ߩ)and the other one 
follows a modified Bernoulli distribution, ݊ݎ݁ܤܯ( ݌) ,taking value 0 and 2 rather than 
conventional 0 and 1, with mixing probability ߩ:
ܲ(ܻ = ݕ| ݌,ߩ( = ) 1− ߩ)݊݅ܤ( 2,݌)ܫ஺ଵ +  ݊ݎ݁ܤܯߩ( ݌)ܫ஺ଶ ,
whereܫ஺ଵ = { 0 ,1 ,2 } ,ܫ஺ଶ= { 0 ,2 } and݌is the probability of success (i.e., acceptable lens 
fitting).To overcome the complexity of th e mixture likelihood a latent variable ܼ
௜, i = 1, 2 is introduced 
in the model to indicate in which component of the model the observation ݕ௜, i=1, 2, belongs 
to, that is,
ܼ௜=൜1, if the observation belong to the MBern(p),
0, if the observation belong to the Bin(2, p)  
CR-6441, v 2.0  
Page 54 of 133JJVC CONFIDENTIAL 
Clinical Study Protocol
[COMPANY_012] Vision Care, Inc.
The joint distribution of the augmented data (ܻ௜,ܼ௜),݅=1 , 2 , is given by
P(Y=y୧,Z=z ୧| p,ρ)
=  ρ୸౟p୷౟୸౟/ଶ(1−p)(ଶି୷౟)୸౟/ଶ(1−ρ)ଵି୸౟൬2
y୧൰p୷౟(ଵି୸౟)(1−p)(ଶି୷౟)(ଵି୸౟)
The probability p links to the regression cova riates through a logit tr ansformation as follow:
logit (p)=  β଴+ βଵlens +  δ+ߛ
It is assumed that β଴,βଵ and ρ to be independent with a non-informative prior N(0,1000) for 
β଴ andβଵ,and beta(0.5,0.5) for ρ. δand ߛare the subject-specific and site-specific random 
effects, respectively. We assume random subject effects are independent and identically 
distributed as  δ~ N(0, ߪ௦௨௕௝ଶ) and random site effects are independent and identically 
distributed as  ߛ~ N(0, ߪ௦௜௧௘ଶ). For the variances of random subject and site effects, an 
independent non-informative conjugate prior inverse-gamma(0.001, 0.001) will be used. The 
Metropolis sampler algorithm as implemented in the SAS/STAT MCMC Procedure (SAS 
Institute Inc., 2015)36will be used to estimate the posterior distributions of the parameters ( β଴,
βଵ, ρ). Inferences will be made based on a poster ior credible interval for the relevant 
parameters.
Hypothesis Testing
The null and alternative hypotheses for testing non- inferiority of Test relative to Control are as 
follows:
H଴: p୘− pେ≤− 0.1
Hଵ: p୘− pେ>−0.1,
where p୘and pେare the probability of success (i.e., acceptable lens fitting) for Test lens and 
Control lens, respectively. Non-inferiority will be declared if the posterior probability  p(݌்−
 ݌஼>−0.1|data )≥.975.
In the case of all eyes have an acceptable lens f it (i.e., zero unacceptable lens fit), a Bayesian 
hierarchical model accounting for zero event problem will be considered (Chen & McGee, 
2008).37Details of this model will be provided in the stand-along SAP.

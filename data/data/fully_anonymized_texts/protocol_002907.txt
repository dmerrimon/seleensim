Study Center :  University of Arizona Cancer Center  
 
Primary Objective:  To evaluate if there is a significant change in  serum estradiol levels in 
patients with breast cancer when treated with vaginal estrogen preparation, Estring 
 
Secondary Objective:  
1. To assess if there is improvement  in vaginal symptoms on treat ment with Estring 
 
Primary Endpoint : To measure changes in serum estradiol level compared to their baseline in 
patients with breast cancer when treated with vaginal estrogen preparation, Estring 
 
Secondary Endpoint :  
1. To measure changes in vaginal dryness s ymptom questionnaire compared to their 
baseline while on treatment with Estring  
 
Study Design:  This study is a prospective single arm Phase II trial to evaluate changes in 
serum estradiol levels in patients with breast cancer when treated with vaginal estr ogen 
preparation, Estring. We will also collect data from a chart review of patients who were 
treatment in a similar manner as a part of their routine standard of care.  
 
Number of Patients:  We plan to consent 14 -20 patients, with the goal of accruing a total of 14 
patients to receive treatment on this prospective single arm, Phase II trial. 
 
Main Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion:  
 
To be eligible for inclusion, each patient must have: 
- Diagnosis of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer  as defined by [CONTACT_8415] g uidelines  
- Attained menopause as defined by [CONTACT_78464] 
- On adjuvant hormonal therapy with aromatase inhibitors, Anastrozole or Letrozole or 
Exemestane 
- Be informed of the nature of this study and provide written informed consent in 
accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior to any study specific 
procedures  
- Be willing and able to comply with the treatment plan, scheduled clinic visits, laboratory  
tests  and other study procedures  
- Greater than [ADDRESS_97666]: 
 
- Metastatic disease  
Intervention : Patients with breast cancer treated at the University of Arizona Cancer Center will 
be enrolled in this trial. Patients who are currently being treated with adjuvant aromatase 
inhibitors  (anastrozole, letrozole or exemestane)  will be screened by [CONTACT_89024]. Once identified , they will be consented to this study and be treated 
with Estring for their symptoms .  
 
Duration of Intervention: Patients will get a baseline serum estradiol level measured prior to 
receiving Estring . We will repeat serum estradiol levels at 4 weeks, 12 weeks  and 16 weeks . 
Estring  will be stopped if there is evidence of continued rise in serum estradiol . Also, it will be 
discontinued if there is development of persistent ≥ grade 3 vaginal discomfort or bleeding or  if 
the patient chooses.  
 
Statistical Methods: This study is a prospective single arm Phase II trial to assess changes in 
serum estradiol levels when treated with vaginal estrogen preparation, Estring. We plan to enroll 
14 patient s into this study . 
 
Analytic plan for primary objective:  
There is no statistical significant difference in the serum estradiol levels at week 16 compared to 
baseline.  
 
Analytic plan for secondary objective:  
Vaginal dryness questionnaire will be completed and scores will be compared between baseline 
and [ADDRESS_97667] common life threatening malignancy in women, with over 200,000 new cases diagnosed in the [LOCATION_002] annually.
1 With early detection and 
novel treatment strategies survival has increased, increasing the number of survivors experiencing the short - and long- term consequences of estrogen deficiency.  
 
1.2. Background  
 
Majority of these cancers express  estrogen receptors (75%) and/or progesterone 
receptors making endocrine manipulation a very effective therapeutic option. Several endocrine options with proven efficacy are currently available for treatment. Factors 
guiding the oncologist’s decision on the type and duration of endocrine therapy include the patient’s menopausal status, response to prior trials of endocrine treatment, and 
consideration of side -effect profiles. Tamoxifen, a selective ER modifier, may be used in 
pre-, peri -, and postmenopausal women.
2,[ADDRESS_97668] contraindications to tamoxifen use include ovarian suppression and ablation.
4 In postmenopausal women, where the majority of estrogen 
is derived from the peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogen, the incorporation of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) into treatment regimens has shown benefits in the early
5-[ADDRESS_97669] been isolated, ER -α and ER -β, with a varied proportion of each type of 
receptor in various tissues .
11 In general, the activation of these receptors  at the nuclear 
level by [CONTACT_89025]/or other cofactors is needed to induce cell growth and differentiation. ERs are heavily concentrated in the vulva, vagina, pelvic floor 
musculature, endopelvic fascia, bladder, and urethra.
12,13 As a result, the urogenital 
system is exquisitely sensitive to estrogen deprivation. A decline in estradiol concentrations results in a reduction in squamous epi[INVESTIGATOR_89013] a predominance of basal cells.
14 Moreover, collagen, 
glycogen, mucopolysaccharides, and hyaluronic acid significantly decline in hypoestrogenemic urogenital epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]. The vaginal walls therefore become thin, 
friable, pale, and hyposecretory, and lose their elasticity with progressive stenosis, while 
the urethra develops increased atrophy and laxity .
14 The uterus, ovaries, vagina,and 
vulva also shrink in size.15 Symptoms of estrogen deprivation include: vaginal dryness, 
Revision 3, May 14, 2018

 itchiness, discharge, incontinence, burning, and pain during sexual intercourse. 
Concomitant with these changes is a reduction in the vaginal Lactobacillus population, 
which in turn leads to greater vaginal alkalinity (pH > 5) and further contributes to the 
greater risk f or urinary tract infections .[ADDRESS_97670] been reported using a variety of quality of life scales, 
making an overview analysis challenging. Nonetheless, the literature has demonstrated 
a clear increase in the incidence and progression of gynecologic symptoms following chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy. Ganz et al. reported that up to 50% –75% of 
breast cancer survivors experience one or more urogenital symptoms.
17 Treatment with 
both chemotherapy and tamoxifen seems to compound the severity of symptoms 
versus treatment with either agent alone.18 Vulvovaginal atrophy in turn contributes to 
increasing sexual dysfunction, reported as dyspareunia, diminished libido, and decreased sexual satisfaction.
19,20 In a separate study, the severity of sexual symptoms 
and vaginal dryness negatively correlated with self -perceived quality of l ife, and 
perception of partner quality of life [32].21In recent years, multiple endocrine therapy 
trials have prospectively evaluated the prevalence of gynecologi c symptoms in studies 
comparing tamoxifen with AIs. Reported results of urogenital side effects from AIs suggest less tolerable vulvovaginal symptoms in comparison with those observed wit h 
tamoxifen. Morales et al.  found an increase in severe or intolerable dyspareunia among 
women started on nonsteroidal AIs, from 11% at baseline to 25% after 3 months of treatment, which was significantly associated with vaginal dryness.
22 Similarly, a cohort 
of women in the Arim idex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination trial after 5 years of 
treatment with anastrozole reported rates of dyspareunia, diminished libido and 
decreased sexual satisfaction, and vaginal dryness of 17.3%, 34.0%, and 18.5%,  
respectively.23 In comparison, among patients taking tamoxifen, reported side effects for 
dyspareunia, diminished libido and decreased sexual satisfaction, and vaginal dryness 
were significantly lower at 8.1%, 26.1%, and 9.1%, respectively ( p< .05).[ADDRESS_97671] infections among menopausal women varies depending on the presence of risk factors such as diabetes
24 or the presence of urinary prolapse25, with 
reported incidences in the range of 5% –8%.25,[ADDRESS_97672] ranged between 3.5% [38] and 
8%, while the incidence of urinary tract infections among women taking tamoxifen has 
been reported to be as high as 10% .

been inconsistent. They adhere to the vaginal epi[INVESTIGATOR_89014] a moisture barrier but 
do not reverse the atrophic changes, which are the root cause of the symptoms moreover; they have minimal effect on urinary symptoms.
[ADDRESS_97674] cancer patients receiving aromatase inhibitors has not been studied.

 Vaginal estrogen has been used effectively to treat postmenopausal genitourinary 
symptoms. Estrogen can be delivered locally as vaginal cream (Estrace and Premarin), 
ring (Estring and Femring) or tablet (Vagifem). The optimal treatment regimen, minimum 
effective dose and duration have not been established. A Cochrane review of 16 clinical 
trials conducted on 2,129 postmenopausal women concluded all formulations of local 
estrogen therapy had efficacy in relieving subjective genitourinary symptoms.29 There 
was also an improvement in vaginal elasticity, fluid volume and moisture unlike vaginal 
moisturizers which provide only symptomatic relief but do not alter objective atrophic 
findings. North American Menopause Society (NAMS) published a position statement in 
[ADDRESS_97675] cancer patients is related to their absorption and systemic 
levels of estrogen (estradiol, E2) and the theoretic al concern that these levels could 
stimulate breast cancer growth.   
 
Clinical Studies using topi[INVESTIGATOR_89015]  
 A drop in serum estradiol levels following consistent use with either Estring or Vagifem  
has also been well documented among menopausal women without a prior history of breast cancer [51, 64].

estrogen values of 21.7– 101 pmol/l among the control group resulting from variations in 
laboratory analyses .
[ADDRESS_97677] cancer risk could not be established. Further 
highlighting the need for a sensitive estradiol assay for women taking AIs was a small study of 10 patients before and after AI use who had up to a 70% difference in estradiol 
levels when measured by [CONTACT_89026] -extract ion with 
an organic solvent .

delaying blood sample processing by 1 day has been shown to spuriously increase 
estrogen levels by 7.1% (95% CI, 3.2% –11.3%) .[ADDRESS_97679] ratio for disease recurrence of 0.57 (95% CI, 
0.20 –1.58; p = .28) .
36 A separate study of seven women taking AIs with subsequent 
intolerable urogenital side effects documented serum estradiol levels after treatment 
with Vagifem 25 µg. Estradiol levels rose from a mean baseline level of < 5 pmol/l to a 
mean of 72 pmol/l at 2 weeks, and then declined at 4 weeks to a median of 16 pmol/l. Two women had high estradiol levels after [ADDRESS_97680] reported that at 12 weeks, serum estradiol levels were within

who are on adjuvant hormonal treatment with aromatase inhibitors . They will be 
screened for genitourinary symptoms and will be offered to participate in this study. Enrolled patients will be treated with vaginal estrogen preparation, Estring, for their 
symptoms.

4.3 Study E xit 
 Patients will continue with study visits until study exit. Patients will exit the study at 
16 weeks  or withdrawal. Each patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any 
time without prejudice. Should a patient withdraw from the study prior to completion, 
the reason(s) must be stated in the chart and on the case report form. All procedures 
(laboratory evaluations , study questionnaires  and adverse events  reporting ) should 
be performed at the study exit visit. If a patient stops Estring prior to the study completion then they will go off study at that time of discontinuation.  
If a patient is noted to have a serum estradiol level of >10pg/ml at week 16 then Estring will be discontinued.

Patients will be consented and evaluated for participation based on the following 
procedures which will be performed within 28 days of study entry  (time of consent)  
before being registered and starting treatment  
• Documentation that patient has genitourinary symptoms  
 
5.2.  Patient Registration  
 Patients must be registered prior to initiation of treatment. Patients will be registered through a Breast Team Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) from 8:00 a.m. to 5:[ADDRESS_97690]  Time, Monday through Friday, (excluding holidays)  
 
Regi stration Guidelines 
Before a subject participates in the trial, the investigator or delegate is responsible for 
obtaining written informed consent after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, 
anticipated benefits, subject responsibilities and potential  hazards of the study and 
before any protocol- specific screening procedures or any study required  medications  
are administered. All patients must meet the eligibility requirements and complete the 
screening visit prior to registration. Once registration is  complete treatment may begin.

6. Criteria for Evaluation  
The primary endpoint is the change in serum estradiol level compared to baseline. Other 
efficacy measures are changes in vaginal dryness questionnaire .  The SAEs will be 
assessed at time of week 4, 12 and 16 (+/ - 7 days) by [CONTACT_89030].    
Evaluation Criteria Definitions  
6.1. Treatment related toxicity is an adverse effect  that is clearly related to Estring . 
  
7. Drug Information  
 
ESTRING® (estradiol vaginal ring) is a slightly opaque ring with a whitish core containing a drug reservoir of 2 mg estradiol. Estradiol, silicone polymers and barium sulfate are combined to  form 
the ring. When placed in the vagina, ESTRING releases estradiol, approximately 7.5 mcg per 24 hours, in a consistent stable manner over 90 days. 
Estradiol is c hemically described as estra- 1,3,5(10) -triene- 3,17β -diol. The molecular formula of 
estradiol is C18H24O2 and the structural formula is:  
 
The molecular weight of estradiol is 272.39.  
Revision 3, May 14, 2018

Pharmacokinetics  
A. Absorption  
Estrogens used in therapeutics are well absorbed through the skin, mucous membranes, and 
the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The vaginal delivery of estrogens circumvents first -pass 
metabolism.  
In a Phase I study of 14 postmenopausal women, the insertion of ESTRING (estradiol vaginal ring) rapi[INVESTIGATOR_89016] (E2) levels. The time to attain peak serum estradiol levels (Tmax) was 0.[ADDRESS_97692] declined 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_89017] 24 hours and were virtually indistinguishable from the baseline mean (range: 5 to 22 pg/mL). Serum levels of estradiol and estrone (E1) over the following 12 weeks during which the ring was maintained in the vaginal vault remained relatively unchanged (see Table 1).  
The initial estradiol peak post -application of the second ring in the same women resulted in ~38 
percent lower Cmax, apparently due to reduced systemic absorption via the treated vaginal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]. The relative systemic exposure from the initial peak of ESTRING accounted for approximately 4 percen t of the total estradiol exposure over the 12- week period.  
The release of estradiol from ESTRING was demonstrated in a Phase II study of 222 postmenopausal women who inserted up to four rings consecutively at three- month intervals. 
Systemic delivery of estradiol from ESTRING resulted in mean steady state serum estradiol estimates of 7.8, 7.0, 7.0, 8.1 pg/mL at weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48, respectively. Similar reproducibility is also seen in levels of estrone. The systemic exposure to estradiol and estrone was within the range observed in untreated women after the first eight hours.  
In postmenopausal women, mean dose of estradiol systemically absorbed unchanged from 
ESTRING is ~8 percent [95 percent CI: 2.8–12.8 percent] of the daily amount released locally.  
 
B. Distribution  
The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens 
are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormone binding 
globulin (SHBG) and albumin
.  
C. Metabolism  
Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. 
Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is the major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion 
Revision 3, May 14, [ADDRESS_97693] -application 
of ESTRING in a Phase I study was 5 percent and 8 percent, respectively, of the daily released amount.  
 
8. Study Statistics  
 
8.1. Analytic plan for primary objective: Patients will get a baseline serum estradi ol level 
checked and at week 4, 12 and 16. Serum estradiol level of 10pg/ml is used as cut off 
point. All patients will have serum estradiol level ≤10pg/ml at baseline. At week 16, the 
proportion of patients with serum estradiol level >10pg/ml is used to assess the presence of an unacceptable increase change in serum estradiol level. With sample 
size of [ADDRESS_97694] serum estradiol level  >10pg/ml at week 16, it will be 
concluded that the probability of serum estradiol level >10pg/ml at week 16 is less than 
10% (based on the upper limit of a one -sided 95% confidence interval). The proportion 
of patients with serum estradiol level >10pg/ml at week 16 and its one- sided 95% 
confidence interval will be estimated. The mean change in serum estradiol level 
between baseline and week 16 and its 95% confidence interval will be estimated.  In addition, to assess the presumed maximum change in serum estradiol level, the mean 
change in serum estradiol level between baseline and week 4 with its 95% confidence 
interval will be estimated.  
 
 
8.2. Analytic plan for secondary objective: The patients  will complete the vaginal dryness 
symptoms questionnaire at basel ine and week 16.   The mean (standard deviation) and 
median of scores at  baseline and week [ADDRESS_97695] will be 
used to evaluate if there is a significant change in the score between baseline and week 16.   
  
9. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
Identification of the DSMB obligated for oversight responsibilities:  
The Arizona Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will provide ongoing 
oversight for this trial.  
 
Identification of the entity obligated for routine monitoring duties:  
Routine monitoring will be provided by [CONTACT_89031]/Quality Control (QA/QC) 
Program to ensure that the investigation is conducted according to protocol design and 
regulatory requirements.  
Revision 3, May 14, 2018  
  16 
  
Monitoring progress and data review process:  
Routine monitoring of subject data will be conducted at least every six months.  
 
The first routine monitoring visit  will include at a minimum:  
• Informed consent – 100% of cases enrolled;  
• Subject eligibility - 50% of cases, up to two subjects;  
• Data review - 50% of cases, up to two subjects.  
 All subsequent monitoring visits will consist of randomly selected subject cases based on 
current enrollment and include continuing review of previously selected cases, as applicable.  
 
A monitoring visit report and follow -up letter will be completed within two weeks of the 
routine monitoring visit; a copy will be maintained in the study file. A query/finding form will also be completed by [CONTACT_89032], clarification, 
information or corrections to the CRF and/or regulatory records. The Clinical Research 
Coordinator or other applicable staff responsible for the study will be given a copy of this 
form for resolution of queries/findings. The query/finding form will be maintained with a copy 
of the visit report for follow -up at the next monitoring visit.  
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_89018], completeness, legibility and timeliness of 
the data reported in the Case Report Form (CRF). Source documentation supporting the 
CRF data will indicate the subject’s participation in the trial and will document the dates and details of study procedures, adverse events, and patient status.  
 Case report forms, which include the inclusion/exclusion criteria form,  adverse event forms 
and serious adverse event forms should be completed with a black ball -point pen or typed. 
Corrections to the forms should not obscure the original entry and should be made by [CONTACT_89033] a single line. Each strike should be accompanied by 
[CONTACT_89034]. All subject forms and study files will be 
stored in a secure area limited to authorized staff.  
 
Note:  Routine monitoring of regulatory documents and test article will be conducted at least 
annually.  
 
Process to implement study closure when significant risks or benefits are identified:  
 
There is no planned interim analysis. Results will be analyzed after 14 patients are enrolled 
and data is collected for all of them.  
 
Description of adverse events and reporting procedures: 
 
Adverse Event  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily 
have a causal  relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
Revision 3, May 14, [ADDRESS_97696] form and 
reviewed by [CONTACT_079].  
 All adverse events will be classified using either the MedDRA term or NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 and will address:  
• Grade  
• Relationship to study drug(not related, unlikely, possible, probable, definitely)  
• Causality other than study drug (disease related, concomitant medication related, intercurrent illness, other)   
• Date of onset, date of resolution 
• Frequency of event (single, intermittent, continuous)  
• Event outcome (resolved, ongoing, death)  
• Action taken (none, held, dose reduced, discontinued, medication given)  
 
Serious Adverse Events 
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening 
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89019]  
• Results in disability persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Note : Important  medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical interventi on 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
All SAEs which meet the criteria for a reportable event will be reported to the University of Arizona Human Subjects Protection Program within 10 working days of the event date or 
receipt of notification of the event.  
 Non-local Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to Subjects or Others, which is any 
information that meets all three of the following criteria:  
i) Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are  described in the protocol- related documents, such as the IRB-
approved research protocol and informed consent; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied. A harm is “unexpected” when its specificity and 
severity are not accurately reflected in the consent document.  
ii) Related or possible related due to participation in this research (possible related means 
that the outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
iii) Suggests that the research places subjects  or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. A harm is “at least probably related to the Human Research procedures” 
if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the research procedures more likely than not 
caused the harm.  
 
Plan for assuring data accuracy and protocol compliance:

 DETAILED PROTOCOL  
 
I.  BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Living with multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by [CONTACT_627068], presents a significant challenge for many patients. Depression 
and anxiety are co mmon, occurring in up to 50% [1]and 35% [2] of patients, respectively. 
Health -related quality of life (HRQOL) i s often impaired and has been shown to deteriorate 
following a relapse [3]. Positive psychological constructs such as positive affect, optimism and 
subjective well -being may play an important role in adaptation to chronic disease [4]. In patients 
with MS, positive constructs have been shown to be negatively associated with depression and 
anxiety [5-7] and positively associated with physical, social and psychological adjustment  [7, 8]. 
A psychosocial intervention aimed at increasing positive constructs may facilit ate adjustment 
and improve HRQOL in patients with MS.  
 
Positive psychology (PP) uses targeted activities to increase the frequency and intensity of 
positive  emotional experiences  [9]. Targeted activities span several domains, including gratitude 
(e.g.,  systematically recalling positive life events), using one’s personal strengths in a d eliberate 
manner and  altruism (e.g., performing acts of kindness). Two meta -analyses of PP interventions 
(PPI) demonstrated  that these interventions significantly enhanced subjective well -being and 
were effective in reducing  depressive symptoms in both dep ressed and non -depressed 
individuals. Studies that included multiple  PP exercises were more effective than approaches that 
used a single activity. The benefits of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_627062] 6 months [10, 11] 
 
Although there are a few studies of PP for individuals with medical illnesses, no RCT of PP has 
been p ublished in MS. Members of our team have experience adapting PP interventions for 
medically ill patients including patients with acute cardiovascular disease, type [ADDRESS_835679] in pat ients with MS. This may lead to decreases in depression, anxiety 
and fatigue and improvements in HRQOL and self -reported functional activities such as work.  
 
II.  SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
This phase I randomized controlled trial (RCT) will examine the efficacy of an at home positive 
psychology (PP) training intervention to increase positive affect in patients with multiple 
sclerosis (MS).  The RCT will include a five -week intervention phase and a five -week extension 
phase.  
 
Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the tolerability and acceptability of a five -week at home PP training 
intervention for MS patients. We will assess the tolerability of the intervention by [CONTACT_627069].  We w ill determine the 
acceptability of each exercise by [CONTACT_627070].  
3 
  
Specific Aim 2 : Examine the efficacy of PP training to improve positive affect, emotional 
function, health -related quali ty of life (HRQOL), and self -reported functional activities. We will 
compare positive affect in subjects in the intervention and control group at the completion of the 
intervention phase.  We will also assess between -group differences in depression, anxiet y, fatigue, 
HRQOL and work productivity following the intervention phase.  
 
Specific Aim 3:   Determine if improvements in positive affect, emotional function, HRQOL and 
self-reported functional activities following PPI [INVESTIGATOR_627063]. For subjects in the 
intervention group who demonstrate a benefit from PPI, we will determine if that benefit is 
maintained by [CONTACT_627071], depression, anxiety, fatigue, HRQOL and work 
productivity at the completion of the intervention and extension phases . 
 
III.  SUBJECT SELECTION  
 
Thirty subjects with MS will be enrolled at the Partners MS Center.  Subjects will be recruited 
from the Comprehensive Longitudinal Investigation of Multiple Sclerosis at the Brigham and 
Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_627064]:  The  CLIMB Study (1999P010435).  
 
Inclusion criteria:  
1. Diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome or MS  
2. Age 18 -65 
3. Able to read and write in English  
4. Enrollment in the CLIMB study  
 
Exclusion criteria:  
5. Moderate or marked cognitive abnormalities on brief mental status testing identified by 
[CONTACT_627072]. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
 
All CLIMB subjects being seen at the Partners MS Center for a routine clinical visit will be 
identified.  They will be approached by [CONTACT_627073] a PP study and will 
be given a study flyer.  Additional flyers may be posted at the Partners MS Center.  Interested 
individuals will be brought by [CONTACT_627074] a member of the research staff to 
learn about the study in more detail.  They will be given a copy of the consent form to review.  
They will have the opportunity t o discuss the study with their physician as well as other members 
of the research study staff prior to giving consent.  Individuals will have at least [ADDRESS_835680] will include an intervention phase (Phase I) and an extension phase (Phase II).

Enrollment Visit ( 60 minutes)  
Subjects will be enrolled at the Partners MS Center at the Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   At 
enrollment, all subjects will be consented and assigned a study subject ID.  Subjects will 
complete a battery of patient reported outcome (PRO) measures in REDCap, a secure web 
application for building and managing online surveys.  The PRO measures include:  
 
1. Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)  [12] is comprised of two [ADDRESS_835681] -Revised (LOT -R) [13] is a 6-item measure of optimism and pessimism 
and the most widely used measure of optimism.  
 
3. Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6328] (CES -D) [14] is a 20 -item self -report 
measure of de pression that focuses on the cognitive and affective rather than the somatic 
components of depression.  
 
4. State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) [15] includes two 20 -item questionnaires designed to 
measure the current te mporary condition of  “state” anxiety and the more general and long -
standing quality of “trait” anxiety.     
 
5. Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) [16] is a [ADDRESS_835682] of fatigue on physical, cognitive and psychosocial functioning.  
 
6. Health Status Questionnaire (SF-36) [17] is a widely -used generic measure of HRQOL.  It 
yields an 8 -scale profile of functional health as well as physical and mental he alth summary 
scores.  
 
7. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI) [18] is a 6 -item measure 
of health -related work productivity (absenteeism and presenteeism) as well as the effect of 
health problems on the ability to perform regular daily activities.  
 
8. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a 10 -item measure of the degree to which situations are 
perceived as stressful [19].  
 
9. Brief Resilie nce Scale ( BRS) is a 6 -item scale that measures the ability to bounce back or 
recover from stress  [20].  
 
10. State Optimism Measure (SOM) is a 7 -item measure of “state” optimism or optimism at the 
present moment.  
 
 
Using a computerized random number generator, subjects will be randomized to the intervention 
or control group.

Intervention Phase (5 weeks)  
In the intervention phase (Phase I: Weeks 1 -5), subjects randomized to the intervention group will 
be given a study participant manual and asked to set up a time for weekly phone calls with the 
study trainer.  They will complete five weeks of PP exercises,  one exercise per week. They will be 
asked to rate their mood prior to and after completing each exercise.  They will also be asked to 
rate the ease and utility of each exercise. The weekly calls with the study trainer will be used to 
review the completed exercise and introduce the next exercise. These calls will be recorded so that 
a percentage (10%) of these recordings can be reviewed to ensure that the PP and goal -setting 
portions of the intervention are being delivered as described in the protocol and s tudy trainer 
manual. The control group will have no study activities during  intervention phase and will be 
considered a wait -list control. At the completion of the intervention phase, all subjects will be 
emailed a link to complete PRO measures in REDCap.  
 
Extension Phase (5 weeks)  
In the extension phase (Phase II: Weeks 6 -10), subjects in the control group will receive their study 
participant manual in the mail. They will be contact[CONTACT_627075].  They will complete the PPI [CONTACT_65593]. The intervention group will complete no 
study activities in the extension phase.  At the completion of the extension phase, all subjects will 
be emailed a link to complete PRO measures.  
Intervention : The PP intervention consists of five weeks of PP training using the following 
exercises:  
 
1. Gratitude for positive events:  Recall three positive events that occurred in the past week 
and write about the events and how the events made you feel.  
 
2. Personal strengths:   Complete a brief survey of personal strengths and select a strength 
such as perseverance or humility and use it deliberately in the next 24 hours. Write about 
how you used the strength and how you felt while using it.  
 
3. Gratitude letter:  Recall another i ndividual’s kind act that resulted in joy, relief, serenity or 
other positive feelings. Write a letter to the person describing feelings of gratitude 
associated with this event.  
 
4. Enjoyable and meaningful activities:  Intentionally complete three acts in a single day – a 
pleasurable act done alone, a pleasurable act done with others and a meaningful or 
important act.  
 
5. Remembering past successes:  Focus on a time when you experienced success and write 
about the event and the positive feelings and thoughts you  had during the event  
 
These exercises have all been described by [CONTACT_627076]. [21].  Exercises may require anywhere 
from [ADDRESS_835683] protocol (via review of didactic materials, role play, and director work with supervisors) 
and ongoing supervision from our director of behavioral interventions.  She will also receive 
didactic teaching from MS exper ts on the basics of MS care and will have shadowed in the MS 
clinic to better understand MS patients’ experiences.  During the study, [CONTACT_102974] or another 
physician study staff member will be available by [CONTACT_627077], if needed, due to 
subject discomfort or to answer specific questions about the study.   
Two study manuals tailored to individuals with MS will be prepared: a study trainer manual and a 
study participant manual. At enrollment, subjects in the intervention group will be given the study 
participant manual and asked to schedule their first weekly phone call with the study trainer. The 
calls will  last 45-60 minutes, and will be used by [CONTACT_627078] (a) review the weekly exercise 
and discuss the ease and utility ratin gs recorded by [CONTACT_627079] ; (b) 
discuss the rationale for the next exercise using a guided review of the study participant manual; 
and (c)  describe the following week’s exercise and brainstorm ways to complete it. Subjects in the 
control group  will be mailed a copy of the study participant manual at the beginning of the 
extension phase of the study. This is to prevent subjects in the control group from completing the 
exercises during the intervention phase. They wil l be contact[CONTACT_627080].  All subjects will complete PRO measures at enrollment, completion of 
the intervention phase and completion of the extension phase.  
 
VI.  BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
To assess the toler ability of the intervention (Specific Aim  1), our goal is to demonstrate that the 
proportion who will complete four out of five exercises is greater  than 0.5. Given our sample size 
of [ADDRESS_835684] 80% power to detect a difference if the true  proportion of subjects 
who will complete four out of five exercises is 0.[ADDRESS_835685] of 
proportions (Stata routine: power oneproportion ). For the comparison of the treatment groups in  
terms of PRO measures (Specific Aim 2), the inter vention effect will be estimated using analysis 
of covariance (ANCOVA) model. In the ANCOVA model, the post -intervention scores will be 
compared  between the groups controlling for baseline scores. All outcome measures (PANAS, 
LOT -R, CES -D, STAI, MFIS, SF -36, WPAI , PSS, BRS, and SOM ) will be  compared using the 
same model. To assess whether PPI [INVESTIGATOR_627065] 10 weeks (Specific Aim 3), we 
will first calculate the change from baseline to week [ADDRESS_835686] 50% of the 
benefit was maintained at the [ADDRESS_835687] satisfaction and study progress.

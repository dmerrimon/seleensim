Version 5.0, 18 October 2021  11 Descriptive summary statistics will be provided for all safety variables, including 12 -lead ECGs, 
vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments, and adverse events reported during the study.  
The number and percentage of patients experiencing treatment -emergent adverse events will be 
summarized. Summaries will be produced for each body system , as well as for each preferred term 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. The number and percentage of patients 
experiencing serious adverse events will also be summarized.  
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:  
A total sample size of approximately 108 patients is planned for the study, with a 
1:1 randomization ratio for 6 mg/kg NPC -21 versus placebo and another 12 patients for high- level 
dose of 12 mg/kg NPC -21 (4:1:4 randomization ratio for 6 mg/kg NPC-21, 12 mg/kg NPC- 21, or 
placebo) . The sample size calculation is based on the mITT Population from the first dose of 
NPC -21 through Week 16 for the occurrence of CMV disease (CMV syndrome or tissue -invasive 
CMV disease) or CMV viremia (defined as the detection of ≥ 250 IU /mL in plasma  measured by 
[CONTACT_344166] a ntigenemia testing) primary endpoint. Assuming an early discontinuation rate of 15 %, 
approximately 4 8 patients each in the 6 mg/kg NPC -21 and placebo arm s are needed with a 2 -sided 
significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80% to detect a difference between NPC -21 at a predicted 
incidence rate of CMV disease (CMV syndrome or tissue -invasive CMV disease) or CMV viremia 
of 30% versus 60% for placebo.  In addition, a sample size of 12 patients for  the 12 mg/kg NPC -21 
arm is considered adequate for the planned exposure-response analysis.

Version 5.0, 18 October 2021  19 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
Human cytomegalovirus ( hCMV) is a member of the Herpesviridae  family double -stranded 
deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA) viruses that become latent in host cells after acute infection. 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is ubiquitous and high seroprevalence has been reported in 
worldwide populations. In the [LOCATION_002], CMV seroprevalence ranges from 40% to 80%.1,2,[ADDRESS_426947], primary infection, reinfection, or reactivation of latent 
virus can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Persons undergoing a solid organ transplant (SOT) are particularly susceptible to both primary infection and reactivation of CMV as a result of the pharmacologic immunosuppression used to prevent graft rejection. 
Cytomegalovirus entry into host cells requires the stepwise coordination of multiple virus -encoded 
envelope proteins. Following viral attachment, which is mediated by [CONTACT_344167] M/glycoprotein N complex and host heparin sulfate proteoglycans,
4,5 the virus 
envelope fuses with cellular membranes through the combination of glycoprotein B ( gB) and 
glycoprotein H/glycoprotein L complexes. Glycoprotein B is essential for the attachment, entry, 
fusion, and cell -to-cell spread of CMV.5 In addition, gB is the dominant antigen on the CMV 
envelope, and close to 100% of CMV  infected individuals develop antibodies against this 
glycoprotein.[ADDRESS_426948] gB.6,7 
Three antigenic sites, antigenic domain ( AD)- 1, AD -2, and AD -3, have been identified in gB and 
consist of amino acids (aa) [ADDRESS_426949] time during puberty or later, hCMV infection manifests as 
infectious mononucleosis -like symptoms, such as fever, swollen lymph nodes , and abnormal 
hepatic function. However, individuals with reduced immunity, such as those with acquired immunodeficiency, malignant tumors, SOT, and hem atopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), 
develop significant symptoms, such as pneumonia, retinitis, gastroenteritis , and encephalitis, 
resulting in a poor prognosis. 
The morbidity and mortality associated with CMV infection are secondary to both the direct and 
the indirect effects of CMV. Cytomegalovirus infection can result in CMV disease, both CMV 
syndrome and CMV tissue -invasive disease. The highest risk of CMV disease occurs in CMV  
seronegative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_344132] a CMV seropositive donor. Nearly 40,[ADDRESS_426950] -transplant lymphoproliferative disorder and

Version 5.0, [ADDRESS_426951] risk persons for CMV infection and 
disease are those that are seronegative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_344133] a seropositive organ donor. However, 
seropositive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_344134].  
In SOT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], hC MV is a causative virus for morbidity and mortality within 6 months of the 
transplant.20,21 In addition, hC MV has been reported to be involved in the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_344135]22,23 and opportunistic infections.24 In addition, it has been reported that 
in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_344136], the overall incidence of symptomatic CMV infections reached 40% to 60%, with the incidence and severity being highest among hC MV seronegative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_344137].
[ADDRESS_426952] risk for the development of CMV infection regardless of the donor’s CMV serostatus. Without intervention, approximately 80% of CMV seropositive HSCT patients will experience CMV infection (viremia) and approximately 30% of patients with CMV viremia will develop CMV disease.
26 
Human cytomegalovirus infection causes organ damage (direct effect) after the stage of hC MV 
viremia, and affects chronic inflammation and the immune system, leading to acute rejection and the development of new infections (indirect effect). Prevention of hC MV infection is thus critically 
important for successful organ transplantation. The mainstay in clinical practice is prophylaxis or preemptive treatment with antiviral drugs given transplantation in SOT and HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The first-line antiviral drug used in the treatment is ganciclovir ( GCV) or valganciclovir (VGCV). 
However, the use of GCV, VGCV , and other antiviral drugs raise s concerns about serious adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs), such as bone marrow depression and renal disorder as well as the development of GCV -resistant strains.
[ADDRESS_426953] patients, but its potential risks of drug interaction with immunosuppressive agents and antiviral resistance may limit treatment options.
30 Therefore, the development of a novel drug that provides an effective and safe 
alternative or addition to current CMV therapi[INVESTIGATOR_344138]. 
NPC -21 is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 ( IgG1 ) lambda  against the AD -1 on hC MV 
gB. Antigenic domain 1, the dominant antigen of the hC MV envelope, is reported to exhibit little 
sequence variation in clinical isolates of hC MV.13 A cell clone that produces NPC -21 was selected 
from B -lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood of a healthy individual with a history of CMV 
infection. NPC -21 is produced by [CONTACT_344168]. 
NPC -21 has been demonstrated in vitro  to inhibit infection of a cultivated CMV strain in the 
pharmacology study using ARPE- 19 cell (epi[INVESTIGATOR_344139]).  
NPC -21 is a non- immunomodulatory human monoclonal antibody with a relatively safe 
toxicological profile, causing no deaths and producing only mild reversible changes in 
hematological parameters (ie, decreased erythrocyte count, hematocrit value, and hemogl obin 
concentration) following repeated dosing in monkeys. Additionally, no cross reactivity was seen in a study of cross reactivity in human and monkey tissue. Although these changes occurred at a dose with sufficient safety margins and after repeated doses, the hematology parameters will be carefully monitored in clinical studies.

Version 5.0, [ADDRESS_426954]-in-human study was conducted in 40 healthy Japanese and Caucasian male volunteers in 
which NPC -21 or placebo was infused over a duration of 60 minutes. This single ascending dose 
study confirmed tolerability of NPC -21 up to 20 mg/kg, with no serious adverse events (SAEs) , 
ADRs , or withdrawals due to adverse events . Anti –NPC -21 antibodies were detected in some 
subjects, although all were found to be preexisting conditions. 
Taken together, nonclinical data and clinical data available to date support further clinical 
investigation of NPC-21 in the prevention of CMV disease.  
In March 2020, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19), caused by [CONTACT_344169][INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2, was characterized as a pandemic by [CONTACT_67848] (WHO). The COVID -19 pandemic impacted clinical studies worldwide due to 
quarantines, site closures, travel limitations, diversion of resources, and/or general interruptions in study- related procedures.  
This study protocol includes contingency measures to manage disruptions due to COVID -19; see 
Section  5.6.2 for information regarding acceptable COVID -19 vaccines and medications  and 
Sections 6, 7.3, 7.4, 8.1, 8.2, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9, 9.10, and 9.12 and Appendix A  for details on procedures 
that may be performed by [CONTACT_344159]  ([LOCATION_002] only)  due to COVID -19 
restrictions or other concerns , such as the need to avoid risks of COVID -19 infection. The impacts 
of these implemented contingency measures on the outcomes of this study, including any protocol deviations that result from COVID -19 illness and/or COVID -19 control measures will be 
discussed in the Clinical Study Report. 
1.1 Rationale 
NPC -21 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the AD -1 on hC MV surface  gB. Based 
on binding affinity to the AD -1 and potency of neutralization, a cell clone that expresses  NPC -21 
was selected from B -lymphocytes isolated from the peripheral blood of a healthy individual with 
a history of hC MV infection. NPC -21 is composed of two  heavy chains (454 a mino acid  residues) 
and two light chains (216 a mino acid  residues) connected by [CONTACT_161047] -chain disulfide bonds. Chinese 
hamster ovary cells are used for the production of NPC -21, and the antibody secreted into the 
growth medium is subse quently purified through a series of filtration and chromatographic steps. 
The isotype and subclass of NPC-21 were identified as IgG1 lambda . NPC -21 is being developed 
for the prevention of CMV- associated disease.  
Human cytomegalovirus gB is a surface glycoprotein that  spans the viral  lipid bilayer envelope 
and is the principle envelope antigen essential for viral attachment, entry, fusion, and cell -to-cell 
transmission .
5 Close to 100% of individuals who are infected with hC MV develop antibodies 
against gB.[ADDRESS_426955] AD -1,14 and the antibodies that bind to AD-1 are often neutralizing .15,16 
NPC -21 acts by [CONTACT_42326] t o AD-1 on the hC MV gB and blocking the essential processes of 
attachment, entry, fusion, and cell -to-cell spread of hC MV. NPC -21 neutralizes not only the 
reference laboratory strains AD169,31 Towne,32 and Davis,33 but also the clinical  isolate Merlin,34

Version 5.0, 18 October 2021  22 when cultured in human fibroblasts. The  50% inhibitory concentration ( IC50) range was  0.015 to 
0.032 μg/mL , and the 90% inhibitory concentration ( IC90) range was  0.086 to 0.51 μg/mL. 
Additionally, NPC -21 exhibited 682 to 1977 times more potent neutralization activities  when the 
IC90 values for individual strains were compared to those for  anti-CMV hyperimmunoglobulin 
(CytoGam®). Epi[INVESTIGATOR_344140] a principal target for hC MV primary infection , and these cells are 
highly permissive for replication.35 Therefore, a strictly cell -associated mode of hC MV infection 
more accurately reflects the in vivo  situation.36 Given this  observation, the ability  of NPC -21 to 
inhibit cell-to-cell transmission of epi[INVESTIGATOR_1231]-tropic hC MV clinical isolates was examined in  
human retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_86154] , ie, ARPE -19 cells. NPC -21 inhibited the cell -to-cell 
transmission of hC MV clinical isolates with an IC 50 range of 1.0 to 3.1 μg/mL and an IC 90 range 
of 13 to 19 μg/mL. In addition, an in vitro  combination study indicated that the inhibitory effect 
of NPC -21 on hC MV plaque formation was additive or synergistic with the currently approved 
viral DNA polymerase inhibitors GCV, cidofovir, foscarnet , and acyclovir, suggesting that 
NPC -21 does not interfere with DNA polymerase inhibitor antiviral activity and can be potentially 
used as part of a combination therapy.  
Toxicity of NPC -21 was evaluated in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice regulations. 
Once weekly intravenous administration of NPC -21 in male and female cynomolgus monkeys at 
doses up to 100 mg/kg for 4 weeks (total of 4 doses) was well -tolerated. There were no deaths, 
and no adverse clinical signs attributable to NPC -21 treatment  were observed in any animal. 
Treatment with NPC -21 doses of up to 100 mg/kg did not noticeably affect electrocardiography, 
blood pressure, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_344141], suggesting an absence of effects on cardiovascular and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_263576]. In addition, NPC -21 doses of up to 100 mg/kg had no effects on the central 
nervous system.  At the 100 mg/kg dose, reversible hematologic changes were observed at the end of the 4- week 
dosing period ( a decreased erythrocyte count, hematocrit value, and hemoglobin concentration in 
3 of 12 animals, with an increased reticulocyte ratio in 2 of these animals). The increased or normal 
reticulocyte ratio and unchanged leukocyte counts in these animals suggested there were minimal toxicological effects on hematopoiesis. The possibility that NPC -[ADDRESS_426956] level  was considered to be 
50 mg/kg in both male and female monkeys. 
A first -in-human Phase 1 study of NPC -21 was conducted in 40 healthy Japanese and Caucasian 
male adults , in which a single administration of NPC -21 or placebo was infused over a duration of 
60 minutes. This single  ascending  dose study confirmed tolerability of NPC -21 up to 20 mg/kg. 
All adverse events were mild in severity. There were no SAEs, deaths, significant adverse events, 
or adverse events that led  to treatment discontinuation. Anti –NPC -21 antibodies were detected in 
6 out of 40 individuals, but in all cases, the antibodies were present prior to administration of NPC -21.  
In the Phase 1 study, the maximum serum concentration, area under the concentration -time curve 
(AUC) from time [ADDRESS_426957] measurable concentration , and the AUC from time 0 to infinity 
increased dose- dependently as was demonstrated by a linear regression analysis and a power model 
analysis. For other pharmacokinetic parameters ( time to maximum serum concentration, half -life 
[t
1/2], clearance, volume of distribution, mean residence time, and elimination rate constant), no 
significant difference between dos e levels was observed. The t 1/2 was estimated to be 612.30 to 
790.41 hours, and the elimination pattern was considered biphasic.

following kidney transplantation and will enter a 16- week Treatment Period , in which they will be

12 for 16 weeks  (total of 4 infusions). Safety will be closely monitored throughout the duration of 
the study. At any time during the study, patients who develop detectable CMV viremia or CMV 
disease can enter the Rescue Phase of the study and be treated by [CONTACT_344170].  
1.2 Risk/Benefit  
Cytomegalovirus disease causes significant morbidity and mortality in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. 
Prevention or treatment with directed antivirals or immunoglobulins is associated with toxicity 
and high cost, and does not eliminate all of the associated morbidities. The expected advantage of NPC -21, a human monoclonal antibody against the AD -1 on CMV gB, is superior safety profiles. 
NPC -21 binds to AD-1 specific on CMV gB to inhibit the cell- to-cell transmission of hC MV. 
Phase 1 study data indicate NPC -21 has been generally safe and well  tolerated, although the 
number of subjects studied to date is relatively small. A total of 40 subjects (32 Japanese, 8 Caucasian) were enrolled in the Phase 1 study. The study incorporated a total of 5 steps, consisting of 4 dose groups of 1, 3, 10, and 20 mg/kg for Japanese subjects, and 1 dose group of 
10 mg/kg for Caucasian subjects. Overall, NPC -[ADDRESS_426959] drug and the incidence of adverse events. When Japanese and Caucasian subjects were compared at the same dose level (10 mg/kg), the nature and pattern of adverse events were comparable, showing no obvious difference between the 2 races. Laboratory related adve rse events were also 
reported but all were mild in severity and judged not related to the study drug. Anti –NPC -[ADDRESS_426960] been reported with 
the use of other antibody drugs. Therefore, the possibility of such reactions to NPC -21, an antibody 
drug, cannot be ruled out.

Version 5.0, 18 October 2021  32 5 STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Treatment Groups  
Eligible patients will be randomized in a 4:1:[ADDRESS_426975] study drug administration to 1 of 
the following treatment groups:  
• NPC -21 (at a dose of 6 mg/kg of actual body weight [ at Screening ]) administered via an 
approximately 60- minute (5  mL/minute) intravenous infusion   
• NPC -21 (at a dose of 12 mg/kg of actual  body weight [at Screening]) administered via an 
approximately 60- minute (5  mL/minute) intravenous infusion 
• Placebo (normal saline) administered via an approximately  60-minute (5  mL/minute) 
intravenous infusion 
5.2 Rationale for Dosing 
NPC -21 at a dose of 6 or 12 mg/kg of actual  body weight ( at Screening ) will be administered via 
an approximately 60- minute (5 mL/minute) intravenous infusion. These doses w ere determined 
based on the pharmacokinetic ( PK) and safety and tolerability data up to 20 mg/kg from the 
Phase [ADDRESS_426976] of NPC -21 on the cell -to-cell transmission of 8  hCMV clinical isolates, 
NPC -21 inhibited cell -to-cell transmission of all clinical hC MV isolates tested with IC90 range of 
13 to 19 µ g/mL. The Sponsor concludes that NPC -21 is effective in the prevention of CMV 
infection when the trough concentration of NPC -21 is over 19 µ g/mL. Based on simulations  using 
the PK data from the Phase 1 study, it is assumed that 6 mg/kg once every 4 weeks will keep 
19 µg/mL at the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval at the trough of Day 29. A small cohort 
of 12 mg/kg NPC-21 has been added  for exposure- response analysis.  
5.3 Randomization and Blinding  
At Screening, a unique patient identification number will be established for each patient who has provi ded written informed consent. This patient identification number will be used for patient 
identification throughout the study and in all study- related documentation. This will be a 5 digit 
hyphenated number of the following format: XYY- ZZ, where X is the country number (1 [US] or 
2 [Japan]), YY is the sequential unique site identification number, and ZZ is a sequential unique number assigned to the patient  at that site. Each patient number will be assigned only once and 
will not be reassigned to another patient if a patient fails during Screening. Interactive Response Technology ( IRT) will not allow repeat of numbers. This unique identifier will be  used in all study 
documentation for that patient from first to last contact.   
After informed consent  and body weight  are obtained, pre -Randomization will take place via the 
IRT system to 1 of 3 treatment groups ( 6 mg/kg NPC -21, 12 mg/kg NPC -21, or placebo) in a 
4:1:4 ratio . Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_11338] ([LOCATION_002] or Japan). Randomization 
will take place prior to  first study drug administration after confirming all criteria . Randomization 
procedures may occur on Day -[ADDRESS_426977] study drug administration.  The Sponsor designee (eg, IRT vendor) will have a designated randomization administrator who 
will maintain the randomization codes in accordance with standard operating procedures to ensure the blind integrity is properly maintained. Care should be exercised to ensure that only study staff

Manual.  
5.5.3 Study Drug Administration 
Patients randomized to NPC -21 will be administered  a dose of 6 or 12 mg/kg of actual  body weight  
(at Screening) via an approximately 60- minute (5  mL/minute) intravenous infusion on Day 1 and 
at Weeks 4, 8, and 12.  
Patients randomized to placebo will be administered approximately 300 mL of normal saline via 
an approximately 60- minute (5 mL/minute) intravenous infusion on Day [ADDRESS_426978] in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], in principle, during study drug 
administration and should remain resting , in principle, from the end of study drug administration 
until the tests scheduled within 1 hour after  study drug administration. 
If an adverse event, especially an infusion reaction, occurs during study drug administration and the Investigator deems it necessary, deceleration, suspension, or resumption of study drug administration is allowed. In case of a Grade 2 infusion reaction, study drug administration will be suspended and study drug administration will be resumed (flow rate will be 2.5  mL/minute) after 
recovery from the symptoms by [CONTACT_168647]. In the case of a Grade  3 or higher infusion reaction, 
study drug administration will  be terminated . Details will be entered in the eCRF. Refer to the 
Pharmacy Manual for more information.    
The day of administration as well as the administration start and end time will be entered in the 
eCRF.  
5.5.4 Treatment Compliance  
Study drug will be administered intravenously by [CONTACT_6624]. Dosing compliance will be recorded 
by [CONTACT_344172]. The date and time of study drug administration will be 
recorded.  
5.5.5 Storage and Accountability  
Records will be maintained indicating the receipt and dispensation of all study drug supplies. At 
the conclusion of the study, the clinical research associate (CRA) will conduct an unblinded review of study drug inventory, and the results will be recorded in the Drug Accountability Log. Any unused drug will be returned to the depot . If no study drug remains, this will be indicated in the 
Drug Accountability Log.  
Study drug will be stored at  in a secured area with access limited to authorized 
personnel. The unblinded site pharmacist will perform an ongoing inventory of study drug 
products on behalf of the Sponsor and must keep an accurate inventory of study drug shipments 
received and amount of study drug used per patient.

An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal product. All adverse events, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded on the appr opriate eCRF . 
Adverse events, which include clinical laboratory test variables, will be monitored and documented from the time informed consent  is obtained until Week [ADDRESS_426995] the event on the appropriate adverse event eCRF.  
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_76768]. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by [CONTACT_737] , it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF. 
Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( eg, surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an adverse event, not the procedure itself .  
Any medical condition already present at the time of signing informed consent should be recorded 
as medical history and not be reported as an adverse event unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at B aseline changes in severity , frequency, or seriousness at any time during 
the study. In this case, it should be reported as an adverse event. 
Laboratory Abnormalities 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination ( eg, ECG , CMV testing ) findings 
that are detected during the study or are present at the time informed consent  is obtained and 
significantly worsen during the study should be reported as adverse event s, as described below . 
The Investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an 
abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Abnormal test results that are determined to be an error should not be reported as an adverse event. Laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal clinical findings (eg, ECG  abnormalities) should be reported as 
an adverse event if any of the following are applicable: 
• If an intervention is required as a result of the abnormality 
• If action taken with study drug is required as a result of the abnormality 
• Based on the clinical judgment of the Investigator

All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered an ADR . “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal relationship between 
a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, ie , the relationship 
cannot be ruled out. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_426996] information. For NPC -21 the reference safety 
information is included in the Investigator’s Brochure currently in force. The reference safety 
information will be reviewed yearly and the periodicity of the review will be harmonized with the reporting period of the Development Safety Update Report.  Any adverse event that is both 
unexpected (not consistent with the  applicable product information) and also meets the definition 
of an SAE/ serious adverse reaction  (SAR) would be considered a Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R).  
9.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_248128] (intensity) of each adverse event as mild, moderate, severe, 
life-threatening, or death and will also categorize each adverse event as to its potential relationship 
to study drug using the categories of related or not related . 
Assessment of S everi
 ty 
The severity of all adverse events should be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0. For those adverse event terms  not listed in the 
CTCAE, the following grading system should be used: 
• CTCAE Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild  symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated 
• CTCAE Grade 2: Moderate; minimal local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
• CTCAE Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -care 
activities of daily living  
• CTCAE Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
• CTCAE Grade 5:  Death related to the adverse event  
Causality A ssessme
 nt 
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of study drug is to be assessed according to the following definitions: 
Not related  (unrelated, not related, unlikely to be related ) – The time course between the 
administration of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a 
Nobelpharma Co., Ltd.  
Clinical Study Protocol NPC -21-2 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 5.0, 18 October 2021  53 causal relationship and another cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc) is 
suspected.  
Related (possibly, probably, or definitely related ) – The time course between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship and no other cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc) can be identified.  
The definition implies a reasonable possi
 bility of a causal relationship between the event and study 
drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. 
The following factors should also be considered: 
• The
 temporal sequence from study drug administration- 
The event should occur after study drug is given. The length of time from study drug exposure 
to the event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event. 
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases- 
Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease 
being treated and any other disease the patient  may have. 
• Concomitant medication - 
The other drugs the patient is taking or the treatment the patient  receives should be examined 
to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question. 
• The k nown response pattern for this class of study drug- 
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a class effect.  
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses- 
The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_23567] a logical and 
better explanation for the event. 
• The pharmacology of study drug- 
The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of 
study drug should be considered.

An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator 
or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death . 
• A life -threatening adverse event. 
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.

• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• An important medical event.  
Note : Important medical events that do not meet any of the above criteria may be considered

death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
9.5 Expedited Reporting  
The Sponsor/designee will report all relevant information about S[LOCATION_003]R s that are fatal or 
life-threatening as soon as possible to the relevant authorities in all the countries concerned,  and 
in any case no later than 7 days after knowledge by [CONTACT_1034]/designee of such a case.  
All other S[LOCATION_003]Rs  (except fatal/life -threatening) will be reported to the relevant authorities as soon 
as possible but within a maximum of [ADDRESS_427000] knowledge by [CONTACT_1034]/designee.  
When an event is considered to be a S[LOCATION_003]R, the blind will be broken by  
[CONTACT_344181]. The blind will be maintained for persons responsible for the ongoing 
conduct of the study.  
The Sponsor/designee will also report any additional expedited safety reports required in 
accordance with the timelines outlined in country- specific legislation.  
The Sponsor/designee will also inform  all investigators as required per local regulation. 
The requirements above refer to the requirements relating to  the investigational medicinal product.  
Expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs related to non- investigational medical products ( NIMPs ) is not 
required . All SARs, regardless of expectedness, will be reported to the manufacturer of the 
marketed product. Line listings of cases related to NIMPs will be included in the Development 
Safety Update Report.

• Overdose:  Refers to the administration of a quantity of a medicinal product given per 
administration or cumulatively (accidentally or intentionally), which is above the maximum 
recommended dose according to the protocol. Clinical judgment should always be applied. In 
cases of a discrepancy in the drug accountability, an overdose will be established only when it is clear that the patient  has taken additional dose(s) or the Investigator has reason to suspect 
that the patient  has taken additional dose(s).  
• Misuse:  Refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately 
used in a way that is not in accordance with the protocol instructions or local prescribing information and may be accompanied by [CONTACT_239640]/or psychological e ffects.  
• Abuse:  Is defined as persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicinal product, 
which is accompanied by [CONTACT_3584]. 
• Medication error:  Is any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or administration 
of a medicinal product by a healthcare professional, patient, or consumer, respectively. The administration or consumption of the unassigned treatment and administration of an expi[INVESTIGATOR_239610], cases of patient s missing doses of the 
investigational product are not considered reportable as medication error.

placebo) . The sample size calculation is based on the mITT Population from the first dose of 
NPC -21 through Week 16 for the occurrence of CMV disease (CMV syndrome or tissue -invasive 
CMV disease) or CMV viremia (defined as the detection of ≥ 250 IU /mL in plasma measured by 
[CONTACT_344183]) primary endpoint. Assuming an early discontinuation rate of 15%, 
approximately 48 patients each in the 6  mg/kg NPC -21 and placebo arms are needed with a 2 -sided 
significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80% to detect a difference between NPC -21 at a predicted 
incidence rate of CMV disease (CMV syndrome or tissue -invasive CMV disease) or CMV viremia 
of 30% versus 60% for placebo. In addition, a sample size of 12 patients for the 12 mg/kg NPC -21 
arm is considered adequate for the planned exposure-response analysis.

[CONTACT_2237],  collect blood samples  that will be stored for screening for resistant strains analysis, perform EQ -5D-5L, and record adverse events.  
Note: During the 12-week Observation Period, visits at Weeks 17, 19, 21, and 23 may be missed due to unavoidable circumstances (eg, holidays, nat ural disasters). However, 
every attempt should be made to ensure a visit occurs. In this case, study staff will  make contact [CONTACT_344186], eg, review concomitant 
medications, any new adverse event s since the last visit.   
e. During the Observation Period, home healthcare services ([LOCATION_002] only) may be utilized at Weeks 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, and 28 . Home healthcare services 
may perform the following procedures at non-d osing day visits: record concomitant medications, obtain body weight, perform physical examination, record vital signs, colle ct 
samples for analysis by [CONTACT_2237], perform 12-l ead ECG, perform EQ -5D-5L, and record adverse events.  
f. For patients who are withdrawn from the study prior to completion, all Week [ADDRESS_427023] via the IRT system to 1 of 3 treatment groups (6 mg/kg NPC -21, 12 mg/kg NPC -21, 
or placebo) in a 4:1:4 ratio. Randomization  will be stratified by [CONTACT_11338] ([LOCATION_002] or Japan).

Version 5.0, 18 October 2021  76 APPENDIX  C: THE DEFINITION OF CYTOMEGALOVIRUS 
SYNDROME  
Cytomegalovirus Syndrome  
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) syndrome is a disease deﬁnition that should only be used in solid organ 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Because it is impossible to exclude all other causes of the clinical symptomatology described as CMV syndrome, a “proven” category cannot be deﬁned. The deﬁnition of probable CMV syndrome requires detection of CMV in blood by [CONTACT_126567], rapid culture, antigenemia, or nucleic acid testing  together with at least 2 of the following: 
1. Fever ≥ 38°C for at least 2 days. 
2. New or increased malaise (toxicity G rade 2) or new or increased fatigue (toxicity G rade 3) 
(National Cancer Institute: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0). 
3. Leukopenia or neutropenia on [ADDRESS_427027] 24 hours apart, deﬁned as a white blood cell (WBC) count of <3500 cells/µL, if the WBC count prior to the development 
of clinical symptoms was ≥ 4000 cells/µL, or a WBC decrease of >20%, if the WBC count 
prior to the development of clinical symptoms was <4000 cells/µL. The corresponding 
neutrophil counts are <1500 cells/µL or a decrease of >20% if the neutrophil count before the onset of symptoms was <1500 cells/µL. 
4. Greater than or equal to 5% atypi[INVESTIGATOR_27346]. 
5. Thrombocytopenia deﬁned as a platelet count of <100,000 cells/µL if the platelet count prior 
to the development of clinical symptoms was ≥ 115,000 cells/µL or a decrease of >20% if the 
platelet count prior to the development of clinical symptoms was <115,000 cells/µL.  
6. Elevation of hepatic aminotransferases (alanine aminotransferase or aspartate 
aminotransferase) to 2 times the upper limit of normal (applicable to non -liver transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]).

Confidential  Page 11 of 48 1 INTRODUCTION  
Bexagliflozin, a pote nt and selective renal Na+/glucose transport protein  sodium glucose 
cotransporter 2  (SGLT2 ) inhibitor is being developed as a treatment for type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. The transport of glucose from the renal tubule into the tubular epi[INVESTIGATOR_698050]2 which is expressed primarily in the kidney in the early proximal tubule 
of the nephron  (Washburn 2009 ). By [CONTACT_195595]2, bexagliflozin blocks th e 
reabsorption of filtered glucose, in turn promoting urinary glucose excretion and thereby 
[CONTACT_698057] (Zhang, Welihinda et al. 2011 ). 
Clinical pharmacok inetic  (PK)  studies have shown that the peak plasma bexagliflozin 
concentration s occurred between 3 to 5 h  and thereafter declined in a biphasic manner  with 
mean elimination half -life values ranging from 7.80 to 9.71 h . Bexagliflozin is cleared 
predominant ly by [CONTACT_698058], bexagliflozin 3 -O-glucuronide by  
[CONTACT_698059] 1A9 (UGT1A9) pathway . Extended  
release bexagliflozin tablet formulations are developed to provide greater than 75% release in 
approximately 8 h in vitro . The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of a high -fat 
meal  on the  PK of  extended release bexagliflozin  tablets,  20 mg . 
1.1 Bexagliflozin  for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  
Bexagliflozin  is a highly speci fic inhibitor of SGLT2 with an in vitro  IC50 of 2 nM or 
0.9 ng/mL and a 2435 -fold selectivity for human SGLT2 compared with sodium glucose 
cotransporter 1  (SGLT1 ). Details of the nonclinical and clinical findings are described in the 
Investigator’s Brochur e. 
1.2 Summary of Nonclinical Data with Bexagliflozin  
Bexagliflozin exhibits high permeability and is a potential Pgp  (p-glycoprotein)  substrate and 
inhibitor. It is not a si gnificant inducer or inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isozymes and other 
transporters relevant for drug -drug interactions.  
1.[ADDRESS_947551] been conducted using immediate release (IR) products in 
capsules. Theracos has completed multiple phase 1 studies to evaluate safety , tolerability , 
pharmacokinetics (plasma exposure), pharmacodynamics (glucosuria) , and drug metabolism 
in healthy subjects, patients with type 2 diabetes, and diabetic patients with renal impairment .  
Following administration of bexagliflozin IR capsules, time of maximu m observed plasma 
concentration  (Tmax) was reached  within 1 to 3  h. The systemic exposure was dose 
proportional with a maximum observed plasma concentration  (Cmax) of 11  ng/mL  per mg 
bexagliflozin and an area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC 0-24) of 
approximately 60  ng·h/mL per mg bexagliflozin in healthy or diabetic subjects.  Following 
administration of bexagliflozin tablets in extended release formulations, T max was reached 
between 3 to 5 h. The tablets produced dose proportional exposure wi th a C max of 4 or 8

Confidential  Page 12 of 48 ng/mL per mg bexagliflozin and an AUC 0-24 of 40 or 50 ng·h/mL per mg bexagliflozin in 
healthy subjects  when dosing was before or after a meal, respectively.  
The principal metabolites in humans are  similar to those found in monkeys and a re 
dominated by [CONTACT_698060] , for which the AUC is >30% relative to 
parent bexagliflozin. Modest accumulation consistent with an extended half -life has been  
seen following multiple daily dosing. Following oral administration of radio labeled 
bexagliflozin, >90% of the ingested radioactivity was recovered, 51% as fecal excretion and 
41% as urinary excretion. In urine, bexagliflozin accounts for 1.5% of the dose; most of the 
radioactivity is excreted as bexagliflozin 3’ -O-glucuronide. Th e largest fraction of the 
radioactivity in feces is due to bexagliflozin, accounting for about 30% of the administered 
dose.  
The safety and tolerability of bexagliflozin in healthy or diabetic subjects was initially 
evaluated in a single -dose study of up t o 100 mg, followed by a 4 -week treatment study in 
which doses ranged from 5 mg/d to 50 mg/d. The most frequently occurring adverse events 
(AEs) were mild to moderate headache, pollakiuria, nausea, and fatigue. No symptomatic 
hypoglycemia was reported and n o treatment -related adverse event led to discontinuation of 
treatment. Extended release tablets of 3 mg to 90 mg strengths were well tolerated in a 
Japanese population with few adverse events reported.  
Detailed information of bexagliflozin  clinical experie nce and potential risks for study 
subjects are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.

3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This single center, phase 1, open -label, 2 × 2 crossover study is designed to assess the effects 
of a high -fat meal on the PK of orally a dministered bexagliflozin tablets . Eighteen  eligible 
healthy subjects will be randomized into two groups such that an equal number (n= 9) of 
subjects will  receive a single oral dose of a bexagliflozin  tablet s, [ADDRESS_947553] will receive a second  dose of bexagliflozin 
tablets  with a high -fat meal  on treatment day 8.  
Bexagliflozin will be taken orally with 240 mL of water in the morning (approximately  8 
a.m. to 10 a.m.). The t ime of dosing for a given subject will be the same (as far as  
practicalities permit) in both treatment periods.  
The high-fat meal will follow the FDA guidance (Food Drug Administration 2002 ) on high -
fat (50% of total caloric content of the meal) and high -calori c (800 to 1000 cal) content . An 
example of the high -fat meal would be two eggs fried in butter , two strips of bacon, two 
slices of toast with butter, four ounces of hash brown potatoes and eight ounces of whole 
milk. Substitutions in this meal can be made as long as the meal provides a similar amount of 
calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat and has comparable meal volume and viscosity.  
Subjects dosed in the fed state will receive  an oral bexagliflozin tablet s, [ADDRESS_947554] meals will be 
served at  the clinic during the stay. Blood samples ( 2 mL) for bexagliflozin  plasma 
concentrations will be collected at 0 h (pre -dose), and at , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 
and [ADDRESS_947555] -dose (days 1-3 in treatment period 1  and days 8-10 in treatment period 2 
respectively ). Urine collection in 12 h batches will be performed at pre -dose ( -12 to 0 h on 
day 0 and day 7 ), and at post -dose at 0 to 12 h, 12 to 24 h, 24 to 36 h, and 36 to 48 h.

has been evaluated in an early clinical trial (THR -1442 -C-445). The effects of dose 
administration in the fasted and fed states were assessed in healthy  Japanese subjects for 
absorption, dis tribution, metabolism and excretion of bexagliflozin . Twelve s ubjects were 
randomized evenly to two dose groups ( 10 and 30 mg ). Each group received first dose of 
bexagliflozin tablet s under fed state on day 1, then after [ADDRESS_947557] meal resulted in increased average C max (range 39% to 59% for bexagliflozin and 
19% to 28% for bexagliflozin 3 -O-glucuronide) and decreased half -life (range 2 3-40% for 
bexagliflozin and 10% to 21% for bexagliflozin 3 -O-glucuronide ). However, no meaningful 
change in the T max of either analyte was observed.  No effect of  food on the overall systemic 
exposure [area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) ] of bexagliflozin  and 
bexagliflozin [ADDRESS_947558].  
3.3 Study Duration and Dates  
This is a phase  1, two -period, two -treatment, crossover study. Subjects will be screened 
within  28 days of the initiation of study drug dosing. Eligible subjects who consent to the 
study will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups , each group will receive both treatments 
alternately, in a crossover fashion (two -period, two -treatment crossover design), with the two 
treatment periods separated by a 7-day washout period .  
In treatment period 1, subjects will be admitted to the clinic on day 0, the day before dosing,

The investigator or designated qualified individual will perform the physical examination s 
(PEs) . A complete physical examination will be performed at screening  and at the 
termination  visit. Partial physical examinations will be performed at scheduled visits . 
A complete physical examination will include measurement of body weight and height 
(height will  be measured only at screening), general assessment of all body systems including 
the skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, lungs, heart, abd omen, lymph nodes, and 
extremities. A partial physical examination will include body weight and an update of the 
general assessment of the skin, heart, lungs and abdomen.  
6.4 Vital Signs  
Vitals signs, including pulse, systolic and diastolic blood pressure  (BP)  in a seated  position  
will be obtained after a subject has been sitting for 5  min, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]  (RR) , and  oral

6.5.1  12-Lead Electrocardiograms  
A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be conducted as li sted in Appendix [ADDRESS_947581] abnormalities.  
It is the investigator  or designee ’s responsibility to review the results of the ECG as they 
become available. For each abnormal ECG result, the investigator needs to ascertain if this is 
a clinically significant change from the screening ECG for that individual subject (this 
determination, however, does not necessarily need to be made the first tim e an abnormal 
result is observed. The investigator may repeat the ECG to verify the results of the original 
result). If the ECG result is determined to be a clinically significant and abnormal change 
from baseline for that subject, this is considered an AE .

6.7 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
A non -compartmental analysis  (NCA)  will be used to calculate the PK parameters of 
bexagliflozin using the software Phoenix® WinNonlin® 6.4 (Certara, [LOCATION_003]) . From the plasma 
bexagliflozin concentration -time data, the following PK para meters will be estimated for 
each subject where feasible.  
Cmax Maximum observed plasma concentration  
Tmax Time of maximum observed plasma concentration  
z      Terminal elimination phase rate constant  
T½     Apparent terminal elimination half life  
CL/F  Ap parent oral clearance  
Vz/F  Apparent volume of distribution  
AUC 0-t      Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from Time 0 to Time t (time of 
last quantifiable plasma concentration)  
AUC 0-∞ Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from Time [ADDRESS_947590] temporal value will be taken.  
The apparent terminal elimination half-life, T1/2, where determinable, will be cal culated as 
the natural log of  [ADDRESS_947591] the adjusted r2 value reported in Phoenix®WinNonl in® must be above 
0.7.  
AUC 0-t and AUC 0-∞ will be calculated using the linear trapezoidal  linear interpolation  
method , using actual elapsed time values. If the actual collection time is unknown the 
nominal c ollection time may be used for the purposes of PK parameter estimation. For the 
purpose of calculating AUC, all missing values will be treated as missing in the PK analysis

Confidential  Page 26 of 48 and excluded from analysis except when they occur at pre -dose where they will be se t to 
zero. All values that were below the limit of quantitation (BLOQ) prior to Tmax will be set to 
zero. BLOQ values that occur after T max will be set to missing. W hen ≥ 2 consecutive plasma 
concentrations below the limit of quantitation (BL OQ) are  encountered after Tmax, these and 
all subsequent values will be excluded from the analysis.  
AUC 0-∞ will be calculated according to the following equation:  
AUC 0-∞= AUC last + (Clast / λz), where C last is the last temporal quantifiable plasma 
concentration  corresponding to T last. 
The proportion of AUC 0-∞ due to extrapolation (AUC extr) will be calculated  and expressed as 
a percentage. AUC 0-∞ values will be considered unreliable es timates if the AUC extr is greater 
than 20%.  
CL/F will be calculated as Dose/AUC 0-∞. 
Vz/F will be calculated as Dose/(λ z × AUC 0-∞). 
T½ will be calculated as 0.693/λ z. 
Descriptive statistics for the plasma concentrations of bexagliflozin  by [CONTACT_698063]. A listi ng of plasma concentrations by [CONTACT_397528], Treatment 
Period and T imepoint will also be provided.  
6.8 Pharmacodynamic Assessment  
Urinary glucose excretion will be determined as the pharmacodynamic  (PD) parameter at 
baseline (day 0  and day 7), and up to 48 h postdose (days 1 -3 and 8 -10). The effect of high -
fat meal will be evaluated by [CONTACT_698064] c umulative urinary glucose excretion  
(UGE ) between subjects under fasted and fed conditions. Potential effects on urinary 
creatini ne, uric acid, sodium, potassium, and calcium will also be analyzed.  
6.9 Adverse Events Assessments  
Adverse event (AE ): Any untoward medical occurrence in clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product. An AE does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  
 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or n ot considered related to the medicinal product.  
Serious adverse event (SAE): A serious adverse event (experience) or reaction is any 
untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:

Confidential  Page 27 of 48 • results in death,  
• is life -threatening,  
• (NOTE: The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in 
which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198297],  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect , 
• is an important medical event.  
 
An important medical event is an event that may not be immediately life -threatening  or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192109]. Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for aller gic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
Non-serious adverse events are all events that do not meet the criteria for a "serious" adverse 
event.  
Immediately Rep ortable Adverse Event (IRAE):  Any serious adverse event or any 
adverse event that necessitates discontinuation of study drug.  
Clinical Laboratory Changes:  It is the investigator’s responsibility to review the results of 
all laboratory tests as they become available. For each abnormal laboratory test result, the 
investigator needs to ascertain if this is a clinically significant change from baseline for that 
individual subject. (This determination, however, does not necessarily need to be made the 
first time  an abnormal value is observed. The investigator may repeat the laboratory test or 
request additional tests to verify the results of the original laboratory tests). If this laboratory 
value is determined to be an abnormal change from baseline for that subj ect, this is 
considered an AE.  
Hypoglycemia will be defined as any FPG  (fasting plasma glucose)  value < 70 mg/dL and 
documented as described in Section 6. 9.4.4. 
Any increase in liver function tests (AST, aspartate aminotran sferase (ALT ), or bilirubin) 
greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) for the laboratory utilized will be 
considered a clinical -laboratory adverse event.  
An increase in creatinine from baseline by 0.5 mg/dL or more will be reported as a laborat ory 
adverse event.  
Severity:   Adverse events will be graded on a 3 -point scale and reported as indicated on the 
CRF.  The intensity of an adverse experience is defined as follows:  
1 = Mild: discomfort not  iced, but no disruption to daily activity;  
2 = Mode rate: discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity;

Confidential  Page 28 of 48 3 = Severe: inability to work or perform normal daily activity.  
 
Study Drug Causality:  The site and database should ask for the causality relative to the 
study compound.  Relationship of  an adverse event to dosing will be assessed as follows:  
Definite: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the AE when 
the event responds to withdrawal of the study drug (dechallenge), and recurs with rechallenge 
by [CONTACT_698065].  
Probable: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the AE. The 
event responds to dechallenge. Rechallenge is not required.  
Possible: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the  AE. 
Dechallenge is lacking or unclear.  
Not Likely: There is a temporal relationship to study drug administration, but there is not a 
reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the event.  
Unrelated: There is not a temporal or causal relation ship to study -drug administration.  
6.9.1  Collecting  and Reporting Adverse Events  
The investigator will periodically assess subjects for the occurrence of adverse events. To 
avoid bias in collecting  information about  adverse events , the investigator should ask 
subjects  the following question: "How have you felt si nce you were last checked ?" All 
adverse events (serious and non -serious) reported by [CONTACT_698066].  
In addition, Theracos’ Medical M onitor or its designated personnel must be notified 
immediately by [CONTACT_698067]. Special attention should be paid to recording hospi[INVESTIGATOR_698054].

6.9.3  Pregnancy  
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who are sexually act ive must use an effective 
method of birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is 
minimized.  
Before enrolling WOCBP in this clinical trial, investigators must review guidelines about 
study participation for WOCBP. T he topi[INVESTIGATOR_78609]:  
1. General information . 
2. Informed consent form . 
3. Pregnancy prevention information . 
4. Drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives.  
5. Contraceptives in current use.  
6. Guidelines for the follow -up of a reported pregnancy.  
 
Prior to  study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy 
during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. The 
subject must sign an informed consent form stating the above -mentioned risk facto rs and that 
the consequences were discussed with her.  
During the study, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_397924] (e.g. , missed or late menstrual cycle).  
If a subject or investigator suspe cts that the subject may be pregnant prior to investigational 
product administration, the investigational product administration must be withheld until the 
results of serum pregnancy tests are available. If the pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must 
not receive the investigational product and must not remain in or be enrolled in the study.  
The investigator must notify the Medical Monitor within [ADDRESS_947595] it to 
the sponsor’s clinical or designated personnel.

SAEs  that are identified on the last scheduled contact [CONTACT_698069] 6. 9.1. 
These may include unresolved previously reported SAEs , or new SAEs . The investigator 
should follow these subjects  until the  events are resolved, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
Resolution means the subject has returned to  the baseline state of health, or the investigator 
does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the subject’s condition. The 
investigator should continue to report any significant follow -up information to Theracos  until 
the event has been resolv ed. 
Any new SAEs  reported by [CONTACT_397926], and are determined by [CONTACT_698070], should be reported to the Medical Monitor or the sp onsor’s d esignated 
personnel . These may include SAEs  that are captured on follow -up telephone contact [CONTACT_698071] (i.e., up to last scheduled contact). The 
investigator should follow subjects with  SAEs identifi ed after the last scheduled contact [CONTACT_698072], or the subject is lost to follow -up. The investigator should continue 
to report any significant follow -up information to the Sponsor until the event has been 
resolved.  This study requires t hat subjects be actively monitored for SAEs for  at least 14 days 
after discharge from the study . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hepatotoxicity  
Any clinically significant increase in hepatic enzymes and specifically ALT or AST ≥ 3x 
ULN requires immediate repeat test within 48 to 72 h to confirm the hepatic enzyme 
elevation. Study medication should be stopped and the event should be reported as an 
adverse event within the CRF if the enzyme elevation is confirmed or worsening. Potential 
contributors to hepatic enzyme elevation should be eva luated by [CONTACT_093]. The 
investigator is encouraged to consult with the Medical Monitor regarding ongoing diagnostic 
workup.  
Study drug should be permanently discontinued if any of the following criteria is met:  
• ALT or AST > 8xULN;  
• ALT or AST > 3xUL N and (TBL > 2xULN or INR > 1.5);  
• ALT or AST > 3xULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>  5%).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypoglycemia

9.1 General Considerations  
The statistical evalu ation of PK parameters wil l be conducted by [CONTACT_698073].  A 
detailed Statistical and Analytical Plan will be generated prior to initiation of the study.  
Statistical analysis will be performed using Statistical Analysis Software SAS for Windows® 
(SAS Institute Inc.,  [LOCATION_003]).  Non-compartmental analysis will be performed using Phoenix® 
WinNonlin® 6.4 (Certara, [LOCATION_003]).  
9.2 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size for this study is not based upon formal statistical consideration. The sample 
size is considered a dequate to characterize the PK of bexagliflozin, to assess potential food -
drug interactions , and to provide safety and tolerability data on bexagliflozin when 
administered with food (Food and Drug Administration 2002).  
9.3 Analysis Populations  
Statistical anal ysis populations will include:  
Safety:  The Safety Population will include all randomized subjects who receive at least one 
dose of the drug . Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment received . 
PK: The PK  Population will include all randomized su bjects who receive study drug and 
who have sufficient plasma bexagliflozin  measurements to derive at least one PK parameter 
following dosing.  The PK Population will be  used to summarize the PK  parameters.

(ANOVA)  using a linear mixed -effects model will be fitted to the natural logarithmic 
transformation of PK parameters of bexagliflozin  (Cmax, AUC 0-t and AUC 0-∞). The linear 
mixed -effects model will include subject as a random effect, and treatment, period, and 
sequence as fixed effects. The 90% confidence intervals will be constructed for the  fed: 
fasted ratio of the least squares (LS) geometric means of PK p arameters ( Cmax, AUC 0-t and 
AUC 0-∞), with 80 -125% defined as the lack of interaction boundaries.

Descriptive statistics on the PD parameter s will be also performed.  The effect of high -fat 
meal on the cumulative UGE between subjects under fasted and fed conditions will be 
comp ared.   
9.6 Safety Analysis  
Safety data will include adverse events (AEs), physical exam results, vital signs, ECG 
results, and clinical lab results, including serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis. 
Observed data will be described as counts and percentag es for discrete variables and 
estimation of means, standard deviations ( SDs), medians, inter -quartile range, minimum and 
maximum for continuous metrics. All subjects in the Safety Population will be included in 
the safety analyses. All safety data will be presented in by -subject listings and included in the 
clinical trial report.  
9.6.1  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be mapped to preferred term and body system using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The number and percentage of subject s 
reporting adverse events will be determined by [CONTACT_698075]. Drug -related adverse events will be considered those to be possibly related to 
bexagliflozin  administration.  
Adverse event listings will be provided fo r the following subsets:  
• all treatment emergent AEs ( TEAEs ). 
• all TEAEs at least possibly related to bexagliflozin . 
• serious TEAEs (if any) . 
• TEAEs leading to study discontinuation (if any).  
 
AEs are dosing  emergent if they occur on or after bexagliflozin  administration.  TEAEs will 
be considered at least possibly related to bexagliflozin  based on the investigator’s  
assessment . Only TEAEs will be tabulated in summary tables.  If the AE (s) onset date -time or 
date occurs after the first dose  up until right before the next dose, the AE (s) will be assigned 
to the first treatment. Any AE (s) that occur after the second dose up until the follow -up visit 
will be assigned to the second treatment.  
Tabulations will display TEAEs by [CONTACT_698076] .

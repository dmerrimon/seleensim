Introduction  Low back pain (LBP) affects nearly 40% of adults, contributing to 
significant reductions in quality of life and productivity. The opi[INVESTIGATOR_174085], largely driven by [CONTACT_279754], has created an urgent 
need for effective non -pharmacological pain t reatments. Existing options 
such as TENS devices may provide acute relief, but are not available as 
an opi[INVESTIGATOR_279730]. A multimodal approach, combining mechanical 
stimulation, heat, cold, and acupressure, holds promise for reducing 
both acute and chroni c pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_85414].  
Background and 
rationale for the 
study  Between 25 and 50% of patients presenting with acute or exacerbated 
chronic LBP (a/cLBP) receive prescriptions for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. ALBP progresses 
to chronic in 40% of those with moderate to severe pain (4 out of 10 on a 
0 – 10 Numeric Rating Scale). Opi[INVESTIGATOR_279731] 6 weeks after presentation, but increases the risk of cLBP and 
persistent use (5% of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2583]ïve). Providing a multimodal low back pain 
device could reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_279732]; 
providing any devic e could reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_279733].  
Objectives  Primary Objective , Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] : To determine whether the use of a 
multimodal neuromodulatory mechanical stimulation (M -Stim) device 
(DuoTherm) can reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] 30% compared to TENS in those with 
moderate to severe back pain.  
Co-Primary Objective , Acute Pain:  To determine whether multimodal 
M-Stim reduces Pain Intensity 30% more than TENS in the first 10 days 
after presenting for treatment.  
Co-Primary Objective, Chronic Pain: To determine whether multimodal 
M-Stim reduces disability 30% more than TENS at 6 months.  
Study Design  
 A randomized, double -blind controlled trial  with 3- (aLBP) or 6 - month 
(cLBP) follow -up. 
Study Setting  The study will be conducted at mixed physical therapy/chiropractic 
practices in Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia, which offer 
demographic and economic diversity. These clinics provide an ideal 
environment, with frequent follow -ups and ongoing therapy  but no on -
site access to opi[INVESTIGATOR_279734].  
Eligibility 
Criteria  Inclusion Criteria : 
- Male or female adults aged 18 -90 presenting for treatment of acute or 
chronic low back pain  
- Self report of moderate to severe LBP of 4 or greater out of 10 on a 0 -10 
Numeric Rating Scale.  
- Acute: pain duration <3 months not using opi[INVESTIGATOR_279735]  
- Chronic: P ain duration >=3 months with or without ongoing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]  
- Capacity to understand risks and benefits (informed consent).  
- Smartphone for Qualtrics web -based platform use  
Exclusion Criteria : 
- Radicular pain likely reflecting a surgical or mechanical problem  
- Inability to apply or use the device  
- Sensitivity to cold or vibration (e.g Raynaud’s or Sickle Cell Disease)  
- Diabetic neuropathy rendering a patient unable to determine if the 
device is too hot  
- New neurologic deficits, skin lesions over the low back area  
- A contraindication to any medication for pain management that would 
impact analgesic use record  
- Pacemaker  
Intervention  
 The experimental arm DuoTherm is a novel multimodal low back pain 
relief device incorporating 8 harmonic vibration patterns of mechanical 
stimulation (M -Stim) including neuromodulatory frequencies, [ADDRESS_341456] dai ly for 30 
minutes.  The active control is a  prescription 4 -lead 8-channel TENS unit 
(LG Smart)  with variable intensity .  
Participants  will be instructed to use the device for a minimum of [ADDRESS_341457] pain management regimen typi[INVESTIGATOR_279736]. Participants 
will keep the devices and be instructed to use them for pain as needed 
during the duration of the study.   
Outcomes  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_279737]:   
Prior use : For patients with prior or ongoing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], a 30% reduction 
in MME (Milligram Morphine Equivalents) between the first [ADDRESS_341458] 14 days of daily diary recordings using the DOSE data collection 
tool.   
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2583]ïve : 30% reduction of those receiving an opi[INVESTIGATOR_16447] 
“prescribed to me for this event”  
Secondary outcomes : Use days; total MME and use past 7 days in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2583]ïve; use days by [CONTACT_279755]; and prescribing compared to a 
contemporaneous national LBP population (25%) . 
Pain Primary Outcome:  
Chronic: 30% lower disability at 6 months using PROMIS Pain 
Interference for those with ongoing pain >3 months  
Acute: 30% lower NRS 0 -10 “pain now” from entry to [ADDRESS_341459] 2 weeks  
Secondary Outcomes: Change in disability for those with >=57.7 
PROMIS Pain Interference; restoration of function to normal (PI=50); 
integrated analysis with common criteria for restoration of function with 
multifidus stimulation surgery.

Sample Size  To estimate the M -Stim intervention effect size, a  retrospective study of 
59 cLBP patients on chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (100% prolonged opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]) 
reported a 28% reduction in MME  after spi[INVESTIGATOR_279739] ,[40] reducing MME  26.2(SD32.8) compared to 5.8(SD34.2) 
for those with conventional treatment  (effect size 0.[ADDRESS_341461] size of 1 (meaning a difference of [ADDRESS_341462] 
deviation) with 94% power and alpha of .[ADDRESS_341463] a 30%  
prescribing reduction, while 50 participants  on chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_279740] 85.4% power to detec t a 30% reduction  in 
MME. Given the 20% in a previous study by [CONTACT_279756], we increase d 
the cLBP sample to [ADDRESS_341464] referrals, flyers, and digital content like social 
posts and emails targeting local populations. Flyers were also distributed 
at three local pain clinics.  
Randomization  After eligibility screening and informed consent , a 4-digit participant ID 
and the intervention allocation were randomly assigned  by [CONTACT_279757]. A copy of the informed consent was  emailed to the 
participant.  
Blinding 
(masking)  
 Participants were blinded to which device powered the study hypothesis, 
and blinded to their assigned intervention until after documenting initial 
NRS pain intensity. Success of blinding the study device (M -Stim) versus 
the active control (TENS) was tested  at months 3 -6 with prompts, “select 
which group you think you were in (control or treatment)” and “How 
confident are you (0 = Least Confident ... 100 = Most Confident).”  
The protocol statistician and study coordinator knew the intervention 
assignments during enrollment but did not conduct statistical analysis. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_279741], with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_279742]. The 
analyzing s tatistician was blinded to device assignment until completion 
of data cleaning and initial analysis.  
Data Collection 
Methods  
 Site coordinators entered identification and contact [CONTACT_279758] a tablet, then recorded weight, height, and duration 
to confirm acute or chronic follow -up duration, then participants took the 
tablet to record pain intensity on a 0-[ADDRESS_341465] options for Dose per pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (34) , Opi[INVESTIGATOR_167157], 
e.g. hydrocodone, hydromorphone etc. (15) and the Source (DOSE tool, 
Supplement 2 ).  Sources included “prescribed to me for this event”, 
“prescribed to me for another event”, “given to me by a family member”, 
“given to me by a friend”, “given to me by [CONTACT_279759]”, 
or “purchased from someone without a prescription”. These were  
converted to a total milligram morphine equivalent (MME) for analysis.  
Participants recorded when they used their device, duration of use, and 
any additional pain relief modalities (exercise, stretching, bath, hot tub, 
therapy, massage). Patients were asked to record any thermal use or 
therapy cycle or channel as appropriate to their device.  
Participants verbally endorsing pain for less than three months (acute) 
were entered into a 3 month follow -up program, or  6 months (chronic)  for 
those for whom back pain had been an ongoing problem for more than [ADDRESS_341466] to determine differences in primary 
and secondary outcomes.  
An intention -to-treat analysis included all participants meeting inclusion 
criteria. Summary statistics (means, standard deviations, proportions) 
were calculated using T -tests and Chi -squared tests. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_279743] p ercent of change and relative 
risks. Diary entries and item -level data were analyzed for missing data to 
assess the need for imputation. Relative risks were calculated for MME 
and opi[INVESTIGATOR_279744], with paired T -tests 
used to com pare first two and last two weeks of MME in those who used 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_9799]. A linear regression assessed BMI's interaction 
with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], calculating marginal effects with standard errors via the 
Delta Method. Data analysis was performed using S TATANow/SE 18.5.  
For pain outcomes, in addition to the above methods, missing [ADDRESS_341467] reserves the right to audit any research files to 
assure the quality of any data used in this research  
Safety/Harm  Q191165/S001  FDA ruled Non -significant Risk [ADDRESS_341468] heat/cold therapy. Patients will be screened for sensitivity to 
cold or vibration. Any significant adverse events will be repo rted to the 
IRB and NIH within [ADDRESS_341469] 
(IRB) to ensure compliance with protocol and safety regulations, and by

Institute IRB and is registered under [STUDY_ID_REMOVED].  
Protocol 
Amendments  Revision Chronology:  
1) 8/10/2019 Original  
[COVID delay]  
2) 4/21/2022 Incorporated FDA recommended modifications from 
Q191165 incorporated to protocol: increased sample size to 60 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2583]ïve acute and 100 chronic (with 6 months followup); 
Replaced Sham with LG Smart TENS  active control with [ADDRESS_341470] month. We extended 
the follow -up from one week for acute pain to 3 months for acute 
pain and 6 months for chronic pain.  
3) 6/8/2022 – Final survey design reduced daily diary reporting to 1 
month due to budget constraints of longer follow -up. Depression 
and Catastrophizing only as baseline; weekly NRS Pain 
Interference (3) PROMIS Pain Interference (2) and Pain Intensity 
collected until 3 months for all; “Past month NRS” added to 
monthly surveys added past month NRS, Blinding assessment for 
additional 3 months for those started in chronic strata.  
Added “source” for each opi[INVESTIGATOR_279728], dose, and number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353].  
We intended to use evaluate change in MME over time for chronic 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155]. The FDA recommended requiring participants on 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_279745]. As we did not have 
access to prescribing records, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_279746] a desired 
outcome measure, we evaluated opi[INVESTIGATOR_279747]. We 
extended the baseline and follow -up Pain Intensity 
measurements to one month rather than one week.  
3a) 8/31/22 – Site Visit. PI [INVESTIGATOR_279748] “will not fit” criteria 
rather than BMI of 30 from pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. New device fits variable 
BMI, based on abdominal girth. Retained “if device fits”, 
exclusion criteria using BMI changed to BMI >50, noting 
controversy in using BMI as exclusion criteria.  
4) 5/5/23; Added “Do you think you will need surgery” and “do you 
think you will need epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873]” questions, and “did you get surgery” 
and “did you get an epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873]” to monthly.  
5) 7/13/2023 New Location added  
Stratification by [CONTACT_279761][INVESTIGATOR_279749]: enrollment strata 
were based on verbal endorsement of duration and no acute opi[INVESTIGATOR_279750]. Initial evaluation of registration data after enrollment was 
complete revealed 16 of 60 in the “acute” strata reported a duration 
longer than three months , and half in each chronicity strata no prior 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_279751].  In consultation with Clinical Trials.gov, we pooled the 
data and included both opi[INVESTIGATOR_279752] a single

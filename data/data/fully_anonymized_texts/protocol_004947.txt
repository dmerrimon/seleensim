Brief Summary/Abstract  
 
The purpose of this randomized control trial is to compare visual performan ce and simulated 
driving performance of adults with astigmatism when wearing 1*DAY ACUVUE® MOIST for 
ASTIGMATISM (toric), 1*DAY ACUVUE® MOIST (spherical control), and 1*DAY ACUVUE® MOIST 
(placebo) contact [CONTACT_13276].  Following informed consent, up to [ADDRESS_1083114] lenses (placebo, 
spherical, or toric  in randomized order ).  Each subject will then watch a video (15 minutes) for 
adaptation purposes, will read letters on standa rd eye charts, and will complete vision tests and 
driving  tests in a driving simulator (45 minutes).  The subject will repeat  this sequence with the 
other two types of lenses.  An ANOVA will be performed to look for a main effect of lens 
condition. Separate contrasts will be done to compare toric vs. spherical, toric vs. placebo, and 
spherical vs. placebo lenses.  Investigating the lenses under these conditions, which involve eye 
movement demands, will lend insight into the potential advantages of toric ove r spherical 
contact [CONTACT_13276].  
Background  
1. Provide the scientific background, rationale and relevance of this project.   
 
Problem :  Driving is a routine part of daily living in industrialized nations, with over [ADDRESS_1083115] good visual, 
biomechanical, and cognitive abilities, and the relative importance of these abilities to various 
aspects of driving performance is beginning to emerge.4,5 The presen t study focuses on vision-
IRB-HSR # [ZIP_CODE] : Evaluating and Improving Functional Driving Vision of Patients with 
Astigmatism: Phase 3  
Page 4 of 31 
Version date 12/10/[ADDRESS_1083116] of vision on driving 
performance: the consequences of driving with cylindrical blur from uncorrected astigmatism.  
The effect of cylindrical blur on driving performance is of particular interest because there 
are a substantial number of people who drive with some degree of uncorrected astigmatism 
and potentially pose a risk to driving performance. This group comprises those who fail to 
update their prescriptio ns in a timely manner, those with residual astigmatism following lens or 
refractive surgeries, and contact [CONTACT_787177] (e.g. ≤ 0.75D) who are 
intentionally not corrected for astigmatism. These latter patients are often fitted with s pherical 
contact [CONTACT_787178] a toric lens 
alternative can sometimes be unstable as well as more expensive than spherical lenses.6,[ADDRESS_1083117] to date of driving -relevant 
performance with cylindrical blur. In their study to discern the everyday challen ges posed by 
[CONTACT_787179], 21 participants with up to 4.00 diopters of 
induced cylindrical blur performed several tasks including a split attention task in which they 
viewed a 14 inch computer monitor showing the perspe ctive of a person sitting in a driver’s 
seat. During a [ADDRESS_1083118], two hazards (a lead vehicle braking and an intrusion 
by a pedestrian) were presented [ADDRESS_1083119] could be due to any number of factors, such as limitations imposed 
by [CONTACT_2329] a small, 17 inch, graphically sparse computer monitor.32 Therefore, the safety of 
astig matic drivers using spherical -only corrections is still an open question.  
 
Phase 1 and 2 Studies :  To address this problem, a [ADDRESS_1083120] lens wearers with mil d 
to moderate astigmatism (0.75 to 1.75D) are safer drivers when corrected with toric vs. 
spherical lenses. If significant differences were obtained in these first two Phases, then a Phase 
3 Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) was to be implemented to confirm the preliminary findings.  
IRB-HSR # [ZIP_CODE] : Evaluating and Improving Functional Driving Vision of Patients with 
Astigmatism: Phase 3  
Page 5 of 31 
Version date 12/10/[ADDRESS_1083121] lens wearers with low to moderate 
astigmatism exhibited better simulated driving performance with toric lenses than with 
spherical lenses (Figure 1). Furthermore, post hoc analysis fou nd that the greater the 
astigmatism correction, the greater the improvement in driving performance. These driving 
results suggest that correcting small amounts of astigmatism may be important to driving 
safety. Therefore, confirming these findings in a RCT  will be important to the general public, 
insurance institutions, regulatory bodies, and contact [CONTACT_787180].  
 
FIGURE 1:  Mean Tactical Composite z scores for 
the [ADDRESS_1083122] error bars are found for the toric lens 
condition.  
 
Following confirmation, it will be important to know the reasons why toric lenses improve 
driving performance. Is it simply due to visual acuity improvement or are other factors 
involved? In Phases [ADDRESS_1083123] vision tests prim arily require 
fixations and small eye movement capabilities. We propose to investigate both of these

Astigmatism: Phase 3  
Page 6 of 31 
Version date 12/10/[ADDRESS_1083124] lenses.  
Hypotheses to be Tested  
Consistent with our goal to replicate the Phase 2 outcomes, our primary hypothesis is:  
 
H1: Drivers with low to moderate levels of astigmatism will drive more safely when 
wearing toric compared to spherical contact [CONTACT_13276].  
 
Consistent with our goal to extend the Phase 2 findings, our secondary hypotheses are:  
 
H2: Drivers with low levels of astigmatism will demonstrate better driving -specific visual 
abilities when wearing toric compared to spherical lenses.  
 
H3: Any benefit in driving performance from wearing toric lenses (H1) will increase with 
the magnitude of astigmatism correction.  
 
Following Phase [ADDRESS_1083125] to 
demonstrate the following:  
 
H4: Performance on driving -specific vision tests involving significant eye movements will 
be better with toric vs. spherical contact [CONTACT_13279], while performance with toric and 
spherical corrections will be  equivalent on tasks biased toward steady gaze.  
 
H5: Subjects will be aware of better vision and better driving performance when driving 
with toric lenses.  
 
H6: The driving -specific visual ability tests will correlate moderately with standard 
clinical vis ion tests. This will provide concurrent validation that driving -relevant vision 
tests offer advantages over standard visual tests when assessing drivers.  
 
An additional study objective is to investigate  whether  toric contact [CONTACT_787181] -specific benefits.

2.  What are the statistical considerations for the protocol?  
Primary Hypothesis:  
Hypothesis 1 : Drivers with low  to moderate levels of astigmatism wearing toric rather than 
sphe rical lenses will demonstrate significantly safer driving simulator performance.  
 
An ANOVA will be performed on the Composite Driving Scores to look for a main effect 
of lens condition (placebo lenses, spherical lenses, toric lenses).  Separate contrasts w ill 
be done to compare toric vs. spherical, toric vs. placebo, and spherical vs. placebo 
lenses.  
Secondary Hypotheses:  
Hypothesis 2 : Drivers with low to moderate levels of astigmatism wearing toric rather than 
spherical lenses will demonstrate significantly better driving -specific visual abilities.  
 
An ANOVA will be performed on the Composite Vision Scores to look for a main effect of 
lens condition (placebo lenses, spherical lenses, toric lenses).  Separate contrasts will be 
done to compare toric vs. spher ical, toric vs. placebo, and spherical vs. placebo lenses.  
 
Hypothesis 3 : The driving performance benefit from toric lenses will be related to the degree of 
astigmatism in each subject.  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_787172]’ composite driving scores and 
the magnitude of astigmatism correction in their toric study lenses.  
Additional Hypotheses:  
Hypothesis 4 : Performance on driving -specific vision tests involving significant eye 
movements will be better with toric vs. spherical contact [CONTACT_93827], while performance 
with toric and spherical corrections will be equivalent on tasks biased toward steady 
gaze.  
 
An ANOVA will be performed on the scores from the Eye Movement  test (operational 
driving  test)  to look for a main effect of lens condition  (spherical vs. toric lenses).  
 
Hypothesis 5 : Subjects will be aware of better vision and better driving performance when 
driving with toric lenses.

Pi[INVESTIGATOR_787172]’ performance on the standard 
clinical vision tests and the vision tests in the simulator for each contact [CONTACT_787188].  
Acuity measures will be correlated with the operational static visual acuity test. Contrast 
sensitivity measures will be correlated with the operational contrast sensitivity and glare 
tests. The UFoV test will be correlated with the oper ational divided attention test.  
Exploratory Analyses:  
We will perform Multivariate MANOVAs on all of the driving and vision -based variables to 
determine if toric contact [CONTACT_787189] -specific benefits.  
 
3.  Provide a justification for the  sample size used in this protocol.   
We will obtain consent from up to 79 potential subjects, in order to obtain data on 54 active 
drivers with astigmatism. Power analyses on Phase 2 outcome measures indicated a sample 
size of 43 would provide a >80% chance of finding a significant difference (p<.05) in driving 
performance between the spherical and toric lens conditions. This sample size also has 
enough power to show that driving performance with spherical and toric lenses would be 
superior to no -correctio n. This allows for up to 25  non-completers, consistent with our 
Phase 2 experience.    
4.  What is your plan for primary variable analysis?  
The primary analysis evaluates differences between the contact [CONTACT_787190] (primary outcome variable).  Overall driving competency is defined 
by a composite score of [ADDRESS_1083129] assessment.  This will be done using a 3 Condition (placebo, 
sphere, t oric) X 3 Session (1st, 2nd, 3rd test) ANOVA, anticipating only a condition effect.  
 
5.  What is your plan for secondary variable analysis?  
N/A 
 
6. Have you been working with a statistician in designing this protocol?  
 Yes 
 
IF YES, what is their name?

7.  Will data from multiple sites be combined during analysis?   
NO

Biomedical Research  
1.  What will be done in this protocol?    
 
Testing  
Driving simulator:   We will use the Model T3 
simulator, developed by [CONTACT_787191] a traumatic brain 
injury.i,ii  This simulator display covers a 210○ field of 
view on a white curved screen inside an 8 foot 
diameter cylinder (Figure 1).  The image is generated 
by [CONTACT_391393] e digital projectors, each projecting 70○ 
segments of the visual image. While this system has 
side and rear view mirrors, these will be deactivated for this study.  This system allows 
assessment of driving abilities at two levels: 1) operational or specific driving abilities like 
dynamic vision, and 2) tactical or general driving ability.  Tactical driving ability will be assessed 
as drivers travel through simulated space to negotiate road and traffic demands on rural, urban, 
and highway roads.  
 
Operationa l Tests :  These tests evaluate driving -relevant visual ability, using driving -relevant 
stimuli and context while driving through simulated space.  For the operational tests, subjects 
will drive in the center lane of a three -lane highway, at a constant spee d achieved through 
“cruise control”.  While at a constant speed, they will perform the six operational vision tests 
detailed below:  
• Static visual acuity -  reading aloud white letters on a black sign. The letters become 
progressively smaller.  
• Contrast sens itivity - reading aloud letters that become progressively lighter on a white sign 
(lowering contrast) . 
• Visual processing speed -  reading aloud pairs of letters on a black sign . The letters have 
progressively shorter  exposure times . 
• Dynamic vision -  reading  aloud letters that scroll across a black road sign at progressively 
faster rates . 
• Glare sensitivity – this is the dynamic vision test in the presence of glare. Standard clinical 
instruments will be used to producing uniform glare.  
• Eye movement test –  read ing aloud letters from  road signs that appear briefly along the 
roadside. Subjects must make large eye movements and discern the letters quickly to be 
successful.  
 
Tactical Test : The tactical driving test is  a simulated drive through our standard road test  
scenarios ([ADDRESS_1083130], or  urban roads while negotiating various traffic signals, 
IRB-HSR # [ZIP_CODE] : Evaluating and Improving Functional Driving Vision of Patients with 
Astigmatism: Phase 3  
Page 12 of 31 
Version date 12/10/[ADDRESS_1083131] conditions ).  The simulator keeps track of every driving response. 
This generates 17 different outcome variables (e.g. time spent exceeding the speed limit by [ADDRESS_1083132], and number of rolling stops).   
 
Scoring: For both the operational and tactical tests,  the separate outcome variables are 
converted to z- scores and then summed into a composite operation al and tactical score.  
Performance under the three contact [CONTACT_787192] 
(primary outcome variable) and on individual driving and vision parameters.  
 
RCT procedure:  This will be a randomized, double blind design,  with testing under three contact 
[CONTACT_787193] (toric, spherical, placebo). Each condition will be equally likely to occur first, and 
the order in which they are worn will remain unknown to the participants and research 
assistant. Neither the participan ts nor the research assistant will be told of the directional 
hypothesis, that the toric lenses will be superior to the spherical lenses.  
 
Cont act lenses will be ordered for potential subjects who pass the telephone screen,  and 
delivered to the UVa Virginia Driving Safety Laboratory where they will be available on  the 
potential subject’s scheduled study testing day. Three sets of lenses (placebo, control, and test) 
will be ordered by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Banton based on the individual’s current contact [CONTACT_32494]. These 
will be free of charge to the participants.  
 
On the day of testing, participants will be instructed to come to the Virginia Driving Safety 
Laboratory wearing their usual contact [CONTACT_13276]. After  informed consent, the following will occur:  
 
1. Subjects will be given a brief vision screening to verify that they  meet the vision -based 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and to provide concurrent validation of the driving -relevant 
operational vision tests . The screening  will include a brief ocular history, a review of 
their current contact [CONTACT_32494], a peripheral vision test in which subjects report 
when they see objects presented to their side, an inspection of  the eyes with a small 
light for signs of irritation or infection, and clinical tests of visual ability  (read ing letters 
aloud from standard acuity charts, read ing letters aloud fr om contrast sensitivity charts 
[with and without glare] , and identify ing visual targets in the Useful Field of View [UFoV]  
test). Participants will wear  their personal contact [CONTACT_787194] .  
2. Participants  will then undergo our Simulation Adaptation Screening (SAS) on the driving 
simulator.  They  will drive the simulator for 15 minutes to identify the occurrence of any 
simulation sickness  (transitory nausea, upset stomac h which diminishes upon 
termination of the simulated drive) .  If they rate simulation sickness greater than [ADDRESS_1083133] lenses (placebo, spherical, or toric ) to subjects in a 
double blinded manner (neither subject nor simulator staff will know the lens condition) 
according to the randomization scheme.  Subjects will remove their personal contact 
[CONTACT_787195].

knowledge of the event.  
 
1.  Definitions  
1.1 How will you define adverse events (AE)? 
An adverse event will be  considered any undesirable sign, symptom or medical 
condition considered related to the intervention . Medical condition/diseases 
present before starting the intervention will be considered adverse events only if 
they worsen after starting the study and that worsening is considered to be 
related to the study intervention.  An adverse event is also any undesirable and 
unintended effect of research occurring in human subjects as a result of the 
collection of identifiable private information under the research .   
 
1.2 How will you define an unanticipated problem?  
An unanticipated problem is any issue that involves increased risk(s)  
to participants or others.  This means issues or problems that cause the subject 
or others to be placed at greater risk than previously identified, even if the 
subject or others do not incur actual harm.  For example if a subject’s 
confidentiality is compromised resulting in serious negative social, legal or 
economic ramifications, an unanticipated problem would need to be reported. 
(e.g serious loss of social status, loss of job, interpersonal conflict.)     
 
1.3 What are the definitions of a protocol violation and/or noncompliance?  
A protocol violation is defined as any change, deviation, or departure from the 
study design or procedures of  research project that is NOT approved by [CONTACT_1201] -HSR 
prior to its initiation or implementation .  Protocol violations may be major or minor 
violations.   
 
Noncompliance can be a protocol violation OR deviation from standard operating 
procedures, Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), federal, state or local regulation s.   
Noncompliance may be serious or continuing  
 
1.4 What is the definition of a data breach?  
A data breach is defined in the HITECH Act (43 USC [ZIP_CODE]) as an unauthorized 
acquisition, access, or use of pr otected health information (PHI) that compromises 
the security or privacy of such information.

Expected Risks related to study 
participation  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_230169] a small risk that bre aches 
of privacy and/or confidentiality 
might occur. The risk of violation 
of subject privacy and 
confidentiality is minimal due to 
the requirements of the privacy 
plan in this protocol.  Occurs rarely  
The risk of wearing study contact 
[CONTACT_787198], e. g. corneal 
abrasion if put in improperly, eye 
infection if contaminated.   Occurs rarely  
 
Simulation Adaptation Syndrome, 
characterized by: [CONTACT_80355], 
nausea and/or headaches will be 
minimized because of the age 
group and  the gradual 
introduction of virtual reality.  Occurs rarely  
 
3.  When will recording and reporting of unanticipated problems/adverse events begin?  
__X___After subject signs consent  
 
4.  When will the recording/reporting of unanticipated problems/adverse e vents end?  
__X___End of intervention  
 
5.  What is your plan for safety monitoring?   
Safety monitoring and aggregate review of adverse events, unanticipated problems, 
protocol violations and any data breach will be performed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_32397] -HSR 
through continuation review at least annually.

Risk/ Benefit Analysis  
1.  What are the potential benefits for the participant as well as benefits which may accrue to 
society in general, as a result of this study?  
There are no immediate benefits for subjects participating in this study;  
Potential benefits to society include i ncreased knowledge regarding the efficacy of toric lenses 
for people with astigmatism, with regard to driving.   
 
2.  Do the anticipated benefits justify asking subjects to undertake the risks?   
There is minimal risk to subjects –  the risks of inserting c ontacting lenses are no greater than 
those encountered by [CONTACT_787200].  Simulator assessment poses a 
minimal risk of Simulation Adaptation Syndrome (characteristics listed above) , the symptoms of 
which are transient .  The risk be nefit ratio is acceptable.

for review prior to use.  The IRB -HSR will provide the study team with a Receipt 
Acknowledgement for their reco rds.  Retention incentive items are such things as water bottles, 
small tote bags, birthday cards etc.  Cash and gift cards are not allowed as retention incentives.  
 
Clinical Privileges  
The following procedures will be followed:  
• Investigators who are members of the clinical staff at the University of Virginia Medical 
Center must have the appropriate credentials and been granted clinical privileges to 
perform specific clinical procedures whether those procedures are experimental or 
standard.   
• The IRB canno t grant clinical privileges.    
• Performing procedures which are outside the scope of the clinical privileges that have 
been granted may result in denial of insurance coverage should claims of negligence or 
malpractice arise.  
• Personnel on this protocol will have the appropriate credentials and clinical privileges in 
place before performing any procedures required by [CONTACT_3181].  
• Contact [CONTACT_156866] - 924-9055 or 924 -8778 for further information.  
 
Sharing of Data/Specimens  
Data and specimens co llected under an IRB approved protocol are the property of the 
University of Virginia.  You must have “permission” to share data/ specimens outside of UVa 
other than for a grant application and or publication.  This “permission” may come in the form 
of a c ontract with the sponsor or a material transfer agreement (MTA) with others.  A contract/ 
MTA is needed to share the data outside of UVa even if the data includes no HIPAA identifiers 
and no code that could link the data back to a HIPAA identifier.

publication, without a signed contract/MTA approved by [CONTACT_787201]/ OSP or written confirmation that one is not needed.  
• No specimens will be shared o utside of UVa without a signed contract/MTA approved 
by [CONTACT_156867]/ OSP or written confirmation that one is not 
needed.  
 
Prisoners  
If the original protocol/ IRB application stated that no prisoners would be enrolled in this study 
and subsequently a subject becomes a prisoner, the study team must notify the IRB 
immediately.  The study team and IRB will need to determine if the subject will remain in the 
study.  If the subject will remain in the study, the protocol will have to be re -reviewed with the 
input of a prisoner advocate.  The prisoner advocate will also have to be involved in the review 
of future continuations, modifications or any other reporting such as protocol violations or 
adverse events.   
 
Prisoner - Individuals are prisoners if they are in any kind of penal institution, such as a prison, 
jail, or juvenile offender facility, and their ability to leave the institution is restricted. Prisoners 
may be convicted felons, or may be untried persons who are detained pending judi cial action, 
for example, arraignment or trial.

who may not be able to tolerate driving the simulator without feeling discomfort.  
 
8. Would you consider the use of this device to be minimal risk?  Why or why not?  
The device is of minimal risk. The only risk we know of is that some people can  feel 
uncomfortable after driving the simulator for a while. This response is similar to the discomfort 
some people feel from watching large -screen movies. The response is transient, is less likely to 
occur in younger adults (our population target), and do es not affect everyone. Screening is 
designed to exclude those who are susceptible to this risk.

Critically ill patients may experience pain related to their underlying illness, trauma, 
disease processes, surgery or other non-surgical interventions (Tietze, 2012). The primary goal of analgesia is optimizing patient comfort in conjunction with balancing the negative physiologic responses to pain including hypermetabolism, increased oxygen consumption, hypercoagulability, and alterations in immune function (Tietze, 2012). Acute pain is defined as a, “complex, unpleasant experience with emotional and cognitive, as well as sensory, features that occur in response to tissue trauma” (American Pain Society, 2012, p. 10).
Uncontrolled or poorly managed pain leads to serious medical complications; impairs 
recovery from injury or procedures; negatively impacts quality of life; progresses to chronic pain, and increases morbidity, mortality and length of ICU or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] (Malchow & Black, 2008). A number of studies indicate a high incidence of untreated pain in ICU settings (Malchow & Black, 2008). Payen et al. (2007) demonstrated in a recent study that 90% of ICU patients were treated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]; whereas, only 42% were assessed for pain. In addition, procedural analgesics and nonopi[INVESTIGATOR_403937]. The reluctance to offer pain medication within the acute care setting is understandable and multifactorial.  
Evaluation and treatment of pain in trauma patients is complicated by [CONTACT_102]’s 
pathologic condition, the effects of medications, and the diverse interventions used in 
patient care (Freire, Afessa, Cawley, Phelps, & Bridges, 2002). Several authors suggest 
trauma complications such as hypovolemia, coagulopathies, and head and spi[INVESTIGATOR_403938] (Lovrincevic, Kotob, & Santarosa, 2005; Chanques et al., 2006)  Trauma exerts pervasive effects on a multitude of body systems, specifically making this population more susceptible to the side effects of analgesics or sedative drugs (Chanques et al., 2006). Health care providers are; therefore, more cautious and limited in their choice of opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007].   
Acute pain is more difficult to manage and control if permitted to become severe; making 
prompt, preemptive, and adequate treatment imperative (APS, 2012). Acute pain is most often nociceptive responding to non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_403939]. Pharmacological management :,5%

is the cornerstone of acute pain management with opi[INVESTIGATOR_403940]. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_403941]. The use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]; however, is often limited due to related adverse side effects including sedation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], nausea and vomiting, constipation, hallucinations, confusion, sedation, and allergic reactions (Bookstaver, 2010). Their use has also been linked to compromised function of the immune system.  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_403942] (Sinatra & Jahr, 2011). Adjunctive agents for pain including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) may be used in combination with opi[INVESTIGATOR_403943]. The APS (2012) advocates the use of multimodal analgesia including non steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) for optimal pain control in the treatment of acute traumatic pain. The rationale behind multimodal therapy is to capi[INVESTIGATOR_403944].
The potential side effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_403945] a synergistic approach to pain management suggests medications such as IV iIbuprofen may be beneficial in treating pain in trauma patients. Additionally, 
intravenous (IV) medications are preferred in critically ill patients because 
gastrointestinal (GI)dysfunction can lead to unpredictable absorption of medications 
given orally (Tietze, 2012). Multi-modal therapy can help avoid common complications 
of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-centered analgesia including physical dependence, addiction, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341] (Malchow & Black, 2008).
IV ibuprofen was approved for use in the [LOCATION_002] in June of [ADDRESS_509301] to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], and reduction of fever (Sinatra & Jahr, 2011). Similar to oral ibuprofen, the IV formulation can inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2. IV ibuprofen has more ‘balanced’ affinity for the COX isoenzymes. In key clinical trials, bleeding gastric and renal events were similar to placebo. This has significant implications for the clinical use of IV iIbuprofen. IV Caldolor is also available on the formulary of Delray Medical 
Center and has been available since late 2009.
The efficacy and safety of IV of IV  ibuprofen related to pain management has mainly 
been studied with post-operative orthopedic patients. Southworth, Peters, Rock and 
Pavliv (2009) conducted a multi-center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled dose-ranging study to assess the effects of IV ibuprofen vsversus placebo in [ADDRESS_509302] 24 hours (p=0.030) and significant reductions in pain at rest and with movement. Another study done by [CONTACT_403957], Meadows, Rock, and Pavliv (2011) was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IV ibuprofen at the initiation of wound closure. IV iIbuprofen was continued for 8 doses and then as needed every 6 
 ͵
hours for up to [ADDRESS_509303] and with movement. As with the dose-ranging study there was no difference in treatment-emergent AE’s, including nausea and flatulence, between the study groups. Singla, Rock and Pavliv (2010) conducted a multi-center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of IV Iibuprofen for treatment of pain in post-operative 
orthopedic adult patients. Pre and post operative administration of IV ibuprofen 
significantly reduced both pain and morphine use in orthopedic surgery patients in this study.
Multiple studies done with orthopedic patients have demonstrated the efficacy of using 
IV ibuprofen for treatment of acute pain leading to significant reductions in pain and decreased use of narcotics. Additionally, Orlando Regional Medical Center a Level I trauma center conducted a retrospective study of IV ibuprofen and traumatic rib fracture. The study demonstrated that early IV ibuprofen therapy with traumatic rib fractures significantly decreases narcotic requirements and resulted in clinically significant decreases in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577]. The authors suggest IV ibuprofen should be given upon admission to augment pain control and recommend a prospective study.

above) will be consented and randomized by [CONTACT_5051] . team. All individuals 
who are part of the research team will work under the direct supervision of the PI, are 
responsible for completing NIH or other demonstration of completion of a course in Good Clinical Practice training in addition to Delray Medical Center’s (DMC) specific research training including confidentiality and compliance requirements.  
Once the patient has been identified as an eligible candidate for the study based on the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria the research team will confirm with the treating physician that there are no other factors preventing the patient from being enrolled in the study. The inclusion/exclusion  (I/E) sheet is completed and initialed by [CONTACT_403958]. The patient is then approached for informed consent. 
Once the patient has signed the informed consent , a copy iswill be provided to the 
patient  and ,oneiswill be placed in the chart (per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23155]). The signed I/E 
sheet is placed in a designated IV iIbuprofen binder within each unit.  
Once the patient has signed the informed consent and the I/E sheet has been completed ,
the research team member will place the order set (already created and made available to 
the research team) in the computer under [CONTACT_403962] (PI) as protocol orders. The orders will include a pharmacy consult  and will , bbe flagged as a study protocol. Study

The study drug IV ibuprofen has been approved by [CONTACT_403959] [ADDRESS_509305] to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], and reduction of fever (Sinatra & Jahr, 2011). It has been used and approved for use in trauma and acute care patients and is on the formulary at our facility since late 2009. The administration of Pepcid to all trauma patients is a standard prophylaxis for prevention of GI complications given within our trauma unit.  
The goal of this study is not to assess the pharm acokinetics of IV ibuprofen as a drug 
which has been determined by [CONTACT_1622], but to determine its efficacy in managing pain in 
a particular subset of patients; i.e. that of trauma patients with fractures of the extremities, pelvis and/or ribs. The patients are assessed by [CONTACT_403960]. Should there be any changes in lab values, patient status or condition the trauma surgeons will assess the patient as they would any other patient who had been given this medication for treatment of pain or medical condition and make appropriate clinical decisions. The trauma surgeons are made aware that the patient is in the study via rounds and through the computerized charting system.  
To supplement safety for research patients, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_403954], intake and output and lab work upon admission, Day 1, Day 2 and Day 5 with special attention paid to consistent elevated blood pressure, elevated creatinine 
clearance (>3,0 mg/dL), anemia (decreased Hgb, Hct, RBC), fluid retention, edema, 
increased bleeding times (PT, PTT & INR), significantly elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST) and signs and symptoms of GI bleeding (abdominal pain or crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], blood streaked stools, constipation, melena or coffee ground emesis). It should be noted that most adverse events associated with IV Ibuprofen are related to extended or long term use; whereas, this protocol involves only [ADDRESS_509306] of care procedures and not for the specific purposes of the research; therefore some results may not be obtained but data will be included if it is within + or – 3 days after completion of the study (Day 5) .

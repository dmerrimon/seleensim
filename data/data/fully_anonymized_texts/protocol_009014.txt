The

co-primary

a

non-inferiority

A
protocol
deviation
is
when
the

Protocol
are
not
followed.
There
are
two
types
of
protocol
deviations
in
this

major
deviations
and
minor

A
major
deviation
is
deﬁned
as
an
event
that
resulted
in
an
increased
risk
to
a
subject
or
others;
affecting
the
rights,
safety
and/or
welfare
of
the
subject;
or
affecting
the
integrity
of
the
clinical
study.
Major
deviations
include
(but
are
not
limited
to):
failure
to
obtain
Informed
Consent
prior
to
enrollment,
enrolled
subject
who
participated
in
the
study
session
does
not
meet
inclusion/exclusion
criteria
or
unauthorized
use
of

on
a
subject
not
enrolled
in
the
study;
AEs
that
are
not
reported
by
[CONTACT_428759]-speciﬁed

A
minor
protocol
deviation
is
deﬁned
as
deviating
from
the
protocol
and
include
(but
are
not
limited
to):
protocol-required
testing
and/or
study

were
not

R i s k s
This
study
is
a
non-signiﬁcant
risk
device
study,
and
this
study
exposes
subjects
to
minimal
risks
not
expected
to
be
signiﬁcantly
different
from
patients’
routinely
scheduled
colonoscopy
visit.
Possible
risk,
in
addition
to
risks
associated
with
the
clinical
colonoscopy,
may
include:
●
Algorithm
malfunction
or
misinterpretation
leading
to:
○
False
positive
detection
potentially
resulting
in
procedural
delays
due
to
prolonged
interrogation/examination.
However,
the
software
is
not
designed
to
replace
clinical
decision
making.
○
False
negative
missed
detection,
potentially
resulting
in
delayed
patient
treatment.
However,
this
delay
would
have
occurred
regardless
of
device
use.
Additionally,
it
is
possible
physicians
could
develop
an
overreliance
on
the
device.
●
Failure
to
identify
lesions,
potentially
resulting
in
delayed
patient
treatment,
because
of
software
or
hardware
malfunction.
Such
malfunctions
might
include:
○
Incompatibility
with
hardware
and/or
data
source
○
Inadequate
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_428739]
○
Degradation
of
image
quality
○
Prolonged
delay
of
real-time
endoscopic
video
In
all
cases
of
device
malfunction,
the
device
may
be
turned
off
or
unplugged
by
[CONTACT_428751][INVESTIGATOR_428740],
to
avoid
further
procedural
risk,
and
the
procedure
would
continue
as
planned
without
the
use
of
the
EVA-C
System.
Another
risk
of
this
study
includes
breach
of
privacy
and
conﬁdentiality
of
protected
health
information
(PHI).
The
following
measures
will
be
implemented
to
help
minimize
risks
to
subjects
during
the
study:
●
All
PHI
will
be
stored
in
a
secure
locked
oﬃce
on
a
password
protected
computer.
The
informed
consent
forms
will
be
stored
in
a
locked
cabinet
in
a
locked
oﬃce
at
the
site.
Measures
to
ensure
complete
de-identiﬁcation
prior
to
data
transfer
and
analysis
will
be
taken.

following
a
subject's
participation
in
the
study,
the
investigator/institution
should
ensure
that
adequate
medical
care
is
provided
to
a
subject
for
any
adverse
events,
including
clinically
signiﬁcant
laboratory
values,
related
to
the
trial.
The
investigator/institution
should
inform
a
subject
when
medical
care
is
needed
for
intercurrent
illness(es)
of
which
the
investigator
becomes
aware.
In
the
event
medical
care
to
a
subject
is
required,
the
medical
care
given
to,
and
medical
decisions
made
on

should
always
be
the
responsibility
of

(AE)
is
deﬁned
as

The
EVA-C
System
is
a
computer-aided
detection
(CADe)
system
that
uses
artiﬁcial
intelligence
to
aid
in
identifying
colorectal
polyps
during
High
Deﬁnition
White
Light
Endoscopy
(HD-WLE)
based
colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
This
device
connects
the
Gastroenterologist’s
colonoscopy
video
output
source
to
the
main
monitor
and
highlights
the
regions
of
interest
where
the
device
detects
a
potential
lesion.
The
EVA-C
System
overlays
graphical
markers
onto
video
from
the
endoscope
camera
and
does
not
perform
further
processing
to
the
endoscope
video
signal.
This
device
is
not
intended
to
replace
clinical
decision
making.
The
EVA-C
System
consists
of
both
hardware
and
software.
The
device
hardware
connects
the
endoscope
video
output
system
to
the
main
endoscope
display
monitor
(Figure
1).
The
software
employs
artiﬁcial
intelligence
algorithm
(neural
network)
techniques
to
detect
and
localize
regions
of
interest.
Identiﬁed
areas
of
interest
are
highlighted
using
a
bounding
box
(see

The

polyp

deployed
to
both
devices
will
be
identical.
Hardware
used
for
video
and
image
processing
is
also
identical
across
both
devices.
The
primary
differences
between
devices
are
as
follows:
●
EVA-C
Plus
System
will
have
a
touch-screen
that
will
allow
physicians
to
both
adjust 
volume
and
turn
the
polyp-detection
boxes
on
and
off
●
EVA-C
Base
System
will
not
have
a
touch-screen.
Volume
will
be
adjustable
during 
installation
only,
and
polyp
detection
boxes
will
default
to
being
always
on.
The
differences
listed
above
are
principally
the
results
of
human
factors
and
user
research
testing
and
there
is
not
an
expectation
that
the
differences
between
these
two
devices
will
have
a
signiﬁcant
impact
on
our
primary
or
secondary

should
take
adequate
precautions,

label
information

S t a t i s t i c a l
C o n s i d e r a t i o n s
Based
on
previous
feasibility
data,
a
sample
size
of
600
patients
per
arm
(1:1
allocation,
1,200
total
in
both
arms)
would
provide
>99%
Power
to
detect
superiority
for
APC
assuming
a
data
loss
of
15%.
This
same
number
of
patients
would
also
provide
90%
Power
to
detect
superiority
for
ADR,
based
on
the
expected
ADR
of
35%
in
the
control
arm,
and
45%
for
the
intervention
arm..
Based
on
the
assumption
that
PPA
will
be
at
least
70%
in
both
arms,
Power
for
the
PPA
non-inferiority
comparison
will
be
>
90%.
The
co-primary
endpoint
of
PPA
will
be
tested
for
non-inferiority
using
a
non-inferiority
margin
of
10%.
PPA
will
be
calculated
for
each
arm
as
the
number
of
positive
biopsies
of
total
removed
lesions.
A
resampling
distribution
of
the
difference
in
PPA
will
be
used
to
calculate
a
two-sided
95%
conﬁdence
interval
for
the
difference:
PPA(intervention)-PPA(control).
Non-inferiority
will
be
concluded
if
the
lower
conﬁdence
limit
of
the
95%
two-sided
conﬁdence
interval
is
above
-10%.
For
APC,
superiority
will
be
assessed
based
on
a
one-sided
test
of
the
difference
in
mean
rates
at
a
0.[ADDRESS_542454]
at
a
one-sided
0.025
level
of
signiﬁcance.
Interim
analysis:
When
approximately
[ADDRESS_542455]
completed
the
trial,
an
interim
analysis
will
be
conducted,
and
a
conditional
power
analysis
will
be
performed.
The
conditional
power
will
assess
the
probability
(power)
that
the
study
will
meet
its
objectives
on
the
superiority
endpoint
of
APC
and
ADR,
and
on
the
non-inferiority
of
the
PPA
endpoint.
If
the
conditional
power
is
below
90%
for
either
one
of
the
co-primary
endpoints
or
for
ADR,
an
increase
in
the
sample
size
from
1200
up
to
2400
will
be
considered.

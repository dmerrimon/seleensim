 3 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
Patients with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437708] (AERD) ar e at risk for serious 
bronchospasm when undergoing aspi[INVESTIGATOR_199535]. In this study, Xolair [Omalizumab] will 
be administered for 16 weeks in a double blind, placebo controlled study to determine whether 
Omalizumab is associated with statistically si gnificant attenuation of bronchospastic reaction 
during aspi[INVESTIGATOR_199535].  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_437709] -induced bronchospasm (1 -9), 
severe bronchospasm may still occur during aspi[INVESTIGATOR_199535]. For this reas on, patients 
currently must undergo aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437710] a setting with the capacity for close monitoring 
and presence of personnel and equipment necessary to manage severe and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_437711]. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437712] g enerally performed in an inpatient setting.  
Administration of Omalizumab has the potential to favorably alter this situation by [CONTACT_437800], and may permit aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437713].  
  
Title  of Study:   
A placebo -controlled, double -blind investigation of the therapeutic utility of Xolair 
[Omalizumab] for attenuating aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437714]:  
The primary aim of this study is to examine the effect of Omalizumab on aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -induced 
bronchospasm occurring during aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437715].  Secondary 
objectives include assessment of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437716], proportion of 
subjects with declines in FEV1 of 20% and of 40%.  We also will measure change in serum and 
urinary markers of eosinophil activation in association with Omalizumab treatment and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437717], and degree of change in urin ary LTE4 during aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437718].  
Study  Rational:    
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437719], medication reliance, and improved quality of life; however, due  to risk for serious 
bronchospasm, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437720].  We 
propose to assess the hypothesis that Omalizumab administration can reduce severity of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] - 
induced bronchospasm. The CDC 
(www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/pubs/pubd/hestats/asthma/asthma.htm ) estimates 68 per 1,000 
adult Americans 18 years and over (14 million) currently have asthma.  The corresponding 
estimate based  on these data is that there are as many as 1.[ADDRESS_554726] 
(10). If our hypothesis is confirmed, Omalizumab would have substantial utility for management 
of this large subgroup of asthmatics, and would lead to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437721].

 6 1 INTRODUCTION  
Omalizumab was recently approved by [CONTACT_437802] -
severe asthma, who are not achieving the goals of asthma management despi[INVESTIGATOR_437726] “controller” medications.  Based on evidence 
demonstrating its utility for improving asthma outcomes and reducing medication reliance (11, 
12), this humanized monoclonal anti -IgE antibody has been welcomed enthusiastically by [CONTACT_437803]/Immunology  community.  The anti -inflammatory effects of Omalizumab were recently 
demonstrated in a study by [CONTACT_437804], et al (13), who carried out a randomized, double blind, 
placebo -controlled trial of 45 mild -moderate asthmatics with sputum eosinophilia ≥ 2%.  
Bronchial biopsies performed after [ADDRESS_554728] ion occurs due to release of higher levels of 
leukotrienes and greater end -organ responsiveness to leukotrienes (3).  It follows that a dramatic 
decline in eosinophils encouraged by [CONTACT_437805] [ADDRESS_554729] on attenuating asp irin induced bronchospasm.  We also will assess eosinophilic 
inflammation by [CONTACT_437806] 3 -bromotyrosine (BrTyr) and 3, 5 -
dibromotyrosine (Br2Tyr).  Previous studies (14,15) have shown that eosinophil activation 
promotes formation of brominating oxidants in allergen challenged subjects leading to post 
translational modification of proteins forming the stable molecular markers BrTyr and Br3Tyr. 
Furthermore, BrTyr levels are elevated (16) in plasma, airway lining fluid, and urine in p atients 
with severe asthma.  Recent studies also demonstrate strong inverse correlations between 
systemic levels of plasma BrTyr and multiple measures of airflow limitation (Fig. 1).  
Thus, measurements of BrTyr and Br2Tyr, products specific for eosinophil  peroxidase -catalyzed 
protein oxidation (17,18), can serve as a quantitative measure for assessing the efficacy of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437727] (Omalizumab) effect in patients with AERD. Similarly, since 
enhanced oxidant stress following eosinophil a ctivation syndromes and allergen challenge has 
been observed, a global systemic indicator of oxidant stress, such as urinary isoprostanes, a free 
radical generated product of arachidonic acid (19), may also prove informative as a quantitative 
index with wh ich to monitor efficacy of Xolair (Omalizumab) effect in patients with AERD.  
 

  
 
 7 BACKGROUND  
The initial report of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437728] a century ago, only 3 years after aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437729] (20).  Fatal reactions from aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437730] 1930s (21,22).  However, it 
was not until 1968 that Samter and Beers (23) described a clinical “triad” of nasal polyposis, bronchial 
asthma, and “life threatening reactions to acetylsalicylic acid” as a clinical syndrome.  
 
We now recognize that patients with this condition exhibit an aggressive inflammation of the 
upper and lower airways (24), for which provocation of asthma with/without nasal/ocular 
symptoms after ingestion of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (and other non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs) is a 
marker .  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_437731] -reacting drugs, this subgroup of patients may 
experience refractory rhinosinusitis and asthma – frequently requiring numerous sinus -surgery 
procedures and regular administration of oral steroids.  The syndrome of a spi[INVESTIGATOR_437732] 4 -10% of adult asthmatics (10).  Once aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437733], it is 
present for the rest of the patient’s life.  
 
The term “desensitization” has traditionally been used to describe a procedure that involves 
modification of IgE -mediated (allergic/anaphylactic) potential to a substance – usually a drug 
such as penicillin, via repetitive re -exposure in a graded -dose fashion (25).  Widal managed a 
patient in 1922 (26), with gradually increasing doses of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], suc h that instead of reacting to 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437734] -established provoking dose was administered, this individual was 
able to tolerate aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], given in advancing doses, without adverse reaction.  Zeiss and Lockey 
(27) observed the same phenomenon of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] “desensitization”, and ultimately this procedure 
was utilized to allow individuals with AERD who require aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (or an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -like drug) for 
treatment of arthritis or cardiovascular conditions to safely take aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437735].   
 
The aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437736], in which a state of “tolerance” can be induced and  
maintained, entails administration of incremental oral doses of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437737], until a dosage of 650 mg (2 tablets) of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437738].  
Because aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -provoked reaction may be delayed for 2 -3 hours, the minimum interval between 
doses of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_33930] 3 hours; for this reason, the challenge may span 3 -4 days.  After doses of  
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437739] 8:00 a.m., 11:00 a. m., and 2:[ADDRESS_554730] repeated reactions to the same dose.  
When an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -sensitive individual no longer reacts to this dose, t he aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437740] (shown below) until [ADDRESS_554731] reaction. The sequence of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437741] a general guide.  The 
schedule is modified for each patient ba sed on the reaction(s) to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437742]. The dosage at which each AERD patient will react to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], the number of reactions at 
each dose, and whether reaction occurs at multiple dosage levels are quite variable.  For this r eason, 
the number of challenge doses that will be required, and the duration of the desensitization, cannot be 
predicted a priori . In most cases, the procedure spans 3 -4 days.

Bronchospastic reaction in AERD patients results from enhanced release of leukotrienes 
provoked by [CONTACT_6149][INVESTIGATOR_248] (28), in combination with greater target organ sensitivity to leu kotrienes 
(29).  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -provoked bronchospasm can be lessened by [CONTACT_437807] -leukotriene 
drugs (4); however, the protection is not complete, and the response is heterogeneous (3).  The 
effect of anti -leukotrienes appears to be to shift the dose -response curve to the right, and a 
tendency to transfer aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -provoked reaction to the upper airway (4).  Bronchospasm has also 
been lessened in AERD patients by [CONTACT_094] -treatment with cromolyn (5,6), nedocromil (6), 
salmeterol (7), clemastine (8), and inha led steroid (9). However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_437745] 
“controller” agents, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437746] -threatening 
bronchospasm.  We have recently desensitized a patient who exhibited profound bronchospasm 
(shown in Figure 2) despi[INVESTIGATOR_437747]/taper prior to the procedure, taking 
regular inhaled steroid combined with long acting beta agonist, and montelukast at higher than 
standard dosage (30 mg/day).  This case illustrates the ongoing need for a therapeut ic 
intervention that can reliably block bronchospastic reaction during aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437748]/desensitization.  
 
Because serious bronchospasm may occur at any time during aspi[INVESTIGATOR_199535], this 
procedure needs to be performed in a monitored setting.  At T he Cleveland Clinic Foundation, 
this procedure is performed in our Short -Procedure Unit, where respi[INVESTIGATOR_437749], a one -on-one physician/nurse to patient ratio can be maintained throughout the 
procedure, and emergency -resuscitat ive equipment and trained personnel are readily available.  
We also stipulate that aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -sensitive patients undergo this procedure at a time when their 
asthma is well controlled.  In order to proceed, FEV1 should be greater than 70% predicted (or 
prior b est measurement).  In order to ensure the reliability of our findings, we also will be 
including two placebo doses at the start of day#1, so that individuals whose lung function 
declines due to unstable asthma (or situational factors) can be identified.  S uch reactions would 
obfuscate interpretation of our findings if they were misclassified as bonafide reactions to 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  
 
Two decades ago, the first double -blind, placebo -controlled, crossover study of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437750] r eported (30).  In two -thirds of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -sensitive subjects, 
statistically significant improvement was observed in nasal/sinus symptoms and medication 
reliance for rhinosinusitis in association with regular administration of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437751] s achieved.  Sweet, et al. (31) described results of a long -term assessment of 
the therapeutic utility of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437710] [ADDRESS_554732] with recalcitrant asthma ; in one half of [ADDRESS_554733] patients in a large 
European study (32), asthma was severe and steroid -dependent.  For this reason, such patients 
also may be viewed as candidates for aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437752].  
 
In summary, AERD may appear only after year s of progression of rhinosinusitis and asthma.  
The aggressive upper and lower airways inflammation characteristic of this condition continues 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_437753] -like drugs.  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437754] 
a means to re duce symptoms and medication reliance.  This procedure can be justified based on 
the substantial improvement in health service utilization and quality -of-life that will result.  
Following the procedure, patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_437755]/sinus symptoms, albeit at lower doses and reduced frequency of administration.  The 
economic savings associated with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -desensitization treatment accrue from reduced rates of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_437756] -surgery procedures; re -operative intervention can be reduced from an 
average of once every three years (before desensitization) to once every ten years during long -
term daily treatment with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].   An intervention that would make aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437757], by [CONTACT_437808] (for severe bronchospasm) associated with this procedure, has 
substantial potential for improving health care outcomes and quality of life for AERD patients.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN  
 Design:   
The study will be a randomized double -blind placebo -controlled evaluation of the impact of 
Omali zumab on aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437715].  Patients who are candidates for 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437764], and will 
receive either Omalizumab or identical placebo . Subjects will receive 4 injections every 4 
weeks or 8 injections every 2 weeks (+/ - 7 days) for approximately 16 weeks (based on serum       
 
 
 
     
  
 
 11 IgE and body weight according to Xolair label), after which aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437765].  
 
Vital signs (including pulse oximetry) wi ll be measured and recorded at baseline, prior to each 
dose of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], and prn symptoms.  Serial spi[INVESTIGATOR_437766], every hour during the course of the desensitization procedure, and prn respi[INVESTIGATOR_037]. The complet ion time for each challenge day will vary based upon the timing of 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -provoked reaction and response to treatment; however, we anticipate that on most days 
the challenge will conclude between 5:00 and 6:[ADDRESS_554735] patients (N = 21) will be randomized  2:[ADDRESS_554736] occurs due to heightened leukotriene release 
and greater end -organ responsiveness to leukotrienes (28,29).  Omalizumab administration for 
16 weeks is associated with a s ignificant decline in eosinophils in epi[INVESTIGATOR_437767] 
(13).  We hypothesize that a substantial and clinically significant reduction in the capacity for 
leukotriene release will be promoted by [CONTACT_437809], and that this will significantly reduce severity of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -provoked 
bronchospastic reaction.  We will measure serum and urinary markers of eosinophil activation,

Patients will be randomized 2:[ADDRESS_554742], including but not 
limited to agents to treat a sthma and rhinosinusitis. Efforts will be made to maintain medications 
at constant doses during participation, and to avoid adding additional medications or modifying 
dose of current medications -- unless required for exacerbation of asthma and/or rhinosin usitis. 
Subjects will diligently avoid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437774] -like drugs prior to desensitization.  
INTERRUPTION OR DISCONTINUATION OF TREATMENT  
Every patient has the right to discontinue study participation at any time, and patients may be 
discontinued from t he study for any reason beneficial to his/her wellbeing. All data generated up 
to the time of discontinuation from the study will be analyzed and the reason(s) for 
discontinuation will be recorded.  
TREATMENT COMPLIANCE  
In order to continue participation i n the study, patients must be adherent with the recommended 
schedule for administration of drug/placebo for 16 weeks.  Also, patients should schedule aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437775] 2 -3 week period following the final scheduled dose of drug/placebo.

is bronchospastic reaction in duced by [CONTACT_6149][INVESTIGATOR_248].  This will be quantified by [CONTACT_437815][INVESTIGATOR_31737] (FEV 1) values from baseline to after aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -provoked 
reaction.  
 
Secondary Aim  
We will assess whether Omalizumab attenuates aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437786], and by [CONTACT_437816]1 ≥ 20% and ≥ 40%, respectively, in 
Omalizumab and placebo groups.  
 
We also will measure markers of eosinophil activation and urinary LTE4, to confirm our 
hypothesis that aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -provoked reaction will be significantly attenuated by [CONTACT_437817] [ADDRESS_554748] subjects at baseline, and that a reduction will be 
observed in Omalizumab -treated patients in the baseline sample at time o f desensitization 
compared with placebo.  This may also be observed in the level of urinary LTE4 compared 
with initial sample at study entry, and compared with placebo -treated subjects -- among whom 
this should be relatively unchanged.  If a dramatic decli ne in eosinophils (and consequent 
reduction in potential for leukotriene release) is achieved with Omalizumab treatment for 16 
weeks (13), we would expect this to also be reflected in significant reduction in the rise in 
urinary markers of eosinophil activ ation and oxidant stress (BrTyr and F2IsoP), as well as 
LTE4, with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -induced respi[INVESTIGATOR_437787]. At the one month follow up visit, we expect that we will find a reduction 
in systemic markers of eosinophil activation in placebo -treated patients compared with baseline 
sample obtained at study entry in association with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437752], but that 
this will be less marked compared with those randomized to prior treatment with Omali zumab.  
 
Markers of eosinophil activation and urinary LTE4 will be measured as previously reported (14, 
18, 19, 34).  
 
3.[ADDRESS_554749] of monitoring and recording all adverse events, including serious 
adverse events, a s described in the study manual.  
 
An adverse event is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition occurring after starting 
study drug (or therapy). Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study treatment are 
only considered adverse event s if they worsen after starting study treatment.  
A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition which: 1. is fatal 
or life -threatening, 2. required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 3. results in persistent or significant 
disability/incapacit y, 4. is medically significant, in that it may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.   
  
 
 18 4 DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL METHODS   
Safety Assessment:    
Investigators will enter i nformation required by [CONTACT_437818] (CRFs). 
Non-obvious errors or omissions will be entered on Data Query Forms, which will be returned to 
the investigational site for resolution. The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the 
frequency of adverse events, which includes all serious adverse events. Adverse events will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_437819], having an adverse event in each body system , and having each 
individual adverse event.  Any other information collected (e.g. severity or relatedness to study 
medication) will be listed as appropriate.  
 
Statistical Methods:  
Unequal -variances t -tests will be used to compare the change in FEV 1 (and t he aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437788]) between subjects who receive placebo and those who receive Omalizumab.  If distributional 
assumptions are not met, the nonparametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum test will be used.  Pearson’s chi -
square test will be used to test if the prop ortion of subjects with a decline in FEV 1 > 20% is 
significantly different between subjects who receive placebo and those who receive Omalizumab.  
A significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_554750] atistician will further evaluate 
the sample size.  
 
Sample Size Calculation:   
No previous studies have been done to examine the impact of Omalizumab in the ASA 
desensitization process.  Stevenson, et.al (1), conducted a study on the impact of Montelukast i n 
inhibiting aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437789].  We believe the standard deviation for the change in 
FEV1 values for both subject groups will be similar in magnitude to those previously observed (1); 
for this reason, we have based our sample calculations o n these estimates.  The standard deviation 
for the change in FEV 1 values is assumed to be equal to 6.7 and 7.8 for the placebo and 
Omalizumab groups, respectively. The minimum mean difference in the change in FEV 1 between 
the two groups that can be detecte d, with randomization proceeding 2:[ADDRESS_554751] patients in each group (assuming an attrition rate of 3 subjects, or 
14-15%), respectively, is 12.8%, with a power of 90%. Secondary outcomes of interest noted ab ove 
will also be examined; however, the proposed enrollment may not entail sufficient power to assess 
these in a definitive fashion.  
The objective of this trial is to study the therapeutic utility of Omalizumab for attenuating aspi[INVESTIGATOR_437790]. Data will be summarized with 
respect to demographic and baseline characteristics and efficacy and safety observations. 
Exploratory analyses will be performed using descriptive statistics.

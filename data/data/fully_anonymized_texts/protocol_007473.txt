Sleep and Breathing in the General Population - Chemical Stimuli  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Date – 02/06/[ADDRESS_159645] of mouth. Additionally, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140652] (PSG) studies at a 
sleep clinic and were diagnosed with CSA. Patients with no record of a previous PSG study or who 
underwent a PSG study earlier than [ADDRESS_159646] recent 
PSG, will also underg o an in -lab PSG study irrespective of the date of the previous PSG study.  Eligibility 
criteria include patients with an apnea –hypopnea index (AHI)≥15 and a central AHI (CAHI)≥5. Patients 
with OSA (AHI≥15) and narrow CO2 reserve (>−2.0  mmHg) will also be el igible due to their increased 
propensity to develop CSA [1]. Participants whose control night study does not meet the above criteria 
will be excluded. Additionally, patients with a history of severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiac, renal, and 
neurologic disease and t hose with co -morbid sleep conditions will be excluded.  
 
Randomization and Study Procedures  
Eligible participants will  sign an informed consent and complet e an in -laboratory night study on 5  mg 
Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_140653] a control night study with no medication. The dose  of Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_140654] 5  mg was selected 
according to current FDA recommendations to avoid adverse effects [ 2]. The order of the night studies 
(Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_140655]) w ill be  randomized according to a randomized crossover study design. The 
randomization sequence f or treatment order w ill be  generated via Microsoft Excel. Participants and la b 
staff performing the night studies will not be blinded to the treatment order. Analysis of physiologic 
parameters and sleep studies scoring w ill be  performed by [CONTACT_140666] d reviewed by [CONTACT_99342][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a co -investigator, all of whom w ill be  blinded to the study treatment arm at the time of 
the scoring, analysis, and review. The study statistician will also be blinded .  
Night studies w ill be  scheduled based on participants’ availability and must  be within 6  months of each 
other. Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_140656] a short elimination half -life, and a washout period for a single 5  mg dose is 
unnecessary. When possible, consecutive night studies w ill be scheduled . Participants w ill be  contact[CONTACT_89725], and their medical records w ill be  reviewed during each sleep study to ensure that no changes 
in medical conditions or medications occurred.  
After the participant consents to take part of the study, the participant wi ll completed the Epworth 
Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) questionnaire, the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] 
(PSQI) questionnaire, and the Berlin questionnaire  which help us to assess their sleep patterns and daily 
functional outcome s.  
 
In-laboratory Night Studies   
As part of standard care, a polysomnography (PSG) is a test conducted record an individual’s sleep study 
along with audio and video recording. A PSG is a test conducted to study sleep and to diagnose a variety 
of sleep dis orders. A PSG is used not only to help diagnose a variety of sleep disorders, but also to learn 
whether adjustments to treatment plans are needed or if current treatment plan is effective. An 
enhanced PSG w ill be  performed during both nights includ ing electrooculography, surface 
electromyography, electrocardiography, and pulse oximetry (Carefusion, SomnoStar z4 Sleep System, 
San Diego, CA, [LOCATION_003]) consistent with the technical criteria of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine 
(AASM) [ 3]. Additionally, a nasal  mask w ill be  connected to an in -line pneumotachometer (Hans 
Rudolph; model 3700A, Shawnee, KS, [LOCATION_003]). An RSS 100HR Research Pneumotach System will acquire 
data (Hans Rudolph) to achieve airflow, pressure, and volume measurements. The end -tidal partial 
pres sure of carbon dioxide (PETCO2) w ill be  measured by [CONTACT_108464] a tube placed in the nasal vestibule 
to a respi[INVESTIGATOR_140657] (CWE, Inc., GEMINI Respi[INVESTIGATOR_140658], Ardmore, PA, [LOCATION_003]). Airflow and 
PETCO2 w ill be  recorded by a PowerLab data acquisition system (AD Instruments, Inc., model 16SP, 
Colorado Springs, CO, [LOCATION_003]). Tidal volume (VT) is derived by [CONTACT_140667], and minute 
ventilation (VE) is calculated by [CONTACT_140668] (FB). Arterial oxygen saturation 
will be monitored by [CONTACT_140669] (Ohmeda Medical Inc., Biox 3740, Laurel, MD, [LOCATION_003]). PSG 
variables, including apnea, arousal, and desaturation indices, w ill all be  calculated during both nights. 
Sleep staging and arousals will be measured and scored acc ording to standard criteria using oximetry, 
EEG, EOG, and EMG and standard PSG methods.  
 
Physiologic parameters   
In addition to PSG, a noninvasive positive air pressure ventilation protocol w ill be  used to calculate the 
CO2 reserve and the controller gain.  The CO2 reserve is defined as the difference between the eupneic 
end-tidal CO2 pressure and the end -tidal CO2 pressure (PETCO2) induced by [CONTACT_140670] a central apnea as defined by [CONTACT_140671]. If we are not able to  acquire a period 
of stable eupneic breathing due to the persistence of spontaneous central events, we will administer a 
40% CO2 gas mixture balanced with nitrogen to stabilize breathing. The combination w ill be 
administered at 5 -min intervals in 0.5 L/min  increments. The volume per unit time of the mixture gas 
required to resolve central events w ill be  determined, and PETCO2 allowed to return to baseline. We 
will perform three [ADDRESS_159647] -mechanical ventilation induced by [CONTACT_140672] -state respi[INVESTIGATOR_140659] -tidal CO2 pressure between the mechanical ventilation and steady -state 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_57774]. In participants administered the gas mixture as described above, the controller gain will not 
be calculated due to the absence of mechanical ventilation in that protocol. Steady -state plant gain is 
calculated from the ratio of end -tidal CO2 to minute ventilation during stable respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. All physiologic 
parameters w ill be  calculated during non -rapid eye movement (non -REM) sleep in both the control and 
the zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_140660].  
During both nights, a supraglottic catheter w ill be  inserted in the pati ent’s nostril to measure epi[INVESTIGATOR_140661]. The epi[INVESTIGATOR_140662]. These instances w ill be  measured for all 
obstructive events followed by [CONTACT_140673][INVESTIGATOR_140663] -REM sleep.  
 
Outcomes   
The primar y endpoint is the frequency of respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -related arousals, or the respi[INVESTIGATOR_140664] 
(R-ArI). R -ArI represents the number per hour of arousals resulting from respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343]. Clinical 
outcomes w ill also compared between the two -night studies an d included the total respi[INVESTIGATOR_140665] (ArI), AHI, and CAHI. The total ArI represents the number per hour of all arousals, whether 
spontaneous or due to a respi[INVESTIGATOR_110636]. Lastly, physiologic outcomes, including the CO2 reserve, 
plant gain, contr oller gain, and arousal threshold, w ill be  calculated  and s leep and desaturation 
parameters will be  reported as well.  
 
Statistical analysis   
A crossover design is used to investigate the potential influence of sequence (the order of medication 
administrat ion) and period (the time of medication administration) on the effects of the two treatments 
(control and Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730]) on the clinical outcomes. The significance level w ill be  set at a p -value equal to or 
less than 0.05. For the primary endpoint and clinical outcomes, the difference between the control night 
and the intervention night w ill be calculated for each participant, and Grubb’s test may be utilized to  
identify outliers (alpha=0.05). Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS, SAS, and R.

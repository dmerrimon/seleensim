 The eff icacy of antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006] (AEDs) in reducing seizures is similar for the most 
common type of seizures (i.e.,  focal  +/- secondary generalized).  Therefore, differential side 
effects play an important role in therapeutic decisions.  In this regard, differ ential cognitive 
effects of AEDs are of particular interest.  The older AEDs are known to produce untoward 
cognitive effects, which are clinically significant in some patients (Meador, 2001a).  The 
cognitive effects of carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] , phenytoin, and valproa te are similar while the effects of 
phenobarbital are worse. Several of the newer AEDs are well tolerated and demonstrate 
fewer adverse cognitive effects compared to placebo  and to older AEDs  (Meador, 20 14a, 
2014b ). 
 
Eslicarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_379736] (ESL) is a new generation AED, which is chemically related to 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_490454] , but is structurally different at the 10,11 -position , which 
results in differences in metabolism . ESL is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_490455].  
Eslicarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] ’s main mechanism is blocka de of voltage -gated sodium chan nels, but it also 
affect s type T calcium channels  (Hebeisen et al., 2011;  Brady et al., 2011).  There have been 
3 phase III clinical trials: (Elger et al., 2009 ; Ben-Menachem et al., 2010 ; Sperling 2015) , all 
with sim ilar design in which ESL was titrated over 2 weeks and then administered for 12 
weeks at 400 mg  (not in one trial) , 800 mg and 1.200 mg once -daily. ESL demonstrated good 
efficacy in adjunctive therapy for partial seizures with and wit hout secondary general ization. 
However, ESL’s cognitive effects in relation to the  established AEDs are unknown.  
 
Only one study has formally assessed the cognitive effects of ESL (Milovan  et al, 
2010).  This investigation consisted of two single -blind parallel -group studies. I n the first study, 
a single dose of 900mg of either ESL or Oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. This was followed by [CONTACT_490485], then one week of ESL 800mg daily or Oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 300mg bid, then one week of 
ESL 1200mg daily or Oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 600mg bid. Cognitive testing  was conducted pre and [ADDRESS_630617] dose at the end of each week.  The total n = 56 
healthy subjects with ESL (n=26) and Oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (n=30). The overall treatment -emergent 
adverse effects (especially CNS related) were gre ater for Oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  At the top doses, 
Oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_238283] 83% of patients reporting adverse events compared to 30% for ESL; the 
CNS adverse reports  for asthenia, dizziness, somnolence and blurred vision were greater for 
Oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  In contrast, differ ences between ESL and Oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_490456]. This disparity may be related to weaknesses in the study 
design. Weaknesses included small sample size, short duration of therapy, and lack of control 
for repeated testing (placebo tes ted only after the first week). The sample size was 56 (26 
ESL; 30 oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) which may be too small to detect differences in a parallel design 
study; the sample size was not determined by [CONTACT_42371]. In addition, primary 
comparisons were for each AED to the predose in the first single dose phase “or” to the 
placebo phase. Direct comparisons between AEDs were done as secondary analyses.  
Further , the testing was conducted one hour after the morning  dose of the two AEDs  (e.g., 
ESL 1200mg and  Oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 600mg) , even though ESL would be more likely to be given 
qHS in the real world. This biased against ESL. Thus, this investigation does not adequately 
assess the cognitive effects of ESL. 
 
The present study will investigate the cognitive and behavioral effects of ESL 
 
 
[ADDRESS_630618] of changes in seizure frequency on cognitive function. In addition, 
examining AED cognitive effects in healthy subjects allows extrapolation of the results to other 
patient populations treated with AEDs (e.g., psychiatric and pain disorders).  
 
 
II. STUDY QUESTION  
 
 What are the cognitive and behavioral effects of ESL compared to Carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_490457]?  
 
III. STUDY OBJECTIVE  
 
 The objective of this study is to determine whether there are any differences in the

computer mouse while simultaneously monitoring and responding each time a number from a 
series of sequentially presented random numbers (ie, 1 to 99) is presented which corresponds 
to specific criteria (ie, between 45 and 55). The duration of instructions and testing is 
approximately [ADDRESS_630637] portion, the level of difficulty increases by [CONTACT_490488]. There are 8 levels of difficulty.  
Results are r eported for each of 8 levels (X 15 second  each)  of increasing difficulty as follows:

 The primary measure for this test is a Z score averaging Z scores for (% time in  box) + 
(Correct RT) + ( # Correct – Errors).  
 
1g. One- and two -back continuous performance test : 
As a measure of working memory and sustained attention, subjects are presented a series of 
shapes of different colors in a sequence on the computer screen. Sub jects are required to 
press the spacebar upon seeing the target (eg, blue square), but only when a matching 
stimulus (eg, blue square) appears 1 position before (ie, one -back) or 2 positions before (ie, 
two-back). The duration of instructions and testing i s approximately [ADDRESS_630638] responses (yes/no) are given for the following sequence of stimuli:

Results are reported as follows:  
 Correct hits (delayed)  
 Correct passes (delayed)  
 Total C orrect responses – This is a primary measure for Z score.  
 
2. Components for non -computerized cognitive and behavioral assessments : 
The non -computerized cognitive and behavioral battery performance  measures consist of 
MCG paragraph memory, symbol digit mod alities test, Stroop test, and POMS . A detailed 
description of each of these follows.  
 
2a. Peabody pi[INVESTIGATOR_343823] : 
At Screening, the PPVT (third edition) will be u sed to assess IQ at enrol lment. The PPVT is 
an individually -administered test of receptive vocabulary (of standard English) for children and 
adults from 2.[ADDRESS_630641] that is 
presented orally by [CONTACT_4921] ( Dunn and Dunn, 1997 ). 
This is screening measure and is not used in analyses.  
 
2b. MCG paragraph memory : 
A MCG paragraph memory test includes a matched set of short stories that were pre viously 
developed and have been shown to be sensitive to the side effects of anticonvulsants 
(Meador et al, 1993 ). On each test day, the subjects will be read 1 of the short stories. Free 
immediate and delayed (15 -minute) recall will be obtained.  
The prima ry measure for Z score is the % correct for delayed recall.  
 
2c. Symbol digit modalities test : 
The SDMT is a measure of cognitive processing involving coding which is sensitive to drug 
effects. This is a complex graphomotor transcription task that requires  the subject to 
transcribe symbols to numbers as quickly as possible employing a combination of direct visual 
identification and/or short -term memorization. Symbols with empty squares are presented, 
and the subject’s task is to fill in the corresponding nu mber as quickly as possible during a 90 -
second interval ( Smith, 1973 ). Results are scored based on number correct in [ADDRESS_630642] : 
The Stroop test is a measure of concentration effectiveness and res ponse inhibition. The test 
consists of 3 pages containing 100 items. One page contains the words “RED,” “GREEN,” 
and “BLUE” arranged randomly and printed in black ink. No word follows itself within a 
column. The second page contains “XXXX”s written in red,  green and blue ink. The final page 
consists of word names printed in non -congruent colors. The subject’s task for the first card is 
to read correctly as many of the word names as possible during a 45 -second interval. The 
second task is to read the colors of the printed “X”s as quickly as possible during an additional 
45-second interval. The final task measures an interference effect by [CONTACT_490489], and to instead name [CONTACT_490499], which is 
incongruent with the word name. This test results in 3 scores: word, color, and word/color 
 
 
[ADDRESS_630643] conditions ( Golden , 1978 ). 
The primary measure for Z score is the total # correct across all 3 conditions.  
 
2e. Profile of Mood States : 
The POMS is a checklist  of 65 adjectives describing mood states  (Lorr et al, [ADDRESS_630644] week on a 5 -point scale from “not at 
all” to “extremely.” The POMS is scored for 6 scales (fatigue, vigor, depression -dejection, 
anger -hostility, tension -anxiety, and confusion -bewilderment). All scales but the vigor scale 
are scored such that higher scores reflect greater mood disturbance; for the vigor scale, 
higher scores reflect less mood disturbance. The test is scored for each scal e as well as for a 
total mood disturbance score derived from summing all scales (with reversal of the negatively 
scored items on the vigor scale). The POMS has been shown to be sensitive to AEDs in prior 
studies (Meador et al, 2014a, 2014b ). 
The Total scor e for POMS is the primary measure for Z score for this measure.  
 
2f. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
Suicidality will be assessed by [CONTACT_207276] C -SSRS (Columbia 
University Medical Center, 2008). This scale will be use d for screening as well as to assess 
suicidal ideation and behavior that may occur during the study.   
This is a safety measure and is not used in the primary analysis.

least 7 hours of sleep on the evening before the day of cognitive testing. (Note. If the subject 
does not get the required hours of sleep or takes non -approved medication, caffeine, etc. , 
cognitive and behavioral testing will be rescheduled).  
 
 
 
15 For detailed information regarding all of the cognitive tests refer to Section VII . 
 
B. Clinical Safety Measurements  
    
 1. Physical Examinations (Study weeks -1, 0, 6, 10, 16 , & 20) 
     
 A complete phy sical and neurological examination will be performed during pre -
study screening ( visit 1; week -1) and at the completion of the study (visit 6; week 20) 
or study discontinuation. Brief physical examinations will be performed on visits 2, 3, 4, 
& 5 (weeks 0 , 6, 10, & 16). 
 
 A complete physical examination will consist of determinations of sitting blood 
pressure, weight, he art rate, assessment of physical condition (general appearance, 
skin and skin structure, HEENT, abdomen, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
musc uloskeletal, genitourinary and central nervous systems).  Brief physical 
examinations will consist of determinations of sitting blood pressure, weight, heart rate, 
and an assessment of physical condition, as required to determine change from the 
previous v isit, and an assessment of adverse effects focused on skin and neurological 
systems . 
 
 2. Laboratory assessments (Weeks -1, 6, 10 , 14, 18) 
     
  A. Blood and Urine Samples  
 
Blood work assessments will be obtained at visits  1, 6, 16, & 20 . 
 
The hematology parameters to be determined are: RBC count, hemoglobin, 
hematocrit, WBC count, platelet count, cell morphology and complete WBC 
differential count (neutrophils, bands, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and 
basophils).  
 
The chemistry parameters to be dete rmined are: SGOT, SGPT, alkaline 
phosphatase, albumin, total protein, total bilirubin, sodium, potassium, chloride, 
calcium, phosphorous, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid and glucose.  
The total chem panel will be obtained at visits 1 & 6; just SG OT & SGPT will be 
obtained at visits 3 & 5.  
 
Urine Pregnancy tests will  be performed on women of child bearing potential at 
Weeks -1, 10 & 20 (visits 1, 4 & 6 ). 
 
In subjects of Asian descent, blood will be obtained to test for the HLA B*[ADDRESS_630647] for this reason will be replaced by [CONTACT_490494].  
 
Anticonvulsant blood levels will be collected at Weeks 6 and 16  (i.e., visits 3 & 
5).  Carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_490467] e hospi[INVESTIGATOR_490468] 
 
 
[ADDRESS_630648] lab.  Results are to be reviewed and stored by [CONTACT_11339] -blinded 
investigator.  
 
C. Adverse Event Procedures  
 
 An ADVERSE EVENT (AE)  is a noxious and unintended event observed in, or reported 
by, a subject who is participating in (or has participated in) a clinical study and/or has received 
study medication.  The AE may be related temporarily either to immediate or long -term use of 
the d rug; the AE  may not necessarily  be caused by [CONTACT_33641]. Overdose is regarded as an 
adverse event.  Any event meeting these criteria is to be considered an adverse event, 
regardless of whether or not it is considered drug related.  
 
 All adverse events should  be reported on the appropriate Case Report Form; details 
should include the type of event, date of onset, duration, intensity, causality relationship to the 
study drug(s), and outcome.  Wherever possible, a diagnosis  rather than symptom(s) should 
be repor ted. 
 
 “Serious” means an adverse experience that is fatal or life -threatening, is permanently 
disabling, requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or is a congenital anomaly, cancer or 
overdose.  
 
 If any medically serious  adverse event occurs (SAE),  the study medication may be 
discontinued and the patient treated at the discretion of the physician investigator.  
 
 ANY MEDICALLY SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REQUIRES IMMEDIATE 
NOTIFICATION OF THE FDA BY [CONTACT_30108].  
  
 Any serious  adverse event that occur s up to two weeks following  study participation 
must also be reported.  
 
 Specific procedures for Double -Blind Studies  
 
 Site personnel not involved in direct care of study subjects will generate a 
randomization code.  In an acute medical emergency, the ran domization code may be broken 
if this is considered essential for subject management.  For this purpose the sealed 
randomization code will be provided to the investigator by [CONTACT_159439]. If the code is 
broken, a record of the date, time and reason mu st be put into writing and sent to Sunovion .  
This letter will become part of the permanent study record.  
 
 All adverse events should be recorded on the appropriate Case Report Forms (CRF’s) 
including date of onset and cessation, intensity and relationship  to study drug.  The action 
taken and clinical outcome of the adverse event will also be recorded.   
 
 The investigator will report all serious  AE's to the FDA and to Sunovion  without delay.  
 
 
 
17  D. Medication Compliance Assessment  
   
 Compliance is to be jud ged by [CONTACT_490495] -
blinded observer’s inspection of medication returned and recording missed doses on the 
appropriate CRF. Repeated noncompliance, or the missing of all scheduled doses of 
medication for three (3) consecutive days (72 -hour period) would be cause for removing the 
subject from the study.  Subjects should take all doses for [ADDRESS_630649] in this study if:  
    
a. Any clinically significant adverse experiences are observed.  
 
b. The subject is grossly noncompliant.  
 
c. The subject’s health would be jeopardized by [CONTACT_295484].  
 
d. Consent is withdrawn.  Otherwise, subjects will be encouraged to complete th e 
study, although they may withdraw at any time without prejudice.  
 
3. If subject cannot tolerate the 8 00 mg/d ay dose of ESL or Carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] , the 
dose may be reduced to 4 00 mg/day if the subject and physician deem 
appropriate. An attempt to increase the d ose a week later can be made. If they 
choose not to reduce the dose or if the sub ject cannot tolerate at least 4 00 
mg/day, then the subject will be discontinued.  
 
4. Subject replacement.  
 
 Subjects who are dropped from the study prior to completion of all cognitive 
testing will not be replaced.  
 
5. Follow -up of discontinued patients  
 
 Subjects who receive study drug and are discontinued from the study will have 
all safety assessments completed, including a complete physical examination 
and laboratory evalua tion including chemistry, hematology with differential, 
urinalysis and urine pregnancy test as required at study termination.  This 
testing should be done as soon as possible.  Medical follow -up of any severe 
adverse events or clinically significant abnorm al laboratory values will continue 
until the abnormality resolves, and adequate medical explanation is apparent.  
 
 
18 Such data will be provided to Sunovion . 
 
 
X. STATISTICAL EVALUATION  
 
A. Sample Size  
 
Estimations based on an overall composite score (sustaine d attention and memory 
[SAM] + neuropsychological) for carba mazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] -levetiracetam (Meador et al, 2007) would  
predict that with a sample size of 30 subjects in a 2 -period crossover study, the probability is 
90% that the study will detect a treatment differ ence at a 2 -sided 0.01 significance level, if the 
true difference between the treatments is 0.370 units. This is based on the assumption that 
the SD of the difference in the response variables is 0.490. Given an estimated dropout of 
30% to 40%, the planned  sample size needed to enroll is 40 to 45 subjects.  
The SDMT is a neuropsychological measure that has been sensitive to AED effects in 
multiple studies. Based on the SDMT for carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_490469]. nondrug in the carba mazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] -
levetiracetam  study, a total of 31  subjects will need to complete the 2 -period crossover study. 
The probability is 90% that the study will detect a treatment difference at a [ADDRESS_630650] deviation of the difference in the response variables is 
5.100. Given an estimated dropout of 30% to 40%, the study would need to enroll between [ADDRESS_630651] deviation (SD), median, minimum, and  maximum.  Unless otherwise 
specified, b aseline neuropsychological data will be based on the Visit 2 assessments.  
 
The primary outcome (pharmacodynamic)  variabl e will be analyzed as the within 
subject difference between drugs in the  overall neuropsychological composite Z-score for 
CBZ vs . ESL comparing between end of  Maintenance Period scores for each drug 
(ie,Treatment  Period 1 to Treatment Period 2 ). The overal l composite Z-score will  be 
computed for each condition from  the individual cognitive test scores from the computerized 
tests and  non-computerized neuropsychological tests (including the behavioral 
questionnaires) after  transformation to Z -scores . The Z -score will be calculated using the 
values (mean and SD) from the average of the scores from the 3 nondrug conditions  
(Baseline, first Washout Period, and second Washout Period).  
 
The primary analysis will compare the composite Z score s for ESL to Carbamazepi [INVESTIGATOR_050] 
 
 
[ADDRESS_630652] at the end of the Treatment Maintenance Periods. Since the analysis is 
based on an overall composite score, no correction for multiple comparisons is necessary.  
The use of composit e Z-scores avoids Type II error.  
 
 Secondary analyses wi ll be conducted to compare the two AEDs states to the n on-drug 
average from Visits 2, 4 & 6 . The initial cognitive assessment (i.e., Visit #1) is given to reduce 
practice effects and will not be used in the statistical analyses.  Secondary analyses will als o 
be conducted comparing the 2 drug states to each other and the non -drug state for the 
individual neuropsychological variables.  
 
 Summary statistics will be calculated by [CONTACT_490496][INVESTIGATOR_490470]  (ABLs).  Additional analy ses of data will be performed which take the ABLs into 
account.  Linear correlations of plasma concentrations and the overall  composite and 
individual score variables will be plotted with a fitted regression line  superimposed for each 
drug condition.  
 
 The incidences of all adverse events reported during the trial will be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_490497].  The other safety variables, which include changes in 
hematology, clinical chemistry, and  urinalysis para meters, and vital sign s will be analyzed  
descriptively. The actual measurement and its change from Baseline will be presented by [CONTACT_490498]. In addition, shift tables may be used to evaluate the number and  
percentage of subjects having a different post -Baseline status when compa red with their 
Baseline  status.  
   
C. Interim Analysis  
 
No interim analyses are planned.  
 
D. Definition of Evaluable Subjects  
  
 Any subject who ingested one or more doses of blinded study medication and provided 
follow -up information will be evaluable for  the analysis of the safety data. The primary analysis 
will include subjects who complete all visits for the primary variable in both periods and who 
did not have any important deviations, which may have an impact on cognitive function. 
Subjects who premat urely discontinue the study will be evaluated based on the data collected 
at each visit attended. Any subject who is evaluable for the safety analysis who also has 
baseline and end of drug period cognitive/behavioral data available for each of the two drug  
periods w ill be evaluable for the intent -to-treat analysis of the parameters of interest. Any 
subject evaluable for the intent -to-treat analysis will be evaluable for the per -protocol analysis 
of the parameters of interest provided that the subject was co mpliant with the protocol with 
regard to the study medication regimen, use of concomitant medications, sleep requirements 
prior to cognitive testing, alcohol consumption, caffeine consumption, and use of OTC 
medications prior to cognitive testing.  All data  will be used to their maximum possible extent, 
but without any imputations for missing data for any parameter.

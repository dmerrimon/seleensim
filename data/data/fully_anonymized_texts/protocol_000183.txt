Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
 
 
In light of the discouraging re
sults with conventional chemotherapy, high dose chemotherapy 
with autologous HSCT has been explored as an alternative approach in patients with relapsed 
follicular NHL.  Several studies have shown improved disease
-
free survival (DFS) with 5 year 
survival r
ates ranging from 40%
-
63%
[ADDRESS_412590]
 
 
High dose chemoradiotherapy with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell/bone marrow 
transplantation has also been offered to patients with recurrent follicular NHL with the goal of 
harnessing
 
a graft

versus
-
lymphoma effect and to circumvent the tumor cell contamination 
associated with autologous hematopoietic stem cell harvests
[ADDRESS_412591] (n=176), purged autologous HSCT (n=131) or 
unpurged autologous HSCT (n=597).  The risk for relapse was 54% lower in the allogeneic 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (
p
<.001) and 26% lower in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_334163] (
p
=.04) than in 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_334164]
[ADDRESS_412592] 
(
p
<.001), which resulted in comparable 5
-
year probabi
lities of overall survival (52% after 
allogeneic, 62% after purged autologous, 55% after unpurged autologous).  The 5

year 
probabilities for DFS were 45%, 39% and 31%, respectively.

[ADDRESS_412594] promising data employing non
-
myeloablative allogeneic (NMA) HSCT in 
relapsed follicul
ar NHL patients was
 
initially
 
reported by [CONTACT_941] M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
12
.  
Twenty patients with indolent NHL received a conditioning regimen of fludarabine and 
cyclophosphamide 
+
 
rituximab.  Tacrolimus and methotrexate were given for graft
-
versus
-
host 
di
sease (GVHD) prophylaxis.  The median age was 51 years old (range 31
-
68) and all patients 
had advanced recurrent disease or were previously treated.  The number of prior chemotherapy 
regimens ranged from 1
-
5 (median, 2).  All had received salvage chemother
apy and had stable or 
responding disease.  All patients achieved engraftment of donor cells with the median percentage 
of donor cells at one month being 80% (range, 10%
-
100%).  These results were recently updated 
with a total accrual of [ADDRESS_412595]. 
 
The incidence of 
grade 2
-
4 acute GVHD was 11% and extensive cGVHD was 36%. 
 
With a median follow
-
up of 
60
 
months
(range 19
-
94 months)
, the 
five
 
year 
OS and PFS were
 
85% and 83%,
 
respectively
13
. 
 
 
The EBMT described the use 
of reduced
-
intensity conditioning for 188 patients with low
-
grade 
lymphoma including 52 patients with follicular and small lymphocytic NHL
14
.  The median age 
of the low
-
grade NHL patients was 46 (range, 27
-
65).  The median number of prior 
chemotherapy regim
ens was three (range, 1
-
5) and 29% had previously received an autologous 
HSCT.  Forty
-
four patients (85%) demonstrated chemosensitive disease at the time of transplant.  
Most patients received a fludarabine
-
based preparative regimen with 10% of patients re
ceiving 
BEAM (BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan), a myeloablative regimen.  Of the low
-
grade 
NHL patients, the two year PFS and OS was 54% and 65% respectively with a 21% progression 
rate.  Treatment
-
related mortality was 31%, which was considerably h
igher than the previously 
mentioned M.D. Anderson study.  The use of a more intensive conditioning regimen may have 
contributed to toxicity. 
 
 
Investigators from Seattle reported the results of 45 patients with relapsed FL who received a 
NMA regimen with f
ludarabine and low dose TBI

.  Twenty

two patients received G

recipi[INVESTIGATOR_334165] (URD) grafts.  With a median follow
-
up of 24 months, the PFS was 
51%
 
and the OS was 58% with a relapse rate of 15%.  Donor type did not significantly affect 
PFS and OS.  The cumulative probabilities of acute grades II

60%, 18%, and 51%, respectively.  The [LOCATION_008] Collaborative Group 
reported the 
outcomes of [ADDRESS_412596] grafts 
were conditioned with a regimen of alemtuzumab, fludarabine and melphalan
16
.  For the FL 
patients, the three year PFS and OS were 65% and 73%, respectively

Rituximab 
 
 
Rituximab Background
 
Rituximab is a genetically engineered, chimeric, murine/human monoclonal antibody directed 
against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and mali
gnant pre
-
B and mature B 
cells.  The antibody is an IgG
1
 
κ immunoglobulin containing murine light
-
and heavy
-
chain 
variable region sequences and human constant region sequences.  Rituximab is composed of two 
heavy chains of 451 amino acids and two light cha
ins of 213 amino acids (based on cDNA 
analaysis) and has an approximate molecular mass of 145 kD.  Rituximab has a binding affinity 
for the CD20 antigen of ~8.0 nM.
 
 
Rituximab Pharmacokinetics
 
Some of the earlier phase I and II trials detailing the use of 
rituximab (RTX) measured the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of this chimeric IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody.  The IDEC
-
C2B8 
Study Group measured serum levels of RTX using ELISA (enzyme
-
linked immunosorbent 
assay) in 11 patients with relapsed B cell lymphoma who rec
eived 4 weekly doses of 250 mg/m
2
 
or 375 mg/m
2 
17
.  The PK parameters fluctuated widely even among the patients treated with the 
same dose but the median elimination half life (T ½) was 445 hrs +/
-
 
[ADDRESS_412597] infusion.  The mean 
values of maximum concentration (Cmax) were higher in the 375 mg/m
2
 
group compared to the 
250 mg/m
2
 
group (92 +/134.3 ug/ml and 64 +/
-
 
21 ug/ml, respectively).  When the Cmax, T ½ 
and AUC were compar
ed between the responders and non
-
responders, no significant differences 
were found.
 
 
In contrast, two published series did find an association between serum RTX concentration and 
anti
-
tumor response.  In an analysis from a phase III trial of 166 patients 
with recurrent low
-
grade NHL, a statistically significant correlation was found between the median RTX 
concentration and response for multiple time points during the treatment and follow
-
up
18
.  
Interestingly, the mean serum RTX antibody concentration was al
so inversely correlated with 
tumor bulk and with number of circulating B cells at baseline.   The median serum RTX levels 
were 20.3 ug/ml (range 0.0 
–
 
9.7) and 1.3 ug/ml (range 0.0

Study Treatments
 
 
2.5.1.
 
Body Weight Formulas
 
 
All chemotherapy, 
rituximab and tacrolimus should be dosed based on actual body weight 
(ABW) for patients who weigh 
< 
100
 
to 
120% of their ideal body weight (IBW).  For patients 
who weigh more than 120% of their IBW, dosing should be based on the adjusted ideal body 
weight 
(AIBW).
 
 
Ideal Body Weight (IBW) Formulas:
 
 
Males IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg/inch over 5 feet
 
 
Females IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg/inch over [ADDRESS_412611] 2.3 kg/inch
 
 
Adjusted Ideal Body Weight (AIBW) Formula:
 
 
AIBW = IBW + [(0.25) 
x (ABW 
–
 
IBW)]

HSCT
 
 
Pre
-
HSCT conditioning and hematopoietic stem cell infusion may be administered on an 
outpatient basis.  Patients must comply with all scheduled study visits whether receiving their 
transplants as an inpatient or outpatient.

[ADDRESS_412628] is prescribed.  Major risks 
following transplantation include: 1) 
Infection
 
which can be bacterial, viral, parasitic, or fungal.  
Often, these infections are life threatening, particularly when caused by 
[CONTACT_193935], 
and are associated with high mortality in the transplant population; 2) 
GVHD
, either acute or 
chronic in nature, may occur following allogeneic transplantation.  The degree of GVHD varies 
from mild cutaneous reactions to extensive w
idespread and systemic involvement of skin, liver, 
and gastrointestinal tract.  Probably due to a direct association, the incidence of fatal infection is 
greater in patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_110861]; 3) 
Graft Failure
 
can occur and is associated with a high 
risk of 
mortality; 4) 
End Organ Damage
 
of all or any of the major organs may occur as a result of 
reactions to drugs (e.g., chemotherapy, antibiotics, anti

fungal medications, tacrolimus, 
cyclosporine, etc.), and as a result of destructive processes (e.g., infecti
on, GVHD, etc.), and may 
have a fatal outcome; 5) 
Relapse or progression
 
of lymphoma may occur, especially in patients 
with advanced disease status at time of treatment; 6) 
Unknown toxicities
 
may occur in any

Hematologic 
e
vents
 
 
In clinical trials, Grade 3 and 
4 cytopenias were reported in 48% of patients treated with 
rituximab; these include: lymphopenia (40%), neutropenia (6%), leukopenia (4%), anemia (3%), 
and thrombocytopenia (2%).  The median duration of lymphopenia was 14 days (range, 1 to 588 
days) and of
 
neutropenia was 13 days (range, 2 to 116 days).  A single occurrence of transient 
aplastic anemia (pure red cell aplasia) and two occurrences of hemolytic anemia following 
Rituximab therapy were reported. 
 
 
In addition, there have been a limited number of
 
postmarketing reports of prolonged 
pancytopenia, marrow hypoplasia, and late onset neutropenia.

Hepatitis B 
r
eactivation
 
 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death has been 
reported in some patients with hematologic mali
gnancies treated with rituximab.  The majority of 
patients received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy.  The median time to the 
diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately four months after the initiation of rituximab and 
approximately one month after
 
the last dose.
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].
 
Other 
serious viral i
nfections
 
 
The following additional serious viral infections, either new, reactivated or exacerbated, have 
been identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. 
 
The majority of patients received 
Rituxan in com
bination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. 
 
These viral infections included JC virus (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML]), 
cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West
 
Nile virus, 
and hepatitis C. 
 
In some cases, the viral infections occurred up to one year following 
discontinuation of Rituxan and have resulted in death.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
 
 
PML is a rare and demyelinating disease of the br
ain caused by [CONTACT_334231].  JC virus infection resulting in PML and death has 
been reported rarely in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving rituximab. The majority 
of these patient
s had received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant. 
 
Cases of PML resulting in death have also been reported in

ts with 
SLE
 
had longstanding disease, history of prior immunosuppressant therapy, and were diagnosed 
with PML within [ADDRESS_412629], brain MRI, and lumbar puncture should be 
considered as clinically indicated.  In patients who develop PML, rituximab should be 
discontinued and reductions or discontinuation of any concomitant chemotherapy or 
immun
osuppressive therapy should be considered.

perforation
 
 
Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction and perforation, in some cases leading to death, were 
observed in patients receiving Rituxan in combination with chemotherapy for DLBCL. 
 
In po
st

Complaints of abdominal pain, especially early in the course of 
treatment, should prompt a thorough diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment.
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].
 
Additional 
safety signals
 
 
The following 
serious adverse events have been reported to occur in patients following 
completion of rituximab infusions: arthritis, disorders of blood vessels (vasculitis, serum 
sickness and lupus
-
like syndrome), eye disorders (uveitis and optic neuritis), lung disorde
rs 
including pleuritis and scarring of the lung (bronchiolitis obliterans), that may result in fatal 
outcomes, and fatal cardiac failure.
 
 
See the rituximab Investigator Brochure for additional details regarding safety experience with 
rituximab.
 
 
Hepatitis
 
B reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and death is a risk in patients 
who have ever been infected with the hepatitis B virus and/or are carriers of hepatitis B.  The risk 
of hepatitis B reactivation may continue for several months after
 
rituximab administration.
  
 
 
2.10.4.
 
Tacrolimus
 
 
Tacrolimus is a macrolide antibiotic that is a potent immunosuppressant.  Toxicities include 
predisposition to infection, renal insufficiency, hypertension, cholestatic hepatic toxicity, 
gingival hyperplasia, seizu
res, tremors, hirsutism, anorexia, nausea and possibly later B
-
cell 
lymphomas.  To reduce the risk of toxicity, blood pressure, tacrolimus levels, renal function and 
liver enzymes will be monitored closely and vital signs aggressively maintained at baselin
e.

Definition of Disease Status
 
 
Patients at each data collection period are classified into one of the following stages.  Until 
relapse/progression, al
l disease classifications are relative to the patient’s pre
-
HSCT disease 
status.  Once the patient has relapsed/progressed, these states are relative to the patient’s best 
disease state.  Tests used for evaluation of disease status will be physical examina
tion, laboratory 
testing, bone marrow biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], PET scans, and CT scans of the neck, chest, abdomen 
and pelvis as indicated.

Complete Remission (CR):
 
The designation of CR requires the following (Table 3.1):
 

 
Complete
 
disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease

related 
symptoms if present before therapy.
 

 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357]

residual mass of any size is 
permitted as long as it is PET negative.
 

 
Variably FDG
-
avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown: in patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, all lymph nodes and nodal masses 
must have regre
ssed on CT to normal size (

for nodes > 1.5 cm before therapy).  Previously involved nodes that were 1.[ADDRESS_412632] 
decrease
d to 
≤ 1.0cmin their short axis after treatment.
 

 
The spleen and/or liver, if considered to be enlarged before therapy on the basis of a 
physical examination or CT scan, should not be palpable on physical exam and should be 
considered normal size by [CONTACT_95415], and nodules related to lymphoma should 
disappear.  However, determination of splenic involvement is not always reliable because 
a spleen considered normal in size may still contain lymphoma, whereas an enlarged

atomy, blood volume, the use of hematopoietic growth 
factors, or causes other than lymphoma.
 

 
If bone marrow was involved by [CONTACT_22679], the infiltrate must have 
cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy.  The biopsy sample on which this determina
tion is 
made must be adequate (with a goal of > 20 mm unilateral core).  If the sample is 
indeterminate by [CONTACT_5293], it should be negative by [CONTACT_9064].  A sample

Complete Remission Undetermined (CRu):
 
 

 
The use of the above definition for CR and that below for PR eliminat
es the category of 
CRu.
 
 
Partial Remission (PR):
 
The designation of PR requires all of the following:
 

 
At least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to six of the 
largest dominant nodes or nodal masses.  These nodes or masses sh
ould be selected 
according to all of the following: they should be clearly measurable in at least 2 
perpendicular dimensions; if possible they should be from disparate regions of the body; 
and they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of di
sease whenever these 
sites are involved.
 

 
No increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver or spleen.
 

 
Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by 

 
50% in their SPD or, for single nodules in 
the greatest transverse diameter.
 

 
With the excepti
on of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually 
assessable and no measurable disease should be present.
 

 
Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR if the sample was 
positive before treatment.  However, if posit
ive, the cell type should be specified (eg, 
large
-
cell lymphoma or small neoplastic B cells).  Patients who achieve a CR by [CONTACT_37405], but who have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will be 
considered partial responders.  When the bon
e marrow was involved before therapy and a 
clinical CR was achieved, but with no bone marrow assessment after treatment, patients 
should be considered partial responders.
 

 
No new sites of disease should be observed.
 

 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357]
-
avid lymphoma: for patients
 
with no pretreatment PET scan or if the PET 
scan was positive before therapy, the post

[ADDRESS_412634] regressed by [CONTACT_726] 50% on CT; those with more 
than two res

responders.
 
 
Stable Disease (SD):
 
Stable disease (SD) is defined as the following:
 

 
A patient is considered to have SD when he or she fails to attain the criteria needed for a 
CR
 
or PR, but does not fulfill those for progressive disease (see Relapsed Disease [after 
CR]/Progressive Disease [after PR, SD]).
 

 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20358]
-
avid lymphomas: the PET should be positive at prior sites of disease with 
no new areas of involvement on the post
-
treatment CT or PET.
 

 
Variably FDG
-
avid lymphomas/FDG
-
avidity unknown: for patients without a 
pretreatment PET scan or if the pretreatment PET was negative, there must be no change 
in the size of the previous lesions on the post
-
treatment CT scan.
 
 
Relapse
d Disease (RD, after CR)/ Progressive Disease (PD after PR, SD):
 
Lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is more than 1.5 cm regardless of 
the short axis.  If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1 to 1.5 cm, it should only be considered 
ab
normal if its short axis is more than 1.0.
 
 
Lymph nodes 
≤ 1.0 x ≤ 1.0cm will not be considered 
as abnormal for relapse or progressive disease.
 

 
Appearance of any new lesion more than 1.[ADDRESS_412635] are mostly benign.  Thus, a therapeutic 
decision should not be made solely on the basis of the PET without histologic 
confirmation.
 

 
At least a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously involved nodes or in a 
single involved node, o
r the size of other lesions (e.g, splenic or hepatic nodules).  To be 
considered progressive disease, a lymph node with a diameter of the short axis of less 
than 1.[ADDRESS_412636] increase by 

 
50% and to a size of 1.5 x 1.5 cm or more than 1.5 cm in 
the long ax
is.
 

 
At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously identified node 
more than 1 cmin its short axis
 

 
Lesions should be PET positive if observed in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_20359]
-
avid lymphoma or the 
lesion was PET positive before therapy unless the 
lesion is too small to be detected with 
current PET systems (< 1.[ADDRESS_412637]).  Measurable extranodal disease 
should be assessed in a manner similar to that for nodal disease.  For these 
recommendations, the spleen is considered nodal disea
se.  Disease that is only assessable 
(e.g. pleural effusions, bone lesions) will be recorded as present or absent only, unless, 
while an abnormality is still noted by [CONTACT_20478], it is found

Donor engraftment is defined as >5% donor peripheral blood T cell chimerism by [CONTACT_2006] +[ADDRESS_412641] in the setting of ANC recovery (ANC >500 for 3 consecutive days).  Primary graft 
failure 
is defined as a donor peripheral blood T cell chimerism < 5% at Day +[ADDRESS_412642].  
Methodological requirements for chimerism are outlined in the BMT CTN MOP.
 
 
Secondary Graft Failure is defined as documented engraftment followed by [CONTACT_334232] a

STATISTICAL CONSIDER
ATIONS
 
 
5.1.
 
Study Overview
 
 
The study is a Phase II, single arm, multicenter trial.  It is designed to confirm the efficacy in a 
multi
-
center BMT CTN study o
f a non
-
myeloablative allogeneic conditioning regimen of FCR.  
The study population is patients with relapsed follicular NHL receiving matched related or 
matched unrelated donor transplants.  The sample size is 65 patients for this trial.
 
 
5.1.1.
 
Primary Endpoint
 
 
The primary endpoint for the study is two
-
year progression
-
free survival.  If any therapy not 
specified in the protocol is given to prevent relapse/progression or to induce a response, the 
patient will be considered to have experienced an event for the p
rimary endpoint.  
 
 
Patients who are lost to follow
-
up prior to two years will be censored at the time of the last 
observation, and the progression
-
free survival proportion will be estimated using the Kaplan
-
Meier method, where time
-
to
-
event is measured fr
om enrollment to the minimum of the date of 
death, relapse/progression, last
-
follow
-
up or the two
-
year time point.  
 
 
5.1.2.
 
Accrual
 
 
It is estimated that two years of accrual will be necessary to enroll the targeted sample size.  
Accrual will be reported by [CONTACT_545]
, ethnicity, gender, and age.

Sample Size and Power Considerations
 
 
The sample size is [ADDRESS_412673] is where the PFS 
probability is 73%, which is the targeted 2
-
year PFS probability.  F
or this setting, the confidence 
interval length is 22.9%.  The percentages above and below 73% are meant to represent other 
plausible PFS percentages.  
 
 
The precision of the estimates alternatively could be viewed as a lower bound on the rate of PFS.  
The
 
probability to rule out PFS percentages of a certain size is known as “power
.
”  Table 5.
2b
 
provides the probability (or power) that the lower bound of a 95% two
-
sided confidence interval 
for the PFS probability will be greater than various PFS thresholds 
between 50% and 80%.  In

particular, when the true PFS percentage is 73%, there is 80% power to rule out a PFS 
percentage of < 55%, which is the historical [ADDRESS_412674].  This can equi
valently be viewed as testing the following 
hypothesis: H

: p = 0.55 versus H

: p 
≠ 0.55.  Based on the table below, there is 80% power at

Interim Analysis and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_334184], since the primary endpoint is 2 year PFS.  
Monitoring of a key safety endpoint (
treatment
-
related mortality [TRM]) will be conducted 
monthly, and if ra
tes significantly exceed pre
-
set thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified in order 
that the DSMB can be advised.  Policies and composition of the DSMB are described in the 
BMT CTN's Manual of Procedures.  The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_130015] a trigger for consul
tation 
with the DSMB for additional review, and are not formal “stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]” that would mandate 
automatic closure of study enrollment.
 
 
The rate of TRM will be monitored up to [ADDRESS_412676]
-
transplant.  Monitoring will be 
performed monthly until enrollm
ent is closed.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_334185], 
because of limited experience with this regimen in unrelated donor transplants in particular.  
Fewer
 
than half of the patients in the study are anticipated to receive unrelated donor transplants; 
we base our stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_334186] [ADDRESS_412677] (
SPRT) for a 
censored 
binomial outcome
s
 
will be 
used to monitor TRM as described below.  This sequential testing procedure conserves type I 
error across all of the monitoring looks for TRM, but not across the two cohorts of patients being 
monitored separate
ly.  Thus the type I error for each cohort is approximately 5%, and across both 
cohorts, the study
-
wide type I error is < 10%.  
 
 
The SPRT can be represented graphically.  At each interim analysis, the total number of patients 
enrolled is plotted against t
he total number of patients who have experienced 
TRM
.  The 
continuation region of the SPRT is defined by [CONTACT_334237]
.  Only the upper 
boundary will be used for monitoring the study to protect against high incidences of 
TRM
.  If the 
graph falls 
above the upper boundary, the SPRT rejects the null hypothesis, and concludes that 
the 
TRM
 
rate is higher than predicted by [CONTACT_98395].  
Otherwise, the SPRT continues until enrollment reaches the target goal.

sual measures of performance of an SPRT are the error probabilities

respectively, and the expected sample size

).  Note that since the test uses only the upper boundary, and is trun
cated by a finite 
sample size, the size of the test will be slightly lower than the nominal level.  The tests to be used 
in this protocol were developed from SPRT’s described in more detail in the following 
subsections.

Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
 

 
Progression/ Relapse:
 
To assess the incidence of progression/relapse from day of 
transplant, a cumulative incidence curve will be computed along with a 95% confidence 
interval.  Death prior to
 
progression/relapse will be considered as a competing risk.  
 

 
Acute GVHD:
 
We will assess the incidence of grades II
-
IV and grades III
-
IV acute 
GVHD from day of transplant. 
 
The first day of acute GVHD onset at a certain grade will 
be used to calculate a c
umulative incidence curve for that acute GVHD grade.
 
 
An overall 
cumulative incidence curve will be computed along with a 95% confidence interval at 
[ADDRESS_412682]
-
transplant with death considered as a competing risk.
 

 
First Clinical Onset of Chronic GVHD:
 
T
o assess the incidence and severity of chronic 
GVHD from day of transplant, a cumulative incidence curve will be computed along with 
a 95% confidence interval at two years post
-
transplant. 
 
Death prior to occurrence of 
chronic GVHD will be considered as a 
competing risk.
 

 
Tr

Related Mortality (TRM):
 
TRM is death occurring in patients in continuous 
complete remission.  A cumulative incidence curve will be computed along with a 95% 
confidence interval.  Progression/relapse will be considered as a compet
ing risk.  
 

 
Overall Survival:
 
The survival distribution will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761]
-
Meier curve.  
All patients will be followed for a minimum of two years post
-
transplant for mortality.
 

 
Complete Response/Partial Response
: The frequencies and proportion
s of patients who 
have a CR/PR will be described with confidence intervals at each evaluation time.  
 

 
Incidence of Off Study Therapy
:  The cumulative incidence of use of off
-
study therapy 
will be calculated with 95% confidence intervals at each evaluation 
time.  Death prior to 
use of off
-
study therapy will be considered the competing risk.


 
Quality of Life (SF

Mean QOL scores and confidence intervals will be computed 
at each time point. 
 
A paired student t test will be used to look for differences in
 
mean 
scores between baseline and [ADDRESS_412683] sizes (or z

up scores and dividing by [CONTACT_334239].  Domain scores 
will also be compared between baseline and [ADDRESS_412684] with a Bonferroni 
correction for multiple testing.
  
In addition, mixed models for repeated measur
es data will 
be used to assess whether QOL is changing significantly over each time point among 
survivors.
 

 
Primary and Secondary Graft Failure
:
  
The frequency and proportion of patients 
experiencing primary graft failure by [CONTACT_2006] 30, and the proportion of pa
tients who have 
engrafted who subsequently experience secondary graft failure will be described with 
95% confidence intervals.  
 

 
Correlation of Rituximab levels with development of acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, 
relapse, and immune recovery: 
 
Cox regression mod
els will be fit to each outcome data, 
using time


 
Infections
:
  
Microbiologically documented infections will be reported by [CONTACT_4622], 
date of onset, severity, and resolution, if any.  Thi
s data will be captured via an event

Study Purpose 
 
 
A conventional allogeneic stem cell transplant is where the patient receives high doses of 
chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_334241] a sibling (br
other or sister) 
or unrelated donor who has the same tissue type (genetically matched).  The blood stem cells 
would rescue your bone marrow from the toxic effects of chemotherapy.  However, because the 
stem cells come from a healthy donor, these blood stem
 
cells also replace your immune system 
with the donor’s immune system.  This new immune system also helps fight your lymphoma.  
This effect of an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) is called a graft
-
versus
-
tumor effect.  An 
allogeneic peripheral blood S
CT is when a donor’s stem cells are collected from his/her blood 
and then given to you after you receive chemotherapy, also known as conditioning therapy.  In 
some cases the donor stem cells may be frozen before given to you.  Unfortunately, the

will receive this type of transplant and receive lower doses of chemotherapy compared to the 
doses used in a conventional allo
geneic SCT. 
 
 
The purpose of this study is to determine how effective this non
-
myeloablative transplant will 
control and possibly cure your lymphoma.  
Non
-
myeloablative SCT has been shown to control 
your kind of lymphoma.

How many people will take pa

As many as 65 patients will take part in this study
 
at different hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5535].

Study Plan
 
 
Allogeneic stem cell transplant uses blood stem cells from a brother or sister donor or a matched 
unrelated donor for the t
ransplant.  
 

 
Non
-
myeloablative SCT uses lower amounts of chemotherapy and radiation than what is 
used in standard allogeneic transplants.  
 

 
After the chemotherapy, the stem cells from your donor will be given to you.
 

 
Your immune system will be replaced by 
[CONTACT_183947]’s immune system.
 

 
A non
-
myeloablative SCT depends on the donor’s immune system to destroy the lymphoma 
cells in your body.
 
 
Rituximab Therapy
 
You also will receive 4 doses of a drug called rituximab.  Rituximab is a drug that is not 
considered che
motherapy but is called a monoclonal antibody.  This drug works by [CONTACT_334242] B cells in your body.  B cells are a type of white blood cell in your blood; bone marrow 
and lymph nodes that normally help fight infection.  However, in patients with fo
llicular 
lymphoma, it is the B cells that become malignant (cancerous) and become lymphoma cells.  
Rituximab is already commonly used either alone or together with chemotherapy for patients 
with follicular lymphoma and other types of lymphoma.
 
 
You will ha
ve blood samples drawn to study the actions of Rituximab in your body.  You will 
have 3
-
5 mL (about 1 teaspoon) of blood drawn on 5 different days (total of up to 25 mL). 
 
The 
first sample will be taken before the transplant. 
 
The remaining samples will be
 
taken after the

Procedures and Tests 
 
 
If you agree to participate in this study, your
 
transplant process will include many steps to:
 

 
Evaluate your health.
 

 
Determine if you have a matched brother or sister donor.
 

 
Prepare your body for a stem cell transplant.
 

 
Receive your stem cell transplant.
 

 
Help your body recover after transplant.
 

 
Measure
 
your health and well being over 
two 
years after your transplant.
 

 
Measure your quality of life using surveys before your transplant and two years after your 
transplant.
 
 
If you have a matched brother or sister donor, they will also have a health evaluation
, their cells 
collected for transplant and sign a consent for the study.
 
 
If your donor is an unrelated donor, that person will also have the same health evaluation as 
mentioned above with a sibling donor. 
 
 
If you have a genetically (HLA) matched brother 
or sister or a matched unrelated donor, you will 
have a 
non
-
myeloablative allogeneic SCT
.  Your brother or sister or unrelated donor must be 
willing and able to donate blood stem cells for your transplant.  
 
 
You will start the 
conditioning regimen 
also kn
own as the 
preparative
 
regimen
.  This is done 
to prepare your body for transplant.  The schedule of the preparative regimen is provided in 
Table 1 if your donor is related to you or in Table 2 if your donor is unrelated to you.
 
 
Your doctor will use a comb
ination of three drugs given through your veins:
 

 
Rituximab
 
–
 
to lower the number of lymphoma cells, and
 

 
Cyclophosphamide 
–
 
also to lower the number of lymphoma cells and lower the chance of 
donor stem cell rejection, and
 

 
Fludarabine
 
–
 
to lower the chance o
f donor stem cell rejection.
 
 
The purpose of using these drugs with chemotherapy is to weaken your immune system and lower 
the chance that your body will reject the donated stem cells and to reduce the amount of lymphoma 
in your body.
 
 
You will receive two
 
more drugs during this process to lower the chance of rejecting the donor cells 
and to lower the chance of developi[INVESTIGATOR_334199]

Your risk of infection is also increased when undergoing a stem cell transplant.  This is due to 
the chemotherapy that weakens your immune system.  Potential infection can be caused by [CONTACT_5640] 
a bacteria, virus o
r a fungal organism.  Your doctors will monitor you closely for any sign of 
infection, especially fevers. 
 
 
There is a risk tha
t
 
your donor’s 
stem cells may not grow after being given to you.  This is called 
graft failure.  
If graft failure occurs, this ma
y result in low blood counts for a long period of time.  
 
 
Graft failure can be fatal unless you have a second transplant.

Common side effects associated with rituxim
ab include a reaction such as fevers chills or shortness 
of breath during the actual infusion of the drug.  A much less common side effect can be a severe 
allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, which could cause severe shortness of breath, low blood 
pressur
e or tightness in your throat.  Rituximab can also temporarily cause a low white blood cell 
count and/or weaken your immune system for up to several months after your last dose of 
rituximab, which may increase your risk of infection during that time period
.  
 
 
Cyclophosphamide
 
(Cytoxan)
: This is a common medication used to treat cancer.  This 
medication kills cancer cells by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_334205].  Cyclophosphamide may cause you 
to have
 
diarrhea (loose stools), nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), vo
miting (throwing up)
, 
short
-
term hair loss, short
-
term bladder problems, and, at times, bleeding from the bladder (blood 
in your urine).  A few patients may have bladder damage and bleeding for a longer time.  You 
may be given large amounts of intravenous 
fluids through your central line to protect your 
bladder. 
 
The central line is placed just prior to receiving the cyclophosphamide (within a few 
days of the first dose).  
A bladder catheter (thin plastic tube) may be inserted into your bladder, if 
your phy
sician thinks that it can help you.  C
yclophosphamide slows the making of new blood 
cells.  This causes a risk of infection and/or severe bleeding until the transplanted donor cells 
begin to work in you.  You will get blood transfusions as needed.  Cycloph
osphamide also 
lowers your immune (defense) system and as a result you may have more infections.  In a small 
number of patients, cyclophosphamide can damage the heart muscle causing the heart not to 
pump as well (heart failure).  If this occurs you may hav
e shortness of breath and have fluids 
build
-
up in your body.  
Cyclophosphamide can damage the male (testes) or female (ovaries) sex 
glands.  In men, the number of sperm may be reduced.  Women who are still menstruating may

[ADDRESS_412701] Disease (GVHD)
 
After the graft begins to function, there is a further risk of a reaction of the g
raft against your 
tissues.
  
This reaction is called GVHD and may cause a skin rash, or abnormalities of the liver, 
or stomach.  GVHD may cause nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), vomiting (throwing up), 
lack of appetite, stomach cramps, diarrhea (loose 
stools), and bleeding of the gut.  Chronic 
GVHD may occur later after transplantation and may involve problems with the eyes, mouth, 
lips, throat and liver.  Early (acute) or late (chronic) GVHD may become severe enough to result 
in death.  GVHD is treated
 
with drugs that weaken the immune system, and therefore make you 
more susceptible to infections.
 
 
Risks Related to the Medications Used to Help Prevent GVHD
 
 
NOTE: These drugs also decrease the risk of rejection of the donor cells.
 
 
Tacrolimus: 
This medic
ation is used to try to prevent GVHD.  The immediate side effects you 
may experience include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) or vomiting (throwing up) when 
the medications are given orally.  Other side effects you may experience include high blood 
pr
essure (hypertension), shaking of the hands (tremor), increased hair growth and possibly an 
effect on mental function.  If you experience these effects they generally go away when the dose 
of the medication is decreased.  A few patients have had a seizure 
while taking these 
medications.  You may experience a change of liver or kidney function, in which case the 
medication dose will be reduced or possibly even withheld.  In rare cases, the kidney damage 
caused may require the use of an artificial kidney mach
ine (hemodialysis).
 
 
Some patients given tacrolimus develop diabetes and must take insulin while taking tacrolimus.
 
 
Methotrexate: 
This is also a medication used to try to prevent GVHD.  Methotrexate causes 
damage to cells, and therefore can affect many di
fferent tissues of your body.  It may cause or 
can worsen the mouth sores or inflammation of the mouth which you may have already 
developed from the procedures and medications used to prepare you for the transplant.  It may 
also cause nausea (feeling sick 
to your stomach) and vomiting (throwing up).  Methotrexate may 
slow down the recovery of blood cells after transplantation.  Methotrexate can cause kidney 
damage.  If your kidney is already damaged for other reasons, it can worsen kidney function.  If 
kidn
ey damage does occur, the methotrexate dose may be reduced or the mediation may not be 
given at all.
 
 
Tacrolimus, Methotrexate, and Steroids: 
These medications interfere with the body’s defense 
system (the immune system).  This may cause you to have more i
nfections (especially viral 
infections and pneumonia) for several months after transplant.

Risks and Procedures Related to the Transplant Procedure
 
 
The following risks are not specifically related to any one drug or the transplanted donor cells, but 
they
 
are risks that are a part of the transplant procedure. The following applies to 
ALL
 
patients.
 
 
Venipuncture:  
Although you may require a central venous catheter to donate cells, there may 
be an occasional need to have an intravenous catheter placed in you
r arm(s) or you may need to 
have blood withdrawn from the veins of your arm(s).  Drawing blood from the arm may be 
associated with bleeding into the skin and may very rarely result in an infection.
 
 
Central Venous Catheter: 
A central venous catheter is a f
lexible sterile tube that can be placed 
into a large vein either under the collar bone or in your groin area so that blood can be 
withdrawn.  This tube is placed under local anesthesia and will be placed just prior to receiving 
the cyclophosphamide/rituxim
ab that is given during the cytoreduction process.  Complications 
include blood clots and infection.  Clotting may necessitate removal of the catheter or treatment 
of the clot by [CONTACT_44579] a medicine that dissolves blood clots.  If you develop an infection
, you 
will require treatment with antibiotics.  If the catheter is placed under the collarbone, other 
uncommon side effects may include swelling of the face and arm and/or lung collapse.  If the 
lung collapses, it may be necessary to place a tube between t
he ribs to allow the lung to re
-
expand.
 
 
Bleeding:
 
Platelets help your blood to clot.  Your platelets will be low until the new bone 
marrow grows and, as a result, bleeding may occur.  This can be minor bleeding, such as 
nosebleeds or bruising, but more se
rious, life
-
threatening bleeding in the lungs, brain and other 
organs can occur if the platelet count remains low.  Usually, there is success in preventing major 
bleeding problems with transfusions of platelets.  However, some patients may not respond well
 
to transfused platelets and may be at serious risk for bleeding. 
 
 
Mouth Sores and Diarrhea:
 
The chemotherapy cause
s
 
irritation in the lining of the mouth and 
intestines.  This can result in painful mouth sores and diarrhea and you may need medication to 
help control the pain.  If your mouth sores are severe you may not be able to eat normally until 
the sores are healed.  Mouth sores get better when the white blood count starts to rise.
 
 
Capi[INVESTIGATOR_92306]:
  
This may occur as a result of chemotherapy 
and radiation therapy. 
The blood vessels may become ‘leaky’ and fluid enters the abdominal cavity, lungs, and other 
tissues.  You may gain water weight and not go to the bathroom as often as you normally do. 
Capi[INVESTIGATOR_334206].  You may die if there is continued fluid collection in the lungs. 
 
 
Unexpected Organ Damage and Other Side Effects:
  
Although your major organs function 
well,
 
it is possible you may experi
ence unexpected, life
-
threatening heart, lung, kidney, or liver 
damage as a result of the transplant.  Occasionally, the high doses of chemotherapy cause severe 
lung damage that cannot always be treated. If this happens, you may need to use oxygen or even 
a respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521].  The lung damage can be life threatening.  Rarely, multi
-
organ failure (such as lung 
and kidney failure) may occur, which is often fatal.

Late Effects:
  
You may experience side effects that occur several months to many years after 
your tra
nsplant.  You may experience poor function of the thyroid gland, requiring you to take 
thyroid medication.  It is rare, but your kidneys could be affected, causing anemia or high blood 
pressure.  There is also a risk you may develop a second cancer includi
ng leukemia as a result of 
the chemotherapy,
 
and/or your lymphoma.  If secondary cancers occur they generally do not 
occur until 10 to 15 years after the transplant but can occur sometimes within five years after 
transplant.  The long
-
term effects upon hea
rt, lung, and brain are unknown. 
 
 
Fluid Build
-
up:
 
You will receive intravenous fluids during the transplant process and you may 
have difficulty eliminating this fluid.  Furosemide is a drug that is often given to help eliminate 
this excess fluid.  This dr
ug may cause hearing loss and loss of body chemicals such as 
potassium and sodium.
 
 
Risk to the Unborn
 
 
The treatment that you are undertaking has not been proven to be safe at any stage of pregnancy.  
Therefore, if you are pregnant or nursing, you are not
 
eligible for this study.  Women who have 
the potential of becoming pregnant must use some form of effective birth control.  
 
 
Sterility and Future Childbearing Potential for Men and Women
 
 
Chemotherapy may cause lasting effects on the reproductive potenti
al of both men and women 
treated in this manner.  It should be emphasized that your cancer treatment/therapy may cause 
your menstrual periods to become irregular or cease altogether.  However, this DOES NOT 
MEAN THAT YOU CANNOT BECOME PREGNANT, and you mus
t use birth control.  It is 
important that both men and women use birth control while on this study.
 
 
Risks Related to the Infusion of Peripheral Blood Stem Cells 
 
 
The stem cell infusion is given similar to a blood transfusion.  The infusion of
 
stem cells
 
usually 
has few side effects.  Rarely the infusion may cause a headache, chest pain or trouble breathing, 
a slight fever, or blood in the urine.  
You will be given pre
-
medications just prior to the infusion 
to decrease the risk of a reaction.  Common, les
s serious reactions for patients include mild 
wheezing, mild shortness of breath, back or chest pain or lightheadedness.  In rare instances, a 
severe allergic reaction can occur called anaphylaxis, which could cause a drop in blood pressure 
or extreme diff
iculty in breathing.  You will be monitored very closely.

. It is 
strongly recommended that 
standard venipuncture
 
techniques be used to collect these samples. In 
cases where venipuncture is not indicated, a central line is acceptable.
  
Blood samples should be 
allowed to clot upright at room temperature for 30 minutes.  (If using plain red top vacutainer 
with no clot 
activator, allow the blood to clot at room temperature for 60 minutes).  
Samples 
should be promptly

APPENDIX E
 
 
ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING GUIDELINES
 
 
 
An adverse event (AE) is an unplanned, unwanted event which occurs to a study participant and 
which is possibly related to the use of protocol therapy.  While 
some events may not initially 
appear to be associated with the use of the study treatment, a relationship may not emerge until 
sufficient numbers of reports accumulate from various Transplant Centers.
 
 
It is BMT CTN policy that adverse events must be repor
ted even if the investigator is unsure 
whether a relationship exists between the adverse event and the use of the study treatment.
 
 
ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS
 
 
Adverse Event
 
-
 
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), s
ymptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or 
procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure 
(attribution of definite, probable, possible, unlikely, or unrelated). 
 
 
Life
-
Thre
atening Adverse Event
 
-
 
Any adverse event that places the participant, in view of the 
investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction.
 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
 
-
 
Any adverse event that results in any of the following outcomes: 
death, a life 
threatening adverse event, in
-
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth 
defect.
 
 
Unexpected Adverse Event
 
-
 
Any adverse event, the specificity or se
verity of which is NOT 
listed in the study protocol, product inserts or informed consent document.
 
 
Attribution
 
-
 
The determination of whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or 
procedure.  Attribution categories:
 
 
Definite
 
The adverse e
vent is 
clearly related
 
to the study drug/device/procedure/ 
treatment(s). 
 
 
Probable
 
The adverse event is 
likely related
 
to the study drug/device/procedure/ 
treatment.
 
For BMT CTN studies:  the adverse event is not likely to be caused by [CONTACT_1560]’s unde
rlying medical condition or other concomitant therapy, and the 
nature of the adverse event or the temporal relationship between the onset of 
the adverse event and study drug/device/treatment administration lead the 
investigator to believe that there is a r
easonable chance of causal 
relationship.

Possible
 
The adverse event 
may be related
 
to the study drug/device/procedure/ 
treatment(s).
 
For BMT CTN studies: the adverse event could be attributed to the subject’s 
underlying medical condition or other concomi
tant therapy, but the nature of 
the adverse event or the temporal relationship between the onset of the 
adverse event and study drug/device/treatment administration lead the 
investigator to believe that there could be a causal relationship.
 
 
Unlikely
 
The a
dverse event is 
doubtfully related
 
to the study drug/device/ 
procedure/treatment(s).
 
 
Unrelated
 
The adverse event is 
clearly NOT related
 
to the study drug/device/procedure/ 
treatment(s).
 
For BMT CTN studies:  the adverse event is most plausibly explained b
y the 
subject’s underlying medical condition or other concomitant therapy, or the 
adverse event has no plausible biological relationship to study drug/device 
/treatment. 
 
 
Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events (CTCAE)
 
–
 
a descriptive terminology devel
oped 
by [CONTACT_29630] (NCI) for use in reporting adverse events.  The CTCAE includes 
a grading (severity) scale for each adverse event term.  An appendix for grading BMT
-
related 
complex/ multi
-
component events is included.  A copy of the CT
CAE guidelines is located at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/
.

of the event to the study drug/device/treatment.  All Grade [ADDRESS_412716] 
be reported to the BMT CTN DCC in an expedited manner irrespective of the att
ribution of the 
event to the study drug/device/procedure/treatment.

In general, investigators should report adverse events as diseases or syndromes whenever 
possible, instead of reporting individual component symptoms, signs, laboratory abnormalities, 
and
 
sequelae.
 
 
Expected Adverse Events
 
 
Exhibit

expected
 
adverse event reporting requirements for study centers 
participating in a Phase II or III BMT CTN study.  Adverse events should be reported using 
CTCAE terminology and severity scales.
 
 
All

adverse events will be reported on study forms submitted on a defined 
forms submission 
schedule.  Grade [ADDRESS_412717] develop an interim analysis plan using the CTCAE grading 
scale (or Bearman scale if appropriate
) to monitor protocol
-
specific expected adverse events.  
The plan will be included in the study protocol.
 
 
The Protocol Coordinator and Medical Monitor will review the adverse events monitored for 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_83461] a regular basis to be specified in t
he protocol, but at least monthly. 
 
 
Additionally, the Protocol Coordinator and Medical Monitor will review events reported on the 
protocol
-
specific toxicity form (see below) and the GVHD forms on a regular basis to assess 
whether there are safety concerns
 
that should be referred to the DSMB.  The Medical Monitor 
may seek additional guidance from one of the MD DCC Principal Investigators (PI) in these 
assessments as long as the DCC PI‘s institution is not participating in the protocol under 
consideration.
 
 
Monitoring Adverse Events 
 
 
Unexpected Adverse Events
 
Unexpected adverse events will be reported via a web
-
based AE system.  Protocol Coordinators 
will review daily all submitted unexpected adverse events and forward the information to the 
Medical Monitor 
for review.
 
 
All unexpected adverse events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_334252], or associated with 
the DCC, within 2 business days of receiving the summary of the adverse event from the 
transplant center.  If the Medical Monitor requires additional 
information to make his/her 
assessment, transplant centers will have [ADDRESS_412718] the

ND MANAGEMENT
 
 
Because all or most study participants in BMT CTN trials will be receiving potentially toxic 
preparative therapy, significant regimen
-
related toxicity is anticipated.  Study CRFs are designed 
to capture information on these adverse events.  Likewise, subs
tantial mortality is anticipated and 
will be captured via filing of appropriate CRFs.  All unexpected adverse events must be reported 
for the duration of the studies.
 
 
The Protocol Coordinator will review both expected and unexpected toxicities with the Me
dical 
Monitor on a regular basis.
  
The Medical Monitor may seek guidance from one of the MD DCC 
Principal Investigators (PI) in these assessments as long as the DCC PI ‘s institution is not 
participating in the protocol under consideration.

REGULATORY AND MONITORING
 
 
Study Audit
 
 
To assure compliance with Federal regulatory requirements [CFR 21 parts 50, 54, 56, 312, 314 
and HHS 45 CFR 46] and National Cancer Institute (NCI)/ Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program 
(CTEP) Clinical Trials M
onitoring Branch (CTMB) guidelines for the conduct of clinical trials 
and study data validity, all protocols approved by [CONTACT_12134]/CTEP that have patient enrollment 
through the CTSU are subject to audit.
 
 
Responsibility for assignment of the audit will be determ
ined by [CONTACT_779]’s primary affiliation 
with a Cooperative Group or CTSU. For Group
-
aligned sites, the audit of a patient registered 
through CTSU will become the responsibility of the Group receiving credit for the enrollment. 
For CTSU Independent Clinical 
Research Sites (CICRS), the CTSU will coordinate the entire 
audit process.
 
 
For patients enrolled through the CTSU, you may request the accrual be credited to any Group 
for which you have an affiliation provided that Group has an active clinical trials pro
gram for the 
primary disease type being addressed by [CONTACT_760]. Per capi[INVESTIGATOR_334217], or by [CONTACT_334262].

1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
The annual incidence of SCI in the [LOCATION_002] is about 17,810 new cases; cervical 
lesions resulting in complete or incomplete tetraplegia account for 55% of new cases.1 2 In the 
acute phase after SCI up to 74- 84% of people will experience respi[INVESTIGATOR_312671], atelectasis and ventilatory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation (MV).[ADDRESS_385102] injury (SCI) and is 
associated with poor neurologic recovery, increased length of stay, and increased mortality.[ADDRESS_385103] are tidal volume (Vt) and 
positive end- expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (PEEP).  Vt is the volume of air the ventilator provides with 
each “breath” in volume control modes. PEEP is the alveolar pressure above atmospheric 
pressure  that is applied at the end of expi[INVESTIGATOR_312672].24 
Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39053] (ARDS) Network protocol recommends smaller tidal 
volume ≤6 ml/kg predicted body weight (pbw) and positive end -expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (PEEP) to 
prevent secondary respi[INVESTIGATOR_312673], based 
on robust evidence from multicentre clinical trials.[ADDRESS_385104] been several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) conducted in other diagnoses (non -ARDS 
and non- SCI population) in which Vt of greater than 8- 12 ml/ kg pbw and less than 6- 8 ml/kg pbw 
were compared.17-22 Results from these trials revealed a decreased risk of acute lung injury (ALI) 
and pneumonia in low Vt groups compared to high Vt groups.17-22 
However, current SCI clinical practice guidelines recommend starting Vt of 15 ml/kg pbw 
with an incremental increase in Vt up to 25 ml/kg pbw and weaning off PEEP.4 Unlike the needs 
for MV with pulmonary disease, respi[INVESTIGATOR_312674]. Therefore, bigger 
“breaths” (high Vt) are recommended to prevent atelectasis and improve lung capacity. In 
preparation for ventilator weaning, Vt is further increased. 
4 25 However, in studies comparing 
high vs. low Vt in non- SCI population, low Vt was not associated with a higher risk of 
atelectasis.17 20 21 Importantly, in our cohort study of people with acute SCI, we did not find any 
difference in improvement in breathing capacity or vital capacity with high Vt and moderate Vt MV.
26 Furthermore, emerging evidence in people with and without SCI suggests that low Vt 
leads to improved respi[INVESTIGATOR_195954].17-22 26  27 
The presumed mechanism for worsening morbidity with increased Vt ventilation 
has been called volutrauma- overstretched  alveoli  leading to disruption  of pulmonary  epi[INVESTIGATOR_312675], lung inflammation, hypoxemia, and the release of inflammatory mediators which play a role in the development of pneumonia, lung injury, and sepsis.
28 29 These changes 
result in poor pulmonary outcomes such as the prolonged need for mechanical ventilation, and 
increased risk for pneumonia.15 17- 20 30 In human RCTs with and without ARDS, lower tidal 
volume ventilation resulted in a greater reduction of inflammatory markers, e.g., tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, IL -6 compared to the higher tidal volume group.
15 30-33 
Current evidence in SCI supporting high Vt practice has several limitations.25 34 Current 
guidelines were written based on a small (n=42) retrospective study34 in which vast range of Vts 
of 11.6 to 19.4 ml/kg ideal body weight (IBW) versus 20.3 to 32.2 ml/kg IBW were compared.  
The groups were different at baseli ne, w ith the low Vt group having a lower vitIaRlBcaNpUaMcBityERa:t HSC -MS-21-0222

This was not taken into consideration during the analysis. Further support for high Vt ventilation 
in SCI comes from a small randomized control trial (n=33) in subacute SCI comparing Vts of 10 
and 20 ml/kg  PBW,  which  did not find a difference  in the rate of ventilator -associated pneumonia 
(VAP) and ventilator weaning days between [ADDRESS_385105]:  
• HVt in the ICU setting with increased probability of ventilator associate pneumonia 
(VAP).27 
• HVt in acute  rehab is associated with a higher  risk of pneumonia  and pulmonary  adverse 
event compared to moderate Vt.26 
• Variation in ventilator settings used for patients with acute SCI in acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312676] a rehabilitation facility (Unpublished data).  
• Variation in ventilator settings used in acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312677] (in  press).  
 
This clinically important controversy in acute SCI should be addressed in a large RCT with robust power analysis. However, prior to initiating a full -scale randomized clinical trial, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_312678], randomization, retention, and protocol adherence to demonstrate that 
the methods and procedures can work in a large- scale study. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_312679]. 
 
2. HYPOTHESIS  AND OBJECTIVES  
We propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_312680] 8 -10 ml/kg pbw  and higher Vt  
of 14 -16 ml/kg pbw  in people with acute cervical SCI in an acute  inpatient rehabilitation hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
Our long -term goal is to study optimal ventilator settings and treatment approaches in acute 
SCI to reduce infections and improve lifelong outcomes. 
 
Objectives:  
 
Objective 1: To compare MV outcomes of high vs. low Vt on  the relative risk of pneumonia in 
the acute rehabilitation hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
 
Objective 2: To generate the feasibility data to inform the future RCT design. To achieve 
this objective, we will obtain the following data: a) Recruitment rate : the proportion of eligi ble 
people who provide consent (b) Adherence rate: the proportion of participants in each group who 
receive assigned intervention per protocol; (c) Retention rate : the proportion of participants in 
each group who complete all study procedures prior to discharge from our hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]; d) Missing 
data: Percentage of missing data in each group. 
 
Objective 3: To analyze MV related lung injury inflammatory biomarkers in relation to tidal volume and outcomes.  
 
Hypothesis:  
 
Hypothesis 1 : We hypothesize that Bayesian analysis will indicate a>70% probability of lower 
risk of pneumonia in people with acute cervical SCI receiving lower Vt MV than higher Vt.  
 
Hypothesis 2: We hypothesize that we will be able to recruit at least 80% of eligible people 
each year and among recruited subjects, adherence and retention rate will be 80%, with less 
than 10% missing data on outcome measures.

  IRB APPROVAL DATE:  02/23/2023  
01/11/2023  Page 5 of 15  Hypothesis 3.1: We hypothesize that MV -related lung injury inflammatory biomarkers (IL -1, IL6, 
IL-8, and tissue necrosis factor α levels) in serum and tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_312681]).  
 
Hypothesis 3.2: People with acute cervical SCI receiving MV will have higher inflammatory 
markers levels than people with acute cervical SCI who do not require mechanical ventilation.  
 
Hypothesis 3.3: People with acute cervical SCI independent of mechanical ventilation status 
who have higher inflammatory marker levels are more likely to develop pneumonia and other 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_11800].  
 
Potential Risks and Benefits:  
 
The overall risk of pulmonary complications in people with acute SCI ranges from 74- 84%. The 
proposed study is comparing tidal volume parameters used within current clinical practice. Our 
objective is to find optimal ventilator settings within the current clinical range to lower the current risk of pneumonia. Based on current evidence, pneumonia is associated with poor neurological  
recovery. Therefore, any decrease in the incidence of pneumonia can contribute to improved neurological recovery. There are no known risks of pulmonary complications due to 
participation in this  study.  
 
Risks of a blood draw and tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_312682]: The risks and discomfort of drawing blood include temporary discomfort from the needle stick, the possibility of pain or 
bruising at the blood draw site. Similarly, tracheal sample collection can also result in 
temporary discomfort.  
Other Risks:  There is a risk that confidentiality will be inadvertently compromised. 
 
 
3. STUDY POPULATION  
Sample Size:  We plan to recruit 45 subjects (15 in low Vt, 15 in high Vt, and 15 in the control 
group). We will recruit 30 adults with acute cervical SCI admitted on mechanical ventilation 
from TIRR MHH and Craig Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312683] 15 people with acute cervical SCI not dependent on mechanical ventilation at admission to serve as controls from TIRR MHH.  
Criteria for Recruitment:  All consecutive patients with SCI admitted to TIRR MHH and Craig 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312684]. The screening will involve the review of history from the patient or primary admi tting 
clinician. If a patient meets eligibility criteria, the research coordinator will provide further information on the study, answer any questions, and recruit if they are willing to participate and provide consent.  
Inclusion Criteria : Subjects must meet all of the inclusion criteria listed below to participate in 
this study.  
• Adult patients ≥ 18 years (Lung volumes and ventilator settings are different  for 
ages <18  years).  
• Acute SCI of duration ≤ four  months  
• Mechanical ventilation subjects: traumatic or non -traumatic cervical SCI with 
neurological level C1- C5 admitted to our acute inpatient rehabilitation facility  (AIR) 
on mechanical  ventilation.  
• Control subjects: traumatic cervical SCI admitted to 
our acute inpatient rehabilitation facility (AIR) who are not dependent on mechanical ventilation.  
Exclusion Criteria : All subjects meeting any of the exclusion criteria listed below at baseline will 
be excluded from participation.  
  IRB APPROVAL DATE:  02/23/2023  
01/11/2023  Page 6 of 15  • Severe dysphagia due to concomitant brain stem injury, which increases the risk 
of pneumonia 
• Severe brain injury resulting in dysphagia and inability to follow instructions to 
perform vital capacity  measurements  
• ARDS or severe lung disease (required supplemental oxygen or ventilator  prior 
to SCI) at the time of admission (these conditions will not allow patients to 
randomize because target Vt may  below)  
• Prolonged antibiotics for > 3 weeks at the time of admission due to infection 
(e.g., osteomyelitis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_115909],  etc.), 
• Presence of diaphragmatic  pacemaker.  
Withdrawal Criteria:  Possible reasons for discontinuation of study intervention: Intolerance to 
proposed ventilator settings.  
 
Subject Replacement:  Subject s who drop out will be replaced by [CONTACT_312727]. 
Subjects that drop out will be followed for secondary outcomes collected via the EMR while they 
remain at TIRR.  
 
4. TRIAL SCHEDULE:  
Participants will be enrolled in the study upon consent within 48-72 hrs of admission to TIRR 
MHH or Craig Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and participation will end on discharge from respective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The 
trial will start upon IRB and respective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312685] 1, 2021, and end on June 30, 
2024.  
 
5. STUDY  DESIGN  
We propose a randomized comparative effectiveness trial to study systematically current Vt 
ranges to determine optimal settings to improve outcomes. Study participants will be randomly assigned to high tidal volume (14- 16 ml/kg pbw) or low tidal volume of 8 to 10 ml/kg pbw within 
48 hrs of admission. Subjects will be stratified based vital capacity at admission (≥5.8 cc/kg pbw) to ensure equal allocation of those with the most severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_312686]. In our experience, vital capac ity ≥5.8 cc/kg pbw was associated 
with higher odds of weaning. We will screen and recruit an additional 15 people with acute SCI 
not dependent on mechanical ventilation at admission to serve as controls. We anticipate 3 
years to complete study recruitment.  A 1:1 allocation ratio will be applied to the mechanical 
ventilation groups. Participants, principal investigator, outcome assessors, and statistician will be blinded to tidal volume assignment. 
 
6. METHODS AND ASSESSMENTS  
Intervention: Lower Vt group will be kept 8- 10 ml/kg pbw with PEEP, and in the high Vt group, 
the participant will receive a tidal volume of 14- 16 ml/kg pbw with PEEP. The PEEP will be 
adjusted based on atelectasis on X -ray findings and patient tolerance within 5- [ADDRESS_385106] the 
current median minimum to maximum Vt range used in rehabilitation hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312687] 
8-16 ml/kg pbw. Tidal volumes will be increased per our institutional protocol at a rate of [ADDRESS_385107] Control (AC) Mode or synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation which is the current 
standard of practice in our free- standing acute inpatient rehabilitation unit. We will monitor peak 
and plateau pressures. All study participants will receive standard respi[INVESTIGATOR_45507], including secretion management using sub- glottic suction, mechanical insufflator -exsufflato r, albuterol - 
ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_312688] -needed medications for thick secretions (e.g., N -acetylcysteine, 
guaifenesin).  
Ventilator weaning Protocol is managed by [CONTACT_17685] -certified SCI medicine rehabilitation 
physicians in our institution. Internal Medicine physicians are consulted on all our mechanically  
ventila ted patients , and pulm onologist s are available for consultatio n as needeIRdB.  NTUheMvBeEnRt:ilHatSoCr-MS-21-0222

clear breath sounds, vital capacity  >10-12 ml/kg pbw measured by [INVESTIGATOR_246248]’s spi[INVESTIGATOR_312689], chest X -ray clear or stable, arterial blood gas analysis on room air within 
normal limits, no active infection, hemoglobin >10 gm/deciliter and should be tolerating 
tracheostomy cuff deflation. The institutional weaning protocol consists of 12- 19 days of 
progressive ventilator -free spontaneous breathing.  The weaning schedule is adjusted 
sometimes due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_11800], anxiety, and inability to tolerate protocol.  
 
Contr ol group: Both controls and people in mechanical ventilation groups will receive standard 
comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation services, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_312690]. 
 
Outcomes : The primary outcome is pneumonia epi[INVESTIGATOR_312691] [ADDRESS_385108] event.  
The secondary outcomes  include feasibility outcomes. We will obtain the following data: a) 
Recruitment rate : the proportion of eligible people who provide consent (b) Adherence rate: the 
proportion of participants in each group who receive assigned intervention per protocol; (c) Retention rate : the proportion of participants in each group who complete all study procedures 
and d) Missing data: Percentage of missing data in each group. Based on only one RCT25 
performed in SCI comparing high vs. low Vt, we anticipate a total recruitment rate  of 80% (i.e., 
that 80% of the eligible would consent for the study), and of those who are enrolled in the study, 80% adherence and retention rate will be observed. We anticipate <10% missing data.  
Additional outcomes : This data will be collected from the time of admission to our rehabilitation 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212136]. a) b) Other respi[INVESTIGATOR_11800]: The following ventilator - 
associated events will be reported: transfer to acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312692], weaning failure, new pneumothorax, ARDS, pleural effusion, pulmonary 
embolism, atelectasis, and pulmonary edema, and c) total ventilator days, weaning days and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577].  
We will perform an analysis of MV -related lung injury biomarkers . Blood and tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_312693] 3- time points; at baseline within [ADDRESS_385109] - weaning or 2 weeks from target Vt.  
Samples will be processed and stored at −80 ° C until use in D r. Doursout’s laboratory located at 
the Medical School, University of [LOCATION_007] in Houston, TX. We will focus on IL- 1, IL-6, IL-8, and 
TNF-α levels. For controls we will obtain blood samples within 48 hrs of admission and 2 weeks 
from baseline.  
Additional data: Additional  data collection  will include age, sex, weight,  height,  date of injury,  date 
of admission to AIR, time since injury, mechanism of injury, American Spi[INVESTIGATOR_222597] (ASIA) impairment scale (AIS), vital capacity at admission, maximum vital capacity achieved 
during AIR stay, ventilator  settings  including Vt, peak  and plateau pressure,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312694]. We will also collect information on any other ongoing or new infectious 
events other than pneumonia.

8. TREATMENT  
 
The current clinical practice guidelines recommend a higher tidal volume starting at 15 ml.kg predicted body weight (pbw) and upto 25 ml/kg pbw. These guidelines were written based on a 
small retrospective study and biological plausibility. People with SCI  suffer hypoventilation due 
to paralysis of the muscle of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. However, current data in people with and without ARDs suggests that lower tidal volume lowers the risk of morbidity and mortality and improves 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_195954]. Cohort study performed at TIRR also suggests that lower tidal volumes may lower the risk of  pneumonia.  
Our cohort study and a recent survey of physicians managing mechanical ventilators for people with SCI suggest practice variation in ventilator settings used for people with SCI. 
 
Data from our center and international survey:  
Variation in ventilator settings used for patients with acute SCI in acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312702] a rehabilitation facility (Unpublished data):  We collected data on 
91 patients who required mechanical ventilation at the time of admission to acute inpatient rehabilitation (AIR) facility from 2015- 2019. We noted variation (Figure 1.) in ventilator modes 
and settings used at acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312703]. Median (interquartile range) tidal volumes were 7.5 (6.7- 8.5) ml/kg pbw on admission to AIR facility or at the time of transfer 
from acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 84% of patients were receiving PEEP on admission. After admission 
to the AIR facility, all patients were weaned off PEEP within the next 1- [ADDRESS_385111] control mode. Patients’ tidal volumes were gradually increased to prevent atelectasis per SCI clinical practice guidelines.
4 As a result, the median (IQR) tidal volumes received in 
rehabi litation hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312704] 14 (13 -16) ml/kg pbw.  Our data suggest that ventilator settings 
used in acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312705].

Variation in ventilator settings used in acute care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312707] (manuscript under review):  We conducted an

weaning,  physicians  in acute  care mostly  relied  on arterial  blood gas (70%)  findings,  whereas  in 
the rehabilitation setting, physicians relied on vital capacity (73%). We found important differences in practices between “acute care and rehabilitation setting” and “within a 
rehabilitation setting.”

The proposed ventilator settings are within the currently used ventilator settings across the 
globe and in our institution. Our proposed study compares tidal volume ranges of 8- 10 ml/kg 
pbw and 14- 16 ml/kg pbw. After reviewing our institute's data, current  practice (survey results), 
and current literature in the non- SCI population, these settings were proposed. Tidal volumes 
are delivered via a mechanical ventilator used routinely in clinical practice.  
Concomitant therapy: Patients in MV group will undergo ventilator weaning and respi[INVESTIGATOR_312710]. We will collect information on all medications taken by [CONTACT_312730]. Controls will receive medical 
and rehabilitation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_312711].

Deidentified data on respi[INVESTIGATOR_312712] -associated events. Data will be 
collected and presented by [CONTACT_312731]. Inflammatory markers data from MV group and controls will be analysed by a blinded assessor. 
 
9. SAFETY MEASUREMENTS  
 
Collecting, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events

Safety Monitoring Plan  
The Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) for the research study includes statistical analysis on rates of morbidity of study participants compared to controls by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_312715] 
50% recruitment stage. If preliminary results suggest the risk of pneumonia is <25% in one 
group compared to another group, we will stop the study. 
 
We will follow standard clinical procedures in the event of a desaturation epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. The most 
common cause of desaturation is a mucus plug in people with spi[INVESTIGATOR_312716]. We will first suction the patient. If a patient is still not improving with 
suctioning, we will adjust ventilator settings, including tidal volume, to address clinical 
needs.  Given that we have a range of VT in each group, we will first adjust within that range if Vt has to be adjusted.  If a person requires further adjustment in Vt , we will allow 
the changes in ventilator settings to meet the patient's needs. We will not remove any 
patient from the study. We will include this data for intent to treat analysis. However, this 
event will be considered a treatment failure, and data will  be included to calculate feasibility 
metrics for a larger  study.  
 
 
10. DATA ANALYSIS  
 
Data Quality Assurance  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_46496]. Single data entry will be 
performed with plans to check 10% of primary variables as a quality control. Single data entry 
error rates are slightly higher than 0.5% when performed by [CONTACT_46515]. Data anomalies will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_46497]/or correction 
will be performed. Incomplete entries will be reviewed and corrected if information is available.  
 
Data Entry and Storage  
Data will be entered in redcap database accessed through desktop computer of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_312717] a locked office in TIRR Memorial Hermann and Craig Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Any paper documents will be 
filed in a study binder in a locked drawer in the office of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_312718]. 5 years after manuscript publication, the paper reports will be placed into the shredder bins for 
destruction.

01/11/2023  Page 12 of 15  Determination of Sample Size:  
The purpose of the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_312719] a randomized 
control trial comparing high vs. low Vt MV. Given the complexity of this study and practice 
variation, it is essential to evaluate recruitment and study procedures. Our cohort study data 
suggest that approximately 19 patients per year will meet eligibility. Based on Fenton et al. 
study comparing high vs. low Vt MV in SCI, we anticipate a total recruitment rate of 80% (i.e., 
that 80% of  the eligible would consent for the study), i.e., on average, we are expecting to enroll  
at least 10- 12 participants with SCI who are on mechanical ventilation per year for mechanical  
ventilation group and total of 30 subjects for 3 years. 
 
For the control group, we will recruit cervical SCI (neurological level C1- C5) who are not 
dependent on mechanical ventilation at admission to our acute inpatients rehabilitation facility. We plan to recruit a total of [ADDRESS_385114] 15 subjects in each group for the analysis.  
 
 
Statistical and Analytical Plans:  
Baseline data and unadjusted analysis of outcome variables will be presented as mean with 
standard deviation (SD) for a continuous variable with normal distribution otherwise as median with interquartile range (IQR). Categorical and ordinal data will be reported as totals and 
frequencies for baseline data and unadjusted analysis of outcome variables.  
 
Aim 1: Respi[INVESTIGATOR_195954]: We will report relative risk with credible interval and posterior probability. We will use neutral prior, and for binary outcomes, this will be centered at RR of 1 
with 95% credible interval of 0.[ADDRESS_385115] analyses. We 
will report risk ratios with 95% credible intervals and posterior probability of benefit or harm 
associated with the intervention.  
 
Aim 2: The number of patients contact[CONTACT_312732], and we will 
use the CONSORT diagram to summarize the numbers and reasons related to recruitment, follow- up, and dropout. The main feasibility outcomes include recruitment rate, adherence rate, 
and retention rate.  
We will summarize these outcomes by [CONTACT_312733]. We will inspect 
these percentages relative to our feasibility targets. 
 
Aim 3 : Individual inflammatory marker levels will be presented as mean with standard deviation. 
A linear mixed model will be constructed on cytokine levels, adding time and randomization group as factors in the model. In this model, the interaction between time and group will be used 
to study differences over time between groups.  A random intercept for the patient will be 
included to account for within- patient correlation. If the residuals are not normally distributed in 
linear mixed model analyses, the data will be transformed (e.g., natural logarithm), or an 
alternative distribution will be used. The relation between cytokine levels and the development of 
pneumonia or pulmonary adverse events will be studied with a multivariate logistic regression 
analysis. A risk ratio with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) will be presented

Informed Consent  
Subjects will be recruited upon admission, meeting the established I/E criteria, and consenting 
to participation. Informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the research assistant, and 
they will have one day to decide. All procedures will be fully disclosed, and we will give the 
subjects as much information as possible about the intervention and the data analysis. The 
subjects will be given the opportunity to ask questions. They will be reassured that their participation in this study is voluntary, and they have the right to withdraw at any time from the 
study. Any new findings developed during the course of this research that may affect their 
willingness to continue will be provided to subjects. Choosing not to participate or withdrawing 
from this s tudy will not negatively affect subjects’ right to any present or future medical 
treatment or employment to which the subjects are otherwise entitled. Although the PI [INVESTIGATOR_312720], they do not have an inpatient service, m inimizing 
unperceived coercion, which may be possible if the admitting physicians were directly involved in the study. Besides, the subjects will be asked to sign a Research Subject Authorization 
Confidentiality and Privacy Rights form to comply with HIPAA regulations.  
 
IRB review  
This protocol and the associated informed consent documents have been submitted to the IRB 
for review and approval.  
 
Confidentiality of Data and Patient Records  
All patient records will remain confidential. Data with Protected Health Information (PHI) will be 
de-identified and given a subject ID found on the Linking Log. The Linking Log is a  
separate file in a separate folder found on the PI’s desktop computer. 
 
13. PUBLICATIONS  
 
We anticipate publication in a peer -reviewed journal wit hin 1 year of completing this study 
describing the effects of high vs. low tidal volume people with acute SCI. 
14. RETENTION OF TRIAL  DOCUMENTS  
 
All records for all participants, including case report forms (CRFs) and source documentation, 
will be retained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a binder locked in his office and on his desktop computer locked in 
his office. IRB and  
regulatory records will be placed in a binder along with the mentioned documents and will be 
retained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_312721], locked in a cabinet. 
 
15. BIOBANKING 
 
In the case of participants from Craig Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4791] a SCI, we will undergo a separate and optional consent for participant to authorize the collection and storage leftover blood, urine, or tissue clinical samples that may be obtained related to either the  primary study or in the future 
as part of the participant’s regular medical care at Craig Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The consent contains separate YES/NO Questions to specify consent for collection and storage of leftover research 
and clinically related samples, future permission to contact, and wishes related to incidental 
(unexpected) findings. The participant’s choice will be recorded in a separate biorepository database.

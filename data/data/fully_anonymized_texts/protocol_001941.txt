1. Abstract  
a. Provide no more than a one page research abstract briefly stating the problem, the 
research hypothesis, and the importance of the research.  
b. Postpartum depression ([COMPANY_003]) —depression in the first postnatal year —affects 10 -
20% of women and is associated with diminished functioning, impaired 
interpersonal relationships, decreased parenting self -efficacy and less responsive 
parenting (1). Immigrant Latinas living in the [LOCATION_002] are disproportionately 
affected by [CONTACT_3642], with rates estimated between 30 -42% (2). According to the 2009 
US National Academies of Science review of maternal depression, “Few 
opportunities exist to identify the vulnerable population of children living in 
households with one or more parents experiencing depression or to offer prevention 
and treatment services that can improve the care of the depressed parent in a 
framework that also offers services for children” (3). The pediatric primary care 
setting provides a unique opportunity for the provision of such services, particularly 
in the current era, which promotes patient and family -centered care.    
c.  
d. Well -child care is often a missed opportunity to address psychosocial risk factors 
such as maternal depression (4). Capi[INVESTIGATOR_3623], 
especially for low -income families generally and immigrant families with limited 
English proficiency (LEP) specifically. Latino immigrant children and families 
experience disparities in health care access and quality (5).     Serving the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_3624], the Children’s Medical Practice (CMP) of 
the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center (JHBMC) is an ideal environment in 
which to develop and implement innovative primary care delivery models that meet 
identified health and psychosocial needs. We previously implemented a group model 
of well -child care  at CMP for parents of infants ages [ADDRESS_3318] parents attending pediatric primary care was 
increased time to discuss psychosocial issues such as perinatal depression (6).  
However, the visits were also noted to require significant time commitment on the 
part of parents. In addition, with the onset of COVID -19, there were challenges 
converting the full visit model to a virtual format, including coordinating the 
scheduling of both virtual and in -person formats and provider billing (manuscript 
under review).  Therefore, we aimed to develop a more accessible, less time -
intensive virtual group discussion that could be delivered independent of primary 
care pediatricians and could used to augment the standard well -child care of

Version 4 Dated:   01/[ADDRESS_3319] in which to provide psychoeducation around 
maternal depression and increase knowledge of clinic and community supports for 
Spanish -speaking families of infants.  
 
2. Objectives  (include all primary and secondary objectives)  
The primary objective of this proposal is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a 
virtual group augmentation of standard individual well -child care. The virtual group 
session is designed to provide (1) an introduction to ancillary clinic and community 
services, and (2) Provide an opportunity for psychoeducation and discussion about 
psychosocial factors impacting parents of infants, including postpartum depression.  The 
aims of the session are to (1) Increase participant knowledge about perinatal depression 
and the rationale for [COMPANY_003] screening in the general pediatric setting; (2) Decrease stigma 
about engaging in mental health treatment; and (3) Increase knowledge of available 
clinic and community resources related to addressing perinatal depression and social 
needs.  
 
 
3. Background  (briefly describe  pre-clinical and clinical data, current experience with 
proce dures, drug or device, and an y other relevant information to justify the research ) 
This project builds upon other work that we have done with the Baltimore Latino 
community, and specifically with perinatal Latinas. This work includes (1) Formative 
research to inform a depression stigma campaign in Baltimore (IRB00211051, PI: [INVESTIGATOR_3625]) which led to the development of a website that includes  (a) accessible, Spanish -
language information about depression; (b) video testimonials of community members 
who experienced depression ( https://www.fortalecebaltimore.org/historias ); and 
(c)Information about local resources. Our team also has experience successfully 
implementing virtual group discussions about psychosocial topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] (IRB00186999, PI: 
[INVESTIGATOR_3626]).  
 
 
4. Study Procedures  
a. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures    
(distinguish research procedures from those that are part of routine care ). 
 
Design Overview: The current study is designed as an open/single -arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_3627] 
(no comparison arm for this initial/preliminary study, which is also being offered as a clinic 
service).  
 
Population and recruiting: There will be two categories of study participants: (1) Spanish -
speaking parents of infants (< 6 months) attending Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center’s 
Children’s Medical Practice for pediatric primary care/infants of those parents and (2) 
Intervention facilitators.  We aim to recruit up to 60 parent participants  (with 60 corresponding 
infant records reviewed)  and up to 10 provider/stakeholder participants  
 
Recruitment procedures:

 For parent participants , there will be three  primary means of recruitment.  
(1) We will post and distribute a flyer at CMP describing the visit session and providing the 
research team’s contact [CONTACT_3643].  
 
(2) Newborn Visits:  At CMP, social work typi[INVESTIGATOR_3628].  At this meeting, social work  or 
pediatric providers /staff  will let families know about the program (see recruitment flyer/ script) 
and ask families whether they would be interested in being contact[CONTACT_3644] - and obtain permission to share family contact [CONTACT_3645].  On days when research staff are on -site at CMP, they 
may ask clinic staff whether they are seeing a patient that day who may qualify for the study. In 
this case, clinic staff will follow the procedures above (staff obtains permission from family for 
research staff to discuss the study with the family at the visit and/or to contact [CONTACT_3646] a 
later time).  For in -person interactions, staff will follow clinic/staff COVID restrictions (e.g. 
recommendations on masking and social distancing)  
 
(3) Obstetric staff: Obstetric social work may identify families who have confirmed that the 
newborn will be receiving pediatric care at CMP and may  share the recruitment flyer and  ask 
families whether they would be interested in being contact[CONTACT_3644] - and obtain permission to share family contact [CONTACT_3645].   
 
We will obtain oral consent. Baseline measures will be collected over the phone/zoom prior to 
session attendance.  Our team has experience obtaining oral consent and collecting measures 
over the phone, including those related to perinatal depression (IRB00186999, PI: [INVESTIGATOR_3626])  
 
Intervention Sessions will be offered at regular intervals, on at least a monthly basis, via Zoom. 
Intervention sessions are being offered as part of care at CMP. Intervention sessions will be 
observed by [CONTACT_3647].  
   
The session, which will be observed by [CONTACT_3648], will 
consist of the following procedures:  
 
Outline of Information Session Content (total 60 -75 minutes)  
- Introduction and discussion of purpose of the session (5 minutes)  
- Overview of services available at the clinic & procedures, reminder of MyChart (5 
minutes total)  
- Insurance, entitlement programs –  (10-15 minutes total)  
- Postpartum depression information, discussion of screening (30 -40 minutes)  
o [COMPANY_003] information: show video and discussion afterwards  
▪ Video : (5 minutes)  
▪ Reflection/discussion about video 10 minutes  
▪ Additional core messages: 10 minutes  
• Prevalence and signs of of [COMPANY_003]  
• Discussion of [COMPANY_003] Screening procedures, rationale for screening

health stigma campaign (Formative research for the campaign conducted as part of 
IRB00211051 ), video to be shown is available at  https://www.fortalecebaltimore.org/historias    
 
After the session, ideally within [ADDRESS_3320] session interviews may be conducted at the same time as the surveys, 
or at a separate time, depending on the preference of the participant.  
 
6 months after the session, the research team will administer questionnaires over the phone 
assessing feedback about the intervention, physical and mental health services utilization, and re -
administering measures of stigma, depression knowledge, intention to seek [COMPANY_003] treatment if 
needed, intention to seek primary health care, and self -efficacy to manage negative emotions.  A 
summary of measures used and timing is included in Table 1  below.  
 
 
For clinic staff/stakeholder participants:  
A research assistant will clinic staff (pediatrician, social work, community outreach specialist, 
medical assistant, and/or nursing) via email (see recruitment email) and will subsequently obtain 
oral consent and obtain baseline facilitator information via phone or redcap survey, depending on 
the preference of the participant.  After the first, 3rd and 6th session delivered by [CONTACT_3651], 
brief measures of intervention feasibility and appropriateness will be obtained.  In addition, up to 
three, 15 -30 minute semi -structured interviews will be completed with facilitators/stakeholders 
over the course of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (anticipated 1.5 years).  Interviews and surveys may be conducted 
together/at the same time with the survey or at separate times, depending on the preference of the 
staff participant.

 For qualitative data, the interviews will be digitally -recorded and then transcribed and 
translated (if applicable).  Prior to analysis names and other identifying factors in the 
interview will be removed or assigned a pseudonym.  We will explicitly ask for 
permission to record interviews, and will not audio record interviews if any 
participant does not feel comfortable with doing so. After completing an interview or 
visit, the digital file will be downloaded to a Safe Desktop site. Files will not contain 
identifying information but will be labelled with the participant unique identifying 
code. Audio recordings will be deleted from digital recorders as soon as successful 
downloading of the file has been confirmed.  Fidelity checklists and observation notes 
will also be included in the qualitative data collection and analysis.  
 
During analysis of qualitative study data, the study team will develop preliminary 
themes iteratively and through consensus. At least two investigators will 
independently code each text segment and then generate analytic conclusions with 
other study team members.

8. Risks  
a. Medical risks, listing all procedures, their major and minor risks and expected 
frequency.  
 
i. Risks associated with completing measures and interviews : Completing measures about 
sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] (eg depression), or participating in interviews may be stressful for the 
participants.    
 
ii. Risks associated with participation in group discussions  
-Symptom/situation disclosure:  it is possible that parent participants will disclose 
psychosocial circumstances warranting concern and evaluation and that the provider may 
have difficulty managing multiple disclosures.  
-Group dynamics:  it is possible that parents will feel uncomfortable participating in group 
discussions  
-There are risks that other group members may discuss what happened in the group outside 
of that setting  
 
 
iii. Risks associated with Observation process  
Reactivity and Observer Bias – We are mindful of the reactivity effect (i.e. study participants’ 
behavior being influenced by [CONTACT_3656]). We note that several staff typi[INVESTIGATOR_3632]  (facilitator, co -
facilitator, MA/Nursing staff), which we believe may “normalize” the presence of additional staff to

Version 4 Dated:   01/[ADDRESS_3328] job performance/evaluation.  
 
 
iv. Risks to confidentiality - Virtual discussion  Risks associated with virtual group discussion, 
there is risk that discussion via Zoom groups may be “hacked” - this risk will be minimize by 
[CONTACT_3657] (a separate password for each 
group discussion).  Virtual groups are conducted as part of routine clinical care at CMP (e.g. 
parent support groups) and research studies (, thus we do not anticipate additional risk related 
to research.  
 
 
 
 
 
b. Steps taken to minimize the risks.  
 
Completing research measures or interviews:  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_3633].  Participants will be reminded that they do not have to 
answer any questions with which they feel uncomfortable.  Should a participant 
become distressed, the study staff member can provide reassurance, evaluate his/her 
concerns, and remind participant that he/she may stop at any time.  The participant 
will also be asked if he/she would like to discuss concerns with on -site clinic social 
work or mental health staff or with the Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_3672], a bilingual 
psychiatrist.  
Risks associated with participation in group discussions  
1.. Group discussion facilitators have been trained in Facilitative  Leadership 
through the Centering Healthcare Institute prior to  conducting any groups. We 
plan to have the CMP clinic social  worker, who is experienced in managing 
group psychotherapy and  support groups (including parenting groups, 
general support groups, and groups focused on domestic violence in the Latino 
community), co -facilitate the discussions to minimize these risks.  
 
2.We have developed a proactive management plan for disclosures which  will 
include participation of relevant on -site staff (i.e.; embedded mental health 
providers and clinic social work staff).  During the study/group visits we will have 
a plan for availability of this staff to the provider (as well as the  PI, who is a 
bilingual psychiatrist) for additional support to group visit  facilitators.   JHBMC -
CMP has two embedded social workers who are available for “curbside” 
consultations and evaluation of risk, including suicidality.  We will also review 
and follow clinic protocols for management of positive maternal depression 
screens prior to study initiation (including further on -site evaluation and 
treatment, and referral sources). Clinic psychiatric emergency procedures will be

 reviewed and detailed with both sites prior to the study.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_3634].  Required reporting procedures (e.g. child 
protective agency reporting or other reporting) will be followed and these 
reporting requirements will be described in the participant consent script  
 
3. Ground Rules” for the group, which include not discussing issues brought up in 
the group with individuals outside of the group, will be reviewed at the start of 
each session  
 
 
Risks associated with observation process:  
We will utilize unobtrusive observation and note -taking techniques to minimize this effect. 
Finally, we will regularly reinforce with group facilitators that the observation process will not 
affect job performance/evaluation. If participants do not wish to have visits observed, we 
will have providers complete the fidelity checklist after the visits  
 
Risks associated with participating in group sessions via Zoom  
-We will require a meeting password for all Zoom sessions. This password will only be 
shared with participants and the study team.  
-Participants will be asked to join the sessions from a private space, if possible.  
-When we go over “ground rules” at the beginning of each session, we will remind 
participants to be careful about what they share since everyone in the group is joining 
from their home and there is a risk that something they say could be heard by [CONTACT_3658] a child, spouse or other family member  
 
c. Plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study deviations.  
 
The research staff and involved providers will be trained and instructed on the need to report to 
the investigator any indication that an adverse event has occurred.  When the PI [INVESTIGATOR_3635], she will investigate until they understand as many details of the adverse event as 
possible. Staff will make an excel sheet to summarize any adverse event by [CONTACT_3659] , stored on secure internal drive (e.g. onedrive) .  The investigator will 
review this excel sheet periodically.  We will follow JHU’s IRB’s definition for an adverse event 
and will report any adverse events to both the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine IRB

d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality.  
Risks to Confidentiality - research material : There are risks that the confidentiality of participants 
could be violated and the participant’s involvement in the study could be revealed to people not 
involved in the study such as friends, family members, or colleagues (for a description of data 
confidentiality procedures see protection against risks below). This could have a negative impact 
on the participant if they wished to keep their involvement in the study private.

 Confidentiality Risks of Data and Materials:  Although all notes/data will be stored in a secure 
and confidential manner, and we will code all stored data and store it separate from any direct 
participant identifiers, accidental breaches of confidentiality are technically possible.   
 
Steps taken to address risk include : 
-Precautions against loss of or breach of collected data will include making sure that no data 
forms or data files ever contain identifying information and that any files identifying participants 
are protected and destroyed as soon as possible.  Identifiable data will never be stored on 
portable devices unless this is for the purpose of locking those devices in secure physical storage.  
Appropriate firewalls, encryption, and password protection will be used for network -connected 
devices used to store or manipulate data.   
-Parent participant name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_3660] a 
locked location during the duration of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_3636], or for follow up with consent from the 
participant. After the pi[INVESTIGATOR_3637], all contact [CONTACT_3661] . Confidentiality of data will be assured using 
subject identification numbers for all data collection and analyses.  Parents will receive a unique 
ID number.  Audio recorded data will be identifiable only by a group ID number and originals 
will be stored in a locked cabinet; no names or individual ID#s will be attached to these 
recordings.  Questionnaires will be completed over the phone, directly entered by [CONTACT_3647], 
or will be sent via RedCap, as per participant preference  
-Survey  Data will then be housed in a secure database (i.e.; REDCAP) and accessed on secure 
workstations connected to servers that are accessible by [CONTACT_3662], and data will be backed up by [CONTACT_3663].  
 
-Interview data will be collected by [CONTACT_3664] a secure private area  or over the phone  and audio 
recorded using a device that is passcode protected and that automatically encrypts files.  The 
interviews will be digitally -recorded and then transcribed and translated (where applicable) by a n 
approved  transcription/translation service with experience with confidential research data. Prior 
to analysis, names and other identifying factors in the interview will be removed or assigned a 
pseudonym/ID number. All material will be collected specifically for the proposed research 
project.  
-To protect confidentiality all research participants will be identified by a unique identifier of the 
participant’s initials and a sequentially assigned participant number for forms and data files, and 
not the participant’s name.  All research data will be stored in a locked area that is only 
accessible to research staff and will not be left unattended.  Any documents with confidential 
information will be shredded before being discarded.  Confidential information will not be given 
to anyone outside of the research study, unless there is concern about risk to self or others.  All 
staff will be trained in these procedures.  All data files and analyses will be performed on 
research computers using only code numbers to identify participants.  Audio will be recorded on 
a device that is passcode -protected and encrypted.  Only summaries of group data will be

 reported in any publications or presentations, with no identification of individuals.  
  
 Confidentiality - EMR data : Failure to maintain confidentiality of data collected on caregiver -
patient dyads would be associated with breach of confidentiality. We will keep the child’s name 
[CONTACT_3670] -of-birth in a separate, secure file within the REDCap database used to manage survey 
and collected EMR data. We will maintain a separate file with a link to study ID with personal 
health information for each participant (child name, date of birth, MRN, phone number, parent 
name, address) which will also have the participant ID. This file will be encrypted and password 
protected and will be accessed only by [CONTACT_3665]. Once study participation and EMR 
review concludes, all PHI for that participant will be removed and their data will only be 
available by [CONTACT_3666]. REDCap is a well -respected established platform for 
securely storing research data.  Once the electronic medical record has been located and 
reviewed, these child identifiers will be removed from the database. For participants who consent 
to be contact[CONTACT_3667] a separate, encrypted 
file. 
 
 
 
e. Financial risks to the participant s. 
-Risks associated with participation include charges on the cell phone bill associated with 
participation in consenting, completing measures, and participating in the group sessions via 
video conferencing, which will require either internet access or use of smartphones with data 
plans.  Participants will be provided with remuneration that is expected to cover potential cell 
phone charges for completing measures.  We will assess technology access and for individuals 
without internet access or unlimited data plans, will allow participation/call -in via phone  
-As the clinic plans to offer these information sessions as part of the menu of services available 
within the clinic and has budgeted staff time appropriately, there will not be loss of income to 
staff facilitating the intervention  
 
9. Benefits  
a. Description of the probable benefits  for the participant and for society . 
 
-For the parents participating in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], there is no guarantee of benefits to any of the 
participants.  However, benefits to participation may include an increase in knowledge about 
postpartum depression as well as about clinic and community resources, and improvements in 
engagement in well -child care, and social support through participating in the intervention.  
 
-There are no direct benefits to stakeholders participating in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. However, it is possible that 
delivery of information in groups may decrease the need for time spent delivering information to 
individual parents  
 
We believe that this project can serve as a replicable and accessible model for care delivery 
Spanish -speaking population in Baltimore, and to health care systems more generally through a) 
identifying an intervention method that is acceptable and feasible in a non -clinical as well as a

10. Payment and Remuneration  
a. Detail compensation for participant s including possible total compensation, 
proposed bonus, and any proposed reductions or penalties for not completing the 
protocol.  
-Participants will be compensated for time spent completing research measures.  
Participants will receive $20 for completing the baseline survey measures,  $20 for completing 
follow -up survey measures, and $20 for completing 6 -month survey measures  
-Stakeholders/clinic staff will be compensated for time spent completing research measures. 
Staff will receive $5 for completing appropriateness and feasibility measures  
-Participants and staff will receive $40 for each interview completed  
- Compensation will either be mailed or electronically delivered to intervention 
participants, depending on their preference.  
11. Costs  
a. Detail costs of study procedure(s) or drug (s) or substance(s) to participant s and 
identify who will pay for them.  
 
The potential costs to the participants include time spent in visits and study activities. 
Remuneration for the study is designed to partially offset this potential loss of income.    
Additionally, there may be cellular phone charges to participants for any phone communication 
or use of data plan to connect virtually to the group sessions during the study. There is no cost to 
the participants for the surveys for any source of data collection.  
 
There is no associated cost of the study procedures, as the clinic staff anticipate that delivery of  
the program will be part of the regular menu of services offered by [CONTACT_3652], within the scope of 
current clinic/personnel responsibilities

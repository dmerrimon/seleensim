     Summary  
Preclinical diastolic dysfunction (PDD) is the initial compensated phase of left 
ventricular diastolic  dysfunction with preserved ejection fraction (EF ) and without 
symptoms of heart failure ( HF). 
We have previously demonstrated that a common hallmark of preclinical diastolic 
dysfunction (PDD) was impaired renal function, characterized by [CONTACT_913990] (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF), with an attenuated plasma natriuretic peptide and renal cyclic guanosine 3’,5’ -monophosphate (cGMP) response to saline 
volume expansion (VE).   The mechanism for the renal dysfunction and attenuated renal 
cGMP response to VE is undefined.  
 Type V phosphodiesterase (PDEV) metabolizes cGMP and is abundant in the 
kidney, vasculature, and has been recently reported in the heart. (2,3)  We and others 
have demonstrated that renal PDEV is up- regulated in experimental HF and may lead to 
the attenuation of renal cGMP generation in response to both endogenous and exogenous BNP, thus serving as a mechanism for renal resistance to BNP. 
Furthermore, in experimental overt HF, 10 days of PDEV inhibition treatment result ed in 
reduction of left ventricular (LV) mass, increased LV fractional  shortening and cardiac 
output.  Furthermore, chronic PDEV inhibition did enhance the renal actions of exogenous BNP, specifically improving GFR and renal cGMP generation. (4)  PDEV 
inhibitors are FDA approved for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.  
 
Objective: To determine the effect of 12 weeks of chronic PDEV inhibition with 
Tadalafil  versus placebo  on basal cardiorenal  and humoral function and on the 
integrated cardiorenal and humoral response to acute sodium loading in subjects  
with PD D and renal dysfunction.  
 Hypotheses:  
1. Chronic PDEV inhibition with Tadalafil will result in the improvement of 
renal function measured by [CONTACT_269397] (GFR) as compared 
to placebo in subjects with PDD and renal dysfunction.  
2. Chronic PDEV inhibition with Tadal afil will result in the  improvement 
urinary sodium excretion and urinary cGMP excretion in response to acute sodium lo ading as compared to placebo in subjects wi th PD D and renal 
dysfunction.  
 Study design:  
This will be a  single center  double blind placebo- controlled design. Sub jects 
will be randomized in a 2:1 design, to the Tadalafil alone group or  placebo.  
 
Primary end points:  
1. Change in GFR from baseline after 12 weeks of chronic Tadalafil versus 
placebo.

 2. Change in urinary sodium excretion and urinary cGMP excretion in 
response to acute sodium loading from baseline after 12 weeks of chronic Tadalafil versus placebo.  
   Background  
In the AHA/ACC classification of HF, stage B is defined as patients with 
abnormal heart structure/function (systolic or diastolic dysfunction) without symptoms. 
This concept of preclinical HF is based on the fact that abnormal heart structure/function 
can be detected by [CONTACT_913991]. (5,8) 
Patients with those abnormalities may progress to heart failure and are at increased risk of adverse cardiac events.  Preclinical diastolic dysfunction (PD D) is the initial 
compensated phase of left ventricular diastolic  dysfunction with preserved EF and  
without symptoms of HF.  
We have previously demonstrated that a common hallmark of preclinical diastolic 
dysfunction (PDD) was impaired renal function, characterized by [CONTACT_913992] (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF), with an attenuated plasma natriuretic peptide and renal cyclic guanosine 3’,5’ -monophosphate (cGMP) response to saline 
volume expansion (VE).   The mechanism for t he renal dysfunction and attenuated renal 
cGMP response to VE is undefined.  
 Cyclic GMP is the second messenger of the natriuretic peptide system ( NPS) 
and the nitric oxide system (NO) and plays an important role in the preservation of myocardial, vascular, and renal function.  Hence, disruption of this signal transduction 
process may contribute to the development of cardiorenal dysfunction(1) . Type V 
phosphodiesterase (PDEV) metabolizes cGMP and is abundant in the kidney, vasculature, and has been recently reported in the heart. (2,3)  We and others have 
demonstrated that renal PDEV is up- regul ated in experimental HF and may lead to the 
attenuation of renal cGMP generation in response to both endogenous and exogenous BNP, thus serving as a mechanism for renal resistance to BNP. Furthermore, in 
experimental overt HF, 10 days of PDEV inhibition treatment resulted in reduction of left 
ventricular (LV) mass, increased LV fractional  shortening and cardiac output.  
Furthermore , chronic PDEV inhibition did enhance the renal actions of exogenous BNP, 
specifically improving GFR and renal cGMP generation.(4)   PDEV inhibitors are FDA 
approved for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.  
 
Objective: To determine the effect of 12 weeks of chronic PDEV inhibition with 
Tadalafil   versus placebo  on basal cardiorenal  and humoral function and on the 
integrated cardiorenal and humoral response to acute sodium loading in subjects  
with PD D and renal dysfunction.  
 Hypotheses:  
1. Chronic PDEV inhibition with Tadalafil will result in the improvement of 
renal function measured by [CONTACT_269397] (GFR) as compared 
to placebo in subjects with PDD and renal dysfunction.  
2. Chronic PDEV inhibition with Tadal afil will result in the  improvement 
urinary sodium excretion and urinary cGMP excretion in response to acute sodium lo ading as compared to placebo in subjects with PDD and renal 
dysfunction.

Primary end points:  
1. Change in GFR from baseline after 12 weeks of chronic Tadalafil versus  
placebo.  
2. Change in urinary sodium excretion and urinary cGMP excretion in response to acute sodium loading from baseline after 12 weeks of chronic 
Tadalafil versus placebo.  
 Secondary end point:  
1. Change in LVEF, dimensions and diastolic function from baseline after 12 weeks of chronic Tadalafil versus placebo.  
2. Change in blood pressure (BP), heart  rate, right ventricular (RV) end - 
systolic pressure and RV functions.  
  Study design:  
This will be a  single center  double blind placebo- controlled design. Sub jects 
will be randomized in a 2:1 design, to the Tadalafil alone group or placebo .  
 Study population  
A total of  45  patients with PDD as defined by [CONTACT_913993] 50% with moderate or severe diastolic  (grade 2 or greater)  dysfunction as assess ed 
by [CONTACT_45066] , assessed within 36 months of enrollment),  ) If 
patient’s EF was assessed greater than 36 months, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_913969]-held echo machine.  If EF is  equal or 
greater than 50% and a grade 2 or greater , the patient will be enrolled.   The patient will 
receive compressive echo assessment during the study.  
Also having  no clinical signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure, a minimal distance

• In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_913970], diet instructions will be given by [CONTACT_913994],  Hgb A1C , electrolyte  panel, AST and Bilirubin will be 
obtained. Prior to the first overnight stay  the study, subjects will be given instructions on  
(120 mEq Na/day) which will be maintained throughout the study period.   
If subjects calculated creatinine clearance is not between 30 to 90 ml/min using 
the MDRD formula the subject will be excluded from the study.  Also at consent visit the [ADDRESS_1284304] intravenous (IV) 
catheters will be placed (one in each arm). One catheter will be used for infusion and the 
other (in the contralateral arm) for blood sampling.  Subjects will be a sked to drink 
5ml/Kg of water to insure sufficient urinary flow. A priming dose (calculated according to 
body size) of Iothalamate, to measure glomerular filtration rate (GFR) followed by a 
constant rate IV sustaining dose (calculated according to estimated kidney function) of Iothalamate.  The subjects will be asked to empty their bladder spontaneously every 
thirty minutes (if subjects are unable to void every thirty minutes, a urinary catheter can 
be used upon consent).  Extra fluids may be given if subjects are not able to void and 
the amount recorded in the total of fluids given.  Throughout the study, at the end of each 
30-minute clearance period, subjects will be asked to drink an amount of water 
equivalent to the sum of the blood losses and the urinary  flow. After an equilibration 
period of 45 minutes, a 30- minute baseline renal clearance will be carried out. Urinary 
samples for determination of volume, urinary sodium excretion (UNaV), cGMP, B NP, 
Iothalmate, , will be obtained at the end of the clearance period.  Venous blood samples 
for Iothalmate, , sodium, ANP, BNP, cGMP, renin, angiotensin II , Lipid profile,  glycerol, 
adiponectin, and aldosterone will be obtained at the middle of the clearance period. 
7 
 Collection of blood at baseline, during and after  sodium load will be stored for future 
DNA/Protein analysis.  
  Blood pressure will be measured at 20- minute intervals by [CONTACT_913995], and heart rate will be continuously monitored by [CONTACT_186660].  
 
Echocardiography will be performed during these baseline clearances to 
determine left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) volumes, systolic and diastolic 
function, right ventricular end systolic pressure and function according to the 
American Society of Echocardiography guidelines.    
  
After the baseline clearance the acute saline load will be administered (normal saline 0.9% 0.25 ml/kg/min for 1 hour).  During the 1 hour saline load, one 30- minute clearance 
(as outlined above) will be repeated with the subjects in supi[INVESTIGATOR_913971] a second 30- minute clearance will be repeated with the subject sitting  or the head of the 
bed up. As above, blood samples are collected midway during each clearance and urine samples are obtained every 30 minutes. Echocardiography will be repeated immediately 
after the end of the saline infusion.  
 
At the completion of the baseline renal clearance periods and response to acute sodium load, subjects will be randomized to Tadalafil  or placebo.  Subjects will be randomized 
in a 2:1 fashion. The randomization schedule will be provided by [CONTACT_215149], implemented by [CONTACT_913996].   
  
All subjects will initially take 1 tab  Tadalafil ( 5mg) or P lacebo. The blood pressure will be 
checked prior to administering the drug.  Thereafter, both blood pressure and heart rate 
will continue to be monitored every [ADDRESS_1284305] dose 
of study drug if patient’s systolic blood pressure is < [ADDRESS_1284306] will continue in the study.   After 2 
hours if blood pressure is >95 systolic then give 1 more (5 mg ) of Tadalafil  or placebo  
and monitor blood pressure for 2 hours. If blood pressure is >[ADDRESS_1284307] on 
2 (5 mg ) tabs of tadalafil  or placebo. If blood pressure is between 90 – 95 mmHg 
systolic, then dismiss on 1 ( 5 mg ) tab of Tadalafil  or placebo to be maint ained on this 
dose for the remainder of the study and not be increased     
 
Subjects will be instructed to take their blood pressure daily for [ADDRESS_1284308] any questions or 
develop any  side effects.   
 
At 2 weeks  (± 5 days)  from dismissal if blood pressure is> 100 than add  1 (5 mg ) tab of 
Tadalafil  or placebo to make a total of 3 (5mg) tabs of Tadalafil  or placebo.  
 
At 4 weeks(± 5 days)  if blood pressure is > 100 add 1 ( 5 mg ) tab to make a total of 4 (5 
mg Tadalafil  or placebo.  
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_913972] < 90 
and/or has symptoms of hypotension e.g. lightheadedness, dizziness, feeling faint, 
blurred vision.    
 
8 
 Subjects will return after one week (± 4 days) for electrolyte check . For patients who live 
more than [ADDRESS_1284309] we will try to arrange this visit with the patient’s local physician.  
They will also receive a weekly phone call to review status.   
 
After six w eeks  (±5 days )  , subjects will repeat blood draw for safety labs (  electrolytes).  
For patients who do not live more than [ADDRESS_1284310] we will try to arrange this visit with 
the patient ’s local physician.  
  
At the end of the twelve- week study period (+ or  – 8 days) , subjects will be admitted to 
the CRU the afternoon prior to the renal clearance study.  We will get an hgb A1C with 
the evening blood draw for the creatinine.  Echocardiography, renal clearance, humoral 
determination and acute saline load will be performed in the same manner as the 
baseline study.  Subjects will also perform a [ADDRESS_1284311] been designed in collaboration 
with the Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, (Kent Bailey, Ph.D) .    
The primary analyses will be a couple of 2- sample comparisons (2- sample t -test) of the 
effects of interest: Changes in glomerular filtration rate, sodium excretion, urinary cGMP 
excretion, left ventricular end systolic and diastolic volume.  To further investigate this 
relati onship we will also do an analysis of covariance to look at the group differences on 
the final effects of the drug after adjusting for the before drug measurements. Values will 
be expressed as the mean + SD. A statistically significant difference will be c onsidered 
to be present when p<0.017.   
 
Sample size calculation:  Based on our completed specific aims [ADDRESS_1284312] 80% power to detect the differences as reported 
in the second table.   
The table below summarizes preliminary data on these within subject changes:

Recruitment of subjects:   
Subjects will be recruited from the echo database and will receive a reimbursement of 
$300 for participation in the study.    
Assessment of systolic and diastolic function by [CONTACT_51541]:  Transthoracic 
echocardiography will be performed according to the standard clinical Amercian Society 
of Echocardiography methods.   
 
Analytic methods  
Both plasma and urine concentration of Iothalmate and PAH will be determined by [CONTACT_913997]. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) will be calculated using Iothalmate 
clearance   
GFR (ml / min)  =     U   x   V              
                 P                                                          
Where:    U = urine concentration; P = plasma concentration;  V = urine flow (mL/ 
min) 
Plasma and urine will be analyzed for sodium with the Beckman ion- selective analyzer.  
Urine creatinine will be measured by [CONTACT_186666].  Venous blood for hormone analysis will be collected in heparin and EDTA tubes and immediately 
placed on ice.  After centrifugation at 2,500 rpm at  4C, the plasma will be decanted and 
stored at -80C until analysis.  Specific plasma radioimmunoassays include renin, 
aldosterone, angiotensin II, ANP, BNP and cGMP.  Urine for cGMP and CNP radioimmunoassays will also be collected on ice as previously desc ribed.  
  
 
PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
a) Human Subject Involvement and Characteristics  
[ADDRESS_1284315] population is as follows:  
 
PDD-will consist of  45 subjects with an ejection fraction of greater  than 50%  with 
moderate or severe diastolic  (grade 2 or greater)  dysfunction as assess ed by [CONTACT_913998]; a 
minimal distance on 6 -minute walk of >450 meters and calculated creatinine clearance 
of equal or less than 60 ml/min and greater than 30 ml/min, using the MDRD formula 
assessed within the past [ADDRESS_1284316] is not able to walk 450 meters due to 
pain in hips and knees and not fatigue or shortness of breath than they will still qualify for 
the protocol.  
  
b) Source of Materials   
Plasma samples, urine samples echocardiographic data and clinical data will be 
used entirely for research purposes. Patient identifiers will not be released outside of 
Mayo and any publications will exclude any kind of patient identifiers that could be 
correlated with the specific patient.  Limited access data set will be made available 
according the NHLBI guidelines . 
c) Potential Risks and Adequacy of Protection against Risks  
 
The overall risk  for participation in the protocol is small and the main concern is that the 
addition of PDEV inhibition (Tadalafil) may result in hypotension.  The medication will be 
started in the CTSA CRU under close monitoring; hence, the study has extremely little 
risk of causing irreversible consequence on the patients. 
In addition the subjects will measure their blood pressure daily at home and will be instructed to report a blood pressure below [ADDRESS_1284317] has a blood pressure < 90 and or has symptoms 
of hypotension e.g. lightheadedness, dizziness, feeling faint, blurred vision .  
 Tadalafil is a PDEV inhibitor which is FDA approved for the management of erectile 
dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.  The recommended dose for erectile dysfunction is 5 mg/day and for pulmonary hypertension in patients with renal 
dysfunction (eGFR<30 <80 ml/min ) is 20 mg once a day.  
 Common side effects include; Flushing (1% to 13% ),Indigestion (4% to 13% ), 
Nausea (up to 11% ); Backache (3% to 12% );Myalgia (1% to 14% ); Headache (3% to 
42% ); Nasopharyngitis (2% to 13% ) and Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (7% to 13% ).  
 Rare side effects include:  Angina (less than 2% ), Chest pain (less than 2% ), 
Heart failure, Myocardial infarction (less than 2% ), Tachycardia (less than 2%, Stevens -
Johnson syndrome, Cerebral hemorrhage, Cerebrovascular accident, Seizure, Non-
arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy, Retinal artery occlusion, Thrombosis of retinal vein, 
11 
 Decreased hearing, Sudden onset (less than 2% ), Sudden hearing loss (less than 2% ).  
Priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801].  
 
Acute saline loading:  These studies require acute saline loading with normal saline 
0.9% 0.25 ml/kg/min for [ADDRESS_1284318] the risk of hypotension, the following measure are 
incorporated in the protocol:  
• Screening and application of exclusion criteria will minimize risks  
• Medication will be initiated in the CTSA CRU under close monitoring.  
 
The following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_913973]:  
The blood pressure will be checked prior to giving the drug.   
 
• If after the first dose of study drug if patient’s systolic blood pressure is <  [ADDRESS_1284319] will continue in the study.  
• Any patient that experiences any adverse events as defined below during the study the study drug will be reduced or stopped.   The adverse events include: 
hypotension as defined by a)  any clinical symptoms of hypotension e.g. 
lightheadedness, dizziness, feeling faint, blurred vision and b) if systolic blood 
pressure is < 85 mmHg;  b) symptoms of heart failure for > 45 m inutes ; c) allergic 
reaction to the drug and others unexpected adverse events which is deemed to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_093].  
 
Plan of intervention in the event of adverse effects to the subjects.  
• In the CRU, if the patient does develop hypotension,  as defined by a) any clinical 
symptoms of hypotension e.g. lightheadedness, dizziness, feeling faint, blurred vision and b) if systolic blood pressure is < 85 mmHg; the clinical care team will 
manage that according to the standard resuscitative procedure: Trendelenburg 
position, give fluid IV, use of vasopressor if necessary  
 
Other potential minor risk includes:  
 
The risks of blood drawing include bleeding at the puncture site, bruising and 
pain. These risks occur in a very small portion of the population.  
 
This protocol may be hazardous to an unborn child.  There is no medical 
information to determine whether there are significant risks to a fetus carried by a mother 
who is participating in this study.  Therefore, female participants must be 
postmenopausal or have been surgically sterilized or have a negat ive pregnancy test 
and must agree to use a reliable method of contraception until study completion. 
Methods of contraception include: birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]/implants/injections, intrauterine 
devices, spermicide, diaphragm or condoms.    
[ADDRESS_1284320] been only rare allergic reactions (one or two) when the solution has been 
used for this type of test. The amount of the material injected for this test will be 
approximately the same as that used in a similar kidney function test performed on a 
routine basis (approximately 250 tests per month) in the Renal Function Laboratory. 
However, patients with a history of an allergic reaction to iodine should not participate in 
this study.  
 
d) Recruitment and Informed Consent  
Subjects will be recruited at the Mayo Clinic from the Heart Failure Clinic, 
Community Internal Medicine, and General Internal Medic ine and referrals from 
physicians in the Mayo Health care system . In addition, we also now have in place a 
new web- based patient identification system developed at Mayo by [CONTACT_913999].  This system can be cross -referenced with the Mayo 
Echocardiography laboratory database and can identify patients with left ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction without clinical diagnosis of CHF throughout the entire Mayo system.   
 
Patients will be approached for participation in the study in one the following ways:  
• Approached at the clinic  
• Letters of invitation or phone calls to patients that we have identified through our 
web-based patient identification system  and colleague’s referrals. Both the letters 
of invitation and phone scripts will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_741877].  
• We will also call or send a letter to a list of participants who enrolled in our 
previous PPG studies  
 Upon identification of a subject, the study will be explained in detail by [CONTACT_186668]-coordinator, the consent form reviewed questions answered and the consent 
form signed.  The information in the consent form that will be reviewed is as follows:  
 
• Why is this research study being done?  
 
• How many people will take part in this research study?  
 
• What will happen in this research study?  
 
• How long will I be in this research study?  
• Are there reasons I might leave this research study early?  
• Will any biological sample(s) be stored and used for research in the future? 
 
• How do researchers from other  institutions get the sample?  
 
• What are the risks of this research study?  
 
• Are there benefits to taking part in this research study?  
13 
  
• Will I be compensated for the study?  
 
• What other choices do I have if I don’t take part in this research study?  
 
• Will I need to pay for the tests and procedures?  
 
• What happens if I am injured because I took part in this research study?  
 
• What are my rights if I take part in this research study?  
 
• Who can answer my questions?  
e) Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others  
Subjects participating will not  benefit from this study ..  More importantly, this 
study will provide us new insights into the human cardiorenal syndrome that may allow 
us to develop new therapeutic strategies, which may benefit others with the same 
problem.   
 
f) Importance of Knowledge to be Gained  
This research will provide us new insights into the human preclinical left 
ventricular and renal dysfunction that may allow us to develop new therapeutic strategies, which may benefit others with the same problem.  
 
g) Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
In accordance with the NHLBI requirements the following is the data and safety 
monitoring plan (DSMP):  
Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
The data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will include [CONTACT_914006] and [CONTACT_914007]. One of the members will be appointed the executive secretary (ES).   
DSMB ES is responsible for setting up DSMB meetings, and for generating official, written minutes.   
 The DSMB will review all the Unanticipated Problem Involving Risk to Subjects or 
Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]) .  The DSMB will also re view all the adverse events at 3 time 
points: a) after 10 subjects; b) after 20 subjects; c) after [ADDRESS_1284321] 
completed the protocol and every 6 months after that.   
 
Stoppi [INVESTIGATOR_913974].  
However, due to the potential for increased risk of hypotension, the DSMB will evaluate the number of patients who develop hypotension.   If the DSMB is concerned about the 
number of these adverse clinical events, the DSMB will inform the NHLBI and Mayo IRB 
either that the protocol needs to be modified or enrollment should be suspended.  
 
Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Reporting and Follow -up 
14 
 The followi ng are in accordance with the NHLBI, Office for Human Research Protections 
(OHRP) and Mayo Clinic IRB policies. 
Definitions: 
1) Adverse Event:  As defined by [CONTACT_114810] , an adverse event is any untoward or 
unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign (for 
example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not 
considered related to the subject’s participation in the research. Adverse events 
encompass both physical and psychological harms.  
 2) Serious Adverse Events include those which:  
• Are fatal or life threatening;  
• Result in significant or persistent disability;  
• Require or prolong hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
• Result in a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Represent other significant hazards or potentially serious harm to research 
subjects or others, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_7372].  
 
3) Unanticipated Problem Involving Risk to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]):   
 
Mayo Clinic's IRB and OHRP  defines unanticipated problem/event involving risk to 
subjects or others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]) as any problem or event that was 1) serious; 2) unanticipated; AND 3) at least possibly related to the research procedures.  
 
Serious:  Serious problems/events can be well defined and include death; life 
threatening adverse experience; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity: persistent or significant; birth defect/anomaly; and/or per protocol 
OR may be problems/events that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_913975], safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially 
compromised the research data.  
 Unanticipated:  (unexpected) problems/events are those that are not already described 
as potential risks in the consent form, not listed in the Investigator's Brochure, or not part 
of an underlying disease. A problem/event is "unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable 
at the time of its occurrence. A problem/event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an 
increased frequency or at an increased severity than expected.  
 Related:  A problem/event is "related" if it is possibly, probably or definitely related to the 
research study  
 
Adverse Event Reporting 
All non -serious adverse events (AEs) will include those that occur from randomization 
through 7 days after the completion of the second study day at the CTSA CRU.  
a) Report to DSMB  
 As stated above, the DSMB will also review all the AEs at 3 time points: 
a) after 10 subjects; b) after 20 subjects; c) after [ADDRESS_1284322] completed the 
protocol and every 6 months after that.  
b) Report Mayo IRB  
  All AEs will be reported to the Mayo IRB during the yearly progress report for IRB 
approval.  
 
15 
 c) Report NHLIBI  
 T he AEs will be reported to the NHLBI during the yearly non- competitive 
renewal.  
 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
All serious adverse events (SAEs) will include those that occur from randomization 
through 7 days after the second study day  
a) Report to DSMB  
 If the Serious AE involves death or a life- threatening event the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1318] a contact a  
member of the DSMB within [ADDRESS_1284323] already been taken.  
If the event was definitely related, probably related or possibly related to the study  
intervention, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_913976]  5 days .  The investigator will complete and submit a follow -up report when 
additional relevant information (final diagnosis, outcome, results of specific 
inves tigations, etc.) becomes available.  The investigator will follow all reportable events 
until resolution or stabilization. The DSMB will follow all SAEs until resolution, stabilization, or last patient completes follow up, whichever occurs first.  Any seri ous 
adverse event that is ongoing when a patient completes his/her participation in the trial 
will be followed by [CONTACT_914000]:  
• The event resolves or stabilizes.  
• The event returns to baseline condition or value (if  a baseline value is available).  
 
b) Mayo IRB  
Regardless of causality, the investigator will report Unanticipated SAE to DSMB 
within 5 days  of knowledge of the event to determine the relationship between the event 
and the study intervention. If the event was definitely related, probably related or 
possibly related to the study intervention, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_913977] 5 days   
 
The following section is the Mayo IRB’s policy for handing a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_186636]:

prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate 
hazard to a research subject, the IRB will consider 
whether the changes were consistent with the 
protection of the rights and welfare of subjects.  
 
Reporting to NHLBI  
 In accordance with the NHLBI policy, all investigators conducting clinical studies 
supported by [CONTACT_914004]. The investigator must forward copi[INVESTIGATOR_913988] (expected and unexpected) when they are submitted to the IRB and DSMB. 
Adverse events will be reported in annual reports.  
Expedited reporting  is required for serious adverse events that are unexpected.  
• If the unexpected events are life- threatening or fatal, they should be reported  
within 7 calendar days.    
• All other serious adverse events that are unexpected should be reported within [ADDRESS_1284324] Officer  responsible for the 
study.  
 
INCLUSION OF WOMEN  
It is important to define and understand the difference in the pathophysiology of PSD 
and PDD between women and men.  Every effort will be made to include equal number 
18 
 of male and females in the proposed protocols, with a focus to recruit women from the 
Mayo Women’s Heart  Clinic.  Experience form the Mayo CRU in 1996- 97 showed that 
50% of the [ADDRESS_1284325] Asia.   
Olmsted County census data from 2000 and American Community Survey for [COMPANY_002]ster MN from 2005 -2007, are listed below.  [COMPANY_002]ster city data from July 2007 shows that 
the African American, non- Hispanic population has increased to 4.9% and that the 
Hispanic population has increased to 3.5%. 
Overall Local Figures for Olmsted County Population (percent)- 2000 
Census  
 
Experience in Mayo CRU- based protocols has shown that minority patient’s recruitment 
increased from 2.8% in 1992- 93 to 15.2 % in 1997.  This is in part due to the special 
initiative undertaken to help ensure the participation of underrepresented populations in 
clinical research.  Miriam A. Marquez , Ph.D., Director of the Mayo Clinic office of 
Diversity in Clinical Research, and her staff have focused on improving communication with local minority groups and on the continuous education and involvement of medical 
and paramedical staff on issues regarding diversity.  This has provided measurable success in the local community.   
 Our target enrollment is to recruit approximately [ADDRESS_1284326] 25% of the study population.  We anticipated 
that 50% of the participants would be female, and 50% male. 7% will be Hispanic, 10% Asian, 8% Black not of Hispanic origin and 75% Caucasian.  
 Our primary strategy to achieve our target minority recruitment is to work with the 
medical and paramedical staff of the Diabetes Clinic, Cardiology Clinic, General Internal 
Medicine Clinic and Echocardiography Laboratory to recruit minority subjects.  My clinical study coordinator and research assistant with the help of the Mayo Clinic 
language interpreters will facilitate these efforts.  With the help of [CONTACT_914008] A. Marquez , 
we have developed a complementary community -based educational strategy for 
recruitment of local minority study subjects.  We will also work to establish community 
liaisons with the Multicultural Alliance Network in Olmsted County Minnesota and the 
[COMPANY_002]ster Chinese Cultural Association, to provide connection between the Mayo Clinic 
and minority communities.

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
July 8, [ADDRESS_403783] -stroke individua ls' 
ability to move their arms during and after robot  assisted therapy.  
 
While researchers know that robot assisted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_327299], they do not know how motor  performance is affected over the 
course of minutes or hours. A better  understanding of how robot assisted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_327300].  
 The study will allow us to obtain a detailed understanding of the  performance of the 
device as described above.  
b. Objectives  
Clinicians and researchers cu rrently have a very limited idea of how  to best manage 
motor recovery from stroke. Recent studies have sought  to create robotic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_327301], since physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_327302]. 
While these robotic assisted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_327303], they have often fallen 
short of expectations. One hypothesis  is that rehabilitation doses remain low due to the 
expense and bulk of  robotic devices. We have developed inexpensive, lightweight 
devices to  provide similar assistance that will allow us to (1) examine the effects of a 
single dose of robot assisted therapy and (2) examine to the cumulative effects of multiple doses. The ultimate goal of this  work is to prescribe a program of therapy that 
produces the largest  rehabilitative effects, which is particularly important for patients 
recovering from stroke as they have a limited window of recovery of  about [ADDRESS_403784] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_327304] (e.g., in the  Stanford Neurology & 
Neurological Sciences Clinic) or receiving  rehabi litation services (e.g., in the Stanford 
Physical Medicine &  Rehab Clinic) or stroke survivors from the community who have 
indicated  interest in participating in research studies at Stanford will be  screened (under a 
waiver of authorization for recruitment ) to determine eligibility. During this screening 
process, physicians and  select coordinators may access medical records to check patient 
details against the inclusion/exclusion criteria specified. 
 
Final determination of patient eligibility and approach to inform of  eligibility will only be 
performed by [CONTACT_327313] (e.g.,  physicians).  
 
Once an eligible stroke survivor has agreed to participate, he or she will be placed in 
contact [CONTACT_327314]'s key investigators for a final telephone screening (see 
attachment). If everything is as expected, the subject will be scheduled for sensorimotor 
assessments described below. The study should take approximately 4 hours (including 
breaks),potentially over the course of multiple days. The first assessment will be to assess baseline without the compliant passive arm support and the second will be with the 
compliant  passive arm support. Described in further detail below.  
 The research procedures used in this assessment do not include any  experimental drug 
treatments or patient randomization. All subjects  will receive complete standard of care.  
 When a participant arrives for the first study session, time will firs t be allocated to go 
through the consent document and answer any questions.  
 
Once participants have granted their informed consent, a subset of  non-invasive clinical 
assessments will then be administered by [CONTACT_44518]. These assessment include one or more of the following:  Mini Mental State Exam, Line Bisection Test, Fugl -Meyer 
Assessment  (FMA), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Action Research Arm Test 
(ARAT), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), and simple tests for joint range of  motion 
and visual/tactile neglect.  
 
The sensorimotor assessment evaluates a subject's ability to move the arm to acquire 
targets and range of motion. While subjects are seated,  their arm will be supported 
against gravity by [CONTACT_327315] (described more below) or another 
passive support (also  described in more detail below). Motion will be recorded using an 
optical motion capture system (PhaseSpace). While seated, subjects will be asked to actively move their arm to acquire targets or explore the range of their workspace or will 
be passively moved by [CONTACT_194071].  
 The assessment will be performed using a subset of the following  devices:  
 (1) Mor-Medical Euro Style Rehab Shower Chair: Subjects using the  rigid arm support 
will be seated in a medical -grade rehab shower  chair. The chair's caster wheels allow for 
July 8, [ADDRESS_403785] relative to the linkage; this is necessary for alignment of 
the subject's joints with those of the linkage. The wheels lock in place to secure the 
subject in an aligned position. The chair is adjustable to four discrete heights to 
accommodate subjects of different sizes.  
A chest belt prevents motion of the torso relative to the rigid arm support.  
 (2) PhaseSpace motion -capture system: The motion -capture system  measures the three-
dimensional location in space of specialized  markers. These markers will be strapped to a 
subject to record and  analyze the kin ematics of his/her limbs in space. The data is 
processed and saved remotely by a computer.  
 
(3) Delsys surface EMG system: EMG records muscle activity via skin - mounted 
electrodes; these are passive and non -invasive. The signal  recorded by [CONTACT_327316] a computer.  
 
(4) Passive arm support: As a control for the compliant passive arm  support, participants 
might be asked to perform the same reaching tasks while their arm is supported passively by [CONTACT_327317]. These passive  arm supports will either consist of an arm rest mounted 
on bearings on top of a table such that the arm is free to slide across the table, but participants can rely on the arm rest for support against gravity.  
 Alternatively, the arm rest might be hung fr om the ceiling with high - strength nylon 
chord so that the height of the support can be adjusted while maintaining the low -friction 
gravity support.  
 
(5) Compliant passive arm support: The device consists of two linkages, [ADDRESS_403786] while the upper arm linkage rests under the participant's arm 
and is secured with hook-and -loop fastener. The design of the device, with several 
compliant elements, ensures that one device fits many without joint alignment concerns.  
 Subjects may be asked to perform similar assessments on multiple days to check for 
lingering effects.  
 
Video will be recorded for the study. Video may be processed to extract additional 
motion data, which will extract the relative locations of parts of the body, such as the 
hand, elbow, and shoulder. Any motion data presented from video recordings of the 
motion capture system will thus not include identifiable characteristics. We will also 
record video of participants as they perform the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) in 
accordance with the WMFT protocol. In these WMFT videos, we will use blur the faces 
of all participants. All videos will be archived on an internal lab server. The videos will 
be transferred to a secure encrypted database, RedCap or Stanford's Google Dr ive (only 
researchers on this protocol will have access to the videos). No other people outside the 
study team will have access to the videos.  
 
July 8, [ADDRESS_403787] human skill on the device  will be disinfected 
either two (purple top) Super Sani -Cloth wipes or a UV-C Sanitizing Wand. If the wipes 
are used, the surface will be wiped for a total of two minutes, ensuring the entr ies surface 
is wet the entire time. This will be repeated once more after drying. The device will be 
allowed to air dry for a total of two minutes.  
 We have active and completed protocols that have used similar devices and experimental 
procedures such as "Measurement of Post -Stroke  Sensorimotor Performance" -- which 
uses similar participants, devices,  and techniques as the current application -- and 
"Measurement  of Biomechanical Response to the Use of Robotic Assistance Devices for  
Human Runni ng" -- which uses similar measurement techniques as the current 
application.  
b. Procedure Risks  
Subjects will be recruited from the Stanford Neurology & Neurological  Sciences and 
Physical Medicine & Rehab clinics –  both outpatient, as  well as from Stanford databases 
in which stroke sur vivors from the  community have indicated their interest in 
participating in research  studies. The study will not interfere with patient care; patients 
will be allowed to continue taking any medications and attending therapy over the course 
of the study. Th e study will use non-invasive  measurement techniques to record the 
motion of the subject –  the minimum data need to perform this study.  
 Appropriate cleaning procedures will be utilized to prevent the spread of COVID -19. 
c. Use of Deception in the Study  
No deception will be used.  
d. Use of Audio and Video Recordings  
Video will be recorded for the study. Video may be processed to extract  additional 
motion data, which will extract the relative locations of  parts of the body, such as the 
hand, elbow, and shoulder. Any motion data presented from video recordings of the 
motion capture system will  thus not include identifiable characteristics. We will also 
record video of participants as they perform  the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) in  
accordance with the WMFT protocol. In these WMFT videos, we will use blur the faces 
of all participants. All videos will be archived on an  internal lab server. The videos will 
be transferred to a secure encrypted dat abase, RedCap or Stanford's Google Drive (only 
researchers on this protocol will have access to the videos). No other people outside the 
study team will have access to the videos.  
e. Alternative Procedures or Courses of Treatment  
We are not offering or withholding any standard treatment. Any courses  of treatment 
offered by [CONTACT_327318] & Neurological Sciences  or Physical Medicine & 
Rehab clinics could be adva ntageous to participants.  
 
These range from medication, such as Botox injectio ns for spasticity,  to physical therapy, 
such as targeted movement practice. Given that  participants are recruited from the clinic 
July 8, 2022   Page 5 of 12 and/or are allowed to  continue current medications and physical therapy, it is unlikely 
that there are alternative procedures or treatments known to be beneficial.  
f. Will it be possible to continue the more (most) appropriate therapy for the 
participant(s) after the conclusion of the study?  
Lab-developed devices used in this study  are not intended as treatment but as tools for  
elucidation and quantification of the effects of assistance on  movement. Should subjects 
find an activity performed during our study to be particularly helpful, they can consult 
with their physical or  occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_327305]. 
g. Study Endpoint(s)  
The study is not evaluating treatments.  
3. BACKGROUND  
a. Past Experimental and/or Clinical Findings  
Stroke results from significantly reduced blood supply to part of the  brain and is one of 
the leading causes of long -term adult disability  [1]. Stroke survivors can suffer from a 
large range of negative  effects such as pain, spasticity (continuous contraction of some 
muscles), muscle weakness, hemineglect (unawareness of half of space), and cognitive 
deficits. Some researchers believe that the main cause of  post-stroke motor impairment is 
abnormal muscle co -contractions [2].  These abnormal muscle co -contractions were first 
observed as the coupling of shoulder abductor with elbow flexor muscles and shoulder  
adductor with elbow extensor muscles [3]. Since then, post -stroke  abnormal muscle co -
contraction patterns have been observed for a range  of upper extremity tasks [4], as well 
as for walking [5]. While there  is a highly nonlinear relationship between the 
electromyographical (EMG) signals on which these analyses are based and the resultant 
joint torques, abnormal joint torque couplings have been found that match the  EMG -
based results [6]. These researchers have also demonstrated  substantial improvements in 
motor function, achieved by [CONTACT_327319], which unloads the  shoulder abductor muscles [ 7]. 
 
Many researchers are developi[INVESTIGATOR_327306]- habilitation. A large  number of these robots are 
designed to help users repeatedly perform a  task [8], [9], but this approach might not be 
optimal for stroke rehabilitation [10], [11]. Building on the results from [7], Ellis et  al. 
[12] designed and built an impairment -specific rehabilitation  robot, ACT3D, to provide 
shoulder abduction support. They then administered a therapy in which shoulder 
abduction support was  gradually reduced over a period of eight weeks and found several 
motor  improvements [12], [13]. However, the level of motor recovery is tied to the 
intensity of therapy, and most rehabilitation robots are  expensive, unwieldy devices 
confined to the lab or clinic where  patients have limited access to them.  
 
Many of the robots currently being developed for rehabilitation are  exoskeletal robots. 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_327307] 8, 2022   Page 6 of 12 user's skeleton. These linkages are then attached at various points on the body by [CONTACT_327320].  
 
Motors or hydraulic actuators then actuate these linkages. By [CONTACT_327321]'s skeleton, an exoskeleton transmits many of the forces that would 
otherwise need to be  transmitted through the user's skeleton. Such  exoskeletal robots 
have already been developed for stroke  rehabilitation [8], [12], [13]. These robots show 
promise in taking state-of -the-art rehabilitation out of the clinic. However, there are  many 
difficulties associated with the design and operation of  traditional exoskeletal robots, 
including cost, aligning  operator and  robot joint axes [14], safely handling the mass 
added by [CONTACT_327322], and ensuring stable interactions with human users [15],  [16].  
 
Further, exoskeletal robots might be excessive for tasks that do not  require load -bearing 
beyond the capability of the human skeleton.  To address the problems associated with 
traditional exoskeletal  robots, several groups have recently built soft exosuits that forgo 
rigid linkages and directly apply forces and torques to the user's  skeleton instead. 
Eliminatin g rigid link -ages allows exosuits to be constructed of primarily compliant 
materials that require less precise design and machining, are lightweight, and are 
generally inexpensive.  However, without rigid linkages, applying forces and torques to 
the human body can be difficult. Some designs use inelastic cables intelligently  placed on 
the body and anchor points to transmit loa ds to specific body parts [17], [18]. While these 
designs have proven effective, they  increase the compressive load on the joints. Ano ther 
take on this  approach uses cuffs as attachment points for cables driven by [CONTACT_327323] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_94954] a backpack or offboard) [19], [20].  However, this design requires 
large standoffs to increase the moment  arm across the joint to be actuated that create a 
large device profile and might interfere with objects in the users' environments in daily 
life. Other approaches use pneumatically inflated bladders to  push against two parts of 
the body, causing expansive forces and  moments that extend the joint [21], [22]. Only a 
couple of these  devices currently exist and they tend to focus on simple, single  degree-of -
freedom joints, such as the elbow.  
 
We developed a l ightweight (350 g), inexpensive externally-mounted actuator that 
behaves as a compliant arm support [23]. We constructed a prototype exomuscle by 
[CONTACT_327324] a plastic bladder with a fabric bag  that is sewn to supporting straps. The 
bladder can then be inf lated  with pressurized air to provide expansive forces between the 
user's torso and arm, supporting shoulder abduction. A seam acting as a hinge  joint 
connects the exomuscle to the torso. We demonstrate that our  exomuscle reduces 
muscular effort by 74% in isometric tasks and 72% in  dynamic reaching tasks while 
minimally affecting the range of motion of  the shoulder and elbow (average 4% 
reduction) on three  users ranging from [ADDRESS_403788] ive effects of our device.  In a previous (IRB 
approved) study, we examined the effects of our  device on a stroke subject who 
demonstrated a large increase in  workspace after using our device. We were also 
surprised to find that  he also demonstrated a linge ring benefit after less than [ADDRESS_403789] is common and characterize it.

4. DEVICES  USED IN THE STUDY  
a. Investigational Devices (Including Commercial Devices Used Off -Label) 
Investigational  Device 1  
Name:  [CONTACT_327332]:  The device consists of two  linkages, [ADDRESS_403790]  while the upper arm linkage  rests 
under the  participant's arm and is secured with  hook-and-loop fastener. 
The design of the  device, with several compliant elements,  ensures that 
one device fits  many without  joint alignment concerns. No motors or 
other actuators add energy into the  system, meaning th at it is stable.

above  inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
k. Planned Duration of the Study  
The total study will last no more than 2 years, including the analysis of participant data. For each participant in the study: (i) 30- minute screening (in clinic & over phone), (ii) 4-
hour active participation spread over two visits, (iii) we expect data analysis to require a 
month dedicated time including developi[INVESTIGATOR_327311] – data analysis 
does not require involvement of the participant.  
6. RISKS 
a. Potential Risks  
i. Procedures 
As described, assessments require subjects to either actively move their arm within their reachable workspace (e.g., to acquire a target). There are no risks associated with these 
procedures.  
ii. Physical well-being  
Physical fatigue from repeated movement. There will be frequent scheduled breaks, in

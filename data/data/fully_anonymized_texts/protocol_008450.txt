Seborrheic Dermatitis Ruxolitinib Cream Protocol
Incyte IIR
March 25, 20223BACKGROUND:
Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a very common skin condition affecting tens of millions of 
Americans, with over $300 million spent annually on over-the-counter treatment 
products (1, 2). Clinically, it is characterized by [CONTACT_426769], yellowish scaly plaques in 
the scalp, eyebrows, ears, forehead, nasolabial folds, chest, axillae, and inguinal areas 
(3). The pathophysiology of SD is not well understood, with three general factors 
believed to play a role: Malassezia colonization, increased production of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_426750], and immune abnormalities (4). SD is also more common in men, 
implicating androgens as a contributing factor. Current clear treatment guidelines are 
lacking, with some evidence to support topi[INVESTIGATOR_323754] (5) and broad-acting topi[INVESTIGATOR_247024]-inflammatory treatments such as steroids and calcineurin inhibitors (6), and non-
pharmacological approaches also used (7). That these treatments have been shown to 
be better than placebo support the contributions of both Malassezia and immune 
dysregulation in the pathophysiology of the disease. However, as long-term use of 
steroids is contraindicated, alternative topi[INVESTIGATOR_426751] (8, 9). The immune dysregulation underlying SD has not been well 
characterized, but upregulation of several cytokines and cytokine pathways have been 
suggested, including Th1, Th2, Th17, (i.e., IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-
12, IL-17, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) (10-12). Furthermore, treatment of SD with anti-
inflammatory agents such as crisaborole has shown some promise in early studies (9).
TREATMENT RATIONALE:
Current treatments for SD center around topi[INVESTIGATOR_323754], based on the role that 
Malassezia is believed to play in disease pathogenesis, and anti-inflammatory agents 
such as topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826], which are broad-acting and cannot be applied chronically due to 
the risk of multiple side effects (11). The pathogenesis of SD is poorly understood, but 
dysregulated immune markers from different pathways have been suggested, including 
Th1, Th2, Th17, (i.e., IL-1α, IL-1β,  IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, TNF-α, and 
IFN-γ).
Ruxolitinib is an inhibitor JAK1 and JAK2 signaling, which suppresses the majority of the 
proposed SD-related cytokines simultaneously. In experimental models of dermatitis, 
ruxolitinib cream successfully reduced itch and down-regulated multiple inflammatory 
pathways (13). Although modulation of molecular biomarkers with application of ruxolitinib 
cream is lacking in humans, clinical efficacy has been shown in the Th2-driven disease 
atopic dermatitis in phase 2 (14) and phase 3 (15) studies, demonstrating the ability to 
normalize the pathogenic immune dysregulation in atopic dermatitis as well as in a phase 
2 study of vitiligo (16), in which Th1 signaling is believed to play a major role. Furthermore 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_426752] [e.g., crisaborole (9)] have 
been used in small studies, supporting this approach.
Therefore, we hypothesize that topi[INVESTIGATOR_426753], leading to clinical improvement.

Incyte IIR
March 25, 20226At Baseline/Week 0, subjects will undergo clinical assessments (clinical SD Severity 
Score and IGA), review of concomitant medications, standardized clinical photography, 
and a Dermatology Life Quality index (DLQI) questionnaire (Appendix 2). Subsequent 
clinical assessments including standardized clinical photography, and questionnaire 
completion will be performed at follow up visits at Week 2, Week 4, and Week 6. Skin 
tape-strip samples will be collected for mechanistic studies (described below) at baseline 
(lesional and non-lesional facial skin), Week 2 (lesional facial skin), Week 4 (lesional facial 
skin), and Week 6 (lesional facial skin). Additional blood samples will be collected and 
stored at baseline and at Week 4 (or early termination, whichever is first) for potential 
future mechanistic analyses.
Control Subjects:
At Baseline/Week 0, subjects will undergo a review of concomitant medications, skin 
tape-strip samples will be collected for mechanistic studies (described below) of non-
lesional facial skin, blood and urine sample collection for standard laboratory testing, and 
a blood sample for possible future mechanistic analyses.
MECHANISTIC ANALYSES:
We will characterize the molecular immune profiles of patients with SD at week 0 and 
week 4, with comparison to baseline profiles in healthy control subjects.
We plan to obtain lesional and non-lesional tape strip samples from facial skin of SD 
patients at week 0 and lesional facial skin samples at Week 4 (Primary Endpoint). 
Additionally, lesional facial skin samples will be collected at Week 2 and Week 6 and 
stored for potential future analysis. Blood samples at baseline and at Week 4 will be 
collected and stored for potential future analysis.
Gene expression studies on tape strip samples will be performed using Illumina NovaSeq 
6000 for RNA-seq, and proteomic studies on tape strip samples will be performed using 
the Olink Explore panel, which includes >1,500 protein analytes.

POTENTIAL RISKS OF RUXOLITINIB 1.5% CREAM:
Based on phase 2 and phase 3 studies in atopic dermatitis, as well as phase 2 studies in 
vitiligo, topi[INVESTIGATOR_426757] 1.5% cream shows a good safety profile. The most 
commonly experienced adverse events in the atopic dermatitis studies were application 
site burning and pruritus, which occurred more commonly in the vehicle control group 
(15). These results were mirrored in the phase 2 vitiligo study, with the additional 
observation of 18% of vitiligo patients experienced development of acne as a treatment-
related adverse event (16). Although oral ruxolitinib has been associated with the risk of 
hematologic abnormalities in patients treated for polycythemia vera or myelofibrosis, 
pharmacokinetic analysis performed in the phase 3 studies in atopic dermatitis patients 
with up to 20% body surface area involvement demonstrated plasma ruxolitinib 
concentrations substantially lower than those required for systemic activity (17).

attachments.
All adverse event information is reported to Incyte on the Principal 
Investigator’s/Institution’s Adverse Event Report Form, or a CIOMS-I or MedWatch 
Form FDA 3500A, or on an Adverse Event Report Form which may be provided by 
[CONTACT_304307]. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_109904] (e.g., 
discharge summary) to Incyte, unless specifically requested.
 
Reporting of Pregnancy to Incyte
An “Initial Pregnancy Report” or equivalent must be completed in full and emailed to 
[EMAIL_2174] or faxed to (+) [PHONE_2518] within [ADDRESS_539382].  The “Follow-up Pregnancy Report Form” 
or equivalent must be completed and emailed to [EMAIL_2174] or faxed 
to (+) [PHONE_2518] within 30 days after delivery, so that Incyte is provided with 
information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy.  If the pregnancy results in any 
events which meet the serious criteria (i.e., miscarriage or termination), the SAE reporting 
process needs to be followed and the timelines associated with a SAE should be followed.
SUBJECT IDENTIFICATION
Subjects are numbered sequentially. Each subject will be assigned a unique screening 
number for the duration of the study. Subject screening numbers will not be reassigned 
or reused for any reason. The investigator must maintain a master log linking the subject 
number to the subject’s name. The investigator must follow all applicable privacy laws in 
order to protect a subject’s privacy and confidentiality.

Seborrheic Dermatitis Ruxolitinib Cream Protocol
Incyte IIR
March 25, 202216Eligible patients will receive a supply of ruxolitinib 1.5% cream which they will apply to 
affected skin on the face only twice daily. Patients will be instructed not to use more than 
60g of cream per week.
All study medication will be stored in a secure cool area between 15-30°C. Study drug will 
be provided to subjects at each study visit, with initial application performed at that time 
and subsequent applications performed by [CONTACT_148868]. 
Subjects will be queried during each study visit on any missed applications.
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
Sample Size Calculation
A sample size of n=20 SD patients guarantees 90% power at 2.1% significance to detect 
a minimum proportion of 75% of patients with IGA 0/[ADDRESS_539383] with a null hypothesis proportion of 40%. 
This proportion is based on the vehicle response benchmark reported by [CONTACT_426774].(2021)  when comparing IGA 0/[ADDRESS_539384] foam 
0.3% vs. 72 patients in the vehicle-controlled group(18). Accounting for a 20% dropout 
rate, we, therefore, propose a sample size of n=[ADDRESS_539385] study to evaluate differences in the 
transcriptome between SD and healthy subjects. A previous study (19) evaluated a fold-
change (FCH) of 5 in IL-10 cell counts with coefficient of variation of 50% when comparing 
10 SD subjects to 4 healthy volunteers. Assuming similar variability, a sample size of n = 
20 SD subjects and n= 20 controls would provide 90% power at 5% significance to detect 
FCH>2.[ADDRESS_539386] will be used to verify the hypothesis that the proportion of 
patients achieving IGA 0/1 at 4 weeks of treatment with ruxolitinib 1.5% cream applied 
twice daily is greater than 0.4.
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
The two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test will assess the significance of changes from 
baseline in:

Seborrheic Dermatitis Ruxolitinib Cream Protocol
Incyte IIR
March 25, 202217IGA score at 4 weeks of treatment
Components of clinical SD scoring (scale, erythema, and pruritus) at [ADDRESS_539387] will assess the significance of changes from baseline in: 
Overall clinical SD scoring at 4 and 6 weeks of treatment.
Vital signs measured in interval or ratio scale 
Analytes measured in interval or ratio scale from laboratory tests 
(hematology, serum, chemistry, and urinalysis) at 4 weeks of treatment
The p-values will be adjusted by [CONTACT_426775]. The frequency, duration, and 
severity of AEs will be summarized with tables and summary statistics.
Analysis of Mechanistic (Exploratory) Endpoints
The baseline immune and molecular cutaneous profile of SD at baseline compared with 
healthy controls and the change in the immune and molecular cutaneous profile of SD 
with treatment will be assessed by [CONTACT_426776]. Gene/Protein expression data will 
be modeled using a mixed effect model with the interaction between tissue type (non-
lesional/ lesional / healthy) and timepoint as fixed effects and a random effect for each 
subject. 
RNA-sequencing data will be profiled by [CONTACT_426777] 6000. RNA-sequencing data 
will be pre-processed using standard quality control metrics, such as FastQC and 
MultiQC, sequence alignment by [CONTACT_426778]-sequencing aligner and sequencing reads 
assignment to genomic features by [CONTACT_426779], followed by [CONTACT_426780]-transform. Mixed 
effect models will be used on R’s limma framework and p-values for the moderated t-tests 
and paired-t-test will be adjusted by [CONTACT_418683]-Hochberg procedure. Extensive 
bioinformatics tools will be employed to gain insights into the results. This will include (but 
will not be limited to) pathway and gene-set enrichment analyses by R package GSVA 
(Gene Set Variation Analysis) and by [CONTACT_426781] (XGR) that uses prior 
biological knowledge and relationships from public databases.
We will perform proteomic biomarker studies in serum using the OLINK high-throughput 
proteomic platform, with the Explore panel that evaluates >1,500 protein analytes. Protein 
expression data will be modeled using a MMRM approach, with the interaction of study 
group (treatment /control) and timepoint as fixed effects and a random effect for each 
subject.
We will use the Spearman coefficient to correlate: 1) molecular markers with disease 
activity in SD at baseline; 2) changes from baseline in molecular markers with changes 
from baseline in IGA and overall clinical SD scoring at [ADDRESS_539388]-protected files.

March 25, 202218Data from the Guttman Lab (where all mechanistic studies will be done), including 
sequencing data and proteomics will be deposited in the Mount Sinai Box, which has the 
necessary safeguards for protection of human subjects research.
All data management steps taken to reformat and merge the clinical and laboratory data 
will be carried out using R codes, so all the steps of the processes can be reproduced. 
Management of the Analysis 
Analyses will be run in our desktops, with a backed-up copy in the Mount Sinai Box 
account. Once the analysis is finalized, all data will be deposited into the central file 
storage system (CFS), which is accessible to all research members. Both Mount Sinai 
Box and the CFS have backup capabilities and are encrypted and password protected. 
Analysis of Safety and Tolerability
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_220131] (AEs) and will be presented with 
descriptive statistics at each visit. AEs will be coded using the CTCAE, Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, V 5.0. The number and percentage of 
subjects/lesions experiencing an AE/SAE will be stratified by [CONTACT_9313], or a 
preferred term, and/or severity of the adverse event, and recorded and tabulated overall 
by [CONTACT_199231]-strata. Each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class 
or a preferred term using the adverse events with the highest severity within each 
category. All information pertaining to adverse events noted during the study will be listed 
by [CONTACT_1130], detailing verbatim given by [CONTACT_093], preferred term, system organ 
class, date of onset, date of resolution, severity, and relationship to treatment. A 
tabulation of AEs will be provided by [CONTACT_1130]. 
DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index)
The DLQI is a validated questionnaire consisting of 10 questions that has been used in 
many randomized controlled trials in dermatology (20, 21).
Scoring
The scoring of each question is as follows:
Very much scored 3
A lot scored 2
A little scored 1
Not at all scored 0
Not relevant scored 0

March 25, 202219The DLQI is calculated by [CONTACT_426782]. The maximum score is 
30 and minimum score is 0. Higher score represents a quality of life that is more 
impaired.
Definition of DLQI Scores
0-1 = no effect at all on patient's life 
2-5 = small effect on patient's life 
6-10 = moderate effect on patient's life 
11-20 = very large effect on patient's life 
21-30 = extremely large effect on patient's life
A change in DLQI score of at least 4 points is considered clinically important (22). Such 
change suggests that there has actually been a meaningful change in that patient's 
quality of life since the previous measurement of his/her DLQI scores.Question unanswered scored 0

patients provides 95% power at 5% significance to detect a minimum average 
improvement in IGA of 42.5% with the application of a two-sided paired t-test. Accounting 
for a 20% dropout rate, we, therefore, propose a sample size of n=25 patients.”

dropout rate, we, therefore, propose a sample size of n=25 patients. “

Revised from “A Mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression model will be used to test 
differences in IGA between time points with time (Weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6) as a fixed effect, 
a random intercept for subjects, and inclusion of baseline characteristics as covariates. “
To: “The one-sided binomial test will be used to verify the hypothesis that the proportion 
of patients achieving IGA 0/1 at 4 weeks of treatment with ruxolitinib 1.5% cream applied 
twice daily is greater than 0.4.

Revised from: “The mixed-effects model for continuous outcomes will also be used to 
detect any overall changes in clinical SD scoring over time compared with baseline with 
time (Weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6) as a fixed effect, a random intercept for subjects, and potential 
covariates. Changes in each component of the SD Severity Score, will also be evaluated 
using the same approach.” 
To: “The two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test will assess the significance of changes from 
baseline in:  
IGA score at 4 weeks of treatment
Components of clinical SD scoring (scale, erythema, and pruritus) at [ADDRESS_539398] will assess the significance of changes from baseline in: 
Overall clinical SD scoring at 4 and 6 weeks of treatment.
Vital signs measured in interval or ratio scale 
Analytes measured in interval or ratio scale from laboratory tests (hematology, 
serum, chemistry, and urinalysis) at 4 weeks of treatment
The p-values will be adjusted by [CONTACT_426775]. The frequency, duration, and 
severity of AEs will be summarized with tables and summary statistics.”

Revised from: “The baseline immune and molecular cutaneous profile of SD at baseline 
compared with healthy controls and the change in the immune and molecular cutaneous 
profile of SD with treatment will be assess by [CONTACT_426776]. Gene/Protein expression 
data will be modeled using a mixed effect model with tissue type and time as a fixed effect 
and a random effect for each subject.”
To: “The baseline immune and molecular cutaneous profile of SD at baseline compared 
with healthy controls and the change in the immune and molecular cutaneous profile of 
SD with treatment will be assessed by [CONTACT_426776]. Gene/Protein expression data 
will be modeled using a mixed effect model with the interaction between tissue type (non-
lesional/ lesional / healthy) and timepoint as fixed effects and a random effect for each 
subject.”
Revised from: “We will perform proteomic biomarker studies in serum using the OLINK 
high-throughput proteomic platform, with the Explore panel that evaluates >1,[ADDRESS_539399].”
To: “We will perform proteomic biomarker studies in serum using the OLINK high-
throughput proteomic platform, with the Explore panel that evaluates >1,500 protein

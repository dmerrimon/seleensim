EX-MKTG -151 ALPACA Protocol v1.4 15Sep2023 9 2 INTRODUCTION 
The Avaira Vitality ™ (CooperVis ion Inc. US), also known as Serenity ™ (CooperVis ion Inc. 
Canada) has been on the market for some time, however its performance has not been  evaluated 
in comparison to other monthly replacement lenses  that have more rec ently been introduced. The 
goal of this study  is to determine  the performance of  Avaira Vitality ™/ Serenity ™ (Lens A),  a SiHy  
monthly replacement  lens from CooperVision Inc., and compare it with  TOTAL30® (Lens B), a 
SiHy monthly replacement lens  from Alcon  Inc.  
3 OBJECTIVES  
To compare the clinical performance of Avaira Vitality ™/ Serenity ™ versus TOTAL30® in habitual 
spherical soft lens wearers, when worn for 1- month  each in a double- masked, randomized 
crossover study design.  
The prim ary outcome variable for this study is: 
• Lens handling on removal (0- 100 scale) collected on Day [ADDRESS_1209858]/second month for each p articipant . Participants  will be randomized immediately prior to their 
first lens dispense.  
EX-MKTG -151 ALPACA Protocol v1.4 15Sep2023 10 This randomization schedule will be generated for each site using a web- based program: 
(www.randomization.com ). The lens type that will be worn dur i ng the first month  is called “ Lens 
type #1”, the lens type dispended for the second month  is called “ Lens type #2”. The final study 
randomization schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_94648] ’s Database Administrator  and provided to 
the research assistants at each site.  
5.1.3 MASKING  
This study will be double masked i.e. participants and investigators will be masked to the lens 
type dispensed. In order to achieve this, unmasked research assistants will determine the lens order according to the randomization schedule (see section 5.1.2) and will over -label the lens 
packages/foils prior to dispense by [CONTACT_234987]/foils to 
mask the participant and investigator to the lens brand. At the fitting visit both lens types will be 
fit, but only the participant will be masked to the lens type during this process . During the lens 
wear phases both investigators and participants will be masked . 
5.2 INVESTIGATIONAL  SITES  
5.2.1 NUMBER OF SITES  
This study will be conducted in three to four optometry practice sites  in the US  and/or Canada, 
depending on their ability to recruit sufficient number of participants. The exact site locations and 
names of the principal Investigators will be listed in the final study report. 
5.2.2 INVESTIGA T OR RECRUITMENT  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_94620]:  
• Is a licensed Optometrist with at least two years of contact [CONTACT_305760].  
• Can demonstrate training in Good Clinical Practice (GCP) by [CONTACT_94632].  
• Accepts responsibility for the conduct of the study at their site. 
• Has in -office email and either document scanning capabilities or fax. 
• Will scan and upload all study visit documents to CORE, ideally the same day* as the 
visit or at most within 2 days of the study visit.  
• Is willing to follow the study protocol and to co- operate with the study monitors at 
CORE.  
* Study documents are required as soon as possible because this allows for  a timely d ata 
review, query and entry.  
EX-MKTG -151 ALPACA Protocol v1.4 15Sep2023 11 5.3 STUDY POPULATION 
5.3.1 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION  
The data for subjective responses for ease lens handling for lens removal when reflecting on a 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_5707], collected at the 1- month visits: standard deviation of paired differences was 1.7 (0-
10 scale) was transformed to a standard deviation of 17 on the planned 0 -100 scale for this 
study. 90% power is achieved with a minimum sample size of [ADDRESS_1209859] prior to removal when reflecting on a typi[INVESTIGATOR_5707], collected at the 1- month visits: standard deviation of 
paired differences was 2.2 and 2.3 (0- 10 scale) was transformed to a standard deviation of 22 
and 23 on the planned 0 -100 scale for this study. 80% power is achieved with a minimum 
sample size of 45 and 44 participants.  
It was therefore decided to move ahead with minimum sample of 45 in order to exceed that required for the primary outcome variable, and also provide sufficient sample related to comfort 
variables.  To allow for drop- out and possible protocol deviations, up to 52 participants may be 
dispensed with study products.

5.3.2 NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS  
Participants will be recruited using site records, databases and advertising materials ( e.g., 
posters, email scripts) approved by [CONTACT_516155]. All initial individual -targeted 
recruitment activities, such as any direct mailing of recruitment scripts, will be conducted by 
[CONTACT_234988]. This separation will 
reduce any undue influence of the optometrist -patient relationship. This process will also 
eliminate opportunity for the investigator to access personal health information before any 
consent for disclosure is provided by [CONTACT_52764].

5.3.3 INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
A person is eligible for inclusion in the study if he/she:  
1. Is at least 18  years of age and no older than 3 9 years, and has full legal capacity to 
volunteer ; 
2. Has read and signed an information consent letter; 
3. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule;  
4. Self-reports  having a full eye examination in the previous two years; 
5. Has healthy eyes with no  health condition or medication that contra- indicate contact [CONTACT_94638], in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] ; 
6. Anticipates being able to wear the study lenses for at least 8 hours a day, 6 days a week;  
7. Habitually wears spherical soft contact [CONTACT_13276], for the past 3 months minimum:  
It is preferred that all participants are habitual frequent replacement lens wearers. 
However, if this is not possible then no more than [ADDRESS_1209861] be habit ual frequent replacement lens 
wearers;  
- For the frequent replacement wearers: No more than 3 can be habitual wearers of 
the Avaira Vitality ™/ Serenity ™ brand (or their equivalent private label brand name) 
and no more than 3 can be habitual wearers of TOTAL30® can be enrolled at each 
site; 
8. Has refractive astigmatism no higher than -0.75D C in each eye ; 
9. Can be fit and achieve binocular distance vision  of at least 20/30 Snellen ( Available lens 
parameters are sphere +6.00 to -6.00D , 0.25D steps ). 
A person will be excluded from the study if he/she:  
1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study ; 
2. Has any known active * ocular disease and/or infection that contraindicates contact [CONTACT_94638] ; 
3. Has a  systemic or ocular condition that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_94621]  a

* For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection  or inflammation which 
requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered clinically relevant) lid abnormalities  (blepharit is, 
meibomian gland dysfunction, papi[INVESTIGATOR_1257]), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered 
active ocular disease.  Neovascularization and corneal scars  are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or 
inflammation and are therefore not active.  
 
The upper age limit of [ADDRESS_1209863] to eliminate the influence of presby[CONTACT_19555] (age -related 
difficulties focusing at close range) on eye strain with extended close work or digital device use.  
Pregnant and lactating women are not being excluded from the study due to safety concerns but 
due to fl uctuations in refractive error, accommodation and/ or visual acuity that occur secondary 
to systemic hormonal changes  and water retention. It has further been shown that pregnancy 
could impact tear production, which could impact dry eye symptoms. Such fl uctuations could 
affect data, thereby [CONTACT_512385]. 
5.4 STUDY MATERIALS  
Each site will be provided with an inventory of Lens A  which will be used for fitting and 
dispensing of Lens A.   
For Lens B , the clinical sites will pre -order two commercial 6-packs in each prescription in the 
range -0.25 to - 6.00 inclusively in 0.25D steps and one commercial 6-pack in each prescr iption 
in the range +0.25 to +6.[ADDRESS_1209864] two hours  that day . If this is not the case and the participant  is not 
experiencing any problems  with the lenses, the appointment will be rescheduled, ideally within 
the visit window.   
Visits that fall outside of the specified visit windows will be designated as protocol deviations and at the end of the study, the data collected during protocol deviations  will be assessed for their 
suitability to be included in the analysis population.

cost to them. The contact [CONTACT_512387]. This study will investigate participants’ wearing schedule intended for daily wear (NOT extended wear) , similar to the average wearing time of 10 -16 hours for daily wear lenses.  
All lenses used in this study are IDE exempt under 21 CFR 812.2(c )2. The two study contact [CONTACT_528715]; on a daily wear basis with monthly replacement.  
When contact [CONTACT_512389] a daily wear basis there is a small risk of an adverse event compared to not wearing contact [CONTACT_13276]. When contact [CONTACT_720004], there is a significantly increased risk of an adverse reaction compared with wearing contact 
[CONTACT_35491] a daily wear basis.  
Adverse events and/ or complications in daily wear of  soft contact [CONTACT_94652]  (e.g. 
inflammation and infection).  Complications that may occur during the wearing of contact [CONTACT_94653], dryness, aching or itching eyes, excessive tearing, discharge, hyperemia and variable or blurred vision.  More serious risks may include pain, photophobia, iritis, corneal edema or eye infection. Although contact [CONTACT_13293] -related infections are very infrequent, the possibility does 
exist.  The incidence of infection due to day -wear soft lenses is 0.035%. Almost always an infection 
will occur only in one eye.  This risk is assumed by 35- million Americans who currently wear 
contact [CONTACT_528716].  
A dye (fluorescein) normally used for eye examinations is being used in this study. Although rare, it is possible to have an allergic reaction to the dye. Participants will be asked if they  have  a 
known al lergy or sensitivity to fluorescein.  
The assessments conducted in this study are r outine clinical procedures  and they includ e auto-
refraction, auto- keratometry, visual acuity, anterior ocular health assessment, and contact [CONTACT_94654]. In addition, high magnification imaging of the lens fit may be made using [ADDRESS_1209872] lens wear and may occasionally reduce wearing time. These 
are not reported as adverse events unless in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_154119], severe or have a high rate of occurrence.

An adverse event form will be completed for each adverse event. If both eyes are involved, a 
separate adverse event form will be completed for each eye. Whenever possible, the adverse 
event will be photo- documented.  
Expenses incurred for medical treatment as part of study participation will be paid by [CONTACT_456] (bills and prescription receipts kept). The participant must be followed until resolution or no further 
change is anticipated and/or referred for further care with the appropriate health care professional 
and/or recorded as being under appropriate health care as per investigator’s discretion. A written 
report will be completed indicating the subsequent treatment and resolution of the condition.  
8.3 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
All potential Serious and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects that are related or possibly related to participant’s participation will be reported to CORE’s lead study coordinator  (details below) and 
also to the sponsor (details below) within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event. The site’s Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_94623] 10 days of 
becoming aware of the Serious or Unanticipated event, using the Reportable Events Form. All 
fatal or life -threateni ng events will be reported immediately to the IRB.  
Significant and Non- Significant Adverse Events will be reported to CORE’s lead study coordinator  
and the sponsor as soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days after becoming aware of 
the occurrence.

9 DISCONTINUATION FROM THE STUDY  
Participants may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor in consideration of participant safety or protocol compliance, or at discretion of the participant.  Participants discontinued from a study will be reimbursed for their active involvement in the study (including the initia l screening visit  and all lens fitting visits) as per the information on the consent letter .  
Upon discontinuing, a participant will be offered the option of their data being withdrawn from future statistical analysis. The following is a list of possible reasons for discontinuation from the study:  
• Screening failure: Participants will be discontinued if they do not meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria outlined in section 5.2.3. 
• Unacceptable performance with products to be used in study: Participants may  be 
discontinued if they are unable to achieve acceptable comfort and /or vision with the 
study products.  
• Positive slit lamp finding: Participants may be permanently discontinued from the study 
depending on the severity of the condition and on the judgemen t of the investigator.   

EX-MKTG -151 ALPACA Protocol v1.4 15Sep2023 32 • Adverse event: If a participant experiences an adverse event during the study, they may 
be discontinued based on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Symptoms: If the participant has persistent symptoms, they may be discontinued based 
on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Disinterest, relocation or illness: The participant may choose to discontinue due to 
reasons within or beyond their control.  
• Violation of protocol or non- compliance:  The participant will be discontinued if they are 
unable or unwilling to follow the protocol specified visit schedules and/or study procedures.  
• Instillation of topi[INVESTIGATOR_94625]:  The participant will be discontinued if they elect to use a topi[INVESTIGATOR_867205] a limited duration (less than two weeks) to treat a transient condition; in this case the participant may remain an active participant (at the discretion of the investigator) after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_94627]).  
• Lost to follow -up:  The participant will be discontinued if they cannot be contact[CONTACT_867207], and if the investigator has made a reasonable effort to contact [CONTACT_94656] a final study visit.  
• Premature termination of the study by [CONTACT_456], CORE or Sterling IRB.  
A discontinuation form, stating the reason for discontinuation will be completed, which requires 
the signatures of both the participant and the investigator except where the participant is lost to follow- up in which case only the signature [CONTACT_94669].    
When a participant chose to discontinue from the study, they will be given the opportunity to withdraw their data from the statistical analysis. This choice will be captured on the discontinuation 
form.  
All discontinuations including their reasons will be included in the final report.

12 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MANAGEMENT  
12.1 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
All data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_867208].  Unmasked data analysis will be conducted using Statistica 14.0, Statsoft or other suitable software.  Descriptive statistics will be provided on demographic data (age, gender, refractive error distribution, etc.). Table [ADDRESS_1209875] will be used to analyze the results for the count data of 
subjective preferences and experience responses. Where relevant, the number of “no 
preference” responses will be evenly distributed to the two options on the basis they would be 
equally likely to choose either.  
For assessments conducted for each eye separately, the right eye will be  used for analysis. If a 
general difference  is found (paired t -test / Wilcoxon matched pairs) between OD and OS, a 
comment will be  provided. 
EX-MKTG -[ADDRESS_1209876] been recorded in the source documents. Only relevant and applicable comments will be included in the final report as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_94648]’s Lead Co -ordinator.  
13 PROTOCOL & OTHER TRAINING  
All stu dy personnel will be required to complete training prior to their involvement in the study. 
Records of training will be kept at CORE. This will include training by [CONTACT_234992], study procedures, informed consent procedures, and on the randomization and participant masking procedures, as well as training for Good Clinical Practice.  
All site Principal Investigators and co -investigators will provide a scan of their curriculum vitae, 
license to practice optometry and evidence of professional indemnity insurance.  
14 STUDY MONITORING  
Each site will provide regular status reports to CORE. Status reports will include:  
• The number of participants screened, enrolled, and randomized (i.e. assigned a study ID 
number), discontinued and completed.  
• Details of all protocol deviations, adverse events, device malfunctions . 
• Reports of unintended events.

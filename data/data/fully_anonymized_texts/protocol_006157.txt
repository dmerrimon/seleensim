1 PROTOCOL SUMMARY
1.1 Synopsis
Protocol Title: A Phase 3, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind clinical study of 
pembrolizumab (MK -3475) with or without lenvatinib (E7080/MK -7902) to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib as 1L intervention in a PD -L1 selected 
population of participants with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma (R/M HNSCC) (LEAP -010).
Short Title: A Phase 3 study of pembrolizumab (MK -3475) with or without lenvatinib 
(E708 0/MK -7902) as 1L intervention in a PD -L1 selected population with R/M HNSCC 
(LEAP -010)
Acronym: LEAP -010
Hypotheses, Objectives, and Endpoints:
Hypotheses are aligned with objectives in the Objectives and Endpoints table.
Inmales and females who are at le ast 18 years old ,with a histologically confirmed diagnosis 
of R/M HNSCC that is biomarker positive ( combined positive score ( CPS ≥1)), and who are 
considered incurable by [CONTACT_113765][INVESTIGATOR_113732].
Throughout this protocol, the term R ECIST 1.[ADDRESS_126919] 1.1 to 
include a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Refer 
to Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 for further details.
NOTE: Based on the data from an interim safety and efficacy analysis for LEAP -010(data 
cutoff 30-May-2023 ),the study will be discontinued based on a lack of additional clinical 
benefit on overall survival ( OS)of the combination of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib over 
pembrolizumab monotherapy. At this interim analysis, the combination did not demonstrate 
an improvement in OS versus pembrolizumab alon e, and the likelihood of reaching the 
protocol specified threshold for statistical significance for OS at a future analysis was 
evaluated and deeme d to be low. Based upon these data, the study was unblinded on
16-Aug-[ADDRESS_126920] interim analysis and final analysis of the study 
described in the SAP will not be performed. Safety analysis will be performed at the end of 
the study; there will be no further planned analyses for efficacy and ePRO endpoints.
NOTE: In alignment with the study -specific investigator letter dated 25 -Aug-2023 , all study 
participants still receiving pembrolizumab should continue to receive pembrolizumab 
monotherapy on study and undergo modified protocol study procedures as specified in this 
amendment. Study participation should end after the 30 -day Safety Follow -up Visit (last 
scheduled visit) with the following exceptions: participants who are potential candidates for 
Second Course treatment will continue in Efficacy Follow -up and all participants in China 
will continue in Efficacy Follow -up and Survival Follow -up.All participants should stop 
ongoing treatment with lenvatinib/placebo.

monotherapy. Participants who are considered by [CONTACT_113766] 35 cycles of pembrolizu mab and lenvatinib 
require a separate communication with the Sponsor. Participants who discontinue 
pembrolizumab prior to completion of Cycle 35 (eg, due to an AE) must discontinue 
lenvatinib at the same time.
All participants beyond the 30 -day Safety Foll ow-up Visit (except participants who are 
potential candidates for Second Course treatment and all participants in China) should be 
discontinued from the study; however standard safety reporting should continue, as 
applicable. As of Amendment 05, participan ts who are still on study treatment will no longer 
require ePRO assessments or tumor response assessments by [CONTACT_113767]. Scans 
will no longer be submitted to the iCRO. (Note: tumor response assessments by [CONTACT_113768].) Participants who 
are still on study medication should continue tumor imaging and investigator assessments of 
imaging per protocol. Biomarker specimen collection is discontinued. The [ADDRESS_126922] required visit (except forparticipants who are potential candidates 
for Second Course treatment and allparticipants in China ). Updated analyses are described in 
Section 9.

2 INTRODUCTION
Pembrolizumab, a PD -1 inhibitor, in combination with lenvatinib, an anti -angiogenic 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, are being investigated for participants eligible for 1L treatment of 
R/M HNSCC in this randomized, international, parallel design, doub le-blind, Phase [ADDRESS_126986] often from the oral cavity, the oropharynx, the hypopharynx, and the larynx [Dorsey, K. 
2013] . More than 90% of head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, originating 
from the epi[INVESTIGATOR_113733] [Gupta, B., et al 
2016] . Head and neck cancers are the ninth most common mali gnancy in the world with high 
mortality rates in developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696] (age -standardized mortality rates of 7.9 and 2.2 per 
100,000 in males and females, respectively) [Gupta, B., et al 2016] .
More than 90% of pa rticipants with HNSCC initially present with disease confined to the 
head and neck mucosa and/or to the regional cervical lymph nodes [Machiels, J. P. 2011] . 
Surgery and radiation therapy are markedly effective for participants with Stage I and II 
disease. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_113734], approximately 50% to 60% of 
participants with locally advanced Stage III or Stage IV HNSCC recur initially with 
locoregional disease. However, a significant prop ortion of these participants ultimately have 
incurable disease recurrence requiring palliative systemic treatment. The prognosis for 
participants with R/M HNSCC is dismal and OS is less than 1 year [Argiris, A., et al 2017] .
Participants with R/M HNSCC present a therapeutic challenge. First -line treatment generally 
includes the combination of either cetuximab or docetaxel with a platinum -based 
chemotherapy with or without 5 -FU. Participants who are asymptomatic u sually are treated 
with monotherapy to balance the side -effects associated with combination regimens. Options 
for 1L single -agent treatment include platinum, 5 -FU, paclitaxel, docetaxel, methotrexate, 
cetuximab, gemcitabine, or capecitabine [National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2018] . 
No Phase 3 randomized trial showed an improvement in OS for any regimen until the 
EXTREME trial [Vermorken, J. B., et al 2008] . This tr ial showed that the addition of 
cetuximab to the combination of platinum plus 5 -FU improved median OS to 10.1 months 
from 7.4 months when compared with platinum plus 5 -FU alone.
Data from the final analysis of KEYNOTE -048, an ongoing Phase 3, open -label trial to 
compare the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab as monotherapy or in combination with 
chemotherapy (platinum plus 5 -FU) versus the standard EXTREME chemotherapy regimen 
(cetuximab in combination with platinum plus 5 -FU is provided in S ection 2.2.3). In the 
population of all participants, there was a clinically meaningful difference in OS when 
comparing pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy with standard treatment. The pembrolizumab 
monotherapy group had more responders who achieved a CR and a more durable DOR.
In preclinical models, lenvatinib decreased the TAM population, which is known as an 
immune -regulator in the tumor microenvironment. By [CONTACT_113776], expression levels of 
cytokines and immune -regulating receptors were changed to incre ase immune activation. The

1/PD -L1 signal inhibitors. The effect of combining lenvatinib with anti -PD-1/PD -L1 agents 
has been investigated in the CT26 colorectal cance r syngeneic model (anti -PD-L1 agent) as 
well as the LL/2 lung cancer syngeneic model (anti -PD-1 agent). Combination treatment with 
lenvatinib and either an anti PD -1 or anti -PD-L1 agent showed significant and superior 
antitumor effects compared with either compound alone in these 2 syngeneic models [Kato, 
Y., et al 2015] .
The ongoing pembrolizumab + lenvatinib combination Study 111/KEYNOTE -146 (Section 
2.2.3) in participants with HNSCC has shown promising clinica l activity and a manageable 
tolerability and safety profile [Taylor, M. H., et al 2018] . These results showed an ORR of 
40.9% and median PFS of 8.[ADDRESS_126988] -of-care treatment in 1L R/M HNSCC participants whose tumors 
express PD -L1 (CPS ≥1). Combination therapy with pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib would 
provide additional 1L treatment options for HNSCC participants.
2.2 Background
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized IgG4 mAb with high specificity of binding to t he PD 
1 receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with PD -L1 and PD -L2. Based on preclinical in 
vitro data, pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD -1. 
Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is in clinical development as 
an IV immunotherapy for advanced malignancies. KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) is 
indicated for the treatment of participants across a number of indications.
Lenvatinib (also known as E7080 or MK 7902) inhibits the kinase activities of v ascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and 
VEGFR3 (FLT4). Lenvatinib inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic 
angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cell ular 
functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; platelet 
derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. Lenvatinib also exhibited 
antiproliferative activity in cell lines dependent on activated FGFR sign aling with a 
concurrent inhibition of FGF -receptor substrate 2α phosphorylation.

background information on pembrolizumab and lenvatinib.

2.2.1 Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Back ground
[IP_ADDRESS] Pembrolizumab
The PD -[ADDRESS_126990] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548]. The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T 
cells under healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwant ed or excessive immune 
responses, including autoimmune reactions. PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig 
superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 that has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling on engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2) 
[Greenwald, R. J., et al 2005] [Okazaki, T., et al 2001] .
The structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved [Zhang, X., et al 2004] . PD-1 and its family 
members are Type -I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an IgV –type domain 
responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail responsible for the binding of sign aling 
molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif, and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based 
switch motif. After T -cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatase s, SHP -1 and 
SHP-2, to the immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif within its cytoplasmic tail, 
leading to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ, and ZAP70, 
which are involved in the CD3 T -cell signaling cascade [Okazaki, T., et al 2001] [Chemnitz, 
J. M., et al 2004] [Sheppard, K -A, et al 2004] [Riley, J. L. 2009] . The mechanism by [CONTACT_113777]-[ADDRESS_126991] from, that of CTLA -4, 
because both molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971] [Parry, R. V., et al 
2005] [Francisco, L. M., et al 2010] . As a consequence, the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway is an 
attractive targe t for therapeutic intervention in R/M HNSCC.
[IP_ADDRESS] Lenvatinib
Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from a pre -existing vascular network, is 
essential for tumor growth and metastasis. VEGF and its family of receptors (VEGRs 1 -3) 
play a major role in t umor angiogenesis [Ferrara, N., et al 2003] [Ellis, L. M. and Hicklin, D. 
J. 2008] [Tammela, T. and Alitalo, K. 2010] . Accumulated evidence suggests that FGF and 
its receptor tyrosine kinase, FGFR also play important roles for tumor angiogenesis [Cross, 
M. J. and Claesson -Welsh L. 2001] [Lieu, C., et al 2011] [Limaverde -Sousa, G., et al 2014] .
Lenvatinib is a potent multiple RTK inhibitor th at selectively inhibits VEGF receptors, 
VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4), FGFR1 -4, PDGFRα, KIT, and 
RET. Among known kinase inhibitors in clinical use, lenvatinib is one of the only inhibitors 
currently labeled with a mechanism of action as a n inhibitor of not only VEGFRs but also 
FGFRs, both of which are currently believed to be very important for tumor angiogenesis.
Lenvatinib inhibited cell free kinase activities for VEGFR1 -3 and FGFR1 -3 with Ki values 
around 1 nmol/L, and 8 -22 nmol/L, resp ectively. In cell -based assays, lenvatinib inhibited 
VEGF -derived and FGF -derived tube formation of HUVEC with IC50 values of 2.1 and 7.3 
nmol/L, respectively. Analysis of the signal transduction molecules revealed that lenvatinib 
inhibited both the MAPK p athway and the mTOR -S6K-S6 pathway in HUVECs triggered by 
08K59L

activated VEGFR and FGFR. Furthermore, lenvatinib (10, 30 mg/kg) significantly inhibited 
both VEGF -and FGF -driven angiogenesis in a murine in vivo model [Yamamoto, Y., et al 
2014] . In vivo, lenvatinib exhibited antitumor activity against various human tumor 
xenografts in athymic mice including 5 types of thyroid carcinomas (differentiated [papi[INVESTIGATOR_113735]], anaplastic, squamous, and medullary thy roid carcinomas), RCC, HCC, 
melanoma, gastric cancer, NSCLC, ovarian cancer, Ewing’s sarcoma, and osteosarcoma. In 
addition, the antitumor activity of lenvatinib in combination with other anticancer agents in 
several xenograft models was greater than that of lenvatinib or the other agents alone.
In summary, lenvatinib inhibited VEGF -driven VEGFR2 phosphorylation and suppressed 
proliferation and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) models. 
Antitumor activity of lenvatinib in vivo h as been shown in numerous xenograft animals. 
These results suggest that lenvatinib may be a novel anticancer therapy through inhibition of 
angiogenesis and may be useful as either monotherapy or in combination with other 
anticancer drugs.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pembrolizumab Plu s Lenvatinib
The importance of intact immune surveillance function in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformations has been known for decades [Disis, M. L. 2010] . Accumulating evidence 
shows a correlation between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes in cancer tissue and favorable 
prognosis in various malignancies. In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio 
of CD8+ effector T -cells/FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells (T -regs) correlates with improved 
prognos is and long -term survival in solid malignancies, such as ovarian, colorectal, and 
pancreatic cancer; hepatocellular carcinoma; malignant melanoma; and renal cell carcinoma. 
Tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes can be expanded ex vivo and reinfused, inducing dura ble 
objective tumor responses in cancers such as melanoma [Dudley, M. E., et al 2005] [Hunder, 
N. N., et al 2008] .
In preclinical models, lenvatinib decreased the tumor -associated macrophage (TAM) 
populat ion, which is known as an immune -regulator in the tumor microenvironment. The 
decrease in TAM population was accompanied by [CONTACT_19390] T -cell 
populations through stimulation of interferon -gamma signaling, resulting in increased 
immune activation [Kimura, T., et al 2018] . The immune -modulating effect of lenvatinib 
may result in a potent combination effect with PD -1/L1 signal inhibitors. The effect of 
combining lenvatinib with an anti -human PD -1 humanized mAb was investigated in 4 
murine tumor isograft models, which showed significant tumor growth inhibition compared 
to control. In the RAG murine tumor isograft tumor model, survival in the group treated with 
the combination was significantly lo nger than that of the respective monotherapy groups. In 
the CT26 murine tumor isograft model, treatment with the combination significantly 
increased the population of activated cytotoxic T cells compared to that of the respective 
monotherapy groups [Kato, Y., et al 2019] . All treatments were well tolerated and severe 
body weight loss was not observed.

Edition 17 2019] and lenvatinib [IB Edition 16 2019] .
2.2.3 Ongoing Clinical Studies of Pembrolizumab and Lenvatinib
There is an expansive ongoing research program of clinical studies evaluating 
pembrolizumab in patients with a number of hematological and solid malignancies, including 
HNSCC. The clinical program for HNSCC consists of the completed and ongoing studies for 
recurrent/metastatic disease: KN012, KN055, KN040, and KN048, as well as this study, 
LEAP -010.
Lenvatinib is undergoing studies in participants with different types of solid tumors, 
including HNSCC, in combination with oth er therapi[INVESTIGATOR_113736] -1 targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Full lists of ongoing studies are in the respective IBs for pembrolizumab and lenvatinib.
Ongoing Clinical Studies of Pembrolizumab in HNSCC
KEYNOTE -012 (KN012) 
KN012 is a Phase 1B, multicohort study evaluat ing the single -agent activity of 
pembrolizumab in various solid tumors, including 2 cohorts of participants (Cohorts B and 
B2) with R/M HNSCC. Cohort B consisted of 60 participants with PD -L1 positive HNSCC 
who received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W. Cohort B 2 consisted of 132 participants 
regardless of PD -L1 status, who received pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W [Mehra, R., et al 
2016] . Responses were seen in both HPV -positive and HPV -negative participants. This was 
the fir st immunotherapy demonstrating clinically meaningful antitumor activity in a heavily 
pretreated incurable HNSCC population with recurrent/metastatic disease. Enrollment is 
closed, but participants are ongoing in the study.
The efficacy and safety results a fter long -term follow -up based on pooled data from Cohorts 
B and B2 were presented at ASCO 2016 [Mehra, R., et al 2016] . In the recurrent/metastatic 
HNSCC population (n=192), the ORR was 21.9% (95% CI; 12.5% to 34.0%) in HPV -
positive participants and 15.9% (95% CI: 10.0% to 23.4%) in HPV -negative participants. In 
a separate publication, when PD -L1 expression analyses were restricted to only tumor cells 
(tumor proportion scoring, TPS), there was no statistically s ignificant increase ORR with PD -
L1 positive ( ≥1%) versus negative (<1%) tumors. Conversely, when immune cells were 
included in the scoring system (CPS), PD -L1 expression on tumor and immune cells 
significantly correlated with ORR, PFS, and OS [Chow, L. Q., et al 2016] . Median OS was 
8.5 months (95% CI: 6.5 to 10.5). The 6 -month PFS rate was 24.9% [Mehra, R., et al 2016] .
Importantly, the responses seen with pembrolizum ab were durable. Among participants with 
recurrent/metastatic HNSCC, the DOR ranged from 1.8+ to 21.8+ months, and the median 
was not reached. Among participants who responded (n=34), 85% were in response for at 
least 6 months, and 71% of responders had on going responses [IB Edition 17 2019] . These

with HNSCC.
KEYNOTE -055 (KN055)
KN055 is a Phase 2, nonrandomi zed, single cohort study of pembrolizumab (200 mg Q3W) 
monotherapy in a heavily pretreated population of patients with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC 
who have progressed on prior platinum and cetuximab therapy. Results from 171 participants 
treated with pembro lizumab were presented by [CONTACT_113778] [Bauml, J., et al 2017] . When 
confirmed responses were evaluated, the ORR was 16% (CR, n=1; PR, n=27; 95% CI: 11% 
to 23%) with a median DOR of 8 months (range, 2+ to 12+ mon ths); the stable disease rate 
was 19% (n=33; 95% CI: 14% to 26%). Response rates were slightly higher in participants 
that were PD -L1 positive; 18% of participants with CPS ≥1% PD -L1 expression responded 
to pembrolizumab compared with 12% of participants w ith CPS <1% expression. 
Nonetheless, PD -L1–negative participants responded to pembrolizumab at a rate that is 
clinically meaningful; 6 -and 12 -month PFS and OS rates were relatively similar between 
PD-L1–negative and PD -L1–positive participants. The result s presented by [CONTACT_113778] 
[Bauml, J., et al 2017] , confirm findings from KN012 in the recurrent/metastatic HNSCC 
population; pembrolizumab monotherapy (200 mg Q3W) demonstrates consistent and 
clinically meaning ful activity in heavily pretreated participants with HNSCC.
KEYNOTE -040 (KN040) 
KN040 is an ongoing Phase 3, randomized, active -controlled, open -label study of 
pembrolizumab versus the choice of 3 different SOC therapi[INVESTIGATOR_113737] R/M 
HNSCC. Fo ur hundred and ninety -five participants with R/M HNSCC were randomized 1:1 
to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W or the investigator’s choice of one of the following 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_113738]: single agent methotrexate, single agent docetaxel, or
single agent cetuximab. Randomization was stratified by [CONTACT_113779] (0 vs. 1), 
HPV status (oropharynx –p16 positive vs. oropharynx –p16 negative or 
larynx/hypopharynx/oral cavity HNSCC), and PD -L1 status (strong positive or not; strong 
posit ive was defined as TPS ≥50% PD -L1 testing by [CONTACT_4658]). The primary objective of the 
study was to evaluate OS in participants with R/M HNSCC treated with pembrolizumab 
compared with SOC treatment. Enrollment is closed, but participants are ongoing in the 
study.
The efficacy and safety data from the final analysis were reported, and at the time of the final 
analysis, 181 (73%) of 247 participants in the pembrolizumab group and 207 (83%) of 248 
participants in the SOC group had died. The median OS in the ITT popul ation was 8.4 
months (95% CI 6.4 to 9.4) with pembrolizumab and 6.9 months (5.9 to 8.0) with SOC (HR

= 0.8, 0.65 to 0.98; nominal p=0.0161). In the ITT population, the median DOR was 18.4 
months in the pembrolizumab group compared with only 5 months for SO C [Cohen, E. E. 
W., et al 2019] .
For participants with a PD -L1 CPS ≥1 tumor score, the HR for OS was 0.74 (95% CI 0.58 to 
0.93; nominal p=0.0049), with a median survival of 8.7 months (95% CI 6.9 to 11.4) for 
pembrolizumab versus 7.1 months (5.7 to 8.3) with SOC. In participants whose tumor had 
PD-L1 TPS ≥50% expression, the HR for death was 0.53 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.81; nominal 
p=0.0014), and median OS was 11.6 months (95% CI 8.3 to 19.5) compared with 6.6 months 
(4.8 to 9.2) for pembrolizumab and SOC, respectively. 
Fewer participants treated with pembrolizumab than with SOC had treatment -related AEs 
(63% vs. 84%), as well as higher toxicity AEs (Grade ≥3 treatment -related AEs 13% vs. 
36%).
KEYNOTE -048 (KN048)
KN048 is an ongoing Phase 3, randomized, active -controlled, open -label study of 
pembrolizumab, or pembrolizumab plus platinum plus 5 -FU chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_113739] 5 -FU plus cetuximab (EXTREME regimen) in participants with 1L R/M HNSCC. A 
total of 882 p articipants with 1L R/M HNSCC were randomized worldwide 1:1:1 between 
the 3 arms of the study to examine the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (n=301 
participants), or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (n=281 participants) versus SOC with 
cetuximab and ch emotherapy (n=300 participants) [Burtness, B., et al 2018] [CSR P048 
2020] . The primary endpoints of the study are PFS per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by [CONTACT_19377], 
and OS. Participants are ongoing in the study [CSR P048 2020] .
Data from the second interim analysis for KEYNOTE -048 were presented at the 2018 ESMO 
Congress [Burtness, B., et al 2018] . The cutoff date for this f inal PFS/interim OS analysis 
was13 -JUN-2018, with a minimum follow -up of approximately 17 months. For OS, 
pembrolizumab monotherapy was superior to the EXTREME regimen in participants with a 
CPS ≥20, HR = 0.61 (95% CI 0.45 -0.83, p=0.0007), and yielded a me dian OS that was 
longer with pembrolizumab (14.9 months) than the EXTREME regimen (10.7 months). 
Statistical significance was also achieved for pembrolizumab monotherapy in participants 
whose tumors had PD -L1 expression of CPS ≥1 with HR = 0.78 (95% CI 0.6 4 to 0.96, 
p=0.0086) and a median OS of 12.3 months versus 10.3 months in participants receiving the 
EXTREME regimen [Burtness, B., et al 2018] .
Confirmed ORR for pembrolizumab versus EXTREME was 23% versus 36% for CPS ≥20 
with a more durable DOR of 20.9 versus 4.2 months, and 19% versus 35% for CPS ≥1 with a 
median DOR of 20.9 versus 4.5 months for CPS ≥1 [Burtness, B., et al 2018] .
Pembrolizumab monotherapy had a mor e favorable toxicity profile compared with the 
EXTREME regimen with few treatment -related AEs (58.3% vs. 96.9%), fewer treatment -
related Grade 3 to 5 AEs (16.7% vs. 69.0%), and fewer treatment -related AEs that led to 
treatment discontinuation (4.7% vs. 19. 9%) [CSR P048V01MK3475 2018] .

Data cutoff of the final analysis was 25 -FEB-2019 (approximately [ADDRESS_126997]

expression, OS results further confirmed the statistically and clinically meaningful results 
observed at the second interim analysis, with an OS HR = 0.74 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.90) for CPS 
≥1 and HR = 0.58 (95% CI: 0.44, 0. 78) for CPS ≥20 [CSR P048 2020] . In the population of 
all participants, there was a clinically meaningful difference in OS when comparing 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy with standard treatment. The pembrolizuma b 
monotherapy group had more responders who achieved a complete response and a more 
durable DOR (22.6 vs. 4.5 months) [Rischin, D., et al 2019] . The safety results at the final 
analysis were similar to those obs erved at the second interim analysis.
At the second interim analysis, pembrolizumab + chemotherapy significantly improved OS in 
the total population (HR = 0.77 [95% CI 0.63 -0.93]; p=0.[ZIP_CODE]) [CSR P048V01MK3475

EXTREME regimen were comparable (95.3% vs. 96.9% treatment -related AEs; 71.0% vs 
69.0% treatment -related Grade 3 to 5 AEs; and 22.8% vs 19.9% treatment -related AEs that 
led to treatment discontinuation) [CSR P048V01MK3475 2018] . 
At the final analysis, pembrolizumab + chemotherapy OS results (HR = 0.72 [95% CI: 0.60, 
0.87]) [CSR P048 2020] further confirmed the statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful OS observed at the second interim analysis. In the population of participants who 
tumors express PD -L1, OS was statistically significant and clinically meaningful in PD -L1 
CPS ≥1 (H R = 0.65 [95% CI: 0.53, 0.80], p=0.[ZIP_CODE]) and in CPS ≥20 (HR = 0.60 [95% CI: 
0.45, 0.82], p=0.[ZIP_CODE]) [CSR P048 2020] . Furthermore, in participants whose tumors had 
PD-L1 expression, ORR and median time to respon se were similar, but the pembrolizumab + 
chemotherapy group had more durable DOR of 6.7 versus 4.3 months for CPS ≥1 and 7.1 
versus 4.2 months for CPS ≥20 [Rischin, D., et al 2019] . The safety results at the fin al 
analysis were similar to those observed at the second interim analysis.
In summary, for 1L R/M HNSCC, pembrolizumab monotherapy significantly improved OS 
over the EXTREME regimen in both the CPS ≥20 and CPS ≥[ADDRESS_126998] of 
care for R/M HNSCC.
Study 111/KEYNOTE -146
Study 111/KEYNOTE -146 is a multicenter, open -label, Phase 1b/2 clinical study being 
conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in com bination with 
pembrolizumab in selected solid tumors (ie, HNSCC, NSCLC, RCC, endometrial cancer, 
urothelial carcinoma, and melanoma) [IB Edition 16 2019] . The Phase 1b portion of this 
study has been completed an d Phase [ADDRESS_126999]: MK-7902 63
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127000] -2023
As of 01 -DEC -2017, 22 study participants with measurable, confirmed metastatic HNSCC 
and ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 were enrolled in this cohort and received lenvatinib 
(20 mg/day orally) + pembrolizumab (200 mg IV Q 3W). Participants were not preselected 
based on PD -L1 status. Tumor assessments were performed by [CONTACT_113780]. Of the participants, 9.1% had received no prior anticancer therapy, 63.6% had 
received 1 prior line of anticancer therapy, and 13.6% had received 2 prior lines of anticancer 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265] 13.6% had received ≥3 prior lines of anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], respectively. At data 
cutoff ( 01-DEC -2017), ORR was 40.9% (95% CI: 20.7, 63.6); ORR (at Week 24) was 36.4% 
(95% CI: 17.2, 59.3), in cluding 1 (4.5%) CR, 8 (36.4%) PR, 11 (50%) SD, 0 (0%) PD, and 2 
(9.1%) unknown; median PFS of 8.2 months (95% CI: 4.3, NE); and PFS rate at 12 months 
was 41.9 % (95% CI: 17.6, 64.7) [Taylor, M. H., et al 2018] .
Grade 3 or 4 treatment -related AEs occurred in 72.7% of participants (Grade 3 treatment -
related AEs in 15 participants [68.2%] and Grade 4 treatment -related AEs in 1 participant 
[4.5%]). The most common treatment -related AEs were fatigue (50.0%; Grade 3: 4 .5%), 
hypertension (40.9%, Grade 3: 18.2%), and diarrhea (36.4%, Grade 3: 4.5%). Five 
participants experienced serious treatment -related AEs including hypertension, acute kidney 
injury, dehydration, hemoptysis and pulmonary edema. There were 5 fatal AEs re ported; 
none were deemed treatment -related [Taylor, M. H., et al 2018] .
Overall, the study showed promising clinical activity and manageable toxicities, supporting 
further evaluation of the lenvatinib + pembroli zumab in participants with HNSCC [Taylor, 
M. H., et al 2018a] . Interim analysis results for NSCLC, urothelial carcinoma, melanoma, 
endometrial carcinoma and RCC study arms produced similar response rates and acc eptable 
safety and tolerability [Brose, M., et al 2018] [Vogelzang, N., et al 2018] [Taylor, M., et al 
2018] [Makker, V., et al 2018] [Lee, C. H., et al 2018] . From these studies, the combination 
of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib showed promising clinical activity and a manageable safety 
profile that is consistent with the safety profile of each agent when administered as 
monotherapy.
Based on Study 111/KEYNOTE -146, lenvatini b 20 mg QD in combination with 
pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W was the dose selected for this Phase 3 study.
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
It cannot be guaranteed that participants in clinical studies will directly benefit from 
treatment during participation, as cli nical studies are designed to provide information about 
the safety and effectiveness of an investigational medicine.
With the results of the KEYNOTE -048 clinical trial demonstrating survival benefit with 
pembrolizumab for 1L R/M HNSCC, there is rationale f or treating the participants with 
pembrolizumab monotherapy in the CPS ≥[ADDRESS_127001] that 
inhibiting angiogenesis in combination with PD -1 blockade is a promising therapeutic 
strategy, and the benefit/risk assessment for participants in this study is considered to be 
favorable, making the combination of pem brolizumab + lenvatinib a promising therapeutic

Second Course treatment and all participants in China) . Updated analyses are described in 
Section 9.
This is a randomized, placebo -controlled, double -bind, pa rallel design, multisite study of 
pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib versus pembrolizumab plus placebo as 1L intervention in 
participants with R/M HNSCC whose tumors express PD -L1 (CPS ≥1). This Phase [ADDRESS_127015] tumors that express PD -L1 CPS

The original study design is shown in Figure 1(Initial Treatment) and Figure 2(Second 
Course). The new study design per Amendment 05 is depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 3and Figure 4.
Approximately 500 participants will be randomized 1:1 to Arm 1 (pembrolizumab + 
lenvatinib) or Arm 2 (pembrolizumab + placebo). Stratification factors for this study are:
•PD-L1tumor expression as determined by [CONTACT_4002] -L1 immunohistochemistry (TPS <50% vs. 
≥50%)
•HPV status for oropharynx cancer as determined by p16 immunohistochemistry (positive 
or negative); HPV status for participants without oropharynx cancer (eg, cancers of the 
oral cavity, hypopharynx and larynx) is considered HPV negative.
•ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1)
Specific procedures to be performed during the study, including prescribed times and 
associated visit windows, are outlined in Section 1.3of the SoA. Detail s of each procedure 
are provided in Section 8.
Participants will be evaluated with radiographic imaging to assess response to study 
intervention every 6 weeks from randomization through Year 1, and every 9 weeks after 
Year 1. All imaging obtained during th e study will be submitted to the iCRO for 
determination of ORR and PFS (Section [IP_ADDRESS].1). Tumor imaging showing site -assessed PD 
will be submitted for verification by [CONTACT_19377]. Treatment beyond centrally -verified PD per 
RECIST 1.1 may be permitted at the dis cretion of the investigator after consultation with the 
Sponsor and receiving signed informed consent. 
Survival follow -up will begin after centrally -verified PD (or on completion of all efficacy 
assessments if the participant is receiving study interventi on beyond centrally -verified PD) or 
the start of new anticancer treatment, whichever occurs first. On Sponsor request, 
participants may be contact[CONTACT_19392].
AE monitoring will be ongoing throughout the study. AEs w ill be graded in severity 
according to the guidelines outlined in the NCI CTCAE v5.0.
Treatment with pembrolizumab will continue for up to 35 treatment cycles, or until a 
discontinuation criterion (Section 7.1) is met. Participants who stop pembrolizumab a fter

35cycles may continue to receive lenvatinib/placebo until a discontinuation criterion 
(Section 7.1) is met.
Participants who meet the criteria outlined in Section 6.7 may be considered for Second 
Course treatment with up to 17 cycles of pembrolizumab with or without lenvatinib/placebo.
After enrollment of the global portion of the study is complete, the study may remain open to 
enrollment in China alone until the target number of participants in China has been enrolled 
to meet local regulatory requirements. An extension portion of the study will be identical to 
the global study, (eg, inclusion and exclusion criteria, study endpoints, primary and 
secondary objectives, and study procedures).
Note: At the time of writing Amendment 05, en rollment in the China extension has closed.

Three interim analyses are planned in this study (Section 9.7).
4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
4.2.1 Rationale for Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Endpoints
This study will use OS, ORR and PFS as primary endpoints. OS has been recognized as the 
gold standard for demonstration of superiority of a new antineoplastic therapy in randomized 
clinical trial. ORR and PFS are based on RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_127017] is large and the therapy has an acceptable ri sk/benefit profile. The use 
of BICR and RECIST 1.1 to assess ORR and PFS is typi[INVESTIGATOR_113741]. Images will be submitted to an iCRO and read by [CONTACT_113782]. 
In addition, the final determination of radiologic progression will be based on the central 
assessment of progression, rather than a local site investigator/radiology assessment.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127019] -2023
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Endpoints
Safety parameters frequently used for evaluating investigational -systemic anticancer 
treatments are included as safety endpoints including, but not limited to, the incidence of, 
causality, and outcome of AEs/SAEs ,andchanges in vital signs and laboratory values. AEs 
will be assessed as defined by [CONTACT_3989], Version 5.0.
[IP_ADDRESS] Exploratory Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Rationale for Patient -reported Outcomes Endpoints
Changes in HRQoL using PRO assessments can provide important information on clinic al 
benefit and are accepted clinical endpoints by [CONTACT_21652]. Participants will provide 
information regarding their HRQoL using the EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC QLQ -H&N35 
PRO instruments. Health utilities will be evaluated using the EQ 5D -5L PRO instrum ent. 
These PROs assessments are not pure efficacy or safety endpoints because they are affected 
by [CONTACT_113784].
The EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC QLQ -H&N35 are psychometrically and clinically 
validated instruments appropriate for assessing HRQoL in participants with HNSCC 
[Bjordal, K., et al 1994] [Bjordal, K., et al 2000] . These instruments have been widely used 
in Phase 3 studies of participants with R/M HNSCC [Mesia, R., et al 2010] [Machiels, J. P., 
et al 2015] [Harrington, K. J., et al 2017] [Cohen, E. E. W., et al 2018] .
EORTC QLQ -C30
EORTC QLQ -C30 is the most widely used cancer -specific HRQoL instrument, which 
contains 30 items and measures 5 functional dimensions (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, 
and social), 3 symptom items (fatigue, nausea/vom iting, and pain), 6 single items (dyspnea, 
sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact), and a global 
health and QoL scale [Aaronson, N. K., et al 1993] . The EORTC QLQ -C30 is a
psychometrically and clinically validated instrument appropriate for assessing QoL in 
oncology studies [Aaronson, N. K., et al 1993] .
EORTC QLQ -H&N35
TheEORTC QLQ -H&N35 is a disease -specific questionnaire dev eloped to measure QoL in 
head and neck cancer .The EORTC QLQ -H&N35 consists of 7 multi -item scales (pain in the 
mouth, problems with swallowing, senses, speech, social eating, social contact, and 
sexuality), and 11 single -item scales (problems with teeth, mouth opening, dry mouth, sticky 
saliva, coughing, feeling ill, use of analgesics, use of nutritional supplements, use of feeding 
tube, weight gain, and weight loss) [Bjordal, K., et al 1994] .
EuroQoL EQ -5D-5L
The EuroQoL EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome 
and will provide data to develop health utilities for use in health economic analyses [Rabin, 
R. and de Charro, F. 2001] . The [ADDRESS_127020]: MK-7902 72
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127021] -2023
following: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each 
dimension is rated on a 5 -point scale from 1 (no problem) to 5 (unable to/extreme problems). 
The EQ -5D-5L also includes a graded (0 to 100) vertical visual analog scale on which the 
participant rates his or her general state of health at the time of the assessment. This 
instrument has been used extensively in cancer studies and published results from these 
studies support its validity and reliability [Pi[INVESTIGATOR_19323], A. S., et al 2007] [Pi[INVESTIGATOR_19323], A. S., et al 
2007a] .

[IP_ADDRESS] Planned Exploratory Biomarker Research
Cancer immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_19325]. 
However, the mechanism of action of these exciting new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including novel 
combination with antiangiogenesis therapy, is not completely understood and much remains 
to be learned regarding how best to leverage these new drugs in treating patients. Thus, to aid 
future patients, it is im portant to investigate the determinants of response or resistance to 
cancer immunotherapy and other treatments administered, as well as determinants of AEs in 
the course of our clinical studies. These efforts may identify novel predictive/PD biomarkers 
andgenerate information that may better guide single -agent and combination therapy with 
immuno -oncology drugs. To identify novel biomarkers, biospecimens (ie, blood components, 
tumor material) will be collected to support analyses of cellular components (eg, protein, 
DNA, RNA, metabolites) and other circulating molecules. Investigations may include but are 
not limited to:
Germline (blood) genetic analyses (eg, SNP analyses, whole exome sequencing, whole 
genome sequencing)
This research may evaluate whether ge netic variation within a clinical study population 
correlates with response to the treatment(s) under evaluation. If genetic variation is found to 
predict efficacy or AEs, the data might inform optimal use of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_113742]. Furthermor e, it is important to evaluate germline DNA variation across the 
genome in order to interpret tumor -specific DNA mutations.
Genetic (DNA) analyses from tumor
The application of new technologies, such as next generation sequencing, has provided 
scientists t he opportunity to identify tumor -specific DNA changes (ie, mutations, methylation 
status, microsatellite instability) contributing towards the development/progression of cancer 
and/or driving response to therapy. Key molecular changes of interest to immuno -oncology 
drug development include the mutational burden of tumors and the clonality of T -cells in the 
tumor microenvironment. Increased mutational burden (sometimes referred to as a ‘hyper -
08K59L
PRODUCT: MK-7902 73
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127022] -2023
mutated’ state) may generate neo -antigen presentation in the tumor microenvironment. To 
conduct this type of research, it is important to identify tumor -specific mutations that occur 
across all genes in the tumor genome. Evaluation of molecular targets and signaling 
pathways including angiogenesis and/or growth factor re lated signaling pathways related to 
pembrolizumab and lenvatinib may also be explored. Thus, genome -wide approaches may be 
used for this effort. Note that in order to understand tumor -specific mutations, it is necessary 
to compare the tumor genome with the germline genome. Circulating tumor DNA and/or 
RNA may also be evaluated from blood samples.
Tumor and blood RNA analyses
Both genome -wide and targeted messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiling and 
sequencing in tumor tissue and in blood may be performed t o define gene signatures that 
correlate to clinical response to treatment with pembrolizumab or other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Pembrolizumab induces a response in tumors that likely reflects an inflamed/immune 
phenotype. Specific immune -related gene sets (ie, thos e capturing interferon -gamma 
transcriptional pathways) may be evaluated and new signatures may be identified. Individual 
genes related to the immune system and growth factor signaling pathways (eg, VEGF and 
FGF) may also be evaluated. MicroRNA profiling ma y also be pursued as well as exosomal 
profiling.
Proteomics and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using blood or tumor
Tumor and blood samples from this study may undergo proteomic analyses (eg, PD -L1 IHC). 
PD-L1 protein level in tumor sections, assessed by [CONTACT_4658], has been shown to correlate with 
response to pembrolizumab in patients with NSCLC, and an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device 
has been developed for use with pembrolizumab in NSCLC. Preliminary data indicates that 
this association may also be true in addition al cancer types (ie, triple negative breast cancer, 
head and neck, and gastric). Additional tumor or blood -derived proteins may also correlate 
with response to pembrolizumab and lenvatinib combination therapy. Therefore, tumor tissue 
may be subjected to pr oteomic analyses using a variety of platforms that could include but 
are not limited to immunoassays and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. This 
approach could identify novel protein biomarkers that could aid in patient selection for 
pembrolizumab (M K-3475) and lenvatinib combination therapy.
Other blood -derived biomarkers
In addition to expression on the tumor tissue, PD -L1, circulating cytokines and angiogenic 
factors, and other tumor derived proteins can be shed from tumor and released into the blo od. 
Assays such as enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measure such proteins in 
serum. Correlation of expression with response to pembrolizumab and lenvatinib 
combination therapy may identify new approaches for predictive biomarkers in blood, 
represe nting a major advance from today’s reliance on assessing tumor biomarkers. This 
research would serve to develop such assays for future clinical use.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127023] demonstrated that the gut microbiome can shape anti -tumor 
immunity and responses to immune checkpoint blockade in mouse models, and t hat 
modulation of the gut microbiome may enhance responses to immune checkpoint blockade. 
This has also been studied in patients on immune checkpoint blockade (anti -CTLA -4 and 
anti-PD-1), with evidence that differential bacterial signatures exist in respon ders versus non -
responders to therapy (with responders having higher diversity of the gut microbiome and 
differential composition compared with non -responders). Importantly, these differences in 
the gut microbiome are associated with differential immune si gnatures in the tumor 
microenvironment [Lynch, S. V. 2016] .
4.2.2 Rationale for the Use of Comparator/Placebo
Based on results from the KEYNOTE -[ADDRESS_127024] -line R/M HNSCC participants whose tumors express PD -L1 (CPS ≥1) 
and is therefore being used as the comp arator in this trial.
The use of a placebo in combination with pembrolizumab will ensure the objectivity of the 
local investigators’ treatment decisions and AE causality assessments.
4.3 Justification for Dose
4.3.1 Pembrolizumab
The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this study is 200 mg Q3W. Based on the totality of 
data generated in the Keytruda development program, 200 mg Q3W is an appropriate dose of 
pembrolizumab for adults across all indications. As outlined below, this dose is justified by:
•Clinical data from 8 randomized studies in melanoma and NSCLC indications 
demonstrating flat dose -and exposure -efficacy relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 
10mg/kg Q2W representing an approximate 5 -to 7.5 -fold exposure range (refer to IB, 
Section 5.2.2)
•Popu lation PK analysis showing that both fixed dosing and weight -based dosing provides 
similar control of PK variability with considerable overlap in the distributions of 
exposures, supporting suitability of 200 mg Q3W
•Clinical data showing meaningful improvem ent in benefit -risk including overall survival 
at 200 mg Q3W across multiple indications
•Pharmacology data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferred 
from PK data) and tumor (inferred from PBPK analysis) at [ADDRESS_127025]: MK-7902 75
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127026] -2023
Among the 8 randomized dose -comparison studies, a total of 2262 participants were enrolled 
with melanoma and NSCLC, covering different disease settings (treatment -naïve, previously 
treated, PD -L1 enriched, and all -comers) and different treatment settings (monoth erapy and 
in combination with chemotherapy). Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg 
Q3W (KN001 Cohort B2, KN001 Cohort D, KN002, KN010, and KN021), and 3 studies 
compared 10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B3, KN001 Cohort F2 and 
KN0 06). All of these studies showed flat dose -and exposure -response relationships across 
the doses studied representing an approximate 5 -to 7.5 -fold difference in exposure. The 
2mg/kg (or 200 mg fixed -dose) Q3W provided similar responses to the highest dos es 
studied. Subsequently, flat dose -exposure -response relationships were also observed in other 
tumor types including head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and classical 
Hodgkin lymphoma, confirming [ADDRESS_127027] tumor PD -1 saturation over a wide range of tumor penetr ation and PD -1 
expression. This evaluation concluded that pembrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W achieves full 
PD-1 saturation in both blood and tumor.
Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of 
body weight and other partic ipant covariates on exposure, has shown that the fixed -dosing 
provides similar control of PK variability as weight -based dosing, with considerable overlap 
in the distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed -dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. 
Supported by [CONTACT_113785] -dose has advantages of reduced 
dosing complexity and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed -dose was 
selected for evaluation across all pembrolizumab protocols.
4.3.2 Lenvatinib
The dosing regimen of lenvatinib was selected based on the results of the Phase 1b portion of 
Phase 1b/2 Study 111/KEYNOTE -146, the primary endpoint of which was to determine the 
MTD and RP2D for lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W. Thirteen 
participants (le nvatinib 24 mg/day + pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W: n=3; lenvatinib 20 
mg/day + pembrolizumab 200 mg: n=10) were enrolled in the Phase 1b portion of the study. 
Eight of the participants had RCC, 2 had NSCLC, 2 had endometrial carcinoma, and 1 had 
melanoma. T here were 2 DLTs at the dose of lenvatinib 24 mg/day + pembrolizumab 200 mg 
IV Q3W (1 participant had Grade 3 arthralgia, and another had Grade 3 fatigue); hence, this 
was defined as the toxic dose. No DLTs were reported in the next 10 participants (expans ion 
part), all of whom received the lenvatinib 20 mg/day + pembrolizumab [ADDRESS_127028]: MK-7902 76
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127029] -2023
111/KEYNOTE -146 [Makker, V., e t al 2018] , two Phase [ADDRESS_127030] been initiated for 
both of these tumor types, Study E7080 -G000 -309/KEYNOTE -775 and Study E7080 -G000 -
307/KEYNOTE -581.
4.3.3 Starting Dose for This Study
The starting dose of lenvatinib/placebo is 20 mg/day. Dose reductions of lenvatinib occur in 
succession based on the previous dose level (14, 10, and 8 mg/day). See Section 6.6 for dose 
modification. All participants will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W. Pembrolizumab 
dose reductions are not permitted.
4.3.4 Maximum Dose Expos ure for This Study
NOTE: In alignment with the study -specific investigator letter dated 25 -Aug-2023 , all study 
participants still receiving pembrolizumab should continue to receive pembrolizumab 
monotherapy on study and undergo modified protocol study proc edures as specified in this 
amendment. Study participation should end after the 30 -day Safety Follow -up Visit (last 
scheduled visit) with the following exceptions: participants who are potential candidates for 
Second Course treatment will continue in Effic acy Follow -up and all participants in China 
will continue in Efficacy Follow -upand Survival Follow -up. All participants should stop 
ongoing treatment with lenvatinib/placebo. 
Exceptions may be requested for lenvatinib for study participants who, in the assessment of 
their study physician, are benefiting from ongoing lenvatinib after consulting with the 
Sponsor . This applies to participants currently on pembrolizumab and lenvatinib and 
participants who have discontinued pembrolizumab and are currently continuing lenvatinib 
monotherapy. Participants who are considered by [CONTACT_113766] 35 cycles of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib 
require a separate communication with the Sponsor .Participants who discontinue 
pembrolizumab prior to completion of Cycle 35 (eg, due to an AE) must discontinue 
lenvatinib at the same time.
The maximum dose/exposure of pembrolizumab allowed in this study is 200 mg Q3W for 
approximately 2 years (35 cycles ). Participants meeting criteria for Second Course treatment 
with pembrolizumab (Section 6.7) may receive an additional 200 mg IV Q3W for up to 1 
year (17 cycles).
The maximum dose/exposure of lenvatinib allowed in this study is [ADDRESS_127031] participant (or their legally acceptable representative) 
provides documented informed consent. The overall study ends when the last participant 
completes the last study -related contact, withdraws consent, or is lost to follow -up (Section 
7.3).For purposes of analysis and reporting, the overall study ends when the Sponsor 
receives the last laboratory test result or at the time of final contact [CONTACT_57999] h the last participant, 
whichever comes last.

1.PD-L1 tumor expression as determined by [CONTACT_4002] -L1 immunohistochemistry (TPS <50% vs. 
≥50%).
2.HPV status for oropharynx cancer as determined by p16 immunohistochemistry (positive 
vs. negative); HPV status f or participants without oropharynx cancer (eg, cancers of the 
oral cavity, hypopharynx and larynx) is considered HPV negative.
3.ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1).
6.3.3 Blinding
After IA2, the study was unblinded on 16 -Aug-2023 .Original protocol text that is co ntained 
in this section has been retained for reference.
Adouble -blinding technique with in -house blinding will be used. Lenvatinib/matching 
placebo will be packaged identically for Arms 1 and 2 so that blind is maintained .The 
participant, the investigat or, and Sponsor personnel or delegate(s) who are involved in the 
study intervention administration or clinical evaluation of the participants are unaware of the 
intervention assignments.
The treatment identity of pembrolizumab will be open -label ; therefore , the Sponsor, 
investigator, and participant will know the intervention administered.

SeeSection 8.1.10 for the description of unblinding if a medical emergency occurs during the 
study.
6.4 Study Intervention Compliance
If there are interruptions in the study intervention schedule or infusion/injection was stopped, 
the details of and reason for any interruption or infusion/injection cessation of study 
intervention will be documented in the participant’s medical record.
Interruptions from the protocol -specified treatment plan for ≥28days for lenvatinib/placebo
require consultation between the investigator and the Sponsor and written documentation of 
the collaborative decision on participant management.
Lenvatinib/placebo:  On Day 1 of each cycle lenvatinib /placebo will be dosed in the clinic, 0 
to 4 hours after pembrolizumab. Lenvatinib/placebo will be taken at home on all other days.
6.[ADDRESS_127065] discuss any questions regarding this with the Sponsor’s Clinical Director. 
The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or 
the participant’s primary physician. However, the decision to continue the participant on 
study intervention requires the mutual agreement of the investigator and the Sponsor.
The following medications and vaccinations are prohibited during the study:
•Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy
•Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol
•Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol
•Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab and lenvatinib
•Radiation therapy
•Live or live -attenuated vaccines within [ADDRESS_127066] dose of study intervention 
and while pa rticipating in the study.
Note: Any licensed COVID -19 vaccine (including for Emergency Use) in a particular 
country is allowed in the study as long as they are mRNA vaccines, replication -
incompetent adenoviral vaccines, or inactivated vaccines. These vacci nes will be treated 
just as any other concomitant therapy.
•Refer to Appendix 7 for country -specific requirements.
•Systemic glucocorticoids except when used for the following purposes:
-To modulate symptoms of an AE that is suspected to have an immunologic e tiology
-For the prevention of emesis
-To premedicate for IV contrast allergies
08K59L
PRODUCT: MK-7902 90
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127067] -2023
-To treat asthma or COPD exacerbations (only short -term oral or IV use in doses 
>10mg/day prednisone equivalent)
-For chronic systemic replacement not to exceed 10 mg/day predniso ne equivalent
•Other glucocorticoid use except when used for the following purposes:
-For topi[INVESTIGATOR_113744]
-Intraarticular joint use
-For inhalation in the management of asthma or COPD
If the investigator determines that a participant requires any of the following prohibited 
medications and vaccinations for any reason during the study , study intervention
pembrolizumab+lenvatinib/placebo must be discontinued :
•Systemic antineoplastic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biological therapy not 
specified in th is protocol
•Investigational agents other than those specified in this protocol
•Radiation therapy
•Investigational vaccines (ie, those not licensed or approved for Emergency Use) are not 
allowed.
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a participant’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_12983]. All concomitant medication swill be recorded on the eCRF including all 
prescription s, OTC products, her bal supplements, and IV medications, and fluids. If changes 
occur during the study period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date 
should also be included on the eCRF.
All concomitant medications received within 28days prior to the first dose of study 
intervention and up to [ADDRESS_127068] dose of study intervention should be recorded. 
All concomitant medications administered during SAEs or ECIs are to be recorded. SAEs 
and ECIs are defined in Section 8.4.
6.5.1 Rescue Medications and Sup portive Care
Participants should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_78017].
Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEs with potential immunologic
etiology are outlined along with the dos e modification guidelines in Section 6.6.2 for 
guidelines forlenvatinib/placebo dose modification and supportive care .
6.5.2 Drug Interactions
There are no DDI -related concomitant medication prohibitions or restrictions. Lenvatinib is 
not expected to clinically meaningfully alter exposure to CYP3A4/ P -glycoprotein (Pgp) 
08K59L
PRODUCT: MK-7902 91
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127069] -2023
substrates based on results from a lenvatinib DDI study with midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A 
and Pgp substrate). Clinical studies also showed that co -administration of lenvatinib with 
either inducer s or inhibitors of CYP3A4/Pgp are not of clinical concern.
No drug interaction is expected between pembrolizumab and lenvatinib because of their 
divergent metabolic pathways. Pembrolizumab is a mAb and is primarily catabolized like 
other proteins, while le nvatinib is metabolized by [CONTACT_19414] (CYP3A and aldehyde oxidase) 
and nonenzymatic processes (LENVIMA® product information).
6.6 Dose Modification (Escalation/Titration/Other)
NOTE: In alignment with the study -specific investigator letter dated 25 -Aug-2023 , all study 
participants still receiving pembrolizumab should continue to receive pembrolizumab 
monotherapy on study and undergo modified protocol study procedures as specified in this 
amendment. Study participation should end after the 3 0-day Safety Follow -up Visit (last 
scheduled visit) with the following exceptions: participants who are potential candidates for 
Second Course treatment will continue in Efficacy Follow -up and all participants in China 
will continue in Efficacy Follow -upand Survival Follow -up. All participants should stop 
ongoing treatment with lenvatinib/placebo.
Exceptions may be requested for lenvatinib for study participants who, in the assessment of 
their study physician, are benefiting from ongoing lenvatinib after c onsulting with the 
Sponsor . This applies to participants currently on pembrolizumab and lenvatinib and 
participants who have discontinued pembrolizumab and are currently continuing lenvatinib 
monotherapy. Participants who are considered by [CONTACT_113766] 35 cycles of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib 
require a separate communication with the Sponsor. Participants who discontinue 
pembrolizumab prior to completion of Cycle 35 (eg, due to an AE) must discontinue 
lenvatinib at the same time.
Adverse events will be graded using NCI CTCAE Version v5.0. Investigators will decide the 
probability of the event being related to one or both drugs as to whether dose modification of 
one or both drugs is required.
Participants who interrupt or discontinue one drug in the lenvatinib -pembrolizumab 
combination due to toxicity can continue with the other drug in the combination until criteria 
for treatment discontinuation are met (eg, unacceptable toxicity , disease progression).

6.6.1 Immune -Related Events and Dose Modification (Withhold, Treat, 
Discontinue)
Dose Modification and Tox icity Management for Immune -related AEs Associated With 
Pembrolizumab
AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immune -related response. 
These irAEs may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of 
pembroliz umab treatment and may affect more than one body system simultaneously. 
Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce complications. 
Based on existing clinical study data, most irAEs were reversible and could be managed wit h 
interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of corticosteroids ,and/or other supportive 
care. For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other 
causes. Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be 
included as part of the evaluation.
Dose Modifica tion and Toxicity Management Guidelines for irAEs Associated With 
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy, Coformulations, or IO Combinations are provided in Table 5.
Table 5 Dose Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune -related 
Adverse Events Associated With Pembrolizumab Monotherapy, Coformulations, or IO 
Combinations
General instructions:
1.Severe and life -threatening irAEs should be treated with IV corticosteroids followed by [CONTACT_13215]. 
Other immunosuppressive treatment should begin if the irAEs are not controlled by [CONTACT_13216].
2.Pembrolizumab monotherapy, coformulations, or IO combinations must be permanently discontinued if 
the irAE does not resolve or the corticosteroid dose is not ≤10mg/day within [ADDRESS_127072] 
treatment.
3.The corticosteroid taper should begin when the irAE is ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_127073] been withheld, treatment may 
resume after the irAE decreased to ≤Grade 1 after corticosteroid taper.

Other Allowed Dose Interruption for Pembrolizumab
Pembrolizumab may be interrupted for situations other than treatment -related AEs s uch as 
medical/surgical events or logistical reasons not related to study therapy. Participants should 
be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled interruption unless 
otherwise discussed with the Sponsor. The reason for interruption sho uld be documented in 
the participant's study record .
6.6.2 Dose Modification with Lenvatinib
Lenvatinib dose reduction and interruption for participants who experience lenvatinib -
pembrolizumab combination therapy -related toxicity will be in accordance with the dose 
modification guidelines described in Table 7. An interruption of study intervention for more 
than 28 days will require Sponsor approval before treatment can be resumed.
The starting dose of lenvatinib is [20 mg/day ]in combination with pembrolizumab . Dose 
reductions of len vatinib occur in succession based on the previous dose level ( 20, 14, 10, and 
8 mg/day ). Any dose reduction below 8 mg/day must be discussed with the Sponsor. Once 
the lenvatinib placebo dose has been reduced, it may not be increased at a later date, unles s 
the dose has been mistakenly decreased; in this situation, the Sponsor’s approval is required 
to increase the dose.

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Hypertension
Hypertension is a recognized side effect of treatment with drugs inhibiting VEGF signaling. 
Investigators should therefore ensure that participants enrolled to receive treatment with 
lenvatinib have BP of ≤150/[ADDRESS_127086] 1 week 
before C1D1. Early detection and effective management of hypertension are important to 
minimize the need for lenvatinib dose interr uptions and reductions.
Regular assessment of BP should be as detailed in the SoA ( Section 1.3.1 and Section 1.3.2 ). 
Hypertension will be graded using NCI CTCAE v5.0, based on BP measurements only (and 
not on the number of antihypertensive medications).
If the participant’s first BP measurement of the current assessment is elevated (ie, systolic BP 
≥140 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg), the BP measurement should be repeated at least [ADDRESS_127087] 5 
minutes apart. If the BP assessment (ie, the mean of the [ADDRESS_127088] 
5 minutes apart) is elevated (systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg), a 
confirmatory assessment should be obtained at least 30 minutes later by [CONTACT_746] 2 
measurements (at least 5 minutes apart) to yield a mean value.
Antihypertensive agents should be started as soon as elevated BP (systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg 
or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg) is confirmed on [ADDRESS_127089] 30 minutes apart. The 
choice of antihypertensive treatment should be individualized to the participant’s clinical 
circumstances and follow standard medical practice. For previously normotensive 
participants, appropriate antihypertensiv e therapy should be started when systolic BP ≥140 
mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥[ADDRESS_127090] 30 minutes 
apart. For those participants already on antihypertensive medication, treatment modification 
may be necessary if hypert ension persists .
Lenvatinib should be withheld in any instance where a participant is at imminent risk to 
develop a hypertensive crisis or has uncontrolled hypertension (eg, BP ≥160/100 mm Hg) 
with significant risk factors for severe complications, signifi cant risk factors for cardiac 
disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, or other significant co -morbidities.  Once the participant 
has been on the same antihypertensive medications for at least [ADDRESS_127091] had systolic BP ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥[ADDRESS_127092] 
their BP monitored on Day 15 (or more frequently as clinically indicated) until systolic BP 
has been ≤150 mm Hg and diastolic BP has been ≤95 mm Hg for 2 c onsecutive treatment 
cycles. If a repeat event of systolic BP ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥[ADDRESS_127093] resume the Day 15 evaluation until systolic BP has been ≤150 mm Hg and

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Proteinuria
Regular assessment of proteinuria should be conducted as detailed in the SoA ( Section 1.3 ). 
Guidelines for assessment and management of proteinuria are as follows:
Detection and Confirmation
1.Perform urine dipstick testing or urinalysis per the SoA ( Section 1.3 ). Urine dipstick 
testing is the preferred method for testing for urinary protein, however, urinal ysis may be 
used if the use of urine dipsticks is not feasible.
2.A [ADDRESS_127102] within 72 hours (or an 
immediate spot UPCR test) is required in the following situations:
-The first (initial) occurrence o f ≥2+(≥100 mg/dL) proteinuria on urine dipstick (or 
urinalysis) while the participant is receiving lenvatinib .
-A subsequent increase in severity of urine dipstick or urinalysis proteinuria occurring 
on the same lenvatinib dose level
-When there has been a lenvatinib dose reduction and at the new dose level the urine 
protein dipstick result is ≥2+ (≥100 mg/dL).
3.A 24 -hour urine collection (initiated as soon as possible and at least within 72 hours) to 
verify the grade of proteinuria is required when UPCR is ≥2.4.
Grading of Proteinuria
-Grading according to NCI CTCAE v5.0 will be based on the 24 -hour urinary protein 
result if one has been obtained. If the participant has 4+ proteinuria by [CONTACT_5230] 
(≥1000 mg/dL by [CONTACT_19416]), a 24 -hour urinary protein result is required to confirm 
Grade 3 proteinuria. Management of lenvatinib administration will be based on the 
grade of proteinuria according to Table 7.
Monitoring
-Urine dipstick or urinalysis testing for participants with proteinuria ≥2+ (≥100 
mg/dL) should be performed on Day 15 (or more frequently as clinically indicated) 
until the results have been 1+ (30 mg/dL) or negative for [ADDRESS_127103] be discontinued .
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Diarrhea
An anti -diarrheal agent should be recommended to the participant at the s tart of study 
treatment, and participants should be instructed and educated to initiate anti -diarrheal 
treatment at the first onset of soft bowel movements. The choice of anti -diarrheal agent 
should be individualized to the participant’s clinical circumsta nces and follow standard 
08K59L

medical practice. If signs/symptoms of diarrhea persist despi[INVESTIGATOR_3062], 
instructions contained in Table 7should be follo wed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Hepatotoxicity
Liver function tests (alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], bilirubin 
levels) should be conducted as detailed in the SoA ( Section 1.3.1 and Section 1.3.2 ) and as 
clinically indicated. If signs/symptoms indicating liver injury occur, instructions contained in
Table 7should be followed. Appropriate supportive care should be provided together with 
close monitoring. If hepatic failure (any grade per CTCAE v5) occurs, lenvatinib must be 
discontinued.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Thromboembolic Events
Participants should be advised to p ay attention to symptoms suggestive of venous 
thromboembolic events which include acute onset of shortness of breath, dyspnea, chest pain, 
cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, tachycardia, cyanosis, DVT signs including lower -extremity 
swelling, and warmth to touc h or tenderness. In case any of these symptoms appear, 
participants should be instructed to report such symptoms promptly to the treating physician.  
If a thromboembolic event is confirmed, instructions contained in Table 7should be 
followed. Appropriate supportive care should be provided together with close monitoring. If 
a participant experiences a Grade 3 or a life threatening (Grade 4) thromboembolic reaction, 
including pulmonary embolism, lenvatinib /placebo must be discontinued.
Arterial thromboembolic events (eg, new onset, worsening, or unstable angina, myocardial 
infarction, transient ischemic attack, and cerebrovascular accident) of any grade require study 
treatment discontinuation.

Encephalopathy Syndrome/ Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy 
Syndrome
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome/Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome/ 
Reversi ble Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (PRES/RPLS) is a neurological 
disorder that can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, altered mental function, 
blindness, and other visual or neurological disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension m ay be 
present. MRI is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES/RPLS. Appropriate measures 
should be taken to control BP. In participants with signs or symptoms of PRES/RPLS, 
instructions in Table 7should be followed.

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Hypocalcemia
Serum calcium should be monitored per the SoA ( Section 1.3.1 and Section 1.3.2 ). Corrected 
serum calcium should be used to assess the grade of hypocalcemia per CTCAE v5.0, us ing 
the following formula:
Corrected calcium = ([4 –serum albumin in g/dL] × 0.8 + serum calcium)
The formula is not applicable when serum albumin concentration is normal ( ˃4 g/dL); in 
such situations, the total (uncorrected) serum calcium should be used instead. 
Hypocalcemia should be treated per institutional guidelines (eg, using appropriate calcium, 
magnesium, and Vitamin D supplementation) until resolution.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Hemorrhage
Instructions in Table 7should be followed for the management of hemorrhage. Either resume 
at a reduced dose or discontinue lenvatinib depending on the severity and persistence of 
hemorrhage.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Gastroint estinal Perforation or Fistula Formation
Lenvatinib should be discontinued in any participants who develop gastrointestinal 
perforation of any grade or Grade 4 fistula.
Refer to Appendix 7 for country -specific requirements.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of QT Prolongation
Lenvatinib should be withheld in the event of development of QT interval prolongation 
greater than 500 msec. Lenvatinib should be resumed at a reduced dose when QTc 
prolongation is resolved to <480 msec or baseline. Monitor potassium, calcium and 
magnesium, and replenish as appropriate.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Osteonecrosis of the Jaw
Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with lenvatinib and periodically during 
lenvatinib treatment. Advise participants regarding good oral hygiene practices. Avoid 
invasive dent al procedures, if possible, while on lenvatinib treatment, particularly in 
participants at higher risk. For participants requiring invasive dental procedures, 
discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ. Withhold 
lenvatinib if ON J develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution 
(See Section 6.6. 4).

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127106] likely related to the AE, or an
alternative etiology, and subsequently proper clinical management. The following aspects 
should be considered:
1.Timing of AE onset
Since lenvatinib is dosed daily and continuously due to a relatively short half -life (28 
hours), and pembrolizumab is dosed Q 3W due to a long half -life, lenvatinib can be 
interrupted to assess whether an AE improves/resolves with dechallenge (ie, interruption 
of treatment) based on the following two scenarios:
-If an AE is identified during a treatment cycle (ie, between 2 pembro lizumab doses), 
only lenvatinib dose interruption is needed. 
-If an AE is identified at the beginning of a treatment cycle, lenvatinib can be 
interrupted and dosing of pembrolizumab should be held.
If the participant recovers from an AE in response to lenvatinib interruption (ie, positive 
dechallenge), the event is more likely to be related to lenvatinib. Otherwise, after 
excluding other alternative explanations, an immune -related AE should be consid ered. 
2.Severity of AE
If an AE is suspected to be treatment related and is severe/life threatening at the time of 
onset or is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_113752], action including interrupting both drugs and initiating 
treatment with a corticosteroid (with exception of hypot hyroidism, TIDM) and other 
supportive care should be taken promptly.
3.Participants receiving the combination therapy (pembrolizumab + lenvatinib) must 
discontinue study therapy if any of the following occur:
-ALT or AST >[ADDRESS_127107] >[ADDRESS_127108] and (TBL >[ADDRESS_127109] or INR >1.5).
Although Table 5advises pembrolizumab to be withheld (interrupted), a nd Table [ADDRESS_127110]: MK-7902 105
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127111] -2023
6.6.4 Other Allowed Dose Interruptions
If the participant is receiving treatment with lenvatinib and requires surgery during the study, 
the stop time and restart time of lenvatinib should be as follows:
•For minor procedures: stop lenvatinib at least [ADDRESS_127112] 2 days after, once there is evidence of adequate healing and no risk of bleeding.
•For major procedures: stop lenvatinib at least 1 week (5 half -lives) prior to surgery and 
then restart it at least 2 weeks after, once there is evidence of adequate healing and no 
risk of bleeding.
•For scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, stop lenvatinib for at least 1 
week before the procedure, then restart lenvatinib when deemed clinically appropriate.
6.7 Second Course
All participants who stopped study intervention with SD or better may be eligible for up to an 
additional 17 cycles of pembrolizumab (approximately 1 year) if they progress after initial 
treatment. This retreatment is the Second Course of this study, and a participant is eligible if 
the following conditions are met : 
Either
•Stopped initial study intervention after attaining an investigator determined confirmed 
CR based on RECIST 1.1, and
-Was treated with at least [ADDRESS_127113] 2 treatments with pembrolizumab beyond the date when the initial 
CR was declared
OR
•Had SD, PR, or CR and stopped study intervention after completion of 35 administrations 
(approximately 2 years) of study intervent ion for reasons other than disease progression 
or intolerability
AND
•Experienced centrally -verified radiographic disease progression by [CONTACT_393] 1.[ADDRESS_127114]: MK-7902 106
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127115] -2023
As of Amendment 05: Participants will be considered for Second Course treatment upon 
investigator -assessed radiographic disease progression by [CONTACT_393] 1.1. (Note: participants in 
China will be considered for Second Course after experiencing centrally -verified 
radiographic disease progression by [CONTACT_393] 1.1.)
Participants who discontinue pembrolizumab after attaining CR or who complete treatment 
with pembrolizumab after 35 cycles will continue to receive lenvatinib/placebo alone until 
disease progression is verified by [CONTACT_19377], development of unacceptable toxicity, or 
withdrawal of consent. Participants who are receiving lenvatinib/placebo at the time disease 
progression is verified may continue to receive lenvatinib/placebo during Second Course 
treatment at the discretion of the investigator. Participants who disco ntinue 
lenvatinib/placebo before initiation of Second Course treatment will not restart 
lenvatinib/placebo.
6.8 Intervention After the End of the Study
Upon study termination , participants are to be discontinued and may be enrolled in an 
extension study using pembrolizumab in combination with compound (eg, lenvatinib) if 
available .
6.9 Clinical Supplies Disclosure
The emergency unblinding call center will use the intervention/randomization schedule for 
the study to unblind participants and to unmask study intervention identity of lenvatinib or 
matching placebo . The emergency unblinding call center should only be used in cases of 
emergency (see Section 8.1.10 ). If the emergency unblinding call center is not available for a

Pembrolizumab : Study intervention(s) will be administered by [CONTACT_1755]/or study 
staff according to the specifications within the pharmacy manual.
Lenvatinib/placebo :  Lenvatinib/placebo will be administered by [CONTACT_1755]/or 
study staff in the clinic on Day 1 of each cycle, 0 to 4 hours after pembrolizumab. All other 
lenvatinib/placebo doses will be taken at home. Lenvatinib/placebo will be administered 
accor ding to the specifications in the Pharmacy Manual. An extemporaneous suspension of 
lenvatinib capsules should be used for participants unable to swallow capsules, as detailed in 
the Pharmacy Manual. Please refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for further details.
[IP_ADDRESS] Timi ng of Dose Administration
Pembrolizumab : Pembrolizumab will be administered as a 30 -minute IV infusion on Day 1 
of each 21 -day cycle. Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close 
to 30 minutes as possible. However, given the vari ability of infusion pumps from site to site, 
a window of –5 minutes to +10 minutes is permitted (ie, infusion time is 30 minutes: –5 
min/+10 min).
After Cycle 1 Day 1, pembrolizumab may be administered up to 3 days before or after the 
scheduled Day 1 of e ach subsequent cycle due to administrative reasons.
Lenvatinib/placebo : Lenvatinib 20 mg (two 10 -mg capsules) or matching placebo will be 
taken orally with water (with or without food) once daily at approximately the same time 
each day in each 21 -day cycle . Day 1 of each cycle will be dosed in the clinic, 0 -4 hours after 
pembrolizumab.
If a lenvatinib/placebo dose is missed and cannot be taken within 12 hours, then that dose 
will be skipped, and the next dose will be taken at the usual time of administratio n.
Lenvatinib capsules should be swallowed whole. Alternatively, the capsules can be dissolved 
in a small glass of liquid (ie, water or apple juice) if a participant is unable to swallow or has 
a feeding tube. See the Pharmacy Manual for additional informa tion.

appropriate steps to optimize compliance.
8.1.9 Discontinuation and Withdrawal
Participants who discontinue study intervention before completion of the treatment period 
should be encouraged to continue to be followed for all re maining study visits as outlined in 
the SoA .
Participants who withdraw from the study should be encouraged to complete all applicable 
activities scheduled for the End-of-Treatment visit at the time of withdrawal. Any AEs that 
are present at the time of wit hdrawal should be followed in accordance with the safety 
requirements outlined in Section 8.4.
8.1.10 Participant Blinding/Unblinding
After efficacy IA2, the study was unblinded on 16 -Aug-2023 .Original protocol text that is 
contained in this section has been retained for reference .
STUDY INTERVENTION IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION IS TO BE UNMASKED 
ONLY IF NECESSARY FOR THE WELFARE OF THE PARTICIPANT. EVERY 
EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE NOT TO UNBLIND.
Foremergency situations where the investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent 
with local requirements) needs to identify the intervention used by a participant and/or the 
dosage administered, he/she will contact [CONTACT_113794] a request for emergency unblinding. As requested by [CONTACT_19445], the emergency unblinding call center will provide the information to 
him/her promptly and report unblinding to the Sponsor. Befo re contact[CONTACT_88694] a participant’s intervention assignment, the 
investigator who is a qualified physician should make reasonable attempts to enter the
toxicity grade of the AEs observed, the relation to study intervention, the reason thereof, etc, 
in the medical record. If it is not possible to record this assessment in the medical record 
before the unblinding, the unblinding should not be delayed.
If unblinding has occurred, the circumstances around the unblinding (eg, date, reason, and 
person performing the unblinding) must be documented promptly, and the Sponsor Clinical 
Director notified as soon as possible.
Once an emergency unblinding has taken place, the investigator, site personnel, and Sponsor
personnel may be unblinded so that the appropriate follow -up medical care can be provided 
to the participant.
Nonemergency Unblinding
After Sponsor consultation, participants may be unblinded if knowledge of treatment arm is 
required to guide future treat ment decisions for the participant. Participants must have

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127135] be permanently discontinued for 
nonemergency unblinding to be considered.
For nonemergency unblinding (eg, after cases of centrally -verified PD and treatment 
discontinuation) IRT should be used to unblind the participant’s treatment assignment. The 
emergency unblinding call center should not be used for this purpose.
Participants whose treatment assignment has been unblinded for any reason will continue to 
be monitored in the study.
8.1.11 Calibration of Equipment
The investigator or qualified designee has the responsibility to ensure that any device or 
instrument used for a clinical evaluation/test during a clinical study that provi des information 
about inclusion/exclusion criteria and/or safety or efficacy parameters shall be suitably 
calibrated and/or maintained to ensure that the data obtained are reliable and/or reproducible. 
Documentation of equipment calibration must be retaine d as source documentation at the 
study site.
8.1.12 Tumor Tissue for Biomarker Status
During the screening period, a tumor sample for each participant is required and is to be:
•A newly obtained core orincisional biopsy of a tumor lesion, which was not previously 
irradiated
Or
•An archival tumor tissue sample if a new biopsy is unavailable (depending on protocol 
requirements)
FFPE tissue blocks are preferred to slides. Newly obtained biopsies are preferred to arc hived 
tissue.
Details pertaining to tumor tissue submission can be found in the Procedures Manual .
The central laboratory will use the tissue sample to ascertain PD -L1 status using the PD -L1 
IHC 22C3 pharmDx (Investigational Use Only) diagnostic kit. The d iagnostic test is identical 
to the US FDA -approved PD -L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx diagnostic kit except it is labeled IUO. 
The PD -L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay kit is currently approved to select participants with 
HNSCC for treatment with pembrolizumab.
The PD -L1 CPS1 result will be unmasked to the site.

8.2 Efficacy Assessments
8.2.1 Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease
Throughout this section, the term ‘scan’refers to any medical imaging data used to assess 
tumor burden and may include cross -sectional imaging (such as CT o r MRI), medical 
photography, or other methods as specified in this protocol.
As of Amendment 05: Central tumor response assessments will be discontinued. Imaging 
scans will no longer be submitted to the iCRO nor read by [CONTACT_19377]. Participants still on study 
intervention and participants in Efficacy Follow -up should continue tumor imagi ngand 
investigator assessments of imaging per protocol . (Note: participants in China will continue 
to have BICR tumor response assessments and will continue to submit scans to the iCRO.)
Original protocol text that is contained in this section has been r etained for reference.
In addition to survival, efficacy will be assessed based on evaluation of scan changes in 
tumor burden over time, until the participant is discontinued from the study or goes into 
survival follow -up. The process for scan collection a nd transmission to the iCRO can be 
found in the SIM. Tumor scans by [CONTACT_113795]. For the abdomen and pelvis, 
contrast -enhanced MRI may be used when CT with iodinated contrast is contraindicated, or 
when mandated by [CONTACT_53246]. The same sc an technique should be used in a participant 
throughout the study to optimize the reproducibility of the assessment of existing and new 
tumor burden and improve the accuracy of the response assessment based on scans.
Note: For the purposes of assessing tumor scans, the term “investigator” refers to the local 
investigator at the site and/or the radiological reviewer at the site or at an offsite facility. 
If brain scans are performed, magnetic resonance imaging is prefe rred; however, CT imaging 
will be acceptable, if MRI is medically contraindicated.
Bone scans may be performed to evaluate bone metastases. Any supplemental scans 
performed to support a positive or negative bone scan, such as plain x-rays acquired for 
correlation, should also be submitted to the iCRO.
Expedited confirmation of measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 by [CONTACT_113796]. Confirmation by [CONTACT_113797]’s imaging shows at least [ADDRESS_127137] 1.1 is required before participant randomization.
All scheduled scans for participants will be submitted to the iCRO. In addition, a scan that is 
obtained at an unscheduled time point, for any reason (including suspi[INVESTIGATOR_113755]), should also be submitted to the iCRO if it shows disease progression, 
or if it is used to support a response assessment. All scans acquired within the protocol -
specified window of time around a scheduled scan visit are to be classified as pertaining to 
that visit.

PRODUCT: MK-7902 117
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127138] 1.1, the iCRO will 
verify this progression and email the results to the study site and Sponsor. In clinically stable 
participants, imaging should continue until PD has been verified by [CONTACT_19377] (if initial site -
assessed PD was not verified by [CONTACT_19377], each subsequent scan must be submitted to iCRO 
with verification of PD request until PD has been verified by B ICR).
[IP_ADDRESS] Initial Tumor Scans
Initial tumor scans at Screening must be performed within [ADDRESS_127139] 1.1 for eligibility before randomization .
Tumor scan performed as part of routine clinical management is acceptable for use as 
screening tumor scan if it is of diagnostic quality and performed within 28days before the 
date of randomization and can be assessed by [CONTACT_113798].
If brain scans are required to document the stability of existing metastases, the brain scan 
should be acquired during screening. The specific methods permitted for this study are 
described in the SIM.
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Scans During the Study
The first on -study s can should be performed at Week 6 (42 to 49 days window) from the date 
of randomization. Subsequent tumor scans should be performed every 6 weeks (42 days ± 7 
days) or more frequently if clinically indicated. After [ADDRESS_127140] scans performed every 9 weeks (63 days ± 7 days). Scan timing should 
follow calendar days and should not be adjusted for delays in cycle starts. Scans should 
continue to be performed until disease progression is identified by [CONTACT_113799], the start of new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, or death, 
whichever occurs first.
Treatment beyond centrally -verified PD per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_127141] continue 
tumor assessments as described in the SoA (Section 1.3.1). Investigator assessments are to be 
documented on the eCRF, but sc ans are not to be submitted to the iCRO. Further progression 
and discontinuation of study intervention are to be determined by [CONTACT_093].
Objective response should be confirmed by a repeat scan performed at least [ADDRESS_127142] indication o f a response is observed. Participants will then return to the regular schedule 
scans, starting with the next scheduled scan time point. Participants who receive additional 
scan for confirmation do not need to undergo the next scheduled scan if it is fewer than 4 
weeks later; scans may resume at the subsequent scheduled time point. 
08K59L

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127143] -2023
On-study brain scan should be performed if clinically indicated or to confirm CR (if other 
lesions indicate CR and brain lesions existed at baseline).
[IP_ADDRESS] End-of-treatment and Follo w-up Tumor Scans
As of Amendment 05: follow -up tumor imaging is only required for participants who are 
candidates for Second Course treatment .Imaging scans will no longer be submitted to the 
iCRO nor read by [CONTACT_19377]. Original protocol text that is contained in this section has been 
retained for reference. (Note: participants in China will continue to have BICR tumor 
response assessments and will continue to submit scans to the iCRO.)
If participants discontinue study intervention without documented disease pr ogression, every 
effort is to be made to monitor disease status by [CONTACT_113800], refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Scans are to be continued until one of the following conditions are met:
•disease progression as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 verified by [CONTACT_19377]
•the start of a new anticancer treatment
•pregnancy
•death
•withdrawal of consent
•the end of the study
[IP_ADDRESS] Second Course (Retreatment) Tumor Scans
Tumor scans must be performed within [ADDRESS_127144] scan should be performed at 6weeks ( 42-49 days ) after restarting study 
intervention. Subsequent tumor scans are to be performed every 6weeks ( 42days ±7 days ) 
or more frequently, if clinically indicated. After 48 weeks, scans are to be performed every 9 
weeks ( ±7 days ) or more frequently, if clinically indicated.
Scans are to be performed until:
•disease progression
•the start of a new anticancer tre atment
•withdrawal of consent

•completion of Second Course
•or notification by [CONTACT_1034], whichever occurs first
If participants discontinue study intervention, tumor scans are to be performed at 
discontinuation (±4 -week window) unless previous scans were obtained within 4 weeks of 
discontinuation. If participants discontinue study intervention due to documented disease 
progression, this is the final required tumor scan.
If participants discontinue study intervention without documented d isease progression, every 
effort is to be made to monitor disease status by [CONTACT_113801] 6 weeks (42 
days [±7 days]) until the start of a new anticancer treatment, disease progression, death, or 
the end of the study, whichever occurs first.
[IP_ADDRESS] RECIST 1.1 Assessment of Disease
As of Amendment 05: Central tumor response assessments will be discontinued. Imaging 
scans will no longer be submitted to the iCRO nor read by [CONTACT_19377]. How ever, participants in 
China will continue to have BICR tumor response a ssessments and will continue to submit 
scans to the iCRO .
RECIST 1.1 will be used as the primary measure for assessment of tumor response, date of 
disease progression, and as a basis for all protocol guidelines related to disease status (eg, 
discontinuatio n of study intervention). Although RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_127146] en.
Upon investigator -assessed disease progression, the indicative scan(s) is/are to be submitted 
immediately to iCRO for BICR verification of progression. After submission of scan(s), the 
iCRO will email the assessment to the site and Sponsor.
If disease progression is not verified, the process continues as follows:
•If participant is clinically stable, continue study intervention per protocol
-continue scans per protocol schedule (the next scheduled scan should be ≥[ADDRESS_127147] recent scan acqu ired)
-send scans to iCRO
-continue local assessment
-do not change investigator assessment of progression
-if subsequent scan(s) indicate progression, request verification from iCRO

8.2.2 Patient -reported Outcomes
As of Amendment 05: ePRO assessments will be discontinued.  Original protocol text that is 
contained in this section has been retained for reference.
Itis a best practice and strongly recommended that ePROs are administered before any other 
visit procedures and in the order listed in the SoA, starting with EuroQoL EQ -5D-5L. 
Collection begins at C1 and continues until C35 or treatment discontinuation, wh ichever 
occurs first. 
The PRO questionnaires will be administered:
•Before dosing at Day1, Cycle 1, and then  
•Day 1 of every cycle from Cycle 1 through Cycle 9, then 
•Day 1 of every other cycle through Cycle 17 (C11, C13, C15, C17), then 
•Every 3 cycles t hrough Cycle 35 (C20, C23, C26, C29, C32, C35). 
•Obtain at EOT and Safety FU (if EOT and Safety FU occur before C35).
If the EOT visit happens before the end of the study, PROs will be administered at EOT visit.
PROs will also be administered at the [ADDRESS_127151] be completed to capture the reason the assessment was not performed.

A brief directed physical examination will be conducted by [CONTACT_113803] (consistent with local requirements) per institutional standard.
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses.
[IP_ADDRESS] Full Physical Examination
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical exam ination during 
the Screening period. Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical 
history. The time points for full physical exams are described in Section 1.[ADDRESS_127153] 
dose of study intervention, new clinically significant abnormal f indings and changes from 
Screening physical examination findings will be recorded as AEs.
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses.
[IP_ADDRESS] Directed Physical Examination
For cycles that do not required a fu ll physical exam ination as defined in Section 1.3 , the 
investigator or qualified designee will perform a directed physical exam ination as clinically 
indicated prior to study intervention administration. New clinically significant abnormal 
findings should b e recorded as AEs.
8.3.2 Vital Signs
The investigator or qualified designee will take vital signs at Screening, before the 
administration of each dose of trial treatment and during the Safety Follow -up visit, as 
specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). 
Vital signs i nclude temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], weight, and blood pressure. 
Height will be measured at Screening only.
•BP and heart rate will be measured after the participant has been resting for 5 minutes. 
All BP measurements should be performed on th e same arm, preferably by [CONTACT_113804]. 
•Only 1 BP measurement is needed for participants with systolic BP <140 mm Hg and 
diastolic BR <90 mm Hg. If the participant’s initial BP is elevated (ie, systolic BP ≥140 
mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg), the BP measurement should be repeated at least [ADDRESS_127154] 
5 minutes apart. If the BP assessment (ie, the mean of the [ADDRESS_127155] 5 minutes apart) shows an elev ated BP (systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic BP 
≥90 mm Hg), a confirmatory assessment should be obtained at least 30 minutes later by

•Under exceptional circumstances, participants will have the option of having BP 
measured between visits obtained locally by a health care professional. A diary will be 
provided as a tool to aid the participant in collecting BP evaluations between study visits. 
8.3.3 Electrocardiograms
Electrocardiograms will be obtained as designated in the SoA (Section 1.3). Complete, 
standardized, 12 -lead ECG recordings that permit all 12 leads to be displayed on a single 
page with an accompanying lead II rhythm strip below the customary 3 × [ADDRESS_127157] be in the recumbent position for a period of 
5 minutes prior to the ECG .The Fridericia correction method for calculating QTc will be 
used.
An ECG abnormality may meet the criteria of an AE as described in this protocol (see 
Appendix 3) and the CRF Completion Guidelines. In these instances, the AE corresponding 
to the ECG abno rmality will be recorded on the appropriate CRF.
QTc prolongation has been seen in some lenvatinib studies. Monitor electrocardiograms 
every cycle (as specified in the Schedule of Assessments) in patients with congenital long QT 
syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or those who are taking drugs known 
to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Refer to the lenvatinib 
IB.
8.3.4 Echocardiogram or Multiple Gated Acquisition Scan
A MUGA scan (using technetium -based tracer) or an echocardiogram will be performed to 
assess LVEF as designated in the SoA ( Section 1.3). MUGA or echocardiogram scans should 
be performed locally in accordance with the institution’s standard practice. MUGA scans are 
the preferred modality; however, whichever modality is used for an individual participant at 
baseline should be repeated for all subsequent LVEF assessments for that participant. LVEFs 
as assessed by [CONTACT_113805]. Investigator assessment will be 
based upon institutional reports.
Refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_127158] of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for 
the timing and frequency.
•The investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) 
must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically 
relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory 
reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless 
judged by [CONTACT_19448]’s condi tion.

The ECOG Performance Status is standardized criteria to measure how cancer impacts level 
of functioning (performance status) in terms of ability to care for oneself, daily activity, and 
physical ability (walking, working, etc) with grades 0 to 5.
The investigator or qualified designee will assess ECOG status (see Appendix 9) at 
screening, before the administration of each dose of study intervention and during the 
follow -up period as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).
8.4 Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Other Reportable Safety Events
The definitions of an AE or SAE, as well as the method of recording, evaluating, and 
assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting AE, 
SAE, and other reportable safety event reports can be found in Appendix 3 .
Progression of the cancer under study i s not considered an AE as described in Section 8.4.6
and Appendix 3.
Adverse events, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] 
(or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant ’s legally authorized 
representative).
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safety events. 
Investigators need to document if an SAE was associated wit h a medication error, misuse, or 
abuse.
Investigators remain responsible for following up AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety 
events for outcome according to Section 8.4.[ADDRESS_127169] to seriousness, intensity/toxicity ,and causality.
Adverse events will not be collected for participants during the prescreening period (for 
determination of archival tissue status) as long as that participant has not undergone any 
protocol -specified procedure or intervention. If the participant requires a blood draw, fresh 
tumor biopsy, etc, the participant is first required to provide consent to the main study, and 
AEs will be captured according to guidelines for standard AE reporting.
8.4.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE, SAE, and Other Reportable 
Safety Event Information
All AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events that occur after the participant provides 
documented informed consent, but before intervention allocation/randomization , must be 
reported by [CONTACT_19449] -in or other run -in 
treatment, if the event cause the participant to be excluded from the study, or is the result of a

protoco l-specified intervention, including, but not limited to washout or discontinuation of 
usual therapy, diet, or a procedure.
•All AEs from the time of intervention randomization through [ADDRESS_127171] be reported by [CONTACT_093].
•All AEs meeting serious criteria, from the time of intervention allocation /randomization
through [ADDRESS_127172] be reported by [CONTACT_093].
•All pregnancies and exposure during breastfeeding, from the time of treatment 
allocation /randomization through 120 days following pembrolizumab or 30 days 
following cessation of lenvat inib/placebo, whichever occurs last, must be reported by [CONTACT_1275]. If the participant initiates new anticancer therapy following discontinuation 
of study intervention, the time period for reporting pregnancies and exposure during 
breastfeeding is r educed to 30 days following cessation of study intervention.
•Additionally, any SAE brought to the attention of an investigator at any time outside of 
the time period specified above must be reported immediately to the Sponsor if the event 
is considered rel ated to study intervention.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs or other reportable safety events 
in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a 
death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and the investigator 
considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, 
the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.
All initial and follow -up AEs, SAEs, and other reportabl e safety events will be recorded and 
reported to the Spons or or designee within the time frames as indicated in Table 8.
Exception: A positive pregnancy test at the time of initial screening is not a reportable event 
unless the participant has received study intervention.

8.4.3 Follow -up of AE, SAE, and Other Reportable Safety Event Information
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. SAEs and other reportable safety events, including 
pregnancy and exposure during breastfeeding, ECIs, cancer, and overdose w ill be followed 
until resolution, stabilization, until the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost 
to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). The investigator will also make every attempt to 
follow nonserious AEs that occur in randomized participants for outcome. Further 
information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3.
8.4.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE
Prompt notification (within 24 hours ) by [CONTACT_113809] a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulator y agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements and global laws and 
regulations relating to safety reporting to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs, and in vestigators.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for S[LOCATION_003]Rs according to local regulatory 
requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAE s) from the Sponsor will file it 
along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
8.4.5 Pregnancy and Exposure During Breastfeeding
Although pregnancy a nd infant exposure during breastfeeding are not considered AEs, any 
pregnancy or infant exposure during breastfeeding (spontaneously reported to the 
investigator or their designee) that occurs in a participant during the study are reportable to 
the Sponsor .
All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy.
Any pregnancy complication will be reported as an AE or SAE.
The medical reason (example: maternal health or fetal disease) for an elective termination of 
a pregnan cy will be reported as an AE or SAE. Prenatal testing showing fetus will be born 
with severe abnormalities/congenital anomalies that leads to an elective termination of a 
pregnancy will be reported as an SAE for the fetus.
Pregnancy outcomes of ectopic pre gnancy, spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign 
hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage, and stillbirth 
must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to 
term, the outc ome (health of infant) must also be reported.

8.4.6 Disease -related Events and/or Disease -related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
AEs or SAEs
Efficacy endpoints as outlined in this section will not be reported to the Sponsor as described 
inSection 8.4.
Specifically, the suspected/actual events covered in this exception include any event that is 
disease progression of the cancer under study.
The Sponsor will ensure that unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data 
are monitored to safeguard the participants in the study.
8.4.[ADDRESS_127178] for this study include:
1.An overdose of Sponsor's product, as defined in Secti on 8.5, that is not associated with 
clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results. 
Lenvatinib overdose without an associated adverse event is not considered an ECI.
2.Potential DILI events defined as an elevated AST or ALT laboratory value that is great er 
than or equal to 3 ×the ULN and an elevated total bilirubin laboratory value that is greater 
than or equal to 2×the ULN and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase laboratory 
value that is less than 2 ×the ULN, as determined by [CONTACT_13149] -speci fied laboratory 
testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.*
*Note: These criteria are based on available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose 
of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an 
additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. The study -site guidance for assessment 
and follow up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or 
equivalent).
8.5 Treatment of Overdose
For purposes of this study, an overdose will be defined as any dose exceeding the prescribed 
dose for:
•Pembrolizumab: ≥5 times the protocol -specified dose.
•Lenvatinib: any dose above the protocol -prescribed dose if associated with an adverse 
event
There is no specific antidote for an overdose of lenvatinib. D ue to its high degree of plasma 
protein binding, lenvatinib is not expected to be dialyzable. Adverse reactions in patients

9 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN
As of Amen dment 05: The Statistic al Analysis Plan is amended as follows.
NOTE: Based on the data from an interim safety and efficacy analysis for LEAP -010(data
cutoff 30-May-2023), the study will be discontinued due to lack of efficacy because 
pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib did not demonstrate an improvement in OS, 
one of the trial ’s primary endpoints, compared to pembrolizumab plus placebo and appears 
unlikely to do so in a future analysis. Based upon these data and the recommendation of the 
eDMC, the study was unblinded on16-Aug-2023. The prespecified interim analysis 3 ( IA3)
and final analysis of the study described in the SAP will not be performed. Safety analysis 
will be performed at the end of the study; there will be no further planned analyses for
efficacy and ePRO endpoints.
This section outlines the statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. The study 
has been unblinded as of 16-Aug-2023. Changes made to primary and/or key secondary 
hypotheses, or the statistical methods related to those hypotheses that occurred prior to 
Amendment 05 were documented in previous protocol amend ments(s) (consistent with 
International Conference on Harmoni sation [ ICH]Guideline E -9). Changes to exploratory or 
other nonconfirmatory analyses made after the protocol has been finalized, but before the 
conduct of any analysis, will be documented in an sSAP and referenced in the CSR for the 
study. The PRO analysi s plan will also be included in the sSAP.
Details pertaining to the statistical analyses for participants enrolled in China will be 
provided in a separate sSAP.
9.1 Statistical Analysis Plan Summary
Key elements of the SAP are summarized below. The comprehensi ve plan is provided in 
Section 9.2 –Responsibility for Analyses/In -House Blinding through Section 9.12 –Extent 
of Exposure. As of Amendment 0 5, the prespecified IA3 and final analysis of the study
described in the SAP will not be performed. Safety analys is will be performed at the end of
the study; there will be no further planned analyses of efficacy and ePRO endpoints. The 
SAP summary has been updated accordingly.

OverviewA Phase 3 study of pembrolizumab (MK -3475) with or without 
lenvatinib (E7 080/MK -7902) as 1L intervention in a PD -L1 
selected population with R/M HNSCC (LEAP -010)
Treatment 
AssignmentApproximately 500 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 
ratio treatment groups: (1) the pembrolizumab + lenvatinib arm 
and (2) t he pembrolizumab + placebo arm. Stratification factors 
are: 
•PD-L1 tumor expression as determined by [CONTACT_4002] -L1 
immunohistochemistry (TPS <50% vs. ≥50%)
•HPV status for oropharynx cancer as determined by p16 
immunohistochemistry (positive vs. negative); HPV status 
for participants without oropharynx cancer (eg, cancers of 
the oral cavity, hypopharynx and larynx) is considered HPV 
negative.
•ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1)
This is a randomized double -blind study.

Interim Analyses As of Amendment 0 5, the prespecified IA3and final analysis of 
the study described in the SAP will not be performed.
Efficacy
Three interim analyses are planned in this study. Results will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_113814]. Details are provided in Section 
9.7.
•Interim Analysis 1 (IA1):
-Timing: to be performed after 350 participants are 
randomized with 6 months o f follow -up
-Primary purpose: efficacy analysis for ORR and PFS
•Interim Analysis 2 (IA2): 
-Timing: to be performed after both ~[ADDRESS_127195] been observed and ~ 6months after last participant 
randomized
-Primary purpose: efficacy analysis for PFS and OS
•Interim Analysis 3 (IA3): 
-Timing: to be performed after both ~[ADDRESS_127196] 
occurred and ~ [ADDRESS_127197] participant

-Primary purpose: efficacy analysis for OS
•Final Analysis (FA): 
-Timing: to be performed after both ~[ADDRESS_127198] 
occurred and ~ [ADDRESS_127199] participant 
randomized
-Primary purpose: efficacy analysis for OS
Note that for IA2, IA3 and the FA, if the events accrue more 
slowly than expected, the analysis can be delayed up to 3 
months after the projected ti ming.
Safety :
The first safety interim analysis will be performed and reviewed 
by [CONTACT_113815] [ADDRESS_127200] been 
randomized, whichever is later. Afterwards, the eDMC will 
review s afety data periodically in the study. Details will be

Multiplicity The overall Type I error over the primary hypotheses is strongly 
controlled at 2.5% (1 -sided), with 0.25% initially allocated to 
ORR (H1), 0.1% to PFS (H2), and 2.15% to OS (H3).
By [CONTACT_113816] [Maurer,

90.4% power for detecting a 20 -percentage point difference 
between treatment arms with an underlying 20% response rate 
in the control arm at an initially assigned 0.0025 (1 -sided) 
significance leve l.
It is estimated that there will be ~ 432 events at the PFS final 
analysis (ie , IA2 of the study). With 432 PFS events, the study 
has >99.9% power for detecting a hazard ratio of 0.5 at an 
initially assigned 0.001 (1 -sided) significance level. 
There wil l be ~ 361 deaths at the OS final analysis. With 
361deaths, the study has ~90.7% power for detecting a hazard 
ratio of 0.7 at an initially assigned 0.0215 (1 -sided) significance 
level. 
9.2 Responsibility for Analyses/In -house Blinding 
The statistical analysis of the data obtained from this study will be the responsibility of the 
Clinical Biostatistics department of the Sponsor.
After efficacy IA2, the study was unblinded on 16 -Aug-2023.
This study will be conducted as a double -blinded study under in -house blinding procedures. 
The official, final database will not be unblinded until medical/scientific review has been 
performed, protocol deviations have been identified, and data have been declared final and 
complete.
The Sp onsor will generate the randomized allocation schedule for study treatment 
assignment for this protocol and the randomization will be implemented in IVRS/IWRS.
The investigator and the study team at the Sponsor consisting of clinical, statistical, statisti cal 
programming and data management personnel will be blinded to participant -level PD -L1 
biomarker score. An unblinded Sponsor statistician and unblinded Sponsor statistical 
programmer will have access to the participant -level PD -L1 results for the purpose of data 
review and will have no other responsibilities associated with the study. A summary of PD 
L1 biomarker prevalence may be provided to the study team at the Sponsor by [CONTACT_113817]. In addition, the independent radiologist(s) w ill perform the central 
imaging review without knowledge of treatment group assignment.

9.6 Statistical Methods
9.6.1 Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses
NOTE: As of Amendment 0 5, the prespecified IA3 and final analysis of the study described 
in the SAP will not be performed. Safety analysis will be performed at the end of the study; 
there will be no further planned analyses of efficacy and ePRO endpoints. Original protocol 
text that is contained in this section has been retained for reference.
This section describes the statistical methods that address the primary and secondary
objectives. Methods related to exploratory objectives will be described in the supplemental 
SAP.
Efficacy results that will be deemed to be statistically significant after consideration of the 
Type I error control strategy are described in Section 9.8, Mu ltiplicity. Nominal p -values 
may be computed for other efficacy analyses but should be interpreted with caution due to 
potential issues of multiplicity and sample size.
The stratification factors used for randomization (see Section 6.3.2 -Stratification) will be 
applied to all stratified analyses, in particular, the stratified log -rank test, stratified Cox 
model, and stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method [Miettinen, O. and Nurminen, M. 
1985] . If there are sma ll strata, for the purpose of analysis, strata will be combined to ensure 
sufficient number of participants, responses or events in each stratum. Details regarding the 
pooling strategy will be prespecified in the sSAP before the database lock for the first
efficacy interim analysis, and decisions regarding the pooling will be based on a blinded 
review of response and event counts by [CONTACT_64264].
[IP_ADDRESS] Objective Response Rate
The stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method [Miett inen, O. and Nurminen, M. 1985] will 
be used for comparison of the ORR between two treatment groups. The difference in ORR 
and its 95% confidence interval from the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method with 
strata weighting by [CONTACT_113819]. The stratification factors used for 
randomization (See Section 6.3.2 -Stratification) will be applied to the analysis. The point 
estimate of ORR will be provided by [CONTACT_1570], together with 95% CI using exact 
binomial method proposed by [CONTACT_113820] (1934) [Clopper, C. J. and Pearson, E. S. 
1934] . Supportive analyses may be performed for comparison of ORR based on 
investigator’s assessment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Progression -free Survival
The nonparametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the PFS curve in each 
treatment group. The treatment difference in PFS will be assessed by [CONTACT_113821] -rank 
test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron’s method of tie handling will be 
used to ass ess the magnitude of the treatment difference (ie, hazard ratio) between the 
treatment arms. The hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval from the stratified Cox 
model with Efron’s method of tie handling and with a single treatment covariate will be 
reported. The stratification factors used for randomization (See Section 6.3.2 -Stratification)

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127208] and the stratified Cox model. Supportive 
analyses may be performed for comparison of PFS based on investigat or’s assessment.
Since disease progression is assessed periodically, PD can occur any time in the time interval 
between the last assessment where PD was not documented and the assessment when PD is 
documented. The true date of disease progression will be a pproximated by [CONTACT_113822] 1.1 by [CONTACT_113823]. Death is considered a PD event.
For the primary analysis, any participant who experiences an event (PD or dea th) 
immediately after [ADDRESS_127209] sensitivity analysis 
follows the intention -to-treat p rinciple. That is, PDs/deaths are counted as events regardless 
of missed study visits or initiation of new anticancer therapy. The second sensitivity analysis 
considers discontinuation of treatment due to reasons other than complete response or 
initiation of new anticancer treatment, whichever occurs later, to be a PD event for 
participants without documented PD or death. If a participant meets multiple criteria for 
censoring, the censoring criterion that occurs earliest will be applied. The censoring rules for 
the primary and sensitivity analyses are summarized in Table 9.

[IP_ADDRESS] Overall Survival
The nonparametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the survival curves. The 
treatment difference in survival will be assessed by [CONTACT_113821] -rank test. A stratified 
Cox proportional hazard model with Efron’s method of tie handling will be used to assess the 
magnitude of the treatment difference (ie, the hazard ratio). The hazard ratio and its 95% 
confidence interval from the stratified Cox model with a single treatment co variate will be

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127214] to multiple endpoints and interim 
analyses is described in Section 9.7 (Interim Analyses) and Section 9.8 (Multiplicity).
9.6.2 Statistical Methods for Safety Analyses
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_113824], laboratory tests and vital signs.
The analysis of safety results will follow a tiered approach ( Table 12). The tiers differ with 
respect to the analyses that will be performed. Adverse events (specific terms as well as 
system organ class terms) and events that meet predefined limits of change in laboratory and 
vital si gns parameters are either prespecified as “Tier 1” endpoints or will be classified as 
belonging to “Tier 2” or “Tier 3” based on the observed proportions of participants with an 
event.
Tier [ADDRESS_127215] t hat are identified a priori constitute 
“Tier 1” safety endpoints that will be participant to inferential testing for statistical 
significance. AEs that are immune -mediated or potentially immune -mediated are well 
documented and will be evaluated separately; however, these events have been characterized 
consistently throughout the pembrolizumab clinical development program, and determination 
of statistical significance is not expected to add value to the safety evaluation. Finally, there 
are no known AEs asso ciated with participants with HNSCC for which determination of a p -
value is expected to impact the safety assessment. Thus, there are no AEs that warrant 
elevation to Tier 1 in this study.   
Tier 2 Events
Tier 2 parameters will be assessed via point estim ates with 95% CIs provided for differences 
in the proportion of participants with events using the Miettinen and Nurminen method, an 
unconditional, asymptotic method [Miettinen, O. and Nurminen, M. 1985] .
Member ship in Tier [ADDRESS_127216] 10% of participants in any treatment group show 
the event; all other AEs will belong to Tier 3. The threshold of at least 10% of participants 
was chosen for Tier 2 events because the population enrolled in this study i s in critical 
condition and usually experiences various AEs of similar types regardless of treatment; 
events reported less frequently than 10% of participants would obscure the assessment of the 
overall safety profile and add little to the interpretation o f potentially meaningful treatment 
differences. In addition, Grade 3 to 5 AEs ( ≥5% of participants in 1 of the treatment groups), 
SAEs (5% of participants in 1 of the treatment groups) and tumor hemorrhage (incidence ≥4 
of participants in one of the treatm ent groups) will be considered Tier 2 endpoints. Because 
many 95% CIs may be provided without adjustment for multiplicity, the CIs should be 
regarded as a helpful descriptive measure to be used in safety review, not as a formal method 
for assessing the sta tistical significance of the between -group differences.

The eDMC wasresponsible for periodic interim safety reviews as specified in the DMC 
charter. Details wereincluded in the DMC charter. Safety monitoring will continue as per

9.8 Multiplicity
NOTE: As of Amendment 0 5, the prespecified IA3 and final analysis of the study described 
in the SAP will not be performed. Original protocol text that is contained in this section has 
been retained for reference.
The study uses the graphical method of Maurer and Bretz [Maurer, W. and Bretz, F. 2013] to 
control multiplicity for multiple hypotheses as well as interim analyses. According to this 
approach, study hypotheses may be tested more than once, and when a particular null 
hypothesis is rej ected, the α allocated to that hypothesis can be reallocated to other 
hypothesis tests. Figure 6shows the initial 1 -sided α allocation for each hypothesis in the 
ellipse representing the hypothesis. The weights for re -allocation from each hypothesis to the 
others are shown in the boxes on the lines connecting hypotheses.
The overall Type -I error is strongly controlled at 0.025 (1 -sided) for the [ADDRESS_127229]: MK-7902 149
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127230] -2023
to PFS. If both the OS and PFS hypotheses are rejected, the corresponding alpha can be 
reallocated to ORR.

Figure 6, the PFS hypothesis may be tested at α=0.001 (initially allocated α ), at α=0.0035 (if 
the ORR null hypothesis is rejected but not the OS hypothesis), at α=0.0225 (if the OS null 
hypothesis is rejected but not the ORR hypothesis), or at α=0.025 (if both the OS and ORR 
null hypotheses are rejected). For the superiority hypo thesis, a Lan -DeMets O’Brien -Fleming 
alpha spending function is used to construct group sequential boundaries to control the Type -
I error rate. Table 15shows the bou ndary properties for each of these α levels for the PFS 
analysis. Note that the final row indicates the total power to reject the null hypothesis for PFS 
at each α level. Also, note that if the OS null hypothesis is rejected at IA3 or FA of the study, 
the previously computed PFS test statistics may be used for inferential testing with its 
updated bounds, considering the α reallocation from the OS hypothesis.
For the PFS hypothesis H2, IA2 will be the final PFS analysis with a target number of events 
of 432. The bounds provided in Table 15are based on the assumption that the number of 
events at IA1 and IA2 are [ADDRESS_127235] ion to determine the 
alpha spending at the IA will be based on the minimum of the expected information fraction 
and the actual information fraction at the analysis.
•In the scenario that the event accumulation is faster than expected, ie, if the number of 
observed events exceeds the expected number of events at IA1, then the information 
fraction will be calculated as the expected number of events at IA1 over the target 
number of events at IA2. 
•In the scenario that the event accumulation is slower than expec ted and number of events 
is less than the expected number of events in the table when IA1 is conducted, the 
information fraction will be calculated as the actual number of events at IA1 over the 
target number of events at IA2. 
The final PFS analysis will use the remaining Type I error that was not spent at the earlier 
analysis. The p -value bound at the final PFS analysis will be calculated by [CONTACT_113828]1 and IA2 of the study.

the PFS null hypothesis is rejected but not the ORR hypothesis), or α=0.025 (if both the PFS 
and ORR null hypotheses are rejected). For the superiority hypothesis, a Lan -DeMets 
O’Brien -Fleming alpha spending function is used to construct group sequential boundaries to 
control the Type I error rate. Table 16shows the boundary properties for each of these α 
levels for the OS analysis. The bounds provid ed in the table are based on the assumption that 
the number of events at IA2, IA3 and FA are 258, 326 and 361, respectively. At the time of 
an analysis, the observed number of events may differ substantially from the expected. To 
avoid overspending at an i nterim analysis and keep reasonable alpha for the final analysis, 
the minimum alpha spending strategy will be adopted. At an IA, the information fraction 
used in Lan -DeMets spending function to determine the alpha spending at the IA will be 
based on the mi nimum of the expected information fraction and the actual information 
fraction at each analysis.
•In the scenario that the event accumulation is faster than expected, ie, if the number of

The final OS analysis will use the remaining Type I error that has not been spent at the earlier 
analyses. The event counts for all analyses will be used to compute correlations.
Of note, while the information fraction used for alpha spending calculation will be the 
minimum of the actua l information fraction and the expected information fraction, the 
correlations required for deriving the bounds will still be computed using the actual 
information fraction based on the observed number of events at each analysis over the target

The minimum spending approach assumes timing is not based on any observed Z -value and 
thus the Z test statistics used for testing conditioned on timing are multivariate normal. Given 
the probabilities derived with the proposed spending method, the correlations based on actual 
event counts are used to comput e bounds that control the Type I error at the specified alpha 
level for a given hypothesis conditioned on the interim analysis timing. Since this is true 
regardless of what is conditioned on, the overall Type I error for a given hypothesis 
unconditionally is controlled at the specified level. By [CONTACT_113829], power can be retained to detect situations where the treatment effect may 
be delayed.

9.9 Sample Size and Power Calculations
NOTE: As of Amendment 0 5, the prespecified IA3 and final analysis of the study described 
in the SAP will not be performed. This section is retained for reference.
The study will randomize 500 part icipants in a 1:1 ratio into the pembrolizumab + lenvatinib 
arm and pembrolizumab + placebo arm. ORR, PFS and OS are primary endpoints for the 
study.
Based on the [ADDRESS_127240] 6 months of follow -up, the power of the ORR 
testing at the ini tially allocated α=0.0025 (1 -sided) is approximately 90.4% to detect a 20 -
percentage point difference between an underlying 20% response rate in the control arm and 
a 40% response rate in the experimental arm.
For the PFS endpoint, based on a target number of 432 events at the final analysis and 1 
interim analysis at approximately 81% of the target number of events, the study has 
approximately >99.9% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.5 at the initially allocated α=0.001 
(1-sided). 
For the OS endpoint, ba sed on a target number of 361 events and 2 interim analyses at 
approximately 71% and 90% of the target number of events, the study has approximately 
90.7% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.7 at the initially allocated α=0.0215 (1 -sided).
Based on [Burtness, B., et al 2018] , the above sample size and power calculations for PFS 
and OS assume the following:
•PFS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 3 months for the control group. 
•OS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 12 months for the control group. 
•Enrollment period of [ADDRESS_127241] 6 months. 
•An annual dropout rate of 5% for PFS and OS.
•A follow -up period of [ADDRESS_127242] 
participant is randomized.

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Append ix1: Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations
10.1.[ADDRESS_127247] for Clinical Trials
[COMPANY_006] Sharp & Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ, [LOCATION_003] (MSD)
I.Introduction
A.Purpose
MSD through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials wo rldwide to evaluate the safety 
and effectiveness of our products. As such, we are committed to designing, 
implementing , conducting, analyzing, and reporting these trials in compliance with 
the highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of partici pants in clinical trials 
is the overriding concern in the design and conduct of clinical trials. In all cases, 
MSD clinical trials will be conducted in compliance with local and/or national 
regulations (including all applicable data protection regulations) , and International 
Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) ,and also in 
accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.
B.Scope
Highest ethical and scientific standards shall be endorsed for all clinical 
interventional investigations sponsored by [CONTACT_19481] (parties) 
employed for their execution (e.g., contract research organizations, collaborative 
research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials that are observational in 
nature, or which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator -
initiated trials, which are not under the full control of MSD.
II.Scientific Issues
A.Trial Conduct
1.Trial Design
Except for pi[INVESTIGATOR_19354], clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -
driven to assess safety, efficacy, and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic 
indices of MSD or comparator products. Alternatively, MSD may conduct 
outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or 
trials to determine patient preferences, etc.
The design (i.e., participant population, duration, statistical power) must be 
adequate to address the specific purpose of the trial .Participants must meet 
protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial.
08K59L
PRODUCT: MK-7902 156
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127248] -2023
2.Site Selection
MSD selects investigative sites based on medical expert[INVESTIGATOR_18700], access to appropriate 
participants, adequacy of facilities and staff, previous performance in clinical 
trials, as well as budgetary conside rations. Prior to trial initiation, sites are 
evaluated by [CONTACT_26397] (or individuals acting on behalf of MSD) to assess 
the ability to successfully conduct the trial.
3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity
Investigative trial sites are monitored to as sess compliance with the trial protocol 
and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). MSD reviews clinical data for accuracy, 
completeness, and consistency. Data are verified versus source documentation 
according to standard operating procedures. Per MSD policies and procedures, if 
fraud, scientific/research misconduct or serious GCP -non-compliance is 
suspected, the issues are investigated. When necessary, the clinical site will be 
closed, the responsible regulatory authorities and ethics review committees 
notified.
B.Publication and Authorship
Regardless of trial outcome, MSD commits to publish the primary and secondary 
results of its registered trials of marketed products in which treatment is assigned, 
according to the pre -specified plans for data analysis. To the e xtent scientifically 
appropriate, MSD seeks to publish the results of other analyses it conducts that are 
important to patients, physicians, and payers. Some early phase or pi[INVESTIGATOR_113758] g; in such cases, 
publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be underpowered and 
the analyses complicated by [CONTACT_19482].
MSD’s policy on authorship is consistent with the recommendations published by [CONTACT_19483] (ICMJE). In summary, 
authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and conduct of the 
trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. 
All named au thors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. MSD 
funding of a trial will be acknowledged in publications.
III.Participant Protection
A.Regulatory Authority and Ethics Committee Review (Institutional Review Board 
[IRB]/Independent Ethic s Committee [IEC])
All protocols and protocol amendments will be submitted by [CONTACT_113833]/authorization prior to implementation of the trial or amendment, 
in compliance with local and/or national regulations.
The protocol, proto col amendment(s), informed consent form, investigator’s 
brochure, and other relevant trial documents must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_113834]/IEC before being implemented at each site, in compliance with local and/or 
national regulations. Changes to the pro tocol that are required urgently to eliminate

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127249] participant safety, in c ompliance with local and/or national 
regulations.
B.Safety
The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials is that participant welfare is 
of primary importance. Potential participants will be informed of the risks and 
benefits of, as well as a lternatives to, trial participation. At a minimum, trial designs 
will take into account the local standard of care.
All participation in MSD clinical trials is voluntary. Participants enter the trial only 
after informed consent is obtained. Participants ma y withdraw from an MSD trial at 
any time, without any influence on their access to, or receipt of, medical care that 
may otherwise be available to them .
C.Confidentiality
MSD is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the greatest extent 
possible. Unless required by [CONTACT_2371], only the investigator, Sponsor (or individuals acting 
on behalf of MSD), ethics committee, and/or regulatory authorities will have access 
to confidential medical records that might identify the participant by [CONTACT_2300].
D.Genomic Research
Genomic research will only be conducted in accordance with a protocol and informed 
consent authorized by [CONTACT_19486].
IV.Financial Considerations
A.Payments to Investigators
Clinical trials are time -and labor -intensive. It is MSD’s policy to compensate 
investigators (or the sponsoring institution) in a fair manner for the work performed 
in support of MSD trials. MSD does not pay incentives to enroll participants in its 
trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional payments 
may be made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts.
MSD does not pay for participant referrals. However, MSD may compensate 
referring physicians for time spent on chart review and medical evaluation to identify 
potentially eligible participants.
B.Clinical Research Funding
Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_19487], and that the 
investigator or sponsoring institution is being paid or provided a grant for perfor ming 
the trial. However, the local ethics committee may wish to alter the wording of the 
disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As 
noted above, all publications resulting from MSD trials will indicate MSD as a s ource 
of funding.

10.3 Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
10.3.[ADDRESS_127260].
10.3.2 Definition of AE
AE definition
•An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the 
study intervention.
•Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a study intervention.
•Note: For purposes of AE definition, study intervention includes any pharmaceutical 
product, biological product, vaccine, diagnostic agent, medical device, combination 
product, or pro tocol -specified procedure whether investigational or marketed (including 
placebo, active comparator product, or run -in intervention), manufactured by, licensed 
by, provided by, or distributed by [CONTACT_63553].
Events meeting the AE definition
•Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically signifi cant in the medical 
and scientific judgment of the investigator.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
08K59L
PRODUCT: MK-7902 165
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127261] -2023
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after study i ntervention administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study
intervention or a concomitant medication.
•For all reports of overdose (whether accidental or intentional) with an associated AE, the 
AE term should reflect the clinical symptoms or abnormal test result. An overdose 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results is reported using 
the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”
Events NOT meeting the AE definition
•Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
•Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
•Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of t he study that do not worsen.
•Surgical procedure(s) planned prior to informed consent to treat a preexisting condition 
that has not worsened.
•Refer to Section 8.4.[ADDRESS_127262] medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
-The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of length of stay, even 
if the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19358] a pr eexisting condition that has not 
worsened is not an SAE.) A preexisting condition is a clinical condition that is 
diagnosed prior to the use of an MSD product and is documented in the participant’s 
medical history.

PRODUCT: MK-7902 166
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127263] -2023
d.Results in persistent or significant d isability/incapacity
-The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
-This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
-In offspring of participant taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis.
f.Other important medical events
-Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63474] 1 
of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be 
consider ed serious.
-Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias ,or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug depende ncy 
or drug abuse.
10.3.4 Additional Events Reported
Additional events that require reporting
In addition to the above criteria, AEs meeting either of the below criteria, although not 
serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Sponsor.
•Is a new cancer (th at is not the cancer under study) as noted in Section 8.4.1 .
•Is associated with an overdose.
10.3.5 Recording AE and SAE
AE and SAE recording
•When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event.
•The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE information on the AE 
CRFs/worksheets at each examination.
•It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_113759]’s medical 
records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE CRF page.

•There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_88650]. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the pa rticipant 
number, will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_19361].
•The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the dia gnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of intensity /toxicity
•An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, not when it is rat ed as severe.
Assessment of causality
Follow -up of AE and SAE
•The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_19514] /or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.
•New or updated information will be recorded in the CR F.
•The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.
10.3.6 Reporting of AEs, SAEs, and Other Reportable Safety Events to the Sponsor
AE, SAE, and other reportable safety event reporting to Sponsor via electronic data 
collection tool
•The primary mechanism for reporting to the Sponsor will be the EDC tool.
-Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines (or 
equivalent).
-If the electronic system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use 
the paper AE Reporting form.
-Reference Section 8.4.1 for reporting time requirements.
•The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.
•After the study is completed at a given site, the EDC tool will be taken off -line to prevent 
the entry of new data or changes to existing data.
08K59L
PRODUCT: MK-7902 168
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-[ADDRESS_127265] -2023
•If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data 
on a previously reported SAE after the E DC tool has been taken off -line, then the site can 
report this information on a paper SAE form or by [CONTACT_756] (see next section).
•Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or 
equivalent).
SAE reporting to the Sponsor via paper CRF
•If the EDC tool is not operational, facsimile transmission or secure email of the SAE 
paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to the Sponsor.
•In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
[CONTACT_9337] a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by [CONTACT_19515].
•Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designate d reporting time frames.
•Contacts and instructions for SAE reporting and paper reporting procedures can be found 
in the Investigator Study File Binder (or equivalent).

10.5 Appendix 5: Contraceptive Guidance
10.5.1 Definitions
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal 
unless permanently sterile (see below):
If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot 
be confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be 
considered.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:
•Premenarchal
•Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
-Documented hysterectomy
-Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]
-Documented bilateral oophorectomy
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above (eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be 
applied to determining study entry.
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
•Postmenopausal female
-A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause.
◦A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be u sed to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or HRT. 
However, in the absence of [ADDRESS_127268]: MK-7902 171

10.5.2 Contraceptive Requirements
Contraceptives allowed during the study includea:
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Have Low User Dependency
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
Progestogen -only subdermal contraceptive implantb
IUSc
Nonhormonal IUD
Bilateral tubal occlusion
Azoospermic partner (vasectomized or secondary to medical cause)
This is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male sexual partner of 
the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method 
of contraception should be used. A spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days.
Note: Documentation of azoospermia for a male pa rticipant can come from the site personnel’s review of 
the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
Sexual Abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from het erosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the participant.
aContraceptive use by [CONTACT_93335].
bIf locally required, in accordance with CTFG guidelines, acceptable contraceptive implants are limi ted to those 
which inhibit ovulation.
cIUS is a progestin releasing IUD.
Note: The following are not acceptable methods of contraception:
Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, postovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), 
spermicides only, and LAM.
Male condom with cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide.
Male and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction).

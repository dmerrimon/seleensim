2. INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
2.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  & RATIONALE  
 
Energy has been applied in some form to tissue since the beginning of recorded history.  The practice of applying heat to tissue through the use of cauteries was used for thousands of years as an invaluable method of controlling hemorrhage.  Continuous improvement of methods for utilizing the beneficial effects of heat on tissue eventually led to the development of the basic concepts of electrosurgery we know today.  In October of 1926, [CONTACT_518465] used an electrosurgical unit developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Willia m T. Bovie to successfully remove a highly vascularized 
brain tumor from a patient after previous failed attempts.  Today, electrosurgical instruments are used in almost 
every surgical procedure performed worldwide.
1 
Through this long history, the heat effects of the radiofrequency (RF) alternating current used in electrosurgery on 
cells and tissue have been well established.  Normal body temperature is 37°C and, with normal illness, can increase 
to 40°C without perman ent impact or damage to the cells of our body.  However, when the temperature of cells in 
tissue reaches 50°C, cell death occurs in approximately 6 minutes.2 When the temperature of cells in tissue reaches 
60°C, cell death occurs instantaneously.3 Between the temperatures of 60°C and just below 100°C, two simultaneous 
processes occur.[ADDRESS_931299] is protein denaturation leading to coagulation which will be discussed in more detail 
below.  The second is desiccation or dehydration as the cells lose water through the thermally damaged cellular wall.  
As temperatures rise above 100°C, intrac ellular water turns to steam and tissue cells begin to vaporize as a result of 
the massive intracellular expansion that occurs.  Finally, at temperatures of 200°C or more, organic molecules are 
broken down into a process called carbonization.  This leaves behind carbon molecules that give a black and/or 
brown appearance to the tissue.  
 Understanding these heat effects of RF energy on cells and tissue can allow the predictable changes to be used to 
accomplish beneficial therapeutic results.  Protein denaturation leading to soft tissue coagulation is one of the most 
versatile and widely ut ilized tissue effects.  Protein denaturation is the process in which hydrothermal bonds 
(crosslinks) between protein molecules, such as collagen, are instantaneously broken and then quickly reformed as 
tissue cools.  This process leads to the formation of uniform clumps of protein typi[INVESTIGATOR_148061] a subsequent process known as coagulation.  In the process of coagulation, cellular proteins are altered but not 
destroyed and form protein bonds that create homogenous, gelatinous structures.  The resulting tissue effect of 
coagulation is extremely useful and most commonly used for occluding blood vessels and causing hemostasis.  
 
In addition to causing hemostasis, coagulation results in predictable contraction of soft tissue.  Collagen is one of the 
main proteins found in human skin and connective tissue.  The coagulation/denaturation temperature of collagen is 
conventionally state d to be 66.8°C, although this can vary for different tissue types.
[ADDRESS_931300] 
been used for the reduction of facial wrinkles and rhytides caused by [CONTACT_148100] -induced collagen/tissue contraction 
since the mid -1990s.6-11 
 
Recently, the use of thermal -induced collagen/tissue contraction has been expanded to minimally invasive 
procedures.  Laser -assisted lipolysis (LAL) and radiofrequency- assisted lipolysis (RFAL) devices have combined the 
removal of subcutaneous fat with sof t tissue heating to address  the skin laxity that often results from fat volume 
 
 
APX-21-02                                         Title: Gynecomastia Pi[INVESTIGATOR_687066]: [ADDRESS_931301] suction- assisted lipolysis 
(SAL) cannula and are used to deliver thermal energy to coagulate the subcutaneous tissue including the underside 
of the dermis, the fascia, a nd the septal connective tissue.  The coagulation of the subcutaneous tissue results in 
collagen/tissue contraction.   
 
Apyx Medical Corporation’s product family of helium -based plasma technology (Renuvion/J -Plasma family of 
devices) has FDA clearance for the cutting, coagulation, and ablation of soft tissue.  The Renuvion APR  Handpi[INVESTIGATOR_148062] 
a new device designed to be a part of this helium- based plasma technology family. All devices in the product family 
are part of a system that consists of an electrosurgical generator unit, a handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], and a supply of helium gas.  RF 
energy i s delivered to the handpi[INVESTIGATOR_148063].  When helium gas is passed 
over the energized electrode, a helium plasma is generated which allows heat to be applied to tissue in two different 
and distinct ways.  First, heat is generated by [CONTACT_687096].  Second, since plasmas are very good electrical conductors, a portion of the RF energy used to energize the electrode and generate the plasma passes from the electrode t o the patient 
and heats tissue by [CONTACT_148102], a process known as Joule heating.  These 
two sources of tissue heating give the Renuvion APR  device some advantages during use as a surgical tool for the 
coagulation and contraction of subcutaneous soft tissue.   
 
These advantages are as follows:  
1. The Renuvion APR  Handpi[INVESTIGATOR_687073] 85°C for between 0.040 and 0.080 seconds.   
2. The tissue surrounding the treatment site remains at much cooler temperatures resulting in rapid cooling after the application of the energy through conductive heat transfer.  
3. Focused delivery of energy on immediate heating of the fibroseptal network resulting in immediate soft 
tissue coagulation and contraction without unnecessarily heating the full thickness of the dermis.  
4. 360° tissue treatment without the need for the user to redirect the flow of energy due to electrical energy 
taking the path of least resistance.  
5. Unencumbered delivery of power regardless of the tissue impedance due to the unique power output from the electrosurgical generator.  
6. Low current RF energy resulting in minimal depth of thermal effect and prevention of over -treating tissue 
when performing multiple passes.  
 
Gynecomastia is a benign enlargement of the male breast due to proliferation of the glandular tissue.  It affects up 
to 65% of males at all stages of life, however, not all require surgical intervention.

oC and 40.2oC.  These temperatures were recorded after performing six consecutive passes of the 
Renuvion system under the same area of tissue.  Six consecutive passes under the same tissue was 
included in the  study to represent a “worst case” scenario.  Six passes are not commonly performed 
clinically.  However, even in this “worst case” scenario the epi[INVESTIGATOR_687080].  Pedroso, et.al, reported that because of superficia l thermal safety concerns, the skin 
surface temperature should be maintained below 45
oC.  This study was subsequently published1.  The 
summary of the published study is as follows:  
J-Plasma helium was used in porcine, liver, kidney and muscle tissue at 20%, 50% and 100% power 
and 1 L/min and 3 L/min gas flow at 1, 5, and 10 second intervals.  J -Plasma was then used in 
ovarian and uterine tissue at maximum power and gas flow settings in intervals of 1, 5, 10 and 30 
seconds.  Concluded that J -Plasma has predictable thermal spread in a variety of tissue types.  
Thermal depth of spread increased linearly with increased power setting, gas flow rate, and 
exposure time.  Even at settings that greatly exceeded the manufacturer’s recommendation, the depth of thermal spread associated with the J -Plasma device was less than 3 mm (regardless of the 
type of tissue) and the diameter of lateral spread was 12 mm or less.  
2. RP-18040201:  A Study Evaluating Tissue Contraction, External Tissue Temperature, and Internal 
Tissue Temperature When Using J- Plasma (Renuvion) on Ex Vivo Abdominoplasty Tissue (non -GLP)  
This was a pre -clinical study that was performed on ex vivo human tissue collected by a surgeon during 
previously conducted abdominoplasty procedures.  The Renuvion system was used to coagulate the 
subdermal tissue of the human skin samples at various trea tment parameters.  During treatment, both 
the maximum external epi[INVESTIGATOR_687081].  The maximum external tissue temperatures ranged from 24.9
oC to 37.8oC.  This da ta serves to validate the maximum external tissue temperatures of 39.1oC and 
40.2oC reported in RP -18032301 measured in a live porcine model.  The maximum internal tissue 
temperatures ranged from 40oC to 80oC.  It is known from the literature that the reported range of 
temperatures causing collagen shrinkage varies from 60oC to 80oC.  Therefore, in order to cause soft 
tissue coagulation and collagen contraction, the target internal tissue temperature should be within this range.  Both the external and inter nal temperatures remained within safe limits when using the 
Renuvion system to coagulate the subdermal tissue of human skin samples.  
 
The results of the above summarized pre- clinical testing support the safe and effective use of the 
Renuvion® system in dermatological and general surgical procedures involving subdermal tissue coagulation.

ecchymosis, hypoesthesia, temporary sensory nerve injury (touch sensitivity, itching, temporary numbness/tingling), 
transient migratory firmness, and temporary and/or transient c repi[INVESTIGATOR_72831].  
 
In addition to commonly expected treatment effects, treatment with the Renuvion APR device could involve the 
following risks: helium embolism into the surgical site due to inadvertent introduction into the venous or arterial 
blood supply system, unintended burns (deep or superficial), pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, temporary or 
permanent motor nerve injury, ischemia, fibrosis, infection, gas buildup, bleeding, hematoma, seroma, 
subcutaneous induration, pi[INVESTIGATOR_16576], increased healing time, unsatisfactory scarring, asymmetry and/or 
unacceptable cosmetic result.

The following pre -treatment assessments will be performed:  
• Subject Gynecomastia Grade will be determined . 
• Baseline imaging – frontal, lateral, and oblique views.  
• Brief medical history and physical examination per the Investigator’s standard of care.  
• STPTUP  (Figure 3). 
• STPTIMF  (Figure 4). 
• Bilateral chest measurements ( Table 2) 
 
Medications  that the  subject is taking upon entry into the study should also be documented in the Case Report Forms 
(CRF). All concomitant prescription medications taken during study participation will be recorded on the appropriate 
study specific CRF. For this protocol, a prescription medication is defined as a medication that can be prescribed only 
by a properly authorized/l icensed clinician. Medications to be reported on the CRF and entered on the eCRF are 
concomitant prescription medications, over -the-counter medications, and non- prescription medications.  
Medication used for analgesia and/or anesthesia should be recorded as concomitant medication as well. To ensure 
the capture of the foregoing information on pre -existing conditions, sites should also be attentive to the need to 
document without limitation a nd whenever discovered: (1) all chronic, epi[INVESTIGATOR_95817] ‘as needed’ medications used 
before study enrollment; (2) prior epi[INVESTIGATOR_95817] ‘as needed’ therapeutic interventions, procedures , or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]; 
and (3) recent or planned surgical procedures.   
7.2 STUDY PROCEDURE  
The bilateral gynecomastia surgery and Renuvion APR System use will be as per investigator’s standard clinical 
practice. During the procedure, fat transfer and treatment of the lateral chest and/or axilla is not allowed. The

7.5.7 END OF STUDY  (COMPLETION ) 
All subjects who have signed an Informed Consent Form  will be considered enrolled in the study. Subjects who 
complete the study duration will be considered to have completed the study. The end of study will be defined as completion of all study visits by [CONTACT_232507]. If a device -related AE, SAE, or unanticipated serious device -
related effect is ongoing at the final study visit, the subject will be followed until resolution, unt il the condition 
stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  
 
A study closure visit may be conducted at the study site to  review record retention requirements, device disposition 
requirements, etc., with site personnel.  The Sponsor may choose to conduct the closure visit via telephone contact 
[CONTACT_687105].  
 
 
APX-21-02                                         Title: Gynecomastia Pi[INVESTIGATOR_687066]: [ADDRESS_931331] (ETE)  AND AN ADVERSE EVENT (AE) 
An expected treatment effect is defined as any typi[INVESTIGATOR_453390] -effect of Renuvion APR  System of mild to 
moderate severity and lasting up to a typi[INVESTIGATOR_453391].  An  adverse event is defined as any new medical 
problem, or exacerbation of an existing problem, experienced by a subject while enrolled in the study, whether or 
not it is considered device -related by [CONTACT_093].   
 
 A preexisting condition (one that is present at the start of the study) will be recorded as an AE only if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period. Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an AE in the following circumstances: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_687091] a preexisting condition. Surgery should  
not be reported as an outcome of an AE if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome 
was uneventful.  
 
All ETEs and AEs will be collected during the conduct of this trial.   
8.1.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE)  
Each adverse event should be assessed for its seriousness. The definition below should be used for this assessment. 
Please note that the term serious adverse event is not synonymous with a “severe” adverse event, which may be 
used to describe the intensity of an event experienced by [CONTACT_423].  
 
An adverse event should be classified as serious if it meets any of the following criteria:  
a. Death  
Death was an outcome of the adverse event.  
b. Life-threatening  
The subject was at substantial risk of dying at the time of the adverse event or  use or continued use of 
the device.  
c. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged)  
Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274358] a result of the adverse event.  
d. Disability or Permanent Damage  
The adverse event resulted in a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life 
functions, i.e., the adverse event resulted in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in the patient's body functio n/structure, physical activities and/or quality of life.  
e. Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect  
Exposure to a medical product prior to conception or during pregnancy may have resulted in an adverse outcome in the child.  
f. Required Intervention to Prevent Permanent Impairment or Damage (Devices)  
Medical or surgical intervention was necessary to preclude permanent impairment of a body function, or prevent permanent damage to a body structure, either situation suspected to be due to the use of 
a medical product.  
g. Other Serious (Important Medical Events)  
The event does not fit the other outcomes, but the event may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes.  
 
 
 
APX-21-02                                         Title: Gynecomastia Pi[INVESTIGATOR_687066]: 01   Page 29 of 42 
Non -serious adverse events are all events that do not meet the criteria for a “serious” adverse event.  
8.1.3  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECTS (EVENTS ) 
An unanticipated adverse device effect is defined as “any serious adverse effect on health or safety, or any life-
threatening problem, or death caused by, or associated with, a device; if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan, or application (including 
supplementary application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the 
rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.”  
8.[ADDRESS_931332], using the following classifications:  
 
• Mild:  easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday 
activities. These events generally do not require treatment.  
• Moderate:  sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.  These events are 
usually relieved by [CONTACT_14212].  
• Severe:   prevents normal, everyday activities.  These events may require systemic drug therapy or other 
medical treatment.  
8.2.2  RELATIONSHIP TO THE INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE  
The investigators should differentiate between device and procedure related AEs by [CONTACT_687106] “device related” and events that occur from the procedure, irrespective of the device, as “procedure related ”.  Since the study device delivers helium -based plasma energy to the tissue, events 
directly attributable to the application of energy to the tissue (i.e. burns) or the use of helium (i.e. gas buildup) should 
be classified as device related.  Events that are known to occur in subdermal procedures utilizing tumescent 
anesthesia and/or undermining of soft tissue (i.e. edema
17,18, hematoma18,19, nerve injury19, pain/tenderness17) 
without the use of the study device should be classified as procedure related.   The relationship to the study device and/or procedure will be determined by [CONTACT_518449]:  
• Not Related: An event for which an alternative explanation is conclusively identified –  e.g., concomitant 
drug(s), concomitant disease(s), and/or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is highly 
unlikely.  
• Related: The adverse event follows a reasonable temporal sequence related to treatment by [CONTACT_518450]/or study procedure, follows a known or suspected response pattern and a plausible alternative etiology 
cannot be identified.  
• Undetermined: The relation of the adverse event has some temporal relationship to the device and/or study 
procedure, is not clearly due to another condition and the involvement of the study device is unknown.  
 
The investigator should assess the relationship of the adverse event to the investigational device. The relationship should be assessed using the categories presented in Table 6. 
TABLE 6. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ADVERSE EVENTS AND INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE  
Definite  Definite relationship exists between the device/procedure and an adverse event  
Probably Related  A reasonable causal relationship between the device/procedure and an adverse 
event is more likely than not.  
 
 
APX-21-02                                         Title: Gynecomastia Pi[INVESTIGATOR_687066]: 01   Page 30 of 42 
Possibly Related  A reasonable relationship exists between the device/procedure and an adverse 
event, but the causal relationship is unclear or lacking.  
Not Likely Related  A temporal relationship exists between the device/procedure and an adverse 
event, but there is no reasonable causal relationship. For example,  the adverse 
event occurs in a time frame, which makes a causal relationship to device 
treatment improbable.  
Unrelated  No relationship between treatment with the device/procedure and the adverse 
event exists.  
 
8.3 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may  come to the attention of study personne l during a study visit or upon review by 
a study monitor. All ETEs and AEs will be captured on the appropriate CRF. Information  to be collected include s event 
description, date  of onset, clinician’s assessment of seriousness and s everity, relationship to study device/treatment  
(assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a determination ), actions taken, an d date of event 
resolution . All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship.  
 
A pre -existing condition should not be reported as an adverse event unless there has been a substantial increase in 
severity or frequency of the problem that has not been attributed to natural history. C hanges in the severity of an 
event will be documen ted to allow for a determination if the event should be re -categorized from an ETE to AE.   
Safety evaluations for this study include an interview with the study subject at each follow -up visit by [CONTACT_518451]. This informati on will be documented in CRF without regard for cause or relation to device and/or procedure.  
In addition, study subjects will be instructed in the Informed Consent Form, post -procedure take -home instructions, 
and verbally by [CONTACT_687107]/are obs erved. Study staff will ensure that monitoring and management of all adverse events is 
prioritized.  
Study investigators are provided liberty to mitigate adverse events as deemed necessary per IHC GCP Guidelines 
E6(R2)4.3.2 which states “During and following a subject’s participation in a trial, the investigator/institution should 
ensure that adequate med ical care is provided to a subject for any adverse events related to the trial”.  
Adverse event resolution dates will be determined by [CONTACT_148128]- person or remote (phone, video 
call, text, email, etc.) examinations or communication with the subject.  To ensure the most accurate reporting of 
adverse event durations, investigators are instructed not to wait until scheduled office follow -up visits to assess 
resolution.  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to determine seriousness, severity, and relatedness of the Adverse Event to the device and procedure using the definitions in this protocol.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_687092] 
7 (for non-serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. At each study visit, the 
investigator will inqui re about  the occurrence of ETEs/ AEs/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for 
outcome information  until resolution or stabilization. 
8.4 REPORTING PROCEDURES  
8.4.1  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
All Adverse Events (AEs) and Expected Treatment Effects (ETEs) observed by [CONTACT_4866], investigators, or other 
study staff from first exposure to the study product through last study follow -up visit will be recorded. If a device -

investigations as may be indicated to elucidate, as completely as practical, the nature and/or causality of the AE or 
SAE. This may include unscheduled follo w up visits for AE assessment.  
 
Study subjects will be instructed in the ICF, post -treatment take home instructions, and verbally by [CONTACT_518453].  AE information will be collected throughout the duration of the study and 
recorded on CRFs.  
 Any new medical problem, or an exacerbation of an existing condition, reported from the time the informed consent 
form is signed must be followed until the last study visit after the last study treatment or until event resolution.   
8.4.[ADDRESS_931334]’s death, regardless of whether the death is related or unrelated to the 
investigational device. The investigator should attempt to determine, as conclusively as possible, whether the death 
is related to the device. The cause of death and the investigator’s discussion regarding whether or not the death was 
device -related should be described in a written report. The investigator mush report death to the reviewing IRB 
according to the IRB regulations at the study site.  
8.5 STUDY HALTING RULES 
This clinical trial  will be halted  if subjects’ safety is questioned based on a reporting of severe, device -related AEs at 
an excessive frequency.  The Sponsor and/or investigator may recommend termination or modification of the study 
if there is an occurrence of any device-  or treatment -related Serious Adverse Event, using the clinical protocol 
definitions of Serious Adverse Event. In addition, termi nation or modification may be recommended for any other 
perceived safety concern based on clinical judgment, including but not limited to a sev ere burn (anticipated or 
unanticipated), a higher than anticipated rate for any component of the safety measures, device failures resulting in Adverse Events, or unexpected SAEs. T he study sponsor will notify all investigators to immediately halt  any

When, in judgment of the chairman of the IRB, the investigators and/or the Sponsor, the amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the subject, the currently approved written Informed Consent Form will require similar modification. In such cases, repeat informed consent will be obtained 
from subjects enrolled in the study before continued participation.  
16. CONFLICT  OF INTEREST  POLICY  
The independence of this study from any actual or perceived influence is critical. Therefore, any actual conflict of interest of 
persons who have a role in the design, conduct, analysis, publication, or any aspect of this trial will be disclosed and 
managed. Furthermore, persons who have a perceived conflict of interest will be required to have such conflicts managed 
in a way that is appropriate to their participation in the trial. The study leadership has established policies and proced ures 
for all study group members to disclose all conflicts of interest and will establish a mech anism for the managemen t of all 
reported dualities of interest.

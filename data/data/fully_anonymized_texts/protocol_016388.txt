 Protocol Summary  
Protocol Number:  HP-00054854  
Protocol Title:  Postoperative Heme Oxygenase Induction 
and Carbon Monoxide Production as a Novel 
Method to Assess Hepatic Regeneration and 
Predict Hepatic Related Morbidity After 
Partial Hepatectomy  
Study Rationale:  The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the 
role of HO-1 induction in hepatic 
regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH). 
There is a growing body of evidence that HO -
[ADDRESS_1254653] the following two hypotheses: (1) 
HO-1 induction after PH is proportional to 
the extent of the surgi cal resection, and (2) 
failure to appropriately induce HO -1 is 
associated with impaired hepatic 
regeneration.   
Study Objectives:  Specific Aim 1: To monitor the extent of HO -1 
induction (by [CONTACT_894981]) in relationship to the extent  of 
hepatic resection  
1.1 Monitor CO in exhaled air of patients 
before liver resection, at 4 hours and 24 
hours after PH  
1.2 Monitor carboxyhemoglobin(COHb) in 
the arterial blood gas of patients before liver 
resection at 4 hours and 24 hours after PH  
1.3 A nalyze the relationship between CO 
production and the extent of hepatic 
resection assessed by [CONTACT_894982], size and weight of the resected 
specimen and operative report.  
Specific Aim 2: To analyze the relationship 
between HO -[ADDRESS_1254654] -hepatectomy liver regeneration after PH  
3 
 2.1 Analyze the relationship between CO 
production and  the quantity and quality of 
hepatic regeneration assessed by [CONTACT_894983] y at one and three 
months after PH and liver function tests after 
PH. 
2.2 Determine the relation between 
postoperative liver related morbidity in 
patients undergoing PH and the extent of 
postoperative HO -1 induction  
Study Design:  Study design:  
Aim 1.1: Th e monitoring of exhaled CO is 
based on previous report of assessing 
exhaled CO in septic patients. Exhaled CO will 
be determined with an infrared CO analyzer 
with a sensitivity of 0.1 ppm at 4 hours and 
24 hours after PH  
Aim 1.2: Arterial blood gas (ABG) w ill be 
collected from patients before liver 
resection, at 4 hours and 24 hours after PH. 
The ABG will be obtained through an arterial 
line usually placed as part of perioperative 
monitoring of the patient hemodynamic. This 
model was found accurate in refle cting HO -1 
induction in previous study in patient 
receiving liver transplantation.  
Aim 1.3: FLR will be calculated through liver 
volumetric study from a pre -resectional CT 
scan. The operative note will be checked for 
operative details regarding the number of 
resected hepatic segments and pathological 
examination of the specimen will allow 
accurate weight of the resected specimen.  
According to the resected amount of hepatic 
parenchyma, three groups of patients will be 
created (<25%, 25 -50% and >50% PH) histo ry 
of smoking and intraoperative blood 
transfusion will be reported for each patient.  
 
Procedures and Methods  
- Protocol:  
For collecting exhaled air specimen, each 
patient will be instructed to exhale 
completely, and then  
4 
 take a deep breath, hold it for 20  seconds, 
and breathe out through D shaped flatpak 
mouth pi[INVESTIGATOR_894972]  
 
- Equipment:  
A Micro+ CO monitor (Bedfont Scientific Ltd, 
Wales, England) will be used to analyze CO 
level in a single breath in exhaled air. The 
device will be used by  [CONTACT_894984] -bacterial 
filter and one -way valve for increased 
infection control.  
The device has adjustable breath -hold 
countdown timer for patients who are unable 
to hold their  breath. Calibration will be 
performed every [ADDRESS_1254655] and analyze CO concentration 
within a range of: 0 -250 ppm with a 
sensitivity of 0.1 ppm and accuracy of ±2% in 
< [ADDRESS_1254656] evaluation of the COHb level will be 
performed using an arterial blood gas 
analyzer (ABL 800 Flex, Radiometer,  
Copenhagen) and will be reported as % of the 
total Hb as well as calculated amount in 
mg/mL.  
 
- Assessment of postoperative liver function 
and regeneration:  
Liver volumetry will be measured using image 
J software downloaded from  
http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/. The accuracy of 
this method was reported in a prior study.  
Volumetric study will be performed based on 
CT scan studies obtained as standard of care  
preoperatively before each liver resection 
and at one and three months after each  
resection.  
Collected data will be reported as percentage 
compared to the preoperative hepatic 
volume.  
Specific Aim 2: To analyze the relationship 
between HO -[ADDRESS_1254657] -hepatectomy liver regeneration  
5 
 2.1 Analyze the relationship be tween CO 
production and the quantity and quality of 
hepatic regeneration assessed by [CONTACT_894985].  
2.2 Determine the relation between hepatic 
related morbidity in patients u ndergoing 
partial hepatectomy and their ability to 
induce HO -1 
 
Study design:  
Aim 2.1: As CO is uniquely produced by [CONTACT_894986]; its level was previously validated to 
check HO -1 induction. Checking this level and 
comparing outcome of the previously create d 
three groups of patients (<25%, 25 -50% and 
>50% PH) according to their ability to induce 
HO-1 after PH. Liver regeneration will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_894987].  
Aim 2.2: HO -[ADDRESS_1254658] in different 
clinical and surgical occasions. In this setting 
of PH, surgical complications in the 
perioperative (30 days) period graded by 
[CONTACT_452829] -Dindo Cla ssification will be reported 
and analyzed regarding its relation with the 
ability to induce HO -1. 
 
Procedures and Methods:  
Liver function tests routinely checked on 
daily basis till normalization will be 
monitored. This includes serum protein, 
Albumin, liv er enzymes (AST and ALT), 
alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin level. The 
duration needed to this normalization will be 
checked as well as the trend of each of these 
laboratory parameters.  
Hepatic morbidity will be evaluated using the 
criteria used by [CONTACT_894988]#[ADDRESS_1254659]  hepatectomy liver failure  
requires no cha nge of the patient's clinical 
management. The clinical management of 
patients with grade B post  hepatectomy liver 
failure deviates from the regular course but 
does not require invasive therapy. The need 
for invasive treatment defines grade C post  
hepatecto my liver failure. The Clavien -Dindo 
classification will be used to document 
surgical outcome of patients after PH.  
 
Analyses:  
All results will be collected in Excel 
Document. Analyses of groups based on the 
extent of liver resection and CO production.  
Resu lts of different subgroups will be 
analyzed; comparison between groups will be 
performed by [CONTACT_894989], paired and 
unpaired student t test, main Whitney test or 
ANOVA with repeated measurements when 
appropriate. Significance is defined as 
p<0.05.  
 
Potenti al problems and alternative strategy:  
It is possible that HO -[ADDRESS_1254660] and 
influence the result of this study. 
Preoperative factors may include 
preoperative use of chemotherapy and the 
presence of underlying liver cirrhosis. 
Intraoperative factors may  include operative 
time and surgical technique (open or 
minimally invasive).  In case of significance 
variance between patient s in the same 
group ( same percentage of PH) Subgroup 
analysis including different variants  
(preoperative chemotherapy, perioperative 
7 
 blood transfusion and open versus minimally 
invasive technique) will be used to assess the 
effect of these factors.

 1. INTRODUCTION  
Inducible Heme Oxygenase (HO - 1), an enzyme critical for heme catabolism, is also involved in 
cellular response to oxidative stress. We have previously shown that induction of HO -[ADDRESS_1254666] oxidative 
stress suggesting a systemic factor; however, the mechanism of this protection is unclear. Our 
follow -up study showing that carbon monoxide (CO) the product of heme catabolis m by [CONTACT_146417] -1, 
can mimic this protection suggests that CO itself may be the important active molecule. Recent 
animal work has independently shown that HO -[ADDRESS_1254667] the 
relevance of this observation in human patients undergoing partial hepatectomy by [CONTACT_894991]. To achieve objective, 
we will pursue two specific aims: (1) we will monitor th e extent of HO -1 induction (by 
[CONTACT_894992]) in relationship to the extent of hepatic resection (2) we 
will assess the production of CO in patients following liver resection and correlate these 
findings to the rate of liver regenerati on and liver function. This research will establish a 
framework for understanding the role of HO -1 induction in liver regeneration and will provide a 
foundation for developi[INVESTIGATOR_894973].   
2. STUDY OBJECTIVE   
The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the role of HO -1 induction in hepatic regeneration after 
partial hepatectomy (PH). There is a growing body of evidence that HO -[ADDRESS_1254668] 
the following two hypotheses: (1) HO -1 induction after PH is proportional to the extent of the 
surgical resection, and (2) failure to appropriately induce HO -1 is associated with impaired 
hepatic regeneration.    
3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN   
This is a University of Maryland Medical System multi -site study being done at University of 
Maryland Medical Center and UM Baltimore Washington Medical Center.  
11 
 The study will monitor carbon monoxide production in patien ts undergoing liver resection and 
aims to identify the relationship between CO production and recovery after this resection.  
Carbon monoxide will be checked from arterial blood gas obtained routinely as a part of the 
postoperative care as well as from the exhaled air of the patient through  a CO detector 
commercially available and used as smokerlyzer helpi[INVESTIGATOR_894974]. The results of 
the surgical resection will be collected from the patient routinely ordered tests after liver 
resection including pathology of the resected part of  the liver, laboratory and radiology tests.   
The study duration for each individual patient is approximately 3 months +/ - [ADDRESS_1254669] -operative care, as well as from exhaled air measured through a CO 
detector. This study involves  prospective data collection that does no interfere with treatme nt 
plan  of participants .

 collection, and analysis will be discussed. After answering all patient questions and explaining 
the patient rights including refusal to participa te, the patient will be offered to participate in 
the study. Patients who will accept to participate will be asked to sign the participation consent 
form.  It is a prospective data collection without interference with the treatment plan.  
For Aim 1, CO will  be monitored before a patient’s liver resection, and at [ADDRESS_1254671] -
hepatectomy, as well as liver function tests PH.

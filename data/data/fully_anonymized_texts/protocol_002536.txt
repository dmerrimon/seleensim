 4.  INTRODUCTION   
 4.1.  Introduction   
Mitochondria normally produce a small amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including 
superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide as physiological by[CONTACT_86175] (ATP) production.  Under conditions of metabolic or genetic stress, 
mitochondria can become a ma jor endogenous source of ROS such as superoxide anions, 
peroxynitrite, and hydroxyl radicals.  Increased oxidative damage to the inner membrane of the 
mitochondria leads to imbalances in the electron transport chain, resulting in further increased 
superoxi de and hydrogen peroxide production, which in turn can initiate a cycle of further 
damage to membrane and mitochondrial proteins and mitochondrial DNA.  Excess ROS can 
damage mitochondrial proteins and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_86152] a point that triggers mitochondria to releas e 
cytochrome c and provoke apoptosis ( Madsen -Bouterse, 2008 ).  Apoptotic cell death can 
manifest in the eye as visual abnormalities affecting the retina and cornea.  
Fuchs’ Corneal Endothelial Dystrophy (FCED) is a vision -threatening condition that is 
characterized by [CONTACT_86176]. FCED typi[INVESTIGATOR_86153] ( Adamis, 1993 ). Vision loss can result from several pathologic changes: the 
development of corneal guttae, which degrade the refractive properties of the cornea; the 
presence of stromal edema, arising from the increased permeability of Descemet’s membrane 
and endotheli um along with pump dysfunction in the endothelium; and the development of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_86148] ( Waring, 1982 ).  If untreated, the bullae may rupture, causing infection, pain, 
and eventual vascularization and opacity of the cornea ( Yanoff, 1996 ).  FCED is thou ght to 
occur in about 4% of the US population over age 40 ( Krachmer, 1978 ). At present, the only 
treatment is corneal transplantation; no non -surgical therapy is available.  
There is growing evidence that oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis o f FCED 
(Jurkunas, 2010 ). As early as 1986, decreased numbers of mitochondria and a reduced activity of 
cytochrome oxidase in mitochondria was detected in FCED corneas ( Tuberville, 1986) .  
Antibodies against lipid peroxidation and other ROS by[CONTACT_86177] ( Buddi, 2002 ).  A marker of oxidative damage, 8 -hydroxy -2’-deoxyguanosine, 
was shown in FCED endothelial cells to co -localize to mitochondria, strongly suggesting that in 
FCED the mitochondrial genome is the target of  oxidative stress ( Jurkunas, 2010) . In addition, 
endothelial cells and Descemet’s membrane from human corneas of patients with FCED 
demonstrate marked overexpression of clusterin, a protein that is overexpressed in many tissues 
undergoing stress ( Jurkunas 2008a ). Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) to compare the 
endothelial of normal patients and those with FCED has shown alteration in the expression of 
genes regulating cellular energy metabolism, pump functions, and apoptotic and antioxidant cell 
defense. Mitochondrial transcripts accounted for the majority of the downregulated genes 
(Elhalis, 2010) . Peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) are a novel class of antioxidants that remove cellular

FCED ( Jurkunas, 2008b ).    
  
MTP -131 reduces mitochondrial oxidative stress by [CONTACT_86178] ( Birk, 2013) .  In cell cultures, 
MTP -131 has been shown to reduce glucose - and peroxide - induced oxidat ive stress and 
apoptosis and to improve survival of human retinal endothelial cells ( Li, 2011 ), human trabecular 
meshwork cells ( Chen, 2011 ), and human retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_86154] ( Liang, 2010 ).  
Intraperitoneal administration of MTP -131 in mice reduc ed laser -induced choroidal 
neovascularization more than 50% ( Liang, 2010 ), and when given subcutaneously to 
streptozotocin -induced diabetic rats, reduced oxidative stress, prevented apoptosis, and reduced 
VEGF -2 receptor expression and retinal leakage of E vans Blue dye ( Huang, 2013 ).  MTP -131 
given subcutaneously ( Alam, 2012 ) or topi[INVESTIGATOR_897] ( Prusky, 2013)  to high fat and/or 
streptozotocininduced diabetic mice prevented and corrected visual functional loss. As noted 
above, the pathophysiology of FCED in humans  is characterized by [CONTACT_86179]. Thus, it is theorized that treatment with MTP -[ADDRESS_94258] on mitochondrial oxidative stress

Written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects or their legal guardian(s) prior to the 
Screening Visit. Once written consent has been provided, data will be collected from a complete 
pre-treatment examination, consisting of vital signs, routine blood chemistries, serum pregnancy 
test for women of child -bearing potential, measurement of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 
using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale , manifest refraction, 
contrast sensitivity, specular microscopy, corneal pachymetry, Pentacam, intraocular pressure 
(IOP) measurement, and slit lamp examination.

Version 1.0    Confidential and Proprietary   Page 15 of 48  This Screening Visit examination will be performed no more than 28 days prior to the Basel ine 
Visit.  If applicable, urine pregnancy testing will be performed prior to initiation of treatment.  
The study eye will be determined via randomization. Patients will be considered enrolled in the 
study upon randomization. The day of randomization is de fined as Study Day 1.   
Patients will receive one drop of MTP -131 1.0% ophthalmic solution topi[INVESTIGATOR_86155]. At the time 
of randomization, patients will be read a standar d script explaining the importance of applying 
the correct drug product to each eye twice a day on a daily basis.  
 6.2.  Discussion of Design and Control  
In this study, MTP -131 1.0% ophthalmic solution will be administered twice per day for 84 days 
to ev aluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy for the treatment of FCED.  Approximately 16 
subjects are planned to be enrolled into the study.  Randomization will be used to minimize bias 
in the assignment of subjects’ eyes to treatment or vehicle, and to increase the likelihood that 
known and unknown ocular attributes are evenly balanced across groups.  Masked treatment will 
be used to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluation of clinical endpoints.  
    
6.2.1.   Dose Justification  
The dose selected for this clinical study is based on data from nonclinical pharmacology studies 
in metabolically stressed mice, where both 1% and 3% MTP -131 applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_86156] a dose dependent manner ( Prusky, 2004 ).  
Additionally, MTP -131 given subcutaneously to high fat and/or streptozotocin -induced diabetic 
mice prevented and corrected visual functional loss ( Alam, 2012 ) and subcutaneously to 
streptozotocin -induced d iabetic rats reduced oxidative stress, prevented apoptosis, and reduced 
VEGF -2 receptor expression and retinal leakage of Evans Blue dye ( Huang, 2013 ).    
In the recently completed SPI[INVESTIGATOR_86157] -101 clinical trial, twice daily dosing with MTP -131 ophthalmic 
soluti on administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_86158] 0.3% and 1.0% for 28 days to subjects 
with DME and age -related macular degeneration was well tolerated at both doses and in subjects 
with both ocular conditions.  There were no significant safety or tolera bility findings in that 
study.  This is consistent with the 90 -day toxicology studies, completed in rabbits and dogs, in 
which no treatment -related systemic toxicity or ocular pathology affecting the major 
visioncritical structures of the eye was observed.  Mononuclear cell infiltrates in the palpebral 
and bulbar conjunctivae and nictitating membranes were observed in the more sensitive species 
(dog), which regressed during a recovery phase. Although the aforementioned preclinical 
toxicological findings were  reversible upon cessation of treatment, in any patient complaining of 
persistent, local ocular irritation such as stinging or burning upon instillation of drops, the 
MTP131 treatment regimen should be stopped.

7.3.1.   Discontinuation of Subjects  
A subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, and without 
repercussion.  
The investigator and sponsor have the right to withdraw a subject from the study in the event of 
an intercurrent illness, AE, treatment failure, preg nancy, protocol violation, cure,  
non-compliance with study visits, and for administrative or other reasons.  An excessive rate of 
withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of 
subjects should be avoided.

3. Severity (as determined by [CONTACT_1697]) of corneal stromal folds  
• Change from Baseline in contrast sensitivity  
 9.2.  Safety Evaluations  
The investigator is responsible for monitoring the safety of subjects who have entered this study 
and for alerting the sponsor or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event 
may be considered an unanticipated benefit to the subject.  T he investigator is responsible for the 
appropriate medical care of subjects during the study.  The investigator remains responsible for 
following, through an appropriate health care option, AEs that are serious, considered related to 
the study treatment or  the study, or that caused the subject to discontinue before completing the 
study.    
The safety profile of MTP -[ADDRESS_94266]’s signature [CONTACT_86220].  Study site personnel will report any AE, whether o bserved by [CONTACT_86183].  The reporting period for AEs is described in Section  9.6.  
9.2.1.   Adverse Events  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in the form of signs, symptoms, abnormal 
laboratory findings, or  diseases that emerge or worsen relative to Baseline during administration 
of an Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP), regardless of causal relationship.  
Adverse Events may include the following:  
• Suspected adverse drug reactions:  side effects known, or suspected, to be caused by [CONTACT_86184]  
• Other medical experiences, regardless of their relationship with the IMP, such as injury, 
surgery, accidents, extensions of symptoms or apparently unrelated illnesses, and 
significant abnormalities in clinical laborat ory values, psychological testing, or physical 
examination findings  
• Events occurring as a result of protocol interventions (pre - or post -IMP administration)  
    MTP -131 Ophthalmic Solution (Ocuvia™)  
    Protocol SPI[CONTACT_65791] -101  
  
Version 1.0    Confidential and Proprietary   Page 30 of 48  • Reactions from IMP overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, or toxicity.  
 9.3.  Pre-Treatment Events  
Untoward events and/or incidental diagnoses that occur prior to IMP administration are by 
[CONTACT_108], unrelated to the study drug.  Pre -treatment events  or incidental diagnoses will be 
recorded on the past medical history eCRF.  However, if a pre -treatment event is assessed by [CONTACT_86185] a study procedure and/or meets seriousness criteria, it will be recorded 
as an AE on the AE eCRF an d processed and followed accordingly.  
 9.4.  Baseline Medical Conditions  
Those medical conditions related to the disease under study whose changes during the study are 
consistent with natural disease progression, or which are attributable to a lack of cl inical efficacy 
of the IMP, are NOT considered as AEs and should not be recorded as such in the eCRF.  These 
are handled in the efficacy assessments and should be documented on the medical history page of 
the eCRF.   
Baseline medical conditions, not in the  therapeutic area of interest/investigation, that worsen in 
severity or frequency during the study should be recorded and reported as AEs.  
9.4.1.   Abnormal Laboratory and Other Abnormal Investigational Findings  
Abnormal laboratory findings and other obje ctive measurements should NOT be routinely 
captured and reported as AEs.  However, abnormal laboratory findings or other objective 
measurements that   
• meet the criteria for a SAE,   
• result in discontinuation of the Investigational Medicinal Product,   
• require medical intervention or   
• are judged by [CONTACT_86186].  
When reporting an abnormal laboratory finding on the AE pages of the eCRF, a clinical 
diagnosis  should be recorded rather than the abnormal value itself, if this is available (for 
example, “anemia” rather than “decreased red blood cell count” or “hemoglobin = 10.5 g/dl”).  
9.4.2.   Serious Adverse Events  
A SAE is any AE that:  
• Results in death.  In case of a death, the cause of death is used as the AE term, and the 
fatality is considered as the OUTCOME.  
• Is life -threatening.  The term “life -threatening” refers to a SAE in which the subject is at 
risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically 
might cause death if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
    MTP -131 Ophthalmic Solution (Ocuvia™)  
    Protocol SPI[CONTACT_65791] -101  
Version 1.0    Confidential and Proprietary   Page 31 of 48  • Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Is otherwise medically important: Important medical events may be considered as SAEs 
when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subjec t or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
For the purposes of reporting, any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via an 
IMP is also considered an SAE and all such cases should be r eported in an expedited 
manner as described in Section  9.7.  
9.4.3.   Events that Do Not Meet the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86163] (e.g., an overnight stay 
to facilitate chemoth erapy and related hydration therapy application) are not considered as SAEs.  
However, all events leading to unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (not documented prior to ICF signing) 
or unplanned prolongation of an elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (e.g., undesirable effect s of any 
administered treatment) must be documented and reported as SAEs.  
9.4.4.   Recording of Adverse Events  
Complete, accurate, and consistent data on all AEs experienced for the duration of the reporting 
period will be recorded on an ongoing basis in the appropriate section of the eCRF.  Among 
these AEs, all SAEs must be additionally documented and reported using the study specific SAE 
eCRF as described in Section  9.4.2 .  
It is important that each AE report include a description of the event along with  the duration 
(onset and resolution dates), severity, relationship to IMP, potential causal/confounding factors, 
treatment given or other action taken (including dose modification or discontinuation of the 
IMP), and the outcome.   
As the quality and precis ion of acquired AE data are critical, investigators should use the AE 
definitions provided and should observe the following guidelines when completing the AE pages 
of the eCRF:  
• Whenever possible, recognized medical terms should be used to describe AEs rather than 
lay terms (for example, ‘influenza’ rather than ‘flu’), and abbreviations should be 
avoided.  
• Adverse events should be described using a specific clinical diagnosis, if available, rather 
than a list of signs or symptoms (for example, ‘congestive heart failure’ rather than 
‘dyspnea, rales, and cyanosis’).  However, signs and symptoms that are not associated 
with an identified disease or syndrome, or for which an overall di agnosis is not yet 
available, should be reported as individual AEs.   
• Provisional diagnoses (e.g., “suspected myocardial infarction”) are acceptable, but should 
be followed up with a definitive diagnosis if later available.  Similarly, a fatal event with 
an unknown cause should be recorded as “death of unknown cause.”  
• In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition or illness leading to the 
procedure is considered the AE rather than the procedure itself.

    Protocol SPI[CONTACT_65791] -101  
  
Version 1.0    Confidential and Proprietary   Page 32 of 48  Adverse events occurring secondary to other events (e.g., sequelae or complications) should be 
identified by [CONTACT_86187].  A primary AE, if clearly identifiable, generally represents the 
most accurate clinical term to record in the eCRF.  
 9.5.  Investigator Assessments  
9.5.1.   Severity /Intensity  
Investigators must assess the severity/intensity of AEs according to the following qualitative 
toxicity scale:  
Mild :  The subject is aware of the event or symptom, but the event or symptom is 
easily tolerated.  
Moderate :  The subject experiences sufficient discomfort to interfere with or reduce his 
or her usual level of activity.  
Severe :  Significant impairment of functioning: the subject is unable to carry out usual 
activities.  
9.5.2.   Relationship to the Investigational Medicinal Product   
Investigators must systematically assess the causal relationship of AEs to the IMP using the 
following definitions (the decisive factor being the temporal relationship between the AE and 
administratio n of the IMP):  
Probable :  A causal relationship is clinically/biologically highly plausible, there is a 
plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of the 
IMP, and there is a reasonable response on withdrawal.  
Possible :  A causal relationship is clinically/biologically plausible and there is a 
plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of the 
IMP.  
Unlikely :  A causal relationship is improbable and another documented cause of the 
AE is most plausible.  
Unrelated :  A causal relationship can be excluded and another documented cause of the 
AE is most plausible.  
 9.6.  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The AE repo rting period begins when the subject signs the informed consent and continues 
through the clinical study’s post -treatment follow -up period defined as [ADDRESS_94267] 
administration of study drug (Day 58).   Within a study, all subjects who took at least 1 dose of 
IMP - whether they completed the treatment period or not - should enter the 30 -day safety 
follow -up period as defined above.  
New protocol -related AEs (caused by [CONTACT_86188]) and updates on 
all AEs ongoing or with an unknown outcome must be recorded until the last subject visit 
required by [CONTACT_760].  A last batch of queries will be sent after the  last study visit if remaining 
ongoing/unknown outcomes of reported AEs are pending.  However, SAEs and medically 
    MTP -131 Ophthalmic Solution (Ocuvia™)  
    Protocol SPI[CONTACT_65791] -101  
Version 1.0    Confidential and Proprietary   Page 33 of 48  relevant ongoing/unknown outcome AEs will be followed -up until resolution or stabilization by 
[CONTACT_456]’s Pharmacovigilance department.    
Beyond the defined reporting period, any new unsolicited SAE spontaneously reported to the 
sponsor by [CONTACT_86189].  This and any additional information 
on SAEs obtained after database lock will reside solely in the Pharm acovigilance study file.  
If a subject is documented as lost -to follow -up, ongoing/unknown outcome AEs will not be 
followed -up.  
For subjects who fail screening, AEs and updates must be recorded in the medical history eCRF 
until the date the subject was de termined to have failed screening.  Beyond that date, only SAEs 
and medically relevant AEs will be followed -up by [CONTACT_456]’s Pharmacovigilance group and 
all data will be housed within the Pharmacovigilance study file.  
 9.7.  Serious Adverse Event Exped ited Reporting   
In the event of an SAE occurring during the reporting period, the investigator must immediately 
(i.e., within a maximum of 24 hours after becoming aware of the event) inform the sponsor as 
detailed in the Clinical Study Pharmacovigilance P rocedural Manual.  
For any SAE, the following minimum information is required as initial notification:  
• Investigator/Reporter with full contact [CONTACT_3031]  
• Subject identification details (study number, site number, subject number)  
• Investigational medicin al product administration details (dose and dates)  
• Event verbatim, a brief description of signs/symptoms/or diagnosis and the date of 
onset  
• Seriousness criteria(ion) met  
• Relationship of the event to the IMP (e.g., the causality according to the 
investig ator) Reporting procedures and timelines are the same for any new information 
(follow -up) on a previously reported SAE.  
All SAE reports must be completed as described in the eCRF completion guidelines and 
submitted to the Drug Safety through the Electroni c Data Capture (EDC) system of the clinical 
database.  Other relevant information from the clinical database (including demographic data, 
medical history, concomitant medication, and study drug dosing information) will automatically 
be sent to the sponsor' s safety department via the EDC system when the SAE form is submitted.  
For names, addresses, and telephone and fax numbers for SAE back -up reporting, refer to the 
information included in the Clinical Study Pharmacovigilance Procedural Manual.  
The investi gator/reporter must respond to any request for follow -up information (e.g., additional 
information, outcome and final evaluation, specific records where needed) or to any question the 
sponsor may have on the SAE within the same timelines as described for i nitial reports.  This is 
necessary to permit a prompt assessment of the event by [CONTACT_23638] (as applicable) to allow 
the sponsor to meet strict regulatory timelines associated with expedited safety reporting 
obligations.

Version 1.0    Confidential and Proprietary   Page 34 of 48   9.8.  Pregnancy and In Utero Drug Exposure   
Only pregnancies considered by [CONTACT_86190] (e.g., resulting from 
an interaction between study drug and a contraceptive medication) are considered adverse events 
unto themselves.  How ever, all pregnancies with an estimated conception date during the AE 
reporting period, as defined in Section 9.[ADDRESS_94268] be reported within 45 days from delivery.  
In the case of an abnormal outcome, whereby [CONTACT_86191], the SAE Report Form 
is required and will be submitted as described above.   
9.9.  Responsibilities to Regulatory Authorities, Investigators, Ethics 
Committees, and Ethical/Institutio nal Review Boards  
The sponsor will send appropriate safety notifications to regulatory authorities in accordance 
with applicable laws and regulations.  
The investigator must comply with any applicable site -specific requirements related to the 
reporting of  SAEs involving his/her subjects to the Ethics Committee and/or Ethical/Institutional 
Review Board (EC/ERB/IRB) that approved the study  
In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the sponsor will inform the investigator of findings that 
could adversely affect  the safety of subjects, impact the conduct of the study, or alter the 
EC’s/IRB’s approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_43932].  In particular, and in line with 
respective regulations, the sponsor will inform the investigator of AEs that are both serio us and 
unexpected and are considered to be related to the administered product (suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions or S[LOCATION_003]Rs).  The investigator should place copi[INVESTIGATOR_86164].  National regulations wi th regard to safety report notifications 
to investigators will be taken into account.  
When specifically required by [CONTACT_43973], the sponsor will provide appropriate 
safety reports directly to the IRB and will maintain records of these noti fications.  When direct 
reporting by [CONTACT_86192] -specific regulations, the 
investigator will be responsible for promptly notifying the concerned IEC/IRB of any safety 
reports provided by [CONTACT_86193][INVESTIGATOR_86165].

REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 14.1.  Inform ed Consent  
The principles of ICF are described in ICH Guidelines for GCP.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by [CONTACT_427]) to obtain 
written ICF from each subject prior to his/her participation in the study an d after the aims, 
methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study have been explained to the subject in 
language that he/she can understand.  The ICF will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_86210] d the ICF with the subject.    
Subjects who can write but cannot read will have the ICF read to them before signing and dating 
the ICF.  
Subjects who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have the ICF read to them 
in presence of an imparti al witness, who will sign and date the ICF to confirm that ICF was 
given.  
The original ICF will be retained by [CONTACT_86211]'s study record, and a 
copy of the signed ICF will be given to the subject.  
If new safety information re sults in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, the ICF 
will be reviewed and updated appropriately.  All study subjects will be informed of the new 
information and provide their written consent if they wish to continue in the study.    
 14.2.  Subject Confidentiality and Data Protection  
The investigator will take all appropriate measures to ensure that the anonymity of each study 
subject will be maintained.    
The subject's and investigators’ personal data will be treated in compliance w ith all applicable 
laws and regulations.    
 14.3.  Ethical Review  
An appropriately constituted IRB, as described in ICH Guidelines for GCP, will review and 
approve:    
• The protocol, ICF, and any other materials to be provided to the subjects (e.g., 
adver tising) before any subject may be enrolled in the study   
• Any amendment or modification to the study protocol or ICF before implementation, 
unless the change is necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to the subjects, in which 
case the IRB will be infor med as soon as possible   
In addition, the IRB will be informed of any event likely to affect the safety of subjects or the 
continued conduct of the clinical study.

PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
Amendment 5 (10 Mar 2022) 
This amendment is considered substantial according to 21 CFR part 312.30(b) and any 
applicable local regulations. 
Overall Rationale for the Amendment 
The protocol has been amended to address the recommendation from the FDA to clarify that if 
the initial triplicate ECG results are abnormal (Exclusion Criterion 5; both additional ECG 
triplicates must be normal for a participant to be  enrolled in the study). Clarifications have also 
been added regarding the urine pregnancy test, physical examinati ons, exclusion criteria relating 
to GFR and eGRF, classification of infusion site reactions, and to the Sche dules of Activities.  
In addition, changes made in Administrative Change Letter 4 (dated 17 Nov 2021) have been 
incorporated into this amendment. 
Changes to the protocol in Am endment 5 are detailed below. 
Section Description of Change Brief Rationale and/or Clarification 
Section 1.1 Synopsis, 
Intervention Groups and Duration Revised the Screening duration from 6 to 8 weeks, bringing the total study duration for each participant to 22.5 22.1 weeks. 
To enable sufficient time for all screening 
procedures to be performed. The current 
health crisis sometime leads to delays in 
assays and tests, an extra 2 weeks are necessary to ensure enrollment and timely Screening 
Section 1.1 Synopsis, Overall Design Section 4.1 Overall Design 
Section 6.6 Dose 
Modification Deleted the “4” so that the sentence reads “remaining number of participants” The 4 was removed, because there may be more than 4 remaining participants in a cohort. 
Section 1.1 Synopsis, Number of Participants Added “approximately” to the number of participants per cohort To reflect that approximately [ADDRESS_600782] that urine PEA is optional. Optional collections were added to Screening and End of Treatment Visit (Day [ADDRESS_600783] participant in a cohort, Day 57 for all others). Although PEA is a substrate of TNSALP, it is still an exploratory endpoint, because it is not known if it is correlated with clinical safety or efficacy. Due to logistical challenges at different sites in obtaining results for these samples, this assessment was changed to optional. Two additional collections were added to increase the sampling at sites.

Se
ction Description of Change Brief Rationale and/or Clarification 
Added visits for the abbreviated physical 
examination and added a footnote to clarify that the predose and postdose abbreviated physical examinations are allowed at the predose or dosing day, and on the day after dosing or 2 days after dosing, depending on when the participant is admitted and 
dischar
ged.  To align with the site’s requirement to 
perform a physical examination when participants are admitted and discharged for each of the inpatient periods of the study.  
Added the visit window of ±[ADDRESS_600784] participant’s Day 36 visit and 
subsequent participants’ Da y [ADDRESS_600785] and enrollment. In clinical practice these tests are only 
done once per year. Since there will not be 
any IP exposure for the participant since the initial screening, the tests can still be considered baseline for re-screens. 
Changed “PCP result” to drug screen . 
Removed “3-5 days” from the footnote for drug screening. A negative PCP result drug screen  at 
Screening is required for participant 
enrollment. Table 1 only text:  Drug screens collected at timepoints prior to dosing (Days -1, 14, 21, 28) are not required to confirm a negative drug screen prior to dosing. The PCP drug screen  results are received 3-5 
days after sampling will be noted, and if 
positive, the participant will be discontinued from the study.  Table 2 only text: :  Drug screens collected at timepoints prior to dosing (Days -1, 7, 
14, 21) are not required to confirm a negative drug screen prior to dosing. The PCP drug screen  results are received 3-[ADDRESS_600786] panel includes additional screening for other drugs besides PCP. Also removed the duration for receipt of drug screen results, because the turnaround time for results is variable. 
Updated the numbering of footnotes. Footnotes renumbered to take into account 
addition and deletion of footnotes. 
Section 1.3 Schedule of 
Activities, Table 1 and Table 2 Section 8.2.2 Vital Signs Deleted text relating to assessment of orthostatic hypotension. Criterion relating to orthostatic hypotension was removed in Protocol Amendment 4; therefore, text relating to assessment of orthostatic hypotension should also have been removed. 
Section 1.3 Schedule of Activities, Table 3 Revised footnote “c” to state that at least the last of the [ADDRESS_600787] of the 3 
predose triplicate ECGs will be performed within half an hour prior to dosing, rather than exactly at 30 minutes prior to dosing.

Section 4.[ADDRESS_600788] the N from 4 to 5. 
Section 5.1 Inclusion Criteria Revised inclusion criterion 2b to add “at Screening” so that it reads as follows: Serum ALP level below the laboratory age- and sex-adjusted normal range at 
Screenin
g. To clarify that the value for serum ALP is the value at Screening, rather than historical ALP values. 
Section 5.[ADDRESS_600789] by [CONTACT_468812]. Removal of the reference to vital signs was because the vital signs criterion was removed in Protocol Amendment 4. 
Revised Exclusion Criterion 13 to clarify that this criterion is only required for patients with a histor
y of asfotase alfa use. Revised for clarity and alignment with SoA. 
Revised exclusion criterion 18 to state eGFR instead of GFR and removal of the term “renal insufficiency”. Based on the following FDA guidance, this study will utilize the eGFR for evaluation of renal function: “There are different ways to assess renal function. Measurement of the GFR provides a more accurate assessment of renal function than estimating equations. However, these methods are not routinely used in clinical practice and estimation of renal function 
using a widely accepted serum creatinine-
based equation is usually sufficient for PK 
studies.” 
Deleted exclusion criterion 19. Removed as exclusion criterion [ADDRESS_600790] both 
GFR and eGFR tests because they measure the same parameter. eGFR is an estimate 
of the GFR and requires only a blood 
sample to perform. 
Deleted “or > 1.5 × ULN of the reference range of the testing laboratory on Day -1” from Exclusion Criterion 21 (formerly Exclusion Criterion 22):  
x Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
> ULN of the reference range of thetesting laboratory at Screening or
> 1.5 × ULN of the reference range
of the testing laboratory on Day -1 ”The value required to pass Screening is more stringent, so the Day -1 assessment is not needed. 
Section 5.4 Screen Fails Removed the restriction of one-time 
rescreening. Removed restriction on one-time rescreening to allow participants to be enrolled if the eligibility criteria are met as described in this amendment of the protocol.

Section 7.2 Participant 
Discontinuation/ Withdrawal from the Study Removal of “or completes it out of window” from the following: 
x If a participant misses a dosing visit or 
completes it out-of-window , they do 
not need to be withdrawn or discontinued from treatment or the study; however, they will not be 
considered “completed” even if they 
continue on to complete the end-of-treatment assessments. These participants should be replaced unless at least [ADDRESS_600791] already “completed” or are on track to “complete. Removed because participants cannot make up a missed dose. Therefore, dosing visits should not be conducted out of window. 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Safety Review of 12-lead Electrocardio
grams Removed of reference to Holter Holter was removed in Protocol 
Amendment 4.  
Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
Injection/Infusion Site Reactions  Removed Infusion site reactions from section. Added/deleted text as follows:  Deleted text in strikethrough, new text in 
bold. Antibodies have been associated with 
injection/infusion reactions, with onset 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_468780]/infusion. For this reason, 
participants will be carefully observed 
during each injection/infusion. 
Injection/infusion site reactions are defined 
as AEs localized to the site of IV or SC 
route of study drug administration, 
occurring at any time during study 
participation that are assessed by [CONTACT_7181]. 
Injection site reactions (ISRs) are defined as AEs localized to the site of 
study drug administration that occur at 
any time during study participation that are assessed by [CONTACT_6970], probably, or definitely related to study drug. AE intensity reporting procedures are outlined in Section 10.3.4.  Injection site reactions may occur at any timepoint after study drug administration. There is no additional laboratory testing required for ISRs.  
The Investigator is responsible for 
monitoring for ISRs in patients 
throughout the duration of the study. As part of the study-required physical examinations, Investigators should evaluate injection sites for signs of 
reaction(s). To clarify descriptions of and symptoms 
associated with the severity of injection site reactions and to provide cross reference to section of protocol describing reporting of AEs and SAEs.

1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY
1.1. Synopsis
Protocol Title: A Phase 1, Open-label, Dose-escalating Study to Evaluate the Safety, 
Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharm acodynamics of ALXN1850 in Adults with 
Hypophosphatasia 
Short Title: Safety and Tolerability, Pharmacoki netic, and Pharm acodynamic Study of 
ALXN1850 in Participants with Hypophosphatasia (HPP) 
Rationale: 
Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare, inherited, metabolic disease caused by [CONTACT_468813]-specific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP), typi[INVESTIGATOR_468781]-of-function mutation(s) in the ALPL  gene. As a direct result of deficient TNSALP, 
progressive damage to vital organs along with other clinic al sequelae may occur, including 
deformity and softness of bones (rickets-like bone  deformities and osteomalacia), fractures and 
pseudofractures, pain, profound muscle weakness, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (primarily in infants), 
seizures (mainly in infants), impaired renal function, impaired mobility, and dental abnormalities. Asfotase alfa (STRENSIQ
®) is currently the only approved treatment for patients 
with pediatric-onset HPP. ALXN1850 is an inve stigational enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) 
that addresses the underlying cause of HPP by [CONTACT_468814], thus reversing the 
mineralization defects of the skeleton and imp roving systemic manifestations of HPP. 
ALXN1850 is a human recombinant TNSALP-fragment crystallizable (Fc)-deca-aspartate fusion protein. It is a soluble glycoprotein comprised of 2 polypeptide chains of 724 amino acids made 
from the catalytic domain of human TNSALP (SwissProt, P05186), the human immunoglobulin 
(Ig) G2/4 Fc domain (SwissProt P01859 and Ge nebank K01316; to facilitate purification and 
extend half-life), and a deca-aspartate peptide (to target the bone). 
The purpose of this first-in-human (FIH), open-label, dose-escalating study is to assess the safety 
and tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) a nd pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters and 
immunogenicity of ALXN1850 when given intravenous ly (IV) and subcutaneously (SC) to adult 
participants with HPP. This FIH study is de signed to support an efficient and tolerable 
pharmacologically effective dose in particip ants with HPP for whom ALXN1850 has been 
designed to deliver the required enzyme with less fr equent SC administration than asfotase alfa, 
and therefore reduce the burden of treatment for this group of patients.

Overall Design 
This is an open-label, dose-escalating study to assess safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and 
immunogenicity of ALXN1850 when given IV and SC to adults with HPP.  
Study participants will be enrolled into [ADDRESS_600796] of  the cohort. A Safety Review Committee (SRC) 
will convene after the first participant in each c ohort has completed the first IV dose to assess 
safety and tolerability, and to endorse initiation of SC study drug administration to the first 
participant as well as IV and SC study drug admini stration to the remaining participants in the 
cohort. Once at least [ADDRESS_600797] received a single IV dose and 3 weekly (qw) 
SC doses, the SRC will convene again to review sa fety and tolerability data, and to determine if 
the dose escalation may proceed. If the SRC endorses dose escalation, Cohort [ADDRESS_600798] assessment of the study will be given options 
to enable further monitoring of their ADA values after the end of the study; these options may 
include enrollment in the Global HPP Registry.  
Disclosure Statement : This is a sequential dose-escalating tr eatment study with 3 cohorts that is 
open-label. Number of Participants: Approximately 15 eligible participants (approximately 5 in each 
Cohorts 1, 2, and 3), will be enrolled to allow for at least 9 participants (3 per cohort) to 
“complete” (ie, participant completed EoT assessments, all PK/PD sampling was performed 
within window, and all doses were received pe r the SoA). Participants who withdraw/are

withdrawn from the study after “completion” but before the EoT Visit do not need to be replaced 
unless at least [ADDRESS_600799] “completed” or are on track to “complete”.  
Intervention Groups and Duration:  The planned study duration for each participant is up to 
22.5 weeks (approximately 5 months) in total: up to [ADDRESS_600800]-dosing Follow-up Period to further monitor safety/tolerability, PK/P D, and immunogenicity. 
Dosing will be staggered within and between cohorts. The end of  study is anticipated to be 
Day 85 (-7/+14 days) for the first participant in each cohort and Day 78 (-7/+14 days) for 
subsequent participants in each cohort.  
Safety Review Committee: A SRC will assess all available data and will provide 
recommendations for cohort clearance and dose escalation decisions.

2. INTRODUCTION
2.1. Study Rationale
ALXN1850 is a human recombinant TNSALP-Fc-d eca-aspartate fusion protein being developed 
as an investigational ERT to address the unde rlying cause of HPP by [CONTACT_468817]. It is a soluble glycoprotein comprised of 2 polypeptide chains of 724 amino 
acids made from the catalytic domain of huma n TNSALP (SwissProt, P05186), the human Ig 
G2/4 Fc domain (SwissProt P01859 and Genebank K01316; to facilitate pu rification and extend 
half-life), and a deca-aspartate peptide (to target the bone). ALXN1850 is designed for SC administration. Nonclinical pharmacology, PK, and toxicology studies of ALXN1850 have been 
conducted to support the clinical testing of ALXN1850 in humans. The Phase [ADDRESS_600819] a confirmed mutation for the 
gene ( ALPL ) that encodes the enzyme TNSALP, resulting in the presence of decreased serum 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and el evated serum pyridoxine and inorganic 
pyrophosphate, which are the genetic and bioc hemical hallmarks of the disease. The 
characteristics of this population represent patients with HPP who currently do not require ERT 
but could qualify for future Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, depending on the disease burden. This study has been designed to minimize risk to participants; it is a study with strict 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and there is a robust safety monitoring and risk mitigation plan in 
place to address potential safety and tolerab ility findings. Because of the potential for 
immunogenicity, this study will enroll participants with HPP who are not anticipated to require 
continued treatment with ERT, ba sed on their signs and symptoms, and the Investigator’s clinical 
assessment of their current condition.  
ALXN1850 and asfotase alfa, the only approved treat ment for HPP, have the same mechanism of 
action and address the underlying cause of HP P by [CONTACT_468818], thus 
reversing the mineralization defects of the skeleton and improving systemic manifestations of 
HPP. ALXN1850 differs from asfotase alfa in the following ways: it is altered by [CONTACT_468819] e site; its Fc domain is an IgG2/4, to improve 
half-life and bioavailability; [ADDRESS_600820] been removed from each TNSALP 
polypeptide chain via asparagine to glutamine mu tations, and other enhancements to its glycan 
profile which should alter the PK of the active moiety and increase its exposure and half-life. 
Currently, the recommended dosage regimen of asfota se alfa for the treatment of pediatric-onset 
HPP is 6 mg/kg per week administered SC as either 2 mg/kg 3 times per week, or 1 mg/kg 
6 times per week. However, patients using asfotase alfa are burdened with a high rate of injection 
site reactions and an inconveni ent administration frequency (3 to 6 times per week). ALXN1850 
is a next-generation HPP therapy developed with th e intent to deliver a molecule with equivalent 
potency and improved activity compared to asfo tase alfa, providing higher exposure, longer 
half-life, and better bioavailability. These improvements may address current asfotase alfa limitations and support lower doses and longer dosing in tervals. Patient experience is expected to 
improve by [CONTACT_468820], which may also translate to fewer 
injection site reactions and higher patient compliance.

2.2. Background 
A detailed description of the chemistry, pha rmacology, and toxicology data available for 
ALXN1850 is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
2.2.1.  Hypophosphatasia 
Hypophosphatasia is a rare, inher ited, metabolic disease caused by [CONTACT_468821], typi[INVESTIGATOR_468783]-of-function mutation(s) in the ALPL  gene. TNSALP is a 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored ectoenzym e, which although widely expressed, is 
expressed at particularly high concentrations  on the surface of osteoblasts. During normal bone 
mineralization, TNSALP dephosphorylates inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), producing inorganic 
phosphate (Pi). Inorganic phosphate then precipi[INVESTIGATOR_468784] (Ca2+) in the extracellular matrix 
to form calcium phosphate that is then transf ormed into hydroxyapatite  crystals, which give 
bones their strength and rigidity. Other known endogenous substrates for ALP include 
pyridoxal-5´-phosphate (PLP) a nd phosphoethanolamine (PEA) ( Whyte, 2012 ; Whyte, 1994 ). 
In HPP, low TNSALP activity leads to extrace llular accumulation of PPi, which inhibits bone 
mineralization by [CONTACT_468822] ( Russell, 1965 ; Fleisch, 1966; 
Rockman-Greenberg, 2013 ). Consequently, Ca2+ and PPi [INVESTIGATOR_468785], causing 
disturbances in calcium/phosphate homeostasis ( Linglart, 2016 ). In addition, TNSALP 
dephosphorylates PLP, the circulating form of vitamin B 6, producing pyridoxal (PL), which 
crosses the blood-brain barrier and is rephosphorylated into PLP, where it plays an important 
role in the synthesis of multiple neurotransmitters ( Whyte, 1994 ; Whyte, 2012 ). The role of PEA 
is not completely understood but may be a com ponent of the phosphatidylinositol-glycan linkage 
apparatus that couples TNSALP and ma ny other proteins to cell surfaces. 
As a direct result of deficient TNSALP, progre ssive damage to vital organs along with other 
clinical sequelae may occur; including defor mity and softness of bones (rickets-like bone 
deformities and osteomalacia), fractures and ps eudofractures, pain, profound muscle weakness, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (primarily in infants), seizur es (mainly in infants), impaired renal function, 
impaired mobility, and dental abnormalities. Hypo phosphatasia is associated with a high-fracture 
and orthopedic/dental surgical bu rden, pain, need for assistive wa lking devices (due to impaired 
mobility), and impairments in activities of daily living in children and adults. Severe disease 
associated with rachitic changes in the chest often lead to diminished resp iratory functi on (due to 
lack of rib cage support) and risk of ventila tor dependence and premature death (mainly in 
infants). The deficiency of PLP in the central nervous system in patients with HPP can result in 
infantile seizures which are responsive to pyridoxine ( Baumgartner-Sigl, 2007 ; Whyte, 1985 ). 
2.2.2.  ALXN1850 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Chemistry 
ALXN1850 is a human recombinant tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphate 
(TNSALP)-Fc-aspartate fusion protein. It is ex pressed by a vector in Chinese Hamster Ovary 
(CHO) cells using cell culture technology in bioreactors and is formulated to a concentration of 100 mg/mL. ALXN1850 has a deglycosylated mol ecular weight of 160 KDa confirmed by 
[CONTACT_468823]. The purifi ed soluble Fc fusion protein is modified by 
[CONTACT_468824]; its Fc domain is an

IgG2/4, to improve half-life and bioavailability; [ADDRESS_600821] been removed from 
each TNSALP polypeptide chain via asparagine to glutamine mutations, and other enhancements 
to its glycan profile which were designed to impro ve the PK of the active moiety and increase its 
exposure and half-life. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pharmacology 
Preclinical efficacy studies with ALXN1850 were conducted in a murine knockout model 
(designated Akp2GW-/-) of human HPP created by [CONTACT_468825]é Millán  
(Narisawa, 1997) to generate the Akp2-/- mouse model which supported the I nvestigational New 
Drug (IND) filing for asfotase alfa. The Akp2GW- /- model was similarly maintained on a mixed 
background of C57BL6 and 129J strains. As occurs in human infantile HPP and Akp2-/-mice, Akp2GW-/- mice demonstrate a range of minera lization and bone defic its with shortened 
survival. Compared to wild-type littermates, Akp2GW-/- mice display excess unmineralized 
matrix early in life, experience seizures likely due to defective vitamin B6 metabolism, and die 
before postnatal day 26 despi[INVESTIGATOR_468786] y pyridoxine (B6 vitamer) supplementation 
(Study RTR-0032). 
The efficacy of ALXN1850 in Akp2GW-/- mice was evaluated in prophylactic SC injection 
treatments initiated 1 day after birth. The efficacy endpoints evaluated in preclinical studies with 
Akp2GW-/- mice were bone mineralization defect s, growth (body weight and bone lengths of 
femur and tibia), and survival. Additional outcome  measures included plasma and femur alkaline 
phosphate enzymatic activity. 
ALXN1850 increased bone mineralization and had a beneficial effect on bone length, body 
weight gain, and survival time. ALXN1850 improved upon the potency of asfotase alfa, with 
higher enzymatic activity on bone, higher frequency of normalized bone mineralization, and increased bone length, at lower doses and at less- frequent dosing intervals than asfotase alfa. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Toxicology 
Nonclinical safety/toxicology studies conduc ted to date to support ALXN1850 FIH study 
consisted of definitive/Good Laboratory Practices  (GLP) nonclinical safety studies in rats 
(Study 1727-227) and monkeys (Study 1727-228). Th e GLP toxicology studies evaluated the 
systemic toxicity of the administration of SC ALXN1850 in rat and monkeys; these studies 
included safety pharmacology endpoints (cardi ovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_468787]), toxicokinetic evaluations, imm unogenicity evaluations, and a 
recovery period to assess the reversibility of any treatment-related effects. ALXN1850 did not 
result in any systemic organ toxi city in rats or monkeys. AL XN1850 was well tolerated locally 
following SC administration to rats and monkeys, with no adverse findings observed at injection 
sites. The no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) in rat and monkey studies were the 
highest doses evaluated in rats (30 mg/kg/dose) and monkeys (20 mg/kg/dose). In conclusion, SC administered ALXN1850 to rats and monkeys  did not identify any new or unexpected 
systemic toxicity or local tolera bility findings in rats or monkeys. 
In rat 28-day toxicity study, administration of ALXN1850 via SC injection once every 3 days (q3d) for 28 days (Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22,  25, and 28) for a total of 10 doses to male and 
female CD
® rats was well tolerated up to 30 mg/kg/dose, the highest SC dose evaluated in this

study. Additionally, administration of ALXN1850 at 10 mg/kg IV was also well tolerated after a 
single injection. There were no ALXN1850-related changes in clinical observations, body 
weights, body weight gains, quantitative f ood consumption, ophthalmology, functional 
observational battery observations, hematology, urinalysis, gross pathology, and organ weights. 
At the end of the dosing phase, there were dose-related increases in ALP activity (anticipated pharmacology effect) at ≥  2 mg/kg/dose ALXN1850 SC which were fully resolved following a 
28-day recovery period. Non-a dverse microscopic changes were related to the injection
procedures with associated reactive change s in the draining lymph nodes. There was no
discernible ALXN1850-associated alteration in the incidence, severity, or microscopic character
of the changes at the injection sites or drai ning lymph nodes. Microscopic changes in the
injection sites and draining lymph nodes of recovery animals were similar to those noted in theterminal necropsy animals, although less pronounced in the recovery group animals. In
conclusion, the dose level of 30 mg/kg/dose is considered to be the NOAEL for SCadministration that corresponds to Day 24 ma les and females combined maximum observed
serum concentration (C
max) value of 43.9 μg/mL and area under the concentration-time curve
from time zero to 72 hours (AUC 0-72h) value of 2120 h*μ g/mL.
Single IV bolus injection of ALXN1850 at 10 mg/kg was well tolerated in rats with no 
noteworthy toxicity or injection site  reactions and resulted in an AUC 0-72h of 3690 h*μg/mL. The 
SC bioavailability for ALXN1850 (based on SC AUC 0-72h values at 10 mg/kg/dose) in rats was 
approximately 44.2%. 
In a monkey 28-day toxicity study, administra tion of ALXN1850 via SC injection once q3d for 
28 days (Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, a nd 28) for a total of 10 doses to male and female 
cynomolgus monkeys was well tolera ted up to 20 mg/kg/dose, the highest dose evaluated in this 
study. There were no ALXN1850-related changes in injection site reactions (dermal scoring), 
body weights, body weight gains, qualitative food consumption, ophthalmology, manual 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_109651], indirect blood pressures,  qualitative electrocardiography, hematology, 
urinalysis, gross pathology, and organ weights.  At the end of the dosing phase, there were 
dose-related increases in ALP activity (anticip ated pharmacology effect) which were fully 
(1 mg/kg/dose) or mostly (≥5  mg/kg/dose) resolved following a 28-day recovery period. 
Non-adverse ALXN1850 related micro scopic changes were confined to the injection sites and 
included minimal to mild degeneration/necrosis, mineralization, and mixed cell inflammation/infiltration. Partial recovery of degeneration/necrosis and mixed cell 
inflammation/infiltration of the injection site(s) were observed within the recovery groups, while 
minimal to mild mineralization persisted in recovery males at ≥  1 mg/kg/dose and females at 
20 mg/kg/dose. Heart rate increases were observed in all animals at 1 mg/kg/dose and in some of 
the animals at ≥  5 mg/kg/dose. Heart rate and electrocardiogram (ECG) values remained within a 
normal range of biological variation for monkeys of this age, and therefore these heart rate 
increases were not considered to be adverse, gi ven the incongruity with systemic exposure data. 
In conclusion the dose level of 20 mg/kg/dose is considered to be the NOAEL that corresponds 
to Day 24 males and females combined mean C
max value of 254 μg/mL and mean AUC 0-72h value 
of [ZIP_CODE] h* μg/mL, respectively. 
In conclusion, SC administration of ALXN1850 to rats or monkeys did not identify any new or 
unexpected systemic toxicity or local tolerability findings. The NOAEL dose of 20 mg/kg/dose from the ALXN1850 GLP monkey toxicity study was used to select the Phase 1 study starting 
dose. The observed exposure of the NOAEL at 20 mg/kg/dose from the GLP SC monkey toxicity

study is approximately 113× (for IV) and 83× (for SC) of the projected AUC exposure of the 
proposed human starting single dose of 15 mg IV or 15 mg qw × 3 SC ( Section 4.3). Given the 
exposure margins and the lack of systemic toxicity  or local tolerability findings in 28-day rat and 
monkey toxicology studies with ALXN1850, the safety risk for humans on the 15 mg starting 
dose is considered to be very low. 
As per the current FIH study design the fourth dose will be administered by [CONTACT_2006] 28 (1 IV dose 
followed by 3 SC doses; Section 1.2). The 28-day toxicology studies in rats and monkeys with 
10 SC doses administered with q3d dosing frequency are sufficient to support the FIH duration 
of dosing (ICH M3 [R2] and ICH S6 [R1] guidance). 
2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment 
Identified potential risks are described below. More detailed information about the known and 
expected benefits and risks and reasonably exp ected adverse events (AEs) of ALXN1850 may be 
found in the IB. 
2.3.1.  Risk Assessment 
Potential risks of study participation include: 
x Injection/infusion site reactions (ISRs) 
x Injection/infusion associated reactions (including hypersensitivity) 
x Formation of anti-ALXN1850 antibodies 
x Ectopic calcifications 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Coronavirus Disease 2019 
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is active in many countries at the time of 
the original protocol and this protocol amendment. Given this unique circumstance, specific consideration has been given to the risks and bene fits of the study as they relate to COVID-19, 
and the global and local changes that exist as a result of the pandemic. This assessment is 
described in Section 10.7. 
2.3.2.  Benefit Assessment 
No direct medical benefit is anticipated in par ticipants in any of the cohorts during this short 
course of treatment with ALXN1850. HPP is a ch ronic systemic disease that requires long term 
ERT in patients for whom it is indicated. The deci sion to continue ERT for HPP after the patient 
has ended the study will be made by [CONTACT_468826], if requested, treatment 
with asfotase alfa will be made available.
 
2.3.3.  Overall Benefit Risk Conclusion 
This is the first time that ALXN1850 will be administered to humans. Because of the potential 
for immunogenicity, this study will enroll adults  with HPP who are not anticipated to require 
continued treatment with ERT, ba sed on their signs and symptoms, and the Investigator’s clinical 
assessment of their current condition.

Page [ADDRESS_600822] of the study design is discussed below: 
x This study will be conducted in adult participants w ith HPP because ALXN1850 is 
designed as a TNSALP ERT that is expected to lead to improvement in this patient 
population. Because of the potential for im munogenicity, this study will enroll adults 
with HPP who are not anticipated to require  continued treatment with ERT, based on 
their signs and symptoms, and the Investigator’s clinical assessment of their current 
condition. 
x A single ALXN1850 IV dose will provide the reference necessary for assessing absolute bioavailability. 
x Weekly SC dose will provide the PK and PD information that will support the intended dose regimen in this patient population. 
x Three weekly doses of SC ALXN1850 will provide accumulation information for this 
study drug. 
x The qw SC dose range proposed for this study (15 to 90 mg) is expected to cover the 
therapeutic range in humans. 
x An 8-week follow-up will provide enough time to assess immunogenicity and possible risks to the participants. 
Page [ADDRESS_600823]-in--human dose selection was based on PK da ta collected from a wild-type mouse study; rat 
and monkey dose range finding studies; 4-week GL P toxicology studies in rats and monkeys; 
and efficacy data from 2 Akp2GW -/- mouse e fficacy studies. A model-based approach 
employing dose response and population PK (PopPK) models was used to characterize the SC 
dose (15 mg [0.15 mL], 45 mg [0.45 mL], and 90 mg [0.90 mL]) after performing body 
weight-based forecasting to humans for the FIH study. A NOAEL based approach was used to 
determine the starting dose (15 mg IV). A summary of the expected exposure margin and- expected percentage of population with normalized mineralization response in humans for 
ALXN1850 is provided in Table 5 . Given previous experience with asfotase alfa, it is expected 
that the ALXN1850 safety multiple will support flat dosing. The trade-off of flat dosing versus mg/kg dosing is some increase in PK variability (within a cohort) with a gain of reduction in 
potential errors in dosing and operational factors. 
The 15 mg IV starting dose is considered the maximum recommended starting dose (MRSD). 
The starting dose was selected based on NOAEL from the 4-week GLP toxicology study in 
monkeys dosed SC q3d. Monkey was selected becau se it has relevant biology with humans. The 
monkey NOAEL was determined to be 20 mg/kg/q3d or 46 mg/kg/week. Assumptions of 1) no allometric scaling for a mo lecule with molecule weight > 100 kDa (Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) guidance: Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Health Volunteer s, 2005), 2) applying safety factor of 150, and 
3) SC bioavailability (75%), 4) adult body weight of 70 kg, were factored into the calculation of
the starting dose. Based on dose simulation results, the observed exposure of the NOAEL at20 mg/kg/dose from the GLP monkey toxicity study is approximately 113-fold of projected
exposure from the 15 mg IV starting dose ( Table 5 ).
Cohort 1 will receive 15 mg as a single IV dose, followed by 15 mg SC at 1-week intervals for 
3 doses. The 15 mg SC dose was calculated (based on dose-response modeling of mouse data) to 
produce normalized bone mineralization in 66% of a treated population.  
Cohort 2 will receive 45 mg as a single IV dose, followed by 45 mg SC at 1-week interval for 
3 doses. A 45 mg SC dose is expected to achieve normal bone mineralization in 85% of a treated 
population and is selected as the target effec tive dose. Based on the asfotase alfa clinical 
definition for this efficacy endpoint, the dose pr oducing normal bone mineralization in 85% of 
the treated population (ED85) is considered as  the target effective dose. Mouse ED85 was 
calculated using a dose response model developed using ALXN1850 preclinical efficacy studies 
in Akp2GW (-/-) mouse model of HPP and allome trically scaled to a weekly flat dose of 
45 mg/week in humans. 
Cohort 3 will receive 90 mg as a single IV dose, followed by 90 mg SC at 1-week intervals for 
3 doses. A 90 mg SC dose is projected to achieve normalized bone mineralization in 91% of a treated population and is expected to c over the therapeutic range in humans. 
In the monkey 28-day toxicology study, a total of 10 doses were administered SC at a dose interval of once every 3 days (q3d). The proposed Phase 1 dosing schedule includes 
administering a total of 4 doses (1 IV and 3 SC doses) once-a-week (qw) (see Section 4.1 for 
more details), resulting in a total dosing duration of 3 weeks ([ADDRESS_600824] participant of the 
cohort) for ALXN1850 administration. Although , the total duration of ALXN1850 proposed 
Page [ADDRESS_600825] the same duration as the monkey toxicology study, 
more doses were administered in the monkey toxicology study at a more frequent dosing interval 
(10 doses at q3d) than the proposed dosing regimen in this Phase 1 study (4 qw doses). 
Therefore, the existing nonclinical toxicology data (rat and monkey) support the proposed 
Phase 1 dosing regimen in a clinical setting.

6.5.1.  Allowed Medicine and Therapy 
The use of hormonal contraceptives will be allowed and recorded in the eCRFs. 
Prescription medications will be  permitted during the study at the Investigator’s discretion and 
recorded in the eCRFs. 
The occasional use of nonprescription medications , over-the-counter, herbal preparations, and 
multivitamins, antipyretics, or analgesics (eg,  acetaminophen) may be allowed during the study, 
at the discretion of the Investigator and documented. 
6.5.2.  Disallowed Medicine and Therapy 
Use of vitamin B6 (including vitamin supplements that contain vitamin B6) must be 
discontinued at least [ADDRESS_600832] dose of study drug. Use of teriparatide/ PTH 
analog must be discontinued at l east 2 months before Screening. 
Use of asfotase alfa within 6 months of Screening and throughout the study is prohibited. 
A concomitant procedure is any therapeutic inte rvention (eg, surgery/biopsy, physical therapy) 
or non-study diagnostic assessment (eg, blood ga s measurement, bacterial cultures) performed 
from the time the participant is screened for th e study until the last study visit. Concomitant 
procedures are not allowed unless medically indicated. 
6.6. Dose Modification 
Decisions to continue, modify (explore the dose cohort further), or escalate dosing will be made 
by [CONTACT_12217]. 
The SRC will meet to review safety data after the first participant in each cohort completes IV 
dosing to assess for safety and to support multiple dosing for the first participant as well as study 
drug administration for the remaining participants  in each cohort. Initiation of Cohort 2 can only 
occur after review of accumulated safety data from Cohort 1. Initiation of Cohort 3 can only 
occur after review of accumulated safety and PK data from Cohorts 1 and 2. If dosing is stopped 
because a safety event occurs or a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_196140], dosing may not resume until there is 
documented agreement between the Investig ator and Alexion’s Medical Monitor. 
After review of the safety data, the SRC may agree to any of the following options: 
x Continue dose escalation as described in the protocol 
x Administer the same dose to an additional cohort 
x Administer a higher intermediate dose between  the current dose and the next protocol 
specified dose level 
x Administer a lower intermediate dose between the current dose and the previously administered dose 
x Discontinue further dosing in the study 
Page [ADDRESS_600833] received a single IV dose and 3 weekly (qw) SC doses, the 
SRC will convene again to review safety and to lerability data, and to determine if the dose 
escalation may proceed. The SRC will review av ailable data including treatment emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs), safety laboratory results, 12-lead ECG findings, and vital sign 
measurements. 
For dose escalation between Cohort 1 and Cohor t 2, PK data will not be provided. 
The decision to begin Cohort 3 will be determined by [CONTACT_12217], who, at minimum, will review 
the following data (see SRC charter for full description of data required for each safety review): 
x All available accumulated safe ty data from all participants in Cohorts [ADDRESS_600834] participants in Cohort 1 
x Up to Day 22 ([ADDRESS_600835] SC dose) PK data from the first participant in Cohort 2 
x Up to Day 8 ([ADDRESS_600836] IV dose) PK data from the 2nd and 3rd participants in 
Cohort 2 
Predicted ALXN1850 human PK exposure ( Table 5 ) indicates Cohort 3 PK exposure will not 
exceed 50% of the NOAEL exposure (AUC 0-168h  = [ZIP_CODE] h*μ g/mL and C max = 254 μg/mL) 
established in the GLP 4week monkey toxicology study. In the event that PK exposure in Cohort 3 is predicted to exceed 50% of the NOAEL exposure, a lower dose may be selected so 
that the above criteria can be met. 
Dose escalation requires agreement between Alexion and Investigator; Alexion may not overrule 
the Investigator if there are concerns that dosing should be stopped. 
In the event of an acute safety event, dosing s hould be stopped until assess ment of causality has 
taken place and an appropriate risk mitigation strategy is put into place before dosing the 
remainder of the cohort. 
6.7. Intervention After the End of the Study 
Upon completion of the last study visit, participants will return to the care of their treating 
physician. 
Participants who are positive for ADAs at the last assessment of the study will be given options 
to enable further monitoring of their ADA values after the end of the study; these options may 
include enrollment in the Global HPP Registry.

PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_468791] e discontinuation of treatment cohorts and 
discontinuation of individual participants. The fo llowing rule sets apply to TEAEs that are 
assessed by [CONTACT_66325] (unless specified otherwise). While 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_468792], the Investigator and/or Alexion 
may elect to discontinue dosing at any time. Dose  continuation or escalation will proceed as 
scheduled and the study will continue as planned provided no prespecified toxicity events occur 
(as determined by [CONTACT_12217]). 
The entire study will be suspended if any severe  or life-threatening treatment-emergent serious 
adverse events (TESAEs) occur. Participants who do not complete the study but ha ve been dosed should make every effort to 
undergo all scheduled safety, PK, and PD evaluations required by [CONTACT_760] (refer to SoA, 
Section 1.3) in relation to the last dose they received. Alexion and site monitor will be notified as 
soon as possible. If a participant withdraws consent and is unwilling to attend all scheduled procedures, every 
attempt will be made to encourage them to complete the ED visit at a minimum. 
7.1. Discontinuation of Study Intervention 
7.1.1.  Cohort Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_468793]: 
x Two or more participants experience CTCAE Grade 2 TEAE (excluding ISR and 
injection/infusion associated reactions) with the same PT or medical concept that are considered to be related to study drug and do not show signs of reversibility by [CONTACT_468832]. 
x One participant experiences a CTCAE Grade 3 (or higher) TEAE considered to be 
related to study drug. 
x Severe (Grade 3) injection site reaction in more than 50% of a cohort, assessed by [CONTACT_178202] 
x The PK stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_468794] 50% of the NOAEL exposure (mean C

drug and is considered to be a safety concern by [CONTACT_737]. 
x Severe (Grade 3) ISR assessed by [CONTACT_468833]. 
See the SoA ( Section 1.3) for data to be collected at the time of intervention discontinuation and 
follow-up and for any further evaluati ons that need to be completed. 
Dosing may continue if appropriate risk mitigation steps are enacted to allow for safe 
continuation of the study. Assessment of adve rse event intensity should be performed by [CONTACT_468834] j udgment as described in the clinical protocol. 
7.2. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study 
x All efforts should be made to ensure participants are willing to comply with study participation prior to c onducting the screening procedures. The study staff should 
notify Alexion and their site monitor of all study withdrawals as soon as possible. The reason for participant discontinuation must be  recorded in the source documents and 
eCRF. 
x A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request or may 
be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator for safety, behavioral, 
compliance, or administrative reasons.  
x At any visit, a positive drug test result for a non-prescribed substance will lead to participant discontinuation.
x A positive pregnancy test result at any time  
 during the study will lead to participant 
discontinuation.
x Participants diagnosed with COVID-19 with clinic al manifestations of the disease 
will be evaluated for potential treatment and/or study discontinuation according to the CRU’s COVID-19 protocol. 
x At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an Early Discontinuation visit should be conducted, as shown in the SoA. See SoA ( Section 1.3) for data to be 
collected at the time of discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. 
x If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, Alexion may retain and continue to use a ny data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
x If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any 
samples taken and not tested, and the Investigator must document this in the site study records. 
x Participants who withdraw/are withdraw n from the study following completion of 
EoT assessments but prior to completion of EoS assessments will be considered 
“completed” if all PK/PD sampling was perf ormed within window and all doses were 
administered per the SoA. “Completed” participants do not need to be replaced.

x Participants who withdraw/a re withdrawn from the study prior to completion of the 
end-of-treatment assessments should be replace d unless at least [ADDRESS_600837] already “completed” or are on track to “complete”. 
x If a participant misses a dosing visit, they do not need to be withdrawn or 
discontinued from treatment or the study; however, they will not be considered “completed” even if they continue on to complete the end-of-treatment assessments. 
These participants should be replaced unless at least [ADDRESS_600838] already “completed” or are on track to “complete. 
7.3. Lost to Follow-up 
A participant will be considered lost to follow- up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to  be contact[CONTACT_9298]. 
The following actions must be taken if a particip ant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit: 
x The site must attempt to c ontact the participant to reschedule the missed visit as soon 
as possible, counsel the participant on th e importance of maintaining the assigned 
visit schedule, and ascertain whether or not  the participant wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study. 
x Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the Investigator or designee must 
make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified lette r to the participant’s last known mailing 
address or local equivalent methods). Th ese contact [CONTACT_14316]’s medical record. 
x Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered lost to 
follow-up. 
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole are handled as part of Section 10.1.8 .

8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
x Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA ( Section 1.3). Protocol 
waivers or exemptions are not allowed. 
x Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with Alexion immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if  the participant should continue or 
discontinue study intervention. 
x Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA 
(Section 1.3), is essential and required for study conduct. 
x All screening evaluations must be complete d and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. Th e Investigator will maintain a screening log 
to record details of all participants scre ened and to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable. 
x Procedures conducted as part of the partic ipant’s routine clinical management (eg, 
blood count) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening or 
baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol--specified criteria and 
were performed within the time frame defined in the SoA (Section 1.3). 
x See Section 10.[ADDRESS_600839] of clinical laboratory tests. 
8.1. Efficacy Assessments 
No efficacy assessments will be performed during this study. 
8.2. Safety Assessments 
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA (Section 1.3). 
8.2.1.  Physical Examinations 
x A full physical examination will be pe rformed at Screening and will include 
assessments of the general appearance; skin; head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat; neck; lymph nodes; chest; heart; abdominal cavity ; limbs; central nervous system; and 
musculoskeletal system. 
x At all other timepoints indicated in Section 1.3, an abbreviated physical examination 
will be performed that will target cer tain assessments listed above at the 
Investigator’s discretion. 
x During both full and abbreviated physical examinations, Investigators or designee 
should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. 
x Height and weight will be measured and recorded at the timepoints indicated in 
Section 1.3. 
Page [ADDRESS_600840] 5 minutes and will include temperature (°C; tympanic or oral), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, and pulse.  
The timing of vital sign measurements is described in the SoA ( Section 1.3). Of note, vital signs 
measurements will be performed every [ADDRESS_600841] hour after dose administration to 
monitor for anaphylaxis. 
Out of range blood pressure or pulse measurements will be repeated at the Investigator’s 
discretion. Confirmed, clinically significant v ital sign measurements will be recorded as AEs. 
8.2.3.  Electrocardiograms 
Triplicate 12-lead ECGs will be recorded at the time points described in the SoA ( Section 1.3) 
but should not be performed after any major meal (ie, major meals should be withheld until after 
ECG assessments). All ECGs should occur before the vital signs assessment and PK/PD sampling (if 1 or both are scheduled in addition to an ECG during a timepoint). 
Electrocardiograms recorded during Screening will be stored electronically. Only ECGs recorded 
electronically will be valid ECGs for any purpose other than safety assessment. Each ECG 
recorder will be set up to the required techni cal specifications and containing the information 
required to identify the records. Each ECG record ing will be clearly identified (participant ID, 
visit date, and the actual times of ECG recordings). 
Recording of each 12-lead ECG will be made after the participants have been resting in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_12473] 10 minutes. The participants  will avoid postural changes during the ECG 
recording and clinical staff will ensure that participants are awake during the ECG recording. 
At each time point, the ECG will be recorded in triplicate, to reduce variance and improve the 
precision of measurement. The triplicates will be performed sequentially within a 15-minute window and each ECG recording (trace) will last 10 seconds; repeat ECGs will be performed 
until these criteria are met. 
ECGs will be assessed per applicable standard operating procedure to enable reading and 
analyzing at least 5 complexes per derivation. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Safety Review of 12-lead Electrocardiograms 
All recorded ECGs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_26359]. If a participant 
shows a clinically significant abnormal ECG, addi tional safety recordings may be made, and the 
abnormality will be followed to resolution. 
8.2.4.  Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments 
All protocol-required assessmen ts, as defined in Section 10.2, must be conducted in accordance 
with the SoA (Section  1.3) and the Laboratory Manual. Clini cal and laboratory assessments to

significant abnormal laboratory findings are t hose which are not associated with the 
underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_468835]’s condition. 
x All laboratory tests with values consider ed clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study will be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline 
or are no longer considered clinically si gnificant by [CONTACT_413848]. 
 If such values do not return to normal/b aseline within a period of time judged 
reasonable by [CONTACT_737], the etio logy should be identified, and Alexion 
notified. 
 If laboratory values from non-protocol-specified laboratory assessments 
performed at the institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically  significant by [CONTACT_737] (eg, SAE 
or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the eCRF.  
The maximum total blood volume collected from participants in the study will not exceed 500 mL in 16 weeks. The American Red Cross at the time of completion of this protocol 
(https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html) states that people can give up to 470 mL every 
56 days. Therefore, the 500 mL per 16 weeks perm itted in this study is a pproximately consistent 
with current clinical practice. 
8.2.5.  Drug and Alcohol Screen 
A urine sample for drug screen will be analyzed for the substances listed in Section 10.2. Timing 
for urine drug screen and alcohol tests is specified in the SoA ( Section 1.3). 
8.2.6.  Pregnancy 
Pregnancy data from fe male participants and female spouses/par tners of male participants will be 
collected from the first dose of ALXN1850 and at the time points specified in the SoA  
(Section 1.3). Any female participant who become s pregnant during the study should be 
considered for discontinuation from the study inte rvention. If a pregnancy is reported, the 
Investigator must immediately inform Alexion within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy 
and follow the procedures outlined in Section 10.4.3. 
8.2.7.  Injection or Infusion Site Evaluation 
Subcutaneous injection- or IV infusion-site evaluations will be performed at the time points specified in the SoA ( Section  1.3).  
8.2.8.  Ophthalmological Examination 
Ophthalmological examinations will be performed at the timepoints indicated in Section 1.3.The 
examination will assess for papi[INVESTIGATOR_468797]-lamp examination and fundoscopy. The ophtha lmology examination should be performed by 
a qualified ophthalmologist or an optometrist (ie, Doctor of Optometry) as long as the optometrist works under the supervision of an ophthalmologist.

8.2.9.  Renal Ultrasound 
A renal ultrasound will be performed at the timepoints indicated in Section 1.3 to assess for the 
presence of nephrocalcinosis. 
8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The definitions of AEs and SAEs can be found in  Section 10.3.  All AEs will be reported to the 
Investigator or qualified designee by [CONTACT_2299]. 
The Investigator and any qualified designees ar e responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following 
up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study intervention or study procedures, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study drug  (see Section 7). 
Procedures for recording, evaluating, follow- up, and reporting AEs and SAEs are outlined in 
Section 10.3. 
8.3.1.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE 
All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the final follow-up- visit 
(See Section  1.3). 
Medical occurrences that begin before the st art of study drug but after obtaining informed 
consent will be considered as pretreatment AEs. 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to Alexion immediately and under no circumstance 
should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Section 10.3. The Investigator will submit any 
updated SAE data to Alexion within 24 hours of awareness. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE data after conclusion of the study 
participation. However, if the Investigator learns  of any SAE, including a death, at any time after 
a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably 
related to the study intervention or study particip ation, the Investigator must promptly notify 
Alexion. 
8.3.2.  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs 
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures 
for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.3. 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when  detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences. 
8.3.3.  Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow-up- on each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed up until resolution, 
stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3). Further information on follow-up procedures is provided in  Section 10.3. 
Page [ADDRESS_600842] th e safety of participants and the safety 
of a study intervention under clin ical investigation are met. 
x Alexion has a legal responsibility to notif y both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety  of a study intervention under clinical 
investigation. Alexion will comply with  country-specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards 
(IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committees  (IECs), and Investigators. 
x Alexion is required to submit individua l suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) reports (defined in  Section 10.3.3 ) in the format of 
MedWatch 3500 or Council for Internationa l Organizations of Medical Sciences 
(CIOMS) I Form to health authorities and Investigators as required. 
x An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary  or listing of SAEs) from Alexion will 
review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate 
according to local requirements. 
8.3.5.  Disease-Related Events and/or Disease-Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as AEs 
or SAEs 
Any increase on frequency and/or intensity in the signs/symptoms of the disease under study will 
be reported as AEs. 
8.3.6.  Adverse Events of Special Interest 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Injection Site Reactions 
Injection site reactions (ISRs) are defined as AEs localized to the site of study drug 
administration that occur at any time during study participation that are assessed by [CONTACT_364783], probably, or definite ly related to study drug. AE intensity reporting 
procedures are outlined in  Section 10.3.4. 
Injection site reactions may occur at any timepoint after study drug administration. There is no 
additional laboratory testing required for ISRs.  
The Investigator is responsible for monitoring for ISRs in patients throughout the duration of the 
study. As part of the study-required physical examinations, Investigators should evaluate injection sites for signs of reaction(s). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Injection-associated Reactions 
Injection-associated reactions are defined as systemic AEs (eg, fever, chills, flushing, alterations 
in heart rate and blood pressure, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and generalized skin 
rashes) occurring during or within [ADDRESS_600843] medical 
occurrence resulting from the overdose. There is no specific treatment for an overdose. 
In the event of an overdose, the Investigator should: 
1.Contact [CONTACT_27465].
2.Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE.
3.Obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis if requested by [CONTACT_1689] (determined
on a case-by-case basis).
4.Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in the
eCRF.
8.5. Pharmacokinetics 
x Whole blood samples will be collected for m easurement of plasma concentrations of 
ALXN1850 as specified in the SoAs (see Section 1.3). Additional samples may be 
collected during the study if warranted an d agreed upon between the Investigator and 
Alexion. 
x Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided by 
[CONTACT_57747]. The actual date and time (24-hour clock time) of each sample will be 
recorded. Permitted collection windows are specified in the SoAs (see Section 1.3). 
x Samples will be used to evaluate the PK of ALXN1850. Samples collected for 
analyses of ALXN1850 plasma concentration ma y also be used to evaluate safety or 
efficacy aspects related to concerns arising during or after the study. Unused samples may be retained for a period of up to 5 years (or per regional requirements) to 
perform additional PK assessments as necessary. 
x Samples may be used for research to  develop methods, assays, for prognosis, 
diagnostics, and/or treatment monitoring related to the mechanism of action of 
ALXN1850. 
8.6. Pharmacodynamics 
x Whole blood samples will be collected for measurement of PLP/PL, PA, and PPi [INVESTIGATOR_468798] (see Section 1.3). Additional samples may be collected during 
the study if warranted and agreed upon between the Investigator and Alexion. 
x Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided by

retained for a period of up to 5 years (or per regional requirements) to perform 
additional PD assessments as necessary. 
x Samples may be used for research to  develop methods, assays, for prognosis, 
diagnostics, and/or treatment monitoring related to the mechanism of action of 
ALXN1850. 
8.7. Genetics 
To confirm eligibility, genetic testing for ALPL  gene mutation will be performed during the 
Screening Period. No additional samples will be obtained for other genetic analysis during this 
study. 
8.8. Biomarkers 
Hypophosphatasia is characterized by [CONTACT_468836], emanating from a 
failure to mineralize bone matrix due to elevated concentrations of the TNSALP substrates, including PPi [INVESTIGATOR_468799]. Failure to mineralize bone matrix results in osteomalacia (softening of 
bones). Bone turnover markers such as osteocalcin,  N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen 
(P1NP), and serum C-telopeptide cross-link of type  1 collagen (sCTX) are a series of protein or 
protein derivative biomarkers released during bone  remodeling due to activity of osteoblasts or 
osteoclasts. Bone turnover markers respond rapi [INVESTIGATOR_468800]; therefore, 
they have utility in determini ng patient response to and compliance with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_468801] ( Greenblatt, 2017 ). 
Blood samples for bone turnover marker analysis (osteocalcin, P1NP, and sCTX) will be collected at the time points indicated in Section 1.3. 
Unused samples may be retained for a period of up to 5 years (or per regional requirements) to 
perform additional assessments as necessary. 
Samples may be used for research to develop methods, assays, for prognosis, diagnostics, and/or 
treatment monitoring related to th e mechanism of action of ALXN1850. 
8.9. Immunogenicity Assessments 
Antibodies to ALXN1850 (ie, ADA) will be evaluated in serum samples collected from all 
participants according to the SoA (see Section 1.3). Additionally, serum samples should also be 
collected at the final visit from participants who discontinued the study intervention or were 
withdrawn from the study. These samples will be tested by [CONTACT_468837]’s designee. 
Serum samples will be screened for antibodies binding to ALXN1850 and the titer of confirmed 
positive samples will be reported. Other analyses may be performed to further characterize the 
immunogenicity of ALXN1850. 
The detection and characterization of antibodies to ALXN1850 will be performed using a 
validated assay method by [CONTACT_468838]. Samples collected at the same 
time points as those collected for detection of ALXN1850 antibodies will be evaluated for 
ALXN1850 concentration to enable in terpretation of the antibody data . Antibodies may be 
further characterized and/or eval uated for their ability to neutralize the activity of the study drug.

Samples will be analyzed on a per batch basis. In the event that a participant experiences an SAE 
potentially related to immunogenicity, that participant’s sample or set of samples will be sent for 
analysis at the time of the event and data will be provided to the SRC. Unused samples may be 
retained for a period of up to 5 years (or pe r regional requirements) to perform additional 
assessments as necessary. 
Samples may be used for research to develop methods, assays, for prognosis, diagnostics, and/or 
treatment monitoring related to th e mechanism of action of ALXN1850. 
Participants who are positive for ADAs at the last assessment of the study will be given options 
to enable further monitoring of their ADA values after the end of the study; these options may 
include enrollment in the Global HPP Registry. 
Antibodies to asfotase alfa will also be evalua ted in participants who have previously received 
asfotase alfa at Screening. 
8.10. Health Economics Data and Medical Resource Utilization 
Health economics data and medical resource utilization will not be collected or evaluated in this 
study. 
Page [ADDRESS_600844] 9 participants (3 per cohort) to “complete” (ie, participant completed EoT assessments, all PK/PD sampling 
was performed within window, and all doses were r eceived per the SoA) the study. It is expected 
that 9 “completed” participants will support adequa te characterization of safety, tolerability, and 
PK/PD for the ALXN1850 compound. 
9.3. Populations for Analyses 
The population sets used for analysis sets are defined in the following: 
Population Description
Safety Set All participants who receive any amount of study drug will be included in 
the Safety Set. Participants will be analyzed according to the study drug received. 
Pharmacokinetic Set All treated participants for whom the PK profile of ALXN1850 can be 
adequately characterized will be included in the PK Set. Pharmacokinetic analyses will be based upon the study drug received. 
Pharmacodynamic Set All treated participants for whom the PD profile of ALXN1850 can be 
adequatel y characterized will be included in the PD Set. 
Immunogenicity Set All treated participants for whom pre and postdose anti-ALXN1850 
antibody samples are obtained will be included in the Immunogenicity Set. 
9.4. Statistical Analyses 
In general, descriptive sta tistics for continuous variables will include number of non-missing 
values, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Descriptive 
statistics for PK parameters will include number of observations, arithmetic mean, standard 
deviation, arithmetic coefficient of variati on (%CV), median, minimum, maximum, geometric 
mean, and geometric %CV. Categorical variab les will be summarized using percentages and 
frequency counts, by [CONTACT_468839]. 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be develope d and finalized before fi rst data cutoff/database 
lock and will further describe the participant populations to be included in the analyses, and 
procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spur ious data as appropriate. This section is a 
high-level summary of the planne d statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints.

9.4.2.  Safety Analyses 
The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of ALXN1850. The 
endpoints to support the primary objective include  incidence of TEAEs and treatment-emergent 
serious adverse events (TESAEs). The incidence of TEAEs and TESAEs will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and Preferred Term by [CONTACT_468840], by 
[CONTACT_926], and by [CONTACT_468841] n. Adverse events will be categorized by [CONTACT_468842] (ie, IV or SC). Treatment-emergent 
AEs and TESAEs resulting in withdrawal from the study will be listed.  Participants having 
multiple AEs within a category (eg, overall, SOC, Preferred Term) will be counted once in that 
category. For severity tables, a participant’s most  severe event within a category will be counted. 
Adverse events of special interest will be analyzed similarly. 
Changes from baseline in vital signs and laboratory assessments (as displayed in Table 7 ) will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_468843]. Laboratory pa rameter values will be graded based on the 
National Cancer Institute CTCAE grading for severity (v5.0, published 27 Nov 2017). Shift 
tables by [CONTACT_468844]. These tables will 
summarize the number of participants with each baseline grade relative to the normal ranges and 
changes to the worst highest grade assessed postdose during the study. 
Electrocardiogram parameters will be measured at the specified time points, including heart rate, 
PR, RR, QRS, QT, and QTcF intervals. The average of the triplicate ECG readings at the time points collected will be calculated, and changes from pretreatment baseline values will be 
assessed. 
An outlier analysis will be performed that will summarize the frequency and percentage of 
participants who meet any of the following outlier criteria at each visit. 
x QT, QTcF interval > 450 msec 
x QT, QTcF interval > 480 msec 
x QT, QTcF interval > 500 msec 
x QT, QTcF interval increases from baseline > 30 msec 
x QT, QTcF interval increases from baseline > 60 msec 
Physical examination results will be classified as Normal, Abnormal Not Clinically Significant (NCS), Abnormal Clinically Significant (C S), and Not Examined. The results will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_468845]. 
All concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug 
Dictionary, and the frequency and percentage of concomitant medications will be summarized. 
While safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Set (defined in Section 9.3 ), all safety data 
collected will be listed by [CONTACT_3445].

and accurate source documents (eg, medical r ecords, ECGs, AE and concomitant medication 
reporting, raw data collection forms) designed to record all observations and other pertinent data 
for each participant. 
Data reported on the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must  be consistent with 
the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. Electronic case report forms must 
be completed by [CONTACT_468853]. The 
Investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the 
study. Also, current medical records must be availa ble to Alexion, Alexion delegates, and health 
authorities, as requested. Source documents are filed at the investigational site. 
Per ICH E6 (R2) guidelines and good documenta tion practice requirements, source documents 
and study records in all media (eg, paper, el ectronic) must be Attributable, Legible, 
Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, and Complete. 
10.1.8.  Study and Site Start and Closure 
The study start date is the date on whic h the first participant is consented. 
Alexion reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any reason 
at its sole discretion. Study sites will be clos ed after the study is completed or following the 
decision to close or terminate the study. A study site is considered closed when all participants 
have completed the End of Study or Early Disconti nuation visit, all data have been collected and 
entered into the electronic data capture system , all required documents and study supplies have 
been collected and reconciled, and a study- site closure visit has been performed. 
The Investigator may initiate study-site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. 
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_468854]: 
x Failure of the Investigator to comply w ith the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, Alex ion’s procedures, or ICH GCP guidelines 
x Inadequate recruitment of participants by [CONTACT_737] 
x Decision on the part of Alexion to suspend or discontinue testing, evaluation, or 
development of the study drug 
x Discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to participants enrolled in the study

If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, Alexion shall promptly inform the 
Investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any contract research 
organization(s) used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by [CONTACT_13179]. The Investigat or shall promptly inform the participant and 
should assure appropriate partic ipant therapy and/or follow-up. 
10.1.9.  Publication Policy 
x Where possible, primary manuscripts reporting results of the primary efficacy endpoint or the final results will be submitted for publication within 12 to 18 months 
of the primary evaluation date or end of study, whichever is earlier. 
x Investigators who participate as au thors in manuscripts derived from 
Alexion-sponsored studies will agree to the prerequisites as outlined in the Alexion 
author engagement agreement prior to  engaging in manuscript development. 
x The Investigator agrees to submit proposals for new manuscripts (whether or not the 
proposed analyses are derived from protoc ol-specified endpoints) to Alexion for 
review and consideration. All manuscrip ts or abstracts emanating from approved 
proposals are to be submitted to Alexion for review before submission to the 
journal/society. This allows Alexion to pr otect proprietary information and provide 
comments. 
 The proprietary nature of some development work may preclude publication. In 
some cases, it may be necessary to delay a publication to allow Alexion to ensure 
protection of intellectual property. 
x Primary publications, including congress and journal publications, containing the protocol-specified results of a study should occur prior to the publication of 
individual study site results or case reports. Alexion’s policy prohibits duplicate 
publication, whereby [CONTACT_468855]-reviewed journal manuscripts. 
 Encore congress publications may be ap propriate to allow communication of 
research findings to relevant audience and geographical regions. 
x Alexion will comply with the requirements for publication of study results as defined 
by [CONTACT_468856]. In 
accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, Alexion will generally 
support publication of multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data. In this case, a Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9231]. 
x Authorship will be determined by [CONTACT_468857]. 
x Alexion will Publish Patient Lay Summaries and include participants and/or 
caregivers as reviewers for readability and understanding of lay person language.

10.3. Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting 
10.3.1.  Definition of AE 
AE Definition 
x An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered 
a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment (ICH E2A). 
x Note : An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease [new or exacerbated] temporally associated with the use of the study intervention, whether or not considered related to the stud
y intervention. 
Events Meeting the AE Definition 
x Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator. 
x Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
x New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it may have been 
present before the start of the study. 
x Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction. 
x Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a 
concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.
 
Events Not Meeting the AE Definition 
x Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): The condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_468803], admissions for social reasons or for convenience).  
x Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of 
the study that do not worsen.  
x A medication error (including intentional misuse, abuse, and overdose of the product) or use other than what 
is defined in the protocol is not considered an AE unless there is an untoward medical occurrence as a result of a medication error.  
x Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposure to study intervention are to be reported within 24 hours of Investigator/site awareness. Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding will be collected for regulatory reporting and safety evaluation.  
x Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_78782]’s condition. 
x The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. 
x Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).

10.3.2.  Definition of SAE 
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then  it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptom s of the disease under study, death due to 
progression of disease). 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: 
1.Results in death
2.Is life-threatening
The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of
death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it
was more severe.
3.Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22770], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually involving at least an overnight
stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate inthe physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If acomplication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious. When in doubt asto whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not
considered an AE.
4.Results in persistent disability/incapacity
x The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.
x This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such asuncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) 
which ma
y interfere with or prevent ever yday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
5.Is a con genital anomal y/birth defect
6.Other situations:
x Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate inother situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22772]. These events should usually be considered serious. 
x Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or development of dru
g dependenc y or dru g abuse.  
10.3.3.  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Definition 
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is defined as: 
An event that is assessed as serious by [CONTACT_11219]/or Alexion that is not listed in the appropriate Reference Safety Information (IB) and has been assessed that there is at least a reasonable possibility that the 
event is related to the Investigational Medicinal Product by [CONTACT_11219]/or Alexion. 
Alexion has procedures that will be followed for the recording, medical assessment, and expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are consistent with global regulations, legislation, and guidance documents. 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will undergo expedited reporting to the national regulatory 
authorities, IRBs/IECs, and Investi
gators followin g local re gulator y reportin g requirements where applicable.  
10.3.4.  Recording and Follow-Up of AE and/or SAE 
Recording of AE and/or SAE 
x When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_468804], laborator y reports, and dia gnostics reports) related to the event.

____________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Protocol Amendment 5 ALXN1850-HPP-101 
10 Mar 2022 
Recording of AE and/or SAE 
x The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF. 
x It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical records to Alexion 
or designee in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE eCRF page. 
x There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_468805]. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_468806]. 
x The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be 
documented as the AE/SAE. 
Assessment of Intensity 
The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and assign it to one of the following categories from National Cancer Institute CTCAE v5.0, published 27 Nov 2017:  
x Grade 1: Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
x Grade 2: Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities) 
x Grade 3: Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities) 
x Grade 4: Life-threatening 
x Grade 5: Fatal 
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the AE duration at each level 
of intensity to be evaluated. Adverse events characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and 
duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], if the severity of the intermittent event changes.  
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least [ADDRESS_600851] be provided for all AEs (both nonserious and serious). This assessment must be recorded in the eCRF  and on any additional forms, as appropriate. The 
definitions for the causality assessments are as follows: 
 Not related: There is no reasonable possibility the study intervention caused the AE. 
The AE has a more likely alternative etiology; it may be due to underlying orconcurrent illness, complications, concurrent treatments, or effects of anotherconcurrent drug.
The event does not follow a reasonable temporal relationship to administration of the
study intervention.
 Related: There is a reasonable possibility the study intervention caused the AE. 
The AE has a temporal relationship to the administration of the study intervention.
The event does not have a likely alternative etiology.
The event corresponds with the known pharmaceutical profile of the study
intervention.
There is improvement on discontinuation and/or reappearance on rechallenge.
x The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. 
x Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration will be considered and investigated. 
x The Investigator will also consult the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her 
assessment.

____________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Protocol Amendment 5 ALXN1850-HPP-101 
10 Mar 2022 
Assessment of Causality 
x For each AE/SAE, the Investigator must  document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the 
AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. 
x There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred, and the Investigator has minimal information to 
include in the initial report to Alexion or designee. However, it is very important that the Investigator 
always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to 
Alexion or designee. 
x The Investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up information and send an SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment. 
x The causalit
y assessment is one of the criteria used when determinin g regulator y reportin g requirements.  
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 
x The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_468859]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. 
x If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow-up period, the Investigator will provide Alexion or designee with a copy of any postmortem findings including histopathology. 
x New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF. 
x The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to Alexion or designee within 24 hours of receipt of the 
information.  
10.3.5.  Reporting of SAEs 
SAE Reporting to Alexion via Paper Safety Reporting Form 
1.All SAEs will be recorded and reported to Alexion immediately and within 24 hours of awareness.
2.All SAEs will be reported using the Safety Reporting Form and submitted to Alexion Global Drug Safety(GDS). The Investigator must complete, sign, and date the SAE pages, verify the accuracy of theinformation recorded on the SAE pages with the corresponding source documents, and send a copy viaemail or facsimile to the contact [CONTACT_51259]:
 Email: [EMAIL_8293] or Fax: + [PHONE_1218] 
3.Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should be entered into the eCRF and sent toAlexion GDS within [ADDRESS_600852] provide the following:
 Appropriate and requested follow-up information in the time frame detailed above 
 Causality of the SAE(s) 
 Treatment of/intervention for the SAE(s) 
 Outcome of the SAE(s) 
 Medical records and laboratory/diagnostic information 
5.All paper forms and follow-up information submitted to Alexion GDS must  be accompanied by a cover

10.4. Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy Information 
10.4.1.  Definitions 
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) 
A woman is considered fertile following mena rche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below). If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescen ts or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be 
confirmed before first dose of study interventio n, additional evaluation should be considered. 
Women in the Following Categories Are Not Considered WOCBP 
1.Premenarchal
2.Premenopausal female with one of the following:
x Documented hysterectomy 
x Documented bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] 
x Documented bilateral oophorectomy 
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, 
(eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), Investigator discretion should be applied to 
determining study entry. 
Note : Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview. 
3.Postmenopausal female
x A postmenopausal state is defined as no mens es for 12 months without an alternative
medical cause prior to the Day 1 Visit.  A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH ) level in the postmenopausal range 
may be used to confirm a postmenopausal  state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence 
of [ADDRESS_600853] 6 weeks prior to the Day 1 Visit.

teratogenic effects are suspected to be transferred to a fetus/embryo from a female spouse/partner 
of a male participant, pregnancy follow-up information will be obtained for the partner who 
becomes pregnant (refer to  Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). In these cases, follow-up will be conducted on the 
pregnant partner in the same manner as a female participant who becomes pregnant during the 
study. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Guidance for Female Participants 
Female participants of childbearing potential mu st have a negative pregnancy test (serum) at 
Screening. Additional requirements for pre gnancy testing during and after dosing with 
ALXN1850 are indicated in the SoA ( Section 1.3). 
The Investigator is responsible for the review of  medical history, menstrual history, and recent 
sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy. 
The Investigator should evaluate the potential for contraceptive method in relationship to the first 
dose of ALXN1850. 
Female participants of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of 
contraception, including at least [ADDRESS_600854] dose of ALXN1850.
2.Progestogen-only hormonal contra ception associated with inhibition of ovulation (either
oral, injectable, or implantable) for at least [ADDRESS_600855] dose of ALXN1850.
5.Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception (either oral,intravaginal, or transdermal) for at least [ADDRESS_600856] dose of ALXN1850.
6.Surgical sterilization of the male partner (medical assessment of azoospermia is required
if vasectomy was performed within [ADDRESS_600857] dose of ALXN1850). Male
partner is still required to use condom during sexual intercourse.
7.Sexual abstinence for female participants:
a.Sexual abstinence is considered a highl y effective method only if defined as
refraining from heterosexual intercourse. In this study, abstinence is only acceptable
if consistent with the participant’s preferred and usual lifestyle. Abstinent female
participants must refrain from heterosexual intercourse for at least 3 months after the
final dose of ALXN1850.
The following methods of contraception ar e considered unacceptable in this study: 
 Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal or post ovulation methods 
 Withdrawal (coitus interruptus) 
 Spermicides only 
 Lactational amenorrhea method

 Female condom and ma le condom should not be used together 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Guidance for Male Participants 
Contraception is the responsibility of the heterose xually active male partic ipants in the study, 
regardless of his female partne r’s method of contraception. 
Male participants who have ha d a vasectomy > [ADDRESS_600858] had a 
vasectomy < [ADDRESS_600859] 
3 months after their final dose of ALXN1850. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Sexual Abstinence for Male Participants 
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effec tive method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse. In this study, abstin ence is only acceptable if consistent with the 
participant’s preferred and usual lifestyle.  Abstinent male participants who become 
heterosexually active must use a condom  with spermicide during intercourse. 
Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, symptother mal, or post ovulation methods for a female 
partner) is not considered a highly effective method of contraception for male participants. 
Male participants must not donate sperm from the Day [ADDRESS_600860] 3 months after their 
final dose of ALXN1850. 
10.4.3.  Collection of Pregnancy Information 
Pregnancy data will be collected  during this study for all fema le participants  and female 
spouses/partners of male participants from the first dose of ALXN1850 until 3 months after the 
final dose of ALXN1850 is administered. Any fema le participant who b ecomes pregnant during 
the study should be considered for discontinuation from the study intervention. Exposure during pregnancy (also referred to as exposure in utero) can be the result of either maternal exposure or 
transmission of study intervention via semen following paternal exposure. If a female participant 
or a male participant’s female spouse/partner becomes pregnant during the conduct of this study, 
the Investigator must submit the “Pregnancy/Breastfeeding Reporting and Outcome Form” to 
Alexion GDS via facsimile or email. When the outcome of the pregna ncy becomes known, the 
form should be updated and submitted to Alexion GDS. If additional follow-up is required, the 
Investigator will be requested to provide the information. 
Exposure of an infant to study intervention during breastfeeding must also be reported (via the 
“Pregnancy/Breastfeeding Reporting and Outcom e Form”) and any AEs experienced by [CONTACT_468861]. 
Pregnancy is not regarded as an AE unless ther e is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_468807] a contraceptive medication. However, complications of 
pregnancy and abnormal out comes of pregnancy are AEs and ma y meet the criteria for an SAE 
(eg, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, in trauterine fetal demise,  neonatal death, or 
congenital anomaly). Elective abor tions without complications should not be reported as AEs.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Male Participants with Partners Who Become Pregnant 
x The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male 
participant’s female partner who becomes pr egnant while the male participant is in 
this study. This applies only to male  participants who receive ALXN1850. 
x After obtaining the necessary signed info rmed consent from the pregnant female 
partner directly, the Investigator will reco rd pregnancy information on the appropriate 
“Pregnancy/Breastfeeding Reporting and Outcome Form” and submit it to Alexion 
within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The female partner will also 
be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of 
the mother and child will be forwarded to Alexion. Generally, the follow-up will be no longer than 3 months following the delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of 
anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Female Participants Who Become Pregnant 
x The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. The initial Information will be 
recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to Alexion within 24 hours of 
learning of a participant’s pregnancy. 
x For all Alexion products, both in developm ent or post approval, exposure during 
pregnancy must be recorded and the pre gnancy followed, until the outcome of the 
pregnancy is known (ie, spontaneous miscarri age, elective termination, normal birth, 
or congenital abnormality), even if the pa rticipant discontinues the study intervention 
or withdraws from the study. The Investigator will collect follow-up information on 
the participant and the neonate and the in formation will be forwarded to Alexion. 
Generally, follow-up will not be required for longer than 3 months beyond the 
estimated delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
x Pregnancy is not considered as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_468808] a contraceptive medication. 
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be 
reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion (occurring at < 22 weeks gestational age) or still birth (occurring at > 22 weeks gestational age) is always 
considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any poststudy pregnancy 
related SAE considered reasonably rela ted to the study intervention by [CONTACT_468862]. Wh ile the Investigator is not obligated to 
actively seek this information in former study participants, he or she may learn of an 
SAE through spontaneous reporting. 
x Any female participant who becomes pregnant while par ticipating in the study will 
discontinue study intervention but will not be withdrawn from the study.

10.5. Biomarkers 
x Blood samples will be collected for biomarker analyses and the data will be used for 
research (eg, exploratory) related to ALXN1850  or HPP  and related diseases. The 
samples may also be used to develop tests/ assays including diagnostic tests related to 
ALXN1850 and/or other TNSALP ERT interventions and HPP. 
x The samples may be analyzed as part of a multistudy assessment of biomarkers in 
response to ALXN1850 or TNSALP ERT interventions to understand study disease 
or related conditions. 
x The results of biomarker analyses may be reported in the clinical study report (CSR) 
or in a separate study summary. 
x Alexion or designee will store the sample s obtained for biomarker analyses in a 
secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality. 
x The samples will be retained while research on ALXN1850, TNSALP ERT 
interventions, or HPP continues but no longer than 5 years or other period as per local 
requirements.

10.7. COVID-19 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Hypophosphatasia can cause irreversible morbidity a nd even mortality, if untreated. As such, and 
due to the limited number of available treatment options, the benefit a participant may receive 
from joining a clinical study with a new investigational treatment, which may improve current 
treatment options available for adults with HPP, is potentially significant. In this case, the fact that the study is open-label and every participan t is treated with the study interventional drug 
also contributes to the potential benefit a partic ipant may derive from partaking in the study. The 
site Investigator will balance the risk/benefit c onsiderations in the study participant taking these 
factors into account. 
The potential risks identified and mitigation measures put in place in light of the COVID-19 
pandemic are provided in Table 8 .

Risks category Summary of Data/ 
Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy 
Potential risks 
Potentially higher risk 
population for SARS-CoV-2 infection Based on Alexion’s understanding of the mechanism of action for asfotase alfa and the currently collected safety data, it does not appear that participants treated with 
ALXN1850 have a higher risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a viral infection. During the time that the COVID-19 pandemic is active, Alexion will recommend that sites in a position to start the study and enroll participants follow the national and institutional guidances regarding prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Additionally, during that time period, it is 
expected that Investigators and their staff will take all possible precautions in order to minimize a participant’s potential exposure to SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_600861] clinical study-related activities.  
During this timeframe, participants eligibility as 
well as site capacity will be reviewed by [CONTACT_468863] 80 of 97

Activities (cont.) treatment visit should also have the 
assessments for that visit performed, if 
possible, which is noted under the SoAs 
Added a PK/PD sample collection at the end of infusion (for IV doses only) in (new) Table 3  Following the FDA’s recommendation received after Protocol Amendment 3 submission, Alexion decided this timepoint would allow a better assessment of the ALXN1850 IV PK/PD parameters 
Added a footnote in the SoAs that a positive drug test result for a non-prescribed substance received at any visit will lead to participant discontinuation  For clarity and alignment within the protocol 
Removed “24-hour Holter ECG” from the SoA and added an “X” in the “12-lead ECG (triplicate)” assessment row 
at the Screenin
g timepoint 24-hour Holter ECG was determined by
[CONTACT_468870] 12-lead ECG at Screening is sufficient,
which will reduce participant/site burden
For the assessment row “Urine for 
calcium, phosphorus, calcium, PEA, and creatinine” Removed the duplicate “calcium”  Removed the associated note “Morning spot urine vs. 24-hour urine.” Clarified that a Baseline sample is collected only on Day -1  Typo Participants may now be admitted to the site on the dosing day (if day prior is approved Outpatient), which would burden them with collecting morning urine at home prior to coming to the site. 24-hour urine was determined sufficient.
To appropriately assess the significance
of any changes in these parameters, aBaseline urine sample is needed predoseon the same day as the blood sample forclinical chemistr
y
Added predose Day 1 assessment for 
bone biomarkers (sCTX, P1NP, 
osteocalcin) To clarify that this assessment is needed 
predose on Day 1 for all participants 
(not just the first participant) 
Included clarifications regarding the following assessments: Chemistry tests: ionized calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium Blood PTH Blood for PTH was listed in the same assessment row as ionized calcium, phosphorous, and magnesium; however, the latter should instead be included in the chemistry assessment (already listed in Table 7, previousl
y Table 6)   
Removed timepoints for urine drug screen on Days 51, 65, and 85 Added a footnote that a negative PCP result at Screening is required for participant enrollment; however, drug screens collected on the days prior to each dose are not required to confirm a 
negative PCP result prior to dosing. 
Once the PCS result is received, the participant will be discontinued from 
the stud
y if positive These timepoints were determined 
unnecessary by [CONTACT_468871] 3 study visits (ie, potential drug interaction is no longer a concern). Participants are already made aware that they must refrain from illicit drug use 
throughout the study 
For clarity because PCP results will not 
be received until 3-5 days after sampling

participants]) for hematology (except 
HbA1c), chemistry, urinalysis, and 
coagulation laborator y tests assessments in previous protocol 
versions. Now that most EoS 
assessments will be done at EoT 
Reduced the number of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) collection timepoints (now only required at Screening). For clarity, HbA1c was separated from hematology in the SoAs Clinically significant changes in HbA1c between the visits are not expected, and this will reduce participant/site burden  
Expanded the permitted time window for the ophthalmological and renal examinations from 40 days to ≤ [ADDRESS_600879] participant safety and should ease participant burden 
Added injection/infusion site evaluation timepoints to indicate every [ADDRESS_600880] hour and at 2, 8, 
and 12 hours postdose (all relative to start-of- infusion [IV dose]/time of 
in
jection [SC doses]), Greater frequency for this assessment will increase participants' safety monitoring while not increasing their 
burden  
Added permitted assessment windows 
in the footnotes regarding the ECG and PK timepoints at T
max (EoI) For consistency because all other ECG and PK timepoints have permitted windows indicated 
Modified when samples should be collected following a suspected hypersensitivity reaction from “2 hours and 24 hours postdose” to “as soon as possible (within 1 hour of the reaction) and again at 2 and 8 hours (+ 1 hour window each) after the 1st 
sample.”  Based on similar past studies and 
immunologist advice, it is expected that modifying these timepoints will capture more accurate suspected hypersensitivity reaction test results  
Added a note to each SoA that all postdose assessment timepoints are relative to the start of infusion (IV dose) or time of SC injection except the end-of-infusion vital signs, PK/PD 
sample, and infusion site evaluation 
(IV dose onl
y) For clarity 
For all participants on each dosing day (now Table 3), combined the 4- and 8-
hr postdose assessments (same for both) into a new 6-hr postdose column and removed the 4- and 8-hr postdose columns from the table It was determined that a PK/PD sample collection at 6-hr postdose would be more appropriate, and with this timepoint added, the 4- and 8-hr 
postdose samples are no longer needed. This change is not expected to affect the 
assessment of safet
y/tolerabilit y

Section 1.3 Schedule of 
Activities  
Section 8.2.1 Physical Examinations Separated full and brief PEs in the 
SoAs and Section 8.2.1 
Removed “(including fundoscopy)” within the 1st bullet of Section 8.2.1 To decrease participant and site burden, 
a full PE at all visits indicated in PA3 
was deemed unnecessary. Alexion Safety and Medical determined which study visits should include a full or brief PE. 
Fundoscopy is already listed in 
Section 8.2.8 (Ophthalmological Examination) and does not need to be performed durin
g PEs 
Section 1.[ADDRESS_600881], then vitals, then 
PK/PD collection at any ECG timepoint where 1 or both of the latter assessments are also scheduled (instead of PA3’s wording that ECGs in conjunction with vitals should be 
assessed before PK/PD samplin
g) To avoid overlapped effects in QTc 
baseline due to a heavy meal For clarity as ECGs must be performed first and the site can not assess ECG and 
vitals simultaneously, anyway 
Section 5.1 Inclusion 
Criteria Added “or a variants of unknown significance” within 2a Will likely assist participant enrollment without impacting data (PD/biomarkers) associated with VUS, and often VUS chan
ge to likel y patho genic 
Removed the following from 2b “AND a plasma PLP level greater than the ULN at Screening” Participants considered for enrollment will have mild HPP and may not manifest elevation in PLP because levels 
of PLP, in general, are highly variable in 
this population  Diagnosis of HPP for inclusion criteria will be based on genetic testing, low ALP and clinical history, which will more adequately characterize the population that is intended to be enrolled Removal of this criteria will not present any change in the safety assessments or pose any additional participant risk  
Section 5.2 Exclusion Criteria Removed exclusion criteria #5, #20, and #[ADDRESS_600882] on participant safety is expected from this change considering ALXN1850’s current risk profile. 
Removed “predose on Day 1” from exclusion #7 These exclusion criteria should apply to Screenin

Slightly revised exclusion criterion #6 to say that participants with a PR value of less than 120 ms or greater than 240 ms will not qualify (instead of “120 ms > PR > 240 ms”, which can be misread) To clarify this ECG exclusion criterion 
Removed (former smokers may be permitted to enroll at the Investigator’s discretion) exclusion criterion #23 Text is unnecessary/possibly confusing as this criterion states that current smokers may be enrolled if they agree to abstain durin

For exclusion criterion #28: removed “Day -1”  
added “for non-prescribed substances” drug screen results for PCP take 3-[ADDRESS_600885] the PK of co-administered small molecules and vice versa 
Changed BMI from ≥  35 kg/m2 to 
> 40 kg/m2 in exclusion criterion #29Change will assist participant enrollment without significantly impacting ALXN1850 safet

Section 5.2 Exclusion Criteria Section 6.5.2 Disallowed Medicine and Therap
y Removed exclusion criterion #14 about denosumab  Removed the sentence about denosumab  Consideration of denosumab is unnecessary for ALXN1850 
Section 5.3 Lifestyle Considerations Changed “24 hours” to “48 hours” and “admission” to “each dose” in the 1
st 
and 2nd bullets Align with the change noted above regarding admission to the research site being permitted either the day prior to dosing or predose on the dosing day at the Investi
gator’s discretion 
Section 5.3.3 Activity Added “(strenuous, beyond the 
participant’s routine physical activities)”  To clarify what is meant by [CONTACT_468872] 6.5.1 Allowed 
Medicine and Therapy Section 6.5.2 Disallowed Medicine and Therapy Added “Prescription medications will be permitted during the study at the Investigator’s discretion and recorded in the eCRFs” from Section 6.5.1 and removed “Use of nonprescription/over-the-counter medications, including herbal remedies and supplements, must be discontinued within 7 days before Day 1, except with prior approval from 
Alexion” from Section 6.5.[ADDRESS_600886] the PK 
of co-administered small molecules and vice versa, so permitting prescription medication at the Investigator’s discretion should assist participant recruitment and retention. Also, these Sections had different wording regarding the use of herbal preparations and supplements in PA3, so they were combined in Section 6.5.1 of PA4  
Section 7.2 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal 
from the Study Added the following: 
bullets for a positive drug (except 
prescription medications) or 
pregnancy tests during the study  For clarity and consistency within the protocol

wording to the pre-existing bullet 
regarding a COVID-19 diagnosis that 
these participants will be evaluated for potential discontinuation from treatment and/or study according to the research site’s COVID-19 protocol 
participants who miss a dosing visit or 
completes it out-of-window do not need to be withdrawn or discontinued from treatment but won’t be considered “completed”  
Section 8.2.3 Electrocardiograms Added “(all 3 should be performed sequentially within a 15-minute period)” after “The triplicates will be 
performed at approximately 1-minute 
intervals” For clarity 
Section 8.5 Pharmacokinetics Section 8.6 Pharmacod
ynamics Replaced specific collection windows with a statement to refer to the SoAs To the reduce redundancy and the SoA is better designed to convey the nuances of this information  
Section 10.2 Clinical Laboratory Tests  Changed “central” to “local” in the 1
st 
bullet and deleted the 2nd bullet A local laboratory is used for safety laboratory tests 
Modified the 6th (now 5th) bullet in 
Section 10.2 to match the SoA note (serum pregnancy test at Screening and urine pregnancy tests at subsequent timepoints) For clarity, because the information in 
these 2 sections slightly conflicted in 
Protocol Amendment 3  
Section 10.2 Clinical Laboratory Tests, Table 6 Removed free hemoglobin, erythrocytes, corpuscular hemoglobin content, mean platelet volume, segmented (after neutrophils), urea, and PLP Removed tetrahydrocannabinol (cannabinoids) Added a footnote for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) to indicate that it 
only needs to be collected at Screening 
Added a footnote that clinical chemistry must be fasting only at Screening These tests were determined redundant as the information they provide may be obtained from other laboratory tests already scheduled Recreational use of cannabis use is now legal in several US states and decriminalized/permitted for medicinal use in other states and countries (medicinal use of cannabis may relieve 
some symptoms of HPP). No drug 
interactions are anticipated with ALXN1850, given experience with asfotase alfa and its mechanism of action Clinically significant changes in HbA1c between the visits are not expected, and this will reduce participant/site burden

Protocol Version:
Amendment 5 10 Mar 2022
Protocol Administrative Change Letter #[ADDRESS_600892] of the Administrative Change Letter: Clarification needed regarding the following: 
xPostdose timepoints evaluation
xInjection/infusion site evaluation
xHypersensitivity Reaction Labs
To the sites participating in the above named and num bered clinical study, this letter serves to inform 
you about the following administrative change to the above referenced protocol version.
xClarifications in Section 1.3 Schedule of Activities, Table 1, 2 and 3: Postdose timepoints 
evaluation
This document provides clarification that all postd ose timepoints are relative to the START of the IV 
infusion/injection (time 0) EXCEPT for ECG and PK/PD samples, performed/collected at EoI.
xClarifications in Section 1.3 Schedule of Activi ties, Table 1, 2 and 3: Injection/infusion site 
evaluation
This document provides clarification on the timeframes for injection/infusion site evaluation. 
Injection/infusion site evaluations have to be  performed from Time 0h and every 15 minutes (+ 5 
minutes) until the 1sthr after the start of the in jection/infusion. The rest of the timepoints have a window 
of ± 15minutes. 
xClarifications in Section 1.3 Schedule of Acti vities, Table 1, 2 and 3: Hypersensitivity 
Reaction Labs
The Hypersensitivity Reaction labs have been clarified to reconcile the information from Table 1 and 
Table 2 with Table 3.
xIf a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, in general study overview for 1stand subsequent 
participants (table 1 and 2): hypersensitivity reaction labs (tryptase, IgE, C5b-9) as well aschemistry, hematology, and urinalysis samples should be collected as soon as possible
(within 1 hour of the reaction) and again at 2 and 8 hours (+ 1 hour window each) after the 
[ADDRESS_600893] the MM for guidance.
xIf a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, the day of the dosing (table 3): hypersensitivity 
reaction labs (tryptase, IgE, C5b-9) as well as chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis 
samples should be collected as soon as possible (within 1 hour of the reaction) and again at

30/May/[ADDRESS_550445] lenses may be a beneficial option for 
pre-presby[CONTACT_434435].   
The primary outcome measure will be  change in  average score on a ten question Visual Comfort Survey 
using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) technique  from baseline to day 7 .  Secondary outcome measures 
include lens preference based on a two -alternative forced choice survey, symptom changes based on 
the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS), symptom  changes  based on  the Contact [CONTACT_434436] -8 (CLDEQ -8), and objective measures of binocularity and accommodation.  
 
II. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
American Millenials spend an average of 18 hours a day consuming media1 on smartphones, digital 
tablets and home computers – often multiple forms simultaneously. The visua l demands of this type of 
work are unique and require the use of prolonged intermediate vision. For contact [CONTACT_13293] -wearing young 
adults, correcting for this working distance before the onset of presby[CONTACT_434437].  
 
Recent studies researching contact [CONTACT_434438] a myriad of issues 
from undiagnosed accommodative -binocular disorders, to ocular surface disease, to the angle of 
computer screens.2, 3 There is no definitive evidence sta ting that one variable is responsible. 
Meanwhile, the number of symptomatic patients is growing. Although “occupational” spectacles are a 
growing trend, there appears to be no contact [CONTACT_434439].  
 
III. STUDY METHODOLOGY  
 
a. Study  Design  and Intervention  
This is a prospective, single site, randomized, double -masked, crossover pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_550446] lenses to decrease signs and sympt oms of 
asthenopia for non -presby[CONTACT_434440] (at least 6 hours) 
on digital devices. After informed consent, baseline testing will be performed to confirm an 
appropriate ocular health and refractive state and subje cts will be screened for vergence disorders for 
which a near addition would be  contraindicated. Symptoms will be measured by [CONTACT_434441]4 and CLDEQ -8.5 Subjects will also complete a 10 -question VAS survey regarding subjective visual 
comfort at t he baseline visit, at the end of day 1 and day 3 (via home diary), and at the follow -up visit 
at day [ADDRESS_550447] lenses will be used  
(Table 1) . According to recent research,6 the preferred viewing distance on digital devices for a similar 
30/May/201 7  Version 2.0 
 age group was 63 cm which would require an add of +1.59 D. A low add yielding up to +1.25 add was 
selected  to provide an intermediate near addition without compromising distance vision  as much as 
would be expected with higher add powers . 
  
The site study coordinator will mask (over -label) the contact [CONTACT_434442] s and 
subjects remain masked.   The lens power (distance only), will be transcribed on the new label  and the 
lens lot number, and expi[INVESTIGATOR_434433] a linking log by [CONTACT_434443] a group number, “A” or “B” to match the randomization order for 
the multifocal from single vision lenses so that the examiners may dispense lenses while remaining 
masked.

up to a 33% screen failure, drop -out, or poor or missing data).  A total of [ADDRESS_550450] lenses. Subjects will wear 
the lenses on a daily -wear, daily -disposable schedule. Following one week (± 2 days) of lens wear, 
subjects will be evaluated and the alternate lenses dispensed.   The sample size was based on previous 
publicat ions studying subjective and objective outcomes with multifocal and single vision contact 
[CONTACT_13276].7,8 Expectations for normal distributions of data and the ability to use parametric tests are 
generally met with sample sizes of about 30.  
 
d. Inclusion Criteria : 
 18 to 35 years of age  
 Spectacle prescription of -0.75 to -6.00 D sphere with no more than 0.75 diopters of refractive 
cylinder  
 Current  single -vision soft contact [CONTACT_35560]  
 Monocular acuity  of 20/25 or better in each eye (Snellen)  
 Self-reported minimu m of 6 hours a day on digital devices  
 Self-reported complaint of eyestrain on digital devices  
 No ocular pathology and/or history of eye surgery  
 No history of strabismus or strabismus surgery  
 No gas permeable lens wear for at least 3 months  
 Subjects may not be optometrists, opticians or optometry students  
 
Following consent, subjects will be screened further in order to exclude those with ocular surface 
disease and/or binocular disorders that would not benefit from a near addition.

f. Study Procedures  
Potential study candidates will sign an informed consent form prior to any cli nical procedures or tests 
specific to the protocol are performed.  All screening examination procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_434444]’s supervision.  Subjects will undergo 
examination to determine  eligibility at the Baseline visit.  A medical, ocular and medication history will 
be obtained.  Subjects who elect to participate will complete the study as outlined in Table [ADDRESS_550451] lens

 Burning, stinging, tearing, redness and/or itching of the eyes  
 Contact [CONTACT_434445]  
 Foreign body sensation

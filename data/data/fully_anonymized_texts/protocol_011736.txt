10 SAFETY DEFINITIONS, SAFETY MONITORING AND 
REPORTING 
10.1 Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unt oward medical occurrence associated with the 
use of a drug in humans, whether or not the event is considered drug-related.  An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended si gn (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease occurring after the subject started dosing with the study drug, without 
any judgment about causality.  Any pre-existing medical condition that worsens after 
administration of the study drug will also be considered a new AE.   
Study drug includes the investigational drug under evaluation and placebo. 
Documentation regarding the AE should be made as  to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by [CONTACT_183175]. 
10.1.1 Severity 
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative a ssessment of the degree of intensity of an AE as 
determined by [CONTACT_72079]/her by [CONTACT_102]/ subject.  The assessment 

OC-02 Nasal Spray Sponsor: Oyster Point Pharma, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol #OPP-003 July 11, 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 39 of 65 
 of severity is made irrespective of relationship to study drug or seriousness of the event and 
should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
x Mild:  Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
x Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
x Severe : Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of 
therapy, and interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_742644] should be determined by [CONTACT_1275] (in a blinded manner) using these explanations: 
x Definite:  When there are good reason and sufficient documentation to demonstrate a 
direct causal relationship between investigational product and AE 
x Probable: When there are good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a 
causal relationship in the sense of plausible, conceivable, likely but not necessarily highly probable 
x Possible: When there is sufficient information to accept the possibility of a causal 
relationship in the sense of not impossible and not unlikely, although the 
connection is uncertain or doubtful, for  example; due to missing data or 
insufficient evidence. 
x None: When there is sufficient information to accept a lack of a causal relationship, in the sense of impossible and improbable . 
x Unclassified: When the causal relationship is not assessable for whatever reason due 
to insufficient evidence, conflicting data or poor documentation.  
10.1.3 Expectedness 
The expectedness of an AE should be determi ned based upon existing safety information 
about the study drug using these explanations: 
x Unexpected:  An AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed . 
x Expected: An AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been 
observed.  
x Not Applicable: Any AE that is unrelated to the study drug. 
AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug but are not  specifically mentioned as occurring with 
the particular drug under investigation are to be considered unexpected. 
The investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE, but the final 
classificat ion is subject to the Med ical Monitor’s determination.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 40 of 65 
 10.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE is considered “serious ” (SAE) if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes: 
x Death 
 
x A life-threatening AE 
Note: An AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator 
or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.  It 
does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
x Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_163506]: The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” re fers to any inpatient admission (even if 
less than 24 hours).  For chronic or long-term inpatients, inpatient admission includes 
transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care inpatient unit.  Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80676]:  emergency room visits; outpatient/same-
day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or clinical research/phase 1 units. 
Note:  The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any extension of 
an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_565423]. 
x A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
Note:  An SAE specifically related to visual threat would be interpreted as any 
potential impairmen t or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., hemorrhage, retinal 
detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the optic nerve). 
x A congenital anomaly/birth defect in an offspring of a study subject. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212231], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.

 APPENDIX 2: EXAMINATION PROC EDURES, TESTS, EQUIPMENT, 
AND TECHNIQUES  
The following examination procedures, tests, equipment and techniques are listed in this 
Appendix:  
Visual Acuity Procedures  
LogMAR visual acuity must be assessed using an ETDRS chart. The procedure used will be 
consistent with the recommendations provided for using the ETDRS eye chart. Visual acuity should be evaluated at the beginning of each visit in the study (i.e., prior to slit lamp 
examination). Participants should use the most  recent correction to attain their corrected 
distance visual acuity (CDVA); if they forget th eir spectacles, this prescription can be placed 
in a trial frame. 
Equipment 
The visual acuity chart to be used is the ETDRS chart. If smaller reproduction (18" by 18", 
e.g., from Prevent Blindness) wall charts are used, the participant viewing distance should be 
exactly 10 feet (or as specified by [CONTACT_3455]). In ALL cases, for purposes of 
standardizing the testing conditions during the study, all sites must use only ETDRS Series 
2000 Chart 1 & 2, and the right eye should be tested first. For reflectance (wall) charts, the chart should be placed frontally and be well illuminated. 
Measurement Technique 
The chart should be at a comfortable viewing angle. The right eye should be tested first. The 
participant should attempt to read each letter, line-by-line, left to right, beginning with line 1 
at the top of the chart. The participant should be told that the chart has letters only, no numbers. If the participant reads a number, s/he should be reminded that the chart contains 
no numbers, and the examiner should then request a letter in lieu of the number. The 
participant should be asked to read slowly, so as to achieve the best identification of each 
letter. S/he is not to proceed to the next letter until s/he has given a definite response. 
If the participant changes a response (e.g., 'that was a "C" not an "O"') before s/he has read 
aloud the next letter, then the change must be  accepted. If the participant changes a response 
having read the next letter, then the change is not accepted. The examiner should never point to the chart or to specific letters on the chart during the test. 
A maximum effort should be made to identify each letter on the chart. When the participant 
says s/he cannot read a letter, s/he should be en couraged to guess. If the participant identifies 
a letter as one of two letters, s/he should be asked to choose one letter and, if necessary, to 
guess. When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be made, despi[INVESTIGATOR_537985], the examiner should stop the test for that eye. However, all 
letters on the last line should be attempted as letter difficulties vary and the last may be the 
only one read correctly. The number of letters missed or read incorrectly should be noted. 
OC-02 Nasal Spray Sponsor: Oyster Point Pharma, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol #OPP-[ADDRESS_742657] line in which a letter is read correctly will be taken as the base logMAR reading. To 
this value will be added the number "N x 0.02" where 'N' represents the total number of 
letters missed up to and including the last line read. This total sum represents the logMAR visual acuity for that eye. 
Example: Participant correctly reads 4 of 5 le tters on the 0.2 line, and 2 of 5 letters on the 0.1 
line. 
Base logMAR  = 0.1  
N (total number of letters incorrect on line 0.2 as well as 0.1)  = 4 
N x T (T=0.02)  = 0.08  
Base logMAR + (N x T)  = 0.1 + 0.08 
logMAR visual acuity = 0.[ADDRESS_742658] be consistently done using the same 
lighting conditions and same correction if possible during the entire study. If the same 
correction cannot be used (i.e., a participant br oke his/her glasses), the reason for the change 
in correction should be documented. 
Note: A clinically significant visual acuity decr ease (defined as an increase of 0.22 or greater 
in logMAR score) from the Screening Visit (Visit 1) should be evaluated by [CONTACT_162633] a potential AE.

inferior conjunctival cul-de-sac of each eye. Alternatively, corneal st aining can be assessed 
using 1.[ADDRESS_742660] two minutes after instillation before evaluating corneal 
fluorescein staining. A Wratten #12 yellow filter w ill be used to enhance the ability to grade 
fluorescein staining. The staining will be graded with the NEI Scale. The upper eyelid is lifted slightly to grade th e entire corneal surface.

Clinical Trial Protocol #OPP-[ADDRESS_742661] unde rgo an intranasal exam to make the final 
eligibility determination (e.g. severe nasal air way obstruction such as, severe septal deviation 
or inferior turbinate hypertrophy, or vascularized polyp seen on examination are reasons for 
exclusion).  To monitor nasal mucosal integrity during the study for participant safety, an examination of the nasal cavities via an intran asal exam will be performed at the Screening 
Visit(after all other screening procedures have  been completed) and at Visit 5 or the Early 
Termination Visit.  This examination will be  performed by [CONTACT_201983] (ENT) 
specialist, otolaryngologist or other suitably qu alified medical practitioner (i.e. one who has 
been trained to perform intranasal exam).  Still images or video may be captured.  The procedure used for the intranasal exam can be conducted either by [CONTACT_183197].

 Schirmer’s Test with Topi[INVESTIGATOR_494158], one basal Schirmer’s  test will be performed followed by a Schirmer’s  
test with cotton swab nasal stimulation. The Schirmer’s  test with topi[INVESTIGATOR_494159]:   
1. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_494160] 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride or equivalent should 
be instilled in both eyes of the participant. 
2. The participant will be instructed to keep the eyes gently closed for one minute.   
3. After opening the eyes and allowing the eyes  to recover for approximately one additional 
minute, excess moisture in the inferior fornix is gently removed with a spear. 
4. Schirmer’s  strips (35 mm x 5 mm size filter paper strip) will be placed in each eye at the 
junction of the middle and lateral thirds of the lower eye lid.  
5. Under ambient light, the participant will be instructed to look forward and to blink normally during the course of the test. The test should be performed in a room with no direct air on the participant’s face.  
6. The Schirmer’s  strips should remain in place until five minutes have elapsed or both 
strips have reached maximum score. 
7. After five minutes, strips will  be removed from both eyes and the amount of wetting will 
be recorded. The strips should be taped to the CRF.   
Schirmer’s test using cotton swab nasal stimulation   
At the Screening Visit, the Schirmer’s  test should be performed using cotton swab nasal 
stimulation. New anesthetic drops should be inst illed following the same procedure specified 
in steps #[ADDRESS_742662], the examiner should insert cotton swabs in the participant’s two 
nostrils simultaneously and gently probe both nasal middle turbinates for approximately 
[ADDRESS_742663] properly.  
3. The Schirmer’s  strips should remain in place until five minutes have elapsed or both 
strips have reached maximum score. 
Both Schirmer’s  scores will be recorded and verified that they meet the inclusion criteria.

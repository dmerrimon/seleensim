1.0  GOALS AND OBJECTIVES  
To study the efficacy of the combination of reduced dose craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25332] ( reduced from 
standard of care dosing at 36 Gy to 24 Gy) with concurrent carboplatin and vincristine administration 
for metastatic classical h istology medulloblastomas  and high-risk supratentorial PNETs and metastatic 
PNETs . 
2.[ADDRESS_24272] atin administration during radiation  with weekly vincristine  for 
metastatic  medulloblastomas  and high-risk supratentorial PNETs and metastatic PNETs.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_25333]’s Oncology Group (COG)  study [ZIP_CODE] show excellent results with daily carboplatin 
infusion during radiation for high risk central nervous system tumors (Jakacki et al , 2006).  This study 
had an 89% 3 year event free survival for classical histology metastatic medulloblastoma.  Anaplastic medulloblastomas did poorly and will be excluded from the current study.   
Although the COG [ZIP_CODE] study had excellent event free survival, 36 Gy radiation dose to the 
craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25334].  This dosage is known to be associated with extremely poor quality of life as an adult  (Ribi et al, 2005, Packer et al, 1994).  The improvement of survival of COG [ZIP_CODE] over all 
prior studies appears to be due to the addition of carboplatin during radiation.  The current study proposes to see if the addition of carboplatin during radiation allows for lowering the craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25335] 23.4 Gy, a dose which is known to be associated with a satisfactory quality of life for adult survivors (Ribi et al, 2005, Packer et al, 1994). 
In order to assess efficacy we would accept equivalency in terms of 90% event fr ee survival from 
progression at 3 years .  We will re -assess the therapy after every 10 patients completes the study .  One

3.0  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
PNET is a class of brain tumors that consists of medulloblastomas (in the cerebellum) and 
supratentorial PNETs. These are two subgroups of the same t umor type that have the same risk profile. 
They tend to metastasize through the cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_25336].    PNETs are classified by [CONTACT_25389] (highly malignant)  (Kleihues & Cavenee, 2000).  
PNETs occur most commonly in children aged [ADDRESS_24274] metastatic disease at diagnosis (Kleihues & Cavenee, 2000).  
Disseminated disease has been found to be an adverse prognostic factor (Packer  et al, 1994; Boyett et 
al, 1995).  Other poor prognostic factors include primary tumors that are not cerebellar or pi[INVESTIGATOR_25337]; age less than 3 years; and significant post-operative residual tumor (Cohen et al, 1995; Jenkin et al, 1990).  Adding chemotherapy to radiation is proposed to enhance the response on tumor burden (Steel, 1979).   This increased response may occur because of increased cell death, decrease in radiation -
induced damage repair, and prevention of tumor cell rebound growth in response to radi ation therapy 
(Wilkins et al, 1993).  Cells may also be induced out of the resting phase and become more chemo and radio -sensitive.  It is also postulated to eliminate systemic micrometastases concurrently to the primary 
tumor.    It is known that platinum s can potentiate the efficacy of radiation (Douple & Richmond, 1978).  
Platinums radiosenstize hypoxic cells and possibly keep tumor cells in the radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle (Skov & MacPhail, 1991; Douple et al, 1985).  Inhibition of “sublethal damage repair” and “potentially lethal damage recovery” is caused by [CONTACT_25390] (Fu & 
Protocol Version 8/7/2014  Page 6 of 44                Phillips, 1991).  This has been demonstrated by [CONTACT_25391] a brain tumor cell line (Wilkins et al, 
1993).  In addition, chromosomal abe rrations may be increased (Schwachoffer et al, 1991).  
   Frequent low-dose carboplatin administration has been shown to be surprisingly effective in several pediatric brain tumors. This sensitivity to low -dose carboplatin is currently unexplainable by 
[CONTACT_25392] (Mastangelo et al, 1995; Gaynon et al, 1990). Seven of 15 patients with recurrent 
PNET treated with w eekly doses of carboplatin showed response to treatment (Allen et al, 1987).  The 
majority of patients received 175 mg/m
2/week.  Only low tis sue levels of carboplatin are necessary to 
be radiosensitizing because the unbound drug has a half-life of 6 hours (Albers & Mason-Liddil, 1989).  Therefore, the recent national cooperative group study chose to use 35 mg/m
2/day to establish 
sufficient radi osensitizing levels (Jakacki et al, 2006). 
  Daily administration of platinum during fractionated radiotherapy has shown positive results in solid tumors (Bartelink et al, 1986; Schaake-Konig et al, 1992; Jakacki et al, 2006).  Concurrent chemotherapy and radiation with lower continuous dosing appears to have more effect on tumor cells 
than normal tissue with reduction of acute and late toxicities (Schaake-Konig et al, 1992; Steel, 1988; Jeremic et al, 1995; Jeremic et al, 1996).  A trial of concurrent cisplatin and radiotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer improved survival and local disease control compared to radiation alone (Schaake-Konig, 1992).  Weekly cisplatin with radiation showed no significant difference.  Esophagitis was not increased, but nausea and vomiting occurred in most patients.   Head and neck cancer patients on a Phase I/II study of concurrent carboplatin and radiation had significantly improved survival rates than historical data with sequential chemoradiotherapy (Volling et al, 1992).  Glioblastoma multiforme patients were treated with Carboplatin (33mg/m
2) daily for five days 
during the first and fourth week of radiation therapy.  Toxicity included Grade III and IV neutropenia in 25% of the patients and thrombocytopenia in 10% of patients.  Neurotoxicity from radiation necrosis was not higher than in patients with radiation alone (Levin et al, 1995).  Ausili- Cefari et al , gave 
Protocol Version 8/7/2014  Page 7 of 44                continuous infusion Carboplatin at a dose of 30 mg/m2/day for either 14 or 21 days during radiation 
therapy to head and neck cancer patients.  Only the patients who had carboplatin for 21 days had 
leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.  There were no serious infections.  Six of twelve patients developed mucositis, none requiring interruption of treatment (A usili-Cefaro et al, 1995).  A Phase I study of bi-
weekly Carboplatin during radiation therapy for children with brain stem gliomas showed a mean tolerated dose of 280 mg/m
2/week for seven weeks (Allen et al, 1995).  
 Craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25338], but it has also been implicated in poor quality of life related to impaired cognitive functioning that worsens over time (Packer, 1989).  Radcliffe et al showed that whole-brain radiotherapy decreases IQ.  Age is inve rsely 
correlated with loss of IQ.  Children younger than 7 at diagnosis showed a significant loss of IQ points (Radcliffe et al, 1992).   
Ribi, et al , (Ribi et al, 2005) followed [ADDRESS_24275] 
of 48.0-55.0 Gy irradiation to the tumor bed.  Significant deficits in neurocognitive functioning were seen in all of the patients.  They had concurrent endocrine deficits (61%), neurological complications (72%), and significant school problems (72%)  
Reduced dose craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25339].   
Mulhern et al demonstrated, in 22 children with medulloblastoma, that less severe neuropsychologic injury occurred when treated with only 23.4 Gy instead of 36 Gy craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25332].  Once again, age was correlated with toxicity , with older children experiencing  fewer cognitive deficits than 
younger children (Mulhern et al, 1998). 
Goldwein , et al , treated 10 children diagnosed with medulloblastoma between 18 and 60 
months of age with reduced craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25332] .  The patients received reduced dose craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25340] 8/7/[ADDRESS_24276] maintenance chemotherapy.  Survival at over 
6 years was 70%, which is the accepted national survival rate for medulloblastoma with [ADDRESS_24277] decreased growth rates (Goldwein et al, 1996).  
We therefore propose extending the benefits of reduced dose craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25341]-risk, non- metastatic supratentorial PNET patients , and 
metastatic PNET patients  by [CONTACT_25393].  Data 
regarding neuropsychologic outcome in children treated for non- metastatic medulloblastoma, with 36 
Gy craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25332], and the same maintenance chemotherapy (Packer  et al, 2006) is available, 
and will serve as a control group to assess the benefit of a reduced radiation dose.

4.[ADDRESS_24278] Enrollment   
 Approximately 10 subjects will be enrolled locally at Children’s Hospit al Colorado.  Eligible subjects 
will be offered  participation in the study by [CONTACT_25395]-Oncology 
Program at Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20161].  The subjects may be inpatients or outpatients. 
4.3 Informed Consent Procedure 
 
The in vestigator (or designee) will obtain written informed consent/assent from each subject or their 
authorized representative who participates in the study, before the initiation of any study procedures. 
All physicians, nurses, and study coordinators who are involved with the study and may perform any or all parts of the consent process have been educated in research principles and certified by [CONTACT_25396](s). The consent/assent will be explained in an environment that is private, quiet, and conducive to effective communication.  Explanation will be given at the level of comprehension of the consentee.  A dialogue between the subject and/or parent and the investigator will confirm the understanding and agreement to participate.   
Non-English Speaking Subjects  
 
This study will follow the COMIRB guidelines regarding Non -English speaking subjects, per the 
following from the COMIRB Instructions for Clinical Investigators:  
45 CFR 46.117 (b)(2) permits oral presentation of informed consent in conjunction with a short form 
stating that the elements of informed consent have been presented orally, for studies that will include non-English speaking subjects but not purposely recruit them. A study is permitted to utilize the short 
Protocol Version 8/7/[ADDRESS_24279] expertise (native language or evidence of fluency) in the language including medical and legal terminology, in order to translate consent forms.  When the translated consent form is used with a subject, the person obtaining consent and the subject or their representative will sign the non-English consent form. 
A translator fluent in the subject’s language and English must read the consent summary to the subject 
or their representative.  A written summary of what is presented orally is also required.  A witness to the oral presentation is required, and the translator can also serve in this role.  The subject or their representative and the witness (translator) mus t sign the Short Form.  The person obtaining consent as 
authorized under the protocol and the witness (translator) must sign the Consent Summary.  The subject must be given copi[INVESTIGATOR_25343].  The investigator must h ave a plan for how to answer the subject’s questions and assess comprehension in the subjects’ 
native language.  The subject or his/her representative walks away with:  (1) the short form written consent in the subject’s language; (2) the long standard consent in English; (3) a copy of the summary of the oral presentation. 
Forms required for oral presentation of consent: 
• Short Form.  This must state that the elements  of consent have been presented orally to the 
subject and it must be in the language the subject is fluent in.  A template of the Short Form 
is available in a variety of languages on the COMIRB web site under Forms.  The subject or their representative and the witness, who in most cases is the translator, must sign this form.  Consent Summary.  The COMIRB approved English language consent form can serve as 
Protocol Version 8/7/2014  Page 11 of 44                the consent summary.  The person obtaining consent and the witness (translator) should 
sign this.  
Health outcomes on all subjects will be studied, but only an English- speaking subset will be mea sured 
for neuropsychologic outcomes due to the limitations of the testing measures used in this study in order to compare to the control group. 
4.4 Confidentiality  
 
The clinical and laboratory data for each patient are part of their medical records at Chil dren’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20161]. Laboratory data are computerized at CHCO  and accessible to authorized staff that 
have a laboratory password.  Patient data will also be entered into Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25344] -
Oncology Program database. This information will be used by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_25345]. The database is a secure, password -protected database. Completed data forms for each patient on study 
at Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25346], accessible only to study team members . The clinical research associates will monitor the level of authorization/consent signed by [CONTACT_25397] f or release of all data that are released.   
4.[ADDRESS_24280] protected health information from the subjects.  The principal investigator (s) or qualified 
designee will explain the HIPAA regulations in the combined consent/HIPAA authorization form. The clinical research associates will assure that the consent/HIPAA authorization form has been properly signed and dated prior to study entry, a nd that the subject/parent receives a copy of the signed and 
dated form.  The p rogram database will contain the date the consent/HIPAA authorization form was 
signed. Information will be released only to those specified in the consent/HIPAA authorization form.  
 
Protocol Version 8/7/[ADDRESS_24281].  Daily carboplatin will be given at 35 mg/m2 IV over 15-20 
minutes Monday through Friday, approximately 1-4 hours prior to radiation for 6 weeks (total of 30 
doses).  Weekly Vincristine will be given at 1.5 mg/m2 (standard therapy) for [ADDRESS_24282] the national 
cooperative group’s evidence- based standard of care.  Subjects will be followed during m aintenance, 
but no research testing will be conducted during this standard of care chemotherapy.  The first dose of 
carboplatin should be administered on the first day of radiation therapy, unless the patient needs emergent treatment , in which case carboplatin may be administered prior to the first day of radiation 
therapy. Carboplatin will be administered in 25 ml NS IV over 15 minutes approximately 1-4 hours 
prior to radiation therapy.  This should be sufficient time for patients who may require sedation or who travel to another facility.   
If a radiation treatment is  not given, carboplatin should be held as well.  If a dose of carboplatin 
is given and radiation therapy is NOT administered due to sedation or technical issues, the carboplatin dose should not be made up  at the end of radiation (i.e. no more than 30 doses of carboplatin should be 
given).  Since there are [ADDRESS_24283] use effective birth control while on this study.  
Protocol Version 8/7/[ADDRESS_24284] be reported to COMIRB as an unanticipated problem with the required documents and the study will be re- reviewed at that time.   
5.2  Supportive Care During Chemoradiotherapy  
5.21  G-CSF During Radiotherapy 
CBCs will be obtained weekly.  If ANC is less than or equal to 500/microliter, G -CSF will be 
administe red 5 mcg/kg/day subcutaneously or IV until ANC is greater than 500.  In the event of 
potentially life -threatening infection with neutropenia, G-CSF may be increased to 5 mcg/kg/dose 
twice daily .  
Significant myelosuppression may  occur, particularly during the last two -three weeks of 
radiation , although this  has been relatively infrequent .  However, radiation should not be withheld for 
myelosuppression alone.  Radiation should be continued even if the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25347].  Administration of the boost should not be substituted for craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25348]. 
5.22  Platelets  
Platelets should be transfused as clinically indicated, and in all patients with counts <10,000/microliter.  
5.23  Red Blood Cells 
Patients should be transfused as necessary to maintain a hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8. 
5.24  Pneumocystis Prophylaxis 
Pneumocystis prophylaxis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (5 mg/kg/day of trimethoprim in two divided doses given 2 consecutive days per week) is recommended for all patients during chemoradiotherapy, and should be continued during the maintenance chemotherapy.  Pentamidine (4 mg/kg every 3 weeks) is recommended for patients who are allergic to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.  
 
Protocol Version 8/7/2014  Page 14 of 44                5.25  Nutrition  
Patients are to be weighed weekly.  If there is greater than 10% weight loss, megestrol (megace) at 10 
mg/kg in two divided doses or nutritional support, either enterally or parenterally, should be considered.  
5.26  Fungal Prophylaxis 
Patients on this protocol are likely to develop mucositis and esophagitis and will be more susceptible to oral and esophageal candidiasis.  In the event of candidiasis, Fluconazole (3 mg/kg/day) is recommended.  
5.27  Emesis  
Although carboplatin at these doses is unlikely to cause nausea and/or vomiting, patients may experience nausea and/or vomiting during the first few craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25349].  Prophylactic anti-emetic therapy with either Ondansetron or Granisetron should be used, at least during the first 
week.  
5.28  Maintenance chemotherapy  
Maintenance chemotherapy will commence six weeks after radiation has been completed, or when  
ANC > 1000/ µL and platelets >100,000/ µL, whichever occurs last.   
5.[ADDRESS_24285] 2-3 weeks of radiation therapy.  See 
sections 5.21-5.23.  No dose modifications of Carboplatin or radiation therapy  will be made.

6.2  Pre -Study  Examination:  
• A full clinical examination with particular detail to neurological deficits must be carried out at 
diagnosis. A formal neurological examination should be performed on entrance to study.  It is imperative that neurological deterioration on therapy be adequately documented. 
Protocol Version 8/7/2014  Page 16 of 44                • Imaging: An MRI 3 -dimensional assessment of head (with and without contrast) and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (with 
contrast)  at diagnosis. 
• CSF involvement is defined as presence of tumor cells in the lumbar CSF.  Lumbar punctur e will 
be obtained > 7 days after surgery at diagnosis.  CSF should be obtained > [ADDRESS_24289]- operatively 
for posterior fossa tumors to minimize the risk of false positive results that do not represent true, 
viable metastases.  Tumor cells in the cisternal  CSF are not considered prognostic and may not be 
considered in the definition of CSF involvement. 
• Hematology/biochemistry  (CBC with differential and platelet count ; Chemistry  panel  - 
Electrolytes, c alcium, creatinine, BUN, SGOT, bilirubin,).  
• A baseline au diogram will be obtained. 
6.3 Evaluation During Treatment  
• A physical exam, including a formal neurological exam  (see Appendix 1) and height, weight,  and 
performance status (see Appendix 2) will be performed weekly during chemoradiotherapy. 
Hematology:  Reg ular CBCs  with differential and platelet count will be performed week ly during 
chemoradiotherapy.  If the ANC falls below 1000, CBC should be checked every 3 -5 days . In the 
event of potentially life -threatening infection with neutropenia, G- CSF may be increased to 5  
mcg/kg/dose twice daily.  
• Audiogram: Will be repeated 4 -6 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy. 
• Chemistry (Electrolytes, calcium, creatinine, BUN, SGOT, and bilirubin) will be performed every other week during weeks 1-9.   
• Imaging: A MRI scan of the head  (with and without contrast) and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (with contrast)  should be 
performed  at 4-6 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy.  
• CSF involvement at diagnosis:  A lumbar puncture will be repeated 4 -6 weeks after the completion 
of chem oradiotherapy. 
Protocol Version 8/7/2014  Page 17 of 44                • Neuropsychologic testing will be performed 3-6 months after radiation is completed (see Appendix 
3). 
6.4 Evaluation Following Protocol Therapy 
Starting from the end of radiation therapy until 5 years after the end of radiation therapy, physical exam (as described above), CBCs  and blood chemistry (if clinically indicated) , MRIs of the head and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], lumbar punctures, audiograms, neuropsychologic testing and thyroid function tests will be performed according to the intervals in the table in section 6.5.

7.[ADDRESS_24292] be used to measure 
tumor status after treatment.  Therefore, only MRI scans will be used to determine response or progression of disease. 
• Complete Response (CR):  Complete resolution of tumor on MRI scan 
• Partial Response (PR) :  A reduction of at least 50% in tumor area of bidimensional measurable 
lesions.  In addition, there can be no appearance of new lesions or progression of any lesion.  
• Stable Disease (SD) :   A decrease of   less than 50 %   or an increase of less than 25% in the tumor 
area of bidimensional measurable lesions . 
• Progressive Disease:  Greater than a 25% increase in the bidimensional tumor  area  compared to 
the immediate pre -study area or compared to area of best prior response at that site, or the 
reappearance of tumor in sites of involvement which had responded completely to therapy (including surgery), or appearance of tumor in a previou sly uninvolved area.  
 
Protocol Version 8/7/2014  Page 21 of 44                9.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM PROTOCOL THERAPY, FOLLOW -UP, AND  
OFF STUDY CRITERIA 
 
9.1  Criteria for Removal f rom Protocol Therapy  
Patients may be removed from protocol therapy prior to completion under the following 
circumstances:  
a) Disease relapse/progression (see Section 8.0) b) Parent/patient request  
c) Death  
d) Physician or investigator’s discretion  
Discontinuation for other reasons will be considered protocol deviations.  
9.2  Removal from Protocol Follow- up 
Patients may be removed  from protocol specified follow-up under the following circumstances: 
a) Death  
b) Parent/patient request  
c) Entry onto a sanctioned second line therapeutic study or follow-up study. 
 
10.[ADDRESS_24293] -op MRI is strongly 
encouraged, but not mandatory. 
Postoperative MRI should be done within 72 hours of surgery, when there is less edema or 
postoperative enhancement, which can make measurements of residual tumor difficult.  An MRI with 
Protocol Version 8/7/[ADDRESS_24294] -operative Spi[INVESTIGATOR_25357] (through the inferior extent of the 
thecal  sac) is required either [ADDRESS_24295] ex amination is  necessary. 
Note: a pre -operative MRI scan of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_25358] -induced inflammation/blood can be difficult to  distinguish from 
tumor.   
 
11.[ADDRESS_24296]- operative MRI scan (o btained within 72 hours of the operation) reveals residual 
resectable tumor, a second operation should be considered to remove the remaining tumor. Few, if any, patients should be entered into this study with biopsy only or partial resections. 
Protocol Version 8/7/2014  Page 23 of 44                Biopsy alone , with no attempt at resection, may be associated with a statistically worse survival 
and should not be done except in the setting of widely metastatic disease and a small primary tumor. 
No patient will be entered without a diagnosis established by [CONTACT_25398].  
11.2  Staging Criteria  
 
11.21  Extent of Resection/Surgical Confirmation  
a) Biopsy Only: If tumor removal is less than 10% of the total tumor mass, this will be  considered a 
biopsy only. 
b) Partial Resection: The surgical removal of greater than 10%, but less than 50%, of the tumor mass.  
c) Sub -total Resection: The surgical removal of greater than 50%, but less than 95%, of the tumor 
mass.  
d) Radical Subtotal Resection (Near Total): The surgical removal of greater than 95%, but less than 100% of the tumor mass. e) "Gross Total" Resection: No visible tumor is left at the time of surgery and  is confirmed by 
[CONTACT_25399]. 
11.22  Metastasis Stage (M0 -M4) 
The surgeon should inspect the regional leptomeninges and a decision should be made as to whether metastatic nodules are present in the arachnoid or whether the entire leptomeningeal surface is infiltrated with tumor. If there is any question, a small segment of arachnoid should be excised and sent as a separate specimen.  
11.[ADDRESS_24297]. This scan should be carried out within 72 hours postoperatively.  Bidimensional measurements of residual tumor volume should be obtained. For  
Protocol Version 8/7/[ADDRESS_24298]-op MRI is strongly encouraged, but not mandatory.   
11.3  Peri-operative Corticosteroids  
Some patients with large tumors may require corticosteroid therapy preoperatively to reduce associated 
cerebral edema.   
a) Usual corticosteroid dosage is 0.25 to 1 mg/kg/day of dexamethasone, in divided doses, every 4 -6 
hours. 
b) Corticosteroids may be continued during the peri-operative period, but the dosage, dose interval and duration of steroid therapy must be noted, and every attempt made to taper and discontinue  corticosteroid therapy as soon as clinically feasible.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_24299] in saline (wrapped towel) prior to fixation in formalin for histologic diagnosis.  
11.5  Shunts  
a) Children may need preoperative external ventricular drains, if they are symptomatic because of 
tumor-induced hydrocephalus. 
b) After removal of the tumor and the external drains, approximately 30% of patients with medulloblastoma/PNET will require a CSF shu nt because of permanent  hydrocephalus. 
c) The routine use of pre-operative shunts or shunt filters is not encouraged. 
 
12.[ADDRESS_24300] for this tumor. 
Protocol Version 8/7/2014  Page 25 of 44                ATTENTION:  The radiotherapy guidelines for this protocol do not allow for treatment breaks except 
in the setting of clinical instability.    
12.1  Timing of Radiation Therapy 
All patients shall receive irradiation to the cranio -spi[INVESTIGATOR_25359] (CSA) followed by a boost to the primary 
tumor site (posterior fossa or supratentorial) as well as to CNS metastatic sites.  All patients shall begin 
radiation treatments after registration on study and within 3 5 days of definitive surgery. 
12.2  Equipment  
12.21  Modality 
Photon irradiation shall be used. 
12.22  Energy  
The cranial field should be treated with megavoltage photons with energies in the range of 4 – [ADDRESS_24301] a minimum source - to- 
axis distance (SAD) of [ADDRESS_24302] be simulated on a dedicated radiation therapy simulator.  
12.25  Immobilization Devices  
For craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25360], immobilization devices such as head holders or custom mold are required . 
Head immobilization with a thermoplastic mask or head frame is  required when 3D treatment planning 
is used. The immobilization device should limit daily  motion to a maximum of ± 3 – 5mm.  
Protocol Version 8/7/2014  Page 26 of 44                12.3  Treatment Volume Anatomical Description  
12.31  Treatment Volumes  
 
Definitions: 
• Gross Target  Volumes (GTV): The Gross Target Volume (GTV) is based upon the T1 weighted MRI 
with and without Gadolinium contrast.  Identification of the GTV shall be based upon pre-operative extent and anatomic shifts or changes after surgery. The GTV should include any residual enhancing tumor mass and the wall of the resectio n cavity.  
• Clinical Target Volume (CTV): The Clinical Target Volume (CTV) is defined as the GTV plus a 1.5 -
cm margin  • Planning Target Volumes (PTV): The Planning Target Volume (PTV) margin should be an additional 0.[ADDRESS_24303] 95% of the prescribed study dose (55.8 Gy) must encompass at least 95% of the PTV as shown by [CONTACT_25400].  No part of the PTV should receive less than 50 Gy.  
• Treated Volume (TV): The volume enclosed by [CONTACT_25401]. 
12.32  Treatment Volume  
The target volume for the initial portion of the treatment is the entire cranio -spi[INVESTIGATOR_25359] (the  entire 
subarachnoid space). The target volume for the boost is the tumor bed and the residual tumor if the  
primary site is in the infratentorial region of the brain. The target volume for th e boost for 
supratentorial tumors is [ADDRESS_24304] portion of the treatment.  
12.33  Cranio -Spi[INVESTIGATOR_25361] 8/7/[ADDRESS_24305] and thecal sac. The whole 
brain treatment volume should extend anteriorly to include the entire frontal lobe and cribriform plate 
region. The superior orbital tissue (but not the posterior globe) should be included in the volume. The treatment volume should extend at least 0.[ADDRESS_24306] as low as the inferior  border of the S2 and may extend to S4. A "spade" field may be 
required to obtain a 1.[ADDRESS_24307].  3D- based treatmen t 
planning is mandatory for these volumes.  The Gross Target Volume (GTV) is based upon the T1 weighted MRI with and without Gadolinium contrast.  Identification of the GTV shall be based upon pre-operative extent and anatomic shifts or changes after surgery. The GTV should include any 
residual enhancing tumor mass and the wall of the resection cavity. The Clinical Target Volume (CTV) is defined as the GTV plus a 1.5- cm margin except at bone or tentorial interface (where it remains 
within the confines of the posterior fossa). The Planning Target Volume (PTV) margin should be an additional 0.[ADDRESS_24308] 95% of the prescribed study dose (55.8 Gy) must encompass at least 95% of the PTV as shown by [CONTACT_25400]. No part of the PTV should receive less than 50 Gy.   
Protocol Version 8/7/[ADDRESS_24309] set up to treat metastatic disease (M2) should meet the same guidelines as that for a boost for a primary supratentorial tumor.  
12.[ADDRESS_24310](s) 
For patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_25362], focal boosts to the pre-chemotherapy volume with 1cm margin (target volume) will be employed.  
12.4  Three Dimensional Treatment Planning  
Three dimensional (3D) treatment planning will be used for the whole brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_25363].   
12.41  Planning System Requirements  
Any volume based treatment system e.g.,  conformal radiation treatments (co -planar or non- coplanar),  
stereotactic radiotherapy, intensity modulated radiotherapy, and proton therapy, is allowable if it satisfies the following criteria . Brachytherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery are not allowable.  
12.[ADDRESS_24311] C3.  
  
Protocol Version 8/7/2014  Page 29 of 44                12.43  Normal Tissue Volumes  
The following normal tissue will be defined on the treatment planning scan, and dose-volume 
histogram data will be  reviewed for these structures:   
1) L, R Cochlear and vestibular apparatus bilat erally  
2) Supratentorial brain 3) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_304]  
4) L, R Optic nerves and chiasm 
12.44  Dose Prescription  
The radiation dose will be calculated and normalized to the isocenter of the beams used for treatment. The 95% isodose surface will be required to completely encompass the PTV.  
12.[ADDRESS_24312] between the lateral entrance points (midplane). If an independent jaw or  half-beam block 
technique is used, the dose should be specified at an off-axis point that corresponds to the midplane point used for a conventional "opposed lateral" treatment set-up. 12.522 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_25364] 8/7/[ADDRESS_24313] volume occupi[INVESTIGATOR_25365] 2/[ADDRESS_24314].  Patients with M2 disease (intracranial 
subarachnoid disease) will receive boosts of 32.[ADDRESS_24315] to the supratentorial compartment exceeds 2/3 of the 
Protocol Version 8/7/[ADDRESS_24316] volumes for M2 disease will be the same as specified for boosts to the pri mary tumor .  Patients with M3 disease (spi[INVESTIGATOR_25366]) are subdivided into those with diffuse disease and those with focal disease. Diffuse spi[INVESTIGATOR_25367] 3 ou t of 4 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_25368] (i.e., cervical, thoracic, lumbar or sacral).  
 If there is diffuse involvement of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], the entire spi[INVESTIGATOR_25369] 23.[ADDRESS_24317] from whole brain treatment should not be made. 12.542 Fractionation All radiation fields should be treated once each day and treatments should be given 5 days per week.  
12.543 Unplanned Treatment Breaks Interruption or disc ontinuation of radiation will be permitted ONLY for:  
Protocol Version 8/7/2014  Page 32 of 44                1) Severe medical conditions precluding delivery of radiation. This does not include straightforward 
fever and neutropenia admissions (i.e. radiation therapy and carboplatin should continue to be adminis tered without interruption). If radiation cannot be resumed within two weeks of 
discontinuation, the study chair should be informed and the patient will be off study.  2) Hematologic toxicity alone should NOT result in unplanned treatment breaks.  Only whe n the patient is clinically unstable, should radiation therapy be held. 
ONCE CRANIOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_25370], IT IS TO BE COMPLETED  
WITHOUT INTERRUPTION (I.E. BOOST RADIATION SHOULD NOT BE  
ADMINISTERED INSTEAD OF CRANIOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_25371]).   
12.[ADDRESS_24318], a dose homogeneity of +5% relative to the prescription point is required. A correction for the higher contribution of dose to the PF and upper cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_25372]. In no instance will homogeneity exceeding 10% in the central plane be acceptable.  
12.[ADDRESS_24319] should be +5%. Tissue compensations may be required to achieve this degree of dose uniformity. The dose to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_25373] T2 and L3 should be recorded as off-axis points. 12.553 Uniformity Reference Points: The reference point fo r the posterior fossa due to the whole brain radiation will be the midplane of the 
skull at a point that will be along the central axis of the lateral posterior fossa boost points.  The 
posterior margin of the vertebral body representing the anterior margin of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_25374] 8/7/[ADDRESS_24320]. 
12.6  Treatment Technique 
12.61  Patient Position  
For cranio -spi[INVESTIGATOR_25375]. The neck should be extended 
sufficiently to keep the mandible out of the exit beam of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_25376]. Immobilization devices such as head holders or custom molds are required for 3D treatment plans. For boosting the posterior fossa or supratentorial sites, the  patient may be in either the prone or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. 
 
12.62  Whole Brain Irradiation 
Parallel -opposed fields may be used. Alternatively, the field center can be placed near the match  line 
with the spi[INVESTIGATOR_25377]-beam block technique utilized. This method decreases overlap at the match line. The collimation of the brain field should be rotated to match the divergence of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_25378]: 
Collimator angle = tan-1 (spi[INVESTIGATOR_25379]/2) 
    Source- to-axis dis tance  
 
The lateral fields may be angled posteriorly to spare the collateral lens, but, if this is done, great care must be taken to assure adequate coverage of the cribriform plate. Custom divergent blocking of at 
Protocol Version 8/7/[ADDRESS_24321] 
Preferably, the spi[INVESTIGATOR_25380] a single posterior field. An extended SSD is 
preferable to the use of adjacent ports. If adjacent ports are necessary, the 50% decrement should cross at the posterior margins of the vertebral body. It is preferable that the match line be  placed inferior to 
the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] (below L2) and should be moved every 900 cGy. Custom blocking may be required at the inferior border of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. An attempt should be made to avoid exit through the jaw and mouth from the spi[INVESTIGATOR_25381], if the curvature does not compromise dose  
homogeneit y. 
 
12.64  Abutting Fields  
With the use of collimator rotation and an independent jaw technique, the cranial and spi[INVESTIGATOR_25382] (light fields). Many radiation oncologists, though, are more comfortable with a gap between the cranial and spi[INVESTIGATOR_25383]. A gap of 0.5 cm is allowed on this protocol. The match line should be moved three times during treatment of the cranio-spi[INVESTIGATOR_25359]. Also, a penumbra broadening "match line wedge" or a dynamic wedge may be used. The match line should  never overlap the  
posterior fossa boost. Therefore, it is recommended that the first match line lie just above the shoulder, and the last [ADDRESS_24322] should be treated by a pair of opposed lateral fields. For patients with supratentorial primary sites, or patients planned with 3D techniques, any appropriate configuration of fields is allowable. 
Protocol Version 8/7/[ADDRESS_24323]. 
13.0  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_25384] (CARBO), vincristine (VCR), and radiation 
therapy (XRT) followed by [CONTACT_25402] (CP M) ± 
cisplatin (CDDP) in children aged 3 to 25 years with metastatic medulloblastoma, high risk PNET and 
metastatic PNET .  Eligible patients comprise  those with supratentorial PNET and infratentorial 
PNET/MB with initial stage M1 -M4 or >1.5cc  residual tumo r remaining after surgery  and classical 
histology. 
 The primary objective of the protocol a nd the statistical analysis is to obtain preliminary 
estimates of event  free survival (EFS) and to demonstrate less decrement in intellectual function in 
preparation  for a future Phase III randomized trial including these treatments.   
 Statistical considera tions for the primary objective are addressed below.  
 
13.1  Patient Accrual  
The Neuro -Oncology Program at Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25385] [ADDRESS_24324] to enroll 10 
Protocol Version 8/7/[ADDRESS_24325] of care CCG 9961 was based on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 10 patients  (Goldwein 
et al, 1996).  
13.2  Study Duration  
We original ly anticipate d that it would require approximately 24 months to complete accrual to this 
study.   However, at this time we are more accurately anticipating to complete enrollment by 2016.   
13.3  Study Endpoints  
13.31  Efficacy Endpoints 
Event -free survival :  Minimum time to disease progression or recurrence, time to death for 
any reason, or time to occurrence of a second malignant neoplasm (SMN).  
Overall Survival :  Time to death from any cause.  
Intellectual Competence:  Performance is as good as or better than patients treated on CCG 
9961 when adjusted for baseline performance 
13.33  Analysis of Efficacy  
If there are 1  or fewer deaths  from tumor progression, within 1 0 patients, with 3 years median 
follow up, then a presumption can be made that the reduction in radiation dose has not led to a decline in efficacy.  The information would then be supplied to the national group (Children’s Oncology Group) as a potential next national Phase III, randomized study.  
13.[ADDRESS_24326] formal analysis of this study will occur when median follow-up is approximately 18 months. The formal early monitoring of dose limiting toxicities and  any toxic death s will provide early warning of significant safety 
problems. 
Protocol Version 8/7/[ADDRESS_24327] a survival of approximately 90%, if there is one failure in ten patients, we 
will accept that as equivalent.  If there are [ADDRESS_24328] differences in outcome in groups defined by [CONTACT_25403]. Therapeutic outcomes will nevertheless be 
compared among gender and ethnicity  categories.  
14.0  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND TOXICITY CRITERIA 
14.1  Purpose  
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as par t of every clinical trial, 
are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies, as well as those who will enroll in  
future studies using similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a defined manner at scheduled  and 
emergent  times during a trial , based on occurrence and severity.   
14.2  Reporting Requirements  
  In this study a serious adverse event  (SAE ) includes death, life- threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25386], congenital anomaly/birth defects, and pe rsistent  and/or significant 
disability .   
Protocol Version 8/7/[ADDRESS_24329] the COMIRB.   
 Death due to disease will be reported if the death occurs within 30 days of the study treatment. 
All deaths that are possibly related  to the study treatment that occur more than 30 days after the 
treatment will be reported immediately. All other deaths that are due to disease ( and therefore 
expected) and unrelated to the treatment, will be reported at continuing review. 
 
14.3  Toxicity Criteria  
Any patient experiencing a non- hematologic, irreversible grade 3 toxicity or grade 4 toxicity should 
not receive further Carboplatin.  The site, measure and grade for all toxicities (Grade 3 and 4) will be 
according to the NCI Common  Terminology Criteria  v. 3.0 (CTCAE).  The CTCAE provides 
descriptive terminology and a grading scale for each adverse event listed. A copy of the CTCAE can be downloaded from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ( CTEP ) home page 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov)

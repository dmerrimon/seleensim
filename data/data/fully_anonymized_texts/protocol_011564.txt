Lay Summary of Proposed  Research 
Lay Summary of Proposed Research
      Psychological Mindedness  (PM) is viewed as the ability and  motivation to  achieve a psychological 
understanding of the self. A person is considered  to be  psychologically  minded  if she or he can access their 
feelings, is  willing  to try and understand oneself  and others, and  has an interest in the meaning and 
motivation of his  or her own  and others’  behavior.  Historically, interest in  PM grew out  of attempts  to 
identify patients best  suited for psychoanalytically  oriented psychotherapy. There has been limited attention 
regarding its potential impact on other therapeutic approaches. In recent years different  theorists  (Conte, 
Ratto, and  Karusa, 1996; Grant, 2001) have noted that PM may have particular relevance for cognitive  
behavioral therapy (CBT) because PM  includes self-monitoring and self-evaluation of one’s cognitions,  
emotions, and  behaviors which are central to the successful practice of CBT. This study aims to see if  PM is 
a component in the mechanism  of change that is activated in CBT treatment for depression. As such, it may 
be related to change of symptoms during CBT, and at post-treatment. Mindfulness is another  construct of 
self-awareness that is related to PM and yet distinct. We are studying  to see its role  in CBT for  depression,  
and its  relationship with PM. We  will be administrating a  few self-report  measures of PM that have been 
used in other studies. We will also begin validating  a structured interview of PM that we created in our 
lab. We also measure other  concepts  found to be  related  to PM and  mindfulness, rumination, alexithymia, 
and self-compassion. 
Our studies  and those of other researchers have  found  evidence  that pretreatment resting EEG, event-related  
brain potentials (ERPs), and performance on neurocognitive tests show  promise  of being predictors of 
subsequent clinical response  to antidepressants or CBT.  However, the  extent to  which these tests  predict 
response to specific treatments for depression  or the mechanisms underlying  successful response to CBT is  
not known. We propose to test depressed patients before they begin a  treatment  study as well as after 
treatment (pre-post design) to confirm the value  of resting EEG,  ERPs,  dichotic listening, and  
neuropsychological tests for predicting treatment  response in  MDD. Patients  will be randomized between [ADDRESS_249781] treatments for depression are  pharmacotherapy  and cognitive behavior  
therapy (CBT). Both  treatment modalities are similar in that they are only moderately  effective, with a  large  
proportion of patients  remaining symptomatic  after the initial intervention. Possibly the primary reason for 
the substantial individual  differences in treatment  responsiveness is  heterogeneity  within current psychiatric 
disease categories, which  are present  at all levels (i.e.genetic, neurobiological,  and psychological levels) 
(Hollon et al., 2006). In  the present  study, we measure the changes in  self-awareness and specific 
biomarkers through 12 weeks of CBT for depression and a  control condition of 12 weeks of 
psychoeducation for  depression. Psychological mindedness (PM), an aspect of self-awareness, has long  
been considered to be an  essential psychological mediator for therapy outcome. Through the history of  
clinical psychology, PM was mostly  used  intuitively by [CONTACT_209010], 
and more  specifically, in predicting  a patient’s ability and  motivation in psychotherapy (Farber & Golden, 
1977). However, most  definitions and measures of PM have approached the task from  a psychodynamic 
perspective, thus limiting the use  of this construct  by [CONTACT_209011]-based 
psychological perspectives, such as CBT (Grant 2001). Two measures presently being used in  studies, the 
Psychological Mindedness  Scale (PMS) (Conte, Ratto, &  Karasu  1996), and  the more recent  measure,  
Balanced Index  of Psychological Mindedness (BIPM) (Nyklíček &  Denollet,  2009), have shown some 
predictive value in different  studies of treatment  in mentally ill patients.  They have not though  been 
thoroughly investigated as  predictors  in evidence-based psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_208983]. A 
third measure, the  Self-Reflection Index Scale (SRIS; Grant, Franklin, &  Langfirm) is an  evolved form of 
the Private Self- Consciousness Scale  (PrSCS;  Fenigstein, Scheier, &  Buss, 1975) which is another  method  
to assess PM, and also recommended  in RDoC  as a measure of self- knowledge. SRIS is compromised of 
two separate factors labeled Self-Reflection (SRIS-SR) and Insight  (SRIS-IN) which are parts of self-  
awareness but differently correlate with depression:  in studies,  the SRIS-SR  correlated positively with 
anxiety and stress, but  not with depression  and alexithymia.  The SRISIN was negatively correlated with  
depression, anxiety, stress, and alexithymia, and positively correlated with cognitive flexibility and  self-

regulation (Grant at  el. 2002). In addition to PM we examine other  concepts  that relate to  self-awareness so 
to capture  the whole spectrum  of one's ability and will to  observe oneself. Mindfulness has been found  to 
relate to  the construct of PM in a nonclinical sample (Beitel, Ferrer, & Cecero, 2005), yet no study has 
examined its relationship with PM in a clinical sample despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a  growing body of research  supporting  the 
role of mindfulness in facilitating clinical improvement in CBT. We measure facets of  mindfulness that  are 
particularly relevant to PM  and examine  their  interactions and relative contribution  to predicting  CBT  
outcomes in depressed patients. We  added  a rumination measure because it is a core process in the 
development and maintenance of depression.  Consistent  with research indicating  a distinction  between 
rumination as a  maladaptive form of  self-attentiveness, and reflection  as an adaptive intellectual form  of 
self-attentiveness thought to underlie PM (Trapnell &  Campbell,  1999), we examine the added  value  of the 
level of rumination in predicting  CBT  outcome and its longitudinal relationship with  PM through the CBT. 
Another important  construct that has  been lately related to different forms of self-awareness and self-
observation is self-compassion (Neff, 2003). This is a third construct that  may  be important for 
understanding the  proposed relationship  between  increases in  PM and symptomatic improvement in 
depression throughout treatment. There is increasing evidence that  self-compassion is a robust predictor of 
lower psychopathology (for reviews,  see Barnard & Curry, 2011; MacBeth &  Gumley, 2012). A  recent 
controlled treatment study suggests that self-compassion is a  particularly  salutary  form of emotion 
regulation in individuals with high levels of depressed mood  (Diedrich,  Grant,  Hofmann, Hiller, &Berking, 
2014). To our knowledge, no published research has yet examined  the relation  between PM and self- 
compassion. Individuals high in PM may be  more likely to  develop greater self-compassion  throughout 
CBT treatment as  PM taps qualities that  may be essential to  developi[INVESTIGATOR_52497]-compassion. We examine 
potential interaction  effects for self-compassion  and PM in the  prediction  of depression levels pre and  post 
CBT treatment, for example, PM-related symptomatic improvement in  depression may be more pronounced 
for individuals  scoring  high  in self-compassion.  Studies have found evidence  that pre-treatment resting 
EEG, event-related  brain  potentials (ERPs), and performance on neurocognitive tests  show promise of being 
predictors of  subsequent clinical response  to antidepressants or  CBT (Bruder, Kayser, & Tenke,  2012). 
However, the extent to which these tests predict response to specific treatments for depression or the mechanisms underlying successful  response to CBT are not  known.  We propose  to test depressed patients, 
under [CONTACT_209032]'s protocol  (#6559) before they begin a treatment study, both in  the CBT  condition and  
control condition, as well as after treatment  (pre-post design) to  confirm the value of resting EEG, ERPs, 
dichotic listening, and neuropsychological tests for  predicting treatment response in  MDD.  Patients  are 
retested after the  successful completion  of CBT, which will take  12 weeks  and at the  end of 
psychoeducation treatment (12 weeks).  The development of biomarkers for predicting treatment response 
would be important for personalizing  treatment in depression (i.e., determining who  will and  who will not 
respond to CBT).

and conceptually  related and distinct concepts: self-reflection,  insight, rumination, mindfulness, and self-
compassion, and if and how they are related to a reduction  of symptoms in  CBT  and in the control 
condition, (4) to obtain  neurocognitive and electrophysiologic (EEG and ERP) measures so as to  further 
evaluate hypotheses  that depressive disorders involve abnormalities of frontal and  temporoparietal  function 
(Dr. Jürgen Kayser's protocol  (#6559); (5) to evaluate the prediction that  treatment with  CBT will result in  
acute and chronic  changes  in neurocognitive,  EEG and ERP  measures; (6) measures  of left hemisphere 
processing will be  predictive of clinical response to cognitive behavioral  therapy; (7) to evaluate any 
interactions between psychological  measures  and brain  variables  in predicting change in  symptoms during 
treatments.

subject will learn to use the following basic  cognitive-behavioral  techniques  for the treatment of depression: 
constructing an  ‘Action Schedule’, setting goals, doing  ‘behavioral  experiments,’ and creating a  Distorted 
Thought Record (DTR). The patient  is expected  to experiment with the tools  between sessions.

Compassion Scale  (SCS) via REDCap. The  SCIP  -M will be done  via Webex.  Patients  will also take  part in 
EEG and cognitive tests administered under Jurgen Kayser's protocol #6559R. If a  patient terminates before 
completing the  entire  12-session protocol,  in each of the groups, this  visit  will be conducted as  close as 
possible to the last  session.  Study participants who do  not remit (end treatment HDRS-17 > 7, BDI-II>13) at 
the end of  the trial  will be  offered a referral for psychotherapy or medications  per subject's preference, or if 
in the control group will be offered  CBT based  on the availability of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437].

Page [ADDRESS_249787]  will be withdrawn and  prematurely  terminated from  the study under any of the following 
circumstances:
1. The subject  requests to withdraw from the study.
2. The subject  exhibits  a clear-cut worsening of anxiety or mood symptoms, e.g., subject whose  CGI  
Improvement score  rating  increases to 6 (much worse) or 7 (very much worse).
3. The subject  reports suicidal ideation  of sufficient concern to  require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Visit the emergency 
room without admission will be judged on a  case-by-case basis erring on the side of ending study 
participation.
4. The appearance  of a new or undercurrent illness that prevents the patient from  complying with the 
protocol.
5. The subject  has missed four sessions or is not responding to repeated attempts to  contact  [CONTACT_198671]. 
Careful medical and  psychiatric screening  would be conducted to identify patients  with risk for potential  
adverse events if  they were to participate  in the study treatments.  As examples,  patients for whom suicide is 
considered a significant risk will be excluded from all study participation,  and subjects with  uncontrolled  
mental impairment.
Any patient who evidences significant clinical deterioration, such as unusually high levels of distress or suicidality at significant risk during the treatments will be removed  from the study and treated with  
alternative and appropriate  clinical care at  the DES until referred to another treatment. Signs of deterioration 
will be monitored weekly by [CONTACT_209015][INVESTIGATOR_208992]. At each visit during the 12 weeks of 
the treatments, the clinician will monitor, via clinical interview and various assessment  measures for  signs 
of increased  severity of  depression or the emergence of a  major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. If  in the judgment of the 
clinician and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_208993] a participant from  the study is indicated due to  increased severity of 
depression, the  patient will be removed and treated  by [CONTACT_9154] (Ronit Kishon)  until appropriate referrals 
will set in place. The  threshold for  mandatory removal from the study is a CGI Global Improvement score 
of 6 or 7 (worse  to very much worse). Such ratings at any evaluation would prompt premature termination.  
However, clinicians  and patients can  end the study at any time; i.e. a  CGI-GI  score  > 6 is not required to 
remove a patient from  the study.

experimental. Non-specific supportive treatment  was also  found to  be effective  for depression  through  in
smaller percentages  than  CBT. Subjects may  want to be medicated for their depression in  which case they
will appropriately be  referred  to during  the screening/evaluation process.
Risks/Discomforts/Inconveniences 
Risks that  could be  encountered during the study period
Assessment procedure: Subjects  could develop mild to moderate emotional  discomfort  or frustration
associated with  psychiatric interviewing,  or filling out questionnaires. Only experienced clinicians  will
administer these interviews; they  are well trained and experienced in  recognizing and dealing with
emotional discomfort. Also, subjects will be informed that  they  can end  the meeting  at any time, or skip
uncomfortable questions. Unless  such  skipped questions prevent a  diagnosis  or other clinical issues from
being adequately  assessed, the subject  will remain  study  eligible. Subjects’ mood symptoms  may also
worsen during treatment.  See procedures  for minimizing risk in the next section.
 
CBT and nonspecific supportive treatments: Subjects may  exhibit subjective  distress during CBT or
supportive treatment, which, if it occurs, is likely to be mild  and transient.  We will closely monitor
reactions and address them therapeutically.  In the unlikely event that  a subject manifests  unusually high
levels of distress, the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_208996]  a 
referral will be in place.Describe procedures  for minimizing risks
Careful medical and  psychiatric screening  will be conducted to  identify subjects  with  elevated risk for
potential adverse  effects. For example, participants  for whom suicide is  considered  a significant risk will be 
excluded from the  study.
 
Any subject  who evidences significant clinical deterioration, such as unusually high level of distress or
suicidality at significant risk during CBT or supportive treatment, will be removed from  the study and
treated with alternative and appropriate  clinical  care  at the DES until  a referral plan is set in  place.  Signs of
deterioration will be  monitored weekly  by [CONTACT_209016][INVESTIGATOR_541], study PI,  and a psychiatrist at the DES  as
needed. In addition,  at each visit during the [ADDRESS_249790]  or
clinically indicated. The threshold for mandatory  removal from  the study  is a CGI  Global Improvement
score of  6 or 7 (worse to very much worse).  Such ratings at any evaluation would prompt premature
termination. However,  clinicians and subjects can  end the study at any time;  i.e., a CGI-GI score > [ADDRESS_249791]  from the study. 
 
Precautionary measures will be taken to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 in experimental  processes.  
The changes we proposed  in the amendment section will  minimize the subjects' infection risk for COVID-
19. We are minimizing  risks of in-person  visits  by [CONTACT_14664] [ADDRESS_249792]  copy 
data will be held in locked file cabinets  and identifiable only  by [CONTACT_209017] a naming code of initials. 
Access to research records is restricted to research staff and  regulatory  authorities.  No research participant’s 
identifying data will be published. All electronic records will be  kept confidential  to the extent permitted  by 
[CONTACT_2371]. Participant’s names  and other personal  identifying information will be stored  in an  electronically secure

manage a data file on SPSS  that has all study data  without identifying  information. Patients’ names will not 
be entered into  the study  database, and each  will be uniquely identified only  by [CONTACT_209018].  All data will 
be entered once but checked and audited  by [CONTACT_209019]. When data entry is complete, all 
data will be cleaned and  rechecked  for accuracy before being backed up on an encrypted flash  drive. Any 
data that is transmitted electronically will be fully encrypted and  password protected.

specific tools and methods of depression management. The primary goal of supportive  
psychotherapy is to strengthen the patient’s ability to cope effectively with various  life stressors.  
The purpose of this research study is to learn which psychophysiological and psychological  
variables predict who will benefit from each treatment and how these variables may change  
throughout therapy.  
      Participants are randomized to one of these groups and are required to fill out measures that  
assess various psychological variables at three -time points through [ADDRESS_249794] you in accessing and filling out those  measures

Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Depression  
 
 
Purpose and Overview  
The purpose of the study is to compare two forms of therapy for depression since we still can’t predict 
which one will be more helpful for a particular person. Previous studies suggested that Cognitive 
Behavior Therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for d epression in nearly half of the individuals who 
do it, however there are others who do not benefit from it. Nonspecific supportive treatment focuses 
on meeting with a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], receiving support, having one's hope restored, and overcoming 
demoralization. In each of the treatments you will receive12  virtua l sessions. You will be randomly 
assigned to one or the other. The purpose of this study is to explore whether your concepts about 
yourself and others are related to the effectiveness of each of the treatm ents. Also, you must enroll  
in [CONTACT_209032]'s study (#6559) for the purpose of behavioral and electrophysiological tests at two time 
points that will contribute to our study. The aim is to learn more about brain function in people who 
are depressed and recei ve different types of talk therapy.  
 
 
Voluntary  
Participation in this research study is voluntary. If you decide not to participate, or if you later decide 
to stop participating, you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. A decisio n not 
to participate or withdraw your participation will not affect your current or future treatment at the New 
York State Psychiatric Institute or Columbia University Medical Center . If you are determined to be 
eligible for the study and later stop your p articipation for any reason, the study principal investigator, 
[CONTACT_209033] will treat you until the appropriate referral will be in place . You will be notified of significant 
new findings that may relate to your willingness to continue to participate in the  study.  
 
 
Alternative Treatments/ Alternatives to Participation  
You do not have to participate in this study to receive treatment for your depression. CBT and 
nonspecific supportive therapy can be obtained outside of study participation. There are medicati ons 
that have been shown to be effective for depression and can be prescribed by [CONTACT_209023]. 
There are also other non -medication treatments for depression beside CBT such as interpersonal 
psychotherapy, or group therapy.

though you may wish to continue to participate. Examples include missing [ADDRESS_249801] you.  
 
Risks and Inconveniences  
The primary risk of participating in this study is that the treatment may not help your symptoms. If you 
do not improve it may be up to 12 weeks from the time you enter the study until you would be provided 
with another type of treatment. Therefore, if you  do not improve, participating in this study will delay your  
receiving treatment for up to 12 weeks with medications and other psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_209003].  
The risks of psychotherapy treatment include the possibility of increased anxiety or sadnes s, and the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_209004]. We anticipate that the risks of study participation are

Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Depression  
 
 
Purpose and Overview  
The purpose of the study is to compare two forms of therapy for depression since we still can’t predict 
which one will be more helpful for a particular person. Previous studies suggested that Cognitive 
Behavior Therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for d epression in nearly half of the individuals who 
do it, however there are others who do not benefit from it. Nonspecific supportive treatment focuses 
on meeting with a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], receiving support, having one's hope restored, and overcoming 
demoralization. In each of the treatments you will receive12  virtua l sessions. You will be randomly 
assigned to one or the other. The purpose of this study is to explore whether your concepts about 
yourself and others are related to the effectiveness of each of the treatm ents. Also, you will be asked 
to consent to participate in [CONTACT_209032]'s study (#6559) for the purpose of behavioral and 
electrophysiological tests at two time points that will contribute to our study. The aim is to learn more 
about brain function in people  who are depressed and receive different types of talk therapy.

CONSENT FORM Study # 6806R  
Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Depression  
 
 
Purpose and Overview  
The purpose of the study is to compare two forms of therapy for depression since we still can’t predict 
which one will be more helpful for a particular person. Previous studies suggested that Cognitive 
Behavior Therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for d epression in nearly half of the individuals who 
do it, however there are others who do not benefit from it. Nonspecific supportive treatment focuses 
on meeting with a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], receiving support, having one's hope restored, and overcoming 
demoralization. In each of the treatments you will receive12  virtua l sessions. You will be randomly 
assigned to one or the other. The purpose of this study is to explore whether your concepts about 
yourself and others are related to the effectiveness of each of the treatm ents. Also, you must enroll  in 
[CONTACT_209032]'s study (#6559) for the purpose of behavioral and electrophysiological tests at two time 
points that will contribute to our study. The aim is to learn more about brain function in people who 
are depressed and recei ve different types of talk therapy.  
 
 
Voluntary  
Participation in this research study is voluntary. If you decide not to participate, or if you later decide 
to stop participating, you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. A decisio n not 
to participate or withdraw your participation will not affect your current or future treatment at the New 
York State Psychiatric Institute or Columbia University Medical Center . If you are determined to be 
eligible for the study and later stop your p articipation for any reason, the study principal investigator, 
[CONTACT_209033] will treat you until the appropriate referral will be in place . You will be notified of significant 
new findings that may relate to your willingness to continue to participate in the  study.  
 
 
Alternative Treatments/ Alternatives to Participation  
You do not have to participate in this study to receive treatment for your depression. CBT and 
nonspecific supportive therapy can be obtained outside of study participation. There are medicati ons 
that have been shown to be effective for depression and can be prescribed by [CONTACT_209023]. 
There are also other non -medication treatments for depression beside CBT such as interpersonal 
psychotherapy, or group therapy.  
 
 
Procedures  
Precaution ary measures will be taken to prevent the transmission of COVID -[ADDRESS_249814], such as access to a private space in which to take calls, or 
accessibility —access at  home to adequate devices, cell signal, or Wi -Fi. In the CBT treatment, you will 
receive [ADDRESS_249815] about 50 minutes each. The treatment 
involves being asked questions about your thoughts and feelings, as well as lear ning skills to manage 

   
                                                                                                                                                       08/20/[ADDRESS_249816] your hope  
restored and to overcome demoralization.  
 
Study measures :  
You will be interviewed  remotely  and you will fill some self -report measures  online   for a total of an hour 
and [ADDRESS_249817]. Kayser’s study( #6559).   
 
Medications during the study :  
You can participate in the study if you did not take prescribed antidepressant, or over the counter 
antidepressant medications, in the past month (three months for fluoxetine). You will be able to 
continue receiving psychotherapy sessions in the study if your  clinical condition will initiate your outside 
physician to prescribe psychotropic medications.  
 
The study doctors will end your study participation if they determine it is no longer in your best interest. 
In addition, you may stop participating in this st udy at any time for any reason. If you  stop participating 
in the study before [ADDRESS_249818]. Kishon.  
 
Cognitive Behavior Therapy and Nonspecific Supportive Therapy – Audiotapi[INVESTIGATOR_007] : 
You  will be audiotaped during your treatment visits. The audiotapi[INVESTIGATOR_209001] . The audio recording 
will be used for edu cation, research or training purposes only. Any audio recording will not include your 
full name, and will be reviewed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kishon who will evaluate the treatment provided by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_209002]. The audio recordings are kept for no more than 10 year s after which they will be destroyed. 
If you withdraw your consent, audio recordings can be destroyed during or after the interview or 
procedure.  
 
Treatment After the End of the Study :  
After the study is over, the Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_209033], will meet with you, and answer any 
questions you may have. If after completion of the study you have not improved, you will receive 
referrals for continuation of psychotherapy and/or medications. You will be able to see [CONTACT_209033] for 
weekly sessions until the referral is in place.   
 
Investigator Initiated Discontinuation of Study :  
There may be times when the investigator carrying out this study decides to stop the study even 
though you may wish to continue to participate. Examples include missing [ADDRESS_249819] you.  
 
Risks and Inconveniences  
The primary risk of participating in this study is that the treatment may not help your symptoms. If you 
do not improve it may be up to 12 weeks from the time you enter the study until you would be provided 
with another type of treatment. Therefore, if you  do not improve, participating in this study will delay your  
receiving treatment for up to 12 weeks with medications and other psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_209003].  
The risks of psychotherapy treatment include the possibility of increased anxiety or sadnes s, and the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_209004]. We anticipate that the risks of study participation are

no greater than those encountered in routine clinical treatment. However , you may be withdrawn from  
the study and offered other treat ment.  
 
Benefits:  
A direct benefit to you is the possibility that the treatments will help your symptoms of depression. In 
addition, your participation may help researchers learn more about how to treat depression. There may 
be no benefit to you if the trea tment is not effective.

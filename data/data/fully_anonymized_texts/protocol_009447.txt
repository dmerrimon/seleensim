I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims:   
A. Hypothesis :  
Evaluation of tumor tissue early in treatment will allow for identification of early adaptive mechanisms of cell survival in the setting of oncogene -targeted therapy. 
We hypothesize that neoadjuvant treatment of early stage NSCLC with ALK, ROS1 , or MET exon 14 mutations will allow for both identification of early 
mechanisms of resistance and demonstrate similar response rates to metastatic disease.   
B. Specific A ims 
1. Primary Objective:   
To evaluate the efficacy of crizotinib as induction therapy in participants  with 
surgically resectable ALK rearrangement , ROS1  rearrangement , or MET  exon 
[ADDRESS_1132908] 1.1.  
2. Secondary Objectives:  
To evaluate secondary measures of clinical efficacy in early stage ALK, ROS1 , 
or MET -mutant NSCLC participants  treated with crizotinib induction therapy .

ARM Trial Page 4 of 33 
 Secondary endpoints of efficacy will include: pathological response rate defined 
as < 50% viable tumor present histologically in the resected tumor specimen, 
metabolic response rate on paired FDG -PET scan (defined by [CONTACT_818023]), 
disease- free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS).  
3. Translation al Objective:  
To evaluate resected tumor samples using genetic, proteomic, and cell imaging techniques to understand mechanisms leading to incomplete tumor response following oncogene- targeted therapy with crizotinib.  Additionally, we will monitor 
plasma samples for evidence of tumor DNA at diagnosis and at post neoadjuvant 
treatment on day of resection 
 
II. Background and Significance:  
Incomplete responses to oncogene- targeted treatments in patients with oncogenic driver  
mutations in non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are the initial source of tumor cell 
resistance and ultimately disease progression arises from this survival niche1. Studies of 
resistance mechanisms have focused on evaluation of patients with metastatic disease who have progressed after targeted treatment.
2-6 This has allowed for significant 
advances in understanding the complex mechanism s of acquired resistance that 
develop, but has not yet permitted long- term disease control for the majority of patients 
with metastatic disease. An alternate approach to sequential targeted therapy is upfront combination therapy to potentially improve the depth of response, progression free 
survival and ultimately overall survival .
7 In order to inform potential frontline combination 
strategies it will be necessary to understand tumor cell survival mechanisms early in 
therapy.  
 An approach to studying remnant tumor samples following oncogene- targeted therapy 
would be the administration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for a defined period of time prior 
to surgical resection in oncogene- defined patient populations. Neoadjuvant studies of 
chemotherapy for patients with early stage, resectable NSCLC (stages IB -IIIA) have 
been performed previously . A meta -analysis of 15 trials (2385 patients) demonstr ated 
significant but modest improvements in overall survival at 5 years from 40 to 45% (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78- 0.96, P=0.007), time to distant recurrence at 5 years improved from 
60% to 70% (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.58- 0.82; p<0.001) and a recurrence free survival 
improvement from 30% to 36% at 5 years across all stages (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76- 0.94, 
P=0.002).
8 In addition to providing benefit to patients by [CONTACT_818024] , evaluation of the tumor response 
to targeted therapy in the neoadjuvant setting provides an excellent opportunity to study disease, given that patients will be undergoing definitive surgical as a predetermined part 
of their treatment plan. Evaluation of the response to neoadjuvant treatment with 
targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_818006]. In 2009 Kappers et 
al. reported the successful induction treatment of a patient with a stage IIIA epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] ( EGFR ) mutated NSCLC.
9 This was followed up by a phase II 
study in 60 non- squamous patients with early stage lung cancer treated with erlotinib for 
21 days prior to surgery. Seven patients had an EGFR  mutation, 40% (3 of 7) had a 
pathological response with > 50% tumor necrosis at the time of resection. In patients with wildtype EGFR , only 20% (8 of 35 patients) had > 50% necrosis in their tumors at

Protocol Version Date: 10/20/[ADDRESS_1132909]  (Drs. Trever Bivona and Col lin 
Blakely at UCSF, personal communication). We propose a complimentary clinical trial  in 
which patients with ALK rearrangements, ROS1  rearrangements, and MET  exon 14 skip 
mutations would receive neoadjuvant crizotinib. The characteristics and clinical relevance of these target genes is described below.  
 
Fusion of the echinoderm microtubule- associate protein- like 4 (EML4 ) gene, or less 
commonly other gene partners, with the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene 
generates a chimeric gene (EML4 -ALK) and protein that has tumor transforming 
potential.

7% of patients with non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) depending on the cohort 
evaluated.13-[ADDRESS_1132911] been found in 1- 2% of patients with lung cancer.17-19 The ROS1  gene 
itself was initially identified as the homolog of the transforming v -ros sequence from the 
UR2 avian sarcoma virus, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) with no known ligand.[ADDRESS_1132912] oncogenic activity in brain, cholangiocarcinoma and ovarian 
cancer, in addition to NSCLC.21 Finally, the MET  gene encodes an RTK whose natural 
ligand is the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). This RTK can be modified in many ways to become an oncogenic, for the purposes of this study we will be focusing on exon 14 
mutations (~4% of pati ents) , however, we will permit enrollment of MET  fusions and MET 
Y1003X mutations given their demonstrated oncogenic potential .
17,22-25 Though 
individually each of these mutations makes up a small percentage of the total NSCLC 
population, their composite prevalence approaches 10% of an unselected population. 
Each of these oncogenic drivers can be successfully targeted by [CONTACT_36432] -FDA approved 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib.26-28

 In ALK -positive NSCLC, frontline treatment with crizotinib demonstrated a progression 
free survival of 10.9 months compared with 7 months for the control arm of platinum 
doublet and the overall response rate (ORR) was 74% compared with 45%.29 The 
disease control rate in this study was 92% with crizotinib and 81% with standard of care 
chemotherapy. This is important because it demonstrates that the vast majority of patients with an ALK rearrangement will respond to neoadjuvant treatment therefo re, 
from a surgical standpoint the risk of progression while receiving neoadjuvant treatment 
is very low. In ROS1 -positive NSCLC, the response rate to treatment was 72% and the 
disease control rate was 90% in the expansion cohort of the phase I study.
30 Additionally, 
the median progression free survival in this population was 19.2 months, though the 
upper limit has not yet been reached. Similarly, MET is another RTK in which mutation (exon 14 skippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) or other alteration can result in oncogenic activity.
23,25,27,31 Clinical 
trials evaluating the efficacy of crizotinib in these populations are ongoing but in the setting of exon 14 mutations the disease control rate and ORR in a series of 3 patients treated with crizotinib was 100%, with all patients demonstrating a partial response.
[ADDRESS_1132913] previously reported mechanisms of resistance 
of a cohort of ROS1 patients as well as an expanded cohort of ALK positive patients with disease progression on tyrosine kinase inhibitor (T KI) therapy. In this evaluation we 
found that in ALK positive patient ’s kinase domain mutations make up 33% of the 
resistance mechanisms while copy number gains and alternative mutations make up 
another 33% and 33% remain unknown. Additionally, we found an increase in the 
number of mutations as the number of TKI treatments expanded.
36 Gainor et al.  recently 
reported that in a cohort of 83 ALK positive patients treated with ≥[ADDRESS_1132914] been 
reported indicating that this gene also demonstrates similar mechanisms of resistance.39 
 
Each of the oncogene subgroups  listed above not only demonstrates substantial clinical 
response to crizotinib but also demonstrates that despi[INVESTIGATOR_818007]. Residual disease from inc omplete 
responses forms the basis for the development of drug resistance. Currently the majority 
of effort in overcoming resistance has been focused on evaluation and treatment after

 resistance develops. However, we feel that it is  also critical to investigate responses to 
treatment early in the tumor time course as early tumor responses to treatment with 
crizotinib  and other TKIs  are poorly understood. A neoadjuvant approach to both patient 
treatment and resistance development is needed to advance our understanding of tumor 
resistance. We hypothesize that neoadjuvant treatment with crizotinib, an ALK, ROS1 , 
and MET targeted TKI, in patients with one of these genetic alterations (in total 
comprising ~10% of patients with NSCLC) will accom plish these goals.

Principal Investigator .   
(b) This trial will not exclude potential subjects from participation on the basis of ethnic origin or gender.  Participants  (including women and minorities) 
will be included in this study provided they meet all eligibility criteria.  
(c) Screening size: We will be using the ORR as the efficacy outcome to 
power the study. With 35% as the historical ORR  derived from 
neoadjuvant chemotherap y and 60% as the desirable rate,  26 subjects 
will provide 80% power to detect this 25% absolute difference with a type 
I error rate of 0.[ADDRESS_1132923] 
ALK, ROS1 , or MET  activating alterations will be approximately 10%, 
therefore, we will need to screen ~260 patients to obtain 26 evaluable 
participants .  
(d) Screening Tests:  
1) Plasma evaluation for circulating tumor DNA will consist of a research 
blood draw in which 4 additional tubes of blood will be drawn (Streck 
tubes, approximately 10 mL per tube). This will occur before initiation of treatment with study drug (though must be done at least 48 hours 
after any invasive biopsy) and prior to surgical resection.  Additio nally, 
an optional ctDNA will be available to patients after definitive treatment with each follow -up CT scan (if available via their treating 
oncologist)  
  
2) Screening tests for mutational analysis will be performed on biopsy 
specimens and verification of mutation status will occur at a CLIA certified lab prior to administration of study drug. The Biorepository 
Manager will be responsible for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_818011] .

(i) Central pathology assessment (i.e. H/E) is expected to occur at the 
University of Colorado.  
 (ii) Screening Test: Either a CLIA approved laboratory evaluation or via 
the Oncomine Universal Dx test at [COMPANY_007] which provides a set of 
primers that target key regions of 52 unique human genes (47 
excluding copy number variations) comprised of approximately 700 
somatic variants in a single kit for use with the Ion Torrent™ PGM Dx 
next generation sequencing (NGS) system to generate the variant calls.   The Oncomine Universal Dx Test allows concurrent analysis of 
DNA and RNA, enabling sequencing of 35 hotspot genes, 19 genes associated with copy number gain and 23 fusion genes, all in a single 
workflow using the Ion PGM System. The assay also leverages Ion 
AmpliSeq technology's low DNA and RNA sample input requirements from FFPE tissue (10 ng of extracted nucleic acid per reaction for a total of 20 ng per sample) to enable accurate and reliable sequence analysis across a large range of tumor sample types.  This is a subset 
of genes utilized by [CONTACT_6812] -MATCH trial with the same sequencing 
technology.

 • Participants  who are removed from the study protocol therapy who 
are still eligible for surgery will proceed with standard of care 
treatment as per their treating oncologist.  
• Additionally, the reason for discontinuation of protocol therapy will be documented.  
• In case a participant  decides to prematurely discontinue protocol 
therapy (“refuses  treatment”) the participant  should be asked if she 
or he may still be contact[CONTACT_740742]. The outcome of that discussion should be documented in both the medical records and in the study case report forms.  
 
(b) Study Withdrawal:   
• Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at 
any time upon request  
• If a participant  decides to withdraw from the study (and not just from 
protocol therapy) all efforts should be made to complete and report 
study assessments as thoroughly as possible. The investigator should contact [CONTACT_818028] a responsible relative by [CONTACT_818029] a personal visit to establish as completely as possible the 
reason for the study withdrawal.  
• A complete final evaluation at the time of the participant ’s study 
withdrawal should be made with an explanation of why the participant  is withdrawing from the study. If the reason for removal of 
a participant  from the study is an adverse event, the principal 
specific event will be recorded on the study case report form.  
 
• An investigator may terminate participation in the study if any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical 
conditi on or situation occurs such that continued participation in the 
study would not be in the best interest of the participant.  
 
E. Treatment Plan  / Study Agent  
Once mutational status is verified, 26 participants  with stage I A-IIIA, surgically 
resectable lung adenocarcinoma with an activating alteration in ALK, ROS1 , or 
MET  will be treated with 6 weeks of crizotinib induction therapy.  There is no pre-
specified limit or quota for each of the molecular subgroups.

assessed according to the NCI CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_1132926] description of the medical condition in the opi [INVESTIGATOR_1070], from the time of informed consent  until 7 days  (for non -serious 
AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs)  after the last dose of study medication.  
 
Unless otherwise noted in the tables below , treatment may be delayed ≤ 3 
week s from the expected day of the next treatment for any reas on.  If 
treatment is delayed ≤ 1 week , subjects will proceed with the next day  of 
treatment at the dose level recommended. If trea tment is delayed >3 week s, 
then the patient should be discontinued from protocol -mandated therapy . 
 Missed doses of crizotinib are not to be made up.  In the event that 
crizotinib dosing is interrupted, the duration of cycle/treatment will not be extended.   
 Dose Modifications: as per FDA labeling
41 
Reduce dose as below, if 1 or more dose reductions are necessary due to 
adverse reactions of Grade 3 or 4 severity, as defined by [CONTACT_382587] (NCI CTCAE) 
version 4.0:  
• First dose reduction: crizotinib  200 mg taken orally twice daily  
• Second dose reduction: crizotinib  250 mg taken orally once daily  
• Permanently discontinue if unable to tolerate crizotinib  250 mg taken

G. Laboratory Procedures and/or Other Assays for Research 
1. Blood and Tissue Handling 
(a) Tissue will be handled in accordance with routine clinical practice 
requirements in the University of  Colorado Pathology Department and the 
University of Colorado Molecular Correlates Laboratory .  
(b) When performed at the University of Colorado the diagnostic biopsy specimen will undergo routine pathologic evaluation and once confirmed to be lung adenocarcinoma will undergo adequacy assessment by [CONTACT_818034]. If sufficient tissue is available, 
1-[ADDRESS_1132938] procedure. Biopsy specimens will be immediately 
released to University of Colorado or [COMPANY_007] once confirmed to be adenocarcinoma. Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_818012]. Molecular 
screening will occur at the University of Colorado, the University of 
[LOCATION_004] -San Francisco,  or [COMPANY_007] as described above with an 
anticipated turnaround time of 2 weeks.  
(c) When available, the diagnostic H&E slide, on which molecular testing was performed and eligibility of the patient for the protocol was determined, will be obtained by [CONTACT_818035] a project 
specific image file utilizing University of Colorado Cancer Center (UCCC) imaging core Aperio scanner.  This imaging file will be made 
available to project -associated investigators via password- protected 
access. 
(d) Plasma circulating tumor DNA testing will be done via Guardant Health. 
This is not considered standard of care and will be covered by [CONTACT_818036]. For this testing, 4 additional tubes of blood will be drawn ( Streck 
tubes, approximately 10 mL per tube) . Samples will be designated for 
research use and sent to Guardant Health. Samples will be sent on 
screened patients as well as enrolled patients , on day [ADDRESS_1132939] scan.  
 
(e) If additional study sites are added and tissue molecular screening is 
performed at participating institutions this is not included in study cost . 
and should be billed as standard of care.  
 
2. Post-Treatment Resection Specimen Handling  
(a) When surgical resection is performed at UCH, at least thirty minutes 
prior to surgical resection, the designated pathology  personnel will be 
notified of the impending tissue collection and given the room number in 
which the procedure will take place.  The designee will attend the

Study Reference Number : [COMPANY_007] #W1216247 
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Patil   
Protocol Version Date: 10/20/[ADDRESS_1132940] containing 
cryomolds by [CONTACT_818037] (N2).  Following the 
procedure, the tissue will be delivered to the pathology department or CMOCO laboratory by [CONTACT_818038].  Utilizing 
the study ID  generated by [CONTACT_818039], 
the case will be linked to a specific pathology accession number (PYY -
XXX).  These frozen blocks will be stored in a designated location within 
a CMOCO  liquid N2 storage unit until processed for histologic evaluation 
and collection of RNA for study related RNA analyses. If processed 
immediately, interim storage may not be required.  
(b) Histopathologic evaluation of surgical resection specimens will be 
performed within 24- 36 hours of collection unless weekends or holidays 
prevent this (processing will take place on next working day when conflicts are encountered).  Each tissue sample will be sectioned on a cryostat and an H&E slide will be prepared and reviewed at the time of frozen section by a designated UCH pathologist.  Presence of tumor, 
percentage of necrosis and overall estimated tumor/stromal cellularity 
will be recorded for each specimen, and this information will be stored 
(OnCore).  The H&E slides will be barcoded, entered into the OnCore 
database, and subsequently stored in the archives.   
 
3. Additional analyses  
(a) Tissue preparation is outlined in Appendix A .  
Additional testing may include but is not limited to direct sequencing of oncogenes, immunohistochemistry, proximity ligation assay (PLA) and 
RT-PCR for oncogenic fusions.   
(b) Immunohistochemist ry of tumor samples : 
IHC will be completed on post resection samples by [CONTACT_818040][INVESTIGATOR_494514]. Proteins to be evaluated include but are not limited to e -cadherin, 
vimentin, fibronectin, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD16, CD206, PDL1, and CSF1R.  
(c) Proximity Ligation Assay of tumor resection samples :  
PLA to be performed to determine the level of signal inhibition by [CONTACT_818041]. Assays will be performed in laboratory of the Principal Investigator. They will be performed as 
previously described using assay modifications specific from ALK, 
ROS1 , and MET.
42 
(d) RNAseq evaluation of tumor samples :  
RNA seq procedures outlines in Appendix B and C. Genetic mutations and expression changes will be evaluated with RNAseq. This will assist 
with identification of new markers of disease response/ survival as well 
as identification of possible targets of combination therapy. These

 experiments will be done within the University of Colorado Core facility 
and the data analysis and interpretation will be done with the study 
designated bioinformatics faculty member.  
 
IV. Assessment of Safety  
A. Definition of Adverse Event  (AE) 
Adverse event  means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of 
an intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention- related (21 CFR 
312.32 (a)).  
 
B. Definition of Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE  or serious suspected adverse reaction . An AE or suspected adverse 
reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or [COMPANY_007] , it 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death,  
• is life -threatening (i.e., causes an immediate risk of death),  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8686],  
• results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity (i.e., substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions ), results in a 
congenital anomaly/ birth defect , or  
• is considered to be an important medical event .   
An important medical event may be considered serious when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant  and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this SAE 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
 
C. Definit ion of an Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to Participants 
or Others (UAP) 
This study will use the definition of an Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to 
Participants or Others (UAP)  which is any event that was unforeseen and indicates 
that the research procedures caused harm (including physical, psychological, 
economic or social harm) to the participants or others, or indicates that participants or others are at increased risk of harm than was previously known or recognized.  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as 
the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent document; and 
(b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
COMIRB Number : 16-2025

ARM Trial Page 21 of 33 
 • Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly 
related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, 
experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_68408]); and 
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of 
harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
D. Classification of an Adverse Event  
1. Severity of Event  
For AEs not incl uded in CTCAE v4.03 , the following guidelines will be used to 
describe severity.  
• Mild  (grade 1) – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not 
interfere with the participant’s daily activities. 
• Moderate (grade 2) – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or 
concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause 
some interference with functioning.  
• Severe  (grade 3) – Events significantly interrupt a participant’s usual 
daily activity despi[INVESTIGATOR_818013].  
• Life-Threatening (grade 4) - The patient is at immediate risk of death. 
• Death (grade 5) - The patient dies as a direct result of the complication 
or condition induced by [CONTACT_84204]. 
2. Relationship to the Study Agent  
The clinician’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study agent (drug, biologic, 
device) is part of the documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining 
what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. Al l AEs must have their 
relationship to the study agent assessed. In a clinical trial, the study product must 
always be suspect. To help assess, the following guidelines are used.  
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study agent, there is a 
reasonable possibility that the study agent caused the AE, or there is a 
temporal relationship between the study agent and event. Reasonable 
possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationshi p 
between the study agent and the AE.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the 
administration of the study agent caused the event, there is no temporal 
relationship between the study  agent and event onset, or an alternate 
etiology has been established.

 3. Expectedness 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_427122]. An SAE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or 
frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously 
described for the study agent. 
E. Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -up 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during 
study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medi cal care, or upon 
review by a study monitor. All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate CRF. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, 
relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_71495] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/ stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless o f 
relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will 
be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study 
participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. UAPs will be recorded in the data collection system throughout the study.  
 Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the 
duration of the event at each  level of severity to be performed. AEs characteriz ed as 
intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_15356] 7 (for  non-serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after 
the last dose of study medication. At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/ SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or s tabilization.  
 
F. Reporting Procedures  
1. Adverse Event Reporting  
AEs will be reported in accordance with the UCCC DSMC and COMIRB policies.  
2. Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
SAEs  will be reported in accordance with [COMPANY_007]’s SAE Form Completion Guide , 
the UCCC DSMC and C OMIRB policies.  SAEs will also be reported in 
accordance with the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
requirements , as applicable, under IND or IND Ex emption.   
All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the PI [INVESTIGATOR_818014].

VI. Study Monitoring and Oversight  
A. Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) Oversight  
The sponsor investigator will be responsible for monitoring the trial per the trial monitoring plan, in addition to overseeing the safety and efficacy of the trial 
including any specimens collected, executing the data and safety monitoring (DSM) 
plan, and complying with all reporting requirements to local and federal authorities. This oversight will be accomplished through additional oversight from the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) at the University of Colorado Cancer Center (CU Cancer Center). The DSMC is responsible for ensuring data quality and study 
participant safety for all clinical studies at the CU Cancer Center, which is the 
coordinating institution of this trial. A summary of the DSMC’s activities is as 
follows:  
 
• Conduct of internal audits  
• Ongoing review of all serious adverse events (SAEs) and unanticipated problems (UAPs)  
• Has the authority to suspend trials for safety or trial conduct issues  
• May submit recommendations for corrective actions to the CU Cancer 
Center’s Executive Committee  
 
Per the CU Cancer Center Institutional DSM Plan, SAEs and UAPs are reported to the DSMC, IRB and the sponsor investigator per protocol. All SAEs and UAPs are to be reported to the DSMC within 7 (for fatal or life- threatening events) or 15 (non-
life-threatening events) calendar days of the sponsor investigator receiving 
notification of the occurrence.

Protocol Version Date: 10/20/[ADDRESS_1132944]’s treatment outcomes will be discussed by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_818017]. Data regarding number of subjects, 
significant toxicities, dose modifications, and treatment responses will be discussed and documented in the meeting’s minutes.  
 The sponsor investigator is responsible for organizing and conducting regularly scheduled teleconferences with all participating sites. The sponsor investigator will 
also be responsible for including data from all the participating sites to include the 
minutes from these regularly scheduled teleconferences between the sponsor 
investigator and the sites within the overall trial’s DSM progress report.  
 The sponsor investigator will provide a DSM progress report to the CU Cancer 
Center DSMC on a recurring basis (either every six or twelve months based on 
DSMC vote). The DSM report will include a protocol summary, current enrollment numbers, summary of toxicity data to include specific SAEs, UAPs and AEs, any dose modifications, all protocol deviations, and protocol amendments. The DSM report submitted to the DSMC will also include, if applicable, the results of any 
efficacy data analysis conducted. Results and recommendations from the review of 
this progress report by [CONTACT_341037] a DSMC review letter. The sponsor investigator is then responsible for ensuring this letter is submitted to the site’s IRB of record at the time of IRB continuing review.  
 
B. Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
1. Clinical Site Monitoring.  Site m onitoring visits will be performed by [CONTACT_818046] a regular basis, 
pursuant to the Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP), incorporated herein by [CONTACT_95761]. 
The CMP describes in detail who will  conduct the monitoring, at what frequency 
monitoring will be done, at what level of detail monitoring will be performed, and 
the distribution of the monitoring reports. During these visits, information 
recorded on the CRFs will be verified against source documents.  Additional 
computer programs that identify selected protocol deviations, out -of-range data, 
and other data errors within the electronic data entry may also be used to help monitor the study.  As necessary, requests for data clarification or cor rection will 
be sent to the appropriate site PI.  
2. Audits.   Independent auditors from the sponsor investigator’s authoriz ed 
representative will be allowed by [CONTACT_779]’s PI [INVESTIGATOR_16158].  In addition, audits may be 
conducted at any time by [CONTACT_16171]/or the IRB.  
 
VII. Data Collection  and Handling:

 VIII. Statistical Considerations  
 
General considerations : Data collected in this study will be presented using summary  
tables, patient data listings, and figures.  Disease evaluations will be performed by  
[CONTACT_818047] 1.1 criteria.  26 evaluable subjects are planned for this  
study.  
 
Analysis populations : Patients who received at least 3 weeks of crizotinib treatment in   
neoadjuvant  setting will be included in the efficacy analyses.  
 
Analysis methods: Summary statistics will be used for the primary outcome objective 
response rate. Objective response rate is defined as the proportion of subjects with 
complete response or partial response evaluated before the surgery.  95% exact 
confidence interval will be provided. Pathologic response and Metabolic Response will be summarized and reported similarly. Kaplan- Meier survival curves will be used to 
display disease free survival and progres sion free survival. Median survival times will 
be calculated and reported. For the translational endpoints, we will use t -test, chi -
square test, or logistic regression, as appropriate, to assess if there is any difference between samples with incomplete response with samples with complete response in 
measurements obtained using genetic, proteomic, and cell imaging techniques to understand mechanisms leading to incomplete tumor response.  
 
Determination of sample size: We use ORR as the efficacy outcome to power the study. With 
35% as the historical ORR for chemotherapy and 60% as the desirable rate,  26 subjects will 
provide 80% power to detect this 25% difference with a type I error rate of 0.05 using a si ngle 
stage design. Subjects with a minimum of 3 weeks of crizotinib treatment in the 
neoadjuvant setting will be included in the efficacy evaluation. It is estimated that at  
maximum 10% of subjects might not be eligible to be included due to shorter period of  
treatment duration or lost to follow -up. Thus , the study will recruit 29 subjects at  
maximum to account for the potential 10% loss in evaluable subjects.  We estimate that the cumulative percentage of patients that will have ALK, ROS1 , or MET  activating alterations will 
be approximately 10%, therefore, we will need to screen ~260 patients to obtain 26 evaluable participants.
 
 
 
IX. Potential Scientific Problems:   
A. Low accrual - If we find that screening and accrual are not meeting targets by [ADDRESS_1132945] to additional testing methods for validation.  
C. Delays in surgical scheduling resulting in large variations in treatment tim es. 
Disease response to neoadjuvant treatment will be standardized to evaluation with

 6-week scan. We hope to be able to ensure timely surgical excision with a 1- week 
window for surgery and for patien t enrollment at time of surgical evaluation. 
Participant s will continue on crizotinib treatment until the day or surgery.  
 
X. Summarize Knowledge to be Gained:   
This study will generate knowledge regarding molecular mechanisms of the devel opment 
of resistance to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_818018]-small cell lung 
cancer as a model.  This knowledge to could lead to improved treatment modalities and 
survival for patients with all stages of non- small cell lung cancer .

 APPENDIX 
A. Tissue preparation for additional analysis:  
Tissue will be microdissected for RNA extraction with a goal of obtaining at least 500 tumor 
cells to facilitate optimal RNA sequencing.  The H&E slide will be utilized to demarcate areas for desired tissue collection and this area will be macroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_818020] (non- tumor, necrotic tissue, etc .) and placed in RNeasy. If any frozen biopsies 
remain after collection of tissue for RNA extraction and IHC, these blocks will be barcoded 
and stored in liquid N2 archives for future use.  
 
Tissue transferred to RNeasy will undergo RNA extraction by [CONTACT_818050].  The research histology core will be 
responsible for formalin fixed tissue processing and paraffin embedding.  The block will be 
sectioned to generate [ADDRESS_1132949] will be 
stained with H&E, barcoded and archived in CMOCO .  The remaining 15 sections will be 
prepared on plus slides and stored as barcoded, unstained immunoblanks in the archive.  Immunohistochemistry including development and optimization of new antibodies, should 
that be required for immunohistochemistry (IHC), can be provided by [CONTACT_818051].  
 A research surgical pathology report will be generated for each tissue sample under an 
accession number as described above.  This report will  give a single diagnosis based on 
histologic review of all frozen and formalin- fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) H&E sections 
generated during processing.  If unexpected histopathologic features (i.e. histology inconsistent with a prior diagnostic /screening  biopsy) are found on review of frozen or 
FFPE generated H&E slides, tissue will be held for any ancillary testing, such as IHC, that is deemed necessary by [CONTACT_818052].  
 
All residual material after the above-descri bed tissue processing and testing will be stored 
in the archives.  
 
When surgery is performed at other institutions, tumor samples will be collected and flash frozen for transport to the University of Colorado for processing.  
 B. RNAseq assay.  
Sequencing Library will be constructed using 1µg total RNA following Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation v2 Guide. The poly -A containing mRNA molecules will be purified 
using poly -T oligo -attached magnetic beads. Following purification, the mRNA will be 
fragmented into small pi[INVESTIGATOR_818021]. The 
cleaved RNA fragments will be converted into first strand cDNA using reverse 
transcriptase and random primers. This will be followed by [CONTACT_818053] I and RNase H. These cDNA fragments will go through an end 
repair process, the addition of a single “A” base, and then ligation of the adapters. The products will be purified and enriched with PCR to create the final cDNA library. The cDNA 
library will be validated on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using DNA -1000 chip. Cluster 
generation will be performed on the Illumina cBot using a Single Read Flow Cell with a 
Single Read cBot reagent plate (TruSeq SR Cluster Kit). Sequencing of the clustered flow 
cell will be performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 using TruSeq SBS v4 reagents for

 1x125bp. Sequencing images will be generated through the sequencing platform (Illumina 
HiSeq 2000). The raw data will be analyzed in four steps: image analysis, base c alling, 
sequence alignment, and variant analysis and counting.  
 
C. RNAseq Data Analysis.  
RNAseq obtained from participants  will be analyzed as previously described.32,43,[ADDRESS_1132950] 2- fold diff erentially 
expressed genes with 80% power with 0.05 type I error.32,43-47 Data analysis: Sequencing 
reads that passed quality control will be mapped against the human genome using Tophat2 workflow. We will use the NCBI reference annotation (build 37.2) as a guide, and 
allowing 3 mismatches for the initial alignment and 2 mismatches per segment with 25 bp 
segments. Next, we will employ Cufflinks to assemble the transcripts using the RefSeq 
annotation as the guide, allowing for novel isoform discovery in each sample. Isoforms were ignored if the number of supporting reads was less than 30 and if the isoform fraction was less than 10% for the gene. Following data fragment bias correction, multi -read 
correction, and normalized by [CONTACT_818054]. The transcript assemblies for each sample will be merged using cuffmerge. To estimate individual samples transcript expressions, we will compute the transcripts’ FPKM values by [CONTACT_818055]. The final output of this analysis step is a P x N matrix, where P is the number of samples and N is the number of transcripts, respectively. As the primary discovery in this aim is to identify genes and pathways that are differentially 
expressed in the pre-vs- early -treatment, we will summarize gene expression for individual 
sample by [CONTACT_818056]. 
Subsequent data analyses of RNAseq will be performed on this matrix. Significant genes will be identified using the R package LIMMA. Significant genes will be identified using the lmFit, eBayes, and decide Tests functions (FDR < 0.05 and fold change > 2). The statistics 
will be moderated using empi[INVESTIGATOR_818022] (via the eBayes function), global 
multiple testing strategy, and Benjamini & Hochberg adjustment. For Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), we will use the human pathways obtained from KEGG as genesets. Enriched pathways will be identified by [CONTACT_818057] 1000 permutations as a stand -

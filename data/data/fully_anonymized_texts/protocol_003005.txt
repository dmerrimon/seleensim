 IRB Approval:  IRB approval indicates that this project meets the regulatory requirements for the protection 
of human subjects.  IRB approval does not absolve the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_39167], collegiate, or departmental policies or pr ocedures.  
 Agency Notification:  If this is a New Project or Continuing Review application and the project  is funded  by 
[CONTACT_39243]- profit agency , the original HHS 310 form, “Protection of Human Subjects 
Assurance Identification /IRB Certi fication/Declaration of Exemption,” has been forwarded to the UI Division of 
Sponsored Programs, 100 Gilmore Hall, for appropriate action.  You will receive a signed copy from Sponsored Programs.  
 Recruitment/Consent:  Your IRB application  has been approved for recruitment of subjects not to exceed 
the number indicated on your application form.  If you are using written informed consent, the IRB -approved 
and stamped Informed Consent Document(s)  are attached.  Please make copi[INVESTIGATOR_39168]  "masters" 
for subjects to sign when agreeing to participate.  The original signed Informed Consent Document should be 
placed in your research files.  A copy of the Informed Consent Document should be given to the subject.  (A 
copy of the signed  Informed Consent Document should be given to the subject if your Consent contains a 
HIPAA authorization section.)  If hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic patients are being enrolled, a copy of the IRB approved 
Record of Consent form should be placed in the subject’s electronic medical record . 
 Continuing Review:  Federal regulations require that the IRB re- approve research projects at intervals  
appropriate to the degree of risk, but no less than once per year.  This process is called “continuing review.”  
Continuing review for non- exemp t research is required to occur as long as the research remains active for 
long-term follow -up of research subjects, even when the research is permanently closed to enrollment of new 
subjects and all subjects have completed all research- related interventions and to occur when the remaining 
research activities are limited to collection of private identifiable information. Your project “expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054]” at 12:01 AM on the date indicated on the preceding page (“Next IRB Approval Due on or Before”).  You must obtain 
your next IRB approval
 of this project on or before that expi[INVESTIGATOR_320].  You are responsible for submitting a 
Continuing Review application in sufficient time for approval before the expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], however the HSO will 
send a reminder notice a pproximatel y 60 and 30 days prior to the expi[INVESTIGATOR_320].  
 
Modifications:  Any change in  this research project or materials must be submitted on a Modification 
application to the IRB for prior review and approval , except when a change is necessary to eliminate appare nt 
immediate hazards to subjects.  The investigator is required to promptly notify the IRB of any changes made 
without IRB approval to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to subjects using the Modification/Update Form. Modifications requiring the prior review and approval of the IRB  include but are not limited to:  changing 
the protocol or study procedures, changing investigators or funding sources, changing the Informed Consent Document, increasing the anticipated total number of subjects from what was originally approved, or adding 
any new materials (e.g., letters to subjects, ads , questionnaires).  
 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks:  You must promptly report to the IRB any serious and/or 
unexpected adverse experience, as defined in the UI Investigator’s Guide, and any other unanticipated 
problems involving risks to subjects or others.  The Reportable Events Form (REF) should be used for 
reporting to the IRB.  
 Audits/Record -Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:  Your research records may be audited at any time during or after the 
implementation of your project.  Federal and University policies require that all research records be 
maintained for a period of three (3) years following the close of the research project.  For research that involves drugs or devices seeking FDA approval, the research records must be kept for a period of three 
years after the FDA has taken final action on the marketing application.  
 Additional Information:  Complete information regarding research involving human subjects at The 
University of Iowa is available in the “Investigator’s Guide to Human Subjects Research.”  Research 
investigators are expected to comply with these policies and procedures, and to be familiar with the 
University’s Federalwide Assurance, the Belmont Report, 45CFR46, and other applicable regulations prior to 
conducting the research.  These documents and IRB application and related forms are available on the 
Human Subjects Office website or are available by [CONTACT_3379] 335- 6564.

[CONTACT_1744]-[ADDRESS_40891] Title:
Evaluation of Parent Based Interventions to Support Children Af ter Traumatic Injury
I.3 Short Title (optional):Psychological First Aid for Injured Kids
I.[ADDRESS_40892] eight focus groups: two composed of appro ximately 6-10 parents each at Un iversity of Iowa Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39170]  6-10 parents at Blank Childre n's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. We will also cond uct two of approximately 6-10
pediatric health care providers each from the University of Iow a Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39171] a pproximately 6-10 pediatric h ealth care
providers each from Blank Children 's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The purpose of t he parent focus groups is to establish the parent's willingness to
participate in a study to reduce the psychological effects of i njury on their children, and a  parent's accepta bility of the LP C for Injured
Kids materials. The purpose of the pediatric health care provid er focus groups is to understand the types of trauma experience d by
[CONTACT_7683], the psychosocial consequences encountered by [CONTACT_39244],
accessible, and acceptable to fam ilies particularly from rural Iowa. In addition, providers will be asked to prov ide feedback on the LPC
for Injured Kids materials. If a health care provider is unable  to participate in the focus group but wishes to be interviewed  individually,
the purpose and the questions ask ed during the in terview will b e identical to those of the focus group. Each focus group/inter view is
expected to last between 60 and 90 minutes.
Phase 2
Children between 10-17 years of age presenting to the UIHC and Blank Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4791] a n unintentional injury requirin g
admission will be the sample popu lation. Blank Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39172] a separate IRB for their participation in the  study. A
child will be included if they ar e 10-17 years old with an unin tentional injury. Cons enting children and t heir parents will be  asked to
complete a series of four questi onnaires: before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39173], at [ADDRESS_40893] dis charge.
The parent-child dyads will be r andomized (1:1) to receive trai ning in Link for Injured Kids or  to receive Trauma Education (p arent
booklet, "So, you've been in an Accident"). The survey complete d in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39174] a paper survey or online via iPads, a nd
follow-up surveys can be completed on paper or online.
I.5 Specify your research question(s), study aims or hypotheses (do not indicate "see protocol")
Phase 1Assess the feasibility of LPC for Injured Kids t hrough qualitat ive research with paren ts of previously inj ured children and so cial workers
and pediatric trauma providers f rom the UI Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39175]'s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The focus group findings will also help
inform and refine intervent ion materials and delivery.
Phase 2Through a randomized trial, deter mine the range of potential ps ychosocial and behavioral health indicators possibly impacted b y Link
for Injured Kids. Th is will identify the types of outcomes whic h could include PTSD, depression , nonspecific distr
 ess, quality  of life,
absenteeism, school performance, cop ing skills, communication s kills, and access to mental health.
I.6 Background and significance and/or Pre liminary studies related to this project.
(do not indicate "see protocol")According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, th e number one cause of death and morbidity among children ages 1 -19 is
unintentional injury. Each year, approximately 12,000 children die from unintentional injury cau ses (1). Of all injury causes,  motor
vehicle crash leads to the most number of deaths to children in  U.S. as passengers, teen drivers and pedestrians. Almost 400,0 00 injured
teen drivers and occupants were s een in emergency departments i n the US in 2005 (2). In the U.S., falls lead to the highest nu mber of
childhood injury emergen cy department visits followed by [CONTACT_39245] (1). Fire or bur ns are also
an important cause of injury as the second leading cause of injury death to children between 1 and 19 (1).
Unintentional injuries, particular ly severe injuries that impac t daily functioning, can have longlasting psychological effects . Prevalence
of posttraumatic stre ss symptoms is estimat ed at 29% during the first month pos t-trauma and 13% between 3-[ADDRESS_40894]-trauma . (3)HawkIRB https://hawkirb.research.u iowa.edu/hawkirb/summary/proje cts.page?mo...

Within 12 months of being hosp italized because of injury, 19-32 % of adolescents developed PTSD. (4) A variety of injury experi ences
can lead to PTSD sympto ms including traffic crashes, burns, fal ls and animal attacks. (5) Adoles cents involved in a mass burn incident
had significantly more mental pro blems than community controls one year after the incident (6), and, 12% of schoolchildren exp osed to
an industrial fire met the crite ria for PTSD. (7) Approximately  30% of pediatric pedestrian inj ury cases have acute stress disorder or
PTSD. (8-10) Many cases of psychol ogical trauma are missed in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39176]. T his proposed project will empo wer
families with skills t o identify trauma-in duced mental health d istress and resources for referr al to advanced mental health ca re.
Our innovative project addresses the need for evidence-based pr actices to improve the acute car e of children post-injury. Psyc hological
First Aid (PFA), analogous to physical first aid (11), “uses in terpersonal skills provided by [CONTACT_39246] [trauma] in thei r own lives, as well as in the lives of their family, friends, and neighbors (p. 4–5)” (11). I nformed by
[CONTACT_39247], PFA pro vides information, education, comfort and support through human
contact [CONTACT_39248] r ecovery and promotion of mental  health (12, 13).
In 2006, psychologists developed a child-focused version of PFA  in school and community settings called “Listen, Protect, Conn ect
(LPC)-Model and Teach.” LPC outlines steps for administering PF A to children after any type of crises, either a large-scale di saster or
local emergency. The effectivene ss of PFA has not been scientif ically evaluated. We propose to create an adapted version of LP C for
families. LPC has the potential to be a national tool that possibly improves copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], access to mental health care, and acute P TSD
symptoms for children impacted by [CONTACT_39249] (see Approach  for description of LPC).
Preliminary Studies
[CONTACT_39306] (PI) has over ten y ears of experience conducting pe diatric injury, viol ence and disaster preparedness research, in cluding
studies of school-related inju ries to childr en with disabilitie s (14-16); high school sports injuries (17); and emergency prep aredness
among staff, students and parents (18-20). Recently, [CONTACT_39307] z began studies focused on the psychological trauma in school s ettings.
Studies of Psychological First Aids. In July 2008, [CONTACT_39306] conducted studies of Listen Conn ect Protect (LPC) in the school  setting, a
precursor to the work proposed her e. In the first study, 200 ra ndomly selected flood-affected children were inv ited to partici pate, but
only 8 enrolled into the study. In the second study, students s een at or referred to school nur ses’ offices potentially impact ed by [CONTACT_39250] (e.g., unintentional injury, violence, the floo ds) were enrolled. In total, 20 students were treated with LPC and
followed-up.
The L PC intervention had high f ide
lity and acceptance among cli ents and nurse providers. Speci fically, 90% of sessions followe d the
Listen Steps, 85% the Protect Steps, and 75% the Connect Steps.  Feedback from subjects and nurse providers was also extremely
positive, with 80% of children reporting f eeling comfortable sp eaking with the school nurse, an d 60% of students indicating that the
LPC sessions were helpful in dealing with recent life events. O ne student with elevated scores o f distress on the K6 screening  tool
(PTSD screener included in the LPC repertoire) was immediately referred to advanced mental hea lth care. Human subject protecti on
approval for LPC has a lready been obtained, and protocols were developed and tested. The new project will adapt materials from  this
school-based study and apply the  intervention to families of injured children seen at the UIHC.
Flood-induced stress among college students. In August 2008, Dr . Ramirez conducted a university -wide survey to measure disaste r
health impacts of the Great Flood of Iowa among University of I owa students. Of the 10,[ADDRESS_40895] commonly reported symptom was feeling
emotionally upset (12%). Another 7% reported frequent trouble s leepi[INVESTIGATOR_6926] 6% reported frequent trouble concentrating. About 7 % of
students reported increased drug and/or alcohol use following t he floods.
“So you’ve been in an accident,” the second early intervention strategy to be tested in the pro posed study, takes into account  the
challenges of hectic hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39177]. Given  time and other constraints, edu cational materials may be a sim ple,
cost-effective early interventi on option when nothing else is a vailable. [CONTACT_39308] (Co-I of th is research project) tested hi s materials at
two children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39178]. In the in tervention hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_307], pediatric trauma patients (11-17 years old) and their pa rents received
booklets within [ADDRESS_40896]-traumati c stress symptoms than control group parents. In their implemen tation evaluation of the materi als, 97%
of parents and 83% of children in the intervention arm reported reading them, and of those, 72% of parents perceived the bookl ets as
having a positive effect on them  and 57% thought the materials benefitted their children (18,19).

Phase 2Children with new unintentional i njuries (not a complication fr om previous injury) will be recr uited to participate in the ran domized trial. All
children will be between the age s of 10-17.2 (17 years, 3 month s) years of age. All children ad mitted for injury will be ident ified, and direct
questioning later will screen out  those who had intentional inj uries. Children with unintentional injuries will be administere d the COAT which
is a measure of orientation to s elf, place and memory, and those that pass the COAT will be recruited into the study. One pare nt of the child
will be recruited for participation. Inclu sion and exclusion cr iteria are the same for both ra ndomization groups. Exclusions i nclude non-English

The study involves no procedures for which consent is normally required ouside of a research context. (This type of waiver is often
permitted for a minimal risk mail-out survey th at includes a cover letter with all elem ents of consent, and returning the surve y indicates
consent. You cannot request this waiver if the study also involves the use of any protected health information (PHI).)

Phase 1
The focus group data and key informant interviews will be analy zed using content analysis and id entification of themes. Focus group and
interview data will also be used to incorporate ch anges into th e LPC for Injured Kids program.
Phase 2If we achieve randomization, we will compare the differences in  distributions between intervention and control groups using si mple chi-square
tests for categorical outcomes (l ow, medium, high levels of coi ng; being symptomatic for PTSD, Depression, etc.) and t-tests o r Wilcoxon
rank-sum tests for continuous variables depending on their norm ality (e.g. scores for PTSD, depression, social support).
If we do not achieve randomization (i.e. distribution of demogr aphics are not balanced across in tervention and control arms), we will also
adjust for confounding using Ge neralized Linear Models and appr opriate link functions ( logit for binary outcomes, linear for c ontinuous
outcomes).

1 Introduction
1.1 Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common cause of neurologic disability  in young adults.  In this 
disease, damage is caused by [CONTACT_201674].  Recent 
phase [ADDRESS_240508] 
participants with less disability  than active comparators (Hauser et al 2020 and Hauser et al 
2017).
The US Centers for Disease Control recommends that all persons aged > [ADDRESS_240509] contraindicatio
ns receive an influenza vaccination. MS is not considered a 
contraindication.  I nstead, it is considered important for people with MS to receive vaccination 
to prevent the sequelae of influenza infection, including possible relapse for MS participants.  
MS disease modify ing treatments target the immune system and in so doing may diminish 
vaccine efficacy ( Farez et al 2019).  Questions have arisen whether therapi[INVESTIGATOR_201662] B cells 
might also abrogate vaccine response.  Though other medications also impact B cells, anti-
CD20 antibodies have the most selective and potent impact on B cells.  These antibodies impact 
memory  B cells which are believed to be an important component in maintaining immunologic 
memory  but al so preserve immunoglobulin secreting plasma cells which function to recognize 
and remove pathogens.  
Research with an anti- CD20 B cell agent, ocrelizumab, indicates that an immune response can 
occur after influenza vaccination but that the proportion of participants with an adequate 
response is diminished relative to a control group (Bar-Or et 
al 2020). Specificall y, 
seroprotection rates against five influenza strains ranged from 55.5- 80% and 75 -97% in healthy 
contr ols.  
Ofatumumab is a subcutaneously  administered anti
-CD20 therap y that received FDA approval 
for treatment of relapsing forms of MS in August 2020.  Data is currently  lacking regarding 
whether MS participants on ofatumumab can mount an appropriate immun e response to 
vaccines, including the influenza vaccine.  In this study , MS participants will receive the 
influenza vaccination and follow -up titers to assess whether they  are able to mount a response 
to influenza vaccine.  Because the ability  to mount an immune response varies depending on 
the influenza strain administered ,a reference cohort of participants on injectable disease 
modify ing treatments (interferon or glatiramer acetate) is included.  In a prior study , interferon 
and glatiramer acetate did not diminish influenza vaccine response ( Olberg et al 2018. )
1.[ADDRESS_240510] influenza comprise an important strategy  for effective management of 
participants with MS.  Ofatumumab is a human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody  (mAb) that 
induces B-cell depletion.  Considering the role of B-cells in immune -mediated responses, 
participants treated with ofatumumab may be at an increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_201663].  They 
also may incur an increased chance of morbi dity and mortality  should they become infected. 
Therefore, it is important to assess if participants treated with ofatumumab are able to mount 
protective immune responses against the influenza vaccine.

ofatumumab treatment mount an immune response to the 2020-2021, 2021-2022, or 2022-2023
influenza vaccine?  
The justification for the primary  estimand is that it will capture whether ofatumumab treated 
participants generate antibodies to influenza vaccine as assessed b y HI titers.
The primary  estiman d is described by  [CONTACT_6570]:
Population: Relapsing MS participants subdivided into three cohorts. (1) Receiving 
inactive influenza vaccine two weeks prior to starting ofatumumab 20 mg 
subcutaneous 
treatment; (2) Receiving inactive influenza vaccine after at least 4 weeks of commercial 
ofatumumab 20 mg subcutaneous treatment (3) receiving inactive influenza vaccine 
while on injectable disease modify ing therapy  (iDMT).  
Variable :Achieving se roprotection as defined by a postvaccination antibod y titer ≥ 40 
(yes/no ) at Week 4
Treatment of interest : Inactivated influenza vaccination either two weeks prior to 
ofatumumab start or at least 4 weeks after ofatumumab start or while on iDMT.
Intercurrent event: None
Summary measure: Proportion of subjects achieving seroprotection

4 Rationale
4.1 Rationale for study  design
Amulticenter, multi- cohort, open -label, comparator design has been selected in order to render 
feasible recruitment before the end of the 2021- 2022 or 2022 -2023 , vaccine season and study  
completion. The study  will address two questions:
1.Can participants treated with ofatumumab develop influenza antibodies if receiving 
influenza vaccine two weeks prior to ofatumumab start? 
2.If receiving 
influenza vaccine after introduction of ofatumumab treatment, can 
participants develop influenza antibodies?
A 3rdcohort of participants on iDMT is included to provide a comparison t hat would be useful 
to investigative sites since the influenza vaccine is in limited supply .  
Rationale of study population:
The included population is selected to be consistent with the phase 3 trial program and within 
the parameter s of use specified by [CONTACT_201676] 
(USPI ). The population included is also within CDC recommendations to receive the influenza 
vaccine as part of routine clinical care.  Screening participants will be excluded if they  possess 
contraindications to either receiving ofatumumab per prescribing information or they possess 
contraindications to receiving the influenza vaccine.  Participants will also be excluded if there 
is clinical or serologic evidence they have alread y contracted a 2020-2021, 2021 - 2022, or 2022-

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 18of 51
Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. COMB157GUS12
2023 influenza strain. This is appropriate because the aim of the study  is to assess whether a 
non-vaccinated ofatumumab treated individual can mount a response after influenza vaccine.
Rationale of chosen endpoi nts:
The proposed study  primary  endpoints are widel y accepted as measures of influenza vaccine 
efficacy  and consistent with FDA and European guidelines establishing effect.  The endpoints 
will provide evidence addressing whether ofatumumab participants canmount an adequate 
immune response to the influenza vaccine.
4.2 Rationale for dose/regimen and duration of treatment
Ofatumumab dose
The dose regimen for ofatumumab in this study  is consistent with the FDA approved regimen 
in the prescribing information.
In the Investigational Period , participants assigned to Cohort [ADDRESS_240515] loading doses will be administered at Week 3 
and Week 4. 
If participants in Cohort 1opt to continue into the Extension Period , they will 
begin their monthl y dose of ofatumumab starting at Week 6 and will continue receiving 
additional monthly  doses until Week 26.
In the Investigational Period
, participants assigned to Cohort 2 will continue to take 
ofatumumab as prescribed from their personal supply . Participants in Cohort 2 that continue 
into the Extension Period will continue taking ofatumumab monthly  until Week 28 from a 
study -provided supply .
Vaccine Administration
Cohorts 1 – 3: Participants will need to receive an inactive influenza vaccine from their local 
pharmacy  within 9calendar days after the Screening Visit, before theWeek [ADDRESS_240516] 
supplied by [CONTACT_201677] . Patients 
should 
be instructed to provide pharmacy documentation of vaccine administration to the Study  Doctor 
at the next scheduled on -site study  visit.
Duration of treatment:
Cohort 1: The treatment duration is 26 weeks (inclusive of a 6-month extension ).  
Cohort 2: The treatment duration is 28 weeks (i
nclusive of a 6- month extension ).  
Cohort 3: The treatment duration is5weeks.  Participants in Cohort 3 will not enter the 
extension .
4.3 Rationale for choice of control drugs (comparator/placebo)
Since the ability  to mount an immune response varies depending on the influenza strain 
administered, a reference cohort of participants on iDMTs (interferon or glatiramer acetate) is 
included.  I n a prior study, interferon and glatiramer acetate did not diminish influenza vaccin e 
response ( Olberg et al 2018.
)

4.4 Purpose and timing of interim analy ses/design adaptations
For the purpose of earlier dissemination of results, an interim analy sis will be performed after 
either all enrolled participants have completed or discontinued the Investigational Period or 
on/around March 31, [ADDRESS_240517] supplied by [CONTACT_201678] .  
[COMPANY_001] will supply part icipants in Cohort 1 with ofatumumab treatment in the Investigational 
Period and the optional Extension P eriod as per the assessment schedule ( Table 8 -1).  [COMPANY_001] 
will provide participants in Cohort 2 with ofatumu
mab treatment from study  supplies in the 
optional Extension 
Period as per the assessment schedule or they may remain on their prescribed 
supply (Table 8 -2).  
Ocrelizumab safety  data has been previousl y published (Hauser et al 2020) demonstrating 
infusion related reactions occur in 34.3%
, serious infections occurred in 1.3%, and neoplasms 
occurred in 0.5% of participants.  The risk to participants in this trial may be minimize d 
by 
[CONTACT_69204], as well as close clinical monitoring.
Over [ADDRESS_240518] been exposed to ofatumumab across phase 2 and phase 3 
studies.  No unexpected safety  findings were observed in MS participants who received 
ofatumumab in the completed studies (Hauser et al 2020). 
Men and women of child -bearing potential must use a highl y-effective method of birth control 
method during the study .  Women of child- bearing potential must be informed that taking the 
study  treatment may  involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy  were to occur during the 
study , and agree that in order to participate in the study  they must adhere to the contraception 
requirements outlined in the exclusion criteria. If there is any  question that the participant will 
not reliably  comply , they should not be entered or continue in the study .

of age inclusive, wi th a diagnosis of relapsing MS.  
The study  aims to enroll up to 66 participants (up to 22 participants per cohort) at approximately  
12 centers in the [LOCATION_002].  Since a 25% screen failure rate is expected, approximately  88 
participants will be screen ed.

6.3 Participant numbering, treatment assignment
6.3.1 Participant numbering
Each participant is identified in the study  by a Participant Number (Participant No.), that is 
assigned when the participant is enrolled for screening and is retained for the participant 
throughout his/ her participation in the trial. The Participant No. consists of the Center Number 
(Center No.) (as assigned by [CONTACT_5359]) with a sequential participant 
number suffixed to it, so that each participant’s participation is numbered uniquely  across the 
entire database. Upon signing the informed consent form, the Participant is assigned to the next 
sequential participant No. available by [CONTACT_737]. At the Screening Visit 
(Visit 1/Week - 1), the Investigator or his/her staff will contact [CONTACT_201682]  (IRT) system and provide the assigned participant study  identification number 
along with the requested identify ing information to register the participant into IRT. The site 
must use the eCRF with the matching participant number from the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system to enter data.
Once assigned to a participant, a participant number will not be reused. If a participant fails to 
be enrolled for any reason, the IRT system must be notified within 2 days and thereason for 
not being enrolled will be entered on the Screening Phase Disposition Form and the appropriate 
eCRF(s) pages should also be completed.
6.3.2 Treatment assignment
An IRT system will be used to track patient visits, patient status and dispense open -label 
treatment to Cohort 1 when indicated in the assessment schedule ( Table 8 -1).  The sy stem will 
also be used to dispense treatment to participants in both Cohort [ADDRESS_240526] promote compliance by [CONTACT_157090] y as prescribed and b y stating that compliance is necessary  for the participant’s

found in the USPI  [INVESTIGATOR_201664]'s Brochure (IB). This information will be included in the 
participant informed consent and should be discussed with the participant during the study  as 
needed. Any new information regarding the safety  profile of the investigational drug that is 
identified between IB updates will be communicated as appropriate, for example, via an 
investigator notification or an aggregate safet y finding. New information might require an 
update to the informed consent and then must be discussed with the participant.
The following informed consents are included in this study :
Main study  consent, which also included: 
A subsection that requires a separate signature [CONTACT_30833] ‘Optional Consent for 
Additional Research’ to allow future research on data/samples collected during this 
study

8.1 Rescre ening
Rescreening is not permitted.
8.2 Information to be collected on screening failures
Participants who sign an informed consent form and subsequentl y found to be ineligible prior 
to enrollment will be considered a screen failure. The reason for screen failure should be 
recorded on the appropriate Case Report Form. The demographic information, informed 
consent, and Inclusion/Exclusion pages must also be completed for screen failure participants. 
No other data will be entered into the clinical database fo r participants who are screen failures, 
unless the participant experienced a serious adverse event during the screening phase (see SAE 
section for reporting details). If the participant fails to be enrolled, the IRT must be notified 
within 2 day s of the sc reen fail that the participant was not enrolled.
Participants who are enrolled and fail to start treatment, e.g. participants enrolled in error, will 
be considered an early terminator. The reason for early termination should be recorded on the 
appropriate Case Report Form.
8.3 Participant demographics/other baseline characteristics
Participant demographic data and baseline characteristics to be collected on the participants 
include: age, sex, race and ethnicity . Relevant medical history /current medical conditio n data 
includes data collected up to the point in which informed consent is signed. Where possible, 
diagnoses, and not sy mptoms will be recorded. Investigators will have the discretion to record 
abnormal test findings on the CRF capturing medical history  whenever in their judgment, the 
test abnormality  occurred prior to the informed consent signature.

An MS relapse is defined as an a ppearance of a new neurological abnormality  or worsening of 
previously  stable or improving pre-existing neurological abnormalit y, separated by [CONTACT_2669] 30 
days from onset of a preceding clinical demyelinating event (Polman et al 2011 ). The 
abnormality  must have been present forat least 24 hours and occurred in the absence of fever 
(< 37.5 °C) or a known infection.

Skin and/or mucosal reactions which raise the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_188598] (Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome, or toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_188599]-Lyell's sy ndrome)
Hypersens itivity  to the study  medication
Protocol violation that results in a significant risk to the participant's safety
Emergence of certain adverse events, such as malignancy  (except successfully  treated 
basal cell carcinoma, in situ squamous cell carcinoma and in situ carcinoma of cervix of 
uterus), liver failure or serious chronic infection (such as human immunodeficiency  
virus(HIV))
Severe h ypoproteinemi a
Non-compliance with study  drug or study  procedures
If discontinuation of study  treatment occurs, the investigator should make a reasonable effort 
to understand the primary  reason for the participant’s premature discontinuation of study 
treatment and record this information.
Participants who discontinue study  treatment or who decide they do not wish to partici pate in 
the study  further should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study  UNLESS they withdraw 
their consent (see Section 9.1.2 'Withdrawal of Informed Consent' section). Where possible, 
they should return for the EOS Visit applicable to the period in which the patient is 
currently in.  Participants in Cohort 1 that discontinue in the Investigational Period , 
should return for allassessments indicated for the EOS 1 Visit except for study drug 
administration . Participants in Cohort 1 and 2 that discon tinue in the Extension Period , 
should return for all assessments indicated for the EOS2 Visit except for study drug 
administration . At EOS visit sall dispensed study drug to participants in Cohort 1 and Cohort 
2 should be reconciled and the adverse event and concomitant medications should be recorded 
on the CRF (for participants in both arms). If they fail to return for these assessments for 
unknown reasons, every effort (e.g. telephone, e-mail, letter) should be made to contact [CONTACT_2416]/pre -designated contact [CONTACT_49425] -up section. This contact

9.1.2 Withdrawal of informed consent
Participants may  voluntarily  withdraw consent to participate in the study  for any  reason at any  
time. Withdrawal of consent occurs onl y when a participant:
Does not want to participate in the study  anymore,
and
Does not want an y further visits or assessments
and
Does not want an y further study related contacts
In this situation, the investigator should make a reasonable effort (e.g. telephone, e -mail, letter) 
to understand the primary reason for the participant’s decision to withdraw his/her consent and 
record this information.
Where consent to the use of personal and coded data is not required, participant therefore cannot 
withdraw consent. They  still retain the right to o bject to the further use of personal data.

Should early termination be necessary, participants must be seen as soon as possible for an end 
of study  visit within 7 calendar daysand treated as a prematurely  withdrawn participant. The 
investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure that 
adequate consideration is given to the protection of the participant’s interests. The investigator 
or sponsor depending on local regulation will beresponsible for informing I RBs of the early 
termination of the trial.

10 Safety  monitoring and reporting
10.1 Definition of adverse events and reporting requirements
10.1.1 Adverse events
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g. any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory  findings], symptom or disease) in a clinical 
investigation participant after providing written informed consent for participation in the study . 
Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally  or causall y associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product.
The investigator has the responsibility  for managing the safety  of individual participant and 
identify ing adverse events.
[COMPANY_001] qualified medical personnel will be readily  available to advi se on trial related medical 
questions or problems.
The occurrence of adverse events must be sought by [CONTACT_105]-directive questioning of the participant 
at each visit during the study . Adverse events also may  be detected when they  are volunteered 
by [CONTACT_201692], laboratory  
test findings, or other assessments .
Adverse events must be recorded under the signs, symptoms, or diagnosis associated with them, 
accompanied by [CONTACT_6644] (as far as possible) (if the event is serious refer to 
Section 10.1.2):
1.The Common Toxicity  Criteria (CTC) AE grade (1
-4)
If CTCAE grading does not exist for an adverse event, use:
1 = mild: usually  transient in na ture and generall y not interfering with normal 
activities
2 = moderate: sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with normal activities
3 = severe: prevents normal activities

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 41of 51
Amended Protocol Version 03(Clean) Protocol No. COMB157GUS12
4 = life threatening
2.Its relationship to the study  treatment .If the event is due to lack of efficacy or progression 
of underl ying illness (i.e. progression of the study  indication) the assessment of causalit y 
will usually  be ‘Not suspected.’ The rationale for this guidance is that the sy mptoms of a 
lack of efficacy  or progression of un derly ing illness are not caused by  [CONTACT_6645], they  
happen in spi[INVESTIGATOR_6532]/or both lack of efficacy  and progression of 
underly ing disease can only  be evaluated meaningfull y by [CONTACT_49430], not on a 
single participant
3.Its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing, an outcome of not 
recovered/not resolved must be reported
4.Whether it constitutes a SAE (see Section 10.1.2 for definition of SAE) and which 
serio usness criteria have been met
5.Action taken regarding with study  treatment.
All adverse events must be treated appropriately . Treatment may include one or more of the 
following:
Dose not changed
Dose Reduced/increased
Drug interrupted/withdrawn
6.Its outcome (not recovered/not resolved; recovered/resolved; recovered/resolved with 
sequelae; fatal; or unknown).
Conditions that were already  present at the time of informed consent should be recorded in the 
source medical history  of the participant.
10.1.2 Serious advers e events
An SAE is defined as any adverse event [appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing)] 
undesirable sign(s), symptom(s), or medical conditions(s) which meets any one of the following 
criteria:
fatal
life-threatening
Life-threatening in the conte xt of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the participant was at risk 
of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe (please refer to the I CH-E2D Guidelines).
results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
constitutes a congenital anomaly /birth defect
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]: 
routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any  
deterioration in condition 
elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study  and has not worsened since signing the informed consent

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 42of 51
Amended Protocol Version 03(Clean) Protocol No. COMB157GUS12
social reasons and respi [INVESTIGATOR_157050]’s 
general condition
treatment on an emergency  outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any  of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]
is medically  signi ficant, e.g. defined as an event that jeopardizes the participant or may  
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should 
beconsidered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately  
life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_157051]. Such events should be 
considered as “medicall y significant.” Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that 
do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37209] (please refer to the ICH-
E2D Guidelines ).
All new malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medicall y significant” if other 
seriousness criteria are not met and the malignant neoplasm is not a disease progression of the 
study indication.
Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a 
serious adverse reaction.
All reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered serious adverse 
event irrespective if a clinical event has occurred as per Section 10.1. 
10.1.[ADDRESS_240551] be reported separatel y as a new event.
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochur e or Package Insert (new 
occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study  treatment, a Chief Medical Office and 
Patient Safety associate may urgentl y require further information from the investigator for 
health authorit y reporti ng. [COMPANY_001] may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to 
inform all investigators involved in any  study  with the same study  treatment that this SAE has 
been reported.
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and reported to 
the compete nt authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with EU Guidance 
2011/C 172/01 or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries.

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 43of 51
Amended Protocol Version 03(Clean) Protocol No. COMB157GUS12
Any SAEs experienced >[ADDRESS_240552] study visit should only  be reported to [COMPANY_001]

10.1.5 Reporting of study treatment errors including misuse/abuse
Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispe nsing, administration or 
monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, participant or 
consumer (EMA definition).
Misuse refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally  and inappropriatel y used 
not in accor dance with the protocol.
Abuse corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicinal 
product, which is accompanied by  [CONTACT_50104].
Study  treatment errors and uses outside of what is foreseen in th e protocol will be recorded on 
the appropriate CRF irrespective of whether or not associated with an AE/SAE and reported to 
Safety  only if associated with an SAE. Misuse or abuse will be collected and reported in the 
safet y database irrespective of it being associated with an AE/SAE within 24 hours of 
Investigator’s awareness.

11 Data Collection and Database management
11.1 Data collection
Designated investigator staff will enter the data required by [CONTACT_37290] (eCRF). The eCRFs have been built using fully validated secure web-
enabled software that conforms to [ADDRESS_240556] been trained. Automatic validation programs 
check for data discrepancies in the eCRFs, allow modification and/or verification of the entered 
data b y the investigator staff.
The investigator/designee is responsible for assuring that the data (recorded on CRFs) (entered 
into eCRF) is complete, accurate, and that entry and updates are performed in a timely  manner. 
The Investigator must certify  that the data entered are complete and accurate.
After final database lock, the investigator will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_157052].
All data should be recorded, handled, and stored in a way that allows its accurate reporting, 
interpretation, and verification.
11.2 Database management and quality  control
Novart ispersonnel (or designated CRO) will review the data entered by [CONTACT_49432] . Electronic data queries stating the nature of the problem and 
requesting clarification will be created for discrepancies and missing value s and sent to the 
investigational site via the EDC system. Designated investigator site staff are required to 
respond promptly  to queries and to make any  necessary  changes to the data.
Concomitant treatments and prior medications entered into the database will be coded using the 
World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Reference List, which employ s the Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Medical history /current medical conditions and 
adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) 
terminology .

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 45of 51
Amended Protocol Version 03(Clean) Protocol No. COMB157GUS12
Laboratory  samples will be processed centrally  and the results will be sent electronicall y to 
[COMPANY_001].
Enrollment and data about all study  treatment(s) dispensed to the participant will be tracked 
using an IRT. The system will be supplied by a vendor, who will also manage the database. 
[COMPANY_001] may  request to receive the IRT data electronically  at specific timelines.
Once all the necessary  actions have been completed and the database has been declared to be 
complete and accurate, it will be locked and made available for analysis. Any changes to the 
database after that time can only be made after written agreement by [CONTACT_49434].
11.3 Site monitoring
Before study  initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a [COMPANY_001] 
representative will review the protocol and data capture requirements (i.e. eCRFs) with the 
investigators and their staff. During the study , [COMPANY_001] employ s several methods of ensuring 
protocol and GCP com pliance and the quality/integrit y of the sites’ data. The field monitor will 
visit the site to check the completeness of participant records, the accuracy  of data capture / 
data entry , the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of 
enrollment, and to ensure that study  treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for 
according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor 
during these visits. Continuous remote monitoring of each site’s data may be performed by a 
centralized [COMPANY_001] CRA organization. Additionally , a central analytics organization may 
analyze data & identify  risks & trends for site operational parameters, and provide reports to 
[COMPANY_001] clinical teams to assist with tr ial oversight.
The investigator must maintain source documents for each participant in the study , consisting 
of case and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing demographic and medical 
information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or 
assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the 
participant's file . The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed b y 
the participant (a signed copy  is given to the participant).
The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their 
consistency  with the data capture and/or data entry . [COMPANY_001] monitoring standards require full 
verification for the presence of info rmed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary  variables. Additional 
checks of the consistency  of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the 
study -specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity  of the 
participants will be disclosed.

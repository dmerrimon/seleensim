22-432 Effects of narratives on demand for low and high ventilated cigarettes and substitution for alternative products.  
VT Research Protocol version 1.0.1 Page 5 of 39 Revised: March 5, 2019 The primary hypothesis is that narratives will decrease purchases of ventilated cigarettes and increase purchases of alternative products compared to the control narrative (fact sheet). 3.0 Background 3.1 Summarize the relevant prior research on this topic and gaps in current knowledge within the field of study: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was granted authority in [ADDRESS_1282248] feature that could be changed is cigarette filter ventilation. A recent review examined the effects of cigarette filter ventilation and concluded that filter ventilation, by [CONTACT_160105] a cigarette burns, yields more mutagens and carcinogens, and results in greater puff volume and possibly depth of inhalation, which has led to increases in peripheral lung adenocarcinomas (1). This, along with the ability to manipulate systemic levels of nicotine by [CONTACT_160106], as well as misconceptions about the lower toxicity of filter ventilation, may have also contributed to the use, appeal, and abuse liability of ventilated cigarettes. The extent to which commercial cigarettes are ventilated vary substantially in the market by [CONTACT_59584], ranging from 0 to 80%. However, smokers compensate for the lower nicotine yields associated with higher ventilation by [CONTACT_160107], number of cigarettes per day, and blocking some portion of the ventilation holes. This compensatory behavior exposes smokers to more tobacco smoke constituents than would be indicated by [CONTACT_912677]. Regulatory action that reduces or eliminates cigarette ventilation would not only reduce exposure to smoke constituents by [CONTACT_160109], but also change the smoker’s experience, likely resulting in harsher taste that may be proportional to the ventilation in a given cigarette brand. The potentially large effect on taste and preference corresponding to cigarette ventilation could alter the appeal and abuse liability of these products and could inform regulatory actions. However, eliminating filter ventilation raises a variety of questions that constitute a gap in our knowledge and must be answered to assess the potential for adverse unintended consequences of removing filter ventilation. We will explore these questions within a behavioral economic framework.  Behavioral economic demand analyses can be used to understand the level of motivation to consume a product on either an individual or small group level, including cigarettes (2,3). This level of analysis allows for experimental manipulations to be made on variables of interest. By [CONTACT_912678] a product, important indices of demand are obtained. These indices can be grouped into two main measures of consumption, demand intensity and demand elasticity, which are associated with use level and dependence severity (3,4,5,6). Demand intensity is the amount of the commodity consumed when available at very low cost (approaching free), and demand elasticity quantifies the degree to which the individual is willing to increase monetary or effort-based expenditures to maintain the same level of consumption as costs increase. Elasticity of demand has been shown to be a characteristic of the drug itself and independent of drug dose for many drugs including nicotine (2,7,8). 
22-432 Effects of narratives on demand for low and high ventilated cigarettes and substitution for alternative products.  
VT Research Protocol version 1.0.1 Page 6 of 39 Revised: March 5, 2019 While drug demand plotted as a function of unit price has been often shown to be a function of the total drug consumed, some of our prior research with cigarette demand calls this conclusion into question. A prior study we conducted (9) compared conventional cigarettes to denicotinized cigarettes. We found that, if these denicotinized cigarettes were the only tobacco product available, the denicotinized cigarettes had comparable demand to nicotinized cigarettes. If both were available, however, participants preferred the nicotinized cigarettes. This suggests that cigarette demand is not strictly regulated by [CONTACT_55931], and that there is substantial abuse liability associated with other aspects of cigarettes (e.g., sensory components) apart from any nicotine content. Relevant to this point, we conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], where conventional ventilated cigarette smokers purchased either their usual cigarettes (ventilated) or their usual cigarettes with the filter vents blocked. When each cigarette type was available alone in separate sessions, demand for both products was very similar. However, in a separate session in which both cigarette types were available concurrently at equivalent unit prices, ventilated cigarettes were clearly preferred at all prices. These findings suggest that to fully understand the abuse liability of cigarettes will require that they are studied in contexts where other products are available (e.g., substitution).  Substitution is defined as an increase in the consumption of a constant-priced product while the cost of a different commodity is increased. For example, we have shown that as the price of conventional cigarettes is increased and its consumption decreased, the consumption of nicotine gum increased even though its price remained constant (10). Substitution defines one end of a continuum of interactions between two commodities. At the other end of that continuum, commodities can also function as complements. Complementarity refers to the decreased consumption of a constant-priced product in response to an increase in the price of a different commodity. For example, the research team has previously shown that as the price of cigarettes increased, consumption of coffee decreased even though its price remained constant (11). Between these two extremes is independence, which occurs when changes in the price of one commodity have little or no effect on consumption of another commodity where price has remained unchanged. Substitution, complementarity, and independence are measured by [CONTACT_12783]-price elasticity of demand and are represented by [CONTACT_160111], negative, or near zero, respectively. Studies to date have almost exclusively examined only pairs of products and, in even fewer cases, three concurrently available commodities. For example, in one of our studies smokers had access to conventional cigarettes, denicotinized cigarettes, and nicotine gum13. When the price of conventional cigarettes increased, consumption of both denicotinized cigarettes and nicotine gum increased even though their prices were fixed. Thus, denicotinized cigarettes and nicotine gum functioned as substitutes for conventional cigarettes. Indeed, by [CONTACT_55949], the smoker could reproduce both the central and sensory effects of standard cigarettes by [CONTACT_160112] (i.e., sensory effects) and nicotine gum (i.e., central effects). Importantly, denicotinized cigarettes functioned as a better substitute than gum (the use of denicotinized cigarettes increased the most). This effect could not have been predicted from the individual demand curves with these commodities. Only when they were measured together did these complex interactions emerge. Lastly, in this experiment consumption of conventional cigarettes was greatest

VT Research Protocol version 1.0.1 Page 7 of 39 Revised: March 5, [ADDRESS_1282249] (e.g., 1 cigarette puff per self-administration), long and numerous sessions (e.g., one, 3-hour session for each price examined). As such, these methods cannot and do not come close to replicating the ever more complex tobacco marketplace and underscore the gap in the understanding of how to examine these relationships among a large number of products that approximate the real world.   To address this methodological gap and to inform how various products may interact, we have developed and tested a novel method called the Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (ETM). The ETM is similar to an online store, that displays pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], information, and prices for several tobacco/nicotine products. In a recent study of ours (14), smokers were endowed with an amount of money comparable to their weekly tobacco purchases. They then made tobacco product purchasing decisions while the price of conventional cigarettes was varied and the price of 5 other tobacco products remained constant. Purchasing decisions from one, randomly selected cigarette price was actualized and smokers were provided the products purchased and any unspent account balance. Smokers returned one week later to report tobacco/nicotine use and return unused products for a refund. Cigarette consumption decreased as a function of price. As the price of cigarettes increased, consumption of snus, electronic cigarettes, and nicotine lozenges showed the greatest substitution. Importantly, this approach moves beyond the constraints of previous laboratory studies by [CONTACT_160115]/nicotine preference and consumption under conditions that typi[INVESTIGATOR_160098]’ lives, including not being nicotine deprived, consuming the products in their natural environment, selecting the products they wish from a large number of products, and consuming the products while engaging in normal daily activities.  In this experiment, we will ascertain the impact of narratives on cigarette demand and substitution in the ETM across a range of tobacco products among high-ventilated cigarette smokers. For this purpose, ventilated cigarettes will be defined as having 16 to 38% filter ventilation.    References  1. Song M, Benowitz N, Berman M, ...et al.

VT Research Protocol version 1.0.1 Page 9 of 39 Revised: March 5, 2019 novel policies obtained under conditions that simulate “real world” circumstances. This approach provides insight into how a given policy may alter consumption, preferences, and substitution among tobacco products.  Two previous studies have examined the effect of narratives using the ETM showing their influence on increasing electronic cigarette substitution [7,8].   As part of this grant, one previous study [9] has examined the effect of removing filter ventilation on nicotine product consumption. Our findings show that initial exposure to unventilated cigarettes reduced the number of cigarettes purchased and increased exploration of alternative tobacco products. However, successive exposure to unventilated cigarettes led to increased cigarette purchases. This suggests that regulating filter ventilation may initially increase exploration of alternative tobacco products but lead to exploitation of unventilated cigarettes over time. Moreover, tobacco control strategies could take advantage of this transition period when smokers seek information on unfamiliar products to implement harm reduction strategies.   6.

These should be included for all studies that are greater than minimal risk. (Minimal risk: The probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research that are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.):  This study will recruit adults who regularly smoke high-ventilated cigarettes. This study’s procedures are not designed to increase daily nicotine use and we do not anticipate any increased risk to participants directly from this study, although there are risks of nicotine use and these are included in the risk section of this protocol and consent.  4.0 Study Design and Statistical Analysis Plan 4.1 Describe the basic study design/approach (e.g., qualitative study using five focus groups of first year students to describe assimilation into the university community; randomized controlled trial of a behavioral change intervention to increase dietary intake of whole grains; pre- post-test evaluation of new pedagogical techniques to improve adult literacy):  In a between-group within-subject repeated measures design, participants will be randomized to one of three groups (narrative, fact sheet, or control) and complete five ETM conditions, which include six trials assessing different cigarette prices: a) high-ventilated cigarette alone, b) low-ventilated cigarette alone, c) high- and low-ventilated cigarette with high-ventilated cigarettes increasing in price, d) high- and low-ventilated

Session [ADDRESS_1282256] use phase. 1) In the consent and initial assessment session, participants will go through standard consent procedures and then provide a breath to confirm recent levels of smoking. Participants will complete a timeline follow back to assess previous month recent smoking, and consumption of nicotine products, and to determine ETM budget. A survey will administer demographics questions and nicotine/tobacco-related assessments (Wisconsin Index of Smoking Dependence Motives, Fagerstrom Test of Cigarette Dependence, Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale, Perceived Health Risk ratings). At the end of the session, participants will experience a trial of the ETM that will be used in the next session.  For the sampling phase, participants will be provided two days worth of study cigarettes based on their number of cigarettes smoked per day, half of high-ventilated cigarettes and half of low-ventilated cigarettes. Participants will also be provided with a sample of other commercially available tobacco product to try. Participants will be instructed the order in which to use the products on the next three days. The order will be counterbalanced across participants.  During the sampling phase, participants will receive text messages asking how many of each product they sampled during those days.   2) Before the ETM session, participants will be randomized to the narrative, the fact sheet  or the control group. In the ETM session, they will listen to a recording of a narrative of an individual who quit tobacco products or a fact-sheet with overall rates of smoking and its negative consequences. Participants in the control group will not be exposed to any recording. Then, participants will buy tobacco products to use throughout the next 7 days. Participants will complete a total of 30 purchasing trials each for 7 days' worth of products. They will be exposed to 5 conditions with cigarettes increasing in price. A balanced Latin square design will be used to present the following conditions: a) a) high-ventilated cigarette alone, b) low-ventilated cigarette alone, c) high- and low-ventilated cigarettes with high-ventilated cigarettes increasing in price, d) high- and low-ventilated cigarettes with low-ventilated cigarettes increasing in price, and e) usual, high- and low-ventilated cigarettes with usual cigarettes increasing in price.

Virginia Tech Students might participate in the study if they meet the inclusion criteria, although students will not be directly recruited because of their status. However, no students that have had or have any relationship with this lab will be included. Pregnant individuals will not be included in this study.    13.0 Number of Subjects 13.1 Indicate the total number of subjects to be enrolled and how this number was determined (e.g., sample size calculation [show], number of available subjects in a finite pool, number of tests funding award would allow):   In this study, we require n=90 (N=100 accounting for 10% attrition) participants to complete the study when using repeated measures with three groups and two measurements per participant.  Our sample sizes are based on a repeated-measures within-between interaction ANOVA design using medium effect size (f=0.25) and 95% power. To account for multiple testing, we will control for five comparisons in each experiment; therefore, we use an alpha of 0.01.   We have been successfully recruiting cigarette smokers in our community for the past 10 years. Based on our experience with prior studies, we anticipate that 10% of participants don't complete the study.

At the beginning of the study, the participant will receive a prepaid MasterCard debit card that can be used anywhere that accepts MasterCard. As payments are earned in the course of the study, additional funds will be added to the account for that participant. Funds are immediately available when added and participants can check their balance as desired.    15.0 Withdrawal of Subjects 15.1 Describe circumstances under which you anticipate subjects could be withdrawn from the research without their consent:  Participants could be withdrawn from the study if they exhibit or report unstable medical illness, unmanaged psychiatric or neurological disorder, violation of research center policies or failure to attend scheduled sessions or to complete any of the study procedures. We will also stop participation if their answers or performance suggest that it is not safe and appropriate for them to continue in the study.  15.2 If applicable, describe any procedures for orderly termination (e.g., discontinuation of a study drug or debriefing after a behavioral intervention):  If a participant is withdrawn from the study, they will be informed the reasons for terminating their participation. If a participant is withdrawn or voluntarily discontinues, their compensation for the study will be pro-rated accordingly.  15.3 Describe procedures that you will follow when subjects withdraw from the research, including partial withdrawal from procedures with continued data collection (e.g., participant declines to continue with regular blood draws, but continues with periodic behavioral questionnaires):  If a participant is discontinued, they will be withdrawn from the entire study and their data may be analyzed partially.

VT Research Protocol version 1.0.1 Page 26 of 39 Revised: March 5, [ADDRESS_1282270] the reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, hazards, or inconveniences to the subjects related the subjects’ participation in the research. Include for the IRB’s consideration a description of the probability, magnitude, duration, and reversibility of the risks. Consider physical, psychological, social, legal, privacy, and economic risks. Do not indicate “No risk” or “N/A.” Instead, for studies with very low risk (e.g., anonymous online questionnaire on a mundane topic) indicate “The investigators are not aware of any risks from participation in this study.” or “No more than risks than are found in everyday life.” The example consent form presents a tabular method for risk information, which you can also use here. Common risk types include: ● Physical (e.g., potential for pain, discomfort, infection) ● Psychological (e.g., potential for stress, discomfort, and/or embarrassment) ● Social (e.g., potential for discrimination or stigmatization and disruption of personal and family relationships) ● Legal (e.g., potential for disclosure of illegal activity, negligence) ● Privacy (e.g., potential for personal information being accessed, used, or disclosed without the subjects’ knowledge or consent, breach of confidentiality/security) ● Economic (e.g., potential for individuals to lose access to economic services, employment, insurability)  There will be no direct costs for participation, although there are risks.   1. Possible embarrassment: This may result from answering questions that participant considers sensitive. Some of our questions will ask for information about medical and psychiatric conditions and/or drug use.   2. Possible discomfort: There is also the possibility that participant may become bored or frustrated during the research sessions.  3. Loss of confidentiality: The research team will employ every effort to maintain participant confidentiality, however the loss of confidentiality is a potential risk.  4. Adverse effects associated with nicotine use: Because the present experiment allows and sometimes involves self-administering nicotine products, participants might experience adverse effects associated with the use of such products (e.g., nausea, vomiting, dizziness, diarrhea, weakness, rapid heartbeat, minor increase in throat or sinus irritation).   
22-432 Effects of narratives on demand for low and high ventilated cigarettes and substitution for alternative products.  
VT Research Protocol version 1.0.1 Page 27 of 39 Revised: March 5, 2019 5. Adverse effects associated with nicotine withdrawal: participants might experience adverse effects associated with withdrawal from nicotine (e.g., dizziness, headache, irritability, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], decreased alertness, difficulty concentrating, impatience, sleeplessness, and increased eating).   6. High- and low- ventilated cigarettes and other tobacco products exposure: Participants may not enjoy sampling the study products.  Due to the investigative nature of this study, there may be other risks that are currently unknown.  16.2  Indicate the measures you will use to minimize risks and monitor subjects for safety. (e.g., asking a subject at regular intervals to rate how they are feeling from 1 to 10, or to slowly crouch in order to check their balance.)  Informed Consent. All consenting methods will be conducted using standard operating procedures, and all staff (including recruitment staff) will be provided with human subjects protection training. All participants will enroll on a voluntary basis and sign an IRB-approved consent form prior to study participation. Protections against risk. Participants will be screened, using medical history and structured interviews for a history of medical contraindications (e.g., pregnancy, recent myocardial infarction) and current unstable medical illnesses. Participants will be free to withdraw from the study at any time. In addition, if participants develop medical problems or experience adverse events during the course of the study, assessments to determine whether participants should continue in the study and/or continue to use study products will be conducted and necessary referrals will be provided. Participants will also be told that they can stop using the study products at any time.   The risks enumerated above will be addressed by [CONTACT_716]: 1. Possible embarrassment: Participants are free to refuse to answer questions and withdraw from the study at any time.  2. Possible discomfort: Participants will able to selected a date and time of their choice to start the study. They will also be given breaks during sessions, if desired. To increase data validity and reliability, breaks will be incorporated within the ETM session.  3. Loss of confidentiality: The use of ID numbers for participants, and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_56568] a locked cabinet in locked offices, will protect confidentiality. Password protected computer databases will have coded identifiers. Master databases linking subject names to study ID numbers will be kept separate from the data. These screening, monitoring, and confidentiality procedures have been in effect for decades and for thousands of participants across the various protocols employed by [CONTACT_912683].

Adverse effects associated with nicotine withdrawal: Participants will be informed of the potential adverse effects of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_847210].     6. High- and low-ventilated cigarettes and other tobacco products: Participants are only required to try, but not to keep using  products throughout the study, if they don't want to. Participants will be asked about any health changes throughout the study.  16.[ADDRESS_1282271] risks to the subjects that are currently unforeseeable. This will be rare, and usually applicable when testing a new drug or device or a new use of an existing drug or device:  The use of study product may have risks to participants that are currently unforeseeable. However, see section 17.[ADDRESS_1282272] be or become pregnant:  Nicotine/tobacco use can be a risk to an embryo or fetus. However, during the consent session, female participants will be tested for current pregnancy. Currently pregnant females will be discontinued from participation.   16.5 If applicable, describe risks to others who are not subjects (e.g., collection of sensitive health data that might affect sexual partners if disclosed, mandatory reporting of abuse, DNA testing that might affect family members or relationships):  N/A  17.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects 17.1 Describe the potential benefits that individual subjects might experience from participating in the research.

However, the current study may help identify effective methods of assessing the use of tobacco products as well as policy changes, which may help the health of people in the future.    17.[ADDRESS_1282274] benefits for participants:   There are no anticipated direct benefits for participation in this study.  18.0 Data Management and Confidentiality 18.1 Describe procedures that you will use for quality control to ensure validity of collected data:  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_847211]. These procedures will be reviewed regularly in a number of settings. For instance, issues pertaining to data validity and integrity will be addressed formally during regularly scheduled study personnel meetings in which all study personnel, including the PI, will be in attendance. Issues pertaining to participant safety also will be addressed at these meetings.   18.2 Describe any existing data or biospecimens you will obtain as part of this study. Include:  ● Variables or samples to be obtained  ● Source of the data or specimens ● Your authorization to access or receive the data or biospecimens ● Whether the data or biospecimens are publicly available ● Whether the data or specimens you receive will contain identifiers   We may collect urine samples that will also be discarded after testing on the same day as collection. We will measure breath samples for carbon monoxide to assess recent levels of smoking.

All behavioral data collected in this study (including participants' characteristics, tobacco related assessments and tobacco purchasing) will be retained and destroyed in accordance with the center's policy that requires a 3-year retention period following final publication of the data. To secure study data computer databases will have coded identifiers, only ID numbers will be used, data will be kept in secure locations and/or in locked offices. Access to study data will be limited to study personnel who have completed the IRB Human Subjects Training and who have been delegated the responsibility of data collection, management, or analyses by [CONTACT_978]. Currently, there are no plans for data to be sent/transmitted outside the research group. In the event that someone requests the data, only de-identified data will be shared by [CONTACT_847225] [INVESTIGATOR_847212] a secure virtual server. Personnel identifiers may be kept long term if participants express interest in being considered for future research.

VT Research Protocol version 1.0.1 Page 31 of 39 Revised: March 5, [ADDRESS_1282276] subjects’ privacy interests. “Privacy interest” refers to a person’s desire to place limits on with whom they interact or to whom they provide personal information (e.g., collecting the minimal amount of private information required to complete the study, protecting the data once it is obtained):   The amount of private information collected in this study is minimal. The information collected is necessary to assure subject safety, completion of the study and proper compensation. Procedures to keep the information safe are described in section 9.4.  19.2 Describe steps that you will take to make subjects feel at ease with the research situation in terms of the questions being asked and the procedures being performed. “At ease” does not refer to physical discomfort, but the sense of intrusiveness a subject might experience in response to questions, examinations, and procedures (e.g., use of a same gender investigator to place sensors on the torso, a private changing area if clothing must be changed, sensitivity when discussing  pregnancy testing with subjects, making it clear on surveys that participants can discontinue at any time, not asking questions about private or sensitive issues unless necessary for the research):  The locations where this study will be conducted have private offices, individualized computer testing and interview rooms. In cases in which private information is collected, the participant is in a private interview room with a trained research staff member. The lab is equipped with white-noise machines to reduce excess noise and maintain confidentiality. All participants are informed that their information is confidential.  19.3 Describe how you plan to access existing sources of information about the subjects (e.g., medical records, grades) and how you will protect participant privacy through the data security plan:  Participants who have previously given consent to be contact[CONTACT_912684]. Eligibility criteria, based on demographics and current nicotine/tobacco use, may be reviewed to contact [CONTACT_912685].

VT Research Protocol version 1.0.1 Page 32 of 39 Revised: March 5, 2019  19.4 Describe any required reporting that might occur as a result of your research questions, study populations, and data collection methods. Examples for Virginia and Virginia Tech include: • Any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_40179] (e.g., circumstantial, disclosed) of child abuse (physical, emotional, sexual) and neglect  • Sexual discrimination and/or sexual violence that involves a student • Disclosure or signs of intention to harm oneself (i.e., suicidal ideation and/or plan) • Disclosure or signs of desire to harm others (i.e., homicidal ideation and/or plan) • Suspected abuse, neglect or exploitation of vulnerable adults (e.g., individuals with a disability, elderly persons)   We do not expect any required reporting to occur as a result of our research questions and data collection methods. However, as a safeguard, we include in our consent form that any instances of child or elderly abuse or intent to harm self or others will be reported.  Any cases of disclosure or signs of sexual discrimination and/or sexual violence will be reported according to Title IX report procedures.      20.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects Safety monitoring is required when research involves greater than minimal risk and is sometimes appropriate for other studies. 20.1 Describe: ● The plan to periodically evaluate the data collected regarding both harms and benefits to determine whether subjects remain safe  (e.g., periodic reporting to the IRB, establishing a data monitoring committee, reporting data monitoring committee findings to the IRB and the sponsor). ● What data you will review, including safety data, unexpected events, and data that show the ability to produce the intended results. ● How the safety information will be collected (e.g., with case report forms, at study visits, by [CONTACT_40225]). ● The frequency of data collection, including when safety data collection starts. ● Who will review the safety data and with what frequency. ● The statistical tests for analyzing the safety data to determine whether harm is occurring. ● Any conditions that will trigger an immediate suspension of the research (e.g., a serious adverse event).

To accommodate "walk-in" study screens and/or participants unable to receive email or physical mail (e.g., without physical address, email address, or access to a computer), we will provide a hard copy of the consent form to review. In all cases, participants will be given as much time as possible to review the consent and ask any questions. Participants will also be informed that they may choose to take the consent with them and return at a later date to enroll into the study. During the consent process, participants will be given adequate time in a quiet room to read (or further review) the written consent form.  Research staff will review each element of the written consent form with the potential participant. The potential participant will be given the opportunity to ask questions and will have as much time as they need to decide whether they would like to participate in the study. Staff will reiterate that the potential participant can choose to decline participation in the study at that time or at any time thereafter without consequence. The potential participant and person obtaining consent will sign the consent form after the potential participant verbally states that they understand the conditions of the study, have no more questions, and chooses to participate. Participants unable to provide informed consent for themselves will not be eligible.  Non-English Speaking Subjects ● Indicate what language(s) other than English are understood by [CONTACT_40228].

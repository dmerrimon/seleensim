DISORDER AND CO-OCCURRING ANXIETY
Background
You and your child are invited to take part in a research study. Please read this information and feel free 
to ask any questions before you agree to take part in the study. This document is called an informed 
consent form. The nature of the study, benefits, risks, and other important information about the study 
are detailed below.
We are asking you and your child to take part in a research study called: PARENT-LED 
STEPPED-CARE COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT FOR YOUTH WITH ASD AND 
CO-OCCURRING ANXIETY. The person who is in charge of this research study is [CONTACT_289576], 
Ph.D. This person is called the Principal Investigator. However, other research staff may also be 
involved and can act on behalf of the person in charge.
Children between the age of 4 and 14 who meet criteria for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 
experience impairing anxiety may join the study. Parents may also join the study to provide information 
about their child.
This research study is funded by [CONTACT_289539].
A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. 
Law. This Web site will not include information that can identify you. At most, the Web site will include a 
summary of the results. You can search this Web site at any time.
Purpose
This research is being done to implement and evaluate how effective a parent-led, stepped-care 
cognitive behavioral intervention is for treating anxiety in children with ASD.
Procedures
The research will be conducted at the following location(s):  
Baylor College of Medicine and TCH: [LOCATION_007] Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF YOUR CHILD JOINS THIS STUDY?
If you agree to take part in this study, we will ask your child to do the following things:
Once enrolled, your child will receive stepped-care cognitive-behavioral therapy (SC-CBT). Cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on how your child's thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes affect feelings and 
behavior and teaches copi[INVESTIGATOR_289516]. The type of CBT is a specialized 
cognitive-behavioral treatment program for children and adolescents with ASD and comorbid anxiety. 
This type of treatment will be delivered using a stepped-care model, which provides therapy in "steps" 
that vary by [CONTACT_2236]. Treatment is "stepped-up" until your child begins to make progress, beginning first 
with the lowest intensity treatment (e.g., fewer in-person appointments, parent-led exposures) to more 
intensive (e.g., weekly in-person sessions, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-led exposures), as needed. SC- CBT consists of 
two main steps: Step One and Step Two.

DISORDER AND CO-OCCURRING ANXIETY
Your child will start with STEP ONE, which includes [ADDRESS_678846]-assisted sessions (each 
lasting 45 minutes) over a 12-week period. An important part of therapy involves facing feared 
situations, places, or objects; a process called exposure. Exposure involves gradually and repeatedly 
going into feared situations until you feel less anxiety. For example, an exposure for a child who is afraid 
of dogs may begin by [CONTACT_289540][INVESTIGATOR_289517] a dog on a leash, 
to eventually petting a dog. At each of the [ADDRESS_678847] will review with you how to use 
exposures with your child, so that they may gradually face their fears and learn to cope with their anxiety. 
You will also receive a workbook, offering step-by-step instructions on how to provide treatment at 
home. With the skills learned from the workbook, you will lead treatment with your child. Brief phone 
calls between you and study personnel will also be provided for support, coaching, and motivation.
After the 12-weeks, Step One will be complete and your child will participate in a brief assessment, 
which is used to determine if more therapy is needed. If your child meets treatment response status, 
then you and your child will proceed to the Maintenance Phase. During this Maintenance Phase, you will 
be encouraged to continue using the tools learned in Step One, continue using the workbook as a 
guide, and continue practicing the skills at home. If your child is determined to need more therapy at the 
end of Step One, then you will be 'stepped up' to receive STEP TWO of SC-CBT, which consists of [ADDRESS_678848]-led, parent-supported sessions (each lasting  60-90 minutes) over the course of 12 weeks. 
In addition to receiving SC-CBT, your child will participate in 4 assessments total throughout the course 
of the study. The time points for these assessments will be as follows: [1] Screening/Baseline, which is 
conducted before the beginning of treatment; [2] Mid-treatment, which is conducted after Step One to 
determine if more therapy is needed; [3] Post-Treatment, which is conducted approximately 12 weeks 
after your completion of the mid-assessment; and [4] Three-month Follow-up, which is conducted [ADDRESS_678849] and follow-up assessments will be 
administered through a secure and HIPAA compliant video-conferencing software (Zoom) in order to 
reduce burden. These assessments will be administered to you by [CONTACT_213999] (IE). The 
IE is an experienced clinician, a trained professional, or an advanced graduate trainee (supervised by 
[CONTACT_289541]).
We will also ask your child to participate in several objective assessment tasks, which will look at your 
child's physiological and motor characteristics. These tasks will be given at baseline and at 
post-treatment and will look at your child's gait performance (e.g., gait speed) and balance (e.g., center 
of mass sway) through use of small body-worn sensors. These body-worn sensors are safe, valid for 
use in children, and will measure your child's gait and balance. Your child may be asked to walk, stand, 
sit, or lie while wearing the body-worn sensor. Objective assessment tasks will be conducted on-site 
(during the visit).
In addition to the objective assessment tasks, all treatment sessions, interviews, and assessments will 
be audiotaped on a digital recorder or videotaped on a camcorder to make sure that therapi[INVESTIGATOR_289518] a high quality of care. These audio files are for research purposes only and will only be 
shared with research staff affiliated with this project. You or your child will generally not have access to

some risk that the files could be redisclosed.
Other possible risks to your child may include the psychiatric evaluation and administration of rating 
scales and participation in cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy.
The main risk of the psychiatric evaluation and administering of rating scales is that your child may 
experience mild discomfort due to the discussion of subjectively difficult topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. However, our 
experience shows that most people appreciate the opportunity to discuss their experiences with a 
trained clinician. The length of time required for the interviews and questionnaires is a possible 
discomfort. Your child will be given as many breaks as needed during that time. Your child also does not 
have to answer any questions if s/he does not want to.
As your child begins stepped-care CBT, s/he may experience a slight increase in anxiety and 
discomfort. This should be short-lived and therapy should reduce those effects over the long term. Your 
child may also experience distress during exposure exercises. It is also possible, although unlikely, that 
your child's anxiety may worsen during participation. In the instance that your child's symptoms worsen, 
he/she will be offered the opportunity for off-protocol treatment in which you will be responsible for 
associated fees/costs.
Participation in more than one research study or project may further increase the risks to your child. If he 
or she is already enrolled in another research study, please inform [CONTACT_289577] or the person reviewing 
this consent with you before enrolling your child in this or any other research study or project. 
If you or your child wish to discuss the information above or any discomforts you may experience, 
please ask questions now or call [CONTACT_289577] at [PHONE_6002].
Study staff will update you in a timely way on any new information that may affect your decision to stay in

feelings and behavior and teaches copi[INVESTIGATOR_289516] . The type of CBT 
that will be used is a specialized cognitive-behavioral treatment program for children and adolescents 
with ASD and comorbid anxiety. This type of treatment will be delivered using a stepped-care model, 
which provides therapy in "steps" that vary by [CONTACT_2236]. Treatment is "stepped-up" until your child begins 
to make progress, beginning first with the lowest intensity treatment (e.g., fewer in-person 
appointments, parent-led exposures) to more intensive (e.g., weekly in-person sessions, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-led 
exposures), as needed. SC-CBT consists of two main steps: Step One and Step Two.

DISORDER AND CO-OCCURRING ANXIETY
You and your child will start with STEP ONE, which includes [ADDRESS_678867]-assisted sessions 
(each lasting approximately 45 minutes) over a 12-week period. An important part of therapy involves 
facing feared situations, places, or objects; a process called exposure. Exposure involves gradually and 
repeatedly going into feared situations until you feel less anxiety. For example, an exposure for a child 
who is afraid of dogs may begin by [CONTACT_289540][INVESTIGATOR_289517] a dog 
on a leash, to eventually petting a dog. At each of the [ADDRESS_678868] will review with you how 
to use exposures with your child, so that they may gradually face their fears and learn to cope with their 
anxiety. You will also receive a workbook, offering step-by-step instructions on how to provide treatment 
at home. With the skills learned from the workbook, you will lead treatment with your child. Brief phone 
calls between you and study personnel will also be provided for support, coaching, and motivation.
After the 12-weeks, Step One will be complete and you and your child will participate in a brief 
assessment, which is used to determine if more therapy is needed. If your child meets treatment 
response status, then you and your child will proceed to the Maintenance Phase. During this 
Maintenance Phase, you will be encouraged to continue using the tools learned in Step One, continue 
using the workbook as a guide, and continue practicing the skills at home. If your child is determined to 
need more therapy at the end of Step One, then you will be 'stepped up' to receive STEP TWO of 
SC-CBT, which consists of [ADDRESS_678869]-led, parent-supported sessions (each lasting 60-90 minutes) 
over 12 weeks. 
In addition to receiving SC-CBT, you and your child will participate in 4 assessments total throughout 
the course of the study. The time points for these assessments will be as follows: [1] 
Screening/Baseline, which is conducted before the beginning of treatment; [2] Mid-treatment, which is 
conducted after Step One to determine if more therapy is needed; [3] Post-Treatment, which is 
conducted approximately 12 weeks after your completion of the mid-assessment; and [4] Three-month 
Follow-up, which is conducted [ADDRESS_678870] and 
follow-up assessments will be administered through a secure and HIPAA compliant video-conferencing 
software (Zoom) in order to reduce burden. These assessments will be administered to you by [CONTACT_289554] (IE). The IE is an experienced clinician, a trained professional, or an advanced 
graduate trainee (supervised by [CONTACT_289541]).
We will also ask you and your child to participate in several objective assessment tasks , which will look 
at your child's physiological and motor characteristics. These tasks will be given at baseline and at 
post-treatment and will look at your child's gait performance (e.g., gait speed) and balance (e.g., center 
of mass sway) through the use of small body-worn sensors.  These body-worn sensors are safe, valid 
for use in children, and will measure your child's gait and balance. Your child may be asked to walk, 
stand, sit, or lie while wearing the body-worn sensor. Objective assessment tasks will be conducted 
on-site (during the visit).
In addition to the objective assessment tasks, all treatment sessions, interviews, and assessments will 
be audiotaped on a digital recorder or videotaped on a camcorder to make sure that therapi[INVESTIGATOR_289518] a high quality of care. These audio files are for research purposes only and will only be 
shared with research staff affiliated with this project. You or your child will generally not have access to 
these files. However, if files are necessary to your care, they will be shared with you or your physician.

Section C:  Background Information
     Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects as many as 1 out of 59 individuals, with many higher-functioning youth not
diagnosed until school-age or later. This equates to ~102,000 children under the age of 14 years in the state of [LOCATION_007]
alone. Significant impairment in social and adaptive functioning are common, as are comorbid behavioral health disorders,
with anxiety disorders affecting between 50¿80% of youth with ASD. Given the relative frequency of anxiety disorders
among children with ASD, the associated impairment, and worsening trajectory over time without intervention, there is a
great need for treatment that specifically addresses anxiety-related symptoms in ASD.
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated efficacy in a number of studies. However, existing treatment

https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=417087 4/15protocols are delivered by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_100207] ¿full-packages¿ (i.e., 12-16 clinic sessions), which can be therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-intensive,
costly, impractical for families, and not responsive to parental preferences. Alternative approaches, such as parent-led,
stepped-care models that improve accessibility, are efficient, provide personalized care, and lower mental health treatment
cost, are greatly needed. Stepped-care models provide a lower-intensity first step (e.g., parent-led, less costly , and more
convenient for parents) as the initial treatment with the assumption that a proportion of individuals will respond to the first
step and others will need to step up to more intensive treatment. Matching treatment to families¿ needs and tailoring
subsequent treatment may be an efficient and effective approach, as well as consistent with parents¿ desire to help their
child. Given this, together with the substantial impairment associated with clinical anxiety in individuals with ASD across the
age span, this study proposes to implement a parent-led, flexible, individually-tailored cognitive-behavioral intervention for
children with ASD and anxiety.
 
Section D:  Purpose and Objectives
     The purpose of this study is to implement a parent-led, stepped-care cognitive behavioral therapy to children with ASD and
anxiety. Specifically, we will (1) examine the effectiveness of Stepped-Care CBT (SC-CBT; e.g., starting with Step One
parent-led, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-assisted treatment and then either maintenance or Step T wo therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-directed CBT), (2) examine the
potential predictors of response to Step One that could be used as baseline tailoring variables to match children to the best
level of care (i.e., Step One or CBT), and (3) examine the economic value of using a cost-ef fectiveness approach of SC-
CBT. We expect that through Stepped-Care CBT, children¿s anxiety levels will lessen.

Select one category that most adequately describes your research:
     d) Questionnaire/survey/interview
Discuss the research design including but not limited to such issues as: probability of group assignment, potential for subject
to be randomized to placebo group, use of control subjects, etc.
     A total of 200 children (aged 4-14) with a diagnosis of ASD and co-occurring anxiety and their parent/legal guardian will
participate and receive SC-CBT treatment. In addition, all participants will be asked to cooperate in assessments that will
occur at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up.
Inclusion Criteria:
     1) The child is between the ages of 4 to 14 upon enrollment with a) an established diagnosis of ASD made by a
standardized assessment (e.g., Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition; Childhood Autism Rating Scale-
Second Edition); and/or b) a score of 65and above on the Social Responsiveness Scale-Second Edition (SRS-2).
2) The child has clinically elevated symptoms of anxiety and/or OCD as indicated by a Clinical Severity Rating of ≥4 from
the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS), made on diagnoses endorsed on the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric
Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-Kid) at baseline assessment, and the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale>12.
3) Anxiety and/or OCD is the primary presenting problem and the independent evaluator (IE) determines that the child is
appropriate for the intervention focus. 
4) One parent/guardian is able and willing to participate (i.e., parent-led therapi[INVESTIGATOR_289525], attend study
assessments).
5) The child has a Full Scale and Verbal Comprehension IQ>70 as assessed on the Differential Ability Scales-Second
Edition (DAS-II) or Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence-Second Edition (WASI-II). This level of intellectual ability is
frequently used to demark the boundary of ¡°high functioning¡± ASD, and we and others have adopted this in our CBT
trials for children with ASD to achieve acceptable external validity . 
6) Both parent and child are able to read and/or understand English
Exclusion Criteria:
     Participants will be excluded if (1) the child has a diagnosis of child lifetime DSM-5 bipolar disorder , psychotic disorder,
and/or intellectual disability; (2) the child has severe current suicidal/homicidal ideation and/or self-injury requiring medical
intervention (referrals will be made for appropriate clinical intervention); (3) the child is receiving concurrent psychotherapy
for anxiety; (4) child has initiated or changed dosage of psychotropic medications within 4 weeks before study enrollment
OR stimulant or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_289526] 2 weeks before study enrollment. If appropriate, the child may be
enrolled in the study once medication dosage has stabilized (i.e., 4 weeks for psychotropic medication or 2 weeks for
stimulant/benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_109459]).
F2.  Procedure
     RECRUITMENT
A total of [ADDRESS_678888] 90 patients per month between the ages of 4-14 years with ASD, and through the
Autism Center Research Database (ARCD), which has more than 1,[ADDRESS_678889] of the study recruitment
will occur through TCH Autism Center's normal patient flow and the ARCD, study advertisements will also be circulated
through relevant sources (e.g., social media, websites, newsletters) to enhance enrollment and subject generality . As well,
we will contact [CONTACT_289556] (e.g., private clinics, community
organizations) to distribute advertisement flyers to potential participants. Interested potential participants will be asked to
contact [CONTACT_289557].
9/16/2020 Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=417087 6/15Recruitment will also be done through SPARK (Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research for Knowledge) which is a )
which is a landmark autism research project with the mission of speeding up research and advancing the understanding of
autism. SPARK's goal is to recruit 50,[ADDRESS_678890] information with the
research coordinator through a secure admin portal, giving her unique credentials to access it. Language for invitation
email, reminder email, and authorization form can be found on section S.
INITIAL PHONE SCREEN.
Parents will be given a 20-minute telephone screening to elicit preliminary inclusion/exclusion information. Individuals who
meet basic eligibility requirements during the phone interview and remain interested will be invited for a screening visit (i.e.,
baseline assessment), at which point a member of the research team will obtain informed consent from the parent and
child.
INFORMED CONSENT
If and when a potential participant chooses to participate in this study , informed consent will be obtained. Participants will
be provided with all relevant information and will be given as much time as needed to decide whether to participate.
Participants will be informed that their participation or absence of participation will not have any influence on the clinical
services received at TCH (or any other institution). Informed consent will be obtained prior to proceeding with any study
procedures. All participants will also be informed that they do not have to answer any specific questions if they do not wish
to do so. After obtaining consent, participants will complete the baseline assessment and begin treatment.
TREATMENT
All participants will receive parent-led, stepped-care cognitive-behavioral therapy (SC-CBT). CBT focuses on how a child's
thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes affect feelings and behavior and teach children copi[INVESTIGATOR_289527]. The type of CBT that will be used is a specialized program for children and adolescents with ASD and comorbid
anxiety. This type of treatment will be delivered using a stepped-care model, which provides therapy in "steps" that vary by
[CONTACT_2236]. Treatment is "stepped-up until the child begins to show improvement in anxiety symptoms, beginning first with the
lowest intensity (e.g., fewer in-person appointments, parent-led exposures) to more intensive (e.g., weekly in-person
sessions, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-led exposures), as needed. SC-CBT consists of two main steps (detailed below). Each participant will
be treated by a licensed psychologist/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_289528] a licensed psychologist. At the end of
study participation, a standardized summary of assessment and treatment will be provided to research participants.
Assessment summaries will contain information about inclusion criteria (e.g. SRS score, CSR score, P ARS score, whether
they met IQ cut off, etc.). It will be specified that this summary details research findings, and that our assessment is not
equivalent or a substitution of a clinical evaluation. Treatment summaries will contain information about how many therapy
sessions participants attended. Summaries will be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_289529]. Summaries will be shared through secure email, postal mail, or in person.
STEP ONE. All participants will start with Step One, which includes [ADDRESS_678891] will review with parents the necessary skills for conducting exposures and will provide
guidance in the delivery of exposures. Exposures, a hallmark of CBT for anxiety are used to gradually and repeatedly
confront feared stimuli. For example, exposure therapy for a child fearful of dogs may begin with looking at pi[INVESTIGATOR_289530] a dog on a leash, to eventually petting a dog. Outside of session, parents will lead
therapy using the provided workbook, which consists of a step-by-step approach for parents written on a 6th-grade level.
Brief phone contacts between parent and staff will also be provided for support, coaching, and motivation. After completing
Step One, a brief assessment will occur (i.e., the mid-treatment). If the child meets treatment response status, then the
parent and child end treatment and proceed to the Maintenance phase, where parents and children will be encouraged to
continue using the workbook and tools that they learned in Step One. If the child does not meet treatment response (i.e.,
does not improve), then s/he will 'step up' to Step Two.
STEP TWO. For those children who do not respond to Step One, they will be 'stepped up' to Step T wo, which consists of
[ADDRESS_678892]-led, parent-supported sessions, each lasting 60-120 minutes over the course of 12 weeks. During Step T wo,
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_289531]. These strategies will focus on providing children
with anxiety-copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]. In addition, parents will be taught (in weekly sessions) to support children in learning and
maintaining anxiety-copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], especially when outside of sessions. These skills are encouraged to be practiced at
school, in the community, and in peer-group settings. After completing Step Two, participants will end treatment and the
post-assessment will occur. For those participants in the maintenance phase (i.e., treatment responders at Step One), the
post-assessment will occur approximately 12 weeks after the completion of the mid-treatment (for consistency with
procedures in Step Two). All participants will then be re-assessed 3-months, after completion of the post-treatment.
ASSESSMENTS
9/16/2020 Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=417087 7/15All participants will be asked to cooperate in assessments that will occur as described above. All assessments will be
conducted with an independent evaluator (IE). The IE will be an experienced clinician, trained professional, or advanced
graduate trainee (supervised by a clinician). The measures that will be administered will include both IE-rated and
participant-rated scales (please see attachment in section S). T o reduce burden for families, post-assessment and 3-month
follow-up measures will be completed through a secure connection using video-conferencing software (Zoom). Zoom is a
secure HIPAA-compliant video-conferencing software.
In addition to completing rating scales, participants will be asked to participate in several objective assessment tasks,
examining physiological and motor characteristics. These tasks will be given at baseline and at post-treatment, and will
measure the participants gait performance (e.g., gait speed) and balance (e.g., center of mass sway). Both gait
performance and balance will be assessed on-site during the in-person visits through the use of wearable sensors.
Sensors transmit data to a BCM encrypted laptop via Bluetooth function (wireless), and data are saved in the laptop
automatically. The sensor data will not include identifiable information such as name [CONTACT_18131]. We will use HIPAA
compliant BCM Box for transmitting the collected data and for storage. Data collected for each participant will be coded to
ensure confidentiality. Only study personnel will have access to subjects' records. Data may also be shared with study's co-
investigators (on this IRB protocol) through BCM Box. However, data that could in any way identify subjects will not be
made public or shared. All of the outcomes in these tasks will be measured using previously validated wearable sensors
(more information attached in section S). 
TREATMENT FIDELITY/INTEGRITY
All clinician and assessment sessions, in both conditions, will either be audio-recorded or video-recorded (with parent
consent). These recordings will be used for research purposes, to monitor ongoing fidelity in Steps One and T wo, to
quantify treatment adherence, as well as to assess the inter-rater reliability and rater drift. If concerns are noted, the
clinician and/or IE will not conduct another assessment until procedures have been reviewed. Clinicians will upload
recordings to a web-secure, HIPPA-compliant storage (Box). Fidelity measures have been developed in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_289532]: [1] The Parent Completion and Ef fort Rating (PCER); [2] The Adaptation Checklist-Child; [3]
The Step One Treatment Checklist; [4] The Treatment Adherence, Content, and Competence Checklist.
TEMPORAL CHANGES DUE TO COVID-19
Please see procedural changes due to COVID-19 attached in Section S (due to limited remaining characters)
 
Section G:  Sample Size/Data Analysis
G1.  Sample Size
How many subjects (or specimens, or charts) will be used in this study?
     Local: 200              Worldwide: 200
Please indicate why you chose the sample size proposed:
     We will enroll a total of [ADDRESS_678893] slight attrition, the below-mentioned analyses allow for attrition without the loss of data. While MLM does not
provide for specific power analyses, the suggested power rules range from 20 participants per group, per level. As such, to
be conservative with our power estimates, we aim to enroll 200 participants to ensure we are suf ficiently powered for our
analyses, accounting conservatively for attrition (~7% at Step One; ~15% at Step T wo).
G2.  Data Analysis
Provide a description of your plan for data analysis. State the types of comparisons you plan (e.g. comparison of means,
comparison of proportions, regressions, analysis of variance). Which is the PRIMAR Y comparison/analysis? How will the
analyses proposed relate to the primary purposes of your study?
     Data analysis will involve Multilevel Modeling (MLM) because of the ¿nested¿ nature of the variables. More specifically ,
because the measures are repeated, the measures are considered the first level of the hierarchy , the individual children
are considered the second level, and the treatment groups are considered the third level. A major advantage of MLM is its
ability to handle missing data. While more traditional analyses use listwise deletion if a single time point is missing, MLM
uses parameter estimates to maximize the use of existing data. Furthermore, the present study will implement a regression
discontinuity analysis, which is an application of mixed models within MLM. This will allow us to examine the impact of
treatment, without the use of random assignment, as this method allows for the use of groups that are similar at baseline,
but then are designated by a predetermined selection cut point.
After assessing responder status and determining which participants receive Step T wo treatment and which participants
move to the maintenance phase, binary logistic regression will be utilized in an attempt to determine if there are factors
significantly predicting group membership. Possible predictors include variables such as age, anxiety severity ,
internalizing/externalizing problems, and parent characteristics.
Cost-effectiveness analysis examines the relative value of SC-CBT (relative to CBT). CEA is performed from a societal
perspective, meaning the costs to the healthcare system and the patient/parents are included. T reatment costs include
9/16/2020 Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=417087 8/15direct (e.g., cost of therapy session), indirect (e.g., travel costs, missed work), and opportunity costs (e.g., value of lost
time; see above for cost measures). CEA often incorrectly omits the opportunity cost of patient/parent time spent on
therapy, phone support, and at-home parent-child meetings. Non-study, mental-health service costs include inpatient,
outpatient, and school-based services and will be priced using the T exas Medicaid fee schedules. Research-specific costs
(e.g., screening, research consent) for patients and staff are excluded. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) are
computed as incremental costs divided by [CONTACT_289558]/outcomes (symptom reduction and change in
impairment/functioning). If outcomes differ significantly, a non-parametric bootstrap with replacement method is used to
generate a joint distribution of differential costs and outcomes. If outcomes do not differ, cost-effectiveness is determined
by [CONTACT_289559]. Mean and median ICER ratios are reported, as well as 95% confidence intervals. Cost-
effectiveness acceptability curves examine the probability of falling below a variety of cost-effectiveness thresholds. In
addition to the ICER approach, the net-benefit approach will be used to determine if findings are sensitive to method.
 
Section H:  Potential Risks/Discomforts
H1.  Potential Risks/Discomforts
Describe and assess any potential risks/discomforts; (physical, psychological, social, legal, or other) and assess the likelihood
and seriousness of such risks:
     Overall, the risks of this study are considered relatively minor . One potential risk of participating in this study is discomfort
associated with the psychiatric evaluation and completion of rating scales-- either due to the discussion of subjectively
difficult topi[INVESTIGATOR_289533]. However, we have found that
most people welcome the opportunity to discuss their experiences with a trained clinician; and breaks will be given as
much as possible to decrease boredom and physical/psychological discomfort.
In rare cases, psychotherapy may exacerbate anxiety symptoms. Should a child's symptoms increase significantly (linked
to treatment or not) and require study discontinuation, we will discuss alternative treatment options including psychotropic
medication and more intense psychotherapy. We will implement very strict rescue criteria should a child's symptoms
worsen significantly; he/she requires a higher standard of care (i.e., inpatient); and/or the child experiences suicidality or
significant side effects. Should a participant's symptoms markedly worsen, and/or the individual experience suicidality or
significant side effects, he/she will be immediately withdrawn from the study and provided with the standard of care, which
may include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], if necessary. [CONTACT_289577] (or a covering clinician) will be available at all times to study
participants in the event of a clinical emergency. Both this availability and how to reach the investigators in an emergency
will be clearly communicated orally and in writing to study participants.
H2.  Data and safety monitoring plan
     Do the study activities impart greater than minimal risk to subjects?
          Yes
NOTE:  The answer to the questions in H2 requires the completion of the form: 'Section H – Data and Safety Monitoring
Plan' as an attachment in Section S.
H3.  Coordination of information among sites for multi-site research
Is the BCM Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_53770]-INVESTIGA TOR for this multi-site research?
          No or Not Applicable
Is BCM the COORDINATING CENTER for this multi-site research?
          No or Not Applicable
 
Section I:  Potential Benefits
Describe potential benefit(s) to be gained by [CONTACT_30435] a result of participating in the planned work.
     There are several anticipated benefits associated with study participation, including extensive psychiatric evaluation and
psychological treatment. As a result of the latter, subjects may experience improvements in both quality of life and
psychosocial functioning, as well as reductions in symptoms presentation and related impairment.
Describe potential benefit(s) to society of the planned work.
     Participation will provide valuable treatment outcome data, which may benefit future families by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_289534] f
better evaluate and improve treatment and care for individuals with ASD and co-occurring anxiety .
Do anticipated benefits outweigh potential risks? Discuss the risk-to-benefit ratio.
     The benefits of participation far outweigh the relatively minor risks of participation. As the treatment provided is considered
standard-of-care, quality of intervention is not in question. In addition, it is possible that treatment may be rendered faster
when participating in the research study given the typi[INVESTIGATOR_289535]-list period when being seen through a standard clinic.
 
9/16/2020 Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=417087 9/15Section J:  Consent Procedures
J1.  Waiver of Consent
Will any portion of this research require a waiver of consent and authorization?
     Yes
Please describe the portion of the research for which a waiver is required. (Example: chart review to determine subject
eligibility)
     A waiver of consent is required to collect subjects' health information via EPIC, prior electronic medical record systems,
and/or hard copy records of those subjects associated with [LOCATION_007] Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289536], in order to
determine subject eligibility. Pertinent clinical information will be collected from the medical records regarding identifying
information such as name, telephone, date of birth, medical record number , demographics, and diagnoses. Any pertinent
documentation regarding prior testing (e.g., any ASD and anxiety disorder diagnostic assessments, IQ, genetic-testing) will
also be reviewed and collected from interested families in order to verify subject eligibility .
Explain why the research and the use or disclosure of protected health information involves no more than minimal risk
(including privacy risks) to the individuals.
     Use of patient's charts involves no more than minimal risk to the subject. Subjects charts are routinely reviewed by
[CONTACT_289560]. Only individuals allowed access to patient's charts (e.g., EPIC) are allowed
to review patient information. Thus, a standard protocol for protecting patient's privacy rights already exists. W e will review
subjects' charts to identify and contact [CONTACT_42148], as well as to confirm subject eligibility .We will also review any
pertinent documentation regarding prior testing (e.g., any ASD and anxiety disorder diagnostic assessments, IQ, genetic-
testing) in order to verify subject eligibility.
Explain why the waiver will not adversely affect the privacy rights and the welfare of the research subjects.
     Reviewing medical charts is part of standard clinical practice and necessary to ascertain diagnoses and other medical
information. Patients' contact [CONTACT_289561].
Pertinent documentation regarding prior testing will also only be used to verify subject eligibility . Only the members of the
investigative team will have access to this information. No information will be disclosed outside of the research setting.
Explain why the research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver and could not practicably be conducted
without access to and use of the protected health information.
     Accessing patients' contact [CONTACT_289562] . Accessing
interested families documentation regarding prior testing is also necessary to confirm eligibility prior to enrolling. Without
the waiver and thus without access to participants, it would be impossible to ef fectively conduct the research. In addition,
scientific validity would be compromised if not all the records can be analyzed.
Describe how an adequate plan exists in order to protect identifiers from improper use and disclosure.
     The information collected will be entered into a database that will be password protected for confidentiality . The database
will be stored on the BCM network. Per BCM policies, the confidential information will be stored on servers managed by [CONTACT_289563]/or departmental system administrators. Any physical data will be examined in a secure and
private environment. When not in use, physical data will be locked in a filing cabinet in the research team's of fice where
only the research team has access. The physical data will be disposed of in a responsible manner that is consistent with
BCM policy. All identifiers will be destroyed at the earliest opportunity consistent with the conduct of the research. 
As each subject is enrolled, he or she will be assigned a unique participant number (e.g. 1-100) to protect the subject's
identity. A password-protected document will be created that will contain the subject's participant number, as well as their
identity. Per BCM policies, confidential information will be stored on servers managed and maintained by [CONTACT_289564]/or department system administrators. Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-Is will have knowledge of the subject's actual
identity. Once the subject is assigned a participant number, he or she will only be identified by [CONTACT_289565] (i.e. name, medical record number , address, etc...) will be removed from the study
database.
Describe how an adequate plan exists in order to destroy identifiers at the earliest opportunity consistent with conduct of the
research, unless there is a health or research justification for retaining the identifiers or such retention is otherwise required by
[CONTACT_2371].
     All identifiers will be destroyed at the earliest opportunity consistent with the conduct of the research and local IRB
requirements, and participants will only be identified through their unique participant number .
Describe how adequate written assurances exist in order to ensure that the PHI will not be reused or disclosed to (shared
with) any other person or entity, except as required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of the research study, or for other research
for which the use or disclosure of the PHI would be permitted under the Privacy Rule.
     Written assurances exist on the consent form, stating that any PHI will not be reused or disclosed with any other person or
entity, except as requested by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of the research study, or for other research for which the use or
disclosure of the PHI would be permitted under the Privacy Rule. All data collected will be entered into a database that will
be password-protected and stored on the secure BCM network. Any physical data collected will also be kept and stored in
a secure, locked filing cabinet in the research team's office where only the research team has access. Any collected
identifiers will be destroyed at the earliest opportunity consistent with the conduct of the research and local IRB

9/16/2020 Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=417087 11/15Parents will be given a 20-minute telephone screening to elicit preliminary inclusion/exclusion information. Individuals who
meet basic eligibility requirements during the phone interview and remain interested will be invited for a screening visit (i.e.,
baseline assessment), at which point a member of the research team will obtain informed consent from the parent and
child.
If and when a potential participant chooses to participate in this study , informed consent will be obtained. Participants will
be provided with all relevant information and will be given as much time as needed to decide whether to participate.
Participants will be informed that their participation or absence of participation will not have any influence on the clinical
services received at TCH (or any other institution). Informed consent will be obtained prior to proceeding with any study
procedures. All participants will also be informed that they do not have to answer any specific questions if they do not wish
to do so. Due to COVID-19 outbreak, consent will be obtained using an electronic process when appropriate. All regulatory
consent procedures explained above will be followed when using e-consent protocol i.e. provided all relevant information
and be given as much time as needed. A member of the research team will schedule an informed consent via HIP AA
compliant video conferencing software, ZOOM. Participants will be provided an electronic copy of the consent to read prior
to the call. Research staff will send the participant a secure e-mail link to an online consent form via Redcap. We will also
provide 'key points' to the study, to aid in the parents explanation of the study to their child (attached in Section S) so that
the child has an understanding of the study, requirements, and components prior to the scheduled call.During the
scheduled call, participant and research team member(s) will thoroughly review the consent to ensure comprehension,
answer any questions, and address any concerns. Participants will be able to agree to participate, and sign the consent
form with a stylus, mouse, or finger and submit it to the research staf f. The participant will also be able to download a copy
of their signed consent form as a PDF through REDCap. A PDF of the online survey can be found in Section S. Also
attached is a copy of the last page where name, signature, and date are collected.
Appropriate steps will be taken to protect participants' identities. Participants will be assigned a unique alphanumeric

In 2016, the American Pain Society published guidelines on the management of postoperative 
pain based on a systematic review of  the various interventions and management strategies. A key 
recommendation was that "clinicians offer  multimodal analgesia, or the use of a variety of 
analgesic medications and techniques combined with non -pharmacological  interventions, for the 
treatment of postoperative pain in children and adult s (strong recommendations, high -quality 
evidence ). [1] 
According to the August 21, 2013 Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, one half of patients now 
receiving knee replacements are under 65 and demand for Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is 
expected to exceed 3.5 million procedures per year by 2030. [2] 
Multimodal treatment plans provide an advantage for acute postoperative pain. Multi -modal pain 
treatment can also be improved by [CONTACT_243973], 
physical therapy treatment within 24 hours of discharge and weight bearing as tolerated. The use 
of virtual reality (VR) has been shown to be a safe and effective adjunctive therapy for pain and 
low risk opi[INVESTIGATOR_243949].  [3] 
We propose to study the effect s of a VR-based pain management program , RelieVRx,  in acute 
postoperative pain after orthopedic TKA surgery in 100 patients ( [ADDRESS_296355] of care control group ). RelieVRx is 
a virtual reality therapy intended as adjunctive treatment for acute surgical pain. RelieVRx is 
intended to be a prescription therapy for the reduction and/or elimination of opi[INVESTIGATOR_243950]. Patients will be randomized to o ne of the two groups after 
study enrollment, and patients in the test arm will be educated about the device preoperatively to 
facilitate its use in the acute post operative period. The goal s of VR will be presented in the 
context of an alternate to opi[INVESTIGATOR_200076]. Subjects will be assured they will receive SOC 
analgesic management in addition to the VR headsets.

 3 BACKGROUND AND  SIGNIFICANCE  
Pain following orthopedic injuries and operations, including over 6.6 million orthopedic 
surgeries anticipated in  2020 [1], is significant and sustained during the entire period of recovery. 
This recovery period can be quite  long depending on the specific orthopedic operation and 
underlying disease or comorbidities. Treatment and  management of this pain is traditionally 
based primarily around utilizing pharmacological management . 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_243951] -operative pain management which can lead to  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2442] (OUD). These agents can yield both inconsistent and sub -optimal results 
[4] and greatly  increase the risk of the patient developi[INVESTIGATOR_243952]. Data from 
the U .S. Center  for Disease Control (CDC) revealed that even a single day of opi[INVESTIGATOR_243953] a 6% increase in  the risk of the patient developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a dependency within a year [ 5].   
Two retrospective cohort studies found opi[INVESTIGATOR_243954] -term use. One study evaluated opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -naïve patients who had 
undergone low -risk surgery,  such as cataract surgery and varicose vein strippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] [ 5]. Use of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_39863] 7 days of surgery was  associated with increased risk for use at 1 year. The second 
study found that among patients with a workers’  compensation claim for acute low back pain, 
compared to patients who did not receive opi[INVESTIGATOR_243955]  (defined as use within 15 
days following onset of pain), patients who did receive early opi[INVESTIGATOR_243956] 30 –730 days following onset that increased with 
greater  early exposure [ 6]. While new opi[INVESTIGATOR_243957], such as  the 2016 CDC opi[INVESTIGATOR_243957] 
[7] or 2018 Centers  for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) rules [ 8], are limiting the 
number  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_243958]  “naïve” patients to an initial [ADDRESS_296356] of care.  
It is hypothesized that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a significant role in both the 
detection and response to pain. Indeed, functional MRI (fMRI) studies with VR have shown 
diminished pain -related brain activity in five regions associated with  pain sensation. Regarding 
emotion, it has been demonstrated that emotions can modulate pain by [CONTACT_84188]/deactivation of 
the amygdala. Negative emotions, such as anxiety and depression, can facilitate pain while 
positive emotions can inhibit the pain -control pathway.

 To reduce addiction, low risk, non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_243959] 
(VR) shows great promise as a solution. Therapeutic VR has emerged as an effective, non -
pharmacological treatment modality for pain [4]. Users of VR wear a pair  of goggles with a 
close -proximity screen that creates a sensation of being transported into immersive, three -
dimensional worlds. A hypothesis for the mechanism of action for VR suggests that by 
[CONTACT_243974] o ther senses, VR is able to limit the 
user’s processing of pain signals [4].  
[ADDRESS_296357] of care ( SOC ) plus RelieVRx ( SOC +RelieVRx)  group , compare pain scores 
before and after use of RelieVRx . Hypothesis: Acute postoperative pain scores will decrease by 
[CONTACT_2669] 20% or 2 points on a 0 -10 Numerical Pain Rating Scale  (NPRS)  after each use  of 
RelieVRx .  
4.2 SPECIFIC AIM 2 
Compare pain scores bet ween the SOC group  and SOC +RelieVRx group. Hypothesis: 
Cumulative pain scores will be comparable  among the SOC +RelieVRx group and SOC group.  
4.3 SPECIFIC AIM 3 
Compare opi[INVESTIGATOR_243960] +RelieVRx group. Hypothesis: Opi[INVESTIGATOR_243961] 20% over a 90 -day postoperative period in the 
SOC+RelieVRx group compared to the SOC group.  
5 STUDY DESIGN  
5.1 DESCRIPTION  
This is a  prospective, randomized, controlled study of the appliedVR RelieVRx  pain 
management solution  in subjects undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty  (TKA) .  
Patient s at each study site will be randomized by [CONTACT_22123] 1:1 to either t he SOC  (control ) group  
or the SOC +RelieVRx (test) group . The SOC+RelieVRx  group will receive education and 
hands -on experience with the VR headset and RelieVRx  pain management solution  at a routine 
preoperative patient education class or during the history and physical encounter visit through a 
predetermined script to make the patient feel comfortable using the device on their own. The 
goals of VR will be presented in the context of an alternate method of pain control to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. 
Subjects will be assured they will receive SOC analgesic management in addition to the 
headsets. The participating surgeons and anesthesiologists at Geisinger Medical Center will

Geisinger ProvenRecovery Program©, which includes a “My Rapid Recovery Kit” containing 
care instructions for mobility and nutrition, an antiseptic body wash to lessen the chances of 
infection, a spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007] t o measure lung capacity, and immunonutrition drinks to avoid 
malnutrition and dehydration. Surgery through ProvenRecovery© is opi[INVESTIGATOR_243962]. During surgery, a patient’s pain is controlled by [CONTACT_243976].  Known as multi -modality pain management, this technique allows for effective 
pain control of just one area and eliminates additional pain sources. A combinati on of non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_243963], depending on the surgery, such as a local anesthesia, ibuprofen, 
acetaminophen, gabapentin, ketamine, and lidocaine.  
Intervention : For all participants who are randomly assigned to the SOC+RelieVRx group, the 
RelieVRx  headset will be provided by a study team member during the preoperative period, 
along with instructional materials. While in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], use of the VR headset will be offered 
either in addition or as an alternative to SOC pain medication. The headset will be provided pre -
operatively , but patients will not be instructed to use the device until after their surgery. Patients 
will be instructed to use the devi ce on the day of surgery after they are discharged from the Post 
Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU)  to the inpatient unit, or at least [ADDRESS_296362]-surgery. The device  
will then go with the patient upon discharge for use through the entire treatment period (i.e. 14 
days).  Participants  will use the RelieVRx headset for 14 days postoperatively a maximum of 3 
times per 24 -hour period (morning, noon, and evening) for not more than 30 minutes 
consecutively. The patients will be instructed not to use the device while am bulating.  
Assessments:  In inpatient  postoperative periods, pain will be assessed as per routine with a 
Numerical Pain Rating Scale  (NPRS) of 0-10, where zero equals the lowest pain level and [ADDRESS_296363]. This will be administered every 4 hours during the patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and 
each time the patient  request s pain medication, either intravenous or oral. After patients are 
discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], they  will be asked to complete a paper or online REDCap diary to 
track their pain levels, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]/non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_243964], and device use from home. The daily 
log will capture the NPRS at the same time each evening (± 2 hours). Participants will be asked 
to record their NPRS at least 2 hours after taking any pain medication. In the SOC+RelieVRx 
group, NPRS also will be recorded before (within 15 minutes prior to use) and immediately after 
each use of the Rel ieVRx device . Analgesic m edication use will be recorded in terms of 
medication type, dose, and time of administration.  
All participants will be enrolled in Force Therapeutics, a web -based, digital rehabilitation and 
education program. The patient is automatically enrolled when surgery is scheduled, and patient

 5.6 STUDY ENDPOINTS AND STATISTICAL PLAN  
This study will evaluate two primary endpoints – effectiveness of a single use of RelieVRx in the 
reduction of acute postoperative pain by 20%; and overall effectiveness of RelieVRx as an 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -sparing intervention, where opi[INVESTIGATOR_9787] -opi[INVESTIGATOR_243965] 
20% over a 90 -day postoperative period in the SOC+VR  group compared to the SOC group.  
Acute effectiveness will be evaluated using NPRS  data collected before and after each use of 
RelieVRx (up to 3 times per day) over the [ADDRESS_296366], acute effectivenes s will be evaluated at all stages of 
recovery. The expected 20% reduction after single u se will be scaled relative to the pre -use pain 
score [e.g. users reporting a pre -VR pain level of [ADDRESS_296367] -VR pain levels of 
6.4 (8 * 80%) on average; users reporting pre -VR pain of [ADDRESS_296368]-VR, etc.].  Each SOC+VR patient will use VR up to 4 4 times over the 14 -day recovery 
period, requiring linear mixed model analysis to assess acute changes in pain scores while 
accounting for stage of recovery and other covariates, such as age, preoperative health stat us and 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], and postoperative complications. For interim and final endpoint analyses, pain % -
change scores will be calculated for each use and averaged for each patient across the 72 -hour 
acute postoperative period, the following week, after 10 days, and overall. These av erages will 
be evaluated using one -sample unpaired t-tests (or the nonparametric one -sample Wilcoxon 
signed -rank test, as needed for non -normal data).  
Overall effectiveness will be evaluated by [CONTACT_243979][INVESTIGATOR_16444] 90 days postoperatively in 
both SOC and SOC+VR groups. Average MMEs (Morphine Milligram Equivalents) per day will 
be compared using unpaired Student’s t-test (or the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank -sum test) in 
interim and final endpoint analyses. In addition, changes in usage over time will be evaluated 
using linear mixed models (or nonlinear models, given data shape), accounting for variations in 
recovery time ac ross patients and other cov ariates, such as other analgesic medications used 
postoperatively, preoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] , and dosage changes. A sub -analysis will compare usage 
in the 14 -day acute postoperative recovery period.  
The secondary endpoint of this study is a comparison of the cumulative experience of pain over 
the 14 -day acute postoperative period between SOC and SOC+VR groups. In order to quantify 
pain that fluctuates over time, NPRS  pain scores will be plotted for each patient over the acute 
postoperative period, using straight -line interpolation between measurements. This approach will 
allow for incorporation of all data collected (even if some patients participate more than others) , 
and will avoid overemphasis on a single outcome measure (e.g. pain on day 14). Percent -area-
under -the-curve (VAS -%AUC) measurement will be calculated for each patient by [CONTACT_243980] [CONTACT_5627]: Michael Suk, MD  
Research Protocol: July 25, 2019  
Version  1.2 (03/17/20 ) 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  15 
 areas of consecutive trapezoids defined by [CONTACT_243981] x -axis and pain level measurements on the 
y-axis (e.g. 100% would indicate pain scores of 10 across the entire time period; 50% would 
indicate a linear reduction from 10 to 0 over the same time period) . In interim and final endpoint 
analyses, NPRS -%AUC accumulated to date will be compared between groups using an 
unpaired Student’s t-test (or nonparametric equivalent). In addition, linear mixed models will be 
used to compare cumulative pain between SOC a nd SOC+VR groups over time, as well as pain 
experienced in the inpatient postsurgical period and following days.  
Additional outcome data will be compared between groups in preliminary analyses using chi -
squared tests (for categorical variables), unpaired Student’s t -tests (for single -measure normal 
continuous data), or nonparametric equivalent (for non -normal data), as appropriate. For 
measures collected at multiple time points, %AUC values will be calculated per patient and 
compared using aforementioned tests. In final analyses, outcomes will be compared using linear 
mixed models, allowing for data missing at random and evaluation of covariates.  
When approximately 25% of the total required sample has been collected, patient data will be 
summarized to verify adequate study power, and interim analyses will be conducted. In order to 
preserve a Type I error rate of 5% (i.e., α = 0.05) for final analys es, interim analyses will be 
conducted with p-value threshold of 0.001, as suggested using the Hybittle -Peto method, 
meaning that only effects where d > 2.0 will be significant. Additional patients may be recruited 
as needed to ensure sufficient study powe r, and fewer patients may be recruited if interim 
analyses demonstrate highly significant effects. All statistical analyses will be performed with 
SAS (SAS 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC), Stata (SE 14.2, StataCorp, LLC, College Station, TX), 
or R (R 3.5.2, The R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) statistical software, with p -values of <0.[ADDRESS_296369].  
Primary Endpoints  
Preliminary data collected at Geisinger Medical Center (Danville, PA) between March 2017 and 
December 2018 from 1,052 patients who underwent total joint arthroplasty showed an average 
postoperative pain score of 8.50 following the procedure, and 6.16 on da y 2 (SD = 2.0; change d 
= 1.2, or a 28% pain reduction) under SOC.  
To assess the acute effectiveness endpoint of 20% average reduction in pain scores, each one -
sample t-test only requires data from 13 patients to demonstrate a significant difference from 
zero, assuming 20% attrition, a Type I error rate of 5% and a Type II error rate of 20% (i.e., 80%

 power). In order to observe significance of a lower threshold (e.g., a 10% reduction in pain level 
on average), data from 43 patients  using VR  will be required, assuming 20% attrition, a Type I 
error of rate 5% and 80% power.  
To assess the overall effectiveness for reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_243966] 20%, this study assumes 
an average MME per day of 12.5mg (SD = 3) across all users, although continuous opi[INVESTIGATOR_243967] 50mg/day. Observing a 20% relativ e reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_243968]+VR group compared to SOC (2.5mg) will require 64 patients total (32 per group) , 
assuming 25% attrition, a Type I error rate of 5% and 80% power. If interim data analysis 
reveals unexpectedly high variability in opi[INVESTIGATOR_174056], a revised power calculation based 
on new data may increase data collection requirements to address this question.  
Secondary Endpoint  
Using aforementioned preliminary data, two patients groups were created with simulated VAS -
%AUC data (with day 14 VAS means of 6.16 and 4.93, SD = 2.0; or, a 20% greater reduction at 
day 14) corresponding to a 7% difference in VAS -%AUC (0.86 versus 0.79; S D = 0.1; difference 
d = 0.7). Assuming 25% attrition, the study will require 92 patients  total  (46 per group ). Data 
from at least 68 patients is needed to observe a statistically significant VAS -%AUC difference 
between SOC and SOC+VR of 7% in an unpaired t-test, with a Type I error rate of 5% and 80% 
power.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  17 
 The study coordinator(s) will randomly assign study ID numbers in place of MRNs. All study 
data will be stored  on a secure  Geisinger Health System server,  and hard copy data will be 
double locked and accessible only to the study investigators. Only group -level information 
without personal identifiers will be included when presenting results or submitting manuscripts 
for publication.  An IRB approved study team member will share  the dataset with appliedVR via  
a secured e -mail.   
The RelieVRx device s will collect information related to device usage (i.e. frequency and 
duration  of use , features u tilized , completion rates) . When connected to WiFi, the devices will 
automatically and securely transmit de -identified logs of headset usage . This data contains no 
PHI, is encrypted in transit, transmitted as frequently as every 5 minutes, and stored in 
appliedVR's secure and compliant cloud environment. Data will be aggregated and sent in a 
compatible format to Geisinger to be analyzed and c ross referenced with patient study ID

6 SAFETY  MONITORING   
6.1 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study. All AEs will be reported 
to the institutional review board (IRB) regardless of whether they are considered study related.  
The date and time of onset and outcome, course, intensity, acti on taken, and causality to study 
treatment will be assessed by [CONTACT_9154].  In the event of a serious AE (SAE), this will be 
reported to the Geisinger IRB (GIRB) according to the GIRB guidelines. All other AEs will be 
summarized and submitted to GIRB dur ing continuing review.  
6.2 DEFINITIONS  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward, undesired, or unplanned event in the form of signs, 
symptoms, disease, or laboratory or physiologic observations occurring in a person given a test 
article or in a clinical study. The event does not need to be causally related to the  test article or 
clinical study.  
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is an AE that:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life-threatening  (see below).  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]  (see below).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  18 
 • Results in a persistent or significant disability  or incapacity (see below).  
• Results in cancer.  
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical int ervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
Life-threatening  refers to immediate risk of death as the event occurred per the reporter. A 
life-threatening experience does not include an experience, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death, but as it actually occurred, did not create an immediat e risk of 
death. For example, hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be 
considered life -threatening, even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, 
an allergic reaction resulting in ang ioedema of the face would not be life -threatening, even 
though angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis can be fatal.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243969] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138822]; however, it is not in itself considered 
an SAE. In absence of an AE, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243970]. This is the case in the following situations:  
• The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112041] a procedure required by 
[CONTACT_760].  
• The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112042] a routine procedure followed 
by [CONTACT_16018] ( e.g., stent removal after surgery).  This should be recorded in the study file.  
In addition, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition that has not worsened does not constitute 
an SAE.  
Disability  is defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  
If there is any doubt about whether the information constitutes an SAE, the information is treated 
as an SAE.  
A protocol -related adverse event  is an AE occurring during a clinical study that is not related 
to the test article but  is considered by [CONTACT_55886] (or designee) to be

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  [ADDRESS_296372] be 
recorded, reported, and followed up as indicated for an SAE.   This includes:  
• Pregnancy exposure to a test article, except for exposure to prenatal vitamins.  If a pregnancy 
is confirmed, use of the test article must be discontinued immediately.  Information about 
pregnancy exposure includes the entire course of pregnancy and delive ry, and perinatal and 
neonatal outcomes, even if there are no abnormal findings.  Both maternal and paternal 
exposure are considered other reportable information.  For exposure involving the female 
partner of a male subject, the necessary information must be collected from the subject, while 
respecting the confidentiality of the partner.  
• Lactation exposure to a test article with or without an AE.    
• Overdose of a test article as specified in this protocol with or without an AE.  Baby [CONTACT_243982].  
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a test article with or without an AE . 
6.[ADDRESS_296373]’s AEs and SAEs will be recorded and reported from the signing of the informed 
consent form through  [ADDRESS_296374] -operative . 
6.4 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Michael Suk, MD, JD, MPH, MBA, FACS, Chief Physician Officer, Geisinger System Services 
Chair, Musculoskeletal Institute &  Department of Orthopaedic Surgery  Geisinger Health System, 
will notify GIRB of all study SAEs in accordance with policy guidelines. If an SAE has not 
resolved at the time of the initial report, a follow -up report including all relevant new or 
reassessed information ( e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) will be submitted to 
GIRB. An SAE will be followed until either resolved or stabilized.   
[ADDRESS_296375]:  
• Be informed of all pertinent aspects of the study and all elements of informed consent.

 • Be given time to ask questions and time to consider the decision to participate.  
• Be allowed to visually and manually inspect the device.  
• Voluntarily agree to participate in the study.  
• Sign and date an IRB -approved informed consent form.  
7.[ADDRESS_296376], the assignment of a study  ID number to each  
individual participant and the protocol of providing only the necessary associated clinical  
information to the remainder of the research team will mitigate this risk. All data will be coded  
and encrypted while being transferred.  
8 PUBLICATION  PLAN  
After clinical trials are completed, we intend to submit, together with our collaborators, results of 
the evaluations of RelieVRx for publication in order to promptly disseminate information on its 
efficacy. appliedVR  will also prepare all study data for de novo  submission to the FDA to obtain 
Class II review and clearance.

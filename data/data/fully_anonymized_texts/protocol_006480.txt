Abstract
The longstanding view has been that insomnia, and other forms of sleep disturbance, emerge as a 
consequence of dementia and are the result of progressive neuronal damage. However, there is growing 
evidence that the direction of causation may go both ways, with sleep disturbance potentially increasing 
vulnerability to dementia. Longitudinal studies have found that sleep disturbance often precedes and 
increases risk for dementia by [CONTACT_72623].The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship 
Page 16 of 25between chronic insomnia and dementia biomarkers and orexin levels found in cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] ﬂuid 
(CSF). Fifteen adults age 30-[ADDRESS_590635] is to examine the relationship between chronic sleep disturbance 
(insomnia) and dementia biomarkers and orexin levels as assessed in cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] ﬂuid (CSF). Fifteen 
adults age 30-50 with chronic insomnia and age- and gender-matched good sleepers will undergo 
overnight polysomnography and morning CSF sampling.  These data will be used to address the 
following speciﬁc aims:  Speciﬁc Aim 1: To examine the association between chronic insomnia and 
CSF markers of dementia. Hypothesis 1: Chronic insomnia will be associated with higher levels of CSF 
AB markers compared to good sleepers.  Speciﬁc Aim 2 (exploratory): To examine the role of orexin in 
mediating the relationship between chronic insomnia and CSF markers of dementia. Hypothesis 2: 
Higher CSF orexin levels will mediate the relationship between chronic insomnia and A markers.
Primary outcome variable(s)
Dementia biomarkers in cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] ﬂuid
Secondary outcome variable(s)
CSF orexin levels
Background
Patients with Alzheimers dementia frequently experience sleep disturbance that gradual worsens with 
increasing severity of the disorder. For caregivers, having a patient with dementia awake during the 
night is one of the primary reasons cited for nursing home placement. The longstanding view has been 
that insomnia, and other forms of sleep disturbance, emerge as a consequence of dementia and are the 
result of progressive neuronal damage. For example, Alzheimers dementia has been shown to target the 
suprachiasmatic nucleus, the master clock of the body.  There is growing evidence that the direction of 
causation may go both ways, with sleep disturbance potentially increasing vulnerability to dementia. 
Longitudinal studies have found that sleep disturbance often precedes and increases risk for dementia 
by [CONTACT_72623]. In older adults without cognitive impairment, self-reported insomnia has been found to 
be associated with greater beta amyloid burden as assessed with PET imaging. One mechanism that 
could explain this relationship is the recently-discovered glymphatic system, through which potentially 
toxic by[CONTACT_461568], such as A, are cleared from the nervous system. Metabolic 
solutes are excreted into the interstitial ﬂuid, which then ﬂow through interstitial space and pass into 
cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] ﬂuid (CSF) for clearance. During sleep, the interstitial space increases by 60%, allowing 
greater transport of metabolites. Acute sleep deprivation in mice leads to an increase in A levels in CSF. 
These studies demonstrate that disturbed sleep increases markers of Alzheimers disease and may 
increase vulnerability to the disorder. While the mechanisms underlying the glymphatic system are still 
under investigation, there is increasing evidence that the peptide orexin plays a crucial role. In humans, 
high CSF concentration of orexin-A was associated with increased phosphorylated tau. In an animal 
model of Alzheimers disease, genetic deletion of orexin led to only moderate increases in sleep duration 
but strongly suppressed the formation of amyloid plaques. In a second study of this mouse model, 
delivery of an orexin antagonist signiﬁcantly inhibited amyloid plaque formation. There is a need to 
better understand the role that orexin plays in the link between insomnia and Alzheimers disease.  Much 
of the literature in this area utilizes models of acute sleep disturbance, usually total sleep deprivation. 
Less is known about the impact of chronic sleep disturbance as it occurs in the general population, most 
notably in the form of chronic insomnia. Given that AB levels accumulate for up to years prior to the 
onset of dementia, improved understanding of the mechanisms through which deposition occurs could 
dramatically shift the landscape from treatment of dementia to one of prevention in two ways. First, 
promotion of good sleep throughout the lifespan may decrease vulnerability to dementia. Second, sleep 
research may provide a window into the physiology of the glymphatic system and lead to novel insights 
for non-sleep approaches for prevention and treatment. Given the commercial availability of an FDA-
approved orexin antagonist, there may be tremendous opportunity to decrease risk for dementia through

Study duration
The total duration of the study will be [ADDRESS_590636] of success in recruitment through these approaches. To estimate the appropriate 
sample sizes, statistical calculations were carried out using pi[INVESTIGATOR_461557] N=[ADDRESS_590637] sizes (differences of 30%, 40%, and 50) were estimated at 80% 
power. For ABO, sample sizes were calculated to signiﬁcantly detect the differences between two 
groups of 50%, 100%, and 150% at 80% power. Power calculations were performed on OxA and ABO 
in raw and natural log scales, respectively, after examining the normality of data with residual plots. 
Variability estimates at each time point were obtained as averages of sample standard deviations of two 
treatment groups per time point.  As such, N=15/group would be sufﬁcient to identify changes in the [ADDRESS_590638] sizes equal or greater than 30% and 100% for OxA and ABO, 
respectively.

which may carry a potential for central nervous system (CNS) effect(s)? Centeral nervous system(CNS) 
effect: the ability of a test article to enter into and potentially interact with the central nervoous system 
(brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]). Clinical Investigation: Any experiment that involves a test article and one or 
more human subjects that either is subject to requirements for prior submission to the Food and Drug 
Adminstration (FDA) under section 505(i) or 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or is

Procedures
At an initial visit, participants will provide informed consent; complete standard questionnaires on 
sleep, cognitive functioning, and demographics this visit, which will be completed remotely. All 
information will be collected via RedCAP. Participants will then complete an ambulatory sleep study at 
home to screen for the presence of sleep disordered breathing and to characterize their sleep 
architecture. There is the potential for the data from the ambulatory sleep study to reﬂect reactivity to 
the recording equipment (i.e. a ﬁrst night effect) this will be minimized by [CONTACT_461569]. Individuals who have evidence of sleep disorders based on the ﬁrst night recording will be 
excluded from further participation in the study. The criteria for deﬁning sleep disorders will be an 
apnea-hypopnea index greater than [ADDRESS_590643] actigraph for one week and 
these data will be used to objectively assess sleep/wake patterns to determine eligibility based on 
habitual sleep duration.The actigraphy is a wrist-worn device that measures body movements. It is 
lightweight (17.5 g) and is worn like a wristwatch. Data are downloaded onto a personal computer and 
customized software uses the movement values to infer when the individual was awake or asleep. The 
methodology is commonly used to record sleep/wake patterns over several days. These data will be 
used to determine the individuals habitual sleep duration. In past studies, insomnia has most 
consistently associated with negative health outcomes when it is associated with objective evidence of 
short sleep duration (6 hours). As such, participants with insomnia who do not demonstrate average 
sleep duration 6 hours on actigraphy will not be eligible for further participation in the study. 
Participants who continue to be eligible following home sleep monitoring will then be studied in the 
Sleep Center on 11 Gates at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_461558]. They 
will be arrive to the Sleep Center at 7:[ADDRESS_590644] the EEG, EOG, EMG,

to the International 10/[ADDRESS_590645] sleep 
architecture variables of the amount of each stage of sleep in terms of minutes and percentage of total 
sleep time. In addition the following sleep continuity variables will be computed: sleep latency (SL; 
time from lights out to the ﬁrst epoch of stage 2 or higher), total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep 
onset (WASO; number of minutes spent awake between lights out and lights on), and sleep efﬁciency 
(SE; total sleep time divided by [CONTACT_461570]). Additionally, our technicians will attached 
two sensors to the chest area of the subjects in order to measure respi[INVESTIGATOR_461559]. TatchSleep is a ﬂexible, thin, and wireless adhesive patch 
designed to collect physiological parameters related to sleep disorders in patients. Each patch consists 
of a wearable sensor and a bottom layer of double coat medical-grade adhesive. This adhesive is safe 
for patient use and enables the patch to stay afﬁxed to the body throughout the night. The sensor also 
connects directly to a battery which is hidden within the patch. During the study, patients will be asked 
to wear three patches. Data from the patches are transmitted wirelessly throughout the night to a 
companion mobile application, which stores the data for clinicians to upload to a sleep analysis 
platform. Upon waking, wires will be removed and the subjects will be allowed to shower. Those in the 
insomnia group who choose to participate in the optional second part of the protocol will have a fasted 
blood draw at this visit. Study staff will walk the subjects over to CHPS outpatient. Around 8:[ADDRESS_590646]. 
CSF Analysis:  Analysis 1: Endogenous ABO levels in human CSF will be measured in a blind fashion 
in a ﬂow-based ABO-speciﬁc sandwich ELISA using the Erenna immunoassay system (Millipore, 
Temecula, CA), described in Savage et al 2014 JN. In brief, [COMPANY_006]s proprietary 19.3 antibody coupled 
to paramagnetic microparticles will be used to capture ABO, repeatedly washed with assay-speciﬁc 
proprietary buffers, and detected using a ﬂuor-labeled detection antibody, 82E1 (IBL, Minneapolis, 
MN). Human CSF samples (100 uL/well) will be loaded in a blinded fashion in triplicate. The standards 
(ADDL), prepared in-house, will be run alongside CSF samples in triplicate using a 12-point ½ serial 
dilution between 42 pg/mL and 0.04 pg/mL. Statistical analysis of the data, including limit of detection 
(LOD) for the assay (deﬁned as 2 x SD Bkg/slope with percent coefﬁcient of variance 20%) and 
unknown ABO concentrations will be calculated using Singulex Sgx link and GraphPad Prism 
(GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) software.  Analysis 2: OxA concentrations in CSF will be 
quantiﬁed by [CONTACT_28920]-house ELISA developed using Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) 
electrochemiluminescence detection technology platform (Gaithersburg, MD, [LOCATION_003]). Puriﬁed 
polyclonal IgG (G-003-36, Phoenix Peptide, Burlingame, CA, [LOCATION_003]), raised in rabbit against OxA 
(amino acids 16-33), will be used as a capture antibody. Goat anti-human polyclonal antibody against 
OxA (N-18) (sc-[ZIP_CODE], Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, [LOCATION_003]) will be used as a 
primary detection antibody. Sulfo-Tag labeled anti-goat antibody, raised in donkey, will be used as a 
secondary detection antibody and will be provided by [CONTACT_19487] (R32AG-5). Blinded CSF samples will be 
run in triplicate alongside OxA standard (run as a 10-point 1/3 serial dilution between 30,000 and 4.57 
pg/mL). Statistical analysis of the data, including lowest detection limit (LDL) for the assay (deﬁned as 
2 x SD Bkg/slope with percent coefﬁcient of variance 20%) and unknown OxA concentrations will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_461571] a nonlinear regression curve (sigmoidal, 4PL, X is log (Concentration)) and 
will be corrected for weight by 1/Y^2 using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA)

Analysis Plan
Paired-samples t-tests will be conducted to compare each of the CSF analytes between patients with 
chronic insomnia and matched good sleepers. Multiple regression analyses will be used to examine 
whether CSF orexin levels mediate the relationship between chronic insomnia and AB markers. 
Mediation analyses will be conducted using a series of linear regression models in which group 
(insomnia or control) and orexin levels will be treated as independent variables and AB markers will be 
treated as the dependent variables.

Risk / Bene®t
Potential Study Risks
There is no substantial risk associated with the completion of the initial evaluation, though the subject 
will be asked to respond honestly to personal questions. Risks associated with polysomnography: There 
are few risks associated with the sleep study procedure. However, some people do experience minor 
discomfort (dry skin, rash) from having the skin cleansed and sensors placed on the skin over the course 
of the in laboratory studies. Risk of Lumbar Puncture: There is the risk of brain swelling or herniation if 
the subject has particular neurological abnormalities (e.g. papi[INVESTIGATOR_044], mass lesion, Chiari 
malformation). The neurology fellow performing the LP will conduct a neurological exam with 
fundoscopic exam to rule out these contraindications and will only proceed if there is no evidence of 
these risks. The lumbar puncture may cause pain at the site where the needle goes in and the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] ﬂuid 
is taken. There is a small risk of infection or bleeding. After the lumbar puncture, there is a risk of 
headache. To minimize the risk of a headache, the doctor will use a small, specialized needle, a sprotte 
needle introduced through an introducer. This type of needle has been demonstrated to reduce risk of 
headache. In addition, bedrest for one or more hours immediately after the procedure will be 
recommended to the participant. Finally, oral hydration will be encouraged to help reduce risk of 
headache. If headache does occur, it is usually mild and can be controlled with bedrest, hydration (with 
oral ﬂuids), and acetaminophen or NSAIDS. Rarely, the headache is severe and may require additional 
treatment with a blood patch. In this procedure, a small amount of the patient's own blood is injected 
into the lumbar puncture site. This procedure is generally effective in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_461560]. Although 
very rare, it is possible to have an allergic reaction to the local anesthetic used for the lumbar puncture. 
Signs of an allergic reaction include swelling and/or a rash on the skin where the anesthetic was 
injected. The patient will be asked about prior allergies to lidocaine and will be monitored for evidence 
of this reaction. There is a small risk of hemorrhage related to lumbar puncture. This risk will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_62262] a platelet count and coagulation studies (PT/PTT) prior to the lumbar puncture. 
To further minimize any possible risk, the lumbar puncture will be done by a neurology resident who is 
speciﬁcally trained in the procedure. Potential sources of research risk of this proposed investigation 
include the burden to participants cause by [CONTACT_461572], performance of the 
actigraphy and sleep study, and the conﬁdentiality of data obtained. We do not consider the time 
demands on participants a serious risk and they can withdraw at any time. In addition, study staff will 
be trained to minimizr the burden on research involving human participants, breach of conﬁdentiality of 
personal data obtained as part of this study is a potential risk to participants.
Potential Study Bene®ts
It is possible that the sleep study could identify sleep disorders that participants are unaware of, 
enabling them to seek treatment. There are no other beneﬁts to the individual for participation. The 
knowledge we expect to gain from this study will be used to better understand the relationship between 
chronic insomnia and dementia.
Alternatives to Participation (optional)

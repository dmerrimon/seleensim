Study Title  
Virtual Training for Latino Caregivers to Manage Symptoms of Dementia  
Objectives  
The objectives of this study are to: (1) culturally and linguistically adapt the STAR -VTF 
online training  modules  for Latino caregivers of people living with dementia (PLWD), 
(2) pi[INVESTIGATOR_746313]’ responses to the adapted online training  modules, an d (3) 
develop a REDCap survey to pragmatically collected caregiver outcomes  in a future 
study . 
Design and Outcomes   
The study will use a single -arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_746314]. We 
will assess self -reported outcomes  at baseline and  6-[ADDRESS_1020877] and Preparedness for Caregiving Scale. In addition, we will assess 
caregivers’ perceived usability  of the online training modules, and we will conduct 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.[ADDRESS_1020878] -enrollment.  The interviews will assess c aregiver 
satisfaction with and acceptability of the adapted online training  modules . 
Interventions and Duration  
For 6 -8 weeks, caregivers will complete online training modules asynchronously. They 
will access the modules via email or text message . There are 7 online training  modules. 
Caregivers will be instructed to complete one module per week. The content of the 
modules is as follows:  Module 1  provides an understanding and overview of dementia ; 
Module 2 introduces caregivers to the behavioral treatment of dementia, realistic 
expectations, and effective communication; Module 3 covers the ABC (antecedents, 
behaviors, consequences) approach to problem -solving, including rationale and 
development of an ABC plan; Module 4 instructs caregivers to review the ABC plan and 
revise as needed; Module 5 covers pleasant events and managing negative thinking; 
Module 6 instructs caregivers to review the ABC plan, pleasant activities schedule, and to 
revise as needed; Mod ule 7 covers copi[INVESTIGATOR_746315]. Each 
module takes about 15 minutes to complete. The modules use text, pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], and 
illustrations with a voiceover presentation.  Caregivers will receive the online training  
modules in their preferred language (English or Spanish).  They will also receive a 
workbook to accompany the lesssons . The total length of time each caregiver  will be in 
the study is approximately 8 weeks.  
Sample Size and Population  
Participants will: be aged [ADDRESS_1020879] 8 hours of care per week, provide care to PLWD  who lives at home, and self -
identify as Hispanic/Latino.  We expect to enroll up to [ADDRESS_1020880] of the intervention.

2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE   
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
Latinos are more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias 
(ADRD ). Driven by [CONTACT_746326] U.S., the number 
of Latino PLWD is projected to increase more than nine fold from 379,[ADDRESS_1020887] 
compared to older White adults.2 These differences are due in large part to the health 
conditions (e.g., diabetes) and socioeconomic factors (e.g., chronic exposure to economic 
and social adversity, lower levels and quality of education, and discrimination) that are 
more prevalent in Lat ino populations and that are associated with cognitive decline.3,[ADDRESS_1020888] a higher prevalence of  behavioral and psychological symptoms of 
dementia  (BPSD ) and their caregivers have a higher risk of depression, yet they 
remain underrepresented in research . Among community -dwelling PLWD, the 
prevalence of BPSD is higher among Latinos compared to White people, even after 
adjusting for age, gender, education, income, cognitive and functional status, and caregiver 
characteristics.[ADDRESS_1020889] 
higher levels of depression compared to White caregivers.7–[ADDRESS_1020890] 
care.  Compared to White people, Latinos are less satisfied in their communication with 
healthcare providers, are more likely to perceive that providers fail to provide needed 
information, and are more likely to report having a problem understanding healthcare 
providers.13–15 Spanish -speaking Latinos report much worse experiences with healthcare 
than White people.13,15 –17 In a national survey, nearly 60% of Latino caregivers of PLWD 
report having faced discrimination when navigating healthcare settings for PLWD.18 For 
85% of Latino caregivers in the survey, it was important that healthcare providers treating 
ADRD understand their ethnic background, but less than 60% felt confident about having 
access to culturally -competent healthcare. Our preliminary work indicate s that providers 
miss opportunities to identify Latino caregivers that need supportive services for managing 
BPSD. Barriers include caregiver -provider language discordance and differences in 
communication styles, particularly as it relates to the topic of BPSD. For this reason, 
culturally and linguistically adapting evidence -based interventions, like STAR -VTF, is a 
critical aspect in the design of pragmatic trials.  
Latino caregivers face barriers in seeking ADRD healthcare . Like other minority 
caregivers of PLWD, Latinos tend to attribute memory loss to normal aging, normalize 
behavioral and psychological symptoms, and hide problems with symptoms to avoid 
stigmatization of their family member.[ADDRESS_1020891] healthcare. Other major 
barriers for Latino caregivers include clinicians’ lack of knowledge about the differences 
between normal aging and early signs of dementia, lack of Spanish -speaking clinicians, and 
experience of disc rimination in healthcare settings.18–20 Our preliminary work indicates that 
Latino caregivers hesitate to raise concerns about BPSD with healthcare providers due to 
language discordance and health literacy factors. Interventions such as STAR -VTF 
embedded in healthcare systems can help to raise L atino caregivers’ awareness about the 
availability of culturally -competent, nonpharmacological treatments for improving 
management of BPSD at home.  
STAR -VTF is an evidence -based virtual intervention to support caregivers in 
managing BPSD . STAR -C Virtual Training and Follow -up (STAR -VTF) is a virtual 
adaptation of a systematic and standardized behavioral approach – known as the Seattle 
Protocols – to training caregivers to reduce BPSD in community -dwelling PLWD. The 
Seattle Protocols teach caregivers the ABCs of behavior change – a process that involves 
identifying specifics about the problem under consideration, identifying possible 
environmental or in terpersonal factors that lead up to and sustain their occurrence, and 
systematically altering those factors to reduce problems.21 The Seattle Protocols were 
consolidated into the STAR -C program wherein coaches (master’s degree or equivalent in 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 5 psychology, social work, or a related field) visit caregivers at home to deliver the training.22 
The condensed 6 -week program involves 4 in -home sessions and 2 telephone sessions.23,24 
A randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare STAR -C to routine medical care 
in English -speaking, predominantly White participants.23 The study population included 
only 1 Latino caregiver (randomized to control arm). At 6 months, caregivers randomized 
to the intervention arm had significantly lower depression, subjective burden, and caregiver 
reaction scores.  
To ease translation, STAR -VTF was developed and is now being tested in a pragmatic trial 
at Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA).25,[ADDRESS_1020892] 6 30 -minute weekly telephone check -ins 
with a coach (social worker or mental health counselor). The 6 modules cover the same 
content as STAR -C (Table 1). The modules are hosted on the Kaiser Permanente School of 
Allied Health Scienc es learning management system. Currently, only caregivers 
participating in the ongoing pragmatic trial at KPWA have access to this website. O ur 
preliminary data identified potential areas of mis fit between STAR -VTF and Latino 
caregivers. The modules: do not sufficiently address dementia literacy, use 
language/semantics that could be insensitive, and do not reflect Latino cultural values that 
could influence family structures and views of caregivi ng.

2.2 Study Rationale  
We conducted qualitative interviews with 44 stakeholders (e.g., Latino caregivers, 
frontline clinicians, and health educators). The stakeholders were not involved in the 
ongoing STAR -VTF pragmatic trial at KPWA and only viewed prototypes of the 
modules. Our analysis re vealed that healthcare systems are not providing adequate 
education about dementia and support in managing BPSD. In fact, most Latino caregivers 
were unaware that healthcare providers could help with this matter. Stakeholders 
expressed interest in STAR -VTF , but there were concerns with particular aspects of the 
modules. Based on feedback from stakeholders, we have identified three adaptations to 
the STAR -VTF modules that would better serve Latino caregivers.  
Increase knowledge about dementia to reduce normalization of symptoms and 
stigmatization of PLWD.  Similar to other studies of racial and ethnic minority 
caregivers, our preliminary data reveal that Latinos tend to: believe dementia is a normal 
part of aging; attribute behavioral and psychological symptoms to normal aging or to 
their family member’s pe rsonality; attribute the development of dementia to emotions; 
believe that dementia is a mental health disorder, and therefore, perceive PLWD as being 
loco (crazy); view pharmacological treatment of BPSD as accepting that their family 
member is loco (crazy); and believe that dementia can be healed or its symptoms 
managed through herbal remedies, praying, and therapy.  
Module 1 includes a 7 -minute section titled “Overview of Dementia.” It covers the links 
between dementia and behavior, common causes of dementia, how dementia affects a 
person’s ability to do daily tasks, and how changes in behavior are progressive and not  
intentional. The first adaptation of our proposed study will be to expand the content in 
this section. The goal is to reduce normalization of BPSD and the stigma associated with 
ADRD. For example, when discussing common causes of dementia, we will add con tent 
about the differences between normal age -related forgetfulness and serious memory 
problems. We will also explain that dementia is a physical (not mental) illness.  
 
Eliminate stigmatizing, offensive, and culturally irrelevant language.  We found that 
Latinos tend to prefer the term pérdida de la memoria  (memory loss) instead of  
“Alzheimer’s disease” or “dementia .” Furthermore, stakeholders were concerned with 
program materials describing behavior symptoms as “challenging,” “problematic,” and 
“bothersome.” It could be misinterpreted as describing PLWD (as opposed to their 
symptoms). In addition, stakeholders expla ined that Latinos tend to place the needs of the 
person they are caring for over their own needs. It is a way of expressing the Latino 
cultural value of familismo  (familism). Thus, stakeholders st rongly advised against 
program materials describing caregiving as burdensome. Finally, Latinos rarely identified 
with the label “caregiver.” The translated word ( cuidador ) does not appear to be 
commonly -used. It is sometimes misinterpreted to refer to a formal caregiver or to an 
informal/family caregiver who gets paid to provide care. Latino caregivers we 
interviewed preferred to simply use kinship terms (e.g., daughter, daughter -in-law, wife 
of person with memory loss) to describe their role.  
 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 7 Based on these findings, the second adaptation of our proposed study will be to revise the 
language used across all modules. The goal is to eliminate any language that could be 
stigmatizing, offensive, and culturally irrelevant. For example, we will replac e 
“dementia ” with “memory loss,” eliminate negative descriptions of BPSD, avoid the term 
“caregiver burden,” and replace the label “caregiver” with kinship terms.  
 
Incorporate Latino family structure and the nature of caregiving in Latino families . 
Stakeholders stressed the importance of targeting the family unit, as opposed to a primary 
caregiver, in ADRD healthcare for Latinos. A bilingual and bicultural social worker said, 
“It's not necessarily just one person [caring for PLWD]. Because our famili es come in 
packs… I think being able to be flexible in some of the norms that an education program 
will have, whether that means two people or more -- because usually, it' s a family.” In the 
vast majority of cases, Latino caregivers we interviewed described receiving extensive 
support from family members (including small children). They lived in multigenerational 
households or within close proximity of relatives, facilitati ng frequent help with care 
responsibilities and emotional support. In addition, there was a strong aversion to using 
formal respi[INVESTIGATOR_175794], driven by [CONTACT_746327], language, and economic factors.  
 
In module 7, caregivers learn that enlisting the help of family members and formal respi[INVESTIGATOR_746320]. It assumes most caregivers 
live alone with PLWD and that other family members provide minimal support. The third 
adaptation of our proposed study is to incorporate content that reflects the structure of 
Latino families (i.e., multigenerational households, liv ing near family) and how 
caregiving is often a shared responsibility within the family unit. Furthermore, when 
suggesting use of formal respi[INVESTIGATOR_746321], we will be sensitive to culturally -
influenced preferences. We will also address concerns about th e lack of bilingual, 
bicultural, and affordable services.  
 
Intervention Regimen:  For [ADDRESS_1020893] the adapted online training modules . The full STAR -
VTF intervention – adapted modules coupled with coaching – will be tested in a future 
study with Latino caregivers.  
 
3 STUDY DESIGN  
Objective  1: Culturally and linguistically adapt the STAR -VTF online training  
modules for Latino caregivers of PLWD  
Findings from our stakeholder interviews indicate that no major changes to the 
intervention’s core components are required. Instead, we need to improve the content and 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.[ADDRESS_1020894] adaptation  will be  to expand the 
content in the “Overview of Dementia” section of module 1. The content will address 
common beliefs and attitudes about dementia that result in families normalizing dementia 
symptoms and stigmatizing PLWD. The second adaptation  will be  to revise the language 
across all modules. We will eliminate any language that stakeholders suggested could be 
stigmatizing, offensive, and culturally irrelevant. We will rewrite the conte nt to a 6th 
grade or lower reading level – a suggestion made by [CONTACT_746328]. The content of the modules will be translated and the voiceover 
presentations recorded in Spanish. The third adaptation  will be  to incorporate content into 
module 7 that reflects the structure of Latino families (e.g., tendency to live 
multigenerational households) and how caregiving can often be a shared responsibility 
within the family unit.  
The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_746322]’s staff member. 
Feedback on draft adaptations will be obtained from s takeholders, including Latino 
caregivers of PLWD  and Spanish -English bilingual and bicultural health educators . 
These individuals are members of a community advisory board. We will refine 
adaptations based on stakeholder feedback.   
 
Objective 2: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_746313]’ responses to the adapted online training  
modules  
The study will use a single -arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_746323]. Participants will be up to 20 caregivers 
of PLWD . We will target individuals who  are: aged [ADDRESS_1020895] 8 hours of care per week, provide care to PLWD  who 
lives at home, and self -identify as Hispanic/Latino.  
Caregivers will complete a baseline survey using a REDCap link that will be delivered to 
caregivers via email or text  message . The survey will include sociodemographic 
characteristics and the outcome measures (i.e., Revised Memory and Problem Behavior 
Checklist and Preparedness for Caregiving Scale). We will collect outcome measures 
from caregivers again [ADDRESS_1020896] -enrollmen t using the same data collection method. 
Sociodemographic characteristics will include: caregiver age, occupational status, 
whether  caregiver works outside of the home, number of people living in caregiver’s 
home, educational attainment, English fluency, preferred language, languages spoken at 
home, race, gender, annual household income, device ownership, Internet access  at home , 
health insurance status of caregiver and PLWD, relationship to PLWD, age of PLWD, 
gender of PLWD, number of years in caregiving role, whether caregiver lives in same 
household as PLWD, and hours per week providing care.  
After completing the baseline survey, caregivers will begin participation in the 
intervention. The intervention tested in this study will only involve the self -directed 
training component of the STAR -VTF intervention . We will provide caregivers with the 
video modules via text messgae or email . We will also mail each participant a copy of  the 
adapted version of the STAR -VTF workbook in their preferred language.  There are 
handouts and resources to along with each  lesson.  Caregivers will be instructed to 
complete 1 module per week for 7 weeks (Table 2). 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 9 After 6 -8 weeks, we will schedule an exit interview with caregivers . The interview will 
happen virtually (phone or videoconferencing) and will be under 1 hour. We will ask 
participants  semi -structured questions to understand their experience with the online 
training  modules and wit h completing the survey  via REDCap . 
 
Objective 3: Develop a REDCap survey to pragmatically collected caregiver 
outcomes . We will create a REDCap survey that will facilitate  collect ion of caregiver 
outcomes pragmatically  in a larger pi[INVESTIGATOR_746324] -scale embedded pragmatic clinical 
trial that we plan to conduct in the future . The REDCap instrument will include the 
English and Spanish versions of the Revised Memory and Problem Behavior Checklist 
and the Preparedness for Caregiving Scale . In the future, this functionality will allow 
remote collection of caregiver outcomes that can be securely linked back to the patient 
electronic medical record  – solving the issue with health information management laws  
that make it dif ficult or impossible to collect caregiver outcomes as part of a patient’s 
electronic  medical  record . In the present study, we will pi[INVESTIGATOR_746325] [ADDRESS_1020897] -enrollment.

the adapted online training modules . The full STAR -VTF intervention – adapted 
modules coupled with coaching – will be tested in a future study with Latino caregivers.  
We believe there is minimal risk associated with participating in the study. The 
intervention is an education and training program to give caregivers more tools and better 
knowledge for minimizing and responding to BPSD . The primary risk  with the 
intervention is discomfort with the intervention content. The intervention’s  
recommendations based on the best available clinical evidence and has already been 
extensively tested in prior research. Core elements of the intervention have been proven 
in previous rese arch to significantly improve average clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, 
treatment recommendations that improve care on average may have adverse 
consequences for any individual patient. Participants will be fully informed of the risks 
and their right to decl ine or withdraw from the study or specific activities.

Protocol Template, Version 5.[ADDRESS_1020902] and screen for 
eligibility. Study staff  will use a structured screening survey to ask potential 
participants their age, whether they live with PLWD  or within 5 miles , the number of 
hours of care they provide each week , their race/ethnicity, and whether PLWD  lives 
in assisted living or skilled nursing facilities .  
We will email a n e-consent form to caregivers who are eligible. After emailing these 
materials, study staff  will contact [CONTACT_746332] e-consent 
form and answer any questions.  Caregivers will be instructed to sign the e-consent 
form. Enrollment will begin when the study staff members  receive the e-consent 
forms signed by [CONTACT_50633].  
 
6.2.2 Baseline Assessment  
After receiving the signed e-consent form, caregivers will receive an email or text 
message asking them to complete the REDCap  baseline survey  that contains:  
• Sociodemographic questionnaire  
• Revised Memory and Problem Behavior Checklist   
• Preparedness for Caregiving Scale  
 
6.2.3 Module Assessment  
At the end of each online training module, there is a short survey that caregivers are 
asked to complete. The survey contains:  
• System Usability Scale  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_1020903] -enrollment , caregivers will receive an email or text message 
asking them to complete the REDCap  baseline survey  that contains:  
• Revised Memory and Problem Behavior Checklist   
• Preparedness for Caregiving Scale  
 
In addition , study staff members  will schedule an exit interview with participants. The 
interview will happen virtually (phone or videoconferencing) and will be under 1 
hour. We will ask participants  semi -structured questions to gauge their acceptance of 
the online learning modules and their experience completing the REDCap survey.  
 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 14 7 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS   
7.1 Potential Risks and Benefits for Participation  
Potential Risks:  We believe there is minimal risk associated with participating in the 
study. The primary risks to participation are:  
• Breach of confidentiality  
• Discomfort in answering survey or interview questions  
• Discomfort with the intervention content  
Potential Benefits:  We anticipate that this research will yield important new information 
regarding the delivery of culturally competent support to Latino caregivers of PLWD. 
The results of the study will help to improve future care for Latino caregivers.  
 
7.2 Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Collection and Reporting  
7.2.1 AE/SAE Definitions  
The study will adhere to the definitions for AEs and SAEs stipulated in the NIA Adverse 
Event and Serious Adverse Event Guidelines  as outlined below.  
 
AE Definition:  AE is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human study 
participant, including increased stressed, inability to cope, or other emotional discomfort, 
temporally associated with the participants’ involvement in the research, whether or not 
considered related to participation in the research.  
 
AEs for this study include:   
This study is designed to pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087] a behavioral intervention with caregivers. As such, we 
believe it will pose minimal risk to participants because the probability and magnitude of 
harm or discomfort anticipated are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily 
encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological 
examinations or tests. The risks of participating in this study may include feeling 
discomfort discussing personal matters during the intervention, su rvey, or exit interview, 
as well as frustration as caregivers attempt to implement the suggestions of the STAR -
VTF online learning modules.  
 
SAE Definition: SAEs consist of any  adverse event that results in death; is life threatening 
or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; requires 
or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity; results 
in congen ital anomalies or birth defects; is another condition which investigators judge to 
represent significant hazards  
 
SAEs for this study include:   
Research activities may identify immediate risk of harm or other urgent need. While we 
would not conclude that any such emergencies are consequences of study participation or 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 15 intervention content, there is still a clear obligation to report and respond appropriately to 
these urgent needs.  
 
7.2.2 Classification of Severity and Study Relatedness  
All data and safety monitoring reporting will classify SAEs and AEs as to their severity, 
expectedness, and potential relatedness to the study intervention as per the definitions 
below:  
 
Severity  
• Mild : Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of minor 
irritant type causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not 
require therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient.  
• Moderate : Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by 
[CONTACT_14212]; moderate experiences may cause some interference 
with functioning  
• Severe :  Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally 
require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating  
Expectedness  
• Unexpected - nature or severity of the event is not consistent with information 
about the condition under study or intervention in the protocol, consent form, 
product brochure, or investigator brochure.  
• Expected - event is known to be associated with the intervention or condition 
under study.   
Unexpected events will be subject to expedited reporting requirements as 
described in the NIA Guidance on Clinical Trials  and in Section 1.2.3, below.  
  
Relatedness   
• Definitely Related :  The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational 
agent/procedure – i.e. an event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study intervention, follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the suspected interven tion, that is confirmed by [CONTACT_45452][INVESTIGATOR_45418]’s clinical 
state.  
• Possibly Related :  An adverse event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from administration of the study intervention follows a known or expected 
response pattern to the suspected intervention, but that could readily have been 
produced by a number of other factors . 
• Not Related :  The adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational 
agent/procedure - i.e. another cause of the event is most plausible; and/or a 
clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 16 and the study intervention and/or a causal relationship is considered biologically 
implausible.  
7.2.3 AE/SAE Reporting  
The study will adhere to the reporting requirements for AEs and SAEs stipulated in the 
NIA Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Guidelines  as outlined below.  
 
Process for identifying AEs and SAEs: The study staff member s, Celeste Garcia and JP 
Lopez Garcia , will be in contact [CONTACT_746333]. When an adverse event is 
identified, [CONTACT_39306] and study staff  will follow NIA’s AE/SAE process flow . They 
will meet on a weekly basis throughout the project period and will review study progress 
and adverse events. NIA’s template for AEs  and template for SAEs  will be used to collect 
information about adverse events.  
 
Adverse event reporting schedule:   
• All adverse events  that are both  serious  (SAE) and unexpected  (i.e., have not 
been previously reported for the study’s intervention) will be reported to the 
IMPACT Collaboratory Regulatory and Data Team Leader (Julie Lima PhD), 
Advarra IRB, NIA IMPACT Collaboratory PO ([CONTACT_45473]), and the 
IMPACT Collab oratory DSMB Chair (or the project’s Safety Officer) within 48 
hours  of the study’s knowledge of SAE.  
• The summary of all other SAEs will be reported to IMPACT Collaboratory 
Regulatory and Data Team Leader (Julie Lima PhD), Advarra IRB, NIA 
IMPACT Collaboratory PO ([CONTACT_45473]), and the IMPACT 
Collaboratory DSMB Chair (or the project’s Safety Of ficer) quarterly , unless 
otherwise requested by [CONTACT_746334] a Safety Officer.  
• All deaths will be reported to IMPACT Collaboratory Regulatory and Data Team 
Leader (Julie Lima PhD), Advarra IRB, NIA IMPACT Collaboratory PO ([CONTACT_60443]), and the IMPACT Collaboratory DSMB Chair (or the 
project’s Safety Officer) and to the DSMB Chair (or project’s Safety Officer ) 
within 24 hours  of study’s knowledge of death.  
• AEs will be reported per IRB policies and also to IMPACT Collaboratory 
Regulatory and Data Team Leader (Julie Lima PhD), Advarra IRB, NIA 
IMPACT Collaboratory PO ([CONTACT_45473]), and the IMPACT 
Collaboratory DSMB Chair (or the project’s Safety Officer) and to the DSMB 
Chair (or project’s Safety Officer ) at minimum every 6 months, or at a frequency 
requested by [CONTACT_45454]/or by [CONTACT_4318].

the study due to slow accrual.  
9.4 Outcomes  
9.4.1 Primary outcome   
The primary outcomes are : (1) Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist and 
(2) Preparedness for Caregiving Scale. We will collect these outcomes at baseline and 
6-[ADDRESS_1020908] .27,28 Caregivers will rate 
memory, depression, and disruptive behavior problems in the PLWD. The instrument  
contains 24 items (7 memory -related, 8 depressive, and 9 disruptive) that assess 
problem behaviors and are rated for frequency of occurrence during the past week 
and caregiver reaction to the problem behaviors.  
 
2. Preparedness for Caregiving Scale.29 Caregivers will rate how prepared they are for 
various aspects of caregiving. The instrument  contains 8 items that ask caregivers 
how well prepared they believe they are to provide physical care, emotional support, 
deal with the stress of caregiving, and set up in -home support services. Each item is 
rated on a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 (not at  all prepared) to 5 (very well prepared).  
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.[ADDRESS_1020909] th is outcome 
each time a caregiver completes an online training module. The instrument  will be  
embedded within the modules.  
• System Usability Scale .30 Caregivers will rate how easy the online  training module s 
are to use . The instrument  contains 10 items . Each item is rated on a 5-point scale 
ranging from 0 ( strongly disagree ) to 7 (strongly agree ).  
 
Secondary outcomes will also include caregivers’ acceptance of the online training  
modules , their experience completing the REDCap survey , and their adherence to the 
online training  modules . We will develop a semi -structured interview guide t o 
qualitativel y assess, during exit interviews , caregiver acceptance and experience 
completing the REDCap survey. We will obtain caregiver completion rates of online 
training  modules using built -in metrics from the Kaiser Permanente School of Allied 
Health Sciences learning management system .

Ramirez , Celeste Garcia, and/or JP Lopez Garcia . The interviews will be audio recorded, 
and we will also take notes during and after the interview.  
10.2 Data Management  
Data collection and management  will be the responsibility of the University of 
Washington.  All data collected from participants will be labeled with a unique study 
identification number and not the participant’s name [CONTACT_746340], Version 5.[ADDRESS_1020911]. Ramirez will be responsible for training study staff members  on the 
study protocol.  
10.3.2  Quality Control Committee  
This study will not utilize a  quality control committee . 
10.3.3  Metrics  
We will use a log to document whether and when caregivers enrolled in the study 
were prompted to complete outcome assessments via the REDCap survey. Th e log 
will also document whether and when an exit interview has been scheduled. We will 
review the log on a weekly basis.   
10.3.4  Protocol  Deviations  
We will use a protocol deviation  log. The log will enable us to  capture a description 
of the protocol deviation, the deviation category (e.g., safety, informed consent, 
eligibility, protocol implementation), date the deviation occurred, and date the 
institutional review board was notified.  
10.3.[ADDRESS_1020912] (IRB) Review  
This protocol and the informed consent document and any subsequent modifications will 
be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_746335].    
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 20 11.2 Informed Consent Form  
Consent forms in English and Spanish will be IRB -approved and the participant will be 
asked to read and review the document. Using the language preferred by [CONTACT_4317] 
(English or Spanish), the study staff member will explain the research study to the 
participant and answer any questions that may arise. A verbal explanation will be 
provided in terms suited to the participant’s comprehension of the purposes, procedures, 
and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants. Participants 
will be informed that participat ion is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the 
study at any time, without prejudice, and that the quality of their medical care will not be 
adversely affected if they decline to participate in this study. Participants will have the 
opportunity to carefully review the electronic  consent form and ask questions prior to 
signing. The participants will be given a copy of the informed e-consent form  so that they 
may discuss the study with their family or surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to 
participate . The informed e-consent process will be conducted and documented in 
REDCap (including the date), and the form e-signed, before the participant undergoes 
any study -specific procedures. A copy of the  signed  informed e-consent document will be 
sent to the participants for their records .

Key information about this study  

 
Protocol Template, Version 5.[ADDRESS_1020916] to be in this study. If you 
say yes, you can quit the study at any time.  
 
The study, Virtual Training for Latino Caregivers to Manage Symptoms of Dementia, is about an 
online program we are designing to better support family caregivers of people living with dementia 
(PLWD). Our goal is to learn how we can design the online progr am to better meet the needs of 
family caregivers. We will do this by [CONTACT_746336]. We will 
also ask caregivers to answer survey questions and participate in an interview. This study is being 
conducted by [CONTACT_746337] (UW) and is funded by [CONTACT_746338].  
 
This study may not help you personally, but we hope the results of this study will help improve 
care in the future. You might feel uncomfortable with the program materials or with answering 
some study questions. You may skip any part of the program you don ’t want participate in. You 
may also skip any questions you don’t want to answer. In addition, the interview could last up to 
60 minutes. We can schedule the interview on a date and time that is convenient for you. It’s 
possible that someone other than the  researchers could find out you were in the study or see your 
private information.   
 
What will happen if I take part in this study?  
If you are eligible and want to join the study, we will ask you to:  
 
Use an online program for a period of 6 weeks. The online program consists of 6 videos. You 
would watch the videos at home from any device that you prefer to use. We will ask you to watch 
one video per week. The videos will provide information to help you better manage behavior al and 
psychological symptoms of dementia (e.g., agitation, sleep disturbance, aggression).  
 
Complete online surveys. The surveys will ask you about the following:  
• Sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race, ethnicity)  
• Occurrence and frequency of dementia symptoms in the PLWD and your reactions to 
these symptoms  
• How prepared you feel for various aspects of caregiving  
• How easy or hard you think the online program is to use  
• How useful you think the online program is to use  
 
Take part in an in -person interview that will last up to [ADDRESS_1020917] through the surveys will 
be labeled with a code number instead of your name.  
 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 33 We will provide you with $[ADDRESS_1020918] through the surveys

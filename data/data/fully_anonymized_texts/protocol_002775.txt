1.0  OBJECTIVES 
1) Primary Objectives:  To determine the objective response rate in patients with 
myeloid metaplasia-myelofibrosis (MMM ), atypi[INVESTIGATOR_517596] (CML-CMML),  acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or 
high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), hypereosin ophilic syndrome 
(HES), polycythemia vera (PV), and mastocytosis to dasatinib. 
 
2) Secondary Objectives:  To evaluat e duration of response and survival. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_671189] adult patient s with advanced or 
refractory hematopoietic malignancies still die from their disease. No generally 
effective therapy for agnogenic myeloid me taplasia (AMM), or the other bcr-abl 
negative myeloproliferative disease (MPD) has been established.1-3 Hence, there 
is an urgent need to identify new agents fo r patients with these life-threatening 
diseases. 
 
The transduction of signals from  the extracellular milieu to the nucleus of a target 
cell (e.g., an epi[INVESTIGATOR_517597], a blood vessel endothelial cell or a stromal 
fibroblast) are receptor-m ediated events.  It is clear , from a large body of 
research, that some of the receptors t hat mediate critical  events in signaling 
between tumor cells and important host ti ssues are receptor tyrosine kinases 
(RTKs).  All of these mole cules have an extracellular ligand binding domain, a 
transmembrane domain and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain.  Upon ligand 
binding, receptors dimerize, the tyrosi ne kinase is activated and the receptors 
become autophosphorylated.[ADDRESS_671190] has been the receptors platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) 
receptors.   PDGF receptors have been shown to have defined roles in the 
autocrine stimulation of tumor cells, as well as tumor cell-host cell interactions 
such as new blood vessel growth (o r “angiogenesis”) and supporting stromal 
fibroblasts.
[ADDRESS_671191] with two 
receptor subtypes, the PDGF receptor-α  (PDGFR α) and PDGF receptor- β 
(PDGFR β).  PDGF receptors are normally f ound in connective tissue and glia but 
are lacking in most epi[INVESTIGATOR_24603]. However, re cent studies have implicated paracrine 
or autocrine PDGF loops in the growth deregulation of gliomas and sarcomas as 
well as various human epi[INVESTIGATOR_220]. Furthermore, PDGF has been 
implicated in the pathogenesis of several nonmalignant prolif erative diseases, 
including atherosclerosis, restenosis  following vascular angioplasty, and 
fibroproliferative disorders such  as obliterative bronchiolitis.6, 7 PDGF receptors 
are expressed on tumor neovasculature and are up-regulated during tumor

receptor expression on tumor stroma l fibroblasts may support tumor cell 
growth.10, 11  Thus, PDGF may influence tumor ce ll growth directly or indirectly, 
employing both autocrine and paracrine mechanisms.12  A large body of data 
supports a role for PDGF in the pathophysiology of a number of MPD.5, 8, 10-19 
 
C-kit and the VEGF Flk-1 receptor (als o called KDR, the human homologue, or 
VEGF-R2) are closely related receptor tyrosine kinases which have arisen by 
[CONTACT_517618]-like domains from a common ancestor.[ADDRESS_671192] cell tumors, gastrointestinal  stromal tumors, small-cell lung cancers 
(SCLCs), melanoma, breast cancer, and neuroblastoma. In a number of tumors types, c-kit-mediated growth has been found to occur via mutation of c-kit, which 
results in ligand-independent ac tivation of the receptor 
23-25  C-kit is essential for 
the development of normal hematopoietic cells and has been proposed to play a functional role in AML. In a recent  investigation of 917 adult and pediatric 
patients with AML, c-kit was detected on the surf ace of AML blasts in 63% of the 
samples by [CONTACT_53409].
26 In recent publications, expression of c-kit was 
identified in 20 of 25 AM L patients and in all of 21 cases, respectively.27, 28 c-kit is 
another member of the class III family of RTKs, characterized by [CONTACT_517619] 5 i mmunoglobulin repeats,  a hydrophobic 
transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain split by [CONTACT_517620]. 
Binding of the c-kit ligand, stem cell factor (SCF), initiates a signal transduction cascade that includes receptor autophosphorylation and subsequent phosphorylation on numerous intracellular substrates. c-kit and its ligand play a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_517598], as evidenced by [CONTACT_517621], which encodes SCF, as well as in the c-kit receptor itself. These mutations result in varying degrees of macrocytic anemia and a loss of mast cells in addition to deficiencies in gametogenesis and melanogenesis.  In addition to its role in normal hematopoeisis, c-kit is expressed in leukemic blasts in approximately 60% to 80% of patients with AML, as assessed by 
[CONTACT_517622] c-kit or by [CONTACT_189095] c-kit 
messenger RNA. Supporting a functional role for c-kit in AML, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor, as we ll as a proliferative response upon SCF 
stimulation, has been demonstrated in leukem ic blasts in most AML cases that 
were c-kit+. The proliferative response to SCF has been shown to be synergistic 
with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulati ng factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin 
(IL)-3, both of which are known to promote th e growth of leukemic cells in vitro.  
We have recently reported that SU5416 a nd SU6668,  small-molecule inhibitors 
Protocol 2004-0817

Page 4 of 36 
 
of RTKs such as Flk-1/KDR with structural and sequence si milarity to c-kit, inhibit 
biologic functions of c-kit in MO7E cells, including ligand-induced tyrosine 
phosphorylation and proliferation.29 Additionally, both compounds induced 
apoptosis in these cells. Both SU5416 and SU6668  also inhibited SCF-induced 
phosphorylation of c-kit in blasts from several AML patients, one T-cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and one chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) 
patient, and also induced apoptosis in these cells.[ADDRESS_671193] that 
c-kit inhibition may provide a useful means to treat AML.  Imatinib mesylate, a Bcr/Abl selective tyro sine kinase inhibitor, is the most active 
agent against CML.  Pr eclinical studies demonstrate similar suppression of c-kit 
and PDGF-R kinases suggesting its potential role in a wide variety of c-kit or 
PDGF-R positive tumors including gastroi ntestinal subcutaneous tumors (GIST).  
AML is associated with high expression of c-kit.  Other myeloproliferative 
disorders are associated with high expre ssions of PDGF and PDGF-R.  They are 
ideal targets for therapy with new Bcr/Abl or Abl/Src inhibitors. 
 In this study, we propose to evaluate the efficacy of dasatinib, dual Abl/Src inhibitors in c-kit positive and PDGF-R expressing (myeloprolif erative) disorders 
in a time-efficient approach.  Some of t hese disorders have responded to imatinib 
including HES, mastocytosis, PV, and to lesser extent AML and MMM. 
 
• Polycythemia vera (PV):  This is a MP D involving excessive proliferation of 
the erythroid series, producing erythr ocytosis, high Hb/Ht levels, vessel 
stasis, splenomegaly, and transformation to AML and other MPD.  Response rate to PV after failure on hydrea and IFN-α  to imatinib is about 50%. 
• Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES):  Th is is an MPD of the eosinophils 
causing eosinophilia, skin rashes, organ infiltration, heart failure, CVAs and 
multi-organ failure (liver, kidney).  The median survival range reported is 1-4 
years.  There is no effective therapy for HES.  Patients with HES treated with 
imatinib 100mg daily had a 50% response rate.  In our studies 5/[ADDRESS_671194] one other study.  
• Responses in mastocytosis have been r eported recently in [ADDRESS_671195] been treated for a 
median of 39 days (range 6 – 147).  Fi fteen patients have been treated for 
more than one month.  So fa r, by [CONTACT_517623]:  major 
response – 2, partial response – 6, clinical benefit – 4, for an overall response of 12/15 = 80%.  Preclinical studies sugges t that high levels of dasatinib may be more 
effective against mastocytosis lines.  Following discussion with Bristol-Myers and other investigator s, it was felt that a single dose (SD) daily of 
Protocol 2004-0817

Page 5 of 36 
 
dasatinib (140 mg SD as opposed to 70 mg BID) may prove more 
effective.  We propose to treat an additional [ADDRESS_671196] cohort of 25 patients.  This woul d allow enough patients to evaluate 
efficacy:toxicity in order to desi gn the FDA pi[INVESTIGATOR_517599].  
2.2 Update as of July 8, 2011 
Two patients with mastocytosis remain  on study for over 5 years with 
symptom control and stability of the di sease.  The update reflects current 
monitoring practice in pat ients on long term therapy. 
 
3.0 BACKGROUND DRUG INFORMATION 
Dasatinib, at a dose of 70 mg orally twice a day, with continuous daily dosing, 
has activity, as defined by [CONTACT_517624], in all phases of CML refractory 
to imatinib.  
 Dasatinib is a potent, orally active inhi bitor of the BCR-ABL, c-kit, and the SRC 
family of kinases, which play critical roles in oncogenesis and persistence of malignant phenotypes. In preclinical studi es, dasatinib has been shown to be a 
more potent inhibitor of BCR-ABL and c-kit than imatinib mesylate.
31 Dasatinib is 
also active in patient-derived CML cells t hat are resistant to imatinib mesylate, 
and an in vivo  xenograft model of imatinib-resistant CML. A phase I study 
(CA180002) was conducted to determine th e safety profile, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics of dasatinib in patient s with CML who have primary or acquired 
hematologic resistance to or intolerance of imatinib mesylate. This study has 
provided preliminary evidence of efficacy of this compound as  demonstrated by 
[CONTACT_517625].  CA180005, was designed to further evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety of dasatinib  in patients with imatinib-refractory, 
accelerated phase CML.

3.1.1 Preclinical Antitumor Activity  
In Vitro Molecular Studies.  Dasatinib competes with ATP for the 
ATP-binding site in the kinase domain of selected protein tyrosine 
kinases (PTKs) and has been shown to inhibit at least five protein 
tyrosine kinases/kinase families: SRC family kinases (IC50: SRC = 
0.55 nM, LCK = 1.1 nM, YES = 0.41 nM, FYN = 0.2 nM); BCR-ABL 
(3 nM); c-kit (22 nM); EPHA2 ( 17 nM); and the PDGFb receptor (28 
nM). Dasatinib is much more potent than imatinib against several important tyrosine kinases, as outlined in Table 1 below.

Cellular Studies.  Dasatinib inhibits the BCR-ABL kinase with an in 
vitro IC
50 of 3 nM, a potency that was 260-fold greater than that of 
imatinib mesylate (IC50 = 790 nM). In cellular assays, dasatinib 
killed or inhibited the prolifer ation of all BCR-ABL dependent 
leukemic cell lines tested to dat e. Dasatinib also demonstrated 
undiminished antitumor activity ag ainst several preclinically- and 
clinically-derived model s of imatinib mesylate resistance. In the 
K562/imatinib mesylate/R model (derived from continuous 
exposure of K562 cells to clinica lly achievable concentration of 
imatinib mesylate), imatinib mesylate was 6-fold less effective than 
in the parent K562 line (IC50 of 1288 nM and 217 nM in the resistant 
and parental cell lines, respectively), while dasatinib remained approximately equally active against both cell lines (IC
50 of 0.7 nM 
(vs. the parent line) and 1.03 nM (vs. the resistant line)). The 
mechanism by [CONTACT_9444] K562/imatinib mesylate/R became resistant to 
imatinib mesylate is not fully understood, but molecular studies 
demonstrated that the resistant  cells show [ADDRESS_671197] sequencing of  the ABL portion of BCR-ABL 
gene failed to reveal any mutations.  
 
A second imatinib mesylate-resistant K562 subline (designated 
K562-R; IC
50 > 10 mM)33  
independently established by 
[CONTACT_517626] M.D. Anderson C ancer Center from  the sensitive 
parent line by [CONTACT_517627] K562 cells to high 
concentration of imatinib mesylate revealed overexpression of LYN, 
another member of the SRC family tyrosine kinases. Evidence that 
SRC family kinase overexpression may play a role in clinical 
resistance to imatinib mesylate wa s demonstrated in three CML cell 
lines established from patients who failed imatinib mesylate 
therapy. These cells remained highly sensitive to the cell-killing effects of dasatinib.
34  Table 2 shows the IC 50 of dasatinib 
compared to the IC 50  of imatinib in t hese three cell lines.

xenografts, dasatinib was curative  over a 20-fold dose range (2.5-
50 mpk) when it was administered orally (PO), once-a-day for 10 days (QD x 10), with a 2-day br eak following every 5 days of 
treatment (5-days-on, 2-days-off). Imatinib mesylate, administered 
on an optimized dosing regimen (thr ee-times-a-day, every day for 
10 consecutive days) failed to elicit  significant cures at its maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) of 150 mg/kg/ administration, although it did 
produce significant growth delay.  
 
Against the K562/imatinib me sylate/R CML model that had 
acquired resistance to imatinib  mesylate, dasatinib produced 
equally impressive activity similar to that seen in the K562 model. 
At doses of 50, 30, or 15 mg/kg/ adm, using an identical treatment 
schedule as described above, dasatinib was curative in 100% of the treated animals. In contrast, at its optimal dose and schedule (150 mpk TID x 10 days), imatin ib mesylate was inactive.  
 
3.1.2 Preclinical Toxicology  
Additional information related to the preclinical toxicology of 
dasatinib is available in the Investigator Brochure
32 and a BMS 
report.35  
 
Principal repeat-dose drug-related toxicities were manifested in the GI, hematopoietic (bone marrow) , and lymphoid systems of rats 
and in the GI and lymphoid systems of monkeys. GI, bone marrow, and lymphoid toxicities were c onsidered the major causes of 
morbidity and death in rats.  
 
Systemic exposure to dasatinib increased with increasing dose; 
Protocol 2004-0817 
July 11, 2011 
Page 8 of 36 
 
there were no apparent sex-related differences. For rats, systemic 
exposure (AUC) decreased with repeated administration ~12 to 
47% at dasatinib doses of ‡ 79.2 mg/m2. For monkeys, there were 
no apparent differences in systemic exposure with repeated dosing.  
 
In an in vitro  receptor and ion-channel ligand binding assay, 
dasatinib had no significant inhibito ry effect on any of the 42 
different receptors and ion channels investigated.  
 
Safety pharmacology of dasatinib was evaluated by [CONTACT_517628]-dose toxicity 
studies. Dasatinib in vitro  activity in the HERG/IKr and Purkinje-
fiber assays indicated a moderat e liability for prolongation of 
cardiac ventricular repolarization (QT interval) in the clinic. 
However, there were no dasatinib-related changes observed in electrocardiograms, nervous system  function, respi[INVESTIGATOR_517600], blood pressure, or  arterial oxygen saturation in 
single-dose, 10-day, or 1-month oral toxicity studies in monkeys.   Because dasatinib inhibits LCK, it could potentially cause immunosuppression by [CONTACT_517629] s effects on T-cell proliferation 
and activation. At doses that are e fficacious in xenografts, dasatinib 
had no immunosuppressive effects in a preclinical model of solid organ transplantation that assesses gr aft rejection as the endpoint. 
By [CONTACT_22242], dasatinib suppressed T-ce ll proliferation or activation in 
mixed-lymphocyte reaction assays at doses that are efficacious in xenografts. However, the introduc tion of a 2-day drug holiday 
ameliorated this toxicity.

Finally, modulation of SRC kinase  activity could also affect 
osteoclast morphology and function and bone remodeling. Dasatinib was shown to have a potent inhibitory activity in vitro in 
the rat fetal bone resorption assay with IC
50 of 2.0 nM, and in vivo 
when administered subcutaneously in the acute thyro-parathyroidectomized rat model at 10 mg/kg. This effect could potentially result in an increase in bone mineral density and a phenotype analogous to osteopetrosis.

In conclusion, single or repeated or al administration of dasatinib 
principally affected the GI (inc luding hepatic), hematopoietic, and 
lymphoid systems in rats and monk eys. Other prominent effects 
after single oral administrati on of dasatinib included renal and 
cardiac toxicity in rats at le thal doses, and cutaneous hemorrhage 
in monkeys. Dasatinib can also effect the immune system and bone 
turnover. These nonclinical studies  identified significant target-
organ toxicities of dasatinib and established 180 mg/m2 as the 
single-dose rat STD 10 and 79.2 mg/m2 as the 1-month repeat-dose 
rat STD 10. These results suggest that the repeat-dose toxicity of 
dasatinib is less than additive, which is consistent with the modest decrease in systemic exposure observed in the rat after repeated dosing. In monkeys, a single dose of 180 mg/m
2 (equivalent to the 
rat single-dose STD10) and a repeat dose of 60 mg/ m2 
(approximately 75% of t he rat repeat-dose STD 10) were generally 
well tolerated, providing a basis for the selection of the starting 
dose of dasatinib in CA180002, the first-in-human phase I dose-escalation study.  
 
3.1.3  Preclinical Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption.  The extent of oral absor ption of dasatinib varied 
among species.
38 The oral bioavailabilit y ranged from 15.2% in 
monkeys to 34% in dogs, with the average oral bioavailability in mice and in rats being 16 and 27%, respectively.  
 
Distribution.  Dasatinib is highly bound (> 91%) to proteins in 
mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human sera, and its blood to plasma 
concentration ratio ranges from 1.1 in rat to 1.8 in human.
38 The 
average steady-state volume of distribution of dasatinib in the mouse, rat, dog, and monkey is 4.2, 6.3, 4.7, and 3.5 L/kg, 
respectively. These values are greater than the total body water volume of each of these species, indicating extensive extravascular 
distribution across species.  
 
Metabolism.  The metabolic stability of das atinib in mouse, rat, 
dog, monkey and human hepatocytes predicts a moderate clearance in all five species.  
 
Incubations with recombinant human cytochrome P450 isozymes suggest that dasatinib is primar ily metabolized by [CONTACT_2750]3A4 
enzyme. Many other enzymes, however, appear capable of metabolizing dasatinib, including CYP1A1, 2C9, 2E1, FMO3, 1B1, 
2B6, 2A6, 2C8, and 4A1. It is unknown at this time what contributions these enzymes may have to the total metabolic clearance of dasatinib.  
 
The biotransformations of dasatinib  in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, 
Protocol 2004-[ADDRESS_671200] cannulated rats treated with the 
compound.  
 
Elimination.  Following an intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg of 
dasatinib to bile-duct cannulated rats, the percent of the dose excreted in the urine and bile at  the end of 9 hours was 0.8 and 
9.6%, respectively, implying that the major route of elimination of 
dasatinib is by [CONTACT_89411].
[ADDRESS_671201] a narrow therapeutic index.
38 
 Systemic exposures to these medications 
could be increased while re ceiving dasatinib. In in vitro  studies, 
dasatinib is a strong inhibi tor of the human CYP3A4 (IC 50 of 1.9 
mM) and a weak inhibitor of  CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 (IC 50 of > 100 
mM), CYP2C9 (IC 50 of 63 mM) and CYP2C19 (IC 50 of 32 mM). Until 
information regarding exposure-t oxicity and exposure-response 
relationships are available with dasatinib, concomitant CYP3A4 
inhibitors and inducers should be avoided, if possible, since they could alter the systemic exposure to dasatinib. Incubations with recombinant human cytochrome P450 isozymes suggest that dasatinib is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_2750]3A4 enzyme (see Section 5.3.2).   
 
3.[ADDRESS_671202] Bcr-Abl, c-kit, PDGFR, and other 
recently discovered kinases (e.g. FIP1  L1- PDGR R in HES) explains its 
efficacy, not only in Ph-positive CML and ALL, but also perhaps in other 
hematologic cancers includ ing HES, mastocytosis, PV (response rates of 
50%), and to a lesser extent in MMM and AML.  Dasatinib is a dual Abl/Src inhibitor.  In preclinical m odels and in Phase I 
studies in CML, it appears to be far more potent than imatinib.  The 
potency of dasatinib in some models  is [ADDRESS_671203] PDGFR, 
and > 1,[ADDRESS_671204] Scr.  Thus, it is reasonable to investigate in 
clinical trials the potential activity of dasatinib in hematologic cancers in 
which these kinases might be operat ive.  These include AML-MDS,

patient was enrolled in Novem ber 2003.  As of April 2005, [ADDRESS_671206] been enrolled: [ADDRESS_671207] phase CML and 5 in Ph+ ALL. 
Chronic phase CML subjects were in itially treated with a QD 5 days 
on/2 days off schedule and later t he protocol was amended to 
include BID 5 days on/2 days off and BID continuous daily dosing 
(CDD) schedules.  A total of [ADDRESS_671208] enrolled in doses 
ranging from 15 - 180 mg QD and 25 - 70 mg BID on the 5 days on/2 days off schedule and 70 - 90 mg BID on the CDD schedule.  All 44 subjects with advanced phas e disease were enrolled in dose 
cohort ranging 35 - 120 mg BID CDD. 
Chronic Phase CML 
Of the 40 chronic phase CML subj ects, 53% were male and 47% 
were female.  The median age was 61 years.  The median duration 
of CML was 8 years (range 1-17).  Eighty percent were clinically 
resistant to imatinib and 20% were intolerant.  Intolerance included 
hepatotoxicity, rash or avascu lar necrosis that required 
discontinuation of imatinib.  Mo st subjects had received > 600 
mg/day of imatinib (65%).  On ly 38% previously had a major 
cytogenetic response to imatinib.  Seventy-four percent were found 
to have a mutation in the BCR-ABL  protein that has been reported 
in the literature to confer resi stance to imatinib.  The median

Complete hematologic responses  were seen in 87% of the 
evaluable subjects.  The over all cytogenetic response rate was 
59%.  Cytogenetic and hematologic responses were also examined 
in patients sub grouped according to  mutational status, resistance 
versus intolerance and BID versus QD dosing.  No differences in 
response were observed between the different dose regimens.  
However, hematologic and cytogenetic  responses were higher in 
imatinib intolerant compared to  imatinib resistant subjects. 
Advanced Phase CML and Ph+ ALL 
There were [ADDRESS_671211] phase CML and 5 
Ph+ ALL subjects enrolled in CA 180-002 as of April 2005.  There 
were 59% male and 41% female.  The median age for accelerated 
phase CML subjects was [ADDRESS_671212] phase CML/Ph+ ALL

5.0  TREATMENT PLAN 
5.1  General 
All patients should be r egistered with the Data Management Office PDMS 
system. Dasatinib will be supplied by [CONTACT_414]-Myers Squibb Company.  
Patients will be assigned an identif ying number once registered.   
Protocol 2004-0817

5.2  Treatment Plan 
Patients will receive therapy accordi ng to the suggested guidelines below. 
Individual variations in the initiation  of therapy, WBC count at start of 
therapy, individual doses are acceptabl e as indicated by [CONTACT_517632].   
 
5.2.1 WBC reduction: hydroxyurea may be used during the first month of 
therapy for control of WBC or other indications.  Use beyond the 
first month will have to be discuss ed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_517605]. 
 5.2.2 Treatment Administration  
Dasatinib will be administered continual ly at an oral dose of 70 mg 
twice daily.  A treatment cycle will be defined as 4 weeks (28 days), 
+ 7 days.  Patients will be instru cted to take Dasatinib in the 
morning (between approximately 6: 00 a.m. - 10:00 a.m.) and in the 
evening (between approximatel y 6:00 p.m. - 10:00 p.m.).  
Patients preferably should not take H 2 blockers.  Short-acting 
antacid agents may be taken, but it is recommended that these not 
be taken from 4 hours before to 4 hours after dosing of dasatinib. 
Patients should avoid taking CYP3A4 inhibitors such as:  
acetaminophen, aldrin, alfentanil, amiodarone, astemizole, benzphetamine, budesonide, car bamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], cyclophosphamide, 
cyclosporin, dapsone, digitoxin, diltiazem, diazepam, erythromycin, ethinylestradiol, etoposide, fl utamide, hydrogxyarginine, 
ifosphamide, imipramine, lansopr azole, lidocaine, loratadine, 
losartan, lovastatin, midazolam, ni fedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], omeprazole, quinidine, 
paclitaxel, rapamycin, retinoic acid , steroids (e.g., cortisol), 
tacrolimus (FK 506), tamoxifene, teniposide, terfenadine, tetrahydrocannabinol, theophylline,  toremifene, triazolam, 
troleandomycin, verapamil, warfarin, za tosetron, or zonisamide.  If 
necessary, they should be taken at least [ADDRESS_671223] of the pat ient to discontinue treatment, 
withdrawal of patient's consent, or for reasons outlined in Sections 
5.2.4 and 5.6.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] For patients with mastocytosis, dasatinib will be given at 140 mg single dose (SD) daily.  H

40-80 mg daily x 7.  
 
5.2.3  Dose Modifications and Escalations  
Patients will be monitored continuous ly for adverse events (toxicity) 
while on study therapy. Patients wil l be instructed to notify their 
physician immediately for any and all toxicity. Patients will continue 
to receive therapy as long as they have not had disease 
progression and all non-hematologic toxicities thought to be related 
to dasatinib are < CTC Grade [ADDRESS_671225] returned to baseline 
(except alopecia and fatigue), and ANC >˜1000/mm3. Potassium 
and magnesium must continue to be within normal limits, and total 
serum calcium or ionized calcium must be greater than the lower limits of normal.  
 
For any dose interruptions (as described below), initiation of additional therapy may be delayed for a maximum of [ADDRESS_671226] their dose increased to 100 mg twice daily upon agreement between the Inve stigator and the Medical 
Monitor/drug supplier. Patients who do not achieve response within 
[ADDRESS_671227] cycle of therapy as long as 
toxicity does not cause discontinuation of therapy.  Patients who achieve response on 70 mg twice daily and subsequently progress 
while on therapy may also escala te their dose to 100 mg twice 
daily.  Patients who progress duri ng 100 mg twice daily dosing will 
discontinue therapy.   Patients with mastocytosis who do not 
respond may be treated at 200 mg SD daily. 
 
Dose Modifications for Non- Hematologic Toxicity.  Criteria for 
dose reductions and discontinuation of  therapy for some specific 
non-hematologic toxicities are descri bed in Table 8.  Guidelines for 
dose reductions and discontinuation from therapy due to other non-
hematologic toxicities are as follows:  
 
• If a patient has CTC Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity (except 
alopecia or fatigue) thought to be at least possibly related to 
dasatinib, treatment should be interrupted until the toxicity decreases to < Grade 1 or to base lines levels. Therapy will then 
be reinitiated at the original dose. There should be no attempt to make up for doses omitted due to toxicity. If the same Grade 2 
non-hematologic toxicity recurs upon retreatment with the original dose, treatment will again  be interrupted until the toxicity 
Protocol 2004-0817 
July 11, 2011 
Page 22 of 36 
 
decreases to < Grade 1 or return s to baselines levels. Therapy 
with dasatinib will then be reinit iated at the next dose reduction 
level.  If the same Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity recurs 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_264265], a second dose reduction is permitted.  Additional therapy following a second dose reduction 
vs. discontinuation of the patient from further protocol therapy 
will be discussed and agreed upon by [CONTACT_737].  Therapy 
can be permitted to continue with a Grade 2 non-hematologic 
toxicity if continuing treatment of  the patient’s c ancer is thought 
to outweigh the risk of the toxi city and the toxicity does not 
progress to Grade 3.  This wi ll only be applicable after two 
attempts of dose reduction. 
 
• Patients who experience CTC Grade [ADDRESS_671228] 
their treatment interrupted until the toxicity decreases to < 
Grade 1 or to baseline levels. Th erapy with dasatinib will then 
be reinitiated at the next dose reduction level. If the same Grade 
3 non-hematologic toxicity recurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_264265], a second dose reduction is permitted. Additional therapy following a second dose reduction vs. discont inuation of the patient from 
further protocol therapy will be discussed and agreed upon with the Investigator. There should be  no attempt to make up for 
doses omitted due to toxicity.   
 
• Patients who experience a CTC Grade [ADDRESS_671229] po ssibly related to dasatinib will 
generally not receive additional protocol therapy and be removed from study. Additional t herapy following a resolution in 
this Grade 4 toxicity to < Grade [ADDRESS_671230] of the patient to receive 
additional therapy with dasatinib (for example, if this or other 
patients have demonstrated a response to therapy).

above scheme (i.e., dose reduce or  discontinue at a lower grade 
of non-hematologic toxicity) based on the clinical judgment of 
the Investigator. With the ex panded NCI CTCAE Version 3, 
some Grade [ADDRESS_671231] occurrence. Also, patient s experiencing some Grade 3 
organ toxicities (e.g., renal, cardiac, CNS) judged to be related 
to study therapy should be disco ntinued from therapy. Patients 
with a QTc >[ADDRESS_671232] any evidence of serious bleeding or hemorrhage (e.g., cutaneous, GI, etc) must be discu ssed with the Investigator for 
possible dose adjustment or to  have therapy discontinued.  
 
• Abnormalities of LDH, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, albumin, 
calcium, phosphorus, uric acid, magnesium, electrolytes will be 
noted and corrected but will not mandate changes in dasatinib doses.  
• Dose adjustments may be made at the discretion of the treating 
physician for patients on therapy >[ADDRESS_671233] dose is 140mg.  Occasional missed doses of 
therapy will not be considered as protocol violations/deviations.

5.3 Prohibited and Restricted  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_239981]  
 5.3.1 Prohibited Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_517610], with the exception of 
anagrelide hydrochloride for the tr eatment of elev ated platelet 
counts and hydroxyurea will be permi tted while the patient is on 
study. Use of anagrelide and hydrox yurea, as well as colony-
stimulating factors (e.g., G-CSF,  GM-CSF, etc) and erythropoietin, 
is permitted at the discretion of the treating physician after 
discussion with the PI.  Medications associated with QT prolongation that are prohibited on this study include:  
• quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide  • amiodarone, sotalol,  ibutilide, dofetilide  
• erythromycins, clarithromycin  • chlorpromazine, haloperidol, mesoridazine, thioridazine, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_517611] 2004-0817 
July 11, 2011 
Page 26 of 36 
 
• cisapride, bepridil, droperidol , methadone, arsenic, chloroquine, 
domperidone, halofantrine, levomethadyl, pentamidine, 
sparfloxacin, lidoflazine.  
 
Except for anagrelide and hydroxyurea, patients are prohibited from 
taking medications that directly inhi bit platelet function (i.e., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], 
dipyridamole, epoprostenol, eptifib atide, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], cilostazol, 
abciximab, ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325], ) or anticoa gulants (warfarin, heparin/low 
molecular weight heparin [e.g., danaparoid, dalteparin, tinzaparin, 
enoxaparin]) while on study ther apy. Low-dose warfarin for 
prophylaxis to prevent catheter thrombosis, and heparin-flushes for 
IV lines is permitted.  
 
Ideally, subjects enrolled in this study should not be taking and not 
begin taking medications known to  prolong the QT interval.  
However, should the Investigator believe that be ginning therapy 
with a potentially QT prolonging m edication (other than the ones 
explicitly prohibited) is vital to  an individual subject’s care, the 
Investigator must check that the subject’s prior on-therapy ECG has 
not shown a QTcF ≥ 480 msec or an increase in QTc ≥ 60 msec 
over the baseline value.  Additi onal ECG(s) will be done one week 
later or more at the Investigator’s  discretion to ensure the subject’s 
safety. 
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_671238] a narrow therapeutic index.  Systemic exposures to these 
medications could be increased while receiving dasatinib.  In in 
vitro studies, dasatinib is a strong inhibitor of the human CYP3A4 
enzyme and a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. 
dasatinib shows time-dependent i nhibition of CYP3A4; however, 
there appears to be a low probability  for drug-drug interactions due 
to metabolism-dependent CYP3A4 i nactivation.  Results from an in 
vitro hPXR trans-activation study s uggest that dasatinib has little 
potential to induce CYP3A4 through the activation of hPXR. Until information regarding exposure-toxicity and exposure-
response relationships is avail able with dasatinib, concomitant 
CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers should be avoided, if possible, since they could alter the system ic exposure to dasatinib.  
Incubations with recombinant human CYP450 isozymes suggest that dasatinib is primarily meta bolized by [CONTACT_2750]3A4 enzyme.  
Many other enzymes appear capabl e of metabolizing dasatinib, 
including CYP1A1, 2C9, 2E1, FM O3, 1B1, 2B6, 2A6, 2C8, and 
Protocol 2004-0817

4A1; however, it is unknown at this  time what contributions these 
enzymes may have to the total me tabolic clearance of dasatinib. 
In vitro solubility data indicate that dasatinib may have decreased 
solubility and absorption at  pH > 4.  Until furt her data are available, 
subjects should try to avoid taki ng proton pump inhibitors and H 2 
antagonists.  Short-acting antacid agents may be taken, but it is 
recommended that these not be tak en from 4 hours before to 4 
hours after dosing of dasatinib.  
 
5.4 Non-therapy Precautions and Restrictions  
Based on preclinical data, dasatinib may increase the likelihood of 
bleeding. Hence, patients undergoing surgical procedures, including 
dental procedures should be instructed to  inform their other doctors of this 
potential increase in bleeding. 
 
5.5 The above are general guidelines to changes in therapy.  However, 
individual variations including dose esca lations or reductions as indicated 
by [CONTACT_517633], are allowed, if felt to be 
needed to optimize therapy. Discuss dose schedule reductions with Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_517612]. 
 
5.5 Duration of Therapy 
Patients may continue on therapy indef initely until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity.  
6.0 PRETREATMENT EVALUATION

10.0  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
This is an open-label, phase II study in which patients with any of these possible 
hematopoietic malignancies w ill be treated with dasatinib.  
 
The primary objective for the study is to determine the activity of dasatinib when 
given to patients in the following patient groups:  
 1. C-kit positive AML-MDS 2. Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_517615] 3. HES 4. PV 5. Mastocytosis 6. Myelofibrosis – myeloid metaplasia  Safety and tolerability of dasatinib in these patient groups wil l be assessed.  An 
assessment of biological activity of das atinib in these patient groups will be 
performed, using a variety of laboratory correlative studies, including gene and 
protein expression; blast, plasma, and medul lary levels of significant growth 
factors; receptor tyrosine kinase levels and phosphorylation status; and 
measurements of apoptosis of hemat opoietic malignant cells. cells.   
 
10.1 Sample Size Considerations  
Because dasatinib has a unique mechanism  of action, a response rate as 
low as 10% is of interest for furt her investigation. A minimum-maximum 
total of 14-25 patients will be entered in each diagnostic group, for a total of 145 patients on the trial. This sample size will yield an 82% posterior credibility interval for P
R (probability of response) of width approximately 
0.16. 
 
If, for example, 3/25 (12%) responses are observed, the 82% posterior credibility interval will range fr om 2% to 18%, formally:   
 
 Pr  .02<P
R<.18  3/25 responses [] =0.82. 
 
For each group, there will be one interim analysis after [ADDRESS_671242] been observed. This is based on a Ba yesian criterion to stop if: 
 
Protocol 2004-0817 
July 11, 2011 
Page 32 of 36 
 
Pr  PR>0.1  data []  < 0.10,  assuming a  beta .2,  1.8 ()  prior on PR. 
 
Using these guidelines, simulation results indicate the following 
probabilities of early termination fo r several possible true rates of 
response: 
 
True Response Rate Prob. early termination 
.[ADDRESS_671243] exposure of patients to an agent 
with minimal activity, the aggregate response rate (CR+PR) will be reviewed periodically.  If response rate s of less than or equal to 1 in 26 
patients, less than or equal to 2 in 42 pat ients, or less than or equal to 3 in 
55 patients are observed, this would be evidence that the probability of 
<10% activity among this group of di seases is > 90%.  Any decision 
regarding early termination of the st udy would take into account all 
findings in the individual disease groups.  An objective response refers to 
the cumulative responses (e.g. CR + PR + improved) for each disease category.  The secondary objectives include anal ysis for the duration of response 
and survival.  Response duration is from date of first response until relapse.  Survival is from start of  therapy.  They will be done using the 
Kaplan-Meier estimators, the log-rank tests and the Cox-Cox-proportional 
hazards models. For correlative studies, the analysis for continuous 
variables will be done using thet- tests,  linear regression models, etc. The 
analysis for categorical variables wil l be done using the chi-square tests 
and the logistic regression models.   
 
11.0 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
11.1 Reporting requirements will be as per institutional guidelines (Appendix 
C).  Exceptions will include:

Version Date: 3/25/[ADDRESS_853880]-Disease
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) has been used increasingly for 
malignant and non-malignant disorders 1. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major 
complication and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_638487]. GVHD 
results from immunologic attack by [CONTACT_183947]’s immune cells on the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s tissues and 
organs. Incidence and severity of GVHD vary depending on degree of mismatch of major 
histocompatibility antigens of the donor and host, age of donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], source of stem 
cells, and type of preparative regimen2.  Development of non-myeloablative conditioning 
regimens has led to a decrease in early post-transplant mortality and an increase in chronic 
GVHD (cGVHD). Almost 70% of patients who survive more than [ADDRESS_853881] for months to years and requires long-term 
multidisciplinary management.
1.2.2 Oral involvement in cGVHD
Oral cGVHD is a common, major cause of morbidity and decrease in health-related quality of 
life (HRQOL) in long-term alloHSCT survivors10,13-15. In a recent randomized trial of peripheral 
blood stem cell (PBSC) vs. bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) transplants, oral mucosal changes 
were the most common manifestation of cGVHD in BMSC recipi[INVESTIGATOR_638488] (after skin) in PBSC transplants. Overall incidence in cGVHD was around 85%3. Oral 
manifestations of cGVHD include lichen planus-like changes, mucosal atrophy and ulcerations, 
taste disturbances, and salivary gland hypofunction. Oral pain and food sensitivity are common, 
and not limited to patients with ulcerations10,16,17.  Oral discomfort was shown to be associated 
with decrease in food intake and weight loss in this group of patients10,18.  Recently, the 
contribution of oral cGVHD to inferior health-related QOL was reported 10,19. There have been 
several reports of increased incidence of oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) after allo-HSCT, 
with history of oral cGVHD identified as an independent risk factor20,21.
1.2.3
cGVHD Therapy
[IP_ADDRESS] Systemic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_638489], most 
commonly systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, sirolimus and 
phototherapy9. Long-term immunosuppressive treatment for GVHD has a variety of serious 
complications including life-threatening infections, aseptic bone necrosis, hypertension, and 
secondary diabetes.6,22

prevent development of dermal dendritic cells in vitro.24. Additionally, topi[INVESTIGATOR_638490]8+T cells25.
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_638491] 0.01% oral rinse and clobetasol 0.05% ointment 
are used widely for treatment of oral cGVHD, although their efficacy has not been formally 
evaluated in this condition4.  Ointments and creams have a disadvantage of uneven and 
cumbersome application, furthermore, it is difficult to estimate the systemic versus local effect. 
Unlike solutions used as rinses, ointments can be easily swallowed and absorbed through the 
gastrointestinal tract. At the NIH Clinical Center, both dexamethasone oral rinse and clobetasol 
ointment have been used with variable success. In general, complicated application procedures 
reduce compliance and make evaluation of response difficult. Oral rinses have a particular 
advantage when a significant oral cavity area is affected as the contact [CONTACT_638534].
[IP_ADDRESS] Clobetasol
Clobetasol is a readily available corticosteroid used topi[INVESTIGATOR_94954] a wide variety of inflammatory 
conditions. Clobetasol 0.05% ointment is FDA approved for the treatment of inflammatory skin 
diseases and clobetasol spray is approved for psoriasis. Clobetasol ointment is widely used 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_638492], a condition clinically and pathologically similar to oral cGVHD and has been 
shown to be safe and effective26-28. When used 2 times a day for 4-8 weeks, the response rates 
exceeded 90%.28,[ADDRESS_853883] common being oral candidiasis. To reduce incidence of oral candidiasis infection, 
patients will be asked to swish and spit once per day with nystatin (100,000u/ml) rinse, which is 
a standard preventative measure in high-risk patients.  Although there have been reports of 
adrenal suppression associated with high potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826], these were generally rare and 
occurred primarily in young children and in patients with large surface areas of involvement 
(skin). In one study, no changes in morning cortisol levels were observed when clobetasol was 
applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_638493] [ADDRESS_853884] indicated signs and symptoms of adrenal suppression in patients with severe erosion of the 
oral mucosa, as in erosive oral lichen planus, and long term use (years) of topi[INVESTIGATOR_612629]30,31. 
The effe

Version Date: 3/25/[ADDRESS_853886] the malignancy (the graft vs. tumor effect), which is 
the principal mechanism through which reduced intensity transplants achieve sustained disease 
remission.
Therefore, we propose this pi[INVESTIGATOR_638495] 0.05% oral rinse for oral cGVHD. Consenting subjects with clinically significant oral 
cGVHD will be randomized to receive clobetasol or placebo oral rinse for 2 weeks. All subjects 
will be evaluated biweekly. Clinically significant oral cGVHD is defined as a score of 20 or 
greater on the Oral Mucositis Rating Scale (OMRS) based on the patient cohort (over 250) seen 
in the NIH natural history of cGVHD protocol. At the first 2 week appointment, patients will be 
unblinded and subjects randomized to placebo will be assigned to additional 2-4 week open label 
treatment period with topi[INVESTIGATOR_638496]. All patients will therefore complete 4 weeks of 
treatment with the study drug (2 additional weeks for patients originally assigned to clobetasol 
arm and 4 weeks for patients assigned to placebo arm). All patients will be reevaluated [ADDRESS_853887] follow-up data.
Patients with progressive disease while on the clobetasol treatment as determined at any 
scheduled evaluation visit will be considered non-responders for the primary endpoint evaluation 
and will be taken off-study. Within 90 days of the end of the open label treatment period, all 
patients with evidence of benefit (response or stable disease) will be given an option to continue 
treatment with clobetasol 0.05% with or without additional treatment as deemed clinically 
necessary, up to one month. The proportion of responders in the active and placebo arm will be 
used as the primary outcome variable. As no standard definition of oral cGVHD response exists, 
for purposes of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], response will be defined as decrease of 25% or more on the 
OMRS (Appendix A ). Difference in OMRS scores between the groups at the end of the 2 week 
blinded period and the change in OMRS score between beginning and the end of the 4 week 
treatment period with clobetasol oral rinse will serve as a secondary outcome variables. The 
study schedule of events is outlined in Appendix E.
The placebo design is justified by [CONTACT_716]: a) there is no proven standard topi[INVESTIGATOR_638497], b) patients will be unblinded after 2 weeks of treatment (defined in Section 
3.2.4) and those on placebo will be allowed to cross over to the alternate treatment arm. This will 
allow all participants to receive the study drug for [ADDRESS_853888] benefit to the cGVHD patients, this study is likely to provide 
valuable insights into the cellular and molecular alterations associated with the development of 
cGVHD and treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930]. This will lead to better understanding of the 
pathogenesis of cGVHD needed as the foundation for development of new therapeutic 
interventions.

1will be forwarded electronically via e-mail to the research team. Voicemail is available during 
non-working hours. 
2.4 RANDOMIZATION (OR STRATIFICATION) PROCEDURES:
[CONTACT_166452] will create the randomization lists using variable block sizes.  Patients will be 
randomized with a single stratification factor to try to ensure a balanced distribution among those 
getting placebo or not initially: being identified as having a high intensity of immunosuppression 
(2 or more agents/modalities ± prednisone≥0.5 mg/kg/day) vs. no or a lesser intensity of 
systemic immunosuppression according to the Intensity of Immunosuppression Scale10.  
Once patients have been evaluated and meet all eligibility requirements, patients will be 
registered with the NCI Central Registration Office and be randomized to either clobetasol or 
placebo.  Change of systemic immunosuppressive regimen occurring after enrollment will not be 
allowed, and if this is necessary during the 2-week blinded phase of the study to control 
progressive systemic cGVHD, the patient will come off the study.  Other medication changes 
will be documented at the interim or final (end of treatment) appointment and taken into 
consideration in the final analysis. However, given the small, pi[INVESTIGATOR_109248], it is 
unlikely that the effect of all potential confounders can be meaningfully taken into account.
3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 STUDY DESIGN
This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, pi[INVESTIGATOR_638481] 0.05% topi[INVESTIGATOR_638500]-over or extension period. Consenting subjects with clinically 
significant oral chronic GVHD will be randomized to clobetasol 0.05% or placebo oral rinse. 
The placebo will be flavored with quinine, to approximate the “bitter” taste of clobetasol.  
Subjects will be evaluated at bi-weekly intervals while on the study intervention. OMRS score 
will serve as the primary outcome measure. At the first 2 week interim appointment patients will 
be unblinded and started on the clobetasol oral rinse open label. In the absence of progressive 
oral disease on the scheduled interim evaluations during the 4-week clobetasol treatment period, 
all patients will complete a total of 4 weeks of treatment with clobetasol. Therefore, patients who 
were originally assigned to clobetasol arm will receive additional 2 weeks of treatment, and 
patients assigned to placebo arm will undergo an additional 4 weeks of treatment with clobetasol 
after unblinding. Patients with progressive disease after 2 weeks of therapy with clobetasol will 
be considered non-responders, taken off-treatment and treated as appropriate in consultation with 
primary clinician. Within 90 days of the end of the 1 month of treatment, all patients with 
evidence of benefit (response or stable disease) will be given an option to continue treatment 
with clobetasol 0.05% with or without additional treatment as deemed clinically necessary for 1 
month after the conclusion of the initial treatment period. Additional follow-up appointment will 
be scheduled for all patients 1 month after completion of treatment. The change in OMRS scores 
from baseline to 4 weeks of mouth rinse usage will be the primary outcome variable.  For the 
placebo group, the OMRS score at the end of the blinded phase/beginning of clobetasol rinse use 
(day 14) will serve as the baseline for the primary outcome.  Difference in OMRS score between 
the groups (placebo and clobetasol) at the end of the 14-day blinded phase will serve as a 
secondary outcome measure. The study schedule of events is outlined in Appendix G.

3.2 DRUG A DMINISTRATION
3.2.1 Clobetasol Administration
Clobetasol 0.05% oral rinse and placebo rinse which will be identical in appearance and taste 
will be labeled and dispensed by [CONTACT_195232]. Subjects will be instructed 
to rinse oral cavity 3 times daily with the 10 cc of the study medication for 2 minutes and spit out 
and not to eat, drink, or brush teeth for 30 minutes after the study drug administration. 
Additionally, the use of oral topi[INVESTIGATOR_34499] (viscous lidocaine) will not be allowed for [ADDRESS_853894] day of 
treatment.
3.2.3 Progressive disease 
Patients with progressive oral cGVHD after 2 weeks of treatment with the clobetasol oral rinse 
will be taken off study. See also Section 6.3.1. 
3.2.4 Treatment after 2 week blinded phase
Patients who switch to the clobetasol arm due to initial placebo assignment will be treated with 
clobetasol 0.05% oral rinse for [ADDRESS_853895] be discussed with the PI, or LAI. Given favorable toxicity profile of 
clobetasol, no treatment modifications are expected. Grade 2 – [ADDRESS_853896] be documented at baseline. Expected pre-existing 
manifestations of cGVHD or systemic steroid therapy may include the following examples: 
fatigue, colitis, cushingoid appearance, anorexia, dyspepsia, xerostomia, parotid swelling, 
nausea, taste alteration, arthritis, fibrosis, myositis, osteonecrosis, osteopenia, dry eye, watery 
eye, pain, dyspnea, vaginal dryness, skin atrophy, alopecia, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], skin dryness, 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], nail changes, photosensitivity, pruritus, rash, and ulcers12. In the event of 
grade 2-3 adverse event attributable to study agent that cannot be easily alleviated without 
compromising the integrity of the study (such as severe local or systemic hypersensitivity) the 
subject will be taken off study and treated appropriately as detailed in Protocol Evaluations 
3.3.1 Pre-Treatment Evaluation

3.5 QUESTIONNAIRES 
3.5.1 Oral Mucositis Rating Scale
Description. The OMRS was constructed through the careful selection of clinical descriptors of 
oral mucosal changes related to GVHD and also related to BMT16. The OMRS was developed 
“…as a research tool for the comprehensive measurement of a broad range of oral tissue changes 
associated with cancer therapy” and “to develop an index for assessing acute oral mucositis after 
BMT36”. Preliminary development of this scale was performed in studies of chemotherapy 
toxicities and cGVHD and use of the tool allowed “expedient, efficient, detailed, and 
reproducible classification of oral changes36”.  The OMRS was used by [CONTACT_638535], Sullivan, 
Morton et al. (1984) with [ADDRESS_853900] strongly associated with cGVHD included atrophy and erythema or lichenoid lesions 
of the buccal and labial mucosa and oral pain16.
Abbreviated Title: Clobetasol rinse for oral cGVHD
Version Date: 3/25/[ADDRESS_853901] anatomic areas: lips; labial and buccal 
mucosa; tongue; floor of mouth; palate; and attached gingiva. Each site is further divided into 
upper and lower (lips and labial mucosa), right and left (buccal mucosa), dorsal, ventral, and 
lateral (tongue), and hard and soft (palate). Descriptive categories include atrophy, 
pseudomembrane, erythema, hyperkeratosis, lichenoid, ulceration, and edema. Erythema, 
atrophy, hyperkeratosis, lichenoid, and edema are rated on scales of 0 to 3 (0 = normal/no 
change, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe change). Ulceration and pseudomembrane are 
rated on scores based on estimated surface area involved (0 = none, 1 =  0 but ≤  1cm2, 2 =  
1cm2 but ≤ 2cm2, and 3 =  2cm2). The item pool consists of 91 items for 13 areas of the mouth 
that are assessed for several types of changes. The score is obtained by [CONTACT_638536] a total possible score ranging from 0 to 273.
3.5.2 Painometer 
Description. Pain will be self-assessed by [CONTACT_25439] a paper version of the Painometer , 
contains a visual analogue scale (VAS) to rate overall intensity of pain and a list of 14 sensory 
and 11 affective pain descriptors ranked by [CONTACT_638537] 1 to 5 (POM-WDS)37. The 
POM is capable of capturing the multidimensionality of the pain experience. Patients are asked 
to look at the list of sensory and affective words (POM-WDS) and select sensory and affective 
words that describe their pain. The weighted scores assigned to the selected words are added 
together to obtain a pain intensity score for the sensory as well as for the affective components. 
The weights assigned to the words are derived from research involving people with various 
ethnic and educational backgrounds37.  A vertical 10cm VAS (POM-VAS) is located on the 
POM with a centimeter scale allowing for overall pain intensity quantification. The POM-VAS is 
anchored with the words “no pain” located at the bottom of the scale and the words “worst 
possible pain” located at the top representing the extreme limits of pain. The patient is requested 
to circle a number indicating the amount of pain being experienced at the present time. The pain 
intensity score for the POM-VAS has a range of [ADDRESS_853902] validity of the POM-VAS and the POM-WDS were 
assessed in 279 patients with acute or chronic pain37. The following time intervals were used for 
data collection using the POM: labor pain- admitted to labor and delivery, cervical dilation at 2 
to 4 cm x 2 with a 10-minute interval, cervical dilation at 5 to 7 cm and again at 8 to 10 cm, 
immediately prior to epi[INVESTIGATOR_71545], and another 30 minutes after epi[INVESTIGATOR_71545]; post-operative 
pain-4 hours after the patients were admitted to the recovery room after surgery, each time the 
patient complained of pain, and routinely every 4 hours, prior to and after pain medication was 
given; chronic pain in RA patients on two occasions with a 2-hour interval between each pain 
measurement. Relatively high correlations were found between initial and repeat intensity ratings 
for the POM-VAS (r = .88, p < .001). Test-retest reliability of the POM-WDS ranged from .68 (p 
< .001) to .73 (p < .001) in RA patients, from .80 (p < .001) to 0.84 (p < .001) in labor patients, 
and from .70 (p < .001) to .74 (p < .001) in postoperative patients. Concurrent validity of the 
POM-WDS was supported by [CONTACT_638538]-WDS and the McGill Pain 
Questionnaire (r = .069, p < .001) and POM-VAS (r  = .85, p< .001). Construct validity evidence 
Abbreviated Title: Clobetasol rinse for oral cGVHD
Version Date: 3/25/2025
22was gathered for the POM by [CONTACT_638539]-WDS (t 
= 5.53, p < .001), and POM-VAS (t = 6.18, p < .001) after the patients had received pain 
medication. A correlation between the traditional paper-and-pencil VAS and the POM-VAS was 
reported to be 0.98 (p < .001).
A modified Gaston-Johansson Painometer Assessment Sheet will be used to record the following 
data regarding stomatitis-related acute oropharyngeal pain experienced at rest and with 
swallowing: intensity; sensory and affective descriptive words from the POM-WDS; duration 
(continuous or periodic). 
3.5.[ADDRESS_853903] reported oral pain, oral sensitivity, and oral dryness will be captured through use of a 0 
to 10 visual analogue scale (VAS) anchored with the words “no pain” to “worst pain” (Appendix 
C). We will use this VAS to evaluate these symptoms over treatment.
3.5.4 Global Rating Scale (perception of changes in oral condition)
At the interim and final visits, we will assess patients’ perceptions of the changes in the oral 
condition on a 5 item scale (worsened greatly, worsened somewhat, stayed the same, improved 
somewhat, improved greatly). The data will be correlated with the results from the numerical 
scoring systems to assess internal validity (Appendix D ).
3.5.[ADDRESS_853904] Profile–[ADDRESS_853905] Profile–14 (OHIP-14, Appendix F) is a [ADDRESS_853906] of disease and 
treatment. OHIP-14 has been used in oral disease studies including oral lichen planus (a 
dermatological condition with manifestation similar to chronic oral GVHD). It has been shown 
to have high validity and reliability, and to be sensitive to treatment effects.
3.[ADDRESS_853907] adherence to the trial interventions will be estimated by [CONTACT_638540], study medication use diaries (Appendix 
I) and compliance with clinic visits. Correct use of the study medication will be demonstrated at 
the beginning of the study. Reinforcement such as periodic phone calls by [CONTACT_638541].
3.7 DURATION OF FOLLOW- UP
Patients will be followed for 6 months total after discontinuing clobetasol oral rinse treatment 
every 3 months by [CONTACT_116622]-person interview to assess duration of treatment response, 
recurrence of oral GVHD, survival and resolution of any side-effects.  Patients removed from 
treatment for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the 
adverse event.  Once there is resolution of adverse events, patients will be removed from study.  
Patients who become unavailable within 6 months of completing treatment will not be followed

common is overgrowth of oral candidiasis. Many but not all patients with chronic GVHD are 
already taking antifungal prophylaxis such as oral fluconazole.  Thus, to reduce incidence of oral 
candidiasis infection, patients will be asked to swish and spit once per day with nystatin 
(100,000u/ml) rinse, which is a standard preventative measure in high-risk patients. In case oral 
candidiasis develops, standard therapy according to NIH Consortium guidelines

5.1.[ADDRESS_853912] no more than 10.5 ml/kg or [ADDRESS_853913] no more than 9.5 ml/kg drawn in 8-week study period for research studies.  These 
guidelines are according to The Clinical Center Policy and Communications Bulletin M95-9.  
5.1.2 Additional Analyses
Note:  All samples will be sent for storage until analysis as detailed in Section 5.2 under 
appropriate storage conditions. 
Abbreviated Title: Clobetasol rinse for oral cGVHD
Version Date: 3/25/[ADDRESS_853914] to assess oral cGVHD status.  Half of 
the biopsy will be formalin-fixed and sent to pathology for H&E staining.  One quarter will be 
flash frozen for analysis of gene expression, and one quarter will be frozen in OCT media, and 
both quarters will be stored until analysis. Immunohistochemical and PCR analysis will focus on 
characterization of cellular infiltrate, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and protein mediators 
present at baseline and after clobetasol treatment.   
Whole saliva samples will be examined for evidence of disease-related biomarkers associated 
with cGVHD and clobetasol treatment.  Saliva will be collected in two 5-minute periods, one 
unstimulated and one stimulated with inert chewing (paraffin wax)32.  The volume collected will 
be compared and used to indicate gland function32.  
Blood samples will be used to measure cortisol levels and in a subset of samples, to determine 
blood levels of clobetasol during treatment with the mouth rinse formulation. Heparinized 
plasma and cells will be stored for potential analysis of inflammatory markers and cellularity 
associated with cGVHD and clobetasol treatment.  
One plasma sample (6 ml) will for LC-MS-MS analysis for clobetasol content.  
5.1.3 Pharmacokinetic Studies
To determine if and how much clobetasol is absorbed through the oral mucosa in these cGVHD 
patients, blood levels of clobetasol (6 ml sample) will be monitored at baseline, 2- and 4-weeks 
of clobetasol rinse use.  A random subset of half of the subjects (expected n=17) will be initially 
assessed for clobetasol plasma concentration. The determination of clobetasol concentrations in 
plasma samples, as well as the pharmacokinetic data analysis, will be performed by [CONTACT_131802]. Samples will be analyzed using a validated LC-MS/MS method 
developed at the end of the trial.  If this data indicates a positive correlation between plasma 
clobetasol level and the other study measures of adrenosuppression (ACTH stimulation test, 
morning cortisol levels), or if we see either unexpected clinical or surrogate responses, or wide 
variability in levels, the analysis will be extended to all study patients.  
In a subset of consenting patients (up to n=10), the pharmacokinetics of clobetasol 0.05% mouth 
rinse will be assessed in a single session. After one two-minute oral rinse use, a venous blood 
sample will be collected in a 6 ml sodium heparin (green top) tube (BD Sodium Heparin 367878 
or 367879) at x0, x15-45 and x90-120 minutes. The plasma clobetasol levels from these samples 
will be used to analyze the basic pharmacokinetics of clobetasol 0.5% oral suspension. 
Participation in this part of the study is optional, and a separate section has been included on the 
consent form to allow patients to elect participation or not.  The first 10 patients who consent for 
the pharmacokinetics study will be selected for sampling.  
5.2 SAMPLE STORAGE, TRACKING AND DISPOSITION 
Samples will be ordered in CRIS and tracked through a Clinical Trial Data Management system. 
Should a CRIS screen not be available, the CRIS downtime procedures will be followed. 
Samples will not be sent outside NIH without appropriate approvals and/or agreements, if 
required.

analysis, which will be stored separately by [CONTACT_62545] (CPP) until 
analysis. These will be barcoded, with data entered and stored in the Labmatrix utilized by [CONTACT_638543]. This is a secure program, with access to Labmatrix limited to defined Figg lab personnel, 
who are issued individual user accounts. Installation of Labmatrix is limited to computers 
specified by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Figg. These computers all have a password restricted login screen. 
Labmatrix creates a unique barcode ID for every sample and sample box, which cannot be traced 
back to patients without Labmatrix access. The data recorded for each sample includes the 
patient ID, name, trial name/protocol number, time drawn, cycle time point, dose, material type, 
as well as box and freezer location. Patient demographics associated with the clinical center 
patient number are provided in the system. For each sample, there are notes associated with the 
processing method (delay in sample processing, storage conditions on the ward, etc.).
Barcoded samples are stored in locked freezers at -20 or -80°C (sera and plasma) or under liquid 
nitrogen (cells), or as otherwise applicable according to stability requirements. These freezers are 
located onsite in the BPC and offsite at NCI Frederick Central Repository Services in Frederick, 
MD. Visitors to the laboratory are required to be accompanied by [CONTACT_79922]. 
Access to stored clinical samples is restricted. Samples will be stored until requested by a 
researcher named on the protocol. All requests are monitored and tracked in Labmatrix. All 
researchers are required to sign a form stating that the samples are only to be used for research 
purposes associated with this trial (as per the IRB approved protocol) and that any unused 
samples must be returned to the BPC. It is the responsibility of the NCI Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_83853] a manner consistent with IRB approval.

6.2 ORAL GVHD SEVERITY SCALES
The primary endpoint will be evaluated using expanded oral GVHD severity scale (Appendix 
A)33,34. There is no standard definition of response in this field. The definitions we will use in 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_638510]:
•Progression (PD): defined as increase of 25% of initial score (rounded to the closest 
number) on the OMRS scale (Appendix A ).
•Partial Response (PR): defined as decrease of 25% of initial score (rounded to the 
closest number) on the OMRS scale (Appendix A ).
•Complete 
Response (CR): defined as score of 0 on the erythema and ulceration 
components of the OMRS scale (Appendix A ).
•Stable Disease (SD): does not meet criteria for progression or response.
For the purpose of OMRS instrument evaluation validation, we will also use a simplified scale 
developed for assessment of cGVHD response in the oral cavity (Appendix B)35. Scoring will be 
performed by [CONTACT_638545]. As part of the evaluation

7.4 NIH REQUIRED DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN
Serious adverse events potentially attributable to the study medication or procedures will be 
reported to IRB. If trends are noted and/or risks warrant it, accrual will be interrupted and/or the 
protocol and/or consent document will be amended accordingly.
7.4.1 Principal Investigator/Research Team 
The clinical research team consisting of the PI, LAI, research nurse and data manager will meet 
on a weekly basis when patients are being actively treated on the trial to discuss each patient, 
data acquisition, approve CRFs for data entry and address any other logistical issues pertinent to 
the integrity of the protocol implementation and data management.
All data will be collected in a timely manner and reviewed by [CONTACT_94108][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a lead 
associate investigator. Events meeting requirements for expedited reporting as described in

(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product (ICH E6 (R2)).
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:
•Death,
•A life-threatening adverse event (see Section 8.1.3)
•Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_62487]/admission that is pre-planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery 
arranged prior to the start of the study), a planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912]-existing 
condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760], without a serious deterioration in 
health, is not considered a serious adverse event.

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.
8.1.3 Life-threatening 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "life-threatening" if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death. (21CFR312.32)

soon as possible, in accordance to 21 CFR Part 312.32. 
8.5 SPONSOR PROTOCOL DEVIATION REPORTING
A Protocol Deviation is defined as any non-compliance with the clinical trial Protocol, Manual 
of Operational Procedures (MOP) and other Sponsor approved study related documents, GCP, or 
protocol-specific procedural requirements on the part of the participant, the Investigator, or the 
study site staff inclusive of site personnel performing procedures or providing services in support 
of the clinical trial.
It is the responsibility of the study Staff to document any protocol deviation identified by [CONTACT_83943] (PDTS) online 
application. The entries into the PDTS online application should be timely, complete, and 
maintained per CCR PDTS user requirements. 
In addition, any deviation to the protocol should be documented in the participant’s source 
records and reported to the reviewing IRB per their guidelines. OSRO required protocol

Compliance with Protocol; 5.18.3 (a), and 5.20 Noncompliance; and ICH E3 16.2.2 Protocol 
deviations.
9 CLINICAL MONITORING 
As a sponsor for clinical trials, FDA regulations require the CCR to maintain a monitoring 
program. The CCR’s program allows for confirmation of: study data, specifically data that could 
affect the interpretation of primary and secondary study endpoints; adherence to the protocol, 
regulations, ICH E6, and SOPs; and human subjects protection. This is done through 
independent verification of study data with source documentation focusing on:
•Informed consent process
•Eligibility confirmation
•Drug administration and accountability
•Adverse events monitoring
•Response assessment.
The monitoring program also extends to multi-site research when the CCR is the coordinating 
center.
This trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_62561] a CCR contractor. Monitors are qualified 
by [CONTACT_12293]. Personnel monitoring this 
study will not be affiliated in any way with the trial conduct.

population is unlikely in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_638511].
10.2 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The primary objective of this randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_638512].  An 
important secondary objective is to preliminarily validate and explore the utility of the response 
measurement instruments.
Patients with oral cGVHD meeting the eligibility criteria will be separately randomized to either 
1 month of clobetasol 0.05% oral rinse or placebo; there will not be separate accrual goals for 
each age group or type of underlying disease. The patients will be followed every 2 weeks for 1 
month for their primary endpoint, and once 1 month after completion of study agents.
Abbreviated Title: Clobetasol rinse for oral cGVHD
Version Date: 3/25/2025
33The primary endpoint will be the change in OMRS score (Appendix A ) after 1 month of 
clobetasol 0.05% oral rinse compared to baseline. We will consider a 25% or larger decrease in 
the score to be clinically significant and a ‘response’ for the purpose of this study.  As this is a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the association between this level of change and other scales will also be assessed to 
determine if this is a meaningful measure to use in future trials or if modification is warranted. 
Thus, this study will be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_638513] a meaningful response as well for 
determining if the agent tested may be beneficial.
After the first 2 weeks of clobetasol treatment, patients can be removed from study if oral disease 
progression is documented. Patients who are taken off study for oral disease progression will be 
counted as non-responders at the time of the final analysis.  Patients taken off study for non-
compliance, specifically >75% non-use of the oral rinse, will not be included in the data analysis
The patients enrolled on this study may be a very heterogeneous group with respect to prior 
treatments, extent of disease, etc. Patients taken off study for reasons unrelated to the primary 
outcome will be classified as non-responders and analyzed accordingly. The results will be 
interpreted in the context of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_638514].
This study will aim to enroll a total of 34 evaluable patients randomized in a 1:1 fashion (17 per 
arm) to receive clobetasol rinse or placebo.  The initial phase of the study will involve two weeks 
of either clobetasol rinse or placebo. At the end of the initial 2 weeks, patients receiving placebo 
will receive 28 days of clobetasol while those receiving clobetasol initially will receive an 
additional 14 days of clobetasol. Thus, each group will receive 28 days of clobetasol following 
either a 14 day placebo or immediately after randomization.
Patients will be randomized with a single stratification factor to try to ensure a balanced 
distribution among those getting placebo or not initially: being identified as having a high 
intensity of immunosuppression (2 or more agents/modalities ± prednisone≥0.5  mg/kg/day) vs. 
no or a lesser intensity of systemic immunosuppression according to the Intensity of 
Immunosuppression Scale 10.  This scale was developed using expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], and has been 
preliminarily demonstrated to have predictive validity as measure of the intensity of systemic 
immunosuppression10,40.  A low intensity regimen is defined as treatment with prednisone alone 
at a dose of less than 0.5 mg per kilogram per day.  Moderately intense regimens include single 
agent prednisone at a dose greater than or equal to 0.5 mg per kilogram per day, and/or any other 
single agent or modality.  Regimens comprised of two or more agents or modalities (+/- 
prednisone greater than or equal to 0.5 mg per kilogram per day), are categorized as highly 
intensive systemic immunosuppression. When scoring the intensity of systemic 
immunosuppression, the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_638515]. 
The primary endpoint is the fraction of subjects who experience a 25% improvement in their 
OMRS compared to their own baseline. The fraction will be estimated with a two-tailed 95% 
confidence interval as the primary outcome. This will be done using all [ADDRESS_853924] will be performed assess their comparability. This will be determined conservatively, 
by [CONTACT_638547] (day 0 for 
initial clobetasol and day 14 for those initially given placebo) vs. the value after day [ADDRESS_853925]. If the p-value for that comparison is >0.30, then the two groups 
will be considered sufficiently similar to allow pooling of the results and to report a combined 
Abbreviated Title: Clobetasol rinse for oral cGVHD
Version Date: 3/25/[ADDRESS_853926] a ‘response’ to 28 days of clobetasol. In this case 34 patients will 
be sufficient to allow the proportion of patients with a response of 75% or more to have a two-
sided 95% confidence interval of +/- 15% or less, which will be considered sufficiently precise. 
Fractions of responses <75% would have slightly wider confidence interval widths.
An important secondary endpoint is to compare the changes from day [ADDRESS_853927] to the fraction with a response by 2 weeks, as well as 
comparing the actual changes in OMRS from day 0 to day 14.
By [CONTACT_79323] 17 patients per arm, a 0.10 alpha level one-tailed Fisher’s exact test will have 80% 
power to detect a difference between a potential 75% of patients having a 25% or greater 
decrease in severity score on the clobetasol arm and about half that amount, 35%, on the placebo 
arm. A one-tailed test is sufficient for this secondary objective in this study since we will not 
expect clobetasol to be associated with a lower fraction of patients with benefit compared to 
placebo and because this is intended to be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_638516] a potential trend of 
magnitudes anticipated, but not necessarily a statistically significant gain, may be detected. 
Should very promising results be obtained, then a subsequent trial could be conducted to build 
upon and further confirm the benefit noted. 
A comparison of the actual levels of changes in the oral severity score between the arms will also 
be done using a Wilcoxon rank sum test as a secondary analysis. With 17 patients per arm, there 
is approximately 80% power to detect a difference between the arms in the changes from 
baseline to day [ADDRESS_853928] deviation of the change (effect size=1.0), using a two-
tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test with a 0.[ADDRESS_853929] if the differences are not normally distributed 
(p<0.[ADDRESS_853930]). These results will be evaluated separately according to the 
randomized treatment arm as well as overall if the changes in score according to the randomized 
assignments are similar (p>0.[ADDRESS_853931] comparing changes in scores 
between the two arms over the one month clobetasol period). Although this would also be 
considered a secondary evaluation, there would be 82% power to identify a 0.[ADDRESS_853932] 93% power to detect a change with an effect size of 1.0, with a very 
conservative two-tailed 0.01 significance level, to account for multiple comparisons. Fewer than 
20 patients with paired biopsies would reduce the power accordingly, but since this is a 
secondary objective, the results of these tests will be presented in the context of an exploratory 
study.

of patients in this study will be adults over 18.
Recruitment: Subjects will be primarily recruited from NIH Clinical Center hematopoietic stem 
cell transplant clinics but could be referred from the outside institutions.
11.2 PARTICIPATION OF C HILDREN
This study will be limited to subjects aged 12 or older. Given the preliminary nature of the study 
and requirement for precise compliance with the instructions to minimize swallowing and 
systemic absorption of clobetasol, children < [ADDRESS_853934] benefit from 
research participation (Section 11.5), all subjects ≥ age 18 will be offered the opportunity to fill 
in their wishes for research and care, and assign a substitute decision maker on the “NIH 
Advance Directive for Health Care and Medical Research Participation” form so that another 
person can make decisions about their medical care in the event that they become incapacitated 
or cognitively impaired during the course of the study. Note: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_110645].  For those subjects that become 
incapacitated and do not have pre-determined substitute decision maker, the procedures 
described in MEC Policy 87-4 for appointing a surrogate decision maker for adult subjects who 
are (a) decisionally impaired, and (b) who do not have a legal guardian or durable power of 
attorney, will be followed.
11.4 EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS
11.4.1 Related to Clobetasol
The side-effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_638517] (yeast) infection. This is 
relatively uncommon in our patient population (<5%), easily treatable and does not require 
discontinuation of the treatment. Low levels of topi[INVESTIGATOR_638518], but the exact rate is not known.  While adrenal suppression is very rare with topi[INVESTIGATOR_638519], it is physiologically possible. Cases of adrenal suppression following 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_897]-applied steroid creams have been reported with long-term use on extensive body 
surface primarily in young children. In other reports, it was difficult to determine if there was 
adrenal suppression. Symptoms of adrenal suppression are non-specific and include fatigue,

visits.
11.4.2 Related to Blood Collection
Minor complications including bleeding, pain, and hematoma formation at the site of blood 
draws or infections may rarely occur.
11.4.3 Related to Tissue Biopsy
Oral mucosal punch biopsy is a minor surgical procedure that may be associated with temporary 
bleeding, hematoma at the site, local infection and postoperative discomfort. These risks are 
small (generally <5%) and transient.

diagnostic procedures (oral mucosal biopsy, plasma collection). Subjects may receive direct 
health benefits from participation in this protocol due to additional clinical monitoring such as 
thorough oral examination for oral GVHD. In addition, subjects on the active medication arm 
may receive direct benefit from treatment of oral GVHD. 
This companion protocol to the primary transplant protocol requires the collection of an 
additional blood sample for research purposes only. Samples will be collected during sample 
collection procedures that are part of their routine standard therapy.
Therefore this study meets the DHHS Regulations 45 CFR § 46. criteria for “more than minimal 
risk to subjects with prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects”.
Abbreviated Title: Clobetasol rinse for oral cGVHD
Version Date: 3/25/2025
3711.5.2 For Pediatric Subjects
This study meets the DHHS Regulations as follows:
“The risk represents a minor increase over minimal risk”. The risks of participating in this trial 
are limited to side-effects of clobetasol and the risks of standard diagnostic procedures (oral 
mucosal biopsy, plasma collection). Post-transplant patients require monitoring for post 
procedure complications.  Although this represents a minor increase over minimal risk, said 
monitoring is medically indicated.  This companion protocol to the primary transplant protocol 
requires the collection of additional blood samples for research purposes only.  Oral biopsy is 
optional for the pediatric patients and will be performed only for clinical indications to rule out 
alternative diagnoses at enrollment and part of the tissue will be saved for research purposes. 
“The intervention or procedure presents experiences to subjects that are reasonably 
commensurate with those inherent in their actual or expected medical, dental, psychological, 
social, or educational situations.”  Post-transplant patients who enroll in this protocol are 
familiar with blood collection and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_638521]-transplant complications. The monitoring 
that will be done is in line with the monitoring that would be done post-transplant.
“The intervention or procedure is likely to yield generalizable knowledge about the subjects’ 
disorder or condition which is of vital importance for the understanding or amelioration of 
the subjects’ disorder or condition.”  The generalizable knowledge would include the 
collection of information about the features of their post-transplant complication and the 
possible discovery of an effective treatment of oral GVHD for pediatric patients in the future. 
Subjects may receive direct health benefits from participation in this protocol due to 
additional clinical monitoring such as thorough oral examination for oral GVHD. In addition, 
subjects on the active medication arm may receive direct benefit from prevention of oral 
GVHD.
“Adequate provisions are made for soliciting assent of the children and permission of the 
parent or guardian, as set forth in § 46.408.”  Only adult patients or pediatric patients via 
their guardians who satisfy the previously described inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
understand and have given informed consent and assent may enroll in the protocol.  Some of 
the participants in this protocol will be children (less than 18 years of age).  In these cases, 
full and informed consent must be obtained from the parent or the legal guardian and an 
assent obtained from the child.  If the child does not wish to participate in the study, then 
enrollment of the child into the study is prohibited.  Importantly, any subject who enrolls in 
the protocol has the option of withdrawing from the protocol at any time.
Therefore, the protocol meets 45 CFR § 46.406 criteria for “a minor increase over minimal risk 
to subjects with prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects”.
11.6 CONSENT AND ASSENT P ROCESS AND D OCUMENTATION
The investigational nature and research objectives of this trial, the procedure and its attendant 
risks and discomforts will be carefully explained to the patient or the patient’s parents or 
guardian if he/she is a child, and a signed informed consent document will be obtained prior to 
entry onto the study.  The potential subject will be educated regarding the nature of the 
condition, proposed intervention, and outcome measures. Study subjects will be informed that 
participation is entirely voluntary and that withdrawal from the study can be made at any time

Where deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_83953]’s parent(s) or guardian, the child will 
also be included in all discussions about the trial and age-appropriate language will be used to 
describe the procedures and tests involved in this study, along with the risks, discomforts and 
benefits of participation.  Written assent will not be obtained from children as the study holds out 
the prospect of direct benefit that is important to the health and well-being of the child and is 
available only in the context of the research. Verbal assent will be obtained as appropriate for 
children ages 12-[ADDRESS_853939] that the child has given assent.  The consent/assent process will be 
documented in the child’s medical record, including the assessment of the child’s ability to 
provide assent (verbal versus written) as applicable. All children will be contact[CONTACT_638549] [ADDRESS_853940] sign consent. If only one

11.6.1 Telephone re-consent procedure
Re-consent on this study may be obtained via telephone according to the following procedure: 
the informed consent document will be sent to the subject.  An explanation of the study will be 
provided over the telephone after the subject has had the opportunity to read the consent form.  
The subject will sign and date the informed consent. A witness to the subject’s signature [CONTACT_110730].  The original informed consent document will be sent back to the 
consenting investigator who will sign and date the consent form with the date the consent was

If there is an unexpected enrollment of a research participant for whom there is no translated 
extant IRB approved consent document, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or those authorized to 
obtain informed consent will use the Short Form Oral Consent Process as described in MAS 
Policy M77-2, OSHRP SOP 12, and 45 CFR 46.117 (b) (2).  The summary that will be used is 
the English version of the extant IRB approved consent document.  Signed copi[INVESTIGATOR_638522].
Unless the PI [INVESTIGATOR_74842]’s language, an interpreter will be present to 
facilitate the conversation (using either the long translated form or the short form). Preferably 
someone who is independent of the subject (i.e., not a family member) will assist in presenting 
information and obtaining consent. Whenever possible, interpreters will be provided copi[INVESTIGATOR_338726] (24 to 48 
hours if possible). 
We request prospective IRB approval of the use of the short form process and will notify the IRB 
at the time of continuing review of the frequency of the use of the Short Form.

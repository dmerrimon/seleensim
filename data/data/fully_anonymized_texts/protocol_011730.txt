 I. HYPOTHESES AND SPECIFIC AIMS/PURPOSE  
 
A. Statement of Purpose  
 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety , dose -requirements , and exploratory 
efficacy  of twice -daily subcutaneous enoxaparin as in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678374] 
(VTE) prophylaxis in children (birth to 18 years) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678375]/or symptoms 
of SARS -CoV-2 infecti on (i.e., COVID -19) including COVID -19 multisystem inflammatory 
syndrome (CMIS)  
 
B. Principal Aims and Hypotheses  
 
Specific Aim 1:  To investigate the safety of in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678376] -
daily low -dose enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis (starting dose, 0.5 m/gkg subcutaneously 
q12 hours, adjusted to achieve a [ADDRESS_918009] -dose anti -factor Xa level of 0.20 -0.49 anti -
Xa U/mL) in children hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -19 related -illnesses , as measured by [CONTACT_678416] -defined [10] clinically -relevant bleeding (primary endpoint).  
 
Hypothesis 1:  The observed cumulative incidence of ISTH -defined clinically -
relevant bl eeding is ≤2.6% (upper limit of 90% confidence interval: ≤11.8%) among 
children with COVID -19 who receive in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678376] -
daily low -dose enoxaparin.   
 
Specific Aim 2:  To determine the median twice -daily enoxaparin dose, as measur ed in 
mg/kg, required to achieve a [ADDRESS_918010] -dose anti -factor Xa level of 0.20 -0.49 anti -Xa 
U/mL in children hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -19 related -illnesses , and to compare dose -
requirements by [CONTACT_551] (birth to  <1 year old, 1 -<6 years old, 6 -<13 years ol d, and 13-
<18 years old).  
 
Hypothesis 2:  Median dose -requirement for anti -Xa-targeted thromboprophylaxis 
with twice -daily enoxaparin, as measured in mg/kg, in children hospi[INVESTIGATOR_121058] -19 are associated with age, with younger age groups requiring h igher 
doses.  
 
Specific Aim 3 (Exploratory):  To investigate, on an exploratory  basis, the efficacy of in -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678376] -daily enoxaparin in children hospi[INVESTIGATOR_121058] -19, as measured by [CONTACT_678417] D -dimer levels obtained at 
standardized time points that are <2 times the upper limit of norm al (<2x ULN) values for 
age (Aim 3a; surrogate marker of efficacy), the cumulative incidence of radiologically -
confirmed HA -VTE (Aim 3b; clinical efficacy), and the median duration of in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678377] (new requirement for high -flow nasal cannula, non -invasive 
ventilation, and/or mechanical ventilation, relative to any at -home baseline requirement ; 
Aims 3c, clinical efficacy ).

 II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
VTE is a serious condition in children associated with significant morbidity . Adverse VTE 
outcomes include VTE -related mortality, recurrent VTE , and development of chronic 
venous insufficiency following deep venous thrombosis (post -thrombotic syndrome). 
Given these adverse outcomes, as well as recent recognition of VTE as the seco nd 
leading cause of preventable harm in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65304] (after central line associated 
blood stream infections; CLABSI ) [1], a national patient safety initiative in the U.S., 
supported by [CONTACT_2005]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] s Association  Solutions for Patient Safety network , 
has been undertaken to reduce the incidence of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ‐associated VTE (HA ‐VTE) in 
children. While pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with various anticoagulants 
(including low molecular weight heparins and the direct oral anticoagulants) has been 
shown to be safe and effective in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119800], both safety and efficacy among 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678378].  
 
In order to optimize benefit ‐risk ratio for target populations in future trials of anticoagulant 
thromboprophylaxis in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65304], the PI [INVESTIGATOR_678379]-VTE in several important hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678380], including non -
critically ill children, critically -ill children without underlying cardiac disease, and critically -
ill children following cardiac surgery or cardiac catheter -based therapeutic i ntervention 
[2–5]. These models share common features of central venous catheterization, severe 
infection or systemic inflammatory state, and anticipated length of stay (LOS) >3 days as 
statistically -significant, independent risk factors for HA -VTE in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65304]. In 
the absence of efficacy and safety data from pediatric trials, clinicians across the U.S., 
Canada, Europe and many other countries/regions have, in recent years, used l ow-dose 
low molecular weight heparins (LMWH; most often, enoxaparin) as primary 
thromboprophylaxis in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678381]/or other high -risk 
features for the development of in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678382].    
 
A novel coronavirus, SARS -CoV-2, is re sponsible for a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_678383] 160 countries, causing infection in over 500,000 individuals, and 25,000 
deaths, as of April 1, 2020. The SARS -CoV-2 illness, known as COVID -19, exhibits a 
range of disease severity, from asymptom atic infection to respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], multi -organ 
failure, and death. Among hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], COVID -19 is characterized by [CONTACT_32593][INVESTIGATOR_678384] a severe inflammatory response with which marked coagulation 
activation, as evidenced by [CONTACT_678418] D -dimer levels. A recent 
retrospective analysis from China demonstrated reduced mortality and reduced LOS 
among hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643] (primarily adults) with COVID -19 and markedly -elevated D -
dimers who received anticoagulation (pred ominantly, LMWH) [6]. Accordingly, the 
International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) has recently recommended 
prophylactic a nticoagulation be strongly considered in patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191544] -
19 [7]. Similarly, the American Society of Hematology has recommended that “all patients 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678385] -19 should receive pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis” and 
recommend participation in “well -designed clinical trials and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_678386].” [ 8] Children with COVID -[ADDRESS_918011] also presented with 
Version 03/08 /2021   Page 5 of 27 
 CMIS, a Kawasaki -disease -like illness, presenting with severe systemic inflammatory 
disease affecting multiple systems beyond the respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133].  [9]  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678387] -CoV-[ADDRESS_918012] increase d across many 
children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678388] U.S.  with nearly 1% of the infected pediatric population 
anticipated to develop acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] [10]. Many children 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -19 are exhibiting markedly elevated D -dimer levels [11] much 
as has been observed in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119800], and it is expected that these children will 
similarly exhibit a heightened VTE risk. Based on this urgent and time -sensitive clinical 
need, and given that anticoagulant prophylaxis against HA -VTE in children is used 
selectively in routine care at children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138019] U.S. but is not yet supported 
by [CONTACT_678419], the objective of this proposal is to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_678389] a phase 2 multicenter trial of low -dose enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis in children 
newly -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -19. The study proposed herein will  leverage an existing  
network and clinical coordinating center (CCC)  infrastructure of the NIH  NHLBI U01 
Prospective Multi -Center Evaluation of the Duration of Therapy for Thrombosis in 
Children  (Kids -DOTT).  
 
This proposal is significant in that it addresses a critical  need for establishing safety of 
prophylactic anticoagulation in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678390] -
VTE. Furthermore, this proposal is innovative, in that it seeks to establis h first multicenter 
evidence on safety of prophylactic anticoagulation for the prevention of HA -VTE in 
children, with a focus on the especially -heightened VTE risk population of pediatric 
patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -[ADDRESS_918013] 
(i.e., VTE in children) and employs the same therapeutic agents (i.e., conventional 
anticoagulants, which have consisted of the LMWH enoxaparin in >95% of patients ). 
 
III. PRELIMINARY STUDIES/PROGRESS REPORT:  
 
Based on a PubMed sea rch on 1 3April2020, no prior studies of safety , dose -requirement, 
and/or efficacy of twice -daily enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65304] , with 
or without COVID -19, have been published. Based on clinicaltrials.gov and 
eudract .ema.europa.eu  search on [ADDRESS_918014] in Europe .

 IV. RESEARCH METHODS: SUMMARY OF STUDY 
RATIONALE  
 
A. Primary Outcome  
 
PRIMARY SAFETY:  Occurrence of clinically -relevant (i.e., major plus clinically relevant 
non-major [CRNM]) bleeding within 30 days.  
 
Based upon International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Scientific and 
Standardization Committee standardized definitions for pediatric trials  [12], “Major 
bleeding” will be characterized by [CONTACT_678420] f ollowing criteria:  
1) fatal; 2) clinically overt and associat ed with a decrease in hemoglobin of at least 2 g/dL 
in a 24 hour period; 3) clinically overt and for which  blood product is administered;  
4) retroperitoneal, pulmonary, or involving the central nervous system; 5) requiring 
surgical intervention in an operating suite.  
 
“CRNM bleeding” definition includes any bleeding that does not fulfill the above criteria 
but fulfills one of the following: 1) Bleeding requiring medical or surgical intervention to 
restore hemostasis; 2) Bleeding for which medical atten tion is sought.  
 
B. Secondary Outcome(s)  
 
DOSE REQUIREMENT:  Median twice -daily enoxaparin dose, as measured in mg/kg, 
required to achieve a [ADDRESS_918015] -dose anti -factor Xa level of 0.20 -0.49 anti -Xa U/mL.  
 
EXPLORATORY  EFFICACY: Proportion of plasma D -dimer le vels <2x ULN; cumulative 
incidence of VTE; and duration of assisted ventilation.  
 
C. Endpoint Adjudication  
The p rimary safety outcome  (clinically -relevant bleeding) and exploratory clinical efficacy  
outcome  of recurrent VTE , as well as all death events, will be centrally adjudicated via an 
independent  Clinical Endpoint Adjudication Committee (CEAC), using a standardized 
process delineated in the CEAC charter. Upon reporting of these outcome events, de -
identified information on  pertinent history , physical exam findings , imaging studies, 
laboratory studies, and other pertinent information from the medical record  corresponding 
to these  outcome events (clinically -relevant bleeds) will be submitted by [CONTACT_678421].  
D. Summary of Research Methods and Study Design  
 
The study design is a phase 2, single -arm, open -label, non -randomized clinical trial 
conducted among the Kids -DOTT Investigators Group, at [ADDRESS_918016] of participating Kids -DOTT centers (including primary and 
alternate/supplemental sites) is shown in Appendix  1. Study activity at each site will be

as the site principal investigator, in close collaboration with sub-investigators from the 
other two aforementioned specialties.   
 
The Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC)  and Data Coordinating Center (DCC)  for this non -
blinded, non -randomized phase 2 trial are  at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(JHACH; St. Petersburg, FL) , led by [CONTACT_678422]  (Appendix 2. CC C). Coordinating center personnel have extensive 
experience in the conduct of numerous large collaborative clinical trials, with specific 
expertise in  pediatric phase 1 -3 trials. CCC and DCC key personnel include:

Anticoagulant (low-dose enoxaparin) thromboprophylaxis dosing regimen is as follows  for 
inpatient use only : 
 
• Enoxaparin starting dose 0.5 mg /kg (max starting dose: 60 mg) subcutaneously 
q12 hours, adjusted to achieve a [ADDRESS_918018] -dose anti -factor Xa level of 0.20 -0.49 
anti-Xa U/ mL after the 1st or 2nd dose.  
 
o For anti -Xa values <0.20  U/mL , the enoxaparin dose will be increased by 
10-20%, and a [ADDRESS_918019] 
or 2nd dose at the new dosing regimen.  
 
o For anti -Xa values ≥0.5 U/mL, the enoxaparin dose will be decreased by 
10-20%, and a [ADDRESS_918020] 
or 2nd dose at the new dosing regimen.  
 
The Schedule of Assessments is shown in Table 1. SAE monitoring and safety laboratory 
monitoring occurs on days 1 -3, and on days 7 and 14 if the patient is still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. 
For all participants, pertinent clinical data will be captured as follows: resul ts of 
coagulation and thrombophilia testing; nature of any major or clinically -relevant non -major  
bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (as defined in Section IV B, above) during the anticoagulant therapy 
period (with detail as to amount of any related blood transfusion and/o r any other 
intervention  required —see also Data and Safety Monitoring Plan section); and nature of 
any new onset VTE (with detail as to signs/symptoms  and anatomic site). PDFs of the 
REDCap electronic  case report forms ( eCRFs) , as well as  SAE report forms , are provided 
in the  Manual of Operations.  All SAEs  and enoxaparin regimen adherence will be tracked

enrollment.  
 
Children will complete their participation in the trial  at the 30 days (+/ - 2 days) post -
enrollment end -of-study telephone visit.  As noted previously, the primary safety endpoint 
collection also occurs at the 30 days (+/ - 2 days).  
 
E. Description of Population to be Enrolled  
 
1. Target Enrollment  
The target accrual is based on the primary endpoint (safety). The s afety population is 
defined as all patients who received at least one dose of the enoxaparin regimen . In order 
to achieve adequate power and precision for determination of safety in the pri mary 
analysis (see also section G, below), the target enrollment is [ADDRESS_918022] one 
dose of the enoxaparin regimen (i.e. early termination, withdrawal of consent) will be 
replaced.  Anticipating an 85% retention rate, we will enroll up to 45 participants. Both 
males and females of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this study.

F. Description and Justification of Procedures, Measures, and 
Data Collection Tools:  
There will be minimal laboratory assays, examinations, or other procedures performed 
solely for the purposes of this study and not currently part of best/standard clinical care.   
The first is an additional  11 mL blood specimen (7mL in participants <20kg) obtained at 
visits on post -enrollment days 1 and 2 (and days 3, 7, and 14 if still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) for 
protocol -specified research laboratory investigations (D-dimer, IL -6, anti -SARS -CoV-2 
IgG/IgM, and CloFAL assay) and future unspecified research (i.e., banking of plasma , 
DNA isolated from the buffy coat,  and isolated PBMCs ). These biospecimens will be 
stored in the Johns Hopkins All Children’s Pediatric Biorepository at the Clinical 
Coordinating Center. All biospecimen storage tubes are pre -labeled with a u nique 2D 
Version 03/08 /2021   Page 12 of 27 
 barcode, with the association between the barcode and the participant’s unique study ID 
maintained in the Biorepository’s secure, web -based, password -protected Lab 
Information Management System (LIMS) maintained behind the information technology 
firewall at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Biospecimens will be used to identify 
and validate putative prognostic biomarkers in pediatric venous thrombosis and COVID -
19-related illness. The genetic investigations will involve candidate gene s, a geno me-
wide association study ( GWAS), and whole genome sequencing approaches in 
deoxyribonucleic acid. The Johns Hopkins All Children’s Pediatric Biorepository uses a 
secure database to store all data related to the samples, behind the institutional firewall. 
Following completion of the protocol -specified aims, external requests for specimens in 
the COVAC -TP trial biobank will be vetted and made available through the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH), in accordance with NIH policies on data and biospecimen 
sharing. The second procedure will be obtaining a contrast enhanced computed 
tomography scan of the chest  within 24 hours preceding discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (if 
not already obtained clinically during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  to assess for pulmonary emboli.  
Throughout their study participation, up to and including visit 6, patients will be assessed 
for bleeding and VTE events  by [CONTACT_678425] (supported by [CONTACT_678426]’s 
electronic medical record)  and reported to the  Medical Safety Officer  (MSO)   as described 
in Section J.2.   The MSO will perform an independent determination of each SAE that 
has been locally determined by [CONTACT_678427], regarding re latedness to study 
intervention. If EITHER determination is that the SAE is “related”, the SAE will be reported 
to the DSMB chair. The DSMB will then assess whether any action is needed, depending 
on the nature of the SAE. Adverse events (and symptoms of c oncern for possible VTE or 
clinically -relevant bleeding)  will be further assessed at a long -term follow up visit 30 days 
(+/- days) after enrollment via telephone call from a study team member.

Off-Study Criteria:  
1. In the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it is in the participant’s best interest to discontinue 
participation.  
2. Study discontinuation by [CONTACT_3211], IRB, or other regulatory body.  
3. Lost to follow -up: Participants will not be deemed lost to follow -up until they have 
had no successful contact [CONTACT_678429] [ADDRESS_918029] the participant.  
G. Potential Scientific Problems:  
Although this study involves relatively minimal intervention  relative to standard care for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678393] , the main potential 
problems and challenges involve maintaining adequate personal protection from the 
exposure and transmission of SARS -CoV-2 (the cause of COVID -19 disease) .  
Accordingly, a ll interactions with participants will take place as part of each site’s standard 
of care for patients with COVID -19.  Clinical assessments and the procurement of biologic 
specimens will be obtained concurrent with routine clinical procedures so to limit t he 
consumption of limited personal protective equipment.  In order to reduce exposure of 
study personnel to patients positive for SARS -CoV-2 and reduce the consumption of PPE, 
informed consent will be obtained in accordance with FDA regulations (21 CFR 50. 27(a)) 
that allow each site to obtain informed consent if the appropriate technology is available 
or utilizing the following steps:  
1) An unsigned consent form will be provided to the parent/legal guardian by a 
health care worker that has already entered the patient’s room  
2) In the event direct communication with the parent/legal guardian and patient is 
not feasible or safe, the investigator (or designee) will arrange a three -way call 
or video conference with the parent/legal/guardian and impartial witness  
Version 03/08 /2021   Page 15 of 27 
 3) Each site will utilize a standard practice to ensure all patients approached in a 
consistent fashion including:  
a) Identification of who is on the call  
b) Review of the informed consent with the parent/legal guardian and 
response to any questions they may have  
c) Confir mation by [CONTACT_362827]’s questions have been 
answered  
d) Confirmation by [CONTACT_678430]/legal guardian is 
consenting for the patient to participate in the study  
If the informed consent document is obtained in person and cannot be removed from the 
patient’s room and included in the study records due to infection control processes, the 
following measures will be considered compliant with FDA regulations for informed 
consent:  
1) Attestations by [CONTACT_678431] ; OR 
2) A photograph of the informed consent document with attestation by [CONTACT_678432] a photograph of the informed  consent signed by [CONTACT_4677].  
Other challenges stem from the multi -center nature of the study, including uniformity of 
data collection and anticoagulant management, and timely data entry into the EDC 
system. These challenges are overcome via the CCC and DCC structure and close 
oversight of the trial, the use of EDC system with standardized eCRFs, and the agreement 
of all participating centers to follow the protocol -defined enoxaparin  thromboprophylaxis 
regimen, as being consistent with their local standard practice . These potential challenges 
did not materialize as substantive issues  in the Kids -DOTT phase 3 multicenter trial 
conducted by [CONTACT_678433].  
H. Data Analysis Pla n: 
 
The statistical analysis plan was developed by [CONTACT_678434]. Subject 
demographics and characteristics at study entry will be summarized with counts and 
percentages for categorical variables, and with means, standard deviations, median s, and 
interquartile ranges (IQR) as appropriate, for numeric variables. Missing data will not be 
imputed. Analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted on the safety population, 
which includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of enoxaparin.  The primary 
endpoint, cumulative incidence of ISTH -defined [ 11] clinically -relevant bleeding events 
during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], will be calculated with the corresponding exact (Clopper -Pearson) 
90% confidence intervals (90%CIs). The precision of estimates for different cumulative 
incidences of clinically -relevant bleeds and corresponding 90% Cis are as follows: 0/38, 
0% (0 -7.6)%; 1/38, 2.6% (0 -11.8%); 2/38, 5.3% (0 -15.7%). The secondary endpoint, 
twice -daily enoxaparin dose required to achieve target anti -Xa levels, will be summarized 
Version 03/08 /[ADDRESS_918030], if 
needed. The tertiary endpoints (as outlined in Section IV.B)  will be calculated as 
proportions and cumulative incidences with 90%CIs, and medians with IQRs . 
 
I. Data Management and Security  
At the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) level, data management and security are 
facilitated via a JHACH -hosted, web -based, secure, user -restricted, password -protected, 
Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system, REDCap . When combined with the Standard 
Operating Procedures of the COVAC -TP trial DCC at JHACH (sponsoring institution) , 
REDCap fosters  21CFR part 11 adherence . Electronic case report form (eCRF) additions, 
modification of programmed data quality assurance alerts, and programming of reports 
within the EDC system is overseen by [CONTACT_15791]. Data ex port and transfers to the JHACH -
based lead biostatistician at the DCC are executed via a secure, user -restricted, 
password -protected server that resides behind the firewall at the Johns Hopkins 
University School of Medicine .  
At the participating site level, the EDC system is used by [CONTACT_184257] (PIs) and 
their designees for participant enrollment, and data collection, and query resolution. Data 
collection in the EDC system includes protected health information (PHI ), limited to date 
of birth  and dates of events. In addition to using the EDC system, PIs at participating sites 
will maintain a local “ COVAC -TP participant key” as a password -protected file on a secure 
shared drive behind the institutional firewall. This key will consist of each participant’s 
unique study ID code (centrally generated, via the EDC system) along with his/her 
Medical Record Number at the local medical institution. Any hard copy records containing 
PHI – including the regulatory binder for the trial as well as individual participant study 
binders -- will be kept in a locked file cabinet under the local PI’s direct oversight.  
At the CCC level, administrative access to the COVAC -TP instance in the EDC system is 
granted to the CCC project managers  on a limited basis. Specifically, this user -restricted 
role is used for query generation, and has “view -only” access within the eCRFs.  
In addition, the Johns Hopkins All Children’s Pediatric Biorepository at the CCC, serving 
as the central biorepository for the trial, facilitates data management and security by 
[CONTACT_3553] a 21 CFR part-11-adherent web -based LIMs system (STARLIMS TM, Abbot 
Informatics), that affords password -protected, user -restricted access to Biorepository 
staff only, and consists of PHI -free data on specimen/derivative inventory and pre - 
analytical quality assurance.  
J. Data Safety and Monitoring Plan  
 
1. DSMP Summary  
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) consisting of a pediatric 
hematologist, a pediatric critical care or hospi [INVESTIGATOR_678394], and a PhD -level 
Version 03/08 /2021   Page 17 of 27 
 biostatistician will be established and supported via the Pediatric Data Coordinating 
Center at Johns Hopkins All Children’s. The DSMB will convene at least quarterly 
throughout the trial, including interim analyses for safety monitoring , to review confidential 
and de -identified data . Criteria for halting enrollment pending further evaluation by [CONTACT_678435] 2, below. At that time, the DMSB will consider a 
recommendation to terminate versus continue the  trial, based on evaluation of most up -
to-date literature on the rate of clinically -relevant bleeding among children hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198616] -19 outside of the trial.  
A Medical Safety Officer (MSO) will function for additional safety oversite for the Overa ll 
PI, and to facilitate timely sponsor -level SAE review and communication with the DSMB. 
The MSO will perform an independent determination of each SAE that has been locally 
determined by [CONTACT_678427], regarding relatedness to study intervention . If 
EITHER determination is that the SAE is “related”, the SAE will be reported to the 
DSMB chair. Reporting timelines are provided in the Manual of Operations  
2. Protocol Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_678395], 
the COVAC -TP independent DSMB will make recommendations to the Steering 
Committee and the NHLBI Office of the Director regarding termination vs. continuation of 
the phase 2 clinical trial  as noted in Tabl e 2. These recommendations by [CONTACT_678436][INVESTIGATOR_678396], as well as trial quality and enrollment metrics. In the case of 
persistently poor trial enrollment metr ics, the DSMB may recommend termination of the 
trial for futility, versus continuation of the trial with protocol modifications.  
Reasons for early termination are as follow:  
• Evidence of safety concerns —although stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_678397] 
a guide, this can occur at any point during the study, based on the  DSMB’s review 
of cumulative data to date at scheduled or ad hoc DSMB meetings.  
• Determination of futility: Evidence of persistently poor tr ial enrollment metrics, 
which cannot be (or has not been) remedied via protocol modification or other 
appropriate corrective action.

 3. SAE Reporting Plan  
SAEs will be collected from time of enrollment  to the end of the 30 day study window.  
Diseases or conditions that were present prior to the time of randomization should not be 
counted as adverse events unless they increase in grade or severity during the timeframe 
described above.  
Adverse event: Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
Serious adverse event: An adverse event is considered "serious" if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening adverse event  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93203] b e considered serious when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or participant and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events in clude allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
All SAEs will be reported with in 24 hours of knowledge of the event. Please refer to 
the M anual of Operations  for SAE reporting forms and guidelines.  
Bleeding Events:  
• Major bleeds and clinically -relevant non -major (CRNM) bleeds will be considered 
SAEs of particular interest (if they occur during the AE reporting window).  
• Based upon ISTH standardized definitions for pediatric trials [10], “Major bleeding” 
will be characterized by [CONTACT_678437]: 1) fatal; 
2) clinically overt and associated with a decrease in hemoglobin of at least 2 g/dL 
in a 24 hour period; 3) clinically overt and for which blood produc t is administered; 
4) retroperitoneal, pulmonary, or involving the central nervous system; 5) requiring 
surgical intervention in an operating suite.  
• “CRNM bleeding” definition includes any bleeding that does not fulfill the above 
criteria but fulfills one  of the following: 1) Bleeding requiring medical or surgical 
intervention to restore hemostasis, but not in an operating suite; 2) Bleeding for 
which medical attention is sought.  
Version 03/08 /2021   Page 19 of 27 
 VTE events  will be considered outcome events rather than SAEs, unless they o therwise 
fulfill the regulatory definition of an SAE (i.e., they will not fulfill the SAE criterion of 
investigator -defined “important medical events”).  
  
Version 03/08 /2021   Page 20 of 27 
 Adjudication of clinically -relevant bleeding, VTE,   and death:  
The primary  outcome  on safety in regard to clinically -relevant bleeding, the tertiary 
outcome on clinical efficacy in regard to VTE event s, and all death events will be centrally 
adjudicated via an independent, non-blinded Clinical Endpoint Adjudication Committee 
(CEAC)  for this non -blinded, non -randomized phase [ADDRESS_918031] (IRB) per local IRB policy.  
Major Protocol Deviations include, but are not limited to:  
1. Inappropriate enrollment; expi[INVESTIGATOR_678398]*, violation of eligibility criteria or 
incomplete consent  documentation  
2. Violation of any site specific IRB requirements (e.g. If sites IRB requires both 
parents to sign consent)  
3. Failure to report SAE in the 24 hour time period following knowledge of SAE*  
4. Failure to provide source documentation of a primary ef ficacy or safety outcome, 
as well as death event, for central adjudication by [CONTACT_678438] (CEAC).  
*items are identified as major protocol deviations, but do not disqualify participant’s data 
to be included in the per proto col analysis.  
Minor Protocol Deviations  
Minor Protocol Deviations are defined as deviations that do not impact patient safety or 
the final outcome measure of the trial, but do not follow study specified guidelines. All 
deviations that are not determined to be major deviations are to be recorded as minor 
deviations.  
Version 03/08 /2021   Page 21 of 27 
 Minor Protocol Deviations include, but are not limited to:  
1. Missed visits or visits outside study windows ( except Visits 4 -6 if not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678399] )  
2. Missed laboratory samples or radiographic imaging that are not related to patient 
eligibility or study outcome (includes research specimens)  
 
5. Unanticipated Problem Reporting Guidelines  
Unanticipated problems encountered or uncovered by a participating site PI [INVESTIGATOR_678400]. Unanticipated 
problems must also be reported to the IRB or as per IRB polic y.  
 
K. Human Subject Research Considerations  
 
1. Risks to Study Participants  
As discussed in the consent document, risks of bleeding in patients treated with 
anticoagulation are reduced by [CONTACT_678439]; nevertheless, the risk of major 
bleeding in patients given a standard therapeutic course of anticoagulation is 2%  [13].  
Retrospective analysis of the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) revealed a 
combined minor and major bleeding rate of 5.6% in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678401] [14]. Such major bleeding includes bleeding in the brain or 
retroperitoneum, bleeding associated with a s ignificant decline in hemoglobin in a 24 -hour 
period, and bleeding requiring surgical intervention to establish hemostasis. These types 
of major bleeding can be life threatening. Minor bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (those not described 
above, such as nosebleeds or ble eding from lacerations that do not require surgical 
intervention and do not result in a brisk drop in hemoglobin) are more frequently observed 
than major bleeding events. The rate of minor bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_678402] a dult studies  of VTE treatment (including standard -dose 
enoxaparin ), but may be as high as 20%  [13]. Minor bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_678403] 4% 
of [ADDRESS_918032] -line therapy for treatment 
dosing and  prophylaxis for VTE in pregnant women because it does not cross the 
placenta into fetal circulation  [15]. Therefore, exposure to enoxaparin does not pose risk 
to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103].  
2. Alternative Treatmen ts Considered  
An alternative to this research is to not participate and have the prophylaxis approaches 
against HA -VTE determined by [CONTACT_343091] , with consultation of a pediatric 
hematologist as deemed clinically appropriate.   
Version 03/08 /[ADDRESS_918033] to risks of anticoagulation, participants in whom clinically -relevant bleeding 
develops in-patient (on enoxaparin prophylactic regimen) will receive appropriate medical 
attention, and those in whom bleeding develops as an outpatient (off enoxaparin 
prophylaxis) will be instructed to seek medical attention , as part of routine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678404] , with re -enforcement by [CONTACT_3462] . However, it should be 
noted that this study involves standard prophylactic dosing of low-dose enoxaparin , and 
is therefore not anticipated to engender substantively greater bleeding risk than standard 
care, and is not expected to be associated with increased bleeding risk beyond [ADDRESS_918034] to participant 
confidentiality, participant identifiers will be highly limited (i.e., Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act [HIPAA] “limited data set”) in the database, and a unique study 
code will be used in l ieu of patient names. These data will be kept for as long as necessary 
to conduct this and any future research and to comply with legal obligations related to 
research. A copy of all consent forms, which will contain participant names, will be 
retained in a secure and locked file in the office of the local site principal investigator. A 
key will be securely stored separately at the local institution from all study documents that 
will link the participant name [CONTACT_678441]. The study will be conducted u nder the 
Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines.  
Non-English speaking families will be provided with an informed consent written in a 
language understandable to them and a translato r provided . To the extent permis sible by 
[CONTACT_17652], a short form (in the patient’s native language) may be used in lieu of a 
fully translated informed consent form.  
4. Special Consent/Assent Plan  
As this study specifically addresses the pediatric population, assent must be obtained as 
per IRB policy. A subset of children will be unable to provide assent as a result of age, 
maturity , or severity of illness . These children qualify for a waiver of assent. The 
remainder of children will have assent without a signature [CONTACT_678442] -[ADDRESS_918035] benefit in the form of a d ecreased ri sk for development of VTE ; however, no such 
benefit may be shown by [CONTACT_1758].  
 
6. Incentives or Rewards Offered for Participation  
There will be no compensation for participation in this study .  
Version 03/08 /2021   Page 23 of 27 
  
L. Summary of Knowledge to be Gained:  
The knowledge gained from t his study will advance our understanding of safety, dose -
finding and (on an exploratory basis) efficacy of twice -daily low -dose enoxaparin 
thromboprophylaxis in children hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -19, and more generally, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678405]. T he tertiary aim , investigating the 
effect of thromboprophylaxis on respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -related  outcomes and D -dimer , will contribute 
to the currently  limited  understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID -19 disease  in 
children .

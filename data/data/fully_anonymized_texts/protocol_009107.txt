Background Information  
 
A healthy mouth is a crucial condition for a healthy body.  
Maintaining good oral health requires good oral hygiene meaning  good plaque control.  Plaque 
is one of the main etiological fac tors in dental decay1 and the principal etiologic f actor for 
periodontal diseases 2 which, beyond the discomfort they can inherently cause, are linked to 
more systemic conditions such a s cardiovascular disease, pre -term low birthweight babies, 
Alzheimer’s dis ease, [ADDRESS_102725] greatly evolved, from pig bristles to connected sonic devices, 
dexterity is still the key component to an efficient cleaning routine. Regardless of the type of 
toothbrush, if it cannot be used properly, plaq ue cannot be removed p roperly. And it has been 
shown in recent research that on a population with a general good health, the plaque score 
reduction is only an average 42% (range 30 -53%) for manual to othbrushes 6 and 46% (range 
36-65%) for powered on es. 7 
Based on these observat ions, the sponsor has developed a powered teeth cleaning device to 
by[CONTACT_92934] a 
contraction and a relaxation, according to successive cycles in the presence of a liquid 
dentifrice, of a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_92927] a resil ient material receiving and enclosing all the teeth of 
an arch.

 Description of the Device  Studied  
 
Device Classification  
Device  is in class 1, 501K exempt according to the 21 CRF 872 section 6865.  
 
 
Mechanism of Action  
The automated brush  is a device aiming at improving and automating tooth brushing by [CONTACT_92935]’s dex terity variability. To this end, it is composed of a combination of an injection pump 
and a vacuum pump that allows for the injection and the evacuation of a cleaning liquid into a 
supple TPE bristled mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_92928] a time.  The border of the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], the 
oral vestibule and the cheek create an airtight environment inside the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], the suction of 
the liquid generate s successive depressions allowing plaque disruption by [CONTACT_92936][INVESTIGATOR_92929].

randomization table  will be used by [CONTACT_92938] a test or control brush.    
Product Use  
 
Subjects will be given  verbal brushing i nstructions for the test or control brush.  
For the control group, t he toothbrush bristles will be dampened with water and toothpaste , will be 
pre-dispensed (on a clean surface) by [CONTACT_92939].  The 
same toothpaste w ill be provided to all the subjects. The subject  will use the device directly over 
the sink.   
Subjects will be reminded of the brushing instructions and  will be timed during their brushing.  
For the test group, the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_92931] u nder the supervision of the study 
staff.   The subject  will use the device directly over the sink. If the subject is having any difficulty 
or uncomfortable, the in -mouth testing will be stopped immediately and reported to the Principal 
Investigator.   
Assessment of Safety and Adverse Event Reporting  
Definitions  
Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) are defined by [CONTACT_92940] (ICH GCP) as follows:  
 
Adverse Event:   Any unto ward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigations subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event 
 
 
 
 
12 
 (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and  unintended sign (including abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
 
AEs include any clinically significant deterioration of a subject’s medical status, after enrolled 
and signing an Informed Consent Form.  The AE may involve any organs or systems and can 
be represented by [CONTACT_92941] a disease, a syndrome, a symptom, a 
physical sign, as well as by [CONTACT_92942].  Any medically relevant and untoward change from baseline, including frequency or 
pattern changes for a fluctuating condition (e.g.,  migraine), occurring after  enrollment.  All such 
occurrences must be recorded and reported accordingly, whether they appear causally related 
to the study  product , or not.  
 
 
Serious Adverse Event : Any adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any 
of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life threatening adverse event  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not res ult in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to preve nt one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.  
 
   
 
Documenting and Reporting Adverse Events  
 
General Procedures for All Adverse Events  
All clinical complaints, symptoms, or signs that meet the adverse event definition will be 
recorded on the Adverse Reaction Form using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that 
accurately reflects the event.  Source documentation should be maintained that allows for clear 
identification of each adverse event and the following parameters required for the form:  
• AE description  
• Date of onset  
• Date of resolution  
• Outcome  
• Severity  
• Seriousness  
• Relationship to study product (causality)  
• Actions taken  
 
Adverse events will be assessed by [CONTACT_92943], relationship to the 
study intervention, pos sible etiologies, and whether the event meets the criteria as a serious 
adverse event and therefore requires immediate notification of the sponsor.  
 
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_102731] will be used to compare the efficacy of both devices.  A visual 
analog  assessment will be done will be done on all subje cts.  The numb er and percenta ge of 
reactions related to each brushing method will be collected and the final tolerance score 
estimated.  
 
The selection of 60 participants is expected to identify statistically significant differences in 
clinical parameters  before and after brushing  among the subjects of t he study.  The power 
analysis was based upon a recent study by  [CONTACT_92944] 9 in which a significant redu ction of 
plaque was achieved after brushing of p<0.[ADDRESS_102732]’s signed consent form and eligibility, and other study -
related documents pertaining to the conduct of the study shall be kept in a secure area.  
Confidentiality shall be maintained.  The results of this research projec t may be presented at 
meetings or in publications; however, subject identity will not be disclosed in such publications.   
  
Subject Confidentiality  
 
Subjects enrolled in the study shall be assigned a Subject ID number .  All recorded data are then 
entered per the unique Subject ID.  Subject information shall remain confidential.  However, 
consent forms that identify subjects may be inspected by [CONTACT_78269], its authorized designees 
and regulatory agencies including but not limited to, the Department of Health and Human 
Services (DHHS), the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other foreign 
regulatory bodies.  Because of the need to releas e information to these parties, absolute 
confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.  Only authorized personnel associated with the conduct 
and/or review of the study and the resultant data shall have access to information that links subject 
identifiers to the c orresponding assigned study code.  Disclosure of subject information to 
personnel other than those permitted by [CONTACT_464] , its designees or representatives, or 
appropriate regulatory agencies is prohibited.  
  
Risk and Benefit Analysis  
 
The subject may  be uncomfortable with another person watching them brush or experience some 
bleeding or sensitivity during this brushing procedure. All procedures conducted in the brushing 
procedure  are like what is experienced during a routine tooth brushing . The examiner  will perform 
a thorough pre intraoral evaluation to check for any type of abnormal abrasion or wound in the 
mouth. If there is any pre disposing condition in the subject’s mouth, the dental examiner will inform 
the subject and may recommend th e subject not participate in the study. The risk of permanent 
harm or injury, or disability as a result of participation in this research study is minimal. 
Participation is not expected to cause any oral conditions different from those normally 
experienced  in routine brushing with a  manual  toothbrush. There is a chance that use of the 
research study products may involve risks that are currently unknown. The subject  will be asked 
to report any discomfort or irritation that may be experience d while using research study products.   
 
Anticipate d Clinical Benefits  
 
Participation in this trial may not result in direct benefit to the subject . The information collected 
from subject s will be used to improve future product design and function . 
Compensation  
 
 
 
 
15 
 Participants in this study will  receive up to $ 50 in gift cards for their participation. A $[ADDRESS_102733] 
will be  given at the end of  each visit . No therapeutic or other benefit will be received by 
[CONTACT_6231].

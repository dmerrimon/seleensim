2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Nasopharyngeal C arcinoma  and Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 Signaling  
 
Non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)  is a common cancer in Southeast Asia where 
the incidence reaches its peak in regions such as Hong Kong, Guangzhou province of China and 
Singapore.  It is the 7th most common cancer in Hong Kong and in 2008, over 84,000 incident 
cases were diagnosed worldwi de.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_649301] I -II NPC, overall 
50,000 people died of NPC in 2002 alone worldwide.  This is because 20% of patients who 
present with metastatic disease have a median overall survival (OS) of only 12 to 15 months 
NCI Protocol #:9742  
Local Protocol #: MC1471  
Version Date:  January 6, 201 7 8 
 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] c hemotherapy.  For the 50% of patients who present with locoregionally advanced (stage 
III-IVB) disease, 30% will develop distant metastases following modern chemoradiotherapy.  
Immunotherapy for EBV associated NPC – our experience: EBV is ubiquitous in 
undifferentiated NPC in endemic regions, and EBV latent infection plays a vital role in NPC 
tumorigenesis.  Expression of the oncogenic EBV latent proteins has been shown to modulate the 
tumor inflammatory microenvironment and abolish host immune response  [1].  In order to 
overcome the immune -escape mechanisms of the EBV -associated NPC, strategies such as 
adoptive EBV -specific cytotoxic T -cell therapy and active immunization with EBV vaccines 
have been evaluated in patients with recurrent NPC  [2-4].  Significant tumor regressions have 
been reported in a few patients.   However, the labor -intensive and costly nature of these 
technologies has limited the broader application of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_649302].  Based on the 
collaborative effort by [CONTACT_649333] 
(CUHK) wi th the University of Birmingham, a new, recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara -
based vaccine that encodes EBV -specific tumor antigens has been developed and evaluated in a 
phase 1 study in NPC patients in Hong Kong  [5].  Our work underscores our capability in and 
commitment to research in immunotherapy for NPC.  
Targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD -1) signaling in cancer : In a heal thy host, 
PD-1 signaling in T cells regulates immune responses to minimize damage to by[CONTACT_649334] -antigens  [6].  PD-
1 is a trans -membranous  protein receptor  member that is highly expressed on activated T cells.  
It has 2 known ligands, PD -ligand 1 (B7 -H1 or CD274, which is expressed on tumor, antigen -
presenting cells APCs and dendritic cells) and PD -L2 (B7 -DC or CD273).   PD-L1 is 
overexpressed in many cancers  and has been linked to poor prognosis  [6].  Membranous PD -L1 
is thought to be more relevant prognostically than cytosolic PD -L1.  Inhibition of PD -[ADDRESS_870173] in NPC : To provide a proof -of-concept for the current study, our Prof 
K.W. Lo and his team from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (unpublished confidential 
data) has generated some preliminary data on PD -1 signaling in NPC:  
Figure 1, a and b: Expression of PD -L1 and PD -L2 in NPC models. PD -L1 is up -regulated in 
EBV -positive NPC cell lines, and expressed in over 70% of the 20 NPC samples analyzed.   
Figure 2 & 3 a and b: A significant number of PD -1+ cells in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes 
and also circulating CD8+ T cells can be found in NPC patients.  By [CONTACT_88304], we also 
detected PD -1-expressing infiltrating lymphocytes in NPC primary tumors. PD -L2 is also 
overexpressed in some NPC tumors (data not shown) but  its significance is uncertain.

2.2 Nivolumab  
 
2.2.1 Mechanism of Action  
 
Nivolumab (BMS -936558, MDX -1106, and ONO -4538) is a fully human monoclonal 
immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody (HuMAb) that is specific for human programmed death -1 
(PD-1, cluster of differentiation 279 [CD279]) cell surface membrane rece ptor [7].  PD -1 is a 
negative regulatory molecule that is expressed transiently foll owing T -cell activation and on 
chronically stimulated T cells characterized by [CONTACT_1629] “exhausted” phenotype.  Nivolumab binds to 
cynomolgus monkey PD -1 but not mouse, rat, or rabbit molecules.  Clinical activity of 
nivolumab has been observed in patients with melanoma, non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 
and renal cell carcinoma (RCC).   The combination of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (anti -cytotoxic 
T lymphocyte associated antigen -4 [anti -CTLA -4]) in a phase 1/2 trial showed markedly 
enhanced clinical activity wit h an acceptable safe ty profile in melanoma patients [8].   
 
The clinical use of monoclonal antibodies to T -cell inhibitory receptors has pro vided 
transformative information on the nature of the immune system and cancer.  An emerging pi[INVESTIGATOR_649303]/or 
improved survival even in patients with large volume tumors resista nt to other forms of therapy.  
Some of the unique features of this type of therapy, based largely on experience in advanced 
melanoma, include:  improved overall survival (OS) with or without radiographic responses or 
improved progression -free survival (PFS ); responses that may be delayed or occur after 
radiographic disease progression; combinations of immune modulators with enhanced or novel 
activities (in the example of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45762]); and toxicity that is almost exclusively 
immune or inflammato ry in nature.  It is not yet clear what factors determine responses and 
which components of the immune system are needed for this to occur.  It seems likely that both 
memory helper and effector cells would be needed to sustain long -term responses. Increasi ng 
emphasis has been placed on understanding the relationships of the tumor, cellu lar infiltrate, and 
immunologic milieu surrounding each tumor.  
 
PD-1, a 55 -kDa type 1 transmembrane protein, is a member of the CD28 family of T -cell co -
stimulatory receptors  that include Ig super family member CD28, CTLA -4, inducible co -
stimulator (ICOS), and B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) [7].  PD -1 is transiently but 
highly expressed on activated T cells functioning to limit immune effectors at the site of 
activation.  Chronic stimulation may prevent the re -methylation of the PD -1 gene leading to 
continuous expression an d characterizes a state of “exhausted” T cells that lose function and 
proliferative capacity while enhancing a suppressive tumor microenvironment.  PD -[ADDRESS_870174] 
together with other T -cell modulating molecules, including CTLA -4, TIM -3, lymphocyte -
activation  gene 3 (LAG -3) as well as indoleamine -pyrrole 2,3 -dioxygenase 1 (IDO -1), cytokines, 
and transforming growth factor beta (TGF -beta).   
 
Two ligands specific for PD -[ADDRESS_870175] been identified:  PD -ligand 1 (PD -L1, also known as B7 -H1 
or CD274, expressed on tumor, antigen -presenting cells [APCs], and dendritic cells [DCs]) and 
PD-L2 (also known as B7 -DC or CD273, expressed on endothelial cells).   The interaction of PD -
1 with PD -L1 and PD -L2 results in negative regulatory stimuli that down -modulate the activated 
NCI Protocol #:9742  
Local Protocol #: MC1471  
Version Date:  January 6, 201 7 11 
 
T-cell immune response through SHP -1 phosphatase . 
 
PD-1 knockout mice develop strain -specific lupus -like glomerulonephritis (C57BL/6) and  
cardiomyopathy (BALB/c).  In transplantable tumor models that expressed PD -1 and LAG -3 on 
tumor -infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells dual anti -LAG -3/anti -PD-[ADDRESS_870176] mice of established tumors that were largely resistant to single ant ibody treatment [9].  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_649304] -1 and LAG -3 single knockout mice, dual 
knockout mice abrogated self -tolerance with resultant autoimmune infiltrates in multiple organs, 
leading to eventual lethality.  
 
PD-L1 expression is found on a number of tumors, and is as sociated with poor prognoses based 
on OS in many tumors, including melanoma [10], renal  [11-13], esophageal [14], gastric  [15], 
ovarian  [16], pancreatic  [17], lung  [18], and other can cers [7]. 
 
The PD -1/PD -L1 axis plays a role in human infections, particularly in hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).  In these cases, high expre ssion levels of PD -1 were 
found in viral -specific CD8+ T cells that also display a non -responsive or exhausted phenotype.  
Non-responsive PD -1-high T cells were observed in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) 
infection in rhesus macaques.  Treatment of SIV -infected macaques with an anti -PD-1 mAb (3 
mg/kg x4) resulted in decreased viral loads and increased survival along with expanded T cells 
with increased T -cell functionality.   
 
2.2.2 Nonclinical Development of Nivolumab  
 
In intravenous (IV) repeat -dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, nivolumab alone 
was well tolerated [7].  Combination studies have highlighted the potential for toxicity when 
combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], MDX -1408, and BMS -986016.  Nivolumab bound specifically to 
PD-1 (and not to related members of the CD28 family such as CD28, ICOS, CTLA -4, and 
BTLA) with a K d = 3.06 nM.  A surrogate rat anti -mouse PD -1 antibody (4H2) was derived and 
expressed as chimeric IgG1 murine antibody.  Antitumor activity was seen for several tumor 
models, including colon carcinoma and fibrosarcoma.  
 
2.2.3 Clinical Development of Nivolumab  
 
Nivolumab is being evaluated as monotherapy and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
other immunotherapy (such as ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]), anti -angiogenesis therapy, and targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_411304] -sponsored clinical trials in NSCLC, melanom a, RCC, 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies including microsatellite 
instability (MSI) in colorectal cancer, and triple -negative breast cancer (TNBC) with an 
expanding group of indications [7].  In addition, two investigator -sponsored trials (ISTs) of 
nivolumab in combination with a peptide vaccine in melanoma are being conducte d in the 
adjuvant setting and advanced disease.  
 
Seven nivolumab studies were conducted in Japan, including six studies in advanced solid 
tumors and recurrent or unresectable stage III/IV melanoma sponsored by [CONTACT_649335]. Ltd., and one IST in recurrent or advanced platinum -refractory ovarian cancer.

2.2.4 Pharmacokinetics  
 
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of nivolumab was linear in the range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg, with dose -
proportional increases in maximum serum concentration (C max) and area under the concentr ation -
time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC 0-∞), with low to moderate inter -subject variability 
observed at each dose level [7].  Clearance of nivolumab is independent of dose in the dose range 
(0.1 to 10 mg/kg) and tumor types studied.  Body weight normalized dosing showed 
approximately constant trough concentrations over a wide range of body weights.  The mean 
terminal elimination half -life of BMS -936558 is 17 to 25 days consistent with the half -life of 
endogenous IgG4.   
 
2.2.5 Efficacy  
 
In a phase 1 (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg nivolumab doses) dose -escalation study the 3 mg/kg dose was 
chosen for expanded cohorts.  Among 236 patients, objective responses (ORs) (complete or 
partial responses [CR or PR]) were seen in NSCLC, melanoma, and RCC.  ORs were observed at 
all doses  [19].  Median OS was 16.8 months across doses and 20.3 months at the 3 mg/kg dose.  
Median OS across all dose cohorts was 9.2 months and 9.6 months for squamous and non -
squamous NSCLC, respectively  [20].  In the RCC cohort, median duration of response was 12.9 
months for both doses with 5 of the 10 responses lasting ≥  1 year  [21].   
 
In an advanced melanoma phase 1 study, nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_649305] 
3 weeks for 4 doses followed by [CONTACT_162614] 3 weeks for 4 doses (concurrent 
regimen) [8].  The combined treatment was subsequently administered every 12 weeks for up to 
8 doses.  In a sequenced regimen, patients previously treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_649306] 2 weeks for up to 48 do ses.  In the concurrent regimen (53 patients), 53% of 
patients had an OR at doses 1 mg/kg nivolumab and 3 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], with tumor reduction 
of 80% or more (modified World Health Organization [mWHO] criteria).  In the sequenced -
regimen (33 patients), t he objective response rate (ORR) was 20%.  
 
In a phase 1 study of nivolumab plus platinum -based doublet chemotherapy (PT -doublet) in 
chemotherapy -naïve NSCLC patients, 43 patients were treated with nivolumab + PT -doublet  
[22].  No dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported and total/confirmed ORRs were 43/33%, 
40/33%, and 31/31% in nivolumab/gemcitabine/cisplatin, nivolumab/pemetrexed/cisplatin, and 
nivolumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel arms, respectively.  
 
2.2.6 Toxicology  
 
A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nivolumab was not defined [23].  Serious adverse events 
(SAEs) occurred in 32 of 296 patients (11%) similar to the immune -related inflammat ory events 
seen with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]:  pneumonitis, vitiligo, colitis, hepatitis, hypophysitis, and thyroiditis (with 
noted pulmonary toxicity resulting in [ADDRESS_870177] also been reported.).   In combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_649307] -regimen group  [8], grade 3 or 4 treatment -related events were noted in 53% of 
patient s.  Skin rash represents the majority of these events.

2.2.7 Pharmacodynamics/Biomarkers  
 
Tumor -cell expression (melanoma) of PD -L1 was characterized in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_649308] -blood absolute 
lymphocyte count  [8].  With PD -L1 positivity defined as expression in at least 5% of tumor cells, 
biopsy specimens from  21 of 56 patients (38%) were PD -L1–positive.  Among patients treated 
with the concurrent regimen of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], ORs were observed in patients with 
either PD -L1–positive tumor samples (6 of 13 patients) or PD -L1–negative tumor samples (9 of 
22).  In the sequenced regimen cohorts, a higher number of overall responses was seen among 
patients with PD -L1–positive tumor samples (4 of 8 patients) than among patients with PD -L1–
negative tumor samples (1 of 13) suggesting the possibility that these tu mors have higher 
response rates to the combination.  The relationship between PDL -1 expression and responses 
may not be present in patients treated with the combination.  Tissue expression of PDL -2, 
interferon -γ (IFN - γ), IDO, and T cell CD8+ are of curren t interest.  Until more reliable data 
based on standardized procedures for tissue collection and assays are available, PD -L1 status 
cannot be used to select patients for treatment at this time.  
 
2.3 Rationale  
Hypothesis for current study:  
 
a) Based on our preliminary preclinical data as generated from NPC cell lines and patient’s 
tissues (see above), we hypothesize that NPC inhibits the activity and proliferation of 
tumor -specific CD8+ T cells via PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_870178]’s immune -surveillance in EBV -positive NPC.  
 
b) Inhibition of PD -1 signaling may thus reactivate PD -1 expressing tumor -infiltrating 
lymphocytes and induce tumor regression.  
 
2.4 Correlative Studies  
Rationale for using  plasma EBV DNA as a surrogate marker of tumor burden in NPC  
 
Investigators at the CUHK pi[INVESTIGATOR_649309] -time-PCR to quantitate the level 
of plasma EBV DNA [24, 25] .  It is a powerful prognostic marker which closely refle cts tumor 
burden in NPC [26, 27] .  Our investigators have also reported the ki netics of plasma EBV DNA 
during radiotherapy and surgery for NPC.  An initial surge followed by a rapid drop in plasma 
EBV DNA level can be observed, with an estimated half -life of around 3.8 days (range 2.2 -4.4 
days) [25, 28] .  Wang et al. found that the plasma EBV DNA clearance during the 1st 4 weeks of 
chemotherapy was prognostic, such that patients  with a half -life of <  8 days were more likely to 
respond than those with longer half -life values [29].  Our experience with plasma EBV DNA 
half-life in a phase II study of a AKT inhibitor, MK -2206, suggested that patients with a drop in 
plasma EBV DNA levels were more likely to remain on treatment for 6 months or more, 
compared with those who did not experie nce with a drop in level [30].  
In a recent ly published  study which compared the detection capability of this marker across 
different laboratories in Stanford U niversity ([LOCATION_003]), Taiwan and the CUHK, the Hong Kong site 
NCI Protocol #:9742  
Local Protocol #: MC1471  
Version Date:  January 6, [ADDRESS_870179] detection sensitivity (93%) [31].  This study also serves to 
harmonize the plasma EBV DNA assay in preparation for an international NRG study (NRG -
HN001, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).   This study aims to individualize adjuvant chemotherapy using plasma 
EBV DNA in locoregionally advanced NPC, and i nvolves investigators from the NRG, Chinese 
University of Hong Kong and Taiwan.  
Rationale  for measuring PD-L1 expression  in tumor and immune cells  
Topalian et al. found that high level of tumoral expression of PD -L1 was associated with higher  
response duration in nivolumab -treated patients  [23].  But this was not observed in a nivolum ab-
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_162] b study in melanoma [8].  Our preliminary work has shown that 15/20 NPC tumors 
(75%) expressed PD -L1, thus we plan to validate this marker in this study.   The dynamic nature 
of tumoral PD -L1 express ion may be dependent upon changes in the tumor microenvironment, 
and is closely correlated with the degree of immune infiltrate in tumors [32].  More recently in a 
phase 1b study of another PD -1 inhibitor, MK -3475 in recurrent head and neck squamou s 
carcinoma, patients with tumors that overexpressed PD -L1 above an arbitrary cut -off point 
([COMPANY_002]/Genentech assay used, defined as PD -L1 expression in > 1% of both tumor and adjacent 
immune cells) had higher tumor response rate (45.5%) than those who did not (11.4%) [33].  
Based on these data, therefore,  PD-L1 expression in the TILs in tumors will also be measured  in 
this study .  A recently published study has shown that the EBV oncogenic protein, latent 
membrane protein -1 (LMP -1) could up -regulate PD -L1 through STAT3, AP -1 and NF -κB 
pathways in NPC cell lines.  IFN-γ could also up -regulate PD -L1 independent of but synerget ic 
with LMP1 in vitro [42].   
Rationale for measuring absolute lymphocyte count  
 
A study on ipi[INVESTIGATOR_649310] (ALC) of > 1,000/mL and 
an increase in ALC around [ADDRESS_870180] clinical benefit [12].   But this 
was not observed in a  nivolumab -ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323362] [8]. Further validation in this study is 
warranted.

4.3 Patient Registration  
 
4.3.1 OPEN / IWRS  
 
Patient enrollment will be facilitated using the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network 
(OPEN).  OPEN is a web -based registration system available to users on a 24/7 basis.  It is 
integrated with the CTSU Enterprise System for regulatory and roster data inter change and 
with the Theradex Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) for retrieval of patient 
registration/randomization assignment.  Patient enrollment data entered by [CONTACT_33979] / IWRS will automatically transfer to the NCI’s clinical data managem ent system, 
Medidata Rave.  
 
For trials with slot reservation requirements, OPEN will connect to IWRS at enrollment 
initiation to check slot availability.  Registration staff should ensure that a slot is available 
and secured for the patient before completi ng an enrollment.  
 
The OPEN  system will provide the site with a printable confirmation of registration and 
treatment information.   Please print this confirmation for your records.   
 
4.3.2 OPEN/IWRS User Requirements  
 
OPEN/IWRS users must meet the following requi rements:  
• Have a valid CTEP -IAM account (i.e., CTEP username [CONTACT_2383]).  
• To enroll patients or request slot reservations:  Be on an ETCTN Corresponding  or 
Participating Organization roster with the role of Registrar.  
• To approve slot reservations or acces s cohort management:  Be identified to Theradex 
as the “Client Admin” for the study.  
• Have regulatory approval for the conduct of the study at their site.  
 
Prior to accessing OPEN/IWRS, site staff should verify the following:  
• All eligibility criteria have been met within the protocol stated timeframes.  Site staff 
should use the  registration forms provided on the CTSU web site as a tool to verify 
eligibility.  
• If applicable, all patients have signed an appropriate consent form and HIPAA 
authorization form.

4.4 Screening and General Guidelines  
 
Following registration, patients should begin protocol treatment ≤ 21 days.   Issues that would 
cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator.  If a patient does 
not receive protocol therapy following registration, the patient’s registration on the study 
may be canceled.  The Study Coordinator should be  notified of cancellations as soon as 
possible.  After the consent form is signed, refer to section 10 ‘Study Cale ndar’ for screening 
procedures.  Standard contrast CT will be done for assessing non -local recurrences. MRI will 
be used for assessing local re currence.  If dual PET and contrast CT is used to assess non -
local recurrences at baseline, all subsequent radiological assessments must include a PET -
CT. 
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Agent Administration  
 
Treat ment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  Reported adverse events and potential 
risks are described in Section 7.  Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6.  
No investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_649312]'s malignancy.  
 
5.1.1 Nivolumab  
 
Nivolu mab is given every 2 weeks on day 1 and  day 15 ( ± 1 days), in a 4-week  cycle, at a 
dose of 3mg/kg  intravenously.  
 
Patients may be dosed no less than 13 days  from the previous dose of drug.  
 
The dosing calculations should be based on the actual body weight.  If the patient’s weight 
on the day of dosing differs by >10% from the weight used to calculate the original dose , the 
dose must be recalculated.  All doses should be rounded to the nearest milligram.  Dose 
rounding based on institutional guidelines is not preferred.   There will be no dose 
modifications allowed.   
Nivolumab is to be administered as a 60 -minute IV inf usion  (± 10 minutes), using a 
volumetric pump with a 0.2/1.2 micron in -line filter at the protocol -specified dose.  The drug

Nivolumab is a full human monoclonal antibody and infusion reactions, including high -grade 
hypersensitivity reactions, following administration of nivolumab are uncommon [7]. Pre-
medications are not routinely given.  
 
Growth factors (e.g. granulocyte colony stimulating factor, erythropoietin) are not allowed 
during the study.  
 
Supportive measures such as ant i-emetics (e.g. , metoclopramide, tropi[INVESTIGATOR_14960], granisetron)  
and other pre -medications which have been mentioned in this protocol will be  allowed.  
 
5.3 Duration of Therapy  and Criteria for Study Discontinuation  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s) , treatment may continue until one 
of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Disease progression  (unless the investigator judges that the patient is eligible for 
continuing beyond progression as stated in section 5.7) , 
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or  
 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  which include the following (see also section  6 and 
specific algorithms  in Appendix C): 
 
a) Any grade 4 events except as noted in item ‘h’ below.  
 
b) Grade 3 drug -related autoimmune or inflammatory events including uveitis, 
pneumoni tis, diarrhea, colitis, neurologic adverse events, hypersensitivity 
reaction, or infusion reaction of any duration requires discontinuation except 
as noted in item ‘h’ below:  
 
c) Any grade 2 drug -related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision that does not 
respond to topi[INVESTIGATOR_20308] 1 severity within the 
NCI Protocol #:9742  
Local Protocol #: MC1471  
Version Date:  January 6, 201 7 24 
 
re-treatment period OR requires systemic treatment.  
 
d) Patients requiring > two dose delays for the same type of event  (of grade 2 
severity or above)  should go off protocol therapy , unless the study doctor 
thinks that it is in the patient’s best interest to remain in the study. The study 
doctor should also consult the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_649313].   
 
e) Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in 
the judgment of the investigator, presents a substantial clinic al risk to the 
subject with continued study drug dosing  
 
f) Tumor assessments should continue as per protocol even if dosing is 
interrupted.  Any patients who require additional immune suppressive 
treatment beyond steroids should go off study treatment  
 
g) Any dosing interruption lasting >  6 weeks, with the following exceptions:   
Patients being tapered after high dose corticosteroids over one month followed 
by a two -week observation period will be allowed an additional two weeks to 
restart treatment ( a max imum  eight week interruption).  Dosing interruptions 
> [ADDRESS_870197] with a dosing 
interruption lasting >  [ADDRESS_870198] be consulted.  
 
h) The following exceptions do NOT require permanent study discontinuation:  
- Any other grade 3 non -skin, drug -related AE (other than grade 3 immune 
mediated event) lasting < 7 days including fatigue.  
 
- Any grade 3 or 4 drug -related laboratory abnormality or electrolyte 
abnormality, not associated with underlying organ pathology , that does not 
require treatment except for electrolyte replacements does not  require 
treatment discontinuation.   
 
- Grade 3 or 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities that are not associated with 
diabetes mellitus (DM), associated liver or gall bladder inflammation 
clinical manifestations of pancreatitis and which decrease to [ADDRESS_870199].  Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be  
followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.   The frequency and procedure 
of follow -up is determined at the discretion of the doctor, or according to institutional 
practice.

5.5 Criteria to Resume Treatment  
 
5.5.1 General C riteri a for R estarting Nivolumab : 
 
Some patients may continue to benefit from treatment, maintaining or improving responses 
after progression including those treated with steroids.  
 
Restarting applies only to grade 2 events and some grade 3 events (skin rash and thyroiditis). 
The section should emphasize stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_649314].  
 
For non -autoimmune or non -inflammatory events patients may resume treatment with study 
drug wh en the drug -related AE(s) resolve to Grade  ≤1 or baseline value, with the following 
exceptions:  
• Patients may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigue  
• Evaluation to exclude any additional immune mediated events endocrine, GI, and 
liver / pancreas  function as clinically indicated must be made prior to restarting.  
• Non-drug-related toxicity including hepatic, pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis, 
must have resolved to baseline before treatment is resumed.  
 
If the criteria to resume treatment are  met, the patient should restart treatment no sooner than 
the next scheduled time point per protocol.  However, if the treatment is delayed past the next 
scheduled time point per protocol the treatment should resume at the earliest convenient 
point that is  within the six week delay period.  
 
If treatment is delayed for >  6 weeks, (>  8 weeks for patients on a steroid taper), the patient 
must be permanently discontinued from study therapy, except as specified in Section 5. 3 
(Duration of Therapy).  
 
It should be emphasized that if adverse event occurs which requires treatment with steroids, 
it is preferable to withhold nivolumab and start steroids earlier to obtain resolution with the 
possibility for restarting nivolumab, rather than just waiting for hig her grade events.  
 
5.5.[ADDRESS_870200] resolve to < Grade [ADDRESS_870201] nivolumab withheld until 
resoluti on to < Grade [ADDRESS_870202] 2 weeks following complete removal from steroid 
treatment except for maintenance replacement doses for adrenal insufficiency (preferably no 
greater than 10mg prednisone equivalent daily ).   
 
All patients treated with steroids for grade ≥  [ADDRESS_870203] nivolumab discontinued.  
NCI Protocol #:9742  
Local Protocol #: MC1471  
Version Date:  January 6, 201 7 26 
 
Patients with grade 3 thyroiditis and skin rash may continue therapy , as for grade 2 events 
with resolution and stable replacement treatment.  
 
Patients with hepatitis, pancreatitis, pneumon itis, and colitis are at risk for exacerbation with 
retreatment if there is residual inflammation and should resolve to Grade 0 or baseline before 
retreatment.  Baseline can mean the initial grade i.e. grade <[ADDRESS_870204] be drawn if clin ically feasible  
to document baseline function and distinguish the pi[INVESTIGATOR_649315] (or thyroid)  treatment associated  ACTH ( or TSH)  
suppression.   Steroids should be started prior to obtaining results ba sed on clinical 
indications.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_870205] with fever, chills, rigors, headache, ra sh, urticaria, 
angioedema, pruritis, arthralgias, hypo - or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms.  
 
All Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions should be reported as an SAE if criteria are met.  Infusion 
reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE ve rsion 4.0 guidelines.  
 
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local 
treatment standards and guidelines as medically appropriate : 
 
5.6.1 For Grade 1 S ymptoms  
(Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not indicated)  
 
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms.  Infusion rate may be 
slowed.  If the infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion 
NCI Protocol #:9742  
Local Protocol #: MC1471  
Version Date:  January 6, 201 7 27 
 
rate when symptoms resolve; if no furt her complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may 
be increased to 100% of the original infusion rate.  Monitor patient closely.   
 
The following prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions:  
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) a nd/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) 
at least 30 minutes before additional nivolumab administrations, slowing infusion rate as 
above.  
 
5.6.2 For Grade 2 Symptoms    
(Moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but responds promptly to 
symptomatic treatment [e.g., antihistamines, non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; close observation for recurrence and 
treatment medications may need to be continued for 24 -48 hours).   
 
Stop the n ivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject with 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg 
(acetaminophen); remain at bedside and monitor patient until resolution of symptoms.  
Corticoste roid or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate.  If the 
infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when 
symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be 
increased to 100% of the original infusion rate.  Monitor patient closely.  If symptoms recur, 
then no further nivolumab will be administered at that visit.  Administer diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_870206] be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF).   
The following prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and (acetaminophen) (or paracetamol) [ADDRESS_870207] 30 minutes before additional nivolumab administrations.  
If necessary, corticosteroids (recommended dose: up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or 
equivalent) may be used.  
 
5.6.3 For Grade 3 or Grade 4 S ympt oms 
(Severe reaction), Grade 3 symptoms: prolonged [i.e., not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_13081]/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of symptoms following initial 
improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14138] [ e.g., renal impairment, 
pulmonary infiltrates]).Grade 4 symptoms: (life threatening; pressor or ventilator  support 
indicated).  
 
Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab.  Begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and 
treat the subject as follows.  Recommend bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of a 
1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,0 00 solution 
injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed.  Patient should be monitored until 
the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur.  Nivolumab  will be 
permanently discontinued.  Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the 
treatment of anaphylaxis.  Remain at bedside and monitor patient until recovery from 
symptoms.  In the case of late -occurring hypersensitivity symptoms ( e.g., appearance of a 
NCI Protocol #:9742  
Local Protocol #: MC1471  
Version Date:  January 6, 201 7 28 
 
localized or generalized pruritis within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may 
be given (e.g., oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).  
 
• Please note that late occurring events including isolated fever and fatigue may repr esent 
the presentation of systemic inflammation.  Please evaluate accordingly.  
 
 
5.7 Treatment Beyond Progression  
 
A minority of subjects treated with immunotherapy may derive clinical benefit either delayed 
responses, stable disease, or increased overall sur vival despi[INVESTIGATOR_222048] (PD) with nivolumab or combination treatment.   
 
Patients may be permitted to continue treatment beyond initial RECIST 1.1 -defined PD 
occurring during the initial induction period (up to 12 weeks) , as long as they meet all of the 
following criteria  (see section 5.7.1  below).  Patients are allowed to continue treatment for 
one additional cycle ( 4 weeks) and then be reassessed.    
 
5.7.1 Criteria  for C ontinui ng Treatment Beyond Progression  
  
1) No more than 4 new lesions  (excluding new brain metastases) , with the  total sum of 
the longest diameter (SHORT diameter for LN) cannot exceed  40% of the initial sum 
including new lesions   
2) Patients must be clinically stable with no change in performance status due to di sease 
progression  
3) No indication for immediate alternative treatment  (such as radiotherapy).  
4) Patient [assessed by [CONTACT_093]] is showing clinical benefit and tolerates study 
drug.  The assessment of clinical benefit should take into account whether t he subject 
is clinically sta ble or deteriorating and  likely or unlikely to receive further benefit 
from continued treatment.  
5) The time of progression is noted from the first assessment that exceeds standard 
criteria  
 
New lesions are considered measurable at the time of initial progression if the longest 
diameter is at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have a short 
axis of at least 15 mm).  Any new lesion considered non -measurable at the time of initial 
progression may become measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden 
measurement if the longest diameter increases to at least 10 mm (except for pathological 
lymph nodes, which must have an increase in short axis to at least 15 mm).   
 
All decisions to continue tre atment beyond initial progression must be documented in the 
study record and are a part of an agreement with DCTD, NCI.   
 
For statistical analyses : Subjects who continue treatment beyond first progression (as 
determined by [CONTACT_649340] -assessed, RECIST 1.1 -defined progression ) will be 
considered to have investigator -assessed ‘progressive disease ’ at the time of the initial 
NCI Protocol #:9742  
Local Protocol #: MC1471  
Version Date:  January 6, 201 7 29 
 
progression event . However, if they subsequently experi ence a CR or PR they may be 
designated as a ‘delayed response ’ for the purposes of determining ORR and thus, in the final 
analysis , be counted as a respon der for the two -stage design.  
 
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE M ODIFICATIONS  
 
No dose modifications are allowed  in this protocol.  Nivolumab can be ‘continued ’, ‘delayed’, 
‘withheld ’ or ‘permanently discontinued ’.  
 
See Appendi x C to the protocol for toxicity management algorithms which include specific 
treatment guidelines .  These algorithms  should be followed unless there are specific clinical 
circumstances which the treating physician indicates variations or alternative treatment is 
needed.

the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_870216] access to a 
copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.  A co py of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from 
the CTEP web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
 
For expedited reporting purposes only:   
- AEs for the agent  that are bold and italicized  in the CAEPR (i.e., those listed in the 
SPEER column, Section 7.1) should be reported through CTEP -AERS only if the 
grade is above the grade provided in the SPEER.  
 
Attribution  of the AE:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatm ent. 
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
7.3 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting  
 
NCI Protocol #:9742  
Local Protocol #: MC1471  
Version Date:  January 6, [ADDRESS_870217] use CTEP -AERS  (CTEP Adverse Event 
Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP Web site ( https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers ).  
The reporting procedures to be followed are presented in the “NCI Guidelines for 
Investigators: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements for DCTD (CTEP and CIP) and DCP 
INDs and IDEs” which can be downloaded from the CTEP Web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm ).  
These requirements are briefly outlined in the tables below (Section 7.3.3).  
 
In the rare  occurrence when Internet connectivity is lost, a [ADDRESS_870218] be entered electronically into CTEP -AERS  by [CONTACT_649341].  
 
7.3.2 Distributio n of Adverse Event Reports  
 CTEP -AERS  is programmed for automatic electronic distribution of reports to the following 
individuals:  Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_33952] (s) (if applicable) of the 
Corre sponding Organization, the local treating physician, and the Reporter and Submitter .  
CTEP -AERS  provides a copy feature for other e -mail recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
 
The Coordinating Center of the Corresponding  Organization is responsible for submitting to 
the CTSU documentation of AEs that they deem reportable for posting on the CTSU protocol 
web page and inclusion on the CTSU bi -monthly broadcast.  
 
7.3.3 Expedited Reporting Guidelines  
 
Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID assigned during trial 
registration on all reports.  
Note:  A death on study requires both  routine and expedited reporting regardless of 
causality, unless as noted below.  Attribution to treatment or other cause mu st be 
provided.  
 
Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Neoplasms benign, 
malignant and unspecified (incl uding  cysts and polyps) - Other (Progressive Disease)”  
under the system organ class (SOC) of the same name.  Evidence that the  death was a 
manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or 
progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be submitted.

Local Protocol #: MC1471  
Version Date:  January 6, 201 7 42 
 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not 
they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/bi rth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or sur gical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST be immediately reported to the NCI via electronic 
submission within the tim eframes detailed in the table below.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317] 1 and Grade 2 Timeframes  Grade 3 -5

≥ 24 hrs  Not required  
NOTE:   Protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adverse events are found in the Specific 
Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) portion of the CAEPR.  
Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as:  
o “24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days” - The AE must initially be submitted electronically within 24 hours of learning 
of the AE, followed by a complete expedited report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24 -hour report.  
o “10 Calendar Days” - A complete expedited report on the AE must be submitted electronically within [ADDRESS_870220] administration of investigational 
agent/intervention and have an attribution of possible, probable, or definite require reporting as follows:  
Expedited 24 -hour notification followed by [CONTACT_6794] 5 calendar days for:  
• All Grade 3, 4, and Grade 5 AEs  
Expedited 10 calendar day reports for:  
• Grade [ADDRESS_870221] whole day, after the agent/intervention was last administered.  Footnote “1” above 
applies after this reporting period.

Version Date:  January 6, [ADDRESS_870223].   
 
7.5 Secondary Malignancy  
 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy (e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chem otherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a meta stasis of the initial neoplasm.  
 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent 
under an NCI IND/IDE be reported expeditiously via CTEP -AERS .  Three options ar e 
available to describe the event:  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (includin g AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
Indicate form for reporting in Rave, timeframes, and if loading of the pathology report is 
required. 
 
7.6 Second Malignancy  
 
A second malignancy is one unrelat ed to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine AE 
reporting unless otherwise specified . 
 
8. PHARMACEUTICAL INFOR MATION  
 
A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the investigational administered in 
this study can be found in Section 7.1.  
 
8.1 CTEP IND Agent(s)  
 
8.1.1 Nivolumab (NSC 748726)  
 
Amino Acid Sequence :  4 polypeptide chains, which include 2 identical heavy chains with 
440 amino acids and 2 identical light chains.  
 
Other Names :  BMS -936558, MDX1106  
NCI Protocol #:9742  
Local Protocol #: MC1471  
Version Date:  January 6, 201 7 44 
 
 
Classification :  Anti -PD-1MAb  
 
M.W. :  146,221 Daltons  
 
Mode of Action :  Nivolumab targets the programmed death –1 (PD -1, cluster of 
differentiation 279 [CD279]) cell surface membrane receptor .  PD -1 is a negative regulatory 
receptor expressed by [CONTACT_93247] T and B lymphocytes.  Binding of PD -1 to its ligands, 
programmed death –ligand 1 (PD -L1) and 2 (PD -L2), results in the down -regulation of 
lymphocyte activation.  Nivolumab inhibits the binding  of PD -1 to PD -L1 and PD -L2.  
Inhibition of the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands promotes immune responses and 
antigen -specific T -cell responses  to both foreign antigens as well as self -antigens . 
 
Description :  Nivolumab Injection is a clear to opa lescent, colorless to pale yellow liquid; 
light (few) particulates may be present.  The drug product is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, single -
use, isotonic aqueous solution formulated in sodium citrate, sodium chloride, mannitol, 
diethylenetriamine pentacetic ac id (pentetic acid) and polysorbate 80 (Tween® 80), pH 6.0.  
 
How Supplied :  Nivolumab is supplied by [CONTACT_414] -Myers Squibb and distributed by [CONTACT_124438], CTEP/DCTD/NCI as 100 mg vials (10 mg/mL) w ith a 
0.7 mL overfill .  It is suppli ed in 10 mL type I flint glass vials, with butyl rubber stoppers and 
aluminum seals.  
 
Preparation :  Nivolumab injection can be infused undiluted (10 mg/mL) or diluted with 
0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose, USP to concentrations no less th an 
0.35 mg/mL . 
 
Storage :  Vials of Nivolumab injection must be stored at 2° -8°C (36° -46°F) and protected 
from light , freezing , and shaking .  
 
Stability :  Shelf -life surveillance of the intact vials is ongoing.  
 
The administration of undiluted and diluted solutions of Nivolumab must be completed 
within 24 hours of preparation.  If not used immediately, the infusion solution may be stored 
up to 24 hours in a refrigerator at 2° -8°C (36° -46°F) and a maximum of 4 hours of the total 
24 hours can be at ro om temperature (20° -25°C, 68° -77°F) and room light.  The maximum [ADDRESS_870224] 
administration period.  
 
CAUTION:  The single -use dosage form contains no antibacterial preservative or 
bacteriostatic agent.  Therefore, it is advised that the product be discarded 8 hours after initial 
entry.  
 
Route of Administration :  Intravenous infusion.  Do not administer as an IV push or bolus 
injection.  NOTE REF TO DOSING SCHEDULE  
 
NCI Protocol #:9742  
Local Protocol #: MC1471  
Version Date:  January 6, 201 7 45 
 
Method of Administration :  Administer through a 0.2 micron to 1.2 micron pore size, low -
protein binding polyethersulfone membrane in -line filter.  
 
Potential Drug Interactions :  No incompatibilities between Nivolumab injection and 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), non -PVC/no n-DEHP (di[2 -ethylhexyl]phthalate) IV components, 
or glass bottles have been observed.  
 
Availability : Nivolumab is an investigational agent supplied to investigators by [CONTACT_110700] (DCTD), NCI.  
 
Nivolumab is provided to t he NCI under a Collaborative Agreement between the 
Pharmaceutical Collaborator and the DCTD, NCI (see Section 12.3).  
 
8.1.2 Agent Ordering and Agent Accountability  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  NCI-supplied agents may be requested by [CONTACT_079] (or their authorized 
designee)  at each participating institution.  Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) 
policy requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be 
treated.  PMB does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior  
approval from PMB is obtained).  The CTEP -assigned protocol number must be used for 
ordering all CTEP -supplied investigational agents.  The responsible investigator at each 
participating institution must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual 
submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), Curriculum Vitae, 
Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), and Financial Disclosure Form (FDF).  If 
there are several participating investigators at one institution, CTEP -supplied 
investigational agen ts for the study should be ordered under the name [CONTACT_25559].  
 
Active CTEP -registered investigators and investigator -designated shippi[INVESTIGATOR_52343] (OAOP) application ( https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/OAOP/pages/login.jspx ).  
Access to OAOP requires the establishment of a CTEP Identity and Access Managemen t 
(IAM) account ( https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/iam/ ) and the maintenance of an “active” 
account status and a “current” password.  For questions about drug orders, transfers, 
returns, or accountability, c all (240) 276 -6575 Monday through Friday between 8:30 am 
and 4:30 pm (ET) or email [EMAIL_087]  anytime.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Agent Inventory Records – The investigator, or a responsible party designated by [CONTACT_1275], must maintain a careful record of the inventory and disposition of all agents 
received from DCTD using the NCI Drug Accountability Record Form (DARF).  (See 
the NCI Investigator’s Handbook for Procedures for Drug Accountability and Storage.)

9.2.1 Plasma EBV DNA C learance  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypothesis:  We hypothesize that plasma EBV DNA half -life during the first [ADDRESS_870226] -response to nivolumab.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Collection of Specimen(s) :  
This test  is mandatory  for all enrolled subjects . 3-5ml of EDTA blood sa mple (x  1 tube) 
will be taken at baseline (within [ADDRESS_870227] dose of study drug ), and then 
at weekly interval : week 1 (day 7 +/- 2 days) , week 3 (day 21 +/-2 days), week 4  (day 28 
+/- 2 days), week 5 (day 35 +/ - 2 days) and week 6 (day 42, +/ - 2 days) . Week 2 sampling 
is omitted given the possibility of a surge in level.  Consecutive samples can only be 
taken with no m ore than 5 to 9  days apart .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Handling of Specimens  
 
After blood sampling, the EDT A blood  samples should be centrifuged as soon as possible 
(within 30 minutes to 1 hour) at 1600 x g for 10 minutes at 4degrees Celsius  temperature .  
The plasma will be transferred to a fresh tube (1.5 ml) and then centrifuged at [ZIP_CODE] x g 
for 10 minutes at 4 degree Celsius. The centrifuged plasma will be  transferred to a fresh 
tube without disturbing the pellet at the bottom of the tube, and then stored at –70 to -80 
degree until analysis.   Analysis will be performed using the real -time quantitative PCR 
techn ique as previously described [25, 28] .  Each sample will be labeled by [CONTACT_102]’s 
study code, study protocol number and date of sample collection.   Each blood tube should 
be accompanied by a laboratory form containing the following information: date of blood 
collection, patient’s stu dy code, type of sample (e.g. ‘baseline’, ‘week 1’, ‘w eek 2’, 
‘week3’, ‘week 4’).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Site Performing Correlative Study   
 
Plasma EBV DBA analysis using real -time quantitative PCR assays  will be performed at 
the Prince of Wales Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Hong Kong, through collaboration with the Department of 
Chemical Pathology, Chinese University of Hong Kong. This is one of the reference 
laboratories for determining this biomarker  in a NRG study (31).  
 
 
9.2.2 Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging  (For Prince of Wales Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_567545])  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypothesis and  rationale  
 
Anatomical imaging (CT and MRI) and functional imaging (FDG - PET) are the current 
standards for monitoring cancer treatment response.  However, research into functional 
MRI techniques has  also shown potential value for predicting and monitoring treatment 
response (41).  Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE -MRI) (which uses the same 
standard contrast agent that is used for conventional anatomic imaging) and T2* mappi[INVESTIGATOR_649323], while diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) provides 
ADC param eters that can reflect cell density, cell swelling and membranes.  Using the 
ADC values obtained at low b values by [CONTACT_649342] (IVIM) DWI 
technique the vascularity can be assessed also without the need for intravenous contrast.   
An early (around 2 -3 weeks) intratreatment increase in ADC values (as cells shrink and 
die) has been shown to predict a favourable treatment response to chemoradiation in hea d 
and neck tumours  (44, 45) , but there are conflicting results for other regions of t he body 
where it is known that results are influenced by [CONTACT_649343].  It 
has also been reported that head and neck tumours which, after an initial ADC rise early 
intratreatment, later in the course of treatment show a fall in ADC  (presumed to represent 
repopulation by [CONTACT_649344]) are also associated with a n 
unfavourable outcome ( 45).   
The effect of Nivolumab treatment on functional imaging parameters in NPC is unknown 
but the use of PD -1 inhibitor may be associated with an increased level of tumor 
infiltration by T -cells and inflammatory cells.  We hypothesize that this early 
inflammatory response will increase vascularity and cell density and decrease the 
extracellular space and so will be reflected as  an early increase in vascular parameters on 
DCE and T* and decease in ADC, before a reversal in these parameters later in the 
course of treatment.  
The first step is to document these changes in functional imaging parameters over the 
course of treatment a nd correlate with changes in tumour volume.  Subsequently, if the 
sample size is sufficient, we plan to correlate the functional imaging parameters with 
treatment outcome bas ed on objective response (RECIST)  and survival .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Data collection and analysis   
 
MRI will be performed on a 3T MRI scanner (Achieva, Philips Healthcare, Best, The 
NCI Protocol #:9742  
Local Protocol #: MC1471  
Version Date:  January 6, 201 7 49 
 
Netherlands) using a 16 channel head and neck SENSE coil.  Anatomical and functional 
data will be obtained to document changes in the target lesions during and aft er 
treatment.  Target lesions will include: Primary or nodal metastases in the head and neck, 
distant metastatic sites.  MRI scanning will be performed at the Department of Diagnostic 
Radiology and Interventional Radiology at the Prince of Wales Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ( PWH), Hong 
Kong.  Only subjects enrolled from the PWH will be invited to participate in th is optional 
correlative study.  
 
MRI Sequences   
a) Conventional axial The MRI examination (1.5 or 3T) will cover the skull base 
down to the lower neck below the suprasternal notch using section thickness = 
4mm with no intersection gap.  Conventional MRI consists of following images; 
axial T1W, axial T2W wi th fat suppression; sagittal T1W; contrast -enhanced 
axial T1W post contrast with and without fat suppression; coronal T1W post 
contrast. The T1W and T2W images will be obtained before the functional images 
and the T1+C will be performed after the DCE -MRI).   Tumour volume will be 
calculated (summation of areas X slice thickness).   
b) Functional sequences   
• Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Single -shot echo -planar imaging 
technique with b -values from 0 -1000 s/mm2. Assessment of the apparent 
diffusion coeffici ent (ADC), diffusion coefficient (D), pseudo -diffusion 
(perfusion) coefficient (D*), and fraction of pseudo -diffusion (f). Whole 
body Diffusion weighted MRI (DWIBS) will be performed.  T2* Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: 
T2* mappi[INVESTIGATOR_649324] a multiech o T2* sequence 
based on a multishot fast -field echo technique. T2* mappi[INVESTIGATOR_649325] T2* measurements.  
 
• Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE -MRI), a pre -contrast T1 map is 
derived using two different flip angles [2º, 15º]. The dynamic sequence is 
obtained using a short 3D T1 -weighted spoiled gradient echo sequence. 
Contrast injection is commenced [ADDRESS_870228] agent (gadopenetate dimeglumine (Dotarem, 
Guerbet, [LOCATION_009]) at a concentration of 0.1 mmol/kg of body weight. In 
addition, immediately after the DCE -MRI scan, post -contrast enhanced 
anatomical T1 -weighted images will be  obtained. Assessment of the Ktrans, 
Kep and Ve of tumors pre -treatment.

11. MEASUREMENT OF EFFEC T 
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guidelines 
(version 1.1).  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor 
lesions and the short axis measurements in the case of lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 
guideline.  [42] 
 
11.[ADDRESS_870235] dose of nivolumab, and then at week 16 and week 24, and then every 12 
weeks thereafter.  In addition to a baseline scan, con firmatory scans should also be obtained 
within 8 weeks (not less than 4) following initial documentation of objective response.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_870236] diameter can be accurately 
measured as  2.[ADDRESS_870237] x -ray, or as ≥1.[ADDRESS_870238] component of a 
PET/CT, or MRI.  
 
A superficial non -nodal lesion is measurable if its longest diameter is ≥ 1.0 cm in diameter 
as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules) or imaging.  In the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is 
recommended.  
 
A malignant lymph node is c onsidered measurable if its short axis is >1.[ADDRESS_870239] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).   
 
Note:   Tumor lesions in a previously irradiated area are not considered measurable disease.   
 
 
11.2.2 Non-Measu rable Disease  
 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) are considered non -measurable disease, including 
pathological nodes (those with a short axis ≥1.0 to <1.5 cm).  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory 
breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non -
measurable as well.  
 
Note : ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if  they meet the definition of measurability described above. 
However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for 
NCI Protocol #:9742  
Local Protocol #: MC1471  
Version Date:  January 6, [ADDRESS_870240] a short axis <1.0 cm 
are considered non -pathological (i.e., normal) and should not be recorded or 
followed.  
 
11.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
11.3.1  Measurement Methods    
 
• All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (i.e., decimal fractions of 
centimeters) using a ruler or calipers.  
• The same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. For patients 
having only lesions measuring at least [ADDRESS_870241] -treatment tumor assessments.   
• Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_300829] 
a treatment.   
 
11.3.2 Acceptable Modalities for Measurable D isease  
 
• Conventional CT and MRI:  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on 
CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_870242] slice thickness greate r than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion 
should b e twice the slice thickness.  
 
• As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning 
sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of 
disea se.  The lesions should be measured on the same pulse sequence.  Ideally, the 
same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be 
followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with 
breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
• PET-CT:  If the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of 
identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the 
CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchange ably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time.   
 
• Chest X -ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they 
are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT scans are 
preferable.  
 
• Physical Examination:  For superficial non -nodal lesions, physical examination is 
acceptable, but imaging is preferable, if both can be done. In the case of skin lesions, 
NCI Protocol #:9742  
Local Protocol #: MC1471  
Version Date:  January 6, 201 7 56 
 
documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the 
lesion, is recommended.  
 
• FDG -PET:  FDG -PET scanning is allowed to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progressive disease [PD] and particularly possible 'new' disease.  A 
‘positive’ FDG -PET scanned lesion is defined as one which is FDG avid with an 
update  greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected 
image; otherwise, an FDG -PET scanned lesion is considered ‘negative.’  New 
lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the 
following algorithm:  
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign 
of PD based on a new lesion.  
 
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:   
 
i. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of 
disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.   
 
ii. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT at the same evaluation, additional follow -up CT scans 
(i.e., additional follow -up scans at least 4 weeks later) are needed to 
determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site.   In this 
situation, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal PDG -
PET scan.   
 
iii If the positive FDG -PET at fol low-up corresponds to a pre -existing site 
of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic 
images, it is not classified as PD.  
 
11.3.[ADDRESS_870243] 4 weeks (within 8 weeks but not less than 4 
weeks apart) following initial documentation of an objective status of either complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect 
of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
Cytologic and histologic tech niques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare 
cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, where known residual 
benign tumors can remain.)

Local Protocol #: MC1471  
Version Date:  January 6, [ADDRESS_870244]  
 
11.4.1  Target Lesions and Target Lymph Nodes  
 
• Measurable lesions (as defined in Section 11.21) up to a maximum of 5 lesions, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as “Target Lesions” and 
recorded and measured at baseline.  These lesions can be non -nodal or nodal (as 
define d in 11.21 ), where no more than 2 lesions are from the same organ and no more 
than 2 malignant nodal lesions are selected.  
 
 Note:  If fewer than 5 target lesions and target lymph nodes are identified (as there 
often will be), there is no reason to perform  additional studies beyond those specified 
in the protocol to discover new lesions.   
 
• Target lesions and target lymph nodes should be selected on the basis of their size, be 
representative of all involved sites of disease, but in addition should be those that lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) does not lend itself to 
reproducible measurements in which circumstance the next largest lesion (or 
malignant ly mph node) which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.   
 
• Baseline Sum of Dimensions (BSD):  A sum of the longest diameter for all target 
lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes will be calculated 
and reported as the baseline sum of dimensions (BSD).  The BSD will be used as 
reference to further characterize any objective tumor response in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.   
 
• Post-Baseline Sum of the Dimensions (PBSD):  A sum of the longest diameter for all 
target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes will be 
calculated and reported as the post -baseline sum of dimensions (PBSD).  If the 
radiologist is able to provide an actual measure for the target lesion (or target lymph 
node) , that should be recorded, even if it is below 0.5 cm.  If the target lesion (or target 
lymph node) is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a 
default value of 0.[ADDRESS_870245] that 
the target lesion or target lymph node has likely disappeared, the measurement should 
be recorded as 0 cm.  
 
• The minimum sum of the dimensions (MSD) is the minimum of the BSD and the 
PBSD.  
 
11.4.2 Non-Target Lesions  and Non-Target Lymph Nodes  
 
Non-measurable sites of disease (Section 11.22) are classified as non - target lesions or non -
target lymph nodes and should also be recorded at baseline.  These lesions and lymph nodes 
should be followed in accord with 11.433.

Section 11.1.  Specifically, a change in objective status to eithe r a PR or CR cannot be done 
without re -measuring target lesions and target lymph nodes.  
 
Note: Non-target lesions and non -target lymph nodes should be evaluated at each 
assessment, especially in the case of first response or confirmation of response.  In selected 
circumstances, certain non -target organs may be evaluated less frequently.  For example, 
bone scans may need to be repeated only when complete response is identified in target 
disease or when progression in bone is suspected.  
 
Evalua tion of Target Lesions  
 
• Complete Response (CR):  All of the following must be true:  
a. Disappearance of all target lesions.  
b. Each target lymph node must have reduction in short axis to <  1.0 cm.  
 
• Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in PBSD (sum of the longest diameter 
for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes at 
current evaluation) taking as reference the BSD (see Section 11.41).  
 
• Progression (PD):  At least one of the following must be true:  
a.  At least one new malignant lesion, which also includes any lymph node that 
was normal at baseline (< 1.0 cm short axis) and increased to ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_870247] a 20% increase in PBSD (sum of the longest diameter for all target 
lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes at current 
evaluation) taking as reference the MSD (Section 11.41).  In addition, the 
PBSD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 0.5 cm  from the 
MSD.  
c. See Section 11.32 for  details in regards to the requirements for PD via FDG -
PET imaging.  
 
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the MSD.  
 
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions and Non-targe t Lymph Nodes  
 
• Complete Response (CR):  All of the following must be true:

11.45  Symptomatic Deterioration: Patients with global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time, 
and not either related to study treatment or other medical conditions, should be repor ted as 
PD due to “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment due to symptomatic 
deterioration.  A patient is classified as having PD due to “symptomatic deteriorati on” if any 
of the following occur that are not either related to study treatment or other medical 
conditions:  
 
• Weight loss >10% of body weight.  
• Worsening of tumor -related symptoms.  
• Decline in performance status of >[ADDRESS_870248] – Immune Response Criteria  
 
Wolchok et al [34] described  the Immune Response Criteria (IRC)  which was used to 
evalu ate response to nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195176]. The IRC is  derived from the 
WHO criteria and is  character ized by [CONTACT_149439]:  
 
• Objective response is based on the total measurable tumor burden: For the irRC, only 
index and measurable new le sions are taken into account.  
 
• At the baseline tumor assessment, the sum of the products of the two largest 
perpendicular diameters (SPD) of all index lesions (five lesions per organ, up to 10 
visceral lesions and five cutaneous index lesions) is calculate d. At each subsequent 
tumor assessment, the SPD of the index lesions and of new, measurable lesions (≥5 × 
5 mm; up to 5 new lesions per organ: 5 new cutaneous lesions and 10 visceral lesions) 
are added together to provide the total tumor burden:  
 
• Complete response: Disappearance of all lesions in two consecutive observations not 
less than 4 weeks apart.  
• Partial response: ≥  50% decrease in tumor burden compared with baseline in two 
observations at least 4 weeks apart  (within 8 weeks and not less tha n 4 weeks apart) .  
• Stable disease: 50% decrease in tumor burden compared with baseline cannot be 
established nor 25% increase compared with nadir.  
• Progressive disease: At least 25% increase in tumor burden compared with nadir (at 
any single time point) in two consecutive observations at least 4 weeks apart.  
• At each tumor assessment, the response in index and new, measurable lesions is 
defined based on the change in tumor burden (after ruling out PD). Decreases in 
tumor burden must be assessed relative to baseline measurements (i.e., the SPD of all 
index lesions at screening).

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
13.1.1  Background/Overview    
In a study of nivolumab alone, the response rates were 18% in lung cancer, 28% in 
melanoma and 27% in renal -cell cancer (RCC). Over 60% of responders have durable 
responses lasting > 1 year [23], the PFS at 24 weeks was 41% for melanoma, 26% for lung 
cancer and 56% for RCC.  In the phase 1 study, the median duration of therapy was 12 weeks 
(range, 2  to 111), and the objective response rates were: 17% in melanoma, 11% in RCC, 
10% in lung cancer and 5% in ovarian cancer.  Responses > 1 year were reported in 50% of 
patients [35].  In general, there is a paucity of data on PFS at 24 weeks, SD rate and ot her 
survival data from studies involving multiply -treated NPC patients. Data from phase II 2nd 
line studies of cytotoxic agents such as a gemcitabine and capecitabine, reported the SD rate 
to be around 30 -49%, median TTP of 3.6 -5 months, and *PFS at 6 mont hs of around 30 -40% 
(*estimated from the published curves) [36 -38]. The overall response rate (ORR) for 
cytotoxic agents in patients who failed only 1 prior line of chemotherapy is estimated to be 
around 20%, but the response is usually not durable [36 -38]. The problem of using such data 
for this proposal is that nearly all patients from these studies had just 1 prior line of therapy, 
while the current proposal (and also published studies on nivolumab) enrolled patients who 
were more heavily pre -treated.  
 
Therefore, we have decided to use the data from two of our prior phase II studies of targeted 
agents, namely, pazopanib and cetuximab (the latter in combination with carboplatin) for 
calculating the sample size in this proposal because the cohort in these studies are similar to 
the current proposal.  In the pazopanib study, patients had a median of 3 lines of therapy, and 
clinical benefit rate (CBR, PR + SD + CR) at 12 weeks was used to calculate the sample size. 
A CBR of 35% was estimated to be clinically meaningful, and the actual rate reported was > 
50% [39]. The ORR was 6.1%, median TTP was 4.4 months (95% CI: 3.9 –5.8 months) and 
the PFS -6 month was around 30 -35% (read from the curve).  In the cetuximab study [40], 
70% of patients had 1 prior line of che motherapy only.   Although the ORR was 11.7% and 
the CBR rate was 60% (which is higher than the pazopanib study), the median TTP was quite 
short at 2.7 months, and the PFS -6 months was around 20 -30% (read off the curve) [40]. 
Therefore, the average PFS at 2 4 weeks (6 months) is around 25 -30% a benchmark for 
heavily -pretreated NPC patients, with a ORR between 6% to 20%.  
 
NCI Protocol #:9742  
Local Protocol #: MC1471  
Version Date:  January 6, [ADDRESS_870259] shown that the response rate is generally around 5% in this disease 
setting  [39-40].  If Nivolumab can increase the  response rate to 20% or more, that would be 
exciting and worth further study.  This protocol will assess the confirmed response rate as the 
primary endpoint.  In addition this study will assess multiple secondary endpoints, including 
adverse events, tumor  response to nivolumab based on immune -related response criteria 
(IRC), duration of response, progression -free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and 
laboratory correlates.  
 
13.1.[ADDRESS_870260] 4 weeks apart  (within 8 weeks and not less than 4 weeks apart) .   
• For late responders to nivolumab (see section 5.7.1) : Subjects who continue treatment 
beyond first progression (as determined by [CONTACT_649340] -assessed, RECIST 
1.1-defined progression) will be considered to have investigator -assessed ‘progressive 
disease’ at the time of the initial progression even t. However, if they subsequently 
experience a CR or PR,  they may be designated as a ‘delayed responder ’ for the 
purposes of determining ORR and thus, in the final analys is, be counted as a 
‘responder’  for the study . 
 
13.1.3  Statistical Design Overview  
A patient that has a confirmed response is considered a treatment “success”.  The following 
one-stage design with an interim analysis requires a maximum of 35  evaluable patients, and 
simultaneously discriminates between tumor response rates of 5% vs. 20%.   
 
13.1.[ADDRESS_870261] a confirmed tumor response (at least 
11%) among the [ADDRESS_870262] a confirmed tumor response, this agent will 
be considered negative and no further study would be warranted.   
 
Interim Analysis  Decis ion Rule :  Enter [ADDRESS_870263] a confirmed tumor response, the study will continue to full accrual .  
Otherwise, if fewer than 2 confirmed responses are observed, the study will be stopped early 
and the treatment will be considered ineffective in this patient population.   Accrual will 
continue through the interim analysis phase, unless undue toxicity is observed.   
 
13.1.5  Power and Significance Level  
This design has 90% power to detect a true confirmed response rate of 20%, with a 
significance level of 0.09 if the true confirmed response rate is 5%. The likelihood of 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_270478] 1 of enrollment  is 64.5% and 7% if the true confirmed response rate is 5% 
and 20%, respectively.

13.1.6  Over Accrual  
 If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the additional patients will not be 
used to evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_349639].   
 
13.1.7  Other Considerations  
Toxicity, quality/du ration of response, and patterns of treatment failure observed in this 
study, as well as scientific discoveries or changes in standard care will be taken into account 
in any decision to terminate the study.  
 
13.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
13.2. [ADDRESS_870264] 6 months.   
 
13.3 Stratification Factors  and Subset Analyse s for Primary Endpoint  
Since the study is not randomized, there are no stratification factors for ran domization 
purposes.  In an exploratory analyses, response rates will also be summarized in the 
following subsets:  PD-L1, PD -L2, PD -1 and PD -1 IHC expression level s (positive vs. 
negative expression), number of line s of prior chemotherapy for metastatic o r recurrent NPC 
(1 or > 1 line), and prior exposure to EBV vaccines.  
 
13.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
This study will assess multiple secondary endpoints, including adverse events, tumor 
response to nivolumab based on immune -related response criteria (IRC), duration of 
response, progression -free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and laboratory correlates.  
The analysis population for these endpoints will be the same as that for the primary endpoint 
– i.e., all patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form and have 
begun treatment.  
 
13.4.[ADDRESS_870265] initiated treatment will be considered evaluable for assessing adverse 
events. The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, 
and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine adverse event patt erns.  Only the severe 
or worse adverse events will be assessed, regardless of relationship to the study treatment.  In 
addition, the  following adverse events will be captured  and followed over time : pneumonitis, 
endocrinopathy, infusion -related reactio ns, diarrhea, skin events [23].

13.4.2 Immune -Related R esponse  
Tumor response to nivolumab based on immune -related response criteria (IRC) will also be 
assessed.  Responses will be summarized descriptively using frequencies and percentages.  
See section [ADDRESS_870266] achieved an objective response as the date at 
which the patient’s objective status is first noted to be either a CR or PR to the date 
progression is documented for both response criteria (RECIST 1.1 and IRC).   
 
13.4.4 Progression -Free Survival (PFS)  
Defined as the time from registration to the first of either death due to any cause or 
progression.  The distribution of PFS will be estimated using the method of Kaplan -Meier  
[46].  
 
13.4.5 Overall Survival  
Defined a s the time from registration to death due to any cause.  The distribution of survival 
time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan -Meier [ 46Special attention will be paid to 
any registered patient who dies early (i.e., within 60 days) of initiating their treatment.  
Circumstances surrounding such early deaths will be classified as being either due to 
malignant disease, toxicity, other causes, or of unknown reasons.

of nivolumab on tumor burden by [CONTACT_649347] -Barr virus 
(EBV) DNA during the first 4 -6 weeks of treatment.  In addition, we will investigate the 
association between treatment outcome and the following immunological markers: 
Intratumoral expression of PD -[ADDRESS_870268] -treatment , expression of PD -1 in CD8+ T cells in 
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL)  at baseline.   Plasma EBV DNA half -life during the first 
[ADDRESS_870269] -response to nivolumab . 
The Chi -Square (or Fisher’s Exact test) will be used to assess the association of categorical 
clinical data with categorical biomarker data.  Time -to-event clinical data (PFS, OS) will be 
correlated with biomarker data  using Kaplan -Meier methodology and Cox regression models.  
Logistic regression models will also be used to predict binary clinical data with baseline 
biomarker data.  Finally, graphical methods and descriptive statistics will be used to 
summarize the data  as well.  Two -sided p -values < 0.05 will be conside red statistically 
significant. For the functional MRI parameters, graphical methods and descriptive statistics 
will be used to assess the changes in these parameters over time.  In addition, we will 
deter mine the associations between the MRI parameters and clinical endpoints like response 
and survival.

14. STUDY STATUS UPDATES  AND  STUDY CLOSURE  
 
14.1 Definitions of Study Status Changes  
 
14.1.1  Temporarily Closed to Accrual  
 
The study status is Temporarily Closed to Accrual when no patient slots are currently 
available, but there is the possibility that the trial will re -open for accrual (patient slots 
become available).  Sites are not permitted to accrue additional patients until CTEP is 
notified of Re -Activation.  
 
Study status will need to be changed to Temporarily Closed to Accrual when any of the 
following criteria are met:  
 
• Sites are notified by [CONTACT_472] (via Request for Rapid Amendment [RRA]) of changes in 
the risk/benefit ratio that necessitate changes to the patient Informed Consent 
document.  Requested changes will be specified in the RRA and must  be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_1758]’s IRB.  
• CTEP a nd the lead investigator agree that unacceptable toxicities necessitate a 
discussion to change the dosing/regimen.  
• A protocol -defined benchmark has been achieved (such as an interim analysis before  
proceeding to the next stage).  
• Investigators encounter any  of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_131956] 5.3. 
 
14.1.[ADDRESS_870273] one patient is still actively receiving the study treatment.  Sites a re no 
longer permitted to enroll additional patients.  Racial 
Categories:  American Indian or Alaskan Native – a person having origins in any of the 
original peoples of North, Central, or South America, and who maintains tribal 
affiliations or community attachment.  
Asian – a person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, 
Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, 
China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippi[INVESTIGATOR_31922], Thailand, 
and Vietnam. (Note: Individuals from the Philippi[INVESTIGATOR_649329] i n previous data collection strategies.)  
Black or African American – a person having origins in any of the black racial 
groups of Africa. Terms such as “Haitian” or “Negro” can be used in addition to 
“Black or African American.”  
Native Hawaiian or other Pa cific Islander – a person having origins in any of 
the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.  
White – a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the 
Middle East, or North Africa.

Patient slots are no longer available when the following criteria are met:  
 
• The pre -specified number of evaluable patients has been successfully enrolled, 
treated, and evaluated.  
• The study treatment has failed to meet the pre -specified efficacy goal at the stage 1 
interim analysis.  
• CTEP and the investigators agree that unacceptable toxicities preclude further 
enrollment.  
• Investigators encounter any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_649330] 5.3. 
 
14.1.3  Closed to Accrual and Treatment  
 
The study status is Closed to Accrual and Treatment when no more patient enrollment slots 
are available and no patients are currently receiving the study treatment.  Patients may still be 
enrolled on the protocol only for the purposes of follow -up. 
 
Patient accrual and treatment will be permanently halted when any of the following criteria 
are met:  
 
• Enrollment was previously closed (study status of “Closed to Accrual”), and no 
patients are receiving the study treatment.  
• CTEP and the investigators agree that unacceptable toxicities preclude further 
enrollment.  In this case, CTEP and the investigators must collab orate to alter the 
regimen or to halt the study treatment altogether as soon as it can be safely done for 
patients currently receiving treatment.  
 
CTEP and Theradex must be notified  when patients are no longer receiving treatment [i.e., 
when the last pati ent(s) to be receiving treatment is/are no longer receiving the study regimen 
for any reason].  
 
14.1.[ADDRESS_870274] no t been removed from the study 
for other reasons.  That is, there are no outstanding follow -up procedures to be performed as 
mandated by [CONTACT_760].  
 
CTEP does not need to be notified of a status change to “Closed to Follow Up.”

APPENDIX D : CARD FOR STUDY PARTI CIPANTS  
 
Information on Possible Interactions with Other Agents for Patients and Their Caregivers 
and Non -Study Healthcare Team  
 
The patient ____________________________ is enrolled on a clinical trial using nivolumab.  
This clinical trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_29630].  This form is addressed to the 
patient, but includes important information for others who care for this patient.  
 
Although nivolumab is not expected to interact with drugs that are processed b y your liver, it is 
still very important to tell your study doctors about all of your medicine before you start this 
study.  It is also very important to tell them if you stop taking any regular medicine, or if you 
start taking a new medicine while you tak e part in this study.  When you talk about your 
medicine with your study doctor, include medicine you buy without a prescription at the drug 
store (over -the-counter remedy), or herbal supplements.  
Many health care prescribers can write prescriptions.  You  must also tell your other prescribers 
(doctors, physicians’ assistants or nurse practitioners) that you are taking part in a clinical trial. 
Bring this paper with you and keep the attached information card in your wallet .   
 
These are the things that you and they need to know:  
• You should check with your doctor or pharmacist whenever you need to use an over -the-
counter medicine or herbal supplement.  
• Your regular prescriber should check a medical reference or call your study doctor before 
prescribing any n ew medicine for you.  Your study doctor’s name [CONTACT_832]: _________________

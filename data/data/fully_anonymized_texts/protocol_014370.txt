BACKGROUND  
 2.1 
Study Disease(s)  
 Approximately 5- 8% of patients with cancer develop leptomeningeal carcinomatosis
1. While 
virtually any malignancy can metastasize to the leptomeninges, this most commonly occurs with lung cancer, br east cancer and melanoma. Approximately 5 -7% of patients with melanoma 
develop leptomeningeal carcinomatosis and there seems to be an association with the presence of parenchymal brain metastases and the development of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis
2. As 
patients with cancer survive longer and diagnostic imaging techniques improve, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is being diagnosed more frequently.  Patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_817823], cranial nerve palsies, seizures, stroke- like symptoms,

 encephalopathy, radiculopathies and cauda equina syndrome1. The median survival of patients 
with leptomeningeal metastases without treatment is approximately 4 -6 weeks. Death usually 
results from rapid progressive neurologic deterioration. Treatment involves radiation to 
symptomatic sites of the neuraxis and to s ites of bulk disease seen on imaging studies. 
Systemically administered chemotherapy has limited access to the CSF due to the blood -brain 
barrier. Intrathecal chemotherapy is designed to treat tumor cells floating in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF), thereby [CONTACT_817900]; however treatment -related toxicities of intrathecal chemotherapy are common, and include chemical 
meningitis, seizures and severe headaches
3. Radiother apy and intrathecal chemotherapy provide 
local control and may extend median survival of patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis to 3-6 months

 2.2 IND Agents  
 
2.2.1 Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_140] (BMS -734016, MDX010, MDX -CTLA 4) is a fully human monoclonal 
immunoglobulin (Ig) G1κ specific for human cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA- 4, 
CD152), which is expressed on a subset of activated T cells. CTLA -4 is a negative regulator of 
T-cell activity. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_142] a monoclonal a ntibody that binds to CTLA -4 and blocks the 
interaction of CTLA -4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA -4 has been shown to 
augment T -cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor 
infiltrating T -effector cel ls. Inhibition of CTLA -4 signaling can also reduce T -regulatory cell 
function, which may contribute to a general increase in T -cell responsiveness, including the anti -
tumor response. Yervoy  (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) has been approved for use in over 47 countries including 
the [LOCATION_002] (US, Mar -2011), the European Union (EU, Jul-2011), and Australia (Jul-2011). 
 Nonclinical Studies   
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817825] a high affinity for human CTLA -4. The calculated dissociation 
constant value from an average of several  studies was 5.25 nM. Binding of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482454], recombinant human CTLA -4 antigen was als o demonstrated by [CONTACT_28745] -linked 
immunosorbent assay with half -maximal binding at 15 ng/mL, whereas saturation was obse rved 
at approximately 0.1 µg/mL. No cross -reactivity was observed against human CD28. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482455] B7.1 and B7.2 to human CTLA -4 at concentrations higher than 6 
µg/mL and 1 µg/mL, respectively.  
 Effects in Humans  
Bristol- Myers Squibb (BMS) and Medarex, Inc. (MDX, acquired by [CONTACT_482537]- 2009) have co-
sponsored an extensive clinical development program for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], encompassing more than 19,500 subjects (total number of subjects enrolled in ipi[INVESTIGATOR_229]) in several canc er types 
in completed and ongoing studies, as well as a compassionate use program. The focus of the 
clinical program is in melanoma, prostate cancer, and lung cancer, with advanced melanoma being the most comprehensively studied indication. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_323350], radiation therapy, and other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Phase 3 programs are ongoing in melanoma, prostate cancer, and

 lung cancer. In melanoma, 2 completed Phase 3 studies (MDX010- 20 and CA184024) have 
demo nstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant survival benefit in pretreated 
advanced melanoma and previously untreated advanced melanoma, respectively. The safety 
profile of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525152] a) the majority adverse events (AEs) being inflammatory in nature consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], b) the same types of such immune -mediated events in the gastrointestinal  (GI) tract, 
skin, liver, and endocrine system being repor ted, an d c) most of these events being manageable 
with immune suppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  In melanoma, 2 BMS -sponsored Phase 3 studies are ongoing in subjects with high- risk Stage III 
melanoma (CA184029, with adjuvant immunotherapy) and pretreated and treatment-naïve advanced melanoma (CA184169, 3 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]). The completed Phase 3 
study CA184043 evaluated ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817826] -resistant prostate 
cancer (mCRPC) who had progressed during or following docetaxel. E ligible subjects were 
randomized to a single dose of bone -directed radiotherapy (RT), followed by [CONTACT_525263][INVESTIGATOR_125] 
10 mg/kg or placebo (799 randomized: 399 ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], 400 placebo). This  study did not meet 
its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS). The hazard ratio (HR) of 0.85 (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.72 to 1.00) for survival favored ipi[INVESTIGATOR_525154] a P -value of 0.053. Planned sensitivity analyses favored ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], where the 
greatest benefit appeared to be in subgroups defined by [CONTACT_817901]. Additional evidence of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817827] a reduced 
risk of disease progression relative to placebo (HR = 0.70) and superior  clinical outcomes 
compared to placebo in tumor regression and declines in prostate specific  antigen (PSA). The 
safety profile in this study was consistent with the previously defined AE  profile at the same 
dose.  A second Phase 3 study CA184095 evaluating ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 m g/kg versus placebo in men with  
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, chemotherapy -naïve mCRPC with no visceral  
metastases has completed enrollment and is currently in follow -up. In addition, a completed 
large Phase 2 study (CA184041) has investigated the  addition of  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817828] 2 different schedules (concurrent and phased) in subjects with non- small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) or small cell lung cancer (SCLC, a secondary  endpoint). Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], 
given in combination with pacl itaxel/carboplatin in a  phased schedule improved irPFS compared 
to the control treatment, but no improvement was  seen when ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817829] a 
concurrent schedule. Phased ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817830] a trend for improved OS. The efficacy and safety of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62607] a phased schedule 
with carboplatin/paclitaxel is also  being investigated in an ongoing Phase 3 study in subjects 
with advanced squamous NSCLC  (CA184104). The efficacy and safety of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_62607] a 
phase d schedule with  etoposide/platinum in subjects with extensive stage disease SCLC is being 
investigated in an  ongoing Phase 3 study (CA184156). 
 The unique immune -based mechanism of action is reflected in the clinical patterns of anti- cancer 
activity in some patients. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817831], and measurable clinical  
effects emerge after the immunological effects. Tumor infiltration with lymphocytes and the  
associated inflammation (documented by [CONTACT_396]) is likely the cornerstone of the effect of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817832] #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-136 
Protocol Version Date:   January 24, [ADDRESS_1132505] tumor assessment in a manner seen in patients  
receiving other types of anti -cancer treatments. In other cases, response may be preceded by [CONTACT_817902]/or the appearance of new lesions, which may be  
mistaken for tumor progression on radiological evaluations. Therefore, in patients who are not  
experiencing rapid clinical deterioration, confirmation of progression is recommended, at the  
investigator’s discretion, to better understand the prognosis as  well as to avoid unnecessarily 
initiating potentially toxic alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_817833]. Immune -related response criteria were developed based on these observations to  
systematically categorize novel patterns of clinical activity and are currently b eing prospectively  
evaluated in clinical studies.  In metastatic diseases, stabilization is more common than response, 
and in some instances is  associated with a slow, steady decline in tumor burden over many 
months, sometimes improving  to partial and/or complete responses. Thus, the immune -based 
mechanism of action of  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_665325], sometimes with novel 
patterns of response, which contribute to its unique improvement in OS.  
 The unique immune -based mechanism of action is also reflected in the safety profile. The most  
common treatment- related AEs are inflammatory in nature, consistent with the mechanism of 
action of the drug and generally medically manageable with topi[INVESTIGATOR_199]/or systemic immunosuppressants. Such immunological safety events are described as immune- related  
adverse events (irAEs) or immune- mediated adverse reactions (imARs). The irAEs are described  
as AEs of unknown etiology, which were consistent with an immune phenomenon and were considered causally related to d rug exposure by [CONTACT_431]. The irAEs primarily involve the  
GI tract and skin. Immune -related AEs in the liver were also observed, particularly in subjects  
receiving 10 mg/kg. Endocrinopathy and neuropathy were important irAEs observed less  
frequently. The imARs were adjudicated in a blinded fashion based on sponsor -physician data  
review to exclude noninflammatory etiologies, such as infection or tumor progression, and to consider available evidence of inflammation, such as tumor biopsies or responsivene ss to  
steroids, in an effort to determine whether specific AEs or abnormal hepatic laboratory values  
were likely to be immune mediated and associated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45777].  The early 
diagnosis of inflammatory events is important to initiate therapy and  minimize  complications. 
Inflammatory events are generally manageable using symptomatic or  immuno -suppressive 
therapy as recommended through detailed diagnosis and management guidelines.  A program -wide independent Data Monitoring Commit tee (DMC) reviews data from the 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_229], allowing for an ongoing safety and benefit/risk assessment in subjects  
receiving ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. The DMC charter includes explicit stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_817834],  
allowing the DMC to recommend discontinuing further treatment across the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817835], if necessary. In summary, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817836] (as 3 mg/kg monotherapy compared to the melanoma peptide vaccine gp 100) and previously untreated 
advanced melanoma (at 10 mg/kg in combination with dacarbazine [DTIC] compared to DTIC alone), and evidence of clinical activity in randomized studies in other tumor types. These findings, together with evidence of a safety pr ofile that is manageable with careful monitoring 
and appropriate intervention for treatment of immune -related toxicities, suggest an acceptable 
benefit to risk ratio.

2.2.2 Nivolumab 
Nivolumab (also referred to as BMS -936558 or MDX1106) is a fully human monoclonal 
antibody (HuMAb; immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4] -S228P) that targets the programmed death-1 
(PD-1) cluster of differentiation 279 (CD279) cell surface membrane receptor. PD-1 is a negative 
regulatory molecule expressed by [CONTACT_93247] T and B lymphocytes. Bindin g of PD -1 to its ligands, 
programmed death–ligands 1 (PD -L1) and 2 (PD -L2), results in the down- regulation of 
lymphocyte activation. Inhibition of the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands promotes 
immune responses and antigen- specific T -cell responses to both foreign antigens as well as self -
antigens. Nivolumab is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and is produced using 
standard mammalian cell cultivation and chromatographic purification technologies. The clinical study product is a sterile solution for parenteral administration  (Nivolumab Investigator 
Brochure) . 
 Nonclinical Studies  
Nivolumab has been shown to bind specifically to the human PD -1 receptor and not to related  
members of the CD28 family, such as CD28 inducible co-stimulator (ICO S), cytotoxic T 
lymphocyte antigen- 4 (CTLA -4), and B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA). Nivolumab 
inhibits the interaction of PD -1 with its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2, resulting in enhanced T -cell 
proliferation and interferon- gamma (IFN -γ) release in vitro.  Fluorescent -activated cell sorter  
(FACS) analysis confirmed that nivolumab binds to transfected CHO and activated human T-cells expressing cell surface PD -1 and to cynomolgus monkey PD -1, but not to rat or rabbit  PD-1 
molecules.  Nivolumab has also been shown to bind to PD -1 on virus -specific CD8+ T- cells from 
chronically infected hepatitis C virus patients. PD-1 inhibition in a mixed lymphocyte reaction 
(MLR) resulted in a reproducible  concentration -dependent enhancement of IFN -γ release in the 
MLR up to 50 g/mL. No effect was observed with a human IgG4 isotype control or CD4+ T cells and dendritic cell (DC) controls.  In intravenous (IV) repeat-dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, nivolumab was well tolerated at doses up to 50 mg/kg, administered weekly for 5 weeks, and at doses up to 50 mg/kg, 
administered twice weekly for 27 doses. Nivolumab- related findings were limited to a reversible  
decrease of 28% in triiodothyronine (T3) among the females administered 27 doses of 50 mg/kg.  
No corresponding changes in the level of thyroxin (T4), thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH), or  
histologic changes in the thyroid were observed. While nivolumab alone was well tolerated  in 
cynomolgus monkeys, combination studies have highlighted the potential for enhanced  toxicity 
when combined with other immunostimulatory agents.  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (BMS -734016), an anti -CTLA -4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that blocks the down-
regulation of T -cell activation, was used in combination with nivolumab to invest igate the effects 
of concurrent inhibition of the PD -1 and CTLA -4 receptors in nonhuman primates. Although 
gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity has not been observed in cynomolgus monkeys treated with nivolumab alone, dose -dependent GI toxicity was evident in cynomolgus monkeys treated 
weekly for 4 weeks with a combination of nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_162541] 10 and 3 mg/kg and 50 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. GI effects have also been observed at a low incidence after ipi[INVESTIGATOR_288].13 Two 4 -week toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys were 
conducted with 2 anti -lymphocyte- activation gene 3 (LAG -3) mAbs that inhibit the function of

12 
 LAG -3 on the surface of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The combination of nivolumab + 
MDX1408 was clinically well tolerated up to 50 mg/kg MDX1408 and 50 mg/kg nivolumab 
with findings limited to nonadverse and pharmacologically -mediated changes in the peripheral 
blood and lymphoid tissues, including increases in CD4+ T lymphocytes expressing CD25. However, the combination of 50 mg/kg nivolumab + 100mg/kg BMS -986016, administered once 
weekly, was associated with moribundity (1 of 10 animals) attributed to central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis. Findings in surviving monkeys administered nivolumab alone or in combination with BMS -986016 were limited to minimal inflammation of the choroid plexus or 
vasculature of the brain parenchyma (1 male in the combination group), without evidence of other degenerative changes. These findings, which were observed at nivolumab exposures  that 
were approximately 13 × greater than those observed in humans at 3 mg/kg, every 2 weeks 
(Q2W), are consistent with an expected immunostimulatory pharmacologic effect of nivolumab and highlight the potential synergistic roles of PD -1 and LAG -3 in maint aining self -tolerance. In 
addition, an enhanced pre - and postnatal development (ePPND) study in pregnant cynomolgus 
monkeys with nivolumab was conducted. Administration of nivolumab at up to 50 mg/kg 2QW was well tolerated by [CONTACT_162621]; however, nivolumab was determined to be a selective 
developmental toxicant when administered from the period of organogenesis to parturition at ≥ 
10 mg/kg (area under the concentration- time curve [AUC] from time zero to 168 hours [AUC(0 -
168 h)] 117,000 µg•h/mL). Speci fically, increased developmental mortality (including late 
gestational fetal losses and extreme prematurity with associated neonatal mortality) was noted in 
the absence of overt maternal toxicity. There were no nivolumab- related changes in surviving 
infant s tested throughout the 6- month postnatal period. Although the cause of these pregnancy 
failures was undetermined, nivolumab- related effects on pregnancy maintenance are consistent 
with the established role of PD- L1 in maintaining fetomaternal tolerance in  mice.  
 Effects in Humans   
The PK, clinical activity, and safety of nivolumab have been assessed in completed Phase 1 and ongoing Phase 2 and 3 studies sponsored by [CONTACT_414] -Myers Squibb Company (BMS) in subjects 
with non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mel anoma, and clear -cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 
in addition to other  tumor types. The current Phase 3 clinical program focuses on squamous and 
nonsquamous NSCLC, malignant melanoma, and RCC. Clinical activity and safety information 
presented in this Investigator Brochure (IB) focuses primarily on that obtaine d from CA209063 
(Phase 2 study in refractory squamous NSCLC), CA209037 (Phase 3 study in melanoma), 
MDX1106-03 (also known as CA209003; Phase 1 study in metastatic NSCLC, colorectal cancer 
(CRC), melan oma, RCC, or metastatic castrate -resistant prostate cancer [mCRPC]), CA209010   
(Phase 2 study in advanced/metastatic clear -cell RCC). Data are also provided from Phase 1 
studies CA209004 (also known as MDX1106 -04), CA209012, CA209016, CA209038, and 
CA209039. Nivolumab is being investigated both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy, targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   The single -dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of nivolumab was linear and dose -proportional in the 
range of 0.3 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg. The multiple -dose PK of nivolumab was linear with dose -
proportional increases in maximum serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration -time curve over the dosing interval (AUC[TAU]) in the range of 0.1 mg/kg to 10 
mg/kg. Both elimina tion and distribution of nivolumab in the dose range studied appear to be 
independent of dose in the dose -ranging studies, while the end of infusion and minimum serum

 concentration (Cmin) after the first dose were approximately dose proportional. Based on 
population PK (PPK) results (preliminary data), clearance of nivolumab is independent of dose in the dose range (0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg) and tumor types studied. Body weight normalized dosing showed approximately constant trough concentrations over a wide range of body weights and, therefore, is appropriate for future clinical trials with nivolumab.   Nivolumab has demonstrated clinical activity as monotherapy and as combination therapy with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_778444], including RCC, melanoma, NSCLC, and some lymphomas. The majority of responses were durable and exceeded 6 months.  The overall safety experience with nivolumab, as a monotherapy or in combination with other therapeutics, is based on experience in approximately 4,000 subjects treated to date. For monotherapy, the safety profile is similar across tumor types. The only exception is pulmonary inflammation adverse events (AEs), which may be numerically greater in subjects with NSCLC, because in some cases, it can be difficult to distinguish between nivolumab- related and unrelated 
causes of pulmonary symptoms and radiographic changes. There is no pattern in the incidence, severity, or causality of AEs to nivolumab dose level. In several ongoing clinical trials, the safety of nivolumab in combina tion with other therapeutics such as ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, anti -angiogenics, and targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_162544]. Most studies are 
ongoing and, as such, the safety profile of nivolumab combinations continues to evolve. The most advanced combination under development is nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817837]. Thus far, the combination of both agents results in a safety profile with similar types of AEs as either agent alone, but in some cases with a greater frequency.  
 
2.2.3 Nivolumab combined with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817838] -1 and CTLA -4 receptor blockade may  
improve antitumor activity. In vitro combinations of nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_179450] -γ 
production 2- to 7- fold over eit her agent alone in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Increased  
antitumor activity of the combination was also observed in 3 of 5 syngeneic murine cancer  
models. In a murine melanoma vaccine model, blockade with either CTLA -4 or PD -1 antibodies  
increased the pro portion of CTLA -4 and PD -1-expressing CD4/CD8 tumor infiltrating T effector  
cells and dual blockade increased tumor infiltration of T effector cells and decreased  
intratumoral T regulatory cells, as compared to either agent alone.   Preclinically, a 4 -week  toxicity study of nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817839] -dependent gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Histologic findings included  inflammatory 
changes in the large intestine, which increased in incidence and severity in a dosedependent  
manner. GI toxicity/colitis was not observed in cynomolgus monkeys administered nivolumab alone, but was observed in monkeys receiving ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Nivolumab in combi nation with

each arm in this multi- arm study, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460527] 3 weeks for 4 doses 
with nivolumab administered once every 3 weeks for 8 doses. Starting at week 24, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251369] 12 weeks for 8 doses. The three initial dose escalation cohorts consisted of Cohort 1 (nivolumab 0.3 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg; n = 14), Cohort 2 (nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg; n = 17) and Cohort 3 (nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg; n = 6). Later, the study was amended to include Cohort 2a which evaluated nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg (n = 16) and Cohort 8 that represents an additional cohort of patients treated with nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg The maintenance regimen for Cohorts 1- 3 consisted of nivolumab q3 weeks x 4 then 
nivolumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] q12 weeks x 8, while the maintenance regimen for Cohort 8 consisted of nivolumab 3 mg/kg q2 weeks until progression. The following dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed in Cohort [ADDRESS_1132507]/ALT ([ADDRESS_1132508]); in Cohort 
2 - Grade 3 uveitis ([ADDRESS_1132509]) and Grade [ADDRESS_1132510]/ALT ([ADDRESS_1132511]) and in Cohort 3 Grade 
4 elevated lipase (2 subjects) and Grade 3 elevated lipase ([ADDRESS_1132512]). Based on these data, Cohort 2 was identified as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and Cohort 3 exceeded the MTD. Among the 53 patients in the concurrent -regimen group, adverse events of any grade, regardless 
of whether they were attr ibuted to the therapy, were observed in 98% of patients. 
 Treatment -related adverse events of any grade were reported in 96.2% of patients, in pooled 
Cohorts 1- 3 and 95.1% of Cohort 8. The drug -related skin select AE category was the most 
frequently report ed category in all cohorts; rash and pruritus were the most frequently reported 
drug- related AEs in all cohorts. The most frequently reported drug -related AEs of any grade 
were rash (62.3%, Cohorts 1- 3; 58.5%, Cohort 8), pruritus (56.6%, Cohorts 1- 3; 46.3%  Cohort

(20.8%, Cohorts 1- 3; 12.2%, Cohort 8). The only reported drug -related AE belonging to the 
pulmonary select AE category was pneumonitis; 3 (5.7%) subjects in Cohorts 1 to 3 and 1 (2.4%) subject in Cohort 8. Grade 3- [ADDRESS_1132513] each in Cohort 2a and 
Cohort 8. Treatment -related SAEs of any grade were reported in 58.5% of patients on pooled 
Cohorts 1- 3 and 41.5 % of Cohort 8. The most frequently reported SAE in ≥ 5% subjects 
included: ALT increased, AST increased, lipase increased, colitis, diarrhea, amylase increased, pneumonitis, and pyrexia. A total of 13 subjects (24.5%) in Cohorts 1- 3 and 9 subjects (22.0%) 
in Cohort [ADDRESS_1132514] died due to drug -related

decade with the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting cytotoxic T -lymphocyte 
antigen 4 (CTLA4) and the  programmed death 1 (PD1) receptor -ligand (PDL1, PDL2) 
interaction, as well as the development of small molecule inhibitors. These advances have led to the regulatory approval of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], nivolumab, and pembrolizumab
5-10. More recently, the 
combination of the anti -CTLA4 antibody ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817842] -PD1 antibody nivolumab has 
been associated with deep responses in half of treated patients11. In addition to these advances, 
previously “untreatable” patient cohorts, such as those with brain metastases, have been evaluated in dedicated clinical trials. In fact, both ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817843] -agent central nervous system (CNS) effects, leading to a remarkable loosening of

 retrospective study demonstrated that patients with brain metastases receiving the combination of 
nivolumab and stereotactic radiation had improved survival compared to surgery and/or radiation alone
15. An ongoing study by [CONTACT_817903].13,14 showed that pembrolizumab is well 
tolerated and has promising activity in patients with asymptomatic brain metastases from melanoma and non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Of 12 evaluable patients with melanoma 
brain metastases, partial responses wer e observed in 3 patients and stable disease in 2 patients
14. 
Of 9 evaluable patients with brain metastases from nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) , partial 
responses were observed in 4 patients13. Now, early phase trials often allow patients with 
asymptomatic and untreated metastases to enroll, and nearly all therapi[INVESTIGATOR_817845].  
 As astounding as these developments are, there remains one group of patients who remain ineligible for virtually every therapeutic trial, those with leptomeningeal disease (LMD). While any malignancy can metastasize to the leptomeninges, this most commonly occurs with lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma. Approximately 5- 8% of patients with cancer develop 
leptomeningeal carcinomatosis
1. As visceral metastatic disease is better controlled and patients 
are surviving longer, LMD is being diagnosed more  frequently. The median survival of patients 
with LMD without treatment is dismal, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 4 -6 weeks. Novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_817846]. The absence of effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and more importantly, access to treatment as part of clinical trials is a great unmet need in cancer.  
 A recent study demonstrated that ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817847]; however and not surprisingly, patients with LMD w ere excluded from this study. In our 
experience at [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH) Cancer Center, we have observed [ADDRESS_1132520] received ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Moreover there was one published report of describing a patient with

Our groups have performed studies of the immune characteristics of the tumor microenvironment before and after checkpoint blockade. To date, there have been no descriptions of the CSF/LM tumor microenvironment in LMD, either unperturbed or after immunotherapy. We will be collecting 
CSF from every pati ent in this study. Lumbar punctures are part of standard of care in patients 
with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Serial CSF samples will give us the opportunity to study tumor evolution over the course of treatment with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45762]. Here we wi ll 
perform unbiased transcriptome sequencing of purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and CD11b+ myeloid cells from the CSF to define the effects of immunotherapy on LMD in the patients described above. We will also evaluate expression of cytokines and other prot eins in the CSF to 
further examine how checkpoint blockade alters the CSF/LM microenvironment. In parallel, we will purify the same immune cell types from paired PBMC samples for comparative transcriptomic analyses and collect sera for comparative cytokine/proteomic analyses with CSF. These comparative analyses should identify if there are alterations in the blood that reflect the biology of the CSF/LM microenvironment and can serve as biomarkers.  3.

Management Algorithms for Immu no-Oncology Agents 
Immuno- oncology (I -O) agents are associated with adverse events that can differ in severity and 
duration than adverse events caused by [CONTACT_20451]. Nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482510]- oncology agents in this protocol. Management algorithms have been 
developed to assist investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of adverse events: Gastrointestinal, Renal, Pulmonary, Hepatic, Endocrinopathies, Skin, and Neurological.  
Early recognition and intervention are recommended according to the management algorithms; 
and in addition include ophthalmologic evaluations for any visual symptoms in order to evaluate 
for nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_114571].  
The recommendations are to follow the algorithms in th e nivolumab investigator brochure for 
immune related events; while the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_482511],  the algorithms in the nivolumab brochure have been aligned to accommodate combinations as well as nivolumab monotherapy.   
For subjects expected who require more than 4 weeks of corticosteroids or other 
immunosuppressants to manage an adverse event, consider the following recommendations  
• Antimicrobial/antifungal prophylaxis per institutional guidelines to prevent opportunist ic 
infections such as Pneumocystis jiroveci and fungal infections. 
• Early consultation with an infectious disease specialist should be considered. Depending on the presentation, consultation with a pulmonologist for bronchoscopy or a gastroenterologist for endoscopy may also be appropriate. 
• In patients who develop recurrent adverse events in the setting of ongoing or prior 
immunosuppressant use, an opportunistic infection should be considered in the 
differential diagnosis.  
Additional details on the safety of  nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] , including results from clinical 
studies, are available in the IB.  
Dose Delay Criteria  
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-136 
Protocol Version Date:   January 24, [ADDRESS_1132553] been developed for suspected 
AEs of selected categories. [see current Investigator Brochure for citation examples]  
Dose delay criteria apply for all drug- related adverse events (regardless of whether or not the 
event is attributed to nivolumab, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143793]). All study drugs must be delayed until 
treatment can resume.  
Nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102326]: 
• Any Grade ≥  2 non-skin, drug-related adverse event, with the following exceptions: 
o Grade 2 drug -related fatigue or laboratory abnormalities do not require a 
treatment delay  
• Any Grade 3 skin, drug- related adverse event  
• Any Grade [ADDRESS_1132554], ALT, or total bilirubin:  
o Grade [ADDRESS_1132555], ALT, or total bilirubin that is within normal limits, delay dosing for drug -related Grade ≥   [ADDRESS_1132556], ALT, or total bilirubin within the Grade 1 toxicity range, delay dosing for drug- related Grade ≥   3 toxicity  
• Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment 
of the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication. 
Criteria to Resume Treatment  
Subjects may resume treatment with study drug when the drug -related AE(s) resolve to Grade ≤1 
or baseline value, with the following exceptions: 
• Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigue  
• Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug -related skin AE may resume 
treatme nt in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity  
• Subjects with baseline Grade [ADDRESS_1132557]/ALT or total bilirubin who require dose delays for 
reasons other than a [ADDRESS_1132558]/ALT or total bilirubin may resume treatment in 
the presence of Grade [ADDRESS_1132559]/ALT OR t otal bilirubin  
• Subjects with combined Grade [ADDRESS_1132560]/ALT AND total bilirubin values meeting 
discontinuation parameters should have treatment permanently discontinued 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-136 
Protocol Version Date:   January 24, 2019  
 
28 
 • Drug -related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis, must have resolved to baseline 
before treatment is resumed  
• Drug -related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone 
replacement may resume treatment  
If the criteria to resume treatment are met, the subject should restart treatment at the next 
scheduled timepoint per protocol. However, if the treatment is delayed past the next scheduled 
timepoint per protocol, the next scheduled timepoint will be delayed until dosing resumes. If 
treatment is delayed > [ADDRESS_1132561] be permanently discontinued from study 
therapy, except as specified in discontinuation section. 
Discontinuation Criteria  
Treatment should be permanently discontinued for the following: 
• Any Grade 2 drug -related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision that does not respond to 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_20308] 1 severity within the re -treatment period 
OR requires systemic treatment  
• Any Grade 3 non- skin, drug- related adverse event lasting > 7 days, with the following 
exceptions for drug- related laboratory abnormalities, uveitis, pneumonitis, 
bronchospasm, diarrhea, colitis, neurologic adverse event, hypersensitivity reactions, and 
infusion reactions 
o Grade 3 drug -related uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, colitis, neurologic 
adverse event, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion reaction of any duration 
requires discontinuation 
o Grade 3 drug -related laboratory abnormalities do not require treatment 
discontinuation except those noted below 
• Grade 3 drug- related thrombocytopenia > 7 days or associated with bleeding 
requires discontinuation 
• Any drug -related liver function test (LFT) abnormality that meets the 
following criteria require discontinuation:  
• AST or ALT > [ADDRESS_1132562]   
• Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_1132563] 
• Concurrent AST or ALT > [ADDRESS_1132564] and total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_1132565] 
• Any Grade 4 drug -related adverse ev ent or laboratory abnormality, except for the 
following events which do not require discontinuation: 
• Isolated Grade 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities that are not associated with 
symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis and decrease to < Grade 4  
within 1 week of onset.  
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-136 
Protocol Version Date:   January 24, 2019  
 
29 
 • Isolated Grade 4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalities that are not associated with 
clinical sequelae and are corrected with supplementation/appropriate management within 72 hours of their onset 
• Any dosing interruption lasting > 6 weeks with the following exceptions: 
• Dosing interruptions to allow for prolonged steroid tapers to manage drug -related 
adverse events are allowed. Prior to re -initiating treatment in a subject with a 
dosing interruption lasting > [ADDRESS_1132566] be consulted. Tumor assessments should continue as per protocol even if dosing is interrupted 
• Dosing interruptions > [ADDRESS_1132567] with a dosing interruption lasting > [ADDRESS_1132568] be consulted. Tumor assessments should continue as per protocol even if dosing is 
interrupted 
• Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the 
judgm ent of the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject with 
continued nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817853], it is 
unlikely to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitivity reactions. However, if such a reaction were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritis, 
arthralgias, hypo - or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms.  
All Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions should be reported as an SAE if criteria are met. Infusion reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE 4.0 guidelines.  
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified ba sed on local treatment 
standards and guidelines as appropriate: 
For Grade 1 symptoms:  (Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated)  
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. The following 
prophyl actic premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or 
equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) at least 30 minutes before additional nivolumab administrations. 
For Grade 2 symptoms : (Moderate reaction req uires therapy or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines, non -steroidal anti inflammatory 
drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic medications indicated 
for  24 hours). 
Stop the nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_182], begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the 
subject with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg

30 
 (acetaminophen); remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of  symptoms. 
Corticosteroid or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusion 
is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms 
resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of 
the original infusion rate. Monitor subject closely. If symptoms recur then no further nivolumab 
or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_114569]. Administer diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_1132569] be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF). The following prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or 
equivalen t) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) should be administered at least 
30 minutes before additional nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45782]. If necessary, corticosteroids (recommended dose: up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be 
used. 
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms:  (Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_20309]/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of 
symptoms following initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_817854] 
[eg, renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]). Grade 4: (life threatening; pressor or ventilatory support indicated).  
Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Begin an IV infusion of normal 
saline, and treat t he subject as follows. Recommend bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of 
a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with 
methylpredn isolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject should be monitored until the 
investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_102341]. Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the 
treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. 
In the case of late- occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized or 
generalized pruritis within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).

ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQU IREMENTS  
 Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The following list of reported and/or potential AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an 
observed AE (Section 7.2) will determine whether the event requires expedited  reporting in 
addition  to routine reporting.  
 
7.1 Adverse Event Characteristics

downloaded from the CTEP web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
• For expedited reporting  purposes only:   
- AEs for the agent (s) that are listed above should be reported only if the adverse event 
varies in nature, intensity or frequency from the expected toxicity information which is provided. 
- Other AEs for the protocol that do not require expedited reporting are outlined in the 
next section (Expedited Adverse Event Reporting) under the sub- heading of Protocol -
Specific Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Exclusions. 
 
• Attribution  of the AE: 
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.

 7.5 Definitions  
 
7.5.1 An Adverse Event (AE)  is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or 
worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this trea tment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product. The causal relationship to study drug is determined 
by a physician and should be used to assess all adverse events (AE).  
 7.5.2 A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_817855] (see 
NOTE  below) 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical 
and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)  
• Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important me dical event.  
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study drug is an SAE.  
• Although pregnancy, overdose, and cancer are not always serious by [CONTACT_157335], these events must be handled as SAEs. 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8609]:  
− a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life- threatening event)  
− elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent 
− admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure 
− routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg, routine colonoscopy) 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-136 
Protocol Version Date:   January 24, 2019  
 
33 
 − Medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry 
into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases 
− Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason).  
7.5.3 Nonserious Adverse Events 
• A nonserious adverse event  is an AE not classified as serious.  
• Nonserious Adverse Events are to be provided to BMS in aggregate via interim  or final 
study reports as specified in the agreement or, if a regulatory requirement [e.g. IND US trial] as part of an annual reporting requirement.  
• Nonserious AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead -in 
period or other observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.  
 
7.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)  
 Wherever  possible, timel y confirmation of initial liver-related  laboratory  abnormalities  should 
occu r prior to the reporting of a  pot ential DILI event.  All occurrences of potential DILIs, 
meeting the defined criteria, must be repo rted as SAEs. Potential drug induced liver injury  is 
defined as:  
1) ALT or AST elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)  
AND  
2) Total  bilirubin  > [ADDRESS_1132574] , without initial findings  of cholestasis  (elevated  serum 
alkaline phosphatase) 
AND  
3) No other immediate ly apparent  possible causes  of AST/ALT  elevation  and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limite d to, viral hepatitis , pre- existin g chroni c 
or acute liver disease , or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. 
7.[ADDRESS_1132575] will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for subject safety).  
The investigator must  immediately notify Worldwide Safety @BMS of this event via the 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form in accordance with SAE reporting procedures.  
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-136 
Protocol Version Date:   January 24, [ADDRESS_1132576] be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form [provided upon request from BMS] 
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be reported to 
BMS. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. 
7.[ADDRESS_1132577] be reported as an SAE.  
7.9 Other Safety Considerations  
 
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiograms, x -rays, and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these 
procedures are required by [CONTACT_760], should also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly. 
7.10 Adverse event reporting to BMS  
 
• All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur following the subject’s written consent to 
participate in the study through [ADDRESS_1132578] be reported to BMS Worldwide Safety.  
• The BMS SAE form should be used to report SAEs.  If the BMS form cannot be used, another acceptable form (i.e CIOMS or Medwatch) must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_20444].  The BMS protocol ID number must be included on whatever form is submitted by [CONTACT_1034]/Investigator. 
• Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether 
related or not related to study drug, are collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol -specified procedures. The investigator should report any SAE occurring 
after these time periods that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol -specified 
procedure.  
• In accordance with local regulations, BMS will notify investigators of all reported SAEs 
that are suspected (related to the investigational product) and unexpected (i.e., not 
previously described in the IB). In the European Union (EU), an event meeting these 
criteria is termed a Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R). 
Investigator notification of these events will be in the form of an expedited safety report 
(ESR).  
o Other important findings which may be reported by [CONTACT_114646]: increased frequency of a clinically significant expected SAE, an SAE considered 
associated with study procedures that could modify the conduct of the study, lack 
of efficacy that poses significant hazard to study subjects, clinically significant 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-136 
Protocol Version Date:   January 24, 2019  
 
35 
 safety finding from a nonclinical (eg, animal) study, important safety 
recommendations from a study data monitoring committee, or sponsor decision to 
end or temporarily halt a clinical study for safety reasons.  
o Upon receiving an ESR from BMS, the investigator must review and retain the 
ESR with the IB. Where required by [CONTACT_34342] a central 
IRB/IEC for the study, the sponsor will submit the ESR to the appropriate 
IRB/IEC. The investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent 
requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB /IEC 
procedures for reporting any other safety information.  
o In addition, suspected serious adverse reactions (whether expected or unexpected) 
shall be reported by [CONTACT_370706] (either as expedited and/or in 
aggregate reports).  
• Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether

 Nivolumab infusions are to be administered as an IV infusion through a 0.2- micron to 1.2-
micron pore size, low -protein binding polyethersulfone membrane in- line filter at the protocol-
specified doses. It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus injection. 
 
Preparation and Administration : 
1. Visually inspect the drug product solution for pa rticulate matter and discoloration prior to 
administration.  Discard if solution is cloudy, if there is pronounced discoloration (solution may have a pale- yellow color), or if there is foreign particulate matter other than a few 
translucent -to-white, amorp hous particles. Note: Mix by [CONTACT_645417].  Do 
not shake.  
2. Aseptically withdraw the required volume of Nivolumab solution into a syringe, and dispense into an IV. bag.  If multiple vials are needed for a subject, it is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each vial to prevent problems such as dulling of needle 
tip, stopper coring, repeated friction of plunger against syringe barrel wall.  Do not  enter into 
each vial more than once.  Do not  administer study drug as an IV  push or bolus injection 
3. Add the appropriate volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection solution or 5% Dextrose Injection solution. It is acceptable to add Nivolumab solution from the vials into an 
appropriate pre-filled bag of diluent. 
4. Note:  Nivolumab infus ion concentration must be at or above  the minimum allowable 
concentration of 0.35 mg/mL [IBV13 Addendum Section 3.2.2] 
5. Note:  It is not recommended that so- called “channel” or tube systems are used to transport 
prepared infusions of Nivolumab. 
6. Attach the IV  bag containing the Nivolumab solution to the infusion set and filter. 
7. At the end of the infusion period, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of approved diluents.

2. Ensure that the Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_404326], essentially free from particulate 
matter on visual inspection. If multiple vials are needed for a subject, it is important to 
use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each vial to prevent problems such as dulling of needle tip, stoppe r coring, repeated friction of plunger against syringe barrel wall, etc.  
3. Aseptically transfer the required volume of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_404327] a syringe. [Note: A sufficient excess of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817862] s].  
4. Do not draw into each vial more than once. Discard partially used vials or empty vials. 
5. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_404329].  
Total dose should be calculated using the  most recent subject weight; if weight on dosing 
day differs by 5% from prior weight used to calculate dosing, the dose should be 
recalculated and study drug adjusted accordingly.  
Mix by [CONTACT_404357]. DO NOT shake.  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817863] y be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% 
Dextrose Injection, USP. 
6. Visually inspect the final solution. If the initial diluted solution or final solution for infusion is not clear or contents appear to contain precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047], the solution should be discarded.  
7. Immediately after the infusion is complete, flush with an adequate amount of 0.9% Sodium Chloride injection (USP) or 5% Dextrose injection (USP)  to completely flush the residual fluid (dead space) in your administration set (approximately  30-50mL); this 
will ensure that all active drug is delivered to the study participant

9. BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE, AND SPECIAL STUDIES  
 
 
9.1 Background of exploratory biomarker studies:  
The objectives of our exploratory biomarkers are to define the genomic characteristics and the immune microenvironment of leptomeningeal disease in the setting of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Whole -exome sequencing and transcriptome data from non- CNS  and CNS  metastases 
and LMD will enable the identification of mutations, insertion/deletion events, and copy -number 
changes. We also exp ect to identify genetic signatures that predict response to immunotherapy. 
Based on our preliminary data across [ADDRESS_1132588] to observe changes in RNA/protein expression profiles and 
identify gene pathways that are consistently and differentially enriched in CSF T cells and myeloid cells by [CONTACT_143889]. Correlation of clinical outcome with these transcriptomic analyses may lead to predictive signatures of response to immunotherapy. Moreover, we may find evidence of immunosuppression by [CONTACT_817905], which may suggest new therapeutic strategies for LMD for future investigations. In addition, we may find gene pathways that are enriched in T cells and/or myeloid cells in both the peripheral blood and CSF, which may 
provide a strategy for immune monitoring of patients on immunotherapy in a more accessible manner. Likewise, we may find changes in cytokines and the proteome in the CSF in response to immunotherapy. If similar cyto kines/proteins are altered in the CSF and blood, then such 
proteins have the potential to serve as biomarkers for responsiveness to immunotherapy.  
 9.2 Methodology 
Whole- exome sequencing:  Whole- exome sequencing from tumor and cell -free DNA from CSF 
and blood will be performed using pi[INVESTIGATOR_817865] . DNA will be subjected to solution-
phase hybrid capture  followed by [CONTACT_817906] >150x mean coverage. Mutations and 
allele -specific copy -number changes will be determined within the Firehose pi[INVESTIGATOR_817866] a suite of existing tools. The significance of copy -
number changes and mutations will be determined using GISTIC and MutSig, respectively, and compared to rates of alterations in the same genes in published large sequencing efforts of unmatched samples. To understand inter - and intratumoral heterogeneity, we will perform an 
integrative analysis of somatic single nucleotide variants and somatic copy -number alterations. 
This analysis will allow us to estimate the clonal architecture of the primary and metastatic samples from each patient, and to reconstruct phylogenetic trees relating all of the subclones. For each recu rrent mutation, the frequency with which these mutations are present in all or only 
fractions of cancer cells will be determined.  
Transcriptome sequencing and analysis:  RNA will be extracted with QIAGEN kits. Non -strand 
specific RNA sequencing performed at the Broad Institute uses a large -scale, automated variant 
of the Illumina Tru Seq™ RNA Sample Preparation. This method uses oligo dT beads to select 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-136 
Protocol Version Date:   January 24, 2019  
 
43 
 mRNA from the total RNA sample. The selected RNA is heat fragmented and randomly primed 
before cDNA synthesis from the RNA template. The resultant cDNA then goes through Illumina library prep (end repair, base ‘A’ addition, adapter ligation, and enrichment) using Broad designed indexed adapters for multiplexing. After enrichment, the samples will be qPCR quantified and equimolar pooled before proceeding to Illumina sequencing, which is done on the Illumina HiSeq 2000. RNA -seq analysis will be carried out using PRADA (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_817867] -
Sequencing Data Analysis). Somatic variant, small deletions and insertion cal ling will be 
performed within the Firehose environment at the Broad Institute with the published caller algorithms.  
Cell Purification by [CONTACT_46110]:  CSF will be sorted on CD45 to separate tumor (CD45- ) 
and immune (CD45+) cells for genomic and transcriptomic analyses. CD4
+ and CD8+ T cells 
and myeloid cells (CD11b+) will be purified from the CSF and PBMC by [CONTACT_817907]. We will  systematically assess differentially expressed 
transcripts in pre - and on - treatme nt samples to determine if there is enrichment within particular 
gene pathways (such as exhaustion, anergy, senescence) through GeneSet Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and gene co -expression network analysis.  
Cytokine and Proteomic Analyses:  We will analyze cy tokines in CSF and serum using cytokine 
bead arrays. High -resolution mass spectrometers and isobaric tandem mass tags will be used to 
quantify proteins from CSF and serum samples. The tandem mass tag technology allows for the analysis of 6 -10 samples within a single experiment. For example, protein expression can be 
profiled after nine treatment conditions and compared to an untreated sample across >6,[ADDRESS_1132589] Medical School.  
 9.3 Collection and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_817815](s)  
Collection, Processing and Handling of CSF: One 3 to 10 mL  sample of CSF in a clear CSF tube

Protocol Version Date:   January 24, [ADDRESS_1132613] – Extracranial lesion assessments  
 For the purposes of this study, participants should be re -evaluated for response every 6 weeks.   
In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 3 weeks following 
initial documentation of objective response.  Response and progression will be evaluated in this study  using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca  45:228- 247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of 
the tumor lesions and the shor test diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the 
RECIST criteria.  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_1132614] leptomeningeal 
disease present at baseline (as defined by [CONTACT_817909]), have re ceived at least one 
cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated with restaging scans and 
cytology will be considered evaluable for target disease response.  These participants will 
have their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  
 
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response.  Participants  who have lesions present at 
baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be 
considered evaluable for non- target disease.  The response assessment is based on the 
presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.

 Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area migh t or might not be 
considered measurable.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_1132618] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed.

DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-136

Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis ), 
are considered non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all co nsidered 
non-measurable.  
 Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions  and recorded and  measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the larg est lesion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all ta rget lesions will be calculated and reported 
as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All othe r lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions  and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow up.  
 
11.1.3 Methods for Evaluation of Disease 
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler, calipers , 
or a digital measurement tool.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based

52 
 evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) bein g 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesions . Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm in diame ter as 
assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
[CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray.  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined an d surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]; h owever, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI . This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT thickness is 5mm or l ess. If CT scans have slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion should be twice 
the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excell ent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow- up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scann er should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body  scans 
should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
FDG -PET. While FDG -PET response assessments need additional s tudy, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
(a) Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. (b)  No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is 
PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease 
on CT, additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD  will be the date of the initial 
abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a 
pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic 
images, this is not PD.  
(c)  FDG- PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-136 
Protocol Version Date:   January 24, [ADDRESS_1132619] be acknowledged that both approaches 
may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy 
resolution/sensitivity.  
 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means  one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
PET- CT. At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET- CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT q uality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET- CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIS T measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or seriall y performed.   
 
Cytology, Histology . These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
11.1.4 Response Criteria  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non- targe t) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least  5 mm.  (Note:  
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
 
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-136 
Protocol Version Date:   January 24, 2019  
 
54 
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progr essive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change,  not a single lesion increase.     
 Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_33954], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal 
Investigator). 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of New Lesions  The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre -existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow -up scan in an 
anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of small size etc.), follow -up 
evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and if PD is confirmed, progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion was discovered.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response  The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

11.1.5 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall  response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started , or 
death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation ).

Duration of stable disease :  Stable d isease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

registration to the earlier of pr ogression or death due to any cause. Participants alive 
without disease progression are censored at date of last disease evaluation.  
 
Time to Progression: Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time from

evaluation for those without progression reported.

lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with longest diameter), be 
representative of other lesions and lend themselves  to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  
 
Non-measurable disease.  Unidimensionally measurable lesions, masses with margins not 
clearly defined, lesions with maximal diameter < 1cm.  
11.2.3 Methods for Evaluation of Disease 
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler, calipers , 
or a digital measurement tool.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 The same  method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
followe d cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Conventional head CT and brain MRI . This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT thickness is 5mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion 
should be twice the slice thickness.  
 11.2.4 Response Criteria  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Intracranial  Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Requires all of the following:  
• complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and  nonmeasurable 
disease sustained for at least 4 weeks  
• no new lesions 
• stable or decreasing corticosteroids (the steroid dose at the time of the scan evaluation should be no greater than the dose at time of baseline scan) 
• stable or improved clinically  
 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-136 
Protocol Version Date:   January 24, [ADDRESS_1132623] 
possible response is stable disease. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  All of the following criteria must be met: 
• Greater than or equal to 50% decrease compared to baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks. In the absence of a confirming scan 4 weeks later, this scan will be considered only stable disease.  
• no progression of non- measurable disease.  
• no new lesions 
• stable or reduced corticosteroid dose (the steroid dose at the time of the scan evaluation should be no greater than the dose at time of baseline scan) 
• stable or improved clinically  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least one of the following must be tr ue:  
• > 25% increase in the sum of products of all measurable lesions over smallest 
sum observed (over baseline if no decrease) using the same techniques as 
baseline  
• clear worsening of any nonmeasurable disease*  
• appearance of any new enhancing lesion/site 
• clear clinical worsening (unless clearly unrelated to this cancer, e.g. seizures, medication side effects, complications of therapy, cerebrovascular events, infecion ) 
• failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition 
* Progression of non-measurable CNS lesions is defined as follows:  
• a lesion initially at baseline </=5mm in diameter that increases to >/= 10mm in diameter, or 
• a lesion initially at baseline [ADDRESS_1132624] 5 
mm in diameter.  
 
Stable Disease (SD):  All of the following criteria must be met: 
• Does not qualify for CR, PR or progression 
• All measurable and non -measurable sites must be assessed using the same 
techniques as baseline  
• Stable clinically.

[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response  The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation cri teria. If a response recorded at one scheduled MRI does not persist at 
the next regular scheduled MRI, the response will still be recorded based on the prior scan, but will be designated as a non- sustained response. If the response is sustained, 
i.e. still present on the subsequent MRI at least four weeks later, it will be recorded as 
a sustained response, lasting until the time of tumor progression. Participants without measurable disease may only achieve SD or PD as their best “response.”  
[IP_ADDRESS] Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (ta king as 
reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, or death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation).  
 
Duration of overall complete response : The duration of overall CR is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented, or death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last  disease evaluation.   
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
11.2.5 Study Continuation Beyond Initial Progressive Disease 
 
Immunotherapeutic agents such as ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817873] #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-136 
Protocol Version Date:   January 24, [ADDRESS_1132625] scans (i.e. 
pseudo- progression). In addition, the response patterns seen with immunotherapeutics 
may extend beyond the typi[INVESTIGATOR_264788], and 
can manifest a clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the appearance of new lesions. For these reasons, the immune - related response criteria 
(irRC) have endorsed continuation of study therapy beyond initial radiographic evidence of progression for clin ically stable patients undergoing immune based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Therefore, the following adaptations will be used to assess response for patients treated on this study: 
Potential Pseudo -progression:  If radiologic imaging shows initial PD, subjects who are 
not ex periencing significant clinical decline, may be allowed to continue study treatment 
for up to three months. Patients who have radiographic evidence of further progression after up to three months, or who decline significantly at anytime, will be classified  as 
progressive with the date of disease progression back- dated to the first date that the 
subject met criteria for progression and such subjects will be discontinued from study therapy.  Three months is the most common timeframe for pseudo -progression obse rved 
among patients with advanced melanoma or other solid tumors treated with PD -1/PD- L1 
immune checkpoint blockade
17.  
Among patients on this study with initial radiographic PD, tumor assessment should be repeated regularly in order to confirm PD with the option of continuing treatment as 
described below while awaiting radiologic confirmation of progression. If repeat imaging 
shows a stabilization or reduction in the tumor burden compared to the initial scan demonst rating PD, treatment may be continued / resumed. If repeat imaging after up to 
three months confirms progressive disease, then the date of disease progression will be the first date the subject met criteria for progression and subjects will be discontinued from study therapy. Subjects who have confirmed disease progression will discontinue study medication and enter the follow up/survival phase of the study. In determining whether or not the tumor burden has increased or decreased, investigators should consider all target lesions as well as non -target lesions.  
Tumor Enhancement to Define Progression:  RANO expanded the previousl y utilized 
Macdonald criteria18 to include the development of “significantly” increased T2 or 
FLAIR abnormality in the definition of progressive disease because such changes can be a major component defining radiographic progression following therapeutic use of 
VEGF/VEGFR -targeting therapeutics which are known to elicit potent anti -permeability 
changes that limit contrast uptake. However, immune based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_817874]. Therefore, our study will define radiographic progressive disease by [CONTACT_817910] r burden only 
and will not inclu de assessment of T2 or FLAIR changes as outlined in RANO bec ause:  
 
• There is no expectation that immunotherapy agents including PD -1 inhibitors will  
falsely diminish enhancing tumor burden as has been noted with anti -angiogenic 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-136 
Protocol Version Date:   January 24, 2019  
 
61 
 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and  
• Immune based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_817875] h 
may be associated with increased edema and T2/FLAIR changes. Such 
radiographic finding may inaccurately be interpreted to represent tumor progression (i.e. pseudoprogression).   
In subjects who have initial evidence of radiographic PD, it is at the discretion of the treating physician whether to continue a subject on study treatment for up to three months pending confirmation of PD on follow -up imaging. This clinical judgment decision 
should be based on the subject’s overall clinical condition, including performance status, clinical symptoms, and laboratory data. Subjects may receive study treatment while waiting for confirmation of PD if they are not experiencing significant clinical decline and if: 
• The subject is believed to demonstrate clinical benefit from the study regimen as 
determined by [CONTACT_1963];  
• The subject is adequately tolerating study therapy.  
 
When feasible, study therapy should not be discontinued until radiographic progression is confirmed. This allowance to continue treatment despi[INVESTIGATOR_817876] a transient tumor flare in the first few months after the start of immunotherapy, but with subsequent disease response
19. Subjects that are exhibiting significant neurologic decline are not required to 
have repeat imaging for confirmation of progressive disease.  
Participants with progressive radiographic findings are encouraged to undergo surgical intervention in orde r to delineate pseudo -progression due to inflammation associated with 
PD-[ADDRESS_1132626] date the participant met radiographic criteria for PD.  
11.3 Response Review  
 All brain MRI scans will be reviewed centrally by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Tumor Imaging Metrics 
Core (TIMC). CNS response will be assessed centrally using the RANO criteria outlined 
in Section 12.1.4. 
All non- CNS scans will be reviewed centrally by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Tumor Imaging Metrics 
Core (TIMC). Extracranial response will be assessed centrally using RECIST criteria.

STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
 This is a single arm phase II trial to investigate the therapeutic effect of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817878].  
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 Primary endpoint:  Rate of overall survival at 3 months 
 Secondary Endpoints:  
1. Toxicity by [CONTACT_55550] (grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity; grade 3 or higher 
neurologic toxicity)  2. Intracranial response in patients with leptomeningeal metastases  
3. Extracranial response as determined by [CONTACT_377258]  
4. Leptomeningeal disease response as defined in section 11.[ADDRESS_1132629] occurrence of intracranial disease progression, or death from any cause  
   Exploratory Endpoints:  Genetic alterations  
 13.2 Sample Size, Accrual Rate and Study Duration  
 Accrual of up to 20 patients may be  required to achieve 18 evaluable patients.   
 The primary endpoint is the rate of overall survival at 3 months (OS 3). Any patient whose vi tal 
status at 3 months cannot be determined will be counted as having died.  A  Simon two -stage 
design will be used to compare a null hypothesis OS3 of 18% against an alternative of 43%. Nine  
patients will be enrolled in the first stage. If [ADDRESS_1132630] 6 patients among the total of 18 patients are alive at 3 months, then the treatment 
would be promising  in the cohort. This design has a type -I error of 8% (target 10%) and power 
of 86% (target 85%) . If the null hypothesis is true, then the probability is 0.[ADDRESS_1132631] stage.  In addition, we will assess for the primary outcome of  any histologic , molecular  subtype (e.g., 
ER/PR -positive, HER2 -positive breast cancer, EGFR mutant lung cancer) with 6 patients 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-136 
Protocol Version Date:   January 24, 2019  
 
65 
 enrolled for that particular subtype.  If no patient within a particular histologic subtype has 
achieved the primary outcome, th en patients with  that histology will no longer be eligible to 
enroll in the trial.    Under the alternative hypothesis (i.e., OS3 = 43%), the probability is 0.03 of 
observing no patients with OS3 among 6 patients.  
 The accrual rate is based on our instit utional patient volume of 3-4 patients per month with 
leptomeningeal carcinomatosis  seen in our multidisciplinary brain metastasis clinic .  We estimate 
that 1 -2 patients  per month will be eligible for this protocol. Therefore, 20 patie nts will be 
accrued wit hin 10- 20 months. Based on six months of follow -up (median survival of patients is 
approximately 2 -4 months), total study duration will be 24 months. 
 13.3 Stratification Factors  
 N/A  13.4 Interim Monitoring Plan  
 N/A  13.5 Analysis of Primary Endpoints 
 The primary end point is the rate of overall survival at 3 months (OS 3). Any patient whose vital 
status is unknown due to loss of follow -up will be classified as having died for purposes of 
estimating the primary endpoint.  The proportion of patients alive at 3 months wil l be 
summarized with a 90% confidence interval estimated using the method of Atkinson and Brown, which allows for the two -stage design.  Based on a sample of 18 patients, the confidence interval 
will be no wider than 0.42.    13.6 Analysis of Secondary Endpoint s 
 
Safety and Tolerability :  All adverse events recorded during the trial will be summarized for all 
patients having received one or more doses of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45762]. The data for each 
cohort will be summarized separately, although safety data may be  combined, if appropriate.  
The proportions of patients with grade -3 or higher hematologic toxicities or grade -3 or higher 
neurologic toxicities will be presented with 90% exact binomial confidence intervals.  The 
incidence of events that are new or worsen ing from the time of first dose of treatment will be 
summarized according to system organ class and/or preferred term, severity (based on CTCAE grade), type of adverse event, and relation to study treatment. Deaths reportable as SAEs and non-fatal serious adverse events will be listed by [CONTACT_817911], and type of adverse event.  
 
Intracranial/Extracranial  Response :  The proportion of patients with intracranial response  of 
intraparenchymal brain met astases  (CR or PR by  [CONTACT_95733]) will be presented with a two -sided, 
90% exact binomial confidence interval. For a sample of [ADDRESS_1132632] maximum width of 0.42.  Extracranial response rates (CR or PR) according to RECIST and 
irRC will be summarized .  Rates will be accompanied by [CONTACT_1192] -sided 90% exact binomial 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-136 
Protocol Version Date:   January 24, [ADDRESS_1132633] and irRC responses do not agree will be 
documented.  
Leptomeningeal D isease R esponse: The proportion of patients with leptomeningeal disease 
response  (C R or PR) will be presented with a two -sided, 90% exact binomial confidence 
interval. For a sample of [ADDRESS_1132634] maximum width of 0.42.   
 
Extracranial PFS and Intracranial PFS:  Extracranial PFS (EPFS) is defined as the time from first 
dose of study drug to documented extracranial progression (per RECIST or irRC) or death, whichever occurs first.  Intracranial PFS (IPFS) is defined as the time from first dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_817879] (RANO) or death, whichever occurs first.  For both endpoints, the follow -up of patients who have neither died nor progressed 
at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last adequate disease assessment.  Each 
cohort will be presented separa tely.  Median EPFS and IPFS will be presented and accompanied 
by 90% confidence intervals estimated using log( -log(survival)) methodology.  Point estimates at 
3 and 6 months will also be presented with confidence intervals. 
 13.7 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoin ts  
 Biomarkers of blood and tissue:  Analyses of blood and tissue biomarkers will be based on descriptive statistics, as appropriate for the biomarker.  
 To examine response according to pre -treatment levels of biomarkers, the study sample will be 
divided retrospectively according to the primary endpoint of response or non- response. Pre -
treatment biomarker levels will be summarized descriptively for the two response groups and compared using Wilcoxon rank- sum tests for markers measured on a continuous scale , or 
Fisher’s exact tests for those measured on a categorical scale. Where appropriate, visualization of the relationship between baseline marker levels and the distributions of PFS or OS will employ Kaplan -Meier estimates stratified by [CONTACT_817912]. M edians of the time -to-event endpoints 
will be shown with two -sided 90% confidence intervals; the distributions of PFS and OS will be 
compared across biomarker strata using the log -rank test. 
 Changes in biomarkers between pretreatment and progression or tr eatment discontinuation will 
be calculated (post -pre) for each patient and summarized descriptively. In addition, the 
correlation of changes in tissue biomarkers with changes in measures of peripheral blood markers will be explored graphically, or by [CONTACT_817913], to assess associations.

APPENDIX B TUMOR ASSESSMENT PER  IMMUNE -RELATED RESPONSE CRITERIA  
 
Immune- related Response Criteria (irRC) are derived from  modified World Health Organization  
(mWHO) conventions. Assessments of lymph nodes are derived from current RECIST  
guidelines.  
Definitions of Measurable/non -Measurable Lesions  
All measurable and non -measurable lesions should be assessed at Screening and a t the defined  
tumor assessment time points. Additional assessments may be performed, as clinically indicated  
for suspi[INVESTIGATOR_55519].   
Measurable Lesions  
Measurable lesions are lesions that can be accurately measured in [ADDRESS_1132639] 1 diameter > 20 mm and the other dimension  > 10 mm ([ADDRESS_1132640] with cuts of 5 mm). The area will be defined as the product of the largest diameter with its  
perpendicular. 
 Lymph nodes may also be considered measurable. To be considered pathologically enlarged and  
measurable, a lymph node must be at least [ADDRESS_1132641] scan (CT  
scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  
Non-Measurable Lesions  
Non-measurable (evaluable) lesions are all  other lesions, including unidimensional measurable  
disease and small lesions (lesions without at least 1 diameter > 20 mm, or pathological lymph 
nodes with short axis  15 mm), and any of the following: lesions occurring in a previously  
irradiated area (unless they are documented as new lesions since the completion of radiation  
therapy), bone lesions, l eptomeningeal disease, ascites,  pleural or per icardial effusion, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, abdominal masses that are not  pathologically/cytologically 
confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_79377]. Lymph nodes that have a 
short axis < 10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed. 
 
Definitions of Index/non -Index Lesions  
Index Lesions  
Measurable lesions, up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_1132642] be selected based on their  
size (eg, lesions with the longest diameters), their suitability for accurate repeat assessment by  
[CONTACT_15218], and how representative they are of the subject’s tumor burden. At  
Screening, a Sum of the Product Diameters (SPD) for all index lesions will be calculated and  
considered the baseline SPD. The baseline sum will be used as the reference point to determine  
the objective tumor response of the index lesions at tumor assessment.  
 
Non Index Lesions  
Measurable lesions, other than index lesions, and all sites of non- measurable disease, will be 
identified as non- index lesions. Non- index lesions will be evaluated at the same assessment time  
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-136 
Protocol Version Date:   January 24, [ADDRESS_1132643] of Diameters (SPD) 
Sum of Product of Diameters is an estimate of tumor burden. The [ADDRESS_1132644] of the diameters for index tumor lesions. Several variations of the SPD are identified  
for the purpose of classification of tumor responses.  
SPD at Baseline:  The sum of the product of the diameters for all index lesions identified at  
baseline prior to treatment on Day 1. 
 
SPD at tumor assessment: For every on- study tumor assessment collected per protocol or as  
clinically indicated, the SPD at tumor assessment will be calculated using tumor imaging scans.  
All index lesions and all new measurable lesions that have emerged after baseline will contribute  
to the SPD at tumor assessment (irSPD).  
 
SPD at NADIR:  For tumors that are asse ssed more than [ADDRESS_1132645] value  of 
the SPD (SPD Baseline or SPD at tumor assessment) is used to classify subsequent tumor  
assessments for each subject. The SPD at tumor assessment using the irRC for progressive  
disease incorporates t he contribution of new measurable lesions. Each net percentage change in 
tumor burden per assessment using irRC accounts for the size and growth kinetics of both old  
and new lesions as they appear. In this study the irRC as defined by [CONTACT_817914].  
 
Definition of Index Lesion Response  
Immune- related Complete Response (irCR),  which is defined as complete disappearance of all  
index lesions. Lymph nodes that shrink to < 10 mm short axis are considered normal.   
 
Immune- related Partial Response (irPR),  which is defined as a decrease, relative to baseline,  of 
50% or greater in the sum of the products of the [ADDRESS_1132646] perpendicular diameters of all index and all new measurable lesions (ie, Percentage Change in Tumor Burden), in the absence of  
irCR.  
 
Note: the appearance of new measurable lesions is factored into the overall tumor burden, but  
does not automatically qualify as progressive disease until the SPD increases by > 25% when  
compared to SPD at nadir 
 
Immune- related Stable Disease (irSD) , which is defined as not meeting the criteria for irCR or  
irPR, in the absence of immune- related progressive disease (irPD)  
 
Immune- related Progressive Disease (irPD),  which is defined as  at least a 25% increase in  
Tumor Burden (ie, taking sum of the products of all index lesions and any new measurable  
lesions) when compared to SPD at nadir. 
 
Definition of Non -Index Lesion Response  
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  16-136 
Protocol Version Date:   January 24, 2019  
 
73 
 Immune- related Complete Response (irCR),  which is defined as complete disappearance of all  
non-index lesions. Lymph nodes that shrink to < 10 mm short axis are considered normal.  
 
Immune- related Partial Response (irPR),  non- index lesion(s) are not considered in the  definition 
of PR, this term does not apply. 
 
Immune- related Stable Disease (irSD),  non- index lesion(s) are not considered in the definition of 
SD, this term does not apply. 
 
Immune- related Progressive Disease (irPD) , increases in number or size of non- index lesion(s)  
does not constitute progressive disease unless/until Tumor Burden increases by 25% (ie, the SPD  
at nadir of index lesions and any new measurable lesions increases by [CONTACT_242839]). 
 
Impact of New Lesions on irRC 
New lesions alone do not qualify as progressive disease. However their contribution to total  
tumor burden is included in the SPD which in turn feeds into the irRC for tumor response.  
Therefore, new non -measurable lesions will not discontinue any subject from the study.  
 
Definition of Overall Response Using irRC Will Be Based on the Following Criteria: 
• Immune- related Complete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all tumor lesions  
(index and non- index), together with no new measurable or unmeasurable lesions, for at 
least [ADDRESS_1132647] 
be < 10 mm. 
• Immune- related Partial Response (irPR): The sum of the products of the [ADDRESS_1132648] of the Diameters (irSPD). 
A decrease, relative to baseline of the irSPD of 50 % or greater is considered an irPR, in 
the absence of irCR. Must be confirmed no less than [ADDRESS_1132649] irPR. 
• Immune- related Stable Disease (irSD): irSD is defined as the failure to meet criteria for  
immune complete response or immune partial res ponse, in the absence of progressive 
disease.  
• Immune- related Progressive Disease (irPD): It is recommended in difficult cases (eg,  
increase in SPD or irSPD accompanied with significant individual lesion regression, “mixed  response”, or in presence of stabl e or improving performance status/clinical 
condition) to confirm PD at the following tumor assessment. Any of the following will 
constitute progressive disease:  
• At least 25% increase in the SPD of all index lesions over nadir SPD calculated for these  lesions 
• At least a 25% increase in the SPD of all index lesions and new measurable lesions 
• (irSPD) over the nadir SPD calculated for the index lesions.

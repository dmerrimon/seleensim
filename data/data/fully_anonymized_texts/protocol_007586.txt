Study Rationale:  
 
 This is intended to be an initial "proof -of-concept" study to show  feasibility, 
validate assays and approaches, and explore dosing and safety of belimumab in 
pulmonary COPD  patients who have clinically relevant (and quantifiable) 
autoimmune responses.   
Study Objectives:  The primary goal of clinical trial is to determin e effects of belimumab on levels 
of autoantibodies against glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) among 
patients with pulmonary COPD  attributable to cigarette smoking.   
 
Study Hypothesis:  Our study  hypothesis is  that belimumab treatment will safely reduce 
circulating levels of autoantibodies  that are  associated with COPD , and 
comorbidities of this lung disease, including atherosclerosis .

 Study Aims:  
 Specific Aim 1:  To conduct a double -blind, Phase II trial,  in which 18 former 
smokers with  COPD  and circulating anti -GRP78 autoantibody levels >mean 
normal values (by [CONTACT_6428]), will be randomized 2:1 to belimumab vs. placebo.  
Subjects will receive 8 infusions of either belimumab or placebo over a 6 month 
interval.  Plasma anti -GRP78  antibodies  will b e measured pre -treatment, and at 
1, 3, 5, and 7  months.  We hypothesize belimumab therapy will more effectively 
reduce anti -GRP78 IgG autoantibodies, the primary endpoint of this trial, 
compared to placebo.    
 
Specific Aim 2:  To determine effects of the be limumab therapy on secondary 
endpoints  (at the times detailed for Aim 1) that include levels of pneumococcal -
binding antibodies (by [CONTACT_6428]), circulating B -cell numbers and phenotypes (by 
[CONTACT_4133]), and the rate and severity of adverse events (AE)  at any time 
during treatment .   We hypothesize belimumab will have dose -related effects 
on B-cell numbers and their differentiation, while minimally reducing  host 
defense antibodies, and  will also  have an acceptable AE  profile.  
 
Study Design:  
 
 Following baseline screening assessments, p atients that meet all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to receive one of the 
following treatments in a ratio of 2:1:  
 
1.) Arm 1: Belimumab (n = 12).   Subjects randomized to the experimental 
treatment arm will receive i.v. administrations of belimumab (10 mg/kg), 
consisting of three "loading" doses, two weeks apart, followed by [CONTACT_325501] (5) more 
monthly infusions.  The final dose is administered at month 6 with final 
assessment at month 7  and a safety visit at month 10 .     
 
2.) Arm 2: Placebo Controls (n  = 6).  These subjects will be treated with 
identically appearing placebo i.v. on the same schedule as the experimental 
arm subjects (i.e., three "loading" doses, two weeks apart, followed by [CONTACT_592586].  Again, t he final assessm ent will be perf ormed at 
month 7 (210 +10 days after treatment start) .  
 
Planned Sample Size:  A total of [ADDRESS_781611] and also 
for medical reasons un -related to study drug or study procedures . 
 
Duration of Treatment:  Six months  
Durati on of 
Participation  Ten months  
Inclusion Criteria:  1.) A history of past tobacco smoking (>10 pack years) , but quit for >6 months 
at the time of enrollment.  Smoking cessation will be confirmed by [CONTACT_592587].    
  
2.) Clinical diagnosis of at least moderate COPD as defined by [CONTACT_592588] (GOLD) criteria : 
BOTEGA  V.2.[ADDRESS_781612] bronchodilator FEV 1/FVC < 70%,  
  b. Post bronchodilator FEV 1 between 25% and 80% predicted, with or 
without chronic symptoms (i.e., cough, sputum production).  
COPD  
3.)  Ability and willingness to give  informed consent.  
 
4.) Levels of plasma autoantibodies against a 15 –mer peptide sequence within 
the GRP78 molecule (a.a. 246 -260) that are in the upper three quartiles of 
values present in COPD  patients.  This epi[INVESTIGATOR_592558]78 Peptide 25.  Levels of anti -GRP78 Peptide 25 autoantibodies are 
significa ntly correlated with carotid artery intimal medial thickness (IMT) among 
COPD patients.     
 
5.) Age 40 -75 y.o. COPD is a disease of older individuals.   
 
Major Exclusion 
Criteria:  1.) History of more than one moderate (treated as outpatient) or severe

4.) Inability or unwill ingness to complete the treatment and surveillance 
protocols.   
 
5.) Listed for lung transplant at time of enrollment.  This exclusion will mitigate 
any potential, however slight, that a patient could be rejected for transplantation 
due to surgeon concerns about this novel therapy (and will also obviate early 
drop-outs due to transplantation).  
 
6.) History of malignant neoplasm within the last 5 years .   
 
7.) Evidence of serious suicide risk including any history of suicidal behavior  in 
the last 6 months and/or  any suicidal ideation in the last 2 months or  those,  in 
the investigator's judgment,  pose a significant suicide risk .

1.1 OBJECTIVE  
 
The goal of  this randomized blinded  Phase II a clinical  trial is to begin to determine selected 
effects (and safety) of belimumab  therapy in pulmonary COPD  patients who have autoantibodies 
with specificities against glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78).    
 
The information gained in this trial will be invaluable, and enable us, and others, to credibly 
propose a subsequent larger and longer clinical trial, th at could more definitively test the effects 
of belimumab on the progression of COPD  and atherosclerosis (and perhaps other related 
comorbidities) .   
 
 
1.2 SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
Hypothesis:  
 
Our specific  study hypothesis is that belimumab treatment will safely reduce circulating levels 
of autoantibodies  to GRP78  that have been associated with  pulmonary  COPD , and 
comorbidities of this lung disease, including atherosclerosis.    
 
Specific Aims:  
 
Specific Aim 1:  To conduct a double -blind, Phase II  trial, in which 18  former smokers with 
pulmonary COPD  (per chest CT scans), and circulating anti -GRP78 autoantibody levels >mean 
normal values (by [CONTACT_6428]), will be randomized 2 :1 to belimumab  vs. placebo.  Plasma anti -
GRP78 will be measur ed pre -treatment, and at 1, 3, 5, and 7  months.  We hypothesize 
belimumab therapy will more effectively reduce anti -GRP78 IgG autoantibodies, the primary 
endpoint of this trial, compared to placebo.    
 
Specific Aim 2:  To determine effects of the belimumab therapy on secondary endpoints that 
include levels of pneumococcal -binding antibodies (by [CONTACT_6428]), circulating B -cell numbers and 
phenotypes (by [CONTACT_4133]), and adverse events (AE).   We hypothesize belimumab will  have 
dose -related effects on B -cell numbers and their differentiation, but will minimally reduce host 
defense antibodies, and will have  an acceptable adverse event profile.  
 
 
1.3 BACKGROUND  
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes the COPD  phenotype of COPD, is 
the third leading cause of death world -wide, and the prevalence (and impact) of these lung disorders 
are increasing.  COPD/ COPD  directly cause considerable disability and premature deaths.1-[ADDRESS_781617] on the natural histories of either the lung abnormalities or comorbidities.   
 “Chronic inflammation” has been implicated in the genesis of COPD  and the several singular 
comorbidities of this disease, but the causal immunological mechanism(s) have remained enigmatic.  
We, and others, have shown that chronic inflammation in COPD  can b e mediated by [CONTACT_592590], autoreactive T -cells, and other immunological abnormalities that parallel features of 
conventional autoimmune syndromes.6,7 Moreover, recent findings (to follow) implicate 
autoimmunity in the genesis and progression  of COPD ,  and the osteoporosis and 
atherosclerosis that are often associated with this lung disease : 
BOTEGA  V.2.[ADDRESS_781618] shown that  antigen -antibody (immune) and complement complexes, 
which are known to cause severe tissue injuries in SLE and other autoimmune diseases, are also 
near ubiquitous in lungs of patients with severe COPD/ COPD .[ADDRESS_781619] also shown circulating B -
cells are hig hly differentiated in COPD, a consequence of repetitive antigen stimulation typi[INVESTIGATOR_592560] (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and other 
autoantibody -mediated disorders.8   
We’ve also reported serum B -lymphocyte stimulating factor (BLyS, aka: B cell activating factor 
or BAFF) concentrations are also abnormally increased in COPD patients (Figure 1).[ADDRESS_781620] two other groups.9,10 One of those studies also 
indicated anti -BLyS therapy had favorable effects in a preclinical 
mouse model of COPD .9  
 
 
Figure 1  (right).  Plasma levels of BLyS  are greater in COPD 
patients (n=90) than in healthy normal subjects (Nl) (n=53).[ADDRESS_781621] glucose 
regulated protein 78 (GRP78) are prevalent in patients with COPD  
(Figure 2).6 GRP78 is a heat shock protein, and an autoantigen in 
several other immune disorders.11,12 Intrapulmonary GRP78 is 
upregulated by [CONTACT_592591], viral infections, and various other 
injuries, and this molecule is over -expressed in COPD tous lungs.6 The pres ence of anti -GRP78 was 
also highly associated with osteoporosis in smokers (Figure 3). 6

between COP D and anti -GRP78 autoantibodies was especially strong 
among smoke controls (SC) who are heavy smokers (>30 pack -years) that 
do not have expi[INVESTIGATOR_592561]. 6

Figure 3  (right). Osteoporosis and Anti -
GRP78 Autoantibodies.  T scores 
(left pan el) and osteoporosis prevalence  (right 
panel) are greater among the smoking cohort 
with anti -GRP78 autoreactivity.6 Bone mineral 
densities (BMD) were measured by [CONTACT_751] X -ray 
absorptiometry (DXA).  T scores are the 
number of BMD standard devia tions from 
young, gender and ethnic -specific reference 
means. T scores < -2.5 at any site defined 
osteoporosis.5,6 
 
Other  recent findings also show anti -
GRP78 autoantibody levels are predictive of COPD  progression (Figure 4).   
The circulating anti -GRP78 autoantibodies in these patients have direct pathogeneic effects that 
can cause or contribute to lung, bone, and other dis eases.  In addition to function as an intracellular 
protein chaperone and key component of the unfolded protein response, GRP78 is extracellularly 
exported by [CONTACT_592593].11  Extracellular GRP78 acts like a cytokine, binding to and stimulating 
various c ell surface receptors that transduce signals on many different cell types. Studies by [CONTACT_3019], and 
others, show anti -GRP78 autoantibodies can bind and crosslink these cell surface GRP78 -
receptor complexes on target cells, including macrophages and osteoclasts ( the bone 
correlate of a macrophage), which then increase their productions of pro -inflammatory 
mediators implicated in lung injury and bone resorption .6,[ADDRESS_781622] similar injurious effects.12  
 
 
 
Figure 4 (left). COPD  Progression and Anti -GRP78 Autoantibodies. 
Anti-GRP78 autoantibody levels (per ELISA Optical Density [OD]) are 
greater in subjects whose COPD  worsens over the next [ADDRESS_781623] COPD  scores.  Shown here are heavy smok ers with COPD  but 
normal spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (denoted as SC in Fig. 2). (Manuscript in preparation).   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additional p reliminary (unpublished) data show anti -
GRP78 autoantibodies from COPD  patients bind to primary human endothelial cells that were 
stressed by [CONTACT_592594], due to increased translocation of 
GRP78 to the cell surfaces (not shown).   
 
We have  recently further refined  our immunological studies by [CONTACT_592595]78 molecule .  Thirty -one (31)  different  peptides  
within the GRP78 molecule  were selected using an autoantibody epi[INVESTIGATOR_28718] .  
Candidate peptides were then synthesized  in vitro , and identities were confirmed by [CONTACT_592596] .  We have found associations  between carotid artery 
IMT in COPD  patients and circulating levels of autoantibodies with specificities against four particular 
linear epi[INVESTIGATOR_322].   The strongest of these associations is with a  15–mer peptide seq uence (GRP78 aa. 
246-260) that we have denoted as anti -GRP78 Peptide 25 (Figure 5 ).   The use of specific peptide

 epi[INVESTIGATOR_592562], diagnostic sensitivities and specificities, potentiate development of assays using  
panels of atherogenic autoantigens, and eliminate confounding introduced by [CONTACT_592597] (e.g., folding) that we have noted among different batches of intact, whole recombinant 
GRP78.    
 
How Does Autoimmunity Arise?    COPD and COPD  probably do not start as autoimmune 
diseases.   Autoimmunity usually develops subsequent to other injurious processes, such as 
infections, cancer, etc., by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_592563], or other unknown mechanisms.14-[ADDRESS_781624] 
“secondary” autoimmunities are probably clinically benign.  In some cases, howev er, these “new” 
immune responses cause striking additional morbidity, e.g., carditis or nephritis following otherwise 
trivial Streptococcal  infections, neurologic syndromes associated with cancer, and many others.14-16   
The microbiome within smoke -damaged  lungs is highly immunogenic, and the chronic immune 
responses that result are also likely conducive to the development of autoimmunity.20   In addition, 
neoantigens generated by [CONTACT_592598].21

levels are greater in COPD  patients with abnormally increased carotid IMT (n = 26) vs those with normal IMT 
(n = 38) per Mann -Whitney comparisons.  Ascending h orizontal lines  successively  denote 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 
and 90th percentiles.  Solid squares denote mean.  These carotid -autoantibody associations were less 
significant among subjects who did not have pulmonary COPD .  
  
The involvement of autoimmune processes in the pathogenesis of smoking -assoc iated lung 
disease could account for well -known, but heretofore enigmatic, observations that pulmonary 
inflammation among these patients often persists, and their respi[INVESTIGATOR_592564], despi[INVESTIGATOR_592565] (e.g., tobacco smoking).[ADDRESS_781625] recurrent, 
since the autologous protein(s) [autoantigen] that is the target of this immune responses is continually 
being re newed.   
Furthermore, an autoimmune pathogenesis can also help explain the resistance of these 
disorders to medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including aerosolized and systemic glucocorticoids.  Many 
autoimmune diseases, and autoantibody -mediated lung diseases in particu lar, are also highly 
resistant to steroids and nonspecific agents.  Among these examples, granulomatosis with polyangitis 
(“Wegener’s syndrome”), Goodpasture’s syndrome, acute interstitial lung diseases associated with 

BOTEGA  V.2.[ADDRESS_781626] very high rates of progression and mortality when treated primarily (or solely) 
with steroids.  In contrast, targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_592566].23-34     
The findings described in the preceding section led us to posit: Autoantibodies play a causal 
role in smoking -related COPD , osteoporosis, and atherosclerosis in patients with this lung 
disease.   A corollary of this paradigm is that autoantibody reduction therapy with belimumab may 
delay (or maybe even prevent) progression of these disorders better than current nonspecific 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   
The foregoing series of studies (and others) pro vide a rationale to treat at -risk COPD  patients with 
biological agents that were developed for therapy of other autoantibody -mediated diseases.33,[ADDRESS_781627] also identified a mechanistic biomarker (anti -GRP78 IgG autoantibodies) that will be a 
useful surrogate endpoint in early phase clinical trials (as we intend to employ it here).[ADDRESS_781628]  been

2   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
2.1  CLASSIFICATION AND METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN  
 
This is a rando mized, double -blinded placebo -controlled Phase II  clinical trial to explore the use  of 
belimumab  in patients with smoking -associated COPD  and autoantibodies.  
 
2.2  STUDY DESIGN   
 
Subjects : Eighteen (18) subjects will be recruited for this project from among ambulatory patients in 
The Kirklin Clinic (TKC) or Lung Health Center (LHC) at the University of Alabama in Birmingham 
(UAB). The LHC is directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Dransfield, a Co -PI [INVESTIGATOR_392134].  Potential participants of both 
genders and all ethnicities will be eligible for this trial.  No special populations will be studied.   
 
Recruitment Methods : The recruitment process will begin via one of two possible pathways:  
 
1) Referral of the prospective participant to the investigators/research coordinator by a clinic 
physician who has knowledge of the proposed research, and obtains patient consent for the research 
team to approach the patient.   
 
2) Alternatively, individua ls who have provided signed IRB -approved HIPPA compliant consent for 
participation in clinical trial research registries may be approached by a designated investigator in 
those registries.   The LHC maintains a registry of more than 1000 COPD patients who c ould be 
screened for potential participation in the trial.

 Following  procurement of informed consent and completion of  baseline screening assessments, 
patients  that meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria  will be randomly assigned to receive one of the two 
following treatments , starting on Day 1,  in a ratio of 2 :1.   
 
1.) EXPERIMENTAL BELIMUMAB  TREATMENT  (n=12 ).    Subjects randomized to the 
experimental treatment arm will receive i.v. administrations of belimumab (10 mg/kg), consisting of 
three "loading" doses, two weeks apart, followed by [CONTACT_325501] (5) more monthly infusions.  The final 
assessment will be performed at month 7  (see Table 1) .     
 
2.) PLACEBO CONTROLS  (n=6) :  These subjects will be treated with identically appearing 
placebo i.v. on the same schedule as the experimental arm subjects (i.e., three "loading" doses, two 
weeks apart, followed by [CONTACT_592599].  The final assessment will be performed at 
month 7 (see Table 1) .

Venous blood for experimental purposes (e.g., end -point measures), totaling 29 ml, and study -
specific pulmonary function tests (i.e., spi[INVESTIGATOR_592568]), wi ll be obtained at 
screening  (baseline) and at 1, 3, 5, and 7 months after treatment started (Table 2).  Additional 
venous phlebotomy specimens for safety monitoring tests and assays appropriate for the 
experimental use of belimumab will be obtained at these and other intervals as ne eded (specified 
below).   
 
The results of the pulmonary function tests, clinical data, and safety studies will be logged in 
case report forms (CRF) as they are generated (in real time).  The experimental laboratory 
(immunological) assays will be performed intermittently among accumulated batched specimens 
and results recorded as they are performed.

investigators’ laboratory  indefinitely and will be under the control of the PI s.  Investigators or 
other personnel not involved with the managem ent or operations of the study are not permitted 
direct access to the specimens.  
 
 
 
2.7  STUDY ENDPOINTS  
 
2.7.1. The Primary End -Point : 
 
The primary endpoint of this trial is a reduction of circulating levels of anti-GRP78 Peptide 25,  a 
clinically relevant surrogate biomarker of "autoimmunity" in these patients. Plasma concentrations of 
the anti -GRP78 autoantibodies will be measured pre -treatment, and at 1, 3, 5, and 7  months after 
treatment start.   
 
General:   Heparinized blood for end -point measures  will be obtained from subjects by [CONTACT_592602].  Gentle centrifugation will separate cells from plasma, which will then be aliquoted and 
appropriately stored for assays of anti -GRP78 IgG (primary endpoint) and anti-pneumococcal 
antibodies (a secondary endpoint).  A separate unantico agulated tube (red top) will be used to procure 
sera.  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) will be isolated from the residual heparinized 
specimen by [CONTACT_592603].  PBMNC will be used for B -cell studies  
(a seconda ry endpoint) , and residual cells will also be stored frozen as dry pellets and in RNase 
protection media for potential later use (e.g, cloning and sequencing autoreactive B -cell IgG).    
 
Anti-GRP78 IgG levels will be measured in serial specimens by a  custom ELISA that has already been 
developed, validated, and employed (see Figs. 4,5).   In brief, biotinylated GRP78 Peptide 25, wh ich 
was synthesized by [CONTACT_592604] (Waltham, MA)  is diluted to 0.5ug/ml in PBS  and added to 
streptavidin -coated ELISA plat e wells and incubated overnight at 4o C.  After thorough washing and 
blocking, patient plasma specimens  (see Section 2.8.2)  are added to the wells at 1:100 dilutions and 
incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Following additional washes, alkaline phosp hatase -
conjugated goat anti -human antibody (1:5000 dilution) is added, incubated, and color developed with a 
pNPP substrate system (KPL, Gaithers -burg, MD). Optical densities (OD) are determined at [ADDRESS_781640] GRP78 and epi[INVESTIGATOR_592569] m olecule are accurate and reproducible.  We used 
identical aliquots of several specimens in assays performed by [CONTACT_592605], 
separated temporally by [CONTACT_8622] 1 year.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_592570], the ELISA yielded concordant values

from a group of COPD  patients yielded r > 0.82.  Most of the differences in OD values in the serial

 measures seemed to be inversely concordant with interval c hanges of patient's clinical status (e.g., 
anti-GRP78 OD tended to increase as their lung disease severity got worse).   
 
 
2.7.2. Secondary End -Points  
 
Specific Aim 2 Endpoints : The  secondary endpoints of this trial are: 1.) treatment effects on 
concentrations of pneumococcal polysaccharide -binding antibodies by [CONTACT_6428]33,36 2.) treatment effects 
on absolute numbers and phenotypes of circulating B -cells by [CONTACT_4133],8 and 3.)  Adv erse event 
comparisons.  
 
Secondary endpoint  #1. (anti -pneumococcal antibodies) and #2. (B -cells) will be assessed among 
blood specimens obtained prior to treatment, and at 1, 3, 5, and 7 months after treatment starts.   
Secondary endpoint #3 (AE) will be a ssessed at each clinic visit, telephone encounter and in 
communications initiated by [CONTACT_592606].   
 
a.) Pneumococcal polysaccharide -binding antibody concentrations  in plasma will be measured 
pre-treatment, and compared to results at the aforementioned intervals after treatment started .  The 
ELISA methodology is straightforward, highly standardized, and fully detailed previously.36  
 
b.) B-cell numbers and phenotypes  will be a ssessed at the same time -points. Method -ologies are 
also well established and have been previously detailed.8 In brief, B -cells will be stained with panels of 
fluorochrome -conjugated monoclonal antibodies and characterized by [CONTACT_4133].  B -lymphocytes 
will be identified as CD3-/CD14-/CD16-/CD19+ cells, and further stratified for comparisons as transitional 
(IgD+/CD38++),  IgM+ IgA- IgG- switched memory (IgD+/CD27+), IgG+ switched memory (IgD-/CD27+/-), 
and plasmablasts (CD19lo/+, CD20-, CD38++, IgD-, CD27++).8   
 
c.) Adverse Events : The NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Scale will be used to define grades (severity) 
of adverse events and toxicities.  An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a 
subject, regardless of its relationship to these treatments. Toxicity i s an adverse event with a direct 
relationship to the study drug.  All toxicities are adverse events, but not all adverse events are toxicities.  
Case report forms (CRF) will require responses to all adverse events (and negatives), with a particular 
focus o n allergic reactions,  infections (including location and organism), and neuropsychiatric 
symptoms.  Recording adverse events in pre -specified checklists (and free text entries) in all subjects 
will guard against unintended bias.   
  
2.7.3 Other Measures th at are not a Formal End -Point:  Carotid artery ultrasounds (US) will 
be obtained in participants at baseline evaluations and at the conclusion of formal 
observations (day 210), in order to determine carotid intimal medial thicknesses (IMT).  
We do not beli eve there is a high likelihood there will be a significant treatment effect, 
given the small number of participants and short duration of therapy in this exploratory 
trial.  Nonetheless, these tests will establish the feasibility of using these assays in 
subsequent larger and longer trials to examine effects of autoantibody reduction in COPD  
patients.  
 
 
2.8 DATA AND POWER ANALYSES  
 
2.8.1 Primary Endpoint Data  Analyses :  
 
BOTEGA  V.2.5 , June 19, 2020                                                                                                              Steven R. Duncan, MD

 Baseline demographic and clinical data of participants will be summarized using means (with standard 
deviations) and medians (with inter -quartile ranges) for continuous variables, and counts and 
percentages for discrete variables, stratified by [CONTACT_1570].  Differences among groups (to 
examine the randomization effectiveness), wi ll be assessed by t -tests, or by [CONTACT_3493]’s exact test for 
discrete data , recognizing the limited power of our small trial.  
  
Repeated measures linear mixed models will be used to evaluate differences of immunological 
parameters (continuous variables) that c omprise the primary , and most  second endpoints.  These 
models will track the changes over time as well as allow for missing observations, which should be 
minimal.  In general, analyses will follow intention to treat principles, with the last observed outco me 
over all time points being used as the primary measure for a given variable.   
 
The sample size of [ADDRESS_781641] clinical efficacy (e.g., change 
in pulmonary function tests, reductions in ac ute exacerbations, etc.) will  almost certainly require 
treatment of many subjects over prolonged periods.  
 
With these limitations in mind, we can assume  belimumab effects in COPD  patients are similar to 
those  among patients  with SLE.  Thus, we can expect to see reductions of anti -GRP78 autoantibody 
concentrations by ~30%, in addition to  ~50% reductions of several circulating B -cell subpopulations , 
by [CONTACT_592607] [ADDRESS_781642] to the primary endpoint (reduction of anti -
GRP78 IgG): If the true difference in the experimental and control means is 30%, with st andard 
deviation s that are  two–thirds of this (20%), we will need to study [ADDRESS_781643] the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control 
groups are equal , with probability (power) 0. 8.   The Type I error probability associated with this test of 
the null hypothesis is 0.05.   
 
The 2:1 experimental arm:  control enrollment will increase the amount of data regarding effects and 
safety of this drug in COPD  patients, and only increases the necessary subject number to reach 80% 
power by [CONTACT_1192], compared to 1:1 enrollment.  
 
2.8.2 Secondary Endpoint Data Analyses :  Analyses will again follow intention to treat principles, 
with the last observed outcome over all time points being used as the primary measure for a given 
variable.  Multiple imputation will be used based on subject characteristics to assess the obvious  
issues with last observation s carried forward in these analyses.  Trajectories over time, for a given 
patient and outcome measure, will be displayed via line graphs, and assessments conducted using 
linear mixed models on the repeated time points.  Compari sons between the treatment arms of the 
polysaccharide binding assay concentrations and B -cell parameters at various time  points will be 
made using  repeated measures techniques. Transformations of these tests may be needed, such as 
velocities, if many indiv iduals are unable to complete the entire treatment protocol.  The proportion of 
subjects with adverse events and the count of adverse events per subject will be compared by 
[CONTACT_592608]’s exact test and the exact Poisson tests, respectively.  
 
 
2.8.3 Interim Analysis : Since the primary endpoint of this trial is a laboratory test and surrogate 
biomarker, rather than a clinical outcome parameter, and the subject number is small, no interim 
analysis will be conducted for efficacy.

 2.9 ANTICIPATED RESULTS , ALTERNATIVES,  AND PI[INVESTIGATOR_153019]  
 
2.9.1 Specific Aim 1  (Primary Endpoint) .   
 
Specific Aim 1 Anticipated Results :  Based on the known action of belimumab in other disease 
populations,33,[ADDRESS_781644] in experimental arm subjects.   
 
Specific Aim 1 Alternative Experimental Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] : In comparisons to other agents used for 
treatment of autoantibody diseases, belimumab is almost certainly the safest, particularly with 
respect to risks for later infections.23,33,34,[ADDRESS_781645] defense 
antibody titers largely preserved.33 Confirming this happens too in COPD  patients is an important 
secondary endpoint.  Experts with use of belimumab in SLE do not rigorously evaluate their patients 
for infections prior to initiating therapy (e.g., pre -treatment bronchoscopy is no t indicated), nor 
reduce doses with infections other than those that are serious (W. Chatham, personal 
communication).  
 
In contrast, other potential agents, including cyclophosphamide, alemtuzumab and bortezomib, 
experimental anti -CD19 monoclonal antibodie s, other anti -T-cell agents, and rituximab are more 
toxic and far more likely to promote infections (including opportunistic infections).  Moreover, with 
the exception of rituximab, the efficacy of these other, riskier agents for treatment of autoantibody -
mediated autoimmune disorders has not been established.  
    
Specific Aim 1 Potential Pi[INVESTIGATOR_30207] :  Even if the experimental regimen decreases autoantibodies and 
is safe, it is unlikely to reverse the lung destruction, and vascular and other tissue injuries th at 
already afflicted these patients prior to the start of therapy.  Nonetheless, slowing the rate of 
disease progression, particularly for otherwise untreatable morbid or lethal disorders, is still a 
worthwhile goal.    
 
Our subject numbers are small, and this will limit our power to detect small intergroup differences, 
especially if there are biological differences of drug actions within our demographically and 
ethnically heterogeneous study population.  This problem(s) w ill be confounded if there are several 
subject drop -outs due to the development of acute exacerbations, or if they lose interest and quit 
participating.   
 
We have attempted to minimize the potential number of acute exacerbation drop -outs by [CONTACT_592609] (i.e., those who have a history of 
same).  And the UAB LHC has a very good record for retaining trial subjects (approaching 100% in 
several studies).  Furthermore, our data analysis methods should still enable us to make meaningful 
intergroup comparisons if there are subject drop -outs (see Data Analyse s).  
 
The alternative would be to propose a much bigger and more expensive initial trial, in the face of  
having absolutely no prior experience in COPD  patients with this particular agent, or even this 
general approach.  However, this would expose many more subjects to potential risks of the 
experimental intervention, prior to having any indication of effecti veness or safety.  
 
The effectiveness of belimumab in autoimmune COPD  patients is currently unknown, and it is 
conceivable that the autoimmune responses in this lung disease population are actually more 
fulminant, or otherwise more refractory, than those o f SLE patients.  Of course, a rationale for the

25 
 proposed study is to begin to explore  this possibility.  If, for whatever reason(s) COPD  autoimmunity 
is resistant or partially resistant, it will further hinder our ability to find a treatment effect. Based on 
results of clinical trial results in other disease populations, and general biological 
considerations,23,33,34,[ADDRESS_781646] certainly other processes, and other autoantibodies, not -yet-discovered, that may 
also be involved in the development and/or progression of COPD  and its comorbidities.  The 
concurrent presence of diverse autoantibodies is a feature of autoimmune syndromes .38-41 As 
one of many examples, SLE and scleroderma are notable for the presence of particular 
autoantibodies, but >[ADDRESS_781647], o ur data show that GRP78 autoreactivity per se   is 
highl y associated with the presence and severity of COPD  and many of its associated comorbidities 
(Figs.2 -5).  It is implausible to postulate that belimumab will have differential effects on 
concentrations of anti -GRP78 IgG compared to other (if undiscovered) p athogenic autoantibodies.  
Hence, even if other important and yet -to-be-recognized autoantibodies are present, values of our 
already developed and reproducible anti -GRP78 ELISA should change in parallel, and thus these 
results will be a useful generalizabl e measure of the autoantibody changes that occurred during this 
trial.  
 
Admittedly this trial is a high risk endeavor, which is a characteristic of pi[INVESTIGATOR_592571].  
Nonetheless, we believe that voluminous data support the central premise here.  Furthe rmore, the 
enormous individual and public heath burdens that are attributable to these diseases, and their 
refractoriness to currently available medications, mean that the potential rewards of this novel 
therapeutic approach are also very high.   
 
 
2.9.2 Specific Aim 2 (Secondary Endpoints) Anticipated Results and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_592572] 2 Anticipated Results :   
a.) Pneumococcal polysaccharide -binding antibody concentrations :  Based on results of 
analogous studies that examined belimumab effects in other populations (primarily SLE patients), 
we anticipate the experimental treatment will have only modest effects on concentrations of these 
important host defense immunoglobulins .  Proving these antibodies are also minimally, if at all, 
affected in COPD  patients (a novel trial population) is an important element of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  [CONTACT_211366] is an expert with these types of assays and no technical problems are anticipated.  
 
b.) B-cell Effects:   Again, based on analogous literature in SLE populations, we anticipate a 
gradual shift in circulating B -cell phenotypes among the experimental treatment subjects, 
particularly those at the higher doses.  In particular, we anticipate incre ases in proportions of less 
differentiated lymphocytes and corresponding decrements of more differentiated phenotypes.  [CONTACT_211366] is also experienced with these assays and no technical problems are anticipated.       
 
c.) Adverse Events: Based on multiple studies involving thousands of patients treated with 
analogous regimens, we anticipate high -grade adverse events will not be significantly more 
frequent among experimental arm subjects, and the experimental regimen wil l have an acceptable 
risk:benefit ratio.33,34,[ADDRESS_781648] of our small and conservatively biased pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251].  It is conceivable this study will 
show that even carefull y selected and closely observed COPD  patients cannot tolerate any immune

 suppression, even relatively benign belimumab. Even if so, these negative results (albeit 
disappointing) will be highly valuable, given the increasing interest (and seemingly 
increasi ng amount of supportive data and rationale) for therapeutic targeting of the 
autoimmune responses in these diseases .9,10 
 
 
2.10 STUDY TIMELINES AND MILESTONES  
 
Timelines and Milestones :  Infrastructure and regulatory requirements should be completed by <6

Subject 
Recruitments (#)    [ADDRESS_781649] Characteristics : 
The study population will be eighteen  (18) adult patients with COPD  and autoantibodies against 
GRP78.  The subjects will be  recruited from the clinics or registries of the Lung Health Center 
(LHC) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). The trial subjects must provide written 
informed c onsent prior to participation.  Surrogate consent will not be allowed.  No special 
vulnerable populations will be studied.  
 
The demographics of the study population will reflect the characteristics of patients who suffer 
from COPD and are evaluated at at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)  clinics and 
LHC. .  These will be older patients ( COPD  is predominantly a disease of mature and elderly 
individuals).  The ethnicities of the subjects will similarly reflect the demographics of our clinic

within th e GRP78 molecule (aa. 246 -260) that are in the upper three quartiles of values present 
in COPD  patients.   We have discovered that circulating levels of IgG autoantibodies with avidity  
against this  peptide ( GRP78 Peptide 25) are  associated with the magnitude of carotid artery 
intimal medial thickness (IMT) among COPD  patients  (Figure 5 ).  Limiting enrollments to subjects 
with readily detectible autoantibodies (e.g., those with levels in the 25th percentile or above) will 
easily enable us to ascertain if the experimental treatment (belimumab) results in a significant 
reduction of these autoantibodies .

4  RECRUITMENT AND INFORMED CONSENT PROCEDURES  
 
4.1  RECRUITMENT METHODS  
 
Subjects  will be recruited from t he outpatient  population followed at  The Kirklin Clinic and UAB 
LHC.  The primary care physician/clinical care team, who may be study investigators or 
colleagues of the study investigators, will first identify potential research subjects.  The clinician 
investigators will discuss the research project with the potential sub jects.  
 
 
4.2  INFORMED CONSENT PROCEDURES  
 
The consent process will begin via one of two possible pathways:  
   
1) Referral of the prospective participant to the investigators/research coordinator by a physician 
who has knowledge of the proposed researc h, and obtains patient  consent for the research 
team to approach the patient/surrogate.  
 
2) Individuals who have provided signed IRB -approved HIPPA compliant consent for 
participation in c linical trial research registries.   
 
Subjects must provide informed consent  prior to performing any of the study procedures .  The 
information about this study will be given to subjects in language understandable to subjects.  
Only physician investigators will present the study to the potential subjects. The physician 
investigator will verbally present a general outline of the r esearch plan, including inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, to the prospective participant. The consent form, outlining the design of the 
study, will include the risks and benefits of participating, and will be reviewed and the investigator 
will answer any q uestions. Prospective participants may take as much time as required to make 
an informed decision. Written informed consent will be obtained from each participant prior to 
performing any research study procedures.  
 
In addition, older potential study participants whose competency to consent is in question will be 
tested for sufficient comprehension and recall of the information presented. Prospective subjects 
who do not remember the important facts about participation  in the research study after repeated 
testing will not be included in the study. The investigators will also assess whether a participant 
understands experimental procedures over time, including assessment throughout the full duration 
of participation in t he study.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_781655] risks specifically related to the study protocol procedures could include:  
 
Venipuncture:   
Common Risks: temporary, minor discomfort, bruising . 
 
Other Risks: i nfection, bleeding and phlebitis.  
 
Belimumab:  Common risks are temporary and self -limited or treatable with over the counter 
(OTC) medication (e.g., Benadryl, Tylenol).  The common adverse effects reported with 
belimumab include nausea, diarrhea, and fever, as well as hypersensitivity and infusion -site 
reactions.  However, there were few differences  between treatment and placebo patients in the 
monitored clinical trials.  Infusion reactions were reported in 17% (251/1458) and 15% (99/675) 
of patients receiving belimumab and placebo, respectively. Seri ous infusion reactions 
(excluding hypersensitivity reactions) were reported in 0.5% of belimumab patients and 0.4% of 
placebo patients.  
 
Serious infection rates were comparable among drug and placebo cohorts (6.0% and 5.2%, 
respectively). Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) resulting in neurological 
deficits, including fatal cases, has been reported in SLE patients receiving im munosuppressant 
pharmacotherapy, including belimumab.  
 
There were 14 deaths during the controlled period of three clinical trials: 3/675 in placebo, 5/673 
in belimumab 1 mg/kg; 0/111 in belimumab 4 mg/kg, and 6/674 in belimumab 10 mg/kg.  Causes 
of death included infection, cardiovascular disease, and suicide.    
 
There are no known drug interactions, and the only absolute contraindication is a history of 
anaphylaxis to belimumab.   
  
 
5.[ADDRESS_781656] benefit to  the subjects .  
Potential benefits  from the participation in this protocol  include enhanced survival, improved 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], and decreased exacerbation frequency and/or severity. Identification of the 
mechanism(s) mediating these outcomes will facilitate risk -stratification for the se adverse outcomes, 
and development of targeted treatment strategies for the future.   
 
BOTEGA  V.2.[ADDRESS_781657] benefits similar to that available in the clinical se tting.  
 
Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained :  The preliminary data in this application outline a 
hypothesis for the development and/or progression of COPD  and associated comorbidities .  The 
protocol specifically seeks to address that hypothesis.  If the study intervention is found to be both 
safe and effective in the study population, the treatment of these patients  would be altered 
significantly, and ultimately could lead to a change in the disease natural history.  Completion of 
these protocols will begin to address important questions related to COPD  and associated disease s. 
 
 
5.[ADDRESS_781658] Loss of Confidentiality   
 
All research interventions/activities will be conducted in private patient care areas. The collection 
of sensitive information about subjects is limited to the amount necessary to achieve the aims of 
the research, so that no unneeded sensitive information is being coll ected.  
 
To avoid any violation of subject confidentiality, all data will be stored in a password -protected 
database  as well as Case Report Forms (CRFs) , identified only by  [CONTACT_32221] .   A 
confidential database linking patient identifying information w ith study ID number will b e 
maintained by [CONTACT_7676] .   
 
All demographic and clinical information about the subject will be stored in a secured study 
database under the supervision of the PIs for this protocol. All staff will sign confidentiality 
statements.  
 
Specimens will be stripped of subject identifiers and stored according to a similar coding protocol 
as described above. These specimens will be stored safely in the custod y of the PIs responsible 
for the individual assays. These Investigators will limit future access to any remaining sample to 
only those investigators with prior IRB approval for their studies.  
 
The PIs will retain the data for the entire period of this study. The investigators may continue to 
use and disclose subjects de -identified inform ation for the purpose of this study for a minimum of 
seven years after final reporting or publication of the study. If the subject and/or legal 
representative decide to withdraw or be withdrawn from study participation, they may request 
that the study data  and samples be destroyed.  
 
All staff involved in this study are properly credentialed and instructed in the areas of testing, 
confidentiality, and safety.  All principal and co -investigators, coordinators, and other Key 
Personnel are required to participa te in courses and be certified as mandated by [CONTACT_592613]’  protections .

5.6. ADVERSE EVENTS :  
 
5.6.1. Definition of an Adverse Event:  
 
An adverse event (AE) is a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product.  
 
Note: An AE can therefore  be any u nfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal product.  For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to 
produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse.  
 
Events meeting the definition of an AE include:  
 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in 
frequency and/or  intensity of the condition  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it 
may have been present prior to  the start of the study  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of  a suspected overdose of either study treatment 
or a concomitant  medication (overdose per se will not be reported  as an AE/SAE) unless this 
is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent.  This should  be 
reported  regardless of sequelae  
 “Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be reported as 
an AE or SAE. However, the signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of 
efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the definiti on of an AE or SAE  
 
Events that do not  meet the definition of an AE include:  
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads to 
the procedure is an AE  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (s ocial and/or convenience 
admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen  
• The disease/disorder being studied , or expected progression, s igns, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s condition  
 
5.6.[ADDRESS_781663] medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
 
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
NOTE:  The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death,  if it were more severe.  
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51809]:  In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472256] (usually 
involving at least  an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or  
treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting.  
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85299].  If a complication prolon gs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_592574], the event is serious.  When in doubt as to 
whether “ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63336] a pre -existing conditi on that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE  
d. Results in disability/incapacity, or  
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substanti al disruption  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
f. Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised  in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result  in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_592575].  These should also be considered serious.  Examples of such 
events are invasive  or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956],  or development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
g. All events of possible drug -induced  liver injury (see Section 5.6.5 ) with hyperbilirubinaemia 
defined as ALT  3xULN and bilirubin  2xULN (>35% direct) (or ALT  3xULN and 
INR>1.5,  termed ‘Hy’s Law’  events ( the INR threshold value stated will not apply to patients 
receiving anticoagulants)  
Laboratory and Other Safety Assessment Abnormalities Reported as AEs and SAEs  
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety 
assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that 
worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgement 
of the investigator are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs.  However,  any clinically significant safety 
assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_592619]’s condition, are not to be reported as AEs or 
SAEs.  
BOTEGA  V.2.[ADDRESS_781664] be followed up to determine outcome (including premat ure termination) and 
status of mother and child.  Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical 
reasons must be reported as an AE or SAE.  Spontaneous abortions must be reported  as an 
SAE.  
 
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy,  brought to the investigator’s attention after 
the subject has completed the study and considered by [CONTACT_592620], must be reported to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours  of learning of its occurrence . 
 
The National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Scale will be used to define grades 
(severity) of adverse events and toxicities.  An adverse event is any untoward medical 
occurrence in a participant who received study drug, regardless of its relatio nship to the study 
drug.  Toxicity is an adverse event with a direct relationship to the study drug.  All toxicities are 
adverse events, but not all adverse events are toxicities.  This is a determination made by [CONTACT_96908].  The study investig ators will classify adverse events as “definitely or most 
likely,” “possibly,” or “very unlikely” due to the study drug.  Toxicity will be defined as an adverse 
event that is definitely, most likely, or possibly caused by [CONTACT_5257].  
 
The severity of a dverse changes in physical signs or symptoms will be classified as follows:  
 
• Grade 1 (Mild) : asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observation only; 
intervention not indicated . 
 
• Grade 2 (Moderate) : minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appreciate instrumental ADL (Activities of Daily Living) . 
 
• Grade 3 (Severe) : medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self care 
ADL.  
 
• Grade 4 (Life -threatening) : consequences; urgent intervention indicated . 
 
• Grade 5 (Death ): event is a direct cause of death.  
 
Assuring patient safety is an essential component of this protocol.  The contact [CONTACT_976]  [INVESTIGATOR_592576].  The study investigators will 
evaluate all adverse eve nts.  All subjects who have adverse event s, whether considered 
associated with the use of the study medication or not, must be monitored to determine the 
outcome.   
 
All untoward medical occurrences observed in s ubjects  will be recorded on the participants’ 
adverse event CRF by [CONTACT_592621] a  PI, with a particular focus 
on infections (including location an d organism) , metabolic or hemodynamic perturbations (e.g., 
hyperglycemia, hypotensi on, etc.) , liver function test abnormalities,  and other, less frequent 
complications (e.g., neurologic  and psychiatric  symptoms), as well as having provision for free 
text entries.  Recording all adverse event s in pre -specified checklists (and free text en tries), will 
guard against unintended bias.  The CRFs will then be reviewed for completeness and internal

The clinical course of the adverse event  will be followed up according to accepted standards of 
medical practice, even after the end of the period of observation, until a satisfactory explanation 
is fou nd or the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_592577] -up. 
 
The PI s will work with the coordinator(s)  to prepare a detailed written summary of serious, 
unexpected, and treatment related adverse events, and will compare, and contrast the event with 
prior events. The detailed written s ummary will be provided to the DSMB,  IRB, and spon sor.  
 
In add ition, the DSMB Report addressing  the following information will be submitted to the IRB at 
the time of continuing review ann ually or more often as required.  
 
 
5.6.3 Adverse Events Reporting Timeline  
 
The investigators or site staff are respon sible for detecting, documenting and reporting events 
that meet the definition of an AE or SAE.   AEs will be collected from the start of study treatment 
and until the follow up contac t.  SAEs will be collected over the same time period as stated 
above for AEs. However, any SAEs assessed as related  to study participation (e.g., study 
treatment, protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or 
related to a [COMPANY_004] concomitant medication, will be recorded from the time a subject consents to 
participate in the study up to and  including any follow up  contact.  
 
The investigators will report life -threatening or fatal unexpected adverse events associated with 
the use of the study drug or procedures to the DSMB , and the IRB within 24 hours of discovery 
of the incident with subsequ ent follow -up submission of a detailed written report.  
 
All SAE will be reported via email notification within 24 hours of awareness  to the following 
sponsor ([COMPANY_004]) contacts including:  
1) ISS Chairperson

safety of subjects as well as the integrity and confidentiality of their data.  
 
• An evaluation of the progress of the research study, including subject recruitment and 
retention, and an assessment of the timeliness and quality of the data.  
 
• A review of collected data (including adverse events, unanticipated problems, and subject 
withdr awals) to determine whether there is a change to the anticipated benefit -to-risk 
assessment of study participation and whether the study should continue as originally 
designed, should be changed, or should be terminated.  
 
• An assessment of external factors or relevant information (eg. Pertinent scientific 
literature reports or therapeutic development, results of related studies) that may have an 
impact on the safety and study participants or the ethics of the research study.  
 
• A review of study procedures des igned to protect the privacy of the research subjects and 
the confidentiality of their research data.  
 
 
5.6.[ADDRESS_781670] recruitment, data 
coding and retention, documentation and identification of adverse events , complaints , and 
confidentiality of subjects. There will be an evaluation of the progress of the research study, 
including assessments of data quality, time lines, participant recruitment, accrual, and reten tion. 
The PIs  will also review the outcome and a dverse event data to determine whether there is any 
change to the anticipated benefit -to-risk ratio of study participation and whether the study should 
continue as originally designed or should it be re -evaluated and changed.  
 
 
6. STUDY ADMINSTRATION  
 
6.1 REGULATORY AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
The clinical study will be conducted  in accordance with the IRB-approved clinical protocol; 
International C onference of Harmonization (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice,  and 
relevant policies, requirements, and regulations of the IRB s, and applicable federal regulations,  
including those required under an IND exemption.  
 
The clinical trial will be registered with ClinicalTrials.gov to comply with Section [ADDRESS_781671] s for continued participation in the clinical study.  
 
 
6.2  PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT  
 
6.2.1 Activation of a p rotocol  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_79761]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_592580], development, and approval of the 
protocol as well as its subseq uent amendments, and reporting serious adverse event s, violations 
and deviations per IRB guidelines . 
 
To meet these requirements, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_79761] -PI [INVESTIGATOR_592581]:  
 
• Commit to the provision that the protocol will not be rewritten or modified by [CONTACT_592622] . 
• Ensure that th ere is only one version of the p rotocol .  
• Oversee the development of data collection forms ( case report forms) .  
 
 
6.[ADDRESS_781672] protection, study procedures, laboratory, study in tervention 
administration, and data collection processes are of high quality and meet GCP and, when 
appropriate, regulatory guidelines, the DSMB and/or sponsor  may conduct a quality assurance 
audit (site monitoring) of the site records at any time during or after completion of the study.  Audits 
of a random selection of data, and all protocol consents will also be reviewed.   
 
Monitoring will be  scheduled periodically throughout the conduct of the study to assure comp liance 
with the approved protocol, and to verify the completeness and accuracy of study data.  Monitoring 
also aids in identifying any research -related problems for the investigator to correct.  A brief written 
report on each audit or site visit will be prepared by [CONTACT_592623](s) and sent to the sponsor, DSMB, 
and PIs  after each site visit.  
 
 
6.[ADDRESS_781673] -KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
 
6.7.1 Data recording/Case Report Forms     
 
Case report forms (CRFs) are the primary data collection instruments for the study.  All data 
requested on the CRFs must be recorded, and any missing data must be explained.  If a space is 
left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was n ot asked, “N/D” must be noted.  
If the item is not applicable to the individual case “N/A” must be noted.  All entries must be printed 
legibly in black ink on the paper case report forms.  In the event of any entry errors, corrections 
must be made by [CONTACT_592624] a single straight line  through the incorrect entry, writing  the initials of the 
person making the correction, recording the date  when the correction is being made, and entering 
the correct da ta above the strike through.    
 
Data elements that are extrac ted from the medical record (such as participant history or official 
clinical interpretations of images, pathology, or surgery results) and recorded on the case report 
forms (CRFs) will be audited against the appropriate component of the medical record.  The 
investigator will review, approve and sign/date each completed CRF; the investigator’s signature 
[CONTACT_57322]’s responsibility for ensuring that all clinical and 
laboratory data entered on the CRF are complete, accurate and  authentic.   
 
Source Data  are the clinical findings and observations, laboratory and test data, and other 
information contained in Source Documents .  Source Documents are the original records (and 
certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_63062]); including, but not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_38109],  
physician or office charts, physician or nursing notes, subject diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, re corded data from automated instruments, x -rays, etc.  
Information recorded on the CRF must be consistent with the Source Data  recorded on the 
Source Documents  or discrepancies must be explained.  
 
Source data are found in all information, original records o f findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source 
data are contained in source documents.  Source documents represent the first recording of any 
observations made or data  generated about a study participant while he or she is enrolled in a 
clinical trial. Source documents for each study participant substantiate the  data that are 
submitted in the CRF.  
 
If data is abstracted from medical charts that are not filed at the inve stigative sites (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_257066]), copi[INVESTIGATOR_592582].  However, every attempt 
must be made to obtain all records/charts that were used to abstract any study data for this 
BOTEGA  V.2.[ADDRESS_781674] not be identified  on the CRF by [CONTACT_2300].  Appropriate coded 
identifications (i.e. Subject ID number) will be used. Every effort will be made to collect complete 
data for each study visit. Causes of missing data  will be fully documented. With respect to safety 
evaluation, it i s not planned to impute missing data.  
 
6.7.[ADDRESS_781675] be easily accessibl e when needed (e.g., for  audit s or 
regulatory inspection s) and must be available for review in conjunction with assessment of the 
facility, supporting systems, and relevant site staff.  
 
Where permitted by [CONTACT_1207]/regulations or institutional policy, some or all of the records may 
be maintained in a format other than hard copy (e.g., microfiche, scanned, electronic); however, 
caution must be exercised before such action is taken. The investigator must ensure that all 
reproductions are legible and are a true and accur ate copy of the original. In addition, they must 
meet accessibility and retrieval standards, including regeneration of a hard copy, if required. The 
investigator must also ensure that an acceptable back -up of the reproductions exists and that 
there is an a cceptable quality control procedure in place for creating the reproductions.  
 
The minimum retention time will meet the strictest  standard applicable , as dictated by [CONTACT_306067]/regulations, and/or institutional requirements.

OBJECTIVE:  
The objective of this  insertion study is to evaluate potential surface refractive index shifts and/or 
surface water content changes of kalifilcon A  lenses compared to Dailies  Total  1, Precision  1 and 
Biotrue ONEday  lenses . 
 
STUDY DESIGN:  
Approximately [ADDRESS_544186] lens wearing subjects will be enrolled in this unilateral, 
randomized, double -masked  (subject and investigator masked)  repeated measures insertion  study. 
All subjects will be seen for a Screening/Dispensing Visit at which informed consent will be 
obtained and eligibility will be assessed. If subjects satisfy all eligibility criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, sub jects will insert study  lenses in random, successive order according to unique 
randomization schedules that will be provided to each Investigator.  
 
SUBJECTS:  
Approximately [ADDRESS_544187] ELIGIBILITY:  
Inclusion Criteria:  
To be eligible for entry into the study, the subject must:  
1. Be [ADDRESS_544188] signed a statement of informed consent.  
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
The subject is not eligible to part icipate in the study if the subject is:  
1. Participating in a conflicting study in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689].  
2. Considered by [CONTACT_145912] a suitable candidate for participation.  
 SUBJECT DISCONTINUATION:  
The Investigator may discontinue a subject during the study for any reason if, in his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it 
is in the best interest of the subject. Reasons for discontinuation include but are not limited to:  
• adverse effects  
• other ocular complications  
• subject non- compliance  
• subject request

All contact [CONTACT_430208] -3.00D or closest marketed power available.  
 Masking:  
This will be a double masked  (subject and investigator)  study.  
 Test Article Accountability:  
All test materials  will be accounted for on the Clinical Trial Materials Form and Lens /Solution  
Tracking Form. Subjects must return all remaining study materials to the Investigator at the final 
study visit, or their exit visit if discontinued prior to this visit.  
 
METHODOLOGY:  
Visits 1 -4 
 
 Each subject will wear one of the four lens types in a randomly determined order in the study 
eye for each timepoint of 5, 10 and 15 minutes . A new lens will be inserted for each timepoint.  
 The worn lenses for each subject will be measured for surface refractive index on the refractometer . 
 For subsequent visits, the above procedures will be repeated for the remaining study lens  
types  accordin g to the randomization schedule for a total of 4 visits. Additional visits may be 
required for scheduling purposes.

The justification for this  insertion study is to evaluate potential surface refractive index shifts and/or 
surface water content changes of kalifilcon A  lenses compared to Dailies Total  1, Precision [ADDRESS_544189] full legal capacity to volunteer; no restrictions are made as to gender.  
 With contact [CONTACT_430209] (swelling of the cornea) which may temporarily affect vision or comfort, neovascularization (small blood vessels growing into the cornea), giant papi[INVESTIGATOR_145902] (small bumps on the inside of the eyelids), iritis (internal inflammation in the eye), corneal infiltrates  (corneal inflammation) and corneal 
erosion/abrasion or corneal infection, which if untreated may cause ocular problems. 
 ADVERSE EVENTS:  
Adverse effects arising in this study will be handled and reported according to applicable Research 
Clinic procedures. Subjects who experience an adverse event during study participation will be 
discontinued from study participation but will be followed by [CONTACT_430210] i mprovement is not expected.  
 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:  
Randomization:  
Subjects will be assigned subject  numbers se quentially as they are enrolled .  Lens types will be 
presented to subjects in a random order, according to a unique randomization schedule produced 
prior to study enrollment. 
 Statistical Analysis: 
Continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics: n, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum and maximum.  Unless otherwise noted, paired t tests will be used to test for differences in means for each of the parametric dependent variables.   Differences at the p < 0.05 
level are considered to be statistically significant and difference p <0.10 but >0.05 will be 
considered a statistical trend.  
 STUDY MONITORING:  
 The study will be monitored according to applicable Research Clinic procedures.

STUDY TERMINATION:  
Should the Investigator and/or study requester wish to terminate the study, applicable Research Clinic 
procedures will be followed.  PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS:  
If there are changes to this study after initial IRB approval which impact subject safety or are 
significant study design changes, they will be documented in a protocol amendment and submitted for IRB approval prior to implementation.

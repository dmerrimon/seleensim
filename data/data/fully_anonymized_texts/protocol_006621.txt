 2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Background 
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory immune- mediated  skin disease, characteri zed by [CONTACT_169172][INVESTIGATOR_13403], usually presenting as red, scaly patches, papules or plaques (plaque psoriasis). 
(Rendon and Schäkel, 2019). The prevalence of psoriasis in the US is approximately 2 to 3% 
(World Health  Organization [ WHO] , 2016).  
The pathogenesis of psoriasis is complex involving the interplay of genetic and environmental factors, resulting in a dysregulated immune response involving T helper (Th) type 1 and Th17 
cells ( Polese et al ., 2020 ). Interleukin (IL)-23 and IL -12 are believed to key cytokines in the 
immune -pathogenesis o f psoriasis. In response to the release of IL -23, activated T cells migrate 
from the dermis to epi[INVESTIGATOR_169152] -17, which causes proliferation of 
keratinocytes and the classic inflammatory lesions of psoriasis ( Zeng et al ., 2017). The clinical 
relevance of these cytokine pathways for moderate  to severe psoriasis  has been established by 
[CONTACT_169173]-approved targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169153] (anti- IL-12/23) and 
secukinumab(anti-IL17). The pathogenic effect of the IL -23/IL -17 axis is mediated by [CONTACT_169174]/ signal transducers and a ctivators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway ( Winthrop, 2017).   
The search for effective small molecules to block JAK/STAT signaling led to the discovery of 
tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitors (Nogueira, Puig et al. 2020). TYK2 signaling pathways include the central cytokines IL -12 and IL-23. Impor tantly, TYK2 has also been validated as a 
therapeutic target in psoriasis by [CONTACT_68058] T YK2 inhibitors  and particularly from positive Phase 3 
studies with deucravacitinib ( [COMPANY_016], 2021). Based on available clinical data it 
appears these inhibitors’ specificity for T YK2  avoids the safety liabilities of J AK inhibitors. 
Although these findings are encouraging, considerable unmet need remains for patients with psoriasis and E SK-[ADDRESS_197522] 2022

 Risk -Benefit Assessment  
ESK -001 is being developed as an oral treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis. Based on the 
mechanism of action of E SK-001, the likelihood of benefit for patients enrolled in this study is 
expected to be high since substantial clinical efficacy has already been demonstrated by [CONTACT_169175] , i.e., inhibition of TYK2  (Papacharalambous et al., 
2020; Papp et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, patients will be offered the opportunity to receive 
ESK-[ADDRESS_197523] been generally 
well tolerated and with an acceptable safety profile. Based on ESK -001’s high specificity for 
TYK2 , the safety concerns associated wit h JAK inhibition are considered to have been reduced. 
In addition, a safety monitoring committee will be convened, including a c ardiologist, to oversee 
overall patient safety, including the potential for adverse events associated with JAK inhibition.  
Take n together the overall benefit- risk assessment is favorable and supports this  Phase [ADDRESS_197524] 2022

 5.4. Lifestyle Restrictions  
5.4.1. Dietary Restrictions  
Foods such as star fruit juice, Seville orange juice, and grapefruit juice that are strong to 
moderate inhibitors of P450 (CYP) 3A4 should be avoided. 
Study drug can be taken with or without food. 
5.4.2. Highly Effective Contraception  
Highly effective methods of birth control are defined as those which result in a low failure rate 
(i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly.  
For female patients - WOCBP:  
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: 
o Oral 
o Intravaginal  
o Transdermal  
• Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: 
o Oral 
o Injectable  
o Implantable  
Note: Hormonal contraception must be supplemented with a nother form of contraception 
that may include but is not limited to  another form of highly effective contraception (e.g. , 
IUD) or other barrier method s (such as male condom plus spermicide or female 
diaphragm ). 
• Intrauterine device (IU D) 
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal ligation  
• Vasectomi zed partner. Note that a vasectomi zed partner is a highly effective birth control 
method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential trial patient and that the vasectomi zed partner has received medical assessment 
of the surgical success.  
• Sexual ab stinence. Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if the 
subject is refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the subject.  
• Same sex partner

 Study Drug Accountability  
The Investigator or his/he r designated representatives will dispense study drug per the Schedule 
of Assessments (see Section 1.3). 
The Investigator is responsible for the control of drugs under investigation. Ade quate records of 
the receipt  (e.g., Drug Receipt Record) and disposition (e.g., Investigation Drug Dispensing Log) 
of the study drug must be maintained . The Investigation Drug Dispensing Log must be kept 
current and should contain the following information: 

Alumis Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
ESK- 001-[ADDRESS_197545] 2022 
 • The identification (ID) if the patient to whom the study drug was dispensed (that is, 
patient ID number and  year of birth)  
• The date(s), quantity, and lot number(s) of the study drug dispensed to the patient  
• The ID of the person who dispense the study drug  
All used and unused drug supplies must be returned by [CONTACT_169177]. 
All records and used and unused drug supplies must be available for inspection by [CONTACT_169178]. Reconciliation of all drug supplies (ESK -001 or placebo) will 
be performed by [CONTACT_11200].  
6.5. Destruction of Study Drug  
When the study is complete d, the Investigator will destroy or return to the Sponsor any used and 
unused study drug (e.g., empty, partially used, and unused containers), to the Sponsor as 
requested . Copi[INVESTIGATOR_169155](s) will be 
returned to the Sponsor. The Investigator’s copy of the Drug Return Record(s) must accurately 
document the return or destruction of all drug supplies to the Sponsor. 
Local or ins titutional regulations may require immediate destruction of used study drug for 
safety reasons. In these cases, it may be acceptable for investigational study center staff to destroy dispensed study drug before a monitoring inspection, provided that source document 
verification is performed on the remaining inventory and reconciled against the documentation of 
quantity shipped, dispensed, returned, and destroyed, and provided that adequate storage and 
integrity of drug has been confirmed. Written authorization must be obtained from the Sponsor 
or Sponsor designees after final accountability prior to destruction.  
Unused study drug from the site that has not been stored properly should not be destroyed until 
the monitor and/or Sponsor approve the destruction. 
Written documentation of destruction must contain the following: 
• Identity of study drug destroyed 
• Quantity of study drug destroyed  
• Date of destruction 
• Method of destruction 
• Name [CONTACT_169207] 
6.6. Patient  Ident ification and Randomization Procedure  
All screened patient s are assigned unique identification number. Screen ed patient s who drop out 
of the clinical study before randomization will retain their unique identification number. Blister card wallets will provide blinded serial numbers for allocation using randomization 
through an interactive voice/web response system (I xRS) or equivalent process of distribution of 
the study drug throughout the duration of the study. Patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1:1  one 
of the 6 treatment arms ( 5 dose levels of ESK-001, placebo). 
Alumis Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
ESK- 001-[ADDRESS_197546] 2022 
 Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_169171]. A permuted 
block randomization scheme will be used to obtain approximately a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio among the 
treatment arms within each stratum.   
6.7. Blinding and Emergency Unblinding  
ESK-001 tablets  and placebo- to-match ESK -001 tablets will be matched for shape, size and 
color. 
Study drug assignment for each patient will not be disclosed to the Investigator, study center 
personnel, patients, or the Sponsor or representatives on the clinical study team. Study site 
personnel will remain blinded throughout the entirety of the study.  
If at any time during the study a decision about a patient’s medical condition requires knowledge 
of the treatment assignment, the study blind may be broken by [CONTACT_079], 
(through the IxRS), for that specific patient only. If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], there is no impact on patient safety, the Investigator is strongly encouraged to contact [CONTACT_1034]’s 
Medical Monitor prior to unblinding . The reason for unblinding must be documented in the IxRS 
or appropriate study documentation. 
At the study site, only the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_169156]. If, in the Invest igator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], and for the safety of the patient other study site personnel are required to be aware of 
the treatment assignment, the Investigator will contact [CONTACT_1034]’s Medical Monitor prior to further unblinding and ensure that the minimum number of personnel are informed.  
The SMC must be informed by [CONTACT_1034]’s Medical Monitor of any case of unblinding. 
Additionally, the SMC may unblind individual treatment assignment for further safety evaluation at their discretion.  
6.8. Administration of Study Drug  
The study site staff will administer a dose of study drug to each patient on Day 1 (first dose), and 
on the Week 4, 8, and [ADDRESS_197547]   
After completion of the Week 16 End -of-Study (EOS) Visit, Patients will be eligible to receive 
extended open- label treatment with ESK -001 by [CONTACT_7624] a separate open-label extension 
(OLE) study (Protocol No. ESK -001-007). To participate in this OLE study patients must have 

Alumis Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
ESK- 001-[ADDRESS_197548] 10 years.  
Antiviral Medications  
Based on in vitro assessments, ESK -001 has the potential for drug- drug interaction with antiviral 
medications metabolized through CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and P-gp pathways (eg, Paxlovid [nirmatrelvir + ritonavir]). Co -administration with ESK -[ADDRESS_197549] the systemic exposure 
levels of antiviral medications or ESK -001. The benefit:risk assessment for administration of 
anti-viral medications with a narrow  therapeutic index should be discussed with the medical 
monitor whenever possible.   
Acid Reducing Agents  
The use of Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are not permitted on study due to the potential to 
decrease ESK -001 exposure.  However, the use of H2 blocker s (e.g., famotidine or ranitidine) 
and calcium carbonate -containing antacids (eg, Tums
 or Rolaids) are allowed during the study 
but should be taken at least 2 hours after a dose of study drug. 
6.12.1. Allowed Vaccinations  
Inactivated vaccines (including but not limited to COVID -19 vaccines and boosters) will be 
allowed while on study. The study site should follow local guidelines related to COVID-19. 
6.12.2. Prohibited Medications  
Medication and treatment restrictions applicable before the dosing period are listed as exclusion 
criteria in Section  5.3. These restrictions are applicable for the duration of the study and are

 7. DISCONTINUATION 
7.1. Discontinuation of the Study or Site  
The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study at any time. Reasons for terminating the study 
may include, but are not limited to:  
• Incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicating a potential 
safety risk to patients.  
• Unsatisfactory patient recruitment e.g. , excessively slow  
• Poor protocol adherence 
• Incomplete or inaccurate data recording  
• Poor compliance with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines 
for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
In any instance of early discontinuation of the study, the Sponsor will notify, in writing, the investigators, regulatory authorities and ethics committees, and will specify the reason(s) for termination.  
7.2. Study  Drug D iscontinuation 
Patients  should discontinue study drug for any of the following reasons: 
• Malignancy, not including local and non- serious basal, squamous cell skin cancer or 
ductal carcinoma in situ  
• Pregnancy 
• Anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid or serious hypersensitivity react ion 
• Use of any medication, intended to chronically treat psoriasis (refer to Section  6.12.2), 
other than those documented at screening 
• Adverse event which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_169157]  
• Patient  is noncompliant with study requirements 
The date and reason for discontinuation should be documented in the eCRF. 
Patients  who discontinue study drug should continue in the study to complete all scheduled 
assessments.  
Those patients who are unwilling or unable to complete all remaining study assessments should 
return to the study site 2 weeks (±  7 days) after the date study drug was discontinued, to 
complete the early study termination  assessments (ET Visit). 
Alumis Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
ESK- 001-[ADDRESS_197552] 2022 
 7.3. Discontinuation of Individual Patients  
Reasons for patient discontinuation from the study may include but are not limited to any of the 
following reasons:  
• Patient withdrawal of consent  
• Discretion of the Investigator, if it is deemed not safe, or in the patient’s best interest, to continue 
• SMC recommendation  
• Patient is lost to follow -up 
The date and reason for discontinuation should be documented in the eCRF.  
Patien ts who discontinue the study should return to the site to complete the early study 
termination assessments (ET Visit) within 2 weeks (± 7 days) from the date of discontinuation.  
If a patient discontinues the study without notifying the Investigator, every effort should be made 
to contact [CONTACT_169179].  If documented attempts to contact [CONTACT_169180], and a reason for the patient’s discontinuation is undiscoverable, a patient can be declared as "lost 
to follow up" at the end of the study. All efforts to contact [CONTACT_169181].

 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
For timing of assessments, refer to the  Schedule of Assessments ( SOA) in Section 1.3.  
8.1. Eligibility Screening  
Informed consent will be obtained at Screening before performing any study procedures. 
Patients will undergo Screening assessments, including, but not limited to blood sampling, ECG, 
clinical assessment and various QoL assessments . Patients may be rescreened once no sooner 
than 2 weeks after an initial screen failure  after discussion with the medical  monitor. 
Medical  and medication history as well as demographic data, including biological sex, age, race, 
body weight (kg) and height (cm) will be recorded.  
8.2. Efficacy Assessments  
8.2.1. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index   
Disease activity will be assessed by [CONTACT_169182] (PASI) at the 
timepoints indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (see Section 1.3). The PASI system derives a score for the severity of psoriatic lesions by [CONTACT_169183], induration, and scaling in 
each of 4 body regions, as detailed in Appendix A . The primary and secondary endpoints are 
based on the PASI response at the end of treatment (12 -week timepoint).  
8.2.2. Psoriasis Body Surface Area  
Measurement of psoriasis body surface area (BSA)  involvement is estimated using the handprint 
method with the size of a patient’s handprint representing ~1% of body surface area involved. 
The total BSA = 100% with breakdown by [CONTACT_82756]: head and neck = 10% (10 handprints), upper extremities = 20% (20 handprints), trunk including axillae and groin = 30% 
(30 handprints), lower extremities including buttocks = 40% (40 handprints). BSA assessments 
should be performed by a dermatologist or appropriately trained investigator who is experienced in the assessment of psoriasis patients.  
8.2.3. Physician’s Global Assessment  
Patients will be assessed by [CONTACT_169184]’s Global Assessment (sPGA)  at the timepoints 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (see Section 1.3 ). Appendix B  presents the scoring 
system used for the sPGA.  
8.2.4. Patient -Reported Outcomes  
Quality of life (QoL) will be assessed by [CONTACT_4676] -reported outcomes: the Dermatology  Life 
Quality Index (DLQI ), the EQ -5D, and the pruritus numerical rating scale (NRS) at the 
timepoints indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (see Section 1.3).  The [ADDRESS_197554] regardless of causal attribution.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnorma l laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a n investigational product, 
whether or not it is thought to be related to the investigational product.  
In addition to new events, any increase in the severity or frequency  of a pre -existing condition 
that occurs is considered an AE.  
Only clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities (in the medical opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]) that require active management (e .g., abnormalities that require study drug 
discontinuation, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.) 
should be listed as AEs. See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for more details . 
If the AE constitutes a disease or syndrome (e.g., upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]), only the diagnosis (e .g., upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]) should be recorded as an AE and not the 
individual symptoms (fever, headaches, body aches, runny nose, sore throat, etc .). If an AE is 
due to an inactivated vaccine, the AE together with the etiology should clearly be recorded. 
Other untoward events occurring in the framework of a clinical study will be recorded as AEs, 
e.g., those occurring during treatment-free periods (including Screening or post- treatment 
follow-up periods ) in association with study- related procedures and assessments, or under 
placebo . For study drugs, lack of efficacy may be an expected potential outcome and should not 
be reported as an AE unless the event is unusual in some w ay, e.g., greater in severity. 
Concomitant illnesses:  Medical conditions which existed prior to entry into the clinical study 
will not be considered AEs unless they worsen (frequency or severity) during the treatment period. Pre- existing conditions will be recorded as part of the participant’s medical history. Day 
to day fluctuations of pre-existing disease should not be recorded as an AE on the AE eCRF. 
Disease under study (psoriasis):   Disease related progression and worsening signs or symptoms 
of the disease under study are not AEs and are not to be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF 
unless the even t meets the definition of an SAE or is not consistent with the typi[INVESTIGATOR_169158]’s disease as established by [CONTACT_102]’s medical history.  
Surgical or diagnostic procedures:  For medical or surgical procedures (e.g., colonoscopy, 
biopsy), the medical condition that led to the procedure is an AE. Elective procedures (e.g., 
Alumis Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
ESK- 001-[ADDRESS_197555] 2022 
 vasectomy), planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and procedures for treatment of conditions noted in the 
patient’s medical history tha t have not worsened (e.g., hernia repair) are not considered AEs. 
All reported AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Recording of Adverse Events 
Adverse events should be collected and recorded for each patient f rom the date of the first 
screening/eligibility assessment until the end of their participation in the study, i.e., the patient has discontinued or completed the study. 
Reporting of AEs prior to first dose should only include SAEs or AEs resulting from any 
protocol- related interventions.  
Adverse events are to be recorded on the AE page of  the eCRF . The following information will 
be recorded  at the time the AE is reported and during follow up during the course of the AE: 
• Whether or not the AE is an SAE ( see Section [IP_ADDRESS].1) 
• AE severity using CTCAE criteria ( see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2) 
• AE relationship to study drug ( see Section [IP_ADDRESS].3) 
• Action taken ; including but not limited to, none, study drug dose modification or 
discontinuation, required concomitant medication, required procedure, or other 
• Outcome:  recorded as event resolved, resolved with sequelae, ongoing, or death 
If an adverse event is persistent i.e. continues between various study assessment timepoints 
without resolution it should be recorded only once (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of Adverse Events 
Each AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_169159]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Serious Adverse Event s (SAEs) 
The I nvestigator is responsible for determining whether an AE meets the definition of an SAE . 
An SAE is any AE that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death 
• Life-threatening , i.e., an AE that , in the investigator’s  opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], places the subject at 
immediate risk of death   
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• A persistent or significant disability or incapacity , i.e., a substantial disruption in the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect in a neonate or infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug 
Alumis Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
ESK- 001-[ADDRESS_197556] 2022 
 • Significant medical events that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] I nvestigator, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed in this definition.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Severity  
The severity of an event describes the degree of impact upon  the subject and/or the need for 
medical care necessary to treat the event.  All clinical AEs encountered during the clinical study 
will be reported on the AE page of the eCRF. Severity of AEs will be graded based on a 
modified CTCAE, Version 5.0 and reported in detail as indicated on the eCRF. For any AEs not 
found in the CTCAE, a description of intensity grading can be found below: 
Grade 1 - Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2 - Moderate  Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living.  
Grade 3 - Severe Medically significant but not immediately life- threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self -care activities of 
daily living.  
Grade 4 - Life-threatening  Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5 – Death  Death related to AE  
 
Any change in severity of a persistent AE will be captured by [CONTACT_44745] a new AE with the 
current severity and a start date of when the severity changed. The prior event will be updated 
with a stop date  of when the severity changed. When changes in the severity of an AE occur 
more frequently than once a day, the maximum intensity for the event should be noted for that day.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Relationship to Study Drug  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_169160]/relationship between the study drug and the 
AE. One of the categories described in Table 3  should be selected based on medical judgment, 
considering the definitions below and all contributing factors. 
Table 3 Assessment of Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The Investigator should assess causality by [CONTACT_93498] “related” or “unrelated” to the 
question, “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_169185]?”.   
 
 
Alumis Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
ESK- 001-[ADDRESS_197557] abnormality, with little or no temporal 
relationship with treatment administration .  
 
The following factors may be used in consideration of causality assessment:   
 
• Temporal relationship of the event onset to initiation of study drug  
• Amount and duration of study treatment exposure 
• Course of the event, including consideration for c hallenge/rechallenge:  
◦ Did the event abate after study treatment was reduced or interrupted? Did the event reappear after study treatment was reintroduced?   
• Confounding risk factors in the patient that may explain or are  associated with the event   
• Concomitant medications  known to cause or are  associated with the event   
• Known association of the event with the disease under study 
• Known association of the event with similar  study  treatments  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].4.  Suspected Unexpected Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  
Suspected unexpected adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are SAEs that are unexpected per  the 
Reference Safety Information section of the IB and judged by [CONTACT_11219]/or Sponsor to 
be related to ESK -001. 
 
A
n adverse reaction is ‘unexpected’ if its nature and severity are not consistent with the 
information about the study drug:  
• In the case of a product with a marketing authorization, in the summary of product 
characteristics for that product.  
• In the case of any other investigational product, in the Investigator’s Brochure relating to 
the trial in question  
 
The Sponsor or designee will report S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the appropriate regulatory authorities and 
Investigator’s as required, according to the local law.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reporting Adverse Events  
Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms 
(e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated 
transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically 
characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event 
Alumis Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
ESK- 001-[ADDRESS_197558] 2022 
 should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it 
should be reported as follow-up information and the diagnosis entered in the eCRF. 
AEs Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) 
should be identified by [CONTACT_5252]. For example, if severe diarrhea is kn own to have 
resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  However, medically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated 
in time should be recorded as independent events on the eCRF.  For example, if a severe 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded separately on 
the eCRF . 
Persistent or Recurrent AEs  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between subject evaluation time points. Such events should only be recorded once in the  eCRF unless their severity changes. 
If a persistent AE changes in severity , it should be recorded as a separate AE  on the Adverse 
Event eCRF.   
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subject evaluation time points and subsequently recurs. All recurrent AEs should be recorded on an  Adverse Event eCR F. 
Abnormal Lab Values  
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management will be recorded  as AEs or SAEs on the eCRF including but not limited to association with clinical 
findings, change to  study drug (e.g. study drug discontinuation) , more frequent follow -up 
assessments, further diagnostic investigation . 
If the clinically significant labora tory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., 
increased alkaline phosphatase associated with cholecystitis ), only the diagnosis (e.g., 
cholecystitis) should be recorded on the eCRF . 
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a  sign of a disease or syndrome, the 
abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the eCRF. If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE or SAE.  For example, an ele vated serum potassium level should be recorded as 
“hyperkalemia ”. 
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the Adverse  Event eCRF, unless their severity, 
seriousness, or etiology changes. 
Follow up of abnormal lab values : Repeat test ing of the abnormal labs should be performed  as 
clinically indicated , in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], until they have returned to the normal 
range and/or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found and the lab value stabiliz es.  
Alumis Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
ESK- 001-[ADDRESS_197559] 2022 
 [IP_ADDRESS].  Reporting of SAEs  
Any AE that is serious and that occurs during the course of the study from the signing of the 
informed consent to end of study for each patient must be reported by [CONTACT_169186] : 
• The Sponsor (or designee) and study monitor within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event (expedited reporting). 
• The investigation site’s IRB/IEC by [CONTACT_39600].  
Initial N otification of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Pharmacovigilance must be informed in writing [ADDRESS_197560] be sent via email (preferred) or fax within 24 hours after awareness of the event to:  
Email:  
Phone:  
Fax:  
Paper SAE forms must be retained in the Investigator Site File.  
In addition to reporting the SAE in the EDC and email ing the paper form , the local CRA and the 
Medical Monitor must be alerted via phone.  
As further information regarding the SAE becomes available, follow -up information should be 
documented as an update using the paper SAE form.  Follow-up information should be reported 
with [ADDRESS_197561] dose of study medication. 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs are reported to Investigators at each site and associated IRB/IEC when the following 
conditions occur: 
• The event is an SAE 
• There is reasonable possibility that the event is an adverse reaction caused by [CONTACT_169187]  
• The adverse reaction is unexpected, that is to say, not foreseen in the IB 
Individual S[LOCATION_003]Rs considered to be a significant safety issues and/or which result in a change 
to the informed consent form will be reported in an expedited manner to all Investigators and 
IRB/IECs.  

Alumis Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
ESK- 001-[ADDRESS_197562] 2022 
 Reporting of any SAEs to applicable regulatory authorities will be the responsibility of the Local 
Sponsor in compliance with local regulations. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Follow- up of Adverse Events  
AEs, especially those for which the relationship to study drug is “related”, should continue to be followed  during the patient’s participation in the study until they have returned to baseline status 
or stabilized at a level a cceptable to the Principal Investigator [CONTACT_73651].  
If after patient study completion, return to baseline status or stabilization cannot be established, an explanation should be recorded in the source documents. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy  
Pregnancies occurring in a female patient or in a male patient’s partner while enrolled in this 
clinical study through [ADDRESS_197563] be reported on a Pregnancy Reporting Form within 24 hours of the investigator, designee, or site personnel  
learning of the pregnancy. 
Pregnancy Reporting Forms should be sent via email (preferred) or fax to: 
Email:  
Phone:  
Fax:  
If a patient becomes pregnant while taking study drug, the study drug will be immediately 
discontinued and the pregnancy must be reported within [ADDRESS_197564] and/or pregnant partner (or ensure such counselling is provided). 
An uncomplicated pregnancy will not be considered an AE or SAE. Elective abortions without 
complications should not be regarded as AEs , unless they were therapeutic abortions . 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14494] a healthy newborn should not be considered an SAE. 
All pregnancies will be followed through birth.  In the event there is a congenital anomaly or 
birth defect in a neonate or infant born to a mother exposed to study drug both the offspring and 
mother will be followed for [ADDRESS_197565] 
will be recorded in the source documentation and reported to the Sponsor and/or its designee . 
The investigator will complete the Pregnancy Reporting Form or paper SAE form, as applicable, 
and report the information regarding the pregnancy, outcome, and status of the newborn, as 
appropriate. 
8.3.2. Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Samples for clinical laboratory assessments will be collected at the time points deta iled in the 
Schedule of Assessments  (see Section 1.3).  

Alumis Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
ESK- 001-[ADDRESS_197566] 2022 
 Laboratory safety tests may be performed at unscheduled time points, if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_3786] . Screening laboratory safety tests may be repeated upon discussion with the 
Sponsor/Medical Monitor.  
The Laboratory Manual will supply complete written instructions for collection, handling, processing, storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_26172].  
8.3.3. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be assessed at the time points detailed in the  Schedule of Assessments  (see 
Section 1.3 ). The following vital signs will be measured: 
• Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic [mmHg]) 
• Heart rate (bpm)  
• Body temperature (°C) 
BP and heart rate recordings will be made after the patient has been resting supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662] -
recumbent for ≥ 5 minutes.  
8.3.4.  Electrocardiograms  
12-lead ECGs will be performed at time points detailed in the Schedule of Assessments ( see 
Section 1.3 ). 
The12- lead ECGs will be performed after the patient has been resting supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662] -reclined  for 
≥ 5 minutes. The ECG  paper tracing will be assessed by [CONTACT_43038] y investigator for any 
abnormality and for clinical significance.  The ECG parameters that will be measured include but 
are not limited to: PR interval, QRS interval, RR interval, QT interval, and QTc.  
The ECGs will be sent electronically to a central location to be analyz ed and over -read. The 
study site should review the centrally read report as soon as possible once  available. The central 
report findings should be compared to the local paper ECG findings reported by [CONTACT_779]. Any 
difference in reported ECG findings should be reconciled by [CONTACT_737]. The study team does not require a report back from this central location to act on any findings identified  on the 
paper ECG tracing that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_103160], are clinically significant.  
8.3.5. Physical Examinations  
Physical examinations will be performed at the time points detailed in the Schedule of 
Assessments  (see Section 1.3).

 Abbreviated Physical Examination  
An assessment of the general appearance, skin, cardiovascular system, respi[INVESTIGATOR_169161]- driven assessment as appropriate.  
The abbreviated  physical examination should be extended to a full physical examination based 
on the clinical condition of the patient and if considered necessary by [CONTACT_079].  
8.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples for the analysis of plasma concentration levels of ESK -001 (PK) and ESK -001 
metabolites  will be collected at the time points detailed in the Schedule of Assessments  (see 
Section 1.3 ). 
Samples will be used to evaluate the PK of ESK -001 and its metabolites.  Samples coll ected for 
analyses of ESK -001 and ESK- 001 metabolite plasma concentrations may also be used to 
evaluate safety or efficacy aspects related to concerns arising during or after the study.  After the 
blood samples are analyzed for plasma ESK -001 and ESK-001 metabolite concentrations, any 
residual samples may be used f or exploratory analysis such as additional metabolite profiling and 
identification, interacting drug concentration measurements, ex vivo protein binding, or development of PK or PD assays.

 9. SAFETY MONITORING COMMITTEE  
A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will be conv ened to review the safety data throughout 
this study. The SMC will consist of the Sponsor’s Medical Director; the study M edical M onitor 
(from the CRO); two independent physicians with clinical trial experience, one with dermatology 
expertise and the other a cardiologist; and an independent statistician.  
The SMC may meet at any time during the study to review blinded (or unblinded, if required) 
data when deemed necessary by [CONTACT_4484].  
The SMC will initially convene to review all available safety data after approximately [ADDRESS_197570] been randomi zed and completed their Week 4 visit. The SMC will also meet 
regularly thereafter, based upon accumulating safety data and patient enrollment. The final prescheduled meeting of the SMC will be after study completion; to evaluate all safety data from all patients enrolled in the study . The SMC may also review safety data from eligible patients 
who complete this study and who enter an ESK-[ADDRESS_197571] 
administration of study drug (ESK-001 or placebo). A patient is considered randomized into the 
study following treatment assignment by [CONTACT_23624] . 
All statistical tests will be two -sided . Except where noted, evaluation of continuous variables 
will be performed using ANOVA; ANOVA will be replaced by [CONTACT_169188] . Between -group comparisons involving discrete data 
will be performed using contingency table methodology. Descriptive summaries of continuous 
data will present the group mean, SD, median, range, and sample size. Descriptive summaries of 
discrete data will report the number of patients and incidence as a frequency and as a percentage. 
Statistical comparisons will be performed at the 0.[ADDRESS_197572] to the number of patients randomized, treated, and completing the study. For patients who discontinue treatment 
early, reasons for discontinuation will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Important Protocol Deviations (IPD) will be summarized . ICH E3 defines important protocol 
deviations as a subset of protocol deviations that may significantly impact the completeness, 
accuracy, and/or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a subject’s rights, 
safety, or well -being. 
10.2. Analysis of Treatment Group Comparability  
Demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity) and baseline characteristics (e.g., duration of psoriasis, psoriasis severity at baseline, baseline  PASI) will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
10.3. Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy analyses will be based on the intent -to-treat (ITT) approach. All patients randomized 
(ITT population) will be included in the analysis, and subjects will be analyzed according to the ir 
randomized treatment. Unless otherwise noted, analyses of efficacy outcome measures will be stratified by [CONTACT_169171].  
10.3.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The proportion of patients in the active treatment groups with ≥75% improvement in PASI at 
Week [ADDRESS_197573] 2022 
 10.3.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Similar analyses as in the primary efficacy analyses will be performed to compare any two active 
arms.  
The proportion of patients in each treatment group and placebo  with s PGA categories  0 or 1 
(cleared or minimal ) at Week [ADDRESS_197574] 
adjusting for stratification factors . 
The proportion of patients in each treatment group and placebo  with response rate in PASI -50, 
90, and 100 at Week 12 relative to baseline will be compared using methods similar to those used for PASI-75. 
Change in percent BSA at Week 12 relative to baseline will be performed using ANOVA or 
analogous nonparametric methods. 
Change from baseline in DLQI at Week 12 relative to baseline will be performed  using ANOVA 
or analogous nonparametric methods. 
The proportion of patients in each treatment group and placebo  with ≥ 75% improvement in PASI 
Week [ADDRESS_197575] adjusting 
for stratification factors . 
No adjus tments for multiplicity will be performed.  
Graphical methods may be used to display efficacy data.  
10.3.3. Exploratory Endpoints 
• Change from baseline in pruritus NRS score at Week 12 will be performed using ANOVA or 
analogous nonparametric methods. 
• Change from baseline in EQ -5D at Week 12 will be performed using ANOVA or analogous 
nonparametric methods. 
• Change from baseline in psoriasis and TYK2- related skin biomarkers in response to 
ESK -001 treatment.  
• Change from baseline in psoriasis and TYK2- related blood -based biomarkers in response to 
ESK -001 treatment.  
• Change from baseline in transcriptomic and proteomic expression in response to ESK -[ADDRESS_197576] 2022 
 Patient deaths (if any) will be listed.  
10.4.1. Adverse Events  
Verbatim descriptions of treatment- emergent adverse events will be mapped to thesaurus terms  
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Adverse eve nts will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_49240]. Summaries of adverse events by [CONTACT_169189]. Adverse events judged by [CONTACT_169190] (ESK -001 or 
placebo) will be prepared . Serious adverse events will be summarized similarly. Adverse events 
leading to discontinuation from the study or treatment will be listed and tabulated. 
10.4.2. Laboratory Tests 
Descriptive summaries of laboratory values, including changes from baseline and 
treatment- emergent abnormalities, will be generated.  Shift tables reflecting changes from 
baseline (e.g., normal to low, high) will be presented  for a subset of laboratory parameters.  
The liver function tests, namely ALT, AST, ALP, and TBL, are used to assess possible drug-induced liver toxicity (DILI). A listing of liver function test result s that meet DILI criteria will be 
generated. 
10.4.3. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
The RR, PR, QRS, and QT intervals will be measured and read by a central laboratory. HR will 
be calculated as 60/ ( RR × 1000) (with RR expressed in msec) and rounded to the nearest 
integer.  
Correction for Heart Rate 
Corrected QT interval (QTc) will be calculated using the manually over- read QT values. Each 
individual ECG QT value will be corrected for HR. The measured QT data will be corrected for 
HR using QTcF as per the following formulae/method (with QT, RR and QTc expressed in msec):  
Fridericia’s Correction:  
 
ECG Numeric Variables  
HR, PR, QRS, and QTcF will be summarized using descriptive statistics. For each time point of measurement, the changes from baseline will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
Categorical Analysis  
The incidence count and percentage of patients with any postdose QTcF values of > 450 msec, 
>480 msec, and >5 00 msec will be tabulated. Patients  with QTcF values >520 msec will be listed 
with corresponding baseline values, ∆QTcF, and baseline and treatment HR. The incidence count 
and percentage of patients  with ∆ QTcF increase from baseline of >30  msec and >[ADDRESS_197577] 2022 
 10.4.4. Vital Signs  
Descriptive summaries of vital signs measurements and changes from baseline will be generated.  
10.5. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Plasma concentrations of ESK -001 will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_169191]. 
10.6. Missing Data  
Detailed missing data methodology will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
10.7. Sample Size  
The sample size is determined based on the primary efficacy endpoint. Calcul ations are based on 
a 1:1:1:1:1:1 randomization ratio (ESK-001 doses 1-5 vs. placebo) and will provide at least 99% 
power to detect 50% increase in the PASI -75 response rate in an active arm (i.e., 60% response 
rate) compared to the placebo assuming the response rate is 10% in the placebo arm. With a two -
sided, two- sample test at a significance level of 0.05, a sample size of [ADDRESS_197578] the Investigator's records by [CONTACT_11200] (source document verification), and the 
maintenance of Drug Accountability by [CONTACT_737]. Monitoring details describing strategy, 
methods, responsibilities, and requirements, including handling of noncompliance issues and 
monitoring techniques are provided in the Monitoring Plan and contracts. 
Electronic data capture (EDC) will be utilized . All patient data relating to the study will be 
entered by [CONTACT_169192] f orms 
(eCRFs) unless transmitted to the Sponsor or designee electronically (e.g., laboratory data). In no 
case is the eCRF to be considered as source data for the study.  
Validation checks will be programmed within the EDC system to identify potential data 
discrepancies. Additionally, Sponsor personnel or designee will review the data entered by 
[CONTACT_5375]. If potential discrepancies are discovered, electronic data queries stating the nature of the potential discrepanc y and requesting clarification 
will be sent to the site via the EDC system. Designated investigator site staff are required to respond promptly to queries and make necessary changes to the data. The sponsor assumes accountability for actions delegated to other individuals (e.g., contract research organizations)  
For classification purposes, preferred terms will be assigned to the original terms recorded on the eCRF, using MedDRA for AEs, diseases and surgical and medical procedures, and the WHODrug dictionar y for drug and herbal treatments.  
11.2. Protocol Amendments and Study Completion  
Protocol amendments must be made only with the prior approval of the Sponsor or its designees. 
The Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) must be inform ed of 
all amendments and give approval for all amendments. For studies conducted out of the US, 
approval of all substantial amendments must be obtained from the relevant Competent 
Regulatory Authority before implementation. The Investigator must send a cop y of the approval 
letter from the IRB/IEC to the Sponsor and/or its designees.  
Approval must be obtained before any changes can be implemented, except for Changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study patient s, or when the change(s) involves 
only logistical or administrative aspects of the study (e.g. , change in monitor, change of 
telephone number). 
The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study, according to the Clinical Study 
Agreement.  
Study completion is defined as the date when all patients have completed the final study visit, 
and the study database has been locked.  
Alumis Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
ESK- 001-[ADDRESS_197579] agree upon the format and content of the informed consent 
for (ICF) before it is submitted to the IRB/IEC for approval. A copy of the IRB/IEC approved 
ICF will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Written IRB/IEC approved informed consent and Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) release (or other privacy protection release, as governed by [CONTACT_4159]) must be obtained from each patient before any study-
related activities are conducted . The Investigator must retain all original signed and dated ICFs 
in the patient’s  file. A copy of the signed and dated ICF must be given to the patient. 
The ICF docum ents the study- specific information the Investigator provides to the patient for the 
patient’s  agreement to participate . Among other things, the Investigator or his/her designee will 
fully explain in layman's terms the nature of the study, along with the a ims, methods, anticipated 
benefits, potential risks, and any discomfort participation may entail. The ICF must be 
appropriately signed and dated before the patient enters the study. 
Patients will be informed of findings from the earlier or concurrent clinical studies (including 
AEs), if it is considered that such information could potentially affect patients ’ willingness to 
participate  or continue in the study. Depending on the nature, severity, and seriousness of these 
AEs, the ICF may be a mended as deemed appropriate. All amended signed and dated ICF(s) 
must be retained in the patients’  files at the study sites; and a copy must be given to the patient. 
11.4. Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
11.4.1. Patient Confidentiality and Disclosure of Data  
The Inves tigator must ensure that each patient’ s anonymity is maintained as described below . On 
the eCRFs or other documents submitted to the Sponsor and/or its designees, patients must only be identified by [CONTACT_3449], Patient Identification Number, and demographics, and pertinent restrictions of local regulations . No other personal identifies will be used, and data will be de-
identified in a manner compliant with Privacy Laws and, for US patients, the HIPAA regulations. Documents that are not for submission to the Sponsor and/or its designee ( e.g., 
signed ICFs and Patient Information Sheets) should be kept in strict confidence by [CONTACT_169193]. The Investigation and institution must permit authorized representatives of the 
Sponsor and/or its designee, representatives of the FDA, national and local health authorities, 
and the IRB/IEC direct access to review the patients’ original medical records for verification of 
study- related p rocedures and data. Direct access includes examining, analyzing, verifying and 
reproducing any records and reports that are needed for the evaluation of the study. The 
Investigation is obligated to inform the patient in the ICF that his/her study -related r ecords will 
be reviewed, by [CONTACT_31714]- named representatives.  
Patients will be informed that data will be held on file, by [CONTACT_1034], and that these data may be viewed by [CONTACT_169194]. Patients will also be informed that a study report will be prepared and may be submitted to regulatory authorities and for publication. However, patients 
will be identified in such reports only by [CONTACT_169195], 
Alumis Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
ESK- 001-[ADDRESS_197580] confidence, as 
allowed by [CONTACT_2371]. 
Upon the patient’s  permission, medical information may be given to the patient’ s personal 
physician or othe r appropriate medical personnel responsible for the patient's welfare.  
11.4.2. Electronic Case Report Forms ( eCRFs ) 
The data collected in the source documents for this study will be entered by [CONTACT_169196] [ADDRESS_197581]. If no marketing 
application is to be filed, or an application is not approved for the drug, the Investigator will retain the study records for 2 years after shipment and delive ry of the drug for investigational use 
is discontinued and the Sponsor has so notified the FDA, per 21 CFR 312.27. Study records should, however, be retained longer if required by [CONTACT_169197]/or local regulatory requirements or by [CONTACT_169198]. 
The Investigator must make study data accessible to the monitor, other authorized representative

 13. APPENDICES  
Appendix A Psoriasis Area and Severity Index  (PASI)  
The PASI is a grading system used for the evaluation of the severity of psoriatic lesions and 
their     response to treatment. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from [ADDRESS_197586]’s disease is calculated  as described  below: 
The body is divided into 4 regions  for determining total body surface area (BSA):  
• the head (h), trunk (t), upper extremities (ux) and lower extremities (lx),  
• which account for 10% (0.1), 30% (0.3), 20% (0.2), and 40% (0.4) respectively o f BSA  
Each of these areas are evaluated for erythema (E) , induration (I) and scaling  (S), which  are 
rated on a scale from 0 to 4. 
The scoring system  for the signs of disease (erythema,  induration and scaling)  is below: 
0 = none  
1 = slight  
2 = moderate  
3 = severe  
4 = very  severe  
The scoring system for  estimating the  area (A) of involvement for psoriatic lesions  is outlined  
below: 
0 = no involvement  
1 = 1% to 9% involvement  
2 = 10% to 29% involvement  
3 = 30% to 49% involvement  
4 = 50% to 69% involvement  
5 = 70% to 89% involvement  
6 = 90% to 100%  involvement  
To aid in the area assessments,  the following conventions are followed: 
a. the neck  is considered part of the head  
b. the axilla  and groin are considered  part of the trunk  
c. the buttocks are considered part of the lower extremities  
The PASI formula is:  
PASI  = 0.1(E h + S h + I h)Ah + 0.3(E t + S t + I t)At + 0.2(E ux + S ux + I ux)Aux + 0.4(E lx + S lx + Ilx)Alx 
Clinical assessments of response should  be performed  by [CONTACT_109426](s).

 Appendix B S tatic Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA)  
The Physician Global Assessment (PGA) is used to determine the subject’s psoriasis lesions 
overall at a given time point. Overall lesions will be graded for induration, erythema, and scaling based on the scales below. The sum of the 3 scales will be divided by 3 to obtain a final PGA score.  
 Induration (I) (averaged  over all lesions; use the National Psoriasis  Foundation Reference  card  
for measurement)  
0 = no evidence of plaque elevation  
1 = minimal plaque elevation, = 0.25 mm  
2 = mild plaque elevation, = 0.5 mm 3 = moderate plaque elevation, = 0.75 mm  4 = marked plaque elevation, = 1 mm 5 = severe plaque elevation, = 1.25 mm or more   
Erythema  (E) (averaged  over all lesions)  
0 = no evidence of erythema, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_22765]  
1 = faint erythema  
2 = light red coloration  
3 = moderate red coloration 4 = bright red coloration 5 = dusky to deep red coloration   
Scaling  (S) (averaged  over all lesions)  
0 = no evidence of scaling 
1 = minimal; occasional fine scale over less than 5% of the lesion  
2 = mild; fine scale dominates  
3 = moderate; coarse scale predominates  
4 = marked; thick, nontenacious scale dominates 5 = severe; very thick tenacious scale predominates

TITLE Safety and efficacy of ingenol mebutate gel 0.015% for treatment of actinic keratosis on the  face in solid organ transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_405011] 1
RATIONALE Actinic keratoses (AK) are patches of dysplastic keratinocytes arising in sun-damaged skin.  These lesions are  precursors to cutaneous 
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and are treated to prevent progression to  SCC.  First-line  therapy  for AK include cryotherapy  and 
curettage, which target clinically visible lesions but do not  address the 
subclinical lesions in the field of ultraviolet radiation  damage.  Field 
therapy includes topi[INVESTIGATOR_405012], immunotherapy, and photodynamic therapy. Ingenol  mebutate is the active compound 
found in Euphorbia peplus sap, and has been approved for treatment  
of actinic  keratoses in immunocompetent patients.  Ingenol mebutate  
0.015% is favored  over  other topi[INVESTIGATOR_405013],  high 
clearance rate, and resolution without sequelae.  There  are no data on 
safety of  this medication in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant  
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (OTR).  OTR have  a high incidence of AK and high risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_405014], and require frequent  field therapy. In addition, OTR 
generally have a higher burden of AK and require  treatment of a 
larger surface  area than  the 25 cm2 area labeled for ingenol mebutate  
0.015%. We plan to investigate the  safety  and efficacy  of ingenol  
mebutate 0.015% in OTR, with a treatment area  up to 100cm2.
The rationale  for an  increased dose and surface area for treatment in 
this study is that OTR typi[INVESTIGATOR_405015], 
requiring treatment of larger areas such  as those described here.  The 
proposed treatment regimen better reflects  the 'real  world' need for 
treatment of a  larger surface  area  while evaluating the  safety  and local  
site reactions  associated  with  this treatment  regimen.
STUDY DESIGN This is  a single arm, open-label safety  study.
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
To assess  the safety of topi[INVESTIGATOR_405016].

3) Adverse  events leading to  study  drug  discontinuation.   
SECONDARY ENDPOINTS
Efficacy:
• Reduction in number of actinic keratoses:  defined as the percent  
change in actinic keratosis count  in the target  treatment area  on Day 
57, as compared to the  baseline lesion count.
• Partial clearance of lesions: defined as the proportion of patients with a reduction of 75% of more  in the number  of clinically visible

STATISTICS
Primary Analysis PlanThis is  a small descriptive study, with the primary  safety endpoint of 
the incidence rate of patients who experience:
1) Any  adverse event (AE) ascertained by [CONTACT_52168], physician 
evaluation, or laboratory  value, 2) One  or more serious adverse events 
(SAE) as defined by [CONTACT_37366]4, and 3) Adverse events leading to  
study drug discontinuation.   
The safety analysis will be  based  on the safety  population,  which is 
defined as  all randomized  patients who have  received at least one  dose 
of study medication  and who have  had at least one  post-baseline 
Protocol Version 1.0 Arron Confidential
Version #: 1.2 Version Date: Oct 18 2016  Page 10 of 39
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 safety evaluation.
Adverse events will be explored for trends or  heterogeneity between 
the two transplant  subgroups; lung and kidney.  If there is evidence 
for a difference between  groups, the subgroups will be reported 
separately.
The mean maximum LSR composite score,  the VAS score, and  the 
Skindex-16 scores and trend in scores  over the study visits will be 
reported as descriptive data.  The composite LSR score will be  
compared to  historical controls (Lebwohl  et al, NEJM 2012).
The efficacy  analysis will be based on the intent-to-treat (ITT)  
population. In the  ITT population, patients will be  counted in  the 
treatment group upon informed consent, regardless  of receiving any 
dose of study  medication. 
For efficacy  analysis, all missing values due to patient early 
termination from the study will be imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF)  method,  as appropriate.  For each patient, the 
Baseline values will be defined as those values recorded at Day [ADDRESS_510624] their Baseline values,  i.e., these  patients will be 
considered as treatment  failures. 
Percent reduction  in number of actinic  keratoses and proportions of 
patients with partial and complete clearance of actinic keratoses  will 
be presented descriptively and  visualized  as histograms.   These scores 
will be compared  to historical controls (Lebwohl et al, NEJM 2012).
Rationale for Number  
of SubjectsThis is  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_405025], not powered for analysis.  The 
sample size  of 20 patients is selected to achieve a reportable sample 
size in two subgroups  of organ transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].

2STUDY RATIONALE
Actinic keratoses (AK) are precursors to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and are treated to prevent  progression to SCC.  First-line therapy for AK include cryotherapy 
and curettage, which target clinically  visible  lesions  but do not  address the subclinical

There are no data on safety of this medication in immunosuppressed  solid  organ transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (OTR).  OTR have  a high incidence of AK and high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_405029], 
and require frequent field  therapy. In addition, OTR generally have a higher burden of AK 
and require treatment of a larger surface  area than  the 25 cm2 area labeled for ingenol 
mebutate 0.015%. We plan to investigate  the safety and efficacy of ingenol mebutate 
0.015% in  OTR, with a  treatment area up to [ADDRESS_510625] an extensive  burden of AK, requiring treatment of larger areas such as 
those described here.  The proposed  treatment regimen better reflects the 'real world'  need  
for treatment of a larger  surface area while evaluating  the safety and local site reactions 
associated with  this treatment regimen.
2.1 Risk  / Benefit Assessment
The risks of ingenol  mebutate are primarily  local site reactions of redness,  flaking,  
crusting, swelling,  blisters, or  erosions. These  typi[INVESTIGATOR_405030] 1 of treatment. The 
adverse reactions reported  in >=2%  of patients treated with  ingenol  mebutate  were 
application site pain, pruritus, and infection;  periorbital edema, and headache. We  will 
monitor the patients at day [ADDRESS_510626] the infection rate in OTR to be  less than the  reported 
Protocol Version 1.0 Arron Confidential
Version #: 1.2 Version Date: Oct 18 2016  Page 12 of 39
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 rate of 3% as the  majority  of OTR are  on routine  antibiotic prophylaxis;  any infections 
will be recorded as adverse events  and treated according to  standard of care. 
If a patient has a   (1) local skin response  score  of 3 or greater  in any individual  category, 
and (2) associated  symptoms unrelieved by [CONTACT_405050]-inflammatory drug (NSAID), then  1% topi[INVESTIGATOR_405031] [ADDRESS_510627] a 
high burden of AK and frequently require multiple rounds of field treatment to  reduce  this 
sign of ultraviolet radiation induced  skin damage.  Other treatments  require long-term 
applications or in-office light; ingenol has the  benefit of being a short course.  Ingenol 
mebutate is approved for immunocompetent patients,  but there is no safety data in OTR.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831],  the medication has been frequently used off-label in  OTR and  is generally 
believed to be safe due to the absence of  systemic absorption.  One recent case reported 
brisk local site reaction without systemic adverse events. 
It is difficult to obtain  insurance coverage for ingenol mebutate in OTR without 
demonstrating failure of  multiple other treatments for AK. Participants in this  study will 
also benefit  from access  to ingenol mebutate.

11ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING  AND DOCUMENTATION
11.1 Adverse  Events
An adverse event (AE)  is any untoward  medical  occurrence in  a clinical investigation of a 
patient administered a  pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily  have  a causal 
relationship with the  treatment.  An AE is therefore any  unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom  or disease temporally associated  
with the administration  of an investigational  product,  whether  or not related  to that 
investigational product.  An unexpected AE  is one of a type not identified in nature, 
severity, or  frequency in the current  U.S.  package  insert or of greater  severity or frequency  
than expected  based on the information in the U.S. package insert.
The Investigator will probe, via  discussion  with the  subject, for the occurrence of AEs 
during each  subject  visit  and record the information  in the site’s source  documents.  
Adverse events will be recorded  in the patient  CRF.  Adverse events will be described by 
[CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and  times), severity,  outcome, treatment and relation  to 
study drug, or if  unrelated,  the cause.
AE Severity
The National  Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 3.0 should be  used to assess and grade AE severity, including 
laboratory abnormalities  judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can be 
found in the study manual.  If the experience is not covered in  the modified criteria, the 
guidelines shown in Table  1 below should be used to grade severity.  It  should be pointed  
out that the term “severe”  is a measure of intensity and that a  severe AE is not necessarily  
serious.
Table 1.  AE Severity  Grading
Severity (Toxicity Grade) Description
Mild (1) Transient or  mild discomfort; no limitation  in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The subject  may be aware of the  sign  
or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.
Moderate (2) Mild to  moderate limitation in activity, no or  minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.
Severe (3) Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].
Life-threatening (4) The subject  is at risk of  death due to the adverse  experience as it 
Protocol Version 1.0 Arron Confidential
Version #: 1.2 Version Date: Oct 18 2016  Page 24 of 39
Protocol Template Effective: [ADDRESS_510647] caused death if it were more severe.
AE Relationship to Study Drug
The relationship of an AE  to the  study  drug  should  be assessed using  the following the 
guidelines in Table 2.
Table 2.  AE Relationship to Study  Drug
Relationship
to DrugComment
Definitely Previously known toxicity  of agent; or an event that follows a  reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the drug;  that follows a known or expected  response 
pattern to the suspected  drug; that is confirmed  by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_405039];  and that  is not explained by [CONTACT_405056].
Probably An event that  follows  a reasonable  temporal sequence from  administration  of the  
drug; that follows  a known or expected response pattern  to the  suspected drug;  that is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_405040]; and  that is unlikely to be 
explained by [CONTACT_405057]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_405058].
Possibly An event that  follows  a reasonable  temporal sequence from  administration  of the  
drug; that follows  a known or expected response pattern  to that  suspected drug; but 
that could readily have been produced by a number  of other factors.
Unrelated An event that  can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the  study 
drug.
11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)
An SAE is  defined as any AE occurring at any  dose that results in  any of the following 
outcomes:
death
a life-threatening adverse experience
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_214761]
a persistent or  significant disability/incapacity
a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Other important medical  events may also be considered an SAE when,  based  on 
appropriate medical judgment, they  jeopardize  the subject  or require intervention to  
prevent one of the  outcomes listed. 
11.2.1 Serious Adverse Experience Reporting
The study site will document all SAEs that occur (whether  or not related to study drug) 
per UCSF CHR Guidelines.  The collection period for all SAEs will begin after informed 
consent is  obtained  and end after  procedures  for the final study visit have  been completed.

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 15.3 Analysis  of Primary Endpoint
This is  a small descriptive study, with the primary  safety endpoint of the incidence rate  of 
patients who experience:
1) Any  adverse event (AE) ascertained by [CONTACT_52168], physician evaluation, or 
laboratory value,  2) One  or more serious adverse  events (SAE)  as defined by [CONTACT_37366]4,  
and 3) Adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation.   
Adverse events will be explored for trends or  heterogeneity between the two transplant  
subgroups; thoracic and  abdominal.  If there is evidence for a difference  between groups, 
the subgroups will be  reported separately.
15.4 Analysis  of Secondary Endpoints
Safety and tolerability data will be summarized by [CONTACT_405060].  
The mean maximum LSR composite score,  the VAS score, and  the Skindex-16  scores and 
trend in  scores  over  the study visits will be reported as descriptive data.   The  composite 
LSR score will be  compared to historical controls  (Lebwohl et al, NEJM 2012).
The efficacy  analysis will be based on the intent-to-treat (ITT)  population. In the ITT 
population, patients will be counted  in the treatment  group  upon informed consent, and 
receipt of at least one  dose of study medication.  
For efficacy  analysis, all missing values due to patient early termination from  the study 
will be imputed using last observation carried forward  (LOCF) method, as appropriate. 
For each  patient,  the Baseline  values  will be defined as  those values recorded at Day  [ADDRESS_510653] their Baseline values,  
i.e., these patients will be considered as  treatment failures. 
Percent reduction  in number of actinic  keratoses and proportions of patients with partial  
and complete clearance of  actinic keratoses will be presented descriptively and visualized 
as histograms.  These  scores will be compared to historical controls (Lebwohl et  al, NEJM 
2012).

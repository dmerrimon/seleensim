4(83) Study design 
This is a multicenter, open-label study designed to assess pati ent- or caregiver-reported 
functionality, performance, and reliability of a single-use aut o-injector (AI) with a fixed 30 
mg dose of benralizumab administered subcutaneously (SC) in an at-home setting.   
Approximately 120 adult patients  with severe asthma will enter the treatment period to receive 
5 subcutaneous doses (Week 0, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week  16) of benralizumab.  
Following a 2 week screening period, eligible patients will rec eive 3 SC doses of 30 mg of 
benralizumab at the study site (Week 0, Week 4, and Week 8). At  Week 0, the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee will administer the study drug . At Week 4, the patient or 
caregiver will have the option of administering the study drug under study site supervision to 
ensure they understand the procedure and are capable of doing s o.  At Week 8, the patient or 
caregiver will have to perform the injection, again under site staff supervision.  Patients or 
caregivers unable or unwilling to administer investigational pr oduct (IP) at this visit will be 
discontinued from the study.  
The patient or caregiver will be  given the Instructions for Use  (IFU) to refer to for home 
administrations.  The final 2 doses of benralizumab (Week 12 an d Week 16) will be self-
administered by [CONTACT_620492].  After each of these 
administrations, the patient wi ll return for a scheduled on-sit e visit within 48 hours. 
For the at-home administrations, w hether the patient is self-ad ministering or the caregiver is 
administering to a patient, the person administering the dose w ill fill out an administration 
questionnaire designed to indi cate whether the device functione d correctly and the dose was 
successfully administered.  Both t he completed questionnaire an d the used device are to be 
returned to the site during each of the clinic visits (Visit 5 and Visit 6).  The site is to 
subsequently return the used devices and completed questionnair es to the Sponsor for 
evaluation.   
An end-of-treatment (EOT) visi t will be performed at Week 20 an d a follow-up visit at Week 
28 ([ADDRESS_825535] IP administration).

6(83) Target subject population 
Male and female adult patients [ADDRESS_825538], dosage and mode of administration 
Benralizumab 30 mg/mL solution for injection in a single-use au to-injector (AI) will be 
administered at the study center subcutaneously every 4 weeks f or 3 doses (Week 0, Week 4, 
and Week 8) and then at-home every 4 weeks for 2 doses (Week 12  and Week 16). 
Duration of treatment 
Following enrollment, the patien t will enter a 2-week screening  period, followed by a 20 week 
treatment period.  A follow-up visit will be conducted at Week 28. 
The total planned study duration is a maximum of 30 weeks. 
Statistical methods 
The primary endpoints are the proportion of patients/caregivers  who successfully administered 
benralizumab with an AI at home , the proportion of returned AIs  used to administer 
benralizumab at home that have be en evaluated as functional, an d the proportion of AIs used 
to administer benralizumab at home or at the clinic and have be en reported as malfunctioning 
(Product Complaints). Additional  variables include the proporti on of patient/caregivers who 
successfully administered be nralizumab with an AI at both home administrations and the 
proportion of patients/caregivers who have returned AIs used to  administer benralizumab at 
home that have been evaluated as functional at both times. All these endpoints will be 
presented using descriptive statistics and exact 95% confidence  interval (CI) estimates. 
The estimated sample size recruitment of 120 patients is based upon a targeted recruitment 
and successful enrollment of 100 pati ents plus an adjustment to  account for an assumed 
patient dropout rate of approximately 17% (20 patients); theref ore, no hypotheses will be 
tested statistically and the endpoi nts and safety results will be summarized descriptively and 
all data will be listed.

13(83) 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.[ADDRESS_825555] tightness.  Asthma is a l eading cause of morbidity with a 
global prevalence of approximately 300 million; it is estimated  that the number of people with 
asthma may increase to 400-450 million people worldwide by 2025  (Masoli et al 2004). 
The current approach to anti-infl ammatory controller therapy in  asthma is based on a 
step-wise intensification of a daily maintenance regimen primar ily centered around inhaled 
corticosteroids (ICS) and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTR A), with the addition of long-
acting β 2 agonists (LABA) in patients with more severe asthma (GINA 2016 , NAEPP 2007).  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_291374], up to 50% of patie nts have asthma that is not 
well-controlled (Bateman et al 2010).  This results in consider able impact on quality of life, 
disproportionate use of healthcare resources, and adverse react ions from regular systemic 
steroid use.  Therefore, there remains an unmet medical need fo r patients whose asthma is not 
controlled by [CONTACT_291439][INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
The observed variability in clin ical response to currently avai lable asthma therapi[INVESTIGATOR_291375], in part, to distinctive inflammatory phenotypes (We nzel 2012).  In particular, 
asthma associated with eosino philic inflammation in the airway (often referred to as 
eosinophilic asthma) is common (approximately 40% to 60% of ast hmatics) with the degree of 
eosinophilia associated with clinical severity including the ri sk of asthma exacerbations 
(Bousquet et al 1990; Louis et al 2000; Di Franco et al 2003; S cott and Wardlaw 2006, 
Simpson et al 2006; Zhang and Wenzel 2007).  
Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a key cytokine essential for eosinophil  trafficking and survival 
(Molfino et al 2011). Benralizumab (MEDI-563) is a humanized, a fucosylated, monoclonal 
antibody that binds specifically to the human IL-5 receptor alp ha subunit (IL-5Rα) on the 
target cell.  The IL-5 receptor (IL-5R) is expressed almost exc lusively on the surface of 
eosinophils and basophils (Taka tsu et al 1994; Toba et al 1999) .  Afucosylation confers 
enhanced antibody-dependent cel lular cytotoxicity (ADCC) which results in highly efficient 
eosinophil depletion by [CONTACT_20983] (Kolbeck et al 2012).  Single  and repeated doses of 
benralizumab in mild to severe asthma patients has resulted in depletion of blood and airway 
eosinophils (Busse et al 2010, Gossage et al 2012, Molfino et a l 2012).  Also, a recent dose 
finding trial in severe asthma  proved benralizumab to have bene fit across a range of asthma 
outcomes including reductions in asthma exacerbations, improvem ents in lung function, and 
reduction in symptoms (Castro et al 2014). 
The efficacy and safety of benralizumab has been confirmed in t wo large phase 3 trials, in 
severe asthmatics with a history of exacerbations, still sympto matic despi[INVESTIGATOR_620457]-to-
high dose ICS/LABAs with or without oral corticosteroids or add itional controller

Edition Number 1.[ADDRESS_825556] 2016 
14(83) medications. (Bleecker et al 2016, FitzGerald et al 2016). The dose studied in these trials was 
30 mg, a dose derived from pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/ PD) modelling of the 
Phase 2 dose finding study, administered in 2 dosing regimens –  either 30 mg every 4 weeks 
(Q4W) or 30 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) for the first 3 doses follow ed by [CONTACT_51034] 8 weeks 
(Q8W) thereafter. The primary endpoint in each study was the an nual rate of asthma-related 
exacerbations with key secondary endpoints being FEV 1 and asthma symptoms as defined by 
a daily patient diary.  
The purpose of this study is to assess patient-or caregiver-rep orted functionality, performance, 
and reliability of a single-use auto-injector device used to ad minister a fixed 30 mg dose of 
benralizumab subcutaneously (SC) in an at-home setting.  
1.2 Rationale for study design, doses, and control groups 
This is a multicenter open-label  functionality, reliability and  performance study of a single-use 
auto-injector with benralizumab. T he primary endpoints will be the proportion of 
patients/caregivers who success fully administered benralizumab SC with an AI, the proportion 
of returned AI device used to administer benralizumab at home t hat have been evaluated as 
functional, and the proportion of AI  device used to administer benralizumab at home or at the 
clinic and have been reported as malfunctioning (Product Compla ints). 
The benralizumab dose (30 mg SC, fixed) is based on population exposure-response 
modeling, and stochastic trial simulations from earlier benrali zumab trials. The dosing 
regimen chosen, every 4 weeks (Q4W), is used in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_620458] 3 efficacy and safety 
studies. Other stable asthma therapi[INVESTIGATOR_620459]/long-acting β 2 agonists 
(ICS/LABA) that are within exp ert guidance and that are not res tricted per protocol (see 
Section 3.5.2) are allowed in order to accommodate local standa rds of care. 
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment 
Benralizumab is primarily being studied in severe asthma where there are few treatment 
options for patients whose asthma remains uncontrolled on high dose ICS/LABA and oral 
corticosteroids (GINA 2016).  In a dult patients whose asthma wa s poorly controlled on 
medium-to-high dose ICS/LABA therapy, benralizumab at doses of ≥20 mg produced 
improvements in multiple metrics of a sthma control including th e annual rate of asthma 
exacerbations, lung function, ACQ-6 scores, and symptoms (Castr o et al 2014). These 
findings have subsequently bee n confirmed in two large Phase 3 studies (Bleecker et al 2016, 
FitzGerald et al 2016) where a fixed dose of 30 mg was given ei ther Q4W or Q8W. 
 Development of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to benralizumab has b een documented. 
Theoretical risks of developi[INVESTIGATOR_620460] (eg, anaphylaxis or immune complex disease). Eosinoph ils are a prominent feature 
of the inflammatory response to he lminthic parasitic infections  and the presence of infiltrating 
eosinophils has been circumsta ntially associated with a positiv e prognosis in certain solid 
tumors. Therefore, there is a theoretical risk that prolonged e osinophil depletion may diminish 
the ability to defend against helminthic parasites, or negative ly impact the natural history of 
certain malignant tumors. Risk min imization measures herein inc lude exclusion of patients

15(83) with untreated parasitic infect ion and active or recent maligna ncy, in conjunction with the 
performance of routine pharmacovigilance activities.  The efficacy and safety data obtained to date support the conti nued clinical development of 
benralizumab in patients with asthma.   
The purpose of this trial is to c onfirm the successful use of b enralizumab in an AI in an at-
home setting by [CONTACT_144911]. A detailed assessment  of injection site reactions and 
the overall risk/benefit of benralizumab in patients with asthm a is given in the Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB).

Study design 
This is a multicenter, open-label study designed to assess pati ent- or caregiver-reported 
functionality, performance, and reliability of a single-use aut o-injector (AI) with a fixed 30 
mg dose of benralizumab administered subcutaneously (SC) in an at-home setting.   
Approximately 120 adult patients  with severe asthma will enter the treatment period to receive 
5 subcutaneous doses (Week 0, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week  16) of benralizumab.  
Following a 2 week screening period, eligible patients will rec eive 3 SC doses of 30 mg of 
benralizumab at the study site (Week 0, Week 4, and Week 8) (Fi gure 1). At Week 0, the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee will administer the study drug. At Week 4, the 
patient or caregiver will have the option of administering the study drug under study site 
supervision to ensure they understand the procedure and are cap able of doing so.  At Week 8, 
the patient or caregiver will have to perform the injection, ag ain under site staff supervision.  
Patients or caregivers unable or unwilling to administer invest igational product (IP) at this 
visit will be discontinued from the study.  
The patient or caregiver will be  given the Instructions for Use  (IFU) to refer to for home 
administrations.  The final 2 doses of benralizumab (Week 12 an d Week 16) will be self-
administered by [CONTACT_620492].  After each of these 
administrations, the patient wi ll return for a scheduled on-sit e visit within 48 hours. 
For the at-home administrations, w hether the patient is self-ad ministering or the caregiver is 
administering to a patient, the person administering the dose w ill fill out an administration 
questionnaire designed to indi cate whether the device functione d correctly and the dose was 
successfully administered.  Both t he completed questionnaire an d the used device are to be 
returned to the site during each of the clinic visits (Visit 5 and Visit 6).  The site is to 
subsequently return the used devices and completed questionnair es to the Sponsor for 
evaluation.   
An end-of-treatment (EOT) visit will be performed at Week 20 an d a follow-up visit at Week 
28 ([ADDRESS_825558] IP administration).

4.1 Enrollment and screening period 
4.1.1 Enrollment (Visit 1) 
Each patient and caregiver, if applicable, will provide written  informed consent prior to any study 
specific procedures and undergo a ssessments applicable for the visit (see Table 1). 
Patients (and caregiver, if applicable) must sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to any Visit 
1 procedures.  Registration of the patient’s enrollment via IWR S/IVRS should occur on day when 
other Visit [ADDRESS_825596] of physician-diagnosed asthma is required in source do cumentation.  A patient’s verbal 
history suggestive of asthma s ymptoms, but without supporting d ocumentation, is not sufficient to 
satisfy these inclusion criteria. 
Current regular use of ICS prior to enrollment must be document ed in the source.  This 
documentation may be in the form of a recent active medication list as per an HCP note or filled 
prescriptions based on a pharmacy record. 
4.1.2 Re-screening 
Re-screening is allowed only once for any patient. 
Re-screened patients should re -sign the informed consent on the  re-screening Visit 1.  All Visit 1 
procedures should be repeated. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Procedures for patients who exp erience an exacerbation during s creening 
Patients who experience an ast hma exacerbation during screening  should be treated according to

4.2 Treatment period 
Inclusion criteria will be c onfirmed at Visit 2 (Week 0).  Elig ible patients will receive 5 doses of 
benralizumab 30 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W). 
Following a 2 week screening period, eligible patients will rec eive 3 SC doses of benralizumab at 
the study center (Week 0, Week 4, and Week 8). The first inject ion of IP will be done at the study 
center by [CONTACT_620501] 2 (Week 0). At the Visit 3 (Week 4) and Visit 4 (Week 8) 
administrations, the patient or c aregiver will be asked to admi nister the study drug themselves 
under study center supervision to ensure they understand the pr ocedure and are capable of doing so. 
If the patient is not willing/able to self-administer (or the c aregiver is not willing/able to administer) 
at Visit 4 (Week 8), the patient will be discontinued from IP. At Visit 4 (Week 8) after completion 
of a self-administration, the patient will be given: epi[INVESTIGATOR_22493] e containing device, IP along with the

administration. The final 2 dos es of benralizumab (Week 12 and Week 16) will then be 
administered by [CONTACT_76409] a  caregiver at home. After each of these administrations, the patient 
will return for a scheduled on-site visit within 48 hours. 
The AI Administration Questionnaire (please see Appendix G) is to be filled out by [CONTACT_102] (if 
self-administering) or by [CONTACT_18629] (if they administered t he IP to the patient).  That person will 
fill out a questionnaire designed to indicate whether the devic e functioned correctly and the dose 
was successfully administered.  Both the administration questio nnaire and the used device are to be 
returned to the study center during each of the clinic visits a fter at-home administration.  Study 
Center Staff will instruct the pa tient or caregiver, if applica ble, on how to complete the 
questionnaire and properly return the device.

administered benralizumab with t he AI device at home.  A succes sful administration is defined as 
an injection completed and an an swer of “Yes” to all 5 question s in the administration 
questionnaire (please see Appendix G) and satisfactory in vitro  evaluation of the returned devices. 
5.1.3 Assessment of returned single-use auto-injector device through in vitro evaluation 
In addition to the administrati on questionnaire filled out and returned with each at-home 
administered dose, the used A I device will be returned to the S ponsor for in vitro evaluation.  The 
data collected in the in vitro  evaluation of the AI devices falls into 2 categories: 1) Visual  
inspection, and 2) Functional evaluation.  The visual inspectio n will assess the returned devices for 
any visible damage or disassembly, full plunger travel indicati ng a complete dose was expelled, and 
needle guard deployment.  The functional evaluation will challe nge the needle safety guard to 
assess whether it deployed corr ectly and continued to provide p rotection against accidental needle 
stick injuries.  As mentioned in Section 5.1.2, a satisfactory in vitro  evaluation of the returned 
devices and a completed administration questionnaire with an an swer of “Yes” to all [ADDRESS_825612], the n the unsuccessful administration 
may be classified as a use error and not a device malfunction ( e.g. user removes Autoinjector from 
the injection site before the injection is complete).

Product defects may be related to component, product, or packag ing and labeling issues prior to or 
during use.  Product defects should be reported to the Study Mo nitor.  The list below includes, but  
is not limited to, descriptions of product complaints in these 3 categories should be reported as 
defects: 
x Component Issue: Defect in container or dosing mechanism of the IP.  The component 
defect may be damaged, missi ng, or broken.  Component examples include the Autoinjector 
and the prefilled syringe housed within the Autoinjector.  
x Product Issue: Defect in the product itself. The product appearance has  visual 
imperfections such as foreign pa rticles, crystallization, disco loration, turbidity, insufficient 
volume, or anything that does not  apply to the product descript ion in the IFU.  
x Packaging/Labeling Issue: Defect in the packaging or labeling o f the product.  The 
packaging (carton, thermo-fitted tray, or tamper-evident seal) or labeling defects may be 
damaged or unreadable, or the label may be missing.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Single Use Auto-Injector malfunction 
An AI device malfunction is when the AI device appears normal d uring verification of shipment 
and then does not work during administration, e.g., the autoinj ector activated prematurely, the 
autoinjector stalled or did not expel the full volume, needle g uard safety feature did not deploy or 
remain locked, glass syringe breakage, needle bent or broke upo n use. Device malfunctions should 
be reported using the Device Malfunction Return Instruction and  the Study Monitor should be 
notified. 
Site staff will be asked to se nd back malfunctioning devices to  the depot or local sponsor company 
according to local procedures.  A ddress and attention for malfu nctioning device is available in the 
Device Malfunction Return Instruction. 
6.[ADDRESS_825632] ration and treatment compliance  
The administration of all study drugs (including IPs) should be  recorded in the appropriate sections 
of the Case Report Form (CRF). 
The IP will be administered at the study center for first 3 dos es and at home for following 2 doses.  
IP administration should be done within visit windows as specif ied in

43(83) .  All information regarding IP administration will be provided  in the Instruction for Use 
(IFU). 
Before investigational product administration 
Prior to each IP administration at study center: 
x Investigator/authorized delegate will assess injection site as per standards of medical 
care  
x For WOCBP, urine pregnancy test will be done; IP will be admini stered only when the 
result of the test is negative (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
Prior to each IP administration in at-home setting: 
x Investigator/authorized delegate will perform visit reminder ca ll within 48h prior 
scheduled IP administration.  The conversation should include o nly basic information 
and serve as a reminder to the patient about the next scheduled  visit to occur within [ADDRESS_825634] will be done; IP will be admini stered only when the 
result of the test is negative (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
Investigational pro duct administration 
The IP will be administered by [CONTACT_737]/authorized dele gate/patient/caregiver as 
specified in Table 2.  If patie nt is not willing or not able to  self-administer (or caregiver is not 
willing/able to administer) at Visit 4 patient will be disconti nued from the IP.  
It is suggested that the site of injection of the IP be rotated  such that the patient receives IP at 
a different anatomical site each time.  Suggested injection sit e rotation sequence is presented 
below (see Figure 3).  In the case when rotation of the injecti on site is not favorable for the 
patient and/or Investigato r, the reason should be recorded in t he source documents.  The

7. SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_255679]. 
7.1 Definition of adverse events 
An adverse event (AE) is the de velopment of an undesirable medi cal condition or the 
deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a 
pharmaceutical product, whether  or not considered causally rela ted to the product.  An 
undesirable medical condition ca n be symptoms (eg, nausea, ches t pain), signs (eg, 
tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal results of an inve stigation (eg, laboratory 
findings, ECG).  In clinical studies, an AE can include an unde sirable medical condition 
occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, eve n if no study treatment has 
been administered. 
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs . 
7.2 Definitions of serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE occurring during any stu dy phase (ie, run-in, 
treatment, washout, follow-up), that fulfills 1 or more of the following criteria: 
x Results in death 
x Is immediately life-threatening 
x Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_620487] (Medi-563)  Study Code D3250C00031 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_825641] 2016 
46(83) x Results in persistent or signifi cant disability/incapacity or s ubstantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions 
x Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
x Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient o r may require medical 
intervention to prevent 1 of the  outcomes listed above. 
For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix A  to the Clinical Study 
Protocol 
7.3 Recording of adverse events 
7.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events 
Adverse events will be collecte d from the time the patient sign s the informed consent, 
throughout the treatment period and including the follow-up per iod (through Week 28). 
Serious adverse events will be  recorded from the time of inform ed consent. 
7.3.2 Follow-up of unresolved adverse events 
Any AEs that are unresolved at follow-up in the study are follo wed up by [CONTACT_149798], but without fu rther recording in 
the case report form (CRF). [COMPANY_008] retains the right to re quest additional 
information for any subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the en d of the study, if 
judged necessary. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_825642] for each AE; 
x AE (verbatim) 
x The date when the A E started and stopped 
x Maximum intensity of the AE 
x Whether the AE is serious or not 
x Investigator causality rating against the Investigational Produ ct (yes or no) 
x Action taken with regard to investigational product 
x AE caused  subject’s withdrawal from study (yes or no ) 
x Outcome. 
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs : 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Benralizumab (Medi-563)  Study Code D3250C00031 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_825643] 2016 
47(83) x Date AE met criteria for serious AE 
x Date Investigator became aware of serious AE 
x AE is serious due to 
x Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
x Date of discharge 
x Probable cause of death 
x Date of death 
x Autopsy performed 
x Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s) 
x Description of AE 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_255737] 7.2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For exam ple, nausea that persists for 
several hours may be considered s evere nausea, but not a SAE un less it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 7.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE w hen it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 7.2. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_825644] and each 
Adverse Event, and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you  consider that there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by t he investigational product?’ 
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other me dication and study procedures.  
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study proc edure the causal relationship is 
implied as ‘yes’. 
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is foun d in Appendix A to the Clinical 
Study Protocol. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_825645] or reported in re sponse to the open question 
from the study personnel: ‘Have you had any health problem s since the previous visit/you 
were last asked?’ , or revealed by [CONTACT_129158]. 
When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (w hen possible) to recording a 
list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known a nd there are other signs or

48(83) symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diag nosis and each sign or symptom 
will be recorded separately. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_825647]. 
If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated  with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be report ed as an AE and the associate d laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possibl e the reporting Investigator 
uses the clinical, rather than t he laboratory term (eg, anaemia  versus low haemoglobin value). 
In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically releva nt deteriorations in non-
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). 
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical find ing at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline a ssessment will be reported as an  AE. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_825648] tightness, 
breathlessness etc. will be recorded as AEs only when: 
x The sign or symptom is serious according to definition, see Sec tion 7.[ADDRESS_825649] udy due to the sign or symptom. 
x The sign or symptom is new to the patient or is not consistent with the patient’s pre-
existing asthma history as judged by [CONTACT_737]. 
Asthma exacerbation should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if it fulfills any of the above 
criteria. 
7.3.8 Hy’s Law 
Cases where a subject shows ele vations in liver biochemistry ma y require further evaluation 
and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥3xULN together with total biliru bin ≥2xULN may need to 
be reported as SAEs.  Please refe r to Appendix C for further in struction on cases of increases 
in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy’s Law.

49(83) If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Investigator s or other site personnel inform 
the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within [ADDRESS_825652] igator to ensure that all the 
necessary information is provided to t he [COMPANY_008] Patient Sa fety data entry site within 1  
calendar day  of initial receipt for fatal and life threatening events and within 5 calendar  
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. 
For fatal or life-threatening adverse events where important or  relevant information is missing, 
active follow-up is undertaken immediately.  Investigators or o ther site personnel inform 
[COMPANY_008] representatives of any follow-up information on a p reviously reported SAE 
within 1 calendar day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes 
aware of it. 
Once the Investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE i s serious in the WBDC system, 
an automated email alert is sent to the designated [COMPANY_008] representative. 
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or o ther study site personnel 
reports a SAE to the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representative by [CONTACT_756]. 
The [COMPANY_008] representative will advise the Investigator/stu dy site personnel how to 
proceed.  
The reference document for defi nition of expectedness/listednes s is the Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB) for the [COMPANY_008] drug. 
7.5 Overdose 
x An overdose with associated AEs will be recorded as the AE diag nosis/symptoms on 
the relevant AE modules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF modu le 
x An overdose without associated symptoms will be reported on the  Overdose CRF 
module only 
If an overdose on an [COMPANY_008] study drug occurs in the cours e of the study, then 
Investigators or other center personnel will inform appropriate  [COMPANY_008] representatives

contraceptive medication.  Congenital abnormalities/birth defec ts and spontaneous 
miscarriages should be reporte d and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without 
complications should not be handled as AEs.   The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous 
miscarriage, elective termina tion, ectopic pregnancy, normal bi rth or congenital abnormality) 
should be followed up and documented even if the subject was di scontinued from the study. 
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the In vestigator or other site personnel 
informs the appropriate AstraZene ca representatives within 1day  ie, immediately but no later 
than [ADDRESS_825656] igator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to t he [COMPANY_008] Patient Saf ety data entry site within 1 or 5 
calendar days for SAEs (see Section7.4) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies. 
The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.  
The PREGREP module in the CRF is used to report the pregnancy a nd the PREGOUT is used 
to report the outcome of the pregnancy. 
7.6.2 Paternal exposure  
Male patients should refrain from  fathering a child or donating  sperm during the study and for 
16 weeks (5 half-lives) following the last dose. 
Pregnancy of the patient’s part ners will not be  considered an A E.  However, the outcome of 
all pregnancies (spontaneous misca rriage, elective termination,  ectopic pregnancy, normal 
birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and doc umented for conceptions 
occurring from the date of the first administration of IP until  16 weeks (5 half-lives) after the 
last administration of IP. 
8. STATISTICAL ANALYSES BY [CONTACT_76383] 
8.1 Statistical considerations 
Analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_362038] s.

Drug Substance Benralizumab (Medi-563)  Study Code D3250C00031 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_825657] 2016 
51(83) The SAP will be prepared prior to first patient enter treatment  period and any subsequent 
amendments will be documented, w ith final amendments completed prior to data base lock  
8.2 Sample size estimate  
No hypotheses will be tested statistically. Approximately 120 p atients will receive the 
treatment to allow approximately 100 patients to complete the s tudy. It is based upon a 
targeted recruitment with an adj ustment to account for a 17% pa tient’s drop-out rate.  
8.3 Definitions of analysis sets 
Three patient populations are defi ned below: All patients’ anal ysis set, Full analysis set (FAS), 
and Pharmacokinetics analysis set.  
Patients must have provided their informed consent. If no signe d informed consent is collected 
(major protocol deviation (PD)), then the patient will be exclu ded from all analysis sets 
defined below.  8.3.[ADDRESS_825658] one IP will be included in the full analysis set (FAS), 
irrespective of their protocol  adherence and continued particip ation in the study.  Patients who 
withdraw consent to participate  in the study will be included u p to the date of their study 
termination.  
All analyses, except for PK analysis, will be performed using t he FAS. 
8.3.[ADDRESS_825659] dose will be included in the  PK analysis dataset. All PK summaries will be based on this 
analysis set. 
8.4 
Variables for analyses 
8.4.1 Calculation or derivation of primary endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary endpoints 
The primary endpoints are as follows:  
x Proportion of patients/caregivers who successfully administered  benralizumab with an 
AI device at home among those who have been deemed by [CONTACT_620507]-home administ ration and are still in the stu dy at Week 12 or Week 
16.  A successful administration i s defined as an injection com pleted, an answer of 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Benralizumab (Medi-563)  Study Code D3250C00031 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_825660] 2016 
52(83) “Yes” to all 5 questions in the administration questionnaire (s ee Appendix G), and the 
autoinjector adequately passed the visual inspection and functi onal tests.  
Patients/caregivers who are unwilling to self-administer at Wee k 8 will not be 
considered as failures, but will be counted as unsuitable for a t-home administration and 
follow the premature IP Discontinuation (IPD) procedure.  
x Proportion of returned AI devices used to administer benralizum ab at home that have 
been evaluated as functional among all returned AI devices used  to administer 
benralizumab at home.  A functiona l AI device is defined as an answer of “Yes” to all 
the questions in the visual inspection and function tests. Devi ces that are not returned 
for evaluation will be exc luded from analysis. 
x Proportion of returned AI devices used to administer benralizum ab at home and in the 
clinic that have been reported as malfunctioning (Product Compl aints). 
The first [ADDRESS_825661] endpoint 
will be obtained at each of the pos t-treatment periods (Weeks 0 , 4, 8, 12, and 16). 
In addition, the following variables will be calculated among a ll patients/caregivers who have 
been deemed by [CONTACT_620508]-home admi nistration at Week 8 and are 
still in the study at Week16:  
x Proportion of patients/caregivers wh o successfully administered  benralizumab with an 
AI device at both Weeks 12 and 16, and 
x Proportion of patients/caregivers who returned an AI device use d to administer 
benralizumab at home and evaluated as functional at both Weeks 12 and 16. 
8.4.2 Calculation or derivation of  efficacy variable(s) 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6) 
The outcome variable for ACQ-6 will be the change in mean score  from baseline (Week 0) to 
each of the post-treatment periods. 
Patients will be categorized acc ording to their asthma control responder status using the 
following limits (Juniper et al 2005) at the end of treatment ( EOT) visit: 
x ACQ-6  EOT – baseline) ≤ -0.5 → Improvement 
x -0.5< ACQ-6 (EOT – baseline) < 0.5 → No change 
x ACQ-6 (EOT – baseline)  ≥ 0.5 → Deterioration 
An ACQ-6 responder will be defi ned as a patient who had improve ment on ACQ-6, ie, an 
ACQ-6 responder variable takes valu e 1 if change from baseline to end of treatment in 
ACQ-6 ≤ -0.5 and 0 otherwise. 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance Benralizumab (Medi-563)  Study Code D3250C00031 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_825662] 2016 
53(83) Furthermore, patients will also be categorized according to the ir ACQ-6-defined asthma 
control status at the end of treatment using the following scor e thresholds (Juniper et al 2006) 
at the EOT visit: 
x ACQ-6 (EOT ) ≤ 0.75 → Well controlled 
x 0.75< ACQ-6 (EOT) < 1.5 → Partly controlled 
x ACQ-6 (EOT) ≥ 1.5 → not well controlled 
8.4.3 Calculation or derivation of safety variable(s) 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety variables 
The following safety data will be collected: AEs, vital signs, physical examination, 
hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis. 
Change from baseline (Week 0) t o each post-treatment time point  where scheduled 
assessments were made will be calculated for relevant measureme nts.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Other significant adverse events 
During the evaluation of the AE data, an [COMPANY_008] medically qualified expert will review 
the list of AEs that were not reported as SAEs and discontinuat ions due to AEs. 
Based on the expert’s judgment, significant AEs of particular c linical importance may, after 
consultation with the Global Patient Safety Physician, be consi dered other significant AEs 
(OAEs) and reported as such in the CSR. 
Examples of these are marked hematological and other laboratory  abnormalities, and certain 
events that lead to interventi on (other than those already clas sified as serious), dose reduction, 
or significant additional treatment. 
8.4.[ADDRESS_825663] self-administration.  Benralizumab serum con centrations will be 
summarized at each visit using  descriptive statistics.  The PK results will be provided in the 
CSR. 
8.4.5 Calculation or derivation of i mmunogenicity variables 
ADA assessments will be conducted utilizing a tiered approach ( screen, confirm, titer).  
8.5 Methods for statistical analyses 
The analysis of the primary endpoints will include all data cap tured during Weeks 12 and 16 
(for Product Complaints with addition of Weeks 0, 4 and 8) whil e secondary endpoints will 
include all data captured during  the 20-week treatment period, and up to follow-up (where 
applicable), unless the patient withdraws consent to study part icipation, regardless of whether 
study treatment was prematurely discontinued, or delayed, and/o r irrespective of protocol

54(83) adherence. All efficacy analyse s will be performed using an Int ent-to-Treat (ITT) approach 
based on the FAS. For consistency , demographic and baseline cha racteristics will be presented 
using FAS. Safety objectives will also be analyzed using the FA S. 
8.5.1 Primary and secondary analysis method(s) 
No formal statistical analyses will be performed.  Primary and secondary endpoints will be 
summarized descriptively and all data will be listed.  Exact 95 % confidence interval estimates 
will also be presented for the primary endpoints.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis methods for pharmacokinetic variables 
The PK analyses will be performed at or under the guidance of A straZeneca Research and 
Development. 
Benralizumab serum concentrations will be summarized using desc riptive statistics at each 
visit.  No formal PK data analysis  is planned due to sparse sam pling and variations of 
sampling time following benrali zumab self-administrations.  Obs erved serum concentrations 
of benralizumab for each individual will be listed by [CONTACT_620509].  Serum concentrat ions of benralizumab will be p rovided in the CSR. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis methods for blood eosinophil levels 
Blood eosinophil levels will be summarized using standard summa ry statistics and plots at 
each visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis method for immunogenicity variables 
The potential association of ADA wit h safety will be evaluated.   The association of ADA titer 
with benralizumab concentration and blood eosinophil levels wil l be evaluated for ADA-
positive patients only.  
8.5.2 Analysis methods for safety variables 
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_620510] (trea tment period and follow-up 
period). AEs will be listed for e ach patient and summarized by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) 
and Preferred Term (PT) assig ned to the event by [CONTACT_61132].   
Laboratory data for hematology and clinical chemistry will be s ummarized. The frequency of 
changes with respect to normal ranges between baseline and each  post-treatment time point 
will be tabulated. Frequencies of  clinically noteworthy values (defined in the SAP) occurring 
during the clinical study will also be given. Shifts from norma l to abnormal between baseline 
and each post-baseline time poi nt will be evaluated for urinaly sis. Similar summaries will be 
performed for vital signs.  Shifts from normal to abnormal betw een baseline and follow-up 
will be evaluated for the p hysical examination.

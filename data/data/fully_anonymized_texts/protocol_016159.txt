2.  Risks of Study  [ADDRESS_999987] the current NCI Consent Form Template, 
including the following wording requested in the RRA:  
 
“If you choose to take part in this study, there is a risk that:  
• You may lose time at work or home and spend mo re time in 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_90782]’s office than usual  
• You may be asked sensitive or private questions which you 
normally do not discuss  
 
The MoAb 14.18, chimeric  used in this study may affect how different 
parts of your body work such as your liver, kidney s, heart, and blood. 
The study doctor will be testing your blood and will let you know if 
changes occur that may affect your health.  
 
There is also a risk that you could have side effects from the study 
drug(s)/study approach.  
 
iii 
 
 
Here are important points ab out side effects:  
• The study doctors do not know who will or will not have side 
effects.  
• Some side effects may go away soon, some may last a long 
time, or some may never go away.  
• Some side effects may interfere with your ability to have 
children.  
• Some side effects may be serious and may even result in 
death.  
 
Here are important points about how you and the study doctor can make 
side effects less of a problem:  
• Tell the study doctor if you notice or feel anything different so 
they can see if you are having a s ide effect.  
• The study doctor may be able to treat some side effects.  
• The study doctor may adjust the study drugs to try to reduce 
side effects.  
 
The tables below show the most common and the most serious side 
effects that researchers know about. There migh t be other side effects 
that researchers do not yet know about. If important new side effects 
are found, the study doctor will discuss these with you.”  
3.  Possible Side 
Effects of MoAb 
14.18, Chimeric 
(dinutuximab)  [ADDRESS_999988] the current 
CAEPR. The specific changes are as follows:  
 
• Increase in Risk Attribution:  
• Changed to Rare from Also Reported on MoAb 14.18, 
chimeric Trials But With Insufficient Evidence for Attribution 
(i.e., added to the Risk Pr ofile):  Death; Swelling of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_36232]; Brain damage which may cause headache, seizure, 
blindness (also known as Reversible Posterior 
Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome).  
 
• Provided Further Clarification:  
• Anemia which may cause tiredness, or may require bloo d 
transfusion (under Occasional) and Anemia, kidney 
problems which may cause swelling, or may require 
dialysis (under Rare) are now reported as Anemia, kidney 
problems which may cause tiredness, or may require 
blood transfusion or dialysis (under Occasiona l). 
• High blood pressure which may cause headaches, 
dizziness, blurred vision (under Occasional) is now 
reported as High blood pressure which may cause 
dizziness, blurred vision (under Occasional).

ABSTRACT  
Long -term survival rates for children with high -risk neuroblastoma remain poor. In addition, survivors 
experience significant immediate and late toxicities limiting further dose intensification with conventional 
chemotherapy agents. Novel biological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_732067]. This “Pi[INVESTIGATOR_732068]” Phase II 
study is designed to compare the response rates (RR) and progression free survival (PFS) for patients with 
refractory , relapsed or progressive  neuroblastoma receiving temsirolimus or ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  in 
combination with irinotecan and temozolomide. The irinotecan and temozolomide combination has shown 
activity against relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma. Furthermore, its favorable toxicity profile makes it an 
attractive backbone chemotherapy regimen for ass essment of the contribution of novel molecularly targeted 
agents. N euroblastoma cells have shown sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo . mTOR 
inhibito rs have also been shown to have synergistic or additive effects when combined with sever al 
conventional chemotherapeutic drugs,  including those frequently used in the treatment of neuroblastoma. 
The combination of irinotecan and temozolomide with the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus is well tolerated 
in children, and this 3 -drug regimen will compr ise one regimen  of this study. The second regimen  will 
include irinotecan and temozolomide in combination with the chimeric anti -GD2 antibody ch14.18  
(dinutuximab) . The disialoganglioside GD2 is expressed on neuroblastoma cells, but its expression in 
norma l human tissues is limited. A randomized Phase III study (COG ANBL0032) compared the event free 
survival of patients with high risk neuroblastoma treated with ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  combined with GM -
CSF, interleukin [ADDRESS_1000012] shown synergistic or additive effects on neuroblastoma cells. These data support evaluation of the 
addition of ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  to chemotherapy for children with refractory , relapsed or progressive  
neuroblastoma. The agent selected for further study a s a result of this trial will be integrated into frontline 
induction therapy for future patients with high -risk neuroblastoma.

2.0 BACKGROUND  
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
Neuroblastoma remains an important clinical problem, with approximately 50% of patients presenting with 
advanced -stage disease. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_732069], the 
long-term survival rates for these children remain less than 40%.[ADDRESS_1000015] build upon our kno wledge of neuroblastoma biology by [CONTACT_732138]. The COG ANBL0421 protocol was 
developed to both assess the anti -tumor activity of irinotecan/temozolomide in the setting of refractory or 
relapsed disease and, perhaps more importantly, to provide a backbone on which to integrate rationally 
selected molecularly targeted agents.5 The proposed Phase II A NBL1221 study builds from this strategy. 
The proposed biologic agents, temsirolimus and ch14.18  (dinutuximab) , have activity against 
neuroblastoma in pre -clinical models and have demonstrated synergy with conventional cytotoxic 
chemotherapy in these models .6-[ADDRESS_1000016] prospective clinical trial to evaluate the combination of a 
molecularly targeted agent with conventional chemotherapy in the treatment of neuroblastoma.  
 
The primary objective of ANBL1221 is to use a randomized, Phase -II sequential and selection design12-14 
to identify whether temsirolimus or ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  warrants further testing in a future upfront 
randomized Phase III clinical trial for treatment of high -risk neuroblastoma. Specifically, ANBL1221 will 
compare the response rate, toxicity, and feasibility of administration of temsirolimus or ch14.18  
(dinutux imab)  when combined with a backbone chemotherapy regimen of irinotecan and temozolomide. 
As appropriate for a Phase II selection design trial,14,[ADDRESS_1000017] invariably fatal, and thus no 
“standard” salvage regimen exists. The anti -neuroblastoma activity of iri notecan and temozolomide 
together with its tolerable toxicity profile make it a reasonable backbone chemotherapy regimen with which 
to assess the contribution of novel molecularly targeted agents in refractory/recurrent neuroblastoma. 
Irinotecan is a campt othecin prodrug that is metabolized to the active topoisomerase I poison SN -38. 
Temozolomide is an imidazotetrazine prodrug that undergoes hydrolysis to the active metabolite MTIC, 
which induces cytotoxicity by [CONTACT_732139] O6-methylguani ne adducts. The 
combination of irinotecan and temozolomide has been shown to be active in vitro and in vivo  against 
neuroblastoma .16 
 
A Phase I trial conducted  by [CONTACT_732140] (MTDs) of 
intravenous irinotecan together with oral temozolomide, and objective responses in patients with 
neuroblastoma were observed.17 The COG study ANBL0421 was a multicenter Phase II trial of irinotecan 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/2017   Page 13 
plus temozolomide in the setting of refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma.5 A protracted schedule of 
irinotecan (10 mg/m2/dose administered IV for 5 consecutive days given each week for 2  weeks) in 
combination with temozolomide (100 mg/m2/dose) PO for 5 days, was used. Cycles of chemotherapy were 
repeated  every 21 days. Fifty -five eligible patients were enrolled , and t he objective response rate was 15%. 
Twenty nine patients (53%) had stable disease. The therapy was well tolerated as less than 5% of patients 
experienced ≥  Grade 3 diarrhea. Although 18% of p atients with disease measurable by [CONTACT_4654]/MRI  and 35% 
of patients with disease assessable only by [CONTACT_732141]/or bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy  experienced ≥  Grade 
[ADDRESS_1000018] 3 cycles of therapy, less than 10% of all patients developed evidence o f 
infection while neutropenic.5 The irinotecan + temozolomide combination is thus a backbone onto which 
newer, biologically based agents may be added for use in t he relapse setting or as part of initial therapy.  
 
Two intravenous schedules of irinotecan have been studied in the treatment of refractory pediatric cancers: 
the daily x [ADDRESS_1000019] 
that a shorter irinotecan administration schedu le (daily x 5 for 1 week) maintains anti -tumor activity with 
less burden to the patient. A completed rhabdomyosarcoma study (COG ARST0121) showed no 
statistically significant difference in response rates comparing a daily x 5 schedule of IV irinotecan (50 
mg/m2/dose) to a daily x 5 x 2 week schedule (20 mg/m2/dose) .19 The ANBL1221 trial will make use of a 
temozolomide dose of 100 mg/m2/dose PO x 5 days combine d with IV irinotecan at a dose of 
50 mg/m2/dose x 5 days.  
 
The other backbone considered for use in this study was topotecan and cyclophosphamide. This 
combination was used in the POG/CCG 9642 study for patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma .[ADDRESS_1000020], the 25 -30% 
response rate observed in the 9642 trial prompted incorp oration of topotecan/cyclophosphamide into a pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480] (ANBL02P1) and subsequently into the most recent COG Phase III trial for patients with newly 
diagnosed high -risk neuroblastoma (ANBL0532). Therefore, most patients with high-risk neuroblastoma 
treate d at COG centers who develop disease relapse will have received this combination  during  up-front 
therapy, making its use in the relapse setting sub -optimal. Second, the topotecan/cyclophosphamide 
regimen is associated with considerably higher rates of toxi city than is the irinotecan/temozolomide 
regimen. This is particularly important because the patients enrolled on the current trial will have already 
received the prolonged and intensive multimodality therapy that is presently standard of care for this 
disease. Nineteen percent of the patients treated with topotecan and cyclophosphamide on P9462 developed 
≥ Grade 3 infection, and there was one toxic death. Forty four percent had Grade  3 or 4 neutropenia, and 
60% had Grade  3 or 4 thrombocytopenia. In a study by [CONTACT_732142] a similar patient 
population, the combination of irinotecan (adm inistered orally) and temozol omide was also tolerated very 
well.21 In this smaller study, only 7% of patients developed Grade  4 neutropenia and Grade  4 
thrombocy topenia, and 6% received blood product transfusions. As on the ANBL0421 study, dose -limiting 
diarrhea was rare. Thus, the combination of irinotecan and temozolomide is attractive for current -era 
patients with relapsed and refractory neuroblastoma both due to its acceptable toxicity profile and because 
previous exposure to this combination is expected to be considerably less frequent than prior exposure to 
topotecan/cyclophosphamide.  
 
2.3 Rationale for mTOR Inhi bition in Pediatric Solid Tumor s 
 
2.3.1  Pre-Clinical Studies  
When activated and associated with appropriate members of a functional complex, mTOR plays an 
important role in regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth, and proliferation .22 Rapamycin and rapamycin 
analogs form complexes with mTOR and FK506 -binding protein, leading  to inhibition of mTOR signaling. 
The Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) has evaluated the single -agent activity of an mTOR

Version Date: 05/18/2017   Page 14 
inhibitor (rapamycin) using a standardized testing system comprised of over 30  models representing the 
major pediatric sol id tumor types .23 Inhibition of cell growth/proliferation following exposure to rapamycin  
was variable across the cell lines tested in vitro . Objective responses to rapamycin were seen in [ADDRESS_1000021] cancer model .27 Furthermore, rapamycin has 
been shown to sensitize tumors to irinotecan in xenograft models of colon cancer. Ma rked decreases in 
tumor volume were observed following exposure to irinotecan + rapamycin .[ADDRESS_1000022] that the combination of an mTOR inhibitor with chemotherapy, including i rinotecan, 
may be a promising strategy for treatment of solid tumors.  
 
2.3.2  Clinical Experience with Temsirolimus  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adult Studies with Temsirolimus:  
In a Phase I study of temsirolimus given as a weekly infusion, 24 adults received doses ranging 7.5  to 
220 mg/m2.29 Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was observed in a patient treated at a dose of 34 mg/m2 and in a 
patient treated at a dose of 45 mg/m2. Dose escalatio n continued without additional dose -limiting toxicity 
up to a dose of 220 mg/m2. Toxicities noted at that dose level included manic -depressive syndrome, 
stomatitis, and asthenia in [ADDRESS_1000023] frequent drug -related toxicities were rashes and 
mucositis or stomatitis. Toxicities were reversible upon discontinuation of treatment .29  
 
A Phase II study of temsirolimus in adults with relapsed or refractor y mantle cell lymphoma has been 
conducted .30 Thirty -five patients were treated with this agent at a dose of 250 mg IV weekly. Objective 
responses were seen in 13  of 34 patients (one CR and 12 PR). The median time -to-progression in all patients 
was 6.[ADDRESS_1000024] frequent cause o f dose reductions. The 
thrombocytopenia was brief, however, with resolution typi[INVESTIGATOR_732070] .30  
 
In a multicenter, Phase III trial in patients  with poor prognosis renal cell carcinoma, 626 patients were 
randomized to receive 25 mg of intravenous temsirolimus weekly, 3 million U of interferon alfa (with an 
increase to 18 million U) subcutaneously three times weekly, or combination therapy with 15  mg of 
temsirolimus weekly plus 6 million U of interferon alfa three times weekly .31 Patients who received 
temsirolimus alone had longer overall survival and progr ession -free survival than those who received 
interferon alone or interferon + temsirolimus. Rash, peripheral edema, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_732071]; asthenia was more common in the interferon group .31 There 
were fewer patients with serious adverse events in the temsirolimus group than in the interferon group. 
Following an interim analysis of the data from this study, tems irolimus was approved by [CONTACT_732143] .31  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/2017   Page 15 
 
Data from studies of temsirolimus as a component of multi -agent therapy ar e emerging. Concerns regarding 
an increased risk of infection were raised after a patient with glioblastoma multiforme developed fatal 
pneumocystis pneumonia following administration of temsirolimus in combination with temozolomide and 
radiotherapy .32 Antibiotic prophylaxis was subsequently mandated for patient s on this trial. Two other 
patients developed fatal gram negative sepsis during the study, and the investigators note that there appeared 
to be an increased risk of opportunistic infections in patients treated with the combination regimen 
compared with the  population of patients treated with temsirolimus as a single agent .32  
 
Although administration of weekly temsirolimus in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients 
with advanced solid tumors was not feasible due to myelosuppression, a regimen including all 3 drugs on 
Day 1 followed by [CONTACT_732144] s (25 mg) on Day 8 of a 3 week cycle was well -tolerated. Toxicities 
associated with this regimen did not differ substantially from those associated with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel alone .33  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pediatric Studies with Temsirolimus:  
A pediatric Phase I study of single agent temsirolimus in patients with recurrent solid tumors has been 
completed .10 Nineteen patients were enrolled on study. Dose limiting toxicities at 150 mg/m2 included 
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and Grade 3 anorexia. Other Grade 3 or 4 toxicities included leukopenia (17%), 
anemia (11%), neutropenia  (22%) and elevated ALT. A dose of 75 mg/m2 weekly IV was recommended 
for study in the Phase II pediatric setting .[ADDRESS_1000025] stable disease. Five of these patients 
experienced stable disease or better f or more than 6 months .34  
 
COG ADVL0918 is a Phase I study of irinotecan, temozolomide, and temsirolimus. Irinotecan 
(90 mg/m2/dose) and temozolomide ( dose bei ng esc alated stepwise from 100 to 150  mg/m2/dose) are both 
given orally on a daily x 5 days schedule. Doses of temsirolimus are delivered intravenously on Days  1 and 
8 of a 3 -week cycle. The 3 -drug combination was well tolerated when temsirolimus was given  at doses up 
to 35 mg/m2/dose. Observed toxicities included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, 
nausea/vomiting, mucositis, and elevated transaminases. Following administration of fixed doses of 
irinotecan and temozolomide in combination with 25 mg /m2/dose temsirolimus, 2  patients who had been 
receiving chronic steroids developed dose -limiting hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].  
 
The study was amended to preclude enrollment of children who require chronic steroid administration, and 
dose-limiting lipi[INVESTIGATOR_732072]. The combination of a 
temsirolimus dose of 35 mg/m2/dose in combination with irinotecan (90 mg/m2/dose daily x 5 days) and 
temozolomide (100 mg/m2/dose daily x 5 days) has been shown to be well tolerated, and th is dose of 
temsirolimus will be used in th is study.  
 
Among [ADDRESS_1000026] had objective 
responses to protocol therapy. A total of 10 patients with neuroblastoma had been enrolled as of May 2012. 
One of these children experienced a prolonged partial response (14 cycles; confirmed by [CONTACT_9559])  
and 2  experienced stable disease for >7 months.35 
 
2.3.3  Rationale for closure of Regimen  A (Amendment #5) 
A total of 18 eligible patients were randomized to ANBL1221 Regimen A during Stage 1 of the activity 
design. The regimen was found to be safe and feasibility was demon strated, however only 1 objective 
response (PR) was observed. As per Section 9.3.4 of this protocol, if there are 3 or fewer responders on a 
given regimen, this constitutes insufficient evidence of activity for the regimen. For this reason, there will 
be no further enrollments to Regimen A.

Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_1000027] been studied 
extensively. Early studies were performed using the murine IgG3 monoclonal antibody 3F8 .36,37 and murine 
IgG2a, 14G2a .39,40 3F8 has been shown to  mediate very efficient antitumor antibody dependent cytotoxicity 
(ADCC) in vitro  in the presence of GM -CSF.41 However, murine antibody therapy can be accompanied by 
[CONTACT_170566] a human anti -mouse antibody response ( HAMA ), which results in the formation of 
neutralizing antib odies. This can be particularly problematic in patients who have not received high dose 
chemotherapy or undergone myeloablative treatment within [ADDRESS_1000028] been developed . Ch14.18  
(dinutuximab)  consists of the variable regions of murine IgG3 b 14.[ADDRESS_1000029] shown that ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  has longer 
plasma half life and less immunogenicity when compared to the murine antibody, making it potentially 
more effective .11,43 Preclinical studies performed both in vitro and in vivo  indicate that its anti -
neuroblastoma activity involves complement dependent cytoto xicity (CDC) and ADCC when ch 14.[ADDRESS_1000030] efficacy, 
especially in patients with bone marrow disease .46 Phase I and II clinical trials of ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  or 
14G2a , alone or combined with  cytokines such as GM -CSF or IL2  respectively , also showed signals of 
activity in patients with neuroblastoma.47,[ADDRESS_1000031] demonstrated a significant 
decrease in risk of relapse and an improvement in survival for patients with high risk neuroblastoma in 
remission after initial multi -modality therapy. An early analysis of results of a Germa n study of ch14.18  
(dinutuximab)  therapy alone administered to patients > 1 year of age with Stage 4 neuroblastoma did not 
demonstrate a decrease in recurrence risk compared to no further therapy.49 However, analyses at 9 years 
from therapy revealed a statistical ly significant improvement in EFS for those patients who received 
ch14.18  (dinutuximab) .50 A randomized Phase  III study (COG ANBL0032) of ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  
combined with GM -CSF, interleukin [ADDRESS_1000032] -
consolidation therapy for patients in remission was stopped early because the EFS of patients treated with 
the antibody containing regimen was clearly superior to th at of patients treated with isotretinoin alon e.51 
Thus, although few patients with measurable bulk disease experienced objective responses to ch14.18  
(dinutuximab)  as a single agent in early phase clinical trials, ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  plus cytokine therapy 
is now considered standard post -consolidation care for patients with high -risk neuroblastoma.  
 
The clinical evaluation of various anti -GD2 monoclonal antibodies in children with neuroblastoma has been 
largely focused on treatment of minimal residual disease to date. However, several studies conducted in 
adults with cancer suggest that monoclonal antibodies can be effectively combined with chemotherapy to 
treat patien ts, including those with measurable disease .52-59  
 
2.4.3  Combinati on of ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  with chemotherapy  
In the currently proposed study, ch14.18  (dinu tuximab)  will be given in combination with irinotecan and 
temozolomide in an effort to augment the activity of the antibody in a setting other than that of minimal 
residual disease. Preclinical studies  also indicate that anti -GD2 antibodies enhance the eff ects of

chemotherapy. This has been shown in a small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell line60 and in a neuroblastoma 
cell line .[ADDRESS_1000033] study with SCLC cell line, the combination of cisplatin (CDDP) with an anti -GD2 
mAb resulted in prominent enhancement of cytotoxicity even in cells with low to moderate GD2 expression. 
The anti -GD2 monoclonal antibo dy induced weak activation of c -Jun terminal kinase (JNK) in SCLC cells, 
and all anti -cancer drugs also induced its activation to various degrees. When CDDP and an anti -GD2 
antibody were used together, significantly augmented JNK activation was observed wi th corresponding 
cytotoxic effects, suggesting that synergistic phosphorylation of JNK with [ADDRESS_1000034] additive (carboplatin) or synergistic (doxorubicin, topotecan) effects on cell  killing .[ADDRESS_1000035]  the B -cell specific antigen CD20, causes 
complement and antibody -dependent cell -mediated toxicity. The combination of rituximab with 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) was associated with statistically 
significantly higher co mplete response rates in patients with diffuse large B -cell lymphoma compared to 
CHOP alone. The addition of rituximab to standard chemotherapy was shown to significantly decrease the 
risk of treatment failure and death among patients in this trial .62 Subsequent studies confirmed the 
contribution of rituximab in combination with CHOP in adults with lymphoma, and the long -term benefit 
of this combination has been d emonstrated .52  
 
Although the mechanism of action of monoclonal antibodies that interfere with signal transduction within 
tumor cells is somewhat different fro m that of antibodies that mediate ADCC, the concept of using  
monoclonal antibodies together with chemotherapy is also supported by [CONTACT_732145]. Trastuzumab binds to the extracellular domain of the HER -2/neu receptor tyrosine k inase and 
disrupts receptor dimerization .63 This antibody has been successfully combined with chemotherapy 
(doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) for women with HER -[ADDRESS_1000036] cancer for more 
than a decade, leading to increased response rate, prolonged progression free and overall survival .53 
Cetuximab is a c himeric antibody that binds to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) and 
competitively inhibits the binding of ligands including epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] (EGF) and transforming 
growth factor alpha. Binding of cetuximab to the EGFR decreases activation  of receptor -associated kinases 
and inhibits cell growth and proliferation .64 This agent is approved for use in combination with irinotecan 
in patients with EGFR -expressing metastatic colorectal cancer refractory to irinotecan -based therapy .65  
 
2.5 Transition from NCI Manufactured Ch14.18 to UTC Manufactured Ch14.18  (dinutuximab)   
The investigational agent, chimeric monoclonal anti -GD2, ch14.18, used in ANBL0032 and ANBL1221 
was provided and manufactured by [CONTACT_732146] 2001 and Feb ruary  2013, 
respectively.  
 
As of January 21, 2014, the ch14.18 , dinutuximab  (NSC 764038) distributed by [CONTACT_732147], Inc. The ch14.18 (NSC 623408) manufactured by [CONTACT_732148]. The NCI has continued to distribute the agent through th e 
Pharmaceutical Management Branch, under the same IND. However, the dosing calculation was adjusted 
in order to reflect the change from a theoretical extinction coefficient used by [CONTACT_732149] a calculated 
extinction coefficient used by [CONTACT_100003] . This adjustment was necessary in order to ensure the 
delivery of the same amount of ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  as for those patients treated prior to Jan 21, 201 4.

2.6 Rationale  for Further Study of Regimen  B 
A total of 17 patients were randomized to Regimen  B therapy. Sixteen of these received treatment while 
one declined therapy following randomization. During a safety phase in which 6 patients were treated, one 
patient experienced unacceptable toxicity as defined in Section 9.3.3. This patient experienced Grade 4 
hypoxia and required mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours. Of the 16 patients treated with 
Regimen B therapy, 11 patients required dose modifications. Among these patients, five required 
temozolomide dose modifications. In one patient the dose was modified due to a formulation issue, and in 
one the temozolomide dose was modified due to emesis. In 3 patients temozolomide dosing was modified 
due to hematologic toxicity (neutropenia and thrombocytopenia),  mostly during later cycles,  however al l 
patients continued protocol therapy uninterrupted. An additional six patients required dinutuximab dose 
modifications, including one patient with protocol -defined unacceptable toxicity, and one with Grade 4 
bronchospasm. In both cases protocol therapy wa s discontinued. The remaining four patients required 
dinutuximab dose modifications due to pain (two), infection (one) and hypotension (one). However these 
patients all continued therapy without toxicity that required  additional dose modification. After re view of 
the cases in which doses were modified, the study committee and the data safety monitoring committee 
determined that no changes in drug dosing as described in Section 4 are required.  However, to further assess 
the feasibility of delivering this reg imen, evaluation of toxicity in additional patients is needed . 
 
Response to therapy was also assessed. Analysis of data available as of January 15, 2016 shows that among 
the 17 patients assigned to Regimen B, nine had objective responses (5 CR, 4 PR). Resp onses were observed 
in patients with both relapsed/progressive disease (5/10; 3 PR, 2 CR)  and refractory (4/7; 3 CR, 1 PR)  
disease. Among Regimen B responders, prior frontline therapy included high dose chemotherapy with stem 
cell rescue in 5 and anti -GD2 therapy in 3 patients. The protocol -defined minimum number of responses 
required to deem Regimen B worthy of additional study was exceeded during Stage 1. However, the 
confidence intervals around the 53% response rate for Regimen B are wide (95% CI: 0.31, 0.74) . In 
addition, the small number of patients treated with Regimen B therapy precludes subgroup analyses that 
are important for application of the findings to the overall population of patients with neuroblastoma. To 
allow further study of feasibility a nd to more accurately estimate the response rate to this therapy, additional 
patients will be assigned to Regimen B to permit accrual of a total of 50 eligible  patients.  
 
2.7 Additional Studies  
2.7.1 Rationale for studying naturally occurring anti -glycan antibodies  
Administration of ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  is often associated with allergic reactions, which may occur even 
during the first infusion. Natural occurring antibodies to non -human glycans, galactose alpha -1,3-galactose 
(alpha -gal) and Neu5Gc, are pre sent in all humans .66 Ch14.18  (dinutuximab) , which is produced in rodent 
cells, contains alpha -gal and Neu5Gc. Levels of anti -alpha -gal have been correlated with allergic reactions 
to cetuximab (Erbitux), a chimeric antibody against the EGF receptor that is extensive ly modified with 
these glycans .67 Thus, it is possible that the presence and/or levels of antibodies to these non -human glycans 
may correlate with allergic reacti ons to ch14.18  (dinutuximab) , and the levels of anti -glycan antibodies may 
increase after serial courses of immunotherapy. The presence and/or level of antibodies to non -human 
glycans may affect the blood levels of ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  and ultimately impa ct response to therapy.   
 
2.7.2 Rationale for NK cell receptor NKp30 isoform  
The natural killer (NK) cell receptor NKp30 is selectively expressed by [CONTACT_732150]-cells and plays a n 
important  role in triggering NK -mediated cytotoxicity. NKp30 is also involved in the cross -talk between 
NK and dendritic cells.  The three NKp30 splice variants68 have been shown to be of prognostic significance 
in gastrointestinal sarcoma (GIST), a malignancy that expresses NKp30 ligands and that is treated with 
NK-stimulatory KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Healthy individuals and those with GIST show distinct 
patterns of transcription of functionally different NKp30 isoforms. In individuals with GIST, predominant 
expression of the immunosuppressive NKp30 c isoform (co mpared to the immunostimulatory NKp30a and

Version Date: 05/18/2017   Page 19 
NKp30b isoforms) was associated with reduced survival, decreased NKp30 -dependen t tumor necrosis 
factor -α (TNF -α), IL10  and CD107a release, and defective secretions of interferon -γ (IFN -γ) and 
interleukin -12 (IL -12) in the NK -DC cross -talk that could be restored by [CONTACT_732151] -10.69 In a recent 
French study, an  association between high levels of the immunosuppressive Nkp30 c-isoform  and worse 
prognosis (PFS p-value= 0.01 ) of patients with high risk neuroblastoma has been reported . No impact o f 
the Nkp30 a-isoform was noted .[ADDRESS_1000037] of NKp30 isoforms i ncluding the NKp30 c-isoform  may be more pronounced  in 
patients receiving either ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  or temsirolimus  therapy.  
 
2.7.3  Rationale for KIR/KIR -L genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_732073] -Immunoglobulin -like Receptors (KIR) recognize specific HLA molecules, regulate f unction of 
human NK cells and control their self -tolerance. The interactions between KIR on donor NK cells and KIR 
ligands (KIR -L) on recipi[INVESTIGATOR_732074] -tumor efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation , and influence the a ntitumor effects of autologous transplantation . Since the genes encoding 
KIR and KIR -L are inherited independently, it is possible for an individual to be KIR -receptor ligand 
mismatched with oneself. In a COG phase II study of 38 relapsed/refractory neurob lastoma receiving 
humanized anti-GD2 linked to IL2, 7 of 24 mismatched patients experienced either complete response or 
improvement of their disease after immunocytokine therapy, while there was no response or comparable 
improvement of disease in 14 patien ts who were matched (p = 0.03)72. These data suggest  that patients with 
KIR receptor -ligand mismatch may be associated with better clinical response to immunotherapy with an 
anti-GD2  antibody . KIR and KIR ligand genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_732075].  
 
2.7.4  Rationale  for Fc receptor genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_732076], the anti -tumor activities of unconjugated monoclonal antibodies  require the contribu tion of 
either complement or Fcγ receptor (FcγR) -expressing effector cells in order to achieve tumor cell killing. 
However, because most tumor cells, including neuroblastoma, express increased amounts of complement -
inhibiting proteins  that protect the cell s against lysis by [CONTACT_30937], antibody -dependent cell cytotoxicity 
(ADCC) is considered the key antitumor mechanism of therapeutic antibodies in vivo . Most n atural killer 
(NK) cells, certain subpopulations of T lymphocytes, as well as monocytes and granul ocytes are capable of 
mediating ADCC against antibody -coated targets via their expression of FcγR for IgG. The FcγR genes 
display polymorphisms that greatly influence the affinity of IgG for the Fcγ receptor. NK cells bearing the 
FcγRIIIa -158V/V allele med iate ADCC more effectively than those with F/F allele. Similarly, for FcγRIIA, 
the high -affinity H allele at [ADDRESS_1000038] been  reported to influence the 
response of lymphoma to rituximab (anti -CD20)73,74. More recently the Fc γRIIc molecules have also been 
shown to influence ADCC; polymorphisms at this locus c an influence expression vs. lack of expression 
(function vs. lack of function) of this FcγRIIc.  Recently, it has been  shown that an algorithm incorporating 
polymorphism d ata for FcγRIIa, FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIc is associated with clinical benefit in an  
immunotherapy trial for adults with renal cell carcinoma .75 Because dinutuximab  is very effective in 
mediating ADCC, its efficacy in neuroblastoma may be associated with Fc receptor  genotype. The 
association between Fc recepto r genotype and response to irinotecan/temozolimide/dinutuximab therapy  
will be examined . 
 
2.7.5  Rationale for HACA testing  
Analysis  of samples from a Phase 1  trial of a humanized anti -GD2 antibody ( hu14.18K322A ) conducted at 
St. Jude Children’s Research Ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_307]76 has shown that sera obtained prior to therapy from 9 of 38 patients 
contained Pre-existing Anti-Therapeutic Antibodies (PATA) th at reacted against the anti -GD2 antibody 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/2017   Page 20 
although there subjects had  no prior exposure to any monoclonal antibody . Initial  analyses of the 
immunologic reactivity pattern of the sera from these 9 PATA+ patients revealed that  these PATA are not 
anti-idiotypic antibodies against the therapeutic hu14 .18K322A mAb. Unexpectedly, these  PATA bound  
to other human IgG1 mAbs (rituximab, trastuzumab), pooled human IgG (Gammagard), and also to the 
anti-GD2 chimeric antibody dinutuximab. However, they did not bind to  the parental mouse anti -GD2 mAb 
(14.G2a). The presence of PATA may be linked to patient outcome. Of the 38 initially evaluable patients , 
only 4 were known to be in remission or without progressio n 2.5 years following treatment. All  4 of these 
patients were among the 9 found to to PATA positive  (p= 0 .002) . (Paul Sondel, personal communication ) 
This preliminary observation requires further study, however it suggests that  these PATA  recognize a 
shared IgG1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] (also known as an antibody -allotype)[ADDRESS_1000039] human IgG1 antibodies, 
but is “foreign” to the 9 PATA+ p atients who may have been  immunized via exposure to allo -IgG1 in prio r 
transfusions). PATA/anti -alloantibodies may potentially augment the efficacy of tumor reactive therapeutic 
antibodies  and may represent some of the antibody reactivity identified in prior “human anti -chimeric 
antibody (HACA)” assays. An understanding of the role of PATA/anti -allotype biology may aid in the 
selection of patients for GD2 directed immunotherapy. The association between r esults of testing for the 
presence HACA, anti -idiotype and PATA/anti -allotype antibody (not directed against the dinutuxima b 
idiotype) with response to study therapy  will be examined .  
 
2.7.[ADDRESS_1000040] 
been linked to neuropat hic pain . Therefore the association between serum cytokine levels (IL1, IL6, TNF -
alpha, IFN -gamma , etc) with toxicity and response to therapy merit evaluation.   
 
2.7.7  Rationale for assessment of the tumor microenvironment  
Tumor -infiltrating leukocytes (TI Ls) can act as critical participants in tumor progression , and the presence 
of tumor -associated macrophages (TAMs) has been associated with poor prognosis in many adult cancers. 
In neu roblastoma , expression levels of genes related to M2 polarization of mac rophages may be prognostic  
in patients with high -risk disease.79 The importance of inflammatory pathways in neuroblastoma 
progression reinforces the concept that the tumor microenvironment  may be important in resistance to 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_732077] i n neuroblastomas and other pediatric malignancies.80,81 In this study, 
the association between levels of i nfiltrating TILs (including TAMs) in tumor samples with response and 
outcome following dinutuximab and irinotecan/temozolomide  will be examined . In addition, because 
immune checkpoint proteins CD274 (PDL1) and CD276 (B7H3) affect the activity of T and NK c ells,82-[ADDRESS_1000041] in patients 
treated with dinutuximab and irinotecan/temozolomide. RNA samples obtained prior to and following 
therapy and samples collected after administration of dinutuximab/irinotecan/temozolomide will be used 
for analysis of expression of a panel of genes related to immune function (including cell surface receptors, 
proteases, cytokines and cytokine receptors, ce ll cycle and protein kinases, etc) and for more global analysis 
via RNASeq. Gene expression stu dies will also include assessment of  tumor burden in the circulating blood 
using the NB5 assay. This assay quantifies expression of CHGA, DCX, DDC, PHOX2B, and T H with a 
sensitivity of one tumor cell among 106 normal blood mononuclear cells.  The results of this assay can be

Version Date: 05/18/2017   Page 21 
used to correlate expression of immune related genes to tumor burden levels.  
 
2.7.9  Rationale for analysis of circulating GD2 levels  
The gang lioside composition of neuroblastoma cells was studied decades ago,85 yet much remains to be 
learned regarding the relationship between the presence of gangliosides on neuroblastoma cells (particularly 
GD2) and response to anti-GD2 based therapy. Because se rial tumor sampling is not possible in young 
children receiving neuroblastoma therapy, methods for detection of GD2 shed from the surface of 
neuroblastoma cells have been developed. A high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/tandem 
mass spectrometry ( MS/MS) assay for enhanced detection of GD2 in plasma and serum has recently been 
validated  (A. Desai, personal communication) . The level of GD2 detectable at baseline may be predictive 
of response to the combination of irinotecan, temozolomide and dinutuxi mab. Alternatively, changes in 
levels of GD2 following treatment with this combination may be more informative.  
 
2.7.[ADDRESS_1000042] likely to benefit from the combination of irinotecan, 
temozolimide and dinutuximab.  
 
2.7.11 Revised International Neuroblastoma Respo nse Criteria  
The International Neuroblastoma (NB) Response Criteria (INRC) provide a common basis for comparisons 
of response across clinical trials conducted throughout the world. While these criteria have proven to be 
extremely helpful over time, they we re last updated in 1993. Since that time, it has become apparent that 
the current INRC guidelines suffer from significant limitations, particularly with respect to definitions of 
response at metastatic sites (bone and bone marrow). The INRC provide limited  guidance for incorporation 
of now -standard imaging modalities (123I-MIBG imaging), and they provide no guidance for incorporation 
of FDG -PET. Furthermore, the criteria that were applicable in the early to mid -1990s do not address modern 
techniques for qua ntification of marrow disease. A National Cancer Institute -sponsored international 
meeting was held in [ADDRESS_1000043] oma Therapy (NANT), Society 
of Paediatric Oncology European Neuroblastoma Network  (SIOP -EN) and Gesellschaft für Pädiatrische 
Onkologie und Hämatologie ( GPOH) contemporary  clinical trials were analyzed. Individual response 
components of a revised INRC will  include primary tumor dimensions using anatomic imaging, and 
metastatic disease assessment using 123I-MIBG imaging. For patients with MIBG non -avid disease, FDG -
PET will be used for metastatic imaging. Furthermore, in addition to bone marrow morphologic a ssessment, 
immunocytochemistry will be used to assess the burden of neuroblastoma in the marrow. An updated 
version of the INRC (including definitions of complete response, partial response, stable disease, and 
progressive disease) is expected to be finali zed by [CONTACT_5638] 2012. Until that time, for patients on the 
current trial, data regarding each component of response (cross sectional imaging, functional imaging, 
marrow assessment) in the revised INRC will be collected to permit subsequent comparisons of  response 
using the older and newer criteria.

Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_1000044] promising during this selection design study will be integrated into frontline 
therapy for patients with high -risk neuroblastoma in 1 of 2 ways. One option would be to integrate the entire 
cassette of irinotecan, temozolomide and the “winner” from this trial as salvage therapy for the treatment 
of patients with disease that is refractory to initial induction therapy. Recent analyses of end -induction 
MIBG scan s for patients enrolled on COG A3973 indicate that 3 year event free survival for patients with 
Curie scores >5 following multi -agent chemotherapy was less than 10% .87 Integration of a novel therapeutic 
cassette containing cytotoxics with either temsirolimus or ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  may improve disease 
response for these patients prior to proceeding to myeloablative consolidation therapy.  
 
Alternatively, the agent ide ntified as the “winner” during this trial could be integrated into induction therapy 
for all patients with high -risk disease. While the 3 -year EFS in patients with end -induction Curie scores >  5 
is extremely poor, survival even among patients with better e nd-induction Curie scores (≤  5) is still less 
than 50 %87 and 20% of patients will experience disease progression during induction therapy. Thus, there 
is considerable  room for improvement among all patients with high -risk neuroblastoma. Toxicity data 
generated during the current trial will inform decision -making regarding the best approach to integrating 
the “winner” into upfront therapy. Given the known toxicity of hi gh-risk neuroblastoma chemotherapy

2.8.[ADDRESS_1000045] disease that  is refractory to current 
induction therapy. It is therefore critical to integrate agents that target specific biologic pathways critical to 
neuroblastoma survival. Temsirolimus and ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  have shown activity against 
neuroblastoma in both in vitro  and in vivo  animal models, and have been shown to be safe and tolerable in 
pediatric Phase I trials. This will be the first attempt to move molecularly targeted agents in combination 
with chemotherapy into front -line therapy in this important pediat ric disease. We expect that at least one of 
these agents will move forward to a randomized Phase III trial as part of induction therapy for high -risk 
neuroblastoma. Alternatively, one of these agents could be used in a regimen for patients refractory to in itial 
induction therapy. Furthermore, this trial design will serve as a model for testing of molecularly targeted 
agents for integration into neuroblastoma therapy.

4.0 TREATMENT PROGRAM  
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical interventions are 
based on schedules derived from the experim ental design or on established standards of care. Minor 
unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease evaluations (and 
up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family logistical, or facility, procedu re and/or 
anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per COG administrative Policy 5.14 (except where explicitly 
prohibited within the protocol).  
 
4.1 Overview of Treatment Plan  
As of  Amendment #5, patients will only be assigned to Regimen B therapy.  Patients on Regimen B will 
receive irinotecan/temozolomide/ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  followed by [CONTACT_732157] ( GM-CSF) . 
 
Treatment cycles will be repeated every 21 days  (3 weeks) . Tumor response will be assessed after Cycles  2, 
4, 6 and every 4  cycles thereafter until the end of protocol therapy. Patients with CR, PR or SD may continue 
to receive the assigned therapy for a maximum of 17 cycles (approximately 1 year).

CAG for suggestions on hydration, or hydrate according to institutional guidelines.  
 
If there is a change in the patient’s clinical cond ition  between the time of study enrollment and the 
start of protocol therapy, relevant organ function studies should be repeated to determine whether 
the patient should receive protocol therapy . If there are questions  regarding a patient with an 
evolving c linical status , please contact [CONTACT_732158].  
 
 
4.1.1  Concomitant Medications and Supportive Care  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Diarrhea prophylaxis  
Cefixime (8 mg/kg/day PO once daily) or an available equivalent oral cephalosporin  (eg, cefpodoxime 
(VantinTM) 10 mg/kg/day PO divided bid, maximum dose 400 mg/day)  should be started 2 days prior to the 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_1000071] dose of irinotecan for a total of 10  days in 
each cycle.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pneumocystis prophylaxis  
Patients must  receive pneumocystis prophylaxis during study therapy.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Other anti -cancer therapy  
No other systemic anti -cancer therapy will be permitted. Radiotherapy to localized painful lesions is 
acceptable, provi ded at least one measurable/MIBG evaluable lesion is not irradiated. Lesions irradiated 
during protocol therapy will not  be used to assess tumor response. Patients should be evaluated prior to 
radiotherapy with appropriate tumor imaging. If measurable or e valuable progressive disease is documented 
after enrollment then the patient should be taken off protocol therapy.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Corticosteroid therapy  
Pharmacologic doses of systemic corticosteroids should be used ONLY for life -threatening conditions (ie, 
life-threatening allergic reactions and anaphylaxis such as bronchospasm, stridor) unresponsive to other 
measures. The use of dexamethasone as an anti -emetic is not permitted. Corticosteroid therapy can be used 
as a premedication for transfusion in patients kn own to have a history of transfusion reactions or for 
treatment of an unexpected transfusion reaction (hydrocortisone 2 mg/kg or less or an equivalent dose of 
an alternative corticosteroid). The use of steroids during protocol therapy requires clear justif ication 
and documentation.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Other supportive care  
Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, anti -emetics, fluids, electrolytes and general supportive care are to 
be used as necessary. Note : aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (Emend) should not be used as an anti-emetic.  The use of gabapentin 
as an adjunct for patients receiv ing ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  should be considered.  
 
For COG Supportive Care Guidelines see:  
https://members.childrensoncologygroup.org/prot/reference_materials.asp  under Standard Sections for 
Protocols.  
 
 
4.2 Patients on Regimen B: Irinotecan/Temozolomide with ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  
Each chemotherapy cycle lasts 21 days (3 weeks).  Patients will receive up to a maximum of 17 cycles of 
chemotherapy.  
 
A cycle may be repeated every 21 days if the patient has s table disease or better, and has again met 
laboratory parameters as defined in the eligibility section (Section 3.2 ) except for the following repeat cy cle 
modified starting criteria:  ALT ≤ [ADDRESS_1000072]  provided that  the usual causes of transaminitis such as infections, 
tumor progression, or drug toxicity are excluded by [CONTACT_732159].  
 
Drug doses should be adjusted based on the BSA calculated fr om height and weight obtained within one 
week  prior to the beginning of each cycle.  
 
Temozolomide : PO  
Days: 1 -5 
Dose: 100 mg/m2/dose  for patients ≥  0.5m2. The maximum dose to be administered is 200 mg. For patients 
whose body surface area is <0.5m2, dosing is based on body weight in kg (see Appendix II ). 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_1000073] to food is 
suggested. Preferably, administer on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after food) to 
decrease nausea and vomiting and improve absorption. The whole dose, even if comprised of severa l 
capsule sizes, should be taken at one time at approximately the same time each day. Bedtime administration 
may decrease nausea and vomiting. For patients whose body surface area is ≥ 0.5m2, the temozolomide 
dose should be rounded off to the nearest 5 mg (round 2.5 mg down, see Appendix II ). For ease of 
swallowing, the capsule content may be mixed with applesauce or juice (see instructions in Appendix IV ) 
or an oral suspension may be compounded (see drug monograph in Section 6.5 ). If emesis occurs within 20 
minutes of taking a dose of temozolomide, then the dose may be rep eated once. If emesis occurs after 20 
minutes, the dose should not be repeated.  
 
Administration of PO temozolomide should be documented; missed doses should be noted on the therapy 
delivery map  and/or in accordance with institutional policy/procedures.  
 
Special precautions: Temozolomide capsules are available in [ADDRESS_1000074] be dispensed at one time. See drug monograph for additional details and examples.  
 
Irinotecan : IV over 90 minutes  
Days: 1 -5 
Dose: 50 mg/m2/dose  (regardless of BSA)  
Note : Irinotecan should be administered at least 1 hour after the temozolomide has been given.   
Higher incidence of cholinergic symptoms has been reported with more rapid infusion rates. To avoid 
extravasation; the use of a central line is suggested.  
 
ch14.18  (dinutuximab) : IV as detailed below  
Days: 2 -5 
Dose: 17.5 mg/m2/dose (regardless of BSA) . 
 
Sargramostim ( GM-CSF ): SubQ (preferred) or IV as detailed below  
Days: 6 -12 
Dose: 250 mcg/m2/dose  (regardless of BSA)  
Detailed administration guidelines for chemotherapy a nd ch4.18 and GM-CSF  (Days 2 -5) follow:  
 
• At hour 0 p atient should receive oral temozolomide . 
• At hour 1 patient should start IV irinotecan over 90 minutes and on days patient  is receiving ch14.18  
(dinutuximab)  infusion (D ays 2 -5 of each cycle) start IVF bol us of normal saline (≥  10 mL/kg) 
over one  hour. 
• At hour 2. 5: on days patient  is receiving ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  infusion ( Days 2 -5 of each cycle), 
start ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  infusion. Each daily dose of ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  should be infused 
IV over appr oximately 10  hours, starting at 0.88  mg/m2/hr x 0.5 hr, then increasing to 
1.75 mg/m2/hr for the remainder of the dose, if tolerated. The infusion duration may be extended 
up to 20 hours for anticipated toxicities (pain, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypo tension), not 
responding to other supportive measures, and the duration used should be recorded.   
• The maximum infusion time is 20 hours; ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  administration must be stopped 
after 20 hours even if the total dose has not been administered.  The total dose given in 20 hours 
should be recorded.  
• Recommended premedications include : 
o Hydroxyzine ( 0.5-1 mg/kg; max dose 50 mg) PO or diphenhydramine (0.5 -1 mg/kg; max 
dose 50 mg) IV over 10 minutes to start approximately 20 minutes prior to ch14.18  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/2017   Page 33 
(dinutuximab)  infusion; may be repeated every 6 hours as needed during ch14.18  
(dinutuximab)  infusion . Note : intravenous hydroxyzine is NOT recommended.  
o Acetaminophen (10 mg/kg; max dose 650 mg) PO given approximately 20 minutes prior 
to ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  infusion; may be repeated every 4 -6 hours as needed for fever .  
• Recommended pain management : 
o Morphine sulfate loading dose immediately prior to ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  administration. 
A dose of 50  mcg/kg is recommended, though this may be adjusted based on a  given 
patient’s pain history . 
o Continue with morphine sulfate drip titrated to effect. The recommended dose range for 
the continuous infusion is 20 -50 mcg/kg/hr to continue for 2 hours after completion of the 
ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  infusion.  
o Other narcotics  such as hydromorphone or fentanyl can be used.  
o Gabapentin may be used in conjunction with other pain medications per institutional 
practice . 
o The u se of additional pain medications (lidocaine, ketamine) in extenuating circumstances 
should be undertaken in  consultation with pediatric pain management specialists . 
▪ For example, a lidocaine infusion may be used in conjunction with IV bolus of 
morphine on prn basis. Suggested administration guidelines for a lidocaine 
infusion are shown below:  
• Give lidocaine IV b olus at 2 mg/kg in 50 mL NS over 30 min prior to the 
start of ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  infusion.  
• At the beginning of ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  infusion, start IV lidocaine 
infusion at 1  mg/kg/hr and continue until two hours after the completion 
of ch14.18  (dinutu ximab)  infusion.  
• May give morphine IV bolus 25 -50 microgram/kg every 2h prn pain.  
• Patient should be monitored closely for sedation scale, EKG (rate and 
rhythm), HR, BP, RR, oxygen saturation (pulse oximeter) and pain score. 
If patient develops dizziness, p erioral numbness, tinnitus attributable to 
lidocaine, then stop lidocaine infusion.  
• Monitoring during ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  infusion : 
o Vital signs should be assessed every [ADDRESS_1000075] hour. More frequent 
assessment may be required based on the patient’s clinical condition. Between antibody 
doses, vitals should be assessed every [ADDRESS_1000076] observation of intake and output is required on the days  of ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  
administration . 
o Daily physical examination including a careful eye exam for pupi[INVESTIGATOR_732079] . 
o Patients should be weighed daily on the days of ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  administration . 
 
• Sargramostim ( GM-CSF) administration is to begin on Day 6 of each cycle : 
o The standard route of administration is subcutaneous; use of an insuflon catheter is 
permitted . 
o In extenuating circumstances, IV administration over [ADDRESS_1000077] be documented.

5.1.1 Dose -limiting neutropenia  
Patients who experience neutropenia th at causes a delay of ≥  [ADDRESS_1000088] the temozolomide dose reduced by 25% 
for subsequent cycles  (see dose reduction nomogram in Appendix III ). If patient experiences neutropenia 
that causes a delay of ≥  14 days again after this dose reduction, protocol therapy should be discontinued.  
 
5.1.2 Dose -limiting thrombocytopenia  
For patients who experience thrombocytopenia that causes a de lay of ≥  14 days between treatment cycles 
with or without other hematologic toxicities, the dose of temozolomide should be reduced by 25% for 
subsequent cycles  (see dose reduction nomogram in Appendix III ). If patient ex periences thrombocytopenia 
that causes a delay of ≥  14 days again  after this dose reduction, protocol therapy should be discontinued.  
 
5.1.3 Delayed recovery of platelets and neutrophils  
Patients who do not meet criteria to start the next treatment cycle (see Section 4.2) within 21  days after the 
planned subsequent cycle start date ( ie, there is a ≥ 3 week delay in start of next cycle) must be removed 
from protocol therapy.   
 
5.[ADDRESS_1000089] experienced non -hematologic toxicity should receive subsequent doses of study 
medications as described in the following sections.  
 
5.2.1 Dose modifications for diarrhea  
See Appendix V for pat ient/family instructions for supportive care measures for patients who develop 
therapy -associated diarrhea. Also included are specific instructions for loperamide dosing.  
 
• If Grade 4 therapy -associated diarrhea is experienced by a patient despi[INVESTIGATOR_732080] u se of anti -
diarrheal medications and appropriate use of prophylactic antibiotics, the dose of irinotecan 
should be reduced by 25% for subsequent cycles  (ie, irinotecan dose 37.5  mg/m2). 
• If Grade 4 therapy -associated diarrhea recurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_732081] e of irinotecan by 25%, 
the ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  dose should also be decreased by 25% for subsequent cycles  (ie, 
ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  dose 13.13 mg/m2). 
• If Grade 4 diarrhea recurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_7749] -diarrheals, prophylactic antibiotics, and 
the dose reductions, the patient should come off protocol therapy.  
 
5.2.2 Dose modifications for nausea and vomiting  
• For patients with Grade 4 regimen -related nausea and vomiting and for patients with Grade  3 
regimen -related nausea and vomiting >  7 days in dur ation who did not receive appropriate anti -
emetic therapy, adjustments in the anti -emetic regimen should be made during the next cycle

of therapy.  
• If severe regimen -related nausea and vomiting recurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_732082] -emetic usage, 
doses of irinoteca n and temozolomide should be reduced by 25% for subsequent cycles  (ie, 
irinotecan dose 37.5 mg/m2; for temozolomide see dose reduction nomogram in Appendix  III). 
• If severe regimen -related nausea and vomiting recurs despi [INVESTIGATOR_140009], the patient 
should come off protocol therapy.  
 
5.2.3 Dose modifications for dehydration  
• If dehydration is related to diarrhea or nausea/vomiting, the guidance in the preceding section 
should be followed.   
• If regimen -related ≥ Grade 3 dehydration persists for > 3 days in the absence of significant 
diarrhea or nausea/vomiting, doses of irinotecan and temozolomide should be reduced by 25% 
for subsequent cycles  (ie, irinotecan dose is 37.5 mg/m2; for temozolomi de see dose reduction 
nomogram in Appendix III ).  
• If ≥ Grade 3 regimen -related dehydration recurs and persists for > [ADDRESS_1000090], or GGT  
• If elevations in ALT, AST or GGT occur such that values are >  20x ULN for any duration of 
time OR > 10x ULN but < 20x ULN and persisting for > 7 days occur in patients receiving 
irinotecan, temozolomide, and ch14.18  (dinutuximab) /GM -CSF, the dose of ch14.18  
(dinutuximab)  should be reduced by 25% for subsequent cycles  (ie, ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  
dose: 13.13  mg/m2). For the purposes of this trial the ULN for ALT is defined as 45  U/L; 
institutional ULN values for AST and G GT should be used . If elevations of this magnitude 
involving same liver enzyme(s) recur despi[INVESTIGATOR_732083], the dose of ch14.18  
(dinutuximab)  should again be reduced by 25% for subsequent cycles  (ie, ch14.18  
(dinutuximab)  dose: 8.75 mg/m2). If the dose limiting elevations of the same liver enzyme(s) 
recur despi[INVESTIGATOR_732084], the patient should come off protocol therapy. An 
elevation in ALT that causes a delay of ≥  14 days between treatment cycles will also require a 
25% reduction in the dose of ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  for subsequent cycles  (ie, ch14.18  
(dinutuximab)  dose: 13.13  mg/m2). If a delay of ≥ 14 days between treatment cycles recurs due 
to elevation in ALT despi[INVESTIGATOR_140009], the patient should come off protocol therapy.  
 
5.2.5 ch14.18  (dinutuximab) /GM -CSF specific dose modifications and toxicity management 
recommendations  
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment of ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  induced hypotensio n (without evidence of allergic reaction)  
• If hypotension is severe and accompanied by [CONTACT_732161], end organ dysfunction, or 
acidemia – Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) guidelines should be followed  and 
ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  infusion should be dis continued.  
• In the absence of poor perfusion, end organ dysfunction or acidemia, moderate hypotension is 
defined as  
o Symptomatic decreases in blood pressure and/or  
o Systolic blood pressure (SBP) <  80 mmHg for age >  12 years  
o SBP <  70 mmHg for age 1 -12 years  
o SBP < 65 mmHg for age <  1 year   OR 
o SBP or DBP decreased by >  15% below baseline  
• If moderate hypotension is observed:  
o Immediately hold ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  
o Give normal saline bolus (20 mL/kg as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2595])  
o Stop or adjust doses of narcotics and sedat ing H1 blockers  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/2017   Page 39 
o Consider use of Trendelenberg position  
• If hypotension persists after the above measures have been taken:  
o Reassess perfusion and end organ function; follow PALS algorithm if needed  
o Repeat NS bolus  
o Consider use of albumin if albumin <  3 gm/dL  
o Consider use of PRBCs if Hb <  10 gm/dL  
o Consider transfer to intensive care setting  
• If hypotension persists following 2 volume boluses, give an additional bolus and prepare to 
administer pressors  
o Epi[INVESTIGATOR_732085]  
• Resumpti on of ch14.18  (dinutuximab)   
o For patients whose hypotension resolves promptly and completely with limited volume 
resuscitation  and without requirement for pressor support, ch14.8 may be restarted at 
50% of the previous infusion rate. The ch14.18  (dinutuxim ab) may be restarted on 
same day if it is possible to do so within 20 hours of the start of the day’s infusion. If 
blood pressures are stable for 2 hours, the infusion may be given at full rate for that 
day and subsequent days. If the patient again experie nces hypotension requiring 
multiple volume boluses (eg , > 60 m L/kg) when ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  is given at full 
rate but tolerates the 50% infusion rate, the remaining days’ doses of ch14.18  
(dinutuximab)  should be given at the 50% rate of infusion. If >  [ADDRESS_1000091] elapsed 
since the start of the infusion, restart ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  the following day.  
▪ If blood pressures are stable for 2 hours after resumption of ch14.18  
(dinutuximab)  at the reduced rate, the remainder of the antibody infusion 
may be gi ven at the full rate  
▪ If hypotension recurs at the reduced rate, the measures above should again 
be taken and no further ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  should be given that day. 
The antibody infusion may be restarted the following day after ensuring 
that the patient  is volume replete. The antibody rate upon resumption of 
treatment should be 50% of the initial rate. If blood pressures are stable 
for 2 hours, the infusion may be given at full rate for that day and 
subsequent days. If the patient’s blood pressures are o nly stable at the 50% 
rate and not at full rate, the remaining days’ doses of ch14.18  
(dinutuximab)  should be given at the 50% rate of infusion.  
o For patients who require multiple volume boluses for hemodynamic stabilization, 
ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  should be  resumed the following day at 50% of the initial 
infusion rate.  
▪ If blood pressures are stable for 2 hours after resumption of ch14.18  
(dinutuximab)  at the reduced rate, the remainder of the antibody infusion 
may be given at the full rate  
▪ If hypotension re curs at the reduced rate, the measures above should again 
be taken and no further ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  should be given that day. 
The antibody infusion may be restarted the following day after ensuring 
that the patient is volume replete. The antibody rate upon resumption of 
treatment should be 50% of the initial rate. If blood pressures are stable 
for 2 hours, the infusion may be given at full rate for that day and 
subsequent days. If the patient’s blood pressures are only stable at the 50% 
rate and not at full rate, the remaining days’ doses of ch14.18  
(dinutuximab)  should be given at the 50% rate of infusion.  
o For patients who require pressors for treatment of hypotension, if blood pressure is 
stable off pressors for at least 6 hours, administration of ch14 .18 (dinutuximab)  may 
be resumed at 50% of the initial infusion rate on the day following the hypotensive

(dinutuximab)  should not be given to patients who continue to requ ire pressor support. 
Patients who require pressor support for ≥ 24 hours due to treatment -related 
hypotension despi[INVESTIGATOR_732086]. Patients who again require pressor support when ch14.18  (dinutuximab ) is 
resumed should discontinue protocol therapy.   
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment of Allergic Reactions /Infusion Reactions

• Ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  should be discontinued for patien ts who develop dilated 
pupi[INVESTIGATOR_732099]. If papi[INVESTIGATOR_732100], the patient should receive ch14.1 8 
(dinutuximab)  at a dose that is 50% reduced compared to the prior dose. Full dose 
GM-CSF should be given. If the lower dose of ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  is tolerated 
without worsening of ocular toxicity, full dose ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  should be 
given in sub sequent courses. If visual toxicity worsens, the patient should 
discontinue all immunotherapy . 
• Dose reductions for changes in accommodation are not required  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of serum sickness  
• Identification of serum sickness – signs and symptoms include  arthralgias/arthritis, 
splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, glomerulonephritis in the presence of persistent 
fevers, cutaneous eruptions  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/2017   Page 43 
• Serum sickness typi[INVESTIGATOR_350476] [ADDRESS_1000094] 
previously been sensitized to the causative agent  
• Patients with ≥  Grade 3 serum sickness should discontinue protocol therapy.  
• For Grade 2 serum sickness, antihistamines should be prescribed  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of neurotoxicity  
• Patients who develop Grade 4 neurotoxicity should discontinue protocol therapy . 
• Ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  should be discontinued for the remainder of the current 
cycle  of therapy for patients who develop Grade 3 sensory neuropathy or Grade 3 
motor neuropathy. If abnormalities resolve by [CONTACT_732166] 50% dose of ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  (ie, ch14.18  
(dinutuximab)  dose: 8.75 mg/m2). If symptoms do not completely resolve or recur 
with ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  then the patient should discontinue protocol therapy . 
 
5.2.6 Management of GM -CSF related toxicit ies 
• Hold GM -CSF if total white blood cell count is >  50,000/ µL; resume at 50% dose when 
the count is <  20,000/ µL. Administer full dose with subsequent cycles and modify again if 
the count exceeds 50,000/ µL 
• Localized skin reactions to GM -CSF are common, and  GM-CSF can be continued when 
reactions are mild. Rotation of sites of injections is recommended rather than use of 
insuflon for subcutaneous injection when skin react ions occur. Consider use of 
antihistamines. If ≥  Grade 3 injection site reactions occur, stop GM -CSF for the current 
cycle and discontinue GM -CSF for subsequent cycles of therapy.  
• A syndrome characterized by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_1506], hypoxia, flushing, hypoten sion, syncope, 
and/or tachycardia has been reported following the administration of the first dose of GM -
CSF in a particular cycle. This syndrome generally resolves with symptomatic treatment 
and usually does not recur with subsequent doses of GM -CSF in th e same cycle of 
treatment. For safety purposes in this study, if such a “first dose reaction” occurs, the GM -
CSF dose will be reduced to 50% for the next dose  (ie, GM-CSF dose 125 mcg/m2). If a 
similar reaction occurs at the 50% dose, the GM -CSF will be di scontinued for that patient. 
If the first dose at 50% does not cause any recurrent severe symptoms, subsequent doses 
can be escalated back to 100%. If recurrent severe symptoms are observed at 100% dose, 
then the dose will be reduced to 50%. If 50% is tole rated, that dose should be administered 
for all subsequent protocol treatment for that patient. If recurrent severe symptoms are seen 
at the 50% dose, the GM -CSF will be discontinued for subsequent cycles of therapy.

6.1 CHIMERIC MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY  14.18     (05/12/17 ) 
(Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody  14.18; human/murine anti -GD2 monoclonal antibody; chimeric an ti-GD2; 
chimeric mAb 14.18; ch14.18 , dinutuximab , Unituxin® ) NSC#  764038 , IND#  4308  
 
Source and Pharmacology:  
Chimeric MOAB 14.18 (ch14.18 , dinutuximab ) is an anti -GD2 monoclonal antibody composed of the variable 
region heavy and light chain genes of the m urine mAb  14.G2a and the human constant region genes for heavy 
chain IgG 1 and light chain kappa. Ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  exerts its antitumor effect by [CONTACT_732167] G D2, an antigen found in human tumors of neuroectodermal or igin such as melanoma 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/2017   Page 44 
and neuroblastoma. This chimeric antibody has been shown to lyse melanoma and neuroblastoma  cells through 
the process of antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity and complement -dependent cytotoxicity. By 
[CONTACT_4122] G D2 antigen  on the cell surface, ch14.18 (dinutuximab)  may also prevent attachment of circulating 
malignant cell s to the extracellular matrix. Additionally, ch14.18 (dinutuximab)  mediates lysis of several 
melanoma and neuroblastoma cell lines in a dose dependent mann er in the presence of potent mediators of 
ch14.18  (dinutuximab) -dependent cytotoxicity, such as human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and 
granulocytes . This is most profound with neutrophils, especially in the presence of recombinant human 
granulocyte -macrophage colony -stimulating factor.  
 
The PK profile of ch14.18 (dinutuximab)  has been determined in adults with melanoma and children with 
neuroblastoma. Although the plasma clearance for both groups of patients follow a two -compartment 
model, circulating  antibody is cleared from the plasma at a much faster rate in children than adults (mean 
t½β = 66.6 ± 27.4 hours in children versus 123 ± 29 hours and 181 ± 73 hours in two adult trials, 
respectively). Maturation of the hepatic and renal systems with age is thought to impact on drug metabolism 
and elimination and could account for these differen ces. In general, the mAb half -life following the first 
course of treatment was longer than the half -lives following subsequent courses in a given patient.

Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR)  
for 
MoAb 14.18, chimeric (C H14.18, NSCs 623408 and 764038)  
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of reported 
and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform presentation of events by 
[CONTACT_6764]. In ad dition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited 
Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset 
of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are protocol spec ific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI 
(except as noted below).  Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  for further 
clarification. Frequency is provided based on 351 patients. Below is the CAEPR for MoAb 14.18, chimeric 
(CH14. 18).  
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next to the 
AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple investigational 
agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the low er of the grades to determine if expedited 
reporting is required.

Note : MoAb 14.18, chimeric (CH14.18) in combination with  other agents could cause an exacerbation of 
any adverse event currently known to be caused by [CONTACT_6767], or the combination may result in events 
never previously associated with either agent.  
 
Formulation and Stability:  
Ch14.18 (dinutuximab)  is pro vided as a sterile solution in single -dose vials containing 17.5 mg/5 mL (3.5 
mg/mL) in 20  mM Histidine, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween  [ADDRESS_1000095] vials should be stored in 
the refrigerator (2ºC to 8ºC). Stability studies of the intact vials are ongoin g.  
 
Withdraw the required dose of ch14.18 (dinutuximab)  from the vial(s) and inject the exact volume for the 
dose (17.5  mg/m2/dose) into a bag containing 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride. The use of a filter during 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_1000096] of ch14.18 (dinutuximab)  in NS is stable at room 
temperature for 24 hours when diluted to a concentration between 0.044 mg/mL and 0.56  mg/mL; however, 
the final dosage form should be prepared immediately prior to administration as there is a maximum 
infusion time of 20 hours. The minimum infusion time for the antibody infusion is 10 hours.  There is no 
need to keep emp ty or partially used vials of ch14.18  (dinutuximab) . 
 
Lot number information will be collected on the NCI Drug Accountability Re cord Form (DARF) (see the 
Agent Accountability section below).  
 
Guidelines for Administration :  
See Treatment , Dose Modifications  and/or Supportive Care sections of th e protocol . 
 
Patient Care Implications:  
Pain is  one of  the most common adverse effect s of ch14.18  (dinutuximab) . It is predominately neuropathic and 
manifests as abdominal cramps or back and extremity pain. Prophylactic administration of morphine by 
[CONTACT_732168]14.18  (dinutuximab) . Other narcotics such 
as hydromorphone or fentanyl can be used. Gabapentin may be used in conjunction with other pain medications 
per institutional practice. Use of additio nal pain medications (lidocaine, ketamine) in extenuating circumstances 
should be undertaken in consultation with pediatric pain management specialists . 
 
Acute allergic or infusion reactions are common and may include hypotension, urticaria, hypoxia, and d yspnea. 
Premedication with antihistamines and acetaminophen are required for ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  administration.  
 
Human anti -mouse antibodies (HAMA) may block the effectiveness of therapy by [CONTACT_732169] r immunotherapy. HAMA responses may also be associated with 
immune -complex related adverse events such as serum sickness and anaphylaxis. HAMA responses were 
detected in over 50% of the patients tested. Although no increase in allergic reactions has been o bserved in 
patients treated with ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  in the presence of HAMA, immune complex formation may have 
induced serum sickness in some patients.  
 
Supplier:   
Manufactured by [CONTACT_732170], DCTD, NCI.  Do not use co mmercial 
supply.  
 
Agent Ordering : 
NCI supplied agent may be requested by [CONTACT_079] (or their authorized designee) at each 
participating institution. Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) policy requires that agent be shipped

6.2 IRINOTECAN          (05/09/11)  
[CPT -11,Camptothecin -11,7-ethyl -10-(4-[1-pi[INVESTIGATOR_99200]] -1-pi[INVESTIGATOR_99200]) -carbonylox y-camptothecin), 
Camptosar®], NSC #616348          
 
Source and Pharmacology:   
Irinotecan is a semisynthetic water -soluble analog of camptothecin (a plant alkaloid isolated from 
Camptotheca acuminata) . Irinotecan is a prodrug that requires conversion, by [CONTACT_732171] -I inhibitor, SN -[ADDRESS_1000097] with the ternary complex 
formed by [CONTACT_99231] I, DNA, and either irinotecan  or SN -38. Renal excretion is a minor route of 
elimination of irinotecan. The majority of the drug is metabolized in the liver. SN -38 is conjugated to 
glucuronic acid and this metabolite has no anti -tumor activity. The extent of conversion of SN -38 to its 
glucuronide has been inversely correlated with the risk of severe diarrhea, because the other major route of 
SN-38 excretion is biliary excretion by [CONTACT_732172] (cMOAT) which 
presumably leads to mucosal injury. In addition, APC and NPC are oxidative metabolites of irinotecan 
dependent on the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. After intravenous infusion of irinotecan  in humans, irino tecan  
plasma concentrations decline in a multiexponential manner, with a mean terminal elimination half -life of 
about 6  to 12 hours. The mean terminal elimination half -life of the active metabolite SN -38 is about 
10 to 20 hours. Irinotecan  is 30% to 68% bo und to albumin and SN -38 is approximately 95% bound to 
albumin.

Formulation & Stability:   
Each mL of irinotecan injection contains 20  mg irinotecan  (on the basis of the trihydrate salt), 45  mg 
sorbitol, and 0.9  mg lactic acid. When necessary, pH has been adjusted to 3.5 (range, 3.0 to 3.8) with sodium 
hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. Irinotecan i s available in single -dose amber glass vials in 40  mg 
(2 mL),100  mg (5  mL), 300 mg (15 mL), and 500 mg (25 mL). Store at controlled room temperature 15° -
30°C (59° -86°F). Protect from light. It is recommended that the vial (and backing/plastic blister) shou ld 
remain in the carton until the time of use.  
 
Guidelines for Administration:  See Treatment  and Dose Modifications  sections of the protocol.  
 
Irinotecan must be dil uted prior to infusion. Irinotecan should be diluted in D5W, (preferred) or NS to a 
final concentration range of 0.12 -2.8 mg/mL. The solution is physically and chemically stable for up to 
24 hours at room temperature (approximately 25°C) and in ambient flu orescent lighting. Solutions diluted 
in D5W and stored at refrigerated temperatures (approximately 2° -8°C), and protected from light are 
physically and chemically stable for 48  hours. Refrigeration of admixtures using NS is not recommended 
due to a low and  sporadic incidence of visible particulates. Care should be taken to avoid extravasation; the 
use of a central line is suggested.

NSC #613795            
 
Source and Pharmacology:  
Sargramostim (recombinant human GM -CSF) is a glycoprotein produced in yeast ( S. cerevisiae ) by 
[CONTACT_12060]. r GM-CSF is a hematopoietic growth factor which supports survival, clonal 
expansion, and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. rGM -CSF induces partially committed 
progenitor cells to divide and differentiate in the g ranulocyte -macrophage pathways. rGM -CSF stimulates 
the production of monocytes, granulocytes, erythrocytes, and sometimes, megakaryocytes in the bone 
marrow. It also induces mature neutrophil and monocytes to increase phagocytosis, superoxide generation, 
ADCC, tumoricidal killing and cytokine production (IL -1 and tumor necrosis factor). Recombinant human 
GM-CSF is a glycoprotein of [ADDRESS_1000098] injection. The elimination t ½ ranges from 1.5 -2.7 hours after SubQ or IV 
administration.

Formulation and Stability:  
Sargramostim is available as a lyophilized sterile, white, preservative free powder with 250  mcg (1.4 million 
International Units) per vial and as a sterile, preserved injectable solution in a 500 mcg /mL (2.8 million 
International Units/mL) 1 mL vial.  The sargramostim reconstituted lyophilized vial contains 40  mg/mL 
mannitol, USP; 10 mg/mL sucrose, NF; and 1.2  mg/mL tromethamine, USP, as excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The liquid 
formulation also contains 1.1% benzyl alco hol (11  mg/mL).Store refrigerated at 2 -8°C (36 -46°F). Do not 
freeze or shake.  
 
Guidelines for Administration: See Treatment  and Dose Modifications  and Supportive Care sections of 
the protocol.  
 
Reconstitute lyophilized powder for injection with 1  mL SWFI or 1  mL Bacteriostatic Water for Injection. 
Use SWFI without benzyl alcohol for neonates, infants, and children <  [ADDRESS_1000099] the diluent at the side of the vial and gently 
swirl the contents to avoid foaming during dissolution. Avoid excessive or vigorous agitation; do not shake. 
Reconstituted solutions prepared with Bacteriostatic Wat er for Injection (0.9% benzyl alcohol) or the liquid 
preserved solution may be stored for up to [ADDRESS_1000100] entry into the vial at 2° -8°C 
(36°-46°F). Discard reconstituted solution after [ADDRESS_1000101] elapsed. Reconstituted solutions prepare d 
with SWFI (without preservative) should be administered as soon as possible and within 6  hours following 
reconstitution.  
 
Use sargramostim for subcutaneous injection without further dilution. Perform dilution for IV infusion in 
NS. If the final concentr ation is <  10 mcg/mL, add albumin (human) at a final concentration of 0.1% to the 
saline prior  to addition of sargramostim to prevent adsorption to the components of the drug delivery 
system. For a final concentration of 0.1% albumin (human), add 1  mg albu min (human) per 1  mL NS. For 
example, for a final volume of 50 mL NS, add 50 mg (or 1 mL) of 5% albumin [human]. Intravenous 
dilutions are stable for up to 48  hours at room temperature or refrigerated but should be used within 6  hours 
due to microbiologica l concerns. Do not use an in -line membrane filter for IV  infusion.

6.4 TEMOZOLOMIDE         (06/30/14 ) 
(Temodar, Temodal) NSC #362856  
 
Source and Pharmacology:   
An orally administered alkylating agent, a second generation imidazotetrazine. A prodrug of MTIC, 
temozolomide spontaneously decomposes to MTIC at physiologic pH . Exerts its effect by [CONTACT_12783] -linking DNA. 
This is likely a site specific alkylation at the O6-position of guanine with some effect at the N7  position. 
Temozolomide reaches its peak concentration in 1  hour. Food reduces the rate and extent of absorption. It  has 
an elimination half -life of 1.13  hr (intraperitoneally) and 1.29  hr (orally) with an oral bioavailability of 0.98. 
Total apparent body clearance is 100  mL/min/m2 and plasma elimination half -life is ~  100 minutes.  
 
The table below lists the anticipate d toxicity profile of temozolomide (oral):  
Incidence  Toxicities  
Common  
(>20% of patients)  Constipation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, alopecia, alanine 
aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, ataxia,

syndrome, leukemia secondary to oncology chemoth erapy, infections and 
infestations – other: Pneumocystis pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis, anaphylaxis, 
allergic reaction, hepatic failure  
Pregnancy & 
Lactation  Pregnancy Category D  
Adequate, well -controlled studies have not been conducted in humans. Women 
of childbearing potential should be advised against becoming pregnant while 
taking temozolomide and for at least 6 months following the end of therapy. 
Temozolomide administration to rats and rabbits at 3/8 and 3/4 the human dose 
resulted in the developmen t of malformations of the external organs, soft tissues, 
and skeleton. These animal studies also demonstrated embryolethality (increased 
resorptions) at similar doses. There is no information available regarding the 
transmission of temozolomide during lact ation; women should avoid 
breastfeeding while receiving temozolomide.  
 
Formulation and Stability:  
Temozolomide capsules are available in six different strengths (5, 20, 100, 140, 180, 250  mg). The capsules 
vary in size, color, and imprint according to st rength. In the US, capsules are packaged in 5 -count and 14 -
count bottles. In other countries temozolomide may be packaged in 5 -count, 14 -count or 20 -count bottles.  
Temozolomide capsules are stored at controlled room temperature.  
 
Guidelines for Administrat ion: See Treatment  and Dose Modifications  sections of the protocol.  
 
There is a potential for medication errors involving temozolomide capsules resulting in drug overd osages, 
which may have been caused by [CONTACT_95431]/taking the wrong number of capsules per day and/or product 
usage exceeding the prescribed dosing schedule.  
 
When dispensing, it is extremely important that prescribing and dispensing include clear instructio ns on 
which capsules, and how many of each capsule(s) are to be taken per day. Only dispense what is needed 
for the course, and clearly indicate how many days of dosing the patient will have and how many days are 
without temozolomide dosing. When counselin g patients, it is important for each patient/parent to 
understand the number of capsules per day and the number of days that they take temozolomide. It is also 
important for the patient/parent to understand the number of days that they will be off the medi cation.  
 
Each strength of temozolomide must be dispensed in a separate vial or in its original  container (e.g.  bottle  
or sachet) . Based on the dose prescribed, determine the number of each strength of temozolomide capsules 
needed for the full course as pr escribed by [CONTACT_099]. For example, 275  mg/day for 5  days would be 
dispensed as five 250 mg capsules, five 20 mg capsules, and five 5 mg capsules. Label each container with 
the appropriate number of capsules to be taken each day. Dispense to the patien t/parent, making sure each 
container lists the strength (mg) per capsule and that he or she understands to take the appropriate number 
of capsules of temozolomide from each bottle or vial to equal the total daily dose prescribed by [CONTACT_24201]. Instituti ons that have the capability to dispense temozolomide as daily doses in a blister pack 
may do so, taking specific precautions to ensure that the appropriate dose is provided and that the patient is 
educated to understand the daily dosing regimen.  
 
For chil dren unable to swallow the capsules whole, the oral capsules may be formulated into a suspension. To 
prepare a 10 mg/mL suspension triturate the contents of ten 100 mg capsules (1000 mg), 500  mg povidone

K-30 and 25 mg anhydrous citric acid dissolved in 1. 5 mL purified water in a glass mortar to form a uniform 
paste. To the paste add 50 mL of Ora -Plus® by [CONTACT_1583] a small amount, mixing, and then adding the balance. 
Transfer to a glass graduated cylinder. Add Ora -Sweet® or Ora -Sweet® SF to a total volume of 1 00 mL by 
[CONTACT_439227] (Ora -Sweet® or Ora -Sweet® SF).  Rinse at least four 
times. Package in an amber plastic prescription bottle. The packaged suspension is stable for 7  days at room 
temperature or 60 days in the refri gerator. The suspension should be shaken well before each use. Procedures 
for proper handling and disposal of cytotoxic drugs should be used when preparing the suspension. (Trissel

9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Overview: This is a prospective, randomized Phase II selection design study to identify an agent that is 
sufficiently promis ing to be studied further in a P hase III trial.  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_1000107] a 2 -stage group sequential design (“Activity 
Design”) per Simon. In addition, we will use the same data for a rand omized, prospective, 2 -stage “pi[INVESTIGATOR_732109]” design (“Selection Design”) per Steinberg and Venzon .[ADDRESS_1000108] for a minimum acceptable level of activity.  
 
The primary  objective  of the study  was achieved  when  Regimen B (irinotecan/temozolomide/  
dinutuximab ) met the minimum acceptable level of activi ty required in Stage 1 of the Activity Design in 
order to be deemed worthy of additional study in patients with neuroblastoma. Regimen A 
(irinot ecan/temozolomide/ temsirolimus ) failed to do so, and randomization  was halted. The “randomized  
portion  of the trial” is the portion  prior to Amendment #5 when  patients  were  randomly  assigned  to Regimen 
A vs B. The  “non -randomized  portion  of the trial”  is the portion as  of Amendment  #5, when  all newly  
enrolled  patients  are non-randomly  assigned  to Regimen B . The pri mary objective of the “non -randomized 
portion of the trial” is to determine the response rate of patients with relapsed, refractory or progressive 
neuroblastoma following treatment with irinotecan, temozolomide and dinutuximab and to compare this 
with the known response rate of patients treated with irinotecan and temozolomide alone.  
 
9.1 Sample Size and Study Duration  
Randomized portion of the trial  
Enrollment of up to 37 patients per regimen  (for a total of up to 74 patients) will be required in order to 
generate the 25  eligible, evaluable patients per regimen  (50 total) that will be analyzed. Conservatively high 
estimates of ineligibility were used to arrive at the potential maximum enrollment. The [ADDRESS_1000109] stage for insufficient activity, the study will require fewer patients (as few as 
34, if all patients enrolled are eligible). At an accrual rate of [ADDRESS_1000110] udy 
duration will be 2.5 -4.5 years.  
 
A total of 36 patients, 35 of whom were eligible (1 patient ineligible in Regimen A), were enrolled (18 on 
Regimen A, 17 on Regimen B) during the randomized portion of the trial. In addition, 1 patient on Regimen 
B was not evaluable  for toxicity and feasibility (see S ection 9.2.2 for definition of evaluability). Prior to the 
suspension of randomization, annual accrual was about [ADDRESS_1000111] error of 0.07. This will require 
enrollm ent of up to an additional 40 patients on Regimen B in order to obtain the required 33  more eligible 
patients. Thus, enrollment may proceed up to a total of 76 patients, which includes the 36  patients that 
enrolled during the randomized portion of the stud y. 
 
The accrual rate of 20 patients per year observed prior to the suspension of randomization is expected to be 
sustained or exceeded. Thus, accrual of the non -randomized patients should be completed within 2  years. 
With the addition of 6 months for treat ment and follow -up, the total study duration will be 2.5 years.  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_1000112] enough responders  to meet the activity design response level, then other 
criteria (toxicity, feasibility, PFS) will be used to subjectively select the winner and answer the primary 
study objective.  Responders are defined patients who achieve a ≥ PR, per the INRC,[ADDRESS_1000113] overall 
response. Patients with PD prior to attaining a ≥ PR will be considered failures for the analysis of response, 
and go off protocol therapy. In addition, patients who meet off protocol therapy criteria due to toxicity prior 
to attaining a ≥ PR will also be considered treatment failures.  For a given patient, this p rimary endpoint is 
binary (responder, non -responder).  
 
If a patient becomes a responder and later has progressive disease or later goes off protocol therapy due to 
toxicity or by [CONTACT_75121], then the patient will be counted as a responder. It is possible that a patient’s response 
to therapy may not occur until after many months of treatment. In order to prevent bias, the maximum 
duration of time/treatment over which a patient’s response is to be assessed for determination of the best 
overall response is after t he completion of the first 6 cycles. This limit of 6 cycles applies to the inclusion 
of response data for the assessment s of the Activity and Selection Designs  as well as the non-randomized 
portion of the trial  for the primary objective.  
 
9.2.2  Exploratory  Endpoints  
• Progression -free survival: For PFS, an event is defined as a relapse, progressive disease, or death 
attributable to tumor or treatment. Time to event for PFS will be calculated from the time of 
enrollment on the study until the occurrence of the  first event or until the time of last contact [CONTACT_732176]. Analysis of overall survival (event = death) will also be performed.  
• Toxicity: The toxicity endpoint will be defined as the occurrence of unacceptable toxicit y per the 
CTCAE v4.0 toxi city grading scale as defined below.  
• Feasibility: Feasibility will be defined as the ability to maintain intended treatment with all agents 
(irinotecan, temozolomide and the experimental agent) without a dose reduction or going off 
protocol therapy for to xicity.  
• Response rates : a) using current INRC and b) using recently proposed  revised INRC.  In recent 
years, major pediatric cooperative groups from around the world have made considerable efforts to 
develop standard approaches to neuroblastoma risk stratif ication and disease evaluation. There is 
an ongoing international collaboration to redefine standardized response criteria for neuroblastoma 
with the ultimate goal to improve our ability to compare response evaluations across clinical trials. 
While the res ponse rate endpoint for the conduct of this study will be evaluated using traditional 
INRC criteria, response based upon the newly revised INRC will be calculated from the multiple 
imaging response components, and concordance of INRC and revised INRC  respo nse will be 
checked.  
 
Evaluability  
All eligible, randomized and non -randomized patients will be evaluable for inclusion in the analysis of the 
primary objective and response. All analyses of response will be conducted as intent -to-treat.   
 
Any eligible patient who receives at least one dose of temsirolimus or ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  on study will 
be considered evaluable for toxicity and feasibility.

be closely monitored for toxicity. If the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_732110], we will move on 
to the efficacy phase (assessment of response using activity and selection rules), including the first 
12 patients from the safety phase.  Accrual to the study will be halted at the following times in order to 
gather data for assessment of the monitoring rules before continuing accrual on the next stage:  
- Rule A, at the end of Stage 1 (the “safety phase”) and Stage 2;  
- Rule B, at the end of Stage 1;  
- Activity design, at the end of Stage 1; and,  
- Selection design, at the end of Stage 1.  
 
Analysis of response will be intent -to-treat of eligible, randomized patients. The primary study objective 
and interim moni toring will be accomplished using [ADDRESS_1000115] 2-stage designs:  
• A design within each treatment regimen . Each of these will determine that a given regimen  
meets the minimum level of activity. These designs will be referred to as the “activity” 
designs.  
• A second design that compares the 2 treatment regimen s. This design will be referred to as 
the “selection” design.  
 
9.3.1  Randomization/Strata  
Patients will be randomized 1:1 to Regimen -A (irinotecan/temozolomide/temsirolimus) or Regimen -B 
(irinotecan/temozol omide/ch14.18 , dinutuximab ), stratified by [CONTACT_732177]89 (Strata 1 -12).

Stage 1 – Accrue [ADDRESS_1000119] one unacceptable 
toxicity, then the treatment regimen  will be tem porarily closed to new accrual to allow for DSMC review 
and reassessment of drug doses. If < [ADDRESS_1000120] an unacceptable toxicity, then continue to Stage 2.  
 
Stage 2 – Accrue [ADDRESS_1000121] one unacceptable toxicity, then the DSMC and study committee will review the treatment for 
reassessment of drug doses. If < [ADDRESS_1000122] an unacceptable toxicity, then continue to Stage 3.  
 
Stage 3 – Accrue [ADDRESS_1000123] one unacceptable toxicity, then the treatment regimen  will be considered not sufficiently safe . If 
< [ADDRESS_1000124] an unacceptable toxicity, then the treatment regimen  will be considered sufficiently 
tolerable for further study.  
 
This rule has the follow ing operating characteristics: The null hypothesis is that the toxicity rate is more 
than 32% and the alternative hypothesis is that the t oxicity rate is less than 10%. This rule  has >  90% power 
and alpha  < 0.10. Under the null hypothesis, the expected sample size is 15.0, the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_732113] 0.294, and the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_732114] 0.847.  
 
Non-randomized portion of the tria l 
There may be cause to stop the trial early if the unacceptable toxicity (as defined in Section 9.3.3 ) rate on 
Regimen B appears too high. The presence or absence of an unacceptable toxicity will be determined for  
each evaluable  patient during the first [ADDRESS_1000125] an unacceptable toxicity , then Regimen  B will be considered 
sufficient ly tolerable for further study.   
 
For this single -stage  rule, with N=50 evaluable  patients,  there  is a 0.90 probability  of concluding  the 
toxicity  rate is unacceptable  when  the true rate is 23.8% and there  is a 0.10 probability  of concluding  the 
toxicity  rate is unacceptable  when  the true rate is 10% (i.e., uses a null hypothesis  toxicity  rate of 10%,  
23.8% under  the alternative,  and has 90% power  with a Type  I error  rate of 10%).   
 
Rule B – Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_732115]. This ru le will be applied independently within each treatment regimen .  
 
Stage 1 – Accrue [ADDRESS_1000126] one dose  
modification  (including patients who are taken off protocol therapy due to toxicity) , then the  DSMC and 
the study committee will review the  treatment regimen  for reassessment of drug doses. If <  [ADDRESS_1000127] 
a dose modification, then continue to Stage 2.  
 
Stage 2 – Accrue [ADDRESS_1000128] one dose modification  or are taken off protocol therapy due to toxicity , then the treatment regimen  
will be considered not sufficiently safe . If < [ADDRESS_1000129] a dose modification , then the treatment 
regimen  will be c onsidered sufficiently feasible for further study.  
 
This rule has the following operating characteristics: The null hypothesis is that the dose modification rate 
is more than 60% and the alternative hypothesis is that the dose modif ication rate is less tha n 32%. This 
rule has >  90% power and alpha  < 0.07. Under the null hypothesis, the expected sample size is 18.59, and 
the probability of early termination is 0.801.  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_1000130] 2 cycles of therapy. During the randomized 
portion of the trial, 3 patients on Regimen B had dose modifications >25% due to toxicity durin g the first 
[ADDRESS_1000131] a modification of irinotecan, temozolomide  or dinutuximab dose 
of >25% due to toxicity during the first [ADDRESS_1000132] such dose modifications for toxicity,  then Regimen  B will be considered sufficient ly feasible 
for further study.  Dose modifications related to formulation issues or patient/family preference will not be 
counted during application of this rule.  
 
For this s ingle -stage rule, with N= 50 evaluable  patients, there is a 0.90 probability of concluding the dose 
modification  rate due to toxicity is unacceptable when the true rate is 50.1% and there is a 0.10 probability 
of concluding the dose modification rate due to  toxicity rate is unacceptable when the true rate is 32% (i.e., 
uses a null hypothesis toxicity rate of 32%, 50.1% under the alternative, and has 90% power with a Type I 
error rate of 10%).  
 
Rule C: Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_732116] a) a toxic death occurs; or, b) a patient requires intubation or ventilator support  for 
> 24 hours , the treatment regimen  will be temporarily closed to new accrual to allow for DSMC review and 
reassessment of drug doses.  
 
9.3.4  Efficacy Phase  
For design descriptive purposes, designate the 2 agents being tested as X and Y.  
 
Activity design  
Within each regimen , the activity design will be used to determine if elimination of a regimen  is necessary 
due to a given regimen  not meeting the minim um level of activity.  
 
Stage 1 of the activity design: Accrue 17 patients to each agent. Evaluate the following with each treatment 
regimen : If an agent has 3 or fewer responders, then there is insufficient evidence of activity of that agent. 
If an agent has 4 or more responders, then the trial may continue to Stage 2 for that agent.  
 
Stage 2 of the activity design: Accrue 8 additional patients to the agent for a total of 25. If the agent has 6 
or fewer responders, then there is insufficient evidence of ac tivity of that agent. If the agent has 7 or more 
responders, then it is reasonable to conclude that the agent is worthy of consideration in the Selection 
Design.   
 
This optimal two -stage design has 91.1% power to detect a 25% difference (15% under the nul l and 40% 
under the alternative hypothes is) and Type I error of 0.064. Furthermore, of interest is the probability that 
both regimen s will be eliminated by [CONTACT_732179]; when the activity rate for both 
regimen s is .15 , this proba bility is equal to .88= (1 -.064)(1 -.064). The probability of both regimen s meeting 
the activity criteria at the end of the study , when the true rate in both regimen s is .4 , is .83  = (.911*.911) .   
 
Selection design  
The selection design is relevant only in the case where both agents have met the minimum level of activity 
at Stage [ADDRESS_1000133] 
one agent has met the minimum level of activity at S tage 2 of the activity desi gn. In other words, the 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/2017   Page 65 
selection design will not be applied at all if one or both agents are eliminated at S tage 1 of the activity 
design; S tage 2 of the selection design will not be applied if both agents are eliminated by [CONTACT_37325] 2 of the 
activity design.  
 
Stage 1 of the selection design: Using the first 17 patients accrued to each agent,  
a) Eliminate an inferior agent according to comparison of agents.  
i. Let agent Y be the agent with the most responders at Stage 1. If agent Y has [ADDRESS_1000134] determine d if Y meets the minimum activity level in the activity 
design.   
ii. However, if neither agent has 3 or more responders than the other, then both regimen s 
may continue to Stage 2.  
 
If an agent has not been eliminated at Stage 1, accr ual will continue to Stage 2.  
 
Stage 2 of the selection design:  
a) If neither X or Y was eliminated: Accrue [ADDRESS_1000135] case, more or 
less equivalent to, X.   
ii. However, if neither agent has 3 or more responders than the other, (and both agent s have 
enough responders to meet the activity design response level), then other criteria will be 
used to subjectively select the winner. The specifics of these criteria are listed in Section 
9.4. 
b) If one agent was elimi nated at Stage 1: Accrue [ADDRESS_1000136] udy objective : 
1. Toxic death;

Version Date: 05/18/2017   Page 66 
2. Unacceptable toxicity rate ( see definition in Section 9.3.3 ); 
3. PFS;  
4. Feasibility (dose modifications, off protocol therapy due to toxicity , concomitant medication 
usage ), and  
5. Number of days hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]  (overnight stays) ; number  of overnight stays  in the pediatric intensive 
care unit  
 
In addition, we will perform a descriptive analysis of the response of pa tients who received more than 
6 cycles of therapy.  
 
To address primary objective 1.1.2, the response rate to treatment with i rinotecan, temozolomide and 
dinutuximab will be calculated among the 50 eligible  patients accrued, including placement of a 95% 
confidence interval on the  response  rate. If the lower bound of the confidence interval is above the objective 
response rate of 15% observed on  ANBL0421, then the addition of dinutuximab will be considered to 
improve response over treatment with irinotecan and temozolomide alone.  
 
To address exploratory  objective 1.2.1, a Fisher’s exact test will be used to test for a difference in  the 
proportion of patients who are responders, f or temsirolimus versus ch14.18  (dinutuximab) . This proportion 
(RR) will be calculated for each treatment group as the number of responders divided by [CONTACT_732180].  
 
To address exploratory  objective 1.2.2, Kaplan -Meier curves of PFS and OS will be generated by [CONTACT_6490], and the curves will be compared using a log -rank test. The following factors have been shown to be 
prognostic of OS post -relapse in neuroblastoma patients: age at diagnosis, INSS stage, MYCN  status, time 
from diagnosis to first relapse,89 and prior treatment . To further characterize the outcome of patients on this 
study’s treatments, and describe the treatment effect  in context of known prognostic factors and prior 
treatment, Kaplan -Meier curves of PFS and OS will be generated for these factors, and log -rank tests 
performed.  
 
To address exploratory  objective 1.2.3, Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10020] A will be applied. In addition, a Fishe r’s exact test 
will be used to t est for a difference in the proportion of patients who experience unacceptable toxicity, fo r 
temsirolimus versus ch14.18  (dinutuximab) . This proportion will be calculated for each treatment group as 
the number of patients wh o experience unacceptable toxicity divided by [CONTACT_732181]. Also , the toxicities (Grade ≥  3) for each treatment group will be descriptively summarized.  
 
To address exploratory  objective 1.2.4, Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10020] B will be  applied. In addition, a Fisher’s exact test 
will be used to test for a difference in the proportion of patients who required a dose modification, for 
temsirolimus versus  ch14.18  (dinutuximab) . This proportion will be calculated for each treatment group as  
the number of patients who required a dose modification divided by [CONTACT_732182]. Also , the dose modifications for each treatment group will be descriptively summarized.  
 
To address exploratory  objective 1.2.5, for e ach patient the overall response  (CR, PR,  SD, PD) will be 
determined per INRC an d per the  revised INRC. The relative degree of concordance will be presented  using 
a weighted kappa statistic (± standard error), where higher values of kappa indicate greater agreement 
between the 2 systems . These analyses will be repeated within each treatment group.  In addition, the overall 
response rate ( RR) per INRC and per revised INRC will be calculated , and the degree of concordance will 
be tested using a McNemar’s test . 
 
To address exploratory  objective 1.2.6, within the ch14.18  (dinutuximab)  treatment group, the incidence of 
naturally occurring anti -glycan antibodies will be calculated, including the placement of a 95% confidence 
interval on the incidence.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/2017   Page 67 
 
To address exploratory  objective 1.2.7, the incidence of NK receptor NKp30 isoforms will be calculated, 
including the placement of a 95% confidence interval on the incidence.  
 
To address exploratory  objective 1.2. 8, the relationship between response to treatment with irinotecan, 
temozolomide, and dinutuximab (response vs. non -response) and naturally occurring anti -glycan 
antibodies, KIR/KIR -L genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], Fc receptor genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and HACA will be explored with Fisher's exact 
test for categorical and Wilcoxon rank -sum tes t for continuous host factors. Both the presence/absence and 
level of naturally occurring anti -glycan antibodies will be considered. For the KIR/KIR -L analysis, patients 
will be categorized as either matched or mismatched. Patients will be grouped into one  of the three genotype 
subgroups of Fc receptor genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_732117]. The presence/absence of HACA, anti -idiotype and 
PATA/anti -allotype antibody will be considered for the HACA analysis . 
 
To address exploratory  objective 1.2. 9, the incidence of NK  receptor NKp30 isoforms , immune checkpoint 
proteins ( CD274 (PDL1) and CD276 (B7H3) ) expression, and expression of GD2  will be calculated, 
including placement of a 95% confidence interval on each incidence  rate. Summary statistics will also be 
generated fo r serum cytokine ( IL1, IL6, TNF -alpha, IFN -gamma , etc.) and infiltrating TIL (including 
TAMs) levels.  
 
 
To address exploratory  objective 1.2. 10, the relationship between response to treatment with irinotecan, 
temozolomide, and dinutuximab (response vs. non -response) and NK receptor NKp30 isoforms , immune 
checkpoint proteins ( CD274 (PDL1) and CD276 (B7H3) ) expression, expression of GD2, serum cytokine 
levels ( IL1, IL6, TNF -alpha, IFN -gamma , etc.), and infiltrating TILs (including TAMs) levels  will be 
explore d with Fisher's exact test for categorical and Wilcoxon rank -sum test for continuous tumor immune -
microenvironment factors. Patients will be categorized as either present/absent for NK receptor NKp30 
isoforms , immune checkpoint proteins expression, and exp ression of GD2  for these analyse s. The levels of 
serum cytokines and infiltrating TILs will be considered.  
 
To address exploratory objective 1.2.11, the relationship between response to treatment with irinotecan, 
temozolomide, and dinutuximab (response vs.  non-response) and gene expression ( CHGA, DCX, DDC, 
PHOX2B, and TH ) and circulating GD2 levels following therapy will be explored with a Wilcoxon rank -
sum test. Changes from baseline will also be analyzed.

10.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
10.1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  
This study will utilize version 4.0 of the CTCAE of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for toxicity and  
performance repor ting. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the NCI website at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
Additionally, toxicities are to be reported on the appropriate case report forms. Please note: ‘CTC AE v4.0’ 
is understood to represent the most current version of CTCAE v4.0 as referenced on the CTEP website (ie, 
v4.02 and all subsequent iterations prior to version 5.0).  
 
10.[ADDRESS_1000137]/MRI Lesions  
For CT/MRI lesions, response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised Response 
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline ( version 1.1 ).[ADDRESS_1000138] diameter (uni -dimensional measurement) 
of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST v1.1 criteria.  
 
10.2.1  Definition of Measurable (Evaluable) Disease on CT/MRI Scan 
The presence of at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with the longest 
diameter at least 10 mm (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm) . The investigator will identify up 
to [ADDRESS_1000139] diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the disease  
measurement.  
 
10.2.3  End-of-Cycle Response  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/2017   Page 69 
 
a) Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all target and non -target lesions.  
 
b) Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)  
Greater than 90% decrease of the disease measurement for CT/MRI lesions, taking as reference the  
disease measurement done to confirm measurable d isease at study entry. Non -target CT/MRI 
lesions stable to smaller in size.  
 
c) Partial Response (PR)  
At least a 30% decrease in the disease measurement, taking as reference the disease measurement 
done to confirm measurable disease at study enrollment. No  new lesions or progression of any non -
target measurable lesion . 
 
d) Progressive Disease (PD)  
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the disease measurements for measurable lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest disease measurement recorded since the sta rt of treatment, or the appearance 
of one or more new lesions.  
 
e) Stable Disease (SD)  
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as 
reference the smallest disease measurement since the treatment started .  
 
10.2. [ADDRESS_1000140] Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to their “best response” for the purposes of  analysis of treatment 
effect. Best response is determined as described in Section 10. 5. 
 
10.3 Response Criteria for Morphologic Bone Marrow Disease  
Note : patients with bone marrow as the ONLY site of disease are not eligible for this study. Response 
criteria in this section are intended to be used when assessing marrow involvement as a co mponent of 
overall response.  
 
Histologic analysis at the local institution of marrow tumor cell involvement is required for all patients 
pre-therapy (Cycle 1) at the end of Cycles 2, 4, and 6, and then after every 4th cycle thereafter for patients 
with kno wn marrow involvement . Marrow should be evaluated following Cycle 6 for all patients (even if 
no history of marrow disease ). Note: If progressive disease is documented by [CONTACT_732183] , then a repeat BM is not nee ded to confirm PD.  
 
10.3.1  Bone Marrow Involvement   
Bone Marrow response  is determined by H&E staining of bilateral bone marrow biopsies and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026].  
 
Complete Response  
No tumor cells detectable by [CONTACT_6785] [ADDRESS_1000141] 3 weeks apart.  
 
Progressive Disease  
a) Patients who enroll without evidence of neuroblastoma in bone marrow will be defined as having 
progressive disease if tumor is detected in [ADDRESS_1000142] 3 weeks apart.

b) Patients who enroll with neuroblastoma in bone marrow by [CONTACT_732184] a doubling in the amount of tumor in the marrow AND a minimum of 25% tum or in bone 
marrow by [CONTACT_732185]. (For example, a patient entering with 5% tumor in marrow by [CONTACT_732186] ≥ 25% tumor to have progressive disease ; a patient entering with 30% tumor must 
increase to ≥ 60%).  
 
Stable Disease  
Persistence of tumor in bone marrow that does no t meet the criteria for either complete response or 
progressive disease.  
 
10.3. [ADDRESS_1000143] Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to their “best response” for the purposes of  analysis of treatment 
effect. Best response is determin ed as described in Section 10.[ADDRESS_1000144] a positive 123I-MIBG scan at the start of therapy will be evaluable for MIBG response.  
MIBG sca ns will be evaluated by [CONTACT_732187] ( Section 10.4.1 ) and subsequently by a COG 
central review ( Section 10.4.2 ). An Overall Response assessment ( Section 10.5 ) will be determined,  using 
the MIBG grade from the central review.  
 
10.4.1  Critera for  the Treating Institution  
The following criteria will be used to report MIBG response by [CONTACT_732188]:  
Complet e response : Complete resolution of all MIBG positive lesions  
Partial response : Resolution of at least one MIBG positive lesion, with persistence of other MIBG 
positive lesions . 
Stable disease : No change in MIBG scan in number of positive lesions . 
Progressi ve disease : Development of new MIBG positive lesions . 
 
The intensity of MIBG uptake is not to be considered in the above institutional evaluation . 
 
10.4.[ADDRESS_1000145] long term stable disease on protocol 
therapy (see Section 14.2 ). 
 
NOTE : This scoring is NOT required to be done by [CONTACT_732189].  
 
The body is divided into 9 anatomic sectors for osteomedullary lesions, with a 10th general sector  allocated 
for any extra -osseous lesion visible on MIBG scan . In each region, the lesions are scored as follows. The 
absolute  extension score  is graded as:  
0 = no site per segment  
1 = 1 site per segment  
2 = more than one site per segment  
3 = massive involvement (> 50% of the segment).  
 
The absolute score  is obtained by [CONTACT_732190] t he segments. See diagram of sectors below:  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/2017   Page 71 
 
The relative score  is calculated by [CONTACT_732191] -
treatment absolute  score. The relative score of each patient is calculated at each response assessment  
compared to baseline and classified as below:  
1) Complete response:  all areas of uptake on MIBG scan completely resolved.  
2) Partial response:  Relative score ≤ 0.2 (lesions almost disappeared) to ≤ 0.5 (lesions strongly 
reduced) . 
3) Stable disease:  Relati ve score > 0.5 (lesions weakly but significantly reduced) to 1.0 (lesions not 
reduced).  
4) Progressive disease:  New lesions on MIBG scan.  
 
10.4.[ADDRESS_1000146] Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to their “best response” for the pu rposes of  analysis of treatment 
effect. Best response is determined as described in Section 10.5 . 
 
10.5 Definition of Overall Response for Each Patient  
The International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC) will b e used to define overall response for this 
study. The response criteria integrate response at all sites defined as measurable in this study, including 
CT/MRI lesions which meet RECIST criteria, MIBG positive lesions, and bone marrow disease. These 
criteria  will be used to define the overall response for the patient in all strata in the statistical analysis. The 
treating Institution should grade overall response using the INRC criteria, with MIBG grading as listed in 
Section 10.4. 1. NOTE: The central review of MIBG scans will be used for the formal statistical evaluation 
of overall response.  
 
10.5.1  Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all target lesions. No evidence of tumor at any site (chest, abdomen, liver, bone, bone 
marro w, nodes, etc.).  
 
10.5.2  Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)  
Greater than 90% decrease of the disease measurement for CT/MRI target lesions, taking as reference the 
disease measurement done to confirm measurable disease in target lesions at study entry; all pre-existing

bone lesions with CR by [CONTACT_422955]; MIBG scan can be SD or CR in soft tissue lesions corresponding to lesions 
on CT/MRI. CR in bone marrow (by [CONTACT_732192]). No new sites of tumor.  
 
10.5.3  Partial Response (PR)  
At least a 30% decrease in the  disease measurement for CT/MRI target lesions, taking as reference the 
disease measurement done to confirm measurable disease in target lesions at study entry. Bone marrow 
with CR (by [CONTACT_732193] 10.3 ). MIBG with either PR/CR in bone lesions; 
MIBG may be SD or CR in soft tissue lesions corresponding to lesions on CT/MRI. HVA/VMA may still 
be elevated.  
 
10.5.4  Progressive Disease (PD)  
Any one of the following:  
a) At least a 20% increas e in the disease measurement for CT/MRI target lesions, taking as reference 
the smallest disease measurement recorded since the start of treatment.  
b) Appearance of one or more new lesions or new sites of tumor.  
c) PD as defined above for either bone marro w or MIBG lesions.  
 
10.5.5  Stable disease (SD)  
The patient will be classified as stable disease for overall response if there is stable disease by [CONTACT_625423]/MRI lesion, bone marrow, or MIBG criteria. No new lesions; no new sites of disease.  
 
The overall r esponse as assessed at any particular time point based on the various disease sites is 
summarized in the table below.

Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_1000148], MRI  or MIBG scanning (or FDG -PET if tumor is not MIBG avid) will have 
scans evaluated centrally by [CONTACT_6744], after completion of therapy. For this study, long term stable disease is 
defined as SD lasting 6 cycles or greater  (minimum 4 months). See Section 14.2  for central review imaging 
guidelines and submission requirements.  
 
 
11.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
11.1 Purpose  
Adverse event (AE) data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clin ical trial, are done 
to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using 
similar agents. Certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for timelier 
monitoring of patien t safety and care. The following sections provide information about expedited 
reporting.  
 
11.2 Determination of Reporting Requirements  
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has received an 
investigational or commercial agent ; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade  
(severity), the relationship to the study therapy  (attribution), and the prior experience  (expectedness) of the 
adverse event; 3) the Phase (1, 2, or 3) of the trial; and 4 ) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_332821].  
 
An investigational agent is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug Application 
(IND). In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, but is actually being 
tested for indications not included in the approved package label.  
 
Commercial agents  are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a commercial 
source. The NCI, rather than a com mercial distributor, may on some occasions distribute commercial agents 
for a trial.  
 
When a study includes both investigational and commercial agents, the following rules apply.  
• Concurrent administration : When an investigational agent is used in combinati on with a 
commercial agent, the combination is considered to be investigational and expedited 
reporting of adverse events would follow the guidelines for investigational agents.  
• Sequential administration : When a study includes an investigational agent and a commercial 
agent on the same study regimen , but the commercial agent is given for a period of time prior 
to starting the investigational agent, expedited reporting of adverse events which occur prior 
to starting the investigational agent would follow the  guidelines for commercial  agents. Once 
therapy with the investigational agent is initiated, all expedited reporting of adverse events 
follow the investigational agent reporting guidelines.  
 
11.3 Expedited Reporting Requirements – Serious Adverse Events (S AEs)  
To ensure compliance with these regulations/this guidance, as IND/IDE sponsor, NCI requires that AEs be 
submitted according to the timeframes in the AE reporting tables assigned to the protocol, using the NCI’s 
CTEP Adeverse Event Reporting System  (CTEP-AERS ). 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_1000149] medical 
occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. A Serious 
Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse drug event (experience) occurring at any dose that results in ANY of 
the following outcomes:  
 
1) Death.  
2) A life -threatening adverse drug experience.  
3) An adverse event resulting in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
(for ≥  24 hours). This does not include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732118].  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Impo rtant Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medic al or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_1000150] administration of the investigational 
agent/intervention and has an attribution of a possible, probable, or definite relationship to the study therapy 
must be reported according to the CTEP -AERS  reporting tables in this protocol.  
 
11.4.2 Persistent or Significant Disabilities/Incapacities  
Any AE that results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions (formerly referred to as disabilities), congenital anomalies or bi rth defects, must be 
reported via CTEP -AERS  if it occurs at any time following treatment with an agent under a NCI IND/IDE 
since these are considered to be serious AEs  
 
11.4.3 Death  
 
Reportable Categories of Death  
 
o Death attributable to a CTCAE term.  
o Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_31948] 28 days of life.  
o Sudden Death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the onset of symptoms) 
or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCA E term associated with 
Grade 5.  
o Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with 
Grade  5.  
o Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Neoplasms benign, 
malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) - Other (Progressive Disease)” under the 
system organ class (SOC) of the same name. Evidence that the death was a manifestation of 
underlying disease ( e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical 
deterioration associa ted with a disease process) should be submitted.  
 
Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_1000151] dose, regardless of attribution to the investigational 
agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours.  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_1000152] dose of the investigational agent/intervention 
requires expedited reporting within 24 hours only if it is possibly, probably, or definitely related to the 
investigational agent/intervention.  
 
11.4.4  Secondary Malignancy  
A secondary mali gnancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy (eg, treatment with 
investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A metastasis of the initial neoplasm is not 
considered a secondary malignancy.  
 
The NCI requires all secon dary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an NCI 
IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS . Three options are available to describe the event:  
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome  
• Treatment related seco ndary malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) must also be reported via the 
routine reporting mechanisms outlined in this protocol.  
 
11.4.5  Pregnancy, Fetal Death, and Death Neonatal  
NOTE : When submitting CTEP -AERS reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonatal loss”, the 
Pregnancy Information Form, available at  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/PregnancyReportForm.pdf , 
needs to be completed and faxed along with any additional medical information to [PHONE_100].  The 
potential risk of exposure of the fetus to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agent(s) should be 
documented in the “Description of Event” section of the CTEP -AERS  report.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy  
Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the fetus to agents which may be 
teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy needs to be reported in an expedited manner via CTEP -AERS  as 
Grade 3 “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other (pregnancy )” under the Pregnancy, 
puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC.  
 
There is a possibility that the sperm of male patients treated on studies involving possible teratogenic agents 
may have been damaged. For this reason, pregnancy in partners  of men on study needs be reported and 
followed in the same manner as a patient pregnancy . 
 
Pregnancy needs to be followed until the outcome is known . If the baby [CONTACT_170727] a birth defect or 
anomaly, then a second CTEP -AERS  report is required.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Fetal Death  
Fetal death, defined in CTCAE as “ A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_260765]; failure of the product of 
conception to show evidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], heartbeat, or definite movement of a voluntary muscle after 
expulsion from the uterus, without possibility of resuscitation ”, needs to be reported expeditiously, as 
Grade 4 “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other (pregnancy loss) ”. Do NOT report a 
fetal death as a Grade 5 event since CTEP -AERS  recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patien t death.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Death Neonatal  
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_732194] 28 days of life ” needs to be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “General disorders and administration 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/2017   Page 76 
- Other ( neonatal loss) ” when the death is the result of a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners 
of men on study . Do NOT report a neonatal death resulting from a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in 
partners of men on study as a Grade 5 event since CTEP -AERS  recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient 
death.  
 
11.5 Reporting Requirements for Specialized AEs  
11.5.1  Baseline AEs  
Although a pertinent positive finding identified on baseline assessment is not an AE, when possible it is to 
be documented as “Course Zero” using CTCAE terminology and grade. An expedited AE report is not 
required if a patient is entered on a protocol with a pre -existing condition (eg, elevated laboratory value, 
diarrhea). The baseline AE must be re -assessed throughout the study and reported i f it fulfills expedited AE 
reporting guidelines.  
 
a. If the pre -existing condition worsens in severity, the investigator must reassess the event to 
determine if an expedited report is required.  
b. If the AE resolves and then recurs, the investigator must r e-assess the event to determine if an 
expedited report is required.  
c. No modification in grading is to be made to account for abnormalities existing at baseline.  
 
11.5.2  Persistent AEs  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution b etween treatment cycles/courses.  
 
ROUTINE reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade becomes more severe in a 
subsequent course. If the grade becomes more severe the AE must be reported again with the new grade.  
EXPEDITED reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade becomes more severe in the 
same or a subsequent course.  
 
11.5.3  Recurrent AEs  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves during a cycle/course of therapy and then reoccurs in a later 
cycle/course.  
ROUTINE reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent cycle/course must be 
reported by [CONTACT_293862].  
EXPEDITED reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent cycle/course does not 
require CTEP -AERS  reporting unles s: 
1) The grade increases OR  
2) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99205].  
 
11.6 Exceptions to Expedited Reporting  
11.6.1  Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER)  
SPEER: Is a subset of AEs within the Comprehensive Adverse Event s and Potential Risks (CAEPR) that 
contains a list of events that are considered expected for CTEP -AERS  reporting purposes. (Formerly 
referred to as the Agent Specific Adverse Event List (ASAEL).)  
 
AEs listed on the SPEER should be reported expeditiously by [CONTACT_682352] -AERS  
ONLY  if they exceed the grade of the event listed in parentheses after the event. If the CAEPR is part of a 
combination IND using multiple investigational agents and has an SAE listed on different SPEERs, use the 
lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is required.  
 
11.6.2  Special Situations as Exceptions to Expedited Reporting  
An expedited report may not be required for a specific protocol where an AE is listed as expected. The 
exception or acceptab le reporting procedures will be specified in the protocol. The protocol specific 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ANBL1221  
Version Date: 05/18/[ADDRESS_1000153] the primary 
responsibility for AE identification, documentation, grading, and assignment of attribution to the 
investigational  agent/intervention. It is the responsibility of the treating physician to supply the medical 
documentation needed to support the expedited AE reports in a timely manner.  
 
Note: All expedited AEs (reported via CTEP -AERS ) must also be reported via routine reporting. Routine 
reporting is accomplished via the Adverse Event (AE) Case Report Form (CRF) within the study database.   
 
11.8 General Instructions for Expedited Reporting via CTEP -AERS   
The descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI Common Termin ology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting and are located on the CTEP website at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm . All appropriate 
treatment areas should h ave access to a copy of the CTCAE.  
 
An expedited AE report for all studies utilizing agents under an NCI IND/IDE must be submitted 
electronically to NCI via CTEP -AERS  at:  
https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers . 
 
In the rare situation where Internet conne ctivity is disrupted, the [ADDRESS_1000154] be entered

• Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as:  
o 24-Hour; [ADDRESS_1000155] be submitted within 
7 calendar days of the investigator learning of the event.  
 
• Any event that re sults in a persistent or significant incapacity/substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an IME, which based upon 
the medical judgment of the investigator may jeopardize the patient  and require intervention to 
prevent a serious AE, must be reported via CTEP -AERS  if the event occurs following 
investigational agent administration.  
 
• Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_1000156] dose, regardless of attribution to an agent/intervention 
under an NCI IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24 hours .  
• Any death occurring greater than [ADDRESS_1000157] dose with an attribution of possible, probable, or 
definite to an agent/intervention under an NCI IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 
24 hours .  
CTEP -AERS  Medical Reporting includes the following requirements as part of the report: 1) whether the 
patient has received at least one dose of an investigational agent on this study; 2) the characteristics of the 
adverse event including the grade  (severity), the relationship to the study therapy  (attribution), and the

12.0 STUDY REPORTING AND MONITORING  
The Case Report Forms and the submission schedule are posted on the COG web site with each protocol under 
“Data Collection/Specimens ”. A submission schedule is included.  
 
12.1 CDUS  
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_470] (CDUS). Cumulative CDUS data will be 
submitted quarterly to CTEP by [CONTACT_10075]. Reports are due January 31, April 30, July [ADDRESS_1000161] the interests of patients and the scientific integrity for all clinical trial research by [CONTACT_2005]’s 
Oncology Group, the COG Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) revi ews reports of interim 
analyses of study toxicity and outcomes prepared by [CONTACT_4305], in conjunction with the study 
chair’s report. The DSMC may recommend the study be modified or terminated based on these analyses.  
 
Toxicity monitoring is al so the responsibility of the study committee and any unexpected frequency of 
serious events on the trial are to be brought to the attention of the DSMC. The study statistician is 
responsible for the monitoring of the interim results and is expected to requ est DSMC review of any 
protocol issues s/he feels require special review. Any COG member may bring specific study concerns to 
the attention of the DSMC.  
 
The DSMC approves major study modifications proposed by [CONTACT_431676] 
(eg, termination, droppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a  regimen  based on toxicity results or other trials reported, increasing target 
sample size, etc.). The DSMC determines whether and to whom outcome results may be released prior to 
the release of study results at the time specifie d in the protocol document.

13.1.3  Sample Processing: Green and Red Top Tubes  
Green Top Tubes:  
Samples in green top tubes should be collected Monday through Thursday and sent at the appropriate 
temperature by [CONTACT_732196] (see below). Do NOT batch the green top samples.  
 
It is particularly important that the baseline blood sample be drawn on a Monday through Thursday and 
the green top tubes shipped immediately. Baseline blood samples should NOT be collected on Fridays, 
Saturdays, Sunday s or national holidays. Subsequent day  green top samples should also be collected 
Monday through Thursday and sent at the appropriate temperature.  
 
Red Top Tubes:  
After the blood in red top tubes has clotted, tubes should be centrifuged at 1,[ADDRESS_1000165] 0.5 mL of the serum into pre -labeled 1.8 mL screw -cap cryotubes. Cap the 
cryovial securely and freeze upright if possible.  Storage in an ultra -cold freezer (≤ -70oC) or in liquid 
nitrogen is ideal; use of a non -cycling -20oC freezer is acceptable but should be avoided if possible. 
The serum should be shipped overnight (frozen) on the following Monday or the next day that woul d 
permit delivery on a working day. Batching of serum samples is acceptable.  
 
13.1.4  Sample Labeling and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Green and Red Top Tubes

Remaining components of blood samples will be stored at the Biopathology Center for additional testing if 
necessary. If additional testing is not required, the sample will be banked for future research.  
 
13.1.6  Sample Processing: PAX Gene Tubes  
1) For samples collected in PAXgene tubes b lood is placed immediately into the tube, which is then 
inverted 8 - 10 times to mix. Blood should be stored upright in a wire rack and placed in -20°C 
freezer until shipment. Do not  freeze tubes upright in a styrofoam tray as this may cause the tubes 
to crack. Please note that if tubes are to be kept at temperatures below -20°C, they must first be 
stored at -20°C for 24 hours before being transferred into a -70°C or -80°C freezer. PA X Gene 
blood is stored frozen and it must be shipped on dry ice.  
 
2) PAX gene tubes should be  batched for each cycle and shipped prior to the next cycle. Please ship 
on dry ice overnight on a day that would permit delivery on a working day.  
 
Note: If the PAX gene tube is the only tube to be drawn, blood should be drawn into a “Discard 
Tube” prior to drawing blood into the PAXgene tube.   Otherwise the PAXgene tube should be the 
last tube drawn.

APPENDIX I V:  RECOM MENDATIONS FOR ADMINISTRATION OF TEMO ZOLOMIDE  
(Patients who are unable to swallow capsules and cannot obtain a suspension)  
 
Temozolomide is an oral cancer medicine that your child will be taking for treatment of his/her cancer. If 
your child is unable to swallow capsules, the following instructions must be followed for safe administration 
of this medicine.  
 
• Temozolomide must be kept in a dark container.  
• Temozolomide should be taken the same time every day.  
• If your child requires nausea medicine it should b e taken prior to the temozolomide.  
• If the dose of temozolomide is vomited (which is unusual) within the first 20 minutes after it is taken , 
the dose should be repeated. If your child vomits more than 20 minutes after the temozolomide has 
been taken, do not  repeat the dose.  
• If the person dispensing this medicine is pregnant, breastfeeding or suspects she is pregnant, she should 
not dispense this medicine.  
 
Since temozolomide is an anti -cancer agent, special precautions must be take n when handling this medici ne. 
There is potential hazard to anyone who handles this medicine once the  protective capsule is opened. Since 
your child is unable to swallow the capsule you will be required to open the capsules and mix the contents 
of the capsule in apple sauce or apple  juice. This process must be done according to the following guidelines 
to ensure safe administration of this medicine.  
 
• Find a place that is free from drafts or wind and is not an area where food is stored or prepared.  
• The work surface should be covered w ith an impermeable and disposable mat such as the one a 
pharmacy uses to reduce exposure to other members of the family.  
• Temozolomide can be mixed in apple sauce or apple juice.  
• Place the apple sauce or apple juice in a disposable container.  
• Put on gloves,  a mask and a pair of goggles (eye protection).  
• Open each capsule required for the daily dose and place the powder in a medicine cup.  
• Add the whole contents of the medicine cup to eith er apple sauce or apple juice. The medicine will not 
dissolve completely  if mixing in apple juice so have extra apple juice on hand so you can add it to any 
remaining powder in the bottom of the cup.  
• If you need to have additional juice or apple sauce remove your gloves before touching the main 
container then place new gloves on before adding the additional juice or apple sauce to the medicine. 
(You do not want to contaminate the main container with any powder that may be on your gloves .) 
• Anything that comes into contact [CONTACT_386284], such as the spoon u sed for 
mixing or eating the apple sauce.  
• Once all of the medicine is taken, throw away the following in a Ziploc -type plastic bag: Medicine cup, 
the container the medicine was mixed in, the covers/mats for the work surface, masks, gloves and 
anything else  that has been in contact [CONTACT_386285].  
• Once a course of medicine is completed bring the plastic bag with you to the clinic so it can be disposed 
of properly.

APPENDIX V:  PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR TREATING DIARRHEA  
Treatment of Diarrhea  
 
Early dia rrhea  
Early onset diarrhea associated with irinotecan is usually preceded by [CONTACT_99254][INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
Patients who have the onset of these symptoms followed by [CONTACT_732206].  The treating physician may consider treatment 
with atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. If symptoms do not improve with administration of atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], treatment for late diarrhea (as 
outlined below) should be started.  
 
Late diarrhea (more than [ADDRESS_1000183] dose of irinotecan)  
Each family will be instructed to have antidiarrheal medication available and begin treatment at the first 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_732130]. Patients will also be instructed to contact [CONTACT_99256]. Patients will be given Loperamide based on body weight. The doses and schedules for loperamide 
included here are higher than the standard but c onsistent with COG protocols D9802, P9761, and 
ARST0121.  
 
Be aware of your child's bowel movements. At the first sign they become softer than usual or if your child 
has any increase in the number of bowel movements over what is normal for him/her, begin ta king 
loperamide (Imodium). If he/she does not start taking the loperamide right away, the diarrhea may 
become severe and last several days or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
Please follow these directions carefully, using dosing guidelines below:  
• Take __________ ___ at the first sign of diarrhea.  
• Continue taking  ____   every 2 hours until your normal pattern of bowel movements returns. 
Repeat the same doses and frequency if the diarrhea returns.  
• Do not exceed ___________ in a 24 hour period.  
• Please call your doctor if y ou have any questions about taking loperamide, if your child's 
diarrhea is not under control after two days, or if he/she is feeling extremely weak, 
lightheaded, or dizzy.  
• Make an extra effort to give your child lots of fluids (several glasses of pedialyte , fruit 
juices, soda, soup, etc.) while your child is participating in this study.  
• Side effects may include tiredness, drowsiness or dizziness. If your child experiences these 
side effects, or if your child is urinating less frequently than usual, please c ontact your 
child's physician.  
• Do not give your child any laxatives without consulting with his/her physician.

APPENDIX V II:  RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE FOR PERFORMING MIBG SCANS  
MIBG (meta -iodobenzylguanidine) was developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Donald Wieland of the Un iversity of Michigan in 
the late 1970’s for scintigraphic imaging of neuroendocrine tumors, specifically pheochr omocytomas and 
neuroblastomas. MIBG is an aralkylguanidine which bears structural similarity to the neurotransmitter and 
catecholamine hormone n orepi[INVESTIGATOR_732131]. When MIBG is labeled 
with radioactive iodine, gamma camera imaging of patients injected with this compound produces images of 
the sites of the tumors and of the related structures of the sympathe tic nervous system. The I -123 labeled form 
of this agent has been approved for use by [CONTACT_732207], and this agent is commercially available as Adreview (GE). MIBG 
has considerably assisted the diagnostic evaluation of patients with known or suspected neuroblastoma, since 
it provides information about the tumor behavior all along the course of the disease from diagn osis to 
completion of therapy. Scores of publications fr om around the world have documented its utility in the 
diagnosis an d monitoring of neuroblastoma. It alone is the single best imaging test for monitoring disease 
activity. MIBG imaging is performed routinely at many institutions. The following protocol is recommended, 
to assure high quality images are obtained at all institutions which participate in neuroblastoma evaluations .92  
 
Patient preparation: Iodides, usually SSKI (saturated solution of potassium iodide), are administered to 
reduce thyroidal accumulation of free radioiodine, preferably beginning the day prior  to injection and 
continuing for 3  additional days (4 days total). For infants and children, one drop t.i.d. is sufficient, for 
adolescents 2 drops t.i.d., and for adults 3 drops t.i.d. Patients and/or parents are always asked about 
exposure to potential i nterfering agents. If none is noted, an indwelling intravenous line is established. The 
dose of MIBG is administered by [CONTACT_67481] 90 seconds.  
 
Images from the head to the distal lower extremities should be obtained.  
 
A. I-123MIBG  scintigraphy is performed to obtain both planar and tomographic images.  
1. Planar – Anterior and posterior views from the top of the head to the proximal lower extremities 
are obtained for 10 minutes at 24 hours and occasionally at 48 hours following injection of  10 
mCi/1.7 square meters of body surface area (~150  Ci/kg, maximum 10  mCi). Anterior views 
of the distal l ower extremities are adequate. A large field of view dual head gamma camera 
with low energy collimators is preferred.  
2. SPECT - Most patients receivin g I-[ADDRESS_1000184]/CT may be 
performed at institutions with this capacity.  
 
Please refer to Section 14.0  for requirements of central review (including the time -points an d address to 
submit the required reports).

APPENDIX VI II  YOUTH INFORMATION SHEETS  
 
INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY ANBL1221  
(for children from 7 through 12 years of age)  
 
A trial to compare [ADDRESS_1000185] been talking with you about your illness, neuroblastoma (NBL). NBL is a kind of cancer 
that grows in the soft issue in your body. It can grow in different parts of the body. After doing 
tests, we have found that you have this type of cancer. You have had treatment for this cancer 
already but the cancer did not go away or has come back after treatment.  
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because you have NBL that is not responding  
to treatment or has come back after treatment. A research study is when doctors work together to 
try out new ways to help people who are sick .  
 
3. All children who are part of this study will be treated with chemotherapy using  the drug 
“ch14.18”  (also calle d dinutuximab) . Chemotherapy is a type of medicine that destroys cancer 
cells.  Study doctors would like to learn if your cancer responds to treatment with ch14.18.  
 
4. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good 
things are called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is a better 
chance of getting rid of the cancer for as long as possible. But we do not know for sure if there is 
any benefit of being part of this study.  
 
5. Sometimes bad t hings can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad things 
are called “risks.” The risks to you from this study are that the study treatment may not work as 
well as other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Also, the study treatment may cause more side effects than other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Your doctors will watch you for signs of any side effects.  
 
6. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being 
in this study at any time once you start. There may be other treatments for your illness that your 
doctor can tell you about. Make sure to ask your doctors any questions that you have.  
 
7. We want to learn more about how people respond to treatment with  ch14.18. We are asking your 
permission to collect extra blood and use the blood f or research studies. We would take extra 
when we collect blood for regular tests. You can still take part in this study even if you do not 
agree to let us collect the extra sample s for research.

INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY ANBL1221  
(for teens from 13 through 17 years of age)  
 
A trial to compare [ADDRESS_1000186] been talking with you about your illness, neuroblastoma (NBL). NBL is a type of canc er 
that grows in the soft issue in your body. It can grow in different parts of the body. After doing 
tests, we have found that you have this type of cancer.  
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because you have NBL that is recurrent or 
refractory. Recurrent means that the cancer has come back after treatment. Refractory means that 
the cancer has not responded to treatment. A research study is when doctors work together to try 
out new ways to help people who are sick.  
 
3. Children and teens wh o are part of this study will be treated with chemotherapy using the drug 
ch14.18  (also called dinutuximab) . Chemotherapy is a type of medicine that destroys cancer cells.

chance of getting rid of your cancer for as long as possible. But  we don’t know for sure if there is 
any benefit of being part of this study.  
 
5. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad things 
are called “risks.” The risks to you from this study are that the study treatment ma y be less 
effective than other therapy options. It is also possible that the study treatment may cause more 
side effects than other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Your doctors will monitor you closely for signs of any side 
effects. Other things may happen to you that we don’t  yet know about.

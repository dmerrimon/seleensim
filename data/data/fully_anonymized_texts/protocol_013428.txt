CONFIDENTIAL   Page 10 of 82 6. Visit 6/Week 12 , Day 85  (± 4 Days)/  End of Study  or Early 
Termination . 
Patient s will be admitted into the  study  after written informed consent has 
been obtained , and  all inclusion/exclusion criteria have been met, including 
a clinical diagnosis of acne vulgaris . Patient s with severe acne vulgaris  who 
are appropriate for systemic treatment need to be counseled regarding their 
treatment options by [CONTACT_264671]. 
Prior to any treatment related assessment s, questionnaires are to be 
completed by [CONTACT_16983] , starting  the age of 9 years old : 
1. Patient  reported outcomes (PRO) will be assessed with the Patient -
Reported Evaluation of Facial Acne (PRE -FACE)  and the Patient  
Global Impression of Symptom Severity  (PGI -S) at : Screening, 
Baseline, Weeks 2, 4 , 8, and 12 / Early Termination . The Patient 
Global Impression of Change (PGI -C), Patient Global Impression of 
treatment Side Effects (PGI -SE), and Patient Global Impression of 
Treatment Satisfaction (PGI -TS) will be assessed at: Weeks 2, 4, 8, 
and 12 / End of Study o r Early Termination .  
2. Acne Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaire at Baseline  and week 12/ 
End of Study o r Early Termination  
At each visit, a 5-point scale Investigator  Global Assessment (IGA) ranging 
from 0 (Clear) to 4  (Sever e) of acne  assessment and facial lesion counts 
(inflammatory  and no n-inflammator y) will be performed.  Investigator s will 
be provided with instructions for IGA assessments and lesion counts to 
ensure consistency  of procedure s.  
Safety will be assessed at all visits and will include monito ring of adverse 
experiences;  the Investigator  Cutaneous Safe ty Assessm ent rating of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], er ythem a, dryness  and scaling on a scale ranging from 0 
(None) to 3 (Severe); and the Patient  assessment of Local Tolerability  rating 
itching  burning  and stinging on a scale ranging from 0 (None) to 3 (Severe). 
Urine pregnancy tests will be performed for all females  of child -bearing 
potential  and premenarchal  females , at every visit:  Screening , Baseline , 
Weeks 2, 4, 8  and 12/ End of Study o r Early Termination .  
Standardized optional photography of the face at Baseline and all study visits 
will be performed at select sites.  
Regardless of the duration  of the study , all p atient s that exhibit  serious  
adverse event ( SAE), will be followed up until the SAE stabilizes or resolves, 
based on Investigator ’s medical judgment.  
Clinical Trial 
Duration : Planned enrollment duration: about 9 months  
The maximal duration for each participating patient  is up to 119 days as 
follows:  
Protocol version 2.0,  01Nov2018 , SGT -65-05  
   
   
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 11 of 82 Screening  Period : up to 35 days prior to baseline (Screening evaluations 
should be repeated if Baseline is >35 days after screening)  
Treatment  Period : 12 weeks/ 84 days  
In addition, patient s that experience an adverse event (AE) will be followed 
up until the AE stabilizes o r resolves, based on the Investigator ’s medical 
judgment.  
Study 
Product s: Encapsulated Benzoyl Peroxide 3%/Encapsulated All -Trans -Retinoic Acids 
0.1%  Cream or Vehicle Cream will be dispensed every 4 weeks (Baseline, 
Week 4 and Week 8) to Patient s and used daily during the study . 
The study p roduct and vehicle will be supplied in 52-gram  pumps .

Safety : 
 
 The incidence of all AEs reported during the study will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_1570]. Safety of the study product with will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_264673], severity and frequency o f their AE profiles. Safety  
variables include Investigator  Cutaneous Safety  Assessment score, 
treatment -emergent AEs  (TEAEs) , SAEs, treatment related AEs, AEs 
leading  to study discontinuation, concomitant medications . 
Statistical 
Method :  General Statistical Methods  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later 
unless otherwise stated. Statistical significance will be based on two -tailed 
tests of the null hypothesis resulting in p -values of 0.05 or less.  
Analy sis Populations  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all randomized Patient s 
who were dispensed study product. The safety population will be comprised 
of all randomized Patient s who are presumed to have used the study product 
at least once and who provide at least one post -baseline safety evaluation. 
Patient s will be considered per protocol (PP) if they complete the 12 -week 
evaluation without noteworthy study protocol violations (i.e., any Patient  or 
Investigator  activity that could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic 
administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment 
efficacy).  
Patient s that discontinue from the study due to an AE related to study product  
or documented lack of treatment effect will be included in the PP population . 
Data for these Patient s will not be imputed by [CONTACT_264674].  Prior to breaking the blind, other additional criteria may be added to 
the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that occurred during the 
conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations.  
Evaluations and Analyses  
The co-primar y efficac y analyses will be to compare  Product S6G5T -3 with 
vehicle  for (1) success  rate at Week  12 (defined  as ‘clear’  or ‘almost  clear ’ 
[at least a 2-grade  improvement  in the IGA]) and (2) absolute  change  from  
baseline  in lesion  counts  at Week 12 based  on the intent -to-treat [ITT] 
population (separately  for inflammatory  and non -inflammator y lesions).  
Statistical Hypothesis Testing   
Tests of superiority for the absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory 
lesions  or non -inflammatory  will be based on either parametric or non -
Protocol version 2.0,  01Nov2018 , SGT -65-[ADDRESS_321645] will 
be included in the model; otherwise it will be removed.  
Following imputation of missing values, a  skewness test, based on the 
methods presented by J.H. Zar (1984), will be applied to the residuals 
resulting from an ANCOVA. A two -sided p -value for the skewness test 
significant at 0.01 will imply the use of the non -parametric method. If a 
parametric analysis is indicated, the results of the parametric analysis will be 
considered the primary analysis. Should a non -parametric analysis be 
indicated, the absolute or percent changes in inflammatory lesions will be 
rank transformed prior to submitting them to the ANCOVA. Results of the 
rank-transformed analyses then will be considered the primary analysis; 
however, results of the non -ranked transformed analyses will also be 
presented  
The IGA will be dichotomized into “success” and “failure” with a Patient  
considered a success for those visits if the IGA is at least 2 grades less than 
Baseline and “Clear” or “Almost Clear”. The analysis of the dichotomized 
IGA will be based on a logistic regression test with factors of treatment group 
and analysis center.  
Missing Efficacy Data Imputations  
Missing Week 12 data will be estimated by [CONTACT_264675]. Missing lesion count data will be derived for the 
analysis using the method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple 
imputation . Imputation will be conducted independently for each treatment 
group.  
Sensitivity Efficacy Analyses  
Sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy endpoints will use [ADDRESS_321646] method will use a repeated measures ANCOVA, with treatment, 
analysis cent er, and visit (i.e., Week 2, Week 4 and Week 8) as independent 
factors and a covariate of baseline. In this analysis, data from all post -
Baseline visits will be included with no imputation for missing data.  
The second sensitivity analyses will use the model based multiple imputation 
method to impute missing data for the absolute change at Week 12.  
The third sensitivity analysis will involve a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275].

Acne vulgaris is a common condition of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_264617] (hair 
follicles and oil glands). Acne is the most common skin disorder in the [LOCATION_002], 
affecting 4 0-50 million Americans. Acne usually begins in pubert y, but the condition 
is not restricted to a ny age group.  
Approximately 85% of people between the ages of [ADDRESS_321648], and back ( Bhate, 2013 ). Acne is caused by  [CONTACT_264676]:  
1. Production of oil by  [CONTACT_264677].  
2. Blockage of the hair follicles that r elease oil.  
3. Growth of bacteria, called Propi[INVESTIGATOR_76494] , within the hair fo llicles.  
4. Inflammatory/immune response to P. acnes  
The pathop hysiologic features of acne suggest that combination thera py should be 
utilized as early as possible to simultaneously attack the multiple pathogenic factors 
of the condition (Gollnick  2003 ). Antimicrobials have been a mainstay  of acne 
treatment for many years, having multiple mechanisms of action. The most important 
may be the ability  of antibiotics to decrease the number of  P. acnes in and a round the 
follicle. They  have a bacteriostatic effect on P. acnes , which prevents the bacteria from 
producing pro -inflammatory molecules (Leyden  2001 ). 
In clinical practice,  it is common for ph ysicians to prescribe multiple topi[INVESTIGATOR_264618]. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_264619] a day by [CONTACT_33230] .  However, 
many of these compounds are irritating with resultant development of facial er ythema 
and discontinuation of  the products or noncompliance with thera py. Benz oyl peroxide 
(BPO)  and tretinoin (ATRA) are two active ingredients with different 
pharmacological actions that are commonly  used for the treatment of acne.  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_264620]. They  work by [CONTACT_264678] r epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663].  This, results in an inhibition in the 
formation of microcomedones, preventing the formation of mature comedones and 
inflammatory  lesions  (Gollnick 2003 ). Use of retinoids promotes the normal 
desquamation of follicular  epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]. The action of the retinoid may  enhance the 
penetration of other topi[INVESTIGATOR_264621].  
Benzo yl peroxide (BPO) is a commonly  used topi[INVESTIGATOR_264622] e 
available either by [CONTACT_256047] (OTC).  BPO has been found to be 
lethal to P. acnes as well as other bacteria that may  reside on the skin.  So far there 
has been no indication of any  bacteria developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a resistance to BPO.  It has a lso 
been demonstrated that BPO has kerat olytic activity contributing to its efficacy  in 
treating comedonal acne (Tanghetti 2008 ). BPO reduces the cohesiveness of the cells 
of the stratum corneum, thus improving topi[INVESTIGATOR_261113] d elivery  through the epi[INVESTIGATOR_264623].  
Silica microcapsule systems have been developed to overcome ma ny of the limitations 
Protocol version 2.0,  01Nov2018 , SGT -65-05  
   
   
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 21 of 82 (such as degradation and irritation) of standard pharmaceutical formulations involving 
multiple active ingredients. The encapsulation  of active ingredients in silica 
microcapsules serves to protect components in the form ulation from interacting with 
one another and, as a consequence, increases overall formulation stabilit y. Silica is 
chemically  inert, photochemically  and p hysically stable, and safe for topi[INVESTIGATOR_44785].  Sol-
Gel’s silica encapsulated products meet the criteria for categorical exclusion defined 
in 21 CFR 25.31(e), and that to the knowledge of Sol -Gel, no extraordinary 
circumstances exist as defined in 21 CFR 25.21. Thus, no env ironmental assessment 
is required according to 21 CFR 25.20(l). For the case of E-BPO/E -ATRA, 
microencapsulation of both BPO and tretinoin protects the tretinoin from oxidative 
decomposition by  [CONTACT_264679], there by [CONTACT_264680] n 
product and ensuring a suitable clinical and commercial shelf life. The encapsulation 
may also contribute to decreased skin irritation as evidenced in the 1 4-day minipig 
irritation study  referenced in the nonclinical section  of the Investigator ’s Brochur e. 
Combination topi[INVESTIGATOR_264624] s with acne ( Gollnick  2003 ). Combination thera py targets multiple 
pathogenic factors: abnormal follicular keratinization, P. acne s proliferation and 
inflammation. Combining the separate product applications into a single delivery  
system would provide the Patient  with the convenience of a single product, thus 
improving Patient  adherence and improving treatment outcomes.

11.1 Randomization and Blinding  
It is pla nned that  approximately 420 Patient s, who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
will be enrolle d in this study at up to  [ADDRESS_321650] s will be administered in a double -blinded fashion (i.e., the treatment 
assignment will not be known to the Patient  or to study personnel  including  Sol-Gel 
and its representatives ). Patient s will be instructed not to discuss the study product  with 
the study  personnel. Patient s will be randomly assigned , in a 2:1 ratio , as follows:  
• E-BPO/E -ATRA 3%/0.1%  Cream (Product S6G5T -3) (280 Patient s) 
• Vehicle Cream  (Product S6G5T -8) (140 Patient s) 
Each Patient  who signs an informed consent, meets inclusion/exclusion criteria,  and 
successful ly completes the screening procedures will be enrolled in the study. The 
Patient  randomization schedule will be a permuted block design stratified by 
[CONTACT_76537]. Blocks will be composed of 3 treatment assignments in a  ratio of 
2:[ADDRESS_321651] S6G5T -3 and vehicle respectively. Complete blocks from the 
randomization schedule will be allocated to investigational sites as they randomize 
Patient s to maintain the randomization rat io of 2:[ADDRESS_321652], but may  determine that 
unblinding of one or all Patient s may be necessary  in the case that the safety  of study 
Patient (s) is at risk. In an eme rgency, the study blind may be broken only if:  
• In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_264629]/or the PI, it is in the Patient 's best 
interest to do so .  
• Knowledge of the treatment will alter the clinical management of the Patient .  
In the case of an emergency that requires unblinding, the Investigator  can request to un -
blind the Patient  without prior contact [CONTACT_264682] -up 
between the Investigator  and Medical Monitor must occur so that all parties are aware 
of the unblinding. Although it is recommended that the Investigator  contact [CONTACT_264683] , in instances where this is not feasible or 
advisable , the PI [INVESTIGATOR_264630] 's treatment assignment. In all 
situations, the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS), will be used to obtain 
treatment assignment information , with limited access to only the above -designated 
individuals ; and any unblinding will be documented  in the source records  accordingly . 
Protocol version 2.0,  01Nov2018 , SGT -65-[ADDRESS_321653] meet the following eligibility /inclusion 
criteria:  
1. Patient must consent to participate, verified by [CONTACT_264684] (ICF). For Patients under the age of consent, both a 
signed assent form and a signed ICF from the parent/guardian are required in 
accordance with local and federal regulations.  
2. Male and female 9 years of age and older.  
3. Willingness and capacity for protocol compliance (for Patients under the age of 
consent, th e parent/guardian must be willing and able to comply with study 
requirements).  
4. Have a diagnosis of facial acne with ≥30 and ≤150 non -inflammatory lesions and 
≥20 and ≤[ADDRESS_321654] a score of “3” or “4” (Moderate or Seve re) on the IGA scale.  
6. Have two (2) or fewer cysts or nodules (defined as an inflammatory lesion greater 
than or equal to 5 mm in diameter).  
7. All females of child -bearing potential and premenarchal , excluding women who 
are surgically sterile (including Essure procedure, tubal ligation, bilateral 
oophorectomy or hysterectomy) or post -menopausal:  [defined as amenorrhea >12 
consecutive months; or women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with 
documented plasma follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level >35m LU/mL]  for 
at least [ADDRESS_321655] use one of the following birth control  methods  throughout the 
duration of the study:  
c) One of these high ly effective contraception methods:  
• Intrauterine device (IUD);  
• Hormonal, for at least 3 months. (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injections, implants, transdermal 
patch, vaginal ring);  
• Abstinence  
OR 
d) Double -barrier methods (male and female) of contraception listed below:  
• Combined use of male  and female condom;  
• Male condom and female occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) 
with spermicidal foam/gel/film/ cream/suppository; or  
• Male condom and female contraceptive sponge with spermicide  
In addition, Patients entering the trial that are on hormonal contraceptives must 
have been on this method for at least 3 consecutive  months (90 da ys) prior to 
Baseline and agree to continue the same hormonal contraceptive  for the duration 
of the trial. Patients who have used hormonal contraception and stopped must 
have stopped no less than [ADDRESS_321656] to ensure its efficacy.  
A sterile/vasectomized sexual partner alone is not considered an adequate form of 
birth control.   In this case an additional contraceptive method is required.  
8. Male Patients must be clean -shaven or have a cut beard/facial hair that does not

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 33 of 82 12 STUDY PROCEDURES  
12.1 Study Patient  Identification  
When the Patient  signs the informed consent, he/she will be assigned a three (3) -digit 
Patient  number. The complete Patient  ID will consist of the 3 -digit site number 
followed by [CONTACT_941] 3 -digit Patient  number: e.g.,  (first Patient  screened at site ). 
This number will remain with the Patient  for the duration of the study and will not be 
reassigned to another Patient  should the Patient  screen fail.  
12.2 Screen Failure and Discontinuation Criteria   
A screen failure is a Patient  who is not randomized/enrolled in the  study  due to 
ineligibilit y, after signing an IC F, and would not have receiv ed study product . The ICF 
signed by [CONTACT_264691] s who do not 
pass the screening procedures. The documentation should include identification of the 
eligibil ity criterion or criter ia that were and were not met. The Patient  should not be r e-
screened for this study  without Sol -Gel or designee ’s approval.  
Although encouraged to complete the study whenever possible, Patient s are free to 
discontinue their participation in this study at any time and for any reason without 
prejudice. A Patient  may be withdrawn from the study prior to study completion for 
any of the following reasons:  
• Investigator  opi[INVESTIGATOR_264650] ’s best interest to continue.  
• Patient  Request/Withdraw Consent – Whenever the Patient  decides it is in 
his/her be st interest to withdraw . 
• Lack of Efficacy/Worsening of Condition . 
• AE – when the Investigator  thinks it’s in the Patient ’s best interest  
• Lost to Follow -up – Documentation confirmed at minimum by [CONTACT_264692] . Best effort s should be performed to capture an explanation 
for the lost -to follow -up event.  
• Protocol Violation – When requirements of the protocol are not respected, 
especially when Patient  safety is concerned . 
• Pregnancy . 
Study staff should make effort s to encourage  Patient s to complete the study on time. 
If a Patient  prematurely withdraws during the study, every effort should be made to 
complete at least the Week 12/  End of Study or Early Termination  assessments .  
In the case of Patient s who discontinue due to an AE, the Investigator  will conduct 
follow -up contacts with the Patient  until the Investigator , Sponsor and Medical Monitor 
agree the event is satisfactorily resolved and/or stabilized.  
Patient s discontinued early from the study shall not be replaced.

stimulating hormone (FSH) level >35mLU/mL]  for at least 1 year), in addition to 
having a negative urine pregnancy test, must be willing to use an acceptable f orm of 
birth control during the study. An Investigator  may repeat the pregnancy test at any 
time during the study if there is any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_264652]. 
Urine pregnancy test will be conducted at every visit , starting from  Screening and until 
Week  12/ End of Study or Early Termination Visit.  If more than [ADDRESS_321670] should be 
repeated  at the B aseline visit .  For this study, the following are considered acceptable 
methods of birth control:  Intrauterine device (IUD); Hormonal, for at least 3 months. 
(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injections, implants, transdermal patch, vaginal ring); Abstinence. Double -
barrier methods (male and female) of the following contraception:  Combined use of 
male and female condom; Male condom and female occlusive cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/  cream/suppository; Male condom 
and female contraceptive sponge with spermicide.  
 
Patient s entering the trial th at are on hormonal contraceptives must have been on this 
method for at least 3 months (90 days) prior to the trial and continue the method for the 
duration of the trial. Patient s who had used hormonal contraception and stopped must 
have stopped no less than [ADDRESS_321671] to ensure its efficacy.  A 
sterile/vasectomized sexual partner alone is not considered an adequate form of birth 
control.  In this case an additional contraceptive method is required.

12.17  Clinical Outcome  Assessments  
Consistent with recommendations from the FDA “Guidance for Industry, Acne 
Vulgaris: Establishing Effectiveness of Drugs Intended for Treatment Guidance for 
Protocol version 2.0,  01Nov2018 , SGT -65-05  
   
   
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 41 of 82 Industry .” (May2018 ), the determination of efficacy will be based on evaluations of the  
IGA and inflammatory and non -inflammatory  absolute  lesion counts , on the face at 
Week 12 / End of  Study or Early Termination . Additionally, Patient  reports  of 
symptoms and disease impacts will be collected as secondary efficacy assessments.   
The Cutaneous Safety Assessment or Erythema and Scaling , evaluated by [CONTACT_3786] s, provides a reliable assessment of local effects, while the local toleran ce 
measures of itching, burning  and stinging sensation are designed to provide Patient -
reported outcomes that will support recommendations for use and expected reactions. 
The addition al safety measures, including AEs reporting, Urine Pregnancy Tests for 
females, and Concomitant Medications are standard, accepted measures in clinical 
research.  
Evaluators must be a physician or have appropriate documented experience and 
training.  Every effort will be made to ensure appropriate training is provided to the 
Investigator s for consistent diagnosis and evaluation of Acne Vulgaris . 
For consistency of evaluations, the same designated evaluator who performs the 
Baseline assessments shall perform the assessments at Week 12 / End of Study or Early 
Termination . When this becomes impossible, anoth er delegated evaluator may perform 
the assessments.  
12.18  Investigator  Global Assessment (IGA)  
The Investigator  Global Assessment (IGA) will be performed at  visits:  Screening , 
Baseline , Week s 2, 4, 8 and 12/ End of Study or Early Termination . 
Patient s are eligible for enrollment if they have facial acne with a global severity  grade 
of a 3 (moderate) or a 4 (severe) on the IGA scale  at Baseline .  
The IGA scale provided in the following Table will be used to describe the global 
severity grade and subsequent score:  
Table 2: Investigator  Global Assessment (IGA) Scale  
Grade  Description  
0 – Clear  Normal, clear skin with no evidence of acne vulgaris  
1 – Almost

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 42 of 82 12.19  Inflammatory and Non -Inflammatory Lesion Counts  
Lesions count  will be performed at visits: Screening, Baseline, Weeks  2, 4, 8 and 12/ 
End of Study or Early Termination .   
At Screening/Baseline , Patient s must have at least 20 and no more than 100 
inflammatory lesions (p apules, pustules) and at least 30 and no more than 150 non-
inflammatory  (open and closed comedones)  lesions on the face , including the nose . 
Patients  must have two (2) or fewer c ysts or nodules.  
12.19.1   Inflammatory  Lesion Definitions:  
Papule  – A small, solid elevation less than [ADDRESS_321675] of the lesion is 
above the surface of the skin . 
Pustule  – A small circumscribed elevation less than [ADDRESS_321676]  – An inflammatory lesion that contains yellow -white exudate that is greater than 
or equal to 5mm in diameter . 
12.19.2   Non-Inflammatory  Lesion Definitions:  
Open Comedone  - (Black head) A lesion in which the follicle opening is widely 
dilated with the contents protruding out onto the surface of the skin, with 
compacted melanin cells giving the plug a black appearance . 
Closed Comedone  - (White head) A lesion in which the foll icle opening is closed, but 
the sebaceous gland is enlarged by [CONTACT_264696], which in 
turn cause the skin around the follicle to thin and become elevated with a white 
appearance . 
12.20  Patient -Reported Outcomes (PRO)  
There are five PRO quest ionnaires to be administered in the  study and each is 
summarized below. Each will be administered to all Patient s, from the age of 9 years 
old, during the designated study visits with instruction s from the Study Staff  that they 
be completed :  
• Only by [CONTACT_264697] ’s 
response by a clinician or anyone else .  
• Prior to any other assessments or procedures.  
In the event the Patient  skips any questionnaire item (s); the Study Staff  will ask the 
Patient  to complete the form. The PRO questionnaire data will be entered into the 
eCRF , and a copy will be placed with the Patient  source at the site acc ording to the 
ICH-GCP guideline . 
 
The Patient -Reported Evaluation of Facial Acne (PRE -FACE ): The PRE -FACE , 
which can be completed in less than 2 minutes,  is a seven item PRO questionnaire that 
assesses acne vulgaris -related signs, symptoms and impacts.  The four -item acne sign 
and symptom domain (ASD) assesses the severity of acne vulgaris -related pi[INVESTIGATOR_59423], 
whiteheads, black heads, and redness, at their worst, in the 24 hours prior to 
Protocol version 2.0,  01Nov2018 , SGT -65-05  
   
   
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 43 of 82 administration on an 11 -point numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (“no 
[Concept] at all”) to 10 (“[Concept] as bad as you can imagine”).  The three -item acne 
impact domain (AID) assesses ac ne vulgaris -related embarrassment, self -
consciousness, and sadness in the seven days prior to administration on an 11 -point 
NRS ranging from 0 (“not [Concept] at all) to 10 (“extremely [Concept]”). The PRE -
FACE will be administered at study visits 2 -6, inc luding Screening , Baseline , and at 
Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 / End of Study or Early Termination .   
 
Patient  Global Impression of symptom Severity (PGI -S): The PGI-S (presented in 
appendi x 4) is a single -item global self -assessment of the current severity of Patients’ 
acne vulgaris symptoms rated on a five -point verbal response scale ranging from 0 
(None: No pi[INVESTIGATOR_59423], clear skin) to 4 (Very severe: Large amount of pi[INVESTIGATOR_59423], no clear 
skin), where higher scores indicate greater severity of acne vulgaris symptoms.  T he 
PGI-S will be administered at study visits 2-6, including Screening , Baseline , and at 
Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 / End of Study or Early Termination .  While PGI -S results can 
inform treatment efficacy, a main use for the tool in this study is to support 
suppl ementary anchor -based analysis.  Anchor -based analysis use an external criterion 
(in this case, the PGI -S) to categorize Patient s into groups each reflecting an a priori  
determined change groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (e.g., no change, large positive change, or large negative 
change) to inform conclusions about the meaning of observed within person change on 
other measures.       
 
Patient  Global Impression of Change (PGI -C): The PGI -C is a single item 
questionnaire that asks respondents to describe the change they have noticed in their 
acne symptoms since the start of the study on a 7 -point VRS ranging from “Very much 
improved” to “Very much worse”.  Patient s are encouraged to look in a mirror to help 
with their response and the questionnaire can be completed in less than 30 seconds.  
The PGI -C is administered via pen -and-paper at the site visits at Week 2, Week 4, Week 
8 and Week 12 / End of Study or Early Termination .  Simil ar to the PGI -S described 
above, the PGI -C data collected in this study to support supplementary anchor -based 
analysis.   
Patient  Global Impression of Treatment Satisfaction (PGI -TS): The PGI -TS is a 
single item questionnaire that asks respondents to descri be how satisfied they are 
“right now” with the acne treatment administered as part of the study on a 5 -point 
VRS ranging from “I am very satisfied” to “I am very dissatisfied”.  The 
questionnaire can be completed in less than 30 seconds and is administered  via pen -
and-paper at the site visits at Week 2, Week 4, Week 8 and Week 12 / End of Study or 
Early Termination . Though data generated from the PGI -TS can be used for other 
purposes, its primary purpose is to support anchor -based analyses that will inform 
how researchers may interpret the meaning of change in the primary and secondary 
assessments.  
 
Patient  Global Impression of treatment Side Effects (PGI -SE): The PGI -SE is a 
single item questionnaire that asks respondents to describe how bothered they are 
“right now” with the acne treatment administered as part of the study on a 5 -point 
VRS ranging from “I am not bothered” to “I am very bothered”.  The questionnaire 
can be completed in less than 30 seconds and is administered via pen -and-paper at the 
site vis its at Week 2, Week 4, Week 8 and Week 12 / End of Study or Early

assessments.  
 
12.21  Acne -Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (Acne -QoL)  
The Acne -specific Quality of Life questionnaire (Acne -QoL) is a health -related quality 
of life instrument developed by [CONTACT_246057] & CO., INC. for use in clinical trials to assess 
the impact of therapy on quality of life among patients with facial acne.  
The Acne -QoL questionnaire consists of [ADDRESS_321677] 
the patients to complete the questionnaire:  
• Only by [CONTACT_264698]’s 
response by a clinician or anyone else.  
• Prior to any other assessments or procedures.  
The Acne -QoL is sel f-administrated (i.e. the patient is able to complete the 
questionnaire without assistance) and should take approximately 10 minutes or less to 
complete. The questionnaire is administered via pen -and-paper (using a black ballpoint 
pen) during the site visi ts at Baseline visit and Week 12/ End of Study or Early 
Termination.  
In the event the Patient skips any questionnaire item(s); the Study Staff will ask the 
Patient to complete all of the questions. The Acne -QoL questionnaire data will be 
entered into the eCRF, and a copy will be placed with the remaining Patient’s source 
documents at the site according to the ICH -GCP guideline.  
The questions in the Acne -QoL questionnaire are organized in four domains which 
address the impact of facial acne on health -relate d quality of life (HRQoL): Self 
Perception, Role -Social, Role -Emotional and Acne Symptoms. The items included 
within each domain are those which facial acne sufferers consider important, which can 
distinguish between acne severity groups and were responsiv e to changes in acne 
severity over time following treatment in an uncontrolled study. For all domain scores, 
the responses to items comprising the domain are summed, and no weighting scheme 
is used.  
Self-Perception : The Self Perceptions domain of the Acne -QoL is comprised of [ADDRESS_321678] week. Items 
such as feeling self -conscious, feeling unattractive, dis satisfaction with self -appearance 
are included in the domain. The response options are on a 0 -6 scale (extremely, very 
much, quite a bit, a good bit, somewhat, a little bit, not at all). The range of possible 
scores is 0 to 30.  
Role -social : The Role -social  domain of the Acne -QoL is comprised of [ADDRESS_321679] of facial acne on a respondent’s intersocial 
relationships. For example, questions related to going out in public, meeting new 
Protocol version 2.0,  01Nov2018 , SGT -65-05  
   
   
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 45 of 82 people, and socializing are included. The response options are on 0 -6 scale (extremely, 
very much, quite a bit, a good bit, somewhat, a little bit, not at all). The range of possible 
scores is 0 to 24.  
Role -emotional : The Role -emotional domain is focused on the emotional effect or 
impact of facial  acne. The domain includes questions about the respondent’s annoyance 
at having to spend time cleaning and treating their face, their worry or concern that 
medications were working fast enough, the bothersomeness of needing to always have 
cover -up availabl e, etc. The response options are on a 0 -6 scale exactly as the same as 
that for the Self -Perceptions and Role -Social domains, ranging from “extremely” to 
“not at all”. The range of possible scores is 0 -30. 
Acne Symptoms : The final domain of the Acne -QoL is  aimed at assessing the physical 
symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_264699], which acne patients rated as frequent 
and important. The response options for this domain are on a 0 -6 scale (extensive, a 
whole lot, a lot, a moderate amount, some, very few, none) and differs from the above 
domains for several of the questions. Five questions comprise the Acne Symptoms 
domain covering symptoms such as the number of bumps on the face, the extent of 
scabbing from the acne, and the level of worry associated with scarring from the acne. 
Possible domain scores range from [ADDRESS_321680] 
been answered, the domai n score will not be calculated.  Further details on calculation 
of the domain scores will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13 PHOTOGRAPHY

• cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_264702] ’s 
state.  
Possible - The AE:  
• follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study product  administration  
• but that could readily be produced by a number of other factors.  
Unlikely - The AE:  
• Does not follow a reasonable temp oral sequence from the time of study drug 
administration; and  
• Was likely produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, 
therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy but for which relationship 
cannot be definitely ruled out . 
Not related  - The AE:  
• does not have a reasonable temporal association with the administration of study 
product   
• has some other obvious explanation for the event.

• Withdrawal from Study  
• Other  
 
15.2  Eliciting and Reporting of Adverse Events  
The Investigator  will periodically assess Patient s for the  occurrence of AEs. In order to 
avoid bias in eliciting AE, the Patient  or parent/legally authorized representative should 
be asked a non -specific question (e.g., “How have you been feeling since your last 
visit?”) to assess whether any AE has been exp erienced since the last visit. All AEs (as 
defined in Section 18.6), either observed by [CONTACT_264703]/her medical 
collaborators, or reported by [CONTACT_264704], or in response to direct 
questi oning, will be reported and documented in the source and the study reporting 
forms. When reporting an AE, the Investigator  must assign a severity grade to each 
event and declare an opi[INVESTIGATOR_264663]. Serious or unexpected AEs must be reported to  the CRO  within [ADDRESS_321685] assessment visit (or the Early Termination 
Visit) must be recorded on the AE eCRF with the status of the AE noted.  
AEs reporting begins from the signing of informed consent/assent. Study product -
related AEs should be foll owed until resolved or 30 days after the final study treatment . 
Regardless the duration of the study, all patients that exhibit SAE, will be followed up 
until the SAE resolves, based on Investigator ’s medical judgment  or are considered  to 
be chronic (stabi lized for at least 30 days). All events that are ongoing at this time will 
be recorded as ongoing on the eCRF.  
The following data should be documented for each AE:  
• Description of the symptom event  
Protocol version 2.0,  01Nov2018 , SGT -65-05  
   
   
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 50 of 82 • Classification of “serious” or “not serious”  
• Severity  
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  
• Action (s) taken  
• Causal relationship  
• Outcome of event ( Recovered /Resolved , Recovered /Resolved  with Sequelae, 
Not Recovered /Not Resolved,  Unknown , Fatal  [with date and cause reported])  
15.[ADDRESS_321686] -related AE(s) or SAE (s) should be 
followed by [CONTACT_264705], events determined to be 
chronic or the Patient  is lost to follow -up. Resolution means the Patient  has returned to 
the Baseline state of health, or the Investigator  does not expect any further improvement 
or worsening of the AE. The Investigator  should continue to report any significant 
follow -up infor mation to the sponsor up to the poin t that the event has resolved. Any 
SAE  reported by [CONTACT_264706] [ADDRESS_321687] learns o f the occurrence of the event.  
When reporting a SAE , the Investigator  (or the Study Coordinator) will promptly report 
any SAE  or pregnancy to the Spo nsor or its designee by [CONTACT_264707], immediately 
after the Investigator  becomes aware of the event. An SAE form should be completed 
and sent by [CONTACT_6791], email, or overnight courier to the Sponsor or its designee within 24 
hours of knowledge of the event by  [CONTACT_779]. In many cases, only preliminary 
information will be available. Appropriate follow up information should be sought 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], operative reports etc.) and a follow up SAE report form 
submitted. A designation of causality from t he study product  should always be included 
with a follow up report. Assess and report the causality of the event.  
15.4 Submitting an Expedited Safety Report to the IRB  
Once all supporting documentation is received for the reported event, the Medical 
Monitor, in conjunction with Sol -Gel, will determine if the safety report is eligible for 
expedited review. When expedited safety reporting to regulatory authorities is indee d 
required, the Investigator  should review and update any newly available materials at 
once. Follow -up queries may be sent to the study center to further clarify the event.  
The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for submitting reports of serious, 
unexpected related AEs to regulatory authorities on an expedited basis, according to the 
ICH E2A Guideline and to other regulatory authorities according to national and local 
regulations as required. The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for prompt 
submission to the IRB or EC of any expedited SAE reports submitted to regulatory

15.5 SAE & A Es Requiring Discontinuation of Study Drug, 
including Pregnancies  
Any SAE, should be collected following  signing the ICF  including any protocol 
required run -in period,  whether or not related to study product, must be reported to the 
Sponsor or its designee  immediately (within 24 hours) via telephone, email or 
facsimile. If initially reported via telephone, this must be followed -up by a facsimile or 
email of the written SAE  report within [ADDRESS_321688] will be 
discontinued from the study, but, regardless of the duration of the study, patients that 
exhibit serious adverse event (SAE), will be followed up until the SAE resolves, based 
on investigator’s medical judgment or are considered to be chronic (stabilized for at 
least 30 days).  For  safety reporting instructions see SAE and Pregnancy Form Report 
Instructions.  
 
15.6 Pregnancy  
At the time , Investigator  or site personnel  becomes aware that a study Patient  became 
pregnant following study participation, the Investigator  or designee will report the 
pregnancy immediately by [CONTACT_17084]/or by [CONTACT_29658] a completed Pregnancy Report to 
the Sponsor or its designee within one working day of being notified of the pregnan cy 
report.  
The report will include the following elements:  
• Patient  (mother’s) study identifier;  
• Date of Patient ’s last menstrual period;  
• Total accumulated dose of study treatment administered to date;  
• Date of study product  administration.  
The Investigator  will follow the Patient  until completion of the pregnancy and must 
assess the outcome in the shortest possible time but no more than [ADDRESS_321689] a 
follow -up Pregnancy Report with any relevant information on the present condition of 
the fetus to the Sponsor or its designee, including:  
• Mother’s study identifier(s);  
• Gestational age at delivery, miscarriage or abortion;  
Protocol version 2.0,  01Nov2018 , SGT -65-05  
   
   
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 52 of 82 • Birth weight, gender, length and head circumference, if available;  
• Apgar scores recorded after birth, if available;  
• Any abnormalities.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification of an 
SAE (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an 
aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y), 
the Investigator  will report the event by [CONTACT_80381] a completed SAE report 
form to the Sponsor or its designee within one working day of being notified of the 
pregnancy report.  
If the trial is completed before the outcome of the pregnancy is known, the Sponsor or 
its designee will assume the responsibility for following up on the pregnancy. The 
Sponsor or its designee will contact [CONTACT_264708] -up on the out come of pregnancy and 
will also check on the status of the infant [ADDRESS_321690] assessment visit (or the Early Termination Visi t) must 
be recorded on the AE eCRF wi th the  status of the AE noted.  
15.7.[ADDRESS_321691] assessment visit (or the Early Termination Visit ) 
must be recorded on the AE eCRF  page and reported to Sol-Gel according to the 
procedures outlined above. Patient s with un resolved previously reported SAE s, or any 
new SAE s identified on the last assessment visit, should be followed by [CONTACT_264709], or the Patient  is lost to follow -up. Resolution means the 
Patient  has returned to the baseline  state of health, or the Investigator  does not expect 
any further improvement or worsening of the event. The Investigator  should continue 
to report any significant follow -up information to Sol-Gel up to the poi nt that the event 
has resolved.  Any SAE  report ed by [CONTACT_264710] , should be reported to Sol-Gel and captured in the eCRF .

prior to dispensing and after return of each pump per flow chart (section 12.10 ). 
Each Patient  will be instructed on the importance of returning his or her study product  
at every  designated visit (excluding on Visit3 / Week 2) . If a Patient  does not return his 
or her study product , he or she will be instructed to return it at  the next visit.  
The study coordinator will question the Patient  on history of study product  use since 
the last visit and will record any missed doses (as recorded on the Patient  diary) in both 
the source documents and the appropriate eCRF. A Patient  who deviates significantly 
from the presc ribed dosage will be counseled.  
Protocol version 2.0,  01Nov2018 , SGT -65-[ADDRESS_321700]  should be stored refrigerated ( 2°C to 8°C, 36°F to 46°F) at the  site, 
excursions permitted down to 0°C (32°F) and up to 25°C (77 °F) until it is dispensed to 
the Patient . After dispensing to the Patient , the pump  should be stored at room 
temperature at or below  25°C (77°F) with. Do not freeze the product.  
16.[ADDRESS_321701]  will be made to the face once daily , at home and  
prior to  bedtime , after cleansing , for a period of twelve (12) weeks. Study product  will 
be applied as a thin coating that is gently rubbed into the skin.  
Each Patient  will receive both verbal and written instructions (see  Appendix  1) as to 
the proper dosing and study product  application techniques.  
Patient s will cleanse their face with the given cleanser or Sponsor ’s approved cleanser 
using only the hands and pat dry with a soft clean towel. After the face has dried 
completely, the Patient  shall apply one "pea sized" amount on each area of the face 
(chin, left cheek, right cheek, nose and forehead). The Patient  will ne ed to spread the 
investigational product smoothly and evenly.  The investigational product will not be 
used on the mouth, eyes, inside the nose and lips or any body part other than the face. 
The Patient  should wash his/her hands after application but shoul d not wash face at 
least [ADDRESS_321702] 30 minutes 
before applying moisturizer/sunscreen after application of study product to the face.   
No time interval between dosing and meals or any other activit y is specified.  During 
the trial , Investigator s should remind Patient s to avoid exposure to sunlight and 
sunlamps and to wear sunscreen when sun exposure cannot be avoided.  
Patient s will be instructed to continue using the same supplied/ approved facial cleanser 
and not to change products during the study. At each visit, Patient s are to be asked if 
they have changed their cleansing routine. The supplied/ approved cleanser and 
moisturizer/ sunscreen should be applied according to the directio ns on the  bottle . 
If necessary and in the case where a sunscreen with a higher SPF is required, Patient  
can be instructed to use another moisturizer with sunscreen that includes a higher SPF 
(Sun Protection Factor). Such case will require Sponsor approval.  
Facial makeup (non -medicated) may be applied according to the Patient ’s normal daily 
routine (but not prior to [ADDRESS_321703]  application); however , Patient s 
should be instructed not to apply the moisturizer  or sunscreen  or combination of them  
or wear make -up during study visits as it may interfere with the evaluator’s 
assessments. No other products should be used on the face.  
Pump usage will be demonstrated by [CONTACT_264715] a sample pump at the clinic 
to help assure the Patient  understands the procedure . The Patient  will be provided a set 
of instructions ( Appendix 1 ) that includes study reminders and restrictions as described

17 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
17.1 General Statistical Methods   
All statistical processing will  be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later unless 
otherwise stated. Statistical significance will be based on two -tailed tests of the null 
hypothesis resulting in p -values of 0.05 or less.   
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be ba sed on estimation using 
the method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) imputation. The estimation will be 
done for each treatment group separately so that the pattern of missingness for one 
group does not influence the estimation of missing data for another  group. Groups of 
complete datasets following the estimation will be concatenated to form analysis 
datasets for the comparative analyses and subsequent imputation result inference with 
SAS PROC MIANALYZE. Descriptive statistics will also be derived from th e multiply 
imputed datasets.  
Sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy endpoints will use [ADDRESS_321706] method will use a repeated measures ANCOVA, with 
treatment, analysis center, and visit (i.e., Week 2, Week 4 a nd Week 8) as independent 
factors and a covariate of baseline. In this analysis, data from all post -baseline visits 
will be included with no imputation for missing data.  
The second sensitivity analyses will use the model based multiple imputation method 
to impute missing data for the absolute change at Week 12.  
The third sensitivity analysis will involve a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275].  
Protocol version 2.0,  01Nov2018 , SGT -65-05

regression model and a model based multiple imputation and tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275].  
A SAP, describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate document. The 
SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments.  
17.1.1  Patient  Disposition  
A tabulation of Patient  disposition will b e provided. The tabulation will include the 
numbers of Patient s who enter the study, complete the study, and discontinue the study. 
The reasons for discontinuation will be included.  
17.1.2  Demographics  and Baseline Characteristics  
Patient  demographic and baseline  characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_112980], PP, and safety populations. For continuous variables (e.g. age) 
comparisons among the two treatment groups will be conducted using a two -way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with factors of tr eatment group and analysis center  (see 
section 17.4.5  for definition of “analysis center”) . Ethnicity and race will be analyzed 
with a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by [CONTACT_85229]. Past and current 
medical  conditions, as well as history of disease will be presented in a data listing.

• [ADDRESS_321708]-baseline safety evaluation.  
An intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis will be conducted. A per -protocol (PP) analysis will 
also be conducted. Patient s will be eligible for the PP analysis if they complete the 12 -
week evaluation without noteworthy study protocol vi olations (i.e., any Patient  or 
Investigator  activity that could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic 
administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy). The PP 
population will include Patient s in the ITT population wh o do not meet any of the 
following criteria:  
• Failed any of the inclusion/exclusion criteria;  
• Have taken any interfering concomitant medications;  
• Did not attend the Week 12 Visit ; 
• Missed more than [ADDRESS_321709] baseline study visit prior to Week 12 ;

more than five consecutive days of dosing and must take 80 -120% of expected 
doses. The number of expected doses will be determined for each Patient  based 
on the length of their pa rticipation in the study);  
• Out of visit window (+ 4 days) at the [ADDRESS_321710]  Evaluations and Analyses  
Inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion count will be recorded for each Patient  at 
Baseline and at We eks 2, 4, 8, and 12. The absolute and percent change from baseline 
of inflammatory lesions will be derived for each Patient  at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
The IGA will be recorded for each Patient . The IGA will be dichotomized into 
“success” and “failure” at We eks 2, 4, 8, and [ADDRESS_321711] 
Clear.  
Patient s will be asked to complete PRO questionnaire s at appropriate time points .  
All statistical a nalysis will be conducted for both PP and ITT population.  
17.3 Assessment of Efficacy  
Primary, secondary, and supportive efficacy analyses will be conducted on the ITT 
(primary) population. Primary efficacy analyses will be conducted on the PP 
(supportive) population.  
17.3.1   Primary Efficacy  
There are two co-primary efficacy endpoints:  
• Proportion of Patients with an assessment of clear or almost clear and with at 
least a 2 -grade improvement in IGA from baseline at Week 12.  
• Absolute change from Baseline in lesion count on the face at Week 12 
(separately for inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesions).  
17.3.2   Secondary Efficacy  
The secondary efficacy endpoints will be the following:  
• Percent change from Baseline, in non -inflammatory lesion count at Week 12.  
• Percent change f rom Baseline, in inflammatory lesion count at Week 12.  
• Proportion of patients in the E -BPO/E -ATRA cream arm compared to vehicle 
control achieving at least a 4 -point reduction on Item 1 (pi[INVESTIGATOR_59423]) of the PRE -FACE

17.3.3  Supportive Efficacy  
 Supportive efficacy endpoints include the following:  
• Proportion of Patient s with an assessment of clear or almost clear and with at 
least a 2 -grade improvement in IGA at Weeks 2, 4 and 8.  
• Absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory  and non -inflammatory  lesion 
counts from Baseline to weeks 2, 4 and 8.  
• PRE-FACE ASD:   Mean absolute change in PRE -FACE ASD scores from 
Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, and 8.  
• PRE-FACE AID: Mean absolute change in PRE -FACE AID scores from 
Baseline to Weeks 2, 4, and 8.  
• Proportion of Patient s in treatment relative to control who report at least 
“minimally improved” as measured by [CONTACT_87792] -C at Week 12.  
• Patient  Global Impress of Symptom Severity (PGI -S) at Week 12.  
• Patient  Global Impression of Treatment Satisfaction (PGI -TS) at Week 12.  
17.3.[ADDRESS_321712] will be included in the model; 
otherwise it will be removed.  
A skewness test, based on the methods presented by J.H. Zar  (1984) , will be applied to 
the residuals resulting from an ANCOVA. A two -sided p -value for the skewness test 
significant at 0.01 will imply the use of the non -parametric method. If a parametric 
analysis is indicated, the results of the parametric analysis will b e considered the 
primary analysis. Should a non -parametric analysis be indicated, the absolute or percent

primary analysis; however, results of the non -ranked transformed analyses will also be 
presented.  
17.4.[ADDRESS_321713] of Superiority for IGA  
The IGA will be dichotomized into “success” and “failure” with a Patient  considered a 
success for those visits if the Investigator ’s Global Assessment is at least 2 grades less 
than Baseline and “Clear ” or “Almost Clear ”. The analysis of the dichotomized IGA 
will be based on a logistic regression test with factors of treatment group and analysis 
center.  
17.4.[ADDRESS_321714] of Superi ority for Secondary  Efficacy and Control of 
Multiplicity  
Appropriate descriptive statistics will be computed for all Secondary Efficacy 
parameters. Additionally, all inferential testing of percent change in lesions will follow

17.4.4  Supportive Efficacy Analyses  
Appropriate descriptive statistics will be computed for all Supportive Efficacy 
parameters. Additionally, all inferential testing will follow the methods for the co -
primary variables wherein the continuous variables will parallel the lesion count 
analyses and the discrete variables will follow the analysis of the IGA.  
17.4.5  Pooling Analysis  
The clinical study will be conducted under a common protocol for each investigational 
site with the intention of pooling the data for analysis. Every effort will be made to 
promote consistency in study execution at each investigational site. The study is 
intended to be conducted in a manner such that a minimum of 5 Patient s will be enrolled 
in each treatment arm for any Investigator . In the event that there are too few Patient s 
in a treatment arm for an Investigator , then this Investigator 's data will be combined to 
achieve the desired sample size minimum per arm. The combining of Investigator 's data 
will be accomplished by [CONTACT_264716] a nd 
combining it with the Investigator  with the largest enrollment. If there is a further need 
to combine data, then the data of the Investigator  with the second smallest enrollment 
will be combined with the Investigator 's data which had the second largest enrollment 
and so on. This process will continue for all Investigator s who did not have a minimum 
of [ADDRESS_321716] 
insufficient Patient s per treatment arm will result in redefining the groups of 
Investigator s for the purposes of statistical analyses. These combined groups will be 
referred to as "analysis centers" in the statistical analyses based on ANCOVA and 
stratified logistic testing.  
Prior to investigating the treatment effect within the analysis centers, the treatment 
effect within investigational site will be investigated to determine if the site -to-site 
variability is such that it could mask the analysis center effects. Thus, prior  to pooling, 
change from baseline in inflammatory lesions and non -inflammatory lesions will be 
analyzed with an ANCOVA (unranked or ranked) with factors of treatment group, 
investigational site, and treatment group by [CONTACT_264717], and the 
respective baseline lesion count variable as a covariate. The dichotomized primary 
endpoint will be analyzed with a logistic regression with factors of treatment group, 
investigational site, and the interaction term of treatment group by [CONTACT_30816] l site. 
If any of the analyses are not computationally feasible due to some investigational sites 
having very few Patient s enrolled, the low -enrolling investigational sites will be 
excluded from the analysis.  
The consistency of treatment response will be i nvestigated across the analysis centers 
subsequent to combining the data as described above. Statistical tests will be conducted 
to identify if there are extreme analysis centers that could affect the interpretation of 
common statistical and clinical concl usions. An analysis center by [CONTACT_264718] 0.10. Change from baseline in inflammatory lesions will be analyzed 
with an ANCOVA (unranked or  ranked) with factors of treatment, analysis center, and 
treatment by [CONTACT_264719] a covariate. For the purpose of testing consistency of treatment response, the 
Protocol version 2.0,  01Nov2018 , SGT -65-[ADDRESS_321717] a significant ANCOVA or logistic 
regression interaction term.  In the event that the ANCOVA or logistic regression 
interaction (referred to henceforth as the "appropriate test") p -value is less than or equal 
to 0.10, a sensitivity analysis that excludes analysis centers with the extreme efficacy 
result will be perfor med to determine the robustness of the treatment effect. On the 
other hand, if the outcome of the appropriate test has a p -value greater than 0.10, then 
the conclusions from the pooled data will be considered to be free of the impact of 
extreme analysis ce nters.  
The first step in conducting a sensitivity analysis is to identify the extreme analysis 
center or centers that contribute to the statistical signifi cance of the appropriate test. 
The process involves submitting subsets of analysis centers to the app ropriate test and 
observing the appropriate test p -value for the subset. Subsets with p -values greater than 
0.[ADDRESS_321718] -hoc aspects of the 
process will be  given when the results are interpreted. Conclusions will be presented by 
[CONTACT_85220].  
17.4.6  Missing Efficacy Data Imputations  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Lesion Count  and PRE -FACE Variable Missing Data Imputation  
Missing Week 12 d ata will be estimated by [CONTACT_264720]. Missing lesion count data will be derived for the analysis using the method 
of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. Imputation will be 
conducted independently for each treatment group.  
Multiple imputation and subsequent analysis will involve [ADDRESS_321719] phases with these 
principal tasks:  
Protocol version 2.0,  01Nov2018 , SGT -65-05  
   
   
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 63 of 82 1. Create a dataset of Patient s, one for each treatment group, with observed values 
and tho se needing estimation by [CONTACT_85222]. The missing lesion count values in 
each dataset will be filled in using the MCMC method 5 times to generate 5 
datasets. The resulting datasets for each treatment arm will be combined into 
one complete dataset for each imputation.  
Syntax:  
proc mi data=datai n out=dataout seed=&seed. nimpute=5 <options>;  
where trtpn= (1, or 2);  
mcmc chain=multiple;  
var baseline week2 week4 week8 week12;  
run; 
2. For each complete dataset, the variable of interest  for baseline minus the Week 
[ADDRESS_321720] been pre -specified by [CONTACT_2329] a random number 
generator:  
• Inflammatory Lesion Counts; S6G5T -3: Seed  = 813883085       
• Inflammatory Lesion Counts; S6G5T -8 Vehicle: Seed  = [PHONE_5477]         
• Non-inflammatory Lesion Counts; S6G5T -3: Seed  = [PHONE_5478]           
• Non-inflammatory Lesion Counts; S6G5T -8 Vehicle: Seed  = [PHONE_5479]        
[IP_ADDRESS]  IGA Missing Data Imputation  
A similar procedure will be used for the analyses based on proportion of IGA successes 
wherein the ANCOVA analysis is replaced with a logistic regression analysis.  
Specifically, missing Week 12 IGA values from which the dichotomized IGA is derived 
will be estimated by (MCMC). The pattern of missing observations in each treatment 
group cannot influence the missing value estimation in the other because the imputation 
is being conducted independently for each treat ment group.  
The missing Week 12 IGA values will be derived for the analysis using the method of 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. Multiple imputation and 
subsequent analysis will involve 4 principal tasks:  
1. Create a dataset, one for each treatment group, of Patient s with observed values 
and those needing estimation by [CONTACT_85222]. The missing IGA values in each 
dataset will be filled in using the MCMC method 5 times to generate 5 datasets. 
The resulting datasets for each treatment arm will be combined into one 
complete dataset by [CONTACT_47915].  
Syntax:  
proc mi data=datain out=dataout seed=&seed. nimpute=5 <options>;  
  where trtpn=(1, or 2);  
  mcmc chain=multiple;  
  var baseline week2  week4 week8 week12;  
run; 
2. For each complete dataset, the dichotomous success rate (clear or almost clear 
with a 2 -point change from baseline) will be computed. The Week [ADDRESS_321721] been pre -specified by [CONTACT_2329] a random number 
generator:

• PRO Embarrassment Scores; S 6G5T -3 Vehicle: Seed = [PHONE_5481]      
17.4.7   Sensitivity Efficacy Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sensitivity analyses for absolute change in lesion count  
The first sensitivity analys es for absolute change in lesion count  (both inflammatory 
and non -inflammatory)  will use a repeated measures ANCOVA, with treatment, 
analysis center, and visit (i.e., Week 2, Week 4 and Week 8) as independent factors and 
a covariate of baseline lesion count. In this analysis, data from all pos t-baseline visits 
will be included with no imputation for missing data.  
The second sensitivity analys es will use the model based multiple imputation method 
to impute missing data for the absolute change in lesion counts at Week 12. Although 
the full detail s will be presented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), the multiple 
imputation will involve 4 principal tasks:  
1. Missing values will be filled in 5 times to generate 5 complete datasets. The 
imputation model used will be an ANCOVA with factors of treatment group 
and analysis center, and a covariate of baseline lesion count ( i.e., the imputation 
model will be the same as the analysis model). Appropriate modifications wil l 
be made should the analysis be based on a non -parametric method.  
2. Each complete dataset will be analyzed with an ANCOVA with factors of 
treatment group, and analysis center, and a covariate of baseline lesion count.  
3. Results from these analyses will be com bined into a single inference.  
The third sensitivity analysis will involve a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275].  Full details will be 
presented in the SAP . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sensitivity analyses for IGA  
The first sensitivity analysis for the dichotomized IGA success will use a repeated  
measures logistic regression model (generalized estimating equations), with 
dichotomized IGA success as the dependent variable and treatment, analysis center, and 
visit (i.e., Week 2, Week 4 and Week 8) as independent factors. In this analysis, data 
from all post -baseline visits will be included with no imputation for missing data.  
The second sensitivity analysis will use the model based multiple imputation method 
to impute missing data for the dichotomized IGA data. Although the full details will be 
prese nted in the SAP, the multiple imputation will involve 4 principal tasks:  
1. Missing values will be filled in 5 times to generate 5 complete datasets. The 
imputation model used logistic regression with factors of treatment group and 
analysis center ( i.e., the imputation model will be the same as the analysis 
model).  
Protocol version 2.0,  01Nov2018 , SGT -65-[ADDRESS_321722] sensitivity analysis will involve a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275].  Full details will be 
presented in the SAP . 
17.4.8  Subgroup Analyses  
Subset analyses will be conducted for the ITT populations for the subgroups baseline 
global severity, gender, age, ethnicity, race, and  geographic region. Age will be 
dichotomized to less than the median age of Patient s and greater than or equal to the 
median age of Patient s. An additional analysis will include age with categories of less 
than 18 and 18 to less than the median age and gre ater than or equal to the median age. 
Subset analyses will be conducted on the variables absolute change from baseline in  
inflammatory lesions at Week 12 as well as the dichotomized global severity score at 
Week 12. These analyses will contain only descrip tive statistics.  
17.5 Assessment of Safety  
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_85172], the Investigator  Cutaneous Safe ty 
Assessm ent rating of pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], er ythem a, dryness  and scaling; and the Patient  
assessment of Local Tolerability  rating itching , burning  and stinging will be presented 
with descriptive statistics at Baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 for each treatment 
group. Frequencies and percentages for each outcome category will be included in these 
statistics. Mean values will be presented graphically by [CONTACT_85223].

2.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 Background  
 
Although effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly increased the life 
expectancy of individuals with HIV -1 infection, mortality rates are still higher compared to 
the HIV -1 uninfected population.1-3 In HIV -1 infection, despi[INVESTIGATOR_68325], the 
levels of cellular immune activation and inflammation rarely return to levels observed in 
HIV-1 seronegative individuals.4,5 It is believed that the non -AIDS -associated morbidity 
and mortality is due , in part, to the consequences of this persistent immune activation 
and elevated levels of systemic inflammation.6  Furthermore, the levels of inflammation 
are higher in ART -treated individuals with incomplete immune reconstitution compared 
to those with good CD4+ T cell recovery.7,8 Although persistent viremia has been 
proposed to be the major cause of immune activation and inflammation in HIV -1 
infection, in virally suppressed individuals, chronic inflammation has also been 
hypothesized to be due to a number of different factors including depletion of CD4+ T 
cells in the gut mucosa leading to the continued translocation of microbial products into 
11 
 
 
 
the circulation,9,10 reactivation of other viruses such as cytomegalovirus,11,12 or 
dysregulation of T cell homeostasis.13 A number of clinical trials are currently assessing 
these possible causes, as well as evaluating various immunotherapeutic agents as 
strategies to decrease the inflammation.  
 
In increased inflammatory states, adenosine (ADO) is produced by [CONTACT_68366], the latter being the more significant source of ADO 
generation.14 ADO limits cellular damage by [CONTACT_68367], 
A2A/2BR, leading to increased intracellular cAMP and a subsequent anti -inflammatory 
effect.15  ADO is a highly potent immunoregulatory nucleoside that is produced by [CONTACT_68368], hypoxia, and inflammation in order to 
limit the tissue damag e,15-17 with levels increasing from nano- molar to micro -molar 
concentrations during inflammatory states.14,16,18  Extracellular generation of ADO is 
facilitated by [CONTACT_68369]39 and CD73. ATP released by [CONTACT_68370]39 to 5’ -AMP, which in turn is hydrolyzed by [CONTACT_398]73 to 
ADO.[ADDRESS_74512] lymphoid cells where ligation 
causes an increase in cAMP production thereby [CONTACT_68371].15,20 ADO is then transported intracellularly down its concentration 
gradient by [CONTACT_68372].
21 During T cell activation, A 2AR signaling may allow T 
cell proliferation but cytoki ne production is strongly inhibited.22 In vitro  studies show that 
A2AR signaling also protects CD4+ T cells from activation- induced cell death by [CONTACT_68373].23 Apart from regulating T lymphocytes, ADO through the 
A2AR signaling, prevent s excessive macrophage activation leading to a decrease in the 
expression of TNFα and nitric oxide24 and a switch to the production of the anti -
inflammatory  cytokine IL- 10.25 Indeed, recent  in vitro  studies using T cells from both 
normal controls (NC) and HIV -1+ subjects demonstrated the ability of exogenous ADO to 
inhibit both T cell secretion of TNFα and IL -2 secretion as well as T cell immune 
activation.  
 
It has been  shown that the levels of CD73- expressing CD4+ T cells are markedly 
reduced in the peripheral blood of HIV -1-infected patients regardless of viral 
suppression, and that ADO decreases T cell immune activation in a concentration dependent manner.
26 The decreased levels of ADO, due to the low numbers of 
CD4+CD73+ T cells, fail s to counter HIV -1-associated persistent immune activation and 
subsequent increased inflammation.  It is hypothesized that an intervention increasing 
extracellular ADO will le ad to decreased immune activation in HIV -1-infected subjects.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_74513](s) that 
regulates the elevated levels of immune activation and inflammation is paramount in the 
prevention of these chronic diseases and in increasing the life expectancy of those living 
with HIV-1. Furthermore, identification of specific pathways will lead to the development 
of more effective immunotherapeutic strategies that target and regulate these pathways.  
 
Dipyridamole ( DP) is an FDA -approved medication used as an  adjunct to  anticoagulants 
in preventing post -operative thromboembolic complications following heart surgery, and 
has been studied with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_68326].27,[ADDRESS_74514] of DP is evident in an earlier study by [CONTACT_68374]., which showed DP inhibiting 
LPS- induced superoxide anion release and tissue factor (TF) expression in peripheral 
blood monocytes.[ADDRESS_74515] of DP were validat ed in a clinical trial by 
[CONTACT_68375].30 In this randomized, double- blind study, healthy male subjects received 
either extended- release DP (200mg twice daily) or placebo for 7 days. The subjects then 
received a 2ng/kg dose of endotoxin. DP treatment caused an 89% reduction in nucleoside transporter activity as well as an increase in endogenous ADO concentration, with the DP levels strongly correlating with peak ADO concentrations (r=0.82; P<0.01). 
DP augmented the LPS -induced increase in levels of the anti -inflammatory cyto kine, IL-
10. Furthermore, the decline of TNFα and IL -6 levels was accelerated in DP -treated 
subjects.  
 
Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is an important co -morbidity in HIV that may 
also be the consequence of immune activation and systemic inflammation. COPD , 
characterized by [CONTACT_68376]
36, is the fourth leading 
cause of death in the [LOCATION_002].   COPD is defined by [CONTACT_68377] “a preventable and treatable disease…characterized by 
[CONTACT_68378]” and is generally defined by [CONTACT_68379][INVESTIGATOR_31737] (FEV 1)/forced vital capacity (FVC)<0.70, with the 
severity of airflow obstruction measured by [CONTACT_68380] 136.  HIV is an 
independent risk factor for COPD, and there has been a three -fold increase in 
obstructive lung disease deaths in HIV since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy 
(ART)37-39. We see an average rate of decline in FEV 1 in our cohorts of stable HIV -
infected outpatients (including non -smokers and those without any lung disease) of 
approximately 75- 98ml/year, which is far greater than that seen in both non- smoking and 
smoking HIV -uninfected individuals who typi[INVESTIGATOR_68327] a 20-60ml/year decline.  In 
addition, FEV [ADDRESS_74516] similarly found that FEV 1 is related to mortality in our cohort of 
237 HIV+ individuals followed for an average of 3.2 years, with those dying having 
FEV 1/FVC of 0.69 (SD 0.15) compared to 0.77 (SD 0.10) in survivors (p=0.031). Decline 
in FEV 1 in HIV may be related to local and systemic inflammation as we see increases in 
lung and blood cyto kines, markers of immune activation, and co -infections in HIV+ 
individuals with lung dysfunction. The inflammation may be exaggerated by [CONTACT_68381], but 
does not depend on smoke exposure.   We have recently shown that worse airflow 
obstruction is associated with increased immune activation and infl ammation including 
increases in IL- 6, hsCRP, and activated T- cells.[ADDRESS_74517] also 
found correlations of FEV 1 with IL -8 and endothelin- 1 (ET1), and confirmed associations 
with IL -6. Based on these observations, inflammation is impor tant in HIV pulmonary 
dysfunction.  We will measure FEV [ADDRESS_74518]  
 
Dipyridamole42 is an antiplatelet agent chemically described as 2,2',2'',2''' -[(4,8-
Dipi[INVESTIGATOR_68328][5,4- d ]pyrimidine- 2,6-diyl)dinitrilo] -tetraethanol. It has the following 
structural formula:  
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of Action :  
DP inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes in 
vitro and in vivo; the inhibition occurs in a dose- dependent manner at therapeutic 
concentrations (0.5 -1.9 µg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local 
concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A2 -receptor thereby [CONTACT_68382] -3',5'-adenosine monophosphate 
(cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to 
various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine 
diphosphate (ADP).  
 
DP inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP -
PDE is weak, therapeutic levels of DP  inhibit cyclic -3',5'- guanosine monophosphate-
PDE (cGMP- PDE), thereby [CONTACT_68383] .  
  
Pharmaco kinetics : 
Following an oral dose of DP  tablets, the average time to peak concentration is about 75 
minutes. The decline in plasma concentration following a dose of DP  tablets fits a two-
14 
 
 
 
compartment model. The alpha half -life (the initial decline following peak concentration) 
is approximately 40 minutes. The beta half -life (the terminal decline in plasma 
concentration) is approximately 10 hours. DP  is highly bound to plasma proteins. It is 
metabolized in the liver where it is conjugated as a glucuronide and excreted with the 
bile.  Drug interactions with HIV medications, including protease inhibitors , are not 
predicted.  
 
Indications for DP: 
DP (Persantine®) t ablets are indicated as an adjunct to warfarin  anticoagulants in the 
prevention of postoperative thromboembolic complications of cardiac valve replacement.  
The recommended oral dose is [ADDRESS_74519] to the usual 
warfarin therapy.  
 
Precautions and Adverse Reactions : 
DP has a vasodilatory  effect and should be used with caution in patients with severe 
coronary artery disease (e.g., unstable angina or recently sustained myocardial 
infarction). Chest pain may be aggravated in patients with underlying coronary ar tery 
disease who are receiving DP . Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have 
been reported in association with DP  administration.  DP should be used with caution in 
patients with hypotension since it can produce peripheral vasodilation.  
 
DP has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of 
adenosine and may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors, 
thereby [CONTACT_68384].   
 
Adverse reactions at therapeutic doses are usually minimal and transient. With long-term 
use of DP  tablets , initial side effects usually disappear. The following reactions in Table 
1 were reported in two heart valve replacement trials comparing DP  tablets and warfarin 
therapy to either warfarin alone or warfarin and placebo:

Other reactions from uncontrolled studies include diarrhea, vomiting, flushing and 
pruritus. In addition, angina pectoris has been reported rarely and there have been rare 
reports of liver dysfunction. On those uncommon occasions when adverse reactions 
have been persistent or intolerable, they have ceased on withdrawal of the medication.  
 When DP tablets were administered concomitantly with warfarin, bleeding was no 
greater in frequency or severity than that observed when warfarin was administered 
alone. I n rare cases, increased bleeding during or after surgery has been observed.  The

6.3.10  Brachial Artery FMD  
 
The brachial FMD assessment will be performed and interpreted at the University 
of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_68339] (URL) as 
per Section 6.1.  
 
Subjects who are prematurely discontinuing the study should have a brachial 
FMD tes t only if it has been ≥[ADDRESS_74561] FMD assessment.  
 
Considerations for the Brachial Artery FMD Scanning:  
1. Subjects should fast and abstain from exercise and smo king for at least 8 
hours prior to the study visit and be afebrile (afebrile (oral T < 38 degrees C) , 
at the visit; otherwise these assessments must be rescheduled.  
 
a) Subjects should be fasting (nothing but water or black decaffeinated 
coffee for 8 hours prior to evaluation; drin king black decaffeinated coffee 
is considered an exception but is not advised).  
 
2. No blood pressure (BP) measurements or venipuncture are permitted in the 
right arm before the ultrasound scan.  
 
3. FMD assessments should be done in the morning, approximately  at the same 
time.  
 
Brachial artery size in response to an endothelium -dependent stimulus will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_68392].  Baseline brachial artery diameter will be measured using 2 -D ultrasonography.  A blood 
pressure cuff will be placed proximal to the brachial artery and will be inflated to suprasystolic pressure (cuff inflation will be 40mmHg above the systolic blood 
pressure) for [ADDRESS_74562] will be positioned in the left lateral decubitus position for the following 
procedures:  
• Rectal swab for GC/CT 
• Visual and digital rectal exam:   The examiner will conduct a visual 
examination of the anus and surrounding area and note any abnormality.   
The examiner will then insert a lubricated gloved finger into the anal canal and sweep around the internal anal circumference.  
• Enema: A [ADDRESS_74563]  will hold the fluid in 
the rectum for 5 minutes then expel it.  
• Flexible sigmoidoscopy and biopsy: A flexible sigmoidoscope will be inserted 
to approximately 10- [ADDRESS_74564] -bronchodilator s pi[INVESTIGATOR_038]  (for participants enrolled under Version 
2.0) 
  Participants will be asked to withhold use of any short -acting bronchodilators for 
at least [ADDRESS_74565] 3 acceptable forced vital capacity maneuvers 
should be performed according to ATS standards: a maximal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_68340] a maximal forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_68341]. The 
participant should be  seated. Ensure that the [ADDRESS_74566] FEV1 values are within 5% 
of each other.  Participants will then be given 4puffs (360ug) of albuterol from a 
metered dose inhaler through a spacer. Three acceptable forced vital capacity 
maneuvers will again be performed acc ording to ATS standards.  Refer to the 
Manual of Procedures  (MOPS) for detailed instructions.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_74567] management, dose interruptions, modifications, and discontinuation 
of treatment will be mandated only for toxicities attributable to DP . 
 The grading system is located in the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and 
Pediatric Adverse Events Version 1.0 - December 2004 (Clarification dated August 
2009), which can be found on the Division of AIDS Regulatory Support Center Web site: 
http://rsc.tech -res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance/
.  
 The management of toxicities suspected to be due to ART should be according to 
standard clinical practice .   
 
7.1 Toxicity  
 
7.1.1  General Reactions  
 
• Grade [ADDRESS_74568] will be followed until the toxicity resolves.   
 
• Grade [ADDRESS_74569] the study drug held . Subjects should be followed closely and if 
the AE does not return to Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_74570] be permanently discontinued.  
 With a Grade 3 AE that is judged not related to the study drug by [CONTACT_1275], the study drugs may be continued at the discretion of the 
site investigator with close follow up.  
 Subjects experiencing Grade 3 AEs requiring permanent 
discontinuation of study treatment should be followed closely for 
resolution of the AE to Grade ≤ 2 . 
 
Subjects with Grade 3 asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities in 
cholesterol, creatine kinase (CK) or triglycerides may continue study 
treatment.  
 
• Grade [ADDRESS_74571]/ALT Elevations  
 
• Grade [ADDRESS_74572] and ALT should be repeated 
within 2 weeks.  
 
• Grade [ADDRESS_74573] or ALT returns to < Grade 2, then DP may 
be resumed with close follow up.  
 
• Grade [ADDRESS_74574]  
should be followed closely and if the AE does not return to Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_74575] be permanently discontinued.  
 
• Grade [ADDRESS_74576] the drug permanently 
discontinued, with clinical assessments and laboratory testing as 
described for Grade 3 toxicity. Subjects experiencing Grade 4 AEs 
should be followed closely with additional clinical assessments and 
laboratory testing as clinically indicated . 
 
7.1.3  Hypotension  
 
35 
 
  
 
• Grade 2 
 
 Subjects who develop a symptomatic hypotension that resolves with 
oral fluids (Grade 2) may continue study medication and will be 
instructed to maintain adequate hydration.  Recurrence of Grade 2 
hypotension should prompt consideration of discontinuation of study 
treatment.   
 
• Grade [ADDRESS_74577] study treatment permanently 
discontinued.  
 
7.1.4  Headache 
 
• Grade 1  
 
Subjects who develop Grade 1 headache may continue study 
medications.  
 
• Grade 2 
 
 Subjects who develop Grade 2 headache may continue study medication and may be treated with over the counter analgesics 
(acetaminophen preferred, NSAIDS should be avoided and may not be 
taken for > 3 consecutive days).   
 
• Grade [ADDRESS_74578] pregnant participants by [CONTACT_68393]/or obstetrical complications  during and at the end of 
pregnancy.  
 
36 
 
  
 
Pregnancies that occur on study should be reported to The Antiretroviral Pregnancy 
Registry. More information is available at www.apregistry.com . Phone: 800- 258-4263; 
Fax: 800- 800-1052. Intrapartum complications and/or pregnancy outcome will be

9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 General Design Issues  
 
This study is a randomized, placebo- controlled,  two- arm, single-site, pi[INVESTIGATOR_68342] 
37 
 
  
 
evaluate whether 12 weeks of treatment with DP , decreases markers of immune 
activation and systemic inflammation in HIV -1 infected subjects virally suppressed on 
ART. DP will be administered to subjects for up to 24 weeks. Follow -up continues to 
week 28. The targeted sample size will be 40 subjects  (20 of these subjects will be 
enrolled in the rectal tissue subset ). 
 
9.2 Endpoints  
 
9.2.1  Primary Endpoints  
 
• Change in Plasma level of  sCD14  from baseline to week 12.  
• Change in Plasma level of sCD163  and IL-6 from baseline to week 12.  
 
9.2.2  Secondary Endpoints  
  
• Changes from entry to week 12 and 24 (as applicable)  in the following:  
 
o %HLA -DR+ CD38 + expression in CD8+ and CD 4+ T-cells 
 
o %CD69+CD2 5+ expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells

o Purine and adenosine levels in blood  
 
o Plasma  HIV-1 RNA using single copy assay (SCA)   
 
o Cell-associated HIV -[ADDRESS_74580] -bronchodilator FEV 1 
 
9.3 Randomization and Stratification 
 
At study entry, subjects will be allocated at a 1:1 ratio to the two arms  using blocked 
randomization.  In addition, randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_398]4 cell count at 
screening (<50 0 cells/mm3 or ≥5 00 cells/mm3), and enrollment into  the rectal tissue 
subset .   
 9.4 Sample Size and Accrual  
 
There will be 40 subjects (20 per arm) randomized to either DP 100 mg 4 times daily or 
matching placebo, and it is assumed that no more than 10% of participants will be 
excluded from the primary analysis due to any reason.   sCD14 will be  the main primary 
outcome, while sCD163 and IL -[ADDRESS_74581] .  As a 
result, the hypothesis for sCD14 will be tested at the 5% significance level  and will be 
the basis for our power analysis.  sCD16 3 and IL -6 will also be tested at the 5% 
significance level  each.   Based on the assumption that none of the [ADDRESS_74582] 80% power to detect 
standardized mean difference of  0.909 between treatment arms for the  sCD14 . In terms 
of clinically meaningful effects, this translates to a difference of  0.49 x 10
6 pg/mL in 
sCD14  between arms at [ADDRESS_74583] deviation seen in 
preliminary data (standard deviation is 0.54 x 106 pg/mL for sCD14) .  In the more 
realistic situation that 10% of subjects are excluded (18 per arm), we will have 80% power to detect standardized mean difference of 0.961 between treatment arms for the 
primary outcome. In terms of clinically meaningful effects, this translates to a difference 
of 0.52 x 10
6 pg/mL in sCD14  between arms at [ADDRESS_74584] for baseline sCD14  as well as CD4 cell count 
(neither of which are expected to be related to treatment arm), it’s likely that there will be 
sufficient power to detect even smaller effects than what is expected.  
 It is anticipated that subjects will accrue to the study at a rate of [ADDRESS_74585] virologic  failure 
during this time period.  To preserve the study power in the case of greater than 10% 
missing data due to discontinuation/non- adherence, additional subjects  may enroll, at 
discretion of the protocol team, to replace subjects  who are discontinued o r non -
adherent to study product or scheduled study visits  prior to week 12 . Therefore the total 
sample size may exceed 4 0 at the end of the study.  
 
Changes from baseline to week 12 in sCD14, sCD163,  and IL- 6 (as well as all 
secondary and exploratory outcom es) will be summarized by [CONTACT_3163], medians, standard 
deviations, and 95% confidence intervals for each treatment arm.  We will compare the 
two study arms at baseline with respect to clinical characteristics as well as subject  
demographics.  Any baseline covariates that cause imbalance at the 5% significance 
level will be included in the primary analyses.   Our primary analysis will utilize an 
Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model of the primary outcomes, which compares the 
outcomes at 12 weeks between arms (pl acebo/DP) after adjusting for baseline activation 
(or plasma level) and CD4 cell count.  If any of the primary outcomes violate 
assumptions of normality, suitable transformations will be investigated.  If no 
transformation can be used, between- arm comparis ons on [ADDRESS_74586].  
 
Statistical significance for the primary analys is of sCD14  will be tested using a two- sided 
alpha = 0.05.  The other key  outcomes  of sCD163 and IL -[ADDRESS_74587] -bronchodilator FEV 1, 
and percent FMD (see 9.2.2 and 9.2.3)  will be summarized by [CONTACT_3163], medians, 
standard deviations, and 95% CIs for each of the treatment arms.  As in the primary analysis, between- arm comparisons will be made using either an ANCOVA model or the 
Wilcoxon rank sum test.  For secondary outcomes wi th more frequent measurements 
(i.e. baseline, 4, 12 week), longitudinal models such as Generalized Estimating 
Equations (GEE) will be used to compare the trajectories across time between treatment 
arms. Included in the model will be predictor variables for  week, treatment group, and 
their interaction.  
 
The study design allows for an additional 12 weeks of follow up in which the placebo arm 
crosses over to DP 100 mg 4 times daily for 12 weeks. As an exploratory measure, the 
trajectories of T cell activation and IL- 6 expression for these subjects will be analyzed 
using a generalized linear mixed model with covariates for week (defined as time since initiating placebo/DP), drug (placebo/DP), and their interaction. The effects of long- term 
and short -term DP on T cell activation will be quantified using an ANCOVA model, 
similar to the primary analysis.  
 
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_68397] ≥ 2 
adverse events within each study arm.  Comparisons between study arms will be done 
40 
 
  
 
using Fisher’s exact test at each study visit.  
 
Statistical significance for each of the secondary  analyses will be tested using the 
nominal 5% type I error rate.    
 
9.7 Monitoring 
 
Accrual and a summary of all Grade ≥ 2 signs and symptoms, all Grade ≥  2 laboratory 
abnormalities and all reported AEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_68398]. This 
summary will be pooled over the study arms. In addition, baseline characteristics as well 
as early study treatment and study discontinuations, pooled over study arms, will be 
reviewed regularly by [CONTACT_50783]. The Center for Research in Health Care Data Center 
(CRHC DC) will also prepare a quarterly report of all Grade ≥ 2 signs and symptoms, all Grade ≥ 2 laboratory abnormalities and reported AEs by [CONTACT_30157], to  be reviewed 
quarterly [or as requested] by [CONTACT_68399].  
 Approximately [ADDRESS_74588], (or, if earlier, when 50% of 
subjects have been enrolled), an interim review of the study will occur.   An Institutional 
Data Safety and M onitoring Board (IDSMB)  convened by [CONTACT_32928][INVESTIGATOR_68343] a Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) for the study and will review accrual, 
toxicity summaries, and off -treatment and off -study rates and re asons broken down by 
[CONTACT_68400]. In addition, longitudinal changes in CD4+ T -cell count and HIV -[ADDRESS_74589] IDSMB review will 
occur when 30% of the subjects are enrolled or at [ADDRESS_74590] review or at more frequent intervals as determined by [CONTACT_68401].  An interim IDSMB review may also be conducted if a reason 
is identified by [CONTACT_68402], study investigators, or study statistician in consultation with the team.  
 The specific responsibilities of the I DSMB are to:  
 
1. Review the research protocol, informed consent documents and plans for data and 
safety monitoring;  
2. Evaluate the progress of the study, including periodic assessments of data quality and 
timeliness, subject recruitment, accrual and retention, subject  risk versus benefit, 
adverse events, unantic ipated problems, performance of the trial site, and other 
factors that can affect study outcome;  
3. Consider factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, 
such as scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on t he safety 
of the subjects or the ethics of the study;  
4. Review clinical center performance, make recommendations and assist in the 
resolution of problems reported by [CONTACT_978] s; 
5. Protect the safety of the study subject s; 
6. Report on the safety and progress of the study;  
7. Make recommendations to the PI s concerning continuation, termination or other 
modifications of the study based on the observed beneficial or adverse effects of the treatment under study;  
41 
 
  
 
8. Monitor the confidentiality of the study data and the results of monitoring;  
9. Assist the PI s by [CONTACT_57018], enrollment, 
sample size and/or data collection.  
 
The IDSMB will include experts in infectious disease, immunology, and biostatistics.  
Members will consist of persons independent of the investigators who have no financial, 
scientific, or other conflict of interest with the study.  Written documentation attesting to 
absence of conflict of interest will be required.  
 
The University o f Pi[INVESTIGATOR_68344], Health Sciences will provide the 
logistical management and support of the IDSMB.  A safety officer (chairperson) will be 
identified at the first meeting.  This person will be the contact [CONTACT_68403].  Proc edures for this will be discussed at the first meeting.  
 
The first meeting will take place before initiation of the study to discuss the protocol, 
approve the commencement of the study, and to establish guidelines to monitor the 
study.  The follow -up meeti ng frequency of the I DSMB will be determined during the first 
meeting.  An emergency meeting of the IDSMB will be called at any time by [CONTACT_68404].

distribution forms, CRFs) and pertinent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68345], the site monitor, the NIAID, and the OHRP, or 
their designees  for confirmation of the study data.  
 
11.4 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting 
 
11.4.1  Reporting Requirements for this Study  
 
Requirements, definitions and methods for expedited reporting of Adverse Events (AEs) are outlined in Version 2.0 of the DAIDS EAE Manual, which is 
available on the RSC website:  
http://rsc.tech -
res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance  
 
All serious adverse events which are unexpected, fatal or life- threatening, and 
related or possibly related to the research intervention will be reported to the 
University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_68346] [ADDRESS_74592] 
be reported in an expedited manner are: congenital anomalies or abnormal pregnancy outcomes after week 20 of gestation, regardless of attribution to 
study agent(s).  
 All other adverse events that meet the IRB reporting requirements as per 
Section 11.5 will be reported to the IRB within 10 wor king days of the 
investigator learning of the event. All adverse events, regardless of relationship 
to the research intervention, will be reported to the IDSMB during regular 
reporting intervals (to be determined after the first initial meeting and depending 
upon risk).   
 
The study agent s for which expedited reporting are  required are: dipyridamole 
and placebo for dipyridamole.  
 
The DAIDS Medical Officer (MO) will receive a copy of all AEs submitted to the 
IRB in an expedited fashion.   In addition to the events described above, the 
[ADDRESS_74593] current Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and 
Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS AE Grading Table) is used and is available on 
the RSC website:  http://rsc.tech -res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance  
 
11.4.3 Expedited AE Reporting Period 
 
The expedited AE reporting period for this study will be from the time the participant starts study agent until the end of the study follow -up for that 
participant. .  After the protocol -defined AE reporting period, unless  otherwise 
noted, only S [LOCATION_003]Rs as defined in Version 2.0 of the EAE Manual, will be 
reported to the IRB and IDSMB  if the study staff become aware of the events on 
a passive basis (from publicly available information) . A copy of these reports will 
also be sent to the DAIDS Medical Officer.  
 11.5  Unanticipated Problems  
 
Unanticipated problems, as  defined by [CONTACT_68407], experience, or 
outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 
1.  Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
2.  Related or  possibly related to participation in the research (in this guidance 
document, “possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the 
incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_68408]); and  
3.  Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.  
 
Upon becoming aware of any AE, the investigator will assess whether the AE represents 
an unanticipated problem by [CONTACT_68409]. If the investigator 
determines that the AE represents an unanticipated problem, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_68347] [ADDRESS_74594] of this 
study that represent unanticipated problems but are not considered AEs may r equire 
reporting under the HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.103(a) and 46.103(b)(5). Further 
details and examples of such scenarios are described in the OHRP policy 
(http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html#Q1 ). Unanticipated problems involving 
risks to participants or others will be reported as detailed in the DAIDS Critical Event

12.3 Risk-Benefit Statement  
 
12.3.1  Risks  
 
Gener al  
Phlebotomy may lead to discomfort, feelings of dizziness or faintness, 
and/or bruising, swelling and/or infection.  Disclosure of STI status may cause sadness or depression in volunteers.  Participation in clinical 
research includes the risks of loss of confidentiality and discomfort with 
the personal nature of questions.   
 
Brachial Artery Flow -Mediated Dilation (FMD)  
Brachial artery FMD is a painless imaging test that has no known short or long-term risks. The test uses ultrasound and does not involve radiation 
exposure. The test may be mildly uncomfortable because a blood 
pressure cuff is applied tightly to the arm.    
 
 
Dipyridamole  
Adverse reactions at therapeutic doses are usually minimal and transient. On long -term use, initial side effects usually disappear. In two heart valve 
replacement trials, the following reactions were reported when DP  tablets 
were given with warfarin:  dizziness (13.6%), abdominal distress (6.1%), 
headache (2.3%), and rash (2.3%). Other reactions from uncontrolled 
studies include diarrhea, vomiting, flushing and pruritus. In addition, 
angina pectoris has been reported rarely and there have been rare 
reports of liver dysfunction. On those uncommon occasions when 
adverse reactions have been persistent or intolerable, they have ceased 
on withdrawal of the medication.  
 
When DP tablets were administered concomitantly with warfarin, bleeding 
was no greater in frequency or severity than that observed when warfarin 
was administered alone. In rare cases, increased bleeding during or after 
surgery has been observed.  
 
In post -marketing reporting experience, there have been rare reports of 
hypersensitivity reactions (such as rash, urticaria, severe bronchospasm, 
and angioedema), larynx edema, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, arthritis, 
nausea, dyspepsia, paresthesia, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, alopecia, 
cholelithiasis, hypotension, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], and tachycardia.  
 
Enema  
The main risk from having an enema is temporary discomfort , bloating 
and flatulence.    
 
Flexible Sigmoidoscopy  
46 
 
  
 
Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a commonly practiced medical procedure and 
the endoscopic procedures done in this trial will not involve any unusual 
risks or discomforts.  The risks associated with these procedures include 
mild discomfort and the feeling of having a “bloated stomach”.  Mild rectal 
irritation , urgency to move bowels , or hypotension  may also occur.  
 Endoscopic biopsies are painless, begin to heal within 2 hours, and are 
completely healed within 3- 5 days.  On extremely rare occasions, the 
endoscopic procedure or biopsies may lead to pain, infection (sepsis), 
bleeding or perforation of the gastrointesti nal tract.  Perforation secondary 
to mucosal biopsy occurs approximately once out of every 8,000 procedures.  If this extremely rare complication occurs, antibiotics and 
surgery to repair the tear may be necessary.  
 
Risk of bleeding due to DP: DP does not  appear to increase the risk of 
bleeding and the Standards of Practice Committee of the American 
Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy does not recommend 
discontinuation of the drug prior to low risk endoscopic procedures, 
including flexible sigmoidoscopy  with biopsy.  
Pre- and post -bronchodilator spi[INVESTIGATOR_68349] : 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_68350] a routine diagnostic procedure and involves a very low level 
of risk. A person ta king a lung function test may feel a sensation of 
dyspnea and cough, faintness or feeling of light -headedness. These 
sensations subside rather quickly after completing the testing. All lung 
function tests will be performed sitting down so as to protect against injury 
from falling. Albuterol is a well -tolerated bronchodilator to be inhaled 
during the lung function testing. Common side effects of albuterol include 
heart palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], increased heart rate, chest pain, sha kiness, 
nervousness, headache, dizziness, sore throat, and runny nose. Rarely, 
albuterol may cause an immediate hypersensitivity allergic reaction.  
 
12.3.[ADDRESS_74597] s will be  referred for treatment for any incidental 
findings detected during screening and other study -related examinations.   
 
12.4 Informed Consent Process  
 
It is the responsibility of the study site investigator to ensure that the Elements of 
Informed Consent (21 CFR 50.25, 45 CFR 46.116,  and ICH GCP 4.8.10) and 
Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA) guidelines are followed 
and documented in the source document file.  Written informed consent will be 
obtained from each study  subject  prior to  screening.  In obtaining and 
[ADDRESS_74598] document the informed consent process in 
accordance with the Requirements for Source Documentation in DAIDS Funded and/or Sponsored Clinical Trials available at:   
 (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/LabsAndR esources/resources/DAIDSClinRsrch/Docum
ents/sourcedocpolicy.pdf).     
 Subject s will be provided  with copi[INVESTIGATOR_68351].  The informed consent process will cover all elements of informed consent requir ed by [CONTACT_18125].  In addition, the process will 
specifically address the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_68352]:  
 
• The unknown safety and unproven efficacy of the study products  
• The importance of adherence to the study visit and procedures schedule  
• The potential medical risks of study participation (and what to do if such risks 
are experienced)  
• The real yet limited benefits of study participation  
• The distinction between res earch and clinical care  
• The right to withdraw from the study at any time  
 
The informed consent process will include an assessment of each potential subject ’s 
understanding prior to enrollment and randomization of concepts identified by [CONTACT_68411].  Subject s who are not 
able to demonstrate adequate understanding of key concepts after exhaustive 
educational efforts will not be enrolled in the study.  
 
If during the trial a consent revision where new information that might affect the 
research subject ’s willingness  to participate is presented, subject s will be informed of 
the revisions.  If a research subject  terminates the study and consent form revision 
occurs after their participation has ended, they do not need to sign the revised consent form.  
 12.[ADDRESS_74599] s’ study information 
48 
 
  
 
will not be released without their written permission,  except as necessary for 
review, monitoring, and/or auditing by:  
 
• Representatives of the US Federal Government, including  the US OHRP, NIH, and/or contractors of the NIH  
• University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_68353] , Inc. will have access to 
limited identifiable information ( including first and last name, date of birth, gender, 
and m edical record number) for the purpose of analyzing biological samples 
obtained for this research study .  Subjects who decline to allow this  use of 
identifiers will have samples sent to QUEST using only a coded number .

potential will be required to be currently using a reliable method of 
contraception as outlined in the inclusion criteria.  
 
12.6.2 Children  
 
The NIH has mandated that children be included in research trials when appropriate.  This study meets Justifications for Exclusion criteria for 
younger children as set forth by [CONTACT_18121].  Specifical ly, “insufficient data 
are available in adults to judge potential risk in children” and “children 
should not be the initial group to be involved in research studies.”  This 
study does not plan to enroll children or adolescents under [ADDRESS_74601] s will be compensated for their time and effort in 
this study, and/or be reimbur sed for travel to study visits and time away from 
work according to standard practice at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] .  
Reimbursement  amounts will be specified in the informed consent form.

 Professional Continuous Glucose Monitoring Before Starting Insulin Pump 
Therapy  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_328865], MD  
 
1.0 BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS  
 
Frequent blood glucose monitoring is the cornerstone of intensive diabetes management, and 
has been shown to decrease long -term complications of diabetes (1,2). Continue glucose 
monitoring has been a promising technology, providing patients and physicians with 
additional blood glucos e data and a more detailed and accurate look at glycemic trends 
throughout the day, than can be achieved with SMBG alone, which may miss post -prandial 
and nocturnal variability  (3-7). Continuous  glucose monitors (CGM) can be divided into two 
groups: retrospective CGM and real -time CGM. Retrospective CGM devices are owned by 
[CONTACT_321150] (i.e. iPro Professional CGM), and allow for blood glucose data to be 
collected over [ADDRESS_406211] effective when 
worn  consistently  (7,8).  
 
The insulin pump has been a useful vehicle to manage glycemic variation throughout the day. 
With the ability to titrate insulin doses to glycemic demand, insulin pump therapy has been 
shown to improve glycemic control and decrease hypoglycemic events, when compared to 
multiple daily injections ( MDI ) alone  (9,10). Insulin pumps are now integrated with real -time 
CGM technology, which has improved glycemic control with consistent use  (7,11). Sensor -
augmented pump (SAP)  therap y has demonstrated reductions in HbA1c and decreased 
glycemic variability  (7,11). Though, one of the major limitations found with SAP is that it 
must be used consistently by [CONTACT_328873] A1c  (8,12).  Furthermore , patients are infrequentl y started on both insulin pump 
and real -time CGM at the same time, due to  the degree of training required to master two 
technologic devices. However, retrospective CGM data may be used to capture glycemic 
patterns, without the need for extensive education or training for the patient.  
 
It has been the experience at our institution that patients are rarely started on both insulin 
pump and CGM simultaneously, primarily because learning two devices can be 
overwhelming for families.  If a CGM is desired, the sens or is typi[INVESTIGATOR_328866] [ADDRESS_406212] tried to identify v ariations in insulin requirements throughout the day  (13-
15), as well as variations based on age and pubertal stage  (16). From these studies, as well as 
clinical experience, physicians understand that most children on pump therapy need less total 
daily insulin and higher basal rates in the early morning. These studies have provided a 
1/8/201 6 
2 
 general knowledge for initial insulin pu mp doses. However, an individualized regimen that 
provides tight glycemic control does not evolve until later, after many dose adjustments.  
 
Though there has been much research looking at glycemic control when CGM is used with 
pump, there is little researc h looking at the utility of using CGM prior to initiation of insulin 
pump therapy.  CGM has been used as a tool to monitor variations in blood glucose during 
the initiation of pump therapy  (17,18), but not yet studied as means to tailor initial insulin 
pump doses.  
 
We hypothesize that using retrospective CGM data in youth  with type  [ADDRESS_406213].

180 mg/dL)  
2.2 Secondary Objectives:  
- To determine whether the use of retrospective CGM data to inform starting doses 
prior to insulin pump initiation will improve secondary outcomes:  
o Other measures of glycemic variability:

3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 
This is a randomized controlled study of the use of continuous glucose monitoring  prior 
to insulin pump initiation in childre n with type 1 diabetes mellitus.  
 
3.1 Participant  Recruitment  
- Participants with type 1 diabetes from Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7723] (CHLA), 
who have been referred by [CONTACT_328874] i nsulin 
pump therapy will be approached to participate in the study . 
- Recruitment  would be in person or by [CONTACT_328875]. Nurses will receive referral, and contact [CONTACT_1697]. 
Investigator will contact [CONTACT_328876].  
- Recruitment will take place in the CHLA Endocrinology and Diabetes clinic, at 
CHLA, Los Angeles, [LOCATION_004].  
3.1.[ADDRESS_406214].  In general, to qualify for pump therapy, patients need 
to be testing blood glucoses levels 4 -6 times daily, come consistently to 
scheduled follow -up appointments, and be willing to participate in 
comprehensive diabetes education.  
 
3.2 Inclusion/E xclusion Criteria  
- Listed in section 5.0.  
 
3.3 Consent:  
- Written consent will be  obtained  from the participant or participant’s  parent (s) or 
guardian (s). Written assent will be obtained from the participant if less than [ADDRESS_406215] 7 years of a ge. Consent  and assent  will be obtained by 
[CONTACT_34351].  
 
3.4 Securing Participant Identity  
- All participants  will be assigned a sequential study identification  (ID) number  in 
the order of enrollment . The key linking study identification number to patient’s 
identifying information will be kept in a separate and secure location, and only be 
accessible to the investigator. All documents and data collection will use only the 
study identification number.  
 
3.5 Randomization  
1/8/[ADDRESS_406216] insulin start using our clinic’s protocol.  
- See section 6.3 for details of randomization process.  
 
3.6 Study Procedures  
3.6.1 Initial visit – approximately 2±[ADDRESS_406217] approximately 45 
minutes.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Baseline characteristics will be collected on all participants 
enrolled by [CONTACT_328877]/or by [CONTACT_328878]/parent.  A baseline 
physical exam will be performed.  
- See section 6.2 for details.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  All participants  will have an iPro®2 (Medtronic MiniMed Inc., 
Northridge, CA, U SA) placed by [CONTACT_125078] a trained nurse  in 
the CHLA diabetes clinic .  The iPro®[ADDRESS_406218] baseline data and 
glycemic trends on all participants.   
- Participants will be provided with log sheets (“CGM Participant 
Log Sheet”) and they will be in structed to check and  record blood 
glucose levels a minimum of four times a day (before meals and 
before bed), as well as record carbohydrate intake and significant 
activity or exercise.   
- Participants  will wear the  iPro®2 for 5 days.  
- The iPro®2 and log-sheets  will then be mailed back to the 
investigator  in a pre -paid envelop.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Appointments for all future clinic encounters associated with the study 
will be made during the initial visit.  
 
3.6.[ADDRESS_406219] insulin doses determined by “standard practice.” 
Standard practice for pump initiation in the CHLA clinic involv es the 
following: 1 -2 weeks prior to the scheduled pump class, the participant’s  
latest blood glucose log is reviewed by [CONTACT_2299]’s  diabetes nurse. A 
worksheet (“CGM Pump Dose Worksheet”) is then filled out by [CONTACT_46566], 
which includes insulin daily  totals (total rapid -acting insulin/day, total basal 
insulin/day, total daily dose (TDD), and total units of insulin/kilogram/day) 
and insulin pump calculations, including recognition of the honeymoon 
phase, the stage of puberty, the dawn phenomenon, and/o r specific trends in 
high or low blood glucoses. In general, the total basal dose is reduced by 10 -
20% of the current dose, with the use of multiple basal rates being at the 
discretion of the provider. In general, the correction scale is calculated by 
[CONTACT_60875] 1800 by [CONTACT_328879], and the insulin to carbohydrate ratio is 
1/8/201 6 
5 
 calculated by [CONTACT_60875] 450 by [CONTACT_328879]. The proposed starting insulin 
regimen is reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_2299]’s  primary 
endocrinologist  
- For those participants  randomized to have “inf ormed” starting insulin pump 
doses  (study group) , the iPro®2 data will be made available only to the nurse 
or physician responsible for determining starting insulin pump doses , so that  
further dose adjustments  may be made . 
- For participants  randomized to “s tandard practice”  (control group) , iPro®[ADDRESS_406220] a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) collected. HbA1c 
will be determined by [CONTACT_328880] (Siemens, Malvern, PA).  
3. Participants will be instructed to perform blood glucose checks 
(capi[INVESTIGATOR_293215] -stick on home m eter) at least 6 -8 times per day, 
including before meals, at bedtime, midnight and 3 a.m. Participants 
will be instructed to use the pump bolus calculator when giving an 
insulin bolus for correction and/or carbohydrates and to give insulin 
before eating.  Participants  will be instructed to keep a written log  of 
blood glucose results, carbohydrates consumed, and insulin units given.  
B. RESEARCH PROCEDURES  
1. All participants will have the iPro2 placed by [CONTACT_328881] e immediate period of transition to insulin 
pump. The device will be worn for 5 days and then mailed back to the 
investigator in a pre -paid envelope. Data will be downloaded and kept 
blinded and secure until data analysis is performed.  
2. Participants will  be instructed to keep a written log ("CGM Participant 
Log Sheet") of blood glucose results, carbohydrates consumed, and 
insulin units given.  
 
3.6.[ADDRESS_406221] 
been previously involved with the initial dose determination and thus will 
remain blinded to the participant’s study group desig nation.  Participants  
may also call at additional times, as needed. Insulin pump doses may be 
adjusted as needed, per routine, by [CONTACT_328882]/or physicians.   
1/8/[ADDRESS_406222], and the frequency, type of adjustments made, and ease of the phone 
call will be documented in a written log  (“CGM Telephone Call Log” ). 
 
3.6.[ADDRESS_406223] OF CARE PROCEDURES  
1. All participants will attend a standardized advanced pump class, which 
will occur approximately 6±[ADDRESS_406224] a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) collected.  
 
B. RESEARCH PROCEDURES   
1. All participants/their parents will be asked to complete a follow -up 
questionnaire (“Follow -up Participant/Parent Questionnaire”).  This 
questionnaire will take approximately 10 minutes to complete and will 
be administered at the end of the class. The questionnaire consists of 10 
questions , whi ch will ask about brand of insulin pump, number of blood 
glucose checks per day, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3414] (defined by [CONTACT_328883][INVESTIGATOR_063]), epi[INVESTIGATOR_116651] (defined 
by [CONTACT_61593], coma, or seizure), and 6 questions regarding 
participant/parent satisfaction with the transition to insulin pump.  
2. All participants will have the iPro2 placed by [CONTACT_328884] [ADDRESS_406225] a follow up visit with their primary 
endocrinologists 3 months (± 2 weeks) after starting on insulin pump 
therapy.  
2. All participants will have a hemoglobin A1C collected.  
 
B. RESEARCH PROCEDURES  
1. A brief, three question survey ("Provider Post -study Survey") will be 
given to diabetes nurses and physicians who were inv olved in using the 
CGM data to write initial insulin pump doses.  An information sheet 
will be provided and verbal consent will be obtained.  This survey will 
be distributed after all participants have completed the study. The 
survey will take approximately [ADDRESS_406226] retention:  
 
This s tudy is of short duration, [ADDRESS_406227] clinic visits for all patients who start insulin pump therapy (initial pump 
class, advanced pump class, and regular follow up with endocrinologist) . This should 
1/8/[ADDRESS_406228] to follow up.  Participants will also be 
compensated with a $[ADDRESS_406229] at the 3 visits that an iPro2  is placed (Initial Visit,

o Primary Outcome:  
• Percentage time within target BG  
▪ Target BG: 70 -180 mg/dL  
▪ The time spent with in the target BG ranges indicated glycemic 
stability and adequate insulin dosing. Persistent blood glucose 
readings above or below this target range would necessitate a change 
in insulin pump doses. The goal of this study is to minimized 
glycemic variabili ty and frequency of insulin pump dose 
adjustments.  
• The following data will be collected by [CONTACT_328885]®2 (Medtronic Minimed, 
Inc., Northridge, CA, [LOCATION_003]). This is a retrospective continuous 
glucose monitor, which will be placed per device instructions in the 
CHLA diabetes clinic by [CONTACT_093], be worn for [ADDRESS_406230] data over 
that time period. This is an FDA approved device. Data will be 
collected via  iPro®2 and downloaded at three times points , once prior 
to pump start, one week after pump start, and again 6 weeks after 
pump start.  
 
o Secondary Outcomes:  
• Other measures of glycemic variability. Data will also be collected 
by [CONTACT_328885]®2 at three points in time, baseline, one week, and six weeks.  
▪ Mean blood glucose (BG), BG standard deviation  
▪ Mean Amplitude of Glycemic Excursion  
• Insulin Doses: The following data will be collected at two time 
points, 6 weeks apart. Data will be collected o nce prior to pump start 
and will be based on current parental report. Data will be collected a 
second time 6 weeks after pump start, and will be collected from 
data d ownloaded from the insulin pump.  
▪ Total daily insulin dose (TDD)  
▪ Percentage  basal insulin  
• Changes to Insulin Doses: The following data will be collected over 
the 6 weeks following pump initiation. Data will be collected on 
standardized printed logs  (“CGM Telephone Call Log” ), by a 
diabetes nurse.

 ▪ Total number of insulin dose adjustments  
▪ Total nu mber of phone calls to clinic hotline  
▪ The number of insulin dose adjustments made per phone call  
• Adverse Effects: The following data will be collected over the 6 
weeks following pump initiation. Data will be collected by [CONTACT_328886]/or review of medical record and documented on 
source document  (“CGM Participant Source Document” ): 
▪ Epi[INVESTIGATOR_116651] (loss of consciousness, seizure, 
coma)  
▪ Epi[INVESTIGATOR_171648] (pH < 7.3, Bicarbonate < 15, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063])  
• Glycemic Control : 
▪ Hemoglobin A1c collected at pump start, the advanced pump 
class at 6±1 weeks , and the 3 -month follow visit at 3 months  ±2 
weeks.  
• Patient/parent satisfaction: The following data will be collected via 
survey  (Participant/Parent Questionnaire ) given to 
patients/ parents /guardians  at the end of the advanced pump class. 
The survey will use a Likert Scale (strongly agree, agree, neutral, 
disagree, strongly disagree) to respond to six questions addressing 
patient/parent impressions of the process of transitioning  to insulin 
pump therapy.  
• Nursing/physician Satisfaction: Data will be collected via the 
“Provider Post -study Survey,” which will be completed by [CONTACT_328887]. 
Survey will be three questions, which  will address utility and 
feasibility of using CGM data to write pump doses.

8.0 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS  
8.1 Study Endpoint  
The three -month follow -up visit with the participant’s primary endocrinologist 
will be the final visit of the study, after which no additional participation in the 
study will be required.  Total duration of participation not to exceed [ADDRESS_406237] completed the study; 
specifically, all devices have been returned and uploaded, and all [ADDRESS_406238] been completed.  
 
9.0 DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING  
9.1 Data Handling  
 
Data collection for this study will be captured using paper Case Report Forms 
(CRF).  
 
iPro®2, glucometer, and insulin pump data will be collected via device download.  
The iPro®2 data will be downloaded using Medtron ic MiniMed CareLink 
Clinical. This system uses Secure Sockets Layers (SSL) technology, whi ch 
encrypts all data it stores.  Glucometer and insulin pump data will be downloaded 
using the approved software for each device.  
 
All data will be manually entered by  [CONTACT_199101] a password -protected, 
secure database. Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010; 
Microsoft Corporation) will be used.  
 
The investigator will ensure that all CFRs are completed and entered into the 
database prompt ly, completely, and accurately.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_406239] o f care is the difference in pre/post change in mean percent time 
within target blood glucose range between the two groups.  A sample size of 40 
1/8/201 6 
12 
 participants will be enrolled and randomly allocated to the two groups.  Assuming a 20% 
dropout rate, a sample s ize of 16 per group will achieve the desired power of 80% to 
detect a 10% difference between groups, which corresponds to an effect size of 0.918.   A 
significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_406240] materials will include sharps from the sensor insertion. Universal precautions 
will be followed at all times. All sharps will be disposed of in a sharps container. iPro®[ADDRESS_406241] Bill of 
Rights, Participant Information Sheets, and any form of participant recruitment 
information relating to the  study will be approved by [CONTACT_22846]. The 
study will not start until IRB approval has been granted.  
 
12.2 Informed Consent/Assent  
Informed consent/assent will be obtained. Prior to entry into the study, the 
investigator will explain the purpose and du ration of the study, requirements of 
the participant during the study, as well as potential risks involved with 
participation in this study. The IRB -approved written Informed Consent 
form/Assent form will be given to the participant/parent/guardian to read . The 
HIPAA Authorization will be also be given to the participant/parent/guardian. 
Participants/parents/guardians will be informed that the participation is voluntary. 
After all the subject’s/parent’s/guardian’s questions have been answered, and if 
partic ipation in the study is desired, they will sign and date the Informed Consent, 
Assent, HIPAA Authorization, and [LOCATION_004] Experimental Subject Bill of 
Rights. Only after these documents have been properly completed can the study 
procedures commence. The c onsenting process will be documented in the 
participant’s study file. A copy of the signed Informed Consent, Assent, HIPAA 
Authorization, and [LOCATION_004] Experimental Subject Bill of Rights will be 
provided to the subject/parent/guardian.  
1/8/[ADDRESS_406242] studies with continuous glucose monitoring 
were relatively rare. Usually side effects occurred with the glucose sensor and 
were often limited to reactions at the site of insertion on the skin, or related to 
adhesive tapes  used to secure the device. These potential adverse effects include:  
 
o Skin irritation  
o Bruising  
o Redness  
o Bleeding  
o Discomfort  
o Tenderness  
o Pain 
o Rash  
o Infection  
o Irritation from tapes  
o Feeling faint or syncope with sensor insertion  
 
The possibility of infection is minimized by [CONTACT_328891]. 
An insertion device (Sen -Serter) will be used to insert the sensor, which will 
ensure correct sensor placement and minimize discomfort.  
 
There is potential for adverse effects of hypo -/hyperg lycemia related to the 
disease state of diabetes . A telephone number will be provided to all participants, 
which will be staffed 24 hours daily by a diabetes nurse or diabetes/endocrine 
physician. Participants will be calling this number daily for the firs t 4 days, and 
then weekly, to report blood glucose numbers, so insulin dose adjustments can be 
made before significant epi[INVESTIGATOR_328869] -/hyperglycemia occur. Participants may 
also call this number as needed for any additional concerns.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_406243] benefit to the participant, but possible benefits of the 
participant electing to participate in the study include, but are not limited to:  
 
o Possible reduction in glycemic variability, swings in blood glucose values  
o Possible reduction in freq uency of insulin pump dose adjustments  
o Possible reduction in hypo -/hyperglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_328870].

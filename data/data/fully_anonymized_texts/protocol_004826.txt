 SYNOPSIS  
 
 
Protocol  Title:  Effects  of NOV03  on the Tear Film  in Subjects  with Dry Eye 
Disease  
Protocol  Number:  [ADDRESS_1128951]:  Perfluorohexyloctane  (PFHO;  MIEBO ™; NOV03)  
Study  Phase:  4 
 
Primary  Objective(s):  Determine the effect of a single instillation of PFHO on the 
thickness  and evaporation  rate of the mucus -aqueous  layer  of 
the tear film  
 
Exploratory  Objective(s):   
 
Overall  Study  Design:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Structure:  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], open label, single -arm, single -center study will 
consist of 2 study visits in subjects with dry eye disease 
associated with MGD.  A Screening Visit will occur to verify 
subjects are eligible to participate followed by [CONTACT_815397]. 4 hours following a single instillation of PFHO.  
Screening Visit: At Visit 1, the subjects will complete the 
informed consent process followed by a screening visit to 
determine  the presence  of dry eye and associated  MGD,  which 
will include slit -lamp exam, visual acuity (VA), intraocular 
pressure (IOP), meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) 
assessment, Schirmer test, tear film break up time (TFBUT), 
corneal fluorescein staining (CFS), and ocular surface dise ase 
index (OSDI).  
Assessment  Visit:  At Visit  2, a slit lamp  examination  and two 
baseline tear film assessments will be performed (tear film 
parameters: mucus -aqueous  layer thickness  (MALT);  mucus - 
aqueous  thinning  rate (MALTR);   
 
 Then 1 
drop of PFHO will be instilled into both eyes (the study eye 
will be the eye with the highest corneal fluorescein stainin g). 
The above assessments will be repeated at multiple time 
points up to [ADDRESS_1128952] -instillation (time points: 5±1 min, 
15±2 min, 30±2 min, 60±5 min, 120±10 min, 240±10 min).  
Any adverse  events  will be recorded.

Full Analysis  Set (FAS):  The FAS will consist of  all enrolled subjects  who are instilled with  study drug 
Per Protocol  Set (PP Set):  The PP Set will consist  of FAS  subjects  with no protocol  violations  expected 
to affect the evaluability of efficacy.  
Safety  Analysis  
The number and percentage of subjects with specific treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will 
be summarized  for each treatment  group.  The number of  subjects  will be tabulated  by [CONTACT_815398].  
 
Primary  Efficacy  Analyses  
 
The primary comparison in this trial is CFB in MALTR and MALT following a single instillation of 
PFHO. Change from baseline (post -instillation minus baseline, average of 2 baseline readings) at each 
post instillation time point will be summarized using con tinuous summary statistics.  
 
Hypotheses  
For each primary endpoint at each post -instillation timepoint, the null hypothesis is that the mean 
change  from  baseline  is zero.  The alternative  hypothesis  is that the mean  change  from  baseline  is not 
zero.  
 
Methods  
Each primary endpoint will be summarized by [CONTACT_447] -instillation timepoint using continuous summary 
statistics for the FAS. Paired t -tests will be used to test the statistical hypotheses. Each null hypothesis 
will be rejected if the corresponding two -sided p -value is less than 0.05.  
Sample  Size Calculations  
A sample size of [ADDRESS_1128960] 80% power to detect a difference in means of 0.[ADDRESS_1128961] with a 5% two-sided  significance  level.

 1 INTRODUCTION  
Dry eye disease  (DED)  is a common  ocular condition  with approx. 18  million  currently  diagnosed  with the 
disease in the US, and  with many  more people  remaining undiagnosed (Farrand, et al. 2017; MarketScope 
2020). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_815380], tear film instability, and ocular surface 
damage with associated symptoms of dryness, grittiness, burning, stinging, light sensitivity, and blurred 
vision (Bartlett, et al. 2015; Craig, et al. 2017).  Previously, DED was charac terized into 2 main types, 
aqueous  deficient  (in which  lacrimal  secretion  is reduced) or evaporative  (in which  evaporation  of aqueous 
from the  tear film is excessive) (Bron, et  al. 2017;  Craig, et al. 2017).  It is now  recognized that DED  is on 
a continuum and that the most common cause of the disease is excessive evaporation due to conditions 
such as meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), a reduced blink rate (for example due to long -term use of 
digital displays), certain drugs, contact [CONTACT_13293] u se, and some eyelid disorders (Craig, et al. 2017).  The most 
common cause of evaporative DED is MGD, which is present in approx. 9 out of 10 patients with the 
disease (Lemp, et al. 2012;  Rabensteiner, et al. 2018; Badian, et al. 2021).  MGD results in  thinn ing of the 
tear film lipid layer leading to excessive evaporation of the underlying aqueous layer and associated tear 
film instability, hyperosmolarity, desiccation stress, and loss of mucin -producing goblet cells, which all 
cascade into a continuing cycle  of inflammation and ocular surface damage (Baudouin, et al. 2016; Craig, 
et al. 2017).  
 
Current  prescription  DED  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_815381], namely excessive evaporation.  Perfluorohexyloctane 
ophthalmic solution (PFHO; trade name [CONTACT_815420] ™; development name [CONTACT_657746]03) is an FDA approved, 
water -free, non -steroidal, preservative -free eye drop indicated for treatment of the signs and symptoms of 
DED.  PFHO belon gs to a unique class of compounds known as semifluorinated alkanes which have low 
surface tension and amphiphilic properties due to a lipophobic/aerophilic fluorinated segment and a 
lipophilic hydrocarbon segment (Meinert and Roy 2000).  PFHO is thought to act as a functional 
replacement for the lipid layer by [CONTACT_815399][INVESTIGATOR_815382] a long -lasting , anti- 
evaporative barrier (Agarwal, et al. 2018; Krosser 2018; Borchman 2022).  Therefore, PFHO may prevent 
excessive evaporation of the  aqueous component of the tear film in patients with evaporative DED, thus 
reducing the signs and symptoms of DED as has been consistently demonstrated in both a Phase 2 study 
and 2 Phase 3 clinical studies (Tauber, et al. 2021; Sheppard 2022; Tauber, et a l. 2022).  
 
To date, the effect of PFHO on inhibiting evaporation in vivo has not been demonstrated and there is 
limited available information regarding how PFHO modulates the lipid and aqueous tear film layers; in 
addition, demonstration of inhibition of evaporation by [CONTACT_815400].  The 
Tear Film Imager  (AdOM,  Advanced  Optical  Technologies  Ltd, Lod, Israel)  combines  spectrometry  and 
imaging to quantitatively assess changes in the tear lipid and aqueous layers with nanometer resolution. 
There are 6 tear film parameters which are measured simultaneous ly with the TFI:  
 
1. MALT:  the average  Muco -Aqueous  Layer Thickness  in nanometer  resolution  
2. MALTR:  the rate of change  of the  MALT value  in nm/sec, as  measured  in the steady  state phase  of 
a representative blink  
3. LLT:  the average  Lipid  Layer  Thickness  in nanometer  resolution  
4. LBUT:  the Lipid Break Up  Time  (in sec)  which  strongly correlates  to tear breakup  time 
5. IBI: the average  Inter -Blink -Interval  (in sec). 
6. LMU:  the average  Lipid  Map Uniformity  measured  on the Lipid  map taken  about  1 second  after the 
blink which allows quantitation of the spatial variation of lipid across the cornea.

Oct 16th [ADDRESS_1128970] been published which evaluated tear film parameters with the TFI.  Cohen et al  used 
the TFI to demonstrate  that the  distribution  of lipid in eyes  with DED  is nonuniform  and has  more  variance 
over the corneal surface as compared to normal eyes and hypothesized that this nonuniformity may be the 
cause of increased evaporation of  the aqueous  tear film layer  in DED  (Cohen, et al. 2020).  In addition, the 
parameters of MALT and LBUT have been shown to be significantly thinner and shorter, respectively, in 
patients with DED vs controls (Segev, et al. 2020).  Data from a recent study has also demonstrated 
correlation of specific tear film paramet ers with certain DED symptoms and/or signs (Arita, et al. 2022).  
Lastly, unpublished  pi[INVESTIGATOR_815383] a subject with evaporative DED.  
 
[ADDRESS_1128971] the  hypotheses (twelve) that the  effects of  a single instillation  of PFHO in 
the study eye  on the  thickness  and evaporation rate  of the  mucus -aqueous  layer of the  tear film at six  time 
points between 5 minutes and 4 -hours ( 5±1 min, 15±2 min, 30±2 min, 60±5 min, 120±10 min, 240±10 
min) after instillation are nominally statistically significant in adults with established currently untreated 
bilateral  dry eye disease  associated  with meibomian  gland  dysfunction  who are not recen t users  of contact 
[CONTACT_815401].  
 
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1128972]  of 2 study  visits:  a Screening  Visit  to verify  subjects  are eligible  to participate  and an 
Assessment study visit to evaluate tear film parameters at baseline and over approx. 4 hours following a 
single instillation of PFHO (Figure 1).  
At Visit  1, the subjects  will complete  the informed  consent  process  followed  by a screening  visit to determi ne 
the presence of dry eye and associated MGD, which will include slit -lamp exam, visual acuity (VA), IOP, 
MGD  assessment, Schirmer  test, TBUT,  CFS,  OSDI.  At Visit  2, a slit lamp  examination  will be performed. 
After  20 min, a baseline  examination  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_746]  a Tear Film  Imager  assessment  in the 
study eye (tear film parameters measured twice 20 -40 min apart; study eye = worst CFS eye at baseline). 
The study eye drop will  then be applied to both  eyes. Tear film imager assessments will then be performed 
in the study eye at multiple time points up to [ADDRESS_1128973] -instillation as shown in Figure 1.

9 ADVERSE  EVENTS  
 Definition of Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse  event  is any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a subje ct participating  in a clinical  study,  which 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study product/procedure.  Therefore, an adverse 
event includes:  
• Any unfavorable  and/or  unintended  sign (including  an abnormal  laboratory  finding),  symptom, or 
disease onset, that occurs at any time between the signing of the ICF and study exit, without any 
judgement about causality (i.e., whether or not it is considered to be  related to the study product)  
• Exacerbation,  worsening,  or progression  of a pre-existing  illness,  including  an increase  in severity, 
frequency, and/or duration of a pre -existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_3756]  
• Events occurring from drug overdose (accidental or intentional), drug abuse or misuse, drug 
hypersensitivity,  drug extravasati on, drug interactions,  drug dependency,  events  occurring  from 
drug withdrawal and medication errors  
• A condition  detected  or diagnosed  after study  product  administration  even though  it may have  been 
present prior to the start of the study  
A treatment -emergent  adverse  event  (TEAE) is  defined  as an AE with  a start date on or after the  first dose 
of study drug, or that worsened following administration of study drug.  
An AE does not include the  following:  

NOV03  (Perfluorohexyloctane) 
Clinical Trial Protocol #922  Sponsor:  Bausch  & Lomb  Incorporated 
Oct 16th 2023 FINAL v3.0  
Confidential  
Page 25 of 47  
 • Medical  or surgical  procedures  (e.g.,  surgery,  endoscopy,  tooth  extraction,  transfusion)  as event 
terms; the condition that led to the procedure is the AE if it meets the definition of an AE.  
•  Situations  where  an untoward  medical  occurrence  has not occurred  (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815391]; and social and/or convenience admiss ions).  
Symptoms  associated  with disease,  which  are consistent  with the subject’s  usual  clinical  course;  unless  the 
subject experiences worsening of their symptom(s) or the symptom(s) meet the criteria for an SAE.  
 
9.1.1 Assessment  of Severity  of Adverse  Events  
The severity of an AE will be graded as follows:  
Mild  Awareness of a sign or symptom but is easily tolerated, 
requires  no treatment,  and does not interfere  with subject’s 
daily activities  
Moderate  Low level  of concern  to the subject  and may interfere  with 
daily activities but can be relieved by [CONTACT_815405].  
Severe  Interrupts  the subject’s  daily  activity  and requires 
systemic therapy or other treatment  
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_1128991]  will be assessed  using  the following  guidelines, based  upon 
available information:  
 
Related  There  is at least a reasonable  possibility  that the AE/SAE 
is related  to the study  drug.  Reasonable  possibility  means 
that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the AE.  
Not Related  There is little or no reasonable possibility that the 
AE/SAE  is related  to the study  drug.  This assessment 
implies that the AE/SAE has little or no temporal 
relationship to the  study drug  and/or a  more  likely  or 
certain alternative etiology exists.  
 
Rationale  MUST be  provided  for any “not related”  assessment  and is recommended  for “related” 
assessments.  
 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE  is considered “serious”  if it meets  at least one  of the following  criteria.  The event:  
• Results  in death

Clinical Trial Protocol #922  Sponsor:  Bausch  & Lomb  Incorporated 
Oct 16th 2023 FINAL v3.0  
Confidential  
Page 26 of 47  
 • Is life threatening (places  the subject at  immediate  risk of  death)  
NOTE:  The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject 
was at risk of death  at the time of the  event.  It does not refer  to an event  which  hypothetically  might  have 
caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85264]:  The term 
“hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189294] -patient for more than 24 hours. 
Therefore,  an adverse  event  would  meet  the SAE  criterion  of “requires  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”  only if the 
event necessitated admission to a health care facility for longer than [ADDRESS_1128992] i n the 
study, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815392]  (even if  related to an  AE), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_815393], and admission to a day -care facility may not constitute 
sufficient grounds to be considered an SAE.  
Cases in which subjects are retained in the emergency room for more than 24 hours but not 
admitted  for medical  care should  be evaluated  individually,  because  the criterion  “otherwise 
medically significant” may apply (see below).  
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  
NOTE: The term “disability” means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance (e.g., uncomp licated headache, influenza, or sprained ankle) that may transiently 
interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is considered otherwise medically significant, as determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_458830] - 
investigator  
NOTE:  The term “medically  significant”  refers  to important  medical  events  that may not immediately 
be life threatening  or result  in death  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  but, based  upon  appropriate  medical  judgment, 
they jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the definition of an SAE.  
Examples of such medically significant events in clude allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Spontaneous  abortion,  elective  abortion  and ectopic  pregnancy  will be considered  SAEs  and must  be reported 
to the sponsor within 24 hours of awareness of the event.  
Subjects  will be withdrawn  from  the study  if an SAE  is identified  and thought  to be related  to the study  drug. 
The investigator is responsible for the reporting of all SAEs.  
Within  24 hours  following  the investigator’s  knowledge  of an SAE,  the investigator  must:  
• Report  the SAE  to the sponsor/designee.  
All SAEs occurring between screening and [ADDRESS_1128993] administered dose of study drug 
(inclusive) must be reported to the sponsor/designee, independent of the circumstance or suspected 
cause, and  regardless  of the  relationship  to the study  drug or protocol,  within  [ADDRESS_1128994] application  of study  drug,  or for any timeframe  greater  than 30 days deemed  medically

Oct 16th [ADDRESS_1128995] dies during participation in the study or during recognized follow -up period, and if 
cause of death is not available within the 24 -hour r eporting period, “death” must be reported as an

up report.

subject number) are  clearly visible  on every page/copy of source  document  provided  to the  sponsor. 
For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges.  
• Investigators  should  not wait to receive  additional  information  before  notifying  the sponsor of  an 
SAE.  If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are require d. 
Within  48 hours  following  the investigator’s  knowledge  of an SAE,  the investigator  must:  
• Enter  the information  related  to the SAE in the  appropriate sections  of the CRF.  
• Send  notification  of the SAE  to the monitoring  team after  investigator  approval  of the CRF 
All further data updates should be recorded in the CRF within one working day of knowledge of this 
additional  information.  Send  notification  of the updated  SAE information  to the monitoring  team  after 
investigator approval of the CRF.  
Additional documentation (e.g., laboratory data, concomitant medication, subject status, etc.), should 
be sent by [CONTACT_3719] e -mail to the monitoring team within one working day of knowledge of this 
information.  Care  should be taken to  ensure that  the subject's  identity is  protected  (personal identifiers 
are redacted) and the date and subject identifier in the clinical trial (i.e., subject number) are clearly 
visible  on every  page/copy  of source  document  that is provided  to the monitoring  team.  For laboratory 
results, include the laboratory normal ranges.  
After the EOS visit, the investigator does not need to actively monitor subjects for new SAEs. 
However, if the investigator becomes aware of a new or previously unreported serious adverse event 
within [ADDRESS_1128996] investigational drug instillation, the event should be reported to the 
sponsor/designee within [ADDRESS_1128997] investigational drug instillation, only SAEs 
considered related to the study drug should be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s  knowledge  of the event.  Serious  adverse  events  reported  outside  of the protocol -required 
reporting  period will be captured  within  the safety  database  as clinical  trial SAE  Report  Form  cases  for 
the purposes of expedited reporting.

Oct 16th [ADDRESS_1128998]’s participation in the study (or 
related to the  conduct of  the study), regardless of  whether or not  the study  drug was administered, will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_815406].  For example, an  unexpected, severe  SAE  that could  be associated  with the study  procedures  and 
could modify the study conduct requires expedited reporting.  
Each expedited safety report will routinely include a brief cover memorandum, the completed MedWatch 
Form FDA 3500A, a clinical analysis of the event with any similar events that have occurred wi th the 
product, and any additional pertinent information recommended by [CONTACT_138830]. Once the 
report is compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602], the study center’s investigator must submit the expedited safety report to the local 
IRB/IEC within the required reporting timef rame. Follow -up reports should be submitted when requested 
or when  pertinent  information  becomes  available.  The principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_815395]  a complete  copy  of

• Informed  consent  requirement  
• Contraceptives  in current  use 
By [CONTACT_1725], the investigator or designee asserts that he/she has discussed this 
information with the subject and provided appropriate counseling. Following the review of this 
information,  the subject  must  sign the informed  consent  form  to enroll  in the study.  During  the study, all 
subjects should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_815407] (e.g., missed or late menstrual period).  
 
If a subject or investigator  suspects  that the  subject may be  pregnant prior to  treatment, the  study  drug must 
be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available.  If pregnancy is confirmed, the 
subject  is considered  to be a screen  failure,  must  not continue  in the study,  and must  not receive  study  drug. 
If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receiving study treatment, the study drug must immediately 
be withheld until the result of pregnancy testing is known.  If pregnancy is confirmed, the stu dy drug will 
be permanently discontinued, and the subject and neonate will be followed until [ADDRESS_1129000] and neonate will be followed until 30 days after the pregnancy comes to term.

Pregnancy Report form within 24  hours  of the investigator’s  awareness  of the  pregnancy.  If a pregnancy is 
associated with an SAE, an SAE  report form should also be submitted to  the sponsor/designee and medical 
monitor within  24 hours  of the investigator’ s awareness.  Abnormal  pregnancy  outcomes  (e.g., spontaneous 
abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
 
Completed SAE Report Forms and completed Pregnancy Report Forms should be transmitted to the 
spons or/designee  and the medical  monitor using  the contact  [CONTACT_815408]  9.2 above.  
 
If/when the investigator becomes aware of any new information regarding a pregnancy, the 
sponsor/designee  and medical  monitor should  be notified  of these  updates  as soon  as the new information 
becomes  available.  Updates  should  be documented  on a Pregnancy  Report  Form  and sent by [CONTACT_815409].  The report should be marked as a follow -up report” and 
should include t he updated status of the pregnancy.  The original Pregnancy Report Form is not to be 
altered.  
 
 General Guidelines for Reporting Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the course of the study. 
Throughout the study, efforts will be made by [CONTACT_143286].  The period 
of observation for collection  of AEs exte nds from the time the subject gives informed  consent until the last 
study  visit or discontinuation  from  the study.  The first concern  will always  be the safety  of the subject, and 
appropriate medical intervention will be made.  
The AEs should  be documented  as a single  medical  diagnosis. When  this is not possible, the  AE should  be 
documented in terms of signs and/or symptoms observed by [CONTACT_815410]. Each AE which appears to be  independent of any prior event will be reported separately.  
All AEs occurring  after the subject  signs  the informed  consent  through  the last study  visit must  be reported, 
regardless of whether or not  the AEs  are considered drug -related. All AEs, whether in response to a query, 
observed by [CONTACT_3991], or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_423], will be recorded. Any AEs 
deemed related to treatment reported or observed at the final study/treatment vi sit will be followed until 
stabilization or resolution (or up to 30 days after final study visit).  
At each visit during the study, the subject will be assessed for the occurrence of new and ongoing AEs. 
Tolerability  signs  and symptoms  that result  in the subject’s  requiring  a concomitant  therapy, interruption  of 
treatment, or discontinuation  from  the study  will be reported  as an AE. The following  data will be collected 
on all AEs and recorded on the appropriate CRF:  
• Event  name  (diagnosis  preferred,  if unknow n, record  the signs/symptoms)  
• Onset  date and end date 
• Maximum  intensity  (severity)  
• Seriousness  
• Action taken regarding  study  drug 
• Corrective  treatment/therapy,  if given  
• Outcome

 • Resolution  
The investigator will also provide an assessment of the causal relationship to the study drug (for pre - 
treatment  AEs,  causality  is “not related”).  Rationale  MUST  be provided  for any “not related”  assessment 
and is recommended for “related” assessments.  
All AEs must  be reported  regardless  of whether  the AEs are considered drug -related.  
In order to ensure  the safety of the subjects, the  investigator should take appropriate  measures to follow all 
subjects  with adverse  events  until clinical  recovery  is complete, progression  has been stabilized, the  subject 
is lost to follow -up, or  until death.  This may result  in the  need for  observations to continue  beyond the last 
planned protocol specified visit, and additional investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_815411].  
If a subject  requires  further  follow -up of ongoing  AEs upon  discontinuation  or completion  of the study, the 
Investigator should schedule post -study follow -up visits, as necessary.  
Laboratory  results, vital  signs, or  ECG  abnormalities  are to be recorded  as AEs (or SAEs,  if applicable) 
only if at least one of the following apply:  
• the result is  clinically  significant  
• the subject is  symptomatic  
• the subject requires  either  corrective  treatment or  consultation  
• the lab result,  vital sign, or  ECG  abnormality  leads  to study  drug discontinuation  or dose 
modification  
• the event  fulfills  a criterion  for an SAE 
In addition,  the investigator’s  assessment  of causality  will be recorded.  
Vital sign abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs (or SAEs, if applicable) only if they are clinically 
significant  (for example:  are symptomatic,  requiring  corrective  treatment,  leading  to discontinuation  or 
fulfilling a seriousness criterion).

minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 -, 2-, and 4 hours). Change from baseline (post -instillation minus 
baseline) at each post instillation time point will be sum marized using continuous summary statistics.  
Paired  t-tests will be used to test the statistical  hypotheses.

 10.1.2  Secondary Efficacy  
This section is  not applicable  because  there are  no secondary efficacy  endpoints.  
10.1.3  Exploratory Efficacy  
The exploratory  endpoints  will be analyzed  in the same manner  as the primary  efficacy  endpoints.  
10.1.4  Statistical  Hypothesis  Testing  and Control  of Multiplicity  
Due to clinical  considerations,  the 36 statistical  tests will not be adjusted  for multiplicity.  The p-values  and 
any conclusions of statistical significance will be considered nominal.  
10.1.5  General  Considerations  
Quantitative  variables  will be summarized  descriptively  using  the number  of subjects  (n), mean,  median, 
standard  deviation,  minimu m, and maximum.  Qualitative  variables  will be summarized  using  counts  and 
percentages.  
All efficacy  analyses  will use a two-sided  alpha  = 0.[ADDRESS_1129003] unless  otherwise  stated  and corresponding  2- 
sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be presented as applicable.  
For efficacy and non -ocular safety analyses, the unit of analysis will be the subject. In the cases where 
assessments  are recorded  for each  eye, the study  eye and fellow  eye will be summarized  separately  and a 
mean across all eyes will also be calculated.  
 
Adverse events will also be summarized at the subject level; if an AE occurs in either or both eyes, the 
subject  will be counted  as having  the AE. For other ocular safety  analyses  the unit of analysis  will be the 
eye, with summaries showing results for the study eye and the fellow eye separately.  
 
 Assessment of Safety  
The following  safety  variables  will be recorded:  
 
• Adverse  Events  (AEs;  reported,  elicited  and observed)  
10.2.1  Adverse  Events  
Adverse events (AEs) wil l be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Frequencies and percentages of 
treatment -emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  will be summarized  at the subject  level  by [CONTACT_815412], treatment related TEAEs, and serious TEAEs. An AE is treatment 
emergent if it occurs or worsens after the first dose of study medication. Similar summaries will be 
presented for all TEAEs by [CONTACT_2074]. Separat e summaries will be performed for ocular and  non- 
ocular AEs.  
10.2.[ADDRESS_1129004]  disposition  will be presented  in terms  of the numbers  and percentages  of subjects  who completed

Plexiform neurofibromas are commonly seen in patients with Neurofibromatosis type I.  A 
significant number of these plexiform neurofibromas can result in severe disability from neurologic impi[INVESTIGATOR_20804], chronic pain, skeletal dysplasia, vascular complications, and/or organ dysfunction due to displacement or infiltration . Occasionally, these lesions are life -threatening 
due to the size or location of the tumor .  Presently, there is no effective medical therapy to offer 
patients with “high -risk”  plexiform neurofibromas. We have observed dramatic responses  within 
the last two years  in two patien ts with chronic “high- risk” plexiform neurofibromas. One patient, 
who had a large symptomatic pelvic “high- risk” plexiform neurofibroma, had complete 
resolution of symptoms along with approximately 50% tumor shrinkage with a treatment combination of naproxen and interferon alpha -2b. The second patient, who had a large cranio-
facial “high -risk” plexiform neurofibroma that had already caused an ischemic stroke by 
[CONTACT_858191], experienced a complete radiographic response (regression of the plexiform tumor) with a combination of celecoxib and interferon alpha -2b together with 
vincristine and temozolomide. These preliminary findings were conducted without grant funding.  This clinical trial will further evaluate the effectiveness of these tr eatment combinations in 
patients with “high -risk” plexiform neurofibromas. Eligible patients will begin treatment with the 
combination of a cox- 2 inhibitor (celecoxib) at a dose of 10 milligrams/kilogram/day (max 800 
mg/day) and pegylated interferon alpha -2b at a dose of 1 microgram/kilogram/given weekly 
(CI). If the patients have at least a partial response after six months they may continue on the 
same treatment for up to two years. However, if the patient experiences less than a partial response, or  has stable or progressive disease after six months of CI therapy, then vincristine (at 
a dose of 0.75 mg/m
2) and temozolomide (150 mg/m2/day given 5 consecutive days each month) 
will be added to the celecoxib and interferon alpha -2b backbone  (CITV) . Response t o the CITV 
therapy will be assessed after six months of treatment.  
 
2 STUDY HYPOTHESES  
 
 The hypothesis to be tested is NF1 patients with “high- risk” plexiform neurofibromas  that 
respond to treatment with celecoxib and pegylated interferon alpha -2b (CI) is  significantly 
greater than 0 —indicating an improved treatment response rate over traditional therapy.  
 
 The additional  hypothesis to be tested is that “high- risk” plexiform neurofibromas  who have  
demonstrate d resistan ce to treatment with  celecoxib and  pegylated interferon alpha -2b (CI) will 
respond to the addition of temozolomide and vincristine (CITV ), and this response rate will be  
significantly greater than 0.  
2.1 Specific Aims  
A. To define an algorithm for the medical treatment of “hig h-risk” plexiform 
neurofibromas using a sequential application of commercially available medications. 
B. To evaluate tumor response based on objective evaluation of symptom assessment  and 
tumor measurements .

2.2 Study Design and Treatment Plan 
This is a phase II single arm study with sequential treatments available by [CONTACT_858193] a combination of celecoxib and interferon alpha -2b (CI, 
treatment -1). Response to CI therapy will be assessed at six months by [CONTACT_858194]. Those patients who have achieved a partial response  (improvement in pain, improvement in functioning, or ≥50% reduction in tumor size) or complete response ( resolution 
of pain, and normalization of functioning with a ≥ 90% reduction in tumor size) will continue with the same CI therapy for up -to two years on study.  
 Patients who have rapi[INVESTIGATOR_54574] (≥50% growth in tumor size) within the first six months of CI treatment are required to undergo tumor biopsy to evaluate for malignancy. If this biopsy is negative for malignancy then these patients may begin treatment with celecoxib/interferon alpha -2b/temozolomide/vincristine (CITV, treatment- 2).  
 Patients who have not achieved at least a partial response to CI therapy after six months of 
treatment are also eligible to change to CITV treatment.  For these patients a biopsy of the tumor is recommended but not required to verify the pathology of the tum or before advancing to CITV 
therapy.

3.1 Plexiform Tumors in Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Patients  
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is  a progressive genetic disorder  with diverse cutaneous, 
neurologic, skeletal and neoplastic manifestations that affects 1 in 4000 persons [1]. While most 
of these persons are only mildly affected, some patients may experience severe compromise such as disabling disfigurement, neurologic impairment, or life -threatening compressions of  vital 
structures.  Three types of neurofibromas have been described in patients with NF1.  a) Dermal/cutaneous: Soft, non- painful raised cutaneous lesions. b) Subcutaneous/solitary 
neurofibromas: Firm round masses that occur along the course of peripheral  nerves, which are 
often painful and can compromise local structures as they enlarge. A variant of solitary neurofibromas may occur along the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], which can extend into the spi[INVESTIGATOR_858182]. c) Plexiform neur ofibromas: Soft poorly defined masses 
that often have the feeling of a bag of wet ropes. Plexiform neurofibromas are the most common cause of disfigurement in patients with NF1, and may be associated with life -threatening 
occlusion of the airway.  In addit ion, plexiform neurofibromas are often associated with 
dysfunction of peripheral nerves with weakness, and painful neuropathy [2]. For the purposes of this study we consider a ny neurofibroma that is c ausing severe disfigurement (cosmetic or 
functional, i.e. spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), chronic pain, impairment of neurological function, or compression of vital structures to be “high- risk.”  Most of these “high- risk” neurofibromas are the plexiform type of 
neurofibroma.  
 
3.2 Previous Treatments for Plexiform Tumors in NF1 
Surgical resection is the only proven treatment for “high- risk” plexiform neurofibromas.  
Unfortunately, complete surgical resection is not possible for most patients with “high- risk” 
plexiform neurofibroma s. Even when complete surgical resection is thought to be successful, 
half of the patients develop recurrent tumors after surgery.   Partial surgical resection is not effective, but is sometimes used in patients facing imminent loss of function from these tumors.  These limitations make surgical treatment of symptomatic neurofibromas on the face, spi[INVESTIGATOR_858183] [1, 3, 4] . Therefore, the search for effective adjuvant medical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_110395].  
 The medical treatment of “high -risk” plexiform neurofibromas has been disappointing. Ketotifen 
has been used to reduce the painful pr uritis of solitary or plexiform neurofibromas, but they do 
not reduce the size of tumors [1]. Gupta and Cohen studied the use of thalidomide in patients with serious plexiform neurofibromas in patients with NF1.  Four of the 12 patients studied did show a minor response to thalidomi de with 2 of these 4 patients demonstrating radiographic 
improvement. Seven of 12 patients reported an improvement in neurofibroma related symptoms. However, the widespread use of thalidomide was limited by [CONTACT_858195] [3].  Interferon 
alpha (IFN α) has been the subject of a previous phase II clinical trial which has yet to be 
published. Ac cording to a recent review, 96% of patients receiving IFN α therapy were 
considered at least stable, with a few patients showing radiographic or symptomatic improvement [5].

While the Schwann cells are generally accepted as the neoplastic cell of origin, recent evidence suggests that the tumor stroma  likely contributes to the proliferative state of 
these tumors. Stroma -derived elements including tumor growth factor beta (TGF - β) [7], matrix  
metalloproteinase(MMP) -9 [8] and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [9] are known to 
be elevated in plexiform neurofibromas, suggesting that they may serve as therapeutic targets. The initial agents selected for this trial we re chosen in part for their known antagonism in these 
signaling pathways. Interferon has been shown to down- regulate both TGF -β mRNA production 
in fibroblasts derived from human hypertrophic scar tissue [10]  and VEGF expression in human 
neuroendocrine tumor samples [11] . Cycloxygenase(COX) -2 inhibition (the inducible target 
enzyme of celecoxib) decreases both MMP and VEGF expression in animal models of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers [12-15]. High -dose Celecoxib  is now  approved for use to reduce 
the incidence of adenomatous  colorectal  polyps in patients with Familial Adenomatous 
Polyposis.  
 Additional intrinsic cellular aberrations that result from the NF -[ADDRESS_1195828] of RAS/mTOR [5]. NF -[ADDRESS_1195829] a functionally 
activated RAS/mTOR pathway. Interferon induced apoptosis has been shown to be mediated via the mTOR pathway, making neurofibromas the ideal target tumor type for interferon based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [16]. In addition to mTOR activation, oncogenic RAS mutations also up- regulate COX -
2 expression which would further promote tumor growth and angioge nesis [17, 18]  again making 
COX- 2 inhibitors an intriguing therapy. Very little information exists on the interplay between 
interferons and COX -2. In vitro evidence suggests that interferon alpha induces COX -2 
expression in vitro [19, 20] , which may explain the partial benefit of single agent interferon 
therapy in NF -1 patients. A recent clinical trial of combination interferon alpha plus celecoxib 
therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients was completed and documented the safety of this combination [21] .  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1195830] a relative risk 
of malignancy that is approxi mately 4 -6 fold higher than the general population [22] , the use of 
chemotherapy (carboplatin) in NF -1 patients has never been show n to increase that risk further 
[23]. Temozolomide has shown benefit in the treatment of unresectable gliomas , tumor of 
neuronal origin, and was therefore chosen as the cytotoxic agent on this protocol [24] . The 
design of this protocol reserves the use of chemotherapy only for patients with persistent high-risk lesion despi[INVESTIGATOR_750361]- chemotherapeutic agents (celecoxib plus interferon). The 
combination of temozolomi de and both interferon and celecoxib have been trialed separately in 
advanced melanoma patients and has shown some promise without discernable added toxicity [25, 26] .

Helen DeVos Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (HDVCH) , including patients who have participated in 
therapeutic clinical trials. While most of our experience using published therapy has been 
disappointing, there are two patients who  within the last three years  have had informative 
responses to treatment.   The first patient was referred to HDVCH for  treatment of a large plexiform neurofibroma of the 
pelvis and lumbar  spi[INVESTIGATOR_858185], leg weakness , and bladder dysfunction 
which was unresponsi ve to  a third attempt at surgical treatment.  This patient was started on a 
regimen of naproxen and Interferon alpha -2b and w ithin six weeks th is pat ient’s chronic pain had 
resolved .  Within 12 weeks the tumor was physically softer and measurably smaller o n clinical 
examination. Along with these changes the patient’s chronic leg weakness resolved, and bladder function become normal. After six months of therapy the mass was dramatically smaller on examination and measurable shrinkage by [CONTACT_858196].  T he patient was maintained on 
treatment  with both medications  for two years .  Because of difficulty concentrating in school, the 
treatment has been reduced to naproxen alone. On recent follow -up examination the high- risk 
plexiform neurofibroma remains small er than at diagnosis while using normal -dose naproxen.  
 
The second patient  is an infant that had a large disfiguring plexiform neurofibroma of the face 
and skull which  was noted at birth. The growth of the tumor was controlled with  interferon 
alpha -2b fro m 3 months of age but no tumor regression was noted on this therapy.  At three years 
of age the patient developed a symptomatic optic glioma and the interferon was interrupted for 12 months while she received vincristine and carboplatin; (During this thera py the patients 
plexiform tumor was stable in size) . Following this , the interferon was restarted  but at five  years  
of age the i nterferon alpha -2b was discontinued in order to participate in a therapeutic trial of 
thalidomide (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland O hio). After three months of treatment this patient’s 
plexiform tumor was markedly larger, and the patient withdrew from the study medication. The patient continued to have slow growth of the tumor after re-starting interferon and so celecoxib 
was added. Th e patient showed a minor response to this therapy but had no further progression 
of her cranial -facial plexiform neurofibroma. Three years later  (while continuing on treatment 
with celecoxib  and i nterferon alpha -2b) the patient developed a progressive  optic glioma and a 
symptomatic intrinsic brainstem tumor (never biopsied) which required additional therapy.  Since the patient had previously shown rapid tumor growth when the i nterferon alpha -2b was 
discontinued for pa rticipation in the  thalidomide trial, the c elecoxib/ interferon alpha -2b was 
continued while the patient received a combination of vincristine and temozolomide  for 
treatment of these new tumors. T he patient showed rapid shrinkage of her plexiform 
neurofibroma after the first treatment of celecoxcib /interferon alpha-
2b/vincristine/t emozolomide , and after three months  of treatment  had complete resolution  of the 
cranial -facial plexiform neurofibroma.  This patient s’ plexiform tumor continues to be in a 
clinical and radiographic remission after  24 months  of treatment with  celecoxib/ interferon alpha -
2b/vincristine/t emozolomide .

7 STUDY TREATMENT  
 
7.1 Treatment Duration :  
 Each treatment arm will be given for a minimum of six months, presuming the patient has not experienced progres sive disease, before advancing to the next arm. Total duration of 
therapy on study is two years for any  individual treatment plan  (i.e. treatment- 1 or 
treatment -2).  
 
7.2 Treatment  Arm 1   
A. Celecoxib 10 mg/kg/day given by [CONTACT_1966] (once or twice daily). See Appendix 2 for 
dosage table by [CONTACT_8497]. 
B. Pegylated interferon alpha -2b at a dose of 1 microgram(mcg)/kg of body weight given 
as a subcutaneous  injection  week ly. This dose was well tolerated by 26/28 patients in a 
previous trial [30].  To reduce the toxic side effects associated with beginning interferon therapy, the patients will begin with a dose of 0.3 mcg/kg, then escalate to 0.6 mcg/kg at week two, and 1 mcg/kg at week 3.  Diphenhydramine at 1 mg/kg orally is recommended one time before and tid for [ADDRESS_1195839] interferon dose.  Pre-medication with diphenhydramine at 1 mg/kg orally is recommended before each 
dose of interferon until drug tolerance is established.  
1. If a patient experiences fever >40
oC, rigors, or appetite suppression with weight     
loss, then the dose of interferon will be reduced to the previous dosage until the 
identified symptoms improve before resuming dosage escalation.  
2. Warning:  I nterferons, including interferon alfa -2b, can ca use or aggravate fatal or 
life-threatening neuropsychiatric  (including suicidal ideation and attempts) , 
autoimmune, ischemic, and infectious disorders. Patients will be monitored 
closely with monthly clinical and laboratory evaluations. Patients with 
persi stently severe or worsening signs or symptoms of these conditions will be

stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_858187] -2b therapy.  
C. If a study patient has progressive disease or no response to trea tment 1 after six months, 
he/she will proceed to treatment 2.  Patients who experience a rapid growth of tumor on treatment [ADDRESS_1195840] undergo a biopsy of this tumor to determine the pathologic phenotype of this tumor. Patients with a malignant phenotype  will be removed from 
study participation and will be referred for appropriate medical treatment.  
 
7.3 Treatment  Arm  2  
A. Continue treatment  arm 1 medications and add : 
B. Vincristine (Oncovin®) 0.75 mg/m2/dose or 0.025 mg/kg/dose if the patient weighs 
<15kg (m aximum dose 2mg) to be given intravenously weekly x 4 doses then every 
month with temozolomide [vincristine dose is 50% of normal because of concurrent 
interferon].  The dose of vincristine will be adjusted for gr ade 3 or 4 toxicity. See page 
20 (section 9.4).  
C. Temozolomide (Temodar®) (150 mg/m2/day) for 5 consecutive days given by [CONTACT_858205].  Fractionate Temodar® into 2- 3 daily doses with appropriate antiemetic 
coverage before each dose.  
 
7.4 Dose Adjustments   
A. Hepatic impairment : discontinue therapy if serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase 
exceeds 5 times the upper limit of normal .  
B. Hematologic : WBC count less than 1.5 x 10(9) /L; granulocyte count less than 0.75 x 
10(9) /L; platelet count less than 50 x 10(9) /L) reduce dose of temozolomide by 50%  
and escalate to full dose as tolerated .  Peg - interferon alpha 2a  can also cause 
hematologic toxicity, if the patient is not receiving temozolomide, the peg-  interferon 
alpha 2a  dose will be reduced by 50%  and escalate to full dose as tolerated . 
C. Hematologic : WBC count less than 1 x 10(9) /L; granulocyte count less than 0.5 x 
10(9) /L; platelet count less than 25 x 10(9) /L) hold and restart temozolomide (or peg -
interferon alpha 2a ) at less than 50% of previous dose after hematologic r ecovery  and 
escalate to full dose as tolerated.  
Special Circumstances: In the event that a patient with a pre- existing hematologic 
condition that is associated with cytopenias (neutropenia, anemia or thrombocytopenia) 
qualifies for study participation, the n the interpretation of these hematologic toxicity 
guidelines may be cautiously adjusted. Specifically, patients who are receiving celocoxib/interferon (CI) may receive supportive care utilizing growth factors (g- CSF 
[Neupogen], erythropoietin), prophylact ic antibiotics, or immunoglobulin (ie IVIG for 
immune thrombocytopenia Purpura) to reduce the complications associated with these cytopenias while continuing to receive full doses of study medications. Steroids should not be used in that they may also affe ct tumor response. However, should additional 
complications from these cytopenias occur (fever with neutropenia, clinical infections, or bleeding with thrombocytopenia), then adjustment of study medications to assure patient safety must take place.

obligation,  Albert S. Cornelius, David Dickens and Spectrum Health  must be promptly notified.  Patien ts who are receiving celocoxib/interferon/temozolomide/vincristine (CITV) do 
not qualify for this ‘exception’ and must follow the listed dose adjustment guidelines 
for cytopenias.  
D. Renal impairment : discontinue therapy if the serum creatinine exceeds 2 mg/dL  
E. Severe adverse reactions : temporarily discontinue therapy if severe adverse reactions 
develop. When the patient has recovered , interferon may be restarted at 50% of the 
previous dosage  and escalated to full dose as tolerated  at the discretion of the stu dy 
physician. 
F. Psychological : Interferons, including interferon alfa -2b, can cause or aggravate life -
threatening neuropsychiatric disorders. Patients will be monitored closely with monthly clinical evaluations. Patients with persistently severe or worsening  signs or symptoms 
of these conditions will be withdrawn from therapy. In many but not all cases these disorders resolve after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_858187] -2b therapy.  Patients with milder 
exacerbations of psychological dysfunction will be referred to a psychiatrist for consideration of treatments to control the symptoms without completely discontinuing study medications. 
 
7.5 Adverse Event s 
A. Definition of an adverse event: For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is defined as any inter -current illness which produces an adverse change from 
pretreatment baseline during the course of the study, whether the adverse event is considered related to the study treatment or not.  Adverse events that are gr aded as 
grade 3 or 4 by [CONTACT_858206] 3.0 for adverse events as published by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will be recorded.  
 
B. Definition of a serious adverse event: Serious adverse events (SAE) include any event resulting in death, any life -threatening experience, an event that causes or prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], any event that causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or events that require medical or surgical intervention to prevent the above.  
C. Adverse event reporting:  At each contact [CONTACT_1155], the investigator will seek 
information on adverse events by [CONTACT_858207]. Information on adverse events including onset date, duration, severity, relationship to the investigational agent, action taken with respect to the investigational agent and outcome will be recorded in the source document and also in the appropriate case report form (CRF).  
The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it is determined that the study t reatment is not the cause of the adverse event. Serious 
adverse events at the end of the study period will be followed to determine the final 
outcome. Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period that is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment will be recorded and reported immediately.    All unexpected and related adverse events will be reported to the Spectrum Health IRB 
(Institutional Review Board), per Spectrum Health IRB policies.

agreed to in writing, by [CONTACT_4615], you agree to hold this information in confidence and not copy or disclose it to 
others (except where required by [CONTACT_1289]) or use it for unauthorized purposes. In the event of any actual or suspected  breach of this 
obligation,  Albert S. Cornelius, David Dickens and Spectrum Health  must be promptly notified.  D. Data and safety monitoring: A multidisciplinary committee (composed of principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or sub- investiators, pharmacist, nurses, and research study staff) will 
evaluate this study for the purpose of data and safety monitoring. The committee will evaluate the need for amendments, revisions, and/or study discontinuation at least quarterly during the time of active patient participation .  More frequent meetings will 
be arranged as needed for toxicity monitoring.  
 
8 STAT ISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 The endpoint of this study is response to therapy which  will be established clinically as defin ed 
elsewhere in this proposal.  As long as patients show measurable response based on performance criteria ( using Lansky or Karnof sky Per formance Status Scales, see Appendix 1 ) or tumor 
evaluation they are considered a responder.  The simple design of this study allows for a binary statistical evaluation of response, w here a response is considered anything more than 0 (which is 
considered t o be stable or progressive disease).  
 The unknown factor in determining sample siz e is the number of patients who will respond to 
treatment a rm 1 with c elecoxib/ interferon alpha -2b(“CI” ).  If most study participants show a 
response to t reatment a rm 1, then t reatment a rm [ADDRESS_1195841] an adequate number of 
participants to determine response rates (even given this simple design).  We anticipate  a 
response rate approaching 50% to t reatment  arm 1.  This estimate a total study size of 20 patients 
is required to provide  up to 10 patients eligibility  to proceed to celecoxib/ interferon alph-
2b/temozolomide/ vincristine (CITV) treatment (i.e., Treatment Arm 2) . However, a significant 
number of pat ients may withdraw from study participation due to toxicity.  Thus we recommend 
accruing 10 patients in each treatment arm with a total sample size of 20 patients so that a minimum of 10 patients will be available for evaluation  in treatment a rm 2. 
 This p hase II clinical trial aims to establish the effica cy of a novel treatment for NF1.  Patients 
receiving this treatment will be in t reatment a rm 2, having already failed non- chemotherapy 
based  therapy in treatment arm I.  Therefore, the alternative hypothes is to be tested is that 
response to t reatment a rm 2 is significantly greater than 0 —indicating improvement in this group 
of patients over non- chemotherapy based therapy.  The corresponding null hypothesis being that 
the response rate in t reatment a rm [ADDRESS_1195842] the null hypothesis (approximately 5 if a response rate of 20% is expected in arm 2).  However, since the samples are not independent, this sample si ze 
must be increased somewhat.  Since a response rate of approximately 50% is expected in arm 1, 
approximately 10 patients will be available for arm 2, which should be adequate to demonstrate a 
response rate > 0 in a rm 2 even after adjustment for the non- independence of the samples .   
 
9 DRUG INFORMATION 
  
9.1 Celecoxib  (Celebrex )  revised Aug 2002  
 
Source and Pharmacology:  Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is 
a selective inhibitor of COX -2 (cyclooxygenase -2). Cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 are enzymes that 
are involved with conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. COX -1 is present normally 
in much of the body and is particularly involved in platelet aggregation and protective

been shown to reduce the formation of polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. 
Celecoxib is metabolized to inactive metabolites primarily by P -450 2C9. It appears that some 
drugs that stimulate or inhibit P -450 2C9 enzymes can increase or decrease the clearance of 
celecoxib. Celecoxib may inhibit P -450 2D6 and reduce the  clearance of drugs metabolized 
primarily by [CONTACT_544091]. Celecoxib is approximately 97% bound to plasma proteins. The elimination half -life of celecoxib is approximately 11 hours.

9.2 Peg-Interferon alpha -2b (PEG -Intron™)   Revised May 2007       
   
Source and Pharmacology:  Interferon alpha is a protein produced by [CONTACT_858208]. Intron A and Roferon A are obtained from strains of E.  Coli bearing a genetically -
engineered plasmid containing either interferon alpha 2b or interferon alpha 2a gene, respectively, from human leukocytes. Their structures differ by [CONTACT_858209] 26 position.  Alpha -IFN

and in  vivo.  Interferons bind to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface and induce several 
enzymes which result in decreased protein synthesis and DNA synthesis by [CONTACT_858210].  Other enzymes are induced by [CONTACT_858211] a) the inhibition of virus replication in virus -infected cells, b) suppression of cell proliferation, and c) 
such immunomodulation activities as enhancement of phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells.  
Following a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of PEG -Intron, the mean absorption half -life (t ½ k a) 
was 4.6 hours. Maximal serum concentrations (C max) occur between [ADDRESS_1195844] -dose, and 
are sustained for up to 48 -72 hours. The C max and AUC measurements of PEG -Intron increase in 
a dose -related manner. After multiple dosing, there is an increase in bioavailability of PEG -
Intron. Week 48 mean trough concentrations (320 pg/mL; range 0, 2960) are approximately 3-fold higher than Week 4 mean trough concentrations (94 pg/mL; range 0, 416). The mean PEG -
Intron elimination half -life is approximately 40 hours (range 22 to 60 hours) in patients with 
HCV infection. The apparent clearance of PEG -Intron is estimated to be approximately 22.0 
mL/hr·kg. Renal elimination accounts for 30% of the  clearance. Single dose peginterferon alfa -
2b pharmacokinetics following a subcutaneous 1.0 µg/kg dose suggest the clearance of 
peginterferon alfa -2b is reduced by [CONTACT_858212] 
(creatinine clearance <50 mL/min ute). Pegylation of interferon alfa -2b produces a product (PEG -
Intron) whose clearance is lower than that of non- pegylated interferon alfa -2b. When compared 
to INTRON A, PEG- Intron (1.0 µg/kg) has approximately a seven- fold lower mean apparent 
clearance an d a five -fold greater mean half -life permitting a reduced dosing frequency. At 
effective therapeutic doses, PEG -Intron has approximately ten- fold greater C
max and 50- fold 
greater AUC than interferon alfa -2b.

9.4.1 Dose Modification Guidelines for Vincristine : 
 
 Definition of Neuropathy 
A. Severe neuropathic pain (grade 3 or greater):   Hold dose(s). When symptoms subside, 
resume at 50% previous dose, then escalate to full dose as tolerated.  
NOTE: neuropathic pain can be not only severe but difficult to treat. However, because 
vincristine is an  important component of curative therapy and the majority of neuropathies 
are ultimately reversible, vincristinetherapy may be given at full dose at investigator discretion. Severe peripheral neuropathies, with or without a  positive family history might 
suggest the need for a molecular diagnostic evaluation to rule out  Charcot Marie Tooth 
Disease (CMT), Type 1A or Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Drugs such as  gabapentin may be of value.  
B. Vocal Cord paralysis:   Hold dose(s). When symptoms subside, resume at 50% previous 
dose, then escalate to ful l dose as tolerated.  
C. Foot Drop, paresis:   Should be grade 3 to consider holding or decreasing dose. These 
toxicities are largely reversible but over  months to years. Accordingly, holding doses of 
vincristine and/or lowering the dose may not result in rapid resolution of symptoms and may compromise cure. See above for comment on CMT. Physical therapy may be beneficial to maintain range of motion and provide AFO’s and other forms of support. Drugs such as  gabapentin may be of value.  
D. Jaw pain: Treat with analg esics; do not modify vincristine dose.  
E. Constipation or ileus (> Grade 3) or typhlitis:  Hold dose(s); institute aggressive regimen to treat constipation if present. When symptoms abate resume at 50% dose and escalate to full dose as tolerated.  
9.4.2 Gradin g of Sensory N europathy (from Balis):  
Grade 1:  Paresthesias, pain, or numbness that do not require treatm ent or interfere with 
extremity function.  
Grade 2:  Paresthesias, pain, or numbness that are controlled by [CONTACT_105]- narcotic medications 
(without causing loss of function), or alteration of fine motor skills (buttoning shirt, writing or drawing, using eating utensils) or gait, without abrogating ability to perform these tasks. 
Grade 3:  Paresthesias or pain that are controlled by [CONTACT_74811], or inter fere with extremity 
function (gait, fine motor skills as outlined above), or quality of life (loss of sleep, ability to perform normal activities severely impaired).  
Grade 4:  Complete loss of sensation, or pain that is not controlled by [CONTACT_74811].

Grade 1:  Subjective weakness, but no deficits detected on neurological exam, other than 
abnormal deep - tendon reflexes.  
Grade 2:  Weakness that alters fine motor skills (buttoning shirt, coloring, writing or  
drawing, using eating utensils) or gait without abrogating ability to perform these tasks.  
Grade 3:  Unable to perform fine motor tasks (buttoning shirt, coloring, writing or drawing, using eating utensils) or unable to ambulate without assistance.  
Grade 4:  Paralysis.

9.4.5 Ext ravasations : 
In the event of an extravasation, discontinue the IV administration of the drug and institute appropriate  measures to prevent further extravasation and damage according to institutional 
guidelines. Suggestions below  may be helpful but none are considered definitive:  
A. Stop infusion, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_858189], remove needle  
B. Apply warm compress immediately for 1 hour then rotate on/off every 15 minutes for 24 hours. 
C. Hyaluronidase 150 units/ml reconstituted with NS -inject 1ml for each 1 ml of drug 
extravagated  or 
D. Treat with cold compresses, dilute thru infiltration of 5 mL of an 8.4% solution of sodium bicarbonate  and/or local injection of hydrocortisone.

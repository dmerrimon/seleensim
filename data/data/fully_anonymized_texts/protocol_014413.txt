Eligible participants may or may not be receiving anticancer treatment with aromatase inhibitors (either 
exemestane, letrozole or anastrozole), but must have completed all planned chemotherapy, or radiation for at 
least [ADDRESS_1061759] density by [CONTACT_773272] 6 months 
on denosumab. This is an investigator-initiated trial and [COMPANY_010] will provide the trial drug, Xgeva®.
The primary  endpoint of the study will be the change in breast density of the contralateral, uninvolved breast as 
measured by  [CONTACT_773273][INVESTIGATOR_007] (FWR-MRI) comparing 6 months on denosumab (MRI EOS) to 
breast density by [CONTACT_773274]-MRI at baseline (MRI BL). As changes in breast density in the contralateral, uninvolved 
breast will be the primary endpoint of the study, patients with bilateral breast cancer, bilateral mastectomies, or 
extensive breast implant in the contralateral breast will be ineligible. 
The following are planned  exploratory endpoints.  
1) Change  in tissue composition (epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], stroma and fat) after [ADDRESS_1061760] denosumab therapy
2) Change  in specific and global gene expression patterns in breast biopsy tissues after 6 months on 
denosumab 
3) Change  in progestogen levels and the OPG/RANKL ratio after 6 months on denosumab
4) Circulating  progestogen levels and the OPG/RANKL ratio will also be correlated to MRI-acquired fat-to-
water ratio at baseline and after [ADDRESS_1061761] at baseline and after 6 months of denosumab therapy. It is 
anticipated that ~75% women at baseline will provide tissue samples for cross sectional comparative analyses 
with MRI features at baseline and ~60% after [ADDRESS_1061762] analyses of biomarker response to intervention. Tissue studies will include characterization of 
tissue histology (graded by [CONTACT_773275]) and molecular measures of proliferation and 
apoptosis. The attached schedule of events depi[INVESTIGATOR_773256] (Appendices 1.1 and 1.2).   
5. STUDY  RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND
5.1. Women  still die from ER+ breast cancers 
Each year,  more than 192,[ADDRESS_1061763] cancer deaths are recorded among women in the U.S. 
(1). Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and selective ER modulators (i.e., tamoxifen) are effective in delaying or 
preventing the progression of ER+ disease in 50-70% of women diagnosed with ER+ tumors (2). AIs demonstrate 
modest, but consistently superior, efficacy for reducing risk of breast cancer events in postmenopausal women 
and are now the primary modality for adjuvant hormonal therapy in these patients (3). This success provides the 
proof of principle that breast cancer is a preventable disease.  In spi[INVESTIGATOR_773257]-
targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_773258], breast cancer remains a major cause 
of death in women.  This is partly due to the poor risk benefit ratio for the SERMS and AIs for primary prevention 
and the fact that there are currently no drug options for the prevention of ER negative disease, which tends to 
be more aggressive with early metastasis. 
5.2. Targeting  RANKL for the prevention of breast cancer   
There is  now convincing evidence that extensive areas of radiographically-dense tissue in the breast is an 
independent risk factor for the development of breast cancer (4-9). The presence of dense tissue that occupi[INVESTIGATOR_773259]: 3/3/2021
Expi[INVESTIGATOR_5952]: 3/2/2022
Stony Brook University Human Subjects Committee (IRB)
Page 21 of 23more than  50 percent of the area of a mammographic image, which occurs in up to 30% of postmenopausal 
women, is associated with a three- to five-fold elevated risk of breast cancer. While strongly associated, the 
biological or mechanistic link between breast density and breast cancer risk has not been elucidated.  Of the 
factors that have been studied, menopause has the most profound effect on breast density with dramatic 
decreases observed in the [ADDRESS_1061764] density with agent withdrawal more evident with cessation of MPA + E than E alone. 
(Colacurci, Fornaro et al., Hofseth, Raafat et al. 1999) Postmenopausal hormone therapy, particularly 
combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_160062] a progesterone component and, in particular, medroxyprogesterone acetate 
(MPA) prevent the decline in breast density and promote an increase in women with low breast density.  The 
effect of progesterone on the breast stroma and epi[INVESTIGATOR_773260], which collectively make up dense 
appearing tissue on a mammogram, are hypothesized, in part, to explain the higher risk of breast cancer among 
users of combination hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms. (Hofseth, Raafat et al. 1999, Campagnoli, 
Clavel-Chapelon et al. 2005, Narod 2011, Obr and Edwards 2012).  
More recently,  it has been shown that progesterone upregulates the expression of RANK ligand in the breast 
and that by [CONTACT_773276][INVESTIGATOR_475597]. (Obr and Edwards 2012)  
This effect has been postulated to explain the association between progesterone and breast cancer (see 
rationale for drug selection).  A number of factors have been shown to modulate the levels of RANK ligand, which 
is now hypothesized to act in the breast to promote the growth of mammary stem cells.  Here, we postulate that 
it is RANK ligand that mediates the association between breast density and risk of breast cancer for which 
progesterone is one of several factors that influence the availability of RANK ligand in mammary tissue to 
promote or sustain higher breast density.  As such, we hypothesize that inhibition of RANK ligand with the anti-
RANK ligand antibody therapeutic agent denosumab will decrease breast density, a risk factor for breast cancer 
development.   
5.3. Overall  significance of the study 
This study  will determine if therapeutic suppression of RANK ligand has a direct effect on breast tissue that is 
detectable as a decrease in breast density.  We will investigate the effect of denosumab on breast tissue using 
novel imaging approaches discussed below.  Secondarily, we will explore whether denosumab has direct effects 
on serum or breast tissue levels of OPG and RANK ligand gene expression and whether or not change in 
expression patterns correlates with change in breast density.  
6. STUDY  HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES
Our primary objective  is to assess the effect of denosumab on breast density in pre and post-menopausal early 
stage breast cancer patients. Denosumab will be administered at [ADDRESS_1061765] density assessed by [CONTACT_773277] (FWR-MRI) of the breast. We will test the primary hypothesis that RANK ligand 
inhibition by [CONTACT_773278] (Xgeva) given 120mg q monthly will significantly decrease breast density over [ADDRESS_1061766] density from the baseline MRI (MRI BL) to the second MRI at the end of study visit (MRI EOS) 
([ADDRESS_1061767] denosumab study injection) will provide breast density measurements for 
determining change  in breast density in women on intervention for 6 months (the primary objective).
6.1. Primary  Objective: 
A comparison  of the change in breast density as measured by [CONTACT_9268]-acquired fat-to-water ratio (FWR-MRI) in the 
contralateral, unaffected breast pre- and post-denosumab (primary trial endpoint).
Hypothesis: At least  30% of women treated with denosumab will show a > 5% relative decrease in  breast 
density after  6 months denosumab treatment when compared to their baseline density. 
6.2. Planned  Exploratory Objectives:
i. Correlate  baseline tissue characteristics (e.g., cellularity) and tissue biomarkers (e.g., Ki67, OPG, 
RANKL) to FWR-MRI to identify tissue correlates of MR image features at baseline.

Participants will  be pre- and postmenopausal/perimenopausal women with early stage (stage 0-III) breast 
cancer, including having received biopsies for ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ, who are disease free at 
enrollment and who are at least [ADDRESS_1061768] treatments including radiation, surgery and chemotherapy.  Women 
may or may not be on long-term hormonal therapy with aromatase inhibitors (e.g. letrozole, exemestane or 
anastrozole). We estimate a 10 % dropout rate prior to study conclusion (6 months imaging endpoints) for a total 
of [ADDRESS_1061769] density (i.e. typi[INVESTIGATOR_773261], mostly dense, etc. on mammography) are also eligible. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_773262].
8. INFORMATION  ON STUDY AGENTS
8.1  Denosumab   
Denosumab is  a fully human monoclonal IgG2 antibody that binds with high affinity and specificity to RANK 
ligand (Kd 3 x 10-12 M). This binding prevents the activation of RANK and inhibits the formation, activation, and 
survival of osteoclasts, the result of which is a reduction in the number and function of osteoclasts and, 
consequently, a decrease in bone resorption and an increase in cortical and trabecular bone mass, volume, and 
strength (10). Denosumab is highly specific and binds only to RANK ligand and no other members of the tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF) family, including TNFα, TNFβ, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, or CD40 ligand 
(Elliott et al, 2006).
The safety  and efficacy of denosumab for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone 
metastases from solid tumors was demonstrated in three international, randomized (1:1), double-blind, active-
controlled, non-inferiority trials comparing denosumab with zoledronic acid. In all three trials, patients were 
randomized to receive 120 mg denosumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks or 4 mg zoledronic acid intravenously 
(IV) every 4 weeks (dose adjusted for reduced renal function). Patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 
mL/min were excluded. In each trial, the main outcome measure was demonstration of noninferiority to time to 
first skeletal-related event (SRE) as compared to zoledronic acid. The breast cancer trial enrolled [ADDRESS_1061770] cancer and bone metastasis. Randomization was stratified by a history of prior SRE (yes 
or no), receipt of chemotherapy within 6 weeks prior to randomization (yes or no), prior oral bisphosphonate use 
(yes or no), and region (Japan or other countries). Forty percent of patients had a previous SRE, 40% received 
chemotherapy within 6 weeks prior to randomization, and 5% received prior oral bisphosphonates.  Median age 
was 57 years, 80% of patients were White, and 99% of patients were women. The median number of doses 
administered was [ADDRESS_1061771] SRE by 
18% and first or subsequent SRE by 23%.  Overall survival and progression-free survival were similar between 
arms in all three trials.
Recently published results  from a placebo-controlled trial, involving [ADDRESS_1061772] cancer currently receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy, confirmed that adjuvant 
denosumab reduced the risk of clinical fractures in this population, irrespective of their bone density status, at

Page 21 of 23baseline ( 11). This study included over 900 patients treated with denosumab with normal bone mineral density 
at baseline who equally benefited from denosumab therapy compared to patients with osteopenia at baseline.  
More importantly, the  same study found that after a median follow-up of four years, patients assigned to 
denosumab had an 18% reduced risk of disease recurrence or death compared with those assigned placebo 
(12). The  ongoing double-blind placebo-controlled trial D-CARE ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) randomized 4,[ADDRESS_1061773] cancer to either denosumab 120mg monthly x 6 months (same regimen as in this study) and 
then continued  therapy with q 3 months of Xgeva or a placebo for up to 5 years of treatment. Bone mineral 
density was not  obtained at baseline and low bone mineral density was not an inclusion critieria.   From the 
population treated,  it can be assumed that ~40-50% of the women who received denosumab treatment likely 
had normal bone  density at baseline. Similarly, it can be assumed that a large fraction (~40-45%) of participants 
were pre-menopausal at  accrual. The study started accrual in 2010 and reached its accrual goals in 2016.  Thus, 
all participants  (over 2,250 women) randomized to denosumab received the agent for at least [ADDRESS_1061774] been reported with the study 
continuing as per  protocol without revision.
Denosumab is  FDA approved for prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from 
solid tumors, however its use in this protocol is investigational. The FDA has recognized an IND exemption for 
the use of denosumab in this study, in accordance to current regulations [21 CFR 312.2(b)].
9. RATIONALE  FOR DRUG AND DOSE SELECTION  
RANK may  be expressed in human breast tumors and functional on breast cancer cells (13). Signaling through 
RANK/RANKL regulates the development of the mouse mammary gland during pregnancy. Transgenic mice 
overexpressing murine RANK exhibit increased mammary tumorigenesis relative to wild type mice in both 
induced (medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA] + 1,7-dimethyl-benz(a) anthracene [DMBA]) and spontaneous 
(multiple pregnancies) models of mammary tumorigenesis (14). RANK expression is associated with an 
increased incidence of more extensive ductal hyperplasia and mammary intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601], an increased 
incidence of adenocarcinoma, as well as a shorter latency to tumor formation and increased numbers of tumors 
per gland in mouse (15). Conversely, inhibition of the RANK/RANKL axis reduces hormone-induced mammary 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_773263] (14, 16). These observations support the 
hypothesis that inhibition of RANKL with denosumab may delay or prevent the development of breast cancer 
and/or disease recurrence in early-stage breast cancer.
Based on  safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic data from phase I, II and III studies, a dosing regimen 
of denosumab [ADDRESS_1061775] cancer and bone 
metastases: 30 mg, 120 mg or 180 mg SC given Q4W, and 60 mg or 180 mg given Q12W (17, 18). The regimen 
of [ADDRESS_1061776] median reduction of the bone turnover marker, uNTX, at week 
13, the primary endpoint of the study. Unlike lower doses, a 120 mg Q4W schedule avoids low drug exposures, 
which could potentially translate into insufficient efficacy in some patients. Denosumab was found to be safe and 
well tolerated in all study arms.  As the duration of the study is only 6 months, long term and rare complications 
of denosumab therapy including ONJ and/or atypi[INVESTIGATOR_773264].  In addition, treating 
at the maximal efficacious, yet safe dose of the drug will maximize our probability of discovering changes in breast 
density and/or tissue markers of breast risk that would foster the development of larger and longer duration trials 
of denosumab for preventing breast cancer recurrence.
Additionally, over  2,[ADDRESS_1061777] been randomized to receive denosumab at 
120mg SC q month x 6 and then 120mg SC every 3 months for the next 4 and a half years ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
clinical trials.gov).  In this trial, decreased bone density was not an eligibility criteria and it can safely be assumed 
that many women (~40-50%) enrolled on this study had normal bone mineral density treated with this dose 
intensive schedule of denosumab. The trial completed accrual (study was enrolling patients from 2010-2016) 
and is in follow-up for the primary endpoint of bone metastases free survival (expected 2017).  Previously, 
denosumab was found to be superior to other bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid) in preventing skeletal-related

Expi[INVESTIGATOR_5952]: 3/2/2022
Stony Brook University Human Subjects Committee (IRB)
Page [ADDRESS_1061778], again irrespective of bone density (19). In this 
trial as well, no unexpected toxicity to denosumab was observed compared to zoledronic acid and the trial was 
never stopped or placed on hold by [CONTACT_773279].  
Increasing evidence suggests  that bone density at baseline does not alter the risk profile for short-term 
denosumab treatment. For this reason, we plan to enroll women regardless of their bone density in this trial 
involving [ADDRESS_1061779] information on bone density at 
baseline, via DEXA scan as patients with low bone mineral density will receive known benefit from therapy.
Prolia (denosumab  60mg Q6mo) is commonly prescribed to patients in long term follow up care for breast cancer, 
especially those with hormone receptor positive disease and receiving anti-estrogen therapy. Treatment with 
aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, exemestane, letrozole) does not alter breast density and does not increase 
the risk of side effects. 
10. TOXICITY  FOR DENOSUMAB REPORTED ADVERSE EVENTS AND IDENTIFIED RISKS
The safety  of Xgeva was evaluated in three randomized, double-blind, active controlled trials comparing 
denosumab to zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with bone metastasis from 
prostate cancer, breast cancer, or other solid tumors, or lytic bony lesions from multiple myeloma. A total of [ADDRESS_1061780] one dose of Xgeva (Appendix 6). The most common side effects attributable to 
denosumab were hypophosphatemia and hypocalcemia. Severe hyposphosphatemia (serum phosphorus less 
than 2 mg/dL) occurred in 15.4% of patients on denosumab compared to 7.4% of patients treated with the 
intravenous bisphosphonate zoledronic acid. Severe hypocalcemia (corrected serum calcium less than 7 mg/dL) 
occurred in 3.1% of patients treated with denosumab compared to 1.3% of patients treated with zoledronic acid.  
The most common side effects overall were fatigue/asthenia and nausea, but the majority of patients were also 
treated with chemotherapy on these trials. While no deaths from hypocalcemia have been reported in any of the 
phase 3 trials, rare (7) deaths have been described in patients with metastatic disease and co-morbidities or low 
serum calcium levels prior to initiation of denosumab therapy.  Patients with severe renal dysfunction (CrCl < 
30mL/min) are more likely to develop hypocalcemia. Data from these registration trials suggest renal 
insufficiency, nonadherence with vitamin D and calcium supplementation, prostate cancer, and lung cancer are 
risk factors for the development of grade 3 or 4 hypocalcemia.
In this  trial, those patients with insufficient blood levels of calcium and/or vitamin D at baseline 1 will receive 
supplemental calcium 800 mg and vitamin D (minimum 1000 IU daily). All patients will have adequate vitamin D 
levels (25 hydroxy vitamin D >20 ng/mL) as quantified by [CONTACT_773280], be instructed 
on the symptoms of hypocalcemia, and have serum calcium levels measured prior to each denosumab dose to 
protect against the development of significant hypocalcemia.
10.1 Osteonecrosis  of the Jaw (ONJ) 
In the primary  treatment phases of the 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 trials comparing denosumab to zoledronic acid for 
preventing SREs, ONJ was confirmed by [CONTACT_773281] 1.8% of patients receiving 
denosumab group and 1.3% of patients in the zoledronic acid group. When also including ONJ events occurring 
over an additional 4 months of blinded study in each trial, the incidence of confirmed ONJ was 2.2% in patients 
who received denosumab. The median time to ONJ was 14 months (range: 4 – 25). Risk factors for ONJ included 
tooth extraction (60%), and local tooth infection (48%) (20). 
The incidence of ONJ  was more recently updated in 2016. In this publication, the patient-year adjusted incidence 
of confirmed ONJ was 1.1% in patients receiving long-term monthly denosumab therapy for either metastatic 
prostate or breast cancer during the first year of treatment with increasing incidence rates observed with longer 
durations of therapy. When considering only those patients being treated for metastatic breast cancer, the 
adjusted patient-year risk of ONJ was 0.9% for the first year of use (21). As our study limits denosumab 
administration to only 6 monthly doses or roughly half the 12 doses prescribed in these trials, the risk for ONJ in 
this study can be reasonably expected to be lower than the observed 0.9% incidence (or less than 10 out of 
10,000 patients).

or no trauma to the affected area.  They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected 
areas, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs.  During 
denosumab treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip or groin pain.  Patients 
presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femoral fractures, and the contralateral 
femur should also be examined. 
10.4 Multiple vertebral  fractures
There is  a risk of for multiple vertebral fractures following discontinuation of Xgeva (denosumab 120mg) in 
subjects participating in ongoing clinical trials. These fractures are not due to bone metastases. The events 
occurred in post-menopausal women with malignancies who had previous fractures (vertebral or non-vertebral) 
or who had known osteoporosis. Xgeva’s effects on bone are known to be reversible and bone turnover increases 
after Xgeva is discontinued. Following discontinuation of Xgeva during study conduct or after study completion 
the Investigators should consider the individual subject’s risk for fractures and the benefit:risk ratio of initiating 
anti-resorptive therapy in accordance with local guidelines for managing osteoporosis.

13. STUDY PARTICIPANT  IDENTIFICATION
Participants who  have been consented will be identified on study-related documentation and forms with a unique 
8 alphanumeric study identifier. These numbers will be issued to participants sequentially and no participant 
identification numbers will be re-assigned in the event that the participant is withdrawn from the study.
14. ASSIGNMENT  TO STUDY GROUPS
The study  will be a single institution, non-randomized trial.  All the consented participants will be given the study 
intervention. Perimenopausal women will be considered as postmenopausal, for the goals of this trial. In case of 
significant menstrual period frequency changes during the course of the study (e.g. premenopausal participants 
becoming peri-menopausal, or those resuming a regular period at the end of their breast cancer treatment, but 
originally enrolled as peri-postmenopausal), will be required to sign the consent of the new corresponding study 
group and visits will be scheduled accordingly for the remaining of the study. The coordinator will document 
schedule changes in a nurse’s note and an administrative tracking form. 
Patients who  underwent hysterectomy without or unilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936]-oophorectomy (removal of ovaries) in the 
previous 12 months will be tested for levels of estradiol, follicule-stimulating (FSH) hormone at screening, in 
order to determine their menopausal status. 
15. STUDY PLAN  AND SCHEDULE OF EVENTS
The proposed  study will be a non-randomized trial of pre- and postmenopausal women previously diagnosed 
with early stage breast cancer.  Women will receive denosumab [ADDRESS_1061791] cancer clinics of the Stony Brook Cancer 
Center. (Appendix 1.1 and 1.2: Schedule of Events).

The research  nurse will explain all aspects of the study in lay language to the potential eligible participants, 
answer all questions regarding the study, and confirm eligibility.  If the participant decides to participate in the 
study, she will be asked to review, sign and date the Informed Consent Form (ICF). The ICF has to be completed 
prior to initiating any study related procedures. The study agent will not be released to a participant who has not 
signed the ICF. Participants may terminate or withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason, including 
development of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE), noncompliance, medical 
contraindication, or desire without prejudice.
17. SCREENING  AND BASELINE VISIT PROCEDURES
All participants  will be asked to provide an optional core biopsy sample at their baseline visit.  For participants 
who consent to breast biopsy at baseline, the breast specialist at Stony Brook University (radiologist or surgeon), 
as a fee for service, will use mammography images to identify two areas of increased radiographic density, 
located at least 2 cm apart, in the upper, outer quadrant of the contralateral (uninvolved) breast. 
Mammographically dense areas will be co-localized with ultrasound guidance, with their relative positions 
recorded by [CONTACT_480442]-face and linear distance away from the nipple. Under ultrasound guidance, a 14-gauge cutting 
needle will be used to obtain up to 8 tissue cores from one of the two identified high-density areas. Since 5-10 
tissue cores are typi[INVESTIGATOR_480399], our tissue sampling protocol 
should not impose undue participant burden or risk. Representative FFPE (formalin fixed and paraffin embedded) 
specimens will be reviewed at Stony Brook University by [CONTACT_480456]. Ken Shroyer, a 
board-certified anatomical pathologist who specializes in breast pathology. All research tissue cores are 
processed at Stony Brook University.  Evaluation of change in gene expression related to apoptotic, proliferation, 
and alternative biomarkers will be conducted in the laboratory of [CONTACT_194605] at Cedars Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Los 
Angeles CA. All breast biopsies will be obtained 21 days +/- [ADDRESS_1061793], covering shippi[INVESTIGATOR_480371].
Blood chemistry results obtained  up to 6 months prior to enrollment are considered valid for eligibility

18. TREATMENT PLAN  AND EVENTS
On study,  injection visits will be scheduled every month (±10 days). The first 2 injections will be administered at 
Stony Brook Cancer Center, after ensuring that participants’ blood calcium is within the accepted range (between 
8.0mg/dL and 11.5 mg/dL). Upon patients’ request, the remainder of denosumab injections (injections 3 through 
6) will be administered at the participants’ homes. End of study (EOS) procedures (e.g. biopsy, MRI, research 
blood and urine etc.) will be conducted at the Cancer Center approximately [ADDRESS_1061795], 
injection.  See Appendix 1.1 and 1.2 for a more detailed study plan.
 
The following events  will occur on study.  
Denosumab  120 mg will be given subcutaneously at monthly intervals for a total of 6 injections
A  chemistry panel (to include serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D, urea nitrogen, creatinine, ALT, AST, 
calcium, and phosphorus) will be performed at baseline.
Blood calcium levels  will be checked before injections 1,  2, [ADDRESS_1061796] denosumab injection. If serum calcium level is lower than 2.0 mmol/L (8.0 mg/dL) the 
participant will not receive the study drug and will be prescribed calcium supplements.  If symptomatic, 
the patient will be evaluated by a provider, or if asymptomatic their provider will be notified.  Once 
calcium levels are within range they may resume the study, but will be required to receive all study 
injections at the Cancer Center, and blood calcium levels will be measured and confirmed to be within 
range immediately prior to each injection.
Blood for serum  OPG and RANK ligand levels will be obtained at baseline and at EOS visit (in 
premenopausal women, blood will be obtained during the luteal phase or days 18-24 after initiation 
of menses) (research blood)
A  breast core biopsy at baseline and at the EOS visit for planned biomarker studies (OPG and RANK 
ligand) and storage for future studies (All breast biopsies will be obtained 21 days +/- [ADDRESS_1061797] biopsy for 
hormone levels).
Two  non-contrast breast MRIs will be obtained over the course of this study (in premenopausal 
women breast MRI scans will be performed within 14 days from the beginning of menses, during the 
follicular phase) at baseline and again ~1 month after the 6th denosumab injection 
A  urine sample for research biomarker studies will be obtained at baseline and at the EOS visit (in 
premenopausal women, urine will be obtained during the luteal phase or days 18-24 after initiation of 
menses) (research urine)
Vital signs (blood  pressure, pulse);
Height  and weight;
Review  concomitant medications and supplements use in the past 30 days;

in in order to avoid coming to the Stony Brook Cancer Center.
-However,  if subjects’ insurance does not cover monthly calcium testing, subjects with normal, non-
decreasing, calcium values may skip the third blood calcium testing (i.e. ahead of third denosumab 
injection visit) at the discretion of study investigators, in order to limit contacts. This still constitutes a 
deviation reportable to the IRB. 
-In  order to minimize contact [CONTACT_773283], body 
measurements and vitals will not be documented.  This will not be considered a deviation and will not 
impact subjects’ safety or data integrity.
-The  final MRI/Biopsy may be postponed up to an additional 6 weeks based on COVID-19 precautions.
Subjects will  be verbally notified of these changes and the communications will be documented in the subjects’ 
binders.

20. AGENT  ADMINISTRATION
Denosumab -  Study agent (Denosumab injectable, 120 mg active) will be nurse-administered. Toxicities 
associated with denosumab administration include pain at the injection site and symptoms of drug 
hypersensitivity including headache, rash, flushing, swelling, shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting.  Clinically 
significant hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis has been reported with use of denosumab. Reactions may 
include hypotension, dyspnea, upper airway edema, lip swelling, rash, pruritus, and urticaria.  
21. CONCOMITANT  MEDICATIONS
Patients may be  instructed to take daily supplements of at least [ADDRESS_1061802] 1000 IU of vitamin 
D, unless contraindicated or documented hypercalcemia (albumin-adjusted serum calcium >2.9mmol/L 
[11.5mg/dL] or ionized calcium >1.5mmol/L [6.0mg/dL] develops on study.
Due to  differences in regional availability, a dosage form of Vitamin D that gives an equivalent of at least 1000 
IU daily may be given.
Patients on  therapy with aromatase inhibitors will continue the treatment as clinically indicated. Changes in 
agent, dose or frequency will be captured in a Concomitant Medications Form, and reviewed at each study visit, 
and during the Follow Up phone call.
22. TOXICITY  MONITORING AND RESPONSE PLAN
Administration  of investigational product (denosumab) will be withheld for any subject who experiences 
a grade 3 or 4 adverse event per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (NCI CTCAE) reported by [CONTACT_120047], or osteonecrosis 
of the jaw (ONJ) as determined by [CONTACT_773287]. Treatment may 
also be withheld upon discretion of the study doctor for any reason to remove risk or minimized discomfort 
to participants. Re-exposure to investigational product may occur when the event resolves to grade [ADDRESS_1061803]’s baseline, and if the investigator and the sponsor agree subject safety will not be 
compromised. 
Osteonecrosis  of the jaw (ONJ) can occur in subjects receiving denosumab. A dental examination with 
appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with denosumab in patients with 
risk factors for ONJ.  Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ while on denosumab 
should receive care by a dentist or oral surgeon.  Patients should be monitored for ONJ as part of routine 
clinical practice. Patients should be instructed to maintain good oral hygiene and avoid invasive dental 
procedures, if possible. Administration of investigational product (denosumab) will also be withheld 30 
days prior to any elective invasive oral/dental procedure.  Investigational product administration will be 
withheld until documented evidence of complete mucosal healing following any invasive oral/dental 
procedure. 
Participants  that miss >2 doses of scheduled denosumab, regardless of cause, will discontinue study 
agent and proceed with end of treatment procedures.
There  will be no dose modifications for toxicity during this study.
23. END OF  TREATMENT PROCEDURES
Vital signs (Blood pressure,  pulse);
Blood and  urine samples for banking (research)
Review  concomitant medications;

Approved: 3/3/2021
Expi[INVESTIGATOR_5952]: 3/2/2022
Stony Brook University Human Subjects Committee (IRB)
Page 21 of 23Denosumab is  a fully human monoclonal IgG2 antibody that binds with high affinity and specificity to RANK 
ligand (Kd 3 x 10-12 M). This binding prevents the activation of RANK and inhibits the formation, activation, and 
survival of osteoclasts, the result of which is a reduction in the number and function of osteoclasts and, 
consequently, a decrease in bone resorption and an increase in cortical and trabecular bone mass, volume, and 
strength. Denosumab is highly specific because it binds only to RANK ligand and does not bind to other members 
of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, including TNFα, TNFβ,  TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, or CD40 
ligand. Denosumab has an approximate molecular weight of 147kDa and is produced in genetically engineered 
mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells.  Denosumab will be supplied as a sterile, clear, colorless to slightly 
yellow, preservative-free liquid, in single-use 3.0 mL glass vials containing a deliverable dose of 1.7 mL. .
  
26.2 Availability  
Denosumab is  available as 120mg/1.7mL in single-use vials and will be obtained from the Stony Brook Cancer 
Center Pharmacy and supplied by [CONTACT_11337].  Study agent will be stored in the Stony Brook Cancer Center 
Pharmacy. Denosumab is a clear, colorless to pale yellow solution that may contain trace amounts of translucent 
to white proteinaceous particles.  Prior to administration, denosumab will be removed from the refrigerator and 
brought to room temperature by [CONTACT_773289].  A 27-gauge needle will be used to withdraw 
and inject the entire contents of the vial subcutaneously into the upper arm, upper thigh, or abdomen of the 
subjects.

28. ADMINISTRATIVE  CONSIDERATIONS
28.[ADDRESS_1061814] Review 
The study protocol  will be activated after review and approval by [CONTACT_773291]’s Human Subjects Protection Program (IRB). Approval of this protocol by [CONTACT_773292], or Informed Consent Form (ICF) and the 
accompanying HIPAA consenting instrument. 
28.[ADDRESS_1061815] ensured that participants are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential 
risks and any other critical issues regarding this clinical trial.
28.4 Data  Management and Safety Monitoring 
Participant safety  and data integrity will be monitored by [CONTACT_773293]’s Data Safety and 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) in conjunction with the Quality Assurance/Quality Control Program (QA/QC). The 
Protocol Review Committee approval letter, which states the frequency of data review, is attached in Appendix 
8.
Prior to  study registration, a review of the potential participant’s eligibility will include a confirmation of the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and proper execution of informed consent. All participants registered to this study will 
be entered into the Stony Brook Cancer Center database for accrual and treatment status tracking. In addition, 
a registration log will be maintained utilizing the pre-prepared form to keep track of study number, verification of 
consent, date of consent, and other relevant registration data. Electronic Case Report Forms (CRFs) will be 
utilized. All participant study files will be stored in a secure area limited to authorized staff.
The Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_89018], completeness and timeliness of the data reported in these 
forms. Source documentation supporting the CRF data should indicate the participant’s participation in the trial 
and should document the dates and details of study procedures, adverse events, and participant status.

29. DATA SAFETY AND  MONITORING PLAN
29.1 Protocol  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan and Risk Level Designation.  
29.1.1 Risk  Level.  
This trial  has been designated as a medium risk study. Medium risk studies are intended to include all trials 
involving therapeutic intervention(s), which are not designated as high risk per NCI and the IND is not held by 
[CONTACT_093]. 
29.1.2 Identification  of the DSMC obligated for oversight responsibilities: 
The Stony  Brook Cancer Center Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will provide ongoing oversight 
for this trial semi-annually. In addition, the investigators will convene an ad hoc DSMC comprised of Alexander 
Stessin MD, PhD, a radiation oncologist with expertise in breast cancer, a statistician (Erin Taub), and will be 
chaired by [CONTACT_773294], MD, PhD, an endocrinologist with expertise in osteoporosis and hypocalcemia. The ad 
hoc DSMC will initially convene after 10% of the projected accrual, or 4 patients, complete protocol therapy, and 
thereafter annually.  While no formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_773267], accrual to the study will be 
suspended if 2 or more patients experience grade 3 or higher hypocalcemia or ONJ events. In the unlikely event 
that this occurs, the DSMC will be convened to review all safety data and make recommendations for either 
continuing the study with additional safety measures or terminating the study altogether. A dental expert will be 
added to the committee if 2 or more potential ONJ events are observed.
29.1.3 Identification  of the entity obligated for routine monitoring duties 
Routine monitoring  will be provided by [CONTACT_89031]/Quality Control (QA/QC) Program to ensure that 
the investigation is conducted according to protocol design and regulatory requirements. 
29.1.[ADDRESS_1061816]  routine monitoring visit will include at a minimum
Informed  consent cases enrolled, according to PRMC policy; 
Participant  eligibility, up to two participants, according to PRMC policy;
Data  review, up to two participants, according to PRMC policy.
All subsequent  monitoring visits will consist of randomly selected participant cases based on current enrollment 
and include continuing review of previously selected cases, as applicable.  A monitoring visit report and follow-
up letter will be completed within two weeks of the routine monitoring visit; a copy will be maintained in the study 
file. A query/finding form will also be completed by [CONTACT_89032], 
clarification, information or corrections to the CRF and/or regulatory records. The Clinical Research Coordinator 
or other applicable staff responsible for the study will be given a copy of this form for resolution of 
queries/findings. The query/finding form will be maintained with a copy of the visit report for follow-up at the next 
monitoring visit. 
The Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_89018], completeness, legibility and timeliness of the data reported 
in the Case Report Form (CRF). Source documentation supporting the CRF data should indicate the participant’s 
participation in the trial and should document the dates and details of study procedures, adverse events, and 
participant status. Case report forms, which include the inclusion/exclusion criteria form, adverse event forms 
and serious adverse event forms should be completed with a black ball-point pen or typed. Corrections to the 
forms should not obscure the original entry and should be made by [CONTACT_89033] a single 
line. Each strike should be accompanied by [CONTACT_89034]. All participant 
forms and study files will be stored in a secure area limited to authorized staff. Note: Routine monitoring of 
regulatory documents and test article will be conducted at least annually. A process to implement study closure 
when significant risks or benefits is in place.

Page 21 of 2330. DESCRIPTION  AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
Serious adverse events (SAEs)  and adverse events (AEs) will be monitored and discussed routinely using 
procedures described below. Cumulative SAE review is performed by [CONTACT_773295]. This review not only identifies individual events but also identifies any patterns of adverse events in 
Investigator initiated trials. If there is concern for excessive risk/toxicity identified by [CONTACT_4318], the Committee 
may recommend suspension of accrual or study closure.
All SAEs (Death, A  life-threatening adverse drug experience, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect.) must be 
reported to [COMPANY_010] Drug Safety within [ADDRESS_1061817] be recorded on an SAE Report form and faxed to [COMPANY_010] at: [COMPANY_010] 
Global Safety Fax:  [PHONE_4999].
30.1   Adverse Events 
An adverse  event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product. 
Any adverse  events grade 2, or greater, will be recorded on the adverse events record form and reviewed by [CONTACT_1268].
Adverse events  will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
Version 5 
(https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_Reference_5x7.
pdf)
And will  address:
Grade
Relationship to study  drug(not related, unlikely, possible, probable, definitely) 
Causality  other than study drug (disease related, concomitant medication related, intercurrent illness, other)  
Date  of onset, date of resolution
Frequency  of event (single, intermittent, continuous)
Event  outcome (resolved, ongoing, death)
Action  taken (none, held, dose reduced, discontinued, medication given)
30.2   Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse  event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
Results  in death; 
Is  life-threatening;
A  new cancer
Requires  in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89019]; 
Results  in persistent disability or significant disability/incapacity, or:
Is  a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Note: A  SAE may also be an important medical event, in the view of the investigator that requires medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Serious adverse events  will be captured beginning on Day [ADDRESS_1061818] dose of study agent. 
All serious  adverse events, regardless of attribution, and any deaths will be reported within 24 hours of 
notification of the event to the DSMB Coordinator and to [COMPANY_010]. All SAEs which meet the criteria for a reportable

Page [ADDRESS_1061819] meet all three of the following criteria:
Unanticipated  or unexpected in nature, frequency or severity, AND
Related  or possibly related to participation in the research (there is a reasonable possibility that it is 
related), AND
The  event suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm than was 
previously known or recognized (not already referenced in existing study documents, such as the 
protocol, consent form or Investigator’s Brochure).
All serious adverse  events will be processed by [CONTACT_773296], every six months. The DSMB coordinator will review the SAE reporting process to 
confirm reporting requirements are met.  
30.4   Plan for assuring data accuracy and protocol compliance 
Routine study  activity and safety information will be reported to the DSMB every six months, or more frequently 
if requested. These reports will include:
Study  activity, cumulative and for the period under review;
Safety (narrative description  on non-serious and serious adverse events);
Predetermined  protocol early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_89020]/futility;   
Monitoring  and protocol compliance;
Comments
Attachments  (AE data reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_89021], SAE letters and reports, results of any 
review(s), applicable correspondence with the IRB or other regulatory agencies. 
Data,  safety and study progress will be reported to:
Human Subjects Protection  Program (IRB) at least annually;
SAEs will  be reported to the Sponsor ([COMPANY_010]) every 90 days.
Pregnancy :  The investigators must report pregnancy of a subject participating in the clinical trial to 
[COMPANY_010]’s global  Pregnancy Surveillance Program within [ADDRESS_1061820] to be provided as new information becomes available.  The [COMPANY_010] 
Pharmacovigilance Program will seek to follow the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy and her 
baby [CONTACT_8622] 12 months after the birth.   
The  PI [INVESTIGATOR_89022], in writing, the funding agency, if applicable, any action resulting in a 
temporary or permanent suspension of the study.
30.5   Additional Adverse Events Reporting 
All SAEs  which meet the criteria for a reportable event will be reported to the Stony Brook University IRB and to 
the Sponsor within 10 working days of the event date or receipt of notification of the event.  
31. PARTICIPANT  PAYMENT
Biopsies will be  compensated with $100, and MRIs with $25, for a maximum total of $250 for participants 
undergoing MRI and biopsies, or $100 for MRI-only participants. Participants will not receive more than $100 
per visit, i.e. when an MRI and a biopsy are done on the same day. When biopsies and MRIs are scheduled on 
different days, participants can receive 2 separate payments of $100 and $25 respectively.

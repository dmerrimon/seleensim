Study Protocol and Analysis Plan  
Fixed Versus Weight -Based Enoxaparin Dosing in Thoracic Surgery Patients  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
June 19, 2020  
  
Study Design  
Inclusion criteria were thoracic surgery patients, surgery under general anesthesia, and prophylactic 
enoxaparin initiation within 24 hours.  Exclusion criteria were creatinine >1.6mg/dL, planned 
postoperative admission <3 days, epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810], history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia, known 
bleeding issue, weight >150kg, or recent stroke or intracranial bleeding event.  Most open thoracic 
surgery patients at both sites receive concomitant epi[INVESTIGATOR_24686]; this biased our sample toward the 
video -assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS) population.  Patients provided written informed consent.  
 
The study was designed prospectively as a pre/post trial to examine the impact of a change in practice (a 
switch from fixed dose to weight tiered enoxaparin).  Cohort 1 accrued between September 21, 2017 and 
May 8, 2018, and all patients received fixed dos e enoxaparin prophylaxis at 40mg once daily.  Cohort 2 
was planned as weight based at 0.5mg/kg, and recruitment began on May 9, 2018.  Both sites encountered 
insurmountable issues with pharmacist dose rounding.  Nine patients in the 0.5mg/kg group who rece ived 
rounded doses were dropped.  Cohort 2 was revised to weight -tiered, daily enoxaparin 15.  Patients <70kg 
received 30mg, patients 70kg to 89.9kg received 40mg, and patients ≥90kg received 50mg.  Cohort [ADDRESS_491172] dose.  Goal p eak aFXa (0.3 -0.5 IU/mL) was chosen to maximize VTE risk 
reduction while minimizing bleeding 12,19.  All patients with identified out -of-range levels received dose 
adjustment and repeat aFXa levels per Figure 2.  The algorithm targeted peak aFXa levels because low 
peak aFXa h as been associated with symptomatic 90 -day VTE 9, because aFXa -driven dose adjustment is 
impactful 8, and because a recent review showed that ~80% of studies targeted peak aFXa 19,20.  Dose 
adjustment was performed until an in -range peak level was achieved, or until time of discharge.   
 
Patients received enoxaparin prophylaxis for the duration of inpatient stay.  Post -discharge enoxaparin 
prophylaxis was not routinely provided; when giv en, patients were discharged on a pharmacokinetically 
optimized dose.   
 
Study Outcomes  
The primary effectiveness outcome was adequate peak aFXa (≥0.3 IU/mL), chosen because patients 
receiving enoxaparin 40mg once daily with initial peak aFXa <0.3 IU/mL ar e at elevated risk for 90 -day 
symptomatic VTE 9.  The primary safety outcome was avoidance of over -anticoagulation (peak aFXa 
≥0.5 IU/mL), which could incr ease risk for bleeding.   
 
Secondary outcomes included 1) achievement of adequate trough aFXa level (aFXa ≥0.1 IU/mL), because 
low aFXa trough increases asymptomatic DVT risk 11, 2) 90 -day symptomatic VTE, and 3) [ADDRESS_491173] Physicians guidelines 2.  Clinically relevant bleeding 
was defined as any bleeding that changed the course of care 21; this included bleeding requiring 
enoxaparin cessation, unexpected transfusion, or procedural (interventional radiology or operating room) 
intervention.  Chart review and mandatory phone calls at 90 days identified events that occurred at other 
facilities; when identified, records were obtained for confirmation.   
 
Analysis plan  
Study data were uploaded to a secure, online Research Electronic Dat a Capture platform.   
 
Descriptive statistics compared patient level factors including individual VTE risk using the [ADDRESS_491174] to followup and the censoring rate of this survival analysis was zero.   
 
Sample size calculation  
Historical data showed that the two institutions admitted 14 eligible patients monthly.   Similar studies 
showed that high proportions ( ~99%) of patients consented and 70% of these would produce primary 
outcome data 8,9,14.  We estimated that 116 patients (58 per group) could be consented within the planned 
12 month study period.   
 
We assumed 32.6% of thoracic surgery patients receiving enoxaparin 40mg once daily would have 
adequate anticoagulation  (peak aFXa level ≥0.3 IU/mL) 8, and that 82% of patients would have adequate 
anticoagulation in response to once daily weight -tiered enoxaparin dosing, based on data from women 
having caesarean section 15.  Using alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_491175] 23 patients per group would be 
required.  Thus, anticipated recruitment exceeded the minimum number of required patients.    
 
Based on existing trials data from thoracic surge ry patients receiving enoxaparin 40mg once daily 8, low 
(~1%) rates of 90 -day VTE and bleeding were anticipated.  Thus, it was impossible to adequately power 
the study for a clinical endpoint.

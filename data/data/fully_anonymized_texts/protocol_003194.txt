 1.1 Primary Objective: To establish the progression free survival rate at [ADDRESS_1203824] criteria, to TPF  followed by [CONTACT_863314]  
 1.2 Secondary Objectives : To e valuate  complete response rates, safety and 
feasibility of TFP=> chemoxrt in patients with NPC  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
Backgro und for the rationale of TPF=> chemoradiation  
2.1 Nasopharyngeal cancer   
Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC)  is a significant problem worldwide. The  annual incidence 
rate worldwide is  1.8/100,000  and the rate climbs to as high as 50/100,000 in Southern  
China .1 
2.2 CHEMORADIATION VERSUS RADIATION  
Historically, nonmetastatic NPC  has been treated with radiation alone. Because of the 
known chemosensitivity of NPC, a series of randomized controlled trials of 
chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy conducted in the 1990’s and early 2000’s 
demonstrated that in patients with advanced loc al or regional disease, the addition of 
chemotherapy to radiation was associated with a statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful survival advantage. 5 6, 7  A smal ler subsequent trial suggested that even in the 
case of patients with advanced local disease but minimal nodal disease (T3 -4, N0 -1), 
patients  had increased local control with the use of combined chemotherapy and 
accelerated fractionation radiation versus conventional radiation alone.  [ADDRESS_1203825] data supporting either an OS or LRC advantage of 
chemoradiation versus radiation:  
From IJROBP Volume 66, Number 1, 2006 p 150 8: 
 
 
IRB-[ADDRESS_1203826], the chemotherapy combined cisplatin – based chemotherapy with 
XRT, with cisplatin dosing plans including 40 mg/m2 weekly to 100 mg/m2  every 3 
weeks to 20mg/m2/d x 4 with co ncurrent 5FU infusion every 3 weeks. In the US 
intergroup study, an additional 3 cycles of cisplatin 80  mg/m2 plus 5FU 1000mg/m2/d x 
4 days was planned, to be administered after radiation had been completed.  
A common theme to all of these recipes is that i n all cases cumulative dose of concurrent 
cisplatin exceeded 180mg/m2. However, in the US intergroup trial, where 300 mg/m2 ( 
three 100 mg/m2 doses) was the intent, only 63% of the patients received three cycles of 
CDDP. In the Chan et al. trial in which C DDP was administered weekly to an anticipated 
total of 240 mg/m2, 95% of the patients were compliant with the plan.  9 Therefore, while 
the optimal c oncurrent CDDP dosing schedule has yet to be defined, it appears that 
weekly dosing is more tolerable and in many cases dosing beyond a cumulative dose of 
200-240 mg/m2 is not feasible.  Additionally, of the [ADDRESS_1203827] of the patients 
randomized to that arm received no adjuvant treatment. Therefore, since all 3 RCTs 
showed an overall  survival advantage for patients with advanced disease, it is not clear 
that adjuvant PF has benefit beyond concurrent chemoradiation, nor is it clear that 
administration of PF after chemoradiation is feasible.   
2.3 Adjuvant versus neoadjuvant  (or inducti on) chemotherapy  
The rationale behind administration of adjuvant PF in the intergroup trial was that the 
additional chemotherapy might reduce the number of distant relapses and therefore offer 
benefit beyond the concurrent treatment. However, a comparison of the outcome of the 
US intergroup versus the Chan and Lin trials suggests that the reduction in the 
development of distant metastasis was approximately 30 to 50% in patients with 
advanced disease on all of these trials. Therefore the benefit of adjuvant PF on this basis 
is also questionable. Again, this may be because so few patients in the US intergroup 
study were able to receive meaningful doses of PF after chemoradiation.  
Initial studies of induction chemotherapy added to radiation alone in NPC patient s failed 
to show disease control or survival benefit.  [ADDRESS_1203828] designed to definitively answer the question concerning the 
possible benefit of the addition of PF induction chemotherapy to concurrent 
chemoradiation in patients with NPC. Lee et al. of the Hong Kong Nasopharyng eal 
Cancer Study Group  are conducting a trial whose primary endpoint is a comparison of 
induction chemotherapy with Cisplatin + 5 -Fluorouracil versus adjuvant chemotherapy 
with Cisplatin + 5 -Fluororacil (PF -P vs P -PF) in the setting of concurrent chemorad iation 
as a backbone. This trial opened in September 2006 and is planning to enroll 798 patients 
with an estimated completion date of September 2013. See web site ClinicalTrials.gov, 
Identifier:  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED].  Feng et al. of the Taiwan National Health Resea rch Institutes 
opened in 2003 a multicenter Phase III Trial Comparing Induction Mitomycin, 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962], Cisplatin, Fluorouracil, and Leucovorin Chemotherapy Followed by 
[CONTACT_863315] (NPC), based on 5 year OS of 70% and 5 year distant 
metastasis rate of 81% in a phase 2 trial. 12 See ClinicalTrials.gov identifier   
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]. This [ADDRESS_1203829] every study is associated with the same survival and better 
tolerability.  13 14-18 
A randomized controlled trial of patients with SCCHN compared weekly carboplatin 
(100 mg/m2/dose x 4) with daily low dose cisplatin (4mg/m2/dose, cumulative dose 64 
mg/m2) , both concurrently administered with definitive radiation ( 65Gy). Both local 
control and overall survival were numerically superior in the carboplatin arm, but OS d id 
not reach statistical significance because of the size of the trial, [ADDRESS_1203830] US intergroup concurrent plus adjuvant chemoradiation was 
compared to an identical radiation plan with carboplatin 100mg/m2 weekly instead of 
concurrent cisplatin, and carboplatin AUC5 instead of cisplatin in the adjuva nt setting.  20 
There was no difference in overall survival or disease free survival. Toxicity was 
markedly less in the carboplatin arm, and over twice as many p atients in the carboplatin 
arm (62 versus 26%) completed all intended chemotherapy treatment.  
2.[ADDRESS_1203831] active anti - cancer agents available for squamous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck, with single agent response rates of 40% or higher 
reported in patients with prior platinum exposure.  21, [ADDRESS_1203832] of 
the addition of a taxane to the “ backbone” PF induction regimen as part of a curative 
chemoradiation plan have demonstrated that overall survival with TPF is superior to PF 
when used as induction chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_863316].  23 24, 25 
Paradoxically, the three drug combination (taxane, platinum, 5 -FU) has been associated 
with a superior QOL than the two drug combination (platinum, 5 -FU).  This is probably 
because the dose of infusional 5 -FU, which induces severe gastro intestinal toxicity, was 
reduced in all versions of the three drug regimen tested. These results let the FDA to 
recently (9/28/07) approve the use of docetaxel explicitly in combination with cisplatin 
and 5 -fluorouracil for induction therapy of locally adv anced squamous cell carcinoma of 
the head and neck (SCCHN) before patients undergo chemoradiotherapy and surgery. [ADDRESS_1203833] 20% two year survival improvement over PF in this setting. 27 
This strategy of using a taxane and cisplatin combination is beginning to be tested in 
NPC. The combination of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2 achieved a 
response rate of 63% in patients with metastatic NPC 28and when docetaxel has been 
combined with PF as induction chemotherapy for NPC patients in early phase 1 and 2 
trials, response rates approaching 100% have been seen . 29-32 
2.6 Radiation and NPC  
For many years, two -dimensional radiation therapy (2DRT) was considered the standard 
of care for patients with locally advanced NPC. Because 2DRT delivers substantial 
radiation doses to the parotid glands, permanent sev ere xerostomia is a common side 
effect.  Radiation doses as low as [ADDRESS_1203834] cases, osteoradionecrosis. 48 49. 
In addition to the parotid glands, there are multiple critical normal tissues surrounding the 
nasopharynx, such as the optic structures, the tempo ral lobes and the brain stem, all of 
which are highly sensitive to radiation injury. The location of such structures precludes 
dose escalation with 2DRT.  Therefore, despi[INVESTIGATOR_863304], the local 
control rates for the more advanced T3/T4 tumors were typi[INVESTIGATOR_4942] 40 -60% 
for 2DRT. 50, 51 52 38, 53 With the introduction of three - dimensional radiation therapy 
(3DRT) and more recently intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), superior tumor 
coverage was a chieved without exceeding the radiation tolerance to surrounding critical 
structures.54-[ADDRESS_1203835] reported dec reased rates of xerostomia in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) 
patients treated with IMRT60, 61, [ADDRESS_1203836] mature IMRT clinical data came from UCSF60 The 4 -year local progression -free 
and regional progression -free rates for 67 loco -regional advanced NPC patients were 
97% and 98%, respectively. An update with more patients (n=118), continued to show 
excellent locoregional control. [ADDRESS_1203837] shown 
similar findings. 61, 65 A recent exper ience from MSKCC reported a 91% locoregional 
control rate for IMRT treated NPC with a median follow -up of 35 months. 62 The RTOG 
completed a phase II trial of IMRT with or without chemotherapy for non -stage IVC 
NPC. Preliminary data showed decreased xerostomia when compared to historical RTOG 
trials where conventional RT was used. (Lee N, ASTRO procee dings 2007). Based on 
these results, we propose to use IMRT using the dose and fractionation schedule (70.2 Gy 
over 6.5 weeks) that has been pi[INVESTIGATOR_863305].   
2.7 Rationale  
Please see the background section for the scientific and clinical basis for this trial. 
Briefly, this trial is intended to ask several questions concerning a new treatment 
paradigm for patients with locoregionally advanced NPC. While many of the que stions 
posed will only be definitively answerable in larger controlled trials, there is a need to 
generate preliminary data supporting the below hypotheses before there will be adequate 
enthusiasm for dedicating the resources of a multi -institutional, mult i-national effort to 
ask the questions which would definitively address these questions.  
Hypothesis which this trial will address:

 Sequential TPF=> chemoradiation will be associated with a higher complete response 
rate than the present US standar d of care for this group of patients with NPC,

5.3  Radiation therapy treatment plan:  
 
5.3.1 Concurrent cisplatin, and radiation:  
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 13 of 56 5 December  2016  Radiation Therapy : 70 Gy at 2.0 -2.12 Gy/fraction in 6.5 -7 weeks delivered with either 3 -
dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) or intensity modu lated radiotherapy 
(IMRT).  
 
5.3.2   Radiation Therapy  (See also Appendix B– Radiation  Quality Assurance form)  
Allowable treatment approaches include a 3DCRT approach or an IMRT.  
Dose specification:  
 Two different RT dose prescriptions are allowed:  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Integrated dose prescription  
PTV 70 (planning target volume 70): [GTV (gross target volume) + margin]: will receive 
70 Gy at 2.12 Gy/fraction for 33 fractions.  
PTV high risk  [CTV high risk  (clinical target volume high risk) + margin]: the areas of high risk,  
sub-clinical disease will receive between 56 -59.4 Gy (at the discretion of the treating 
physician) at 1.7 -1.8 Gy/fraction for 33 fractions.  
PTV low risk  (CTV low risk  + margin): The area of low risk, subclinical disease, which is 
predominantly the uninvolve d low necks, will receive 5 2 Gy at 1. 57 Gy/fraction.  
Alternatively, the uninvolved low neck can be treated with a conventional AP or APPA 
supraclavicular field to a total dose of [ADDRESS_1203853] for the APPA field. The junction between the IMRT or 3DCRT fields and the 
low-neck fields will be dependent on the institutional IMRT techniques; however, each 
institution is requi red to record the dosimetric details at the match -line to ensure dose 
homogeneity and to prevent overdosing of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sequential dose prescription : 
PTV 70 (planning target volume 70): [GTV (gross target volume) + margin]: will receive 
70 Gy at 2.0 Gy/fraction for 35 fractions.  
PTV high risk  [CTV high risk  (clinical target volume high risk) + margin] ( optional ): the areas 
of high risk, sub -clinical disease will receive 60 Gy at 2 Gy/fraction for 30 fractions.  
PTV low risk  (CTV low risk  + margin ): The area of low risk, subclinical disease, which is 
predominantly the uninvolved low necks, will receive 50 Gy at 2 Gy/fraction in [ADDRESS_1203854] for the APPA field. The junction between the IMRT or 3DCRT 
fields and the low -neck fi elds will be dependent on the institutional IMRT techniques; 
however, each institution is required to record the dosimetric details at the match -line to 
ensure dose homogeneity and to prevent overdosing of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Compliance  
The repor ted dose for each PTV should include the prescribed dose, maximal point dose, 
mean dose, the % of PTV that receive > 110%, > 115% and < 93% of the prescribed 
dose.  
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 14 of 56 5 December  2016  All plans should be normalized so that > 95% of the PTV 70 receives the prescribed dose.  
In addition, no more than 20% of the PTV 70 will receive > 110 % and no more than 5% 
will receive > 115%  
RT will be given as once daily fraction. The first RT treatment should begin on Monday, 
Tuesday or Wednesday.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Technical factors  
External beam equ ipment and beam delivery methods  
Megavoltage equipments capable of delivering 3DCRT or IMRT (either static or 
dynamic) are required.  
Treatment planning, imaging and localization requirement  
The immobilization device should include at least the head and ne ck.  It is strongly 
encouraged that the participation centers also utilize shoulder immobilization especially 
when comprehensive nodal IMRT is utilized.  
Treatment planning CT scan will be required to delineate the GTV, CTV and PTV.  
Other imaging studies such as MRI and PET -CT scans can aid in volume delineation.  
The treatment planning CT scan should be acquired with the patient immobilized in the 
same treatment position.  All tissue irradiated should be included in the treatment 
planning CT scan, which s hould be < 3 mm slice thickness through the regions 
containing the GTV.  Thicker slices (up to 5 mm) may be used for region above or below 
the GTV; however, thicker slices may compromise the image quality of the digitally 
reconstructed radiographs (DRR)  
Treatment planning/target volumes  
The definition of the target volumes should conform to the 1993 ICRU report #50;  
Gross target volume (GTV):  All known gross disease determined from clinical (including 
endoscopic) and imaging findings.  Grossly involved node s are defined as any lymph 
node > [ADDRESS_1203855] or MRI in the minimal cross -sectional diameter, any nodes with 
increased metabolic uptake on FDG PET scan, any node with central necrosis and/or 
radiographic evidence of extracapsular extension regardless of siz e. 
Clinical target volume (CTV):  
CTV 70: For grossly positive node, a margin of 5 mm should be added circumferentially to 
account for microscopic extracapsular extension  
CTV high risk : should include all regions deemed to be at high risk for microscopic dis ease, 
all potential routes of spread, and the high risk nodal regions.  
CTV low risk : nodal regions at low risk for microscopic involvement.  This usually 
constitutes the clinically and radiographically low -neck nodes.  
Planning target volume : A margin shoul d be used to account for intrafraction and 
interfraction set up variability.  The average recommended PTV margin is 5 mm; 
however, it will depend on the accuracy of treatment set up and immobilization at each 
individual treatment site.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Pl an 
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 15 of 56 5 December  2016  Treatment plan will be based on the analysis of the volumetric dose, including dose -
volume histogram (DVH) analyses of the PTVs and critical normal structures.  A 3D or 
an “inverse” planning using computerized optimization should be used.  The treatment  
aim will be the delivery of radiation to the PTVs and the exclusion of non -involved 
tissues. HETEROGENEITY CORRECTION SHOULD BE USED . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Critical structures  
Surrounding critical normal structures, including the brainstem, temporal lobes (if the 
tumor  is near the skull base), spi[INVESTIGATOR_188815], optic nerves, eyes, optic chiasm, parotid 
glands, the inner and middle ears (if the targets are near by), oral cavity, mandible and 
glottic larynx should be outlined.  If there is grossly involved tumor in the low ne ck, then 
the brachial plexus should also be delineated.  
Unspecified tissues, defined as the tissues within the skin, subtracted all target volumes 
and delineated normal tissues, should also be taken into account of the treatment planning 
and evaluation.  N o more than 5% of the unspecified tissue can receive > 70 Gy and no 
more than 1% or 1 cc of this tissue can receive >= 77 Gy.  Participants are strongly 
encouraged to remain within these limits.  
Dose constraints for certain normal tissues are shown in the following table.  
Table 1: Required critical structure dose constraints  
Structure  Maximal dose 
(Gy)  
Brainstem  [ADDRESS_1203856]  45 
Optic nerves  54 
Optic chiasms  54 
Eyes  50 
Mandible  70 
Brachial plexus  66 
Table  2: Suggested normal structure dose constrai nts 
Structure  Mean dose (Gy)  
Parotid  < 26 for 1 gland or < 30 for 50% of 1 gland or < 20 
for 20 cc volume of both glands  
Oral cavity  < 40 if tumors outside the oral cavity  
Inner/middle ear  < 45 or < 5% volume receives > 55 Gy  
Glottic larynx  < 50 for tu mor outside the larynx and hypopharynx  
Esophagus/post cricoid 
pharynx  < 50 for tumor outside the larynx and hypopharynx  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Documentation requirements : 
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 16 of 56 5 December  2016  Weekly verification of orthogonal films through the treatment isocenter is required.  If 
the IMRT  or 3DCRT fields are matched to an AP supraclavicular field, then the 
supraclavicular field should also be included during weekly portal verification. Appendix 
B is the radiation quality assurance form that should be submitted at the completion 
of radiatio n therapy . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Radiation adverse events and allowed interruption  
Radiation adverse events will be graded as per CTCAE v4.0.  RT interruption may be 
necessary due to severe acute RT - related reactions such as severe skin or mucosal 
reaction or any othe r acute complications.  Interruptions will be left at the discretion of 
the treating physicians but strongly discouraged.  The cause of interruption should be 
recorded.   
Placement of feeding gastrostomy tube may be necessary for nutritional support in thi s 
frail population. The date and reason for placement of a feeding gastrostomy tube (either 
prophylactic in preparation for RT or for active nutritional support due to significant 
weight loss before or during RT) should also be recorded.  The duration of f eeding tube 
dependence after completion of RT should also be recorded.

and subsequently per local standards of care.  
 
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFIC ATIONS  
Doses will be modified in case of severe hematological and/or non -hematological 
toxicities. Dose adjustments are to be made according to the CTCAE v [ADDRESS_1203858] degree of toxicity. Toxicities will be graded using the CTCAE v 4 criteria.

subsequent cycles, patient  will go off TPF therapy  
 
Action Taken for other Docetaxel AEs  
Mucositis oral   
 If mucositis oral  is present on day 1 of any cycle, treatment should be withheld until 
resolved.  
 If Grade 3/4 mucositis oral  occurs at any time, the dose of Docetaxel should  be reduced 
for subsequent cycles, Docetaxel dose will be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m²  
 
Peripheral  motor Neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy  
Docetaxel dose will be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m² for Grade 2 neuropathies without 
treatment delay.  
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 18 of 56 5 December  2016  Treatment should be discontinued for Grade 3/4 neuropathies.  
 
Dermatological/ Skin  
Grade 0,  1, and 2 : no change  
Grade 3: Delay until < grade 1 and retreat with a dose reduction of Docetaxel from 75 to

therapy.  
Grade 4 : The patient will go off chemotherapy.  
 
Nausea and/or vomiting  
Prophylactic antiemetic regimen with [ADDRESS_1203860] cycle. In addition, the corticosteroids used duri ng 3 days for the prophylaxis of fluid 
retention should also reduce the incidence and severity of emesis.  
Patients with nausea and vomiting despi[INVESTIGATOR_863308] (i.e. high dose metochlopramide) as appropria te.

total bilirubin is ≤ ULN (maximum 2 weeks), then re -treat at a reduced dose.  
**Reduced doses of Docetaxel will be at 60mg/m2. After Docetaxel is dose is reduced, 
there will be no re -escalation. There will be only one dose reduction.  
#  If alkaline phosphatase is clinically related to local bone erosion, for purposes of 
docetaxel dose reductions, consider alk phos < ULN, i.e. dose adjust based on other 
clinical and lab parameters . 
 
6.2 CISPLATIN  and CARBOPLATIN dose modifications:  
Cisplatin dose reductions during TPF  for hematologic adverse events:  
There will be no planned CDDP dose reductions for ANC or platelet AEs. See Docetaxel 
section for dose reduction and TPF delay and dis continuance parameters for ANC and 
platelet AEs.  Note that after one reduction in docetaxel for hematological AEs, high 
grade persistent or recurrent AEs will result in discontinuance of TPF per the algorithm 
outlined for docetaxel dose modification.

experiences AEs as defined above, discontinue CDDP or carboplatin.  
 
Cisplatin  or carboplatin dose reductions during concurrent radiation for non - 
hematological toxicities:  
Concurrent platinum  and radiation for patients with nasopharyngeal cancer is known to 
be associated with a high rate of severe locoregional toxicity including severe mucositis  
oral, skin breakdown,  nausea, and presence of thick copi[INVESTIGATOR_863306] , often 
complicated by [CONTACT_863321].  Patients commonly are not able to adequately aliment or hydrate themselves 
orally during chemoradiation and for several weeks afterwards.  Every effort should be 
made to manage patient symptomatically using IV hydration, and clinicians are 
STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to have prophylactic gastrostomy feeding tubes placed 
prior to initiation of treatment.   Severe mucositis oral and skin breakdown in the radiation 
field  based on ulceration and superficial bleeding should not be considered inherently 
dose limiting.  
Radiation associated mucositis  oral  or dermatitis:  
Grade 4: hold CDDP or carboplatin until resolution to grade 3 then dose reduce by [CONTACT_23615]. Ther e will be no dose reductions below dose level minus 2.  In  the case that a 
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 22 of 56 5 December  2016  patient is being treated at dose level minus 2, once AEs are grade 3 or less, the patient 
should be treated again at dose level minus 2.  
Peripheral motor Neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy  
Grade 0,  1: no change  
Grade > 2: Carboplatin may be substituted for Cisplatin  Should a new grade > 2 
peripheral motor/sensory neuropathy develop on carboplatin, hold carboplatin until 
resolution to grade [ADDRESS_1203864] cisplatin . Should  new grade > 2 ototoxicity develop on carboplatin, hold 
carboplatin until resolution to grade 2 then dose reduce 1 level.  
Creatini ne 
Grade 1 (creatinine <1.5): no CDDP dose change  
Grade 2 (creatinine > 1.5 -3):   
First incidence decrease one dose level, consider change to carboplatin.  
Second incidence: switch to carboplatin.  
Grade 3 -4 (creatinine >3): discontinue CDDP, switch to carb oplatin.  Should a new grade 
> 2 creatinine develop on carboplatin, hold carboplatin until resolution to grade 2 then 
dose reduce 1 level.  
Non- hematological  AEs attributable to CDDP  or carboplatin excluding AEs 
discussed above : 
Grade 1 -2 : No dose change of CDDP or carboplatin.  
Grade 3 -4: Hold  CDDP or carboplatin until resolution of AEs to grade 2 or less, then 
dose reduce by [CONTACT_30560]. There will be no dose reductions below dose level minus 
2.  In  the case that a patient is being treated at dose le vel minus 2, once AEs resolve to 
grade 2 or less, the patient should be treated again at dose level minus 2.

In the case of severe diarrhea, octreotide is recommended. If the patient has a significant 
diarrhea occurrence again (> 3 loose stools/24 hr), the patient should be trea ted 
prophylactically in the subsequent cycles with 2 tablets of loperamide or diphenoxylate in 
addition to 1 or 2 tablets after each loose stool. The maximum daily dose of Loperamide 
is 16mg and Diphenoxylate is 20mg/day.

8. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the commercial agents 
administered in this study can be found in Section 7.1.  
8.1 Commercial Agent(s)  
8.1.1 Docetaxel - (Commercially available. Please  refer to the package insert for further 
information)  
Other Names Taxotere, RP [ZIP_CODE], NSC #628503. Classification: Antimicrotubule agent.  
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 26 of 56 5 December  2016  Mode of Action: Docetaxel, a semisynthetic analog of paclitaxel, pro motes the assembly 
of tubulin and inhibits microtubule depolymerization. Bundles of microtubules 
accumulate and  interfere with cell division.  
 
Storage and Stability:  
Docetaxel infusion solution, if stored between 2 and 25ºC (36 and 77ºF) is stable  
for 4 ho urs. Fully prepared docetaxel infusion solution (in either 0.9% Sodium  
Chloride solution or 5% Dextrose solution) should be used within 4 hours  (including the 
administration time).  Store between 2 and 25°C (36 and 77ºF). Retain in the original package 
toprotect from bright light. Freezing does not adversely affect the product.  
 
Preparation:  
Docetaxel is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and, as with other potentially toxic  compounds, caution 
should be exercised when handling and preparing docetaxel  solutions. The  use of gloves is 
recommended. If docetaxel concentrate, initial diluted solution, or final dilution for infusion 
should come into contact [CONTACT_8124], immediately and thoroughly wash with soap and water. 
If docetaxel concentrate, initial diluted solutio n, or final dilution for infusion should come into 
contact [CONTACT_294600], immed iately and thoroughly wash with water. Docetaxel for Injection 
Concentrate requires two dilutions prior to administration.  
Please follow the preparation instructions provided belo w. Note: Both the docetaxel for Injection 
Concentrate and the diluent vials contain an overfill.  
A. Preparation of the Initial Diluted Solution  
1. Gather the appropriate number of vials of docetaxel for Injection  
Concentrate and diluent (13% Ethanol in Wat er for Injection). If the vials were refrigerated, 
allow them to stand at room temperature for approximately 5 minutes.  
2. Aseptically withdraw the contents of the appropriate diluent vial into a  syringe and transfer it 
to the appropriate vial of docetaxel  for Injection Concentrate. If the procedure is followed as 
described, an initial diluted solution of 10mg docetaxel/mL will result.  
3. Mix the initial diluted solution by [CONTACT_30544] 45  seconds to assure full 
mixture of the concentrat e and diluent. Do not shake.  
4. The initial diluted docetaxel solution (10 mg docetaxel/mL) should be  clear; however, there 
may be some foam on top of the solution due to the polysorbate 80. Allow the solution to stand 
for a few minutes to allow any foam t o dissipate. It is not required that all foam dissipate prior to 
continuing the preparation process. The initial diluted solution may be used immediately or 
stored either in the refrigerator or at room temperature for a maximum of 8 hours.  
B. Preparation o f the Final Dilution for Infusion  
1. Aseptically withdraw the required amount of initial diluted docetaxel  solution (10mg 
docetaxel/mL) with a calibrated syringe and inject into an infusion bag or bottle of either 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride solution or 5% Dextro se solution to produce a final concentration of 0.3 to 
0.74mg/mL. Thoroughly mix the infusion by [CONTACT_30545].  
 
IRB-[ADDRESS_1203867] of the docetaxel concentrate with plasticized PVC equipment or  
devices used to prepare solutions for infusion is not recommended. In order to minimiz e patient 
exposure to the plasticizer DEHP (di -2-ethylhexyl phthalate), which may be leached from PVC 
infusion bags or sets, the final docetaxel dilution for infusion should be stored in bottles (glass,  
polypropylene) or plastic bags (polypropylene, polyol efin) and administered through 
polyethylene -lined administration sets.  
Route of Administration:  
Docetaxel will be administered as a [ADDRESS_1203868] that is 
connected to the patient’s vascular access catheter.  
Incompatibilities:  
Contact [CONTACT_863325]. Diluted docetaxel  solution s hould be stored in bottles 
(glass, polypropylene) or plastic bags  (polypropylene, polyolefin) and administered through 
polyethylene -lined  administration sets.  The metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by [CONTACT_863326], inhibit, or are metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] 
P450 3A4,  such as cyclosporine, terfenadine, ketoconazole, erythromycin, and  troleandomycin. 
Caution should be exercised with these drugs when treating  patients receiving docetaxel as there 
is a potential f or a significant interaction.  
Availability:  
Docetaxel (Taxotere®) is a commercial drug. The combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5 -FU

Drug Interactions  
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 31 of 56 5 December  2016  Cimetidine: Because cimetidine can decrease the clearance of 5 -FU, patients should not  
enter on this study until the ci metidine is discontinued. Ranitidine or a drug from another  
anti-ulcer class can be substituted for cimetidine, as necessary.   
Allopurinol: Oxypurinol, a metabolite of allopurinol, can potentially interfere with [ADDRESS_1203869] 
for precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047]; if apparent, agitate vial vigorously or gently heat to not greater than 140°F 
in a water bath. Do not allow to freeze.  
 
 
IRB-[ADDRESS_1203870] be done within 1 month prior to the start of therapy.  In the event that the 
patient's condition is deteriorating, laboratory evaluations should be repeated within 48 hours 
prior to initiation of the next cyc le of therapy.

For the purposes of this study, patients should be reevaluated for response after TPF and 
3, 12, and [ADDRESS_1203874] criteria (see below).While other modalities for response 
assessment (e.g. PET scanning, serum tumor markers) will be collected and may be used 
for clinical planning, they will not be used to evaluate the primary endpoint.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) 
Committee [ JNCI  92(3):205 -216, 2000].  Changes in only the largest diameter 
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_1203875] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm with 
conventional techniques (CT, MRI , x-ray) or as >[ADDRESS_1203876] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <20 mm wit h conventional techniques or <[ADDRESS_1203877] 
scan), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, 
ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast 
disease, abdominal masses (not  followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all non -
measurable.  
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions  and re corded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate 
repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]).  A sum of the longest 
diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_44934].  
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the [ADDRESS_1203878] of a treatment.  
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpa ble lymph nodes).  In the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, 
is recommended.  
Chest x -ray  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly define d and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI   These techniques should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_1203879], abdomen, and 
pelvis.  Head and neck tumors and those of extremities usually require specific protocols.  
Ultrasound (US)   When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response 
evaluation, US should not be used to measure tumor lesions.  It is, however, a possible 
alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous 
lesions, and thyroid nodules.  US might also be useful to confirm the complete 
disappearance of superficial  lesions usually assessed by [CONTACT_12148].  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation has not yet been fully and widely validated.  Their uses in this specific context 
require sophisticated equipment and a high level of expertise that may only be available 
in some centers.  Therefore, the utilization of such techniques for objective tumor 
response should be restricted to validation purposes in reference centers. However, such 
techniques may be useful t o confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are 
obtained.  
Tumor markers   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered 
in complet e clinical response.  Specific additional criteria for standardized usage of 
prostate -specific antigen (PSA) and CA -125 response in support of clinical trials are 
being developed.  
Cytology, Histology   These techniques can be used to differentiate between p artial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 36 of 56 5 December  2016  The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that app ears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
10.1.4 Response Criteria  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions  
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) 
of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD  
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions  
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficie nt shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and nor malization of 
tumor marker level  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize 
for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Incomplete Response/  
Stable Disease (SD) : Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions  
Although a clear progression of “non -target” les ions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_343], and the progression status 
should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Respo nse 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  This is a modifi cation of 
RECIST in that confirmatory  imaging is not practical at the 3, 12, and 24 month imaging 
intervals, does not contribute to  the sense of “ best response” achieved, and is not a 
primary endpoint of the study.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease 
progression at that time should be reported as “ symptomatic 
deterioration” .  Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
 
10.1.5 Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response :  The duration of  overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first 
date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smalle st measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of stable disease :  Stable  disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started.  
10.1.6 Progression -Free Survival  
Progression – free survival will be calcu lated as the interval between date of registration 
and  date of documented cancer progression or death, whichever occurs first .

Cancer center/ Stanford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], images available within the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_863312].  For images acquired outside of the Stanford system, images must be 
transferred to  a separate  , portable medium (i.e. CD or DVD), labeled with the patient’s 
anonymized Oncore protocol registration number and scan date, and sent to the clinical 
trial coordinator at the address on the first page of this protocol.  
 
11. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
11.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 38 of 56 5 December  2016  The primary endpoint for this trial will be progression free survival 2 years following  
chemoradiotherapy.  
The US intergroup CR rate to chemoradiotherapy was 49%, using SWOG response 
criteria that did not include PET imag ing. [ADDRESS_1203881] 18 patients, we would stop 
the trial.  If the trial goes to the second stage, the treatment will be co nsidered worthy of 
further study if 33 or more of the 40 patients are progression -free at 2 years.  
 
 
11.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
18-40 evaluable patients. 2 -4 per month. All patients who are not evaluable will be 
replaced. Any patient who starts treatmen t with TPF will be considered evaluable for 
response.  
11.3 Stratification Factors  
No stratification  
11.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints:  
 1. Progression free survival and overall survival will be estimated according to the 
methods of Kaplan and Meier.  
      2. Rates of adverse events will be analyzed as follows:  
The acceptable incidence of AEs resulting in protocol treatment discontinuance is 3% or 
less, and the unacceptable rate is 15% or greater. The rates of AEs resulting in protocol 
treatment disconti nuation will be estimated using a binomial distribution along with their 
associated 95% confidence intervals. Only adverse events assessed  definitely, probably, 
or possibly related to protocol treatment will be considered. [ADDRESS_1203882] treatment . 
 
IRB-[ZIP_CODE]  Page 39 of 56 5 December  2016  11.5.2 Evaluation of response.  All patients who receive one cycle of TPF will be 
considered evaluable for response.  Response categories will be: 1) complete response, 2) 
partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant 
disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) 
unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).

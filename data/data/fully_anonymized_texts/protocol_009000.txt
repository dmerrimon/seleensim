Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_541930] -effectiveness of Screening, Brief 
Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT -PM) 
compared to Usual Care (UC) in reducing pain and risky s ubstance use.  
Design and Outcomes   
In a pragmatic two -arm, parallel groups 36 -week multi -site randomized 
controlled single blind trial, we will randomize 1100 Veterans applying for 
compensation related to musculoskeletal disorders to ei ther SBIRT -PM or 
Usual Care (UC) across eight VA medical centers in New England.  
Outcome assessment by [CONTACT_428325] [ADDRESS_541931] and toxicology testing of nail clippi[INVESTIGATOR_14839].   
Primary outcomes will be change in pain severity as measured by [CONTACT_428326] ( BPI) and change in substances categorized as requiring 
intervention  measured by [CONTACT_428327].  Secondary outcomes will incl ude non -
pharmacological pain management service utilization, NRS pain severity , pain 
interference with life activities  as measured by [CONTACT_55817], overall pain (PEG) , 
overall health  (EQ-5D-5L), use severity for individual substances generated 
by [CONTACT_428327], and toxicology results for individual su bstances. The trial will 
include cost -effectiveness and budget impact analyses.  
Interventions and Duration  
Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management 
(SBIRT -PM) aims to engage Veterans applying for compensation  with pain 
conditions in multi -modal non -pharmacological pain care and to motivate 
those who misuse substances to change this problemati c behavior. SBIRT -
PM will be delivered centrally by [CONTACT_428328] t the New England VA 
Healthcare System’s (VISN1) eight medical centers. It involves an initial one -
hour session followed by [CONTACT_428329] 20-minute calls in a 12 -week peri od and 
an additional call in the 12 -32 week period to support Veterans engagement 
in non -pharmacological pain care.  
Usual care (UC): A Veteran who completes a compensation examination 
ordinarily has no further treatment, referral or deb riefing as part of the 
Compensation  examination  
Sample Size and Population  
The study sample consists of [ADDRESS_541932] the effectiveness and cos t-effectiveness of SBIRT -PM, 
compared to UC, when delivered within a VISN1 -wide hub -and-spoke network.  
 Objective  1: We will determine if SBIRT -PM is more effective than UC in 
reducing pain severity as measured by [CONTACT_428330] (primary 
outcome). Secondary outcomes include non -pharmacological pain management service 
utilization, pain interference with life activities  (BPI [INVESTIGATOR_428263] ), and overall 
health .   Hypothesis : SBIRT -PM will be more effective than UC. We will test the  degree 
to which non -pharmacological pain management service utilization me diates pain 
outcomes.  
 Objective  2: We will evaluate if SBIRT -PM, compared to UC, is more effective in 
reducing the number of substances categorized as requiring any intervention as 
measured by [CONTACT_428327] (primary outcome).  Secondary o utcomes will include the use 
severity measure for individual substances generated by [CONTACT_428327], and nail clippi[INVESTIGATOR_428264].   Hypothesis : SBIRT -PM will be more 
effective than UC. We will separately test the degre e to which non -pharmacological pain 
management service utilization and substance use servic e utilization mediates the 
effect of SBIRT- PM on substance use outcomes.  
 Objective  3: We will assess the cost -effectiveness of SBIRT -PM relative to UC. 
Hypothesis : SBIRT -PM will be cost -effective relative to UC across a range of possible 
values of decision makers’ willingness -to-pay for minimal clinically important differences 
in pain severity  and interference .

overall pain as measured by [CONTACT_428331] , a common pain measure required across 
protocols funded by [CONTACT_18121] -DoD-VA Pain Management Collaboratory, which measures 
average pain intensity (P), interference with enjoym ent of life  (E), and interference with 
general activity (G) .  Hypothesis : SBIRT -PM will be more effective than UC.  
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.[ADDRESS_541934] -9/[ADDRESS_541935] MSD and Could Benefit from Non -
Pharmacologic Pain Care .  
 Military personnel carry heavy packs, move heavy equipme nt and undergo 
intense physical stresses; a high proportion of them will develop musculoskeletal 
disorders (MSD) involving chronic pain. Chronic pain is widely prevalent in Veterans 
and is one of the most common reasons for outpatient  healthcare utilization.1 In recent 
years, returning Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and  Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) 
post-9/[ADDRESS_541936] Guidelines and Considerations  13 of 67  Version 1.1 
  27 April 2020  By [CONTACT_428332], approximately 17.5% o f post -9/11 Veterans in VA 
treatment were diagnosed with back disorders and 17.0%  were diagnosed with joint 
conditions,[ADDRESS_541937] contributed to the risk for 
substance use among Veterans. The opi[INVESTIGATOR_93986] t o treat painful MSD carry the 
potential for aberrant use and eventually misuse. A r emarkably high proportion, 64%, of 
post-9/[ADDRESS_541938] -9/[ADDRESS_541939] the potential to 
improve pain treatment outcomes by [CONTACT_428333]’ pain treatment adherence.  In 
this proposal, although measured separately from non -pharmacological pain treatmen ts, 
substance use treatment is facilitated because it is a c omponent of pain treatment.  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_541940] -9/[ADDRESS_541941] as claimants, not as patients. When Veterans end their  
military service, and begin the transition to civilian life, they are encouraged to file 
claims for physical or psychological conditions that may be related to their military 
service. Veterans are encouraged to file claims during demobilization, at Vetera ns’ 
resource fairs to publicize services available to Veterans , and at Veterans Service 
Organizations that offer assistance with the claims pr ocess.[ADDRESS_541942] -9/11 
Veterans being compensated for back or neck condition s, and 596,250 for limitation of 
flexion in joints (Veterans often have more than one involved body part).40 In 2015 
alone, 313,052 new Veterans began receiving disabilit y compensation, of whom 
approximately 31% were under age 35.     
  Examinations to determine Veterans’ compensation are  important because: (1) 
they are often conducted when Veterans are in some degree of pain or crisis associated 
with their disorder; (2) significant financial remune ration is at stake; and (3) Veterans 
judged to have a service -connected condition will receive priority  care at the VA for it, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_428265]. The compensation examiner has a re sponsibility to the agency that 
decides claims, the Veterans Benefits Administration ( VBA), to obtain information  so the 
claim can be adjudicated. Therefore, as in forensic ev aluations, compensation 
examiners are taught to tell Veterans that the purpo se of the examination is to evaluate 
the disability claim and not to provide treatment. Al though the examiner’s role might be 
complicated by [CONTACT_12552]/her making a treatment recommendat ion, having another clinician 
explain available treatments is not. The failure to o ffer treatment can be alienating.[ADDRESS_541943] -9/11 Veterans: “VBA should shift its focus away 
from claims processing and onto rehabilitating and r eintegration of Veterans.”42 
Congressional hearings in June 2011 addressed “Bridgi ng the Gap Between Care and 
Compensation for Veterans,”43 the very topic of this proposal. One of the witnesses 
cited our group’s editorial advocating engagement of Veterans in treatment when they 
apply for service -connection.[ADDRESS_541944] 9/[ADDRESS_541945] 2 -session assessment 
and educational control interview, significantly impro ved the rates in which patients with 
chronic pain attended a series of pain management wo rkshops. Similarly, Friedrich et 
al58 showed that patients with chronic low back pain attend ed more physical therapy 
sessions and had reduced disability and pain levels when  the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_428266]’ visits. MI is well -
aligned with expert recommendations for patient -centeredness and shared decision -
making in chronic pain management.60-63 Furthermore, the VHA National Center for 
Health Promotion and Disease Prevention has endorsed the use of MI “to elicit and 
increase Veterans’ own intrinsic motivation to partic ipate in healthcare decisions and 
change health behaviors that are key to improving heal th and maintaining their well -
being.”[ADDRESS_541946] -9/[ADDRESS_541947] alcohol dependence (see Prelimi nary Studies section).  
  Our group developed SBIRT for Pain Management (SBIR T-PM) to promote 
engagement in multi -modal non -pharmacological pain management among 
compensation -seeking Veterans with chronic pain. In SBIRT -PM, a clinician meets with 
the Veteran after the compensatio n examination to address the presenting MSD 
complaint. A clinician rather than the compensation e xaminer delivers SBIRT -PM to 
allow the Veteran to engage in a confidential discussio n without concern about how it 
will impact the compensation claim. The clinician ad dresses Veterans’ motivation for 
multi -modal pain care, and explains how pain can be manag ed using a variety of non -
pharmacological pain management services. The clinicia n spells out how those services 
can be accessed at VA.  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  16 of 67  Version 1.1 
  27 April 2020    Using permissive language about how pain is commonly self -medicated with 
substances, the clinician transitions to inquiries ab out use of prescription and non -
prescription substances. The clinician then attempts to motivate Veterans to change 
their behavior if they are misusing substances. Thus , SBIRT -PM addresses the 
Veteran’s presenting pain complaint first and nascent  substance use subsequently.  
 
A Veterans Integrated Service Network Hub -and-Spoke Model of SBIRT -PM Delivery .  
The VA often employs the hub -and-spoke model to manage care across a 
geographically -dispersed healthcare system. The hub -and-spoke model allows for 
expertise concentrated in specific geographic areas t o be available throughout the 
system. The Veterans Health Administration is divided int o 18 geographical regions 
across the [LOCATION_002] called Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN). VISNs 
are organized as hub -and-spoke networks in which a central administration oversees  
healthcare policy and service delivery of all medical cent ers in the designated region.[ADDRESS_541948] 
in which many other clinical interventions and areas o f expertise are delivered within 
VA. One widely used example of a hub -and-spoke model in VHA is SCAN -ECHO 
(Specialty Care Access Networks -Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes). In 
these programs, “hubs” with  experts in a particular area arrange teleconferences,  
trainings, and case consultation for providers in “spo kes” or satellite sites. VA 
Connecticut is the site for a SCAN -ECHO program for pain management, and this 
model appears to be effective. Suggestive  evidence of its effectiveness is that providers 
who participate in the pain SCAN -ECHO program have been significantly more likely to 
use physical medicine, anti -depressants, and anti -convulsant treatments, but not 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].[ADDRESS_541949] -effective compared to no network from a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]80 and societal perspective.81 Hub and spoke systems allow for full -time 
personnel to specialize in the intervention and serve multiple sites, rather than requiring 
training of larger numbers of personnel at many site s.  
  The theoretical framework for implementation of SBIRT -PM in a hub -and-spoke 
model is Relational Coordination.82 Relational Coordination refers to the quality of 
communication and collaboration across sites and is pr edictive of a team’s or 
organization’s ability to provide high quality care.83-[ADDRESS_541950] Guidelines and Considerations  17 of 67  Version 1.1 
  27 April 2020  phase. Informed by [CONTACT_428334], we will  then work to build Relational 
Coordination within our hub -and-spoke network to deliver SBIRT -PM. 
Within the VA, there are financial incentives for VI SN-wide initiatives, such as the one 
proposed, that bring Veterans into VA care. The for mula for funding each VISN is 
essentially a capi[INVESTIGATOR_428267],  called the Veterans Equitable 
Resource Allocation (VERA). Each additional patient in the New England VISN 
generates a mean of $650087 (the median is considerably lower) and Veterans whos e 
conditions are judged to be connected to their milita ry service are, understandably, the 
highest priority Veterans for VA facilities to enrol l. The VA as an organization depends 
on enrolling new Veterans as those from prior wars di e or move to other regions. 
Beyond having the potential to improve care for Vete rans applying for compensation for 
MSD -related claims, to the extent SBIRT -PM results in new Veteran enrollment, it could 
increase revenue into VISN1 and its medical centers. T herefore, our proposal includes 
a budget impact analysis, with the prosaic but crucial information as to how SBIRT -PM 
impacts the VISN bottom line.  We will determine the  cost and cost -effectiveness of 
SBIRT -PM because these data provide evidence for SBIRT -PM’s value.

Assistant conducting all study assessments will be blinde d. Secondary outcomes will 
include non -pharmacological pain management service utilization, pa in interference with 
life activities  (BPI) , overall pain (PEG), overall health  (EQ-5D-5L), use severity for 
individual substances generated by [CONTACT_428327], and toxicology results for individual 
substances. The trial will include cost -effectiveness and budget impact analyses.  
 
Study Settings .  
The study will occur within the eight VISN1 VA medical  centers (VAMC) located across 
six New England States. Each site provides MSD -related compensation examinations, 
addiction/mental health treatment, and a variety of n on-pharmacological pain 
treatments.  
 
The medical centers are:  
1. Bedford VAMC  
2. [LOCATION_011] Healthcare System  
3. Central Western [LOCATION_005]  
4. Connecticut Healthcare System  
5. Maine Healthcare System  
6. Manchester VAMC  
7. Providence VAMC  
8. White River Junction VA  
 
Feasibility of Recruiting a Sufficient Number of Vete rans Who Meet Inclusion/Exclusion 
Criteria :  
As noted in the completed SBIRT -PM RCT, in only 21 months of recruiting, 1017 
examinations (for 1014 unique Veterans) were schedul ed for service -connection 
examinations for back, neck, knee, or shoulder. Over the [ADDRESS_541955] at each of the other seven sites within VISN 1, we used VBA reports of 
new service -connec tion examinations requested at each of the other si tes for 
back/neck/knee/shoulder. We then assumed the same proport ion at each site would be 
eligible as were at the Connecticut site.  
At VA Connecticut, 257/1014 Veterans met eligibility  criteria and enrolled (a 
24.3% enrollment rate). The proposed study is likely t o enroll at least as high a 
percentage, and probably higher because: (1) enrollme nt by [CONTACT_428337] p rior study; and (2) there are fewer 
inclusion/exclusion criteria in the proposed study. C onservatively assuming the 18% 
enrollment rate in the UG3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (with only one call  to many participants) yields 1862

5. Service use data from central VA databases  
 
VA Staff sources of materials : 
Information to be collected includes:  
1. Responses to Relational Coordination Survey

Assessment Procedures .  
A research assistant, blind to study condition, will conduct baseline, [ADDRESS_541958] of SBIRT -PM reported in the 
Preliminary Studies, the accuracy of research assistants ’ guesses about  treatment 
condition assign ment  were almost exactly at chance (52%).  We will abstrac t data from 
the VA electronic health record (EHR) when possible.  
 
Procedures to Collect Self -Report Data from Veteran Participants .  
The self -reported assessment will be conducted by [CONTACT_648]. Baseli ne assessment will be 
conducted as soon as possible after enrollment, and fo llow-up phone assessments will 
be conducted approximately 12 and 36 weeks after ran domization. Participants will 
receive a reminder call or text/email message prior to s tudy appointments (e.g. , “your 
follow -up phone interview with our research study is Monday, December 11th at 1:30. 
Please call [Name] at xxx -xxx- xxxx if you need to reschedule” ). If a participant misses a  
scheduled appointment, the research assistant will call to reschedule. Participants will 
be asked at the beginning of enrollment for the name s and telephone numbers of three 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_541959] of 7 -10 stakeholders (providers in primary care clinics, 
pain service clinics, administration, and Compensation  & Pension clinics) at their site. At 
the end of the study (after recruitment and follow -up appointments are complete), our 
qualitative expert and her team will contact [CONTACT_428338], inviting them to 
participate in a semi -structured interview designed to better understand how  pain 
services are conducted at their site and how staff at e ach site  communicate with other 
clinics regarding Veteran referrals for pain services. The qualitative expert and her team 
will place a follow -up phone call to stakeholders to schedule an interview . Interviews will 
last approximately [ADDRESS_541960] received services 
from anywhere in VHA. Veterans who are scheduled for  a service -connection 
examination (all study participants) have a medical r ecord with VHA. The encounters 
indicate a provider, service provider, diagnoses addr essed, and clinic in which services 
were delivered (e.g. mental health, substance use, primary care, pain clinic). The 
diagnosis and service -use data are not comprehensive for Veterans who have not been 
receiving their care at VA, but positive findings suc h as treatment encounters and 
diagnoses reflect clinical care/evaluations and thei r charting by [CONTACT_39487].  
 
Costs Estimation Procedures .  
We will use the customized Resource Allocation Worksheet  to estimate the costs of 
delivering SBIRT -PM from the perspective of the providers (i.e., both t he VISN and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  Cost estimation for VA services used by [CONTACT_428339] 36 -week study 
period will be assessed using national VA administrati ve databases. Data on service 
use at the individual patient level will come from t he VA National Patient Care Database 
(NPCD), w hich includes information on all inpatient and outpa tient encounters at VA 
facilities. Costs for these services will be computed u sing the VA Average Cost 
Database, developed by [CONTACT_428340] (HERC). The Average 
Cost Database assigns an average cost to each inpatien t admission and outpatient visit 
in VA. Costs are based on Current Procedure Terminol ogy (CPT)  codes and can be 
linked to unique records in the NPCD.  
 Costs for VA services used by [CONTACT_428341] 36 -week study period will be 
assessed using national VA administrative databases. Dat a on VA service use at the 
individual patient level will come from the VA Nati onal Patient Care Database (NPCD), 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_541961] Database, 
developed by [CONTACT_428342] (HE RC). The Average Cost 
Database assigns an average cost to each inpatient admi ssion and outpatient visit in 
VA. Costs are based on Current Procedure Terminolog y (CPT) codes and can be linked 
to unique records in the NPCD.   Costs incurred by [CONTACT_428343].  
 
Procedures to develop a new natural language proces sing (NLP) algorithm that 
identifies use of non -pharmacological pain management services  
To comprehensively identify pain -related treatment delivered to study participants, we  
will validate and extend existing natural language sea rch algorithms, using previously -
described procedures, to identify current use of a co mprehensive set of pain treat ments 
including those not covered by [CONTACT_428344] . Those modalities will be drawn 
from a review of modalities used by [CONTACT_428345] 1. Algorithm development will be informed by o ur prior experience with th is study 
design. We will design algorithms to maximize positi ve predictive value (at the expense 
of sensitivity) to avoid the risk of including false pos itives that are not randomly 
distributed (e.g., refused treatment referrals). The NLP extraction target  will be current 
use of the modality. Particular attention will be pai d to excluding pain discussions that 
do not represent treatment because they were obtain ed in the course of routine medical 
history reviews. Algorithm development involves extract ing relevant snippets that 
mention a particular pain treatment, establishing a v alid classification system for current 
use of that pain treatment, and optimizing the machi ne learning algorithm to identify 
current use of that treatment.  
Extracting relevant snippets: In brief, terms related  to each of the pain treatments 
(i.e. therapy keywords) will be generated by [CONTACT_428346]. For example, for 
physical therapy, terms might include “physical therapy ,” “PT,” or “physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541].” A 
simple algorithm will identify these terms, along with the [ADDRESS_541962] review of  multiple records. The algor ithm will 
be modified using Boolean terms (e.g. physical NOT ph ysical exam). We will refine the 
search terms and extract 20+ word snippets using the Vo ogo clinical data search 
engine.  
Establishing a valid classification system for use of a pain treatment modality : 
The investigators  will develop annotation guidelines for classifying sn ippets as 
representing current service use (e.g. of physical ther apy services as no/yes/probably). 
One challenge is that the documentation of temporal i nformation varies in specificity. 
We will classify  the temporal information into several categories ba sed on the onset and 
duration attributes. For instance, usage with a non -specific past start and end time (e.g. 
“patient used physical therapy before”) will be consid ered to be past usage, usage with 
no specific past start but no end time (e.g. “patien t has been going to a physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]”) will be considered current for the time of documentation, usage with specific 
start and end time will be considered current for th e time it specified, etc. The 
annotation guidelines will be revised and then teste d on [ADDRESS_541963] Guidelines and Considerations  23 of 67  Version 1.1 
  27 April 2020  Optimizing the machine learning algorithm to identi fy use of a pain treatment: We 
will then randomly select 500 text snippets containin g terms per type of pain therapy 
from all retrieved notes from primary care and perfo rm human review based on the 
annotation guideline described above. Annotation wor k will be carried out using the 
Visual Tagging Tool (VTT). This set of annotates data  will be added to our existing set 
of annotated data (n=3000) and serve as the new gold/ reference standard for machine 
learnin g and training. We will apply a machine learning alg orithm, Support Vector 
Machine (SVM), to identify current use of pain thera py, optimizing for highest positive 
predictive values (PPV). Informed by [CONTACT_428347], we will use therapy 
keywords, n gram (n consecutive words), note type, and  temporal information as 
features in the classification of current use. Tempo ral information will be extracted using 
a prior method developed and tested by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Zeng.88  
To assess the NLP performance, we will perform 10 -fold cross validation, which 
partitions the entire annotated sample into 10 rand om sets with equal size, uses 9 sets 
for training and 1 for testing, and repeats 10 times.  Our target PPV is >=90%, which is 
very likely to be reachable  because : 1) the specificity of the test has been set  high (at the 
cost of sensitivity ); 2) the usage level (prevalence) of the primary non-pharmacologic 
modalities for chronic pain treatment is high which  increases PPV; 3) we achieved 89% PPV in 
our work on a small set of modalities. We will apply machine learning methods we trained 
using previously acquired annotated data such as Sup port Vector Machine and Random 
Forest, and will use an ensemble learning step call ed Stacking,89 in which a learning 
algorithm combines the results of several other lear ning algorithms, if the separate 
programs’ performance fails to reach the target posi tive predictive value.   In the unlikely 
event that the PPV is not reached for a particular CI H modality, that modality’s 
assessment will be conducted by [CONTACT_428348] (self -report and EHR 
codes).  
 
 
4. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
 
For this pragmatic clinical trial, the study inclusio n and exclusion criteria are broad.  
There are no specific evaluations of capacity to consen t or complete study procedures.   
 Participants must meet all the inclusion criteria to participate in this study.  
Consistent with the guidelines for pragmatic trials,  we have taken a broad perspective to 
include all participants who have MSD -related conditions with moderately severe pain, 
regardless of the type of MSD, their anticipated respo nsiveness to SBIRT -PM, or 
psychiatric, substance use, or medical comorbidities  or past compliance. Because 
SBIRT -PM targets pain, and is telephone -based, at baseline participants must self -
report moderate pain severity and have access to a te lephone to test the effectiveness 
of the SBIRT -PM in this clinical trial. The other targeted outcome , substance use, is not 
an inclusion criterion. But rates of risky use in the  completed RCT were high enough for 
an adequately -powered study without requiring baseline use as an i nclusion criterion.  
 Candidates meeting any of the exclusion criteria at ba seline will be excluded 
from study participation.  We are excluding people who are already connected t o three 
or more VA nonpharmacological pain to minimize a ceil ing effect, i.e., such participants 
have a lower likelihood of needing a referral.  
 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_541964]-9/11 Veteran applying for MSD -related compensation  (specified as back, 
neck, shoulder, or knee pain), as ascertained from fi led claim,  
 
2. reports a score of ≥4 (threshold for moderately severe pain) on the BPI’s Pain 
Severity subscale (average of four pain intensity ite ms);  
 
3. availability of a landline or cellular telephone for  SBIRT -PM.  
 
4.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
 
1. reports inability to participate during the study enr ollment call;  
 
2. received three or more non -pharmacological pain treatment modalities within th e 
last 12 weeks from VA  (modalities are: (1)  acupuncture (2) rehabilitation 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (3) Manipulation (4) Massage (5) Yoga (6) Tai Chi/Q igong (7) exercise 
(8) Biofeedback (9) Hypnosis/Hypnotherapy (10) Guided I magery (11) Meditation

3. participation in another PMC3 study as evidenced by a  research protocol alert for 
that study at the time the study invitation letter is mailed.  
  
4.[ADDRESS_541965] will  include two groups of human 
subjects, (1) Veterans and (2) VA staff (clinicians an d administrators).  
 
Screening and Recruitment for Veterans .  
A waiver of Informed Consent and a waiver of HIPAA Au thorization were  obtained to 
review the Compensation and Pension Clinic’s schedule  to determine when a MSD 
examination is scheduled for a post -9/[ADDRESS_541966] -9/[ADDRESS_541967] 
information and $1 USD will be included with the rec ruitment letter. All veterans who are 
identified as a potential participant and mailed a r ecruitment letter will receive the  
magnet and dollar regardless of whether or not they choose to enroll in the study. The 
magnet is a non -monetary incentive (valued at approximately $0.21) tha t will increase 
response rate, as potential participants can post the  magnet in an easy to see loc ation 
to remind them that the study personnel will be call ing. It might also help with retention 
rates for enrolled participants as it can be a visual r eminder of participation and the 
study team contact [CONTACT_428349]. The dollar is  a monetary 
incentive designed to increase the rate at which peo ple will take the study team call. 
One year into the study, we have found that we are unable to contact 45% of people 
who are mailed a letter after three contact [CONTACT_103904] s. Research has shown that pre -paid 
incentives are most effective at increasing response  rate. However, the value of the 
incentive is nominal so as not to be coercive or to cr eate an undue influence on people 
from a lower socioeconomic class.  
Veterans who opt out will not receive any more study -related phone calls. A copy 
of the Study Information Sheet describing the study w ill be included with the recruitment 
letter.  
At least four days after the recruitment letter is se nt, resear ch assistants will 
attempt to call Veterans up to three times to invite them to pa rticipate in the study. A 
four-day waiting period from the day the letter is mailed to  the day of the call is sufficient 
to allow Veterans time to receive the letter in the mail and opt out if preferred . At that 
call, the research assistant will explain the study and  further screen for eligibility. For 
eligible Veterans, the research assistant will conduct informed  consent followed by  
[CONTACT_428350]. Although enrollment 
ideally occurs before the Compensation examination, Veterans will be allowed to enroll 
up to six weeks after  recruitment letters are mailed .  If a Veteran misplaces or has not 
received the Study Information Sheet, the Research As sistants will offer to mail another 
copy to the Veteran. The Veteran can choose to conti nue with the recruitment call or to 
wait until they receive the copy of the Information Sheet before continuing.  
 
Informed Consent and Enrollment for Veterans:  
Voluntary informed consent will be obtained from all  Veterans prior to participation. A 
waiver of Documentation of Informed Consent and a wa iver of HIPAA Authorization has 
been  obtained  for this study .  
Participants will receive a Study Information Sheet d etailing the study. In an 
audio -recorded telephone call, a research assistant will go over all aspects of informed 
consent with potential participants. At the start of the call, the research assistant wi ll 
verify the identity of the participant. Veterans will be  provided with information about the 
SBIRT -PM intervention, how long it will last, the nature of study assessments, 
information  about the collection of biological specimens, the exa mination of thei r 
electronic health care and VA data, and potential ri sks and benefits of study 
participation. Veterans will be reminded that they c an withdraw from the study at any 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_541968]. All staff obtaining consent will be 
authorized to do so by [CONTACT_216265].  
Justification for obtaining a waiver of documentation of informed con sent and 
waiver of HIPAA Authorization : These waivers are necessary to conduct the study. The 
purpose of this study is to test the usefulness of re motely delivered counseling. All 
counseling sessions and research assessments are conducted  remotely. There is no 
face-to-face contact [CONTACT_428351]. It would 
be burdensome and impractica l to have potential participants come in to the VA jus t to 
sign a study Consent Form and HIPAA authorization. Thi s study could not practicably 
be conducted without the waivers due to the timing of  study procedures. Baseline 
assessments and study counseling should occur before or w ithin six weeks after the 
recruitment letter is mailed. Waiting for the Vetera n to find time to come to the VA to 
sign a Consent Form and HIPAA Authorization or waiting  for the Veteran to return a 
signed copy of the Consent Form and HIPAA Authorizati on by [CONTACT_428352], maki ng a large proportion of 
eligible Veterans ineligible.  
Randomization : The unit of randomization is participant.  Participants will be 
randomized to SBIRT or Usual Care using a computeri zed urn randomization program90 
within each site to increase the likelihood of bala nced allocation of participants to the 
two interventions on sex, race (Caucasian, African American), ethnicity (Hispani c 
no/yes) and self -reported illicit drug use within [ADDRESS_541969] based on loca tion, availability and work flow.  
Enrollment : Participants are considered enrolled after they compl ete the informed 
consent process and agree to study procedures.  
 
Informed Consent and Enrollment for VA Staff:  
A waiver of documentation of Informed Consent for VA S taff participants has been  
obtained  for staff participants .  
 Research staff will describe the purpose of the surv ey and interview prior to 
administering these assessments. Participating VA staf f members will be encouraged to 
ask any questions and have the option to discontinue part icipation without prejudice. 
They will be approached by [CONTACT_428353].  
 After a brief reiteration of the study purpose, the  interviewer will confirm consent 
to record the interview for transcription and analysis p urposes before proceeding.  
 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_541970] review to develop the na tural language processing (NLP) 
algorithm for pain -related treatments .  
A computer algorithm will be used to identify key ter ms (e.g. “physical therapy” along 
with the 10 preceding and 10 following words: a snip pet. Snippets of chart data will be 
identified that contain pain -related treatment keywords and surrounding text will  be 
identified from electronic medical records from up to  10,000,000 (approximately number 
of Veterans with medical records). As such, although not specifically queried for PHI, a 
snippet might contain some PHI such as a visit date a nd doctor’s name.  All of the work 
with the snippets is done in the VINCI data analysis env ironment behind the firewall in 
the VA. Access to the VA network and VINCI are passwor d protected and only 
accessible at the VA or through remote access with an approved device. These 
snippets will be reviewed to identify approximately 70 0 snippets per pain treatment 
modality (100 for developi[INVESTIGATOR_428270] 600 for  validating the algorithm using the 
developed annotation).  
5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.[ADDRESS_541971] done in prior studies. The 
counselor also explains the structure (4 sessions over 1 2 weeks), and focus 
(engagement in pain management services, changing ris ky substance use if it exists) of 
SBIRT -PM and then begins the interview by [CONTACT_428354] ’s MSD condition 
and experiences with pain , conveying understanding and compassion for the Veteran’ s 
experience.  Next, the counselor explains how pain can be managed using a variety of 
pain management services , and how these services can be accessed at VA . 
 The counselor explains pain management consistent with  guidelines issued by 
[CONTACT_129619],91 calling for education, encouragement of self -
management, and judicious use of non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007]. The explanation is in the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_428271], not an exhortation. The counselor describes how the goal 
of pain treatment is improving function (“helpi[INVESTIGATOR_428272]”) and that it may take a variety of  different treatments to achieve this 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  28 of 67  Version 1.1 
  27 April 2020  goal. The counselor further describes how pain is com monly associated with decreased 
activity, which in turn can contribute to other probl ems.  
 The counselor’s explanation of the role of opi[INVESTIGATOR_428273]. Becker’s safe 
prescribing approach.[ADDRESS_541972] in some V eterans’ pain treatment, 
and that Veterans benefit when pain medicines are p rescribed and taken safely. The 
counselor reinforces the importance of taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_428274] r substances (like alcohol). The 
counselor explains that judicious use of non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_428275].  
 The counselor introduces the idea that non -pharmacological treatments can help 
manage pain, and explains what they are and how the y work. These services may 
include: (1) treatment for the underlying ailment, ( 2) physical therapy (both at VA and as 
home exercise and stretching programs), (3) behavioral t reatments like Cognitive 
Behavioral Therapy for chronic pain, (4) treatments f or depression, PTSD, and/or other 
mental health problems that chronic pain may have aggr avated, and (5) complementary 
and integrative health interventions available includi ng chiropractor services, 
acupuncture and yoga.  
 Throughout these discussions, the counselor seeks oppo rtunities to motivate the 
Veteran to engage  in multi -modal pain care  using a variety of MI consistent approaches.  
If the Veteran commits to engaging in pain manageme nt services, the counselor 
develops a plan with the Veteran to initiate this pr ocess. For Veterans not enrolled in VA 
services, the counselor  explain s the procedures to obtain eligibility for VA care.  
• After motivating Veterans for engagement in pain man agement services, the 
counselor transitions to screening for substance use.  The coun selor explain s that 
some people with chronic pain use various substances to help them cope with the 
pain, and obtains  the Veteran’s permission to discuss this. The counselor then 
screens for substance use.  If the Veteran reports no risky substance use, the 
counselor summarized the session, reiterates the plan, and schedules the next 
session.  If the Veteran reports risky substance use, the  counselor asks more about 
it and how the use is affected by [CONTACT_92524]’s pain.  The counselor provides 
feedback about the risky substance use, including  evidence that people who don’t 
misuse substances  have significant reductions in their pain compared t o those who 
continue to do so .  As with efforts to address the Veteran’s interest in p ain 
management services, the counselor uses MI consistent approaches to motivate the 
Veteran to stop or reduce risky substance use. Some Vet erans will not want to 
pursue abstinence and, for them, a harm reduction ap proach will be taken, meaning 
the counselor  and Veteran will negotiate a plan to use less  of the problematic 
substance per occasion, or use on fewer days, but not necessarily strive for 
abstinence. The counselor will develop a plan with the Veteran ab out how to reach a 
goal of abstinence or reduced or less frequent use, including options for engaging in 
specialty addiction treatment services available at the VA. When mental health 
issues further complicate the Veteran’s pain managemen t and risky substance use, 
the counselor will also discuss these issues with the Ve teran.  In fact, some 
Veteran s may insist on PTSD (or depression) treatment instead of substance abuse 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_541973] up to three 20 -minute, mutually 
scheduled phone counseling sessions  with the Veteran (about once per month for 12 
weeks) to check on the Veteran’s status in achieving t he goals of the plan, and to gauge 
his or her continued motivation to receive pain trea tment and reduce risky substance 
use, as indicated. An additional call during the [ADDRESS_541974] ance use services in view of 
any healthcare system changes that occurred (see respons e to COVID -19 section 
below). These calls may be informed by [CONTACT_428355] (e.g., seeing if a 
consult was placed, reviewing progress notes indicating  engagement with services ). 
Twelve weeks allows time for  the Veteran to work with the counselor to resolve barrier s 
to service engagement, consider other treatment opti ons, and sustain motivation for and 
engagement in pain management and ancillary services . Moreover, meta -analyses and 
"dose -response" studies93,[ADDRESS_541975] . SBIRT -
PM counselors will write progress notes that indicate the SBIRT -PM encounter and 
outcome of each session, including asking the provider  to consider placing a consult for 
the Veteran’s preferred services or discussing the Vetera n’s interest in services at the 
Veterans next scheduled appointment. SBIRT -PM counselors cannot place consults for 
services directly; only PACT providers or other licensed p rofessionals working with the 
Veterans at their VAs can do so.  
 
SBIRT -PM Clinician Supervision .  
[CONTACT_428405] will provide competency -based supervision to support the counselors ’ 
delivery of SBIRT -PM throughout the trial. This approach is consistent w ith the national 
VA Evidence -Based Practice training model,[ADDRESS_541976]. Martino will meet with the counselor s together on a 1 -hour monthly 
basis to review their SBIRT -PM practice. For these supervision meetings, he will l isten 
to and rate the counselors ’ SBIRT -PM fidelity for two sessions per counselor  (one initial 
and one follow -up call) using the Independent Tape Rater Scale 96 (see 3.C.3.8.10) for 
the purposes of feedback and coaching during supervisi on. In MI clinician training 
research, this approach and dose of supervision has been  shown to sustain proficient 
practice.[ADDRESS_541977], 
we are able to continue to deliver the intervention during the coronavirus pandemic. 
However, several adaptations will occur.  
1. Access to in -person pain and substance use treatment is extremely  limited during 
the pandemic, while the VA has expanded telehealth/v ideo-based visits and 
treatments. Therefore, SBIRT -PM counselors will advise veterans on available 
telehealth /video services  and online resources for pain and substance use 
treatment  that Veterans are being referred to . 
2. Counselors will make themselves as widely available as  possible to 
accommodate tighter schedules.  
3. Empathy for the Veteran’s situation is a core feature  of Motivational Interviewing 
and many Veterans’ situations are dominated by [CONTACT_49410] D-19. Therefore, empathy 
for COVID- 19 related issues that Veterans raise is being incorpor ated into the 
counseling.  
4. Because of the changing availability of treatment se rvices during the COVID -19 
period , the intervention will allow for one additional cou nseling session per 
veteran to occur between weeks 12 and 3 2. This session will be for the purpose 
of re-motivating veterans to engage in  available  pain and substance use services 
in view of any healthcare system changes that occurred.  The additional session 
maintains the integrity of our intervention in that t he counselor can fully influence 
veteran engagement in multimodal pain treatment and addiction services as 
those services’ availability changes.  
Counselors will determine on a case -by-case basis when to conduct this 
additional session based on when services become more available at each site 
and veteran preferences. Only one session will be per missible during this week 
12-[ADDRESS_541978] Director  and will be 
told they were assigned to the condition without additional study c ounseling. Veterans 
will be reminded that they should continue to pursue whatever counseling they need 
outside the study.  
Justification for No Additional Referral Control Con dition. No additional treatment 
is “treatment -as-usual” when a Veteran applies for service -connection. However, no 
treatment that a Veteran would otherwise get withou t participating in this study will be 
withheld. An active control group is important when an extens ive intervention is being 
tested and it is important to determine if the inter vention’s efficacy apart from non -
specific benefits from the time and effort expended b y the clinician. However, the need

 Adherence and Competence : We will randomly select 220 audio recorded 
SBIRT -PM sessions from the total number of sessions occurrin g in the trial (maximum = 
550 initial + 1650 follow -up sessions). Therefore, at a minimum we will have a  10% 
sample for validating that SBIRT -PM was delivered as intended. Specifically, the 
Independent Tape Rater Scale (ITRS ) will be used to assess the degree to which 
SBIRT -PM sessions were delivered with fidelity to MI (i.e.,  with adherence and 
competence). The ITRS includes items that cover thera peutic strategies that are MI 
consis tent (e.g. reflections) or inconsistent (e.g., unsol icited advice). For this trial, we 
added  three general items that detail the extent to which strateg ies for pain and 
substance use occurred in the sessions. For each item,  raters evaluate the counselors  
for adherence (i.e., the extent of intervention deli very) and competence (i.e., the 
skill/quality of intervention delivery) along 7 -point Likert scales. We will: 1) calculate 
mean adherence and competence scores for the two fac tors (fundamental and 
advance d MI strategies) identified in prior psychometric analy ses,96,100,101 and 2) 
determine if sessions achieve a criterion level for adequately performing MI, namely, at 
least half the MI consistent items rated average or above for both adherence and 
competence. In addition, we will evaluate the degree  to which clinicians addressed pain 
and substance use during the session, based on our g eneral items. We have 
documented experience training ITRS raters to perfor m reliable MI session process 
ratings in multi -site trials.102-[ADDRESS_541981] Guidelines and Considerations  32 of 67  Version 1.1 
  27 April 2020   For the data analyses, adherence to SBIRT -PM counseling will be dichotomized 
(“Having received counseling”  Yes/N o).  This approach is being taken because SBIRT -
PM’s duration and intensity is not hypothesized to rel ate to outcome; a Veteran might , in 
a single session , take steps to engage in non -pharmacological pain treatment that 
require minimal follow -up.  Conversely, a Veteran with more follow -up sessions might 
have more because the Veteran is more ambivalent abou t non -pharmacological pain 
treatments and is receiving more counseling because o f more need for it .  After the 
completion of the intent -to-treat analyses, the adherence indicator will be added to 
examine it as a potential mediator of response in the primary outcome analyses .

Enrollment  
The enrollment date is that day the individual has m et all the screening criteria and has 
agreed to participate in the study by [CONTACT_428356] -recorded informed consent.  
Baseline Assessments  
Measures to Characterize the Sample . 
• Socio -demographic Characteristics . A research assistant will collect self-reported  
socio- demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity, marital status, education, employm ent 
status, legal status, and military history) from Veterans during  baseline assessment.  
• Medical Diagnoses. We will extract medical diagnoses from electronic health records 
and the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. We will identi fy psychiatric (e.g., 
depression, anxiety, Traumatic Brain Injuries,107,108  and PTSD109,110) and substance 
use disorders in the EHR and VA Corporate Data Wareho use by [CONTACT_428357] -[ADDRESS_541986] measures of ps ychiatric conditions (e.g. the 
PTSD Checklist) to minimize participant burden and react ivity.  To increase the 
sensitivity of our detection of psychiatric conditions, we will extract the service -
connection claims data from the Veterans Benefits Manag ement System for study 
participants at the end of their study participation.   New recipi[INVESTIGATOR_428280] -
connection receive it for an average of 5.[ADDRESS_541987] a diagnosis i n VA treatment records 
because they were not treated for their mental healt h condition.   
• Characteristics of Musculoskeletal Disorders. We will de termine the diagnostic group 
of MSD assigned to participants in the EHR by [CONTACT_428358] D-[ADDRESS_541988] injury, fibromyal gia, rheumatoid arthritis, 
temporal mandibular disorder, lupus,  gout, and MSD multimorbidity (more than one 
MSD diagnosed). The broad MSD groups will be consid ered as potential moderators 
of treatment effect in the analyses. In addition, comp ensation examiners complete a 
detailed, structured form, the Disability Benefits Que stionnaire (DBQ), for each 
Veteran they evaluate. From these forms, we will ex tract structured notations of the 
examination findings.  Finally, we will obtain the f inal percentage service -connection 
awarded from the Veterans Benefits Administration System (VBMS) after the 
determination, and delineate service -connected conditions.  
 
Pain Measures : 
• Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). The Brief Pain Inventory111 (BPI) is a validated instrument 
to assess chronic non -cancer pain that yields two subscales.  One measures pain 
severity  (4 items on a 0 -10 scale) and the other assesses pain interference  with life 
activities (7 items on a 0 -10 scale), both using a [ADDRESS_541989] Guidelines and Considerations  35 of 67  Version 1.1 
  27 April 2020  severity  will serve as our primary pain outcome for the trial;  pain interference will 
serve as a secondary outcome. The BPI [CONTACT_832] a reliable measu re and responsive to 
change.112 The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_428281], Measu rement, and 
Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) group113 as a preferred measure of 
pain-related functioning . IMMPACT recommendations have specified score change s 
that would represent a minimally clinically important difference  (i.e., 30% reduction in 
pain severity and 1 -point reduction in pain interference), which will be  used in our 
cost analyses.114   
• Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) . The NRS115 is an 11 -point (0 = no pain, to 10 = worst 
pain imaginable) scale for current pain. It is the on ly pain measure collected at point -
of-care for every Veteran as part of the vital signs asses sment in Primary Care and 
entered into the EHR. The NRS has several shortcomin gs: a) Veterans may seek 
services when their pain levels are high, thereby [CONTACT_428359] g longitudinal improvements 
in pain intensity; b) point -of-care contacts vary substantially among Veterans in 
Primary Care, rendering systematic analysis of changes in p ain symptoms difficult to 
ascertain in a clinical trial; and c) point -of-care NRS significantly underestimates pain 
intensity compared to same -day paper -and-pencil NRS assessments.116 Balancing 
the ubiquitous use of NRS with its limitations, we will  examine EHR -abstracted NRS 
ratings for participants as a secondary outcome.  
• PEG117. The PEG is a 3 -item scale assessing pain intensity (P), interference w ith 
enjoyment of life (E), and interference with genera l activity (G)  during the past week . 
It has good reliability, constructive validity, and se nsitivity to change and has been 
required by [CONTACT_133815]-DoD-VA Pain Management Collaboratory Coordinating Center  
as a common measure across funded protocols.  
• High Impact Pain Questions . Three questions to determine the long -term impact  of 
pain are being asked:  “In the past [ADDRESS_541990] pain?” ; “Over 
the past 3 months, how often did pain limit your life or work a ctivities”; “Are you not 
working or unable to work due to pain or a pain condi tion?  
 Answer choices consist of “never”, “some days”, “most da ys” or “every day”  for the 
first two questions and  yes/no  for the third question .  
  
Pain Treatment Services Received : 
• Opi[INVESTIGATOR_428282]. We will extract dispens ed opi[INVESTIGATOR_428283]’s electronic medical record and convert them to morphine 
equivalent daily dose using the procedures from a pub lished algorithm118 as adopted 
and operationalized by [CONTACT_428360]3 Phenotypes and Outcome s workgroup. 
Medications will be classified as opi[INVESTIGATOR_428284]:  
(1) All non -IV fills of:  
   a) Codeine  
   b) Fentanyl  
   c) Hydrocodone

   a) Methadone  
(3) All transdermal or buccal fills of  
   a) Buprenorphine  
MEDD is calculated by [CONTACT_428361]. Total 
morphine equivalents are calculated by [CONTACT_428362] (milligram of op ioid per unit dispensed). Standard 
conversion factors on the CDC website will be used to  estimate the number of 
milligrams of morphine equivalents dispensed. Average da ily morphine equiva lent 
dose will be calculated by [CONTACT_428363] o f morphine equivalents by [CONTACT_428364]. For prescriptions that apn a particular mont h, only dates during that month 
will be included.  
The PMC3 Collaboratory recommends the following be c ollected,  and we will collect 
and analyze them per their recommendations:  
   a. Number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_428285]  
   b. Days supplied  
   c. a/b x conversion factor = milligrams morphine equiv alent daily dose (MEDD)  
   d. Mg MEDD at enrollment  
   e. Mg MEDD monthly during enrollment and at study com pletion.  
• Non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_428282]. We will extract dispensed  non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_428286] -
related medications from the medical record. These med ications will include topi[INVESTIGATOR_428287], non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, anticonvulsants, and 
antidepressants (specifically, selective serotonin and nor epi[INVESTIGATOR_428288]). The presence or  absence of medications in 
each class will be the dependent measure.  
• Non-pharmacological Pain Management Service Utilization -VA Records . [CONTACT_428406] 
and the PRIME Center have an algorithm for identify ing visits from the EHR 
involving non -pharmacological management using workload information  entered at 
clinic visits (e.g. diagnosis treated, procedure perform ed) and the type of clinic 
provid ing the treatment.  
• Natural Language Processing -identified Non -Pharmacological Pain Management 
Service Utilization -VA and non -VA service use . This identifies dates at which the 
Veteran has reported “current use” of specific pain m anagement modalities.  
• Self-Reported Use of Pain Treatment Services . The PMC3’s phenotype and 
outcomes workgroup developed the “Use of nonpharmacological and self -care 
approaches” questionnaire to collect information abo ut patients’ use of 13 different 
pain treatments, including Acupuncture, Rehabilitation  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Manipulation, 
Massage, Yoga, Tai Chi/Qigong, Exercise, Biofeedback, Hy pnosis/ Hypnotherapy, 
Guided Imagery, Meditation, Psychotherapy/Counseling. In addition to asking about 
whether each treatment category was used, the instru ment also includes questions 
about the most important reason for use, whether th e treatment was received from a 
practitioner, the type of setting of use, how the se rvice was paid for, how often it was 
used, and how effective it was in relieving pain. Th e instrument was modified for this 
study  to collect information over the past 3 months (inste ad of past year), and to 
include several additional categories: Reiki, Pain S chool, Pain Clinic, primary care 
services, emergency/urgent care services, opi[INVESTIGATOR_428289] -opi[INVESTIGATOR_158263].   
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  37 of 67  Version 1.1 
  27 April 2020     
Substance Use Measures : 
• ASSIST . Substance use will be measured over the last [ADDRESS_541991] (ASSIST). After 
a screening question focusing on substances ever used, the ASSIST consists of 
seven questions about use of and consequences of use of each of ten classes of 
substances over the preceding three months (includin g nicotine). Scores are 
generated for each substance that are mapped to a t hree-point ordinal s cale of 
severity.119 As outlined in the World Health Organization’s Manual describing the use 
of the ASSIST to guide treatment recommendations, t he ASSIST ratings are scaled 
to represent no need for treatment, need for a brie f intervention, and need for an 
intensive intervention.  An advantage of the ASSIST is that these categories 
represent what clinicians consider a clinically import ant difference, in that they guide 
treatment recommendations. The items in the ASSIST h ave been shown to have 
good to excellent reliability for the substances assay ed. The reliability of the 
individual ASSIST items,[ADDRESS_541992]’s concurrent validity compared to oth er 
more detailed assessments of substance use severity121 have justified its adoption 
by [CONTACT_38375].122 We will obtain additional specifiers for 
substances requiring further characterization: a spec ifier about use of vapi[INVESTIGATOR_428290], a specification as to whether the Ve teran is using legal or 
prescribed cannabis  and specification about use of prescribed amphetamine . 
• Prescription Opi[INVESTIGATOR_289031] . Two questions,123 adapted from the CIDI124 for use in a 
NIDA Clinical Trials Network study,125 will be used to describe misuse of prescribed 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007]: “How often have you taken your pain medications in l arger 
amounts than prescribed or for a longer period than p rescribed?” and “How often 
have you used your pain medicines to get high, to re lax, or to make you feel more 
alert?” The questions are asked about the preceding 4 weeks, with follow -up 
questions to clarify that the question refers to opio ids only.  
• Nail Collection and Measurement . Nail clippi[INVESTIGATOR_428291] (ethyl glucuronide i.e. ETG), cannabinoids ( carboxy -THC, native -THC), 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (6 -MAM, codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine,  oxymorphone, 
oxycodone), Amphetamines (amphetamine, MDA, MDEA, MDM A, 
methamphetamine), Cocaine (benzoylecgonine, cocaeth ylene, cocaine, norcoc aine) 
and Phencyclidine (PCP).  The tests are highly specific .  Samples are analyzed 
using an immunoassay technique (ELISA) and non -negative specimens are 
subjected to a gold standard confirmation technique ( GCMS or other method, 
depending on drug class). Nail, like hair, traps biomar kers in keratin but has higher 
concentrations of neutral and acidic biomarkers becaus e it has thicker keratin. In a 
study of hair and nails collected from the same peopl e, the rate of Carboxy -THC (an 
acidic biomarker for cannabis) positives for cannabinoid  at the SAMHSA -
recommended cutoff was 46.7% for hair and 53.3% for  fingernails and mean 
concentrations of the metabolite were five -fold higher in nails than in hair.126 In a 
study in the journal Addiction  of 606 college students,127 nail ETG at the 8 pg/mg 
threshold proposed for this study detected high -risk drinking with a sensitivity of 1.[ADDRESS_541993] 
up to 9 months.  The detection window (3 -6 months) is close to the timeframe of the 
ASSIST (90 days), making cross -validation by [CONTACT_428365].   
Approximately 100 mg of nail is required for analysis, w hich can be obtained 
from 2mm (a quarter’s width) of nail from each of te n digits. Samples will be mailed 
from home and thus un -observed, and participants will be provided with kits  for the 
nail clipp ing, and a financial incentive of $[ADDRESS_541994] Veterans set reminders to allow for  growth before clippi[INVESTIGATOR_428292].  
To reduce the risk that Veterans pass off someone else’ s fingernails as their 
own, they will be asked if the nails are theirs, and p aid regardless of whether they 
are. Specimen substitution when there are contingen cies for positive urines occurs, 
but there  is no incentive for such false reporting when paymen t is provided 
regardless of the sample results. The samples will be  mailed in coded envelopes 
addressed to our group, further reducing the likelih ood of submitting someone else’s 
fingernails.   
• Samples will be processed at the [LOCATION_002] Drug Testing Laboratories (Illinois). 
After processing, samples will be destroyed following  a standard storage period. 
Sample analysis uses fully validated methods that have been inspected and 
approved by [CONTACT_428366].  Substance Use Treatment Service 
Utilization -VA Records . Visits from the EHR involving substance use treatmen t will 
be identified conservatively, using an algorithm invol ving workload information 
entered at clinic visits (e.g. diagnosis treated, proce dure performed) and the type of 
clinic providing the treatment.  The measure does not  capture much substance 
abuse counseling in primary care settings, and in co njunction with other mental 
health treatment (i.e. , PTSD treatment).  For this reason, self -reported substance 
use service utilization will be collected (see below).  
• Self-Reported Use of Substance Use Treatment Services: Using the same format as 
the pain treatment service use questions described ab ove, we will inquire about 
whether  each of a number of classes of treatments was received  in the preceding 12 
weeks (substance use counseling, day program, residen tial, ER/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], self -help, 
counseling at a medical visit, counseling at a visit fo r a psychiatric condition, opi[INVESTIGATOR_428293], smoking cessation counseling, nicotine replacem ent therapy 
prescribed).    
• Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT -C)128.  This is an alcohol screen 
used to identify patients who are hazardous drinkers  or have active alcohol use 
disorders (including alcohol abuse or dependence). It  consists of three questions: 
“how often did you have a drink containing alcohol i n the past ye ar?”, “how many 
drinks did you have on a typi[INVESTIGATOR_428294]”, and 
“how often did you have six or more drinks on one occ asion in the past year”. It is 
scored on a scale of 0 (no use) through 12. In men, a score of [ADDRESS_541995] Guidelines and Considerations  39 of 67  Version 1.1 
  27 April 2020   
Other Measures : 
• Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9). The PHQ -9 is a well validated screening 
measure for depression129 and will be used to identify probable depression as a 
covariate in analyses. It will also identify suicidal ide ation, which if severe, will trigger 
the need for further assessment (detailed in Human Su bjects).  
• EQ-5D-5L. The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status designed t o 
provide a single index value of health for clinical a nd economic appraisals. It 
consists of five questions in the domains of mobility, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. .130 
• Motivation for engaging  in pain treatment131,132. Motivation for Change Scale to 
include 3 items (analogue scale coded from 1 to 100) t appi[INVESTIGATOR_428295], recognition of pain treatme nts as important, and pain 
treatment motivation.  
• COVID -[ADDRESS_541996] had on Veterans’ social determinants of health,  access to pain treatment, and 
access to substance use treatmen t. 
 
Qualitative Measures Collected in UG3 Phase and then  again at the end of the UH3 
Phase : 
• Relational Coordination Survey. This survey, will be a dministered post -trial to “hub” 
SBIRT -PM clinicians and “spoke” clinical and administrative st aff in Compensation 
and Pension and Primary Care to examine how pain car e was coordinated to meet 
the treatment needs of compensation -seeking Veterans.  It includes seven 
dimensions: frequency of communication, timeliness of c ommunication, accuracy of 
communication, problem -solving, shared goals, shared knowledge, mutual respec t). 
Respondents indicate the frequency in which each dimensi on exists in their setting 
on a 5 -point scale. The mean of the  individual scores serves as the overall RC score 
for each dimension within each spoke site.  
• Post-Trial Semi -Structured Qualitative Interview. At the end of the t rial, we will 
conduct in -depth interviews with “hub” SBIRT clinicians and “spok e” clinical and 
administrative staff in Compensation and Pension and Primary Care to assess the 
organization and coordination of pain management ser vices, given their experiences 
with SBIRT -PM implementation.  
 
Randomization  
The urn randomization covariates are: site (8 sites of VISN1), sex (M/F), race (White, 
Black, Other), ethnicity (Hispanic/Non- Hispanic ), and self -reported illicit drug use 
(Yes/No). Following enrollment and Baseline assessments, the Pr oject Director  will 
enter covariates into urn randomization program to determine intervention condition  
assignment . Randomization will occur within two weeks of the enro llment date.   
 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_541997] study data will be blin d to participants’ treatment 
assignment. Veterans will be instructed during the assessments no t to tell the research 
assistant if they are receiving study counseling. To de termine if the blind was 
maintained, the research assistant will be asked to what condition each Veteran was 
assigned.  The PIs and Project Director will not be blind to ra ndomization, as they will be 
assigning study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_428296], 
reviewing counseling sessions for quality/fidelity, and c onducting monthly supervision 
with study counselors. The statistician has no contact w ith the study veterans; she will 
not be blinded.   
  
6.2.4 Follow -up Visits  
 
Research assistants will schedule telephone follow -up inte rviews approximately 12 
weeks (+ 4 weeks ) and 36 weeks (+ 4 weeks) after baseline visits. A 4 -week window for 
follow -up appointments allows for flexibility in scheduling an d provides sufficient time to 
complete assessments if an appointment is missed .  
 
Week 12 Follow -up 
See schedule of evaluations table and descriptions a bove.  
• Distance to nearest VA Facility. We will calculate the  driving distance from the 
Veterans’ address to the nearest VA medical facility providing integrated pain 
services care services.  Calculations will be done using google maps.  
 
Week 36 Follow -up 
See schedule of evaluations table and descriptions a bove.  
 
End-of-Study  
• Qualitative interview of stakeholders  
• Relational Coordinator survey of key stakeholders  
• Treatment fidelity: Independent T ape Rater Scale 
6.2.5 Completion/ Final Evaluation  
Participants’ final visit is the Week 36 follow -up. Participants will be contact[CONTACT_428367] 
12 and 36 follow -up visits regardless of whether they engaged in study counseling. If 
the 12 -week  follow -up visit is missed and not completed within 4 weeks of t he 
appointment date, that follow -up will be missed and participant will be contact[CONTACT_154690] r final 
week 36 follow -up visit.   
 Participation in study assessments and study counseling  is voluntary. 
Participants can participate in study assessments and ch oose not to engage in 
counseling. Reasons for terminating a participant prior to week 36 are: 
• Participant is found to not be eligible for the study after enrollment  
• Participant withdraws consent for further contact  
[CONTACT_156536]  [ADDRESS_541998]  of study assessments or other interactions with participant s.   
Expected adverse experiences include : 
• Counseling session or study procedures upsets particip ant 
Criteria for management: Careful training of study staff and SBIRT -PM 
counselors will precede study initiation.  If a participant complains about study 
procedures  or counseling sessions , the complaint will be logged and will be 
brought to the attention of the mPIs.  Depending on the nature of the complaint, 
mPIs will decide whether the complain t requires follow -up directly with the 
participant.  
• Suicidal ideation detected by [CONTACT_127659] -9 or by [CONTACT_428368]: item 9  in the PHQ -9 identifies potential suicidal ideation  
(the questions asks about “thoughts of being better of f dead or of hurting yourself 
in some way” ). It is collected at baseline and at 12- and 36 -week follow -ups. Any 
positive response (response other than “none at all ”) to this question will be 
further evaluated, as well as other expressions of su icidality to the research 
assistant or SBIRT -PM clinician. Positive responses will be evaluated by [CONTACT_428369] , Site -PIs, or covering providers. The response to clinical emergencies 
will be delineated in the Service Use Agreements betwe en the hub site and 
spoke for provision of SBIRT -PM. If the research team decides that the 
information must be reported, the person who spoke t o the Veteran (clinician or 
research assistant) will contact [CONTACT_198991]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_428297], and 
if he or she is not available, the clinician designat ed by [CONTACT_428370]. All VISN [ADDRESS_541999]

  27 April 2020  proposed in this application (Rosen et al., 2018).  T here were no study -related adverse 
events in that study, and they are unlikely in this stu dy as well.   
7.3 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurr ence in a subject during 
participation in the research study. Veterans with MS D have a high frequency of 
medical and psychiatric difficulties. Therefore, changes  in medication regimen, the 
presence of medication side effects and symptom exace rbations are not untoward and 
do not constitute adverse events.  
Anticipated adverse events include complaints about the  study procedures and 
the counseling intervention, and any occurrence in wh ich the patient attributes 
discomfort, harm or disability to the study procedures.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) are adverse events that res ult in: death, a life -
threatening experience, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the need  for medical, surgical, behavioral, 
social or other interventions to prevent such outcomes . Any report that a patient 
require d overnight treatment in any facility (emergency room,  detoxification, and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) will constitute a SAE. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_428298] a SAE.    
7.[ADDRESS_542002]. Rosen wil l include a description of the event 
and a summary of recent contacts with the patient. Th is summary will include any 
warning signs of the adverse event, the patient’s gen eral state and any information 
suggesting a causal link between study participation a nd the event.  
 SAEs that are unanticipated, serious, and possibly rel ated to the study 
intervention will be reported to the Independent Safety Monitor(s), IRB, and NCCIH  in 
accordance with requirements.   
• Unexpected fatal or life -threatening AEs related to the intervention will be 
reported to the NCCIH Program Officer, and Independent Safety Monitor (s) 
within 3 days of the investigator becoming aware of t he event.   
• Other unexpected SAEs that are related or probably study related will be 
reported to the IRB, NCCIH Program Officer, and Independent S afety Monitor(s) 
within 5 days. 
• SAEs and AEs that do not meet criteria for reporting w ithin five working days in 
accordance with VHA Handbook 1058.01 will be reporte d to the Central IRB  and 
the Independent Safety Monitor(s) ,at the time of continuing review (overall total 
and summary of types of events that occurred)  in accordance with their 
requirements.  Such events  will be reported to NCCIH on an annual basis.    
• All other AEs documented during the course of the trial wi ll be reported to NCCIH 
on an annual basis by [CONTACT_428372].  The 
Independent Safety Monitor(s) Report will state that all AEs have been reviewed . 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_542003] emergency room facilities and a suicide preventi on coordination team. If the 
participant’s situation precludes management by [CONTACT_428373] (e.g. the Veteran is 
not accessible to VA staff or the site PI), the Resea rch Assistant will immediately 
consult with one of the mPIs about ways to handle the situation, including calling for a 
police safety check on the Veteran .  
 
7.6 Safety Monitoring   
A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will b e appointed by [CONTACT_428374], assess the adequacy of ongoing enrollmen t & site performance, ensure 
adequacy of data acquisition & protocol adherence and  evaluate overall safety 
throughout  trial implementation.  The DSMC will meet at least annually after trial 
initiation. A DSMC Charter Document outlining the o perating guidelines for the 
committee, the frequency of planned meetings and the specific data presentation format 
will be agreed upon during the initial meeting of t he DSMC. Study reports will be created 
by [CONTACT_428375], following a standardized fo rmat, as directed by [CONTACT_6802]. 
The DSMC will report directly to NCCIH.    
  
 Study progress and safety will be reviewed annually dur ing the RCT. Progress 
reports, including patient recruitment, retention/at trition, and AEs will be provided to the 
DSMB annually. This Annual Report will include a list and summary of AEs. In addition,  
the Annual Report will address (1) whether AE rates are consistent with pre -study 
assumptions; (2) reason for dropouts from the study; ( 3) whether all participants met 
entry criteria; (4) whether continuation of the stud y is justified on the basis that 
additional data are needed to accomplish the stated objectives  of the study; and (5) 
conditions whereby [CONTACT_428376]. The Annual Report will 
be sent to the Independent Monitor(s) and will be fo rwarded to the VA Central IRB and 
the NCCIH Program Officer within 1 month of each mon itoring rev iew.   
8. INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
This study will be stopped prior to its completion if : (1) the intervention is associated 
with adverse effects that call into question the safe ty of the intervention; (2) difficulty in 
study recruitment or retention will significantly imp act the ability to  evaluate the study 
endpoints; (3) any new information becomes available d uring the trial that necessitates 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]; or (4) other situations occur tha t might warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356].  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  44 of 67  Version 1.1 
  27 April 2020  9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 General Design Issues   
The pragmatic two-arm, parallel groups 36 -week randomized controlled single blind trial 
design was selected based on findings from a complet ed pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (Rosen et al., 
2018).  The study design parameters ---components of the intervention and its duration, 
duration of follow -up, and effect size estimates ---were largely derived from that study.  
Treatment -as-usual was selected as a control condition because t he question to be 
answered by [CONTACT_428377].  
 Our main objective is to test the effectiveness of SBI RT-PM, compared to Usual 
Care (UC), when delivered within a VISN1 -wide hub -and-spoke network.  
 Hypothesis 1 : SBIRT -PM will be more effective than UC in reducing pain severity 
as measured by [CONTACT_7854] (primary outc ome #1).  
 Hypothesis 2 : SBIRT -PM will be more effective than UC in reducing the nu mber 
of substances categorized as requiring any interventi on (primary outcome #2) as 
identified by [CONTACT_186413] -report  (ASSIST)  or toxicolog ical analysis of nail clippi[INVESTIGATOR_14839].   
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization  
 Given there are two primary outcomes (change in pain severity from the BPI, 
change in the number of substances whose use requires  intervention based on the 
ASSIST), Bonferroni correction was used to generate  a p-value of .025 for the sample 
size calculations for each outcome.  
 The planned (randomized) sample size is 1100 with sample selection at each site  
proportional to the size of the site. This sample siz e was based on power=.90 using 
alpha=.025, and an expected ES of d=.25 for pain  severity . Breakdown as follows: 400 
per group divided by ‘1 – loss to follow -up’ (73%) = 548 x 2 groups= 1096. Clustering 
was removed from the calculation  per the advice of the PMC3 Biostatistics workgroup 
leadership  during our protocol review. Instead , site will be controlled in analyses and a 
site by [CONTACT_428378] . In addition, power was increased to 90% 
based on their advice.  
 The planned sample size allows for 27% attrition. Val ues are based on previous 
related work and our 12 -week pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. In Poisson modeling of our pi[INVESTIGATOR_428299], SBIRT 
was associated with a baseline -adjusted relative rate of pain -related appointments 
attended (a proposed mediator of SBIRT -PM) of RR (Exp(B))=1.6. 
 For substance use, the proportion converting to low  risk on at least one 
substance in the treatment group was estimated as 27%  and in UC as 10%. Attrition 
was set at 27%. For 90% power (alpha=.025), the cal culations resulted in sample size 
of 128 per group divided by ‘1 – loss to follow -up’ (73%) = 176 x 2 groups= [ADDRESS_542004] 
size (absolute value of 6% between groups) would be d etectable for the substance use 
outcome with 90% power.   In the UG3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 67% of the participants at baseline 
self-reported on the ASSIST a level of risky substance use ( either alcohol, tobacco or 
other drugs) that would require intervention  and 33% reported risky alcohol use .  
Projected to the full trial, this suggests [ADDRESS_542005] changes in 
our primary substance use outcome.  
 
 
Treatment Assignment Procedures  
The unit of randomization is participant. Participants w ill be randomized to SBIRT or 
Usual Care using a computerized urn randomization progr am within each site to 
increase the likelihood of balanced allocation of pa rticipants to the two interventions on 
several covariates: sex (male/female), race ( White , Black ), ethnicity (Hispanic /Non -
Hispanic ), and self -reported illicit drug use within 90 days (Yes/No) . All randomization 
will be done by [CONTACT_32808] . 
Urn randomization preserves randomization as the prima ry basis for assignment 
to treatment and is less susceptible to experimenter b ias or manipulation of the 
allocation process by [CONTACT_428379]. The ur n randomization algorithm allows 
probability of assignment to fluctuate as a function of the degree of covariate imbalance.  
As a study's sample size increases, urn and simple rand omization converge  because 
the treatment assignment probabilities under urn ran domization converge asymptotically 
to the  simple randomization probabilities.  
 
Blinding  
Research assistants who collect study data will be blin d to participants’ treatment 
assignment. Veterans will be instructed during the assessments no t to tell the research 
assistant if they are receiving study counseling. To de termine if the blind was 
maintained, the research assistant will be asked to wha t condition each Veteran was 
assigned.   
The PIs and Project Director will not be blind to ra ndomization, as they will be 
assigning study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_428296], 
reviewing counseling sessions for quality/fidelity, an d conducting monthly supervision 
with s tudy counselors. The statistician has no contact [CONTACT_190365] e study veterans; she will 
not be blinded.   
 
 
9.3  Definition of Populations  
  
 The study will occur within the eight VISN -1 VA medical centers (VAMC) located 
across six New England States. The medical centers are : Bedford VAMC; [LOCATION_011] 
Healthcare System; Central Western [LOCATION_005]; Conne cticut Healthcare System; 
Maine Healthcare System, Manchester VAMC, Providence  VAMC, and White River 
Junction.  
 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria:  
 Inclusion criteria: 1) post -9/11 Veteran applying for MSD -related compensation  
(specified as back, neck, shoulder, or knee pain), as as certained from filed claim, 2) 
reports a score of  ≥4 (threshold for moderately severe pain)  on the BPI’s Pain Severity 
subscale (average of four pain intensity items); 3) avai lability of a landline or cellular 
telephone for SBIRT -PM.  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  46 of 67  Version 1.1 
  27 April 2020   Exclusion criteria : 1) reports inability to participate during the study  enrollment 
call; 2) received three or more non -pharmacological pain treatment modalities within the  
last 12 weeks from VA, and 3) participation in another PMC3 study as evidenced by a  
research protocol alert for that study at the time t he study invitation letter is mailed .   
 
 Participants who complete the baseline assessment and a re randomized to their 
treatment assignment will be the Intent to treat (IT T) population for analysis. The per -
protocol analyses will specify patients who participated the treatment and be conducted 
by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] a variable indicating participation (Yes /No) in the ITT analyses. We will give 
precedence to the results of the ITT analysis over th e PP analysis.  
 
9.4 Interim Analyses  and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_428300].  An in -person version of the proposed intervention was 
tested in a completed study by [CONTACT_78168] (Rosen et al ., 2018).  There were no study -
related adverse events.   
 
There are no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  
 
9.5 Outcomes  
 
9.5.1 Primary Outcome   
 
The two primary outcomes are pain severity as measured by [CONTACT_55817]  [INVESTIGATOR_428301] “no intervention” threshold in t he ASSIST.  We initially planned 
that when a positive toxicology result disagrees with a self -report of no use, the middle 
value on the ordinal scale (the indication to receive brief intervention) would be derived 
and used as the primary substance use outcome. However , only 64% of participants 
returned nail samples at baseline, and this percentag e dropped to 58% and 49% at 
week [ADDRESS_542006] 
assessments. Further, depending upon the substance and  timepoint, between 43% and 
48% of participants self -reporting a level of substance use that does not re quire an 
intervention, the group whose substance use classific ation would change with positive 
nail toxicology, did not have toxicology results. Given  the amount of missing toxicology 
data and that nails do not measure intervention need directly like the ASSIST, we plan 
to base our primary substance use outcome on the ASSI ST measure only. This change 
does not compromise our estimated power since the nu mber of participants self -
reporting a level of risky substance use that require s an intervention on the ASSIST 
(N=571) exceeds our assumed total sample size for thi s outcome (N=352) used in 
power analyses.  The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_428302], week 1 2 and week 36.  
 
9.5.2 Secondary Outcomes   
 
Secondary outcomes related to pain include non -pharmacological pain management 
service utilization, pain interference with life activities (BPI), overall pain (PEG), and 
overall health .   The non -pharmacological pain management service utilization wi ll be 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  47 of 67  Version 1.1 
  27 April 2020  summed across 13 possible modalities (injection; physic al therapy; chiropractic care; 
acupuncture; TENS; Spi[INVESTIGATOR_55441]; cognitiv e behavioral therapy; 
mindfulness/acceptance and community therapy; treatmen t involving teaching about 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_54241]; yoga, Tai chi or Reiki; massage tre atment; other treatment not already 
mentioned) as well as examined by [CONTACT_428380] s ufficient sample size is 
present.  
 Secondary outcomes related to substance use will incl ude severity measures for 
individual substances generated by [CONTACT_428327], as w ell as toxicology results for 
individual substances.   
 
9.6 Data Analyses   
  
All variables (Intervention, covariates and outcomes) will be described with the use of 
the approximate summary statistics (mean, median, inter quartile range, and percent). 
Multivariate models will be used following the examina tion of bivariate tests of ou tcomes 
by [CONTACT_65237]. A successful outcome will be e ither a reduction in pain  severity  or 
number of substance use  above the “no intervention” threshold in the ASSIST or 
toxicologi cal analysis of nail clippi[INVESTIGATOR_14839] . The model type will be selected based on 
meeting of modeling assumptions including the outcome  distribution; Potential models 
will include linear and non -linear mixed -effects (Poisson (with over -dispersion), negative 
binomial, binary outcome) regression modeling.  If there is a large skew with many zeros 
(which is quite possible where the outcome is change in  the number of substances no 
longer needing intervention), we will use a negativ e binomial. If the distribution is a 
combination of 0’s (no change) and 1’s (change to level  of “no need for intervention” in 
one substance) with very few outcomes greater than [ADDRESS_542007] a 
Poisson distribution.  
These common rules will be used for guidance:  
• Poisson distribution, if mean = variance  
• Binomial distribution, if mean > variance  
• Negative binomial distribution, if mean < variance  
The covariance structure s will be explored to determine which (unstructured, com pound 
symmetry, autoregressive) is the most appropriate in mix ed models. Selection will be 
based on the lowest AIC. An intervention by [CONTACT_428381] 
– this will show the  effect of the intervention on the outcome compared to  controls.  
 Change in Pain: We anticipate using linear mixed -effects modeling to test the 
effect of SBIRT- PM on the [ADDRESS_542008].   
Change in Substance Use: We anticipate using non -linear mixed -effects 
(Poisson, negative binomial, binary outcome  as discussed above) regression modeling 
to test the effect of SBIRT- PM on the number of substances requiring interventi on 
(according to the ASSIST), a count outcome.  One subs et of analyses will use risk sets 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  48 of 67  Version 1.1 
  27 April 2020  (at least [ADDRESS_542009] 2 substa nces at baseline, etc.) to analyze 
substance risk changes in substance users. We will also test the equality of treatment 
effects at weeks [ADDRESS_542010] identified stratification variables to accoun t for error variance as a 
recommended good practice. Key covariates to be inc luded in the model are 
depression, TBI, and mental health diagnoses (group ed into multiple more homogenous 
groupi[INVESTIGATOR_14839], such as mood and psychotic disorders) as thes e are highly related to pain 
perception and substance abuse as well as the urn cov ariates – namely sex , race, 
ethnicity, self -reported illicit drug use and site. The strata used for the urn randomization 
are only to better ensure balance on key characteri stics. Their main effects will not be 
interpreted in the analysis, though they will be exam ined as potential modifiers of the 
intervention effect. We will also consider as potenti al covariates: distance to nearest VA 
medical center, number of pain treatment modalities used at baseline, reasons patient 
might drop out of the study, and the probability of withdrawal. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -use will be 
examined as a mediator as well as a tertiary outcome.   Actual participation in SBIRT -
PM (Y /N) will be examined as a mediator of response.    
Per NIH policy, because there is considerable data sugges ting the importance of 
race, ethnicity  and sex  on the study outcomes (pain, substance use and service use), 
we will conduct an analysis that examines  sex and race/ethnicity as moderators  of 
treatment response. These analyses will be conducted  through the inclusion of 
interaction effects in models so sex and race/ethnicity effects can be formally tested.  In 
light of the differences in substance use, body hab itus, and substance metabolism 
between men and women, we will include a sex interaction term for the analysis of the 
relationship between self -reported levels of substance use and levels of ETG fo und in 
nail clippi[INVESTIGATOR_14839].  While the use of subgroup analysis might be interestin g to look at sex -
specific characteristics such as the influence of pregn ancy or stage of menstrual cycle, 
we currently have no relevant covariates making the case for this type of sub -analysis . 
 
 
Sensitivity Analysis  
We anticipate some missingness will occur not completely at random. In general, m ore 
sensitive information such as use of illicit substan ces is less likely to be shared by 
[CONTACT_428382] .  Based on our previous study (R34), we 
anticipate there might be a difference in the follow -up rate between Veterans in the two 
arms of the trial, with veterans in the usual care a rm more frequently droppi[INVESTIGATOR_41248]. We 
have created scenarios to minimize missing data through design  considerations (i.e., 
increasing our payment scale as incentive , regular reminder calls ), but our analytic plan 
includes the  investigat ion of  missingness . Patterns of missingness will be examined by 
[CONTACT_428383] (univariate, mo notone or non -monotone). C hi-
squares and t -tests will be run to see if missingness is related to ot her variables in the 
analysis (for example : intervention status, substance use). We intend to  utilize multiple 
imputation in the case of variables missing either completely at random or at rando m. 
To reduce the likelihood of MNAR , the multiple imputation model will include “ auxiliary 
variables ” which are highly correlated with both the variable th at has missing data and 
the probability that the variable is missi ng. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted as part 
of the multiple imputation procedur e in SAS 9.4 (PROC MI) .  
 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  49 of 67  Version 1.1 
  27 April 2020  Sources of data  
Data for the study are drawn from patient self -report, VA electronic medical records of 
VA and community care, and the C&P examination. Veter ans requesting a 
Compensation & Pension evaluation for knee, shoulde r, neck or back pain may or not 
be receiving services from the VA. Persons who get all  their care outside of the VA will 
not have readily accessible medical records, while tho se persons who get some care in 
the VA but are sent out to community care for distinc t services (such as non -
pharmacological pain management) will have medical re cords of both types of care. In 
addition, those veterans who had not used any VA ser vices prior to their C&P request 
may then enter VA care following their C&P exam and will have EMR available only in 
the follow -up period.  The lack of EMR data of non -users of the VA will affect both the 
intervention or control arms of the study, and there is no reason to believe its effect will 
be differential.   
Acknowledging the variability in availability of EMR in formation, all subjects will 
have self -reported and C&P data regarding service use as well a s diagnoses. We will 
examine the concordance of self -reported and EMR -obtained information to estimate 
the impact of having no EMR data in the non -users of the VA. We will conduct a 
sensitivity analysis sub -setting the analyses only to those persons with availabl e EMR 
(as well as self -reported and C&P data).  
 
 
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis  
The relative cost -effectiveness of SBIRT -PM will be assessed using both incremental 
cost- effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and cost -effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). 
ICERs and CEACs will be calculated from the provider ( i.e., VISN and medical center) 
perspective. Using the cost estimates described in the Assessment subsection, we will 
calculate ICERs for minimal clinically important differe nces (MCID) between baseline 
and week -36 assessments in three primary outcomes: self -reported pain, risky alcohol 
use, and morphine -equivalent doses of opi[INVESTIGATOR_428303].  
• Pain. Self -reported pain severity  and interference will be measured by [CONTACT_428384] (BPI). A MCID in pain severity  will be a 30% reduction in ratings on this 
BPI [INVESTIGATOR_428304] 36. The MCID for pain functioning will be a [ADDRESS_542011] followed the guidelines 
Erin Krebs followed in the SPACE trial for selectin g an MCID.  She states in her 
group’s 2018 JAMA report of the SPACE trial:   “Following consensus guidelines, this 
trial used a 1 -point difference as the MCID for BPI [INVESTIGATOR_418798] a nd BPI [CONTACT_926], and 
used a 30% reduction from baseline as MCID for mode rate improvement. ” 
• Substance Use . As noted earlier, the ASSIST categories represent what clinicians 
consider a clinically important difference, in that a difference the differences in risk 
category guide treatment. Therefore, we will conside r a net  decrease of one risk 
category (i.e. need for less overall treatment) acros s substances as the MCID.  
The ICERs will measure the incremental cost of usin g SBIRT -PM to produce a 
MCID in each of the outcomes. We will conclude SBIRT -PM’s cost -effectiveness for 
each outcome based on its ICER with respect to the t hreshold value placed by [CONTACT_428385]. By [CONTACT_428386], we can determine 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_542012] 
estimates of SBIRT- PM will be bootstrapped (with 2,000 replicates) to pr oduce 
confidence intervals around the ICERs and to produce CE ACs for each outcome 
measure.[ADDRESS_542013] -
effectiveness results to alternative assumptions about  a wide variety of implementation  
parameters (e.g., cost of inputs).  
 
Budget Impact Analysis .  
 To demonstrate the financial feasibility of adopting SB IRT-PM, a budget impact 
analysis will be conducted. The per -person cost of SBIRT -PM will comprise the cost of 
delivering the intervention plus the cost of the VA -funded  services used by [CONTACT_428387] -PM condition over and above the cost of those used by 
[CONTACT_428388], minus the yearly patient allocatio n (VERA dollars) assigned to that 
participant. The total projected yearly cost to a gi ven medical cent er of SBIRT -PM will 
be the per -perso n cost times the total number of Veterans applying for compensation 
and pension for a musculoskeletal condition times the  expected rate of uptake.  
 
Analyses of NLP Algorithms  
 We will identify the use of non -pharmacological pain modalities through self -
report from the participants as well as two different  approaches to the extraction of 
healthcare utilization data from electronic medical re cords.  Medical record extraction of 
1.)  Structured data - stop codes indicating use of these modalities, and 2 .) Unstructured 
data - domains identified in the application of the NLP me thod to the medical record 
data of study participants. Two independent researcher s will identify words/snippets that 
suggest use of specific non -pharma modalities and rate enough snippets to have 
software reliably generate an algorithm to rate all p atients included in the study on each 
modality (machine learning). As we expect false posit ive reports of use of a modality to 
be unlikely, identification of use during an assessment  period by [CONTACT_428389] (self -report, medical record stop codes and NLP) will be c onsidered use.   The 
agreement between these different measures will be d escribed by [CONTACT_12783] -tabs. 
 
10. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
10.[ADDRESS_542014] info rmation for all study subjects on 
the “Participant Screening and Contacts Form”. Inform ation will be collected by 
[CONTACT_156536]  [ADDRESS_542015] all baseline and follo w-up interview data  by 
[CONTACT_428390]. They will e nter data directly into REDCap 
questionnaires. Research assistants are blind to parti cipant’s randomization group. 
REDCap questionnaires and data are saved in VA REDC ap and in a restricted research 
folder on secure VA networked computers. VA REDCap ca n only be accessed on the 
secure VA Network.  
Electronic medical record data will be accessed and sto red on the VA Informatics 
and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) platform and i n a restricted research folder on 
secure VA networked computers.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_542016] questionnaires 
will be created and used for data collection. After data are collected, REDCap provides 
automate d export procedures for data to be downloaded to Ex cel and common 
statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, R) for data analysis. In  these programs, filters flag 
data that needs to be re -checked by a person such as unclear characters, out -of-range 
variables and logical inconsistencies. The project dir ector and project statistician will 
check files monthly so that errors can be readily correct ed and consequential 
differences between treatment types (e.g., differen t levels of attrition) can be monitored 
closely.  
10.[ADDRESS_542017]. Martino will provide competency -based supervision to support the counselors ’ 
delivery of SBIRT -PM throughout the trial. This approach is consistent w ith the national 
VA Evidence -Based Practice training model,[ADDRESS_542018]. Martino will meet with the counselors  together on a 1 -hour monthly 
basis to review their SBIRT -PM practice. For these supervision meetings, he will l isten 
to and rate the clinicians’ SBIRT -PM fidelity for two sessions per counselor  (one initial 
and one follow -up call) using the Independent Tape Rater Sc ale [ADDRESS_542019] the PIs about  participant 
responses that are not obvious to code within the o ffered choice options.   
The research assistant will also be knowledgeable about  the emergency facilities 
(emergency rooms, VA Police, and crisis services) at each VISN1 medical center. The 
research assistant will also receive training in de -escalating agitated Veterans.  
COVID -19 response: the research assistants collecting self -report data about 
pain and substance use service utilization will prompt  veterans to consider in -person 
and all telehealth/virtual and telephone -delivered services when responding to our 
service utilization assessment.

Project Direc tor will check files monthly so that errors can be read ily corrected and 
consequential differences between treatment types (e. g., different levels of attrition) can 
be monitored closely. Data quality will be monitored by [CONTACT_428391]. Recruitment and retention dat a will be reviewed and reported 
to study leadership monthly.  
 
We will collect data about SBIRT -PM implementation. Specifically, we will report 
the percentage of participants who received different “doses” of the intervention (i.,e., 0, 
1, 2, 3, or 4 sessions).  We also will track the percen tage of each counselor’s ass igned 
Veterans who receive counseling and the percentage wh ose first counseling session is during the same telephone call.  If a 
question is refused by [CONTACT_428392] a

and 55% of those who received any counseling had at least two sessions. If a counselor 
falls below 70% of participants receiving any counselin g within 12 weeks or below 50% 
of a second session among those with a first, we wil l take the following steps: 1) 
compare that counselor’s procedures to “best practices ” by [CONTACT_428393].  Such best 
practices might include time of day Veterans are cal led, and the negotiation a round 
scheduling the calls; and 2) contact [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_428305] -optimal engagement 
is a site -specific issue.  Two examples of site -specific issues are cell phone reception 
and local VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_428306].  In very rural ar eas, poor cell phone coverage makes 
participation more difficult, and it may be more diff icult to engage Veterans when the VA 
facilities in their local communities have a damage d reputation.   
Clinicians will receive standardized training for SBIR T-PM, with their fidelity 
monitored by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Martino using a competency -based supervision approach. We will 
independently rate a random sample of about 10% of t he SBIRT -PM sessions (n = 220) 
for the counselors’ adherence and competence in deli vering the intervention using the 
Independent Tape Rater Scale.  The ITRS has two fact ors - fundamental and advan ced 
motivational interviewing strategies, as well as a cl inical consensus -based benchmark 
of adequate proficiency, namely, half of the 10 motivat ional interviewing consistent 
items being rated > [ADDRESS_542023]. Martino, he will review one session per 
week from that counselor and meet with the counselo r individually for more intensive 
supervision until the counselor’s proficiency reaches a dequate or better standards once 
again.  
 
11. PARTICIPANT  RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY   
Subject confidentiality is strictly held in trust by t he investigators, study staff, and the 
sponsor(s) and their agents.  This confidentiality is extended to cover test ing of 
biological samples in addition to study information  relating to subjects.   
The study protocol, documentation, data, and all oth er information generated will 
be held in strict confidence.  No information concer ning the study or the data will be 
released to any unauthorized third party without pri or written approval of the sponsor.  
The study monitor or other authorized representatives of the sponsor may 
inspect all study documents and records required to b e maintained by [CONTACT_093], 
including but not limited to, medical records (offic e, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) for the study 
subjec ts. The clinical study site will permit access to such r ecords.  
11.[ADDRESS_542024] (IRB) Review   
The VA Central IRB has approved the study applicatio n (containing a VA Central IRB 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  55 of 67  Version 1.1 
  27 April 2020  protocol, waivers, application forms, etc .). Any subsequent modifications will be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_428394].  
11.[ADDRESS_542025] the informed consent process with 
participants over the telephone. The Informed consen t process and the participant’s 
agreement to participate will be documented in an au dio file.  
Veterans will be provided with information about th e SBIRT -PM intervention, how 
long it will last, the nature of study assessments, inf ormation about the collection of 
biological specimens, the examination of their elec tronic health care and VA data, and 
potential risks and benefits of study participation. Vet erans will be reminded that they 
can withdraw from the study at any time without penalt y. They will be given the 
opportunity to ask questions and then will be asked if  they agree to participate.  
Veterans who agree to participant will state so for the audio -recording. Audio -
recorded consents will be stored on VA Network comput ers behind the VHA firewall.  
 
VA Staff Participants  
 Voluntary informed consent will be obtained from all  VA staff interviewed for the 
study prior to participation. For the qualitative int erviews,  Research staff will describe 
the purpose of the interview prior to administering t hese assessments. Participating VA 
staff members will be encouraged to ask any questions a nd have the option to 
discontinue participation without prejudice. They will be approached by [CONTACT_428395].  After a brief reiteration of the study purpose, the  
interviewer will confirm consent to record the interview f or transcription and analysis 
purposes before proceeding.   A waiver of documentation of informed consent for VA  
staff participants has been obtained.  No documentation will be obtained.   
 For the survey, a survey invitation will be emailed to VA staff directly from 
REDCap. The invitation will explain the purpose of the survey and who will have access 
to the results.  
11.3 Participant Confidentiality   
Privacy and Confidentiality of Veteran Participant Data: 
Data Storage - All possible precautions will be taken to prevent a  breach of 
confidentiality.  
1. Minimizing PHI in study databases: Research data will  be identified by [CONTACT_428396], although enrollm ent records must also be 
kept and these records will include names. Our study  forms have been designed 
to avoid collecting identifiable information; no Pr otected Health Information (PHI) 
will be collected on study forms. We collect only pro tocol session dates. These 
dates are changed to ‘number of sessions completed’ w hen data sets are 
anonymized and released to other investigators.   
2. Data with PHI: Personal identifiers will be retained to obtain VA service use data 
from central VA databases. The personal identifiers w ill be used to identify 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  56 of 67  Version 1.1 
  27 April 2020  service use by [CONTACT_428397]. Study 
data will be stored and analyzed on VA secure network  computers and in the VA 
Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI). VIN CI is a Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA) He alth Services Research & Development (HSR&D) 
resource center that provides a secure, central anal ytic platform for performing 
research and supporting clinical operations activities . It is a partnership between 
the VA Office of Information Technology (OI&T)  and the Veterans Health 
Administration Office of Research and Development (VHA  ORD). VINCI includes 
a cluster of servers for securely hosting suites of dat abases integrated from 
select national VA data sources. VINCI servers for data , applications and vir tual 
sessions are physically located at the VA Austin Informa tion Technology Center 
(AITC), located in Austin, [LOCATION_007]. This secure enclav e with 105 high -performance 
servers and 1.5 petaby[CONTACT_92525] -speed data storage has multiple layers of 
security and disaster recovery to prevent data loss. T o ensure the protection of 
Veteran data, VINCI maintains compliance with the g uidelines set forth by 
[CONTACT_92526] (VHA) Handbook 1200.1 2, Use of Data and Data 
Repositories in VHA Research, and all other applicable  VA and VHA policies and 
regulations. In addition, VINCI has undergone all s ecurity certification activities in 
support of obtaining an Authorization to Operate (ATO ). Access to VINCI 
resources are approved in accordance with the require ments of National Data 
Systems (NDS), VHA Handbook 1200.12, Use of Data and Da ta Repositories in 
VHA Research, and all other applicable VA and VHA pol icies and regulations. All 
data transferred from VINCI is subject to audit for compliance. VA -credentialed 
resea rch staffs are granted access to study -specific data along with tools for 
analysis and reporting in the secure, virtual working  environment through a 
certified VHA network computer within the VA.  If not  working within a VA or VHA 
hosted office environment  containing VA network access, researchers may apply 
for and then access VINCI through an approved Virtual  Private Network (VPN) 
and Remote Desktop application. The remote computing  environment enables 
data analysis to be performed directly on VINCI server s, offering several  
advantages: uniform security standards for access; a com mon point of entry for 
all investigators who use the data; tools for analysi s and reporting; tighter and 
more consistent control of data quality; and the abil ity to standardize and  update 
terminology and format as technology and methodology  improve. After the 
needed service use information is extracted, the ident ifiers will be removed to 
create files with de -identified data for subsequent analyses. At the conc lusion of 
the study, al l files with identifiers will be destroyed. The files wi th identifiers will 
be stored on VA secure network computers. Data Securi ty will be insured by 
[CONTACT_428398] V A firewall. There is no 
public internet access. Another layer of protection fo r sensitive information is 
ascribed to the system by [CONTACT_428399]. Only authorized staff 
will have data access. Study managers have the capabil ity of granting access 
and read -write privileges to users. All sy stems undergo daily backup and 24 -hour 
security. 
3. Clinical enrollment records are kept separate from r esearch data. Participants’ 
names will appear only on the consent form, HIPAA au thorization form, and “key” 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations  [ADDRESS_542026]. Rosen.  
4. Presentation of Study Results: The research records w ill be used to prepare 
reports that do not allow for the identification of individual study participants.  
5. Communication by [CONTACT_157499]: All computers used b y research staff are 
password protected. All research staff and counselors r eceive annual Good 
Clinical Practice, Human Subjects Protection, HIPAA, a nd VHA privacy training 
through Yale and the VA. Our data collection and ma nagement procedures are 
fully compliant with HIPAA.  
 
Confidentiality of Digital Audio Recorded Counseling  Sessions - To assure the 
confidentiality and protection of participants with res pect to digital audio recording of 
SBIRT -PM sessions, the following steps will be taken:  
1. Participants will provide informed consent for digita l audio recording. Participants 
will be allowed to participate in the study and refu se the audio recording. 
Participants who do consent to audio recording will b e informed that they have 
the right to stop the audio recording at any time du ring the session.  
2. Digital audio recordings will be treated as confide ntial research records. They will 
be labeled with a unique study ID code and uploaded  to a secure network VA 
server, separate from other study data. The audio fil e name [CONTACT_428404].  
3. Access to audio recordings will be limited to members o f the investigative team 
including trained research raters who will rate the recordings according to the 
clinician adherence and competence rating system and on ly the research staff 
will have access to  the recordings. A separate file will link the audio recording file 
code to the participant’s unique identification code, the clinician’s name, and the 
date of the session.  
 
Privacy and Confidentiality of VA Staff Participant Data: 
VA staff will have the right to stop the audio reco rding at any time during the interviews. 
These recordings will be treated as confidential res earch records, labeled with unique 
study ID codes, and uploaded to a secure network VA s erver. Recorded interviews will 
be transcribed by [CONTACT_428400] (CTSP) in 
Salt Lake City, UT. THE CTSP ensur es VA privacy and security requirements are met 
by [CONTACT_428401]. Both audio rec ordings and transcriptions will be kept 
behind the VHA firewall. Access to survey data and reco rdings will be limited to 
members of the investigative team in  involved in managing, analyzing, and interpreting 
them.

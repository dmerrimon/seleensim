Urine Pregnancy Test  
Adverse Event Assessments  
Application site reactions such as d ryness, burning/stinging, erosion, 
edema, and pain  will be assessed  scored (as per Appendix I V) and 
recorded.  
Study Endpoints  Primary endpoint:  
 The proportion of subject s in each treatment group with treatment 
success (i.e., a grade of clear or almost cl ear; a score of 0 or 1, 
within  the treatment area) based on the Investigator’s Global 
Assessment of Disease Severity at the end of treatment ( Study Day 
15) 
 
Additional  endpoints:  
 Change in severity from baseline to week 2 (study Day 15) of four 
individual  signs and symptoms of AD (i.e., erythema, 
induration/papulation, lichenification and pruritus) are considered 
supportive information  
 Application site reactions will be compared between treatment 
groups.  
 
Safety Endpoints:  
Safety assessment through the in cidences and severity of all adverse 
events (AEs) reported during the study and summarized by [CONTACT_481925]:   Therapeutic equivalence of the test product to the reference product 
will be evaluated in the PP population. To establish b ioequivalence, 
if the 90% confidence interval (calculated using Yates’  continuity 
correction) of the test - reference difference between products for the 
primary endpoint (success proportion) is contained within [ -0.20, 
+0.20], then bioequivalence of the t est product to the reference 
Protocol Number: CD -14-[ADDRESS_618919] been demonstrated.  
 As a parameter for determining adequate study sensitivity, the test 
product and RLD will be compared to placebo with regard to the 
primary endpoint from baseline to week 2 ( Day 15) . Superiority of 
the test and reference products against the placebo will be tested at 
the 5% significance level (p < 0.05; using  Fisher’s exact test ) in the 
mITT population using last observation carried forward . 
 Supportive information will be pres ented describing the c hange in 
severity from baseline to week 2 (study Day 15) of four individual 
signs and symptoms of AD (i.e., erythema, induration/papulation, 
lichenification and pruritus) .  
 Adverse events that occurred subsequent to the first dose of study 
drug will be summarized. The number and the proportion of subject s 
who experienced AEs will be computed by [CONTACT_1570]. AEs 
will also be summarized by [CONTACT_481926] (mild, moderate, 
severe) and by [CONTACT_481927] (none, possib ly, pr obably) in 
a similar way.  
 Application site reactions will be compared via a descriptive analysis 
between treatment groups.

 1    INTRODUCTION  
 
STUDY DISEASE:  
Atopic dermatitis (AD) (eczema) is a skin disease affecting an estimated 35 million 
Americans, predominantly childre n.13 AD is a pruritic disease of unknown origin that starts 
in early infancy ; an adult -onset variant is recognized14; it is characterized by [CONTACT_99407], 
eczematous lesions, xerosis  (dry skin) and lichenification.  AD may be associated with 
other atopic (immun oglobulin E [Ig  E]–associated) diseases (e . g., acute allergic reaction to 
foods, asthma, urticaria, and allergic rhinitis).   AD is the first disease to present in a series 
of allergic diseases s uch as food allergy, asthma, and allergic rhinitis, provoking the 
“atopic march” theory, which suggests that early or severe AD and cutaneous sensitization 
to environmental allergens may lead to subsequent allergic disease at other epi[INVESTIGATOR_481882] (e.g., gastrointestinal or respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352]).14 This hypothesis is supported 
by [CONTACT_12783] -sectional and longitudinal studies.

Drug Interactions  
Potential interactions bet ween Pi[INVESTIGATOR_119033] , 1% and other drugs, including 
immunizations, have not been systematically evaluated. Due to low blood levels of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_481889], systemic drug interactions 
are not expected, but cann ot be ruled out. The concomitant administration of  known 
CYP3A family of inhibitors in patients with widespread and/or erythrodermic disease 
should be done with caution. Some examples of such drugs are erythromycin, itraconazole, 
ketoconazole, fluconazole,  calcium channel blockers and cimetidine.  
 
1.1 Study Rationale  
Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a common skin disorder that affects an estimated [ADDRESS_618931] often beginning in infancy and childhood. The introduction of topi[INVESTIGATOR_481890] a clear unmet medical  
need by [CONTACT_481929][INVESTIGATOR_481891], care -givers  
and physicians.  
 
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common and chronic inflammatory skin dis ease that affects a 
large part of the population. Although atopic dermatitis responds well to twice daily mid -
strength corticosteroids, it is not optimal to expose a patient to the long term use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_481892] s ide effects like skin atrophy, striae, tachyphylaxis, adrenal 
suppression, bacterial infections, and contact [CONTACT_31449] . Pi[INVESTIGATOR_119033] 1% is an 
alternative topi[INVESTIGATOR_481893].  
 
The purpose  of the study is to es tablish the bioequivalence of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_119033], 1% 
with that of Elidel® (pi[INVESTIGATOR_031] ) Cream 1%  in patient s with AD using clinical 
endpoints.  The double blind parallel group randomized placebo controlled study design 
was chosen as an appropriate study de sign based on the recommendations from draft 
guidance on bioequivalence study for Pi[INVESTIGATOR_119033], 1% and from prescribing 
information for Elidel® (pi[INVESTIGATOR_031] ) Cream  1%. 
 
This trial uses the dose that ha s proven efficacy and safety in various clinical  trials and 
approved strengths by [CONTACT_481930].   
 
As per FDA guidelines for Pi[INVESTIGATOR_031], a  placebo control arm is recommended to 
demonstrate that the test product and RLD are active and as a parameter to establish that 
the study is sufficiently sen sitive to detect differences between products.  
 
The study will commence after a written approval obtained from the IRB at respective 
sites. The study will be conducted as per the ICH -GCP (step 5) Guidelines and in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsin ki, (Fortaleza, Brazil, October, 2013) .

in patients t reated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_22726], including E lidel® Cream 1%.  
Participation in this study may  or may not benefit the subject s. The exp ected potential 
benefits of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_481894]. 
[ADDRESS_618933] drug , Pi[INVESTIGATOR_481875], 1% with that of reference listed drug, Elidel® (pi[INVESTIGATOR_031])  Cream 1%,  listed as 
RLD in the Orange Book (NDA No. N021302), in the treatment of mi ld to moderate AD, 
using the primary endpoint in the Per Protocol population , as detailed in FDA Draft 
Guidance on Pi[INVESTIGATOR_031] 1% Topi[INVESTIGATOR_481895] 2012.  
2.2 Additional Objectives  
 To establish superiority of each active treatment over the placebo usin g the primary 
endpoint in the modified intent to treat (mITT) population and Last Observation Carried 
Forward (LOCF)  
 To assess indiv idual signs and symptoms of Atopic Dermatitis  (i.e., erythema, 
induration /papulation, lichenification and pruritus ) in each treatment group  
 To compare the safety and tolerability between the test and reference drugs  
 
[ADDRESS_618934] versus the reference listed drug and vehicle 
control, each applied as a thin layer twice daily to the affected area(s) for 14 days (2 
weeks). The primary endpoint is the proportion of subject s with treatment success  (a grade 
of clear or almost clear; a score of 0 or 1, within the treatment area) based on the 
Investigator’s Global Assessment of Disease Severity at the end of treatment (study Day 
15).  
 
A placebo control arm (vehicle of test product) is used to demonst rate that the test product 
and RLD are active and as a parameter to establish that the study is sufficiently sensitive to 
detect differences between products.  
  
Protocol Number: CD -14-[ADDRESS_618935]  is up to 32 days. There is a screening period of up to 
14 days and a treatment period of 14  (± 3) days.   
 
A total of [ADDRESS_618936] s will be randomized into 
three groups in 1:1:[ADDRESS_618937] s of a total of 4 visits:  
 
1. V1-Screening Visit , if required  (-up to 14 days) .  If one is already using bland emollient 
(e.g Cetalphil® Lotion) continuously for 7 days, there is no need to be dispensed study 
bland emollient .  In such case, procedures of Visit 1 (V1) and  Visit 2 ( V2) can be 
combined in one visit, if de sired . 
2. V2-Baseline and Randomization Visit (Day 1)  
3. V3-Interim Visit  (Day 8 ± 3 days)  
4. V4-End of Therapy Visit (Day 15 ± 3 days)  
 
It is strongly preferred to have one evaluator for each of the visits per subjec t. A back up 
evaluator may be present at baseli ne in case the primary evaluator is unavailable at follow 
up.

height, and use of birth control (for females) will be recorded.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Medical History : Detailed medical history , including the start date of atopic dermatitis 
will be obtained.  (Subject/guardian may verbally report signs and symptoms of atopic 
dermatitis with an onset at least 3 months prior.)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital  Signs: Body temperature , blood pressure,  and pulse rate will be performed  and 
recorded .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Diagnosis : Subject s will undergo a clinical examination for the diagnosis of  AD using 
the Hanifin Rajka criteria as outlined in Appendix I .   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Signs and Symptoms:  Signs and Symptoms of Atopic Dermatitis will be scored per 
body region (Head and Neck; Trunk; Upper Limbs; Lower Limbs).  Signs and 
symptoms of AD (i.e., erythema, induration/papulation, and lichenification ) will be  
scored objectivel y and recorded using the scale mentioned in Appendix II . The 
average/typi[INVESTIGATOR_481896]/symptom of all lesions in the reported body region will 
be recorded.  
Signs and Symptoms will be scored by [CONTACT_1716][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a qualified person 
delega ted by [CONTACT_093]. It is strongly preferred to have one evaluator for each of 
the visits per subject. A back up evaluator may be present at baseline in case the 
primary evaluator is unavailable at follow up.  
The evaluator will score the sign and sym ptom per body region as it presents itself at 
the current visit, and not in comparison to any other visit.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Body Surface Area  (BSA) Assessment : An overall body surface area involved with 
atopic dermatitis  will be assessed . The palmar method (surface area o f the palm 
including fingers and thumb is considered roughly equal to 1% of body surface area ) is 
recommended for assessment . Subject s must have at least  5% BSA to be included in the 
study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Investigator’s  Global Assessment (IGA)  
At each visit , the investig ator will assess the overall status of the subjec t’s skin for AD 
using the IGA  as per the scale noted in Appendix III . The IGA is a static assessment of 
how the subject ’s overall skin is observed at the time of the current visit. Scores or 
severity from pr ior visits should not be considered. The IGA scores for each visit will 
be documented on the source and the Case Report Form.  Subject s must have a score  of 
mild to moderate AD on IGA in order to be enrolled in the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pruritus Assessment : Pruritus will be assessed by [CONTACT_481931]’s guardian regarding the intensity of overall itc hing/scratching/discomfort in the 
24 hours prior to the visit using the scale mentioned in Appendix II.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Local Application Site Reactions : Subjects will also be assessed at screening for 
evaluation of pre -treatment local application site reactions. At each study visit, the 
investigator will evaluate any application site reactions with separate severity scores for 
dryness, burning/stinging, erosion, edema, and pain. At each visit the reactions will be

Scale (LIS) for scoring of application site reactions.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Physical Examination : Subjects will undergo a general physical exam ination. A 
detailed dermatological examination is required. A full body dermatologic examination 
will assess if the subject ha s any dermatologic malignancies. If the subject does have a 
dermatologic malignancy , they should not be enrolled. The following sy stems should 
also be evaluated: head, ears, nose, throat, eyes, central nervous system, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Concomitant Medication : History  concomitant medications used will be obtained  for 
at least the past 30 days . The start and stop date of medication use will be collected  in 
addition to the reason for use.  See section 6.3.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Screening  Criteria :  
Subjects will be evaluated to confirm that they meet the following screening criteria.  
 Non-immunocompromised male  or female aged 8 years and older  
 Clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD), as defined by [CONTACT_481932]  
 Failed to respond adequately to other topi[INVESTIGATOR_481897], or for whom those

6 TREATMENT OF STUDY DRUG  
6.1 Randomization  
Randomization will be performed using SAS® package (SAS Institut e Inc., [LOCATION_003], Version 
9.2 or higher).  
Study kit numbers  will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment arms based  on a 
randomization code list.  The statistician will generate the r andomization code list ; a copy 
of this list w ill be shared with the  IP handling team.   
  6.2 Dosing and Administration Information  
Dosage of  the study drugs : Apply a thin layer of Cream to the affected skin twice daily . 
Rub in gently and completely.  Subject s will be advised to wash their hands before and 
after application  of drugs  (unless the hands are being treated)  and to avoid accidental 
exposure of drug with eyes, nose, mouth and other mucus membrane. The use of occlusive 
dressings or wrappi[INVESTIGATOR_481904].   
At any point  of time , if there are si gns or symp toms of intolerability or toxicity, the 
investigator , based on his /her medical discretion may delay further treatment with study 
medication, or terminate the subject s from further study participation. At the time of check 
out for visit [ADDRESS_618963] the site if any problem arises. The used and unused medication tubes will be 
collected at  the end of therapy  visit at Day 8 and Day 15 visits . 
6.3 Concomitant Medication   
Current medications and any medications taken in the 30 days prior to the start of the study  
(Screening/Baseline, Visit 1) will be recorded as prior/concomitant medic ations with the  
corresponding indication  and dose . Prescription and over -the-counter (OTC) medications , 
including NSAIDs will be recorded . All medications taken on a regular basis should be 
recorded prior to commencing the use of the test article . If conco mitant medication is 
required during the study,  subject s will be treated accordingly  and a decision to continue or 
discontinue the subject s will be made by [CONTACT_74169], based on the  pharmacology and 
pharmacokinetics of the study product and the concom itant medication. All prescription 
and over the counter medications and vaccinations will be recorded and reported.

affect the efficacy or safety evaluations of the study.   
o Ophthalmic corticosteroids are not excluded.  
 Systemic antihistamines ( Subjects on a stable and continued dose of systemic 
antihistamines may be enrolled and continued in the study at the investigator’s 
discretion when the investigator considers that such will not affect the efficacy or 
safety evaluations of the study.)  
 CYP3A inhibito r, e.g., erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, 
calcium channel blockers cimetidine, grapefruit or grapefruit juice  
 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_119029], other than assigned treatment (e.g., sun screen, new brand of

 Allowing the study treatment to come in contact [CONTACT_68572], nose, mouth, 
vagina, or rectum (mucous membra nes).  
 Probiotics  
 Vaccinations  
 
Subject s who require prohibited in terventions during the study will be withdrawn  from the 
study. The use of concomitant and prohibited  medications will be recorded on the 
concomitant medications section of the CRF.   
6.5 Blinding  and Unblinding  
Blinding:  
This study will be  conducted as a double-blind study. Subject s in three arms will receive 
either study medications or placebo from subject  kits (IMP Kit) which are identical 
and labeled in a manner to maintain the blind.  
Protocol Number: CD -14-[ADDRESS_618965] s entering the study will be randomized in ratio of 1:1:[ADDRESS_618966], labeling,  packing & distribution of the IMP’s.  
 
Rand omization schedule will be generated based on the randomization request details 
and study design outlined in the protocol using SAS by [CONTACT_30165] & will be used 
to assign subject s to treatment groups .  Randomization schedule will be shared with the 
unblinded team involved in labeling, packaging, distribution of investigational products  by [CONTACT_160295]. Unblinded personnel at packaging site will pack the IMP’s based on the 
randomization schedule. All the IMP’s will be identified with their respecti ve kit 
numbers.  
 
To maintain the blinding through packaging:  
a. Packing material should be similar in colour and size.  
b. Labelling and packaging shall be performed as per the instructions given in the 
batch packaging document.  
c. Uniformity shall be maintained dur ing assembly of  labels on units, placement of 
units in the carton & sealing of the subject  kits. 
 
IMP’s will be distributed to sites along with corresponding respective blinded labels 
containing the randomized treatment . 
 
Site personnel will pi[INVESTIGATOR_481909] . Site personnel will dispense to  the 
subject /guardian  specific IMP tube(s) and instruct the subject /guardian  on the IMP 
usage. Subject s/guardians  are advised to return th e used & unused IMP  tubes . 
 
Unblinding:  
In the case of an emergency, the investigator may learn the treatment arm the subject  
was randomized to by [CONTACT_481937] s 
records stored  at the investigator’s site. Except in the circumstances detailed in 
unblinding section (breaking the blind),  the code will not be broken. The CRO shall be 
contact[CONTACT_481938].  
 
Unblinding a subject ’s treatment is restricted to emergency situations and should only be 
done to facilitate the proper care of a subject . In -case of emergency, 
investigator/authorized personnel will contact [CONTACT_481939] s by 
[CONTACT_481940] -blinding Request Form. The investigator should always attempt to 
contact [CONTACT_7195]/designee  before breaking the b lind. 
 
 
Protocol Number: CD -14-[ADDRESS_618967] , or an AE/SAE that requires expedited 
reporting, shall a subject become un -blinded as to the treatment they are receiving. The un -
blinding provides the information about the identity of study drug provided to the subject  
as per the randomization list.  
 
If there is a medical emergency with a subject , the Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_17027] l take the necessary medical 
action to address the emergency first, and then send an unblinding form to the unblinded 
person at CRO. Unblinded person sends this form to the medical monitor/designee for 
approval. If the medical monitor or designee, after ca reful consideration of the 
circumstances, feels that there is a need to know which treatment group the subject  is in, 
he/she will approve the unblinding by [CONTACT_3368]. This signed /approved form will 
be sent to the site, upon which investigator can unblind the subject .  Based on the 
authorization from the unblinded authority of CRO,  the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_481910]. 
 
Should the unblinding happen, the same treatment kit should be withdrawn from the 
subject . The kit should be quarantined with proper status on site.  
An account of all broken or unbroken codes will be collected by [CONTACT_481941].  
 
Every attempt will be made to maintain the blinding throughout the study. In any case 
treatment code is broken ; the un -blinding procedure must be adequately documented in the 
subject ’s study file.  
 
Before breaking the blind of an individual subject ’s blinded treatment, the investigator 
should have dete rmined that the information is necessary, i.e., that it will alter the 
subject ’s immediate manage ment.  Every attempt will be made to maintain the blind 
throughout the study. 
If the treatment blind is broken, the investigator will record the reason and date, time  on 
the appropriate CRF. If the blind is broken because of an AE/SAE , an AE/SAE  form will 
be completed and informed to CRO.  Randomization data are kept strictly confidential, and 
are accessible only to authorized personnel, until unblinding of the trial after database lock.   
 
7 SAFETY ASSESSMENT  
Adverse event (or adverse experience, AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  
or clinical investigation subject  administered the test and reference product which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore b e 
any unfavourable  and unintended sign (including for example an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom  or disease temporally associated with the use of the test and reference 
Protocol Number: CD -14-[ADDRESS_618968]  
will be carefully monitored for the development of any adverse events. This information 
should be obtained in the form of non -leading questions (e.g., “How are you feeling?”) and 
from signs and symptoms detected during each examination, observati ons of the study 
personnel or spontaneous reports from the subject s. 
 
Subject s will be monitored for safety and tolerability during the study and until the 
completion of the study. Any AEs, including either observed or volunteered problems, 
complaints, sig ns or symptoms, occurring during the course of the study or designated 
follow -up periods, must be recorded on the subject ’s CRF. This would include AEs 
resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concomitant medications.  
 
Each AE will be evaluated f or duration, intensity, and relationship to (or association with) 
the study treatment (or other causes). Additionally, the actions taken (e.g., discontinuation 
of study medication, administration of treatment) and the resulting outcome of the AE 
should be indicated on the CRF.  
 
Any subject  who is withdrawn from the study due to an adverse event should be followed 
until the outcome of the event is determined, and the investigator will prepare a written 
summary of the event and document the available follow -up information in the study 
documents.  
7.1 Intensity of Adverse Events  
The intensity of the AEs will be graded according to the following criteria:  
a. Mild:  Events that are usually transient; require only minimal treatment or therapeutic 
intervention; do n ot generally interfere with usual daily activities.  
b. Moderate:  Events that are alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention; 
interfere with usual daily activities, causing discomfort but pose no significant or 
permanent risk or harm to t he subject . 
c. Severe:  Events that require intensive therapeutic intervention; interrupt usual daily 
activities, or significantly affect clinical status; pose a significant risk or harm to the 
subject  and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_481911].  
7.2 Causality Assessm ent  
Causality denotes the relation of the event to the study drug and is classified as follows by 
[CONTACT_093]:  
a. ‘Definitely Related’ when the AE is clearly related to the study drug or 
intervention and is defined as meeting all the following cond itions:  
Has a reasonable temporal relationship to the investigational agent(s) or research 
intervention; could not have been readily produced by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state or have 
been due to environmental or other intervention; disappears or decreases with reduction in 
investigational agent or cessation of intervention; recurs with re -exposure to the

 investigational agent(s) (in case of studies involving multiple administration of drug); no 
alternative cause is present; follows a known pattern of respon se to intervention  
 
b. ‘Probably Related’ when the AE is likely related to the investigational agent(s) or

90% confidence interval (Yates’ continuity -corrected) of the absolute difference between the test 
and reference composite success rates is within  a defined equivalence range [ -0.20, +0.20 ]). Assuming the 
conversion rate from mITT to PP will be about 90%, [ADDRESS_618978] 85% power to demonstrate superiority of active over placebo. Under  the 
above assumptions, the overall global study power to demonstrate bioequivalence and superiority is 
estimated to be  approximately  85%. To allow for about 5% of subject s who may drop out from the 
study or are otherwise non -evaluable, approximately [ADDRESS_618979] s will  be en rolled ([ADDRESS_618980] bo group).

         Page 41 of 75 
 
  
 
 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Modified Int ent-to-treat (mITT)  
The mITT population includes all randomized subject s who met all inclusion / 
exclusion criteria, applied at least one dose of assigned product and returned for 
at least one post -baseline evaluation visit.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Per Protocol (PP)  
The PP popu lation includes all randomized subject s who met all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, applied 75% to 125% of the assigned product for 
the specified duration of the study, did not miss the scheduled applications for 
more than 3 consecutive days, and completed t he evaluation within the 
designated visit window (+/ - 3 day) with no protocol violations that would affect 
the treatment evaluation. The subject ’s compliance will be verified by [CONTACT_481943], and the protocol violations that would affect the treatment 
evaluation.  
 
9.2.2 Statistical analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy Analysis  
Primary Efficacy Parameter:  
Equivalence Analysis  
The 90% confidence interval for the difference in success proportions between test and 
reference treatment must be contained within [ -0.20, +0. 20] in order to establish 
equivalence.  
The compound hypothesis to be tested is:  
H0:  PT - PR < -0.20 or PT - PR > 0.20   
Versus   
HA:  -0.20 ≤ PT - PR  ≤ 0.20  
where PT = success rate of test treatment and   PR = success rate of reference treatment.  
Let  
nT = sample size of test treatment group Tn  
cnT = number of successes in test treatment group Tn  
nR = sample size of reference treatment group Rn  
cnR = number of successes in reference treatment group Rn  
PT = cnT / nT , PR = cnR / nR,  
and se = (  PT (1 - PT ) / nT + PR (1 -  PR ) / nR ) ½.  
The 90% confidence interval for the difference in proportions between test and reference 
will be  calculated as follows, using Yates’ correction:  
L = ( PT - PR) – 1.645 se – (1/ nT  + 1/ nR ) / 2  
U = ( PT - PR) + 1.64 5 se + (1/ nT  + 1/ nR ) / 2  
Protocol Number: CD -14-[ADDRESS_618982] H 0 if L <  -0.20 or  U > 0.20  
Rejection of the null hypothesis H 0 supports the conclusion of equivalence of the two 
products.  
 
Superiority of the treatment :  
Superiority of both treatments over the placebo will be evaluated for mITT population at 
week  2. Tests for superiority of each active treatment over the placebo will be conducted 
using two -sided Fisher exact test at the 5% level of significance.  
The efficacy analysis will be conducted  in mITT population and La st Observation 
Carried Forward  (LOCF) approach will be used to impute for missing data in the mITT 
population.  
 
Secondary Efficacy & Safety Parameters:  
The change in severity from baseline to week 2 (study Day 15) of four individual signs 
and symptoms of  AD (i.e., erythema, induration/papulation, lichenification and pruritus; 
see Table 2) will be evaluated as supportive information . 
The type of AE(s), number of AE(s) and proportion of subject s with AE(s)  
Safety assessment through the incidences of all adv erse events (AEs) reported during the 
study and summarized by [CONTACT_1570] . 
  
Main  Variables  Assessed for Safety  & Tolerability :  
AE(s) monitored using information volunteered by [CONTACT_481933] 
[INVESTIGATOR_481912](s) based on their causality, as 
well as severity and compared between the 3 study arms.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Analysis  
Subject s will be monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study (as explained 
above)  and until the  completion of the st udy.  
Adverse events will be tabulated for each and summary statistics will be  statistically  
evaluated  using Fisher’s exact test . 
9.3 Presentation of Results  
Summary statistics will be presented for actual values and changes from the baseline. If the 
values ar e raw measurements or derived totals from raw measurements, then the statistical 
measures; mean and median will be presented to single decimal place more than the 
maximum number of decimal places to which the raw measurements are collected. 
Minimum and max imum will be presented to the same number of decimal places as the 
maximum of decimal places to which the raw measurements are collected.  
Protocol Number: CD -14-[ADDRESS_618983] deviation (SD) will be presented two decimal places more than the raw data. If 
the values are derived values then an extra decimal place will be added to all these 
measures. Percentages will always be presented in two decimal place. Zero counts will be 
reported as '0' with '0.0%' percentages and 100 percentages  will be presented as 100.00% 
counts will be presente d as integer values.  
Confidence intervals and percentiles will be presented with two decimal place. All p -
values will be reported to four decimal points and p -values less than 0.0001 will be 
reported as <0.0001.  
 
Interim Evaluation:  
No interim evaluation is planned for this study.

physician should advise the patient about other types of protection from the sun.  It is not 
known how the study cream may affect your skin with exposur e to ultraviolet light.  
 A patient should not cover the affected skin with bandages, dressings or wraps. A patient 
can wear normal clothing.  
 The study cream  is for topi[INVESTIGATOR_481919]. Do not get the study cream  in your 
eyes, nose, mouth, vagina, o r rectum (mucous membranes). If you get the study cream  in

directed by [CONTACT_099]. Use the smallest amount of cream needed.  
 A patient should not bathe, shower or swim for at least 3 hours  after applying the study 
cream. This could wash off the cream.   In addition, please avoid prolonged bathing (i.e.

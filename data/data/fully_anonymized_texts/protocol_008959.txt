 LUCINACTANT FOR INHA LATION PROTOCOL SUMM ARY  
Protocol Number  03-CL-1202  
Title:  A Multinational , Multicenter, Masked, Randomized, Controlled Study to 
Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Lucinactant for Inhalation in Preterm 
Neonates 26 to 32 Weeks Gestational Age with Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1395]:  2b 
US IND Number:  119438  
Sponsor:  Discovery Laboratories, Inc. (Discovery), Warrington, PA, [LOCATION_003]  
Committees:  Steering Committee, Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)  
Study Drug and 
Device:  Lucinactant for inhalation (an investigational, drug -device combination 
product) at 30 mg total phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (TPL) /mL by [CONTACT_1526]® 
Delivery System (ADS) utilizing a capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396] -based aerosol generator 
(CAG).  
Active 
Ingredients:  A 21 -amino acid hydrophobic synthetic peptide (sinapultide,  KL 4 peptide), 
combined with the phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_1397] (DPPC), 
palmitoyloleoyl -phosphatidylglycerol, sodium salt (POPG, Na), and the 
fatty acid palmitic acid (PA).  
Rationale:  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1398] (RDS) is a disease that 
results from insuffic iency of pulmonary surfactant in the immature neonatal 
lung, which occurs with high frequency in preterm infants and caries high 
morbidity and mortality, especially in very preterm infants. Exogenous 
surfactant replacement therapy (SRT) reduce s mortality and morbidity in 
preterm infants  with RDS  and is recommended  by [CONTACT_1527] . Currently, SRT requires endotracheal intubation to instill  
surfactant  directly into the neonate’s lung , often with concomitant  positive 
pressure m echanical ventilation (MV). However, both intubation and MV 
may have deleterious effects to the infant, potentially leading to short - or 
Lucinactant for Inhalation  - CONFIDENTIAL  - Discovery Laboratories, Inc.  
Protocol  No.: 03-CL-[ADDRESS_1187] pressure (nCPAP) has become a widely 
accepted practice. SRT, however, cannot be delivered with nCPAP. 
Although sometimes successful, nCPAP will fail in approximately  one-third 
to one -half of preterm neonates , who generally then requir e endotracheal 
intubation, MV, and in many cases delayed administration of SRT. Earlier 
SRT is more effective than later  SRT; thus, the inability to administer SRT 
in conjunction  with nCPAP may result in suboptimal timing for SRT to 
treat RDS.  
Therefore , an unmet medical need exists for a means to deliver SRT to 
preterm neonates with RDS supported with nCPAP early in the course of 
the disease. This strategy has the potential to improve RDS prior to the 
development of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], thereby [CONTACT_1528]. The ability to administer SRT via aerosol has the 
potential to address this unmet need.  
To address this unmet need, Discovery Laboratories, Inc. (Discovery) has 
developed lucinactant for inhalation , an investigational drug -device 
combination product, to deliver aerosolized SRT to preterm neonates with 
RDS who are being supported with nCPAP. The  drug component of 
lucinactant for inhalation is lyophilized lucinactant, a lyophilized form of 
Surfaxin® (lucinactant) Intratracheal Suspension, an exogenous SRT 
approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (NDA 021746). The 
device component, the Aerosurf® Delivery System ( ADS ), uses novel 
technology to aerosolize lucinactant for inhalation.  
Lucinactant for inhalation was studied in  preterm neonates 29 to 34  weeks 
PMA in an open -label safety study ( Protocol  03-CL-1201 ) at escalating 
dosages of 25, 50, 75 , 100 and 150  mg total phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (TPL)/kg . In 80 
neonates (8 in each of the 5 active  groups and 40 in the control group), 
lucinactant for inhalation was generally well tolerated and there were  
generally no safety signals of  concern with e scalating doses.  Complications 
of prematurity, including pulmonary air leak, were comparable between 
treatment and control groups. Exploratory assessment of clinical efficacy 
parameters suggests that lucinactant for inhalation may be providing 
beneficial e ffects.

 A similar dose escalation study in preterm  infants 26 to 28 weeks PMA has 
been initiated (Protocol  03-CL-1401)  and is ongoing,  using  escalating 
dosages of, 50, 75 , 100 and 150  mg total phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (TPL)/kg . In 45 
neonates to date ([ADDRESS_1188]/kg groups, [ADDRESS_1189]/kg group and 23 in the control group), l ucinactant for inhalation 
has been  generally well tolerated and there have been  generally no safety 
signals of  concern with escalating doses. Complications of prematuri ty, 
including pulmonary air leak, have so far been comparable between 
treatment and control groups. Exploratory assessment of clinical efficacy 
parameters to date suggests that it is likely that lucinactant for inhalation at 
a dosage greater than 100 mg TP L/kg (repeated more than 1 time) may be 
required in this population to provide  beneficial effects.  
Going forward, Discovery has decided to develop and evaluate dosages of 
[ADDRESS_1190]/kg. Results from preclinical and clinical trials, including 
Study 03 -CL-1201  and Study 03 -CL-1401 , support the safety and potential 
efficacy of initial and repeat administration with these dosages.  
Objective s: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of lucinactant for inhalation  in 
conjunction with nCPAP , in comparison to nCPAP alone, in preterm 
neonates with RDS, as assessed by [CONTACT_1529][INVESTIGATOR_1400]/or death due to RDS  in the first 72 hours of life , the incidence of 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)  at 36 weeks PMA , and change in 
physiologic parameters (fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] [FiO 2] and partial 
pressure of carbon dioxide [PCO 2]) over the first 72 hours of life.  
Primary Endpoint:  The primary endpoint for this study is the incidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1402] [ADDRESS_1191] will be 
categorized as having respi[INVESTIGATOR_1403]:  
1. Intubation for MV an d/or surfactant administration (with or without 
MV) within [ADDRESS_1192] 1 of the following criteria , regardless of 
whether endotracheal intubation is performed : 
a. A sustained (≥ 60 minutes) need for FiO 2 > 0.45 to maintain an S pO2 
> 90% to 95%

Study Design:  This study is a sequential, 2 -part, multinational, multicenter, masked  
(Part  A)/open -label (Part B) , randomized, controlled study to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of lucinactant for inhalation  in conjunction with nCPAP 
compared with nCPAP alone, in preterm neonates 28 to 32  completed 
weeks PMA (Part A) and in preterm neonates 26 to 28 completed weeks  
PMA (Part B) who are being cared for in a neonatal intensive care unit 
(NICU), who had successful implementation of non-invasive respi[INVESTIGATOR_1406] 90 minutes of birth  (60 minutes for Part B) , 
and who are candidates for SRT.  The pre ferred i nitial m ode of support is 
study nCPAP; however, other modes are acceptable if the investigator feels 
it is safe to switch the subject to study nCPAP following consent and 
screening. There will be 2 phases in  Parts A and B of  the study, a primary 
phase through 36 weeks PMA and a longer -term follow -up phase through 1 -

 year corrected age.  Data will be analyzed and reported at the completion of 
each respective  study phase  for Parts A and B of the study . 
Before study enrollment, legal guardians will provi de a signed written 
informed consent form (ICF) for each potential subject. Qualification for 
study enrollment will be established after confirmation that the subject has 
met all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. The 
clinical cr iteria for enrollment may be met prior to informed consent being 
obtained; however, no study -specific procedures that are not part of the 
usual standard care of the subject at the institution may be performed until 
the informed consent has been provided by  a legally authorized 
representative of the subject.  
For Part A of the study, i nclusion criteria to be met within the first 20  hours 
after birth include respi[INVESTIGATOR_1407] a requirement for nCPAP 
of 5 to 7 cm H2O with a FiO 2 ≥0.25 (>0.21 for neonates 28 weeks PMA) to 
0.4 to maintain oxygen saturation measured by [CONTACT_406] (SpO 2) 
of 90% to 95% for at least [ADDRESS_1194] 12 hours after birth include respi[INVESTIGATOR_1408] a requirement for nCPAP of 5  to 7 cm H2O with a FiO 2 
>0.21 to 0.4 to maintain SpO 2 of 90% to 95% for at least 20 minutes . As 
soon as study qualification  has been confirmed and the informed consent is 
signed, subjects will be randomized t o an active treatment group (2 active 
groups in Part A; 1 active group in Part B) or to the control group (nCPAP 
only, with simulated [“sham”] study drug treatment  in Part A ). Study 
treatment  (lucinactant for inhalation or sham/ control) must be initiated a s 
soon as possible and no more than 2 hours after randomization . 
Subjects in Part A may be eligible to receive up to 2 repeat doses  of the 
treatment to which they are originally assigned , and subjects in Part B may 
receive up to 4 repeat doses . Repeat doses will be given  for subjects in Part 
A as soon as 2 hours , and for subjects in Part B as soon as 30 minutes,  from 
completion of the previous dose up to 36  hours after completion of 
randomization if subjects meet repeat dosing criteria (as desc ribed in the 
“Treatment Groups” section ) unless it is unsafe to do so in the judgment of 
the investigator . Subjects randomized to the control group will be continued 
on nCPAP alone ; subjects in Part A  will receive repeated sham treatment to 
maintain study masking , while subjects in Part B will receive open label 
treatment . 
In both parts of the study, all  subjects in the active treatment groups will

 receive the same drug concentration of lucinactant for inhalation ([ADDRESS_1195]/mL) at the same rate of delivery  (aerosolized concentration of 4.[ADDRESS_1196]/L in aerosol carrier gas flow of 3 L/min) . The dos age will vary by [CONTACT_1530] ([ADDRESS_1197]/kg arm  in Part A , [ADDRESS_1198]/kg arm  in Parts A  
and B ). Lucinactant for inhalation will be delivered  by [CONTACT_1531] a commercially available nCPAP generator 
and patient interface. Dose assignments in Part A will be masked from  the 
principal investigator (PI) , clinical and study staff (eg, site coordinator , 
bedside nurse ), as applicable; sponsor  as applicable ; and subject’s 
parents/legal guardians. Dose assignments in Part B will be open label.  
All enrolled subjects will receive study treatment in a NICU : a speciali zed 
care center staffed by [CONTACT_1532], nurses, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1409]. Neonates in the NICU are continuously monitored using 
advanced and sophisticated monitori ng equipment, and there is ready and 
immediate access to equipment, medications, and skilled personnel that may 
be needed to address emergent developments. Interventions such as 
endotracheal intubation, MV, and surfactant administration will be readily 
available to all study subjects if clinically indicated in accordance with the 
high-level standard -of-care customary in the NICU.  
In both parts of the study, n eonates will be followed for the primary phase 
efficacy and safety evaluations through 36  weeks PMA, NICU discharge, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1410], or death (whichever occurs first ). For the longer -term 
follow -up phase, neonates will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1533] 6-months 
corrected age and followed up to 1 -year corrected age, at which time a 
physical examination will be performed, including an abbreviated 
neurologic assessment.  
Study Population:  The study population will be comprised of preterm neonates 26 to 
32 completed weeks PMA who are re ceiving care in a NICU and are 
receiving nCPAP as the primary support modality for RDS. Enrollment will 
be conducted by [CONTACT_1534]: in Part A, approximately 5 -10% of the subjects will 
be 28  completed weeks PMA and the remainder will be 29 to 32 completed 
weeks  PMA , while in Part B randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_1535] (26 , 27, and  28 completed weeks PMA) .

 The study population in Part A will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 1 of 
3 treatment groups , and in Part B will be randomized in a 1:1 rat io into 1 of 
2 treatment groups  (see “Treatment Groups” section).  
Study Sample 
Size:  A total of up to  240 study subjects ( up to 80 per treatment group) will be 
enrolled  in Part A, and up to 80 subjects (up to 40 per treatment group) will 
be enrolled in Pa rt B. For Part A, the  sample sizes were calculated 
separately for incidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1411], time to 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1405] , and a reduction in FiO 2. The sample 
size will have 90% power to detect the difference betwe en treatment groups 
using a log -rank test for equality of time to event curves, assuming a 
constant hazard ratio of 0.500, within the first [ADDRESS_1199] , separately,  a reduction of 50% in the 
incidence  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1412] 
72 hours of life, or a reduction in FiO 2 of 4 percentage points (eg,  30% to 
26%) within the first [ADDRESS_1200] (treatment delta). The efficacy estimate 
will be used to calculate the sample size for future studies.  
For Part B, formal sample size calculations have  not been conducted . A 
total of [ADDRESS_1201].  
Number of Sites:  Approximately 60  study sites in North America , Europe , and South 
America . 
Study Duration:  Overall, study enrollment  will be completed in approximately [ADDRESS_1202] participation will be from [ADDRESS_1203] 
for the primary evaluation phase of the study. Follow -up through 1 -year 
corrected age will be done  for the secondary phase of the study .

 Method of 
Administration:  Subjects randomized  to the active treatment groups will be administered an 
investigational drug -device combination product, lucinactant for inhalation, 
in conjunction with nCPAP. Reconstituted lyophilized lucinactant 
(reconstituted with sterile water for injection) will be a erosolized by [CONTACT_1536]. Those 
randomized to the control (nCPAP only) group will continue to receive 
nCPAP alone ; in order to maintain masking  in Part A , “sham” study drug 
treatment will be used: the ADS will be brought to the bedside but will not 
be used, and no active study drug will be administered . 
The theoretical inhaled dose (in mg TPL/kg) can be controlled based on the 
duration of exposure to the aerosol. This inhaled dose is a functio n of the 
concentration of lucinactant in the aerosol, the amount of aerosol inhaled by 
[CONTACT_423] (estimated by [CONTACT_423]’s minute ventilation, assuming that all 
gas inhaled by [CONTACT_1537]), and 
the duration of  exposure to the aerosol. Because of losses that occur as the 
lucinactant aerosol travels from the ADS to the patient interface, 
approximately 35% of the reconstituted lucinactant aerosolized by [CONTACT_1538].  
Treatment 
Groups:  Part A:  
40 mg/kg  [ADDRESS_1204]/kg administered over 25 minutes in 
conjunction with nCPAP (n=80)  
 Up to [ADDRESS_1205]/kg administered 
over 25  minutes will be given  if repeat dosing criteria 
are met.  
80 mg/kg  [ADDRESS_1206]/kg administered over 50 minutes in 
conjunction with nCPAP (n=80)  
 Up to [ADDRESS_1207]/kg administered 
over 50  minutes will be given  if repeat dosing criteria 
are met.  
 
Control  Continu ous nCPAP (n  = 80) with sham drug treatment  
 Up to 2 repeat sham treatments  will be given  if repeat 
dosing criteria are met.

above the qualifying FiO 2 for study enrollment  (≥0.25 for neonates 29 -32 
weeks PMA, >0.21 for neonates 26 -28 weeks PMA ) to maintain SpO 2 of 
90% to 95% , unless it is unsafe to do so in the judgment of the investigator . 
In Part A, m asking procedures for the initial dose will be followed for 
repeat doses , including controls .

Statistic al 
Analysis  The statistical analysis of both the primary and secondary objectives will be 
based on all enrolled preterm neonates. For the efficacy analysis, 
populations of all randomized subjects who received any treatment (intent -
to-treat [ITT]) and subje cts with no major protocol deviations (per -protocol) 
will be evaluated, based upon the treatment group to which they were 
randomized. For the safety analysis, all subjects randomized to the control 
group or who received any lucinactant for inhalation (including partial 
doses) will be evaluated, based upon the treatment they actually received.  
All analyses will be performed for Parts A and B of the study for all 
subjects combined and by [CONTACT_1539].  
The treatment difference (delta) between active and control treatments will 
be calculated for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. The 
delta calculated will be used to plan additional studies and as supporting 
evidence of efficacy.

Protocol  No.: 03-CL-[ADDRESS_1226] pressure (nCPAP), in comparison with nCPAP 
alone, in preterm neonates 26  to 32 completed weeks ’ postmenstrual age (PMA) with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1421] (RDS)  of the newborn . 
Aerosolized  surfactant delivery potentially addresses an unmet medical need by [CONTACT_1541] a 
means to deliver surfactant to preterm neonates with RDS  who are  treated non-invasively with 
nCPAP, thereby [CONTACT_1542] (SRT) early in the disease course 
while avoiding the complications associated with endotracheal intubation and mechanical 
ventilation inherent in conventional surfactant delivery.  
This clinical study is intended for preterm neonates 26 to 32 completed weeks PMA and is 
designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a novel SRT, lucinactant for inhalation, 
administered at doses of 40 or 80  mg total phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (TPL)/kg.  A preceding dose-escalation  
safety study, Protocol  03-CL-1201, was conducted in preterm neonate s [ADDRESS_1227]/kg.  A similar  dose-escalation safety 
study in preterm infants 26 to 28 weeks PMA has been  initiated (Protocol  03-CL-1401). To date, 
there have been no safety signals of  concern. Findings from these 3  studies (03 -CL-1201, 03 -CL-
1401, and 03 -CL-1202) will contribute to the development and design of future investigations of 
this novel drug/device  combination product.  
All study procedures and assessments are to be conducted in accordance with local and regional 
regulatory requirements, institutional review board (IRB)/independent ethics committee 
(IEC)/research ethics board (REB) requirements, Int ernational Conference on Harmonisation 
Good Clinical Practices (ICH GCP) Guidelines, and local institutional practices.  
Definitions of study terms are provided in Appendix 1 . 
1.1 Treatment of Neonatal Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1422] a disease that results from insufficiency of pulmonary surfactant in the 
immature neonatal lung, which occurs with high frequency in preterm infants and caries high 
morbidity and mortality, especially in very preterm infants . Exogenous s urfactant treatment 
reduce s mortal ity and morbidity in preterm infants  with RDS  (1, 2). Intratracheal  SRT has well -
Lucinactant for Inhalation  - CONFIDENTIAL  - Discovery Laboratories, Inc.  
Protocol  No.: 03-CL-[ADDRESS_1228], recommended therapy for 
this condition  (3-6). Early SRT is more effective i n reducing morbidity and mortality due to RDS 
than SRT delivered later  (2), and multiple doses are sometimes necessary  (1).  
Intratracheal  instillation of surfactant into the lung requires endotracheal intubation, often with 
concomitant positive pressure mechanical ventilation (MV). However, endotracheal intubation is 
an invasive , painful  procedure that  itself  has potential deleterious effects  to the infant, including 
hypoxemia, bradycardia, hypertension, increases in intracranial pressure and cerebral blood flow 
which may increase the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH)  (7, 8), and tracheal injury 
which may lead to the developm ent of subglottic stenosis  (9). Further, MV is associated with 
morbidities such as ventilator -associated lung injury and volutrauma/barotrauma resulting in air 
leak syndromes such as pneumothorax and/or pulmonary interstiti al emphysema (PIE), and may 
also contribute to development of chronic lung disease (CLD) / bronchopulmonary dysplasia 
(BPD)  (10). 
1.1.[ADDRESS_1229] pressure (nCPAP) as an effective 
means of providing ventilatory support is now accepted practice  (3-6, 11). nCPAP improves 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1423] , improving lung 
compliance  and dilat ing upper airway structures, thereby [CONTACT_1543]  (11, 12).  
Devices that generate and deliver nCPAP , as well a s patient interfaces such as nasal prongs , have 
been  specifically designed, manufactured, and made commercially available for use in neonates. 
Devices to generate nCPAP include those with continuous humidified flow (eg, bubble CPAP, 
VapoTherm, SiPAP) and m ore complex devices with variable flow (eg, a mechanical ventilator 
set to CPAP mode). Because neonates are obligate nose breathers, s everal patient interface 
devices exist that can be used to deliver CPAP via the nose  such as nasal masks, short bi -nasal 
prongs, and nasopharyngeal tubes.  
Studies in very preterm neonates of initial treatment of RDS with nCPAP alone  (13-16), 
including meta -analys es (17, 18), have shown outcomes with this approach  that are similar to 
traditional, early treatment with intratracheal surfactant . These studies have consistently show n 
that in neonates treated with  nCPAP, the need for surfactant therapy is less than that of neonates 
treated with  intubation  and SRT , and that the important outcome of death or bronchopulmonary

Page 25 of 124 
 dysplasia ( BPD, defined as the need for oxygen [O2] treatment at day  28 after birth ) is equal or  
less frequent  with nCPAP . In neonates treated with nCPAP, approximately 33 -67% of patients 
required intubation and intratracheal surfactant replacement, meaning that ⅓ to ⅔ of patients 
were able to avoid intubation altogether. Thus , the strategy of initially supporting neonates with 
nCPAP and reserving SRT only for those who require intubation appears to be reasonably 
effective and potentially safer by [CONTACT_1544].  Two meta -analyses  (10, 19) and a 
systematic review  (20) have suggested that use of nCPAP as the primary respi[INVESTIGATOR_1424], with a number 
need to treat (NNT) of 25 for BPD  (10). 
In neonates 24 -28 weeks’ gestation, the  rate of air leak ( pneumothorax , pneumomediastinum  or 
pulmonary interstitial emphysema) was generally low (3 to 9.6%), but in some reports was 
greater in the nCPAP group s compared to the intubation group s (12-14). Air leaks have been 
reported in as many as 21% of neonates in this gestational age range treated with a restrictive 
intubation strategy using nCPAP  (21). 
Older gestational age infants treated with nCPAP may be at higher risk of air leak than younger 
infants  (22). In a cohort of 297 neonates 25 -32 weeks gestation with RDS initially treated with 
nCPAP alone, 65 (22%) overall required intubation (“nCPAP failure”). The rate of nCPAP 
failure was 45% in the subgroup 25 -28 weeks ’ gestation, consistent with prior reports, where 
only 15% of infants 29 -32 week s’ gestation had nCPAP failure. Notably, the rate of 
pneumothorax prior to intubation was 10% in the younger cohort (also consistent with most prior 
reports), but was 23% in the older gestational age infants as a whole and 47% in those older 
infants wh o failed nCPAP.  
1.1.[ADDRESS_1230] demonstrated that earlier intratracheal SRT is more beneficial than later 
SRT (2). For this reason, guidelines recommend that when SRT is used it be given as ear ly as 
possible  (3-6). However, when nCPAP is used as initial respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], SRT is necessarily 
delayed in those neonates who ultimately require endotracheal intubation.  
Thus, a n unmet medical need exists for a means to deliver SRT to preterm neonates with RDS 
supported w ith nCPAP early in the course of the disease. This strategy has the potential to 
improve RDS prior to the development of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], thereby [CONTACT_1545]. The 
ability to administer SRT via aerosol has the potential to address this unmet need.  
Lucinactant for Inhalation  - CONFIDENTIAL  - Discovery Laboratories, Inc.  
Protocol  No.: 03-CL-[ADDRESS_1231] been largely unsuccessful to date  (23) 
because of the limited capability of currently available aerosol generators to aerosolize 
surfactants in the amount needed to achieve a therapeutic benefit. Delivery  of surfactant aerosol 
to the lungs has been limited by [CONTACT_1546]. Compared with surfactant administration via endotrach eal 
instillation,  surfactant  administration via aerosolization is highly inefficient and dose delivery is 
limited  (24). Newer aerosol g enerator technologies may allow for administration of aerosolized 
surfactant in sufficient quantities to achieve a therapeutic response. As with liquid surfactant, 
aerosolized surfactant is most likely delivered preferentially to the ventilated parts of th e lungs  
(25). It is therefore likely that  improving lung aeration by [CONTACT_1547] , as with nCPAP , would improve the delivery of aerosolized 
surfactant .  
1.2 Development of Aerosolized Surfactant with  Lucinactant for Inhalation  
To address this unmet need, Discovery Laboratories, Inc. (Discovery) has developed lucinactant 
for inhalation , an investigational drug -device combination product, to deliver aerosolized SRT to 
preterm neonates with RDS who are being supported with nCPAP. Lucinactant for inhalation is 
comprised of a drug component , lyophilized lucinactant, and a device component referred to as 
the AEROSURF® Delivery System (ADS). Lyophilized lucinactant is  a lyophilized form of 
Surfaxin® (lucinactant) Intratracheal Suspension, an exogenous SRT approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (NDA 021746). The ADS uses novel capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396] -based aerosol generator 
(CAG) technology to aerosolize lucinactant for in halation , providing  a high -density surfactant 
aerosol output ( 1.2 mL/min ), with an appropriate particle size (2  to 3 microns mass median 
aerodynamic diameter [MMAD])  for respi[INVESTIGATOR_1425] . The 
ADS may allow aerosolized luc inactant to be deposited in the lungs of preterm neonates in 
sufficient quantities to effect a therapeutic response analogous to that of endotracheal instillation 
of surfactant .  
Nonclinical studies using the CAG technology in preterm lambs have demonstrat ed that 
aerosolized lucinactant significant ly improve d lung mechanics and gas exchange compared with 
preterm lambs receiving CPAP alone  (26). In parallel , pi[INVESTIGATOR_1426] 
(Study KL4-CPAP -01) (27) as well as in adults with asthma and cystic fibrosis (Study KL4-
ASTH -01) have demonstrated that lucinactant aerosolized with commercially available 
nebulizers appears to be generally well -tolerated.  The ADS represents the clinical version of the 
Lucinactant for Inhalation  - CONFIDENTIAL  - Discovery Laboratories, Inc.  
Protocol  No.: 03-CL-[ADDRESS_1232], commercially available nebulizers ( Studies KL4-CPAP -01 (27) and 
KL4-ASTH -01). Aerosolized lucinactant administered with the ADS has been investigated in 
one completed Discovery -sponsored clinical  trial (Study 03 -CL-1201) and one ongoing 
Discovery -sponsored clinical trial (Study 03 -CL-1401). These studies are described below, and 
in further detail in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.3.1 Preliminary Studies Using Commercially Available Nebulizers  
Study KL4 -CPAP -01 (27) was a Phase 2, multicenter pi[INVESTIGATOR_1427] y in preterm neonates 
investigating the feasibility of delivering aerosolized lucinactant to preterm neonates at risk for 
RDS administered using  the Aeroneb® Pro Nebulizer System in conjunction with nCPAP, which 
delivered a lucinactant output of approximat ely 4 μL/second . The majority (12, 70%) of the [ADDRESS_1233] of aerosolized lucinactant in a volume of 43 mL over the 3 -hour treatment. No device -
related serious ad verse events (SAEs) occurred . Adverse events during dosing (p eridosing  
events ) included oxygen desaturation  (53% of patients),  pallor  (6%) , nasal irritation  (6%) , skin 
irritation  (6%) , and apnea (29%); many of these are commonly observed in premature infants on 
nCPAP . Five subjects (30%) required subsequent endotracheal surfactant replacement, which is 
somewhat better than the rate reported in the literature  (13, 14). The study demonstrated that it is 
feasible to deliver aerosolized lucinactant in conjunction with nCPAP and that the treatment was 
generally well -tolerated by [CONTACT_1548].  
Study KL4 -ASTH -01 was a Phase 1b study that assessed the safety and tolerability of 
aerosolized lucinactant in a placebo -controlled study of adults with mild persistent asthma. Six 
healthy adult volunteers and 9 adults with mild persistent asthma w ere administered aerosolized 
lucinactant by [CONTACT_1549]® Pro Nebulizer System. In this study, ≤ 24.[ADDRESS_1234] was 
administered at approximately 1 mg/minute. The treatment was well -tolerated with no serious 
adverse events (SAEs). Pulmonary function and clinical signs and symptoms of asthma generally 
remained uncha nged from baseline and were similar in both treatment groups.

 The study demonstrated it is feasible to deliver aerosolized lucinactant to adults and that the 
treatment was generally well -tolerated.  
1.3.2 Clinical Studies using the AEROSURF Delivery System  
Lucin actant aerosolized using the ADS has been studied in a completed Phase 2a study in infants 
29 to 34 weeks PMA (Study 03-CL-1201) . Results of this study are summarized  in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] , and results apropos to the selection of dosages in Part A of this study are summarized in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] . In addition, another study ( Study 03-CL-1401) has been initiated  to evaluate the 
safety and tolerability of lucinactant for inhalation in younger preterm infants 26 -28 completed 
weeks PMA.  Preliminary r esults of this study are summarized in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , and results 
apropos to the selection of dosages in Part B of this study are summarized in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . The 
current protocol (03 -CL-1202) is designed to evaluate the size of the treatment effect for 
planning future studies.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study 03 -CL-1201  
Study 03 -CL-1201 was a Phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, open -label, controlled dose -
escalation study assessing the safety and tolerability of aerosolized lucinactant delivered using 
the ADS in preterm infants 29 to 34 completed weeks PMA. This study was conducted at 12 
study  sites in the US and evaluated the safety of 5 dose-exposures of aerosolized lucinactant in 
conjunction with nCPAP : [ADDRESS_1235]/kg , [ADDRESS_1236]/kg , [ADDRESS_1237]/kg , [ADDRESS_1238]/kg and 
[ADDRESS_1239]/kg . Repeat doses were possible for the larger [ADDRESS_1240] did not meet inclusion criteria but was enrolled in error; since 
this subject was randomized to the [ADDRESS_1241]/kg group and briefly received study treatment, 
this subject was included in the safety analysis but not in the explor atory efficacy analyses. All 
active subjects received at least one treatment; [ADDRESS_1242]/kg group and [ADDRESS_1243]/kg group received 2 treatments. Study drug treatment (initial or repeat) was 
discontinued early in 10 (25%) subjects:  6 (15%) due to “device failure or malfunction ”; 2 (5%) 
due to signs of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1428]  (including the subject enrolled in error) ; and 2 
(5%) due the principal investigator’s medical judgment.  “Device failure or malfunction ” was 
selected when the ADS terminated aerosol treatment early; however, these early stoppages were 
due to an error code being detected, such as an aerosol temperature outside of the preset

 acceptable range. Thus, the device functioned as designed, but the full treatment was not 
delivered.  
The i ncidence of adverse events (AEs) was comparable between treatment and control groups, 
occurring in 39 (98%) active subject s and 37 (93%) controls. The i ncidence of AEs did not 
increase with dosage. The [ADDRESS_1244] common A Es were neonatal jaundice, constipation and 
neonatal apnea. Complications of prematurity were comparable between treatment and control 
groups; the [ADDRESS_1245] common were apnea (occurring in 23 [58%] active and 23 [58%] control 
subjects), air leak (9 [23%] acti ve and 7 [18%] controls, discussed further below), and patent 
ductus arteriosus (5 [13%] active and 3 [8%] control subjects). Peri-dosing events were 
uncommon, occurring in 7 (18%) active subjects with no increase in incidence as dosage 
increased. The [ADDRESS_1246] common peri -dosing events were transient desaturation in 5 (13%) 
subjects, nasal irritation in 2 (5%) subjects, and vomiting in 2 (5%) subjects. SAEs occurred in 
13 (33%)  of active subject s, with no increase in incidence as dosage increased, and 7 (18%)  of 
control subject s. Pneumothorax (a specific form of air leak , discussed further below ) was the 
most commonly reported SAE, reported in 9 (23%) active subject s and 4 (10%) controls.  Two 
subjects died: one subject in the [ADDRESS_1247]/kg group experienced se vere cardiopulmonary 
deterioration of unknown cause (suspected sepsis) [ADDRESS_1248] died of acute pulmonary hemorrhage related to RDS and treatment with poractant alfa 
(Curosurf) 2 days after randomization into the study; neither death was considered to be related 
to study treatment  or procedures . 
When all forms of pulmonary air leak, including pneumothorax , pneumomediastinum  and PIE 
(see Section 9), are considered together, the incidence in active and control groups was similar  
(Table 1-1). Overall, 9 (23%) active subjects experienced air leak, all of whom had 
pneumothorax with 2 (5%) experiencing PIE and 1 (3%) experiencing pneumomediastinum as 
well. The incidence across dosage groups was similar. In the control group, 7 (18%) were 
reporte d by [CONTACT_1550], 5 (13%) of whom had pneumothorax and 2 (5%) 
experiencing PIE.  
An independent review of all radiographs of all subjects confirmed the [ADDRESS_1249] s, but identified an additional 2 air leak s (both PIE) in [ADDRESS_1250] s. Thus, the 
independent review noted a total air leak incidence of 9 (23%) among  both active and control

Lucinactant for inhalation had no clinically important effect on serum electrolytes, gastric liquid 
volume, or defecation. Mean concentration of serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, 
total carbon dioxide) was within normal range in active patien ts at 24 hours of life. AEs related 
to electrolyte disturbances were infrequent (≤13%) and similar between active and control 
subjects. Gastric liquid volume (residual ) checked after dosing was physiologically normal for 
all active subjects , ranging from 0 .00 to 8 .00 mL ; mean volume tended to increase with dosage 
(0.25±0.[ADDRESS_1256]/kg group, 2.00±1.[ADDRESS_1257]/kg group) . Although 
constipation was reported an AE somewhat more frequently in active subjects (50%) vs controls 
(35%), a ctive  subjects had a physiologically normal number of stools (1.9) in the first 24 hours 
of life  which was  similar to the number in control subjects (1.7).   
Study 03 -CL-1201 was neither designed nor powered to investigate efficacy. However, clinical 
parameters associated with efficacy (and safety) were measured. P reliminary results are 
described here for completeness and to inform dosage selection for the present study (see Section 
2.2.3 ). Overall, active subjects had a more rapid decrease in FiO 2 than control  subjects  (Figure 
1-1): 1 hour  after starting dosing , 11 (28%) active subjects were breathing room air (FiO 2 0.21) 
vs 3 (8%) control subjects.  Decreases in FiO [ADDRESS_1258] as expected  (Figure 1-1), since most 
subjects were on relatively small amounts of supplemental oxygen (median  FiO 2 0.28 in active 
subjects, 0.30 in controls). Decreases in PCO [ADDRESS_1259] and no t different between 
actives and controls.

Protocol  No.: 03-CL-[ADDRESS_1260] can be supported 
on nCPAP alone  and is the main intervention that aerosolized surfactant seeks to avoid. When 
limited  to the initial 72 hour period, i ntubation occurred in 21 (53%) of control subjects  (Figure 
1-2); the incidence was generally similar in each of the 5 individual control groups, thus all 
controls were pooled for comparison. Overall, 20 (50%) subjects in the active groups were 
intubated. However, notably fewer subjects were intubated with the higher 3 dosages (7/23 , 
30%) than with th e lower 2 dosages (11/ 16, 69%).  Additionally, time to intubation was longer in 
active subject s (mean±SE of 55±36 hrs) than controls (19±4 hrs) , particularly for subjects in the 
higher 3 dosage groups ( Figure 1-3).

In conclusion, t he results from Study 03 -CL-1201  demonstrate that delivery of lucinactant as  an 
aerosol using the ADS  is feasible and that lucinactant for inhalation appears to be generally 
well-tolerated in infants 29-34 weeks PMA  with RDS . Exploratory assessment of clinical 
efficacy parameters suggests  that lucinactant for inhalation may be pro viding beneficial effects.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study 03 -CL-1401  
Study 03 -CL-1401 is a Phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, open -label, controlled dose -escalation 
study assessing the safety and tolerability of aerosolized lucinactant delivered using the ADS in 
preterm infants 2 6 to 28 completed weeks PMA. The planned intent is to evaluat e the safety of 
up to 4 dose-exposures of aerosolized lucinactant in conjunction with nCPAP : [ADDRESS_1262]/kg , 75

Protocol  No.: 03-CL-[ADDRESS_1263]/kg , [ADDRESS_1264]/kg and [ADDRESS_1265]/kg . One repeat dose is possible for all dosages. 
Neonates treated with  nCPAP alone serve as the control group.  A total of [ADDRESS_1266] received IRB/REB/EC, health authority approval, where 
applicable, and sponsor approval for participation in the study.

control group; the [ADDRESS_1269]/kg group is not yet open for e nrollment. Active and control 
subjects have been similar in terms of gestational age, birth weight, gender, race and ethnic 
origin.  All active subjects received at least one treatment, and 15 (68%) received a repeat 
treatment . Median  time to initiation of study treatment was 5.3 hours after birth.  
Study drug treatment (initial or repeat) was discontinued early in 9 (41%) subjects: 8 (36%) due 
to “device failure or malfunction” and none due to signs of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1429] . Most (5/8, 63%)  of the device errors have been due to a “syringe pressure 
out of range ” error , which likely resulted from micro -occlusions within the filter in the ADP , 
predominantly with certain manufacturing lots . When such errors occurred, supplementa l 
lucinactant for inhalation was administered according to a schedule such that subjects received 
90-110% of the intended dosage.  
To date, the incidence of AEs and common complications of prematurity have been as expected 
for this population. AEs have been  comparable between treatment and control groups, occurring 
in all active and control subjects. The [ADDRESS_1270] been neonatal apnea  (occurring 
in 15 [68%] active and 17 [74%] control subjects) , neonatal anemia  (12 [55%] active and 9 
[39%] controls) , and neonatal jaundice  (9 [41%] active and 12 [52%] controls) . The [ADDRESS_1271] 
common complications of prematurity were apnea  (16/22 [73%] active and 15/23 [65%] 
control s), PDA (10/22 [45%]  active and 6/23 [26%] controls), and acquired sepsis (6/22 [27%] 
active and 3/23 [13%] control subjects). The small numbers of subjects in each group makes 
comparisons of these preliminary data difficult, but to date incidences appear to be generally 
comparable. Peri-dosing events have been  uncommon, occurring in 7 (32%)  active subjects with 
no clear increase in incidence as dosage has increased. The [ADDRESS_1272] been desaturation  in 6 (27%) subjects , bradycardia in 3 (14%) subjects, and apnea in 3

After enrollment in each dosing group of Study 03 -CL-1401 was completed, the Safety Review 
Committee (SRC) reviewed all safety data as specified in the study protocol. No findings of 
concern were identified, and the study was allowed to proceed to subseque nt dosing groups.  In 
addition, the SRC agreed that neonates 26 -28 weeks PMA could be enrolled in the present study  
(Study 03 -CL-1202) . 
Study 03 -CL-1401 was neither designed nor powered to investigate efficacy. However, clinical 
parameters associated with e fficacy (and safety) were measured. Preliminary results are 
described here for completeness and to inform dosage selection for Part B of the present study 
(see Section 2.2.3 ). 
To date, active subjects have been no different from controls in change in FiO 2 or PCO 2 or in 
incidence of intubation within 72 hours of life  (Figure 1-4). The reason for this apparent lack of 
effect is uncertain . As a safety study, Study [ADDRESS_1280] any difference in eff icacy parameters , particularly since the 
likelihood of intubation in general rises with lower GA . Both active and control subjects were 
much more likely to be intubated if their baseline FiO 2 was ≥0.35 ( 10/11 [91%] active and 9/9 
[100%] controls) vs <0.35 (7/12 [58%] active and 6/14 [43%] controls), suggesting that subjects 
whose baseline FiO 2 was ≥0.35 were highly likely to be intubated regardless of treatment 
assignment. As a dose -escalation study, it is also possible that an effective dosage has not yet 
been reached, particularly since RDS is more common and often more severe in this immature 
Lucinactant for Inhalation  - CONFIDENTIAL  - Discovery Laboratories, Inc.  
Protocol  No.: 03-CL-[ADDRESS_1281] a greater  deficiency of 
surfactant and would require a higher dosage.  Finally, since the literature supports administering 
SRT as early as possible especially in extremely preterm neonates (2-6), it is possible that the 
time between birth and treatment ( 5.3 hours) and the interval between treatments ( 4.6 hours) 
reduced the effectiveness of the treatment . This is supported by [CONTACT_1551] ( Figure 1-5).

 2 STUDY DESIGN AND RAT IONALE  
This study will investigate the safety and effica cy of lucinactant for inhalation in conjunction 
with nCPAP compar ed to nCPAP alone. The study design is broken into 2 sequential parts.  Part 
A will be masked and include neonates 28  to 32 completed weeks PMA. Part B will  commence 
after completion of Part A, will include neonates 26 to 28 completed weeks PMA , and will  be 
open -label . Part A will include 2 dos ages of lucinactant for inhalation in 3 parallel treatment 
groups ([ADDRESS_1283]/kg lucinactant for inhalation, [ADDRESS_1284]/ kg lucinactant for inhalation, and 
nCPAP only ; initial single dose with up to 2 repeat doses ) in preterm neonates [ADDRESS_1285] 20 hours after birth, who had 
successful implementation of non-invasive support  or ventilation  within 90 minutes of birth , and 
who are candidates for SRT.  Part B will include 1 dosage of lucinactant for inhalation in 2  
parallel treatment groups ( [ADDRESS_1286]/kg lucinactant for inhalation and nCPAP only; single dose 
with up to 4 repeat d oses) in preterm neonates [ADDRESS_1287] 12 hours after birth, who had successful implementation of non -invasive 
support or ventilation within 60 minutes of birth, and who are candidates for SRT.  
2.1 Study Design  
This study is a sequential 2-part, multinational, multicenter, masked  (Part A)/open -label  (Part B) , 
randomized, controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lucinactant for inhalation in 
conjunction with nCPAP compared with nCPAP alone, in preterm neonates 28 to 32  completed 
weeks PMA (Part A) and in preterm neonates 26  to 28 completed weeks  PMA  (Part B). There 
will be 2  phases in Parts A and B of the study : a primary phase through 36 weeks PMA and a 
longer -term follow -up phase through 1 -year corrected age.  Data will be analyzed and reported at 
the completion of each respective study phase  for Parts A and B of the study . 
Before study enrollment, parents or legal guardians will provide a signed written informed 
consent form (ICF) for each potential subject. Qualification for study enrollment will be 
established after informed consent has been p rovided and after confirmation that the subject has 
met all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. The clinical criteria for 
enrollment may be met prior to informed consent being obtained; however, no study -specific 
procedures that a re not part of the usual standard care of the subject at the institution may be 
performed until the informed consent has been provided by a legally authorized representative of 
the subject.

Protocol  No.: 03-CL-[ADDRESS_1288] 20 hours after birth include 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1407] a requirement for nCPAP of 5 to 7 cm H 2O and a fraction of 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] (FiO 2) ≥0.25 (>0.21 for neonates 28 weeks PMA) to 0.4  to maintain oxygen 
saturation measured  by [CONTACT_406] (SpO 2) of 90% to 95% for at least [ADDRESS_1289] 12 hours after birth include respi[INVESTIGATOR_1408] a requirement for nCPAP of 5  to 7 cm H2O with a FiO 2 >0.21 to 0.4 to 
maintain SpO 2 of 90% to 95% for at least 20 minutes . As soon as study qualification has been 
confirmed and the informed consent  is signed, subjects  will be immediately randomized  to an 
active treatment group (2 active groups in Part A; 1 active group in Par t B) or the control 
(nCPAP only , with simulated [“sham”] study drug treatment  in Part A ) group. Subjects in Part A 
will be enrolled by [CONTACT_1534] : approximately 5-10% (12 -24) of the subjects will be 28  completed 
weeks PMA and approximately 206-228 of the  subjects 29 to 32 completed weeks PMA . 
Randomization in P art B will be stratified  by [CONTACT_1552]  (26, 27, and  
28 completed weeks PMA)  and up to 80 pa tients  will be enrolled . Study therapy (lucinactant for 
inhalation or sham/ control) must be initiated as soon as possible after randomization.  Treatment 
groups are outlined in Section  5.5. 
In Part A, s ubjects may be eligible to receive up to 2 repeat doses  of the treatment to which they 
are assigned . Repeat doses will be given  as soon as  2 hours from completion of the previous dose 
up to 36 hours after completion of randomization if subjects meet repeat dosing criteria , unless it 
is unsafe to do so in the judgment of the investigator , as described in Section 5.7. Should this 
situation arise the investigator will document the circumstances in the eCRF. Subjects 
randomized to a control group will be continued on nCPAP alone  but will receive repeated sham 
treatment to maintain study masking . 
In Part B, s ubjects in the active group may be eligible to receive up to 4 repeat doses  of the 
treatment to which they are assigned . Repeat doses will be given  as soon as 30 minutes  from 
completion of the previous dose up to 36 hours after  completion of randomization if subjects 
meet repeat dosing criteria , unless it is unsafe to do so in the judgment of the investigator , as 
described in Section 5.7. 
In both parts  of the study , all subjects in the active treatment groups will receive the same drug 
concentration of lucinactant for inhalation ([ADDRESS_1290]/mL) at the same rate  of delivery  
(aerosolized concentration of 4.[ADDRESS_1291]/L in aerosol carrier gas flow of 3 L/min) . The dos age 
will vary by [CONTACT_1553]. Lucinactant for inhalation will 
be delivered  by [CONTACT_1554] a commercially available

 nCPAP generator and patie nt interface. Details on dosage calculations and rationale are given in 
Section 2.2, and the drug delivery device is outlined in Section  5.1. 
In Part A, treatment  assignments will be masked from  the principal investigator (PI) , clinical and 
study staff (eg, site coordinator , bedside nurse ), as  applicable; sponsor , as applicable ; and 
subject’s parents/legal guardians. In Part B, treatment assignments will be open -label.  
All enrolled subjects will receive study treatment in a NICU, a specialized care center staffed by 
[CONTACT_1532], nurses, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1430]. Neonates in the NICU are continuously 
monitored using advanced and sophisticated monitoring equipment, and there is ready and 
immediate access t o equipment, medications, and skilled personnel that may be needed to 
address emergent developments. Interventions such as endotracheal intubation, MV, and 
traditional surfactant administration will be readily available to all study subjects if clinically 
indicated in accordance with the high -level standard -of-care customary in the NICU.  
In both p arts of the study , neonates will be followed for the primary phase efficacy and safety 
evaluations through 36  weeks PMA, NICU discharge, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1410], or deat h (whichever 
occurs first ). For the longer -term follow -up phase, neonates will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1555] 6 -
months corrected age and followed up to 1 -year corrected age, at which time a physical 
examination will be performed, including an abbreviated neurologic assessment. (See also 
Sections 7 and 8.)

2.2 Dose and Device Description  and Rationale  
In Part A of this study, up to  160 subjects ( up to 80 in each of the  2 lucinactant for inhalation 
treatment group s) and in Part B up to 40 subjects will be randomized to an active treatment 
group and will receive aerosolized lucinactant through the ADS in conjunction with nCPAP. Up 
to 80 subjects in Part A and up to 40 in Part B will be randomized to the control group and will 
receive nCPAP alone  with “sham” study drug treatment . 
2.2.[ADDRESS_1292]’s nCPAP  system, allow ing administration of aerosolized 
surfactant while maintaining respi[INVESTIGATOR_1431].  
Unlike prior attempts to aerosolize surfactants  with conventional nebulizers , the ADS may 
aerosolize lucinactant  in sufficient quantities to affect a therapeutic response sufficient to avoid 
endotracheal intubation. A device that permits effective surfactant aerosolization to neon ates 
while receiving nCPAP support for the treatment of RDS may improve the success of nCPAP 
therapy  and better avoid the potential deleterious effects of endotracheal intubation and 
mechanical ventilation .

 2.2.2 Rationale for Study Control  
Preterm neonates who  are treated for RDS initially with non-invasive ventilation (including 
nCPAP)  are the appropriate controls for this study , since the addition of aerosolized surfactant 
would be the only difference in treatment in the active groups compared to the controls . Current 
guidelines allow  use of non-invasive ventilation such as  nCPAP as an initial modality for the 
treatment of RDS in preterm newborns, with the goal of avoiding endotracheal intubation  (3-6, 
11). 
Initial treatment with brief intubation, surfactant delivery and extubation (the “INSURE” 
technique) or other forms of intratracheal (eg, the “LISA” or “MIST” techniques) or supraglottic 
(eg, via laryngeal mask airway) surfactant instillation represent  potential alternati ve therapeuti c 
strategies  for SRT in RDS which would not demonstrate the effectiveness of aerosolized 
lucinactant in an isolated fashion, and thus would not be appropriate control s. 
Each of the 4 components of lucinactant (see Section  5.2.1 ) plays a role in its biological activity . 
Aerosolized vehicles (eg, sterile water or saline)  may have an adverse effect on pulmonary 
function . Thus, no inert placebo exists. T herefore, “sham” treatment, in which the ADS is 
brought to the subject ’s bedside but not used to deliver study drug, is the optimal  control  for the 
blinded Part A while continued nCPAP is the appropriate control for the open -label Part B . 
All study treatme nts (whether active or control) are given only if subject s are stable enough that 
they do not require intubation. Such subject s would typi[INVESTIGATOR_1432] -invasive ventilation . Since control/sham treatment is equi valent to standard 
care, it is therefore ethical to administer for initial or repeat dosing.  
2.2.3 Dosage Rationale  
[IP_ADDRESS]  General Considerations in Dos age Selection  
Lucinactant, administered as an intratracheal  liquid  bolus at a dose of [ADDRESS_1293]/kg 
(5.8 mL/kg of a [ADDRESS_1294]/mL suspension) has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in 
the prevention of RDS in preterm neonates at high risk for RDS  and has been approved by [CONTACT_1556] (trade name [CONTACT_1638]®, NDA 021746 ). However, the precise quantity of surfactant 
replacement required by [CONTACT_1557].  The amount of 
surfactant needed by a neonate increases with alveolar surface area, which increases with weight 
and gestational age. The amou nt of endogenous surfactant available to a neonate depends 
critically on gestational age and l ung maturation , but also on a number of other immeasurable 
Lucinactant for Inhalation  - CONFIDENTIAL  - Discovery Laboratories, Inc.  
Protocol  No.: 03-CL-1202   Amendment 2, 19 April 2017

 factors including lung inflammation, prenatal steroids, etc.  Although neonates born at a lower 
gestatio nal age are likely to be more surfactant deficient compared with neonates born at higher 
gestational ages, dosing algorithms based on gestational age or birth weight would be inadequate 
to estimate the dose of exogenous surfactant that should be administer ed to adequately replete 
surfactant and thereby [CONTACT_1558].  
Neonates at high risk for RDS are presumed to be substantially or wholly surfactant deficient ; 
these neonates  require immediate endotracheal intubation , SRT  and MV. In contrast, the 
population of p reterm neonates who can be sustained by [CONTACT_1559], rather than endotracheal 
intubation and MV, likely represent a broad spectrum of varying degrees of surfactant deficiency  
who may not  require the full intratracheal dose of SRT. Study KL4 -CPAP -01 (27) (Section 
1.3.1 ) suggested an appropriate dosage of aerosolized lucinactant (using the  Aeroneb® Pro 
Nebulizer System ) for premature neonates with RDS supported with nCPAP could be in the 
range of [ADDRESS_1295]/k g, substantially lower than the intratracheal bolus lucinactant dosage of 
[ADDRESS_1296]/kg. Preclinical studies in animal models of RDS (28) and acute lung injury  (29) 
suggest that the effective dosage of aerosolized surfactant may be as little as 5% that of the 
effective dosage of intratracheal surfactant. Thus, it i s likely that preterm neonates on nCPAP 
will require substantially less than the intratracheal bolus dose of [ADDRESS_1297]/kg of lucinactant.   
Inhalation al delivery of drugs is extremely inefficient compared to most other modes of delivery . 
When delivered tra ditionally as an intratracheal bolus of liquid , it is highly likely that most, if not 
all, of the instilled surfactant will ultimately arrive at its site of action in the alveoli  since 
surfactants tend to spread along surfaces . Studies in neonatal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1433]  (30) but with similar physiologic effects  (31).  
Delivery of an aerosol to the alveoli will vary depending on the characteristics of the device (eg, 
condensation within tubing or impaction within the device ), the aerosol  itself  (eg, particle size 
and rate of administration ), and the br eathing characteristics of the individual neonate (eg, 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1434], frequency, tidal volume). To reach the alveoli and 
be deposited there , inhaled particles typi[INVESTIGATOR_1435] a diameter ≤5 μm. Ideally, t he rate of 
aerosol  administration is kept constant  and similar to the neonate’s inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1436] . Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1437] , although are less variable  than in older infants and 
children . Minute ventilation  is the amount of air exchanged (inhaled and exhaled) in one minute, 
and is calculated as  the product of breathing frequency and tidal volume . Minute ventilation

Protocol  No.: 03-CL-1202   Amendment 2, 19 April 2017

 generally tends to be less variable than the pattern of individual breaths. Since minute ventilation 
is related to body surface area , which is  in turn dependent on body weight  (32, 33), it can be used 
to estimate the theoretical maximum inhal able dose of aerosolized surfactant normalized to body 
weight. The actual inhaled dose is likely to be less than the theoretical maximum since some 
aerosolized surfactant will be exp elled during exhalation or will deposit in the naso- and 
oropharynx where it  may then be swallowed. When lucinactant was aerosolized using the ADS 
and delivered via nCPAP (5 cmH 2O) to cynomolgus macaques, whose airway anatomy is similar 
to that of preterm human neonates, the inhaled dose was deposited homogenously throughout the 
lungs  (34). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Calculation of the Theoretical Inhaled  Dose  
The emitted  dose of lucinactant for inhalation  is the amount of aerosolized lucinactant delivered 
to the subject at the output of the aerosol tube where it joins the patient nCPAP interface. The 
theoretical inhaled dose is the amount of aerosolized lucinactant predicted to be inhaled by [CONTACT_1560]. This inhaled  dose is a function of the concentration of lucinactant in the aerosol, the 
amount of aerosol inhaled by [CONTACT_423] (estimated by [CONTACT_423]’s minute ventilation , assuming 
that all gas inhaled by [CONTACT_1561] a erosol ), and the duration 
of exposure to the aerosol. Thus, the dose can be estimated using the following equation:  
 
TkgVm C = Dose Inhaled  Equation 1  
Where:  C = Concentration  of lucinactant in aerosol (in mg TPL/L)  
 Vm/kg  = Minute ve ntilation normalized to body weight  (in L/min/kg) 
 T = Dose duration (in minutes ) 
 
All of the lucinactant that flows through the CAG is aerosolized; however, since much of the 
aerosolized drug impacts within the aerosol tubing only 35% reaches the patient interfac e. The 
emitted dose rate of the ADS is therefore the product of the flow rate of lucinactant through the 
CAG (1.2  mL/min), the concentration of the reconstituted lucinactant in the dosing syringe 
([ADDRESS_1298]/mL) and the fraction of the aerosolized  dose that is reaches  the patient interface 
(35%) (see Investigator’s Brochure for further information) : 
 Emitted dose  rate = 1.2 mL/min   [ADDRESS_1299]/mL   0.35 = 12.[ADDRESS_1300]/min   Equation 2

 The aerosolized lucinactant is carried to the patient interface by a gas (generally a mix of air and 
supplemental oxygen). The rate of  flow of the carrier gas  was chosen to be 3 L/min, which 
represents the typi[INVESTIGATOR_1438]  (33, 35). The 
concentration of aerosolized lucinactant in the carrier gas (C) is the refore the  emitted dose  rate 
(12.[ADDRESS_1301]/min) divided by [CONTACT_1562] (3  L/min).

Minute ventilation (Vm) of preterm neonates can be esti mated based on body weight, as shown  
in Table 2-1 (32, 33). When normalized to body weight, minute ventilation of the subjects 
expected to enroll in this study (750 to 2250 g) can be approximated as  0.4 L/min/kg.

The time required to deliver  the desired dose (T) can therefore be calculated by [CONTACT_1564] 1 in terms of T; that is, dividing the desired theoretical inhaled dose by [CONTACT_1565] 
C (4.[ADDRESS_1304]/L) and Vm (0.4 L/min/kg). For example, this calculation yields dose durations of 
[ADDRESS_1305]/kg and [ADDRESS_1306]/kg . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rationale for Dosages Used in the Current Study  
The dosages used in completed study [ADDRESS_1307]/kg and 
in ongoing study [ADDRESS_1308]/kg. From the practical 
standpoint, however, a dosage > [ADDRESS_1309]/kg is cumbersome to administer. Two lucinactant

Protocol  No.: 03-CL-[ADDRESS_1310]/kg.  The higher dosage is the largest dosage that can be practically 
administered with a single 60  mL syringe. Using the dosage calculation in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , the 
dosing durations for the [ADDRESS_1311]/kg and [ADDRESS_1312]/kg dos ages would be 25 and 50  minutes, 
respectively.  Dosages are approximate, as each neonate’s minute ventilation and pulmonary 
characteristics may vary slightly.  If higher dosages are necessary, this  can be achieved with 
repeat dosing , as is frequently done with intratracheal surfactant administration  (1). Part A of this 
study will evaluate both dosages, while Part B will use only the [ADDRESS_1313]/kg dosage.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Nonclinical Experience Supporting Dose Rationale  
Study MB [ADDRESS_1314]/kg lucinactant (20  mL/kg) or 20  mL/kg 
Tris/NaCl buffer were administered orally by [CONTACT_1566] 2 equal volumes (10 mL/kg) at 
2- or 4-hour intervals to adult rabbits (2 males and 2 females per treatment group). A total of 
[ADDRESS_1315]/kg of lucinactant was administered enterally. No evidence of  any toxic effect was 
found in any animals in this study.  
Two completed  nonclinical animal toxicology studies in pre -weaned rabbits ( Study N107662) 
and pre -weaned rats ( Study N107663) evaluated the acute toxicity of inhaled lucinactant 
(aerosolized by [CONTACT_1567]). Rabbits and rats were exposed to aerosol on 2 consecutive 
days by a nose -only inhalation exposure system. Aerosolized l ucinactant low -, mid -, and high -
dose groups were compared with air control and vehicle. Aerosolized l ucinactant dose selecti ons 
were based on the following; (1) potential human exposure (2) existing toxicity data (3) 
limitations imposed by [CONTACT_1568] (4) the exposure apparatus and its procedures, and (5) 
the stability of the experimental atmosphere. A total of [ADDRESS_1316] /kg of lucinactant aerosol 
was administered to rabbits over [ADDRESS_1317]/kg of lucinactant aerosol 
was administered to rats over [ADDRESS_1318] levels ( NOAELs ) were 
established to ensure adequate safety in preterm neonates.  
These nonclinical studies ( Studies MB 04 -[ZIP_CODE].01, N107662, N107663) provide a safety 
margin of  > 10:[ADDRESS_1319] possible dose in Part A ([ADDRESS_1320]/kg)  and > 6.75:1 for the 
Lucinactant for Inhalation  - CONFIDENTIAL  - Discovery Laboratories, Inc.  
Protocol  No.: 03-CL-[ADDRESS_1321] possible dose in Part B ([ADDRESS_1322]/kg) , whether delivered to the lungs 
(> [ADDRESS_1323]/kg) or swallowed ([ADDRESS_1324]/kg) (including volume load and sodium load).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Experience Supporting Dose Rationale  
In neonat es [ADDRESS_1325]/kg can be estimated by 
[CONTACT_1569] ([ADDRESS_1326]/kg) and above ([ADDRESS_1327]/kg) 
in Study 03 -Cl-1201 (see Section 1.3.2  for full description of this study). AEs, SAEs and 
complications of prematurity occurred at rates in these two groups similar to the remainder of the 
active cohort and controls, suggesting [ADDRESS_1328]/kg would be well-tolerated . Dosages of [ADDRESS_1329]/kg reduced nCPAP failure: of the 15 subjects treated with these dosages, 4 (27%) 
had nCPAP failure within 72 hrs of life vs 53% of pooled contr ols (Figure 1-2). Further, dosages 
of [ADDRESS_1330]/kg appeared to delay nCPAP failure as well, since none of the active 
subject s had nCPAP failure  within 6 hours of dosing vs 18% of pooled controls  (Figure 2-2, 
Figure 2-3). The reduction in nCPAP failure rate at 72 hours was seen both in subjects with 
lower (29 -31 weeks PMA) and higher (32 -34 weeks PMA) gestational age  (Figure 2-4). These 
results suggest [ADDRESS_1331]/kg dosage is likely to be effective.

In neonates [ADDRESS_1335]/kg can be estimated by 
[CONTACT_1572] ([ADDRESS_1336]/kg) in Study [ADDRESS_1337]/kg would be well-
tolerated . FiO 2 was observed to fall more quickly in this group than in controls ( Figure 2-5), 
suggesting a positive physiological effect on lung compliance. The rate and timing of nCPAP 
failure was not observed to be different in this group from control; however, the study was not 
powered for efficacy evaluations. Repeat treatment of each dosage wi ll also be available for each 
subject, which may improve efficacy at this dosage.  Taken together, these results suggest the [ADDRESS_1338]/kg dosage is likely to be well-tolerated and to have the potential for efficacy , 
particularly with the ability to provide repeat doses .

In neonates 26-[ADDRESS_1340]/kg with a possible repeat dose  have been administered.  AEs, 
SAEs and complications of prematurity have occurred at rates in the act ive groups similar to the

would be well -tolerated. To date, nCPAP failure at [ADDRESS_1342]/kg dosage , but tends to occur later in 
active patients ( Figure 1-5). There are several possible explanations for this observation (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), but the likelihood is that the dosages deliv ered to neonates [ADDRESS_1343] been inadequate to compensate for their greater surfactant deficiency 
relative to neonates 29 -32 wks PMA. In addition, the observation that intubation in active

 subjects occurred later than in control s in both Study 03 -CL-1401 ( Figure 1-5) and Study 03 -CL-
1202 ( Figure 2-2) suggest that lucinactant for inhalation may delay respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], raising the 
possibility that earlier and more frequently repeated doses may hold off respi[INVESTIGATOR_1439] , which is the natural course of RDS. For 
this reason, Part B of this study focuses  on administration of  lucinactant for inhalation which 
begins as early and is repeated as often as practically possible, with as short a time between 
repeated doses as  practically possible.  
Limited additional inferences can be made from prior clinical studies in which lucinactant was 
administered using aerosol generators other than the ADS or through non -aerosol administration. 
A prior clinical study of aerosolized luci nactant ( Study KL4-CPAP -01) (27) using a 
commercially -available vibrating mesh nebulizer generated a theoretical inhaled dose of 
approximately [ADDRESS_1344]/ kg over a 3 -hour period for RDS  prophylaxis in preterm neonates 28 
to 32 weeks PMA (Section  1.3.1 ). In this cohort of 17 neonates, 5 (30%) required intratracheal 
SRT, suggesting that the dosage used may be efficacious.  
Subjects in Part A of this study may receive up to [ADDRESS_1345]/kg group of Part A could receive a 
total of [ADDRESS_1346]/kg over approximately [ADDRESS_1347]/kg o ver a somewhat shorter interval . Repeated doses of 
intratracheal surfactant are often necessary and beneficial in neonates with RDS  (1). In stud y 03-
CL-1201  (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), 3 subjects received repeated doses: [ADDRESS_1348]/kg 
group (total dose of [ADDRESS_1349]/kg) and [ADDRESS_1350]/kg group (total dose of [ADDRESS_1351]/kg). In Study 03 -CL-1401 (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), [ADDRESS_1352]/kg (total 
dosage of [ADDRESS_1353]/kg) have been administered over approximately [ADDRESS_1354] been 
well-tolerated. No AEs or ADEs related to study treatment occurred with repeat dosing in these 
subjects. For comparison, t he dosage of lucinactant (Surfaxin®) approved by [CONTACT_1573] [ADDRESS_1355]/kg, with up to 3 repeat doses (total dose of [ADDRESS_1356]/kg) over [ADDRESS_1357] received doses of Surfaxin® [ADDRESS_1358]/k g 
(36) by [CONTACT_1574], and adults with acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1440] 8.55 g ([ADDRESS_1359]/kg) by [CONTACT_1575]  (37). Thus, 
dosages administered in both Parts A and B of this study are well within the FDA -approved 
dosage of intratracheal lucinactant . 
Lucinactant for Inhalation  - CONFIDENTIAL  - Discovery Laboratories, Inc.  
Protocol  No.: 03-CL-[ADDRESS_1360] be considered within the context of treating RDS in preterm 
infants (Section 1.1), which carries with it substantial risk of morbidity  and mortality. These 
infants often require intratracheal SRT as well as MV in order to survive; however, both MV and  
endotracheal intubation  are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality in this fragile 
population . Various types of non-invasive s upport and ventilation , including nCPAP, have been 
used to avoid endotracheal intubation and MV . However , nCPAP will be unsuccessful in about 
one third to one half of neonates with RDS, who will then require invasive MV and endotracheal 
intubation to recei ve SRT. Survivors are at risk of complications of prematurity including BPD, 
ROP, IVH and NEC.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Risk and Benefit of Control Treatment  
As described in Section 5.4.2 , control treatment in Part A of this study involves continuing 
subjects on nCPAP while the ADS is delivered to the bedside (in a blinded fashion) but is not 
used (“sham” treatment) , and in Part B involves continuing nCPAP alone . Thus, contro l/sham 
treatment  in both Part A and B of the study  is identical to standard therapy with nCPAP. As 
described in Section 2.2.2 , control/sham treatme nt in subjects who do not require endotracheal 
intubation is ethical.  
Known risks of standard nCPAP include nasal irritation/breakdown of the skin around the nose, 
apnea, oxygen desaturation , and air leak (eg, pneumothorax). Air leak with nCPAP has been 
reported in 3 to 47% of preterm neonates, and may be somewhat more common in neonates with 
greater gestational age (Section 1.1.1 ). The risk of requiring endotracheal intubation and SRT has 
been reported as 33 -67% (Section 1.1.1 ). Risks of nCPAP in the prior clinical study using the 
ADS (Study 03 -Cl-1201, Section 1.3.2 ) were consistent with those reported in the literature.  
Standard nCPAP, and therefore control treatment, has the benefit of providing respi[INVESTIGATOR_1441]. The important outcome of survival 
without BPD is equal to or more frequent with nCPAP compared to with trad itional treatment 
with endotracheal intubation and SRT (Section 1.1.1 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Risk and Benefit  of Active Treatment  
Because the ADS delivers lucinactant f or inhalation via conventional nCPAP (Section 5.6), 
active treatment would include the same risks and benefits of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1442]  - CONFIDENTIAL  - Discovery Laboratories, Inc.  
Protocol  No.: 03-CL-1202   Amendment 2, 19 April 2017  
 
 
Page 54 of 124 
 nCPAP therapy described above in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . Active treatment would carry the additional 
risks and benefits of aerosolized SRT with lucinactant for inhalation.  
Lucinactant for inhalation is the reconstituted form of a lyophilized liquid surfactant (Su rfaxin® 
[lucinactant]); therefore, the known class risks of SRT with liquid surfactant via the intratracheal 
route may be applicable. These risks are described in the Investigator’s Brochure and the 
Surfaxin® Product Insert, and include acute changes in lung compliance, bradycardia, oxygen 
desaturation, and airway obstruction. Rates of these adverse reactions and complications of 
prematurity were similar with Surfaxin® as with comparator surfactants. Pulmonary  hemorrhage 
has been reported with intratracheal SRT , including  with Surfaxin®.  
In the prior clinical study using aerosolized lucinactant for inhalation via the ADS (Study 03 -CL-
1201, Section 1.3.2 ), the incidence of AEs was similar in subjects receiving active treatment 
compared to controls and were as expected for this population of premature neonates. The [ADDRESS_1361] common 
peri-dosing events were transient desaturation in 5 (13%) subjects, nasal irritation in 2 (5%) 
subjects, and vomiting in 2 (5%) subjects. Obstruction  of the nares or upper airway by [CONTACT_1576] i s a theoretical risk but was not observed in Study [ADDRESS_1362] obstruction, all subjects are continuously attended by a qualified clinician during dosing 
and are continuously monitored for oxygen saturation (SaO 2) and transcu taneous PCO 2. 
Although the drug product is heated during aerosolization, it cools to 23 -38°C during delivery 
and the ADS will shut down if aerosol temperature is >38°C; thermal injury to neonates was not 
observed in Study [ADDRESS_1363] fluid and electrolyte balance; however, no such problems were observed in 
Study 03 -CL-1201 and electrolytes will be assessed in the present study.  
Risk of air leak was 23% in active treatment subj ects vs 18% (23% based on independent 
radiologist review) among controls. Experience with repeated dosing is limited to 3 subjects in 
Study 03 -CL-1201; although  each received dosages higher than planned for the present study, 
incidence of AEs in these 3 su bjects was similar to that in the remainder of the cohort.  
Automatic shutdown of the ADS was uncommon in study 03 -CL-1201 (10% of subjects) and 
mostly (3/4 shutdowns) occurred at the highest dosage; only 1 shutdown occurred at a dosage 
([ADDRESS_1364]/kg) simil ar to that proposed in the present study. All shutdowns resulted from error 
codes, and none resulted in any AE being reported. All  subjects maintain ed nCPAP and 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1443], demonstrating the important safeguard that nCPAP is

 maintained even if the ADS fails (Section 5.1). One ADE of nasal inflammation occurred; no 
other device -related performance issues resulted in any ha rm to subjects. A complete qualitative 
risk assessment has been completed to identify and mitigate potential safety risks associated with 
use of the ADS.  
In ongoing study [ADDRESS_1365] been observed . Risk of air leak has been 
lower than in Study 03 -CL-1201: 18% in active subjects and 9% in controls. Automatic 
shutdown of the ADS has occurred in 41% of subjects ; as with Study [ADDRESS_1366]  
shutdowns resulted from error codes, and none resulted in loss of nCPAP or in any AE being 
reported  related to the shutdown . The cause of one type of error code has been identified ( syringe 
pressure out of range , mainly in certa in ADP lots), and a corrective action has been undertaken 
(addition of a pre -filter  for these lots of ADPs ; see Investigator ’s Brochure for details)  in regions 
where these ADP lots have been distributed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Alternative s to Study Treatment  
Alternative approac hes to treating neonates with (or at risk for) RDS, as described in Sections 
1.1 and 2.2.2 , include attempting to support the neonate solely with a form of NIV (possibly 
including nCPAP) and without SRT; supporting the neonate with NIV and reserving 
intratracheal SRT (using various techniques) o nly for those who require intubation; and the 
traditional approach of supporting the neonate with invasive MV and intratracheal SRT. As 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  above, the former 2 approaches are identical to control treatment in 
the present study.  Each of these approaches is supported by [CONTACT_1577]  (3-6, 11), 
and no strategy has yet been demonstrated as being superior in neonates who do not require 
immediate intubation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Summary of Risk -Benefit Assessment  
In summary, the potential benefit of lucinactant for inhalation delivered via the ADS is greater 
than the potent ial risk, especially when that risk is considered in the context of the risks of 
standard care of the premature newborn , including those of nCPAP . Further clinical study  of this 
therapy  in premature infants is therefore justified.

Protocol  No.: 03-CL-[ADDRESS_1381] s will receive “sham” study drug 
treatment: the ADS will be brought to the bedside but will not be used, and no active study drug 
will be administ ered. In Part B of the study, control subjects will continue on nCPAP without 
sham treatment. All subjects, including controls, may receive repeat treatments if repeat dosing 
criteria are met  (Part A: up to 2 repeat treatments; Part B: up to 4 repeat treat ments) . Subjects 
randomized to an active treatment group may be admin istered  additional  exposures of lucinactant 
for inhalation within 36 hours of randomization  (Part A: up to 2 additional exposures; Part B: up 
to 4 additional exposures) . Subjects in Part A randomized to control may receive an additional 1 
or 2 sham treatments while receiving nCPAP ; those in Part B randomized to control will 
continue on nCPAP . 
To maintain masking  in Part A , study treatment will occur behind a visual barrier ; the PI, study 
staff (eg, site coordinator) (as applicable), and attending physician as appropriate will not be 
allowed to observe preparation of study materials, setup of the device, or to observe the subject 
during study treatment unless an emergent condition develops. The sponsor (as applicable) and 
the parents/legal guardian will also remain masked. Part B of the study will be open -label. (See 
also Section 5.6.) 
If at any point during the delivery of lucinactant for inhalation a potential safety risk to the 
subject is identified, aerosolization must be discontinued  and local NICU procedures followed to 
ensure the safety of the subject. Any significant clinical findings or observations must be 
documented and communicated to Discovery at the earliest time point possible.  
5.1 AEROSURF Delivery System  
The ADS creates and delive rs aerosolized surfactant (lucinactant for inhalation) via 
2 components  (Figure 5-1): the durable ACU (Section  5.1.1 ) and the disposable ADP 
(Section  5.1.2 ). The ADS is designed for bedside use and i s mounted on a wheeled cart for easy 
transport.

Page 65 of 124 
 Details for study drug preparation and ADS operation are provided in the AEROSURF 
Investigator’s Brochure and in the ADS Operator’s Manual. Briefly, lyophilized drug is 
reconstituted immediately before use by [CONTACT_1583] [ADDRESS_1382]’s bedside and 
connected to the subject’s nCPAP via the patient interface connector. Carrier gas flow through 
the ADS is started at 3 L/min while the nCPAP gas flow is reduced by 3 L/min, which allows 
nCPAP to be maintained during treatment.  
A complete qualitative risk assessment has been completed to identify and mitigate potential 
safety risks associated with use of the ADS  and is described in the Investigators’ Brochure .

which heats the lucinactant for inhalation and produces the aerosol. The carrier gas tube carries 
gas from an external source (usually a blend of air and oxyg en) to the heater assembly, where it 
then drives the aerosol through the aerosol tube. Instructions for the proper set -up, connection , 
breakdown and return  of ADP components are provided in the ADS Operator’s Manual. One 
ADP will be required for each treat ment, with an additional ADP required for each repeat dose.

Note: Amounts reflect reconstituted product at [ADDRESS_1386]/mL  
5.2.2 Aerosol characteristics  
The aerosol is generated at a formulation flow rate of approximately 1.2 mL/min . The mass 
mean aerodynamic diameter ( MMAD ) of the aerosol is below 5.0  m, which is considered an 
appropriate size to be deposited in the alveolus  following inhalation . The carrier gas that carries 
the aerosol to the subject (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a mixture of air and supplemental oxygen) has a nominal 
flow rate of 3  L/minute. Approximately 65% of the aerosolized  dose condenses within the 
delivery tubing, leaving approximately 35% available  for inhalation by [CONTACT_1585].  A disposable fluid trap collects the aerosol that 
condenses within the delivery tubing . Calculations for the theoretical maximum inhaled  dose are 
given in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . The specification for the aerosol temperature at the patient interface is 
25C to 3 8C.  
5.2.3 Packaging and Labeling  
Lucinactant is supplied  in 30 -mL glass vials packaged in cartons with foam inserts to reduce 
breakage.  
Lucinactan t and the ADS will be appropriately labeled with the investigation caution statements 
required by [CONTACT_1586] (eg, FDA, EMA) to insure that users are aware th at the 
product is limited by [CONTACT_1587].   
5.3 Precautions for Aerosol Delivery and Device Usage  
The ADS, disposables and study drug are investigational materials which  are to be used only for 
investigational studies  with lucinactan t for inhalation  and not any other purpose. All equipment 
and supplies are to be returned to Discovery at the end of the study .

patient interface, both of which are  commercially available for nCPAP delivery to neonates. An 
unmasked study -trained s ite designee (eg , respi[INVESTIGATOR_1451]) must provide close 
monitoring of the subject and study device during aerosol delivery.  
Local NICU policies and procedures for nCPAP delivery are to be used, regardless of treatment 
group  assignment . During study treatment delivery, clinical  staff must ensure that the desired 
level of n CPAP is maintained. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_1452] , eg placing 
an oro - or nasogastric tube, securely but gently immobiliz ing the subject’s head , using p acifiers 
and/or chin strap , are encouraged during dosing.  Subjects must be also closely monitored for 
complications related to placement of the patient interface  (see Section 9).

cases, the subject must be removed from the device, and all local i nstitutional procedures must 
be followed to ensure continued safety and observation of the subject. The ADS Operator’s 
Manual outlines audible alarms and visual displays that may indicate delivery failure.  
5.4 Description of Treatment Groups  
The study treatme nt, ‘lucinactant for inhalation,’ consists of the investigational drug lucinactant 
and the delivery system ADS. The ADS has two components, the ADP and the AEROSURF® 
Control Unit (ACU) , described fully in Section 5.1. The rationale for the selected device and 
study treatment s, including active and control,  is discussed in Section  2.2.

 5.4.1 Aerosol Delivery  in the Active Treatment Groups  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Part A  
Study treatment is to begin within 2  hours after randomization. For subjects random ized to the 
active study treatment groups, the duration of treatment is 25 or 50  minutes  (corresponding to [ADDRESS_1390]/kg , respectively) in accordance with the subject’s treatment group. Repeat doses 
(up to 2) at the same dosage/duration  are to be given if repeat dosing criteria are met  unless it is 
unsafe to do so in the judgment of the investigator  (see Section  5.7). All study treatments are 
masked (see Section  5.6). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Part B  
Study treatment is to begin within 2  hours after randomization ; however, every effort should be 
made to begin study treatment as soon after randomization as possible (ideally, within 30 
minutes) . For subjects randomized to the active study treatment group, the duration of treatment 
is 50 minutes  (corresponding to [ADDRESS_1391]/kg ). Repeat doses (up to 4) of [ADDRESS_1392]/ kg are to 
be given  if repeat dosing criteria are met  unless it is unsafe to do so in the judgment of the 
investigator  (see Section  5.7). All study treatments are open -label.  
5.4.2 Treatment  in the  Control Group s 
As described in Section 2.2.2 , no inert placebo exists. The appropriate control is to remain on 
nCPAP alone without study drug treatment, which is the control in Part B of the study. For Part 
A of the study, the optimal  masked  control, therefore, is to simulate study  drug treatment in a 
masked fashion by [CONTACT_1588], a 
procedure known as “sham” treatment.  
For sham treatment, no active drug will be prepared. Instead, the ADS will be prepared and 
delivered to the bedside along with an inactive syringe in a masked manner. Masking will occur 
as with active treatment (eg, behind a curtain). The ADS itself will be brought to the bedside  but 
not used  (since doing so  would trigger alarms that would break masking) . Contro l subjects in 
Part A of the study will be randomized to either a sham of 25 minutes or a sham of 50 minutes. 
The s tart time will be the time at which the sham setup is complete and the nCPAP circuit is 
interrupted; the stop time  will be either [ADDRESS_1393] will be switched to clean  nCPAP 
equipment, as occurs at the end of active treatment. Masking equipment may then be removed.

Page 70 of 124 
 As with active treatment, control/sham  treatment in Part A of the study is to begin within 2  hours 
after randomization. Repeat control/sham treatments  (up to  2) for the same duration  as the initial 
treatment are to be given  if repeat dosing criteria are met  unless it is unsafe to do so in the 
judgment of the investigator  (see Section  5.7). As described in Section 2.2.2 , repeat treatment 
with control/sham in subject s who do not require intubation is ethical.  
Control subjects in Part B of the study will receive sham treatment (subject will be placed on the 
study interface); the ADS does not need to be brought to the bedside. Control subjects in Part B 
will not receive repeat treatments . 
5.5 Treatment Group s and Method of Treatment Group Assignment  
Subjects will be assigned to receive either 40 or 80 mg/kg lucinactant for inhalation in 
conjunction with nCPAP or control (nCPAP only , with sham treatment  of 25 or 50 minutes  in 
Part A of the study ) (Table 5-2). 
Table 5-2 Study Assignments by [CONTACT_1589]

aNote: In Part A of the study, m asking procedures for the initial dose will be followed for all repeat doses  in all 
treatment groups  
 
In Part A of the study, p reterm neonates who successfully meet all eligibility criteria will be 
randomly assigned within their applicable strat um (28 completed weeks PMA or 29 to 32

 completed weeks PMA)  to one of the 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio . In Part B of the study, 
preterm ne onates who successfully meet all eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned  within 
their applicable stratum (26 , 27, and  28 completed weeks PMA)  to one of the 2 treatment groups 
in a 1:1 ratio . 
Subjects will be randomized using centralized allocation e lectronically (eg, interactive web 
response system [IWRS]). Neonates from multiple births will be randomized independently. 
Randomization information will be provided to the study drug preparer (eg,  pharmacist). The PI, 
study staff (eg, site coordinator) ( as applicable), and attending physicians as appropriate will be 
masked to the treatment assignment , as described in the site’s blinding/masking plan .  
The randomization code list will be generated by [CONTACT_1590]. For Part A of 
the study,  the code list will use a block size of 6 ([ADDRESS_1400]/kg 2, [ADDRESS_1401]/kg 2, sham 
treatment of 25 minutes, sham treatment of 50 minutes) , stratified by [CONTACT_1591].  For Part B of the 
study, t he code list will use  a block size of 4  ([ADDRESS_1402]/kg 2, sham treatment of 50 minutes 
2). 
5.[ADDRESS_1403] assessments, study treatment masking  (blinding)  will be 
employed  in Part A of the Study . Details of the masking procedure are provided in the 03 -CL-
1202 Overall Blinding Plan, Blinding Procedure, Blinding Maintenance and Assurance  Plan, and 
Statistical Analysis Plan  documents. The blinding plan is outlined as follows:  
a. Subject  safety takes precedence over maintenance of study masking. If at any 
point masking equipment interferes with emergent patient care or knowledge of 
study treatment assignment is required for patient management, then the blind 
may be broken. If this occurs, then Discovery must be notified as soon as possible 
(see Section 9.2.2 ). 
b. Personnel making or influencing clinical decisions – especially regarding 
intubation or the level of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1453] a subject reaches 72 hours of 
life – must be masked from treatment assignment. Every effort should be made to 
maintain study masking at all times unless the blind needs to be broken for 
reasons of subject  safety. Clinicians may be masked for different subjects at 
different times, depending on the logistics at each site.

Page 72 of 124 
 c. As there are potentially many ways in which treatment assignment might be 
masked, e ach site will create a site-specific blinding plan to be followed 
throughout the study that specifies which staff members (or types of staff 
members) are maske d and which are not , and at what times . This blinding plan 
must be approved by [CONTACT_1592]’s participation in the study.  
d. Operational requirements of blinding are described in the Blinding Procedure 
document. Generally, active or sham drug syringes and materials will be prepared 
by [CONTACT_1593]. Once at the bedside, 
visual barriers will be put in place to block dosing equipment from view outside 
the immediate bedside area. An unmasked  dosing team will then administer active 
study drug or sham drug treatment  (for controls). At the conclusion of treatment, 
the dosing team will replace any visibly soiled  nCPAP  equipment , break down the 
dosing equipment, remove all residual active drug, remove the visual barriers, and 
transport the waste (obscured from view) for d isposal and the ADS back to 
storage.  
In order to facilitate administration of study treatment as early as possible in Part B of the study, 
study treatment will be open -label. As discussed in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and [IP_ADDRESS] , it is likely that in 
neonates 26 to 28 weeks PMA study drug will need to be administered earlier and in higher 
dosages (or with more and earlier repeat doses) than has been done in Study [ADDRESS_1404] 
of the same dos age/duration as the initial dose  (including control/sham)  and will occur if repeat 
dosing criteria are met , unless it is unsafe to do so in the judgment of the investigator . As

 described in Section 2.2.2 , repeat dosing with control/sham is ethical. Masking procedures used 
for the initial dose will be followed for repeat doses  (see Section 5.6). 
The repeat dosing criteri a for Part A of the study are defined as follows:  
a. Time: ≥2 hours from completion of the previous dose (up to 36 hours following  
randomization ) 
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]: S ubject has a sustained (≥30 minut es) need for FiO 2 above 
the qualifying FiO 2 for study enrollment  (≥0.25 for neonates 29 -32 weeks PMA, 
>0.21 for neonates 28 weeks PMA ) to maintain SpO 2 of 90% to  95%.  
As with the initial dose, the randomization system will be used to receive the study drug kit 
assignments, and all other procedures that were performed for the initial dose will be followed 
for the administration of the repeat doses.  
5.7.[ADDRESS_1405] randomized to active treatment, up to 
36 hours following randomization. Repeat doses should be administered as soon as possible 
following the previous dose . Repeat doses will be administered if repeat dosing  criteria are met , 
unless it is unsafe to do so in the judgment of the investigator . Repeat doses will be open -label.  
The repeat dosing criteri a for Part B of the study are defined as follows:  
a. Time: ≥30 minutes  from completion of the previous dose (up to 3 6 hours 
following  randomization ) 
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]: S ubject has a sustained (≥30 minutes) need for FiO 2 above

95%.  
As with the initial dose, the randomization system will be use d to receive the study drug kit 
assignments.   
5.8 Early Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
The administration of study treatment  may be discontinued at any time  prior to the completion of 
dosing  if certain device error codes occur or based on  the clinical judgment of the PI. Reasons 
for discontinuation of study treatment  include,  but are not limited to the following:  
Lucinactant for Inhalation  - CONFIDENTIAL  - Discovery Laboratories, Inc.  
Protocol  No.: 03-CL-1202   Amendment 2, 19 April 2017

 1. Device failure or malfunction  occurs , including certain error codes . If device failure or 
malfunction or error codes occur, Dis covery personnel should be contact[CONTACT_1594]  9.2.1 ).  
2. Automatic treatment interruption due to an error condition (eg, syringe pressu re out of 
range error). If error codes occur, Discovery personnel should be contact[CONTACT_1594]  9.2.1 ). 
3. An AE or ADE  which places sub ject safety at risk occurs, eg, pulmonary hemorrhage.  
4. If, in the PI’s best medical judgment, initiating or continuing the subject’s exposure to 
study treatment  is not in the best interest of the subject’s safety.  
5. Signs of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1454], as evidenced by a  clinically sig nificant  
increase in respi[INVESTIGATOR_1417] (work of breathing) plus at least one of the 
following:  
a. An FiO 2 ≥ 0.70 or a sustained increase from baseline by ≥ 0.30 to maintain SpO 2

vital signs (heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]), FiO 2, SpO 2, and PCO 2 will be recorded at the start of 
study treatment and at 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 minutes (±4 minutes) following the start of study 
treatment.  
7.[ADDRESS_1420]’s relevant medical information  will be recorded at screening , including the 
following:  
• Maternal  history, including rupture of membranes (time relative to birth, type) , presence 
of clinical chorioamnionitis, use of antenatal steroids (number of doses, time relative to 
birth)  
• Birth history, including date and time of birth, mode of delivery (vaginal, Caesarian 
section), single or multiple birth (number), Apgar score (assessed at 1 and 5 minutes of 
life), presence of congenital anomalies, birth weight in grams (Section 7.1.2 ), use of

7.3.2 Use of Caffeine Citrate or Systemic Corticos teroids  
Use of caffeine citrate or other methylxanthines is recommended and will be recorded as with 
any other concomitant medication.  
Use of prenatal steroids is permitted. Postnatal steroids are not permitted unless clear medical 
need is determined.

prongs, mask, etc.). The study nCPAP device is the specific nCPAP device and interface 
supplied for use with the ADS. Non -invasive support and non -invasive ventilation (NIV) refer to 
any device which generates a constant or variable positive pressure and uses a patient interface 
on the subject’s face. nCPAP would therefore be a form of non -invasive support or ventilation 
with a constant airway pressure, while SiPAP, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation 
(NIPPV) and IPPB would be examples  of NIV with variable pressur es. MV refers to any device 
which generates a constant or variable positive pressure via an endotracheal tube or 
tracheostomy.  Supplemental oxygen refers to delivery of oxygen without the generation of 
pressure above ambient pressure (eg, standard -flow nas al cannula). Although all forms of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1463] 2 >0.21, for this study supplemental oxygen refers only to 
modes that deliver oxygen without pressure.  
Study subjects must be maintained on study nCPAP from the time of randomization unt il at least 
[ADDRESS_1425] completed delivery of each dose of study treatment as outlined in 
Section  7.5.3 . The management of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] (includ ing nCPAP) and oxygen delivery is 
otherwise  at the discretion of the study PI , keepi[INVESTIGATOR_1464] .

 The study definition of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1411] (Section 3.2.1 ) is used for analysis 
purposes only; it is not intended to mandate or guide c linical decision making.

eCRF as such, if applicable.   
7.5.[ADDRESS_1427] 6 hours following each study treatment ; [ADDRESS_1428] is switched from study nCPAP to an alternate form of non -invasive support with in 12 
hours of dosing, the reason will be documented in the eCRF. Settings on nCPAP are left to the 
investigator’s judgment . 
Changing to a n alternate  form of nCPAP or other form of non-invasive support or ventilation in 
absence of escalating respi[INVESTIGATOR_1465], but is 
discouraged fo r a number of reasons. First, there are currently no definitive data to support that 
any form of non-invasive support or ventilation produces superior outcomes to any other form  
when used as a primary support modality . Second, each change in modality resul ts in transient 
removal of positive airway pressure from the subject, which may cause alveolar derecruit ment  
and subsequent respi[INVESTIGATOR_1428], thereby [CONTACT_1601]  a safety risk. Third, use of 
modalities other than study nCPAP may pose a disincentive to re -dose, since in order to do so 
would require changing back to study nCPAP, which carries the risk of derecruit ment  as 
described , as well as additional logistical b urden.  
The study nCPAP device and patient interface is commercially available and FDA -registered . 
On-site study and clinical staff will be trained by [CONTACT_1602] (or a qualified designee ) on the use 
of the  study  nCPAP  and interface . All local institutional p olicies and procedures relevant to the 
Lucinactant for Inhalation  - CONFIDENTIAL  - Discovery Laboratories, Inc.  
Protocol  No.: 03-CL-[ADDRESS_1429] be monitored for complications related to 
placement of the patient interface ( see Section 9).  
Procedures that may  optimize  nCPAP deliv ery include ensuring  proper placement of the patient 
interface , inserting an oro- or naso gastric tube , maintaining  the subject’s neck position in a mild 
extension that is comfortable for the subject , using pacifiers or chin strap, and suctioning the 
mouth and nose as needed .  
Initial nCPAP settings will depend on the subject’s clinical condition . Should the subject require 
increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], i ncremental increases in FiO 2 (to a maximum of 0.45) or nCPAP 
should be made by 1  cm H2O until a maximum nCPAP of 7  cm H2O is achieved. If a sustained 
nCPAP of  >8 cm H2O or FiO 2 ≥0.45 are necessary to maintain SpO 2 90 to 95% or if  
PCO 2 > 50 mm Hg, then other forms of non -invasive ventilation may be employed (see Section 
7.5.4 ). If unsuccessful , the subject should be evaluated for clinical signs and symptoms 
consistent with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1411] (Section  3.2.1 ). 
7.5.[ADDRESS_1430]  be implemented 
within 90 minutes of bir th; however, modes of support other than study nCPAP are acceptable . 
In the delivery room, intermittent positive pressure breaths may be administered manually or 
mechanically through a noninvasive patient interface ( eg, mask  or nasal prongs) for no longer 
than 10  minutes after birth (eg,  NeoPuff).  Following delivery, any mode of non -invasive 
ventilation or patient interface may be used to support respi[INVESTIGATOR_1466], 
including nasal cannula; high -flow nasal cann ula (eg, VapoTherm); nCPAP generated by [CONTACT_1603] 
(eg, bubble CPAP or RAM cannula) or mechanical ventilator and using any interface (eg, RAM 
cannula, nasal prongs, face mask, etc); bi -level positive airway pressure (eg, SiPAP, BiPAP); 
neutrally -adjusted ventila tory assistance (NAVA); non -invasive positive -pressure ventilation 
(NIPPV); etc.  
Subjects are eligible for screening if any form of non -invasive support or ventilation is instituted 
within the required time period after birth ( 90 minutes for Part A of the  study; 60 minutes for 
Part B) and the investigator feels it is safe to switch the subject to study nCPAP. After informed 
consent is obtained, subjects may be switched to study nCPAP/interface for screening. If the 
subject meets the inclusion criterion for  respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] (Inclusion Criterion #6) and meets all

 other inclusion/exclusion criteria, that subject may be enrolled.  For Part A of the study, the 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1467] [ADDRESS_1431] is stab le 
for ≥30 minutes on nCPAP of 5 -7 cm H 2O with FiO 2 0.25 (>0.21 for neonates 28 weeks PMA)

Particularly for the [ADDRESS_1433] 6 hours; [ADDRESS_1434] will remain on study nCPAP until 36 hours 
following randomization (Section 7.5.3 ). After at least [ADDRESS_1435] requires increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_1468]. Clinical judgment should be used to guide 
ventilatory management. If nCPAP has escalated to 7 cm H2O and subjects require  additional 
support, non -invasive ventilation may be an option rather than increasing nCPAP further.

 9.1.1 Causal Relationship of Adverse Events  
The relationship of an AE to a study drug is assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1477]:  
• Not related : The AE is clearly related to other factors, such as the subject’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs.  
• Unlikely Related : The AE was most likely produced by [CONTACT_1604], such as the subject’s 
clinical state, therape utic interventions, or concomitant drugs, and does not follow a 
known response pattern to the study drug.  
• Possibly Related : The AE follows a reasonable sequence from the time of drug 
administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study drug,  but could have 
been produced by [CONTACT_1604], such as the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant drugs.  
• Related : The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of the drug  
administration and meets the following criteria;  
a) Follows a known response pattern to the study drug  
b) Cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs  
c) Meets one or more of  the following:  
• occurs immediately following study drug administration  
• improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1478]  
• reappears on repeat exposure  
• there is a positive reaction at the application site  
9.1.2 Severity Grade Levels of Adverse Events  
The severity of an AE is assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1477]:  
• Mild : Symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual social and functional 
activities  
• Moderate : Symptoms causing greater than minimal interference with usual social and 
functional activities  
• Severe: Symptoms causing inability to perform usual social and functional activities  
9.1.3 Adverse Event Procedures  
All AEs are to be assessed in all subjects throughout the study period (from enrollment to study 
withdrawal or completion) and documented in the stu dy eCRF. Each AE should be reported 
Lucinactant for Inhalation  - CONFIDENTIAL  - Discovery Laboratories, Inc.  
Protocol  No.: 03-CL-1202   Amendment 2, 19 April 2017  
 
 
Page 95 of 124 
 spontaneously or in response to general, non -directed discussion with the attending nurse or 
physician (eg, has there been any change in subject status since the last assessment period?). For 
each AE, the investigator sh ould obtain all information required to complete the AE page of the 
eCRF, in accordance with eCRF completion guidelines (provided separately by [CONTACT_1602]).  
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or relationship to study participation, must be 
record ed (using medical terminology) in the source document and on the AE page of the eCRF. 
Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common 
etiology.  
All AEs must be followed until resolution or until a stable clinical en d-point is reached, or for at 
least [ADDRESS_1446]’s last day in the study if an AE is ongoing at the time the subject 
completes the study. All measures required for AE management and the ultimate outcome of the 
AE must be recorded in the source  document and reported on the AE page of the eCRF.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_1447] medical occurrence that, at any dose , meets one of the following criteria 
(ICH E2A, Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting ): 
1. Results in death  
2. Is life -threatening  
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
6. May be considered serious when based upon appropriate medical judgment  
When the investigator -trained designee becomes aware of an SAE, Discovery must be notified as 
soon as possible (and no later than 24 hours after the event has occurred) via telephone or fax, 
regardless of the relatio nship (or lack thereof) of the SAE to study participation.  
SAEs can be reported to the Discovery SAE reporting line, by [CONTACT_1606] (see Section 9.2).

 12.3 Financial Disclosure  
The FDA has issued regulations (21  CFR  Part 54, Financial Disclosure by [CONTACT_1615] ) that require sponsors to  submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure 
statements to certify the absence of certain financial interests of clinical investigators and/or to 
disclose those financial interests, as required, when clinical studies are submitted to FDA in 
support of marketing approval. These regulations are intended to ensure that financial interests 
and arrangements of clinical investigators, that could affect reliability of data submitted to FDA 
in support of marketing approval, are identified and disclosed  by [CONTACT_456].  
Clinical investigators will be asked to disclose proprietary (eg, patent, licensing agreement) and 
financial (eg, stock options, royalty) interests as they pertain to Discovery, before participating in 
the study. In addition, clinical inve stigators will be required to consult with Discovery before 
acquiring any financial interest in the company and must disclose any change in their proprietary 
or financial interests, if it occurs during the course of the study and for [ADDRESS_1456] of the clinical investigator.  
If FDA determines that the financial interests of any clinical investigator raise serious  questions 
about the integrity of the data, FDA will take any action it deems necessary to ensure the 
reliability of the data, including:  
1. Initiating agency audits of the data derived from the clinical investigator in question  
2. Requesting that the sponsor su bmit further data analyses (eg, to evaluate the effect of the 
clinical investigator’s data on overall study outcome)  
3. Requesting that the applicant conduct additional independent studies to confirm the results 
of the questioned study  
4. Refusing to treat the c overed clinical study as providing data that can be the basis for an 
agency action  
If the sponsor does not include certification or disclosure, or both (as required), or does not 
certify that it was not possible to obtain the information, the FDA may refus e to file the New 
Drug Application (NDA).

 13 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF  SAMPLE SIZE  
It is anticipated that up to  240 subjects ( up to 80 per treatment group) will be enrolled into the 
study  in Part A, and up to 80 subjects (up to 40 per treatment group) will be enrolled into the 
study in Part B .  
A complete outline of the all planned analyses for the study, including the handling of missing 
data, is provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan  for this protocol . 
13.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
The statistical analysis of both the primary and secondary objectives will be based on all enrolled 
preterm neonates. For the efficacy analysis, all randomized subjects (intent -to-treat [ITT]) and 
subject s with no major protocol deviations (per -protocol) will be evaluated, based upon the 
treatment group to which they were randomized. For the safety analysis, all control subjects and 
subjects who received any amount of aerosolized lucinactant will be evalua ted, based upon the 
treatment they actually received.  All analyses will be performed for Parts A and B  of the study 
for all subjects combined  by [CONTACT_1616] (for Part A only) . 
All continuous variables (eg, weight, body temperatur e, transcutaneous PCO 2) will be 
summarized using number (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and 
maximum. All discrete variables (eg, sex, AEs, common complications of prematurity), will be 
summarized using frequency (n) and percent. Sites will be pooled for statistical analyses by 
[CONTACT_1617].  
The primary endpoint (the incidence of  respi[INVESTIGATOR_1486] 72 hours 
of life ) is defined in Section  3.2.[ADDRESS_1457] . BPD, all -cause mortality, and 
common complications of prematurity (primarily air leak) will be compared using the Cochran -
Mantel Haenszel test. Physiologic parameters (ie, FiO 2, transcutaneous PCO 2) will be compared 
using ANOVA with treatment and pooled study site in the model.

Protocol  No.: 03-CL-1202   Amendment 2, 19 April 2017  
 
 
Page 106 of 124 
 The treatment difference (de lta) between active and control treatments will be calculated for the 
primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. The delta calculated will be used to plan 
additional studies and as supporting evidence of efficacy.  
Demographic parameters will be summariz ed by [CONTACT_1618]. Concomitant medications will be classified using the 
WhoDrug dictionary and summarized using frequency and percent.  
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1619], but will not be 
compared statistically. Physical examination and medical history will similarly be summarized. 
Vital signs (ie, body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], pulse) will be summarized as for continuous 
variables; vital signs will not  be compared statistically.  
13.2 Interim Analyses  
The data monitoring committee (DMC) will conduct 2 preplanned interim analyses  during Part A 
of the study : 1) after approximately 25% of subjects have been enrolled and 2) after 66% of 
subjects have been enrolle d. The DMC will be provided full safety listings for review after 50% 
of subjects have been enrolled in Part B, but will not conduct a formal interim analysis. Study 
enrollment may be suspended if safety concerns are identified during any review (see Secti on 6).  
In addition, a review of the treatment effect may be conducted by [CONTACT_1620] (ISAC) after approximately 50% of the subjects have been enrolled  in Part A . 
The ISAC will assess the time and incidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1488]. These results will be used to determine if adjustments to the doses being studied should 
be co nsidered. The p-values may or may not be adjusted, as appropriate.  
13.3 Sample Size and Randomization  
A total of up to 240 study subjects ( up to 80 per treatment group) will be enrolled  in Part A of 
the study, and a total of up to 80 study subjects (up to 40 pe r treatment group) in Part B . For Part 
A, the sample sizes were calculated separately for incidence of  respi[INVESTIGATOR_1489] , time to  respi[INVESTIGATOR_1405], and a reduction in FiO 2. The sample size 
will have 90% power to  detect the difference between treatment groups using a log -rank test for 
equality of time to event curves, assuming a constant hazard rati o of 0.500, within the first 
[ADDRESS_1458] a re duction of 50% 
in the incidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1490] 72  hours  of life , or a reduction

 in FiO 2 of 4 percentage points (eg,  30% to 26%) within the first 24  hours following treatment  
(nQuery Advisor®, version 7.0) .  
In addition, the sample size is sufficient to provide a stable estimate of the size of the treatment 
effect (treatment delta). The efficacy estimate will be used to calculate the sample size for future 
studies.  
For Part B, formal sample size calculations have  not been conducted . A total of [ADDRESS_1459].    
Efficacy and safety  will be assess ed for each part separately and for all subjects combined.

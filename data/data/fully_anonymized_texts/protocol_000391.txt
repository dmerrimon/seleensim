Protocol N umber:   INCB [ZIP_CODE]-205 Study Phase:   2 
Indication:   Relapsed or r efrac tory m antle c ell lymphoma  
 
Objectives  Endpoints  
Primary  
To assess the efficacy of INCB050465 
in terms of objective response rate (ORR) in subjects with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) that is relapsed or refractory after at least 1 but no more 
than 3 prior systemic treatment regimens.  ORR defined as the percentage of subjects with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by i ndependent review 
committee (IRC) assessment of response according to computed 
tomography ( CT)-based response cr iteria for lymphomas . 
Secondary  
To assess duration of response (DOR).  DOR defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death from any cause among subjects who achieve an objective response, as determined by [CONTACT_147078]. 
To assess complete response rate (CRR).  CRR defined as the percentage of subjects with a CR as defined by [CONTACT_445279].  
To assess progression -free survival 
(PFS). PFS defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study treatment until the earliest date of disease progression, as determined by [CONTACT_147078], or death from any cause.  
To assess overall survival (OS).  Overall survival defined as the time from the date of the first dose of 
study treatment until death from any cause.  
To assess the best percentage change in target lesion size.  Best percentage change in target lesion size from baseline, where target lesion size is measured by [CONTACT_445280].  
To characterize the safety and tolerability of INCB050465.  Safety measured by [CONTACT_20721] (AEs), 12 -lead electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), chemistry and hematology laboratory values, vital signs, and 
physical examinations.

CONFIDENTIAL   
Overall Study Design:   This is a Phase 2, open -label, 2-cohort study designed to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety  of 2 INCB050465 trea tment regimens in  relapsed or refractory MC L previously treated either 
with or without a Bruton 's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor.  Subjects will be allocated to Cohort 1 or 
Cohort 2 as follows:  
• Cohort 1:  Subjects  have previously received  ibrutinib   
• Cohor t 2:  Subjects  have not previously received  a BTK inhibitor  
Cohort [ADDRESS_566397], and analyses. 
Subjects in Cohort 1 (n  = 60) and Cohort 2 (n = 60) will be randomly allocated to one  of 2 study 
treatment regimens as fol lows:  
• Treatment A:  INCB050465 20 mg once daily (QD) for 8 weeks followed by 20 mg once weekly 
• Treatment B:  INCB050465 [ADDRESS_566398] been 
treated and eval uated for response or permanently discontinued study treatment because of disease 
progression, withdrawal of consent, or death.  Cohort 1 will be terminated for futility if ≤ [ADDRESS_566399] responded (ie, CR or PR) based on assessments provided by [CONTACT_26732].  Cohort 2 will be terminated for futility if ≤ [ADDRESS_566400] responded (ie, CR or PR) based on assessments 
provided by [CONTACT_26732].  A timely assessment of response will be performed to avoid the risk of 
overenrollment.  Safety will be  evaluated by [CONTACT_223233] (IDMC). 
To better understand the safety and efficacy of INCB050465, a total of 70 additional subjects (30 subjects 
in Cohort 1 and 40 subjects in Cohort 2) will be enrolled into one of the 2 treatment regimens (A or B) 
being evaluated in this study.  The treatment regimen will be selected after enrollment is completed for 
either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 (ie, 60 subjects enrolled) and after evaluation of emerging safety and efficacy 
data from this and other monotherapy studies of INCB050465 in NHL.  Once a treatment regimen is 
selected, the non -selected treatment regimen will be closed to further enrollment.  Subjects receiving the 
non-selected treatment regimen may switch to the selected treatment regimen or  remain on their current 
treatment regimen, provided they have not met study treatment withdrawal criteria, and there are no safety concerns for their current treatment regimen.  T here will be no re- baselining for subjects who 
switch treatment regimens, and all subjects will continue to follow the same assessment schedule.  
Cohort 1 will be closed to further enrollment by [CONTACT_118229] 7.  Subjects already enrolled in 
Cohort 1 will continue to receive study treatment per protocol.

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 205 Am 7 Version 7  30 JAN 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  Estimated Duration of Participation:   Subject participation from screening through follow -up is 
expected to average approximately 26 months , which includes the following:  
• A screening period lasting up to 28 days. 
• A treatment period lasting as long as the subject is receiving benefit, tolerating the regimen, and has not 
met withdrawal criteria (approximately 14 months). 
• A safety follow-up period lasting 30 to 35 days. 
• A disease and survival follow -up period until the end of the study. 
At the end of the study, s ubjects who have completed at least 24 months of study participation (starting 
from first dose of INCB050465), who remain on active study treatment, and who have no evidence of 
progressive disease will have the option to continue on monotherapy with INCB050465 provided within a 
rollover Protocol, as local law permits.  
Estimated Number of Subjects:   Approximately 190 subjects were planned to be enrolled and allocated 
to either Cohort 1 (received prior ibrutinib; n  = 60-90) or Cohort 2 (have not rece ived prior BTK 
inhibitor; n = 60-100).  Cohort 1 will be closed to further enrollment by [CONTACT_118229] 7 with 
approximately 50 subjects enrolled.  The estimated total number of subjects to be enrolled in the study is 
approximately 150. 
Principal Coor dinating Investigator:  
United S tates:  , MD, , [LOCATION_003]  
EU:  , MD, , Italy 
Statistical Methods:  Data from Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will be analyzed separatel y.  There will not be any 
statistical comparison between Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, and there will not be multi plicity adjustment 
between the cohorts. 
Sample Size:  
• Cohort 1:  up to 90 subjects were planned to be enrolled.  If the true ORR is 28%, then there is 
approximately 90% or 96% probability of observing the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval 
(CI) of ORR ≥  12% with 60 or 90 subjects, respectively .  Cohort 1 will be closed to further enrollment 
with Protocol Amendment 7. 
• Cohort 2:   up to 100 subjects will be enrolled.  If th e true ORR is 60% , then there is approximately  90% 
or 97 % probability of observing the lower bound of the 95% CI of ORR ≥ 40%  with 60 or 100 subjects, 
respectively . 
Primary Analysis:   For each of the 2 cohorts, the ORR as determined by [CONTACT_147082] 95% exact 
binomial CIs will be calculated . 
Secondary Analyses:  For each of the 2 cohorts, the Kaplan- Meier estimation of median DOR , PFS (per 
IRC) , and OS will be presented with respective 95% CIs.  Complete response rate as determined by [CONTACT_445281] 95% exact binomial CIs  will be calculated.  Best percentage change in target lesion size from 
baseline will be summarized descriptively.   All safety data, including AEs, laboratory data, vital signs, 
and ECGs, will be summarized descriptively.  
Level of Signifi cance:   There will not be any stat istical comparison between the 2 cohorts.  Within each 
of the 2 cohorts, 2-sided 95% CIs will be reported for all analyses when appropriate. 
Interim Analysis:   An interim futility analysis is planned for each of the cohort s when [ADDRESS_566401] permanently discontinued study treatment because of 
disea se progression, withdrawal of consent, or death.  Cohort 1 will be terminated for futility if ≤ 3 of the 
30 subjects responded (ie, CR or PR) based on assessments provided by [CONTACT_26732].  Cohort 2 will be 
terminated for futility if ≤ 10 of the 30 subjects res ponded (ie, CR or PR) based on assessments provided 
by [CONTACT_26732].  
Data Monitoring Committee:   An IDMC will be established and will review data at predetermined 
intervals as specified in the IDMC charter.

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_566407] common hematologic malignancy, with over 385,000 new 
cases diagnosed in 2012 ( Torre  et al 2015).  Incidence rates of NHL tend to be higher in North 
America, Western Europe, Northern Europe, and Australia compared with the rest of the world; 
it has been estimated that over 80,000 new cases of NHL and approximately 20,000 deaths due to NHL occurred in the [LOCATION_002] in 2015 ( Siegel  et al 2015).  Between 1975 and 2010 the 
incidence of new cases of NHL in the [LOCATION_002] has nearly doubled from 11.1 to 20.3 cases per 100,000 people, but the proportion of deaths has slowly decreased ( NCI 2017 ). 
Mantle cell lymphoma accounts for approximately 3% to 6% of all NHL cases 
(Cheah  et al 2016) in Western countries.  Approximately 3 of 4 pat ients are male, and the disease 
occurs approximately twice as frequently in Caucasians as compared with Blacks.  The median 
age at diagnosis is 68 years old ( Schulz et al 2007).  The most common form of MCL, referred to 
as Classi cal MCL, is genetically characterized by [CONTACT_445282] t(11;14)(q13;q32) 
(abbreviated as t(11;14)) that leads to the overexpression of CCND1, which drives tumor growth and division ( Campo  et al 2015).  Classical MCL  is derived from mature B cells that carry no or 
few somatic mutations in the IGHV and express SOX11, a transcription factor.  Classical MCL is more aggressive than the less common form of MCL, which contains IGHV with somatic hypermutations and expresses SOX11at very low levels or not at all.  This subtype of MCL can 
become more aggressive with additional mutations in genes such as TP53 ( Campo  et al 2015).  
The median OS  time for treated patients is approximately  8 to 10 years.  C urrently available 
treatments are not considered curative ( Schulz et al 2007); therefore, an unmet medical need 
exists for patients with MCL .  
1.2. Treatment for Mantle Cell Lymphoma  
Most pati ents with MCL  (70% ) have advanced stage di sease at diagnosis ( Argatoff  et al 1997).  
There is currently no method to guide treatment, but the MIPI [INVESTIGATOR_445269]-adapted treatment ( Hoster  et al 2008; see Appendix D ).  The MIPI [INVESTIGATOR_445270] 
4 factors:  age, performance status, LDH levels, and leukocyte count.  Additional prognostic 
factors evaluated include Ki -67, gene expression profiling, MRD, MCL cell type, peripheral 
blood AMC at diagnosis, and beta2- microglobulin level ( LLS 2014 ). 
Multiple approaches are used in the first- line treatment for MCL , but treatment typi[INVESTIGATOR_445271] (ie, chemoimmunotherapy).  Treatment options include 
conventional chemoimmunotherapy alone or followed by [CONTACT_164383]; conventional 
chemoimmunotherapy followed by [CONTACT_5019]-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematological cell transplant; intensive chemoimmunotherapy; and conventional chemoimmunotherapy plus 
involved-field radiation therapy.  Unfortunately, none of these modalities is curative 
(Cheah  et al 2016).  
Most patients will experience serial relapse and can use any number of approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_445272].  The best order of treatment for these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_445273], and choice of therapy will depend on a number of factors, including prior treatment, 
Incyte Corporation  Page 15 of 82 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 205 Am 7 Version 7  30 JAN 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  patient comorbidities and performance status, and expected  toxicities .  In the [LOCATION_002], 
approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_445274], lenalidomide, and bortezomib.  Ibrutinib 
(Wang  et al 2013), lenalidomide ( Goy et al 2013), and bortezomib ( Fisher  et al 2006) received 
accelerated approval based on the ORR s observed in single-arm, Phase 2 studies; bortezomib (in 
combination with chemotherapy) was also approved in a randomized Phase 3 study of previously 
untreated subjects with MCL  (Robak et al 2015).  In the EU, ibrutinib, lenalidomide, and 
temsirolimus ( Hess  et al 2009) are approved for adult subjects with relapsed or refractory MCL ; 
bortezomib (in combination with chemotherapy) is approved for treatment of adult patients with previously untreated MCL  who are unsuitable for hematopoietic SCT. 
The Phase [ADDRESS_566408] 1 pr ior therapy.  This study enrolled 
111 subjects and demonstrated a 68% response rate and a median PFS of 13.9 months; 47% of 
subjects were alive at 2 years ( Wang  et al 2015).  Similar results were observed in a second study 
(Wang  et al 2014).  Ibrutinib is currently being evaluated in a Phase [ADDRESS_566409] line in 
combination with bendamustine and rituximab. 
1.3. INCB050465 
Phosphatidylinositol 3- kinases belong to a family of lipid signaling kinases th at phosphorylate 
phosphoinositides of the inositol ring ( Cantley  et al 2002).  Phosphatidylinositol 3- kinases are 
divided into 3 classes (Class I, II, and III) according to their structure, regulation, and substrate specificity.   Class I PI3Ks, which include PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, PI3Kγ, and PI3Kδ, are dual -specificity 
lipid and protein kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, giving rise to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate.  Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate functions as a second messenger that controls a number of cellular processes, 
including growth, survival, adhesion, and migration.  The recognition that aberrant signal 
transduction occurs in malignant B-lymphocytes via the PI3K pathways resulting in disease progression has led to a focus on agents that modulate these signaling pathways.   
INCB050465 is a potent inhibitor of PI3Kδ (IC
50 value = 1.1 ± 0.5 nM), with approximately 
20,000-fold selectivity for the other PI3K family members.  INCB050465 does not significantly 
inhibit (< 30% inhibition) a broad panel of kinases when tested at a concentration of 100 nM 
(refer to the Investigator's Brochure [ IB]).  INCB050465 is potent (IC 50 values of ≤ 10 nM) in 
cell-based assays relevant to the pathogenesis of B -cell malignancies, such as PI3Kδ -mediated 
signaling and growth of human B- cell lines.  This effect is not due to general cytotoxicity.  
Compared with inhibition of B-cell proliferation, INCB050465 is similarly potent in blocking 
helper T -cell differentiation but is > [ADDRESS_566410] of INCB050465 on the human immune system will largely be restricted to B- cell and 
helper T -cell differentiation ( IB).  The IC 90 for pAKT inhibition of Pfeiffer cells in human whole 
blood is 77 nM ( IB).  Preclinical toxicology studies supported evaluation of INCB050465 in 
human clinical studies ( IB). 
INCB050465 is being evaluated as a monotherapy in a Phase 1/2, dose-escalation and expansion 
study (INCB [ZIP_CODE]-101, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  As of 18 AUG 2017, data were available for 
72 subjects who received INCB050465 administered orally at QD doses of 5 mg (n = 1), 10 mg 
(n = 3), 15 mg (n = 3), 20 mg (n = 34), 30 mg (n = 27), and 45 mg (n = 4).  The median duration 
Incyte Corporation  Page 16 of 82 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 205 Am 7 Version 7  30 JAN 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  of treatment was 123 days (range:  7-690 ).  Adverse events observed in ≥ 20% of subjects were 
nausea (36%), diarrhea (35%), fatigue (31%), cough (24%), and vomiting ( 24%).  New or 
worsening Grade ≥  3 anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia occurred in 7%, 10%, and 19% 
of subjects, respectively.  No Grade ≥  3 nonhematological treatment- related AEs were reported 
in ≥ 10% of subjects.  Serious AEs that occurred in ≥  2 subjects included diarrhea (n  = 5) ; 
pyrexia (n  = 4); colitis, hypotension, and sepsis (n = 3 each) ; pneumonia, exfoliative dermatitis, 
syncope, bacteremia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], bronchitis, urinary tract infection, and ventricular 
tachycardia (n  = 2 each).  Fourteen  (19%) of the 72  subjects discontinued study treatment due to 
the following 14 AEs:  diarrhea (n = 3) ; exfoliative dermatitis  and colitis (n  = 2 each ); 
pneumonitis, rash, psoriasis, neutropenia, cytomegalovirus colitis, pleural eff usion, and 
hypercalcemia (n  = 1 each).  All but [ADDRESS_566411] abnormalities Grade >  1 were reported while subjects were 
receiving study treatment.  No dose- limiting toxicities were identified, and the maximum 
tolerated dose was not reached.  
As of 18 AUG 2017, 30 objective responses as reported by [CONTACT_445283] 
≥ 10 mg QD in 55 subjects with diffuse large B -cell lymphoma , FL, marginal zone lymphoma, 
and MCL .  The se results include 3 CR/CMR, 1 PR/ PMR , and [ADDRESS_566412] inhibition at all dose levels tested ( Phillips  et al 2016).  Refer to the IB for 
further details.  
1.4. Study Rationale  
Multiple agents have been approved i n the [LOCATION_002] and the EU for the treatment of mantle 
cell lymphoma.  One of these agents, ibrutinib, is currently being evaluated in the first line in combination with bendamustine and rituximab, which could potentially create a relatively large population of subjects who have received ibrutinib.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_445275] a targeted agent, a retrospective study conducted on 114 patients treated with 
ibrutinib showed a median OS  after cessation of ibrutinib of 2.9 months (95% CI, 1.6-4.9).  The 
poor outcome for patients treated with ibrutinib demonstrates the need for new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_445276]- ibrutinib setting ( Martin  et al 2016).  INCB050465 has demonstrated promising activity in 
relapsed or refractor y subjects with MCL  (see Section  1.3).  This study will evaluate 
INCB050465 for efficacy and safety in subjects with MCL  who were previously treated with

assessment (9 weeks).   However , among all evaluable subjects  with an objective response 
(n = 20), 7 subjects (35%) discontinued study treatment due to an AE.  Consequently, after 
receiving 20 mg QD of INCB050465 for 8 weeks, subjects will receive either 20 mg once weekly (Treatment A) or 2.5  mg Q D (Treatment B) of INCB050465. 
The [ADDRESS_566414] inhibition, which may reduce the frequency of AEs leading to study treatment withdrawal .  Pharmacodynamic data from Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-101 showed that a single dose of 
20 mg exhibited maximal inhibition of AKT in an ex vivo  pharmacodynamic assay, and PK 
modeling suggests that 20 mg once weekly will 1) achieve maximal inhibition equivalent to approximately 10 × IC
90, 2) exceed the IC 90 for approximately 36 hours, and 3) have minimal to 
no inhibition for approximately half the dosing interval.  This once- weekly regimen is similar to 
that of another PI3K inhibitor (copanlisib), which is administered IV on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 
28-day cycle and achieved 7 objective responses in 9 subjects with NHL  (Patnaik  et al 2016).   
Among the 51 subjects who received study treatment , 4 discontinued treatment due to an AE.  
There were 2 events of Grade 3 noninfectious pneumonitis, 1 event of Grade 3 diarrhea, and no events of colitis.  
The 2.5 mg QD regimen is proposed to provide enough exposure (estimated to be approximately 
1 × IC
90 at peak) to maintain PI3K pathway inhibition but reduce the frequency of AEs that lead 
to study treatment withdrawal.  The continuous QD regimen has demonstrated prolonged 
responses in both aggressive and indolent NHL, and a continuous lower dose will be evaluated in 
this study.   One subject with FL who received a 10 mg QD dose achieved a complete metabolic 
response and remained on study treatment for approximately 13 months before withdrawing due 
to an AE (Grade 2 psoriasis). 
1.5. Potential Risks and Benefits of the Treatment Regimen  
INCB050465 has effects on the immune system.  Therefore, subjects in this study will be monitored closely for evidence of infections or new cancers, and study treatment administration will be discontinued if there is evidence of clinically significant infection or new cancer.  
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia has not been reported with the use of INCB050465 as monotherapy.  However, PJP was reported for [ADDRESS_566415] administered INCB050465 in combination with pembrolizumab in Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-107 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  All s ubjects in 
Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_566416] PJ P prophylaxis with sulfonamide antibiotics will 
receive either inhaled pentamidine or atovaquone for PJP prophylaxis; these subjects will not be given dapsone.

CONFIDENTIAL  As presented in  Section  1.3, objective responses were reported in 30 of 55 NHL subjects, 
including 6 responses in 9 MCL subjects.  Adverse events were also observed in subjects 
administered INCB050465 (see Section  1.3).  Dose modification guidance and supportive care 
guidelines for diarrhea/colitis are implemented in this study.  INCB050465 monotherapy has also demonstrated efficacy in multiple tumor types including MCL (see Section  1.3). 
Based on safety and efficacy  data from t he ongoing Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-101, the treatment 
regimen for this study  will be [ADDRESS_566417] inhibition and maintenance of response. 
INCB050465 is metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097] 3A4; therefore, use of any potent CYP3A4 
inhibitors or inducers within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of 
INCB050465 will be prohibited. 
The effects of INCB050465 on fetal development have not been evaluated, nor is it known 
whether INCB050465 passes into human breast milk; therefore, subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding are excluded from participation in this study. 
There are no preclinical data available to date on the potential phototo xicity of INCB050465.  
Therefore, subjects enrolled in this study taking INCB050465 will be instructed by [CONTACT_445284]/ultraviolet light.  This includes wearing long sleeves, long trousers, hats, suns creen, and sunglasses.

4. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
4.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 2, open-label, 2-cohort study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
2 INCB 050465 treatment regimens in relap sed or refractory MC L previously treated either with 
or without a BTK inhibitor (see Figure  1).  A total of approximately [ADDRESS_566428] 1 but no more than 3 prior systemic treatment 
regimens  will be screened for eligibility.  Subjects will be allocated to Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 as 
follows: 
• Cohort 1:  Subjects  have previously received ibrutinib  
• Cohort 2:  Subjects  have not previously received a BTK i nhibitor  
Cohort [ADDRESS_566429] 60 subjects in each cohort who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly allocated to 
1 of 2 study treatment regimens through the IWRS  (see Section  5.1):  
• Treatment A:  INCB050465 20 mg QD for 8 weeks followed by 20 mg once weekly 
− Subject s in Cohort 1 receiving Treatment A will be referred to as Cohort 1A 
− Subject s in Cohort 2 receiving Treatment A will be referred to as Cohort 2A 
• Treatment B:  INCB050465 20 mg QD for 8 weeks followed by 2.5 mg QD 
− Subject s in Cohort 1 receiving Treatment B will be referred to as Cohort 1B 
− Subject s in Cohort 2 receiving Treatment B will be referred to as Cohort 2B 
To better understand the safety and efficacy of INCB050465, a total of 70 additional subjects 
(30 subjects in Cohort 1 and 40 subjects in Cohort 2) will be enrolled into one of the 2 treatment 
regimens (A or B) being evaluated in this s tudy.   The treatment regimen will be selecte d after 
enrollment is completed for either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 (ie, 60 subjects enrolled) and after evaluation of emerging safety and efficacy data from this and other monotherapy studies of 
INCB050465 in NHL.  Once a treatment regimen is selected, the nonselected treatment regimen 
will be closed to further enrollment.  Subjects receiving the nonselected treatment regimen may 
Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_566430] not met study treatment wi thdrawal criteria , and there are no safety concerns for their 
current treatment regimen.  There will be no re- baselining for subjects who switch treatment 
regimens , and al l subjects will continue to follow the same assessment schedule . 
NOTE:   The primary, secondary,  objectives and endpoints described in 
Section  2 are applicable for  both cohorts; however, the cohorts will be analyzed separately, when 
applicable, as detailed in Section  9. 
Subjects will receive treatment until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or consent 
withdrawal, whichever occurs first . 
Subjects will be monitored for safety and efficacy periodically until disease progression, death, 
unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of informed consent.  An IDMC will review safety data 
periodically as stated in the IDMC charter.  Subjects will be evaluated for ORR by [CONTACT_26708] , and 
followed for DOR, PFS, and OS.  
An interim futility analysis  is planned for each of the cohorts when [ADDRESS_566431] permanently discontinued study treatment because 
of disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or death.  Cohort 1 will be terminated for f utility 
if ≤ 3 of the 30 subjects responded (ie, CR or PR) based on assessments provided by [CONTACT_26732].  Cohort 2 will be terminated for futility if ≤ [ADDRESS_566432] resp onded ( ie, CR or PR) 
based on assessments provided by [CONTACT_26732].  A timely assessment of response will be performed to avoid the risk of overenrollment. 
The IDMC determined that the futility boundary was not crossed at the interim analysis of 
Cohort [ADDRESS_566433] treated .

4.2. Measures Taken to Avoid Bias  
This is an open- label study; no comparisons will be made between subjects or against historical 
controls.  Measurements of safety and efficacy are objective measurements, and only 
comparisons to pretreatment conditions will be made.  Safety will be objectively assessed using 
NCI CTCAE v4.03 ( NCI 2010) guidelines  and reviewed by [CONTACT_31849].  Tumor response will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_445288]- based criteria of the Lugano classification ( Cheson et al 2014). 
4.3. Number of Subjects  
4.3.1. Planned Number of Subjects  
The study was  planned to enroll approximately [ADDRESS_566434] will enter the  
survival follow-up period (see Section  6.4.3).  Subject participation is expected to average 
approximately [ADDRESS_566435] discontinued from the study (see Section  5.7) or  have completed at least  24 months 
of study participation (starting from the first dose of study treatment) .  It is estimated  that the 
study will take approximately [ADDRESS_566436] the option to continue on monotherapy with 
INCB050465 provided within a rollover Protocol , as local law permits (see Section  5.8).  
4.6. Study Termination  
The investigator retains the right to terminate study participation at any time  for appropriate 
medical or organizational reasons.  The i nvestigator is to notify the institutional review board 
(IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC)  in writing of the study 's completion or early 
termination, send a copy of the notification to the sponsor or sponsor's designee, and retain 1 copy for the site study regulatory file.  
The sponsor may te rminate the study electively, if  required by a regulatory decision, or upon 
advice of  the IDMC.  If the study is terminated prematurely, the sponsor will notify the 
investigators, the IRBs and IECs, and regulatory bodies of the decision and reason for termination of the study.  The IDMC will recommend termination of the study if warra nted, as 
described in  the IDMC c harter (see also Section  9.5).  
Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_566437] numbers will be 6 digits; the first [ADDRESS_566438]'s number.  This subject number will be maintained throughout the study and will not be reassigned.  Subjects who withdraw consent or discontinue from the study after being assigned a subject number will retain their initial number.  
Site staff will contact [CONTACT_445289].  The investigator or designee will select the assigned bottles 
of study treatment from their stock that correspond to the number provided by [CONTACT_147094].  All subsequent dispensing of study treatment should follow this process.  Refer to the IWRS Manual for detailed information. 
If a subject is mistakenly given a bottle of study treatment that is not the bottle assigned by [CONTACT_129212], the IWRS help desk must be notified immediately.  The reason for the misallocation of the study treatment must be documented by [CONTACT_147095]/IEC. 
For subjects who signed an ICF but are not allocated study treatment and for subjects who are 
allocated study  treatment but were not treated , refer to the eCRF Completion Guidelines for 
instruction on which eCRFs to complete.

substituted via IV infusion.  Subjects should try to eat 5 to 6 small meals per day; low-fat, high 
protein foods; and cooked instead of raw vegetables.  Subjects may supplement their diet with bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast to reduce the number of bowel movements and may also try 
crackers, gelatin, noodles, or oatmeal.  Subjects should avoid fried, fatty, greasy, or spi[INVESTIGATOR_84716]; 
milk, milk products, and acidic drinks; high-fiber foods and foods that cause gas; and alcohol, caffeine, and herbal supp lements ( Coutré et al 2015 ). 
For each occurrence, attempts should be made to rule out other causes, such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection (including CMV), which might require additional supportive care. 
It ma y be necessary to perform conditional procedures, such as colonoscopy with biopsy as part 
of evaluation of the event.  Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as 
symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. 
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, 
abdominal pain or crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel 
perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus). 
Table 5: Guidelines for Dose Modification of INCB050465 for Diarrhea/Colitis 
ADVERSE EVENT  ACTION TAKEN  
• Diarrhea (Grade 1).  Step 1:   Treat with antimotility agents (eg, 4 mg loperamide followed by 2  mg 
every 4 hours or after every unformed stool) and  initiate supportive care (see 
Section  5.4.2 ).  Monitor approximately every 48 hours until resolved.  If not 
improved after 48 hours, treat per guidance for Grade 2.  
• Diarrhea (Grade 2).  Step 1:   Interrupt INCB05 0465.  Perform work- up for infection (including 
CMV, C. difficile , etc) immediately.  Initiate or continue supportive care (see 
Section  5.4.2 ).  Monitor approximately every 48 hours until resolution.  
Step 2:   If improved within 48 hours and/or infection* is confirmed, restart 
INCB050465 at the same schedule and dose  after resolved to ≤  Grade 1 and 
continue to monitor.  
*For infectious diarrhea/colitis, follow institutional standard -of-care 
guidelines and restart IN CB050465 according to clinical judgement after 
resolved to ≤  Grade 1.  Consult with medical monitor if needed.  
Step 3:   If not improved within 48 hours and infection is ruled out, start oral 
steroids, or consider IV steroids if participant is being given I V fluids.  If no 
improvement with oral steroids, switch to IV steroids.  
Step 4:   When diarrhea resolves to ≤ Grade 1, continue supportive care and 
taper steroids according to institutional standard of care.  When taper is 
complete (eg, no steroid or ≤  10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) and 
diarrhea is ≤ Grade 1, restart INCB050465 at the next lower dose with 
approval of the medical monitor ( see Table  4 for dose levels).  
Step 5:   If Grade 2 diarrhea reoccurs, treat per guidance for diarrhea 
(≥ Grade  3)/noninfectious colitis.  
Step 6:   If ≥  Grade [ADDRESS_566442] time, permanently discontinue 
INCB050465.

a Diarrhea accompanied by [CONTACT_147098]/or mucus or blood in stool . 
5.4.3. Supportive Care Guidelines for Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia  
Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia appear to be PI3Kδ class -effect toxicities.  Investigators 
should ensure that subjects understand the need to seek medical care when they have conditions 
that could become life-threatening in the presence of cytop enias (eg,  neutropenic fever  or 
bleed ing with low platelets) .  Subjects  should be instructed to report immediately any signs of 
infection, unexpected bleeding, or sudden, extremely painful headaches.  
5.4.4. Definition for Immune -Related Adverse Events  
Adverse events of a potential immunologic e tiology, or irAEs, may be defined as an AE 
consistent with an immune phenomenon associated with study treatment exposure after all other etiologies have been eliminated.  Immune -related AEs may be expected based on previous 
experience with INCB050465.  Special attention should be paid to AEs that may be suggestive of 
potential irAEs.  Based on emerging data from the ongoing Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-101, most irAEs 
occur after the first [ADDRESS_566443]  be withdrawn from study treatment for any 1  of following reasons: 
• The subject has experienced an unacceptable toxicity defined as follows: 
− Occurrence of an AE that is related to study treatment that, in the judgment of the 
investigator or the sponsor's medical monitor, compromises the subject' s ability to 
continue study- specific procedures or is considered to not be in the subject's best 
interest.  
− Persistent AE requiring a delay of therapy for more than 2 weeks (14 days) unless 
a greater delay has been approved by [CONTACT_456].  
• The subject is unable to tolerate study treatment.  
• The subject has an objective radiographic tumor response of PD. 
• Further participation would be injurious to the subject' s health or well -being, in the 
investigator 's medical judgment.  
• The subject becomes pregnant. 
• Informed consent is withdrawn.   
Note:   Consent withdrawn means that the subject can no longer be followed.  
Subjects may choose to discontinue study treatment and remain in the study to be 
followed for disease progression and survival per the schedule of assessments. 
• The study is terminated by [CONTACT_456]. 
• The study is terminated by [CONTACT_19407], IRB, or IEC. 
A subject may be discontinued from study treatment in the following situation:  
• If a subject is noncompliant with study procedures or study treatment administration in the investigator 's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], then the sponsor should be consulted for instruction on 
handling the subject. 
5.5.2. Procedures for Study Treatment Discontinuation  
Reasonable efforts should be made to have the subject return for a follow-up visit.  These visits are described in Section  6.4.  The last date of the last dose of study treatment and the reason for 
subject withdrawal will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_566444] permanently discontinues study treatment, then the following should occur:  
• The reas on(s) for discontinuation must be documented in the subject' s medical record 
and in the eCRF. 
• The EOT visit should be performed. 
− If the EOT visit coincides with a regular study visit, then the EOT evaluations 
will supersede those of that scheduled visit, and the data will be entered in the EOT visit in the eCRF.  
• The date of the EOT visit should be recorded in the IWRS. 
• Subjects must be followed for safety for no less than 30 days after the EOT visit or until study drug– related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed 
irreversible, whichever is longest.  
If the subject discontinues study treatment and actively withdraws consent for collection of follow-up data (safety follow-up or disease assessment), then no additional data will be 
collected.  Ho wever, subjects may withdraw consent for study treatment but continue to be 
assessed for disease progression and survival per the schedule of assessments.  
5.6. Concomitant Medications 
All concomitant medications and treatments must be recorded in the eCRF.  Any  prior 
medication received up  to 30 days before the date of study treatment administration (Day 1) will 
be recorded in the eCRF.  Concomitant treatments and/or procedures that are required to manage a subject 's medical condition during the study will also be recorded in the eCRF. 
5.6.1. Pneumocystis Jiroveci i Pneumonia Prophylaxis  
All subjects are required to receive a standard PJP prophylaxis regimen determined by [CONTACT_1275].  Examples of standard PJP prophylaxis therapi[INVESTIGATOR_445277]-sulfamethoxazole, atovaquone, dapsone with or without pyrimethamine, and 
pentamidine ( NCCN  2017).  Due to reports of cross -sensi tivity between sulfonamides and 
dapsone, all subjects who have a known or suspected allergy to s ulfonamides must receive either 
inhaled pentamidine or atovaquone for PJP prophylaxis.  Prophylaxis should be given while subjects are receiving study treatment and should continue for at least [ADDRESS_566445] dose of study treatment. 
The prophylactic agents will be obtained from commercial supplies and will be reimbursed by 
[CONTACT_229461].  Investigators are responsible for ensuring that subjects receive commercially available supplies of the selected prophylactic agents as required per Protocol.  Further details are 
available in the Pharmacy Manual.  
5.6.2. Restricted Medications  
• Use of systemic corticosteroid doses ≤  10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) is 
permitted but discouraged from the screening visit through EOT. 
• Short courses of systemic corticosteroid doses >  10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent 
are permitted  only in the case of severe or life -threatening complications that cannot 
be controlled with other drugs, but are otherwise discouraged  from the screenin g visit 
through EOT. 
Incyte Corporation  Page 36 of 82 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 205 Am 7 Version 7  30 JAN 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  • Use of weak or moderate inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 (p lease refer to the 
Pharmacy Manual and consult your local pharmacist ) is discouraged, and 
investigators should seek other options where possible. 
• Use of P -glycoprotein substrates of clinical relevance should be used with caution 
(ie, aliskiren, ambrisentan, colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, everolimus, 
fexofenadine, imatinib, lapatinib, maraviroc, nilotinib, posaconazole, ranolazine, 
saxagliptin, sirolimus, sitagliptin, talinolol, tolvaptan, topotecan) from the screening visit through EOT . 
• Localized radi otherapy will be  permitted if administered as treatment for pain or 
impending compression fractures and with prior approval of the medical monitor . 
5.6.3. Prohibited Medications  
• Use of potent inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 are prohibited (p lease refer to the 
Pharmacy Manual and consult your l ocal pharmacist ).  Based on the low overall 
bioavailability of topi[INVESTIGATOR_147063], there are no restrictions on topi[INVESTIGATOR_147063]. 
• Apart from the study treatments, the use of any anticancer medications as described (see Section  3.2) through the safety  follow-up is prohibited. 
• Exposure to a live vaccine within [ADDRESS_566446] will be discontinued from the study for any 1 of the following reasons: 
• The subject has died. 
• The subject is considered lost- to-follow-up when he/she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298] (eg, after 3 telephone calls and/or a certified letter or local equivalent).  
• Informed consent is withdrawn. 
• The study is terminated by [CONTACT_456]. 
• The study is terminated by [CONTACT_19407], IRB or IEC. 
5.8. Treatment After the End of the Study  
At the end of the study as defined in Sect ion 6.5, subjects who have completed at least 24 months 
of study participation (starting from the first dose of study treatment), who remain on active 
study treatment, and who have no evidence of progressive disease will have  the option to 
continue on monotherapy with INCB050465 provided within a rollover Protocol , as local law 
permits .

and obtained before signing of informed consent may be used for screening or baseline purposes, provided that the procedure meets the Protocol- defined criteria and has been performed in the 
screening interval.  A ll information associated with eligibility requirements must be entered into 
the appropriate eCRF pages.  
Results from the screening visit evaluations will be reviewed by [CONTACT_445291] n of study drug.  Tests with results that 
fail eligibility requirements may be repeated during screening if the investigator believes the results to be in error.  For screening assessments that are repeated, the most recent available result before administ ration of study drug will be used to determine subject eligibility.  
Additionally, a subject who fails screening may repeat the screening process 1 time if the investigator believes there has been a change in eligibility status (e g, after recovery from an 
infection).  Such subjects will be assigned a new subject ID number. 
6.2. Treatment  
The treatment period begins on the date of first dose of study treatment (Day 1).  Day [ADDRESS_566453] has signed the ICF.  Dates for subsequent study visits will 
be determined based on this date and should occur within the visit windows outlined in the schedule of assessments (see Table 6) unless delayed for safety reasons.  At Day 1, results from 
screenin g visit evaluations should be reviewed by [CONTACT_445292], as specified in the Protocol.  Subjects may receive treatment until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicit y, or consent withdrawal, 
whichever occurs first . 
6.3. End of Treatment 
There is no defined date of EOT.  When the subject permanently discontinues study treatment, then the EOT visit should be conducted.  If the EOT visit coincides with a regular study visit, the 
EOT  evaluations will supersede those of that scheduled visit, and the data should be entered in 
the EOT  visit in the eCRF.  The subject should be encouraged to return for the safety f ollow-up 
visit.

CONFIDENTIAL  6.4. Follow -Up 
6.4.1. Safety Follow- Up 
The safety f ollow-up perio d is the interval between the EOT visit and the scheduled follow-up 
visit, which should occur 30 to 35 days  after the EOT visit (or after  the last dose of study 
treatment if the EOT visit was not performed).  Adverse events and SAEs must be reported up 
until at least [ADDRESS_566454] will move into the survival 
follow-up period. 
6.4.2. Disease Status  Follow- Up 
Subjects who discontinue study treatment for a reason other than disease progression will 
continue to be followed for disease assessments by [CONTACT_445293] (see Table 6 ).  Every effort should be made to collect information regarding disease 
status until 1 of the following occurs: 
• The start of new antineoplastic therapy.  
• Disease progression.  
• Death.  
• The end of the study. 
6.4.3. Survival Follow- Up 
Once a subject has received the last dose of study treatment, confirmed disease progression, or 
starts a new anticancer therapy,  the subject moves into the survival follow-up period and should 
be followed up every [ADDRESS_566455] 2 4 months of study participation (starting from first 
dose of INCB050465). 
At the end of the study, subjects who have completed at least [ADDRESS_566456] the option to continue on monotherapy with INCB050465 provided within a rollover 
Protocol , as local law permits.  
6.6. Unscheduled Visits 
Unscheduled visits may be held at any time at the investigator 's discretion, and appropriate 
clinical and laboratory measurements performed based on AEs or other findings. 
7. CONDUCT OF STUDY ASS ESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
7.1. Administration of Informed Consent Form  
Valid informed consent must be obtained voluntarily from the study subject before conducting 
any study- specific procedures using an ICF approved by [CONTACT_1036]/IEC that contains all 
elements required by [CONTACT_12212] E6 and describes the nature, scope, and pos sible consequences of the 
study in a form understandable to the study subject.  Local and institutional guidelines for ICF content and a dministration must be followed; the original signed ICF must be retained by [CONTACT_1275] , and a copy of the signed ICF must be provided to the study subject.  The informed 
consent process for each subject must be documented in writing within the subjec t source 
documentation.  Note that the subject can stop participating in the study at any time and for any 
reason, and the decision to stop participating in the study will have no penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled.  
7.2. Interactive Web Response Technology  Procedure  
The IWRS will be contact[CONTACT_147101] a subject ID number when a subject enters screening.  
Upon determining that the subject is eligible for study entry, the IWRS will be contact[CONTACT_445294] t.  Additionally, the IWRS will be contact[CONTACT_445295] (see Section  5.1.1 and  Table 6). 
7.3. Demography and Medical Histo ry 
7.3.1. Demographics and General Medical History  
Demographic data and a general medical history  will be collected . 
7.3.2. Disease Characteristics and Treatment History  
A disease-targeted medical and medication history, including date of diagnosis of MC L, 
histology, current staging, grade, sites of disease, prior antineoplastic therapy, surgery, radiation, and other details related to the disease under study , will be collected at screening .

CONFIDENTIAL  For consideration of prior lines of therapy, a treatment is considered a new line of therapy if any 
of the following 3 conditions are met: 
• Start of a new line of treatment after discontinuation of a previous line:  If a treatment 
regimen is discontinued for any reason and a different regimen is started, it should be considered a new l ine of therapy.  A regimen is considered to have been discontinued 
if all the drugs in that given regimen have been stopped.  A regimen is not considered 
to have been discontinued if some of the drugs of the regimen, but not all, have been 
discontinued. 
• The unplanned addition or substitution of 1 or more drugs in an existing regimen: 
Unplanned addition of a new drug or switching to a different drug (or combination of drugs) due to any reason is considered a new line of therapy. 
• Stem c ell transplant:  In subjects  undergoing >  [ADDRESS_566457] (autologous or 
allogeneic) should be considered a new line of therapy regardless of whether the conditioning regimen used is the same or different.

maintenance therapy after the SCT is considered [ADDRESS_566458] be recorded in the eCRF, 
and any medication received or procedure performed within 30 days before enrollment and as indicated (see Table 6) will be recorded in the eCRF.  The medication record w ill be maintained 
after signing the ICF to document concomitant medications, including any changes to the dose or 
regimen.  Concomitant medications include any prescription, over- the-counter, or natural/herbal 
preparations taken or administered during the study period.  Concomitant treatments and/or 
procedures that are required to manage a subject 's medical condition during the study will also be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
7.5. Safety Assessments  
7.5.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be monitored from the time the subje ct signs the ICF .  Subjects will be 
instructed to report all AEs during the study and will be assessed for the occurrence of AEs 
throughout the study.  In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects will be asked general, 
nonleading questions such as "H ow are you feeling? "  All AEs (serious and nonserious) must be 
recorded on the source documents and e CRFs  regardless of the assumption of a causal 
relationship with the study drug .  The definition, reporting, and recording requirements for AEs 
are described in Section  8. 
7.5.2. Comprehensive Physical Examination 
Clinically notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator are to be reported as AEs.  
Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_566459] be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed 
physician, physician 's assistant, or an advanced registered nurse practitioner, as local law 
permits.  
The comprehensive physical examination will include height (at screening only), body weight (within 1 lb or 0.5 kg), and assessment(s) of the following organ or body systems:  skin; head, 
eyes, ears, nose, and throat; thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular system; abdomen (liver, spleen); extremities; and lymph nodes; as well as a brief neurological examination (eg, reflexes, strength, Romberg's test, vibration sense, and gross sensory perception). 
7.5.3. Disease -Specific Physical Examination 
A disease- specific physical examination will be a symptom-directed evaluation and will include 
assessment(s) o f the body systems or organs, as indicated by [CONTACT_147104], AEs, 
or other findings as determined by [CONTACT_1719].  A disease- specific physical 
examination must include a measurement of the subject 's body weight (within 1 lb or 0.5 kg) and 
an evaluation of any AEs or symptoms that the subject has previously reported. 
7.5.4. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature.  
Blood pressure and pulse will be taken with the subjec t in the recumbent, semirecumbent , or 
sitting position after [ADDRESS_566460] management.  Baseline ECGs ob tained 
during screening can be performed using a single m easurement; however, ECGs may be 
performed  in triplicate if the single QTc measurement is >  450 milliseconds (corrected by 
[CONTACT_6550]; see Section  3.2).  T he decision to include or exclude a subject or discontinue a 
subject 's participation in the study based on an ECG flagged as " Abnormal, Clinically 
Significant " is the responsibility of the investigator, in consultation with the sponsor' s medical 
monitor, a s appropriate.  If a single measurement demonstrates a QTc interval 
> 500 milliseconds, 2 more ECGs should be obtained over a brief period, and the averaged QTc 
intervals should be used to determine whether the study treatment should be interrupted (see Section  5.4.1). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Timed Electrocardiograms  
Timed triplicate ECGs will be obtained during the Day 1 visit (predose) and at Week 4 (predose 
and 1.5 hours [± 15 minutes] after receiving study treatment).  When triplicate ECGs are being obtained, individual measurements should be performed 5 minutes (± 3 minutes) apart.

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ( Oken  et al 1982; see Appendix B ) will 
be assessed.  Performance status must be assessed by a medically qualified individual and 
recorded in the eCRF.  
7.5.7. Laboratory Assessments 
Blood draws for laboratory assessments will occur at study visits indicated in the schedule of laboratory assessments (see Table 7 ).  Specific laboratory assessments are provided in Table 8. 
All laboratory assessments , including those conducted during unschedule d visits,  will be 
performed at a central laboratory, with the exception of serum pregnancy testing at screening 
(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), which may be performed either centrally or locally.  If performed locally, 
the investigative site laboratory or an accredited local laboratory may be used . 
Note:  A local laboratory assessment (including reference ranges) will be  entered into the eCRF 
only if there is  no accompanying central laboratory assessment and the local labo ratory 
assessment caused a change in patient management (eg, a dose interruption or reduction) or was 
an AE or SAE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Chemistry and Hematology 
All chemistry and hematology assessments (see Table 7 and Table 8) will be performed from blood samples collected using institutional best practices  (refer to  the Laboratory Manual ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Testing  
A serum pregnancy test at screening will be required for all women of childbearing potential (see Section  3.1) as shown in Table 7 and can be performed either at the central or local laboratory.  
Urine pregnancy tests (performed locally) will be conducted as shown in  Table 7.  If a urine 
pregnancy test is positive, the results should be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test 
(performed centrally).  If the serum pregnancy test is negative after a positive urine test, the 
investigator will assess the potential benefit/risk to the subject and determine whether it is in the subject 's best interest to resume study treatment and continue participation in the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serology 
Serology assessments will be performed at a central laboratory (see Table 7  and Table 8).  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. HIV Testing  
Subjects enrolled outside of the [LOCATION_002] must have an HIV immunoassay test at screening to ensure negative HIV status (s ee Section  3.2).  HIV testing is optional for subjects enrolled in

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_566461] reminder car d will indicate the date/time of the next visit and will also remind the 
subjects of which days they should not take their morning dose before coming to the clinic (see 
Section  7.7).  The reminder cards for the W eek [ADDRESS_566462] dose taken (from the previous day) and the time of their last meal before the visit should be recorded. 
7.9.2. Data Collection for Survival Follow- Up 
For subjects having entered the survival follow-up period of the study, the site will collect data 
as described (see Section  6.4.3). 
8. SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING  
8.1. Adverse Events  
8.1.1. Definitions  
For the purposes of this Protocol, an adverse event (AE) i s defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, that occurs after a subject provides informed consent.  Abnormal laboratory values or test results occurring after informed consent constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, 
are considered clinically meaningful, require therapy (eg, hematologic abnormality that requires transfusion), or require changes in the study drug(s). 
8.1.2. Reporting  
Adverse events  that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded on the Adverse 
Events form  of the e CRF.  Conditions that were already present at the time of infor med consent 
should be recorded on the Medical History form in  the e CRF.  Monitoring for the occurrence of 
new A Es should be continued for at least [ADDRESS_566463] dose of study treatment.  Adverse 
events ( including lab oratory abnormalities that  constitute AEs) should be described usin g a 
diagnosis whenever possible rather than  by [CONTACT_147108].  When a 
clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate AE . 
The term "disease progression " should be recorded as an AE/SAE only if there are no other 
identifiable AEs /SAEs  associated with the diseas e progression at the time of reporting.  For 
events associated with disease progression , the relevant signs and symptoms should be reported 
using a diagnosis whenever possible rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms.  
When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a 

Incyte Corporation  Page 52 of 82 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 205 Am 7 Version 7 30 JAN 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  separate AE.  If the events resulting from disease progression meet the criteria for an SAE 
(eg, resulted in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a life -threatening event, or death), the specific event(s) should be 
reported as an SAE(s) as described in Section  8.3.2.  In both cases (ie, AEs or SAEs related to 
disease progression), it should be indicated that each event  (reported as a diagnosis or as signs 
and symptoms) is  related to disease progression  on the Adverse Events form of the eCRF. 
The severity of AEs will be assessed using CTCAE v 4.03 Grades 1 through 5.  If an event is not 
classified by [CONTACT_3989], the severity  of the AE will be graded according to the scale below  to 
estimate the grade of severity:  
Grade  1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
activi ties of daily living.  
Grade 3  Severe or medical ly significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily 
living . 
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequen ces; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade [ADDRESS_566464], or other assessments.  To the 
extent  possible, each AE  should be evaluated to determine: 
• The severity grade (CTCAE G rade 1 to  5). 
• Whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study treatment:  suspected (yes) or not suspected (no). 
• The s tart and end dates, unless unresolved at final follow-up. 
• The action taken with re gard to study drug . 
• The event o utcome ( eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, 
recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown). 
• The s erious ness, as per serious adverse event ( SAE ) definition provided in 
Section  8.3.1. 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting requirements  (see Section  8.3.2). 
All AEs  should be treated appropriately.  If an AE is treated with a concomitant medication or 
nondrug therapy, this action should be recorded on A dverse E vent form and the treatment should 
be specified on  the Prior/ Concomitant M edications  or Procedures and Non- Drug Therapy form 
in the e CRF . 
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it ha s resolved  or until it is judged to be 
permanent;  assessment should be made at  each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any

CONFIDENTIAL  changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to 
treat the event , and the outcome. 
When the severity  of an AE changes over time for a reporting period (eg, between visits ), each 
change in severity  will be reported as a separate AE until the event resolves.  For example, 
[ADDRESS_566465] Abnormalities  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE  in their own right (considered clinically 
meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes 
in study drug ) should be recorded on the A dverse Event form in  the e CRF.  Whenever possible, a 
diagnosis rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, " anemia" instead of "low hemoglobin" ).  
Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for AEs should be followed until they have 
returned to normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  When an abnormal 
laboratory te st result corresponds to a sign or symptom of a previously reported AE , it is not 
necessary to separately record the laboratory  test result as an additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities  that do not meet the definition of an AE  should not be reported as AEs .  
A Grade 3 or 4 AE  does not automatically indicate an SAE unless it meets the de finition of 
serious, as defined in Section  8.3.1.  A dose modification  for the lab oratory abnormality may be 
required (see Section  5.4) and should not contribute to the designation of a laboratory test  
abnormality as an SAE . 
8.3. Serious Adverse Events  
8.3.1. Definitions  
An SAE is defined as an event that meets at least 1 of the following criteria: 
• Is fatal or life -threatening . 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] e xisting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a result of: 
− A routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with 
any deterioration in condition.  
− An elective surgery or preplanned treatment for a pre- existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the ICF. 
− A treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 205 Am 7 Version 7 30 JAN 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  − Any social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594], in the absence of any deterioration in the 
subject 's general condition. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability , incapacity , or a substantial disruption of 
a person 's ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Constitutes a congenital a nomaly or birth defect . 
• Is considered to be an important medical event  or a medically significant event that 
may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147065], based on appropriate medic al judgment, the event 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above. 
8.3.2. Reporting  
Every SAE, regardless of suspected causality (eg, relationship to study drug(s) or study procedure or dis ease progression), occurring after the subject has signed the ICF through the last 
study visit (or [ADDRESS_566466] dose of study treatment, whichever is later) must be reported 
to the sponsor (or designee) within [ADDRESS_566467] a reasonable possib ility that the SAE is related to the study treatment:  suspecte d 
(yes) or not suspected (no).  Refer to the Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Serious Adverse Event Report Form. 
The contact [CONTACT_89208]' s study- specific representatives  is listed in the 
investigator manual provided to each site.  The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the 
confirmation sheet must be kept at the study site.  
Investigational site personnel must report any new information regarding the SAE within 24 hours of becoming aware of the information in the same manner that the initial SAE Report 
Form was sent.  Follow-up information is recorded on an amended or new SAE Report Form, 
with an indication that it is follow -up to the previously reported SAE and the da te of the original 
report.  The follow-up report should include information that was not provided on the previous 
SAE Report Form, such as the outcome of the event (eg, resolved or ongoing), treatment 
provided, action taken with study drug because of the SAE (eg, dose reduced, interrupted, or discontinued), or subject disposition (eg, continued or withdrew from study participation).  Each 
recurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as follow-up to 
that event, regardless of when it occurs.

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 205 Am 7 Version 7 30 JAN 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  If the SAE is not documented in the IB for the study drug  (new occurrences ) and is thought to be 
related to the sponsor' s study drug, the sponsor or its designee may urgently requir e further 
information from the investigator for reporti ng to health a uthorities .  The sponsor or its designee 
may need to issue an  Investigator Notification (IN)  to inform all investigators involved in any 
study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions  (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and 
relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC , or as per national 
regulatory requirements in participating countries.

8.6. Pregnanc y 
Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_147066] a contraceptive medication or method.  When a pregnancy has been confirmed in a subject during maternal or paternal exposure to study drug, the following procedures should be follow ed in order to ensure subject safety: 
• The s tudy drug  must be discontinued immediately  (female subjects only ; see 
Section  5.4.1 for the maximum permitted dura tion of study drug interruption). 
• The i nvestigator must complete and submit the Incyte Clinical Trial P regnancy f orm 
to the sponsor or its designee within 24 hours  of learning of the pregnancy.

CONFIDENTIAL  10.2. Accountability, Handling, and Disposal of Study Drug  
The investigator is responsible for drug accountability at the study site; however, some of the 
drug accountability duties may be assigned to an appropriate pharmacist or other designee.  
Inventory and accountability records must be maintained and readily available for inspection by [CONTACT_147117].  The investigator or designee must maintain records that document: 
• Delivery of study drug to the study site.  
• Inventory of study drug at the site. 
• Subject use of the study drug including pi[INVESTIGATOR_147067]. 
• Return of study drug to the investigator or designee by [CONTACT_1766]. 
The investigational product must be used only in accordance with the Protocol.  The investigator 
will also maintain records adequately documenting that the subjects were provided the specified study drug.  These records should include dates, quantities, and any available batch or ser ial 
numbers or unique code numbers assigned to the investigational product and study subjects. 
Completed accountability records will be archived by [CONTACT_779].  The investigator or designee will 
be expected to collect and retain all used, unused, and partially used containers of study drug 
until verified by  [CONTACT_11200] (unless otherwise agreed to by [CONTACT_456]).  At the 
conclusion of the study, the investigator or designee will oversee shipment of any remaining 
study drug back to the sponsor or its designee for destruction according to institutional standard 
operating procedures.  If local procedures mandate on-site destruction of investigational supply, 
the site should (where local procedures allow) maintain the investigational supply until the study monitor inspects the accountability records in order to evaluate compliance and accuracy of 
accountability by [CONTACT_3878].   At sites where the study drug is destroyed before 
monitor inspection, the monitors rely on documentation of destruction pe r the site SOP.  
10.3. Data Management  
Data management will be performed in a validated database via an Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC) system.  All data entry, verification, and validation will be performed in accordance with 
the current standard operating procedures of the Data Management Department  at the sponsor or 
its designee .  The database will be authorized for lock once all defined procedures are completed. 
The investigator will be provided with access to an EDC system so that an eCRF can be completed for each subject.  Entries made in the eCRF must be verifiable against source 
documents; if updates to the database are not possible, any discrepancies should be explained and documented.  The investigator will be responsible for reviewing all data and eCRF ent ries, 
and will sign and date the designated forms in each subject's eCRF, verifying that the information is true and correct.  The investigator is responsible for the review and approval of all query responses. 
Protocol deviations will be identified and recorded in the Protocol Deviation form  of the eCRF.  
The study monitor will reference the Monitoring Plan in order to ensure that each issue identified 
is appropriately documented, reported, and resolved in a timely manner in accordance with the plan's requ irements.

Investigator Financial Disclosure f orm that sufficiently details any financial interests and 
arrangements that apply.  For the purpose of this regulation, " clinical investigator " is defined as  
any investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of 
research subjects, including the spouse and each dependent child of the clinical investigator or 
subinvestigator.  These requirements apply to both US and forei gn clinical investigators 
conducting covered clinical studies. 
Any new clinical investigators added to the covered clinical study during its conduct must also 
submit a completed Investigator Financial Disclosure Form.  During a covered clinical study, any changes to the financial information previously reported by a clinical investigator must be 
reported to the sponsor or its designee.  At the conclusion of the covered clinical study, the clinical investigators will be reminded of their obligation s.  In the event that the clinical 
investigator  is not reminded, the y nevertheless  will remain obligated  to report to the sponsor or 
its designee any changes to the financial information previously reported, as well as any changes in their financial information for a period of 1 year after completion of the covered clinical study. 
10.6. Publication Policy

1. Background 
 
 Montana’s high rates of poor mental health combined wi th low rates of access to care [1] 
indicate a pressing urgency for alternative methods to meet the mental health needs of Montanans. Mental health service deficits in rural and frontier Montana com munities, 
compared to more urban areas are even more substantial [2] where higher poverty, lower educational attainment, and lower employment rates occur [3].  Montana ranks last among all 
states in population density with 55 of 56 counties defined as ru ral or frontier [4]. 
 
Computer -administered CBT (cCBT) programs have generally shown similar efficacy  as 
clinician-administered CBT [5] with positive impacts in rural communities outside the U.S. [6]. Thrive is an interactive version of cCBT with a heavy emphasis on video rather than text 
content that appears to improve participant engagement, a shortcomi ng seen in prior cCBT 
programs [7]. Thrive users proceed at their own pace and receive personalized treatment sequences based on assessment responses by [CONTACT_6904]. Thrive provides safeguards and 
guidance if the program is not working effectively.  
 Thrive’s developmental history reflects changes in accessible technology.  Across all 
developmental versions, it has been shown to be efficacious in reducin g depressive 
symptoms. First developed and studied as a desk top computer terminal administered program in a RCT compared with clinician CBT and wait -list control (WLC), it’s early promise was 
reflected in effect sizes of 1.[ADDRESS_1215170] treated groups, respectively, compared with WLC [8]. A substantially modified version called COPE was 
administered by [CONTACT_870280] [ 9]. COPE was subsequently 
converted for administration on the Internet and impr oved by [CONTACT_870281], making the program more engaging and effective for individuals with lower 
literacy. It has since been designed to operate on smartphone and tablet devices in addition to 
computers. To provide a gold-standard test of efficacy of cCBT in rural U.S. communities, 
RCTs are needed.  Given the high stigmatization of mental illne ss in remote rural communities 
[10], cCBT programs such as Thrive offer an accessible and confidential way to help people 
experiencing depressive symptoms, syndromes, and disorders in rural communities.  Our 
project addresses this need.    
 Preliminary evidence on Thrive. Among commercially insured patients, Thrive resulted in an 
average reduction of 39% in depression severity as measured b y the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [11], from pre- to post-assessment (see Table). These uncontrolled 
trials indicate improvements in depression symptoms across all levels of baseline depression 
severity with marked improvements among those with moderate to severe depression.

2. Research Objectives  
 This is a fully randomized trial of cCBT care for depression versus care as usual. The 
quantitative evaluation will be completed to achieve the following aims:  
 
1. To determine the relative effectiveness of the Thrive program to decrease depressive 
symptomatology and improve overall quality of life compared to usual care.  
2. To determine the long-term effectiveness of the Thrive program to decrease depressive symptomatology and improve overall quality of life  
 
 
3. Methods  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1215171] period, those randomized to the control group will receive basic 
information about depression from the National Institute of Mental Health [21], and will 
subsequently be provided access to the Thrive program at the end of the initial eight -weeks of 
the study trial. 
 
3.2 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 
 
3.2.1 Inclusion Criteria: Particpants must be aged 18 year or older; have residency in 
Montana, have reglar access to broadband internet, and have a score of 5 or greater on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. 
 
3.2.2 Exclusion Criteria:  We will exclude persons aged [ADDRESS_1215172] control (WLC) groups.  
 
3.4 Measures and data collection 
 Primary Outcome Measure:  Patient Health Questionnaire nine -item scale (PHQ-9) [11 ], is a 
valid assessments of depression severity  
 
Secondary Outcome Measures: Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven-item scale (GAD-7) 
[12]; Connor-Davidson Resilience ten-item Scale (CDRS-10) [13 ]; and, the Work and Social 
Adjustment Scale (WSAS) [14 ].  
 
Data are collected by [CONTACT_6270] -report online and will be uploaded and de -identified through the 
Thrive database and made accessible to the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_870276]. Participants 
randomized to the intervention group are assessed at baseline, [ADDRESS_1215173] control group  are assessed at 
baseline, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks, and 8 and 14 months from enrollment.  
 
3.5 Statistical Analysis Plan:  Analyses will use an intent -to-treat approach to examine 
difference in mean scores between intervention and control groups. Depressive 
symptomatology (PHQ -9 scores) from baseline and weeks 4 and  8 will be the primary 
continuous outcome measure.  Anxiety, Resilience, and Functional Impairment scores from 
baseline and weeks 4 and  8 will b e secondary continuous outcome measures.  For the primary 
and secondary outcomes, the change over time in each outcome will be compared between the intervention and WLC groups using a linear mixed model analysis of repeated measures.  
A separate mixed model will be conducted on each outcome measure. Each mixed model will 
contain fixed effects terms for treatment (intervention vs. WLC), time, treatment × time 
interaction, and respective baseline measure (prior to the intervention) as a covariate.  Other 
relevant covariates will also be considered for inclusion in the mixed model.  The correlation of 
any naturally-occurring paired participant s (e.g., parent/child, siblings, husband/wife, and 
partners) will be accounted for in the mixed model analysis.  Least s quares (LS) means 
(adjusted treatment means) will be estimated as part of the mixed model so as to interpret the 
omnibus treatment effect (LS mean difference between treatments).  Statistical analyses will 
be performed using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).  The PROC 
MIXED procedures (mixed model approach in SAS) will make use of all available data from all 
participants from the efficacy analysis set, and provide a robust mechanism for handling data 
that are assumed missing at random [15-17].  The level of significance for all tests will be set at 
α = .05 (two-tailed).  Statistical expertise will be built into the budget for Years 1 and 2.  
 To evaluate the long -term effects of Thrive, in an exploratory analysis , a completely 
within -subjects linear mixed model analysis of repeated measures will be used to examine the 
change in each of the primary and secondary outcomes over the 12 months following delivery 
of Thrive by [CONTACT_870282] (intervention+WLC).   In the case of 
the group randomized to Thrive, data will include assessments at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks, and 
6 and 12 months.   For the WLC group, baseline for this combined -group analysis will be 8 
 5 weeks after randomization (i.e., immediately prior to startin g Thrive) and then 4 and 8 weeks, 
and 6 and 12 months after starting Thrive.    
 
3.6 Sample Size Estimation and Power Analysis for the Primary Outcome of the Study : 
Effect sizes from the preliminary analysis of the 4 uncontrolled studies of Thrive as it relates to 
the primary continuous outcome (depressive symptomatology, as assessed by [CONTACT_127659] -9) 
were consistently very large (d > 1.0).  Using a conservative estimate of effect size (d~0.30), 
an a priori sample size estimation and power analysis was performed  for the repeated 
measures design/analysis in the proposed controlled study.  The results suggest that a sample 
size of 117 per group (N = 234) achieves 80% power to detect a conservative effect size of 
0.30 (Cohen’s d--standardized group mean difference) in a 2  (between-subjects) group design 
with 3 (within-subjects) repeated measurements  having a compound symmetry covariance 
structure when the assumed within-subject correlation is 0.50, and the alpha level is 0.05 (two -
tailed), with a normal distribution for the test statistic.  We anticipate some dropouts [~49% 
within the first 4 weeks (the period designating an evaluable subject) after enrollment, based 
on treatment discontinuation results from Thrive].  Thus, 459 participants will be enrolled to 
allow f or this expected rate of attrition with the intent of capturing a range o f evaluable data for 
234 participant s.  The Power Analysis and Sample Size (PASS) 2015 software, version 14.02, 
was used to carry out the sample size and power analysis  [18].

2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted
Testosterone (T) products have been approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US) for over 50 years for the 
treatment of T -deficient men.  These products are currently indicated for the treatment of congenital or 
acquired primary hypogonadism and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in men.1,2
Hypogonadism is an endocrine disorder characterized by [CONTACT_492503] T levels along with signs 
and symptoms of androgen deficiency, including delayed development or regression of seconda ry sexual 
characteristics, impaired sexual function, impaired sense of well -being, depressed mood, decreased 
muscle strength associated with a loss of muscle mass, and reduced bone mineral density (BMD).2-7
The efficacy of AndroGel 1.62% is demonstrated by [CONTACT_492504] T leve ls by [CONTACT_492505] T through the skin when applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_897].  The objective of testosterone replacement 
therapy (TRT) in hypogonadal men is to replace T within the eugonadal range for healthy men (300 to 
1000 ng/dL).  Replacement of T levels into the eugonadal range in hypogonadal men should lead to 
restoration of androgenic effects such as improvements in libido and mood, increased lean mass, 
decreased fat mass and increased BMD.[ADDRESS_633510] been examined in 
placebo -controlled studies with various levels of supportive evidence depending on the cohorts 
(hypogonadal, eugonadal, mixed).
Current guidelines for the use of TRT ou tline the appropriate assessment and monitoring of men who 
are candidates for T therapy.  Key components of the Endocrine Society Guidelines8include criteria for 
selecting candidates with signs and symptoms consistent with hypogonadism and documented evidence 
of low T levels, for whom TRT may be indicated.  The Endocrine Society Guidelines also offer 
recommendations for confirmatory testing of serum T concentrations, additional evaluation, and TRT.[ADDRESS_633511] of T on Blood pressure (BP) includes preclinical and in 
vitro experiments, as well as some clinical data.9,10
Testosterone -related effects include:
Increased nitric oxide synthase;11
Decreased endothelin -1 in humans, although opposite effects seen in animals;12
Improv ed endothelial function;13,14
Decreased pr ostacyclin;15
Increased thromboxane (TXA)16postorchiectomy in rats appears to negatively affect nitric oxide 
and TXA release, demonstrating the complex relationship between factors influenced by

Sodium retention:  the mechanism is unclear, may occur through activation of the renin -
angiotensin system.18,[ADDRESS_633512] detriment to a benefit, including 
neutral effects.
In general, transdermal TRT does not appear to adversely influence overa ll study cohort mean BP across 
a number of studies and across a variety of patient types, including men at increased risk for 
cardiovascular disease (e.g., men with diabetes, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and older age).  
However, BP increases h ave been observed with oral TRT.[ADDRESS_633513] of AndroGel 1.62% on BP in hypogonadal 
men to fulfill a postmarketing requirement from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring
Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) has been widely used for the past decade in research 
and clinical practice around the world;21-23however, its use has been limited in the U S because of the 
expense of the equipment and the time involved in patient training and data analysis.
The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and 
Treatment of High Blood Pressure,24-26summarizes the use of ABPM as follows:
ABPM provides information about BP during daily activities and sleep.
ABPM is warranted for evaluation of "white coat" hypertension in the absence of target organ 
injury.  It is also helpful to assess patients with apparent drug resistance, hypotensive symptoms 
with antihypertensi ve medications, epi[INVESTIGATOR_156952], and autonomic dysfunction.
ABPM provides a measure of the percentage of BP readings that are elevated of the overall BP 
load, and of the extent of BP reduction during sleep.  In most individuals, BP decreases by 10% 
to 20% during the night; those in whom such reductions are not present are at increased risk for 
cardiovascular events, and ABPM helps to identify these individuals.
A great deal of evidence has accumulated in the past decade regarding ABPM utility.  It ha s been 
demonstrated that ABPM is a better indicator of a patient's true BP and correlates more closely with 
target organ damage and cardiovascular events than clinical cuff measurements.  As a result, ABPM is 
now considered to be the noninvasive gold standard.[ADDRESS_633514] used ABPM to monitor BP in hypogonadal men treated with T.

Data presented at the public workshop titled "Evaluating the Pressor Effects of Drugs & ABPM Studies" 
in February 2019 demonstrated that 50% of expected measurements during 24 hours within an 
individual along with other criteria may be sufficient for ABPM to be considered valid in the research 
trial settings.28
The ABPM validity criteria for present study are outlined below in Section 4.1and in Appendix 7.1 of the 
Operations Manual.
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
Benefits/Risks of Testosterone Replacement Therapy
The efficacy of AndroGel 1.62% is demonstrated by [CONTACT_492504] T levels by [CONTACT_492505] T through the skin when applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_897].
Potential risks of treatment with AndroGel 1.62% include secondary transfer of T to others, increased 
prostate -specific antigen (PSA) levels, prostate cancer, mood swings, hematocrit (Hct) increase, and skin 
irritation at the appli cation site.  For further details, please see findings from completed studies, 
including safety data in the current AndroGel 1.62% package insert.29
Benefits/Risks of ABPM 
Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring provides information that home BP and clinic BP cannot, 
including:
An estimate of true, or mean, BP level;
Addresses BP variability; 
Allows for evaluation of diurnal rhythm of BP;
Allows for measuring nighttime BP as nighttime hypertension correlates with a higher risk of 
cardiovascular end outcomes;
Allows for ruling out white -coat hypertension;
Allows for conducting BP medication assessment.
Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is especiall y useful for recently diagnosed hypertension or the 
assessment of BP medications effectiveness.  An ABPM test can help physicians to prescribe the right 
medications to keep BP in control and reduce future cardiovascular risk.  When ABPM is incorporated 
into the hypertension diagnostic and treatment process, up to a 14% savings in the cost of healthcare 
has been calculated.30
Although subjects may not di rectly benefit from the ABPM procedure, their participation in the study 
may contribute to scientific advances in the area of ABPM research and its clinical practice, as well as 
provide valuable information for the medical community and hypogonadal men rec eiving TRT.

STUDY M19 -161  |  Version 3.[ADDRESS_633515] of AndroGel 1.62% on BP.  The hypothesis 
corresponding to the primary objective is that AndroGel 1.62%, used as labelled, does not affect 24 -hour 
average systolic blood pressure (SBP).
3.2 Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint is the change in 24 -hour average SBP from Baseline to End of Treatment (EOT).
3.3 Other Endpoints
Change from Baseline to EOT in average daytime (09:00 –21:00 h) mean arterial pressure 
(MAP), SBP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), and heart rate (HR)
Change from Baseline to EOT in average nighttime (01:00 –06:00 h) MAP, SBP ,DBP, PP, and HR
Change from Baseline to EOT in average 24 -hour MAP, DBP, PP, and HR
Change from Baseline to EOT of MAP, SBP, DBP ,PP, and HR at the time of maximum observed 
Tconcentration (T max) by 24 -hour recordings
Change from Baseline over t ime (hourly average) by [CONTACT_492508], SBP, DBP, PP, 
and HR by 24 -hour recordings at EOT
Change from Baseline over time (hourly average) by [CONTACT_492509], SBP, DBP, PP, and 
HR by 24 -hour recordings at EOT
Subjects with new concomitan t antihypertensive medication(s) during the Treatment Period
Subjects with dose increases in antihypertensive medication(s) during the Treatment Period
Subjects and observations meeting the following BP thresholds separately by 24 -hour average 
and by [CONTACT_492510] y average by 24 -hour recordings:
≥ 160 mmHg SBP at EOT
≥ 100 mmHg DBP at EOT

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted with out prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].3.4 Safety Endpoints
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_492511] (SAEs), adverse events of special 
interest (AESI), study procedure –related nonserious adverse events (AEs) and SAEs, and AEs that lead to 
study drug discontinuation.  In addition, changes from Baseline in laborato ry and vital sign parameters 
to each specified timepoint will be summarized.
3.5 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
The steady -state pharmacokinetics (PK) of T will be characterized at the EOT Visit after a valid Week 16 
ABPM 24 -hour collection from serial PK blood sam ples (4 in total) obtained in all subjects at 0 hour 
(immediately prior to subject on -site application of study drug), and at [ADDRESS_633516] discontinuation rate.  There will be approxima tely 45 sites in the US.
The Screening Period is up to 45 days prior to the baseline ABPM 24 -hour collection and includes 
2separate visits (Screening Visit 1 [SV1] and Screening Visit 2 [SV2]) to establish subject eligibility.  
Office BP measurements by a utomated oscillometric device (see Appendix 7.2 of the Operations 
Manual) will be used for evaluation of the subject for BP eligibility criteria at Screening.  Once subjects 
meet all of the eligibility criteria during Screening, they will be enrolled into the study and followed until 
approximately [ADDRESS_633517] 16 weeks of treatment with AndroGel 
1.62%.  End of study (EOS) is defined as last visit/last procedure/last contact (office v isit or phone call).
Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring measurements will be obtained from all subjects using a 
portable data -monitoring device.  The ABPM procedure will be performed over a 24 -hour period across 
2 days and will include ABPM device application by [CONTACT_3725] (1stDay) and ABPM device removal by [CONTACT_3725] 
(2ndDay).
The validity of the ABPM 24 -hour collection measurements will be evaluated prior to performing the 
procedures for the Day 1 Visit, and prior to performing the procedures for the EOT Visit.  Day 1 is

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted with out prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].defined as start of treatment (first dose of the study dr ug).  Subjects will receive the first dose of the 
study drug on site only after validity of the baseline ABPM 24 -hour collection is confirmed.
The investigator or designee will assess the validity of ABPM measurements based on the results that 
are immediat ely available on site once data is downloaded from the ABPM device, to the study 
configured laptop, utilizing ABPM specific software.  The investigator or designee can then assess if a 
repeat ABPM collection is required.
The ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitor will be set to automatically measure and record BP every 
30 minutes for 24 hours.  The ABPM 24 -hour collection will be repeated if > 50% of collected ABPM data 
(measurements) during the 24 -hour period, daytime period (09:00 –21:00 h), or nighttim e period 
(01:00 –06:00 h) are missing or if there is an ABPM device malfunction.  Based on these criteria, a 
24-hour ABPM collection will be considered valid if all of the following are obtained:
1.At least [ADDRESS_633518] 12 SBP measurements between 09:00 and 21:[ADDRESS_633519] 5 SBP measurements between 01:00 and 06:00
The repeat ABPM 24 -hour collection will be conducted at Unscheduled Visits within 7 days of the invalid 
APBM.  The recorded ABPM data will be transmitte d to the core lab for centralized management (see 
Section 3.14 of the Operations Manual).
The study team, study statistician, study sites, and subjects will remain masked to the Week [ADDRESS_633520] early morning pre -dose T levels evaluated for titration.  Subjects will be 
titrated up by 20.25 mg, down by 20.25 m g, or remain on the previously assigned dose if their serum T 
levels are < 350 ng/dL, > 750 ng/dL, or between 350 ng/dL and 750 ng/dL inclusive, respectively (see 
Table 2 in Section 6.4 of the Operation sManual).  The final titrated doses will be 20.[ADDRESS_633521] dose of study drug.  During 
phone calls and in -person visits throughout the study, subjects will be asked specific questions 
pertaining to the possible occurrence of SAEs, AESI, as well as the collection of additional information 
related to ongoing AE(s).
Any chan ge in antihypertensive medication(s), antihypertensive medication(s) dose increase and/or 
initiation of antihypertensive medication(s) will be documented throughout the study.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted with out prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Section 3.11 of the Operations Manual ( Appendix E) provides details on the clinical laboratory samples 
collection during the study.
The study schematic is shown in Figure 1.  Further details regarding study procedures are outlined in the 
Operations Manual.  See Section 5for information rega rding eligibility criteria.
An analysis to estimate the standard deviation (SD) of change from Baseline in SBP average 24 -hour 
recording will be conducted in a blinded fashion when approximately 70% of the planned subjects in the 
per protocol population (i.e., 120 subjects) have completed the EOT Visit.  The objective of this analysis 
is to re -estimate sample size if needed.
[COMPANY_013] or its designee will make every effort to give sites advanced notice when recruitment for the 
study is nearing completion to minimize the risk for subjects in Screening who may not be allowed to 
enroll in the study.
Rescreening
Subjects who fail to meet the eligibility criteria may be rescreened one time at the investigator's 
discretion once their clinical status changes.
Men with a SV1 T level between 300 and 333 ng/dL or men who did not have a confirmed T level 
<300 ng/dL at SV2 can be rescreened after 3 months (90 days) following the visit (SV1 or SV2) at which 
Twas measured and did not meet eligibility criteria of < 300 ng/ dL.  All of the Screening procedures 
must be repeated, and the subjects must be re -consented.  Rescreened subjects will use the originally 
assigned subject number.

American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations for measurement of BP will be followed 
throughout the study.  Investigators or their designees responsible for obtaining BP measurements will 
complete training in AHA recommendations prior to initiating the study,32as well as training in cuff size 
measurements and ABPM measurements prior to study initiation.
Justification of study design 
An important difference between conventional and ambulatory BP mea surement is the absence of a 
placebo effect with the latter that has been demonstrated in numerous studies.33-43  Fitzgerald et al also 
postulated that ambulatory BP measurements do not regress to the mean; hence subjects with high BPs 
do not exhibit a decrease in BP and those with low BPs do not s how a tendency to raise their pressure 
with repeated measurements.44

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted with out prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].In February 2019, results from the FDA's ABPM research database review were pres ented at a public 
workshop titled, "Evaluating the Pressor Effects of Drugs & ABPM Studies."  The review was aimed to 
evaluate the consistency of the BP change from Baseline to post -baseline in placebo arms across 
multiple ABPM studies.  The data from 11 placebo -controlled ABPM studies (456 subjects) showed that

The only ABPM data for subjects treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] T are available from a Phase 3 study that compared 
oral T with topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] T.  The ABPM demonstrated the mean increase of 0.2 (± 9.4) mmHg in 24 -hour 
average SBP from Baseline to Visit 6 for topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] T and 4.9 (± 8.7) mmHg increase for oral T.  The SD for 
24-hour SBP for both oral and topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] T in this trial wa s slightly below [ADDRESS_633524] cancer, unprovoked pulmonary

approximately 21% of prescriptions.
The characteristics of the patient population receiving T therapy, comorbidities in particular, w ere 
evaluated in a study of 10,[ADDRESS_633526] frequent diagnoses were as follows:  43.7% of the patient population had hypertension, 
43.1% had hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], 33.5% had erectile dysfunction, 26.7% had testicular dysfunction, and 20.3%

AEs/SAEs have been resolved.
5.7 Study Drug
AndroGel 1.62% will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_492496] 1 Visit after 
confirmed valid ABPM assessment and should be applied at approximately the same time each day after 
that during the study.  The starting dose of AndroGel 1.62% is 40.5 mg of T (2 pump actuations, applied 
to the upper arms and shoulders).  It should not be administered to other parts of the body, including 
abdomen, genitals, chest, armpi[INVESTIGATOR_10022] (axillae), or knees.
AndroGel 1.62% can be dose adjusted between a minimum of 20.25 mg of T (1 pump actuation) and a 
maximum of 81.0 mg of T (4 pump actuations).  For the first study drug administration at the Day 1 Visit,

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted with out prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].and also at Week 2, Week 4, Week 16 ABPM, and End of Treatment Visits the subjects should apply the 
study drug while on site so that the site staff can observe the proper administration of study drug.
If subjects forget to apply their AndroGel 1.62% dose at their regularly scheduled dosing time, they 
should take the next dose at the next dosing time.
Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused pump bottles to the study site staff at each 
study visit (see Operations Manual, Appendix E).
[COMPANY_013] will supply the AndroGel 1.62% as study drug.  [COMPANY_013] provided study drug should not be 
substituted or alternately sourced unless otherwise directed by [CONTACT_26282].
AndroGel 1.62% will be packaged in pump bottles with quantities sufficient to accommodate study 
design.  Before using a new pump of study drug, the pump will need to be primed by [CONTACT_492515] [ADDRESS_633540]'s 
corresponding study visit.  Study staff will fill in all pump bottle labels before dispensing to subjects.  
Study drug will only be used for the conduct of this study.
Controlled Substance Requirements
The investigator must agree to comply with all applicable Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) laws and 
regulations regarding controlled substances as outlined in [ADDRESS_633541] be securely stored at the 
same location according to DEA guidelines for CIII control led substances.  Upon receipt of a shipment, 
the investigator or designated study staff at the site will: 
1.Open and inspect the shipment; 
2.Verify the study drug supplies have been received intact, in the correct amounts and at the 
correct address;
3.Acknowle dge receipt of study drug consignment via the IRT system.
5.8 Randomization/Drug Assignment
This is a single -arm open -label study; therefore, there will not be a randomization to treatment 
assignment.  All subjects will be assigned a unique identification numb er by [CONTACT_492516]1.  For subjects 
who rescreen, the screening number assigned by [CONTACT_492517]1 should be used.

5.9 Protocol Deviations
[COMPANY_013] does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol except when necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. The investigator is re sponsible for complying with all 
protocol requirements, written instructions, and applicable laws regarding protocol deviation s.  If a 
protocol deviation occurs (or is identified), the investigator is responsible for notifying IRB, regulatory 
authorities ( as applicable), and [COMPANY_013].
6SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
6.[ADDRESS_633542]/device.  Complaints associated with any component of AndroGel 1.62% 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_013].
Product Complaint
A product complaint is any complaint related to the biolog ic or drug component of the product or to the 
medical device component(s).
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies /inadequacies in the 
labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properly, 
or packaging issues.
Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 2 4 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during the 
study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events :  Study Drug
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended si gn 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of 
the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from 
"special situations" such as accidental or intentional overdose, medication error, occupational or 
Page 21 of 71 
STUDY M19 -161  |  Version 3.[ADDRESS_633543] be 
reported whether associated with an AE or not.   Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is 
considered an AE.  Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory 
abnormalities and changes in vit al signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation 
from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them 
to be AEs.
The investigator will monitor each subject on a routine basis throug hout the study for clinical and 
laboratory evidence of SAEs, AESI, AEs leading to study drug discontinuation, and study procedure -
related AEs.  Any SAEs, AESI, AEs leading to study drug discontinuation, and study procedure -related 
AEs, whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_8786], or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_340242].  All SAEs, AESI, AEs leading to study drug discontinuation, and study procedure -
related AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surger y/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre- existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been 
pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly 
during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition 
for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an AE, whether associated with study dru g or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is to be 
reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilance as a SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of 
the SAE (refer to Section 4. 2of the Operations Manual for reporting details and contact [CONTACT_33484]):
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have resulted in 
immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken.  This does 
not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a 
more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_82628]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include an 
emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal 
loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the 
activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not intended to 
include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as 
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and acciden tal trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or 
Surgical Intervention to 
Prevent Serious An important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening 
or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on me dical judgment may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life

anomaly, or persi stent or significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, 
any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an 
important medical event.  
All SAEs, AESI, AEs leading to study drug discontinuation will be recorded from the time of study drug 
administration until the end of the study/study completion.  Study procedure -related non -serious AEs 
and SAEs will be collected from the time the subject signs the study -specific informed consent until 
30days after the last dose of study drug.  All SA Es, AESI, AEs leading to study drug discontinuation, and 
study procedure –related AEs or SAEs will be followed until resolution or achievement of a new stable 
state, until the subject withdraws consent for study participation, or until the final study -relat ed 
communication (e.g., phone call at the end of the study or final study communication in subjects truly 
considered LTFU, whichever occurs first).
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) reporting for 
the AndroGel 1.62% product in accordance with global and local requirements.
The only AEs to be collected in the study are those that meet the definition of an AESI, resulted in study 
discontinuation, study procedure -related AEs, or meet the regulatory criteria fo r an SAE.  For SAEs with 
the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be recorded on the appropriate case report form 
(CRF) page.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
The following AESI will be collected during the study: 
Hypertension
Adverse Eve nt Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each AE:
Mild The AE is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate The AE causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual 
activities.
Severe The AE causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities 
and may be incapacitating or life threatening.
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study 
drug:

No Reasonable Possibility After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there 
is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
Pregnancy
Pregnancy of the subject's female partner will be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_633544]'s partner and the outcome of the 
pregnancy will be collected.  In the event of pregnancy occurring in a subject's partner during the stud y, 
written informed consent from the partner must be obtained prior to collection of any such information.  
[COMPANY_013] will provide a separate informed consent for this purpose.
The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or conge nital anomaly is 
considered a SAE and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the 
event.
7 STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
The statistical methods in the protocol focus on the primary endpoint analysis.  Complete and specific 
details of the statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).  
7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all subject s who received at least [ADDRESS_633545] 
85% compliant to study dr ug, and have valid Baseline and EOT systolic ABP data.  The per protocol 
population will be used for all analyses on endpoints based on [ADDRESS_633546] 1 dose of study drug.  The Safety 
Analysis Set will be used for all other safety analyses not related to 24 -hour collection from ABPM 
device.

Efficacy will not be evaluated in this study.
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety
Primary Safety Endpoint
For the primary analysis , the primary endpoint of change from Baseline to EOT in average 24 -hour SBP 
will be evaluate d using a linear regression model with average 24 -hour SBP at EOT as the outcome, and 
baseline average 24 -hour SBP and pooled study center as covariates in the per -protocol population .  If 
the upper confidence limit of the 1 -sided 97.5% confidence interval (CI) of the estimate of the chan ge 
from Baseline to EOT in average [ADDRESS_633547] of this missingness on the primary endpoint will be documented in the SAP.
Other Safety Endpoints
The continuous endpoints (e.g., change from Baseline to EOT in average daytime MAP, SBP, DBP, PP, 
and HR) will be summarized by [CONTACT_8477], SD, minimum, and maximum.  The categorical endpoints 
(e.g., subjects with new concomitant antihypertensive medications) will be summarized with n and 
percentage.
The following additional analysis will be performed:
Graphical display of hourly ABPM averages that include SD bars for both SBP and DBP at the 
Baseline and EOT Visits.
Cumulative distribution curves of 24 -hour average SBP and DBP at the Baseline and EOT Visits.
Forest plots of daytime, nighttime, and 24 -hour average change from Baseline to EOT with 95% 
CI displays for SBP and DBP.
Subgroup Analysis of Safety Endpoints
All the analysis for the primary and other safety endpoints (except the sensitivity analyses of the primary 
endpoint) will be provided by [CONTACT_492519]:
Subjects without an ongoing medical history of hypertension and without any antihypertensive 
medication(s) at Baseline;
Subjects with an ongoing medical history of hypertension with any antihypertensive
medication(s) at Baseline;
Subjects with an ongoing medical history of hypertension without any antihypertensive 
medication(s) at Baseline.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted with out prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Adverse Events
Treatment emergent AESI, AEs leading to study drug discontinuation and SAEs will be summarized in 
descending order of overall frequency by [CONTACT_10607] (MedDRA) 
preferred term (PT), as well as in a lexicographic order by [CONTACT_471311] (SOC) and MedDRA PT.
Treatment emergent AESI and SAEs will also be summarized according to their relationship to study drug 
and their maximum severity.  In addition, treatment emergent AEs/SAEs that lead to study drug 
discontinuation will a lso be summarized.
Clinical Laboratory Data
Continuous summaries of mean changes from Baseline to each applicable visit for items such as PSA, 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], Hct and hemoglobin will be summarized.
Vital Signs
Continuous summaries of the mean change from Baseline to each applicable visit in vital signs will be 
provided.  Vital sign variables include, but are not limited to, SBP and DBP by [CONTACT_492520], 
HR, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR), and oral body temperature.
7.5 Interim Analysis
An analysis to estimate the SD of the change from Baseline to EOT in average SBP from 24 -hour 
recordings will be conducted in a blinded fashion when approximately 70% of the planned subjects in 
the per protocol population (i.e., 120 subjects) have completed the EOT Visit.  The objective of analysis 
is to re -estimate sample size if needed.  A study database snapshot will be performed for this analysis.  
The sample size will be re -estimated with updated assumption of SD if necessary.  The blinded sample 
size re -estimation (BSSR) analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_492521].
An interim database lock will be performed to unmask the Week [ADDRESS_633548] 
completes a valid EOT ABPM 24 -hour collection or prem aturely discontinues from the study.
7.6 Overall Type I Error Control
This study has one primary endpoint for which non -inferiority is tested, so no adjustment for multiple 
endpoints is needed.  Analytically and through simulations, it has been shown that BSSR procedures 
(Section 7.7) do not meaningfully affect Type I error rate.53  Therefore, no multiplicity adjustment is 
planned for the BSSR analysis.
7.7 Sample Size Determination
A sample size of 171 subjects will provide 90% power for a paired t -test with 0.025 one -sided
significance level to show that the EOT average 24 -hour SBP is not greater tha nthe Baseline average 
24-hour SBP with a non -inferiority margin of 3 mmHg, assuming the mean difference between EOT and 
Page 26 of 71 
STUDY M19 -161  |  Version 3.[ADDRESS_633549] is a good 
approximation of the power for the primary analysis using linear regression with covariate adjustment.  
Assuming a 10% loss of subjects from the per protocol population due to premature discontinuation, 
invalid ABPM at the Baseline or EOT Visit, or non -adherence to study drug, approximately [ADDRESS_633550] 85% compliant to study drug and 
have valid ABPM data from Baseline and the EOT Visits.
If the dropout, non -evaluable ABPM, or non -adherence rates are higher than expected, enrollment will 
continue until the required number of evaluable subjects in the per protocol population is reached.  If 
the SD is higher than the expected SD, an evaluation will be made to adjust the number of evaluable 
subjects if necessary.
Blinded Sample Size Re -Estimation
With a sample size of 171 subjects in the per protocol population, the study is powered at 90% if the SD 
of change from Baseline to EOT in systolic ABP is [ADDRESS_633551] for the study, a review and estimate of the SD will be conducted when approximately 70% of the 
planned subjects in the per protocol population (i.e., 120 subjects) have completed the EOT Visit.  It will 
be performed by [CONTACT_492522].  If the estimated SD is larger than [ADDRESS_633552] (IRB)
The protocol, informed consent, recruitment materials, and all subject materials will be submitted to the 
IRB for review and approval.  App roval of both the protocol and the informed consent form(s) must be 
obtained before any subject is enrolled.  Any amendment to the protocol will require review and 
approval by [CONTACT_3484].  In addition, all chang es to the 
informed consent will be IRB approved.
8.[ADDRESS_633553] of the Study
The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, Operations Manual, International Council 
for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Us e (ICH) guidelines, 
applicable regulations, and guidelines governing clinical study conduct and the ethical principles that

Previous Protocol Versions
Protocol Date
Version 1.0 20 November 2019
Version 2.0 19 February 2020
The purpose of this version (Version 3.0) is to change the lower limit of the DBP range from 70 mmHg to 
60 mmHg in criterion number 5 (Section 5.1).Rationale: This was to optimize the DBP range .
The purpose of Version 2.[ADDRESS_633571] minor clerical errors for consistency throughout the protocol 
and to clari fy information in addition to the following:
Eligibility criterion number 4 (Section 5.1) was corrected to indicate that PSA values must be ≤ 3.0 ng/dL 
in men treated with 5 -alpha reductase inhibitors .  Rationale:   This was to correct < 3.0 ng/dL.
A more detailed description of what constitutes an AE was added to Section 6.1.  Rationale:   
Clarification of AE definition, including worsening of pre -existing conditions.
The statistical analysis of the primary endpoint was described in g reater detail, and sensitivity analyses 
were added to Section 7.4.  Rationale:   Clarification.
In the Operations Manual Section 6.2, it was specified that the study monitor is to return unused study 
drug to the depot for destruction.  Rationale:   This was to clarify that sites are not to destroy study drug 
on site.
In the Operations Manual Section 6.4 clarifies the titration notifications .  Reference to the IRT wa s 
removed, as the IRT is not used for dosing titration notification.  Rationale:   Clarification.

Please refer to Section 4.1.
3.5 Pharmacokinetic Sampling
Blood samples for analysis of testosterone (T) will be collected at time p oints specified in Section 2.1.
Additional information on the collection, handling/processing, disposition, and measurement methods 
can be found in the lab manual.
3.6 12-Lead Electrocardiogram
A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed at the designated study visit as specified in 
Section 2.1.
The ECG should be performed prior to blood collection and after the subject has rested in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_492499] 5 minutes.
The ECG will be interpreted by [CONTACT_492527] ("local reader").  The local 
read er from the site will sign and date all ECG tracings and will provide his/her global interpretation as a 
written comment on the tracing using the following categories:
Normal ECG
Abnormal ECG –not clinically significant
Abnormal ECG –clinically significa nt
Only the local reader's evaluation of the ECG will be collected and documented in the subject's source 
documents.  The automatic machine reading (i.e., machine -generated measurements and interpretation 
that are automatically printed on the ECG tracing) will not be collected.
Electrocardiogram with QT interval corrected for HR using Fridericia -corrected QT interval (QTcF) should 
be reported (or calculated) and documented in the source documents and later transcribed on to the 
appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF), if QTcF prolongation is observed (> 430 msec).  In 
addition, any clinically significant findings will be documented in the source documents and later 
transcribed on to the appropriate eCRF.  Each signed original ECG may be reviewed by t he responsible 
site monitor and kept with subject's source documents on site.
If there are clinically significant findings, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_492528].  The subject may have a repeat ECG at any time during the study as warranted 
based on the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].

Height and weight will be measured at SV2 only for calculation of body mass index (BMI); the subject 
will not wear shoes.  Body weight will be measured on a calibrated scale shortly after the subject 
empties his bladder.  Subject should wear light indoor clothing with pockets empty and without shoes, 
belts, jewelry or other accessories.  Weight may be recorded in kilogram (kg) to the nearest 0.1 kg or in 
pounds (lb) to the ne arest 0.[ADDRESS_633579] height in meters 
squared (kg/m2) and should be calculated to the nearest one -tenth unit.  The BMI calculation should be 
recorded in the Screening Visit source documents and case report form.  The following formulas will be 
used to convert to metric units for calculation of BMI: 
Pound (lb) ÷ 2.2 = Kilogram (kg) 
Inch (in) × 0.0254 = Mete r (m) 
Body mass index calculations will be made by [CONTACT_492529]2 using the 
following formula: 
Body mass index (kg/m2) = weight (kg) ÷ [height (m) at Screening Visit]2
3.8 Vital Signs
Vital sign determinations of HR, RR, and oral bod y temperature will be obtained at visits as specified in 
Section 2.1.  Measurements should be assessed consistently throughout the study.  Vital sig ns 
measurements determined at the Pre -ABPM assessment will serve as baseline.
Blood pressure (BP) and HR should be measured after the subject has been sitting for at least [ADDRESS_633580] measurement of 
arterial BP of the AHA.34

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].3.9 Physical Examination
A complete physical examination will be performed at SV2.  The physical examination at SV2 will serve 
as the baseline physical examination for clinical assessment.  All other physical examinations as 
indicated in Section 2.1will be symptom -directed examinations.
Any significant physical examination findings not present at Baseline and detected on subsequent 
examinations will be documented and any significant findings will be reported.  All findings will be 
captured on the appropriate eCRF page.
When deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093], a symptom -directed physical exami nation can be 
performed at the Unscheduled Visit.
Digital Rectal Examination (DRE)
A digital rectal exam (DRE) will be performed at SV2 and should be performed after the PSA blood draw.  
The DRE will not be required if the subject had a previous normal DRE within [ADDRESS_633581] while on site after all other Day 1 Visit procedures 
are completed and only after a valid ABPM assessment has been confirmed.  Thereafter, study drug will 
be dispensed at designated study visits during the Treatment Period.  At the designated scheduled study 
visits, subjects will return to the site to obtain new supply of study drug and re turn used/unused study 
drug packaging supply.  The unused study drug returned by [CONTACT_492530] -dispensed.  The 
investigator or designee will access the IRT system at each study visit prior to dispensing study drug to 
the subject.  Study drug c annot be dispensed without using the IRT system.  Study pump bottles will be 
labeled with their unique pump bottle kit number.
3.11 Clinical Laboratory Tests
The blood samples for serum chemistry tests (and sex steroids) will be collected following a minimum 
8-hour fast (with exception of SV1, which may be non- fasting).  At the Day [ADDRESS_633582] value is outside the reference range and the investigator considers the laboratory 
result to be clinically significant, the investigator will:
repeat the test to verify the out -of-range value;
follow the out -of-range value to a satisfactory clinical r esolution; or
discontinue the subject from the study or require the subject to receive treatment; in this case, 
the laboratory result will be recorded as a study -specific adverse event (AE) (See Section 6.1 of 
the protocol).
All Screening laboratory resul ts must be reviewed, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_9940] -
investigator prior to enrollment.  Subjects will not be enrolled into the study if laboratory or other 
Screening result abnormalities are deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_9940]-investigator.

c. Serum creatinine will be collected at SV2 only and used to calculate eGFR (central laboratory performing calculations).  An 
eGFR assessment (CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_8850]) will be performed.
d. Testosterone alone will be measured for eligibility at SV1 and SV2, and for titration at Weeks [ADDRESS_633584] ick urinalysis will be completed by [CONTACT_492531]2.  Specified abnormal macroscopic 
urinalyses defined as leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones, or blood greater than negative, or glucose 
greater than normal will be followed up with a micros copic analysis (only if needed) at the central 
laboratory.
Sex Steroids
Blood samples for serum T level, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and estradiol (E2) will be collected at the 
visits as specified in Section 2.1.  Testosterone samples obtained at the Weeks 2 and 4 Visits will be used 
for titration of the T study drug dose.  For information on Screening serum T level, refer to the study 
inclusion criter ia.  After study enrollment, pre -dose serum T level samples will be collected at 24 hours 
(±2 hours) of the last applied dose for the purpose of titration.  For example, if the last applied dose was 
at 11:00 am the day prior to the study visit, the blood sample should be taken between 9:00 am to 
1:00 pm.  Subjects should not apply their regularly scheduled study drug dose prior to the in -person 
study visits as defined in Section 2.1.  Subjects should receive a reminder to apply the dose 24 hours 
before the study visit, even if that is not their usual study drug application time.
The following subjects should be rescheduled within 1 week for a serum T level if their serum T cannot 
be drawn 24 -hours (± 2 hours) from the last applied dose:
Subjects who apply a dose less than 22 hours from the time of serum T sample collection.
Subjects who apply a dose greater than [ADDRESS_633585] a T < 300 ng/dL at SV1 will have a PSA eval uated from that same sample.  At 
Screening, the PSA must be ≤ 3.0 ng/mL (≤ 1.5 ng/mL in men receiving 5 -alpha reductase inhibitors).

participation in the study.
3.13 Unscheduled Visits
An Unscheduled Visit may occur for a variety of reasons.  During Unscheduled Visits, concomitant 
medication, AE assessments, vital signs (including office BP), and a symptom -directed physical 
examination (only i f needed) should be performed.  Blood and urine samples may be obtained for the 
laboratory tests listed in Section 3, or for other tests, at the inv estigator's discretion.
If a blood sample is collected for PSA or hematocrit at the Unscheduled Visit and there is an increase in 
absolute values as specified in Section 5.[ADDRESS_633587].   The start 
of each ABPM 24 -hour collection is to be performed around the same time of day for each visit, 
between 06:00 –11:00.
Study sites will be provided with a SpaceLabs ABP monitor from the cardiac safety core lab.  The ABPM 
recordings will be transmitted to the core lab for centralized management of the data.
The ABP monitor will be set to automatic ally measure and record BP every [ADDRESS_633588] by [CONTACT_779]; the subject leaves and then returns the following day for ABP monitor removal.
At the completion of each ABPM [ADDRESS_633589] to return to the clinical site to repeat the ABPM 24 -hour collection within 7 days.  In this 
case, Day 1 Visit would follow completion of the repeat Baseline ABPM and the End of Treatment (EOT) 
Visit would fol low completion of the repeat Week [ADDRESS_633590]; however, the site will be unmasked to the ABPM validity report.  The investigator or designee 
will assess the validity of ABPM data based on the results that are immediately available on site o nce 
data is downloaded from the monitoring device, to the study configured laptop, utilizing ABPM specific 
software.  PI [INVESTIGATOR_492500] a repeat ABPM 24 -hour collection is required.
Sites will receive training on the use of the ABPM technology and software platform provided by [CONTACT_442004].  Additional information related to the ABPM procedures for the study will be provided in the 
ABPM Site Manual and ABPM Quick Reference Guide provided by [CONTACT_492532].
The following ABPM procedures will be performed over a 2 -day period:
First Day:  Application
The BP cuff of the ABP monitor will be fitted, preferably on the subject's non -dominant arm, by 
[CONTACT_492533].  The designated study site staff will use the 
24-h ourABPM Application Worksheet provided by [CONTACT_492534].  
Verification readings will be obtained prior to the beginning of test reading.  The subject wil l be 
instructed regarding ABPM procedures and the ABPM Subject Instruction /Error Codes Handout provided 
by [CONTACT_492535].
Second Day:  Removal
The subject will return to the study site and the ABP monitor will be removed on ly after it has been 
worn for a minimum of 24 hours from the "Beginning of Test" reading.  The ABPM data will be 
downloaded and quality control evaluated on site, using the study specific ABPM software.  The quality 
control criteria for the specific monito ring will be immediately displayed on the ABPM laptop.  If an 
ABPM 24 -hour collection does not meet the study specific criteria ("fails"), the designated site staff 
should contact [CONTACT_492536] a repeat ABPM 24 -hour 
collection is required for that specific ABPM Visit.
SpaceLabs System
The SpaceLabs [ZIP_CODE] ABP monitor is a small, light -weight unit with batteries, pouch, and strap and is 
designed to take up to 240 BP measurements (range:  systolic 60 to 260 mmHg; dia stolic 30 to 200; 
mean 40 to 230 mmHg) and HR measurements (range:  40 to 180 beats) for a [ADDRESS_633591] information to be incorporated in the analysis, the time format, the 
measur ement interval, the presence or absence of the audible monitor tone during specified periods of 
the recording period (e.g., sleep), event code display and whether or not to display data on the digital 
display for reading by [CONTACT_423].
Selection of Cuff S ize for ABPM
Correct measurement of BP for ABPM requires the use of a cuff that is appropriate to the size of the 
non-dominant upper arm.  The non -dominant arm will be preferred for consistency.
Page [ADDRESS_633592]
The ABPM vendor (Bioclinica) will provide the site staff with access to electronic training modules and a 
Study Site Training Manual inclusive of subject instructions for use.
3.15 End of Study/Study Completion
The last visit/procedure/contact (e.g., office visit or phone call) with the subje ct will serve as the End of 
Study (EOS) for each subject.  For subjects completing at least 16 weeks of treatment on study drug, 
there will be a follow up phone call in approximately 30 days.  For subjects prematurely discontinuing 
study drug prior to Week 16/EOT, the follow up phone call at approximately [ADDRESS_633593] udy 
drug administration until the end of the study/study completion.  Study procedure -related non -serious 
AEs and SAEs will be collected from the time the subject signs the study -specific informed consent until 
[ADDRESS_633594] withdraws consent for study participation, or until the final study -
related communication (e.g., phone call at the end of the study or final study communication in subjects 
truly considered LTFU, whichever occurs first).
AE = adverse event; AESI = adverse event of special interest; d/c = discontinuation; SAE = serious adverse event

6.[ADDRESS_633597]
The starting dose of AndroGel 1.62% is 40.5 mg of T (2 pump actuations, applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_492502]).  Based on serum T levels obtained at the Weeks 2 and 4 visits, subjects will be titrated up 
or down by 20.25 m g if their serum T levels are < 350 ng/dL or > 750 ng/dL, respectively.  The final 
titrated doses will be 20.[ADDRESS_633598] time.
Titration Instructions
Titration will be based on the predose morning total serum T concentrations.  Subjects will return for 
predose serum T assessment 24 hours (± 2 hours) after the last applied dose according to the schedul e 
in Section 2.1.  Subjects will be asked when they last applied study drug.  Subjects should be rescheduled 
within 1 week for a serum T level if th eir serum T cannot be drawn 24 hours (± 2 hours) from the last 
applied dose.  Within approximately [ADDRESS_633599]'s dose may be 
titrated up or down in 20.25 mg increments or remain on the previously assigned dose, based on 
prespecified criteria ( Table 2).  No dose can be titrated below 20.25 mg or above 81.0 mg during the 
course of the study.

Between 350 ng/dL and 750 ng/dL, inclusive No change:  continue on current dose
Less than 350 ng/dL Increase daily dose by 20.25 mg (one pump actuation)
If the serum total T is > 750 ng/dL, the dose should be decreased by 1 actuation .  If the serum total T is 
<350 ng/dL, the dose should be increased by 1 actuation.  If the serum total T is between 350 ng/dL and 
750 ng/dL ,inclusive, the dose should remain the same .  The site staff will contact [CONTACT_423] (by [CONTACT_648], 
via email, etc.) and instruct the subject to reduce the dose by 1study drug actuation, to increase by 
1study drug actuation, or to remain on the same dose of the study drug.
If the serum T is > 750 ng/dL even after down -titration to the lowest dose, the results should be 
confirmed by a repeat blood sample by [CONTACT_2237].  If the rep eat total T is > 750 ng/dL, 
subject may need to be discontinued from study drug.
If subjects are instructed by [CONTACT_492539] 2 and Week 4 titration visits, they will be 
required to cross out the previous instructions on pump bottle l abel specifying their previous number(s) 
of pumps/actuations per day or dose and fill in their updated number of pumps/actuations per day or 
dose.
Should a subject's dose require titration, site personnel will communicate this to the subjects within

on site so that the site staff can observe the proper administration of study drug.
On subsequent study visit days, subjects should not apply their daily dose until after a sample is 
collected to measure serum T (See Section 2.1for titration study visits).  Following sample collection, 
subjects will apply study drug while on site.  Subjects should be rescheduled within 1 week for a serum T 
level if their serum T cannot be drawn 24 hours (± 2 hours) from last applied dose (see Section 3.11 ).
The subject will self -administer study drug once daily in the morning to the shoulder(s) and upper 
arm(s).  The study drug s hould not be administered to other parts of the body, including abdomen, 
genitals, chest, armpi[INVESTIGATOR_10022] (axillae), or knees.  See Figure 1for acceptable appli cation sites.
Page [ADDRESS_633601] regarding adherence to the assigned regimens.  A weight measurement of the study drug pump 
bottle will be conducted.  Study drug lot number, the date that the study drug bottle(s) were 
dispensed/returned, and the weight of the returned study drug bottles will be recorded.  The bottle 
weight of the returned study drug bottles will be compared to an average bottle weight to determine 
adherence.  The number of doses that should have occurred between visits will be calculated.  Subjects 
with adherence values below 85% or above 120% adherence will be re -instructed on proper use and 
informed of the importance of adherence to continue in the study.  An overall accountability of study 
drug will be performed and verified by [CONTACT_26282]/designee.

determine the arm circumference (measured inches or cm).
2.Select a proper cuff size based on arm circumference. 
The ideal cuff bladder length is ≥ [ADDRESS_633606]'s arm circumference.  The ideal cuff bladder 
width is ≥ [ADDRESS_633607]'s arm circumference.
Key Steps for Proper BP 
Measurements Specific Instructions
Step 1:  Properly prepare the subject 1. Have the subject relax, sitting in a chair (feet flat on the floor and 
legs uncrossed, back straight and supported) for > [ADDRESS_633608] is sitting or lying on an 
examining table.
Step 2:  Use proper technique for BP 
measurements1. Use a n automated oscillometric device.
2. Support the subject's arm (e.g., resting on a flat surface such as a 
desk or table, with the upper arm at heart level).
3. Position the middle of the cuff on the subject's upper arm at the 
level of the right atrium (the midpo int of the sternum).
4. Use the correct cuff size, such that the bladder encircles 80% of the 
arm, and note if a larger -or smaller -than –normal cuff size is used.
Step 3:  Take the proper BP 
measurements1. At the first visit, record BP in both arms.  Use the arm that gives the 
higher reading for subsequent readings.
2. Separate repeated measurements by [CONTACT_3450] 2 minutes. 
Step 4:  Properly document accurate 
BP readings1. Record SBP and DBP. 
2. Document the time of most recent BP medication taken before 
measurements.
Step 5:  Average the readings Two or [ADDRESS_633609] 2readings differ by [CONTACT_26813] 5 mmHg, additional readings will be obtained and averaged.  The 
average BP reading should be recorded.
BP = blood pressure; DBP = diasto lic blood pressure; SBP = systolic blood pressure

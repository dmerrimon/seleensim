See Section 4.4Study  Treatments for detail.
The following treatment will be used:
GamaSTAN (Immune Globulin ([Human]): a 15 to 18% protein solution of human 
Immunoglobulin G (IgG)for intramuscular (IM)injection
2.2 Relevant Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Trials
2.2.1 Pre-exposure Prophylaxis for Hepatitis A Infection
The World Health Organization estimates an annual total of 1.5 million clinical cases of 
hepatitis A infection worldwide, but seroprevalence d ata indicate that tens of millions of 
hepatitis A virus ( HAV) infections occur each y ear (1). Since the recommendation of HAV 
vaccination in 2006, vaccination rates and evidence of vaccine- induced immunity  in young 
persons have increased in the past decade (2, 3). Yet hepatitis A vaccination coverage levels 
remain lower than those for other routi nely recommended vaccines (4). Additionally , many  
older adults remain unvaccinated and susceptible to infection. International travel is the most 
commonly  reported risk for HAV infection (5). After adjusting for under -ascertainment and 
under -reporting (6), the estimated number of new HAV infections in the US in 2015 was 
2,800 (95% confidence interval [CI ] =1,900–3,100) (7).
Immune globulin (IG) provides protection against HAV infection through passive transfer of 
antibody . Efficacy  is greatest when IG is ad ministered earl y in the incubation period; when 
administered later, IG often only attenuates the clinical expression of hepatitis A infection (8).
Protocol GC1703 - Amendment [ADDRESS_161417] HAV infection. GamaSTAN S/D is one such licensed product that is 
commonly  administered to provide pre- exposure prophy laxis for persons travelling to areas 
with endemic hepatitis A (9). GamaSTAN S/D and GamaSTAN are both purified using a 
procedure based on the Cohn- Oncley  process (10, 11), but GamaSTAN uses a 
capry late/chromatography  purification step.
2.2.2 Rationale for Clinical Investigation of GamaSTAN
GamaSTAN is manufactured from human plasma employ ing capry late/chromatography  steps 
in the purification schem e. This production process y ields a final IgG product that is purer 
and more closel y reflects the IgG subclass distribution found in plasma than earlier IgG 
products (12, 13). GamaSTAN is being developed for the same indications as those of 
GamaSTAN S/D in cluding pre -exposure proph ylaxis for persons travelling to areas with 
endemic HAV.
2.[ADDRESS_161418], it 
may carry  a risk of transmittin g infectious agents (e.g., viruses and, theoretically, the 
Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease (CJD) agent). No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD 
have ever been identified for other products manufactured with the same 
capry late/chromatography  purification process. The risk that GamaSTAN can transmit an 
infectious agent has been reduced b y screening plasma donors for prior exposure, testing 
donated plasma, and b y the inclusion of steps in the manufacturing process with the 
demonstrated capacit y to inactiv ate and/or remove pathogenic agents. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_126863], it may  carry  a risk of transmitting infectious agents. (9)
There is clinical evidence of an association between the administration of all 
immunoglobulins and thromboembolic events such as my ocardial infarction, stroke, 
pulmonary  embolism and deep vein thrombosis. Therefore, caution should be exercised when 
prescribing and administering immunoglobulins . Thrombosis may  occur even in the absence 
of known risk factors.
GamaSTAN should be given with ca ution to subjects with a history  of prior sy stemic allergic 
reactions following the administration of human IG preparations (14). GamaSTAN should not 
be given to subjects with isolated immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency . Such persons have the 
potential for developi[INVESTIGATOR_142049]. Other antibodies in the 
GamaSTAN preparation may  interfere with the response to live virus vaccines such as 
measles, mumps, polio, or rubella, and varicella. Therefore, use of such vaccines should be 
deferred until approximately  [ADDRESS_161419] (15
).
Protocol GC1703 - Amendment [ADDRESS_161420] been reported following the injection of human 
IGpreparations. Anaph ylaxis is more likely  to occur if GamaSTAN is given intra venously ; 
therefore, GamaSTAN must be administered only  intramuscularl y.
As with all preparations administered b y the IM route, bleeding complications may be 
encountered in subjects with thrombocy topenia or other bleeding disorders.
Grifols 'licensed Immun e Globulin (Human) product, GamaSTAN S/D, is commonly  
administered as proph ylaxis to provide active immunization following exposure to HAV, to 
provide pre -exposure prophy laxis for persons travelling to areas with endemic hepatitis A. 
GamaSTAN S/D is also i ndicated to prevent or modify  measles, passive immunization 
against varicella, and prophy laxis in pregnant females exposed to rubella. The immediate 
administration of an IG product is intended to provide immediate passive virus neutralizing 
antibody  covera ge (2).
Since the study  treatment is not being given to subjects to treat any  symptoms or illness, 
there will be no direct medical benefit from participation in this trial.
2.4 Description of and Justification for the Route of A dministration, 
Dosage, Dosage Re gimen, and Treatment Period(s)
2.4.1 Administration of Investigational Products
A single 0.2 mL/kg dose of the investigational product ( IP)will be injected intramuscularl y 
in the anterolateral aspects of the upper thigh or the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.
Doses over 5mL are to be divided and injected into several muscle sites to reduce local pain 
and discomfort.
The gluteal region should not be used as an injection site due to the risk of injury  to the 
sciatic nerve. The IP is not to be administered subcutaneousl y or intravenously .
2.4.2 Justification for Selection of Doses/Timing of Investigational Products
Recently  the Food and Drug Administration (FDA )approved and instituted an anti -HAV titer 
specification (Not Less Than >20 IU/mL) and revised dosing fo r GamaSTAN S/D. Due to 
the recently  instituted titer specifications and revised dosing, Grifols committed to the FDA 
to evaluate anti -HAV titers following IM administration at the recommended dose of 
0.2mL/kg in non- HAV (seronegative) healthy  volunteers. An IMdose of 0.2 mL /kg was 
chosen, as it is the recommended dose for proph ylaxis prior to exposure to hepatitis A for 
persons traveling to areas endemic with the virus .
Peak levels of IgG are obtained approximately  2 day s after IM injection of immunoglobu lins 
(12). The half -life of IgG in the circulation of individuals with normal IgG levels is 23 day s (9). 
In this stud y, a 150 -day follow -up period is chosen as it represents approximately  
5half-lives.

Protocol GC1703 - Amendment 4 22 Jan 2018 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 40of 578.3.3 Adverse Event Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product or stud y treatment and which does not necessaril y 
have a causal relationship with this administration. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an y abnormal laboratory  finding, for example), sy mptom, or 
disease temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product. In this study , all local site reactions are to be considered as 
AEs.
[IP_ADDRESS] Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions/Adverse Reactions
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product or study  treatment related to 
any dose should be considered suspected ADRs. The phrase "responses to a medicinal 
product"means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product or study  treatment and 
an AE is at least a reasonable possibility .
In the framework of this study , a suspected ADR for which there is a reason to conclude that 
the drug caused the event will be labeled as an adverse reaction (AR); thus, ARs are a subset 
of suspected ADRs.
An AEwill be considered a Suspected ADR when either the sponsor or anInvestigator 
considers that the drug migh t have caused the adverse event.
8.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Event
AnInvestigator is required to provide a causalit y assessment for each AE reported to the 
Sponsor. The Sponsor will consider anInvestigator 's causalit y assessment and also provide 
its own assessment .
Causal relationship to the study  drug will be established according to medical judgment on 
whether there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the AE and the
IPadministration :
AnInvestigator must determine and classify the AE causalit y according to the following 
categories:
Unrelated/Not related: there is no t areasonable possibility  of causal relationship between 
the AE and the stud y drug.
Possibly related: there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study  drug 
and the AE .
Definitively related: there is a reason to conclude that the study  drug caused the AE .
Protocol GC1703 - Amendment 4 22 Jan 2018 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 41of 57Criteria to assess the causal relationship should take into account of the following conditions: 
1)a plausible temporal sequence from the study  drug administration to the AE onset; 2) 
whether the event follows a known response pattern to the suspected treatment; 3) whether 
the AE could be reasonably  explained by  [CONTACT_423] 's clinical state, comorbidities, or 
concomitant medications, as well as 4) the occurrence of i mprovement on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/reducing 
the treatment (positive dechallenge) and/or reappearance of the event on repeated exposure 
(positive rechallenge).
For expedited safety  reporting purposes, AEs assessed as either "definitively related" or 
"possibly  related "will be considered POTENTIALLY RELATED or just REL ATED.
For an y subject, all AEs that occur at an y time from the beginning of IP administration until 
the final visit of the clinical trial will be considered treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs).
8.3.5 Severity of Adver se Event or Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction
AEs and suspected ADRs will be classified depending on their severit y according to the 
following definitions:
Mild : an AE which is well tolerated by  [CONTACT_423], causing minimum degree of malaise and 
without affe cting normal activities.
Moderate : an AE that interferes with the subject’s normal activities.
Severe : an AE that prevents the subject from performing their normal activities.
AE and suspected ADR severit y gradation must be distinguished from AE and suspec ted 
ADR seriousness gradation, which is defined according to event consequence. For example, 
headache can be mild, moderate or severe but not necessarily serious in all these cases.
AnInvestigator will be responsible for assessing the AE and suspected ADR intensity  during 
the clinical trial, taking into account current criteria included in this section.
8.3.[ADDRESS_161450] is considered " unexpected "if the nature, seriousness, severit y or 
outcome of the reaction(s) is not consistent with the reference information. The expectedness 
shall be determined b y the Sponsor according to the reference document (i.e., IB) for an y 
serious 
suspected ADRs (potentially  related SAEs) for expedited safety  reporting purposes .
8.3.[ADDRESS_161451] is considered " serious "if, in the view of either anInvestigator or 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:
•Death
Protocol GC1703 - Amendment 4 22 Jan 2018 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 42of 57•Life-threatening AE (life-threatening in the definition of " serious" refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hy potheticall y might have caused death if it were more severe)
•In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73606]
•A persistent or significant incapacit y or substantial disruption of the ability  to conduct 
normal life functions
•A congenital anomal y/birth defect
• An important medical event (important medical event in the definition of " serious "refers 
to those events which may not be immediatel y life -threatening, or result in death, or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but from medical and scientific judgment may  jeopardize the sub ject 
or/and may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed above)
*Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_142051] y hospi[INVESTIGATOR_142052] 24 hours. 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_142053] S AEs:
-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_142054]
-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_142055] a routine procedure 
followed b y the center
-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a survey  visit, annual ph ysicals, or social reasons
- e lective or pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a pre -existing condition that had not 
worsened from Baseline (e.g. elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to start of 
the study )
-admissions not associated with an AE (e.g. social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_142056])
This definition permits either the Sponsor or anInvestigator to decide whether an event is 
"serious ". If either the Sponsor or anInvestigator believes that the event is serious, the event 
must b e considered "serious" and evaluated b y the S ponsor for expedited reporting.
8.3.[ADDRESS_161452] has signed the ICF through the final visit (i.e., end of 
study) must be fully  recorded in the subject 's eCRF as well as in the medical record. If no 
AE has occurred during the study  period, this should also be indicated in the eCRF. Each 
SAE must be fully  recorded on the SAE Report Form as well as in the medical records and 
indicated as serious in the eCRF.
It is the responsibility  of anInvestigator to ensure that AEs including SAEs are appropriatel y 
recorded.
At each visit, AEs will be elicited b y asking the individual a non -leading question such as 
"Do you feel different in any way  since the last visit? "  Moreover , AEs will also be collected 
through directl y observed events or spontaneously volunteered b y the subject. Clearl y related 
Protocol GC1703 - Amendment [ADDRESS_161453] be recorded in the AE eCRF:
• T he verbatim term (a diagnosis is preferred)
• D ate/time of onset
• D ate/time of resolution
• S everity  (mild, moderate, severe)
• C ausality  (unrelated, possibly  related , definite ly related)*
• S eriousness (y es, no)
• A ction taken (with regard to I P)
• O ther action (to treat the event)
• O utcome and sequel (follow -up on AE)
*Causality  assessment will be made only  when the AE occurs after the subject has initiated at 
least one infusion of the IP. An AE occurring before subject's exposure to IP will be alway s 
labeled as "unrelated".
In addition to an Investigator’s own description of the AEs, each AE will be encoded 
according to the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities ( MedDRA®).
For exampl e, a laboratory  test abnormality  considered clinically  significant , e.g., causing the 
subject to withdraw from the study , requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical 
manifestations, or judged 
clinically  significant in the context of the subject 's medi cal history  
by [CONTACT_142069], should be reported as an AE. Each event must be described in detail along 
with start and stop dates, severit y, relationship to IP, action taken and outcome. Each event 
must be adequatel y supported by [CONTACT_142070] 's medical or case 
file.
8.3.9 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any SAE (see 
section 8.3.7) that occurs after signing the study ICF through the final visit 
(
i.e.,end of study) must be expeditiously  reported whether or not considered attributable to 
the study  drug.
SAEs will be rep orted using the designated SAE Report Form. When anInvestigator 
becomes aware of an SAE, she/he must submit a completed, signed and dated SAE Report 
Form (in English) within 24 hours to the Sponsor by  [CONTACT_6968]/fax. The date of this SAE 
discovery  by [CONTACT_142071] (i .e.,medical 
records).
Protocol GC1703 - Amendment [ADDRESS_161454] also be supplied to the 
Sponsor in a timely  manner (within 3 day s from its identification or within 24 hours for 
relevant new information) b y means of the SAE Report Form. In addition, the Sponsor or 
contract research organization (CRO) may request additional information and/ or reports.
All SAE Report Forms must be reported b y e-mail to:
Grifols Global Pharmacovigilance
When required, and according to local law and regulations, SAEs must be reported to the 
IRB/EC and regulatory  authorities.
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Pregnancy
While pregnancy  itself is not a true " AE,"pregnancy  occurring in a clinical study  must be 
followed, to collect information regarding the experiences of gestation and pregnancy  with IP 
exposure. An Investigator must report any  pregnancy  that occurs in a female study  subject / 
partner of a male stud y subject subsequent to first treatment exposure 
to the Final Study  Visit 
(Day  150)/Earl y Discontinuation Visit . Any  female subject who becomes pregnant durin g the 
study  will be discontinued from IP treatment and will be followed for pregnancy  outcome.
A pregnancy  not verified 
prior to study  treatment administration but occurring during the 
course of the stud y will be not considered an AE, unless a relation to the study  drug is 
suspected. In an y case, a Pregnancy Report Form must be completed and sent as soon as 
possible to the Sponsor. A cop y of the form should be filed at the stud y site for follow -up 
until the end of the pregnancy .Any pregnancy  must be followed b y anInvestigator until 
delivery  or to the end of pregnancy . Any anomalies, complications, abnormal outcomes, or 
birth defect observed in the child must be reported as an SAE within 24 hours of Investigator 
or study  personne l's first knowledge.
Please use the email address or fax numbers (back up only )in section [IP_ADDRESS] for reporting 
pregnancy .
8.[ADDRESS_161455] has 
been resolved. If an AE/suspected ADR/SAE is present when the subject has completed the 
study , the course of the e vent must be followed until the final outcome is known, or the event 
has been stabilized and no further change is expected and anInvestigator decides that no 
further follow -up is necessary .

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
Safety  anal ysis will be primarily  focused on a descriptive anal ysis of suspected ADRs. Safet y 
assessment will be based on the prevalence of suspected ADRs that occurred during the 
clinical trial.
Suspected ADRs are the AEs with causality  assessment of possibl yor definitely  related. 
Adverse reactions are the AEs with causality assessment of definitely related.
Protocol GC1703 - Amendment 4 22 Jan 2018 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 46of 57Adverse events will be coded and classified using MedDRA®terms (s ystem or gan class and 
preferred terms).
Adverse events will be classified as TEAEs or non -TEAEs depending on the comparison of 
AE onset date/time with the start date/time of study treatment with the IP. A TEAE will be 
defined as an AE which occurs between the beginning of the stud y drug injection and the 
final visit of the clinical trial. A non -TEAE will be defined as an AE which occurs prior to 
the start of study  treatment. Non -TEA Es and TEAEs will be summarized separatel y.
All AEs will be summarized by  [CONTACT_142072], and they  will

9.7.1 Safety Population:
The safety population consists of all subjects who received any amount of study drug.
9.7.2 Evaluable Population :
The evaluable population consists of all subjects who received the entire dose of IP and had 
no major protocol deviations that would impact the efficacy  anal ysis up to Day 60. An y 
deviations from the protoco l will be recorded in the protocol deviation list and evaluated 
before database lock.
9.7.3 PK population :
The PK population consists of all subjects who received the entire dose of the IP and who
provided sufficient 
plasma and/or serum concentration data to fac ilitate calculation of PK 
parameters. Subjects who do not complete the PK sampling schedule may  be included in the 
PK analy sis onl y for the PK parameters that are judged not to be affected by [CONTACT_142077](s). This decision is to be documented and app roved b y the sponsor before the start of 
the sample anal ysis by  [CONTACT_142078] .
10DIRECT A CCESS TO SOU RCE DA TA/DOCUMENTS
The data will be recorded and kept current in eCRFs b y the study site personnel directl y 
responsible for the information and reviewed for completeness b y the monitor. Grifols 
personnel or designee can review the records.
In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the monitor must have direct access to the 
Investigator ’s source documentation in order to verify  the data recorded in th e eCRFs for 
consistency  and to verify adherence to the protocol, and the completeness, consistency , and 
accuracy  of data entered. "Source documentation" includes individual subject files, separate 
from the eCRFs, which should be maintained and include visi t dates, laboratory  results, 
concomitant treatment, vital signs, ECGs, medical history , examinations, AEs, IP dispensing 
logs, and other notes as appropriate. AnInvestigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to 
ensure that an y problems noted during the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.

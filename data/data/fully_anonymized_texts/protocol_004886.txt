Good Clinical Practice  (GCP) Guideline. 
1.[ADDRESS_807923] all individuals with dementia exhibit neuropsyc hiatric  symptoms over the 
course of the disease ( Steinberg et al. 2008; Lanctot et al. 2017), causing distress for the 
patient and their caregivers, as they are “ associated with impairment in activities of daily 
living, poor quality of life, earlier instit utionalization, accelerated disease progression, 
increased mortality, caregiver stress, and increased cost of care” (Lanctot et al. 2017). Psychosis, apathy, agitation, depression and sleep disturbances are common neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The emergence of neuropsychiatric 
symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_387328]: “(1) irritability, depression, and nighttime behavior changes; (2) anxiety, appetite changes, agitation, and apathy; and (3) elation, motor disturbances, hallucinations, delusions, and disinhibition” ( Masters et al. 2015 ). 
Psychosis is a common neuropsychiatric symptom in patients with neurode generative 
diseases, particularly in patients with dementia associated with neurodegenerative disease. Psychotic symptom s are typi[INVESTIGATOR_609310] (DLB), very common in 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and occur, although to a lesser degree, in vas cular dementia (VaD) 
and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) ( Table 1–1 ). In one study, 67% of patients  with dementia  
had psychotic symptoms ( Ballard et al. 1995). It is also a frequent complication of 
Parkinson’s disease patients, with or without dementia. The psychosis in neurodegenerative diseases is typi[INVESTIGATOR_387330], with delusions often consisting of 
the reactions or rationaliz ations that follow. However, delusions do occur as distinct 
phenomena, often taking the form of misinterpretations of real or imaginary objects, 
delusions of infidelity or abandonment, or beliefs such as thinking that spouses or relatives are duplicates of  the original person. Among AD patients, delusions are more common than 
hallucinations ( Fischer et al. 2016; Ballard  et al. 1995) while hallucinations are more 
common in patients with  DLB and Parkinson’s disease dementia. Patients with psychosis 
who had a clinical diagnosis of AD are often found on autopsy to have Lewy bodies or vascular lesions ( Fischer et al. 2016; Kim  et al. 2017).

There is evidence that psychotic features in Parkinson’s disease, AD, and DLB are associated 
with polymorphisms in the serotonergic pathway genes, in particular the 5HTTLPR polymorphism in SLA6A4, which codes for the serotonin transporter ( Sweet et  al. 2001; 
Quaranta et  al. 2009;  DeMichele-Sweet and Sweet 2010;  Creese et  al. 2014 ). This 
observation raises the possibility that there is a common biological link among those dementia patients who have psychotic features, regardless of subtype, and provides mechanistic support for the finding that pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256], a compound with serotonergic but not 
dopaminergic activity, can have an effect on delusions and hallucinations. 
Treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with neurodegenerative disease 
represents an area of high u nmet need. There are no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_387331] . A substantial number of these patients receive off- label 
antipsychotic drug treatment to control their symptoms. However, many of these drugs have not demonstrated efficacy in controlled trials, worsen patients’ motor symptoms, require extensive monitoring, or have other safety concerns. The lack of target engagement in a 
degenerating brain may limit the effectiveness of currently approved treatment s, such as 
antidepressants  and antipsychotics , for mood and psychotic symptoms ( Lanctot  et al.  2017). 
The CATIE-AD study concluded that the adverse effects of risperidone, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_387332] ( Schneider et al. 200 6).

Protocol Amendment 4  Date: [ADDRESS_807924] for some antipsychotics; however, they are restricted to short- term treatment in patients 
with severe and persistent symptoms when non- pharmacological treatme nts have failed, and 
when there is risk of harm to self or others. For example, risperidone is approved in Canada 
and Europe for short- term treatment of persistent aggression in moderate to severe 
Alzheimer’s disease unresponsive to non-pharmacological approaches and when there is a risk of harm to self or others .

1.4 Study Rationale 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_609318]. The safety database supporting the PDP 
development program consisted of >1200 patients and healthy subjects, including >[ADDRESS_807927] safety profile compared with other antipsychotics, 
including no detrimental effects on cognitive and motor symptoms and lack of off- target 
toxicities. This safety profile offers  the potentially unique and significant advantages over 
currently used antipsychotics in patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with 
neurodegenerative disease.  
ACP -103-047 will further expand the safety database in adult and frail, elderly patients. It 
will enroll patients with prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucination, depression/dysphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, sleep disorder) associated with Parkinson’s disease and other neurodege nerative diseases , for whom there are 
no approved antipsychotic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

• Subject ( or LAR ) withdraws consent 
• Other  
If at any time the C -SSRS or GCAS results for a given subject reveal potential suicidality, 
then the Investigator should assess the clinical significance of such res ults. If a clinically 
significant risk of suicidality is identified for a subject, then the Investigator should 
discontinue the subject and implement appropriate treatment ( Section 6.3.5).   
4.4.[ADDRESS_807935] W ithdrawal or Termination 
Every  reasonable effort should be made to complete Visit 9/ET  and the safety follow-up 
period if  a subject discontinues prematurely from the study for any reason. 
If a subject is lost to follow -up, every reasonable effort should be made to phone the subject 
and study partner/caregiver approximately [ADDRESS_807936]’s current status . All phone contact [CONTACT_609342]/caregiver should be documented. 
For subjects who continue to be followed for safety, serious adverse events ( SAEs ) should 
continue to be reported as described in Section 7.5.2. 
If a subject is discontinued from the study because of an AE, every reasonable attempt should 
be made to follow the subject until the AE resolves or until the Investigator deems the AE to be chronic or stable.  
All SAEs will continue to be followed until su ch events have resolved or the Investigator 
deems them to be chronic or stable.  
Should a subject request or decide to withdraw, every reasonable effort should be made to complete and report observations as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal, including t he evaluations specified at the ET  visit outlined in  Table S –1. Unless the subject 
has withdrawn consent to be contact[CONTACT_387415], every reasonable effort  should be made 
to complete the 30- day safety follow-up telephone call for all subjects who withdraw 
prematurely . All information will be reported  on the applicable pages of the eCRF . 
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for any reason. Such reasons may be any of, but not limited to, the following: 
• Occurrence of AEs unknown to date in respect of their nature, severity, and duration 
or the unexpected incidence of known AEs

In order to ensure that appropriate concomitant therapy is administered, it is essential that 
subjects be instructed not to take any medication without prior consultation with the 
Inves tigator (unless the subject is receiving treatment for a medical emergency).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Permitted, Restricted, and Prohibited Medications  
Prohibitions and restrictions for concomitant medications should be followed between the 
initial Baseline visit and Visit 9/ET as  specified in Appendix A  and Appendix B . These 
appendices do not constitute an exhaustive list and any questions regarding prohibited and 
restricted medications should be discussed with the Medical Monitor or designee. 
Use of medic ations that could interfere with study conduct or any questions regarding 
prohibited and restricted concomitant medications should be reviewed and/or discussed with 
the Medical Monitor or des ignee.  
Medications that can prolong QT interval are prohibited (or restricted if approved by [CONTACT_5134]) as specified in Appendix A . 
If a subject is on a medication restricted by [CONTACT_760], the medication should be adjusted if 
it is determined by [CONTACT_387416] (e.g., if the subject's symptoms are not well-controlled or if the subject cannot tolerate the current medication) in 
consultation with the treating physician. 
The Investigator may prescribe, adjust, or discontinue appropriate medication to treat or 
manage AEs.  Subjects who require  current treatment with a prohibited medication will be 
withdrawn from the study.  
Subjects who have previously taken a prohibited medication during the study will be 
withdrawn from the study unless:  
• the prohibited medication has been discontinued AND

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 35 of 62 6.2 Efficacy Assessments  
6.2.1 Clinical Global Impression – Severity Scale 
The CGI -S scale is a clinician -rated, [ADDRESS_807947]’s neuropsychiatric symptoms at the time of assessment using the Investigator’s 
judgment and past experience with subjects  who have the same condition ( Guy 1976).  
The CGI -S will be assessed at Baseline (Visit 1) and at all scheduled and unscheduled visits. 
6.2.2 EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument used as a measure of health outcome 
(Kind  1996). It measures 5 dimensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort,  
anxiety/depression) each of which has [ADDRESS_807948] 5 levels of 
severity (no problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme 
problems) within a particular EQ -5D dimension. The EQ-5D-5L Proxy version 1 will be 
used. For this version, a study partner/caregiver (the proxy) is asked to rate the subject’s health -related quality of life in their (the proxy’s) opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. 
The EQ -5D- 5L will be assessed  at Baseline (Visit 1) and at Weeks 12, 28, and 52. 
6.2.3 Sleep Disorders Inventory  
The Sleep Disorders Inventory (SDI) is an expanded version of one subscale of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI; Tractenberg et al. 2003). It consists of the 7 questions from 
the NPI [INVESTIGATOR_609327]. Each question includes a study partner/caregiver rating of frequency, severity, and study partner/ caregiver distress with respect to th e patient -participant 
sleep behavior for the [ADDRESS_807949] to a single rating for 
frequency and sev erity for all sleep disturbance -related behaviors, which would be 
incorporated into an overall NPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005], the SDI total score is derived after  the study 
partner/caregiver rates the frequency and severity of each of the 7 separate sleep questions. 
Study par tner/caregiver distress ratings are not part of the SDI total score, but distress is 
measured.   
The SDI wi ll be assessed at Baseline and at Weeks 12, 28, and 52. 
6.3 Safety Assessments 
6.3.1 Physi cal Examinations 
A physical examination will be conducted at Baseline and at Week s 28 and 52. 
Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: [ADDRESS_807950] has been sitting for ≥ 3 minutes.  
6.3.3 Weight  
Weight will be reported  (in kilograms) at all scheduled visits.  
6.3.4 Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be complete, standardized recordings. A single 
12-lead ECG  will be completed at all scheduled visits during the present study ( Table S –1). 
All ECGs will be centrally read; the interpretation by [CONTACT_609343] . If a site performs additional ECGs beyond the single ECG 
prescribe d at Baseline, the mean QTcF/QRS values of all the tracings of adequate quality will 
be used to determine eligibility.  
At Baseline, a subject may be enrolled based on the machine read of the locally completed ECG. If the interpretation of the ECG by [CONTACT_609344], the subject will be discontinued from the study, but this will not be 
considered a protocol deviation. 
The subject must rest in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_387382]. ECG tracings  (paper or 
electronic) will be reviewed and interpreted by a qualified clinician . ECG tracings and results 
(heart  rate, RR, PR, QRS, QT, QTcF , and QTcB interval  duration) will be included and 
summarized in the subject's study records. 
6.3.5 Suicidal Ideation and Behavior 
[IP_ADDRESS] Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS monitors changes in suicidal thinking and behavior over time, in order to 
determine risk ( Posner et al. 2011). The following four constructs are measured: the severity 
of ideation, the intensity of ideation, behavior, and lethality.  
The C -SSRS will be used to assess suicidal ideations and behaviors in subjects who are able 
to reliably complete the assessment , according to the judgment of the Investigator . Whether 
or not the subject can complete the C -SSRS should be documented in the eCRF for each 
subject  at each visit . If the subject is not able to complete the C -SSRS, the GCAS should be 
used thereafter  in the study to assess suicidality.  
For subjects who completed the Baseline/Screenin g Version i n the antecedent study and are 
still able to complete the C- SSRS assessment  in the present study , the Since Last Visit

Protocol Amendment 4  Date: [ADDRESS_807951] and implement appropriate 
treatment ( Section  4.4).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Global Clinician Assessment of Suicidality  
The GCAS is a clinician -rated, [ADDRESS_807952]’s  suicidality 
based on the report of the subject, the report of the study partner/caregiver, and the clinician’s global assessment. Ratings can be 0 (“Absent”), 1 (“Feel s life is not worth living”), 
2 (“Wishes he/she were dead or any thoughts of possible death to self”), 3 (“Suicidal ideas or gesture”), or 4 (“Attempt at suicide”). The Investigator will record a subject rating, a study partner/caregiver rating, and  a clinician rating.  
If the GCAS was used in the antecedent study, suicidality since- last-visit will be assessed at 
Visit 1 (Baseline) and at all other visits . 
If the subject is not able to reliably complete the C -SSRS at any point in the study in the 
Investigator’s judgment, the GCAS will be administered and used thereafter in the study. The first assessment with the GCAS should assess lifetime suicidality and suicidality for the past 
[ADDRESS_807953] and implement appropri ate treatment (Section 4.4). 
6.3.6 Mini -Mental State Exami nation  
The Mini- Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) is a brief 30 -point questionnaire that is used to 
quantitatively assess cognition ( Folstein et al. 1975). The M MSE includes simple questions 
and problems in a number of areas: the time and place of testing, repeating lists of words, arithmetic, language use and comprehension, and copying a drawing. The MMSE is being used in this study to screen for cognitive impair ment and as a safety measure.  
The MMSE will be administered at all scheduled visits.  
6.3.7 Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale - Abbreviated  
The Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale ( ESRS ; Chouinard and Margolese 2005) was 
developed to assess drug induced movement disorders such as parkinsonism, akathisia, 
dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia with established reliability, validity, and sensitivity. It

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 38 of 62 consists of a questionnaire of parkinsonian symptoms, physician examination of 
parkinsonism, dyskinetic movements, and global impression of tardive dyskinesia. The 
ESRS -A, an accepted modified form of the original ESRS, will be used during the study to 
monitor for any worsening in extrapyramidal symptoms or signs at scheduled and 
unscheduled visits.

from Baseline  for the ACP -103-[ADDRESS_807958] should be referred for appropriate treatment. 
7.2 Speci fication of Safety Parameters 
7.2.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as “any untoward medi cal occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related” ( US FDA  2012). 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any 
judgment about causality or seriousness. An AE can arise from any use of the drug 
(e.g., off -label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. 
AEs do not include the following: 
• Stable or  intermittent chronic conditions (such as myopia requiring eyeglasses) that 
are present prior to  Baseline of the ACP -103-047 study and do not worsen during the 
study 
Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 41 of 62 • Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion). The condition that leads to the procedure is an AE if not present at 
Baseline of the ACP -103-047 study. 
• Overdose of concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms unless the 
subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913] 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_609329] (situation where an 
untoward medical occurrence has not occurred)  
• Pregnancy will not be considered an AE, but if it occurs, it will be reported on a 
pregnancy form  
7.2.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
In addition to the severity rating, each AE will be classified by [CONTACT_5256] “serious” 
or “not serious.” The seriousnes s of an event will be defined according to the applicable 
regulations and generally refers to the outcome of an event. An SAE is one that meets one or 
more of t he following: 
• Is fatal  
• Is immediately life threatening  
• Results in disability or permanent damage  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Prolongs existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in an offspring) 
• Is medically significant  
Definition of Lif e Threatening  
A life threatening event places the subject at immediate  risk of death from the event as it 
occurred . This does not include an AE, which, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death. 
Definition of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_609330] a full admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431800] . This includes prolongation of an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Examples of visits to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431801]: 
• Emergency room visits (that do not result in a full hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063])  
• Outpatient surgery 
Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 42 of 62 • Preplanned or elective procedures  
• Protocol procedures 
• Social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], defined as admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1315] a result of inadequate 
family support or care at the subject’s primary residence  
Definition of Disability or Permanent Damage 
Disability is defined as a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions. 
Definition of Med ically Significant  
Important medical events (medically significant events) that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149693], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the s ubject or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_456004]. 
An SAE may also include any other event that the Investigator or Medical Monitor judges to 
be serious or that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. 
7.3 Classification of an Adverse Event 
7.3.1 Severity of Event 
The severity of each AE will be graded on a 3- point scale and reported in detail as indicated 
on the eCRF: 
• Mild : awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated, causing minimal 
discomfort, and not interfering with normal everyday activities 
• Moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities  
• Severe: incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities 
7.3.2 Relationship to Study Drug  
The causality of each A E should be assessed and classified by [CONTACT_5256] “related” or 
“not related.” An event is considered related if there is a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_95107] (i.e., there are facts, evidence, or 
arguments to suggest possible causation).

Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 43 of 62 Consider t he following when assessing causality: 
• Temporal associations between the agent and the event  
• Response to cessation (de- challenge) or re-challenge 
• Compatibility with known class effect 
• Known effect s of concomitant medications  
• Pre-existing risk factors  
• A plausible mechanism  
• Concurrent illnesses 
[IP_ADDRESS] Duration 
The start and stop dates for AEs will be recorded using the following criteria: 
• Start : Date of the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_149688]  
• Stop : Date when AE  either ceased permanently or changed in severity  
[IP_ADDRESS] Frequency  
The frequency of the AE should be indicated according to the following definitions: 
• Single : Experienced once, without recurrence 
• Recurrent : More than  one discrete epi[INVESTIGATOR_431802]  
[IP_ADDRESS] Action Taken with Study Drug  
• Dose reduced : Dose of study drug reduced

7.[ADDRESS_807959] a nonspecific question (e.g., “Have you noticed anything 
different since your last visit?”) to assess whether any AEs have been experienced since the 
last report or visit.  
Note that any use of medication (and specifically any newly prescribed medication) during the course of a study may indicate the occurrence of an AE that may need to be recorded on 
both the AE and the concomitant medication page.  
All AEs, serious and not serious, will be recorded on the AE eCRF page using appropriate 
medical terminology . Severity and relationship to study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_3786]. 
When possible, clinical AEs should be described by [CONTACT_149724] 
(e.g., “cold” or “seasonal allergies” instead of “runny nose”).  
All AEs, whether or not related to the study drug, must be fully and completely documented

use the appropriate form for initial and/or follow-up reporting.  
At a minimum, events identified by [CONTACT_387424], 
unexpected, and related to study drug must be brought to the attention of the responsible institutional review board/ethics committee ( IRB/EC), a s per applicable reg ulations. These 
will be provided by [CONTACT_508849]. For European Union ( EU) member 
states, the Sponsor or its designee will provide reports of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) directly to the E Cs, as required by l ocal legislation . In all other 
countries, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to provide these expedited reports to the responsible IRB/EC. It is also the Investigator’s responsibility to notify the responsible 
IRB/EC regarding any new and significant safety information. 
For this study, sites will complete the paper SAE  form (for initial and/or follow-up 
information) including available supporting documentation relevant to the event and fax or 
email (within 24 hours of discovery) to the contact [CONTACT_609345] t he SAE  form. 
Subjects will be followed until EO T/ET for any SAEs and/or other reportable information or 
until such events have resolved or the Investigator, in conjunction with the Sponsor , deems 
them to be chronic or s table.  
In the event of any SAE (other than death), the study subject will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_737] (or designee) using the telephone number provided in the ICF. All subjects 
experiencing an SAE will be seen by [CONTACT_609346]. 
Serious AEs occurring after the study Follow-up Period should be reported if in the judgment

deviation and not a waiver. All follow -up safety assessments must be completed and 
documented as outlined in the protocol ( Section  6.4). The Investigator must report any 
protocol deviation to the Sponsor and, if required, to the IRB/EC in accordance with local 
regulations, within reasonable time.  
10.7 Protocol Amendments  
Changes to the protocol may be made only by [CONTACT_1034] (with or without consultation with 
the Investigator) . All protocol modifications must be submitted to the site IRB/EC in 
accordance with local req uirements and, if required, to regulatory a uthorities , as eith er an 
amendment or a notification . Approval for amendments must be awaited before any changes 
can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to trial 
subjects, or when the changes involve only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial . 
No approval is required for notifications. 
11 QUALITY MANAGEMENT  
11.1 Risk Management  
The Sponsor utilizes the ICH E6 (GCP) Revision 2 risk management approach that includes 
methods to assure and control the quality of the trial proportionate to the risks inherent in the trial and the importance of the information collected. The intent is that all aspects of this trial are operationally feasible and that any unnecessary complexity, procedures, and data 
collection are avoided. The Sponsor’s risk management approach includes the following 
activities with a focus on critical processes and critical study data:  
• Risk Identification: identification of risks to critical study processes, governing systems, investigational product, study design, data collection, and recording. 
Study: ACP -103-047  Final Version: 1.0  
Protocol Amendment 4  Date: 5 March  2021 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 51 of 62 • Risk Evaluation: identified risks are evaluated by [CONTACT_387436]: 
(a) likelihood of error occurrence, (b) impact on human subject protection and data integrity, 
and (c) detectability of errors.  
• Risk Control: risks that can be reduced (e.g., mitigating) or can be accepted are 
differentiated. Risk mitigation activities are incorporated in protocol design and implementation, study plans, training, processes, and other documents governing the 
oversight and execution of study activities. Where possible, predefined quality tolerance 
limits are to be defined to identify systematic issues that can impact subject safety or data integrity and deviations from the predefined quality tolerance limits will trigger a n evaluation 
and possibly an action. Contingency plans are developed for issues with a high risk factor 
that cannot be avoided. 
• Periodic Risk Review, communication and escalation of Risk Management activities 
during trial execution and risk outcome repor ting in the Clinical Study Report (CSR).  
11.[ADDRESS_807973], inspecting the various records of the trial (e.g., eCRFs and other pertinent data) provided that subject confidentiality is respected.  
The Sponsor’s or designee’s monitor is responsible for inspecting the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical 
research . The monitor should have access to subject medical records and other study- related 
records needed to verify the entries on the eCRFs.  
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in 
the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 
In accordance with ICH Guidance on GCP and the Sponsor’s audit pl ans, a certain 
percentage of sites participating in this study will be audited. These audits may include a 
review of site facilities (e.g., pharmacy, drug storage areas, and laboratories) and review of study- related records may occur in order to evaluate t he trial conduct and compliance with 
the protocol, ICH Guidance on GCP, and applicable regulatory requirem ents. 
The Sponsor’s or designee’s representatives, regulatory authority inspectors and IRB/EC representatives who obtain direct access to source documents should also respect subject confidentiality, taking all reasonable precautions in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements to maintain the confidentiality of subjects’ identities.

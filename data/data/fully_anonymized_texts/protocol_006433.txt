Despi[INVESTIGATOR_122173], for the purpose of this study, the seizure t ype classification will 
follow the 1981 ILAE classification of epi[INVESTIGATOR_122174], which speaks of partial seizures, classified as simple partial seizures (no alteration of consciousness), complex partial seizures (with alteration of consciousness), and secondarily generalized seizures, and on the other hand defines generalized seizure types, referred to as absence seizures (t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_122175]), 
myoclonic seizures, clonic seizures, tonic seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, and atonic seizures.  
Apart from m yoclonic seizures, consciousness is almost invariably impaired from the onset 
of the seizure (Commission on Classification and Terminology of the ILAE, 1981).
Likewise, the classification of epi[INVESTIGATOR_30989] y syndromes will be used according to the 1989 
ILAE -publication (Commission on Classification and Terminology of the ILAE, 1989).

Brivaracetam is a 2- pyrrolidone derivative.  Brivaracetam display s a high and selective 
interaction with a novel brain- specific binding site, SV2A (sy naptic vesicle protein 2A).  This 
binding site appears to be the major target for its pharmacological activity.  Brivaracetam also 
reduces voltage-dependent sodium currents.  Brivaracetam also reverses the inhibitory  effects 
of negat ive allosteric modulators on gamma- aminobuty ric acid, and gl ycine -induced currents.  
Brivaracetam is extensively  metabolized, but seizure protection appears to be associated with 
the parent compound.
Brivaracetam is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y and completely absorbed through out the gastrointestinal tract.  The 
extent of BRV absorption is not affected b y food.  The pharmacokinetics (PK) are 
dose-proportional (at least from 10mg to 600mg).  Brivaracetam is weakl y bound to plasma 
proteins (≤20%).  The volume of distribution is 0.5L/kg, a value that is close to that of total 
body  water.  The plasma half- life of BRV is approximately  8hours in young healthy  male 
adults.  The main metabolic pathway of BRV is by [CONTACT_122263], while a second pathway  is the ω1-hy droxylation mediated b y 
cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19 ) (with contributions of several other isoenzy mes).  The
combination of these [ADDRESS_137239] s results in the hydroxy acid terminal metabolite.  These 
metabolites are not pharmacologically active.  There is no evidence of chiral inversion of BRV.  Brivaracetam is eliminated primarily  by [CONTACT_122264].  
More than 95% of the dose, with less than 9% as unchanged BRV, is excreted in urine within 72hours after dosing.
Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects and in subjects with renal impairment showed a similar PK profile of BRV compared to that in healthy  subjects, while the elimination of the REDACTED COPY 6.[ADDRESS_137240]

showed a 50% increase in exposure to BRV associated with decreased h ydroxylation.
Brivaracetam does not impair the efficacy  of oral contraceptives containing 
ethiny lestradiol 30µg and levonorgestrel 150µg.  Brivaracetam does not induce CYP3A4 
using midazolam as a marker probe.  Brivaracetam has no interaction on lamotrigine and 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_052].  Brivaracetam plasma concentration is not increased b y gemfibrozil, a selective 
CYP2C8/9 inhibitor, but is increased in a nonclinically relevant manner in Japanese subjects possessing defective CYP2C19 mutations.  Brivaracetam clearance is doubled by [CONTACT_21446][INVESTIGATOR_2513], a potent CYP inducer.
Trough levels of concomitant AEDs were monitored in all efficacy studies.  No significant 
change from Baseline nor dose-related trend was observed for the plasma concentrations of carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_122176], phenobarbital,

limit of normal (3.0µg/mL) at BRV doses of 100 and 150mg/day.
6.3 Effic acy with BRV in fixed -dose Phase II/III studies in POS 
Following completion of the Phase II studies (N01114, UCB protocol reference code 
RPCE02K0301; N01193, UCB protocol reference code RPCE05C2201), clinical results supported further development of BRV for the adjunctive treatment of POS.  Two adequate and well -controlled fixed -dose studies (N01252, UCB protocol reference code 
RPCE06G0704; N01253, UCB protocol reference code RPCE06G0705) were conducted to assess BRV across a dose range of 5 to 100mg /day.
N01253 assessed BRV doses of 5, 20, and 50mg/day  and provided statistically  significant 
and clinically  relevant evidence of the efficacy  of BRV 50mg/day .  N01252 assessed BRV 
doses of 20, 50, and 100mg/day.  Although the primary  efficacy  endpoint (for 
BRV50mg/day ) of N01252 was not positive, it provided supporting evidence for the efficacy 
of BRV 100mg/day in subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] .An additional confirmatory  study  (N01358) in 
subjects with POS is ongoing and will assess the doses of BRV 100mg/day , to re plicate and 
confirm the treatment effect observed in N01252, and BRV 200mg/day , at the 
recommendation of regulatory authorities in order to explore the upper end of the dose-response curve.
6.4 Conversion to m onotherapy
Two Phase III studies (N01276 and N013 06) were initiated to evaluate the efficacy , safet y 
and tolerability  of BRV (at doses of 50 and 100mg/day  in b.i.d. regimen) in the conversion to

A decision was taken to stop the N01276 and N01306 studies after an interim analysis and 
independent unblinded review of study  data by  a Data Monitoring Committee identified that 
pre-defined criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_122181] b een met. I t was determined the probability  
that both studies together would demonstrate a positive outcome for the efficacy  anal ysis at 
completion was too low.
6.5 Safety with BRV 
In Phase II/III studies, a favorable safet y and tolerability  profile has been demonstrated for 
BRV.  The discontinuation rate and the discontinuation rate due to TEAEs were low and 
similar to placebo (PBO) for all studies. The most frequently reported TEAEs were headache, 
somnolence, dizziness, and fatigue.  The overall incidence of SAEs was low and similar to PBO.  There were no clinically  relevant changes in laboratory  values, vital signs, or ECG 
abnormalities.

The study  will explore the long- term safet y and efficacy of BRV insuch a population and 
potentially  populations from other future studies.
6.6.1 Dose Selection
In this stud y,the recommend edstarting dose is 100mg/day . Afterwards t he daily  dose can be 
individualized up to a maximum of 200mg/day . Twice dail y dosing is deemed necessary to 
ensure more regular exposure over the 24-hour interval.
A maximum dose of 200mg/day was chosen following consultation with regulatory 
authorities and is to be evaluated in more recent BRV studies (e .g., N01358 and N01379). 
According to available data, 200mg/day doses have been well tolerated.

8.1 Type/Design
This is a Phase III, LTFU ,multinational, multicenter, non-comparative, open -label and single 
arm study .
The visits will be scheduled as follows:
 First y ear:
 First 3 months:  1 visit/month:  FEV alternating with MEV.
 Next 9 months:  1 visit/3 months:  FEV alternating with MEV.
 Second and subsequent years:
 1 visit/3months:  FEV alternating with MEV.
 The YEV will be performed in replacement of the first FEV of each year.
8.2 Subjects/Sites Numbers
It wasestimated that approximately  300 - 600 subjects were to enter the study . However, the 
number of subjects entered will be reduced due to the premature discontinuation of N01276 
and N01306.
This study  will include as many  sites as required (initially , 120-180 sites are foreseen).

An Interactive V oice Response System(IVRS) willbe used during this study. A telephone 
call to the sy stem will be made:
 At the EV : for assignment of the study  subject number and dispensing of ini tial 
medication 
and 
 At subsequent visits: for dispensing stud y medication
 To update the status of the subject when the subject leaves the study
The IVRS will also be applied for the ordering of the drug shipments to the sites via the 
UCB CTS Operations or designee, using a “trigger and re-suppl y” method of medication 
management specified in a separate document.
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosing Schedule
The suggested individual starting dose of each subject will be 100mg/day.
The daily dose should be divided into 2 equal intakes (morning and evening), taken with or 
without food.  The first intake will be in the evening of the day of the dispensation of the study  medication.
At each subject visit, if necessary , the dosage can be adapted:
 Up-titration can be made by  [CONTACT_122271] a maximum 50mg/day  on a weekly  basis and 
up to a maximum dose of 200mg/day .
 Dose decreases can be made by [CONTACT_122272] 50mg/day on a weekly basis.  In 
case of study  drug discontinuation, a last down -titration step at 20mg/day  for 1week 
will be included prior to the study -drug free period.
The doses administered in this study  must comply with doses that can be administered with

At the following visits, FEV , YEV, EDV, and FV,laboratory  assessments will be conducted 
using standard methods at a central laboratory.  At the EV, data will be obtained from the last 
Evaluation Visit of the previous study and should not be recorded on the CRF.  The central 
laboratory  will provide the Investigator with dedicated, standardized sampling equipment 
(labels, needles, tubes), and a study- specific lab oratory  manual, which will explain how to 
use the equipment and how to ship the samples back to the central laboratory. 
Results for hematology , chemistry , urinal ysis and pregnancy  tests will be provided by [CONTACT_122280] . 
The total blood volume drawn for the clinical laboratory assessments will be a maximum of 
20mL/sampling.  The subject should preferabl y be fasting.  Study medication intake must not
be delay ed.
The following laboratory assessments will be conducted:
 Blood chemistry:  glucose, urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus 
(inorganic), total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate 
aminotransferase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (ASAT/SGOT), alanine 
aminotransferase/serum glutamic py ruvic transaminase (ALAT /SGPT),
gamma -glutamyltranspeptidase , and uric acid.
 The creatinine clearance (Cr Cl) will be calculated by [CONTACT_94486]’s formula: 
 male:  Cr Cl mL/ min = [(140- age) x body  weight] / (72 x serum creatinine

[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS)
The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_74017] (HADS) (Herrmann, 1997) ( seeAppendix 17.2) 
will be used to evaluate anxiety  and depression/depressed feelings.  The HADS was 
developed as a self-administered scale to assess the presence and severity  of both anxiety  and 
depression simultaneously.  It consists of 14 items that are scored on a 4- point severity  scale 
ranging from 0 to 3.  A score per dimension (anxiety, depression) will be calculated as 
recommended b y the authors with each score ranging from 0 to 21 and higher scores 
indicating higher depression/anxiety .  The subjects will complete the HADS at every  FEV 
and YEV for the first [ADDRESS_137276] 2 years.
[IP_ADDRESS] EQ-5D Questionnaire
The EQ -5D(EuroQol Group, 2000) (seeAppendix 17.3) is a self-administered questionnaire 
designed to measure health status.  EQ- 5D defines health in terms of 5 dimensions (mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression).  Each dimension is divide d into 3 levels:
 no problem = 1
 some or moderate problems = 2
 extreme problems = 3
EQ-5D also captures a self-rating of health status on a 20cm vertical visual analogue scale, 
anchored at 100 (best imaginable health state) at the top and 0 (worst imaginable health state) at the bottom.
The EQ -5D questionnaire will be assessed at every FEV and YEV for the first [ADDRESS_137277] 2 years.

12. ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
12.1 Adverse Events
12.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event (AE)
An adverse event is an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessaril y have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be an y unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the 
medicinal (investigational) product.
In order to ensure complete safety data collection, all AEs or undesirable experiences 
occurring during the study (i.e., after signature [CONTACT_122330]), including an y pre -
and post-treatment periods required by [CONTACT_760], must be reported in the CRF even if no investigational product was taken but specific study procedures were conducted.  These include all AEs not present prior to the initial visit and all AEs which recurred or worsened after the initial visit. 
Signs or s ymptoms of the condition/disease for which the investigational product is being 
studied should be recorded as AEs only if their nature changes considerably or their 
frequency  or intensit y increases in a clinically significant manner as compared to the clinical 
profile known to the Investigator from the subject’s history  or the Baseline Period .
12.1.[ADDRESS_137292] adverse events, e.g.
Did y ou notice any thing unusual about your health (since y our last visit)?
In addition, the Investigator should review an y self-assessment procedures (e.g., diary  cards) 
employ ed in the study .
12.1.3 Description of AEsThe following guidelines and definitions should be used b y the Investigator for the

etc.) for this AE.
Date of outcome Date the AE abated.  If the AE consists of several signs 
and sy mptoms (s yndromes) , the sign or s ymptom with 
the longest duration determines the duration of the AE. 
Outcome:
Resolved The AE is no longer present at an y intensity -
completely  abated.
Resolved with sequelae The AE is resolved but residual effects are still present.Ongoing The AE is still present at the last contact [CONTACT_1155].
Worsened The AE is still present but at a heightened intensity.  The rule of repetition of AE reporting should be applied.
Fatal This AE caused or directly  contributed to the subject’s 
death.
Relationship to investigational product:
None Only  applicable when no investigational product was 
taken or when the subject is taking single- blind 
placebo, or when the AE can be ascribed with reasonable certainty  to another cause.
Unlikely There are good reasons to think that there is no relationship e.g., the AE is a known adverse drug 
reaction of a concomitant medication, or the same AE 
does not reappear after re- administration of the 
investigational product.
Possible Equally  valid arguments can be considered for or 
against an implication of the investigational pr oduct, 
For example, the AE:
 follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the 
administration of the investigational product;
 follows a known or expected response pattern to the investigational product;
 but could readil y have been produced b y a 
number of other factors.
Probable The relationship is likely .  For example, the AE:

12.1.5 Rule for Repetition of an AE
An increase in the intensity of an AE should lead to the repetition of the AE reporting with:
 the outcome date of the first AE that is not related to the natural course of the disease

Research Organization ( CRO ) or a contract monitor.  The Monitor (the individual responsible 
for monitoring) will advise the Investigator regarding the practical conduct of the st udy and 
maintaining compliance with the protocol, GCP, and all applicable regulatory  requirements.
The Investigator will allow UCB or its representatives to review periodically , at mutuall y 
convenient times during the study  and after the study  has been completed, all CRFs and 
corresponding source documents (e.g., portions of office, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_122229] y participant).  Therefore, the monitor will have direct access to these records.  The 
monitoring visits provide UCB or its represe ntatives with the opportunity  to evaluate the 
progress of the study, to verify  the accuracy  and completeness of CRFs, ensure that all 
protocol requirements, applicable authorities regulations and Investigator’s obligations are being fulfilled, and resolve any incons istencies in the study  records.
15.[ADDRESS_137334] Access to Source Data/Documents
The Investigator(s)/Institution(s) will permit study- related monitoring, audits by  [CONTACT_122316] , IEC/IRB review, and regulatory  inspection(s), providing direct access to source 
data/documents.
Source documents are original records in which raw data are first recorded.  These may be:  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic/GP records, charts, diaries, x- rays, laboratory  results, printouts, pharmacy  
records, care records, ECG or other printou ts, completed scales, Quality  of Life 
Questionnaires, etc.  Source documents should be kept in a secure, limited access area.
If they  are not included in the clinical dossier/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_122230], the following data 
may be written directly  in the CRF and will therefore be considered as source data:
 Demographic data
 Childbearing potential and birth control
 Vital signs
 Body weight and height
 Physical and neurological examinations
 Socio -professional data
 Number of school/ work days lost
Original labor atory  results, ECG, will be inserted in the CRF and are also to be considered as 
source data.  Original DRCs, QOLIE -31-P , EQ- 5D,and HADS questionnaires will be 
retrieved. The site will keep a copy in the CRF and this copy  will considered as source data.REDACTED COPY istencies in the study

15.4 Case Report Forms (CRF) and Screen Failures
Data reflecting participant experience with the drug(s) under investigation will be reported to 
UCB.  These data will be recorded on the Case Report Forms (CRF). The CRF is essentially  
a data entry  form and may not routinel y constitute the original (or source) medical record.  
CRF should be kept in a secure, limited access area.
The CRF will be organized in yearly books. CRFs will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_122319][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a Co-I nvestigator designated by  [CONTACT_079].  The Investigator’s 
or Co-Investigator’s signature [CONTACT_122331].  Paper 
CRF s will be completed in dark ballpoint pen, and must be legible.  If an entry  in a CRF 
needs to be changed, the correction will be made as follows:
 Cross- out the initial entry (must still be legible).
 Write the correct entry next to it together with y our initials, the date and justification if 
necessary .  Correcting fluid, erasure or an y form of obliteration of data in CRFs is not 
permitted except to obliterate information that could specificall y identify a subject (i.e., 
a name [CONTACT_122332] a subject diary ).
UCB cannot interpret a blank answer as NONE or NA (not applicable); therefore, all fields 
must be completed.  Please mark data which could not be recorded as follow: ND for “Not Done”, NA for “Not Applicable”, UN for “Unknown”.
Data reported in the CRF, which are derived from source documents, should be consistent 
with the source documents or the discrepancies should be explained in those source documents.
The Investigator will keep a subject screening log to document identification of subjects who 
entered pre- study  screening.
All supportive documentation submitted to UCB in addition to the Case Report Form, such as laboratory  results or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78685], must be clearly  identified with the study  number, 
study  participant number, and study participant initials; any  personal information, including 
the study  participant’s name, must be removed or rendered illegible to preserve individual 
confidentiality .  All original lab reports will remain at the study site.  
15.5 Adherence to Protocol
The Investigator/institution should conduct the study in compliance with the protocol agreed 
to by  [CONTACT_122320], if applicable, by [CONTACT_122321] y(ies) and which 
has been approved b y the I EC/IRB.  The Investigator/institution and the Sponsor willsign the

4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONA LE 
4.1 Background  
Cancer immunotherapy for solid tumors is comin g of age, with FDA -approved immuno -
therapeutics in prostate cancer, melanoma, and renal cell cancer.  Interleukin -2 (IL-2) and the 
anti-CTLA -4 antibody ipi[INVESTIGATOR_266153]; both induce durable clinical 
regressions. Recent data also show th at blockade of PD -1/PD -L1 induces durable clinical 
regressions of melanoma, renal cell cancer and non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (1), and 
the PD -[ADDRESS_323902] progressed after ipi[INVESTIGATOR_224] . Furthermore, antigen -specific adoptive 
T cell therapy induces clinical regressions that are durable in about 20% of treated patients  (2). 
There is excitement about this growing armamentarium of systemic immunotherapeutics, 
whose effects are mediated predominantly by T lymphocytes.  However, d espi[INVESTIGATOR_266154] , current  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_266155] 
70-80% of patients. Thus, t here is a need for new combination approaches that build on the 
demonstrated clinical value of immune therapy.  
Cancer vaccines inducing antigen -specific T cell responses are emerging as a component of 
combination immunoth erapy.  In the past few years, a cancer vaccine has been approved for 
prostate cancer, based on  improved survival outcomes from two randomized trials (3), and a 
randomized prospective trial in melanoma  patients showed that adding a peptide vaccine to 
high-dose IL -2 significantly prolonged progression -free survival (PFS) when compared to IL -2 
alone  (4).  Thus, after several decades of development and optimiza tion, there is now evidence 
that some cancer vaccines may improve clinical outcomes, in particular in combination with 
other active therapy.  
We have developed a vaccine incorporating 6 intermediate -length peptides that induce s CD4+ 
helper T cell (T H) resp onses (6 helper peptides, 6MHP), and  has clinical activity in patients with 
advanced melanoma  (5).  The 6MHP vaccine has also been shown to induce Th1 dominant T 
cell responses (6)  and cross -priming of CD8+ T cells (7). The current protocol is to obtain 
preliminary data on whether the combination of th e 6MHP vaccine with immune checkpoint 
blockade of PD -[ADDRESS_323903]: tumor relationship in the context of these combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. These studies hold 
promise:  
 To modulate T cell infiltration into metastases  
 To increase helper T cell responses to vaccine , and  
 To increase clinical response rates and to extend the life of patients with melanoma .

Protocol: UVA-Mel-64  
Version Date:    07/13/[ADDRESS_323905] convincing 
experimental evidence of the importance of immune surveillance in preventing the development 
of solid tumors is provided by [CONTACT_266189], in which 50 -100% of knockout mice 
lacking STAT1 and/or IFN γ receptor function developed spontaneous solid tumors of various 
histologies within 12 -15 months, whereas normal mice never developed malignancies during 
the same time period (8).  These st udies strongly support the role of cellular immune function in 
the control of cancer progression.   These findings are supported in humans by [CONTACT_266190] (CTLA -4 and/or PD -1) induces durable clinical responses in 
patients wi th melanoma and other cancers (9-11). 
The Role of CD4+ Helper T Lymphocytes in Anti -tumor Immune Responses.    
 
Initially, the majority of cancer vaccines were designed to activate the CD8+ cytotoxic T cell arm 
of the host immune system. However, more recent approaches target the activation of CD4+ Th 
cells.  This is based in part on results from earlier studies which demonstrated that depletion of 
CD4+ T-cells abrogates all or part of protective immune response to vaccines (12).  
Furthermore, adoptive therapy with CD4+ T-cells has been show n to induce tumor p rotection in 
some model systems (13,14) .   
 
There are several mechanisms by [CONTACT_9444] T h cells mediate anti -tumor responses.  Th cells can 
activate dendritic cells (DC) for heightened antigen pre sentation, causing the DC to secrete IL -2 
and other cytokines and co -stimulatory molecules that support the induction of CD8+ T cell 
immune response s (15-18). In addition , Th responses support  the establishment  of CD8+ T cell 
memory responses  (19-22). Furthermore, strong T h1 help produces a cytokine milieu which is 
critical to the induction of immune -mediated tumor destruction (23,24) .   
 
4.2.[ADDRESS_323906] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades  (25).  Accumulating evid ence shows a correlation 
between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies   (26-30).  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T-cells and the ratio of CD 8+ 
effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and 
long-term survival in many solid tumors.  
The PD -[ADDRESS_323907] ion of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -
cells under healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, 
including autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily 
member related to C D28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen 
receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2) (31-34).  The 
structure of  murine PD -1 has been resolved (35).  PD -1 and family members are type I 
transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain responsible for 
ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling mole cules.  
The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif 
(ITSM).  Following T -cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine ph osphatases SHP -1 and SHP -
2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphorylation  of effector 
molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70 which are involved in th e CD3 T -cell signaling 
cascade (31,36) .  The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209] -[ADDRESS_323908] from that of CTLA -4, as both molecules regulate an overlap pi[INVESTIGATOR_55509] (37,38) .  PD -[ADDRESS_323909]:   Pembrolizumab (MK -3475)  10

 peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B -cells, T  regs and Natural Killer cells (39,40) .  Expression 
has also been shown during thymic development on CD4-CD8- (double negative) T -cells as well 
as subsets of m acrophages and dendritic cells (41).  The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) 
are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non -
hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors (37,4 2-44).  Both ligands are type I 
transmembrane receptors containing both IgV - and IgC -like domains in the extracellular region 
and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD -[ADDRESS_323910] notably on vascular 
endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen -presenting cells 
found in lymphoid tis sue or chronic inflammatory environments.  PD -L2 is thought to control 
immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -
cell function in peripheral tissues (37).  Althou gh healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a 
variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -1 
has been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion i n subjects with melanoma 
(MEL) (45).  This suggests that the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune 
evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.  
Pembrolizumab  (previously known as SCH 900475  and MK-3475 ) is a potent and highly 
selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly 
block the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2.   
4.2.2  Preclinical and Clinical Trial Data  
Refer to the Investigato r’s Brochure for Preclinical and Clinical data.  
4.[ADDRESS_323911] common cancer in the [LOCATION_002] , and over 70,000 new cases 
will be diagnosed this year  (46).  Worldwide, approximately 50,000 people die each year from 
melanoma.  When diagnosed and treated for localized disease , a patient’s prognosis is often 
favorable; how ever,  approximately 12% of patients with localized disease eventually recur with 
metastatic disease.  Factors associated with an increased risk of recurrence include the 
presence of ulceration, microsatellitosis, intransit disease and lymph node involvemen t.  Prior to 
the current era of checkpoint blockade therapy, t he median survival time for patients with  stage 
IV metastatic melanoma was  only about 6 -10 months  (47).  
 
CD4+ T-helper  cells have been shown to pla y an important role in anti -tumor immunity.   Anti-
tumor responses can occur  via direct interactions between  CD4+ T cells and tumor cells  or 
alternative ly, through indirect mechanisms  including  the licensing and activation of antigen 
presenting cells  (15,16,48) . The 6MHP vaccine incorporates known MHC class II -restricted 
peptides derived from melanoma -associated tumor antigens and administration of the vaccine 
in an emulsion with Montanide ISA -51 induce s Th1-domi nant CD4+ T cell responses  to the 
peptides  (5,7).   T cell responses against the vaccine  have been induced in 40 -80% of patients, 
and RECIST -defined clinical response rates and disease control rates have been o bserved in  
8% and 30%, respectively. In prior melanoma studies , Mel41  and E1602 , durations of SD and 
clinical responses have been durable, ranging from 1 to 7 years (5,49)  (Table 1). Also, there 
has been a strong and significant association between immune response to the 6MHP and 
survival, in patients with advanced melanoma in the ECOG trial E1602 (univariate, p = 0.005, 
multivariate p =0.038, H R 0.50)  (49)(Reed 2015 3)(Figure 2).

The programmed cell death receptor -1 (PD -1) is found on activated T cells, and binding of this 
receptor with its ligands results in the down -regulation of T cell responses  (50).  Pembrolizumab 
blocks the interaction between PD-[ADDRESS_323912] been observed 
in approximately 26% of patients who h ave progressed after ipi[INVESTIGATOR_224]  
(51).  Combining  pembrolizumab  with the 6MHP vaccine may lead to enhanced targeted T cell 
responses  against defined tumor antigens and result in the induction of improved  clinical 
response  rates in patient s with metastatic disease .  The goals of this phase I study are to 
evaluate the safety of the combination of 6MHP  and pembroliz umab and also to evaluate the T 
cell response against the 6MHP vaccine in the context of pembr olizumab administration.  
Clinical responses will also be measured.

To improve the clinical benefit of this and other vaccines, it is critical to support T cell infiltration 
and function in the tumor microenvironment. We have reported that melanoma metastases can 
be categorized into 3 Immunotypes based on immune cell infiltrate s, where Immunotype A 
melanomas (29%) lack infiltrates, Immunotype B (63%) have immune cell infiltrates cuffing 
intratumoral vessels but not infiltrating tumor nests, and only Immunotype C melanomas (8%) 
have diffuse immune infiltrates  (52). Blockade of PD -1/PD -L1 can increase T cell infiltration and  
combination with a vaccine should improve tumor targeting. Also, recent data have revealed Table 1.  Clinical Response Rates to 6MHP Vaccines in Subjects

 increased PD1 expression on exhausted CD4+ T cell s (53); thus, blocking PD1/PDL1 is 
expected to support CD4+ T cell function.  
The current proposal is for a clinical trial combining this active 6MHP vaccine with 
pembrolizumab . Primary endpoints include safety  and immune response. Se condary endpoints 
will include assessment of changes in the tumor microenvironment. Exploratory objectives will 
include assessment of  objective response rate , overall clinical outcome and association 
between immune response and survival .   There is great i nterest in obtaining preliminary data 
on whether the combination of 6MHP vaccine and pembrolizumab may increase objective 
clinical response rates, PFS, or overall survival. However, patterns of care for patients are 
changing rapi[INVESTIGATOR_266156].  On one hand, the 
overall response rate for patients pretreated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_266157] 2 3%, but  for patients 
treated with pembrolizumab as first -line therapy is 33%.  Thus, powering the study for response 
rate would depend on  limiting enrollment to only one of these approaches. In addition, 
combination immunotherapy with PD -1 blockade plus CTLA -4 blockade is being employed, with 
response rates of about 50%, but with much higher toxicity than with pembrolizumab alone.  
Patients  may be selected for one of these 3 regimens (pembrolizumab first, CTLA -[ADDRESS_323913], or combination therapy) for reasons that may affect the patient populations, including 
patient frailty, age, or biomarker assessment of metastases.  Thus, the present  study is 
designed to obtain pi[INVESTIGATOR_266158], detection of 
effects on the immune responses (in all patients), and for detection of changes in the tumor 
microenvironment (in a subset of patients).  
4.3.2  Rationale f or Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification   
Pembrolizumab :   
The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab in 
solid tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at either 
2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure -response relationships of 
pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg 
Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of 
pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_78013]) and 4) the assumption that the 
dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type.  
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is  based 
on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the 
fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with 
those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will main tain individual patient 
exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy 
response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in 
melanoma that are well tolerated and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and 
to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity in the 
logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  
Standard of care in the metastatic/unresectable setting is administration of pembrolizumab for 
up to two years. Regulatory approval does not limit the time on therapy. In this study, we will 
continue pembrolizumab  for [ADDRESS_323914]:   Pembrolizumab (MK -3475)  13

 6MHP vaccine :   
The 6MHP vaccine was tested at 3 dose levels (200, 400, 800 mcg per vaccine) and no 
differences were observed in immunogenicity, Th1 profiles or in toxicity (6).  Thus the lowest 
dose of 200 mcg will be used in this protocol.  
4.3.3  Rationale for Endpoints  
The 6MHP vaccine has been administered to over 200 subjects and overall has been  well-
tolerated.   A summary of toxicities related to 6MHP administrat ion may be found in Table 2.

Pembrolizumab  has been evaluated in multiple studies with doses ranging from 1 mg/kg to 10 
mg/kg Q2W to Q3W.  Safety  data from the prior PN001 phase I clinical trial study  (479 
subjects)  suggest  that pembrolizumab is well -tolerated, with 4.2% of study subjects 
discontinuing study treatment due to a treatment -related AE  (Investigator’s Brochure) .   
The described trial is the first evaluation of  pembrolizumab  combined  with a peptide -based 
vaccine (6MHP)  and the first evaluation of any PD -1/PD -L1 antibody in combination with a 
helper -peptide vaccine .  Thus, safety is included as a primary endpoint for this trial .   Additional 
endpoints include measures of immunogenicity and clinical efficacy.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy Endpoints  
From prior clinical trials with the 6MHP vaccine, we determined that we can induce T cell 
responses to the peptides following vaccination  (5,49,54) . In addition, vaccination with 6MHP  
led to clinical responses in a modest number of subjects  (5,49) .  Administration of 
pembrolizumab with 6MHP may enhance  CD4+ T cell response s directed against tumor -derived 
peptides within the vaccine and lead to improved disease control by [CONTACT_266192] -regulation 
of the T cell response following vaccination. Accordingly, we have included endpoints to obtain 
preliminary da ta on whether combination of 6MHP with immune chec kpoint blockade improves 
immunologic and clinical outcomes compared with historical data for each single agent alone.    
Biomarker Research  
In order to optimize co mbinatorial immunotherapy approaches for the  treatment of  cancer, we 
must obtain a more complete understanding of the host: tumor relationship in the context of 
these combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . The following analyses are included as part of this study to 
evaluate the biology of host immune responses in the peripheral blood , within a lymph node 
immediately draining a vaccine site (sentinel immunized node (SIN)),  and within  sites of tumor .  
Blood and tumor tissue samples will be taken pre - and post - study drug administration to 
evaluate changes over time.  A SIN biopsy will be taken one we ek following the third vaccine  
for a subset of patients . 
Measuring T cell responses to Melanoma Antigens in the Vaccine :  To estimate whether the 
immunogenicity of 6MHP, and induction of epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -spreading, will be increase d by [CONTACT_3252] -
administration with pembrolizumab.   
We anticipate that co -administration of pembrolizumab with a helper peptide vaccine may 
increase the CD4+ T cell response to the vaccines.  We have also observed induction of CD8+ 
T cells  following vaccination w ith 6MHP , presumably due to epi[INVESTIGATOR_145052]  (7).  Thus, w e 
hypothesize that CD4 and CD8 T cell responses will increase in frequency, magnitude, and 
duration with pembrolizumab.

 Immune responses in PBMC and SI N will be measured by [CONTACT_266193], proliferation assay, 
and/or flow cytometry .  Increases in immune response rate, magnitude, and duration will all be 
of interest.  Of greatest interest will be the induction of durable helper T cell responses, defined 
as responses in PBMC at [ADDRESS_323915] for T cell 
responses to multiple antigens, using overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 15 -mers from NY -ESO -1, MelanA, MAGE -
A1, MAGE -A3, tyrosinase, and gp100, as well as for CD8+ T cell responses t o a panel of at 
least [ADDRESS_323916] of sentinel immunized node biopsy, and presence of tumor, on circulating immune 
response .  The induc tion of immune responses to vaccines are presumed to be mediated by 
[CONTACT_266194] T cells and antigen presenting cells in the vaccine -draining node (sentinel 
immunized node, SIN).  Measurement of circulating T cell responses thus may be affected by 
[CONTACT_266195] [ADDRESS_323917] SIN biopsy.   
Tumor microenvironment .  To determine whether Th1 CD4+ T cells induced by [CONTACT_266196] a favorable immune 
signature.      
Induction of T cells reactive to melanoma antigens in the circulation is necessary but not 
sufficient for tumor control.  We will test whether CD4+ T cells induc ed by [CONTACT_941] 6MHP vaccine 
infiltrate melanoma metastases, for the subset of patients (at least 12 patients)  who have tumor 
accessible for biopsy (typi[INVESTIGATOR_266159], superficial nodes, and soft tissue masses). 
Tumor tissue can be limiting; so isolation  of viable cells in adequate number from metastatic 
tumor biopsies can be challenging.  An alternate approach is to identify T cell receptors of the T 
cells induced by [CONTACT_266197].  We hypothesize that there will be increased infiltration of T cells 
induc ed by 6MHP vaccine when co -administered with pembroliz umab, compared to pre -
treatment biopsies.  We also hypothesize that expansion of Th1 CD4+ cells will support 
expansion of tumor -reactive CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment, which will be 
evaluat ed simultaneously.  
We will determine if there is evidence of a T cell response in PBMC. Immune responses are 
anticipated in more than 50% of patients.  The PBMC samples with responses and 
corresponding pretreatment PBMC samples will be prepared as isolated  CD4+ T cell 
populations by [CONTACT_266198]. Those cells will be submitted for T -cell 
receptor (TCR) sequence profiling by [CONTACT_266199] (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA), 
which will identify TCRs enriched in the PBMC and SIN as T  cells responding to the vaccines.

 We will also send frozen (or FFPE) tumor tissue for the same analysis, as a measure of 
whether T cells induced by [CONTACT_266200].   In cases where 
tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes can b e isolated in adequate quantity to perform functional 
analyses, this will be done as well, as validation of the TCR sequencing studies, but we expect 
that to be an uncommon event.  The TCR molecular analysis will be feasible in a larger 
proportion of patie nts. Associations with clinical outcome will be noted as pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299].  
To understand whether the combination therapy induces Th1 -biased immune signatures in the 
tumor microenvironment, we will perform gene expression analysis on pretreatment tumors day 
[ADDRESS_323918] chips from Affymetrix Inc, RNA -seq, or comparable analysis, and 
data analyses will be performed using Partek Genomic Suite & Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 
(IPA) software to provide principal component analysis, identifica tion of genes differentially 
expressed on day 22 (vs. day 1) to mark effects of the combination therapy.  Changes will be 
evaluated in canonical pathways, gene network, and transcription factor expression. Gene 
expression of pretreatment samples will be co rrelated with clinical responses.   
The histology evaluations will be compared to the TCR expression data, to assess whether 
infiltration with vaccine -reactive CD4+ T cells is associated with increased infiltration of CD4+ 
cells or lymphocytes overall, or with Immunotype C infiltration patterns  (55) in particular.  
Immunohistochemical stains to clarify these observations may be performed on tumors.

Pembrolizumab  
Details on the preparation and administration of pembrolizumab are provided in the Pharmacy 
Manual  for MK -3475 (pembrolizumab).

Protocol: UVA-Mel-64

University of Virginia Human Immune Therapy Center --Confidential  
 
 
 6MHP  
Details on the prepara tion of 6MHP will be provided on vaccine mixing forms .  The prepared 
peptide vaccines  will be stored in a plastic syringe and delivered to the clinicians in a plastic 
bag.  This bag with the syringe will be stored at room temperature until the vaccine is 
administered.  Ideally, the vaccine should be administered  within  1-2 hours after mixing.  If the 
vaccine is not administered within 4 hours after mixing, it should be discarded.  
Designation of Vaccine Sites  
Evidence suggests nodes proximal to a tumor site may be relatively immunosuppressed; 
therefore, the vaccination sites will be selected to be distant from the sites of tumor whenever 
possible.  In general, subject s will be vaccinated in upper arm or thigh sites with intact draining 
nodes.  Vaccines will b e administered at the designated site(s).  Chronic inflammatory reactions 
are expected to occur in patients at their vaccine sites. Induration may persist for months, but is 
not expected to require additional therapy.  Sterile abscesses may occur in some p atients.  
These are not a basis for discontinuation of the vaccines unless they lead to ulceration of 
greater than 2 cm diameter, require antibiotics, or require surgical debridement.    
Administration of 6MHP  
The vaccine regimen will be the same for all su bjects.  Days 1, 8, 15, 43, 64, 85:  200 mcg each 
of the 6 peptides (Table 5), emulsified in Montanide ISA -51 adjuvant  (2 ml total will be 
administered) .  Each of vac cines 1-6 will be admi nistered subcutaneously (50%) and 
intradermally (50%) .  Vaccines 1 -3 will be administered  at one skin site . Vaccines  4-6 will also 
be administered at one skin site, but in a separate location than vaccines 1 -3.  If either vaccine 
site has severe inflammati on or ulceration after 1 -2 vaccines, the next vaccine(s) may be 
placed near the original site.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Modification  
6MHP vaccines :  There will be no dose modifications of the vaccine components.   
In circumstances where assessment of an AE is limited, such as by [CONTACT_213899], or w hen 
laboratory studies are required to assess for other causes of toxicity, the vaccine schedule may 
be interrupted for up to [ADDRESS_323940] less of attribution.  If more than one 
vaccine is delayed by 21 days due to an AE, regardless of attribution, vaccine treatment should 
be discontinued, though the other systemic therapy may be continued.  
Pembrolizumab:   Pembrolizumab  will be withheld for d rug-related AEs as detailed  below  and in  
Table  6.  In the event that the dose of pembrolizumab is held, subjects may continue receiving 
the 6MHP vaccine  if the investigators do not believe the toxicities are attrib utable to the 
vaccines.   
Adverse events (both non -serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab  exposure may 
represent an immunologic etiology.  These adverse events may occur shortly after the first dose 
or several months after the last dose of trea tment. Pembrolizumab must  be withheld  for drug-
related  toxicities  and severe or life -threatening AEs as per Table  6, below. See Section 5.6 and 
Table 8 for supportive care guidelines, including use of corticosteroids.

Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical events or logistical reasons 
not related to study therapy  (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events, patient vac ation, 
and/or holidays). Subjects should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the 
scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the Sponsor -Investigator . The reason 
for interruption should be documented in the patient's study record.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Delayed Visit for Reasons Other Than Toxicity  
A schedule for return visits should be established at the first visit.  If a subject  misses a 
treatment, the missed treatment will be administered as soon as possible, and treatment will be 
continued for an ad ditional time period so that the subsequent vaccinations are given in the 
appropriate intervals.  Subject s who are vaccinated outside of the established schedule should 
return to the original schedule as soon as possible.  
The table below ( Table 7) defines what constitutes a delayed visit, whether the subject  should 
continue to be treated, and whether a protocol violation should be reported and recorded.  The 
range of days is counted from the original scheduled date.

Trial treat ment should be administered after all procedures/assessments have been completed 
as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart (Section 6.0).  All trial treatments will be administered on an 
outpatient basis.  
Pembrolizumab  will be administered as a 30 minute IV infu sion (treatment cycle intervals may 
be increased due to toxicity as described in Section 5. 2.1.3 .  Sites should make every effort to 
target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given the variability of 
infusion pumps from sit e to site, a window of -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., 
infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min).

5.5 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited)  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in th e exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or 
vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or 
vaccination may be requi red.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with 
the Sponsor -Investigator .  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with 
the investigator and/or the subject's primary physician.  However, the decision to con tinue the 
subject on trial therapy or vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the 
Investigator, the Sponsor -Investigator , and the subject.

Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  
Subjects may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically 
neces sary.  
The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications which are prohibited in this trial.  
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3927] -Treatment Follow -up Phase.  
5.6 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive ca re measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_124133].  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with 
potential immunologic etiology are outlined below. Where appropriate, t hese guidelines include the 
use of oral or in travenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti -inflammatory 
agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids.   Note that several courses 
of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the ster oid dose is decreased. 
For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease  or 
bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The  treatment guidelines

 are intended to be applied when the investigator  determines the events to be related to 
pembrolizumab.  
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator does not need 
to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined below). Refer to Section 5.2.1 for  dose modification.  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin 
photography as part of evaluation of the event.  
 Pneumonitis :  
o For Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improv e to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 
weeks . 
o For Grade 3 -4 events , immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  Administer 
additional anti -inflammatory measures, as needed.  
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for  opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged 
steroid administration.  
 Diarrhea/Colitis :  
Subject s should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel 
perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).   
 
o All subject s who experience diarrhea /colitis  should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrolytes should be  substituted via IV infusion.   For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, 
consider GI consultation and endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis.  
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis  that persists greater than 3 days, administer oral 
corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhe a/colitis  (or Grade 2 diarrhea that persists > 1 week ), treat 
with intravenous steroids followed by [CONTACT_78018] .   
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
 Type 1 diabet es mellitus (if new onset , including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA] ) or ≥ 
Grade 3 Hyperglycemia , if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis 
(DKA)  
 
o For T1DM  or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia  
 Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and 
for Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia associated with me tabolic acidosis or ketonuria.  
 Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, 
glycosylated hemoglobin, and C -peptide.  
 
 Hypophysitis : 
 
o For Grade [ADDRESS_323950]:   Pembrolizumab (MK -3475)  29

 started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 
 
 
 
 Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism :  
Thyroid disor ders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in 
thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated 
based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders . 
 
o Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 3 -4 hypothyroidism):  
 In hyperthyroidism, non -selective beta -blockers (e.g. propranolol) are 
suggested as initial therapy.  
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine 
or liothyronin e, is indicated per standard of care.  
o Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidism  
 Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by [CONTACT_78019]. 
When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started 
and continued over no less than 4 w eeks. Replacement of appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 
 Hepatic : 
o For Grade 2  events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until returned to 
baseline values (consider weekly).  
 Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
 Renal Failure or Nephritis : 
o For Grade 2  events, treat wi th corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
 Management of Infusion Reactions : Signs and symptoms usually  develop during or shortly 
after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.

Female subjects will be considered of non -reproductive potential if they are either:  
(1) postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical 
cause; in women < 45 years o f age a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the 
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in women not using 
hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. In the absence of 12 months of 
amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.);  
OR

OR  
(3) has a congenital or acquired condition that prev ents childbearing.  
Female and male subjects of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant or 
impregnating a partner, respectively, while receiving study drug and for [ADDRESS_323954] 
dose of study drug by [CONTACT_139649]:   
(1) practice abstinence† from heterosexual activity;  
OR  
(2) use (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception during heterosexual activity.   
Acceptable methods of contraception are‡: 
Single method (one of the following is acceptable) : 
 intrauterine device (IUD)  
 vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner  
 contraceptive rod implanted into the skin  
  
Combination method (requires use of two of the following):  
 diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical cap/sper micide)  
 cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)   
 contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only)  
 male condom or female condom (cannot be used together)  
 hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (estrogen/progesti n pi[INVESTIGATOR_64870] -only 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous contraceptive

 considered acceptable by [CONTACT_176742]/IRBs.  Periodic abstinence 
(e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto -thermal, post -ovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal are 
not acceptable methods of contraception.  
 ‡If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by [CONTACT_427]/guidelines, then it 
does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for subjects participating at sites 
in this country/region.  
Subjects should be informed that taking the stu dy medication may involve unknown risks to the 
fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate in the 
study , subjects of childbearing potential  must adhere  to the contraception requirement 
(described above) from th e day of study medication initiation (or 14 days prior to the initiation of 
study medication for oral contraception)  throughout the study period up to [ADDRESS_323955]’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or 
terminated.  The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor -Investigator  and to 
[COMPANY_006] without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., 
death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -threatening complication to the 
mother or newborn).  The study investigator will make every effort to obta in permission to follow 
the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor -
Investigator .  If a male subject impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site 
must be informed immediately and the pregna ncy reported to the Sponsor -Investigator  and to

Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at the 
discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_211293] -Investigator  if enrollment into the trial is 
inappropriate, the trial plan is violated, or for administrative and/o r other safety reasons.  
Specific details regarding discontinuation or withdrawal are provided in Section 7.1.4 – Other 
Procedures.  
Protocol treatment includes both the 6MHP vaccine and pembrolizumab.  Either or both may be 
discontinued for any of the foll owing reasons.   
 The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws 
consent.  
 Confirmed radiographic disease progression

 Note : A subject may be granted an exception to continue on treatment with confirmed 
radiographic progres sion if clinically stable or clinically improved .  Patients with 
progressive disease  should undergo a second scan at least 4 weeks later to confirm 
progression and exclude the possibility of a tumor flare reaction, according to immune -
related response crit eria ( irRC) guidelines . 
 Any dose -limiting toxicity (DLT), as defined in  Section 7.2.[ADDRESS_323957] ice guidelines, including use of steroids 
when indicated.   Also, if a patient is discontinued from PD -1 antibody but not from 
vaccine, the visits every 3 weeks for PD -1 antibody, and the associated safety studies 
(e.g.: CBC, chemistries) do not need to be  performed.  
 Disease progression requiring other therapy (e.g. surgery under general anesthesia, 
radiation, chemotherapy, or steroid therapy).  The appearance of small metastases or 
recurrent tumor deposits will not be a basis for discontinuing the vaccinat ions.  Biopsy to 
determine the nature of new lesions, or minor surgical procedures to excise a new lesion, 
will not be a basis for discontinuing vaccinations.  Also, surgery to perform a biopsy of 
tumor at day 22, in accord with the protocol, will not be a  basis for discontinuing therapy, 
whether done under local anesthesia or general anesthesia.   
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
 Initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or targeted therapy for melanoma 
or other cancer.  
 Initiation of systemic steroid therapy, or other  systemic  immunosuppressive therapy , 
except  that steroid or immunosuppressive therapy for management of toxicities of 
pembrolizumab is allowed without discontinuation of vaccines.    
 Any other  potential adverse reaction deemed sufficiently serious to warrant 
discontinuation of therapy by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_266167].  
 Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject  
 The subject has a confirmed positive serum pr egnancy test  
 Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements  
 The subject is lost to follow -up 
 Completed 24 months of uninterrupted treatment with pembrolizumab or 35 
administrations of study medication, whichever is later.  
Note: [ADDRESS_323958] dose. Subjects 
who stop pembrolizumab after 24 months may be eligible for additional pembrolizumab 
treatment as part of their clinical care  if they progress after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_262] .  
 Administrativ e reasons  
 
The End of Treatment and Follow -up visit procedures are listed in Section 6  (Protocol Flow 
Chart) and Section 7.1.5  (Visit Requirements).  After the end of treatment, each subject will be 
followed for 30 days for adverse event monitoring (seriou s adverse events will be collected for 
90 days after the end of treatmen t as described in section [IP_ADDRESS].1  and [IP_ADDRESS] ).  Subjects who 
discontinue for reasons other than progressive disease will have post -treatment follow -up for 
disease status until disea se progression, initiating a non -study cancer treatment, withdrawing

Protocol: UVA-Mel-64  
Version Date:    07/13/[ADDRESS_323959] to follow -up (every [ADDRESS_323960] discontinuation up to 2 years  or until 
the toxicity resolves ).  After documented disease progression each subject will be followe d by 
[CONTACT_266204], withdrawal of consent, or until study  closure , 
whichever occurs first.  
5.[ADDRESS_323961]  who is enrolled but does not receive  any pembrolizumab or 6MHP,  or any of the 
study -related procedures may  be replaced.  Every attempt will be made to evaluate data for 
endpoint assessment from subjects who withdrawal from the study .    
5.10 Clinical Criteria for Early Trial Termination  
Early trial termination will be the result of the criteria sp ecified below:  
1. Quality or quantity of data recording is inaccurate or incomplete  as determined by [CONTACT_429] -Investigator.  
2. Poor adherence to protocol and regulatory requirements  
3. Incidence or severity of adverse drug reaction in this or other studies indic ates a potential 
health hazard to subjects  
4. Plans to modify or discontinue the development of the study drug  
In the event of [COMPANY_006] decision to no longer supply study drug, ample notification will be 
provided so that appropriate adjustments to subject treatm ent can be made.

7.0 TRIAL PROCEDURES  
7.1 Trial P rocedures  
The Trial Flow Chart - Section 6.0 summarizes the trial procedures to be performed at each 
visit.  Individual trial procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to perform 
these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed cl inically necessary by [CONTACT_093].  
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1034] -
Investigator  and/or [COMPANY_006] for reasons related to subject safety. In some cases, such 
evaluation/testing may be potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus 
local regulations may require that additional informed consent be obtained from the subject.  In 
these cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.  
7.1.1  Administrative  Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Informed Consent  
The Investigator must obtain documented consent from each potential subject prior to 
participating in a clinical trial . 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_323974]’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_4388] [CONTACT_941] s ubject’s legally 
acceptable representative’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a consent form along with the dated signature 
[CONTACT_63564].  
A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the subject before participation 
in the trial.  
The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form and 
any written information provided to the subject must receive the IRB/ERC’s approval/favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_19349].  The subject or his/her legal ly acceptable representative will be 
informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available that may be relevant to the 
subject’s willingness to continue participation in the trial.  The communication of this information 
will be provided and docu mented via a revised consent form or addendum to the original 
consent form that captures the subject’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_4388] [CONTACT_423]’s legally acceptable 
representative’s dated signature.  
Specifics about a trial and the trial population will be added t o the consent form template at the 
protocol level.   
The informed consent will adhere to IRB/ERC requirements, applicable laws and regulations 
and Sponsor -Investigator  requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed by [CONTACT_80081].

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Trial Compliance (Medication/Die t/Activity/Other)  
Treatment compliance may be evaluated through drug accountability assessments and through 
the evaluation of subject medical records and CRF documents.  
7.1.2  Clinical Procedures/Assessments  
The following evaluations will be performed on an outpa tient basis.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring  
The investigator or qualified designee will assess each subject to evaluate for potential new or 
worsening AEs as specified in the Trial Flow Chart and more frequently if clinically indicated.  
Toxicity diaries will also be distributed to subject s and reviewed by [CONTACT_3462].  Adverse 
experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study and during the follow -up period 
according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 (see Section 12.2).  Toxicities will be character ized in 
terms regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken with regard to trial 
treatment.  
All AEs of unknown etiology associated with pembrolizumab exposure should be evaluated to 
determine if it is possibly an event of clinical i nterest (ECI) of a potentially immunologic etiology 
(irAE).  See Section 5.6.1  regarding the identification, evaluation and management of AEs of a 
potential immunological etiology.   
Please refer to section 7.2  for detailed information regarding the assess ment and recording of 
AEs.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Physical Exam s 
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical exam during the 
screening period.  Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical 
history.   
Physical exams will inc lude the following:  
 vital signs  (temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure)  
 weight,  
 ECOG performance status,  
 medication review,  
 neurologic function -general  
 
 Height will be measured at screening only  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Signs  
The investigator or qualified designee will take vital signs at screening, prior to the 
administration of each dose of trial treatment and at treatment discontinuation as specified in 
the Trial Flow Chart (Section 6.0).  Vital signs should include temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], weight and blood pressure.  Height will be measured at screening only.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale  
The investigator or qualified designee will assess ECOG status (see Section 12.1 ) as specified 
in the Trial Flow Chart.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Designation of Vaccine Sites  
Evidence suggests nodes proximal to a tumor site may be relatively immunosuppressed; 
therefore, the vaccination sites will be selected to be distant from the sites of tumor whenever 
possible.  In general, subject s will be vaccinat ed in upper arm or thigh sites with intact draining 
nodes.  Vaccines will be administered at the designated site(s).   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Visual Assessments  
Visual acuity will be assessed using the Snellen chart.  
Color vision will be assessed using an Ishihara eye chart.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease  
Tumor Imaging  
Tumor imaging may include CT/PET -CT scans and/or MRI.  These will complement physical 
exam and other imaging as required, but the primary measures of clinical response will be 
based on CT/PET -CT and/or MR I and will use RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_323979] 1.1 Criteria will be used to evaluate tumor burden  (Section 12.3).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor Tissue Collection and Correlative Studies Blood Sampling  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_323980] one site of  measurable disease.   Biopsy sites  may be in nodes, 
skin, soft tissue, liver, or other sites that can be accessed by [CONTACT_65015], incisional or 
excisional biopsy.  Biopsies may be completed  with or without image guidance.   
Size Requirements  
A critical component of this protocol is the h istologic and cytologic evaluation of changes in 
immune effectors and the tumor microenvironment after vaccination and systemic therapy.  A 
minimum of 0.1 6 cm3 but ideally 0.3 cm3 or more of tumor tissue will be needed for each biopsy 
time point as describ ed in the inclusion criteria. Biopsies may be taken from a single lesion or 
multiple lesions at each of the time points depending on the size of each lesion.  If taken from 
multiple lesions, those lesions should be similar.  For example, three non -ulcerate d skin 
metastases would be considered similar; one bleeding small bowel metastasis would not be 
considered similar to a subcutaneous nodule).  
Sampling

Protocol: UVA-Mel-64  
Version Date:    07/13/18  
  
 
  
 The biopsies will vary based on the clinical scenario and may include six core biopsies, an 
incisional bi opsy or an excisional biopsy as outlined in the inclusion criteria . 
Procedure  
When appropriate (and we anticipate the majority of cases) the biopsies will be performed 
under local anesthesia (typi[INVESTIGATOR_266168] 1% and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1:100,000 injection +  or - 
8.4% sodium bicarbonate ), in the outpatient clinic or comparable procedure room, using sterile 
technique.  In cases when clinical standard of care requires a larger procedure the biopsies 
may be performed in the operating room under standard techniqu e. 
To minimize errors in analysis due to sampling error and specimen heterogeneity, each study 
biopsy specimen will be divided into several components and randomly allocated into various 
preservation conditions . Ideally, tissue will be divided into the fol lowing preservation conditions, 
using core needle biopsies (19 mm long and 2 mm diameter; about 80 mm3), or incisional or 
excisional biopsies with at least the same minimum tissue volume:  
It is most critical to obtain the following:  
 Formalin : 1 core biopsy  or similar tissue volume (about 80 mm3 or greater)  will be fixed 
in formalin, then paraffin -embedded (for histology/immunohistology)  
 
 Quick -frozen : 2 core biopsies or similar tissue volume (each about 80 mm3 or greater)  
quick -frozen processed for protein studies , histology, or nucleic acid studies. If only one 
core can be obtained, t his portion should be provided as two specimens (eg cut the 
core biopsy specimen in half).  
 
When sufficient tissue is available, the following should also be obtained:  
 RNA -later: 1 core biopsy  or similar tissue volume (about 80 mm3 or greater)  will be 
placed in RNA -later (for RNA/RT PCR)  
 Viable cell suspension :  2 core biopsies or similar tissue volume (total about 160 mm3 
or greater)  will be processed for single -cell suspension  by [CONTACT_266205], 
then enzymatic digestion (collagenase, hyaluronidase, DNAase).  The resulting 
suspensions will be cryopreserved in FBS serum and DMSO (for cellular immune 
function and flow cytometry).  
 If there is additional tissue, it may be  processed for additional immunologic studies.  
 
The incisions will be sutured closed.   Toxicities related to the biopsies will be recorded.    
Based on our experience in prior clinical trials ( Mel48 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), Mel51 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) , 
and Mel53 (NCT0126473 1)), it is adequate, for each specimen, to have at least the equivalent 
of a core biopsy specimen that is 19  mm long and 2 mm in diameter (about 80 mm3), or a cubic 
specimen 5 mm in width. Thus, for 1 FFPE and 1-2 QF specimens, we need about 160-240 
mm3 (2-3 cores, or 1 lesion about 7-10 mm in diameter).  For those with larger specimens (>1 
cm diameter), some will also be saved as viably cryopreserved single cell suspensions.  
A 5 micron section of each tumor specimen will be stained by H&E and reviewed to assess the 
extent and quality of viable tumor. For FFPE specimens, only those with at least 4 mm2 viable 
tumor (on cross -section) will be considered evaluable for histologic and immunohistologic 
studies. FFPE tissue will be evaluated for immunotype and for  immune cell infiltrates. For QF 
specimens, those with at least 70% tumor will be considered evaluable.

 Tissue samples may be screened for antigen expression or protein profiles using tests such as 
Western blots, immunohistochemistry, PCR, flo w cytometry or gene chip analysis.   
Tumor escape mechanisms may also be evaluated.   
Specimens will be used in immunological assays to assess T cell function or antibody 
response.  Assays generally used for this type of testing include, but are not limite d to, ELIspot 
assays, ELISAs, chromium -release assays, proliferation assays, intracellular cytokine staining, 
and T cell receptor sequencing.   
Specimens may be used to study the immunologic aspects of the tumor microenvironment or 
as targets or controls i n laboratory assays.  
Specimens may be used to establish cell lines for long -term studies . 
This tissue may also be compared to lesions resected prior to enrollment, which will be 
requested from the pathology department of each institution as paraffin -embed ded tissue 
samples, and these tissues may be banked for use in future studies.

7.1.4  Other Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sentinel Immunized Node (SIN) Biopsy  
The SIN biopsy  will be perform ed until the approval of the protocol modification  where the 
requirement for SIN biopsy was removed  (through protocol v04 -04-17).  Thereafter, SIN 
biopsies will not be performed.  
Procedure  
The node (sentinel immu nized node, SIN) will be identified by [CONTACT_266208] (usually technetium 
99 sulfur colloid) injection, with or without lymphoscintigraphy imaging, and with use of a 
handheld gamma probe during the procedure. This will be performed under local anesthesia in 
the clinic, in conjunction with the vaccine site biopsy, by a qualified surgeon.   
Lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_266169], usually in the nuclear medicine suite, after intradermal 
injection with radiocolloid (typi[INVESTIGATOR_266170] 99 -sulfur colloid).   The node  excision will be 
performed under local anesthesia (usually  lidocaine HCl 1 -2%, with or without epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 
1:100,000 injection, with or without 8.4% sodium bicarbonate ), in the outpatient clinic or 
comparable procedure room, using sterile technique.  A ha ndheld gamma probe will be used.  
When possible, the node will be sectioned into 5 sections:  a central  section (10 -20% of the  
node), leaving  two adjacent sections of about 40% each.  These latter two sections will be 
bisected.  They will be allocated into various preservation conditions:  
 1 central section  will be fixed in formalin, then paraffin -embedded  
 (for histology/immunohistology)  
 1 section will be placed in RNA -later. (for RNA/RT PCR)  
 1 section will be quick -frozen (for immunohistology/protein studie s) 
 2 sections (40%) will be processed for single cell suspension by  [CONTACT_266209], then enzymatic digestion (collagenase, hyaluronidase, DNAase).  The 
resulting suspensions will be cryopreserved in FBS and DMSO (for cellular immune 
function and  flow cytometry).   
If there is additional tissue, it may be processed for additional immunologic or angiogenic 
studies.  
The incisions will be sutured closed.  
Toxicities related to the biopsies will be recorded.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
When a subject di scontinues/withdraws prior to trial completion, all applicable activities 
scheduled for the final trial visit should be performed at the time of discontinuation.  Any 
adverse events which are present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawal should be foll owed 
in accordance with the safety requirements outlined in Section 7.[ADDRESS_323982]:   Pembrolizumab (MK -3475)  48

7.2 Assessing , Recording,  and Reporting Adverse Events  
7.2.1  Definitions  
Adverse Event  (AE): An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a 
patient or clinical investigation subje ct administered a pharmaceutical product and which does 
not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can 
therefore be any unfavorable  and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for 
example), s ymptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or 
protocol -specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or 
protocol -specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adver se change in 
frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associ ated with the use 
of the study drugs or protocol -specified procedure  is also an adverse event.  
Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not var y significantly in 
frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events.   
[COMPANY_006]  product includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, device, diagnostic 
agent or protocol -specified procedure, whether investigationa l (including placebo or active

Protocol: UVA-Mel-64  
Version Date:    07/13/18  
  
 
  
 comparator medication) or marketed, manufactured by, licensed by, provided by [CONTACT_266210].  
6MHP includes the [ADDRESS_323990] and 6MHP in clinical 
trials or as prescribed in clinical practice, from overdose (whether accidental or intentional), 
from abuse and from withdrawal.  
Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event.  
Unexpected AE  – Any adverse event not described in section 7.2.5 . 
Serious AE:   A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose during the 
study that : 
 Results in death;  
 Is life threatening;  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
 Resu lts in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
 Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study);  
 Is associated with an overdose;  
 Is an other important medical event  
Refer to Table 10 for additional details regarding each of the above criteria.  Note:  In addition to 
the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of the below criteria, although not  serious per 
ICH definition, are repor table to the [COMPANY_006] in the same timeframe as SAEs to meet certain local 
requirements. Therefore, these events are considered serious by [CONTACT_131892] : 
 Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study);  
 Is associated with an overdose.  
 
Unanticipated problem  - An unanticipated problem is any event/experience that meets ALL 3 
criteria below:  
 Is unexpected in terms of nature, severity or frequency given the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents AND in the 
characteristics of t he subject  population being studied.  
 Is related or possibly related to participation in research.  This means that there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident may have been caused by [CONTACT_266211].   
 The incident suggests that the research placed the subject  or others at greater risk of 
harm than was previously known or recognized OR results in actual harm to the 
subject  or others.  
 
Protocol Violation -  A protocol violation is defined as any change, deviation, or departure from 
the study design or procedures of a research project that is NOT approved by [CONTACT_8236]’s 
IRB prior to its initiation or implementation, OR deviation from  standard operating procedures, 
Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), fed eral, state or local regulations. Protocol violations may or 
may not be under the control of the study team or UVa staff. These protocol violations may be 
major or minor violations.

 Suspected Adverse Reaction  (as defined in 21 CFR 312.32 (a)) - Any adverse event for which 
there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  
7.2.2  Attribution Assessment  
Attribution – The determination of whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment 
or procedure.  The attribution groups are:  
Defini te – Applies to those adverse events which, the investigator feels are incontrovertibly 
related to study drug .  An adverse event may be assigned an attribution of definitely related if or 
when (must have all of the following):  
 It follows a reasonable tempo ral sequence from administration of the test drug.  
 It could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612] ’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered 
to the subject . 
 It disappears or de creases on cessation or reduction in dose with re -exposure to 
drug.  (Note: This is not to be constructed as requiring re -exposure of the subject ; 
however, the group of definitely related can only be used when a recurrence is 
observed.)  
 It follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
 
Probable  – Applies to those adverse events for which, after careful consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, are felt with a high degree of certainty to be related to the test drug.  An 
adverse event may be consi dered probably related if or when (must have three of the 
following):  
 It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the test drug.  
 It could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612] ’s 
clinical state, environ mental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered 
to the subject . 
 It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose.  There are important 
exceptions when an adverse event does not disappear upon discontinuation of the 
drug, yet dru g-relatedness clearly exists (e.g. bone marrow depression, fixed drug 
eruptions, tardive dyskinesia).  
 It follows a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
 
Possible  – Applies to those adverse events for which, after careful consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, a connection with the test drug administration appears unlikely but cannot 
be ruled out with certainty.  An adverse event may be considered possibly related if or when 
(must have two of the following):  
 It follows a reasonable temporal seq uence from administration of the test drug.  
 It could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state, environmental 
or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject . 
 It follows a known p attern of response to the test drug. 
 
Unlikely  – Applies to those adverse events for which, after careful consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, are judged to be unrelated to the test drug.  An adverse event may be 
considered unlikely if or when (must have two of the following):  
 It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the test 
drug.

  It could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state, environmental or 
toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject . 
 It does not f ollow a known pattern of response to the test drug.  
 It does not reappear or worsen when the drug is re -administered.  
 
Unrelated  – Applies to those adverse events, which after careful consideration, are clearly and 
incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc.).  
7.2.3  Evaluating Adverse Events  
An investigator who is a qualified clinician will evaluate all adverse events according to the NCI 
Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Any adverse event which changes 
CTCAE gra de over the course of a given epi[INVESTIGATOR_130977]/worksheets.  
All adverse events regardless of CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for seriousness.

 Table 10.  Evaluating Adverse Events  
An investigator who is a qualified clinician, will evaluate all adverse events as to:  
V4.0 CTCAE 
Grading  Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mid symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.  
 Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or non invasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL.  
 Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77991]; disabling; 
limiting self -care ADL.  
 Grade 4  Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.

 †Results in death ; or 
 †Is life threatening; or  places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (Note: This doe s not include an 
adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. ); or 
 †Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions); or  
 †Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_266171], regardless of length of stay, even if the

documented in the patient’s medical history.) ; or 
 †Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  (in offspring of subject taking  the product regardless of time to diagnosis);or  
 Is a new cancer;  (that is not a condition of the study) ; (although not serious per ICH definition, is reportable to the Sponsor -Investigator  within 24 hours and to [COMPANY_006] 
within 2 working days to meet certa in local requirements); or 
 Is an overdose  (whether accidental or intentional).  Any adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a serious adverse event  for collection purposes . An 
overdose that is not associated with an adverse event is consi dered a non -serious event of clinical interest and must be reported within [ADDRESS_323992] and may require medical or surgical interventio n to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
previously (designated above by a †).  
Durati on Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than [ADDRESS_323993]  or 6MHP  to be discontinued?  
Relationship 
to 
investigational  
drug  Did the [COMPANY_006] product or 6MHP cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that the [COMPANY_006] product or 6MHP caused the adverse event will be 
provided by [CONTACT_19427] a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted 
on the AE form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be retained  for the required regulatory time frame. 
The criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test dr ug and the adverse 
event based upon the available information.  
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the [COMPANY_006] product and 6MHP and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the 
components and their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the [COMPANY_006] product or 6MHP caused the adverse event (AE):  
 Exposure  Is there evidence  that the subject was actually exposed to the [COMPANY_006] product or 6MHP such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment 
(pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
 Time Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the [COMPANY_006] product  or 6MHP ?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal product)?  
 Likely Cause  Is the AE n ot reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26369], other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmen tal factors

vaccine.  Small ulcerati ons of the skin at vaccine sites are expected in a subset of subjects 
and are not considered DLTs.  Ulcerations will be considered DLTs only if the ulcers are > 2 
cm in diameter, require antibiotics or surgical debridement.  
Pembrolizumab

7.2.7  Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Time Span for Reporting Adverse Events  
Reporting of AEs will begin when the subject  is administered the  study drug or has a study 
related biopsy.  Reporting will continue through 30 days following cessation of treatment and at 
each examination on the Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets. The reporting timeframe 
for adverse events meeting any serious criter ia is described below . The i nvestigator will make 
every attempt to follow all subjects with non -serious adverse events for outcome.  
 All adverse events that occur after the consent form is signed, but before tr eatment allocation  
must be reported by [CONTACT_26364], or 
are the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or 
discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.  
Adverse events will not be collected for subjec ts during the pre -screening period (for 
determination of archival tissue status) as long as that subject has not undergone any protocol -
specified procedure or intervention.  If the subject requires a blood draw, fresh tumor biopsy 
etc., the subject is firs t required to provide consent to the main study and AEs will be captured 
according to guidelines for standard AE reporting.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Process for Recording Adverse Events  
Dose -limiting toxicities  
DLTs will be entered into OnC ore within 5 calendar days of the study t eam learning of the 
event. DLT’s that are deemed serious and unexpected will be submitted to the IRB per 
institutional guidelines (see below).  
Other AEs     
AEs must be recorded into the University of Virginia Cancer Center OnCore database per the 
guideline s in Table 113.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the Spons or-
Investigator and to [COMPANY_006]  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be defined as any dose exceeding the prescribed 
dose for pembrolizumab by 20% over the prescribed dose. No specific information is available 
on the treatment of overdose of pembroliz umab . In the event of overdose, pembrolizumab 
should be discontinued and the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  
Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
If an adverse event(s)  is associated with ( “results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006] product , the 
adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria 
are met.  
If a dose of [COMPANY_006]’s product  meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any 
assoc iated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non -
serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional 
overdose without adverse effect.”  
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours to 
the Sponsor -Investigator and within 2 working days hours to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn:

7.2.8  Sponsor Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events  
All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and investigators in 
accordance with all applicable global laws and regulations.  
8.0 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATI ONS  
8.1 Design  
This is an early phase trial to assess the safety  and immunogenicity of the combination therapy 
of a helper peptide vaccine (6MHP) plus PD -1 blockade (pembrolizumab) in patients with 
advanced melanoma.  In addition, exploratory analysis of clini cal benefit will be described.   
8.2 Evaluation of Sample Populations and Criteria  
8.2.1  Safety  
All participant s receiving any protocol treatment will be evaluated for safety. The 6MHP vaccine 
has been safe, with lower toxicities than with class I peptides, in part icular with lower 
autoimmune or hyperimmune toxicities. Based upon reported results in th e patient population 
treated with pembrolizumab  (51), drug -related serious adverse  events occurred in 7/89 (7.9%, 
95% CI( 3.2, 15.5%))  of participant s treated at the 2mg/kg dose every 3 weeks . These results 
are assumed to be reflective of the safety profile for the 200 mg study dose , as described  in 
section 4.3.2.  Thus, this trial will be designed with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_266175]. Specifically, f ormal safety bounds based upon 
monitoring dose -limiting toxicities (DLT) attributed to 6MHP or pembrolizumab  will guide 
decision s about early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_266176] c oncerns.  
DLTs will be defined based on the agent to which they are attributed, as specified in section 
7.2.6.  If a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_266177], co -investigators and the DSMC can review the data , and determine if the study should  
continue, be amended or be closed to further accrual.   
8.2.2  Immunogenicity  
All eligible participant s receiving any protocol treatment will be evaluated for the following 
immune response parameters.

8.2.3  Clinical efficacy  
All participant s receiving any protocol treatment will be evaluated for clinical benef it to treatment 
as defined by [CONTACT_70731].  
 Clinical  response  by [CONTACT_393] 1.1  
 Clinical response  by [CONTACT_19104]  
 Progression -free survival  (PFS), defined as the time from the date of start of treatment 
to the date of progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. A participant  
who dies without a reported progression will be considered an event on the date of 
death. Participant s who have neither progressed nor died will be censored on the date 
of last evaluable tumor assessment . 
 Overall survi val (OS),  defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to the date 
of death from any cause. Participant s who do not experience an event (death) will be

in blood  through month 12 for arms C and D (which included vaccination with  6MHP ) resulted in 
a high durable response rate  in the blood  (at least two 5 -fold increases) of 20% with an upper 
bound 90% CI of 26.7% . Lower responses (at least two 2 -fold increases) occurred in 32% of 
subjects ( upper bound 90% CI of 39.1% ). Based upon these prior results, for this study we 
would be interested in detecting an improvement in the percent of high durable responders in 
the blood from a null rate of 20% to 45% (above the low responder upper limit ) using a using a 
fixed sample design with approximate  type I and type II error rates of 10% (α=β=0.10). Note, 
Mel44 did not include assessments in the SIN thus sample size determination is based upon 
prior results for the blood only.  
Accrual of a total of 2 2 eligible participants provides 90% power to test f or a null high immune 
response rate of 20% vs an alternative high immune response rate of 45% with a one -side 10% 
level binomial test. At study conclusion the null hypothesis will be rejected and the treatment

experience a  high durable im mune response.  
Maximum target sample size is estimated to be 25 participant s, which assumes a 10% 
dropout/ineligibility/lost to follow -up adjustment. Accrual is estimated at approximatel y [ADDRESS_324010] entry stratification by [CONTACT_266216] 22 ; (yes/no).   Target sample size for participant s for whom 
biopsies are obtained is set at a minimum of 12 eligible participant s. If increased infiltration of 
CD4+ response on day 22 compared to day 1 is observed in  the tumor in  9/12 participant s then  
the lower limit of a one -sided 90% confidence interval exceeds 50% and this would be 
considered a promising result and support ive of  further study of the treatment regimen.  
Similarly, i f increased infiltration of CD8+ response on day 22 compared to day 1 is observed in  
the tumor in  9/12 participant s then this would be considered a promising result and support ive 
of further study of the treatment regimen.  
 
8.5 Safety Monitoring  
Toxicities will be monitored using CTCAE 4.03 criteria. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_266178] d on the 
serious adverse  events rate of 7.9% (95% CI(3.2, 15.5%)) reported by [INVESTIGATOR_50517], [ADDRESS_324011] ( SPRT) based upon a binomial test of proportions for DLTs will 
be used.  Only the upper boundary will be used for monitoring to protect against excessive

 Previous methods used to measur e responses to 6MHP include ELIspot assay s, proliferation 
assay s, and flow cytometry (Mel41, Mel44, E1602 trials) .  In the proposed trial, the study 
hypothesis will be tested using the direct ELIspot assay  results from the blood .  The criteria for 
defining immune responses have been reported for ELIspot assays  (54).  The circulating CD4+ 
T cell response rate to 6MHP peptides in participant s treated with 6MHP vaccine plus PD -1 will 
be assessed at each time noted in the study calendar. Hypothesis testing will be based upon 
the number of participant s that satisfy the criteria  of high durable immune response  in the 
blood . The proportion of participant s with high immune response overall as measured in the 
SIN or blood will be calculated along with 90% confidence intervals.      
Secondary measures will also be used to evaluate 6M HP specific CD4+ T cell responses.  Flow 
cytometry has value in defining the responding cell population and the function of responding  
cells using  multi -parameter staining.  CyTOF mass cytometry also is evolving as a valuable 
method. Additional  methods may  be incorporated over time as new technologies are developed 
and validated; however, for the purposes of testing the study hypothesis, the direct ELIspot 
assay will used as the primary measure.  A secondary endpoint will also be to assess the CD4+ 
T cell re sponse to 6MHP in the sentinel immunized node, using methods used for assessment 
of circulating responses.  
Our prior measures of immune response in the blood to the 6MHP resulted in high durable 
immune response rates of 20%. An observed high immune respons e rate of 36% overall would 
support further study of the treatment regimen.   Other measures assessed over time in the 
blood include a) epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -spreading for circulating CD8+ T cells reactive to a panel of defined 
melanoma antigens  by [CONTACT_266217] , and  b) production of serum IgG reactive to 6MHP , by 
[CONTACT_46096] .   
Assessments in the tumor microenvironment include assessment of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells 
into melanoma  by [CONTACT_9064]/immunofluorescence and/or by [CONTACT_4133] . Each 
participant  will be as sessed for the endpoints of interest and the proportion of participant s 
experiencing an event (immune response, IgG antibody response to 6MHP, presence of CD8+ 
T cell infiltrates into the tumor (a subset), etc) will be estimated along with 95% confidence 
intervals. Repeated measure models will be used to estimate changes over time in interval  
measurements in the blood and tissue.  
Participant s will be assessed for clinical response and will be classified by [CONTACT_266218] 52  and at final asses sment. ORR will be estimated along with a 95% 
confidence interval around the point estimate.  
TTR, PFS, DFS and OS distributions will be estimated by [CONTACT_266219]. Other summary measures for time to event distributions  will include estimates and

 12.6 Vaccine Lot Release and Stability Testing  
A. Preparation of the synthetic melanoma and tetanus peptides  
All peptides were synthesized under GMP conditions by [CONTACT_266226] (San Diego, 
CA).   
Peptide preparation and vialing were performed under GMP conditions by [CONTACT_213933] ([COMPANY_006] 
Biosciences AG, Laufelfingen, Switzerland).  Documentation relating to th e procedures used to 
prepare and vial the peptides were included in the Chemistry and Manufacturing Section of prior 
IND application applications ([ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE]).   
B. Quality Assurance Testing  
Prepared peptides were subjected to the following tests:  
1. Identity .  Identity was confirmed by [CONTACT_213935].  The individual peptides were tested for 
identity by [CONTACT_450] (to define molecular mass and amino acid sequence) and 
HPLC (to confirm purity) in a GMP laboratory (Polypeptide Group).  
2. Purity.  Purity was assessed before and after vialing the peptide mixtures.  Before vialing the 
peptide mixtures, each synthetic peptide was evaluated for the presence of a single dominant 
species by [CONTACT_266227] (HPLC) in a GMP laborat ory (Polypeptide 
Group).  Purity of each peptide component exceeded 90%. Variants of the original peptide 
may have included incomplete products of synthesis, minor degradation products due to 
oxidation of methionine residues, and dimerization of cysteine -containing peptides.  After 
vialing the peptide mixture, purity was reconfirmed by [CONTACT_266228] a GMP laboratory (Clinalfa).  
3. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) .  The amount of total fluorine in each peptide preparation was less 
than 0.5% or 5000 ppm as determined by [CONTACT_266226].  
4. Potency .  Peptides are synthesized under GMP conditions and the net peptide content 
calculated for each.  The amounts of each peptide (mcg quantities) added to the vaccine vials 
are calculated based on the net peptide content o f the original stock of lyophilized peptides.  
5. Pyrogenicity .  Pyrogenicity testing was conducted by [CONTACT_266229].  
6. General Safety .  General safety testing was conducted by [CONTACT_266229].  
7. Sterility.  Sterility testing was conducted by [CONTACT_266230].  
8. Stability .  The peptide preparations were assayed for stability at months 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 
and were shown to be stable. The peptides will continue to be assessed  yearly for stability 
while subjects are on active treatment.  The following analyses will be performed to confirm 
stability.  
a. HPLC :  HPLC will be performed to confirm purity.  An optical comparison to previous 
HPLC data will be performed.  Ideally, the purity of each peptide  component will exceed 
90% (94% -98%).  Variants of the original peptide may include incomplete products of 
synthesis, minor degradation products due to oxidation of methionine residues, and 
dimerization of cysteine -containing peptides .  Such minor variants will be tolerated as 
long as the peptide represents at least 75% of the intended peptide species.  Because 
measures of peptide quantity are subject to variability, a peptide lot will be rejected only if 
two sequential measures fail t o meet the criterion stated above

 1 Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according 
to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (International Con ference on 
Harmonization ICHE6), the Code of Federal Regulations Title [ADDRESS_531428] cancer (BC) is the most common 
cancer in women worldwide, disproportionately affecting low - and middle -income countries 
(LMICs):  
• Today, 52.6% of new breast cancer cases occur in LMICs, and this is expected to grow to 
70% by [CONTACT_68089] 2020.i 
• Two-thirds of the estimated 15,000,[ADDRESS_531429] cancer 
globally are from LMICs.ii 
• 5-year survival is 40- 60% in most LMICs as compared to 80- 90% in High Income Countries 
(HICs).iii 
Lack of secondary prevention programs (population based screening) and enhanced 
treatment, are t he two major differentiating factors for poorer breast cancer outcomes in LMICs. 
Tumors detected as a result of routine screening tend to be smaller, well differentiated and less 
likely to have regional lymph-  node involvement, making treatment more effect ive and survival 
more likely.iv,v,vi Smaller, earlier -stage tumors are amenable to better, less costly treatment 
options. The National Cancer Institute -supported Cancer Intervention and Surveillance and 
Modeling Network (CISNET) suggests that 28–65% (median 46%) of the observed decrease in 
BC mortality in [LOCATION_003] can be attributed to screening, with the remainder attributed to adjuvant 
treatment.  
1.[ADDRESS_531430] exam (CBE) are the standards of 
care for BC screening and detection. Their efficacy, cost -effectiveness and effect on survival and 
mortality of BC have been well documented. However, availability and/or use of these 
modalities remain limited in LMICs.  
Organized screening mammography  is expensive, resource intensive, requires stringent 
quality assurance and a large, well -trained workforce of technicians and radiologists. The cost 
per year of life saved ranges between Int.$3,468 and Int.$16,000,vii viii which is beyond the health 
spending capabilities of most LMICs. In terms of human resources , most LMICs simply do not 
have the radiology expertise capacity required for an effective mammographic screening 
program. India, for example, has 10% the number of radiologists of the U.S. but almost [ADDRESS_531431] women under 50 years of age.  Culturally , in LMICs there are reservations about 
radiation based, somet imes painful mammogram tests.x So even when mammography is 
available, it is often not utilized; Mexico’s Ministry of Health reports that only 25% of the 
installed mammography units are in use.xi 
CBE . The World Health Organization and the Breast Health Globa l Initiative recognize 
CBE as a cost -effective measure to screen for BC in LMICs. In a study in Indonesia, CBE 
performed nearly as well as single- view mammography.xii In an IARC -supported, cluster -
[ADDRESS_531432] cancers.xiii It is known however that the efficacy of CBE may be substantially lower (28 -
36%) in practice than is reported in clinical trials.xiv Physical exams in community health 
practice are often less systematic and  poorer quality than in many organized clinical trials.xv So 
the true contribution of CBE to BC detection in healthy women, and to improved survival in BC 
patients, has come under question, resulting in recent calls to standardize and lower the 
subjectivity  of CBE administration and reporting.xvi 
1.3 Health worker led “earlier detection”   
The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system indicates prognosis 
based on the size of the tumor at detection viz. stage of breast cancer. Identifying tumors a t 
earlier stages (down -staging) can improve survival, assuming high -quality treatment is 
accessible. In the U.S., approximately 40 million women receive mammograms annually and 
roughly 232,000 new cases are identified; vast majority are detected at stage T is and T1 with a  5-
year survival of 100%. In the context of LMICs, where up to two- thirds of breast cancer cases 
present at late stages, systematic down -staging is required, such that majority of the cases would 
be identified at Stage II or earlier, where survival can be 93% or better (again, assuming 
treatment is available).  
In LMICs, health workers, nurses and midwives represent the most affordable resource to 
bridge the accessibility gap due to the lack of secondary prevention programs like in HICs. What  
is needed is a low -cost, user -friendly technology that can be used by [CONTACT_421193]- stage breast cancer to at least Stage II. The low -cost technology must perform 
with better detection sensitivity than CBE (higher than 50%) and equally high specificity as CBE 
(94%) to accurately and effectively identify breast lumps in need of further diagnostic follow -up 
(diagnostic ultrasound, breast bi opsy) without clogging the under -resourced infrastructure with 
false positives due to typi[INVESTIGATOR_421179] (tissue variability, lumpi[INVESTIGATOR_421180]).  
Contrast in elastic stiffness between normal and abnormal breast tissue has long been 
recog nized (Harris '94). Breast cancers are known to be stiffer than normal breast tissues. Major 
medical device manufacturers are exploring different sensing mechanisms like Ultrasound 
Elastography and  MRI , which use tissue stiffness to differentiate between malignant  and non -
malignant tissue .  
1.4 Investigational Device 
 
The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_421181] ( PEF, Fig1 ), invented by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wan 
Shih and [CONTACT_411184] -Heng Shih at Drexel University  is a novel, 
quantitative and low -cost elastic modulus (E) sensor that  can 
measure tissu e compression by [CONTACT_421194]. PEF’s 
ability to apply a force and measure the displacement 
electrically, all within the finger, makes for an ideal 
“electronic palpation ” sensor for in vivo  breast tissue imaging. 
Detection of abnormal breast tiss ues ( e.g., c arcinoma in s itu, 
intra-ductal c arcinoma, l obular c arcinoma, etc.), and benign 
growths ( e.g., fibrocystic lesions, hyperplasia, and 
calcifications) can be achieved by [CONTACT_421195] E scan. The 
size and depth of the abnormal breast tissue can al so be 
calculated using adjacent fingers.   
Figure 1  
5 
 The current PEF S system (Product Name: [CONTACT_421209]™ or iBE™, Fig. 2) 
consists of a hand- held com pression probe  containing a  [ADDRESS_531433] records. iBE has the potential to ‘optimize’ CBE by [CONTACT_421196] I and IIa breast cancers with minimally trained health workers. 
iBE will also ‘standardize’ breast exams by [CONTACT_421197], consistently and with the ability to share the results easily 
using the mobile device app.   
 
   
The device will be stored in [CONTACT_421210]’ office at [ADDRESS_531434] , 20th floor , Philadelphia, PA , 
[ZIP_CODE]. 
 
1.5 Feasibility Testing  
1.5.1  Proof -of-Concept :  
Early testing was performed using tissue models as part of the devel opment of the proof -of-
concept device. This testing included characterization of the device, establishing its ability to 
distinguish smooth and rough surface characteristic s of benign and malignant tumors, and 
determining its depth limit ex vivo  and in  vivo. I  
1.5.2  Ex-Vivo Tissue Testing:  
We conducted testing on [ADDRESS_531435] tissue samples under an IRB -approved protocol and 
compared PEF results with the pathology reports. Of the 71 cases, there were 33 cases of 
invasive cancer  (32 cases of invasive ductal  carcinoma and 1 case of invasive lobular 
carcinoma), 9 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and [ADDRESS_531436] tissues 
regardless of patients’ ages.

 1.6 Clinical Data to Date  
 
In Vivo  Testing : Forty  in vivo  evaluations of the 1x4 PEF -compression probe we re conducted by 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ari Brooks  at his Hahnemann Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l outpatient office under an IRB -approved protocol . 
These evaluations were performed for device development, not clinical utility . The  probe was 
tested with various pushing depth, i.e., at [ADDRESS_531437] of differen t pushing depth on the measured elastic modulus map. The results showed that 
different pushing depths did not alter the tissue elastic map, in terms of the lesion location and 
size. The PEF measurements were compared to patients’ mammography report s. All tests were 
blinded. 
 
A total of [ADDRESS_531438] was 40/46 or 87%. In women 40 
years or younger the overall sensitivity was 19/19 or 100%. In women who had a lesion visible 
on mammography, PEF had a sensitivity of 83% (24/29). Of these, in women aged 40 or 
younger, PEF identified all 7 mammogr aphically visible lesions, including 2 malignant lesions.  
When compared with ultrasound, PEF correctly identified 87% (34/39) in this group. Of these, in 
women aged 40 or younger, PEF identified 100% (19/19) of all ultrasound visible lesions.  
  
UPenn Clini cal Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]  
A total of 44 patients were enrolled in this prospective signal processing/algorithm development 
trial.  Patients presenting to the Pennsylvania Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_421182]’s Imaging Center for breast 
diagnostic services including ultrasound and/ or diag nostic mammogram and/or needle biopsy 
were recruited for an iBE exam prior to biopsy.  The final production prototype device was used 
for all studies.  
 
The demographic result  of the patient population is 59% Caucasian 34% African Americans, 2% 
Asian, and 4.5% unknown with an average age of [ADDRESS_531439] diagnostic services  of the 
44 patients 50% were determined to be BIRADs 2, and the other 50% were BIRADs 3 or 4, zero 
patients were categorized  BIRADs 1 or  5.  17 subjects of underwent a biopsy .  
1.7 Risk/Benefits  
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_421183] (PEF) is a battery powered, electric ally insulated device and poses very 
little risk of electric shock to subjects . The maximu m voltage is 5V and the maximum current is 
[ADDRESS_531440], 
reliable , and commercially viable device for screening individuals  who don’t have access to the 
benefits of mammographic screening.  This device is called  the iBE (see Section 1.2). 
 
The goal of th is research project  is to measure the accuracy of the iBE device for detection of 
clinically relevant findings in the breast.  This study would establish a validated sensitivity and 
specificity for breast lesion detection  using the results of current mammography based breast 
screening . These results are needed in preparation for an international trial of the device in Low -
Middle Income Countries. This research project will have no impact on clinical decision making.  
[ADDRESS_531441] lesions  will 
be performed by [CONTACT_3553] a prospective study.   Subjects may participate during a previously 
scheduled visit to the women’s imagin g center.  All women presenting to the imaging center, 
including screening, diagnostic or interventional procedures, will be eligible for participation. A 
subset of patients will undergo dual examinations by [CONTACT_421198] -rater reliability .  
 
The estimated date for the investigators to complete this study (complete primary analyses) is 
approximately 2 years from study activation .  
3.2 Study Endpoints  
• To determine the sensitivity and specificity of iBE exams for  the detection of 
clinically relevant breast lesions  (defined as BIRADs 3 -5 on imaging, and/or 
malignant on biopsy ). 
• To determine inter -rater reliability in the iBE production  prototype . 
 
[ADDRESS_531442] Selection  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
• 18 years of age and older  
• Women and men with s ymptomatic breast lump (either by [CONTACT_421199])  OR 
• Asymptomatic women  presenting to the imaging center  for a screening 
mammogram.  
• Signed Informed Consent  
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
• Patients  under 18 years of age  
• Patients who previously part icipated in this study  and are returning 
to the Women’s Imaging Center for follow -up diagnostic tests  
[ADDRESS_531443] Recruitment and Screening  
Subjects will be offered participation in the study during their  visit to the Women’s Imaging 
Center by [CONTACT_978] s, [CONTACT_421211] , [CONTACT_421212] , and/or their  designee. This study may  
recruit up to 1000 subjects . Patient’s will be eligible for study participation if they have a 
scheduled visit for the Women’s Imaging Center and have not previously  participated in this 
study.  The reason for the patient’s visit, screening or diagnostic , will not affect their eligibility.  
Diagnostic visits are included as it is necessary to ensure the accuracy of the iBE device’s ability 
to detect BIRADs [ADDRESS_531444] lesions, defined here as BIRADs 3 -5, with the purpose of giving patients proper 
follow -up recommendations  without causing unnecessary anxiety of  avoidable diagnostic tests .   
 
5 Study Procedures  
 
Participants will be recruited from the Women’s Imaging Center  who are scheduled to undergo 
screening or diagnostic imaging including biops ies.  Subjects will have the study explained to 
them and given the consent form  to rev iew early in their imaging ce nter visit. A fter the  subjects 
have had time to review the consent, t he PI  [INVESTIGATOR_421184].  If she/he 
agrees and signs the consent form , they will receive a signed copy to take home with them.   All 
subjects  must  meet  the in clusion and exclusion criteria.  Consent will be obtained prior to any 
study -related activities.   
 
The iBE  evaluation  will be performed by a trained individual  who is blinded to the outcome of 
the radiology studies at the time the iBE is performed.  The trained indivi dual will be a 
healthcare worker with minimum education (or equivalence ) to a licensed practical nurse (LPN) 
or an ultrasound tech.  This is the target education level for the intended iBE operators.  The 
selected healthcare worker will be trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. A ri Brooks, MD to administer the iBE and 
clinical breast exam s.  The trainee will follow [CONTACT_421210] during clinic hours for 1- [ADDRESS_531445] Exam  (CBE)  the 
findings will be documented on the case report form s and the device tablet concurrently.  
 
If the patient is selected to participate in the inter -rater reliability  portion of the study , the subject 
will undergo both the iBE and the clinical breast exams twice performed by [CONTACT_421200].  The trained individuals will 
have their own case report forms and tablets that integrate to the iBE to prevent results sharing 
and bias.  The selection for the inter -rater reliability portion of the study will be decided by [CONTACT_421201].  T he second trained individual will be present one a day week and that day all 
the patients will be asked to participate in the dual exam inter -rater reliability portion of the 
study.   
 
9 
 These data are recorded and processed by [CONTACT_421202] m and the results are 
displayed topographically on a “breast -map” with red areas showing positive findings and green  
areas showing negative findings.  All the recorded data are collected on the tablet without 
HIPAA identifying variables.  The tablet will as sign a four digit subject number incrementally 
increasing for each subject prior to the iBE scan and this number will be recorded on the case 
report form.  Results of the test will be reported to the patient as well as the radiology 
technologist and radiol ogist . The iBE evaluation may add between 10 and 30 minutes to the 
clinic visit.  The iBE evaluation will be done prior to the patient’s original scheduled imaging 
visit. After the completion of the imaging visit the radiologist will evaluate the images an d the 
iBE report.   If there are areas identified on the iBE that are not resolved by [CONTACT_421203] ( if not already scheduled ).   
 
The current pathway of breast lesion detection can be modifie d in this protocol in order to 
ascertain the accuracy of the  iBE device  illustrated in S cheme [ADDRESS_531446] lesion screening and detection begins with a screening mammogram or a diagnostic  
mammogram/ultrasound.  If nothing is dete cted by [CONTACT_421204] a follow -up recommendation is given.  However, i f something suspi[INVESTIGATOR_421185] .  
If the additional ultr asound reveals something suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665]  a biopsy maybe recommended for 
confirmation  or if a benign finding is revealed a follow -up recommendation is  be given .  The 
addition of iBE screening will only modify the current pathway  if the iBE exam returns a 
positiv e result when the initial mammogram provides a negative result .  If this occurs a study 
provided ultrasound will be recommended and the ultrasound’s results will be used to verify the 
iBE positive result .  If the ultrasound invalidates the iBE positive res ult, it will be deemed a false 
positive and the diagnostic tests are complete.  H owever, if the ultrasound confirms the iBE’s 
result  [CONTACT_421210] and the radiologist will discuss if further diagnost ic intervention  (i.e. biopsy) is 
required.   Data on the fin al disposition of the imaging, any biopsies and any follow up imaging 
to 18 months after participation will be recorded in the database.

Quant itative Data  
Quantitative data  from the test will be documented and analyzed for accuracy metrics.   
 
The iBE device collects only compression measurements  and stores these data on the mobile 
device. Compression data are recorded for our records and a copy is available to UELS via 
Dropbox, which is backed up online and offsite.  
 
We know the data are captured accurately because a unique file gets created at the end of every 
scan in a specific folder inside the DELL tablet. The app gives the user a notificatio n that the 
data were saved properly to the tablet at the end of each scan.  
 
The data sent to the UELS database are identical to th ose on the tablet , as they  are synced 
between the folder inside the tablet and Dropbox. This ensures that an exact copy of the  files 
created at the site are sent to UELS. These files use a unique ID entered by [CONTACT_421205].  
 
No identifiable data are collected or stored by [CONTACT_421206].  iBE data are stored at UELS  on 
an encrypted datab ase.  All data that are transmitted are de -identified  and sent directly to the 
database from the device.   Each study performed on the device has a unique number. The unique

6 Statistical Pla n-Paul’s expertise  
6.1 Sample Size Determination  
Based on a study of BIRADS grading  of a mammography regi stry, 80% of all screening 
mammograms are BIRADS 1 and 2. The incidence of malignancy should be 1- 2% of all 
screening mammograms.  The screening center performs [ADDRESS_531448] cancers are diagnosed yearly. Since symptomatic 
individuals scheduled to undergo diagnostic imaging or biopsy are eligible to participate this will 
enrich  the population categorized to BIRADs 3- 5.  Using a  sample size of 1000 subjects provides  
80% power.   
6.2 Statistical Meth ods 
Data will be analyzed using contingency table methods, estimating the sensitivity and specificity 
of the device to correctly assign subjects to BIRADS 1, 2 versus BIRADS 3, 4, 5 categories.  
Sensitivity is calculated  from contingency table counts as TP /(TP+FN), and specificity is 
calculated as TN/(TN+FP), (and will be log transformed) with variances obtained using the delta 
method.  Both sensitivity and specificity measures are expected to be high, given great 
performance in preliminary data (0.95 and 0.92 respectively).  We will use a non- inferiority 
approach, attempting to demonstrate that in the clinical setting, iBE matches our prelimina ry 
values, and we will test them against null hypothesis values (Non inferiority boundaries) that are 
5% below our preliminary data using the z -score for the log -transformed measure.

[ADDRESS_531449] (ADE)  
All adverse events will be graded using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) v4.0. For the purposes of this study, an adverse device event (ADE) will be defined as 
any untoward medical occurrence following exposure to the PEFS device regardless of 
expectedness or attribution.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  (UADE)  
An una nticipated device effect is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, or any life-
threatening problem or death caused by [CONTACT_1282] a device , if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device  that 
relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.   
 
Serious injury  
Any injury that is any one of the following:  
• Life-threatening  
• Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to body 
structure  
• Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body 
function or permanent damage to a body structure  
 
7.2 Recording of A DEs 
All events experi enced by [CONTACT_421207].  The clinical course of each event should be 
followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that study par ticipation is 
not the cause.  Serious ADEs  (SADEs)  that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must 
be followed up to determine the final outcome.  
 
The minimum initial information to be captured in the subject’s source document concerning the 
ADE  includes:  
 
• Study identifier  
• Subject number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  
• CTCAE Grade  • Investigator assessment of the attribution to  
PEFS 
• Investigator assessment of the 
expectedness of the event  
• Current status  
• Whether the event is serious and re ason for 
classification as serious  
13 
 7.2 Reporting of ADEs  and Unanticipated Problems  
 
7.2.1  Investigator reporting: Notifying the IRB  
 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
In alignment with 21 CFR 312, investigators are required to promptly re port unanticipated 
problems, including suspected adverse reactions and adverse reactions, to the IRB. An event is 
considered a “suspected adverse reaction” when there is reasonable possibility that the  
drug/investigational product caused the adverse event. For these reporting purposes, reasonable 
possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the investigational 
device and the event. For University of Pennsylvania IRB reporting, this means an event 
should be considered probably  or definitely related to the research procedures.  
The IRB requires investigators to submit reports within 10 working days (with one exception) of 
events that meet the definition of an unanticipated problem involving risks to subjects or others. 
Exception:  If the adverse event involved a death and indicates that participants or others are at 
increased risk of harm, investigators are required to submit a report to the IRB within 3 days.  
 
7.2.2  Investigator reporting: Notifying the Abramson Cancer Center Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  
On-Site subjects  (this includes any subjects enrolled at other sites on an in -house study)  
1. All grade 3 or higher events (A DE or SA DE) within [ADDRESS_531450] study treatment/intervention are not reportable with the 
following exceptions:  
a) Deaths on in- house gene or cellular  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
b) Deaths on in- house studies utilizing on -campus manufacturing of the study  
agent(s) or components of  the study agent(s)  
c) Deaths on first -in-human studies  
All events meeting the DSMC reporting requirements must be entered into the mandatory Velos 
AE/SAE form.  
Every effort w ill be made to report an event as a diagnosis , not as a list of symptoms. Symptoms 
that led to the diagnosis should be included in the event description, but should not be the actual 
event.  
14 
 7.3 Exceptions and Deviations  
 
Exception  
A one -time intentional a ction or process that departs from the IRB - and CTSRMC -approved 
study protocol, intended for one occurrence. If the action disrupts the stud y progress, such that 
the study design or outcome (endpoints) may be compromised, or the ac tion compromises the 
safety and welfare of study subjects, advance documented IRB and DSMC approval is required.  
 
Deviation  
A one -time, unintentional action or process that departs from the IRB - and CTSRMC- approved 
study protocol, involving one incident and identified retrospectively, after th e event occurred. If 
the impact on the protocol disrupts the study design, may affect the outcome (endpoints) , or 
compromise s the safety and welfare of the subjects, the deviation must be reported to the DSMC  
within [ADDRESS_531451] of the event on safety 
and/or study outcome integrity in a memo to file for each deviation.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_531452] of 1996 (HIPAA). 
Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the  following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for  use of their PHI  
 
Subjects may withdraw permission to use and share their health information at any time and for 
any reason.  Even if subjects withdraw permission, we may still use their information that was 
collected before their request if that informat ion is necessary to the study.  
 
8.2 Maintaining Records  
 
Regulations require investigator s to maintain all data/records for a period of 2 years after the date 
the investigation is completed or terminated or the records are no longer required to support a 
premarket approval ( PMA ), whichever date is later.  Since the dat a/records from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_421186] a PMA for the clinical utility study, data/records for this study will be 
maintained for 2 years  from the clinical utility PMA.  
15 
 8.3 Source  Documents

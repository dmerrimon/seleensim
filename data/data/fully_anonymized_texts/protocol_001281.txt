Safety criteria: Safety assessments include continuous AE monitoring and local tolerability 
assessment, physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, and body 
temperature), TBtest (IGRA ), 12-lead ECG, injection site reaction assessment, and 
laboratory tes ts.
Statistical m ethods: This trial isintended to generate additional information for the comparison of 
BI695501 withEU-approved Humi rainpatient s with active Crohn’s disease .
The statistical model for the analysis of the prim ary endpoint will be a log-linked 
binomial regression model. The model will include the stratification factors (prior 
exposure to infliximab [yes/no] and baseline SES-CD [<16 or ≥16]) and treatment 
as fixed, categorical effects..
For the prim ary and secondary endpoints, point es timates (risk difference for binary 
endpoints) together with their 90% and 95% CIs will be calculated, but will be 
interpreted in a descriptive manner.
The safety population will consist of all patients who receive at least one (full or 
partial) dose of either of the trial treatments during any dosing period. The analysis 
of AEs will be based on the concept of treatment -emergent AEs. That means that all 
AEs with an onset after the first dose of trial medication up to a period of [ADDRESS_801474] dose of the trial medication will be assigned to the current treatment 
for evaluation.

1. INTRODUCTION
MEDICAL BACKGROUND 1.1
Crohn’s disease is a chronic relapsing, remitting inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal 
tract characterized b y abdominal pain, fever, and bloody  or mucus -containing diarrhea
(R13-2231). The disease affects the gastrointestinal tract discontinuously  from mouth to anus, 
but most comm only the ileum and colon (40%), followed by  [CONTACT_605278]  (30%), and 
the colon only  (25%) ( R13-2232, R13 -2233). It occurs in a relatively  young population, most 
commonly  developi[INVESTIGATOR_605261] 20 and 29, and there is no marked sex 
difference (R13-2231, R15 -0886). Although the etiology  of CD is still unknown, it is widely  
accepted that it is caused by a combination of environmental, immune ,and bacterial factors 
in genetically  susceptible individuals ( R16-1919, R16-1918, R16 -1917 ).
The incidence of CD in Europe and North America is approximately  161 to 319 cases per 
100,000 people ( R13-2231 )and is less common in Asia and Africa ( R16-1920 , R16 -
1923). 
Historically , CD has been more common in the developed world (R16-1922 );however, rates 
have been increasing, particularly  in the developi[INVESTIGATOR_19744] ,since the mid -1970s ( R16-1923, 
R16-1922).
Because of m yriad symptoms, clinical status is measured using clinical indexes. The most 
widely  used in clinical trials is the CDAI  (R97-2689 ). At the mucosal level, the extent of 
disease can be graded following ileocolonoscop y according to the SES-CD(R14-2969,
R15-6247).
Current treatment options
Medical treatment for CD has two main goals: achieving remission and, once that is 
accomplished, maintaining remission (prevention of flare s). Treatment is ,thus, aimed at 
controlling the ongoing inflammation in the intestine, the cause of IBD symptoms.
Medical t herap y used in clinical practice includes 5-ASA and antibiotics (for colonic 
disease), corticosteroids, immunosuppressant drugs, and biologic agents . The latter is the 
newest class of drugs to be used in IBD and include sthree of the available anti –TNF -alpha
agents (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol) ,as well as vedolizumab (Enty vio®) and 
natalizumab (Ty sabri®).Biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_22728] a distinct advantage in the treatment of IBD 
since their mechanism of action is targeted. Unlike corticosteroids,
which tend to suppress the 
entire immune sy stem and thereby  [CONTACT_605279], biologic agents act more 
selectivel y. However, immunosuppression -related side effects ,such as an enhanced incidence 
of infections ,are also described for biologic agents.
Nutritional support also has a role as primary  therapy  or as adjunct to other treatment. When 
medical treatment is unsuccessful or with certain complications, surgery  is indicated. More 
than 70% of patients with ile al disease will require surgery  at least once durin g the course of 
their disease. Due to therapeutic failures and serious side effects of present therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
alternatives continue to be needed.

DRUG PROFILE 1.2
BI695501 is a monoclonal antibody being developed as a proposed biosimilar to the 
TNF -alpha blocker, adalimumab (US- licensed Humira and EU -approved Humira). 
Adalimumab is a recombinant human ized monoclonal IgG1 antibod y specific to human 
TNF -alpha. It has human -derived heav y and light chain variable regi ons a nd human 
IgG1: kappa constant regions and is produced in a mammalian cellexpression sy stem 
(R15-5978, R15 -4915
).
For a more detaile d description of the BI 695501 profile , please refer to the current IB ,and 
for Humira ,to the SmPC or US Prescribing Information .
Humira binds specifically  to TNF -alpha ( nottoTNF -beta) and blocks its interaction with the 
p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Humira has also been shown to l yse cells expressing 
surface TNF in vitro in the presence of complement and modulate biological responses that 
are induced or regulated by  [CONTACT_51004], including changes in adhesion molecules responsible for 
leukocy te migration (endothelia l leukocy te adhesion molecule -1, vascular cell adhesion 
molecule -1, and intercellular adhesion molecule -1) (R15-5978
).
In contrast to rheumatological indications, where binding and neutralization of s oluble TNF 
is the prominent feature of adalimumab’s phar macody namic activity , clinical efficacy  in IBD
requires additional effects attributable to interaction of adalimumab with tmTNF, 
subsequently  leading to reverse signaling (T cell apoptosis, inhibition of cytokine release 
from macrophages) and induction of complement dependent c ytotoxicity /
antibody -dependent cell -mediated c ytotoxicity .The contribution of each of these effects is
still a matter of scientific debate.
Humira (adalimumab) has received regulatory  approval for CD in the US, the EU, and many  
other countries ( R15-5978 , R15 -4915).
Humira has a generally  favorable clinical safety  profile, and is not associated with AEs that 
would suggest a high risk to patients participating in this trial. I n patients treated with 
Humira, most common adverse reactio ns (incidence >10%) include infections (e.g., upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , sinusitis), injection site reactions, headache ,and rash, abdominal pain, 
musculoskeletal pain, nausea,
and vomiting. Allergic reactions (e.g., allergic rash, 
anaph ylactoid reaction, fixed dr ug reaction, non-specified drug reaction, urticaria) have been 
observed in approximately 1% of patients.
Cases of hepatitis B virus reactivation have been reported in patients receiving anti -TNF 
therap y. Some cases have been fatal, the majorit y of which we re in patients concomitantly  
receiving other immunosuppressive medications.
Tuberculosis reactivation or new TB infections have been observed in patients receiving 
Humira and other TNF -inhibitors, including patients who had previousl y received treatment 
for latent or active TB.

other malignancies included breast, colon, prostate, lung, and melanoma.
Humira was evaluated in over 1500 adult patients with modera tely to severely active CD 
(CDAI ≥220 and ≤450) in trials that were performed prior to approval , with some patients 
followed for at least 3 years of open -label adalimumab . In the European Medicines Agency
SmPC, 
three randomized, double -blind, placebo -contr olled studies were reported for Humira , 
which assessed the efficacy  and safet y of Humira for the treatment of CD(R15-4915).
The anal ytical similarit y between BI 695501 and US -licensed Humira was assessed in a 
single -dose PK study  in the cy nomolgus monkey  and a local tolerance study  in rabbits. 
Additionally , the PK similarity  between BI 695501, US -licensed Humira and EU -approved 
Humira was assessed in a Phase I clinical trial ( 1297.8 )in healt hy volunteers. The results of 
these studies are provided in the IB.
The PK similarity  of BI 695501 to US -licensed Humira and EU -approved Humira was 
demonstrated in a healthy volunteer study  (c03070713 ). Single s.c. doses of [ADDRESS_801487] s for BI 695501 and both EU- approved Humira and
US-licensed H umira were in line with the known safet y profile presented in the US 
prescribing information for Humira ( R15-5978) and in the SmPC for EU -approved Humira 
(R15-4915 ).
A Phase III trial(1297.2) in patients with moderate to severe RAis ongoing . A total of 
645patients with moderate to severe RA were included in this blinded trial and are being 
treated with either BI 695501 or US -licensed Humira , monitored by  [CONTACT_41774].

ASSESSMENT
RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL 2.1
The CD trial1297.4 is intended to generate comparative PK, efficacy , safety ,and 
immunogenicit y data in an indication where these modes of adalimumab’s action are 
important. The aim is to explore similarity  of sTNF and tmTNF -related effects, initially  
established by  [CONTACT_605280], and has allowed extrapolation across indications.

Although rare, a potential for DILI is under constant surveillance by  [CONTACT_3211] s and regulators. 
Therefore, this trial requires timely  detection, evaluation, and follow -up 
of laboratory
alterations inselected liver laboratory  parameters to ensure patients´ safet y, see also 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].
All safety aspects will be r egularl y monitored b y bot h the sponsor and a CRO during the 
Medical Qualit y Review Meetings .
To avoid a risk of reactivating TB and other infections, TB tests (IGRA), HBsAg
(qualitative), hepatitis B antibody  (qualitative), hepatitis C antibodies (qualitative), HIV-1 
and HIV -2 antibody  (qualitative) will be performed to exc lude patients testing positive.
In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-inhibitors, including Humira, more 
cases of malignancies have been observed among TNF -inhibitor -treated adult patients 
compared to control -treated adult patients. Therefore, a possibl y increased risk for the 
development of malignancies cannot be excluded.
The PK similarity  of BI 695501 to US -licensed and EU -approved Humira was established in 
the P hase I trial 1297.8 ( c03070713). Additionally , there were no notable differences with 
respect to safet y, tolerability ,and immunogenicity between BI [ADDRESS_801490] to clinical laboratory  
evaluation, vital signs, ECGs, or injection site reactions (including anaph ylactic or allergic 
reactions) . Based on extensive preclinical, anal ytical, functional, and toxicological testing 
carried out prior to initiation of this trial, and the Phase I data described above, BI 695501, as 
a proposed biosimilar to H umira, is expected to show a similar efficacy , safety , 
immunogenicit y
,and PK profile in patients with CD .

3. DESCRIPTION OF DESIG N AND TRIAL POPULATI ON
OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN 3.1
This is a n exploratory ,randomized, 56-week, double -blind, parallel arm, multiple dose, 
active comparator trial of BI 695501 and EU-approved Humira , with a 48- week treatment 
period and a 10 -week follow -up period (starting after last dose of trial medication at Week
46)in patients with moderate lyto severe lyactive CD,and a primary  endpoint assessment at 
Week 4.
The trial will consist of a Screening period of up to a maximum of 28 day s, a 48-week 
treatment period consisting of an induction period from Baseline to Week 4and a 
maintenance period from Week 5to Week 48, and a 10-week safety  follow -up period
(starting after last dose of trial medication at Week 46)
.
Approximately  130 evaluable patients with moderately  to severely  active CD will be 
randomized into the trial. Patients will be randomly  assigned to receive either BI 695501 or 
EU-approved Humira according to the randomization ratio and the stratification factors as 
described in Section 7.6. Each patient will receive a loading dose of 160 mg of BI 695501 or 
EU-approved Humira (Day  1), followed by  80 mg of BI 695501 or EU-approved Humira
2weeks later (Day  15), and thereafter 40 mg of BI 695501 or EU -approved Humira every  
2week suntil the en d of the treatment period (Week 46; with End of Treatment [EoT] 
evaluations at Week 48 ). Trial medication will be administered by  s.c. injection.
AtWeek 
4, patients will be assessed and those who are classified as responders ( CDAI 
decrease of ≥ 70 compared to baseline ) will continue on trial and enter the maintenance phase. 
Patients who are originally  randomized to EU -approved Humira will switch toBI695501 at 
Week 24 .
Patients will undergo up to 27 visits (including 13trial medication administration only visits) 
over the duration of the trial ( 56weeks). The trial procedures to be undertaken at each visit 
are shown in Flow Chart Aand Flow Chart B .
The primary  endpoint of the trial is the proportion of patients in each treatment group with a 
clinical response (CDAI decrease of ≥70 compared to baseline) at W eek 4. The primary  
analysis will take place when the last patient has completed the Week [ADDRESS_801491] an EoT visit (see Flow 
Chart Aand Flow Chart B ). Every  effort should be made for all patients who complete the 
total [ADDRESS_801492] dose of trial medication.
Patients may  return for unscheduled visits should their medical condition warrant urgent 
attention at the discretion of the investigator.
An overview of the trial design is shown in Figure 3.1: 1.

DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING TH E CHOICE OF 3.2
CONTROL GROUP(S)
The current trial is being performed to compare the clinical efficacy  of BI695501 with 
EU-approved Humira in patient s with moderate lyto severe lyactive CD.Additionally , the 
safet y of BI 695501 will be assessed during long -term treatment and after switching from 
EU-approved Humira.
This is a n exploratory , randomized, 56-week, double- blind, parallel arm, multiple dose, 
active comparator trial of BI 695501 and EU-approved Humira, with a 48-week treatment 
period and a 10-week follow- up period (starting from Week 46) ,in patients with moderate ly
to severe lyactive CD.
Patien ts will be randomized according to a 1:1 ratio to either BI 695501 orEU-
approved 
Humira in a blinded fashion. A tWeek 4, patients will be assessed and those who are 
classified as responders ,by [CONTACT_139801] a decrease in CDAI  ≥70, will continue the trial and
enter the maintenance phase.
SELECTION OF TRIAL P OPULATION 3.3
In view of the TNF -blocking mechanism of adalimumab, care has been taken to exclude 
patients likely  to be at greater risk of severe infection, severe immunosuppression or severe 
heart failure (see Section 3.3.3 ).
A log of all patients enrolled into the trial(i.e.,who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the I SF at the investigational site irrespective of whether they  have been treated 
with investigational drug or not.

3.3.4 Removal of patients from therapy or assessments
Removal of individual patients [IP_ADDRESS]
An excessive withdrawal rate from the trial can have a severe negative impact on the 
scientific value of the trial. Every  effort should be made to keep patients in the trial as 
scheduled. This includes careful patient selection and appropriate explanation of the trial 
requirements and procedures prior to enrolment as well as an explanation of the 
consequences of premature withdrawal .
Patients who do not meet all of the inclusion criteria or who meet one or more of the 
exclusion criteria will not be randomized, will be considered screen failures. The primary  
reason for the scr een failure will be recorded on the eCRF .Patients may  be rescreened if the 
investigator considers that the reason for screen failure may  be resolved after a suitable 
period.
Patients have the right to withdraw from this trial at any  time for any  reason.

Two situations can occur in this trial and need to be documented accordingly:
a) An individual patient is to be withdrawn from the trial if:
The patient decides to discontinue participation in the trial by  [CONTACT_28475]. In 
this case, no more invest igations will be performed. The patient does not have to justify  
the decision.
b) Based on assessment b y the investigator, an individual patient is to be discontinued 
from treatment with the investigational compound if :
Lack of efficacy : absence of a clini cal response at Week 4, defined as a decrease in CDAI 
of ≥70.
The patient needs to take concomitant drugs that interfere with the investigational product 
or other trialmedication .
Development of a toxicity or AEwhich warrants treatment discontinuation including ,but 
not limited to ,SAEs or S[LOCATION_003]Rs .
The patient can no longer be treated with trial medication for other medical reasons ( such 
assurgery , AEs, other diseases, or pregnancy ).
The patient has an AE that is categorized as a serious infection (infe ctions requiring i.v.
antibiotics or meeting the regulatory  definition of a nSAE [including, but not limited to 
systemic fungal infections, HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C]).
The patient has repeatedly  shown to be non -compliant with important trial procedure s 
and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15566], the investigator and sponsor representative , is not willing or 
able to stick to the trial requirements in the future.
If a patient permanentl y discontinues from trial medication for an y reason, every effort 
should be made for the patient to attend the E oT Visit as soon after trial discontinuation as 
possible. For patients who discontinue the trial medication earl y (and do not withdraw 
consent), every  effort should be made to follow the patient s for efficacy  assessments Week 
48, wherever possible. In addition, every  effort should be made for all patients who complete 
the total [ADDRESS_801503] dose of trial medication.
Given the patient’s agreement, the patient will undergo the procedures for earl y treatment 
discontinuation and follow-up as outlined in Flow Chart A or Flow Chart B , as appropriate,
and Section 6.2.3 .
For all patients the reason for withdrawal (e.g.,AEs) must be recorded in the eCRF . These 
data will be included in t he trial database and reported.

assessment. At Week 24, p atients originall y randomized to EU- approved Humira will switch 
to receive 40 mg BI 6 [ZIP_CODE] every  2 weeks . All patients will then continue to receive BI 
695501 at the same dose until Week 46.
Patients not achieving a clinical response at W eek 4will not receive an yfurther treat ment
with trialmedicat ion, but will be followed up for safet yafter 10 weeks (Safety  Follow -up 
Visit) .
Prefilled sy ringes will be used for the administration (see Section 4.1.1 )and all patients will 
receive their injections at the trial site througho ut the trial until Week 22 , and 
BI695501/ EU-approved Humira will be administered b y a dedicated, unblinded member of 
trial personnel (third party  blind ing). From Week [ADDRESS_801507] injection in the induction period (Visit 2) and the injection at Visit 1 4(when 
patients originall y randomized to EU- approved Humira will switch to receive BI 695501) , 
patient s
will remain at the clinical site for at least 1 hour for observ ation of any  AEs.
Dose modification is not permitted during this trial. If a patient misses a dose of trial 
medication then the dose should be administered as soon as possible , in accordance with the 
visit schedule presented in Flow Chart A and Flow Chart B . 
In the event of an anaph ylactic or other serious allergic reaction, the administration of trial 
medication will be discontinued immediately and appropriate therap y instituted .Every  effort 
should be made to ensure that patients who discontinue trial medication are followed up as 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
4.1.5 Blinding and procedures for unblinding
Blinding [IP_ADDRESS]
This is a double -blind trial, therefore pati ents, investigator s,and every one involved in trial 
conduct (except the trial personnel administering the trial medication –third party  blinding) 
will remain blinded with regard to the randomized treatment assignments until after database 
lock. The unbli nded trial personnel receiving, handling, and administering the trial 
medication will not be involved in any  other trial assessments or procedures.
Details of blinding procedures are described in Appendix 10.1 , Medication Blinding 
Procedures.
The randomization code will be kept secret by  [CONTACT_410259].
The secondary  packaging (boxes containing PFS) will be identical for both BI [ADDRESS_801508] 22 weeks of

treatment .Thereafter, all patients will receive BI 695501 and the drug supplies will not 
require blinding via secondary  packaging.
The data will be unblinded at the time point of the primary  anal ysis (see Section 7.4.1 ), only  
for individuals involved in the primary  analy sis and reporting.
Access to the randomization code will be controlled and documented. All persons directl y 
involved in the conduct of the trial will have no access to the treatment a llocation prior to 
final database lock.
Unblinding and breaking the code [IP_ADDRESS]
Emergency  unblinding will be available to the investigator / Pharmacist / investigational drug 
storage manager via IRT. It must only  be used in an emergency  situation when the identit y of 
the trial drug must be known to the investigator in order to provide appropriate medical 
treatment or otherwise assure safety  of trial participants . If unblinding is required in the 
interest of the safet y of a patient, and time allows, the investigato r will discuss the matter 
with the Medical Advisor before unblinding whenever possible. If the code is broken for a 
patient (via the IRT) the sponsor must be informed immediately . The reason for unblinding 
must be documented in the patient’s source documen ts and the appropriate eCRF along with 
the date and the initials of the person who broke the code.
The process for breaking the blind will be handled through the IRT. Instructions for this will 
be described in the IRT user manual that will be provided to each site.
Due to the requirements to report S[LOCATION_003]Rs , it may be necessary  for a representative from the 
Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmacovigilance group to access the randomization code for 
individual patients during trial conduct. The access to the code will only  be given to 
authorized P harmacovigilance representatives and will not be shared further.

ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 5.2
The assessments described in the following sections will be made at the time points indicated 
in Flow C hartAand Flow Chart B .
5.2.1 C DAI
Evaluation of CDAI will be performed by [CONTACT_605287] A and Flow Chart B .
The CDAI is a validated instrument to measure disease severit y in CD ( R97-2689 ). It is the 
most widely  used clinical index for the evaluation of disease activity  and remission in 
inflammatory  CD in clinical trials . It has been recommended by  [CONTACT_605288]’s and Colitis Organization for

defining CDactivity  (R02-0112 , R15-4343 ) and has been accepted by  [CONTACT_605289] ( R13-2623 ).
The CDAI score is composed of eight factors as shown in Table 5.2.1: 1 .The patient is 
required to keep a s ymptom diary  for 4of these 8 variables (number of liquid stools, 
abdominal pain, general well- being ,and use of antidiarrheal drugs) for 7 consecutive days 
before each CDAI eval uation. Hematocrit results are integral to the CDAI calculation and 
will be assessed at each visit by  [CONTACT_605290] 
(see Section 5.3.3 ). The Visit 1 hematocrit results will be us ed for the calculation of CDAI at 
Visit 1.1 in order to determine eligibility of the patient to be included in the trial. At Week 4, 
the hematocrit value required to determine CDAI score will be assessed locally  and 
confirmed via central laboratory  assessm ent. At Visit 8 (Week 12), the hematocrit value from 
the central laboratory  assessment at Visit 6 (Week 8) will be used to determine CDAI score.
At visits where CDAI evaluation is performed and no phy sical examination is planned, body  
weight must be measur ed for use in CDAI determination.
TheCDAI score is a sum of the eight factors after adjustment with a weighting factor; CDAI 
scores range from 0 to approximately  600. The day  of bowel preparation for colonoscopy  and 
the day  of colonoscop y will be excluded from the CDAI assessment. This is to prevent 
misleading influences (pain and liquid stool frequency ) on CDAI evaluation.

The results for SES-CD and mucosal ulceration will be returned to the trial sitefrom the 
central imaging laboratory for entry  into the appropriate eCRF.
SES-CD [IP_ADDRESS]
The SES-CD was developed as a reproducible measure that could be used to assess response 
to therap y in CD ( R14- 2969 ,R15-6247 ) using an endoscopic index capable of assessing the 
severit y of mucosal lesions in colonic or ileocolonic CD. The scoring s ystem is repre sented in

ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 5.3
5.3.1 Physical examination
A phy sical examination will be performed at the visits indicated in Flow Chart A and 
Flow Chart B .
Whenever possible, the same person should perform the phy sical examination throughout the 
trial (i.e., for all patients at each trial site). The physical examination will include assessment 
of general appearance, skin, head, neck, throat, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, and 
neurological s ystems, thyroid gland, musculoskeletal sy stem/limbs, respi[INVESTIGATOR_53121] ,and 
abdomen. Clinically  relevant abnormal findings will be reported as baseline conditions or 
AEs.
Body weight will also be meas ured. Height will be measured at Screening only.
5.3.[ADDRESS_801516] 
while the patient is in a sitting position. The patient’s body  temperature will also be recorded.
The investigator must assess all vital signs findings at each visit. If the investigator finds an y 
clinically  relevant abnormalities, these must be reported as AEs/SAEs as appropriate (see 
Section 5.3.6 ).
5.3.[ADDRESS_801517] assess all laboratory  results. The investigator will evaluate any  change 
in laboratory  values and all clinical laboratory  tests will be reviewed for potential clinical 
significance at all time points throughout the trial. The investigator should endeavor to 
provide a reason for all results deemed not clinically  significant. If the investigator

determines a laboratory  abnormality  to be clinically  significant, it will be considered an 
AE/SAE (see Section 5.3.6 ); however, if the laboratory  value abnormality  is consistent with a 
current diagnosis, it will be documented accordingl y.
Blood and stool samples will be anal yzed by a central laboratory . The central laboratory  
vendo r will also provide the materials for blood sampling. Instructions for the labeling, 
storage ,and shipment of the samples can be found in the L aboratory  Manual. Details of all 
blood variable units , reference ranges , and blood sample volumes can be found in the 
Laboratory  Manual.
At Week 4, in order to assess clinical response during the visit, the hematocrit value required 
to determine CDAI score will be assessed locall y and subs equently confirmed via central 
laboratory  assessment.
Pregnancy  testing will be performed by  a central laboratory  using serum at Screening or by a 
local laboratory  using urine at al l applicable visits thereafter.
It should also be noted that additional samples may be required if medically indicated, e.g., at 
unscheduled vi sits to follow safet y findings.
5.3.4 Electrocardiogram
A 12 -lead ECG (I, II, III, aVR, aVL , aVF , V1 –V6) will be recorded using a computerized 
electrocardiograph at the visits indicated in Flow Chart A and Flow Chart B .
All ECGs will be recorded for [ADDRESS_801518] s precede all other trial procedures 
at the same time point (except blood drawing from an i.v.cannula which is alread y in place) 
to avoid impact of sampling on the ECG quality .
The electronic version of the ECG is regarded as source data. Dated and signed printouts will 
be stored in the patient’s medical file.
The investigator or a designate will evaluate whether the ECG is normal or abnormal and 
whether it is clinically  significant, if abnormal. Additionally , any  occurrence of re -or 
depolarization disorders, arrh ythmic disorders or other abnormalities will be assessed. ECGs 
may be repeated for quality  reasons (like alternating current artefacts, muscle movements, 
electrode dislocation) and the repeated ECG will be used for anal ysis. Additional 
(unscheduled) ECGs may  be collected by  [CONTACT_405748] y reasons.
Abnormal findings will be reported as AEs (during the trial) or baseline conditions (at 
Screening ) if judged clinically  relevant by  [CONTACT_093]. Any  ECG abnormalities, judged 
as clinically  relevant, will be monitored carefull y and, if necessa ry, the patient will be 
removed from the trial and will receive the appropriate medical treatment. Additionally , 
evaluation of these ECGs will be performed b y a board certified cardiologist.
Information about the details of ECG collection and the parameter s assessed will be provided 
in the I SF.

5.3.5 O ther safety parameters
Tuberculosis assessment [IP_ADDRESS]
A chest X -ray will be reviewed by  [CONTACT_605291]. If chest 
radiographs have been taken within [ADDRESS_801519] 
radiographs do not need to be repeated (as long as they  show no clinically  significant 
abnormality  and no signs or sy mptoms suggestive of lung disease that would exclude the 
patient from the trial). T he results must be entered into the eCRF.
AnIGRA (e.g., QuantiFERON®-TB Gold ) will be used to assess TB status at Screening and, 
for patients who continue to the maintenance phase, at Visit 14 W eek 24 (before s witch from 
EU-approved Humira to BI [ZIP_CODE] and at EoT ( Week 48 or earlier for patients who 
discontinue d treatment during the maintenance phase )
.In the event of an indeterminate result 
at Screening, the test should be repeated. If a second indeterminate result is obtained then the 
patient must be excluded from the trial participation .
In the event of an i ndeterminate or positive result during the stud y, the test should be repeated 
and if a result is positive ,then the patient will discontinue receiving the study  treatment and 
followed up for safet y. The patient will be referred to the specialist as required by  [CONTACT_13125].
5.3.6 Assessment of adverse events
Definitions of AEs [IP_ADDRESS]
Adverse event
An AE is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessaril y have to have a 
causal re lationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not con sidered re lated to the medicinal product.
Adverse reaction
An adverse reaction is defined as a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and 
unintended. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal 
product and an AEis at least a reasonable possibility . Adverse reactions may  arise from use 
of the product within or outside the terms of the marketing authorization or from occupational 
exposure. Conditions of use outside the marketing authorization include off -label use,
overdose, misus e, abuse ,and medication errors.
Serious adverse event
Boehringer Ingelheim 12Dec2017
BI Trial No.: 1297.4
c09542349 -05 Trial Protocol Page 48of 93
Proprietary confidential information © 2017 Boehringer I ngelheim I nternational GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
AnSAE is defined as any AE which:
results in death,
is life -threatening, refer ringto an event in which the patient is at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might cause death if 
more severe,
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] 
prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ,
results in persistent or signif icant disability  or incapacity ,or
is a c ongenital anomal y /birth defect,
or
is deemed serious for an y other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
upon appropriate medical judgment which may  jeopardize the patient and may  require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
above definitions .
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether other situations 
should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be 
immediately  life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_605266]. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias ,or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ,
or development of dependency  or abuse. An y suspected transmission via a medicinal product 
of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction.
AEs considered “Always Serious”
Cancers o f new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be reported as a serious 
event regardless of the duration between discontinuation of the drug and the occurrence of the 
cancer .
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Importa nt Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of further AEs, which by  [CONTACT_15623], can alway s be 
considered to be “serious” even though they  may  not have met the crite ria of an SAE as given 
above.
The latest list of “Always Serious AEs” will be provided in the I SF. These events should 
alway s be reported as SAEs as described above .
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)
The term AESI relates to any  specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being 
of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, 
e.g.,the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. 
AESI sneed to be reported to the sponsor ’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same 
timeframe that applies to SAE s (see above ).
Boehringer Ingelheim 12Dec2017

c09542349 -05 Trial Protocol Page 49of 93
Proprietary confidential information © 2017 Boehringer I ngelheim I nternational GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
The following are considered as AESIs:
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury  is defined by  [CONTACT_15624]:
an elevation of AST and/or ALT ≥[ADDRESS_801520] combined with an elevation of total 
bilirubin ≥2 fold UL N measured in the same blood draw sample, and/or
marked peak aminotransferase (ALT and/or AST) elevations ≥[ADDRESS_801521]
These lab oratory findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these 
laboratory abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” 
provided in the I SF.
In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalo pathy , 
unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab oratory
results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these 
parameters are analy zed, if necessary  in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results 
meet the criteria of hepatic injury  alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist 
should be followed .
For further details see Appendix 10.4 .
Anaph ylactic reactions
Serious infection (defined as infections requiring i.v. antibiotics or meeting the regulatory  
definition of an SAE)
Hypersensitivity  reactions .
Protocol -specified AESIs can be classified as serious or non- serious but all AESI s must be 
reported in an expedited manner similar t o SAEs on an SAE form (i.e. ,non-serious AESIs 
must be reported on the SAE form and follow SAE reporting timelines).
Intensity of AEs
The intensity  of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) that is/are eas ily tolerated
Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usual activities
Causal relationship of AEs
The definition of an adverse reaction implies at least a reaso nable possibility  of a causal 
relationship between a suspected medicinal product and an AE. An adverse reaction, in 
contrast to an AE, is characterized by [CONTACT_49392] a causal relationship between a medicinal 
product and an occurrence is suspected.

BI Trial No.: 1297.4
c09542349 -05 Trial Protocol Page 50of 93
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_801522] that there is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be :
The event is consistent with the known pharmacology  of the drug
The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class
A plausible time to onset of the event relati ve to the time of drug exposure
Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced
No medicall y sound alternative etiologies that could explain the event (e.g. ,pre-existing
or concomita nt diseases, or co -medications)
The event is t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not exposed 
to drugs (e.g. ,Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome)
An indication of dose- response (i.e. ,greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is diminished).
Arguments that may  suggest that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g.,pre-treatment cases, diagn osis of cancer or chronic disease within days/weeks of 
drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
concerned)
Continuation of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_15576], taking into account 
the pharmacological properties of the com pound (e.g. ,after 5 half -lives) .
Of note, this 
criterion may  not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged despit e 
removing the original trigger .
Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanat ion (e.g. ,
situations where other drugs or underl ying diseases appear to provide a more likely  
explanation for the observed event than the drug conc erned)
Disappearance of the event even though the trialdrug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.
Adverse event collection and reporting [IP_ADDRESS]
AE Collection
The investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in their patient files.
Boehringer Ingelheim 12Dec2017
BI Trial No.: 1297.4
c09542349 -05 Trial Protocol Page 51of 93
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_801523] be collected and documented on the appropriate eCRF(s) by  [CONTACT_1275] :
From signing th e informed consent onwards through the REP (defined as [ADDRESS_801524] administration of trial medication ), until the individual patient’s end of trial:
- A ll AEs (serious and non -serious) and all AESI s
However, if an individual patient discontinues trial medication prematurel y but stay s in 
the trial (i.e.,iffurther visits incl. telephone visits , or vital status assessments are planned )
from then on and until the individual patient’s end of the trial ,the investigator must report 
related SAEs and related AESI s.
After the individual patient’s end of trial:
- T he investigator does not need to activel y monitor the patient for AEs but should 
only report relevant SAEs and relevant AESIs of which the investigator may 
become aware .
The above instructions are summarized schematically  below.
The REP is defined as [ADDRESS_801525] trial medication application. All AEs which 
occurred through the treatment phase and throughout the REP will be considered as on 
treatment (see Section 7.3.4 )
. Events which occurred after the REP will be considered as 
post-treatment events.
AE reporting to sponsor and timelines
The investigator must report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI S AE form via fax immediately  (within 24 hours ) t o the 
sponsor’s /sponsor’s designee’s unique entry  point (specific contact [CONTACT_36136]). The same timeline applies if follow- up information becomes available. In specific 
occasions the investigator could inform the sponsor /sponsor’s designee upfront via telephone. 
This does not replace the requirement to complete and fax the BI SAE form.

c09542349 -05 Trial Protocol Page 52of 93
Proprietary confidential information © 2017 Boehringer I ngelheim I nternational GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow -up information the same rules and timeline apply  as for initial 
information.
Information required
For each AE, the investigator should provide the information requested on the appropriate 
eCRF pages and the BI SAE form. The investigator should determine the causal relationship 
to the trial medication and any possible interactions between the investigational drug(s) and a 
non-i nvestigational medicinal product/auxiliary  medicinal product.
The following should also be recorded as an (S)AE i n the eCRF and SAE form (if 
applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination ,and laboratory  test results, if they  are 
judged clinically  relevant by  [CONTACT_093].
Ifsuch abnormalities already  pre-exist prior trial inclusion they  will be considered as baseline 
conditions .
All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient’s end of trial must be followed 
up until they  have resolved, have been sufficiently  characterized , or no further information 
can be obtained.
Pregnancy
In rare case s pregnancy  mayoccur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled into
this clinical trial and has taken trial medication, the investigator must report immediately  
(within 24 hours) a potential drug exposure during pregnancy (DEDP )to the 
sponsor ’s/sponsor’s designee’s unique entry  point (specific contact [CONTACT_36136]). The Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A) should be used.
The outcome of the pregnancy  associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy  must be 
followed up and reported to the s ponsor’s /sponsor’s designee’s unique entry  point on the 
Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part B).
The I SF will contain the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and B).
As pregnancy  itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompany ing SAE 
and/or AESI, onl y the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials and not t he SAE form 
is to be completed. If there is an SAE and/or AESI associated with the pregnancy  an SAE 
form must be completed in addition.

7. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF
SAMPLE SIZE
STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL 7.1
This is a randomized, double -blind, parallel arm, multiple dose, multicenter, multinational,
active comparator trial of BI 695501 and EU -approved Humira.
The primary  objective of this trial is to compare the clinical efficacy  ofBI695501 with
EU-approved Humira in patients with active CD at the end of the induction phase at Week 4 
by [CONTACT_605298] .
The primary  endpoint ( Section 5.1.1 ) will be analy zed using a log-linked binomial model , 
which will include stratification factors as covariates (i.e., prior exposure to infliximab 
[yes/no] and screening SES-CD (<16 or ≥16).
NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES 7.[ADDRESS_801530] a distorting influence on the assessment of the primary  endpoi nt. 
Important protocol violations may include:
Incorrect trial medication taken until Week 4
Violation of treatment compliance until Week 4
V
iolation of inclusion/exclusion criteria
Further details on the definition of the different analy sis sets will be provided in the 
TSAP.
All patients treated with at least one (full or partial) dose of either of the trialtreatments 
during an y dosing period will be included in the safet y evaluation (SAF).
7.3.1 Primary endpoint analyses
Primary  efficacy  analysis:
Boehringer Ingelheim 12Dec2017
BI Trial No.: 1297.4
c09542349 -05 Trial Protocol Page 63of 93
Proprietary confidential information © 2017 Boehringer I ngelheim I nternational GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
The primary analyses will be performed on the FAS. Patients will be assigned to the 
treatment they  were randomized to receive.
The primary  anal ysis of the observed proportion of patients with a clinical response (CDAI 
decrease of ≥70 compared with baseline) at Week 4 will be based on log -linked binomial 
model. No missing data imputation for primary  analy sis endpoint need to be taken into 
account due to FAS definition. However, for pre -specified criteria non -responder imputation 
(NRI) will be applied (see Section 7.5 ).
The statistical model can be described as follows:
(M1) Response to treatment at Week 4 = treatment + prior infliximab exposure + 
screening SES -CD
This model includes the stratification factor, prior exposure t o infliximab, and treatment as 
fixed, categorical effects and it will be investigated whether the baseline SES- CD will be 
included as a continuous or as a categorical effect :
Treatment (BI 695501 ,EU-approved Humira)
Prior exposure to infliximab (Yes/No)
Baseline SES-CD ( <16 or ≥16)
The relative risk estimate together with its 90% and 95% CI(ratio scale) will be produced.
Further efficacy analyses:
As sensitivity  anal yses to the primary  analy sis, the primary  endpoint will also be anal yzed on 
the PPS with NRI.
The following explorative hypotheses are not intended to support any  biosimilarity  claim for 
BI 695501; however, the framework of non -inferiority  testing will be used to compare 
efficacy  of BI [ADDRESS_801531] .
Thefollowing hypotheses will be investigated :
H0:RRof proportion of patients with a clinical response (CDAI decrease of ≥70 
compared with baseline) at Week 4 (BI 695501 versus EU -approved Humira) is less than 
or equal to 0.76
H1:RRof proportion of patien tswith a clinical response (CDAI decrease of ≥70 
compared with baseline) at Week 4 (BI 695501 versus EU -approved Humira) is greater 
than 0.76
Two-sided 90% CI will be used for the comparison .

The applied margin (0.76 on the ratio scale for CDAI 70) does preserve 39% of the historical 
effect of adalimumab over placebo (based on a meta- analy sis of GAIN and CL ASSI C1; see 
Appendix 10.3 for furt her details). 
7.3.2 Secondary endpoint analys es
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints [IP_ADDRESS]
To support the primary  objective, the secondary  efficacy  endpoints detailed in Section 5.1.2
will be anal yzed descriptively  based on the FAS.
For the proportions, the risk difference will be comput ed and presented together with its 9 0% 
and 95% CI and interpreted in a descriptive manner.
Secondary  safet y endpoints [IP_ADDRESS]

All treated patients will be included in the safet y analysis. In general, safet y anal yses will be 
descriptive in nature. No hy pothesis testing is planned .No formal inferential analy ses are 
planned for safet y comparison. The anal yses will be based on the SAF.
Statistical analy sis and reporting of AEs will concentrate on treatment -emergent AEs. To this 
end, all AEs occurring between start of treatment and end of the REP will be considered 
‘treatment -emergent’. The REP is defined as [ADDRESS_801532] drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will also be 
considered as ‘treatment -emergent ’. Other AEs will be assigned to the appropriate trial 
phases, i.e., screening or post- treatment. For patients switching from EU -approved Humira to 
BI 695501, AEs occurring after the first dose of BI [ADDRESS_801533] dose of BI 695501 will be assigned to 
the ongoing treatment.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of AEs will be tabulated by s ystem organ class 
and preferred term after coding according to the current versi on of MedDRA. In addition, RR
and risk difference together with 95% CIs will be presented for the overall population (details 
will be specified in the TSAP) .
Laboratory  data will be analy zed quantitativel y as well as qualitatively. The latter will be 
done via comparison of laboratory data with their reference ranges. Values outside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically  relevant will be highlighted in the 
listings. Treatment groups will be compared descriptively with regard to distribut ion 
parameters as well as with regard to frequency  and percentage of patients with abnormal 
values or clinicall y relevant abnormal values.
Vital signs, ph ysical examinations, or other safet y-relevant data observed at screening, 
baseline, during the course of the trial and at the end -of-trial evaluation will be assessed with 
regard to possible changes compared with findings before start of treatment.

BLINDING
This is a double -blind trial, therefore patients, investigator s,and trial personnel (except the 
trial personnel administering the trial medication at site ) will remain blinded with regard to 
the randomized treatment assignments until after database lock.
The secondary  packaging (boxes containing s yringes) will be identical for both BI [ADDRESS_801555]’s delivery  to the trial site will include dates, quantities, batch/serial 
numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_4061]  (‘use by’) dates and the unique code numbers assigned to the investigational 
products and t rial patients. The designated unblinded or blinded person will maintain records 
that document doses administered to patients and reconcile all investigational product 
received at site. At the time of return to sponsor orlocal destruction, the designated u nblinded 
or blinded person must verify  that no supplies remained at the trial site.
The unblinded trial personnel administering the trial medication will not be involved in any  
other trial assessments or procedures.
A description of the trial medication i s provided in Table 4.1.1: 1 and Table 4.1.1: 2 .
Patient blinding procedure
Trial medication will be administered by  [CONTACT_605302] 22 . To ensure 
patient’s blinding during the administration process, the following procedures are to be 
applied:
Syringes unpacked and prepared for injection are to be covered by  a surgical drape at the 
time of patient preparation for dosing. The same procedure is to be applied to used 
syringes after injection.
During the dose administration, patients are to be separated from the unblinded designee 
who will administer the trial medication by , for example, a surgical drape or screen.
Used sy ringes should be discarded in asharp container immediately after use .

population:
CLASSI C1 (R13-2267 ):a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging 
trial performed to evaluate the efficacy  of adalimumab induction therapi[INVESTIGATOR_605271]. In this trial, one endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving a 70 -point 
response at Week 4.
GAIN ( R13 2264 ): a 4-week, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial 
performed to determine whether adalimumab induces remission more frequently  than 
placebo in adult patients with CDwho have s ymptoms. One endpoint was also the 
decrease in CDAI score by  70 points.
The results are detailed in Table 10.3: 1 .

normalize and variance- stabilize the sampling distribution of proportions. Then the 
fixed-effects method was used to pool the response rates together. When back- transforming 
the results and considering inverse -variance weights, the pooled response rate was 54.1% 
(95% CI from 47.6% to 60.4%).
Non-inferiority margin
As this is an add- on study  only , the standard rules for non
-inferiority  margin selection will 
not be applied. Instead, the magnitude of preserved historical treatment effect will be used 
(based on the point estimate rather than confidence in terval).
The RRs of the two studies were pooled to determine the non- inferiority  margin of the study . 
Log transformation was performed and a fixed- effect method (Mantel -Haenszel) was used to 
pool the RRs together. Using the inverse of the lower limit of th e 90% CI of the RR, 
M1=1/1.31 (=0.76) preserves about 39% of the historical treatment effect of adalimumab 
over placebo (calculated as [ln{1.56} -ln{1.31}]/ln[1.56] =0.3928). The results are presented 
below:

not necessary . 
Additionally , the patients with moderatel y to 
severel y active CD (CDAI 220 -450), confirmed by  
[CONTACT_580039] y or radiologic evaluation represent a 
relativel y small proportion in a Crohn’s disease 
population. This fact causes enormous di fficulties 
to find the patients for the study participation 
within a reasonable timeframe and therefore the 
trial was redesigned to an exploratory  trial. 
Implementation of the updated statistical 
considerations will allow achieving the stud y 
objectives for the efficacy , as well as the

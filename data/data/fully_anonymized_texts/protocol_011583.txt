A Mobile Intervention to Reduce Pain and Improve Health 
(MORPH) – Phase II
Informed Consent Form to Participate in Research
Principal Investigators—Amber Brooks, MD, and Jason Fanning, PhD
Introduction
You are invited to take part in this research study. Research studies are designed to give 
scientific knowledge that can help other people in the future. You have been asked to be 
involved in this study because you are 55-85 years old, fit the health and weight requirements, 
and because you are interested in participating in MORPH. Remember that your participation is 
voluntary. We encourage you to take your time making your decision as to whether or not you 
would like to participate. Please ask the study staff to explain any and all words or information in 
this informed consent document that you do not understand fully. We may also discuss this study 
with your doctor, friends, and family.
Why are we Conducting the MORPH Study? 
This study will help us understand how we can help those with chronic pain to move more and 
lose weight, and then better understand how these help to manage pain symptoms.
How Many People Will Take Part in MORPH?
A total of [ADDRESS_978248] 35 individuals participate in this 
study, we may need to screen as many as 90 individuals, as some may not qualify for the study.
What is Involved in this Study? 
If you agree to participate in MORPH by [CONTACT_424024], you will be asked 
to attend a total of 2 assessment visits (V1 and V4) at a Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center 
facility. During your time in the active intervention study period, you may be asked to attend 2 
orientation sessions, 3 in-person group coaching sessions (one per week), followed by 9 group 
internet-based coaching sessions (one per week).
Visit 1 (V1)
During this visit, we will:
Review this consent form with you  
Measure your height, weight, blood pressure and pulse
Ask you to complete a series of questions about your background, medical history, 
medications, feelings, and memory

9/25/2019Ask you to complete a short series of physical tasks that involve balancing, walking over 
short distances, and rising from a chair. 
You will be randomized in person at this visit or by [CONTACT_717426] 2-[ADDRESS_978249] a 
1 in 2 (equal) chance of being placed into either group. You must agree to be in any of the 
groups and you may not pi[INVESTIGATOR_717423]. You will participate in 
your assigned group for a total of about 14 weeks before the final testing visit is conducted.
The groups are:
1. MORPH Immediate Intervention
2. MORPH Delayed Intervention
We will provide all participants with an activity monitor (Fitbit), which is a small watch-like 
device that gives you information about your activity level, and we will ask that you wear this 
daily. All participants will also receive an electronic scale that allows you to keep track of your 
weight over time. Participants that complete the program will be allowed to keep the activity 
monitor but are asked to return the scale. If either device breaks during the study, you will 
receive a replacement at no charge but we ask that you take care of both to ensure you are able to 
use them both throughout the study. Additionally, all participants will receive the thigh-worn 
activity monitor (Activpal) in-person or by [CONTACT_2319]. You will be asked to wear the device prior to 
the start of the study and once more throughout the final week of the study and return it at your 
last visit.
The MORPH Intervention program
When you start your MORPH intervention program (either immediately or after your delay) you 
will have [ADDRESS_978250] orientation will focus on the technology in the study 
and be an introduction to a smartphone app, a weight scale, and two activity monitors: (1) an 
activity monitor watch that will be worn for the duration of the study (Fitbit), and (2) an activity 
monitor that is worn on the thigh for one week (ActivPal). This visit is expected to take between 
[ADDRESS_978251] Medical Center facility per week. For the remaining 9 weeks, 
participants will be asked to “attend” virtual group coaching sessions by [CONTACT_2329] a computer or 
smartphone, and participants will receive instruction for these sessions during the initial [ADDRESS_978252]

9/25/2019you can use these behaviors to help manage your pain symptoms. You will set goals for 
movement with the group leader, and will receive feedback on your movement in real time 
within the app. You will track the food that you eat throughout the program either using study-
provided logs or electronic tracking software, and the group leader will help you to set weight 
loss goals. Finally, during weeks 1, 5, and 9, you will complete a series of [ADDRESS_978253] completed your Visit 4 (V4) assessment visit, you will have 
the option of enrolling in the active intervention program. If agreed, you will be scheduled for 
your two orientations and the 12-week MORPH intervention program.
Visit 4 (V4) at about 14-19 weeks after V1
During this visit, we will:
Measure your height, weight, blood pressure and pulse
Ask you to complete a series of questions about your medical history, medications, and 
feelings
Ask you to complete a short series of physical tasks that involve balancing, walking over 
short distances, and rising from a chair. 
This visit will take  up to 2 hours to complete.
How Long Will I Be in the Study? 
You will be in the study for approximately four to eight months depending on your group 
assignment. You can stop participating at any time. If you decide to stop participating in the 
study, we encourage you to talk to the study investigators or study staff first to learn more about 
potential health or safety consequences.
What are the Risks of the Study? 
Being in this movement and weight loss study involves some risk. You should discuss the risk of 
being in this study with the study investigators or staff. A Data Safety and Monitoring 
Committee, an independent group of experts, will be reviewing the data from this research 
throughout the study. Risks and side effects related to the study programs and procedures 
include:

9/25/[ZIP_CODE].  Diet Program
There are no known serious risks associated with using caloric restriction to lose weight. 
Changes in usual bowel function (diarrhea and/or constipation) may occur when beginning the 
new diet due to differences between this diet and your usual diet. Under conditions of rapid 
weight loss (more than 5 pounds per week), there is a very small chance of developi[INVESTIGATOR_717424].
2. Movement Program 
The risks of the exercise program are minimal, but may include fainting, dizziness, irregular 
heartbeat, chest pain, heart attack, exacerbation of pain symptoms, or in extremely rare 
circumstances, sudden death. They may also include stresses and strains of muscles, twisted 
ankles, or falls. During the program, be sure to report any such changes in your health to study 
staff.
3. Physical Performance Tests
There is a slight risk of falls while participating in the balance test. However, you will be 
positioned beside a step or wall that can be reached immediately if you feel that you are going to 
lose your balance. Additionally, the staff member conducting the test will stand next to you at all 
times. There is a small possibility that you may stumble, fall or aggravate one of your 
joints/muscles during the walking test. You will not be asked to conduct these tests if you have a 
pre-existing and serious leg injury.
4.Activity Monitors
Risks associated with wearing the activity monitors are minimal, but may include minor skin 
irritations.  You will be instructed to note these on your log and if it becomes bothersome to 
remove the device and call staff for further instructions.
5. Confidentiality
Taking part in this research study may involve providing information that you consider 
confidential or private. Efforts, such as coding research records, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_128559], will be made to keep 
your information safe. As part of this study, you will wear a Fitbit activity monitor, receive text 
messages to complete brief surveys about your mood and pain severity, and use a web 
application to view feedback. These data will be transmitted on a secure connection and any 
potentially sensitive information (e.g., survey responses) will be encoded using a secret key 
stored separate from your information before they are stored on a password-protected server 
operated by 1&1 Internet Inc. Finally, once you complete the study, we will destroy the link with 
your encoded phone number.
As part of this research study, you will be videotaped/audiotaped.  This is being done to assess 
how user-friendly the app is.  You should understand that you will not be able to inspect, review, 
or approve the videotapes and audiotapes.  These tapes will be destroyed once their use in this 
study is finished.

9/25/2019Are There Benefits to Taking Part in the Study? 
If you agree to take part in this study, there may or may not be direct benefit to you. We hope the 
information learned from this study will benefit other people in the future. The benefits of 
participating in this study include receiving information about your physical function, your 
weight, and your movement, and we hope that you begin to learn how your movement levels 
affect your daily pain. A possible benefit is that by [CONTACT_717427]. However, because individuals respond differently to diet, no one can 
know in advance if it will be helpful in your particular case.
What Other Choices Are There?
This is not a treatment study, and so the alternative is to not participate in this study.
What About My Health Information?
In this research study, any new information we collect from you about your health or behaviors 
is considered Protected Health Information. The information we will collect for this research 
study includes: health history, your family health history, how you respond to study activities or 
procedures, and information from study visits, phone calls, and surveys.
If this research study involves the diagnosis or treatment of a medical condition, then Protected 
Health Information collected from you during this study may be placed in your medical record, 
and may be used to help treat you, arrange payment for your care, or assist with Medical Center 
operations. 
We will make every effort to keep your Protected Health Information private. We will store 
records of your Protected Health Information in a cabinet in a locked office or on a password 
protected computer. Only the following people or organizations will be granted access to your 
Protected Health Information:
1) The study investigators and their staff, or others at Wake Forest University Health Sciences 
who oversee research,
2) Other people or laboratories providing services for this research project on behalf of Wake 
Forest University Health Sciences and Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center. 
If required by [CONTACT_47329], we might also have to share your Protected Health Information 
with a judge, law enforcement officer, government agencies, or others. If your Protected Health 
Information is shared with any of these groups it may no longer be protected by [CONTACT_128562].
Any Protected Health Information collected from you in this study that is maintained in the 
research records will be kept for at least six years after the study is finished. At that time any 
research information not already in your medical record will either be destroyed or it will be de-
identified. You will not be able to obtain a copy of your Protected Health Information in the 
research records until all activities in the study are completely finished.

[ADDRESS_410957] will provide initial evidence for increasing patient 
access to the G -EO System, and this could be accomplished through “regional technology 
centers”  using a rural health -delivery approach.  
 
There are several novel aspects of the proposed trial: (1) the examination of a novel gait 
rehabilitation stimulus (G -EO System) that could alter current clinical practices; (2) the focus on 
patients with progress ive MS who have gait impairment (i.e., those who have received minimal 
research attention), which was recently described as the greatest therapeutic challenge facing the 
MS community;  and (3) a study design that accounts for standard therapy.  
 
Specific Ai ms: We propose a single -blinded, randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_332204] -
assisted gait training using the G -EO System in patients with progressive MS with gait disability 
(EDSS=4.0 -7.5).  
 
Specific Aim 1  will establish the safety and feasibility of g ait training using the G -EO System.  
 
Specific Aim 2  will determine the efficacy of gait training using the G -EO System for improving 
mobility, symptomatic, quality of life, and participatory outcomes.

[ADDRESS_410958] it read to 
them and to ask questions (see Informed Consent Draft). Consent will be obtained before 
randomization and assessments. The consent process  will take place at the Indiana Center 
for Advanced Neurorehabilitation (ICAN) in the Neurorehabilitation and Robotics IU 
Health Neuroscience Center, [ADDRESS_410959], Room 1078, Indianapolis, IN [ZIP_CODE] 
([PHONE_6919].  
If found eligible for the study a nd agree to consent to participate, subjects will be 
matched based on disability level  (EDSS) , and randomized to either conventional 
physical therapy (CPT) group  or CPT with G -EO training using a random numbers 
generator and concealed allocation.  
 
4.0 Study P rocedures  
 
Screening  
Potential subjects will be referred to the study via IU Health Physicians who specialize in the 
treatment and management of individuals with Multiple Sclerosis. A member of the research team 
will screen the referral by [CONTACT_154946] p hysician and confirming they meet the necessary 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Following confirmation of criteria, potential subjects will be 
contact[CONTACT_332206].   
 
Assessments  
The study outcomes will be collected by [CONTACT_3148] -blinded researchers. All participants on Day 1 
who consent to be in the study will complete the following m obility outcomes:  
1. Spatial and temporal gait kinematics will be assessed using a PKMAS Zeno Walkway 
(Protokinetics). Participants will be asked to walk over a 14 foot pressure mat that will 
capture their gait kinematics and speed.  
2. A 2-minute walk (2MW T) tests to determine walking endurance . Subjects will be asked 
to walk for [ADDRESS_410960] 
Scale -29. They will complete a questionnaire.  
8. Their perceiv ed ability to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADL) using the Late -Life 
Function and Disability Inventory.  They will complete a questionnaire.  
Participants who complete the first 6 weeks of training will be asked to complete assessments 1 
thru 3. Partic ipants who complete all 12 weeks of training will be asked to complete all 
assessments one final time.

treatments, all subjects will be asked to complete assessments #1 thru #3 above. Following 
completion of the additional 10 treatments (total of 20 treatment sessions), each subject will 
complete all assessments performed on Day 1. (See Table 1) If a subject cancels a treatment 
session, it will be rescheduled to ensure that all subjects complete the total of [ADDRESS_410962] misses three consecutive treatment sessions, they will 
be dropped from the study due to inconsistency in treatment carryover. Cancellations and changes in patient scheduling represents a true clinical en vironment and represents normal clinical patient 
management. Therefore, the emphasis is on total number of treatments (20) and not on total 
number of weeks.

[ADDRESS_410966]. Altenburger. The clinicians involved in the delivery of the intervention w ill not be involved in outcome assessments. 
Participants in both conditions will receive conventional physical therapy (CPT) as usual 
care. Participants in the G-EO training condition will also receive robot-assisted gait training. This design will control for attent ion and social contact, total rehabilitation time, 
and intensity. Both conditions will be delivered at the same frequency (2x/week), 
intensity (40 to 60 minutes), and duration over 12-weeks. Progression will occur by [CONTACT_332207]. Trai ning intensity will be monitored and 
standardized using the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion38 scale, and will progress from ‘fairly light’ (11) to ‘somewhat hard’ (13). This prescription is consistent and appropriate for individuals with progressive MS with m obility impairment and low fitness levels. 
Progression will occur by [CONTACT_332208] ~5min/week up to 60 
minutes per session. Total training time includes both CPT and G-EO training for the G-EO condition (i.e., 30min of CPT + 30min G-EO).  Training sessions will not exceed [ADDRESS_410967] all training paramete rs. Physical therapy training sessions will 
involve: 3-5 minute warm-up, stretching, progress ive strength training exercises, and gait 
and balance training. Additional strategies for home exercises, energy conservation, fall prevention, and appropriate assistive devices (i.e ., orthotics) will be provided universally.  
Conventional physical therapy (CPT):  A CPT session will involve a 3-5 minute warm-up, 
stretching, progressive strength training exercises, and gait and balance training.  
 
G-EO training:  Using the G-EO System, participants will be secured with the appropriate sized 
harness and attached to an overhead body-weight support system, with feet secured to pressure 
sensitive footplates. Each session will begin with  a 3-5 minute warm-up in the continuous passive 
mode (cadence ~40-45 steps/minute). The participant will then be transitioned into the adaptive 
training phase for practicing repetitive floor walking for up to [ADDRESS_410968] of adverse events, and

compliance with approved protocols . Safety will be evaluated through assessment of recorded 
adverse events.  
 
5.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
Data will be analyzed using IBM SPSS Version 22.0 (IMB Corps., Armonk, NY). Descriptive 
statistics will characterize the sample on demographic, clinical, safety, and feasibility metrics. We 
will compare safety and feasibility between groups using chi -square and t-tests for independent 
samples ( Specific Aim 1 ). The efficacy of the intervention on study variables ( Specific Aim 2 ) will 
be examined using a 2 (Group) by 2 (Time), mixed factor ANOVA. A completers anal ysis will be 
conducted (i.e., ≥75% of sessions completed). Effect sizes associated with F -statistics will be 
expressed as eta -squared (η 2), and effect sizes based on mean differences will be expressed as 
Cohen’s d.

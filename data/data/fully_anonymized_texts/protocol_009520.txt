Version 2:  02/09/[ADDRESS_1016036] injury (SCI) 1. Disabling SCI 
sequelae include impairments of locomotor, sensory and autonomic  functions 2, 3. The U.S. could save an 
estim ated $[ADDRESS_1016037] clinical co nditions and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394] 4, and individuals with SCI 
are eleven times more likely to die from diseases of the urinary system than non-injured individuals.   Locomotor 
Training (LT) has shown a range of benefits on health and function in both human 5-17 and animal 18, 19 models.  
Improved bladder and sexual function has been reported by [CONTACT_743288]; 
however this phenomenon has  not been studied.  The mechanistic insights of how LT affects not just walking 
recovery but urological a nd sexual function not only will lead to imminent treatments for those suffering with SCI 
but may influence the treatment of other neurological d isorders  such  as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s, and 
stroke, and stimulate investigations on  other systems such  as cardiovascular, pulmonary and bowel dy sfunctions. 
 
1. Urological Dysfun ction and SCI. Deficits in urological function after SCI manifest as: detrusor hyperreflexia 
(bladder contractions at low volumes,  causing incontinence and smooth muscle hypertrophy), detrusor-sphincter 
dyssynergia (uncoordinated bladder and external  urethral sphincter contractions, causing inefficient emptying and 
smooth muscle hypertrophy), decreased c ompliance (unable to store urine under appropri ately low pressures) 
and loss of continence requiring lifelong management, maintena nce, and hea lth care  visits 20. Current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_743246], management and continence after SCI include catheterization, 
pharmacologic and surgical interventions, functional electrical stimulation, and urethral s tents 21, 22. 
Catheterization can induce scarring, stricture formation, cystitis and frequent urinary tract infections due to 
introduction of bacteria into the urethra 23. Pharmacological agents alter internal urethral sphincter tone (α 
blockers) or relax the detrusor muscle (anticholinergics increase bladder compliance and d ecrease 
pressur e) but do not treat voluntary voiding. These drugs have side effects like dry mouth and constipation 
further comp licating the issue of fluid restriction to control timely urine evacuation 21, 24. Surgeries to reduce h igh 
bladder pressures  and chron ic urinary incontinence include urinary diversion and l ower urinary tract 
reconstruction 22, 25, 26. Surgery to implant neural control devices to artificially influence voiding circuitry often 
require ablation of intact neural tracts. There is a critical need for a succ essful treatment that restores normal 
lower urinary tract function as the compens atory strategies continue to diminish the capacity of the bladder, 
require life-long maintenance, have deleterious side effects and lead to recurring illness . 
 
2. Locomotor Circuitry and Blad der Function. The interaction of lower limb musculature with the bladder and 
its sp hincter h as been observed sp oradically over the years, as far back as 1933, in both humans 27, 28 and 
animals 29, 30. Flexor and extensor reflexes can be modulated by [CONTACT_743289] 28. In patients with spas ticity, the general pattern is that detrusor 
contractions precede limb flexor spasms 31. Our experience with patients undergoing LT reveals two impo rtant 
observations: 1) catheterization is required before each session because a full bladder will inhibit steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; and 
2) an individual who received LT  in combination with epi[INVESTIGATOR_743247]. These observations suggest an interaction of the locomotor and 
bladder circuitry that is emphasized after SCI. Afferent input from the bladder and/or the external urethral 
sphincter affects the limb musculature and repetitive activation of the locomotor circuitry seems to affect bladder 
function. We propose that this vesicosomatic relationship can be  influenced by [CONTACT_743290] b ladder integrity 
and function and improve the health/quality of life for those suffering from SCI. 
Recent discoveries in humans related to activity-dependent  plasticity have led to a widely imple mented acti vity-
based (generates neuromuscular activation below the level of injury) rehabilitation intervention, LT, for those with 
incomp lete SCI 14, 32-35. The therapeutic intervention is usually implemen ted in those with incomp lete injuries, 
even though the mechanistic studies have been d one in clinically comp lete SCI, because while LT optimizes the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_503448], remaining residual su praspi[INVESTIGATOR_743248] 36. Generation of locomotion by [CONTACT_743291][INVESTIGATOR_743249] 18, 37-[ADDRESS_1016038] in the

Version 2:  02/09/[ADDRESS_1016039]  interneuronal  
networks 47, 51, 55, 56. Multiple sensory  inputs from the periphery during locomo tion, particularly limb loading 57 and 
steppi[INVESTIGATOR_301057] 58 provide in formation to these networks to improve steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 53, 55, 
59-61. 
One individual with a clinically motor c omplete SCI did not produce motor activity in the legs even after 170 
sessions of LT. However, in the prese nce of epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] s timulation, he was able to stand independently and 
voluntarily move his legs indicating that the spi[INVESTIGATOR_743250] a sufficient level of e xcitability to execute 
motor tasks.  Intense, repetitive LT with sufficient spi[INVESTIGATOR_743251] (via residual su praspi[INVESTIGATOR_743252]) conceivably induces a net improvement in functional reorganization of the neural c ircuitry in 
response to afferent feedback and supraspi[INVESTIGATOR_743253]/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_429473] 62-65. Improving these 
synaptic inputs might therefore also lead to adaptive chan ges to other systems such as  those controlling the 
bladder and genitalia since much of the motor and autonomic output of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_743254] 51, 66-69. 
 
3. Sexual Dysfun ction and SCI  In men with SCI, the degree of sexual dysfunction depends on level of the 
lesion.  For our research, only injuries cranial to T10 are considered as the spi[INVESTIGATOR_743255], with only the removal of su praspi[INVESTIGATOR_216935] 70.  Most individuals with 
SCI’s above T10 demonstrate reflexogenic erections of varying degrees in response to very slight stimulation of 
the penis 71, 72. Though erections are eas ily initiated,  they are not easily susta ined 73 which has  been propos ed to 
be a result of altered penile sensitivity 74.  In 95% of SCI men with lesions cranial to T10, normal ejaculation is 
severely impaired or  impossible 72, [ADDRESS_1016040]-SCI 77. 
 
4. Neurotrophins. Exercise  and neur omuscular activity are highly influential on express ion of neurotrophins 
(such as BDN F and NT-[ADDRESS_1016041] and so leus muscle - 78) known to modulate cellular and 
synaptic function in the adult 79-82. Among various strategies, step training after contusive SCI in animal studies 
promotes the greatest changes in neur otrophin production and  functional recovery (such as  the normalization 
of BDN F levels in the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_743256] - 83). Other forms of exercise attempted in the 
contused rat model, such as swim training, only had a transient effect, and stand training had no effect on 
neurotrophins and functional recovery 83. 
Transplantation of NT-3/BDN F express ing fibroblasts into the injury site after contusive SCI has been 
reported to increase bladder and locomotor function 84 and viral-vector-mediated delivery of NT-3 via i.m. 
injection after SCI promotes locomotor recovery a nd electrophysiological changes in motone urons akin to 
training 80. Combined step training and neurotrophin therapy results in greater locomotor gains than either alone 
85. Although increased levels of NT-3/BDN F appear to be adaptive/ben eficial when expressed in the sp inal cord  
or muscles (at least for locomotor functions), increased  NGF in the bladder and corresponding sp inal segments 
plays a significant role in dysfunction. Upregulation of neurotrophic factors post-SCI [ADDRESS_1016042] been implicated as key factors in a variety of bladder dysfunctions 89. 
NGF delivery (intrathecal infusion at L6-S1 spi[INVESTIGATOR_743257]) causes bladder DRG afferents to become 
hyper-excited and results in detrusor hyperreflexia 90, while NGF  removal, via antibody treatment (intrathecal 
infusion at L6-S1 spi[INVESTIGATOR_743257]), has been shown to relieve detrusor hyperreflexia and de trusor-
sphincter dyssynergia 91, 92. Sequestering BDNF (daily tail vein administration of TrkB-Ig2, which spec ifically binds 
BDN F and ne utralizes it) has been shown to improve bladder function in a chron ic cystitis model 93. Exercise  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_743258], not just skeletal muscle 94, 95. We

these individuals’ continual health and quality of life. 
 
- This proposal involves the collaboration of scientists with extensive experience in  animal and human SCI 
models. In our currently funded animal study, rats undergoing step training are a lso be ing compared to a SCI 
group receiving the same intensity of exercise without weight bearing by [CONTACT_523375][INVESTIGATOR_743259] 
(equivalent to the arm crank or non -weight bearing exercise control group proposed here), as well as to an 
uninjured group. These ongoing parallel studies in animals will provide further insights to underlying 
mechanisms that can also be  tested in the human model. 
 
- A novel multi-disciplinary comb ination of outcome measures including EMG recordings, steppi[INVESTIGATOR_743260], urodynamics, International Index of Erectile Functi on, and molecular assessments of bladder tissue 
will also be  conducted in this study. Histological, biochemical, and molecular assessments of spi[INVESTIGATOR_743261]. 
 
- The current propos ed study will increase  our understanding of human lumbosacral  spi[INVESTIGATOR_743262] o nly improve the motor 
output during standing and walking but ameliorate bladder and sexual dysfunction and thus improve quality of life 
in individuals after SCI. 
 
APPROACH 
1. General Design. Individuals who susta ined a SCI will undergo assessments for bladder and sexual function  
who are receiving different types of physical therapy interventions by [CONTACT_743292]:  1) clinically, 2) 
as part of another research study that has an activity -based intervention ( IRB 07.0066; 07.0268; 13.0625 ; 
14.1284 ) or 3) a control interventi on as part of this study . This approach allows us to efficiently and cost effectively 
understand the role of specific mechanisms of activity -based inte rventions on devastating secondary conditions 
resulting from SCI.11 
 (Specific Aims 1  and 2). Specific Aim 1 and 2 is designed to understand the  effects of weight -bearing 
activity -based therapy on bladder function and sexual function.  The weight -bearing activity -based intervention will be 
provided via a standardized locomotor training program that is provided clinically at Frazier Rehab Institute within 
the NeuroRecovery Network (NRN ); or similar intervention s in a research protocol of steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (IRB 07.0066 ) or a 
stand ing program with or without neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)  - (07.0268 , 14.1284 ).  The stand 
only intervention may also be provided as part of this study.  The control group intervention will be provided via a 
non-weight bearing exercise program that consists of either  standardized  arm crank or upper extremity 
neurom uscular electrical stimulation (UE -NMES)  provided within this study .  The UE -NMES may  also be  provided 
as a s tandardized occupational therapy program that is provided clinically at Frazier Rehab Institute within the 
NeuroRecovery Network (NRN ).  We may also evaluate research participants at the  midpoin t.  The r esearch 
participants  (n=30)  selected  for Aims 1 and 2  will be from a convenience population to provide a sufficient number 
of controls in the non -weight bearing group . Blocked randomizatio n will be used and the specific intervention  
(n=10 step; n=10 stand; n=10 non -weight bearing)  will be chosen based on the physical examination by [CONTACT_743293][INVESTIGATOR_541].

without weight -bearing activity -based therapy on bladder and sexual function.  The up to 10 SCI individuals will 
be evaluated before and after their interventions defined from their epi[INVESTIGATOR_743264] (IRB 07.0066 and 
13.0625).   The interventions may include:  stand and/ or step  training with LT, cardiovascular (CV) training , and/or 
voluntary movement (VM) training, a s provided by [CONTACT_743294]. We may also evaluate research participants at the midpoint of training . 
 When a research participant is enrolled in to the non -weight bearing training  group, a  physical 
examination may be provided (for cervical and upper thoracic SCIs – T3 and above) by [CONTACT_743295][INVESTIGATOR_102752] s/he will recommend either the arm crank training or  UE-NMES  intervention for the control group .   
Each individual will serve as their own control reducing the variability among individuals related to the injury 
itself, time since injury, medications taken, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_223213], differenc es in degree of sexual dysfunction, and 
many other  factors that cannot be controlled in the human experience. The inclusion criteria for both cohort 
research participants are: 1) stable medical co ndition, 2) Non -progressive, suprasacral  SCI, 3) Bladder and 
sexual dysfunction as a result of SCI, 4) Indication that the period of spi[INVESTIGATOR_743265]. The exclusion 
criteria for both cohort research participants are: 1) Cardiopulmonary  disease or dysautonomia that would 
contraindicate LT, stand , or non -weight bearing training ; 2) Painful musculoskeletal d ysfunction, untreated  
fracture, severe contractures, untreated pressure wounds or active urinary tract infection that would affect training 
and/or assessments ; 3)  Untreated psychiatric disorders or ongoing dr ug abuse; Urodynamic parameters, 
erectile dysfunction evaluations, urine biomarker and biopsy samp le retrieval, and EMG acti vity assessmen ts will 
be co nducted as ou tlined in Figure 1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure  1. Timeline for Aims 1 and 2 (left) and Aim 3 (right). For Aims 1 and 2 research participants with 
incomplete SCI (American Spi[INVESTIGATOR_329248] (AIS) B, C or D 96-98), 
urodynamic/erectile function ass essments and biopsies will be c onducted  prior to enrollment in the 
standardized NRN LT program and after 80 sessions of the intervention. Assessments may also be 
conducted at the midpoint of training . Training will be d one in groups of three (one LT, one stand training, 
one non-weight bearing training). For Aim 3, urodynamic/erectile function ass essments and EMG activity will 
be co nducted on individuals with severe SCI (those who are  motor comp lete and sen sory complete [AIS A] 
or sensory incomplete [AIS B]) (i) before LT or at baseline , (ii) after 80 sessions of LT plus stand or an 
equivalent time -frame of participant usual care  activity , prior to implantation, (iii) after 80 sessions of step 
plus stand training (mid training LT) or CV training  in comb ination with epi[INVESTIGATOR_429473] (ES), (iv) after 80 
sessions of LT plus stand training (post training LT) or CV , VM training in combination with epi[INVESTIGATOR_429500], and (v) after 6 month follow -up LT (total of 4 follow -ups or 2 years) or CV , VM,  stand training 
plus follow -ups in combination with epi[INVESTIGATOR_429473] (n=2 per year for a total of 10 over 5 years). 
 
 
2. Approach for Specific Aims. 
a. Specific Aim 1: To determine the effects of weight-bearing task-specific training for locomotion (steppi[INVESTIGATOR_54139] 
a treadmill) after traumatic incomplete and comp lete SCI in humans on a) urodynamic parameters, b) 
interactions between lower limb and urinary bladder circuitries, and c) bladder neurotrophin levels. Weight-

Version 2:  02/09/2017   Page 5 of 15 bearing (stand-only) and non-weight-bearing exercise (arm crank, UE-NMES ) will serve as controls. 
SCI research participants are  expected to exhibit marked urological d eficits (e.g., detrusor hyper-reflexia with 
detrusor-external  sphincter  dyssynergia). An example sho wing a base line cystometrogram  (to demons trate 
feasibility) from a [ADDRESS_1016044]-SCI (C7 level; AIS B), is provided in F igure 2. 
We hypothesize that individuals with severe SCI after LT will have significant improvemen ts in continence 
and voiding ability, as evidenced by [CONTACT_156715] b ladder capacity, lower detrusor pressures and voiding 
pressure s, the ability to resume normal voiding at least partially without catheterization, and lower post-void 
residual volumes. 
 
 
 
 
Figure  2. At the beginning of the filling curve at around [ADDRESS_1016045] (two years post-SCI) during preliminary 
studies of LT effects on bladder function indicates an increase in  comp liance a nd dou bling of volume at first 
uninhibited bladder contraction after 80 daily sessions of LT (Figure 3). The recording in Figure 3 provides an 
example of how cystometry (see details below in General Methods) measurements of resting pressures, b ladder 
capacity, and voiding volumes  will be quantified. Lower resting pressures reflect the ability of the bladder to 
store more urine (indicative of a change in compliance). For the current propos ed clinical study, we will also 
measure changes in voiding frequency over time using established docume nted voiding diaries. Therefore, 
improvements in a variety of specific quantifiable parameters related to bladder function are e xpected to 
contribute to better continence as well as im proved voiding efficiency revealed by  a dec rease in residual volume 
and voiding frequency, an outcome that would likely lead to improved urological health and quality of life for 
those suffering from SCI.

Figure  3.  Example of cystometry recordings from a 29 year old male AIS Grade A (motor and sensory comp lete 
SCI) two years after injury (T5 neuro level). Improvement  of compliance and dou bling of the volume at  the time of 
his first uninhibited bladder contraction was no ted after 80 sessions of LT. Note that this individual’s bladder 
medications were discontinued 24 hours prior to each of the cystometry sessions. In addition, this individual 
reported having chills through both legs when his bladder was full after, but not before LT  (he said he started 
noticing the sensation after several weeks of training). Note that he is sensory comp lete as de termined by [CONTACT_743296] (and thus the need to cathe terize) was a huge benefit 
for him (we have found similar reports for all four subjects that have been s tudied to date in these preliminary 
studies, although the location and type of sensation has varied – see Specific Aim 3 below). 
 
Data from our animal studies (Figure 4 below; manuscri pt in preparation) shows that following 80 step 
training sessions the ability of SCI rats to empty the bladder increased. The mean voiding efficiency (percent 
volume voided/volume infused)  of the trained group was significantly greater than non-trained (Figure 4a, trained 
39.78% ± 17.72; non-trained 22.29% ± 11.02, p=.042). This was acco mpanied by  a significant increase in the 
maximum amplitude of bladder contraction (MAC, press ure in mm Hg) and a significantly increased 
intercontraction interval (ICI, time in seconds) (Figure 4, MAC p=.043, trained 6.54±4.75 non-trained 
2.56±1.39; ICI p=.018, trained 25.40±12.98 non-trained 12.25±3.77). Contraction time (trained 25.23±15.35 
sec, non-trained 16.03±3.67 sec), resting pressure (trained 16.10±5.52 mmHg, non-trained 17.80±2.46 
mmHg), and bladder weight (trained 0.36±0.11 g non-trained 0.40±0.10 g) demonstrated no differences 
between groups. However, bladder weight (grams) significantly correlated with voiding efficiency in only the 
trained group  (p=.004, r= -.946, r2=.895, n=6). Bladder hypertrophy post-SCI can result from detrusor sphincter 
dyssynergia in a  manner similar to bladder outlet obstruction which is reversible with outlet relief 99, 100. The 
sphincter must be relaxed during a bladder contraction to allow emptying. We can infer that the sphincter  of the 
trained rats was in p artial co ordination to allow for the flow of urine, an increase in voiding efficiency, and the 
significant relationship between bladder weight and voiding efficiency for trained rats.

Figur e 4. Bladder NGF mRNA and Cystometry. a) Percent change from the non-trained mean for NGF, 
voiding efficiency (percent volume voided per volume saline infused), maximal amp litude of contraction, and 
intercontraction interval. Mean NGF  significantly decreased a nd mean voiding efficiency, intercontraction 
interval (seconds), and maximal amp litude of contraction (mmHg) significantly increased with training. b) 3D 
relationship between cystometry measures. c & d) 3D relationship between NGF  and cystometry measures. 
Significant group differences were detected by [CONTACT_743297] (MAC and ICI were 
good predictors of voiding efficiency with significant group d ifferences (R2=.870, p<.05, N=14)). Therefore, 
training modified the relationship of voiding efficiency, MAC, and ICI. 
 
However, it is not clear whether step training induced bladder recovery is due to activation and p lasticity in 
lumbosacral c ircuitry (bladder and locomotion). To assess potential underlying mechanisms in the current 
propos ed study, bladder neurotrophin levels are also be ing evaluated after SCI. We expect that LT and e pi[INVESTIGATOR_743266] a manner that enhances functional recovery. We 
hypothesize that SCI will induce an increase in NGF  and BDNF in uri ne and  biopsied bladder tissue  and this will 
be reversed  with LT but not with non-weight bearing training or stand training. Note that a study in rats using 
different exercise p aradigms (treadmill training, swim training, stand training) found significant improvemen ts on 
central pain and  normalization of lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_743267] 83. Bladder 
tissue  from our preliminary study in rats was ana lyzed for NGF mRNA using real-time PCR (Figure 4). Multiple 
regression analysis of selected  cystometry parameters with NGF  revealed that two of the cystometry measures  
and bladder weight were good predictors of NGF with significant group differences. ICI and MAC were significant 
predictors of NGF (R2=.638, p<.05, N=14). ICI and bladder weight were significant predictors 
of NGF (R2=.689, p=.004, N=14). Therefore, training modified the relationship of NGF to ICI, MAC, and bladder 
weight. These relationships are demonstrated with 3D graphs in Figure 4b-d. 
Lower NGF levels significantly correlates with lower residual volume,  indicating higher voiding efficiency and 
reduces the potential for recurring urinary tract infections. The relationship between NGF  and residual volume is 
apparent only in assoc iation with LT, which may be due to altered circuitry that controls micturition after SCI. We 
chose to examine NGF  first because previous reports have shown that it is up-regulated in the bladder following 
SCI and it is highly associated with bladder dysfunction. NGF delivery causes b ladder afferents to become hyper-
excited and results in detrusor hyperreflexia 90, while NGF  removal, via antibody treatment, relieves detrusor 
hyperreflexia and de trusor-sphincter dyssynergia 91, 92. Treatment that lowered b ladder BDN F levels reduced 
over-activity in a cystitis rodent model 93 and thus is an additional neurotrophin that we will target. In our current 
animal studies, to broaden potential targets, we are cond ucting a focused n eurotrophin qPCR array using bladder 
tissues from trained versus  non-trained male rats. The results could be us ed to identify one or two additional 
targets to examine in the human tissues we obtain for the current study. Thus, our new rat data (Figure 4) 
indicates  for the first time that the post-SCI bladder NGF levels and bladder function can be  affected in tandem by 
[CONTACT_743298]. This finding would indicate the need to maintain some daily form of training, perhaps in combination with a 
drug therapy (e.g., anti-NGF). These experiments will provide new knowledge of the role of training on the 
neurotrophin regulation in h umans after SCI. 
Similar results are anticipated for urine biomarkers for NGF and BDNF, an area of investigation that has

ersion:  02/01/[ADDRESS_1016046] been p ublished indicating elevated 
urinary levels of NGF and BDNF (but not GDNF) concentrations (measured  by [CONTACT_743299]) in patients with overactive bladder relative to healthy controls 89, 101-104. These levels have been sh own 
to decrease back to normal levels with a variety of treatments, including antimuscarinic therapy 101, 105 and a 3 
month lifestyle intervention (bladder training - limited and select fluid intake) 101. As with overactive bladder, 
urinary biomarkers may be us ed for the evaluation of bladder dysfunction in SCI individuals. In addition, we may 
find a strong correlation with the neurotrophin levels in the biopsy samp les (urinary biomarkers would make it 
much easier to monitor the effects of our therapeutic interventions). 
We also hypothesize that after SCI, bladder filling at rest (tested while doing cystometry) will result in co- 
activation of lower limb flexors and extensors which will be s ignificantly reduced after LT but not for non -weight 
bearing training  or stand training. We hypothesize that the locomotor activity generated during steppi[INVESTIGATOR_743268] (measured as part of a study focused exclusively on locomotor circuitry) and reduce the 
aberrant activity during bladder filling. We may record EMG activity (see d etails in Methods  below) of the lower 
leg muscles during the cystometric testing and during steppi[INVESTIGATOR_54139] a treadmill (bladder is emptied prior to each  60 
minute session, so it will not be fully distended at any point during training). Specifically, we expect that pre-
training, increased tibialis anterior EMG activity (hyperactive flexion reflex) and co-contraction of extensor and 
flexors will occur in response to the bladder contractions. A fully distended bladder (filling during cystometry 
session) is expected to trigger spasticity or clonus. Such a finding would explain the observed need for the 
bladders of human SCI individuals to be emptied immediately prior to rehabilitative step training on a treadmill. A 
full bladder may inhibit training by [CONTACT_743300], thereby [CONTACT_743301]. We 
propose that this functional reorganization occ urs with the LT intervention corresponding to improvements in EMG 
activity during steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. These experiments will further our knowledge abo ut vesicosomatic reflexes and 
understanding about how visceral o rgans may affect other systems, challenging our view of the locomotor system 
and the sources of sensory inputs to the central pattern generator. An example sho wing the benefits of LT on 
EMG activity of the lower leg muscles is provided in F igure 5  from both our human and animal study.

b. Specific Aim 2: To determine the effects of weight-bearing task-specific training for locomotion (steppi[INVESTIGATOR_54139] a 
treadmill) after traumatic incomplete and comp lete SCI in humans on erectile function (stand-only and non-weight 
bearing training  once again will serve as  controls). Subjects will be the same  as for Aim 1. 
SCI research participants are  expected to exhibit marked deficits in sexual function (erection; ejaculation) and 
thus low levels of sexual satis faction upon entering the study 106, 107.  Many are likely to be using dr ugs or se xual 
aids to enhance function. It is hypothesized that LT but n ot non-weight bearing or stand training will result in a 
significant improvement  in erectile function and sexual satis faction as evidenced by a significant score increase in 
the International Index of Erectile Functi on (IIEF), a grade i ncrease on  the Erectile Hardness Grading Scale, and  
a significant reduction in the need to enhance erectile function with medications and/ or aids. Note that the IIEF is 
the “gold standard” for evaluation of erectile function in clinical trials 108, 109 and is the preferred 
instrument for measurement in the SCI population 110. Also, the Erection Hardness  Grading Scale is often used 
along with the IIEF 111, 112. Importantly, studies show that scores obtained with subjective grading of erectile 
hardness by  [CONTACT_743302]  (emotional well-being and 
sexual satisfaction) 112. Preliminary assessments were obtained for one study subject b efore and after 
undergoing epi[INVESTIGATOR_743270] (in add ition to the many anecdotal reports from subjects undergoing LT at 
several rehabilitation centers that are part of the Neural Recovery Network). These preliminary findings are 
provided und er Specific Aim 3 (section c below). 
 
c. Specific Aim 3:  To assess  the added effect of epi[INVESTIGATOR_743271], CV, VM and LT on 
urodynamic parameters, bladder urinary neurotrophin levels and sex ual function after severe complete SCI. 
It is possible that for individuals with motor complete SCI (AIS A, B) who generate very minimal levels of 
EMG activity during steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], significant bladder recovery will not occur, as does not occur for standing and 
steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], even after intensive LT. We can further test the hypothesis of activation of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_743272] a 
mechanism for improved bladder function by [CONTACT_743303] a cohort of individuals who first undergo LT and then 
receive an epi[INVESTIGATOR_743273] (Hypotheses 3A – 3D).  [CONTACT_743312] is the investigator of a NBIB funded study that focuses on the evolution of standing and steppi[INVESTIGATOR_743274] a Craig Neilsen Foundation funded study 
looking at the recovery of CV function in combination with epi[INVESTIGATOR_429473]113. We can leverage these 
already funded and ongoing studies to further our knowledge of activating spi[INVESTIGATOR_743275],including bladder and sexual function. We will comp lete the same  assessments as in

Figure  6.  Cystometry recordings from a 32 year old male with a C7 neuro level SCI, AIS Grade B (motor 
comp lete, sensory incomplete; full pre- recording shown in F igure 2). Note the reduced pressure  during filling 
and some ability to voluntarily void pos t-epi[INVESTIGATOR_743276].  Urgency thresho ld was at 1 60 cc’s pre-epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873]+LT 
and 260 cc’s  post-epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] + LT. Note that during the voiding phase of the post-epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] + LT assessment, the 
subject commented (i) that it was co ld in the room, and (ii) there were lots of people around. Perhaps the void 
would have been more in a different environment. Asked if he tried to void on his own at home, the subject 
stated that he did not try as he  did not want to risk getting a UTI. 
 
In terms of sexual function, the same outcome measures will be d one as per Aim 2. An assessme nt was 
done on  a male subject (AIS Grade A; neuro level T4) receiving epi[INVESTIGATOR_429473] + LT. Prior to enrollment in 
the study, the subject reported being a Grade 2 (increase in  size and sl ight increase in h ardness, but insufficient 
for sexual intercours e) and used the maximum dosage of Viagra (100 mg) 100% of the time to achieve a Grade 
4 (fully hard [rigid] erection) on the Erection Hardness  Grading Scale. After comp letion of the study and returning 
for a six month follow-up (had access to a trainer at home and  did one  hour sessions of stand training 5 days a 
week), the subject reported a Grade 4 score, and only needed to use a low dose of Viagra (25 mg) less than 
50% of the time. He reported through interview that Viagra was nee ded on long work days when he did not  have 
time or energy to do his daily training. He also reported that he noticed the changes in erectile function after 
about [ADDRESS_1016048], whose locomo tor outcome  data was pub lished in 2 011 in Lanc et 114, was trained prior to the start of 
collecting urodynamic data for bladder function. Also, Figure 3 (pre- and post-training example) is from the 
current study participant who just recently received an e pi[INVESTIGATOR_743277]. Although bladder function data is 
provided abo ve for one subject (AIS B, Figures 2 and 6) a nd sexual function data for the other (AIS A described 
in previous paragraph), both participants had improvemen ts in bladder and sexual function. The C7 
AIS B participant, for example, had the ability to ejaculate but experienced head thumpi[INVESTIGATOR_743278] (i.e., 
autonomic  dysreflexia). The subject reported that the head thumpi[INVESTIGATOR_743279]. The first study subject, a T2 AIS B, went from a score of 12 (mild to moderate erectile 
dysfunction) on the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM; short form of the IIEF) to a score of 24 (normal 
erectile function), with satisfaction rating for attempted se xual intercourse increasing from “a few times” to “many 
times” before versus after training plus ep idural stimulation. All four subjects report increas ed 
awareness of bladder fullness after just LT, including ch ills down the legs (per description in F igure 3 legend), a 
sense of press ure below the umbilicus, and a sense of the penis retracting. The C7 AIS B subject, for example, 
would get a tingling sensation in his face and the top of his head (both sides) when his bladder is full (prior to 
enrollment in the study). After training, in addition to these above lesion level se nsations, he also reported a 
tingling sensation in his groin/pen is as his bladder reached capacity during filling while und ergoing cystometry, 
which he  reported began occurring after about [ADDRESS_1016049] would leak a few drops of urine 
while doing his morning bowel program. Since participating in the study, he is ab le to void 50 to 75% of the 
bladder volume while doing his bowel program (estimated by [CONTACT_743304]). This particular finding, in add ition to information regarding Viagra usage ch anges 
described abo ve for the T4 AIS A subject, emphasizes the need for an interview compon ent in this study, 
which will also provide us eful data for testing new hypotheses in animal models (bedside to bench, then 
translation back to bedside).

Version 2:  02/09/2017   Page 11 of 15 3. Specific Metho ds. 
 
a. Interventions (Those provided only as part of this study) . 
 
 
Non-weight bearing exercise: 80 se ssions of arm crank (RT300 cycle) will occur at the same intensity and 
duration (60 minutes) as the weight -bearing  interventions. Individuals will be s itting in their wheelchair 
propelling an arm c rank at similar velocities to the steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (35-55 rpm) using motor driven ass istance when 
needed (only for those with cervical injuries whose arm function has been impaired). Resistance will be 
continuously increased o ver the course of the training sessions as the individuals are able to propel the arm 
crank continuously for an hour.  
 
For non -weight bearing training , research participants  may also include those  receiving 80 one-hour sessions 
of UE-NMES which consists of e lectrical stimulation applied via the XCite system (Restorative Therapie s, Inc  
(RTI), Baltimore, MD), a portable, digital, dual channel, interferential device . Bifurcated leads and self -adhesive 
reusable surface electrodes  (PALS® Platinum Neurostimulation Electrodes (Restorative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc) ) will 
be placed over the bilateral arm  and upper trunk muscles  during the training sessions , while the research 
participant  is seated in his/her wheelchair or on a mat .  
 
Stand Training (weight bearing without steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]):  Approximately 80 sessions of standing uses  body weight 
support for 60 minutes each session and suspe nsion may be pr ovided by a harness and lift at the minimum 
support at which limb buckling and trunk collapse can  be avoided 115 or research  participants may use the 
custom designed standing apparatus , comprised of horizontal bars anterior and lateral to the individual. These 
bars will be used for upper extremity support and balance assistance as needed. Bungee cords will be placed 
across the upper tibias and hips for dynamic support.  The  research  participant will begin the sitting -to-
standing transition by [CONTACT_743305]; trainers 
positioned at the trunk, pelvis and knees will manually assist as needed during this transition. In case the 
upper limbs and trunk control  is insufficient for safely using the standing apparatus,  research  participants will 
be placed on the treadmill, and a body weight support system with a harness will be used to avoid trunk 
collapse and knee buckling. In this cas e, the level of body weight support will be continuously reduced over 
the course of the training sessions as the individuals increase their ability to bear weight on the lower limbs. A 
trainer positioned behind the research participant will aid in pelvis a nd trunk stabilization; the trainer will 
ensure that the trunk and pelvis are not flexed or hyper -extended during standing. Trainer(s) positioned at the 
lower limb will provide manual facilitation using a customized technique developed by [CONTACT_743306] m that 
facilitates knee extension during standing. Trainer(s) promote knee extension by [CONTACT_743307]. Manual facilitation at the trunk -pelvis and at the legs 
will be used only when  needed. Research p articipants will undergo 80 sessions of stand trainin g (1 hour,  4-5 
sessions per week) and will be encouraged to stand for as long as possible throughout the training session, 
with the goal to stand for [ADDRESS_1016050] amount o f assistance. Seated resting periods will occur 
when requested by [CONTACT_150514] . 
 
b. Procedures. 
A voiding diary with frequency/volume of e ach void and/or cat heterization will be generated for two 
consecutive [ADDRESS_1016051] voiding diaries. The number of voids, voided 
volume,  and distribution between daytime and n ight-time will be o btained. In addition, urine samples will be 
tested  once a week for the presence  of blood, urobilinogen, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, protein, nitrites, 
leukocytes, pH, and specific gravity using DiaScreen reagent strips for urinalysis. Vasopressin levels also will be 
tested from the urine samples using the Arginine Vasopressin ELISA  kit (Cayman Chemical).

Urodynamics: You may be asked to refrain from taking any bladder medications 24 -hours prior to 
Urodynamics. Urodynamic study will include an initial measurement of the urinary flow (uroflow: voided volume, 
maximum flow rate, time to maximum flow rate and total voiding time). This will be followed by [CONTACT_743308] (measuring bladder press ure during filling, possible uninhibited bladder contraction and maximum 
cystometric capacity), with determination of the leak point pressure and postvoid residual volume when voiding is 
possible at the end of the study when a second uroflow can be o btained. A [ADDRESS_1016052] will be as ked to cough to verify intra- abdominal cath eter 
position, and will be instructed to communicate when s/he first feels a full bladder (first sensation); when s/he first 
feels the desire to urinate (first urge to void); and when s/he can no longer wait to void (maximum capacity). The 
volume of water and bladder pressure will be recorded. Uninhibited bladder contractions will be identified. Next, 
the individual will be as ked to empty their bladder and voiding bladder pressures  recorded. The Urodynamic 
equipment, and with a rectal balloon catheter in place, may also record pressure measurements of  the anal 
sphincter muscles, the sensation in the rectum,  and activity of  the reflex pathways that  are needed for  normal 
bowel movements.  
During the time when cystometry evaluation is being done, EMG surface patch electrodes will be placed on  
the skin at 3 and 9 o'clock on either side of the urethra in order to record the urethral sphincter acti vity. This will 
evaluate coordination of the ure thra and anal sp hincters during the voiding phase a nd during possible 
uninhibited contraction epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. Detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia will be e valuated and classified according to 
the Blaivas classification into: type 
1 DSD characterized by a crescendo increase of the sphincter activity that reaches its maximum at the peak of 
the detrusor contraction (as the detrusor pressure begins to decline, sudden complete external  sphincter 
relaxation occu rs); type 2 DSD characterized by [CONTACT_743309] (these patients usually void with an interrupted spurting 
stream); type 3 DSD, characterized by [CONTACT_743310] (these patients void with an obstructive stream or cannot void at all) 117, 118. EMG 
electrodes may also be  placed during cystometry on the medial hamstrings, vastus  lateralis, soleus and tibialis 
anterior muscles. EMG amplitudes, durations and co-activation will be ca lculated during filling and voiding 
phases of the pressure-flow study.  Detailed methods have been p ublished.  
After urodynamic testing, the skin of the participant will be inspected and ensured that all areas exposed during 
the experiment are dry.  Blood pressure (BP) parameters may be monitored throughout urodynamic testing using 
either the Dinamap Carescape V100 (GE Healthcare) or continuous arterial BP acquired from a finger cuff placed 
around the left middle finger, index finger, or thumb (Portapres -2;Finapres MedicalSystems). Beat -to-beat 
systolic and diastolic recordings will be calculated from acquir ed contin uous BP measurements. Overall, 
urodynamic assessments should last approximately 1.5 to 2 hours .  
Urinary Biomarkers: Urine samp les will be o btained using a sterile 12 French straight catheter that is inserted 
through the urethra into the bladder for cystometry. The bladder is always emptied prior to filling for cystometry 
recordings, so once the volume is measured, urine samp les will be p laced in s terile storage vials and stored at 
4C for less than 3 hours.  Procedures will follow similar methods established and used  by [CONTACT_743311] 101, 104, 119.  Briefly, samp les will be centrifuged (3,000 rpm for 10 minutes) and 1 ml supernatant 
aliquoted into 1.5 ml tubes, with some used to determine creatine concentration. Aliquots will be frozen at -80C for 
later processing. Urinary NGF and B DNF concentrations will then be determined on the thawed samp les

Recovery  of Bladder and Sexual Function after  Human SCI  
 
 
 
Version 2:  02/09/[ADDRESS_1016053] curve and  normalized 
to the concentration of urinary creatine (NGF/Cr, BDN F/Cr). All samp les will be run in triplicate a nd the values 
averaged. 
 
Bladder biopsies: Bladder biopsies are an optional procedure. If conducted, [CONTACT_743313]  will perform bladder 
biopsies using standard proced ures at the University of Louisville Uro logy clinic. A random bladder biopsy will 
be obtained during cystoscopy, in order to capture the epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], basement membrane, up to the superficial 
layers of the detrusor muscle. The sample will be o btained in standard surgical sterile technique under local 
anesthesia. All layers of the bladder wall with exception of the outer serosa sh ould be represented in the biopsy 
specimen (Figure 7). During this proced ure, a 16 French Olympus Flexible Cystoscope (a lighted instrument 
used to look at  the bladder) is passed through the urethra into the bladder, which may cause a feeling of slight 
discomfort. The bladder will be filled with normal saline through the cystoscope, producing an uncomfortable 
sensation, similar to a strong urge to 
urinate. A biopsy forceps grasper is then inserted through the cystoscope working ch annel into the bladder and a 
very small amou nt of bladder tissue  is excised. The forceps cup h as a 2 mm outer diameter but the cup itself has 
a 5 mm diameter. Participants may feel a pi[INVESTIGATOR_743280]. Depending on the amount of pressure applied 
with this size forceps cup, a single full 1 cm biopsy sample can  be obtained (i.e., plenty of tissue n eeded for 
assessments). Next, the affected blood vessels are cauterized in order to seal them and stop bleeding within the 
bladder wall, through a Bugbee electrode placed through the cystoscope. This may induce 
a burning sensation. 
After the cystoscope is removed, the participant’s urethra may be sore and they may report a burning 
sensation during uri nation for 1-2 days following the proced ure. Viscous Lidocane will be a pplied through the 
urethra in attempt to damper this sensation. Samples will be immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for later 
analyses cond ucted by [CONTACT_8362]. To assay bladder biopsies for NGF and BDNF, frozen 
bladder will be h omogenized and protein extracted using a l ysis buffer, and subs equently run in duplicates 
(triplicates  if tissue  samples ade quate) in 96-well plate antibody-sandwich ELISA  with internal  standard per 
manufacturer (Emax® ImmunoAssay System, Promega, Madision WI, [LOCATION_003]). This procedure should last 
approximately 1 hour.

EMG activity during steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: All methods have been pub lished previously 47, 51.  In brief, EMG and kinematics 
may be acquired during steppi[INVESTIGATOR_743281] (0.27, 0.45, 0.89, 1.34 m/s) us ing the maximum b ody weight load 
at which knee-buckling and trunk collapse can be avoided. Manual facilitation will be pro vided only if needed.

Detailed methods have been p ublished previously. This assess ment should last approximately 2 -3 hours. 
 
 
Measures  of Erectile Function: The full International Index of Erectile Func tion (IIEF) questionnaire is readily 
available in many publications 108. It has been validated in 32 languages and can be  used cross-culturally 121. 
Briefly, there are 15 questions that can be  divided into 5 unique domains: erectile function, intercourse 
satisfaction, orgasmic function, sexual desire, and overall satisfaction 108. The Erection Hardness  Grading Scale 
(Grades 1-4) is defined as follows: increase  in size of penis but no hardness  (rigidity)as Grade 1; increase in 
size and sl ight increase in h ardness (rigidity), but insufficient for sexual intercourse as Grade 2; increase in 
hardness (rigidity) sufficient for sexual intercourse but not fully hard (rigid) as Grade 3; fully hard (rigid) as 
Grade [ADDRESS_1016054] Injury Data Set  
questionnaires for  bowel, bladder and sexual function (male and female) also will be incorporated to  assess 
management and dysfunction of  these systems.  These questionnaires should take approximately 10-20 
minutes to complete.  
 
4. Statistical Analysis Plan. Many of the analyses involve paired comparisons of pre-training measurements 
(voiding frequency, bladder capacity, NGF levels, etc.) with mid- and/or  post-training measurements (LT, stand, 
non-weight bearing training ). We will evaluate the null hypotheses of no improvement due to training with paired 
t-tests. Standard 
F-tests will be co nducted to detect variance h eterogeneity, and Welch’s correction subsequently applied as 
needed. The Wilcoxon signed rank test will be us ed in p lace of the t-test should the normality assumption be 
violated.  Hypothesis 1C suggests an association between urodynamic parameters and EMG activity during 
steppi[INVESTIGATOR_743283]. This hypothesis will be e valuated by a nonparametric correlation ana lysis (e.g. Spearman, 
Kendall correlations) comparing pre- to mid- and/or  post-training changes in urodynamic parameters to EMG 
activity post- training. Power estimations using EMG co-activation data from previous human locomotor training 
studies indicate that a sample size of 10 p er group would ach ieve a significant difference  at the 0.05 level 
between the groups with a power of 80%. 
 
Hypotheses 3A-3D are specific to Group 2 (LT + epi[INVESTIGATOR_429473]) and each involves co mparing the 
change in outcome  variables over 80 LT sessions to changes over 80 stand + epi[INVESTIGATOR_743284] 80 LT + epi[INVESTIGATOR_743285]. We will use p aired t-tests to compare  the improvement over 80 
sessions of LT to the improvement  over 80 se ssions of stand + epi[INVESTIGATOR_429473], and like-wise for 80 
sessions of stand + epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] s timulation to the improvement  over 80 sessions of LT + epi[INVESTIGATOR_429473]. 
Comparisons of the changes in outcome variables over 80 sessions of training with cardiovascular plus 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_429473] (CV, VM, and stand) may also be performed. Welch’s correction and the Wilcoxon signed 
rank test will be a pplied as descri bed above. 
Descri ptive statistics for each ou tcome will be ca lculated for each study group at each assessment. In 
particular, we will generate mean and  standard error estim ates for each outcome  variable pre-training, post- 
training, and for the pre-post training difference, so that these quantities can be us ed in planning future research.  
All hypothesis tests will be co nducted at the .05 level. It is possible that results derived from Specific Aim 3 (study 
of LT + epi[INVESTIGATOR_429473]) may understate the effect of LT + epi[INVESTIGATOR_429473], as the effect 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_743286] o ver the initial 80 
sessions of LT received.

Version 2:  02/09/[ADDRESS_1016055] sho wn neural ch anges in individuals’ even 
decades after clinically comp lete SCI [ADDRESS_1016056] can 
also serve as their own con trol (in addition to quantification of group trends). There may exist a h igh variability in 
the magnitude of outcome s. However, if a significant number of individuals recover even some  bladder function it 
would have a tremendous impact on their quality of life and potentially reduce infections and longer term bladder 
complications. 
 
6. Data Safety and Monitoring Plan  
 An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been chartered to monitor the safety of 
research participants as well as the data validity and integrity of studies conducted at the Kentucky Spi[INVESTIGATOR_743287], University of Louisvill e and the Frazier Rehab Institute. Members of the DSMB serve in 
an individual capacity and will convene yearly to provide their expertise including recommendations regarding the 
continuation, modification, or termination of any or all phases of this study.  The DSMB will review cumulative 
study data to evaluate safety, study conduct, scientific validity and data integrity. DSMB members may review 
current versions of the protocol and Informed Consent Form, and any subsequent amendments to ensure an 
understand ing of a study’s objectives and design. Day -to-day oversight of the study will be provided by [CONTACT_131254]. They will review all study data and any adverse events, and report all adverse events to 
the University of Louisville IRB, DSMB chair person and sponsor as appropriate. Medical events that occur while 
the research participants are engaged in the research protocols also will be logged by a research nurse, physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], physicians and/or staff. Any adverse events (AE) are collected on an Adverse Event Form and will be 
reported at the yearly DSMB meeting. An AE report will be generated for each event and will include a description 
of the event, when and how it was reported, as well as any official chart records or documentation to cor roborate 
the event and a determination of attribution. Any AE that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_429574], probably, or possibly 
related to the research intervention, or serious in nature, and unexpected will be reported to the IRB and sponsor 
as appropriate, within 5 business days of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_429575]. Any unanticipated problems 
involving risks to research participants or others will include a corrective plan and measures to prevent 
reoccurrence. Such events will be reported to appropriate regulatory agencies as required within 5 business days 
of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_429575].

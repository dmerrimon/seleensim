4.STUDY DESIGN AND  RATIONALE  
4.1. Description of Study Design  
The clinical study is a single -ARM, single -masked, clini cal trial. The mask will be a partial 
mask in that the lenses will be over -labeled and the specific brand of the contact [CONTACT_906197] t however the subject will be aware of the photochromic prop erties 
of the contact [CONTACT_13293]. There is one stu dy treatment with two wearing cycles. A total of 
approximately [ADDRESS_1272406] wearing cycle will be dispensed for 12±2 days and at th e follow -up the final lens 
measurem ents will occur. Subjects will complete a 7±[ADDRESS_1272407] lens studies.  A washout 
period and lens re-dispensing was used to evaluate the reproducibility and repeatability of the 
subjective vis ion respon se.
4.3. Enrollment Target and Study Duration  
A total of 80 subjects (48 myopes and 32 Hyperopes) are targete d to complete the study. 
The study will last approximately [ADDRESS_1272408] Article Allocation  
The stu dy lenses w ill be worn in a bilateral fashion using a single -arm design with 1 lens 
type and 2 wearing cycles.
5.2. Masking  
This is a single -masked study with the sub jects being masked.  The lenses from different 
wearing cycle s will be over -labeled using differ ent letters so that the subjects don’t know for 
sure the lenses are identical. 
Under normal circumstances, the mask should not be broken until  all subjects hav e
completed the study and the datab ase is finalized.  Otherw ise, the mask should be broken 
only if specifi c emergency treatment/course of action would be dictated by [CONTACT_823681].  In such cases, the Investigat or may, in an e mergency, contact 
[CONTACT_7195].  In the event the mas k is broken, the Sponsor must be in formed as s oon 
as possible.  The date, time, and reason for the unmasking must  be documented in the subject 
record.  The Investigator is also advised not to reve al the study treatment assignment to the 
clinical site or Sp onsor personnel. 
Subjects who hav ehad their treatment assignment unmasked are expected to return for all 
remaining scheduled evaluations.  Subjects who are discontinued  may be replaced.
5.3. Procedu res for Maintaining and Breaking the Masking  
The test articl es mask shall not be broken unless information concerning the lens type is 
necessary for the urgent medical treatment of a subject.  The S ponsor must be notified before 
the mask is broken.
When d ispensing test articles, the following steps should be follo wed to maintain 
randomization codes :
1.Investiga tor or designee (documented on the Delegation Log) will consult the lens 
fitting schedule/randomization scheme to obtain the test articl e assignment f or that 
subject prior to dispensing
2.Investigator or designee will record the subject’s number o nthe appro priate line of 
the randomization scheme if applicable .
3.Investigator or designee will pull the appropriate test article s from the study supply.  
All te st articles that are opened, whether dispensed (placed/fit o n eye or dispensed 
outside the clin ical site) or not, must be recorded on the Test Article Accountability 
Log in the “Dispensed” section .
CR-[ADDRESS_1272409] article associated with an Adve rse Events and/or a Product 
Quality Complaint must be retaine d and stored in a glass vial with m oderate solution pe nding
directions from the sponsor for potential return to JJV.
6.7. Accountability of Test Articles  
JJV will provide the Investigator with sufficie nt quantities of study article and supplies to 
complete the investigation.  The Investigator is asked to retain al l lens shipment 
documentation for the test article accountability records. 
Test article must be kept in a locked storage cabinet, accessib leonly to those assigned by [CONTACT_35500]. The Investigator may delegate this activity to author ized study 
site personnel listed on the Site Delegation Log.  All test art icles must be accounted.  This 
includes:
1.What was dispensed for the subject for trial fitting, to wear out of the office, or iss ued 
for the subject to replace appr opriately between v isits 
2.What was returned to the Investigator unused
3.The number and reason for unplanned replacements  
The Investigator will collect all unus ed test articles from the subjects at the end of the 
subject ’s participation. Subject returned unused test articl es must be separated from the 
clinical study inventory of un -dispensed test articles and must be labeled with the subject 
number and date of r eturn.  Following final reconciliation of test articles by t he monitor, the 
Investigator or mon itor will return al l unused test articles to the Sponsor.
If there is a discrepancy between the shipment documents and th e contents, contact [CONTACT_35501] .

Once a complaint is received, it will be assessed by [CONTACT_19569], C RA, or trained site personnel 
to determine if it is an Adverse Event/Seri ous Adverse Event (AE/SAE).  If the complaint 
results in an AE/SAE, the COM/CRA, or trained site personn el will follow Section 13of this 
protocol. If the AE/SAE was potent ially the result of a product quality r elated deficiency, 
these procedures also applies a nd will be executed in parallel.   
In some cases, a P QC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_35514].  In this event, the 
PQC forms will be marked “Intentionally Left Blank” or “ILB”.  Justification f or ILB must 
be documented.
13.ADVERSE EVENTS  
13.1. Definitions and Classifications  
Adverse Event (AE) –An AE is “any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal la boratory findings) in subjects, users 
orother persons, whether or not re lated to the investigational me dical device. 
Note 1 to entry: This de finition includes events related to the investigational medical  device 
or the comparator.
Note 2 to entry: This d efinition includes events related to th eprocedures involved.
Note 3 to entry: For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to ev ents related to 
investigational medical devices .”1
An AE includes any con dition (including a pre -existing condit ion) that:
1.Was not present prior to the study, but appeared or reappeared following initiation of 
the st udy 
2.Was present prior to the study but worsened during the study. T his would include any 
condition resulting fro m co ncomitant illnesses, reactions to c oncomitant medications, 
or progression of disease states 
3.Pregnancy must be documented as an adverse eve nt and must be reported to the 
clinical monitor and to the Sponsor immediately upon learning o f the event
Seriou s Adverse Event (SAE) –An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:
xResults in death
xIs life threatening
xRequires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_906188]/incapacity (e.g ., a sight threatening 
event, a significan tpersistent or permanent change, impairment, damage, or 
disruption to the subject’s body)
xIs a congenit al anomaly/birth defect
xRequires intervention to prevent p ermanent damage (the use of t he test article 
resulting i n acondition which requires medical o rsurgical intervention to preclude 
permanent impairment of the body structure or a body function).   Imp ortant medical 
events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_906189], based upon appropriat emedical judgment, they may 
CR-[ADDRESS_1272435] and may require medical or su rgical inter vention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition
Diagnoses and conditions that are considere d Ocular Serious Adverse Events includ e, but not 
limited to:
xMicrobial Keratitis (MK)
xIritis (including cells in the anterior chamber)

Non-Significant Adverse Events –Those conditions that are usually asymptomatic and 
usually do not war rant discontinuation (temporary or per manent) of the test article.  
However, the Investigator may choose to treat as a precautionar y measure. 
Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Ocular Non -Significant Adverse Events 
include, but not limited to thefollowing:
xNon-significant Infiltr ative Event (NSIE)

which necessitates temporary lens discontinuation <[ADDRESS_1272438] (ADE) –An ADE is an “adverse ev ent related to the use of an 
investigational medical device.
Note 1 to entry: This definition incl udes adverse events resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implanta tion, installation, or operation, or any 
malfunction of the investigational medical device.
Note 2 to entry: This definition includes any event resultin gfrom use error or from 
intentional misuse of the invest igational medical device.”[ADDRESS_1272439] (UADE) –Any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety orany life -threatening problem or dea th caused by, or associated with, the test article, 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan, Investigator’s Brochure or pr otocol, or any other 
unanticipated ser ious problem associated with the test article that relates to the rights, safety 
and welfare of subjects .
13.2. Assessing Adverse Events  
In conjunction with the medical monitor, the Investigator will evaluate adverse events to 
ensure the events are categorized c orrectly.  Elements of categorization will include:
xSeriousness/Classifications (see definition in Secti on13.1)
xCausality or Relatedness –i.e. the relationship between the test article, study 
treatment or stud yprocedures and the adverse event (not related; unlikely related ; 
possibly related; related -see defin ition in Section 13.2.1 )
xAdverse Event Severity –Adverse event sever ityis used to assess the degree of 
intensity of the adverse event (mild; moderate; severe for all eve nts -see definition in 
Section 13.2.2 )
xOutcome –not recovered or not resolved; recovering or resolving; recover ed or 
resol ved with sequelae; recovered or resolv ed; death related to adverse event; 
unknown
xActions Taken –none; temporarily discontinued; permanently discontinued; other .
13.2.1. Causality Assessment  
Causality Assessment –A determination of the relationship between an ad verse event and 
the test article. The test article relationship for each adverse event should be determined by 
[CONTACT_906199]:
xNot Related -An adverse event that is not related to the use of the test art icle, study 
treatment or s tudy procedures
xUnlikely Related –Anadverse event for which an alternative explanation is more 
likely, e.g. concomitant treatment, concomita nt disease(s), or the relationship of time 
suggests that a causal relationship is not likely
CR-6349 v5.0  
Page 49 of 196JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
xPossibly Related –Anadverse event that might be due to th euse of the test article, or 
to the study treatment or study procedures. An alternative explanation, e .g. 
concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive.   The relationship in 
time is reasonable.  Ther efore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded
xRelated –An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse effect (d evice) or 
adverse r eaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_906200], e.g. concomitant treatment of con comitant disease(s).  The relationship
in time is very suggestive, e.g. it is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328] -challenge and re -challenge.
13.2.2. Severity Assessment  
Severity Assessment –A qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an adver se 
event as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her b ythe subject.  The 
assessment of severity is made irrespective of test article, st udy treatment or stud y procedure 
relationship or seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following 
scale:
xMild–Event is noticeable to the subject ,but is easily tolerated and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities
xModerate –Event is bothersome, possible requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities
xSevere –Event is intolerable, necessitates ad ditional therapy or alteration of therapy 
and interferes with the subject’s daily activities.
13.3. Documentat ion and Follow -Up of Adverse Events  
The recording and documenting of adverse events (ocular and non -ocular) begins when the 
subjects are exposed to the test article, study treatment or study procedure.  Adverse event s 
reported before the use of test articl e, start of study treatment, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if the condition d eteriorates at any time during the 
study it will be recorded and reported as an AE. Untoward medical events reported after the 
subject’s exit from the study will be recorded as adverse events at the discretion of the 
Investigator.
Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_906191]. He/she will complete the Adverse Event /eCRF.  
Complete descriptions of all adverse events must be available in the subject record. All
Adverse Event s including local and systemic reactio ns not meeting the criteria for “serious 
adverse events” shall be captured on the appropriate case repor t form or electronic data 
system. All adverse events occurring while the subject is enrolled in t h e  s t u d y  m u s t  b e
documented appropriately regardless o frelationship.  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to maintain documentati on of each reported ad verse 
event. All adverse events will be followed in accordance with applicab le licensing 
requirements.  Such docu mentation will include the following:
xAdverse event (diagnosis not symptom)
CR-6349 v5.0  
Page 50 of 196JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
xDrawings or photographs (where appropriate) that detail the fin ding (e.g., size, 
location, and depth, etc.) 
xDate the clinical site was notified 
xDate and time of onset
xDate and ti meof resolution
xAdverse event classif ication, severity, and relationship to test articles, as applica ble
xTreatment regimen instituted, includ ing concomitant medications prescribed, in 
accordance with applicable licensing requirements
xAny referral to anoth er health care provider if needed
xOutc ome, ocular damage (if any)
xLikely etiology
xBest corrected visual acuity at the discovery of the event a nd upon conclusion of the 
event
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he/she will comple te the Corneal Inf iltrate 
Assessment eCRF.  Where necess ary, a culture of the corneal lesion will be collected to 
determine if the infection is microbial in nat ure.  If cultures are collected, the date of culture 
collection and laboratory utilized will be recorded. 
Change s in the severity of an AE shall be do cumented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of the onset and duration of  each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Changes in the 
assessment of relationsh ip to the test article shall also be clearly documented.
Subjects who present with an adverse event sha ll be followed by [CONTACT_737], within 
licensure, until all signs and symptoms have returned to pre -treatment status, stabilized, or 
been satisfacto rily resolved.  If further treatment beyond licensure is require d, the patient will 
be referred to the a ppropriate health care provider.  The Investigator will use his /her clinical 
judgment as to whether a subject repo rting with an adverse event will conti nue in the study.  
If a subject is discontinued from the study, it will be the res ponsibility of the Inv estigator to 
record the reason for discontinuation.  The Investigator will a lso document the adverse event 
appropr iately and complete the Adverse Event eCRF. Any subjects with ongoing adverse 
events related to the test article, study treatment or study pr ocedures, as of the final study 
visit date, should be followed to resolution of the adverse eve nt or until referra l to an 
appropriate health care provid er, as recommended by [CONTACT_737]. Non-ocular adverse 
events that are not related to the test arti cle, study treatment, or study procedures may be 
recorded as “ongoing” without further follow -up.
13.4. Reporting Advers e Events  
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an adverse event by e -mail, facsimile, or 
telephone as soon as possible and no later tha n 24 hours from discovery for any serious 
/significant adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for any non-signi ficant adverse event.  
In addition, a written report will be submitted by [CONTACT_079] t o the IEC/IRB 
according to their require ments (Section 13.4.2 ).  The report will comment whether the 
adverse event was considered to be related to the test article, study treatment or study 
procedures.
CR-6349 v5.0  
Page 51 of 196JJVC CONFIDENTIAL
13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor  
Serious/Signi ficant Adverse Events
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of all serious/signifi cant adverse events occurring
during the study period as soon as po ssible by e -mail, fax, or telephone, but no later than 24 
hours following discovery of the event.  The I nvestigator is obligated to pursue and obtain 
information requested by [CONTACT_906201]. 
All subjects ex periencing a serious/significant adverse event must be followed up and all 
outcomes must be reported.
When medically necessary, the Investigator may break the randomi zation code to determine 
the identity of the treatm entthat the subject received.  The Sp onsor and study monitor should 
be notified prior to unmasking the test articles.
In the event of a seri ous/significant adverse event, the Investigator must:
xNotify the Sponsor immediately
xObtain and maintain in the su bject’s records all pertinent medical information and 
medical judgment for colleagues who assisted in the treatment a nd follow -up of the 
subje ct
xProvide the Sponsor with a complete case history which includes  a statement as to 
whether the event was or was notrelated to the use of the test art icle
xNotify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB reporting procedu re according to 
national regulations
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE)
In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device E ffect (UADE), the Investigator 
will su bmit a report of the UADE to the Sponsor and IEC/IRB as soon as possible, but no 
later than [ADDRESS_1272440] report the results of the 
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB and participati ng Investigators within [ADDRESS_1272441].
Non-Serious Adverse Events
All non -serious adverse events, including non -serious adverse device effects, will be reported 
to the sponsor by [CONTACT_19580] 2 days from discovery.
13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to the Responsible IEC/IRB and Health Authorities  
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requirements for reporting must be reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set 
forth by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site will refer  to and follow any guidelines 
set forth by [CONTACT_906202].
The Sponsor will report applicable Adverse Events to the local health authorities according 
the written guidelines, including reporting timelines. 
CR-[ADDRESS_1272442]  
None.
13.5. Reporting of Pregnancy  
Subjects re porting pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270] -report) during the study will be discontinued after the 
event is recorded as an Adverse Event.  Once discontinued, pregnant participants and  their 
fetuses will not be monitored for study relat edpurposes.  At the Investigator’s d iscretion, the 
study participant may be followed by [CONTACT_171191] d elivery. However, this dat a
will not be collected as part of the clinical study database.  Pregnant participants are not 
discontinued from co ntact lens or solution related studie sfor safety concerns, but due to 
general concerns relating to pregnancy and contact [CONTACT_19584].  Specific ally, pregnant women 
are discontinued due to fluctuations in refractive error and/or  visual acuity that occur 
secon dary to systemic hormonal changes, an dnot due to unforeseen health risks to the 
mother or fetus.

All data summaries and statistical analyses will be performed u sing the Statistical Analysis 
System (SAS) software Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) .Throughout the analysis of 
data, the results for each subject/eye will be used when availa ble for sum marization and 
statistical analysis.  Unscheduled visits will be summarized se parately and will be excluded 
from th estatistical analysis.
Summary tabl es (Descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will be prov ided for all 
baseline variables, efficac y variables and safety variables as appropriate. Continuous 
variables will be summarized with descriptive statistic s(n, mean, standard deviation [SD], 
median, minimum and maximum). Frequency count and percentage of subjects or eyes 
within each category w ill be provided for categorical data.
Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_906203] (Safety Popu lation or Per -Protocol Population). All analyses will be 
conducted on per -protocol population (see Sect ion 14.3).
14.2. Sample Size Justification  
A total of 80subjects ( 48myopes and 32hyperopes ) are targeted to complete the study .
Using the POWER procedure in SAS 9.4, below is the summary of sample size required 
based on the different assumptions of the true LogMAR vi sual acuity and CLUE scores . The 
sample size was calculated for the non -inferi ority tests (using 0.05 as the margin) with at 
least 90% of statistical power and 2 -sided type I error of 0.05. Assuming the true L ogMAR 
visual acuity is between 0.00 to 0.05 (di stance) or 0.08 to 0.12 (near), and true CLUE vision 
score is between 38 to 42 points .

14.3. Analysis Popu lations  
Safety Population:
All subjects who were administered any test article excluding s ubjects who dr op out prior to 
administering any test article. At least one observation should be recorded.
Per-Protocol Populatio n: 
All subjects who have successfu lly completed all visits and did not substantially deviate from 
the protocol as determined by [CONTACT_35524] 
(Per-Protocol Population).  Justification of excluding subjects w ith protocol deviations in the 
Per-Protocol Population set will be documented in a memo to file.
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population:
All sub jects regardless of actual treatment and subsequent withdrawal from study or 
deviation from protocol.  At least one o bserv ation should be recorded.
14.4. Leve l of Statistical Significance  
All planned analysis for this study will be conducted with an o verall type I error rate of 5%. 
14.5. Primary Analysis  
Primary efficacy analysis:
CR-[ADDRESS_1272444] logMAR visual acuity will be analyzed using a 
linear mixed model. The model will include the experim ental design factors: distanc e
(distance/intermediate/near) and time point ( 2week or 4week) as fixed effect s; and s ite and 
subject nested in site as random effects . Oth er baseline characteristics known to be important 
such as age, gender, subject group (myope/hyperope), and/or ADD power will be included as 
fixed covariates when appropriate. The covariance between residual errors from the same 
subject at the same time poi ntacross distances will be selected based on the finite -sample 
corrected Akaike’s Inf ormation Criterion.6Covariance structures considered will include: 
Homogenous Compound Symmetry (CS) , Heterogeneous Co mpound Symmetry (CS H),and 
Unstructured covariance structure (UN).  The structure that returns the lowest Akaike 
Information Criteria Cor rected (AICC) will be selected as the structure that best fit t he data.
Heterogeneous models across study populations and/or distance w ill be considered using a 
log-likelihood ratio test.  
Comparisons will be carried out using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) constructed of Least -
square means ( LSM )from the linear mixed models.  Statistical superiority will be concluded 
if the upper limit of the confidence intervals of th eTest lens is below +0.10logMAR for 
distance, and below +0.17 logMAR for intermediat eand near .
CLUE Vision
Overall quality of vision scores will be analyzed using a linea r mixed model adjusting for 
baseline values as fixed covariates. The model will in clude the experimental design factors: 
time point (2 week or 4 w eek) as thefixed effect ;and s ite and subject nested in site as 
random effects .Other baseline characteristics known to be important such as ag e, gender, 
subject group (myope/hyp erope), and/ orADD power will be included as fixed covariates 
when appropriate .The covariance between residual errors from the same subject ac ross lens 
wearing periods/time point will be selected based on the finite -sample corrected Akaike’s 
Information C riterion .6Covariance structures considered may include: Homogenous 
compound symmetry (CS) and Unstructured covariance structure (U N). The structure that 
returns the lowest Akaike Information Criteria Correct ed (AICC) will be selected as the 
structure that best fit the data. 
Primary Hypothesis:
Comparisons will be carried out us ing 95% confidence intervals constructed of least -square
means (LSM) from the linear mixed models of CLUE vision scores at the end of first 
wearin g cycle (2 week) . Statisticall y superiority will be concluded if the lower limit of the 
confidence intervals of the test lens are greater than 32 points.
Secondary Hypothesis:
Comparisons between the wearing cycles (2week vs4week) will be carried out u sing 95% 
confidence intervals constructed of least -square means (LSM) differences ( 4 week –2 week )
from the linear mixed model. The superiority will be establishe d if the lower confidence limit 
is above 0.
CR-[ADDRESS_1272445] and Roger method7will be used for the calculation of the 
denominator of degrees of freedom.
14.6. Secondary Analysis  
Secondary e fficacy analysis:
See section 14.[ADDRESS_1272446] clinical trials do n’t provide the evidence that subje ct dropout is systematic or not -at-
random. To evaluate the impact of missing data, sensitivity analysis will be conducted using 
multiple imputation methods if the propor tion of subject dropout is greater than the 15%. 
The SAS/STAT procedures PROC MI and PROC MIANALYZE will be utilized with a 
parametric regression method used to m ake at least [ADDRESS_1272447] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]/AR CHIVING  
15.1. Electro nic Case Report Form/Data Collection  
The data for this study will be captured on electronic case report forms (eCRFs) using an 
EDC system (Bioclinica). An authorized dat a originator will enter study data into the eCRFs 
using the EDC system. Data collecte don equipment that is not captured in EDC will be

APPENDIX G: AST SENT IO CONTRAST SENSITIV ITY TESTING  
Work Aid: AST Sentio Contrast Sensitiv ity Testing
OBJECTIVE  
To provide i nstructions for capturing contrast sensitivity data using the AS T Sentio Pro 
Instrument.
DESCRIPTION  
The AST Sentio is a vision testing system that consists of a mon itor, internal computer, 
custom software, and remote c ontrol for registering user respons es. The display, computer, 
and software are contained in one unit; the remote is separate.  During testin g, the monitor 
will show test patterns of varying sizes and contras ts. The particular pattern that is displayed 
durin g the test is determined by [CONTACT_906210]. During a test session, [ADDRESS_1272459] the patient’s responses using the 
remote.  After a t est session is complete, the custom software will calculate the following.
Area unde rthe log contrast sensitivity function from 1.[ADDRESS_1272460] Sentio Pro Monitor display with internal computer (see F igure 1).
AST Sentio Remote (see Figure 1).
Figure 1: AST Sentio Pro Monitor (main unit) and Remote. The monitor has a USB port for 
data export. To start the remote, press t he On/O button once. When the remote is on, to put 
the device into a hold mode, press the On/O button. The remote has a micro -USB port for 
charging.
 
SETUP 
CR-[ADDRESS_1272461] is positioned at the proper viewing distance (4 mete rs). 
Ensure the subject’s eyes, in primary gaze, are at 130 cm ± [ADDRESS_1272462]’s  field of view.
Instruct the subject as follows.
Inform the subject that they will be presented with let ters of different sizes and contrast 
(faintness) o n the monitor. These letters may no thave a familiar appearance; they may be 
modified for testing purposes. 
Inform the subject that they w ill be shown a short demonstration to familiarize them with the  
letters and procedure.
Inform the subject that they w ill encounter letters that they wil lnot be able to identify or see 
and this is not an indication of poor visual performance. The p urpose o f the test is to find the 
limits of visual performance.
Inform the subject that if the subject is unsure about a lett er, they should still respond. If t his
happens during the test, encourage the subject to respond.
Start the system by [CONTACT_906211]/O bu tton on the remote. The two screens in Figure 3 
should be visible ( one following the other).
Figure 3: After press ing the On/O button the system will power up and the Sentio remote will 
connect to the computer software. The screen on the left will b e visible on the Sentio remote 
while the remote is attempting to connec t. After the connection is made, the screen (Main 
Screen) will appear on the Sentio r emote.
CR-[ADDRESS_1272463], pre ss the “>” button on the main screen. This will advance to the setup screen 
on the Sentio Remote (see Figure 5).
Figure 5: L eft image shows main scr een; right image shows setup screen
Using the setup screen on the Sentio Remote, enter the subject ID (see protocol governing 
test).
Choose the appropriate eye (OS or OS) or both eyes (OU). See protocol governing test.
Press the “>” button to start the te st.
When the test is started, the monitor will show three letters w ith decreasing (left to right) 
visib ility. The Sentio remote will show the correct identity of thes e letters. Be certain that the 
subject cannot see the Sentio remote screen.
Record the su bject response as either correct ( check mark ) or incorrect (X). See Figure 6. 
Encourage the subject to n ame a letter; however, if the subject will not name a letter, r ecord
“no answer”.
If the subject cannot see which let ter is under consideration, or any letter, the test 
administrator can highlight the area containing the letter by p ressing the prompt butto n (see 
Figure 6).
Press the “>” button to advance to the next trial . See Figure 6.

Press the “Finish Test” button on the top right of the results screen (see Figure 7). After this 
is done a dialog box will appear (see Figure 8).
Figure 8: dialog box tha t will appear after pressing the “Finish Test” button on the re sults
screen
To finish the test, press the “return to main” button in the dialog box (se eFigure 8).
To start a new test with the sa me subject, press the “Same” but ton (see Figure 8).
To start a new test with a new subject, pr ess the “New” button (see Figu re 8).
FOLLOWING A TEST
Exportation of Data
Press the “Return to Main” button. See 5.22.
All data are stored on the computer’s hard drive and exportatio n of data may occur at any 
time. To expo rt the data, insert a USB drive into the USB port on the front column of the 
cart.
At the main screen on the Sentio r emote, click the export data button .You will be prompted 
with a dialog box asking to enter a password (see Figure 9). Enter a password (se e protocol). 
After entering a password, press either “Export New”, which will export the last data set, or 
press “Ex port All”, which will export all su bject data. Two files will be exported: a PDF and 
a JAVA file; each contains the data shown on the resul ts screen.
Continue Testing
Press either the “Same” or “New” butto ns. See 5.23 and 5.24.
Power Down
To turn the dev ice off, press the On/O button on t he Sentio remote. The monitor will count 
down for 10 seconds before powering down. If you wish to stop t his, press the On/O button 
again; this will stop the device from po wering down.
The device will power down if left in active for some period of time. To restart the device, 
press the On/O button. Ongoing test results will be saved.
Do not unplug the device during testing; data for an ongoing test will not be saved.

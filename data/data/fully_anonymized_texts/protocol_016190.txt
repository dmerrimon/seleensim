[ADDRESS_107068] and the earlier use of therapy has yet to increase its effectiveness. These observations stress the need to develop new therapy strategies based on the improved 
understanding of the biology driving prostate cancer progression [1]. 
 
Clinically, prostate cancer is characterized by a predictable pattern of progression in the 
majority of patients. The disease progresses from the primary site to lymph nod es and then 
bone. Osseous metastases are the preferred area of castrate progression that inevitably follows 
the initial response to androgen ablation in patients with metastases.  
 
The mainstay of therapy for patients with prostate cancer metastases is andr ogen ablation. 
The vast majority of patients will initially benefit from a “response” and gratifying relief of 
symptoms. However, total disappearance of disease among patients presenting with  
metastases rarely occurs. Incurable castrate resistant progressi on occurs within three years in 
the vast majority of these patients. This stark reality prompted the study of chemotherapy  
upon castrate resistant progression. Prospective and properly powered randomized studies 
demonstrated meaningful palliation and subsequently a modest survival benefit. 
 
Thus, chemotherapy has been the only new approved treatment that prolongs the survival of 
patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_107069]–epi[INVESTIGATOR_97072] —blocking endothelin α receptor –mediated  
progression and blocking platelet- derived growth factor (PDGF)–mediated  
progression—resulted in modulation of bone- turnover markers without corresponding 
changes in the tumor.  We interpret this experience as suggesting that the available  
experimental models of prostate cancer bone metastases do not reflect the complexity of 
the human disease and the multiple pathways that are implicated in its progressi on [1].  
[ADDRESS_107070] implicated in prostate 
cancer progression. Thus it may be important to maximally deplete microenvironment androgens to avoid the potential resistance attributed to sustained androgen signaling as resulting from paracrine production or androgens. These observations led us to conclude that elucidating the clinical heterogeneity of prostate cancer bone metastases will lead to effective and personalized care for the patients with prostate cancer bone metastases [1].  
 
2.2 Paracrine androgen  signaling  
There is increasing evidence that “intracrine” (autocrine /paracrine) androgen signaling 
is implicated in the castrate resistant progression of prostate cancer. Furthermore  
persistent androgen sign aling may account for the limited effectiveness of blocking 
androgen independent stromal- epi[INVESTIGATOR_97073]. This reasoning leads us to speculate that there is a hierarchy of stromal – epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] /  
interacting pathways with androgen signaling as dominant. The line of reasoning leads 
to the hypothesis that efficient inhibition of “paracrine androgen signaling” will be a critical aspect of ration al combinatorial strategies targeting the tumor 
microenvironment.  
 
2.3 Rationale for  lead-in Abiraterone acetate  
Abiraterone acetate has demonstrated antitumor activity in well -characterized patients 
with progressive castrate resistant prostate cancer. The response rates range from 40% 
to 60% by [CONTACT_97106] (Attard JCO 2008, JCO 2009, Danila ASCO 2008). These 
data provide  confidence that further  suppression of androgens can be achieved  in 
patients with advanced castrate resistant prostate cancer. The expression of CYP 17 
androgen receptor and increased bone marrow concentration of androgens were 
preliminarily predictive of response to abiraterone (Efstathiou GU Cancers Symposium 
2009). These data support the hypotheses that resistance to castration results from 
increased expression of CYP 17, with “intracrine” production of androgens and 
increased androgen receptor expression. The initial suppression followed by [CONTACT_97107][INVESTIGATOR_97074].  
 
2.[ADDRESS_107071]. [2, 
3] We i nterpret this finding to suggest that blocking of PDGF alone is inadequate where 
as inhibition of VEGF and PDGF signaling is efficacious by [CONTACT_97108]. Furthermore, the data suggest sunitinib may be superior to chemotherapy. The lack of a high rate of “response” by [CONTACT_97109]. The addition of sunitinib to abiraterone will test the hypothesis that the combination of sunitinib and abiraterone acetate is safe and 
more effective than sunitinib alone in patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_107072] cells (osteoclast, endothelial cell, and osteoblast) and the epi[INVESTIGATOR_97075]. The partitioned role of Src is central to the theoretical therapeutic advantage of Src inhibito rs such as dasatinib when compared to 
agents that exclusively target the host compartment (bisphosphonates) or the epi[INVESTIGATOR_97076] (chemotherapy). This rationale forms the basis for the use of dasatinib in patients with castrate resistant prostate can cer and demonstrates further modulation of 
bone turnover marker in the setting of maximal pretreatment with zoledronic acid.  
Dasatinib, a multi- kinase inhibitor that is a potent Src inhibitor, is safe and has  
promising antitumor effects when combined with docetaxel. Based on the experimental 
and clinical observation we conclude that Src is a “credentialed” target for advanced 
prostate cancer. These data lead us to the hypothesis that inhibition of Src signaling with 
dasatinib in patients with treated with maximal androgen ablation will be effective in  
prostate cancer [4-10].

implicated in CRPC.  This study will efficiently validate candidate predictors of  
response to abiraterone  acetate  and assess the safety and efficacy of abiraterone acetate 
with the addition of two microenvironment targeting therapi[INVESTIGATOR_97077].  The result  of the study  will form  the foundation  for the development  of a 
personalized treatment targeting the microenvironment for patient with advanced 
prostate cancer.

3.0 Background Drug  Information  
 
3.1 Sunitinib  
 
Sunitinib is an orally administered small molecule that inhibits the tyrosine kinase 
enzymatic  activities  of VEGFR and PDGFR and also blocks  signaling through KIT.  
Vascular  endothelial  growth factor  receptor  (VEGFR)  and platelet -derived  growth factor 
receptor  (PDGFR)  have  been  implicated  in prostate  cancer  progression to hormone- 
refractory state and metastatic involvement [11 -13]. Bone metastasis can occur in more 
than 95% of mHRPC patients and contributes to morbidity and mortality in this disease. 
Overexpression of PDGFR occurs in bone metastases as well as in the primary prostate adenocarcinoma.  
 
Sunitinib has been approved multinationally for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal 
tumor (GIST) after disease progression for intolerance to imatinib and for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In clinical studies, sunitinib has been shown to have good oral bioavailability, linear pharmacokinetics, and a prolonged half- life for the 
parent compound, sunitinib (~40 hrs), and its active N-desethyl metabolite SU012662 (~80 hrs). Steady state levels of sunitinib and its metabolite are reached [ADDRESS_107074] been constitutional symptoms (eg, fatigue/asthenia), gastrointestinal effects (eg, nausea, diarrhea, stomatitis, dyspepsia), myelosuppression (eg, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), and dermatological effects (eg, dermatitis, skin discoloration, hair depi[INVESTIGATOR_371]).  
 
3.1.1 Mechanism of Action 
Sunitinib is a small molecule with antitumor properties th at are pharmacologically 
mediated through inhibition of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that are 
important in regulation of tumor cell growth, angiogenesis, and metastatic progression [14]. Specifically, sunitinib is a potent ATP- competitive inhi bitor of the catalytic  
activity of a group of closely related RTKs consisting of PDGFR -α and -β, KIT, 
CSF-1R, FLT- 3, VEGFR-1, -2, and -3, and RET. Due to its multi- targeted profile, the 
pharmacological activity of sunitinib is likely mediated by [CONTACT_97110]- 
and PDGF -dependent angiogenesis. 
 
In addition, sunitinib has demonstrated a higher response rate than that reported for anti- 
VEGF  antibody  treatment  in patients  with RCC [15].  Early  evidence  indicates that 
inhibition of multiple  tumor  targets  may add to the efficacy  of anticancer  agents.  This is 
consistent with results from preclinical experiments suggesting dual inhibition of 
VEGFRs  and PDGFRs  produces  greater  antiangiogenic and antitumor effects than 
inhibition of VEGF signaling alone [16].

3.1.2 Molecular Formula and Chemical  Class  
Sunitinib has the molecular formula C 22H27FN 4O2. The free base has a molecular weight 
of 398.48 and the L- malate salt, the form used in clinical trials (Figure 1), has a  
molecular weight of 532.57. The chemical name [CONTACT_17008] L- malate salt is: (Z)- N-[2- 
(Diethylamino)ethyl]-5- [(5-fluoro -2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-3H -indol-3- ylidene)methyl] -2,4- 
dimethyl-1H -pyrrole -3-carboxamide (S) -2-hydroxysuccinate.

Sunitinib  has been  shown to  inhibit tumor growth of  PC3 tumor  cells in xenograft  mouse 
models  [17],  as well as in subcutaneous, orthotopic  and bone  metastasis  models by 75% 
to 88%  compared  to control animcals  [[COMPANY_007] data on file].  It has also been  shown to 
have direct growth inhibitory effect on LNCAP cells in vitro at concentrations as low as  
0.05 μM. Preliminary  data from  a Phase ½ study  (Protocol A6181043) study  in mHRPC  
suggest that sunitinib antitumor activity with acceptable safety profile.  
 
Protocol A6181043 is an ongoing open-label, dose finding study of sunitinib given once 
daily on a 2 weeks on, 1 week off treatment dosing regimen (Schedule 2/1) in 
combination with docetaxel and prednisone in patients with mHRPC in the first- line 
treatment setting.  
 
A 6-week sunitinib -only lead-in period (50mg/day administered on a 4 weeks on, 2 
weeks off treatment dosing regimen) was incorporated into the study design in order to 
provide data on PSA modulation by [CONTACT_97111]. 
 
The Phase I portion of the study was recently completed:4 successive cohorts patients 
received escalating doses of sunitinib (12.5, 37.5, and 50 mg/day) given on Schedule 2/1 
in combination with 60 or 75 mg/m2 of docetaxel every 3 weeks and 5 mg BID of 
prednisone continuously. Dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were evaluated in the first 9

weeks on study (lead-in and one combination cycle) and the recommended combination 
dose was defined as the dose level at which ≤ [ADDRESS_107075] acceptable pharmacokinetic profile.  
 
Two DLTs were observed among 25 patients which were manageable and reversible: one grade 3 hyponatremia in the 50mg sunitinib + 60 mg/m
2 docetaxel cohort and one 
grade 4 neutropenia in the 37.5 mg sunitinib + 75 mg/m2 docetaxel cohort. Preliminary 
pharmacokinetic assessments in all patients indicated an increase in total sunitinib  
concentration when combined with docetaxel and prednisone, primarily related to an 
increase in the active metabolite SU 012662 concentrations. There was also a small 
decrease in docetaxel concentrations, possibly related to prednisone induction. Based on 
these results, the combination dose was chosen as sunitinib 37.5 mg/day in combination 
with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and prednisone [ADDRESS_107076] data cutoff, a total of 14 patients had discontinued the study (6 due to disease progression and 8 due to adverse events, including 1 on-study death due to complications of the disease). Preliminary efficacy results showed a confirmed PSA 
response in 10 (40%) patients and an objective response rate of 20% (4 of 20 patients 
with measurable disease) [18]. The study has now proceeded to the Phase [ADDRESS_107077] patterns of sunitinib -induced PSA modulation during the lead-in period: 
 
1. PSA reduction: 7 patients (28%) exhibited a mean  PSA decline of 40% (including 
3 patients with a confirmed PSA response [>50% decline confirmed by a second 
value]).  
 
2. Initial  PSA increase:  12 patients  had an initial PSA increase,  followed  by a drop 
during the sunitinib off -treatment period of 2 weeks (mean increase during the 
lead-in of 273%, followed  by a decrease of 28%). 
 
3. PSA increase:  6 patients  experience  PSA progression (mean  increase of 73%)  and 
eventually  discontinued the study  due to disease progression. 
 
As seen with these results, further understanding of PSA kinetics during treatment with 
novel antiangiogenic agents is critical for the proper definition of efficacy, especially when the comparator arm is chemotherapy. Therefore, PSA alone is not likely to be a reliable marker for assessment of disease status in studies of sunitinib in patients with prostate cancer. Similar lack of correlation between PSA levels during treatment with  
clinical si gns and symptoms of progressive disease has also been reported with sorafenib 
[19]. 
[ADDRESS_107078], will ensure that all 
sunitinib is stored in a secure area, under recommended storage conditions (controlled 
room temperature 15-30°C) and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
All study drug supplies must be kept in a locked, limited access room. The study drug must not be used outside the context of this protocol. Under no circumstances should the investigator or other site personnel supply study drug to other investigators, patients, or clinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed by [CONTACT_97112]. 
 
3.2 Abiraterone  Acetate  
 
Pharmacology 
 
Abiraterone acetate (CB7630) is the prodrug of abiraterone (CB7598). Once ingested, it 
is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_97078]. Abiraterone is a selective steroidal inhibitor of 17α-hydroxylase/C17, 20-lyase (cytochrome P450c17 [CYP17]). 
 
CYP17 is an important enzyme in the synthetic pathway for the production of androgens 
in the testes and adrenal glands. It catalyzes the conversion of pregnenolone or 
progesterone into dihydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_2119] (DHEA) or androstenedione, respectively, 2 
precursors of testosterone.  
 
Thus, abiraterone inhibits the production of testosterone in adrenal glands and testes. Testosterone, a C19 androgen, is further converted to the more potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), by [CONTACT_97113] 5α -reductase in the prostate; both  
testosterone and DHT are principal promoters of prostate cancer growth.  
 
Inhibitory effects of abiraterone on CYP17 activity have been demonstrated in vitro in rat and human testicu lar microsome preparations, and in vivo, in mouse, rat, and 
monkey animal models [20-21]. As expected, inhibition of CYP17 resulted in a 
reduction in circulating testosterone levels and, accordingly, the weight of androgen- 
sensitive organs. Reversible microscopic changes were observed in the tissues of  
12 2010- 0070  
January 8, 2021  
Page 12 of 56  
  
reproductive organs and in the adrenal gland. These effects were clearly demonstrated 
in established animal models after administration of abiraterone acetate.  
 
In a CYP2C8 drug-drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, the AUC of pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] 
(CYP2C8 substrate) was increased by 46% when pi[INVESTIGATOR_97079] a single dose of 1,[ADDRESS_107079] current DDI information for abiraterone acetate, please refer to the full 
prescribing information.  
 
Toxicology 
 
Nonclinical safety studies (See Investigator’s Brochure) included the following: both in 
vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies of abir aterone acetate and abiraterone; a single  
oral dose study of abiraterone acetate in mice; a single oral dose study in rats, two 28- day repeated oral dose toxicology studies of abiraterone acetate in rats (with 28 -day 
recovery  periods), a 13- week  oral toxicity and toxicokinetic  study  in rats (with  a 4-week 
recovery period), a 28- day repeated oral dose toxicity and toxicokinetic (TK) study 
(with  a 28-day recovery  period) in monkeys, and a 13-week  oral toxicity  and 
toxicokinetic  study  in monkeys (with  a 4-week  recovery  period) in monkeys. 
 
In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies conducted with abiraterone acetate or 
abiraterone did not show any mutagenic or clastogenic activity. No carcinogenicity or 
developmental and reproductive toxicology studies have been conducted with 
abiraterone acetate at this stage of development.  
 
In both single oral dose and 28- day repeated oral dose studies, administration of  
abiraterone acetate to rats resulted in marked effects on the reproductive systems at all  
dose levels tested (40, 126, 400 mg/kg/d [240, 756, 2,400 mg/m2/d]). These effects were 
largely predictable from the pharmacological effects of the agent. The significance of 
changes seen in liver histology and liver function tests was further evaluated in 13-w eek 
toxicity studies in rats and monkeys. 
 
Higher doses administered for extended periods in both male and female rats (13 weeks treatment with dose levels up to 2000 mg/kg/d) resulted in severe morbidity in some  
animals, necessitating euthanasia. The study was continued at reduced doses: 50 
mg/kg/d (low dose), 250 mg/kg/d (mid) and 750 mg/kg/d (high). At the reduced low 
and mid dose levels, there were no test article -related clinical signs of toxicity during 
dosing or during the 4- week recovery period. 
 
At the new maximum dose of 750 mg/kg/d, the male rats lost weight in a manner 
consistent with inhibition of testosterone synthesis by [CONTACT_97114], as reflected by 
[CONTACT_97115] 2 of treatment.  At the high dose level (750 
13 2010- 0070  
January 8, 2021  
Page 13 of 56 
 
  
mg/kg/d), weight loss was also associated with reduced food consumption in male 
animals. Clinical chemistry findings, such as increased bilirubin and alkaline 
phosphatase, were suggestive of changes in liver function. Liver weights in both male and female rats were increased at the mid and high dose levels. Liver and gall bladder weights correlated wit h the minimal or slight bile duct hyperplasia observed  
microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_97080]. Bile duct hyperplasia correlated with increases in 
total bilirubin in female rats only.  
 
In male and female monkeys, 28-day repeated, once-daily, oral administration of 
abiraterone acetate induced effects in the adrenals, mammary gland, and reproductive organs at all doses tested (2, 10, 50, 250, and 1,000 mg/kg [24, 120, 600, 3,000, and 12,000 mg/m
2]). Treatment with abiraterone acetate was associated with hormonal, 
microscopic, and macroscopic changes that were considered to be consistent with the 
antiandrogenic activity of abiraterone acetate (ie, inhibition of CYP17). These changes 
were reversible during the 28-day recovery period following death of treatment. 
Clinical chemistry changes were fully reversible with the exception of plasma bilirubin 
levels in male monkeys in the 250 and 1000-mg/kg/d treatment groups, which remained 
elevated at the end of the recovery period. 
 
In a 13-week, repeated oral dose study in male and female monkeys with a [ADDRESS_107080] hyperplasia was seen 
microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_97081]. The 
hyperplasia was partially reversed during the recovery period while the bilirubin levels 
returned to normal.  
 
Pharmacokinetics and metabolism 
 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicokinetic (TK) profiles of abiraterone, administered 
as abiraterone acetate has been characterized in mice (oral, intraperitoneal, and  
intravenous), rats (oral), and monkeys (oral). Abiraterone acetate administered orally was systemically absorbed by [CONTACT_97116][INVESTIGATOR_97082].  
Bioavailability of abiraterone, administered  as abiraterone acetate, was 37% in the  
mouse in one study. Toxicokinetic analyses revealed that animals were exposed mainly 
to the metabolite, abiraterone and TK values were not linear and did not increase 
proportionally to dose from 126 to 400 mg/kg/d in rats or from 2 to 1,000 mg/kg/d in 
monkeys. The exact mechanism(s) involved that would explain this observation 
14 2010- 0070  
January 8, 2021  
Page 14 of 56  
  
remain(s) to be determined. Lower Cmax  and AUC at the end of the dosing period in 
the 28-day toxicology studies in rats and monkeys suggest a possible induction of 
hepatic catabolic metabolism of abiraterone.  
 
Preliminary data from in vitro studies with human hepatocytes indicate that human 
hepatocytes can convert abiraterone acetate to abiraterone and to other metabolites by 
[CONTACT_97117]. 
 
3.2.1 Clinical Experience  
 
Three Phase 1 dose- escalation studies of abiraterone acetate were conducted in 
the [LOCATION_008] by [CONTACT_97118] (ICR) to investigate the 
safety and pharmacokinetics of oral abiraterone acetate in medically castrated or 
noncastrated men with prostate cancer [23]. In these 3 studies, 2 single-dose 
studies (Protocols PH1/054 and PH1/059) and one repeated daily dosing study 
(Protocol PH1/063) were carried out to determine the dose levels required to  
adequately suppress testosterone synthesis in these subjects. Other endocrine 
effects, particularly suppression of cortisol synthe sis, were also examined.  
 
A total of 26 patients were treated at dose levels ranging from 10 to 800 mg/d in 
these Phase 1 studies. Overall, these studies showed that abiraterone acetate was 
safe and well tolerated. At doses of 500 and 800 mg/d, significant decreases in  
circulating testosterone were achieved in all 3 studies.  
 
In patients receiving 12-day repeated dosing at 500 and 800 mg/d (Protocol 
PHI/063), there were no apparent clinical signs of mineralocorticoid excess or glucocorticoid insufficiency. While basal levels of cortisol were within normal limits, use of the sho rt Synacthen test (synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone 
[ACTH1 -24]) on Day [ADDRESS_107081] responses. This observation suggests potential effects of abiraterone on the adrenal reserve which might be predicted from its known pharmacologic effects on steroid synthetic pathways. 
 
Subsequently, two Phase 1/2 studies (COU- AA-001 [124, 27, 28] and COU- AA- 
002 [15, 29]) have been sponsored by [CONTACT_97119], to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of abiraterone acetate administered continuously on a daily basis in 
patients who had castrate levels of testosterone, have been receiving ongoing 
GnRH agonists, and had not been treated with chemotherapy. These studies investigated the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone acetate, its effects on pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] - 
adrenal axis, in addition to identifying the dose for additional antitumor activity assessment. At the conclusion of Phase [ADDRESS_107082] been reached at 
1000 mg daily dose in that the AUC values at a dose of 2000 mg are no higher 
than that for the 1000 mg dose. 
15 2010- 0070  
January 8, 2021  
Page 15 of 56  
  
Furthermore, a Phase 2 study (COU- AA-003 [26, 30]) was also initiated to 
assess the antitumor activity of abiraterone acetate in patients who have failed 
docetaxel- based chemotherapy.  
 
 
Study COU- AA-001 
 
Abiraterone acetate was well -tolerated at doses up to 2000 mg/day with no dose 
limiting toxicity being observed [27, 28]. Antitumor activity was observed with 
23 out of 38 patients having a greater than 50% decline in PSA lasting at least  
three months. [ADDRESS_107083] criteria had partial responses. There are 3 cases of regressing bone disease on imaging and reports of symptom improvem ent (stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_97083]). Furthermore, a 
reduction in levels of alkaline phosphatase and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and 
circulating tumour cells has been reported. Of particular interest, [ADDRESS_107084] was reached at that dose  
 
Study COU- AA-002 
 
In study COU- AA-002, a significant proportion of patients had prior treatment 
with ketoconazole for their prostate cancer [29]. Treatment with abiraterone  
acetate was found to be well-tolerated up to 1000 mg/day with no dose- limiting 
toxicity.  All but one patient (24/25) had an initial decline in PSA and 12/25 
(48%) patients showed a greater than 50%. 
 
Study COU- AA-[ADDRESS_107085] androgen independent prostate cancer and failed docetaxel- based  
chemotherapy. Although patients had more advanced disease, abiraterone 
acetate was generally well tolerated [30]. Preliminary antitumor activity was 
also apparent. A >50% decline in PSA levels was seen in 7 (54%) of the first [ADDRESS_107086] failed hormonal therapy with 
agents inc luding GnRH agonists, antiandrogens, and ketoconazole, as well as 
chemotherapy. Dose-limiting toxicity was not observed in up to 2000 mg/day. Antitumor activities were apparent in these studies.

3.3 Dasatinib  
 
Dasatinib [SPRYCEL®] is a potent, broad spectrum ATP-competitive inhibitor of 5 
critical oncogenic tyrosine kinase/kinase families: BCR -ABL, SRC, c -KIT, PDGF 
receptor β (PDGFRβ), and ephrin (EPH) receptor kinases, each of which has been linked 
to multiple forms of human malignancies.[31]  
 
Drug discovery and nonclinical pharmacology studies showed that dasatinib:[32] 
  
• Kills BCR- ABL dependent leukemic cell lines, including a number that are 
resistant  to imatinib  due to kinase  domain  mutations  or overexpression of SRC 
family kinases and is effective against all imatinib -resistant kinase domain 
mutations tested to date, except  T315I   
• Inhibited  proliferation  of cancer  cell lines  that express activated  SRC or c-KIT  
• Potently inhibits VEGF -stimulated proliferation and migration in HUVECs   
• Has potent bone  anti- resorptive activity

3.3.1 Preclinical Anti- tumor Activity  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] In Vitro Molecular  Studies  
Dasatinib  potently inhibits: SRC kinases, BCR- ABL, c -KIT, PDGFRβ and 
EPHA and was less potent against 16 other unrelated protein tyrosine kinases 
(PTKs) and serine/threonine kinases. Imatinib is less potent against several key enzymes: for example, Dasatinib was 26 0-, 8- , 60-, and >1000- fold more potent 
than imatinib versus BCR- ABL, c -KIT, PDGFR β, and SRC kinases, 
respectively. [32] 
 
In vitro , dasatinib was active in leukemic cell lines representing variants of 
imatinib mesylate sensitive and resistant disease. Dasatinib inhibited the growth 
of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 
cell lines overexpressing BCR -ABL. Under the conditions of the assays, 
dasatinib was able to overcome imatinib resistance resulting from BCR -ABL 
kinase domain mutations, activation of alternate signaling pathways involving 
the SRC family kinases (LYN, HCK), and multi- drug resistance gene  
overexpression. [31] 
 
Dasatinib inhibits the BCR -ABL kinase with an in vitro IC 50 of 3 nM, a potency 
260-fold greater than that of imatinib mesylate (IC 50 = 790 nM). In cellular 
assays, dasatinib killed or inhibited the proliferation of all BCR -ABL dependent 
leukemic cell lines tested to date. Dasatinib also demonstrated undiminished  
anti-tumor activity against several preclinically - and clinically -derived models of 
imatinib mesylate resistance. Evidence that SRC family kinase over expression 
may play a role in clinical resistance to imatinib mesylate was demonstrated in three CML cell lines established from patien ts who failed imatinib mesylate 
therapy. These cells remained highly sensitive to the cell -killing effects of 
dasatinib. [32] 
 
These results demonstrate that dasatinib is effective in reducing the proliferation 
or survival of both imatinib mesylate -sensitive and resistant cells, and its  
inhibitory activity is not solely dependent on BCR- ABL.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] In Vivo Studies  
The activity of dasatinib against CML cells in vitro was reproduced in vivo  
against several human CML xenograft models grown subcutaneously in SCID 
mice. Against the K562/imatinib mesylate/R CML model, dasatinib was curative in 100% of the treated animals. In contrast, at its optimal dose and schedule, imatinib mesylate was inactive.  
 
3.3.2 Preclinical  Toxicology 
Single or repeated oral administration of dasatinib principally affected the 
gastro -intestinal (GI) tract, including the liver, the hematopoietic and lymphoid  
[ADDRESS_107088] the 
immune system and bone turnover. 
 
Dasatinib in vitro activity in the HERG/IKr and Purkinje -fiber assays indicated a 
moderate liability for prolongation of cardiac ventricular repolarization (QT  
interval) in the clinic. However, there were no dasatinib - related changes  
observed in electrocardiograms, nervous system function, respi[INVESTIGATOR_97084], blood pressure, or arterial oxygen saturation in single-dose, 10-day, or 1- month oral toxicity studies in monkeys. 
 
Dasatinib  was found to exhibit a profile of broad- spectrum platelet inhibition  
best typi[INVESTIGATOR_97085]- platelet agents such as the GPI[INVESTIGATOR_97086]/IIIa antagonists, integrelin 
and abciximab. 
 
Finally, modulation of SRC kinase activity could also affect osteoclast  
morphology and function and bone remodeling. This effect could potentially 
result in an increase in bone mineral density and a phenotype analogous to  
osteopetrosis. [32] 
 
3.3.[ADDRESS_107089] been evaluated in 229 healthy subjects 
and in 137 patients with leukemia (CML or Ph+ALL) from a Phase I clinical study (CA180002). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Absorption 
Maximum plasma concentrations (C
max) of dasatinib are observed between 0.5 
and 6 hours (T max) following oral administration. Dasatinib exhibits dose 
proportional increases in AUC and linear elimination characteristics over the 
dose range of 15 mg to 240 mg/day. The overall mean terminal half- life of 
dasatinib is 3 –5 hours. [31] 
 
Data from a study of 54 healthy subjects administered a single, 100-mg dose of 
dasatinib 30 minutes following consumption of a high- fat meal resulted in a 14% 
increase in the mean AUC of dasatinib. The observed food effects were not 
clinically relevant.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Distribution  
In patients, dasatinib has an apparent volume of distribution of 2505 L, 
suggesting that the drug is extensively distributed in the extravascular space. Binding of dasatinib and its active metabolite to human plasma proteins in vitro was approximately 96% and 93%, respectively, with no concentration 
dependence over the range of 100–500 ng/mL. [31] 
19 2010- 0070  
January 8, 2021  
Page 19 of 56  
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Metabolism  
Dasatinib is extensively metabolized in humans, primarily by [CONTACT_35233] 
P450 enzyme 3A4. CYP3A4 was the primary enzyme responsible for the 
formation of the active metabolite. Flavin -containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO- 
3) and uridine diphosphate- glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes are also  
involved in the formation of dasatinib metabolites. In human liver microsomes, 
dasatinib was a weak time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4. 
 
The exposure of the active metabolite, which is equipotent to dasatinib, 
represents approximately 5% of the dasatinib AUC. This indicates that the active 
metabolite of dasatinib is unlikely to play a major role in the observed  
pharmacology of the drug. Dasatinib also had several other inactive oxidative 
metabolites.  
 
Dasatini b is a time -dependent inhibitor of CYP3A3. At clinically relevant 
concentrations, dasatinib does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 2E1. Dasatinib is not an inducer of human CYP enzymes. [31] 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Elimination  
Elimination is primarily via the feces. Following a single oral dose of [
14C]- 
labeled dasatinib, approximately 4% and 85% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively, within 10 days. Unchanged 
dasatinib  accounted for 0.1% and 19%  of the administered  dose in urine and feces, 
respectively,  with the remainder of the dose being  metabolites.  [31] 
 
3.3.4 Anticipated Adverse  Events  
 
Myelosuppression  
 
Treatment with dasatinib  is associated with severe (NCI CTC Grade 3 or 4)  
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. Their occurrence is more frequent 
in patients with advanced CML or Ph+ ALL than in chronic phase CML.  
Complete blood counts should be performed weekly for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. Myelosuppression was 
generally reversible and usually managed by [CONTACT_97120]. In a Phase 3 dose-optimization study in patients with chronic phase CML, Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression was reported less frequently in patients treated with 100 mg once daily than in patients treated with 70 mg twice daily. [31]  
20 2010- 0070  
January 8, 2021  
Page 20 of 56  
  
Bleeding Related Events  
 
In addition  to causing  thrombocytopenia in human subjects,  dasatinib  caused  
platelet dysfunction  in vitro . In all clinical  studies,  severe central  nervous  system 
(CNS) hemorrhages, including fatalities, occurred in <1% of patients receiving 
dasatinib.  Severe  gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in 4% of patients and 
generally required treatment interruptions and transfusions. Other cases of severe 
hemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients. Most bleeding events were associated with severe thrombocytopenia. 
 
Patients were excluded from participation in dasatinib clinical studies if they took medications that inhibit platelet function or anticoagulants. In some trials, the use o f anticoagulants, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], and non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) was allowed concurrently with dasatinib if the platelet count was  
>50,000. Caution should be exercised if patients are required to take medications 
that inhibit platelet function or anticoagulants. [31] 
 
Fluid Retention  
 
Dasatinib  is associated with fluid retention. In all clinical studies, severe fluid 
retention was reported in 8% of patients, including pleural and pericardial  
effusion reported in 5% and 1% of patients, respectively. Severe ascites and 
generalized edema were each reported in <1% of patients. Severe pulmonary 
edema was reported in 1% of patients. Patients who develop symptoms suggestive of pleural effusion such as dyspnea or dry cough should be evaluated by [CONTACT_13190] X-ray. Severe pleural effusion may require thoracentesis and oxygen therapy. Fluid retention events were typi[INVESTIGATOR_97087].  
 
In the Phase 3 dose-optimization study in patients with chronic phase CML, fluid 
retention events were r eported less frequently in patients treated with 100 mg  
once daily than in patients treated with 70 mg twice daily. [31] 
 
QT Prolongation 
 
In vitro data suggest that dasatinib has the potential to prolong cardiac 
ventricular  repolarization  (QT interval).  In single- arm clinical  studies  in patients 
with leukemia  treated  with dasatinib,  the mean  QTc interval  changes from  
baseline using  Fridericia’s  method  (QTcF)  were  3–6 msec;  the upper  95% 
confidence intervals for all mean changes from baseline were <8 msec. Nine 
patients had QTc prolongation reported as an adverse event. Three patients 
(<1%) experienced a QTcF >[ADDRESS_107090] or may 
develop prolongation of QTc. These include patients with hypokalemia or 
21 2010- 0070  
January 8, 2021  
Page 21 of 56  
  
hypomagnesemia, patients with congenital long QT syndrome, patients taking 
anti-arrhythmic medicines or other medicinal products that lead to QT  
prolongation, and cumulative high- dose anthracycline therapy. Hypokalemia or 
hypomagnesemia should be corrected prior to dasatinib administration. [31] 
 
3.3.5 Phase I experience in Solid  Tumors  
 
In a Phase I study (CA180003) conducted by [CONTACT_43899] (BMS), dasatinib  was administered on a BID schedule to 42 subjects with refractory  
solid tumor. As of 10- Feb-2006, 33 subjects were treated for a full 4 weeks for 
evaluation of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). This study explored [ADDRESS_107091] schedule assessed 5 days of dasatinib 
followed by 2 days off- drug each week, and the second schedule assessed  
continuous daily dosing that was added in Amendment #3 (7- Mar-2005). In the 5 
days on/2 days off schedule, the following dose levels were explored: [ADDRESS_107092]. Given the otherwise acceptable tolerability of this dose level wi th toxicities that are medically manageable with a maximum 
severity of Grade 2, further escalation to the next dose level of 120 mg BID 
continuous daily schedule is currently under investigation. No further escalation above 160 mg BID was explored on this schedule because, as per protocol, this represents the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). [32] 
 
The preliminary  safety  results  from CA180003 demonstrate that no severe 
clinical toxicity has been encountered. Dasatinib did not induce significant 
myelosuppression in this patient population Gastrointestinal symptoms including 
nausea and vomiting were reported in most subjects, fatigue was reported in 17 
subjects (40%)  and rash in 9 subjects  (21%).  Edema,  lethargy and headache were 
uncommon,  and appe ar to be dose- related.  Additionally, the incidence and 
severity  of fluid  retention  and of pleural effusion,  in particular,  appear  to be less 
in subjects with solid tumors than in those with leukemia receiving comparable 
doses  of dasatinib.  There  were  4 subjects with drug- related  AEs leading  to 
discontinuation of treatment; none of these events were related to myelosuppression or fluid retention. [32]  
 
In another Phase I study (CA180021), dasatinib was administered on a QD schedule to 24 subjects with solid tumors in a drug-drug interaction and multi- 
ascending dose (MAD) study at doses up to [ADDRESS_107093] of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, on the PK 
of dasatinib (Segment 1) and the effect of dasatinib on pharmacodynamic 
[ADDRESS_107094] therapy exists (Segment 2).  
 
Segment 1 includes 18 subjects, of which 16 subjects were treated with dasatinib 
as of 2 -Jan-2006. Segment 2 includes approximately 30 add itional subjects, of 
which 14 subjects were treated with dasatinib as of 2 -Jan-2006. A total of 4 
deaths, all related to disease progression, were reported. There were 4 subjects 
with drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation: [ADDRESS_107095] been mild and infrequent. [32] 
 
To date, the safety profile in solid tumor subjects has been similar to that in CP 
CML subjects with the exception of severe myelosuppression, which has not 
been observed in solid tumor subjects and is considered related to efficacy 
against the leukemia as noted above, and severe bleeding which is secondary to thrombocytopenia in most instances.[32] 
 
3.3.6 Dasatinib Experience in Prostate  Cancer  
In a Phase I study (CA180085) conducted by [CONTACT_43899] (BMS), 
dasatinib was administered to [ADDRESS_107096]-line androgen ablation or progressed despi[INVESTIGATOR_97088]-androgen suppression after discontinuation of androgen 
ablation. Treatment was given in two study groups, one with a BID dosing sched ule and one with QD dosing. Twenty- five of 95 treated subjects were  
responders. Confirmed prostate -specific antigen (PSA) response was observed in 
2 subjects, 1 in each of the QD and BID groups. Stabilization of visceral/nodal 
disease as measured by [CONTACT_97121] 10 subjects in the QD group 
and 12 subjects in the BID group, and a partial response was observed in 1 
(1.1%) subject (QD group). Stabilization of bone disease was also noted. The 
QD dosing schedule led to fewer and less severe side- effect s [47]. 
 
In a Phase I/II study (CA180086) being conducted by [CONTACT_43899] 
(BMS), dasatinib  (QD schedule; dose escalation) is being administered in 
combination with docetaxel. Preliminary results indicate: Of the 46 treated subjects, confirmed partial response was observed in 16 subjects and stabilization of disease was observed in 9 subjects. Confirmed PSA response was 
observed in 28 subjects and confirmed bone scan improvement was observed in 
10 subjects.  Reduction of bone turnover markers (uNTX and BAP) was also 
observed. No drug-drug interactions (between dasatinib and docetaxel) were 
observed as demonstrated by [CONTACT_97122], and neither compound interfered with the metabolism of the other [47].

3.3.9 Storage, Handling, and Dispensing 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Storage  
 
Bottles containing dasatinib tablets should be stored at 15° - 25°C. 
All investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to local 
regulations. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that it is dispensed  
only to study subjects and only from official study sit es by [CONTACT_85983], as dictated by [CONTACT_427]. 
[ADDRESS_107097] is 
stored under the appropriate environmental conditions (temperature, light, and 
humidity. 
 
If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the investigational product 
arise, do not dispense the investigational product, and contact [CONTACT_20445].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Handling and Dispensing 
Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be 
considered. 
 
Dasatinib  tablets consist of a core tablet (containing the active drug substance), 
surrounded by a film coating to prevent exposure of pharmacy and clinical 
personnel to the active drug substance. If tablets are crushed or broken, 
pharmacy and clinical personnel sh ould wear disposable chemotherapy gloves. 
Personnel who are pregnant should avoid exposure to crushed and/or broken 
tablets.  
 
The Investigator (or assigned designee, i.e., study pharmacist) will dispense the proper number of each strength tablet to the subject to satisfy dosing  
requirements for the study. The containers provided to the subject should be 
labeled with proper instructions for use. The lot numbers, dosing start dates and the number of tablets for each dosage strength must be recorded on the 
drug accountability pages of record for the site. The subject must be instructed 
to return all unused dasatinib in the provided packaging at each subsequent visit.

5.0 Treatment  Plan 
 
Patients found to be eligible based on the criteria above, will provide informed consent and 
begin treatment with abiraterone acetate at 1000 mg orally each day, given in combination with 5mg of prednisone oral ly twice daily.  
 
If a patient demonstrates “progression” (as defined in Section 10.0) after treatment with abiraterone acetate in combination with prednisone, he will then be evaluated and 
randomized to receive either sunitinib at a dose of 37.[ADDRESS_107108] or dasatinib at a dose of 100 mg orally each day, both while 
continuing treatment with abiraterone acetate and prednisone. All patients will remain on 
treatment until “composite progression” is established or toxicity (see Section 10.1). After 
composite progression, patients will crossover to the alternate agent (a patient treated with sunitinib will cross over to treatment with dasatinib in combination with abiraterone and  
prednisone, while those randomized to dasatinib will crossover to treatment with sunitinib in 
combination with abiraterone and prednisone). A 4 week washout period is planned between targeted agents; and patients must have fully recovered from treatment related adverse events prior to startin g the second targeted agent. Patients will be taken off study following the 
crossover based on the accepted criteria in the initial portion of study. 
 
Abiraterone, dasatinib, and sunitinib will be provided free of charge by [CONTACT_97124].  
[ADDRESS_107109] be satisfied.  
 
5.2 Study Drug  Administration : 
 
Abiraterone Acetate: Patients will be instructed to take 4 tablets (250 mg each) orally (PO) at least 1 hour before a meal or 2 hours after a meal. Treatment with abiraterone will continue throughout the duration of participation. 
 
Prednisone: Patients will be instructed to take 5 -mg oral prednisone, twice daily. 
Treatment with prednisone will continue throughout the duration of participation. 
 
Patients will be randomized to receive either dasatinib or sunitinib after progression on single- agent abiraterone.  
 
Dasatinib  Starting Dose: Patients will be instructed to take 100 mg (2 tablets @ 50 mg 
each) of dasatinib orally once daily. Dasatinib is formulated in 20, 50 mg and 100mg 
tablets. Tablets should not be crushed or cut; they should be swallowed whole. 
Dasatinib can be taken with or without a meal. The dosing time may be adjusted as 
required. If doses are missed for toxicity, they should not be replaced. If a dose is not Abira terone

A total of 4 weeks (± 3 days) will constitute a course of therapy. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_97090].  
 
5.3 Laboratory  Assessments  and Imaging  Studies: 
Patients may have standard lab studies drawn by a local physician and results faxed 
to MDACC prior to their scheduled clinic visit. If a patient is unable to return for restaging scans due to symptoms of progressive disease, a patient may have scans  
done at a local physician. These scans should be sent to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_96294]. 
 
5.4 Duration of therapy: 
Patients will continue on each treatment arm until progression by [CONTACT_43877]2 criteria or 
persistent grade 3 toxicity after dose modification or patient withdraws consent . 
 
5.5 Response to Therapy: 
 
Clinical patient assessments will occur at four week  intervals. Response to therapy 
will be determined by [CONTACT_43877]2 criteria with tumor evaluations taken as clinically 
indicated. Detailed information regarding response criteria is located in section 9.0. 
 
5.6 Concomitant  therapy:  
 
5.6.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted  Treat ments  
At each visit, all concomitant treatments, including blood and blood products, must be reported on the source documentation and on the Concomitant Medications page of the 
case report form. Concomitant medications must also be documented at the time o f 
discontinuation and at the [ADDRESS_107110] is 
on study. Concomitant palliative radiotherapy is not permitted for disease progression on treatment, but is allow ed for pre-existing non- target lesions with approval from the 
Principal Investigator. Bisphosphonate treatment may not be initiated during study; if already begun, it may be continued at Investigator discretion. 
 
Subjects requiring any prohibited therapy should not be enrolled. If enrolled, the 
prohibited agent(s) will be withdrawn prior to first dose of study drug. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Potent CYP3A4  Inhibitors  
30 2010- 0070  
January 8, 2021  
Page 30 of 56  
  
Dasatinib  is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_2750]3A4 enzyme. In drug- drug interaction 
studies, concomitant use of ketoconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) produced an 
increase of > 5 -fold in dasatinib exposure. Therefore, potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 are 
prohibited duri ng study; for such medications, a wash-out period of ≥  7 days is  
required prior to starting dasatinib. Subjects should be advised not to consume 
substantial quantities of grapefruit or pomegranate juice. (Less -potent inhibitors, 
inducers and substrates of CYP3A4 are restricted, see Section [IP_ADDRESS].) Most 
commonly -used potent CYP3A4 inhibitors are: 
o itraconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole,  voriconazole;  
o amprenavir, atazanavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir,  ritonavir;  
o ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, diclofenac, doxycycline,  enoxacin, imatinib, 
isoniazid, ketamine, nefazodone, nicardipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], propofol, quinidine, 
telithromycin.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Medications that prolong  QT Interval 
Subjects enrolled in this study may not take concomitant medications known to 
prolong the QT interval (Class I; see http://www.qtdrugs.org/medical- pros/drug - 
lists/drug -lists.htm). For such medications, a wash-out period of ≥  7 days is required 
prior to starting dasatin ib. Agents which possibly prolong the QT interval are 
restricted; see Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Medications known to prolong the QT interval are: 
o quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, 
dofetilide; 
o erythromycins,  clarithromycin;  
o chlorpromazine, haloperidol, mesoridazine, thioridazine, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924]; 
o cisapride,  bepridil,  droperidol,  methadone, arsenic,  chloroquine, domperidone, 
halofantrine, levomethadyl, pentamidine, sparfloxacin, lidoflazine.  
 
5.6.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions 
The following restricted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_97091], but are permitted with 
caution when clearly medically indicated. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] CYP3A4 Inducers, Inhibitors,  Substrates 
Drugs that induce CYP3A4 activity may decrease both dasatinib and exemestane 
plasm a concentrations. In subjects in whom enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (eg, 
phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital) are used, alternative agents with lesser enzyme-induction potential should be considered. 
 
Dasatinib is predominantly metabolized by [CONTACT_2750]3A4 isoenzyme. Potent inhibitors 
are prohibited, but less-potent inhibitors may also increase exposure to dasatinib. If 
administration of a CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided in subjects receiving 
dasatinib, close monitoring for toxicity and dasatinib dose reduction should be 
considered. Subjects should be advised not to consume substantial quantities of grapefruit or pomegranate juice. 
[ADDRESS_107111] a narrow therapeutic index such as 
alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924],  
quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in subjects receiving dasatinib. Note: subjects treated with a fentanyl patch are eligible for this trial.  
 
As warfarin is metabolized through the CYP450 system, therapeutic anticoagulation 
with warfarin (eg, Coumadin
 or Cournadine) is not recommended. As an  
alternative, therapeutic anticoagulation may be accomplished using low -molecular 
weight heparin (eg, Lovenox) or heparin. Mini Dose Coumadin (eg, 1 mg QD) is 
permitted for prophylaxis of central venous catheter thrombosis.  
 
Please see a comprehensive list of CYP drugs at the following web address. 
http://www.medic ine.iupui.edu/Flockhart/table.htm ) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] CYP2D6  and CYP1A2  inhibitor Inducers,  Inhibitors,  Substrates 
Drugs metabolized through the CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 pathways should be used with 
caution while participating in this study. A list of these drugs can be found at the link provide above. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Medications that may Prolong QT Interval 
Concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval are prohibited 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]); medications which may possibly prolong the QT interval 
(non- Class I; see http://www.qtdrugs.org/medical-pros/drug- lists/drug -lists.htm) are 
restricted. Should the Investigator believe that beginning therapy with a potentially QT-prolonging medication (other than those prohibited) is vital to an individual 
subject’s care, the Investigator must check that the prior on -therapy ECG does not 
show QTcF ≥ 450 msec or an increase in QTc ≥  60 msec over the baseline value.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Antacids  
Nonclinical data demonstrate that the solubility of dasatinib is pH dependent and a 
clinical study has shown that dasatinib exposure is substantially and durably reduced after treatment with famotidine. Administration of dasatinib with H2 inhibitors or  
proton pump inhibitors should therefore be avoided. If antacid therapy is needed, a locally -acting antacid may be used, and should be administered at least 2 hours before 
or after the dose of dasatinib. 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] St. John's Wort (Hypericum  perforatum)  
Data suggests that St. John’s Wort may decrease dasatinib and exemestane plasma 
concentrations unpredictably. Subjects receiving dasatinib should not take St. John's Wort. Subjects should discontinue St. John’s Wort at least 5 days before starting dasatini b.

January 8, 2021  
Page 32 of 56  
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Medications  that Inhibit  Platelet Function  and Anticoagulants 
Src-family kinase inhibition potentially reduces platelet aggregation. Caution should 
thus be exercised if subjects are required to take medications that inhibit platelet  
function or anticoagulants. Such medications include:aspi[INVESTIGATOR_8427]-containing 
combinations, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], dipyridamole, tirofiban, dipyridamole, epoprostenol, eptifibatide, cilostazol, abciximab, ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325], cilostazol warfarin, heparin/low molecular weight heparin [eg, danaparoid, dalteparin, tinzaparin, enoxaparin] 
exceptions are low- dose warfarin for prophylax is to prevent catheter thrombosis and 
heparin for flushes of intravenous lines. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Bisphosphonates  
Subjects who had been receiving bisphosphonates prior to study entry may continue 
on therapy with caution. Although concomitant use of bisphosphonates is not recommended, clinically -significant hypocalcemia has been uncommon. Oral serum 
calcium (Ca
+2) supplementation, including Vitamin D if appropriate, is warranted. 
 
5.6.3 Supportive Care  Guidance 
Supportive care, especially pain control, will be optimized in all subjects. Guidance is 
provided for management of common side effects of dasatinib in order to maximize  
opportunity for benefit. Investigators are strongly urged to discuss with Medical 
Moni tor prior to discontinuing study treatment for reasons other than radiographic PD.  
 
Non-hematologic  side effects are typi[INVESTIGATOR_97092]  v4.0 Grade  1 - 2. Interruption  
and/or  dose  reduction may be necessary,  especially  if Grade  ≥ 2. Usual  supportive care 
measures  should be used  for nausea/emesis,  diarrhea, pain, fever  or headache.  Neither 
clinically  significant  myelosuppression nor use of hematopoietic  growth  factors  is 
expected.  
 
Osteoclast inhibition is expected; therefore, calcium supplementation (eg, calcium 
carbonate 500 mg PO TID) is warranted to maintain serum Ca+[ADDRESS_107112] during 
dasatinib treatment. Vitamin D supplementation (eg, ergocalciferol 400 IU PO QD) may be appropriate for persistent hypocalcemia. Bisphosphonate thera py should be 
deferred in the presence of hypocalcemia.  
 
Fluid retention, including clinically -significant pleural effusion, has been observed 
during dasatinib treatment. Refer to Section 3.3.4 for treatment recommendations. 
 
5.7 Treatment  and evaluation  outside  M.D.  Anderson Cancer  Center  (MDACC):  
 
Patients enrolled at MDACC may have their interim evaluations performed with their 
local oncologist according to the protocol after [ADDRESS_107113]

initiation,  and will be documented  in the patient  record. 
 
5.7.[ADDRESS_107115], treatment schema and 
evaluation  during  treatment  will be provided to the local  physician. 
 
5.7.6 The home  physician  will be requested  to report  to the MDACC physician 
investigator all life threatening  events  within  24 hours  of documented 
occurrence.  
 
5.7.7 Patients  will return  to MDACC every  8 weeks for evaluation.

** Patients with recurrent gra de 3 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia for >7 days will dose reduce in the next 
cycle.  Patients  who develop  grade  3 or grade  4 lymphopenia  may continue  study  treatment without  interruption.  
 
Dose Re-Escalation 
 
Doses reduced from the 37.5- mg/d level for drug -related toxicity should generally not be re - 
escalated. However, intrapatient re-escalation back to the previous dose level may be 
permitted provided the toxicity responsible for dose reduction has not recurred at a grade [ADDRESS_107121] will not delay patient care under any circumstance.  
 
8.2 Dasatinib  
 
8.2.1 If patients  taking  dasatinib  present with recurring  dyspnea  and fatigue  after  an 
initial dose interruption, with no explanation or evident underlying cause, the 
diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) should be considered. If 
PAH is confirmed, dasatinib should be permanently discontinued and patients 
will be followed per standard practice guidelines.

Any Grade 4 toxicity will be communicated directly with the sponsors (in the combination phase or 
in a single arm phase) by [CONTACT_3476].  
 
Toxicities attributed to the treatment will be reported as described in Section 13.  
 
 
9.0 Criteria  For Response and Progression  (RECIST v1.1)  
 
9.1 Tumor  Measurements:  
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_107124] one dimension 
(longest diameter to be recorded). The minimum measurable lesion size on CT 
should  be 1.5 cm (15 mm).  All superficial  disease  (e.g. palpable lymph  nodes)  is 
considered  measurable.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum  of 5 lesions per 
organ and 10 lesions  in total representative  of all involved organs should be 
identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions 
should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitabili ty for accurate repetitive measurements (either by [CONTACT_13458]). A sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LONGEST DIAMETER (LD).  
The baseline sum of the LD will be used as reference to further characterize the 
objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_107125] with the documentation 
under  the supervision  of the Principal  Investigator.  
 
9.1.5 An estimate  of disease  status will be made  and recorded  on clinic  notes  at each 
visit as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) or 
progressive disease  (PD).  
 
9.2 Response  Definitions  (per PCWG2  guidelines [40]): 
40 2010- 0070  
January 8, 2021  
Page 40 of 56  
  
9.2.1 Complete  Response  (CR) : Disappearance of target  lesions.  
 
9.2.2 Partial Response (PR) : PSA: Decline of PSA by > 50% without normalization 
maintained for [ADDRESS_107126] demonstrate 30% decrease in the sum of the longest 
diameter (LD) of target lesions on the restaging study, taking as reference the 
baseline  sum LD.  No  evaluable  lesion  may increase in size and no new lesion 
may appear.  
 
9.2.3 Stable  Disease  (SD):  Neither  PR or CR and in the absence of progression as 
defined below.  
 
9.2.4 Progressive Disease (PD) : Any increase  of 20%  in the sum  LD of target  lesions 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since treatment began; or the 
appearance of an unequivocally new lesion  on pre-operative restaging  studies or 
on post-operative surveillance studies. Worsening symptoms  clearly  
attributable to diseas e progression qualifies as progression e.g. worsening 
malignant bony pain. There are no biochemical definitions of progressive 
disease for this study.  
 
9.2.5 PSA criteria  for failure  to further respond: A failure  to further  decline or a rise 
in serum PSA concentration measured at four week intervals: A change in 
either will be considered  a 5 ng/ml or 25%  change  nadir  measurement.  
 
9.2.6 Progression -free survival (PFS)  and overall  survival  (OS) : The time from  
randomization to disease progression or death (if earlier than progression) will be 
referred to as progression -free survival. The time from randomization to death  
from any cause will be annotated as well.  Patients will be followed for PFS and 
OS, and will consist of phone call, an e-mail, or a review of medical and/or other 
records every 6 months (+/- 1 month).  
 
10.0 Criteria for Initial Randomization/Crossover/Discontinuation/Removal 
 
10.1 Criteria  for Initial Randomization:  Patients  will be randomized  after treatment on 
abiraterone acetate in combination with prednisone until composite progression is 
established  as defined by [CONTACT_97125]:  
 
1) PCWG2 criteria for progression(see  Appendix L) 
OR 
2) Failure to achieve PCWG2 response  by 8 weeks

Plateau of PSA as only manifestation of "progression"(Failure to further suppress PSA 
measured at 4 week intervals) - For PSA, less than 25% decrease from previous PSA for 
2 consecutive measurements. For PSA less than 5ng/ml, a single measurement  above 
1ng/ml following nadir is sufficient.  
 
If patients require dose reduction on two consecutive times or suffer from grade 3 or 
greater toxicity despi[INVESTIGATOR_97095], the patient will be taken off the study and will be counted as exhibiting progression. 
 
10.2 Criteria  for Crossover:  The criteria  for crossover  are progression by [CONTACT_43877]2  criteria  or 
excess toxicity  as defined  in criteria  for initial randomization 
 
10.3 Criteria  for Discontinuation of Therapy: Discontinuation of therapy  will either  occur  for 
progression or excessive toxicity. Progression criteria will include composite criteria 
which  includes  PSA working  group to criteria,  patients  withdrawal  from the study  due to 
failure.  
 
10.4 Criteria  for removal  from study: (a) Patient  withdrawal  of consent,  progressive disease, 
or investigator/PI [INVESTIGATOR_97096]; (b) Non-compliance by [CONTACT_97126]; (c) The development of unacceptable toxicity as defined in 
Section 8.0 or serious inter-current events. 
 
11.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
11.1 Preliminaries and Background: This is a randomized clinical trial to evaluate  and 
compare two two- stage treatment strategies for patients with castrate resistant prostate 
cancer that has progressed despi[INVESTIGATOR_97097]. The design is motivated 
by [CONTACT_97127]. The  
factors motivating the design include (1) the redundancy of these pathways for paracrine 
tumor survival, (2) the substantial variability between patients with regard to the 
likelihood and duration of response to any particular agent (3) the desire to obtain 
unbiased comparisons of clinical effects among three qualitatively different agents, (4) 
the desire to account for the common and a ppropriate clinical practice, when treating an 
individual patient, of switching away from an agent at the time of its clinical treatment 
failure and replacing it with a different agent and (5) the desire to account for effects of 
baseline patient covariates characterizing pathway activity levels.  
 
11.2 Treatment  Regimes:  Each patient’s  treatment  regime  will consist  of up to three  stages, 
indexed by s = 1, 2, 3. In stage s=1, all patients will receive  the CYP17  blocker  
Abiraterone acetate (A) alone. At the time of disease progression (defined below, in 
11.3) with A alone, the patient will be randomized between A + Dasatinib (D) or A +  
Sunitinib (S) for their stage s=2 treatment. The randomization will be dynamically  
balanced on three binary patient covariates using the method of Pocock and Simon [41]. 
The covariates are (i) quality if response to Abiraterone, defined as time to progression  
42 2010- 0070  
January 8, 2021  
Page 42 of 56  
  
being either > 3 months or < 3 months, (ii) alkaline phosphatase either > 120 or < 120, 
and (iii) performance status either 0, 1 or > 1. At the time of disease progression with the 
assigned treatment in stage s=2, the patient will be crossed over to the other stage 2 
treatment combination for treatment in stage s=3.  Consequently, two three -stage  
treatment regimes are possible, either (A, A+D, A+S) or (A, A+S, A+D). For brevity, since A is given in all three stages, below these two two -stage regimes will be denoted 
by (D, S) and (S, D). 
 
This randomization will be carried out using the Pocock-Simon software on the 
MDACC Biostatistics website https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/ClinicalTrialConduct . 
 
11.3 Outcomes: For the purpose of treatment evaluation, in each of the three stages of 
treatment, the following events are defined:  Composite disease progression is defined in 
Section 10.1. In any stage, treatment failure is defined as disease progression or death, 
whichever occurs first. The time to treatment failure in each stage is denoted by [CONTACT_97128]. 
From  the start of therapy,  overall survival (OS)  time is defined as the time to death  
. 
11.4 Primary  Outcome:  Comparison  of the two strategies (D, S) and (S, D) will be done  in 
terms  of the subgroup  of patients  for whom  the first failure  with A is disease 
progression.  For this purpose, the time to the final treatment  failure  will be recorded  
from the time of randomization, which is carried out at the start of stage 2. The primary outcome will be U = the time to final treatment failure starting from the time that 
treatment is initiated in stage 2 (randomization) after the patient’s disease has progressed on Abiraterone alone in stage 1. Consequently, aside from censoring, since only patients 
who progress but do not die in stage 2 proceed to stage 3, U equals either (i) the time to 
death in stage 2, or (ii) the time to progression in stage 2 plus the time to death or 
progression in stage 3. 
 
11.5 Group Sequential Design:  Based on historical experience, the null values of the mean 
time to failure  in each  of stages 2 and 3 are both 4 months and the probability  that the 
failure in stage 2 is a progression and not a death is .90. These give null value 7.6 
months for the mean of U = time to final failure, as defined. The primary goal will be to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two strategies in terms of these two means. A two -sided group-sequential log rank testing procedure will be 
used [41], with one interim test and possibly a second, final test, having overall size .[ADDRESS_107127] a 75% increase in the mean from 7.6 to 13.3 months. O’Brien- 
Fleming boundaries will be used, with the null hypothesis of no treatment difference 
rejected if the absolute value of the observed Z -score computed from the log rank 
statistic, |Z
obs|, is larger than the Z- score test cut -off in the following table.  
[ADDRESS_107128] 1  68 +/- 2.[ADDRESS_107129] 2  136 +/- 1.9686  
 
Based on an assumed accrual rate of 7 patients per month, and assuming that  
approximately 90% of all patients progress with A and thus 6 patients per month are 
randomized between A+D and A+S in stage 2, the expected trial duration will be 35 
months with total expected accrual (1.1)x153 = 168 patients under the alternative and 
(1.1)x 164 = [ADDRESS_107130] version 5 (Cytel Corporation), [42].  
 
11.6 Safety Monitoring: For the purpose of safety monitoring, toxicity will be defined as 
grade [ADDRESS_107131] 3 months  from the start of 
treatment. Denote the probability of this event by [CONTACT_64921]. Based on clinical experience 
and judgment, a toxicity rate  of 0.05 will be considered acceptably  low while  a toxicity  
rate of 0.16 or higher will be considered unacceptably high. Assuming that p TOX follows 
a non- informative beta(.05, .95) prior, the trial will be terminated early if the following 
Bayesian criterion for excessive toxicity is met, with the criterion applied  starting when 
[ADDRESS_107132] been accrued and their toxicity evaluated at 3 months, and at every 20th 
patient thereafter, up to a maximum of 180 patients. The trial will be stopped early if Prob(p
TOX > 0.05 | data) > 0.98. This translates to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_97098] [number of 
patients with toxicity]/ [number of patients evaluated for toxicity] is greater than or  
equal to 4/20, 6/40, 8/60, 10/80, 11/100, 13/120, 14/140, or 15/160. If the true value of p
TOX is 0.16 then the probability that this rule will stop the trial early is > .[ADDRESS_107133] will be reduced to .90 x (1- .04) = .[ADDRESS_107134] three patients of the combination study (post 
initial randomization), if grade III or higher toxicity is observed, that is possibly 
attributed to the agents, the combination will be held. If two or more grade III toxicities possibly attributed to the drugs are observed in the first six patients, the arm will be held 
until further assessment. The overall trial will continue with patients on the alternative arm. 
 
 
11.7 Detailed  Notation  for Patient  Outcomes:

11.7.1 Death  
A patient’s treatment is continued from stage [ADDRESS_107135] treatment failure are T 1, T1 
+T2, and T1 +T2+T3, respectively. Since a patient’s therapy may end at any time due to 
Death,  denote the indicator that Ts is the time of disease progression rather than a death 
time by [CONTACT_97129], for s=1, 2, 3. In particular, (Y 2 , T 2 , Y 3, T3) are defined only if Y 1 = 1 and 
(Y3, T3) are defined only if Y 2= Y 1 = 1. Denote the time in stage s=1 to treatment  
failure or death by T o, so that T o = T if Y = 1 or T o is the time of death if Y = 0 at 
stage s=1. Similarly, the time from T 1 to second treatment failure is T o, with T o = T if 
Y2 = 1 or T o the time of death if Y = 0 at stage s=2. Finally, the time from T to 
treatment failure is T o, with T o = T if Y = 1 or T o the time of death if Y = 0 at stage 
s=3. 
 
11.7.2 Overall final failure  time:  The time to final failure  from the start of therapy with 
A is T = T 1 + Y 1(T2 + Y 2T3 ) = T 1 + Y 1T2 + Y 1Y2T3 . Thus, the overall  final  
failure time from the start of therapy equals:  
• T1 if Y 1=0, which  is death  on A in stage 1 before  randomization 
between A+S and A+D in stage s=2, 
• T1 + T 2 if Y 1=1 and Y2 = 0, which is progression with A followed  by 
[CONTACT_97130] A+S and A+D followed by [CONTACT_97131] 
• T1 + T 2 + T 3 if Y 1= Y 2=1, which is progression with A followed  by 
[CONTACT_97130] A+S and A+D followed by [CONTACT_97132] 2 treatment combination followed by [CONTACT_97133] a 
failure of any type in stage 3. The 4 weeks washout period between 
stage 2 and 3 (see section 5.0) will be included in TTF. 
 
11.7.3 Response:  For evaluating  the effects  of A in stage 1, response  will be defined  as 
non-increasing  PSA as measured  at 8 weeks  compared  to baseline.  
 
11. 8 Failure times following randomization between A+S and A+D: For comparing the 
two strategies (D, S) and (S, D), we will consider  the subgroup of patients  for whom  the 
first failure with A is disease progression (Y 1=1) and start at the time of randomization, 
which is the start of stage 2. In this subgroup, we will use as primary outcome variable 
the time from randomization  to final failure  defined as U = T 2 + Y 2T3. Thus, U = T 2 if 
Y2 = 0, which is Death before crossover, and U = T 2 + T 3 if Y 2=1, which is progression 
with the stage  2 treatment  combination  followed  by [CONTACT_97134] a failure  (P or 
Death)  in stage  3. An essential  point  regarding evaluation  of U is that U may be 
censored by [CONTACT_11339]- f ailure events C in either stage 2 or stage 3

 11.81 Parameters. Denote µ s = E(Ts) for s=1,2,3 and π s = Pr(Ys=1) for s = 1,2. The 
mean overa ll final failure time is µ T = E{T} = E{T 1 + Y 1(T2 +Y 2 T3)} = E{T 1 } 
+ Pr(Y 1= 1)E{T 2 +Pr(Y 2=1) E(T 3)} = µ1 + π1 µ2 + π1 π2 µ3. The mean final 
failure time from randomization is E(U) = µU = E(T 2 +Y 2 T3) = µ2 + π2 µ3. 
 
11.8.[ADDRESS_107136]  for 
evaluation and comparison of the two strategies (D,S) and (S,D) is E(U) = µ U = 
µ2 +  π2 µ3., the mean  time from randomization  to final failure  in either  stage [ADDRESS_107137] for 
evaluation  and comparison of the two strategies (D,S)  and (S,D)  is E(T 2) = µ2, 
the mean  time from randomization  to first failure  in stage 2. 
 
11.9 Data Analyses: The distributions of Y1, Y2 and Y3 will be estimated using logistic 
regression. The unadjusted distributions of T1, T2 and T3 and of the composite times T = 
T1 + Y 1(T2 +Y 2 T3) and U = T 2 + Y 2T3 will be estimated using Kaplan- Meier (KM) 
plots [43]. For each  time, an appropriate time -to-event regression model  determined  
by [CONTACT_97135]-of- fit analyses will be fit to account for treatment strategies and patient 
covariates [44]. Denote the stage 2 and stage 3 treatments by τ2 and τ 3, each equal to  
either D = Dasatinib or S = Sunitinib. Thus, (τ2,τ3) = (D,S) or (S,D). To account for 
the effects of the stage 2 treatment, τ 2, on Y2 and T2, the linear terms of the logistic 
model  for Pr(Y 2 = 1) and of the event -time regression  model  for T2 will be of the general 
form β2Z2 + γ2 I(τ2 = D), where β2Z2 denotes a linear combination of patient 
covariates and γ2 is the D -versus- S effect on the stage 2 outcome. Similarly, to account 
for the effects of the treatment pair (τ2, τ3) given at stages 2 and 3 on the stage 3 
outcome, the linear terms of the logistic model for Pr(Y 3 = 1) and of the event -time 
regression model for T3 will be of the general form β3Z3 + γ3 I(τ 2 = D, τ 3 = 
S),where β 3Z3 is a linear combination of patient covariates and γ3 is the (D,S)- 
versus- (S,D) effect on the stage 3 outcome. The covariate vectors Z2 and Z3 are indexed 
by [CONTACT_97136], and this includes the possibility that T2 or possibly 
log (T2) will be used as a covariate in Z 3. Thus, there are two treatment effects, the D - 
versus- S between -treatment effect γ 2 on the stage 2 outcomes and the (D,S)-versus- (S,D) 
between -strategy effect γ 3 on the stage 3 outcomes. These estimates will be used, in turn, 
to estimate the mean of the primary outcome, the time to overall failure,  
specifically the mean of U = T 2 + Y 2T3 , for each of the two strategies (D,S) and (S,D).

13.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  (SAE)  
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or the sponsor, it re sults in any of the following outcomes: 
 
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places 
the patient,  in the view  of the initial reporter,  at immediate  risk of death  from  the 
adverse experience as it occurred.  It does  not include an adverse experience that, 
had it occurred  in a more  severe  form,  might have  caused  death. 
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity or  substantial  disruption of  the ability  to 
conduct  normal  life functions. 
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect.  
[ADDRESS_107141] and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development of drug  dependency or 
drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).  
 
• Important  medical  events as defined  above,  may also be considered  serious  
adverse events. Any important medical event can and should be reported as an 
SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_9476], 
IND Office.  
 
• All events  occurring  during  the conduct  of a protocol and meeting  the definition 
of a SAE  must  be reported  to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes  and 
procedures outlined in “The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center 
Institutional Review Board Policy for Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices”. Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, 
all SAEs, expected o r unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, regardless 
of attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event). 
 
• All life-threatening or  fatal  events,  that are unexpected, and related  to the  study 
drug, must have a written report submitted within 24 hours (next working day) 
of knowledge  of the event to the Safety  Project Manager  in the IND Office.  
 
• Unless  otherwise  noted, the electronic  SAE  application  (eSAE)  will be utilized 
for safety  reporting  to the IND Office  and MDACC  IRB.  
 
• Serious adverse events  will be captured  from  the time of the first protocol - 
specific  intervention, until [ADDRESS_107142] returned to baseline,  
progression of the event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of  
the event.  
49 2010- 0070  
January 8, 2021  
Page 49 of 56  
  
• Additionally,  any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_107143] be reported to the IND Office. This 
may include  the development of a secondary  malignancy. 
 
Reporting to FDA:  
 
• Serious adverse  events  will be forwarded  to FDA by [CONTACT_9533]  (Safety 
Project Manager  IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32.  
 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_97102], Good Clinical 
Practices, the protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional  
Review Board policy. 
 
 
13.3 Investigator Communication  with Supporting Companies: 
 
Toxicities are to be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0.  
 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in th e study, all SAEs must be 
collected,  including those  thought to be associated  with protocol- specified  procedures. 
Collection of all SAEs must continue for [ADDRESS_107144]  be collected  that relate  to any later  
protocol -specified procedure (eg, a follow -up skin biopsy). The investigator should 
notify the supporting companies of any SAE occurring after this time period that is 
believed to be related to the investigational product or protocol -specified  procedure. 
 
All SAEs, whether considered related or unrelated to dasatinib, must be reported to 
BMS (by [CONTACT_1719]) within [ADDRESS_107145] be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC on a 
quarterly basis.  The summary of non-serious AEs should include a listing of: Patient ID, 
AE term (uncoded), severity, relationship to abiraterone acetate, and action taken with abiraterone acetate.  
 
Additionally, all SAEs, whether considered related or unrelated to abirate rone acetate, 
must be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC (by [CONTACT_1719]) within [ADDRESS_107146] be kept on file at the study site.  
50 2010- 0070  
January 8, 2021  
Page 50 of 56  
  
All SAEs should be faxed or emailed to the following supporting companies: 
 
Global Pharmacovigilance & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_34237] -Myers Squibb Company 
Fax Number: [PHONE_188] 
Email: [EMAIL_178]

Fax #: [PHONE_065] 
 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to the investigational product but 
is potentially related to the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous  
therapy, or a complication of a study procedure), the potential relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE report. 
 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to the investigational 
product, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within [ADDRESS_107147] result should be reported as an adverse event are as follows:  
 
1. Test result  is associated  with accompanying symptoms,  and/or 
2. Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
(merely  repeating  an abnormal  test, in the absence of any of the above  conditions, 
does  not meet  criteria  for reporting  and an AE),  and/or 
3. Test result  leads to a change  in study  dosing  or death  from the study,  significant 
additional  concomitant  drug treatment or other  therapy, and/or  
4. Test result  leads to any of the outcomes  included in the definition  of a serious 
adverse event, and/or 
5. Test result  is considered  to be an adverse  event by [CONTACT_97139], even if it did meet one of the above conditions except for condition #4. Clinically significant laboratory results must be recorded in the patient’s CRF

STUDY PROCEDURES  Screening should be completed within [ADDRESS_292649] initial ictus  
(aSAH) .  Due to the emergent nature of vasospasm, a ll patients 
admitted with SAH secondary to a ruptured aneurysm that was 
secured with surgical clippi[INVESTIGATOR_240934] a 
Hunt and Hess Scale grade of 4 or less will proceed with screening. 
 
 
Protocol VS -002/E  CONFIDENTIAL  Vesalio  
  Page 5 of 92 Prior to screening, subjects (or their legal representative) will give 
inform ed consent.  Screening procedures  include relevant medical 
history, vital signs, pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240935] 
(mRS), NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS), non -contrast head CT -scan 
(NCCT ) to determine  ICH, concomitant medications, coagulation 
panel, and urine pregnancy test ( unless  already conducted at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517]; women of childbearing potential only) .  Laboratory testing 
does not need to be repeated if testing was performed within the past 
72 hour s.  The modified Fisher grade and Hunt -Hess grading system 
at time of aSAH will be documented.  
 
Note, the site will determine eligibility based on the in/exclusion 
criteria listed above.  Although, the core lab will assess specific 
parameters at Screening that are part of the eligibility criteria, the 
assessment by [CONTACT_240980].  
 
On Day 0, (day of the NeVa VS intervention), subjects with 
confirmed  vasospasm  (defined as > 50% stenosis in the ICA, basila r, 
MCA , ACA, or PCA  territory  as demonstrated by [CONTACT_240981]) 
within [ADDRESS_292650] distal size compatible 
segment.  The Neva VS device will be dep loyed from  a distal 
location to proximal location by [CONTACT_240982] -sheathing the 
device, retracting the microcatheter and unsheathing and re -sheathing 
more proximally until the entire size compatible, affected area has 
been treated.  A final  DSA will be performed at the end of the 
procedure to characterize the degree of narrowing in the treated 
portion of the target vessel.   Procedural complication s and procedural 
success will be documented.   Use of any balloon angioplasty 
intervention as a rescue ther apy is off -label and prohibited in this 
study. 
 
At 24 -hours ( ±6 hours) post intervention, a non- contrast head CT 
scan and TCD will be obtained as indicated. In addition, a NIHSS 
will be obtained.  Vital signs,  concomitant medications, and adverse 
events wi ll also be assessed.

Concomitant medications, and adverse events will be assessed.  
 
At Day 30 (±  7 days) post intervention (treatment with NeVa VS), 
mRS, and adverse events will be assessed .  
 
If vasospasm recurs in a previously treated segment or  in another 
(different) vessel / territory  or different segment of a previously 
treated vessel  after treatment of the initial vasospasm segment (s) but 
prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], treatment with the NeVa VS is allowed if 
the subject still meets all study entry criteria.  If a subject is retreated, 
he or she will be followed up for 30 more days  per the retreatment 
schedule in Appendix 1.  All treated areas will be imaged 
accordingly.

FOLLOWING ANEURYSMAL SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE (ASAH)  
In the US, the annual incidence of all strokes is 795,000.   Eighty- seven percent ( 87%) are 
ischemic , 10% are intracranial hemorrhage ( ICH) strokes, and  3% are SAH strokes .1  
Eighty- five percent (85%) of SAH is aneurysmal, with the remaining attributed to 
traumatic brain injury, vascular malformations, and to inflammatory and non- inflammatory 
lesions.2  The 24- hour mortality rate for aneurysmal SAH (aSAH) is 20%, with 10%  - 15% 
acute mortality before reaching the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and 10%  mortality within 24 hours of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .1,3,4  The majority of patients who survive to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240938] (coiling) or by [CONTACT_240984][INVESTIGATOR_007].  Delayed 
cerebral ischemia (DCI) can occur in up to 45% of patients 3- [ADDRESS_292674] 50% of the deaths following aSAH.24-26  
 
1.1. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY  
Cerebral vasospasm (CV) is strongly associated with DCI, and, although it is not the 
only contributing factor to poor clinical outcomes, it is the most important and 
potentially treatable cause of morbidity and mortality after aSAH.  As in other body 
syste ms, (e.g. coronary artery vasospasm ), vasospasm of arteries in the brain is 
thought to be precipi[INVESTIGATOR_216020] a confluence of multiple pathological processes that 
result in a reduction of nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability.  NO has a direct 
vasodilation effect and plays a significant role in modulating endogenous 
vasoconstrictive agents (e.g. production and release of endothelin- 1 [ET -1] and 
thromboxanes), and in mediating the inflammatory response.27   
 
In the coronary arteries, vasospasm may occur because of ischemic conditions, 
endothelial cell damage, and oxidative stress.  In the brain, the main driver of  
vasospasm is thought to be the release of ferrous hemoglobin and erythrocyte 
contents through hemolysis during the initial ictus.  NO is upregulated in response to 
the insult.  However, the large amount of extracellular hemoglobin and other blood 
products i n the subarachnoid space are thought to reduce NO bioavailability by 
[CONTACT_240985] “sink”.  Additionally, in the context of this  exaggerated 
inflammation, excess NO production can be harmful.  Reactive nitrogen species 
(RNS), especially peroxynitrite, are capable of disrupting cellular metabolism, 
irreversibly damaging DNA, and ultimately causing cell death and damage to the 
adjacent cortex .27-[ADDRESS_292675].30  
 
The severity of the vasospasm is related to volume, density and persistence of the 
initial subarachnoid thrombus, the degree of early brain injury, and to other 
underlying conditions that can reduce brain oxygen.31  Severe vasospasm (> 50% 
narrowing) within the DCI window (at approx. day [ADDRESS_292676] ictus) is highly suggestive 
of poor clinical outcomes.15,31,32  Prophylactic treatment  with calcium channel 
blockers (both oral and targeted infusion) are often administered with the aim of

prevention of se condary DCI, particularly by [CONTACT_240986].15,24,25,34 -37 The only FDA approved drug for the treatment of aSAH is oral 
nimodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (tablet and suspension) and it is a class I recommendation. †24,25,[ADDRESS_292678] been granted

but neither approach has been approved.38-[ADDRESS_292679] of care guidelines issued over the decades 
by [CONTACT_14808].24,42,43  Hyperdynamic therapy with induced 
hypertens ion, and augmentation of cardiac output using inotropic drugs has also 
shown some efficacy.24,25,41  Intra -arterial treatments such as luminal angioplasty are 
conducted using cardiac devices off -label [ (Sprinter Legend balloon (Medtronic ), 
Maverick ([LOCATION_011] Scientific ), Gateway ([LOCATION_011] Scientific)  and Scepter XC 
(Microvention) ] with some success.44-46  NeuroFlo, a dual aortic balloon device was 
developed specifi cally for treatment of DCI by [CONTACT_240987] H030005 , but is no longer available in commercial 
distribution . 
 
 
1.3. UNMET CLINICAL NEED  
DCI continues to occur in up to 45% of patients post aSAH despi[INVESTIGATOR_240939].  It  is associated with a substantial burden on health care resources, most of 
which  are related to long -term care and loss of productivity, as half of the patients 
affected are under the age of 55.1,2,9,11,[ADDRESS_292680] discussed in the peer -reviewed 
literature in 1984,54 and has steadily gained acceptance as a viable treatment option 
for patients th at fail maximal medical therapy.  Due to the low incidence of this 
condition, however, cerebral angioplasty has not been studied in an adequately 
powered controlled randomized study.  Nonetheless, the reported neurological

artery causes a ‘controlled injury.’  The stretch can cause endothelial denudation, 
fracture o f the intima, medial thinning and tearing of the adventitia.  These 
mechanical effects alter the connections between the smooth muscle cells in the 
media and their elastic fibers.

Several studies have demonstrated that arterial dilatation decreases arterial 
contractility and some have seen arterial paralysis.[ADDRESS_292682] is both mechanical and biochemical.  The 
mechanical overstretching causes a paralytic injury,56,57 while the disconnection of 
the endothelium eliminates the local release of endothelium derived vasoconstricting 
factors (e.g. ET -1, thromboxanes) and  disrupts the calcium channel inputs into the 
media.[ADDRESS_292683] proximal vessel segments ; internal carotid and 
vertebrobasilar arteries  and the first segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) .

procedure may further harm an already ischemic brain.  
 
Stent Retriev er Based Angioplasty -  A New Approach for Managing CV .  The use of 
stent retrievers (stentrievers) to cause vasodilation in patients with delayed cerebral 
vasospasm secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage was recently published.60 The 
small proof of concept case series (4 patients) rep orted the use of the Solitaire and 
Capture stent retrievers to safely achieve vasodilation with long- lasting therapeutic 
effect (> 24 hours).  In two of the cases, stent angioplasty resulted in a reversal of 
focal neurological symptoms. 
 
The advantages of using a stent retriever over a balloon to dilate spastic cerebral 
arteries post aSAH include:  
 
• better maneuverability and safer deployment into distal and posterior segments;  
• controlled dilation using the intrinsic outward radial force, (as opposed to a fixed 
diameter expansion in balloon angioplasty which is operator dependent and can 
result in vessel rupture ); and  
• the intervention is conducted without occluding blood flow to already severely 
compromised ischemic tissues.  
 
 
 
1.5. STUDY GOALS  
The objective of this study is to assess the safety and probable benefit  of the NeV a 
VS device (a modified stent retriever)  in patients presenting with symptomatic 
cerebral vasospasm despi[INVESTIGATOR_240940]. 
 
 
 
 
2. NEVA VS DEVICE DESCRIPTION AND PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION  
The Vesalio NeVa™ VS device is a neuro mechanical percutaneously introduced 
transluminal cerebral dilatation device.  The desig n of the NeVa VS is based on the 
common design for stentrievers (e.g., TREVO Retrievers (DEN150049) and Solitaire 
Revascularization Device (K162539)).  
 
2.1. DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
The NeVa VS device has a self -expanding nitinol stent -like scaffolding tip attached 
to a nitinol push wire.  The device can only be delivered through a Trevo Pro 18 
Microcatheter .  
  
 
Protocol VS -002/E  CONFIDENTIAL  Vesalio  
  Page 17 of 92   
Figure 2.  NeVa VS device  
 
When deployed at the target treatment area, the tip (which was compressed in the 
microcatheter), expands into its original shape in the artery and applies expansive 
radial forces to the wall of the artery.  The NeVa VS can be deployed in the M1 and 
M2 branches of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), intracranial internal carotid artery 
(ICA), intracranial vertebral artery, basilar artery, and the P1 posterior cerebral artery 
(PCA).  
 
The device is provided sterile and is intended for single -use only. 
 
2.1.1. THE EXPANDABLE TIP 
The expa ndable tip on the distal end of the NeVa VS is constructed of a tubular 
scaffolding laser cut from Nitinol tube stock.  It has tapered distal and proximal ends 
and a proprietary scaffolding design to optimize expansive radial forces for effective 
dilation force.  Figure 3 depi[INVESTIGATOR_240941]. 
 
 
Figure 3.  NeVa VS Expandable tip  
 
The total length of the NeVa VS tip is 35 mm, the length of the fully expanded 
diameter is 22 mm with 4mm of gradual taper on either side.  The expanded outside 

 
Protocol VS -002/E  CONFIDENTIAL  Vesalio  
  Page 18 of 92 diameter is 4 mm and the device configuration can be deployed in vessels with a pre -
vasospasm diameter from 2.0 – 4.0 mm.  
 
The design of the expandable tip integrates the following set of key features:  
 
• Radiopaque markers positioned on the structure at proximal and distal ends to 
ensure fluoroscopic visualization during placement;  
• Gradual double ended taper as opposed to a uniform diameter (as seen in other 
stent retrievers) to allow for a more distal deployment in a vessel; 
• Two central twisting tethers in the middle of the tip (see Figure 4).  This feature 
provides enhanced flexibility and maneuverability, particularly if the vasospasm 
is occurring in a branched segment of the vasculature.  
 
 
Figure 4.  NeVa VS Central tw isting tether design  
 
Two versions of the NeVa VS are available.  They only differ in the configuration of 
radiopaque markers for fluoroscopic visualization on the tip.  Both versions have a 1 
mm radiopaque marker coil (92% Platinum/ 8% Tungsten) at the pr oximal end.  Both 
also have a radiopaque marker coil on the distal end. The standard NeVa VS has the 
same 1 mm radiopaque marker on the distal end as on the proximal end.  The 
enhanced visualization version has an extended radiopaque marker coil that is 5 mm 
in length (same materials and radial dimensions, only 4 mm longer). An illustration of 
the two (2) distal end marker coils is provided in Figure 5.

Protocol VS -002/E  CONFIDENTIAL  Vesalio  
  Page 19 of 92 Both distal radiopaque markers (standard and extended) provide visual indication 
under fluoroscopy, however, the extended marker is available for clinicians that 
prefer enhanced visualization. 
 
2.1.2. PUSHER ASSEMBLY  
The pusher assembly is comprised of an introducer and delivery pusher that are used 
to deliver the expandable tip to the treatment site.  
 
 
Figure 6.  NeVa VS Pusher Assembly  
 
The introducer consists of a polymer tube that protects the device and distal segment 
of the delivery pusher from damage.  When firmly seated in the hub of the 
microcatheter, the introducer creates an uninterrupted passage for the device to be 
advanced through the microcatheter.  
 
 
 
2.2. PROPOSED INDICATIONS FOR USE 
The NeVa VS is intended for the treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage 
patients who experience symptomatic vasospasm despi[INVESTIGATOR_240942] . 
 
 
2.3. PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION  
The NeVa VS is a percutaneously introduced transluminal cerebral artery dilatation 
device that is temporarily inserted into the cerebral vasculature for the dilation of 
targeted vessels to treat SAH induced vasospasm.  The overall operation and 
deployment of the NeVa VS follows the same basic principles and procedures as for 
use of stentrievers.  However, instead of deploying the expandable tip to remove a 
thrombus, deployment of the expandable tip is intended to apply a controlled 
expansive radial force to  dilate a spastic artery.  Following is a description of the 
device operation.  A discussion of the scientific rationale for mechanical dilatation 
for the treatment of CV can be found in Section 1.4.

1) A suitable guide catheter is placed in the vessel close to the targeted site (s). 
Using an appropriate guidewire, a microcatheter is advanced to the target vessel 
and then the catheter tip is positioned distal to the target site with sufficient space 
to deploy the NeVa VS into the target vessel.  The guidewire is retrieved, and the 
position of the catheter is confirmed used angiographic techniques.  
 
Figure 7.  Microcat heter Navigation to the Target Vessel  
 
2) The NeVa VS device is transferred into the microcatheter and then advanced 
within the catheter using the push wire.  With aid of fluoroscopic monitoring, the 
NeVa VS expandable tip is advanced until its distal markers  line up with the end 
of the catheter.  
 
Figure 8.  Advancement of the NeVa VS in a Target Vessel  
 
3) The NeVa VS is deployed by [CONTACT_240988].  The catheter is retracted until the 
catheter tip is just proximal of the proximal marker on the expandable tip.

Figure 9.  Deployment of the NeVa VS in a Target Vessel, including placement in 
artery branch (right)  
 
4) Once deployed in the target vessel, the scaffolding structure of the NeVa VS tip 
intrinsically expands, providing a slow, controlled dilation. 
 
Figure 10.  Example of Dilation Forces with the NeVa VS  
 
5) As needed, the stent can be resheathed back into the microcatheter and 
redeployed in the target vessel at additional multiple locations based on the 
judgement of the healthcare provider.  
6) After sufficient deployments of the stent  have been performed in the target 
vessel, the device is retrieved i nto guide catheter as the device is completely 
retracted.

2.3.1. VASODILATION WITH THE NEVA VS  
The NeVa VS device design is a modification of the stent retrievers currently 
available in commercial distribution (Solitaire, Trevo) which have been safely used 
for a number of years for mechanical thrombectomy in ischemic stroke.  The design 
features of the NeVa VS are com pared to these stentrievers in Table 1.

Available Solitaire, and Trevo Stent Retrievers

† Bench testing results  
 
Unlike other stent retrievers which have a uniform diameter across the stent segment 
that cause a ‘ledge’ effect at the interface with the spastic segment, the NeVa VS’s 
tapered dis tal end provides a more gentle and anatomically conforming dilatation 
process.   
 
Current stent retrievers also have a high compressive radial force (the force required 
to externally compress the device) and a very low expansive radial force (force of 
stent expanding upon deployment), particularly at diameters over 2mm.  The NeVa  

 
Protocol VS -002/E  CONFIDENTIAL  Vesalio  
  Page [ADDRESS_292684] radial force of the device (in contrast to balloon 
catheters which can  be expanded to a pre -fixed diameter)  and performing the dilation 
over longer periods up to several  minutes ( as opposed seconds  for a balloon 
catheter) , the potential for injury to the vessel is  reduced .  
 
Finally, two additional design enhancements make the NeVa VS more suitable for 
treating CV: 
 
• The NeVa VS has two large twisting tethers in the middle of the stent which 
allow the device to be deployed into two branch points around bends in the artery 
without causing significant deformation. And,  
• the NeVa VS has a proximal taper which allows the deployed device to be 
withdrawn from a distal position to a more proximal position and to sequentially 
dilate the vessel.  
 
2.3.2. PRECLINICAL DATA 
The ability of the NeVa VS to safely dilate vasospastic arteries was demonstrated in 
a small GLP study in the juvenile porcine model.  Three (3) Yorkshire crossbred 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_240943].  The porcine model was chosen 
because the animals have similar arterial sizes as humans and have similar 
hemodynamic properties that could affect device use.  In addition, the selected 
animal model has  similar vessel wall thickness, smooth muscle reactivity, and 
clotting processes to humans.  Two (2) of the animals were used for acute evaluation 
and one (1) for chronic evaluation. 
 
The following test and control devices were tested as part of this study:  
 
• NeVa VS (test article)  
• Trevo XP 4x20 stent retriever (control article)  
• Maverick angiopl asty balloon (control article)  
 
Three (3) test articles and three (3) control articles were deployed in separate target 
arteries in each animal.  NeVa VS test articles were deployed in all three (3) animals, 
two (2) for acute and one (1) for chronic evalua tion.  The Trevo XP was deployed in 
a single animal for acute comparison to the NeVa VS and the Maverick balloon 
catheter was deployed in two (2) animals for both acute and chronic comparison to 
the NeVa VS.  
 
There were no complications noted during insert ion, deployment, or retraction for 
any of the test or control articles deployed.  A total of [ADDRESS_292685] article were performed evenly over 9 arteries (across 3 animals).  For 
 
Protocol VS -002/E  CONFIDENTIAL  Vesalio  
  Page 24 of 92 the Maverick control article, a total of 36 deployments  were performed evenly over 6 
arteries (across 2 animals).  With the Trevo control article , a total of 18 deployments 
were performed over 3 arteries (a single animal).  No mechanical damage was 
observed with any of the test or control articles during the procedure.  There were no 
incidents of vessel perforation.  All three (3) animals remained stable under 
anesthesia without complications and survived to the end of the procedure.   
 
After deployment of each test and control article at the treatment sites, v arious 
degrees of spasm were observed.  Overall for the NeVa VS, spasm was temporary in 
all cases and recovered to a baseline level (Score = 0) in 7 of 9 treatment sites and to 
a Score = 1 (10% slight narrowing) and Score = 2 (27% moderate narrowing) for t he 
two remaining sites.  In comparison, for the Trevo controls all three treatment sites 
only recovered to a Score = 1 (21%, 24%, and 23% narrowing) and for the Maverick 
controls only 1 of 6 recovered to a baseline level, with two (2) of the sites recoveri ng 
to a Score of 1 and the remaining three (3) sites recovering to a Score = 2.  Mean 
vessel scores after 60 minutes were 0.33 for NeVa VS, 1.0 for Trevo, and 1.33 for 
Maverick  devices.  Based on these results, the arteries treated with the NeVa VS 
exhibit ed a lower level of vasospasm.  In general, swine arteries are susceptible to 
vasospasm, and the results seen here are comparable with other thrombectomy 
devices used in swine. This expected result was determined to not pose a significant 
safety risk.  
 
Histological findings did not reveal any significant downstream tissue effects.  In 
addition, observations from the pathological evaluation demonstrate that the NeVa 
VS had lower or similar scores for minor and superficial injuries to treatment vessels  
than t he other devices .  Based on the results of the study, the deployment of the 
NeVa VS appears to be safe with no evidence of downstream effects and 
successfully meets the usability criteria for the device.

The interventio nal procedure with the NeVa VS device will be performed as 
follows:   
The NeVa VS device is a percutaneously introduced transluminal cerebral 
vasodilatation device that is temporarily inserted into the cerebral vasculature for the 
dilation of targeted spas tic vessels with controlled expansive radial force.  The Neva 
VS device will be navigated to the most distal size compatible location of the

[CONTACT_240982] -sheathing the device, retracting the microcatheter and 
unsheathing and re -sheathing more proximally until the entire  size compatible 
affected area has been treated.  A final DSA will be performed at the end of the 
procedure to characterize the degree of narrowing in the treated segment(s) of the 
target vessel . Procedural complications and procedural success will be documented. 
 
At 24 -hours ( ± 6 hours) post intervention, imaging to determine ICH ( NCCT ), TCD 
and NIHSS will be obtained.  Vital signs, concomitant medications, and adverse

[IP_ADDRESS]. DIGITAL SUBTRACTION ANGIOGRAPHY (DSA)  
DSA including AP and LAT views with late arterial phase in lateral view, will be 
obtained at the beginning of the intervention, and  at the end of the procedure.   Take 
all necessary precautions to limit X -radiation doses to patients and themselves by 
[CONTACT_240990], reducing fluoroscopy times, and modifying X -ray 
technical factors where possible.  
 
The DSAimaging study will be reviewed and assessed by a n indepe ndent core 
laboratory after the procedure .   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT  
Administer intravenous sedation or general anesthesia, as appropriate, to ensure 
subject safety and comfort.    
 
Systemic anticoagulation with heparin may be used during the procedure  at the 
discretion of the neurointerventionist .  Use of IV or IA antiplatelets is strongly 
discouraged.  
 
The Neva VS device is a percutaneously introduced into the cerebral vasculature for 
the dilation of targeted spastic vessels with controlled expansive radial force.  The 
Neva VS device will be navigat ed to the most distal size compatible ( ≥ 2.0mm and ≤ 
4.0mm diameter on baseline DSA) location of the affected area.  The Neva VS 
device will be deployed from distal location to proximal location by [CONTACT_240991], 
controlled dilation, and re -sheathing the device, retracting the microcatheter and 
unsheathing, dilation  and re -sheathing more proximally until the entire affected 
vascular territory has been treated.  Do not to advance or withdraw the device 
against resistance or significant vasospasm as moving or t orqueing of the device 
against resistance or significant vasospasm may result in damage to the vessel or 
device.  
 
A final DSA will be performed at the end of the procedure to characterize the degree

5.2.1. VITAL SIGNS  
Vital signs consisting of blood pressure (supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), temperature, weight  (at Screening 
only) , heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_240952] [ADDRESS_292709] score 
(ASPECTS) will be determined.  The ASPECTS score is a [ADDRESS_292710] scan score, determined from evaluation of two standardized regions 
of the MCA territory: the basal ganglia level, where the thalamus, basal ganglia, and 
caudate are visible, and the supraganglionic level, which includes the corona radiata 
and centrum semiovale.  All cuts with basal ganglionic or supraganglionic structures 
visible are required to determine if an area is involved.  The abnormality should be 
visible on at least two consecutive cuts to ensure that it is truly abnormal rather than 
a volume averaging effect.  To compute the ASPECTS, 1 point is subtracted from  10 
for any evidence of early ischemic change for each of the defined regions ( Figure 
12).

5.2.3. TRANSCRANIAL DOPPLER  (TCD)  
AHA/ASA guidelines indicate that it is reasonable to monitor for the development of 
arterial vasospasm following aSAH.25 Transcranial Doppler provides a noninvasive 
method for recording blood flow velocity (and indirectly, diameter) in the basal 
cerebral arteries and therefore is especially useful in detecting v asospasm following 
subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Vasospasm most commonly involves the basal arteries, 
where the changes in vessel diameter will be inversely proportional to the mean 
velocity measurements.  Examination of patients requires that the examiner be 
experienced and familiar with the vascular anatomy and the various TCD indicators  
of vasospasm.  For example, n ormal mean velocity for the MCA is 62 +/ - 12 cm/sec. 
Significant spasm on angiogram of the MCA corresponds to a mean velocity of 120 
cm/sec.  Mean velocities of the MCA of 200 cm/sec or greater indicate severe spasm 
and correlate with 50% or greater narrowing on angiogram .[ADDRESS_292712] of care.  Patients with suspected vasospasm on TCD will be asked to 
participate in the study.  Vasospasm of > 50% for study eligibility can only be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_240998].  Following the index procedure, TCD will be performed at [ADDRESS_292713] Angiography has been increasingly used as a  noninvasive  tool to diagnostic 
vasospasm with a relatively high degree of accuracy and may be used a study 
screening tool. However, for purposes of study eligibility, vasospasm of > 50% must 
be confirmed by [CONTACT_240998]. 
 
5.2.5. DIGITAL SUBTRACTION ANGIOGRAPHY (DSA)  
DSA will be perf ormed at Screening to determine the extent of stenosis in the ICA, 
basilar, MCA , ACA or PCA territories.  Only subjects with > 50% in any of these 
territories will undergo the index procedure.  
 
At the intervention, DSA including AP and LAT views with late arterial phase in 
lateral view, will be obtained at the beginning of the intervention, and at the end of 
the procedure  and will be assessed by [CONTACT_240999] .  The 
DSAimaging study will  subsequently be reviewed and assessed by [CONTACT_241000].    
 
5.2.6. MODIFIED RANKIN SCALE (MRS) 
The mRS is provided in Table 4.  The mRS measures the degree of disability or 
dependence in daily activities.62  At screening, a pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (historic) mRS and 
current mRS will be obtained by [CONTACT_779].  At Day [ADDRESS_292714] aSAH or discharge

6. EVALUATION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
 
Protocol VS -002/E  CONFIDENTIAL  Vesalio  
  Page 39 of 92 6.1. DEFINITIONS  
An adverse e vent (AE) is the development of an untoward medical occurrence or 
the deterioration of a pre -existing medical condition following or during exposure to 
an investigational medical device, whether or not considered causally related to the 
investigational medical device.    
 
An untoward medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs 
(e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver) or clinically significant abnormal results of an 
investigation (e.g., laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  
 
Conditions or diseases that are chronic but stable should not be recorded as an AE .  
Changes in a chronic condition or disease that are consistent with natural disease 
progression are NOT considered AEs and should not be recorded on AE worksheets .  
These m edical conditions should be adequately documented on the appropriate page 
of the study worksheet  (relevant medical history ).  However, medical conditions 
present at enrollment that worsens in intensity or frequency in a manner inconsistent 
with the natural course of the disease during the treatment or post -treatment periods 
should be reported and recorded as AEs.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence which:  
• Result s in death;  
• Is life -threatening;  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4791] a stay > 24 hours) 
or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240953];  
• Results in permanent impairment of a bo dy function or permanent damage to a 
body structure; or  
• Requires medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a 
body function or permanent damage to a body structure.  
 
Additionally, important medical events that may not result in de ath, be life -
threatening or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240954].   
 
An unanticipated adverse device effect  (UADE) is  defined as any serious adverse 
effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in pred icate devices , or any 
other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the 
rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
 
6.2. ASSESSMENT OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AES) 
The need to capture AEs is not dependent upon whether or not the clinical event is 
associated with the use of the study device or procedure.  All AEs, regardless of 
 
Protocol VS -002/E  CONFIDENTIAL  Vesalio  
  Page [ADDRESS_292718] be 
recorded .  Events occurring prior to the endovascular  (Neva VS)  procedure must be 
listed in the medical history.  
 
The following information should be obtained for each AE:  
 
1. Event description.   Every effort must be made to report the underlying condition 
or unifying diagnosis for the event.  To avoid vague, ambiguous or colloquial 
expressions, the AE should be recorded in standard medical terminology rather than 
the subject’s own words when pos sible.  Signs and symptoms that are considered 
unrelated to an encountered syndrome or disease should be recorded as individual 
AEs on the CRF (e.g., if congestive heart failure and severe headache are observed at 
the same time, each event  should be record ed as an individual AE).   
 
In addition, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., sequelae) should be 
identified by [CONTACT_86187] (i.e., a "primary" AE, if clearly identifiable, generally 
represents the most accurate clinical term to record on AE  CRF; events occurring 
secondary to the primary event should be described in the narrative description of 
the case [e.g., example: orthostatic hypotension → fainting and fall to floor → head 
trauma →neck pain; the primary AE is orthostatic hypotension]).  
 
2. Duration: The date of onset and date of resolution should be reported.  Every 
effort should be made to capture the exact dates . 
 
3. Outcome:  The final status of the event should be reported as resolved, ongoing, 
or if it resulted in death.  If the event  is present at the final study visit, the ongoing 
box must be marked.  
 
4. Severity:  The worst severity of the event must be reported as mild, moderate, or 
severe using the following definitions:  
 
- Mild: Aware of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated 
- Moderate: Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity  
- Severe: Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity  
 
5. Action taken : Treatment of the event may be reported as none, medical and/or 
surgical.  
 
6. Seriousness:  Determined  by [CONTACT_143285] 5.1. 
 
7. Relationship to device  (study device or ancillaryi device) , and procedure / 
treatment .  The relationship to device and study procedure will be assessed using 
the following criteria.  
 
 
i Ancillary device includes microcatheter, guide catheter, or another device that is not the study device (Neva 
VS device)  
 
Protocol VS -002/E  CONFIDENTIAL  Vesalio  
  Page 41 of 92 Definitely Not 
Related  Evidence exists that the adverse event definitely has a cause other than 
the device/procedure under investigation (e.g. pre -existing condition 
or underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication) 
and does not meet any other criteria listed.  
Possibly Related  A temporal relationship exists between the event onset and the 
device/procedure under investigation.  Although the adverse event 
may appear unlikely to be related to the device/procedure under 
investigation, it cannot be ruled out with certainty; and/or the event 
cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or 
concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Definitely Related  Strong evidence exists that the device/procedure under investigation 
caused the adverse event.  There is a temporal relationship between 
the event onset and the device/procedure under investigation.  There is 
strong therapeutic evidence that the event was caused by [CONTACT_133238]/procedure under investigation. The subject’s clinical state and 
concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_166263] a cause.  
Unknown  Unable to make a determination on causality of the event. 
 
 
6.3. REPORTING /RECORDING OF AES 
Throughout the course of the study, all efforts will be made by [CONTACT_241002].  The first concern will be the safety of the subject , and 
for providing appropriate medical intervention.  The period of observation for 
colle ction of AEs starts  at index (Neva VS) procedure until the Day  30 follow -up 
visit.  Any AE should be recorded on the appropriate study worksheet . 
 
 
6.4. SAE S REQUIRING EXPEDITED REPORTING  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) that occur within [ADDRESS_292719] be reported within 3 wo rking days to the study 
Sponsor/Designee , by:  
 
• Completing the AE information in the Electronic Data Capture ( EDC) 
system  and selecting  appropriate criteria that classifies the AE as serious.   
• Completing and uploading the SAE form in the EDC.   
 
In order to have the Investigator’s signature [CONTACT_241039], the signed SAE form needs to be 
uploaded to the EDC at  the time of initial data entry.   
 
In case of death, the site will provide a copy of the death certificate and autopsy 
report, if applicable, to the Sponsor/Designee.  If no such documents are available, 
 
Protocol VS -002/E  CONFIDENTIAL  Vesalio  
  Page [ADDRESS_292720]’s death in the source 
document. 
   
The investigator must follow their local IRB policy for SAE reporting. 
 
The Sponsor/Designee will review all SAEs and suspected UADEs and determine if 
the SAE constitutes a UADE.   All UADEs will be reported to all reviewing IRBs 
and participating investigators within [ADDRESS_292721].  
 
 
6.5. ANTICIPATED COMPLICATIONS /AES 
Anticipated complications/AEs  are defined as complications/events that can be 
reasonably associated with aSAH  or the use of the  Neva VS  device .

7. STATISTICAL METHODS  
The primary goal of this study is to assess the safety and probable benefit  of the Neva VS 
device in patients presenting with symptomatic cerebral vasospasm despi[INVESTIGATOR_240956].  Sample size estimations were not based on formal 
statistical hypotheses testing because the patent population and annual incidence of 
symptomatic cerebral vasospasm after aSAH is less t han 8000 cases / year .  Hypothesis 
testing will not be performed on any endpoint.  
 
7.1. PATIENT CATEGORIZATION  
Screen Failure -  Any patient who was consented and entered into the screening 
process appropriately, but subsequently did not meet the entry criteria in order to be 
treated.  Patients who fail screening will not be followed for safety or feasibility 
assessment, and no other study procedures will be performed.  
 
Evaluable Patient  - Any patient who in whom the Neva VS procedure was started, 
defined as introduction of a Neva VS device into the vasculature (regardless of the 
ability to reach the target vessel.    
 
Lost to foll ow-up - A patient deemed to be lost to follow -up is any patient who 
underwent the Neva VS procedure, but who does not complete scheduled study 
visits.  This includes those patients who withdraw consent and refuse further study 
participation and all attempts to contact [CONTACT_241003]. 
 
 
7.2. STUDY OUTCOMES  
The following study outcomes will be determined in evaluable patients : 
 
• Procedural Success  - defined as 50% or greater vessel caliber on DSA compared 
to baseline, as determined by [CONTACT_89709].  
• Retreatment / additional treatment – the rate of retreatment or treatment of 
additional territories will be quantified.  
• Symptomatic Improvement -  for clinically symptomatic patients, a decrease at 
24 hours of ≥ 3- points from Screening as measured by [CONTACT_241004]/or resolution 
of pre -procedural clinical deficits.  
• Change in ASPECT Score  –change in ASPECT score on NCCT from Screening

7.3. SAFETY  
All evaluable patients will be included in the safety analyses.  Adverse events and 
serious adverse events will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
 
 
7.4. STATISTICAL ANAL YSES  
Descriptive statistics will be performed.  Categorical variables will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_16785].  Continuous variables 
will be summarized using n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum values.  
No statistical testing will be performed.  
 
 
 
 
 
8. IMAGING CORE LABORATORY  
The goal of the core lab is to provide unbiased assessment of DSA /CTA  imaging  obtained 
at the time of aSAH  presentation or  intervention and DSA obtained during the Neva  VS 
procedure.  Specifically, DSA including AP and LAT views with late arterial phase in 
lateral view, will be obtained at the beginning of the intervention with the Neva VS device , 
and at the end of the procedure.  These im ages will be sent to the core laboratory post -
procedure.  
 
The imaging procedures will be defined in the Core Lab Manual.  De -identified images will 
be sent directly from the site to the core lab.  
 
 
 
9. DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD (DSMB)  
The independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will periodically review a limited 
set of tables and/or listings, including all reported SAEs.  The objectives of the DSMB 
meetings are to review the safety outcomes of the study and provide guidance to Spons or 
regarding the safety of the NeVa VS system.  There will be no adjustment for multiple 
testing due to the DSMB data review.  Further details of DSMB responsibilities are 
included in the DSMB Charter.  
 
 
 
10. ACCESS TO STUDY DOCUMENTS AND STUDY MONITORING

  Page [ADDRESS_292723] a final visit (close -out) to 
the site.  The objectives of this visit are to ascertain that all regulatory records and reports 
are complete, verify that study drug and other supplies have been accounted for and ensure 
that the investigator is aware of his/her responsibilities post- study.  
 
 
 
11. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE  
The Sponsor  and/or its contracted representatives utilize Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOP s) designed to ensure that research procedures and documentation are consistently 
conducted/prepared to the highest quality standards.  These SOPs also require compliance 
with Health Authority regulations and Good Clinical Practice guidance.  
 
A quality a ssurance audit may be conducted by [CONTACT_241005] a study.  The Investigator will  be given adequate notice if 
he/she is selected for an audit.  The audit will include, but is not limited to, a review of all 
informed consent forms, source documents, medical records, regulatory documentation, an 
assessment of study conduct and protocol c ompliance, and a review of the investigational 
drug accountability.  At the conclusion of an audit, the auditor will conduct a brief meeting 
with the Investigator to review the findings of the audit. 
 
11.1. TRAINING  
Each site will be trained to the investigation al plan prior to performing any study-
related procedures.  Procedure training will be completed by [CONTACT_241006]/Clinical Specialist in both a classroom and simulated environment and 
may include use of an in- vitro or in- vivo model.    
 
 
 
 
12. INSTI TUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB)  
Prior to the initiation of the study, the protocol, and the informed consent form will be 
submitted to the IRB for approval.  By [CONTACT_143291],  the investigator 
 
Protocol VS -002/E  CONFIDENTIAL  Vesalio  
  Page [ADDRESS_292724] once a year (or more frequently as 
required by [CONTACT_1201]) and the IRB must be notified of completion or termination of the 
study.  A final report must be provided to the IRB and the Sponsor  within 2 months  of 
study completion or termination.  This report should include: any deviations from the 
protocol, the number of participants evaluated, the number of participants who withdrew or 
were withdrawn and the reasons for withdrawal, any significant AEs  and the investigator's 
summation of the study. 
 
 
 
13. INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to inform each subject  or his/her legal 
representative, prior to the screening evaluation, of the purpose of this clinical trial, 
including poss ible risks and benefits and document the informed consent process in the 
subject ’s chart.  A sample informed consent form containing the required elements of 
informed consent is provided in Appendix 2.  Any changes made to this sample must be 
approved by [CONTACT_39987], prior to submission to an IRB.  After approval by 
[CONTACT_39987], the informed consent must be submitted to a nd approved by [CONTACT_113834].  Prior to entry into the study or initiation of any study- related procedures, the subject  
or his/her legal representative must read, sign and date the informed consent form.  The 
person executing the consent must also sign and date t he IRB-approved consent form.  One 
original informed consent form is to be retained by [CONTACT_143292] a copy  is to be given 
to the subject  or his/her legal representative.  The informed consent process must be 
documented in the subject ’s source/ medical  record.  
 
The informed consent must be written in a language in which the subject  or his/her legal 
representative is fluent.  If a foreign language translation is required, a statement of 
certification of the translation must be issued.  Regulations requir e that foreign language 
informed consent forms be submitted to the IRB for approval.  The investigator must 
forward a copy of the consent form, the certified foreign language translation and an IRB 
approval letter to  the Sponsor or its designee . 
 
 
Protocol VS -002/E  CONFIDENTIAL  Vesalio  
  Page [ADDRESS_292725] been given for disclosure to any person for 
whom the investigator is responsible at his/her center, but only so far as required for the 
purposes of the study, and, in the case of disclosures to staff, only if such staff are bound by 
[CONTACT_4880].  
 
 
 
15. PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  
The Sponsor will document modifications to the protocol in the form of a  written 
amendment.   Protocol modifications that impact subject  safety or the validity of the study 
must be approved by [CONTACT_4881].  In the case of a medical emergency, 
to remove immediate apparent hazard to subject s, a change may be mad e preferably after 
discussion with the  Sponsor  or its designee.  In these instances, the IRB and FDA will be 
notified as soon as possible.  
 
 
 
16. DATA MANAGEMENT  
Electronic data capture (EDC) will be utilized for this study.  Study worksheets will be 
provided by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor or its designee  to the site before data collection .  To facilitate data 
entry, the worksheets will coincide with the data entry pages in the EDC system  to insure 
minimal issues during data entry.  If the site  elects to use the worksheets, a ppropriate 
worksheets will be completed and initialed or signed where indicated at each examination.  
All worksheets will be completed in a legible manner in black/blue ink.  Alternatively, the 
site may elect to use their own source documents.  It is expected  that there will be source  
data for all entries in the EDC.  
 
Any corrections to the worksheets will be made by [CONTACT_740] a single line through the 
incorrect entry, recording the correct information, and initialing and dating the change.  
The study workshe ets and data entered in the EDC system will be audited by [CONTACT_153670]. 
 
Once the data is ready to be entered into the EDC System, then the site will begin entering 
the data into the system.  T he monitor will review data  entered into the EDC against the 
source documents and/or worksheets and either approve the data records or create queries 
 
Protocol VS -002/E  CONFIDENTIAL  Vesalio  
  Page 50 of 92 to the site for further review.  If the data records are deemed “clean” with the approval of 
the monitor, then the investigator can e -sign the records.  Finally, when the data records are 
ready to be locked, the data manager will perform the interim lock in the system.  However, 
the data manager also has the right to unlock the data record if any updates to the data are 
necessary.  
 
Data are protected by [CONTACT_241007].  In addition, each individual user will be 
assigned a specific role in the EDC System which will grant that user the right to enter, 
view, edit and/or delete the data.  Furthermore, any changes to the data are captured in the 
EDC System’s audit trail where a reason for change is required.   
 
All clinical data generated in the study will be submitted to the Sponsor  or designated CRO 
for quality assurance review and statistical analysis.  All worksheets and data entered into 
the EDC system will be reviewed for completeness and evident recording errors will be 
rectified by [CONTACT_241008].  Computerized data checks will be 
used to identify unusual data entries for verification prior to statistical analysis. 
 
To minimize the amount of missing data, investigators will be trained on the deleterious 
effect that missing data have on trial integrity and credibility and that missing data could 
diminish the scientific value of all subjects' altruistic contributions.

effects, or if he/she determines that it is no longer in your best interest to continue.  The Sponsor 
or regulatory agencies may stop this study at any time without your consent.  If this occurs, you 
will be notified and your study doctor will discuss with you other options you may have.   
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY?  
Below is a description of these risks.   Your doctor will discuss the risks and procedures with you 
before you start in the study.   
 
Risks from  NeVa VS Intervention   
As described above, the interventional surgeon will make two small incisions in your  groin area 
and introduce small plastic tubes through the incisions.  These tubes (called access sheaths  and 
catheters ) are placed in your blood vessels to establish access for Neva VS procedure.  There 
may be pain or discomfort at the insertion sites and risk of infection. There is also a small risk of 
nerve damage that may cause pain and/or tingling at the sheath insertion site or down the leg.  
There is risk of damage to the artery or vein resulting in swelling, bruising, bleeding, or 
hematoma (collection of b lood in the soft tissue) at the insertion site or deeper in the 
pelvis/abdomen. Bleeding complications may result in decreased blood pressure, increased heart 
rate, and, in severe cases, need for transfusion. There is some risk that introducing instruments  
will cause the artery or vein to spasm or narrow (stenosis) and require treatment. There is a risk 
that a blood clot will form in the blood vessel that requires treatment.  Additional treatments for 
these risks may include, medications, an additional proc edure, or in rare cases surgery. When the 
sheaths and catheters are removed, manual compression is used to stop bleeding which may also 
cause discomfort or pain. The introduction of devices in the brain blood vessels may cause local 
injury including brain bleeding and/or strokes. Brain bleeding and/or strokes can cause 
permanent paralysis and/or loss of sensation in of one or more limbs and/or face as well as 
speech and/or visual problems, and even coma or death.  
 
Possible r isks from the use of X -rays ( fluoroscopy) and dye (contrast medium) :  X-rays 
(fluoroscopy) will be used during sheath/ catheter  placement and to visualize your blood vessels.  
The total fluoroscopy time and radiation exposure is estimated at several minutes and delivers 
approximately the same amount of radiation as a regular chest X -ray. Rare but possible effects of

Protocol VS -002/E  CONFIDENTIAL  Vesalio  
  Page 68 of 92 radiation include: alopecia, (hair loss) burns ranging in severity from skin reddening to ulcers, 
cataracts, and delayed neoplasia (cancer).  The interventional surgeon will als o use dye (contrast 
medium) to better see your blood vessels during fluoroscopy.  Contrast medium may cause a 
sensation of warmth or occasionally nausea which lasts a few minutes.  In rare cases, contrast 
medium causes a mild reaction such as hives or skin redness.  More serious reactions have been 
known to occur (rarely) including damage to your kidneys, and inflammation (swelling) of the 
blood vessels, or (very rarely) a life -threatening problem with breathing or blood flow.    
 
Risk s from Non -Contrast Head CT scan  
There is always a slight chance of cancer from excessive exposure to radiation. However, the 
benefit of an accurate diagnosis far outweighs the risk.   
 
Women should always inform their physician and x- ray or CT technologist if there is any 
possibility that they are pregnant. CT scanning is, in general, not recommended for pregnant 
women unless medically necessary because of potential risk to the baby.  
 
Risks from Blood Tests  
You will have routine blood samples taken from a vein in your arm by a needle stick.  Risks 
associated with drawing blood from your arm include slight discomfort and/or bruising.  
Infection, bleeding, clotting, or fainting are also possible, although unlikely.   
 
Unknown risks  
In addition to the risks already described, there may be other discomforts or risks from this study 
agent and/or procedures that we do not know about.  You will be watched for signs and 
symptoms of any side effects and you should tell your doctor if you do not feel well or 
experience any u nusual symptoms.   
 
In the event of your death, an autopsy will be requested. It would be done to provide additional 
information about the research. Your family and your “legally authorized representatives” have 
the right to refuse the autopsy even if you sign this consent form.  
 
ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?  
There may be no direct benefit to you by [CONTACT_4907].  However, it is possible that 
the Neva VS device diminishes or eliminates the vasospasms in your brain which  may result in 
subjects experiencing less severe ischemic brain injury and less final disability, but there are no 
guarantees.  
 
Knowledge from this study may help us better understand how to treat people with vasospasm .     
 
WHAT IF NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE?  
If additional data regarding potential safety risks become available during the study, your 
research doctor will tell you about it and discuss with you whether you want to continue in the 
study.  If you decide to withdraw from the study, your research doctor will make arrangements

CAUTION Investigational device.  Limited by [CONTACT_4496] (or [LOCATION_002]) law to investigational use.  
Caution:  This device is restricted to use by [CONTACT_35537] a physician.  
 
As with any medical treatment, it is the responsibility of the surgeon/physician to use his or her judgment in utilizing the procedures best suited to the needs of the patient.  Only physicians trained in neuro-
interventional procedures should utilize the Vesalio NeVa  VS (Vasospasm) System.  
The Vesalio VS System contains (1) NeVa vessel dila tion device.  
 
INDICATION FOR USE  
The  NeVa VS System  is indicated for the treatment of cerebral ischemia resulting from symptomatic vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) , secured by [CONTACT_241022] . The  NeVa VS System  is temporarily deployed  within  the vasospastic vessel segment where the intrinsic outward radial force of the 
nitinol tip expands the vessel.   
The Vesalio NeVa VS System  is indicated for:  
• Endovascular temporary use in patients with acute cerebral ischemia related to aSAH induced cerebral vasospasm  
• Endovascular temporary use to increase vessel diameter and blood flow  in patients who are experiencing symptoms of acute ischemia related to aSAH associated vasospasm . 
 
CAUTION: Evaluate the risks associated with acute endovascular vasospasm therapy (see complications below) and the possible benefits of  intravascular vessel dilation prior to use of the Vesalio NeVa 
VS System. Take all necessary precautions to limit X -radiation doses to patients and themselves by [CONTACT_240990], reducing fluoroscopy times, and modifying X -ray technical factors where 
possible .

PROCEDURE  
The Vesalio NeVa VS System  is delivered endovascularly under fluoroscopic guidance in a manner consistent with other neurovascular catheter -based devices.  
Antiplatelet and anticoagulation regimen used for interventional intracranial procedures is to be performed at the discretion of the treating physician.  
Procedure Steps:  
Angiographic Assessment of Vessel and Device Selection  
1. Using angiography, determine the location of the vasospastic vessel segment  
2. Review the patient ’s pre -vasospasm digital subtraction angiogram or equivalent vascular study (CT angiogram) to confirm that the segment to be treated has a 
diameter of at least 2.0mm prior to deployment . Recommended vessel diameter for the fully expanded portion of NeVa VS is a pre -vasospasm diameter of 2mm. 
The distal tapered portion and marker coil extend 10mm beyond the fully expanded segment.  No more than 6 device interventions per vessel should be 
attempted.

2. Aided by [CONTACT_241024]- vasospasm vascular imaging determine the location and size of the area to be revascularized.  
3. To achieve optimal performance of the Vesalio NeVa VS System  and to reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications, maintain continuous flushing action 
between a) the femoral arterial sheath and the guide catheter, b) the microcatheter and the guide catheter and c) the microcatheter and the push wire and the Vesalio 
NeVa VS System .  Check all connections to make sure that during the continuous flush that no air enters the guide catheter or the microcatheter.  
4. Position a suitable guide catheter employing a standard method.  The guide catheter should be appropriately sized to allow for angiography around the microcatheter .  
Connect a RHV to the fitting of the guide catheter, and then connect a tube to the continuous flush.  
5. With the aid of Table 1, select a microcathet er suitable for advancing the Vesalio NeVa VS System . 
6. Connect a second RHV to the fitting of the microcatheter and then connect a tube to the continuous flush.  
7. Set the flush rate per standard institutional guidelines.  
8. With the aid of a suitable guide wire, advance the microcatheter until the end of the microcatheter is positioned as distal  as possible within the treatable segment of 
the vasospastic vessel.   The treatable segment is determined by [CONTACT_241025]- vasospasm angiographic imaging to ensure that the segment is at least [ADDRESS_292746] will interrupt normal infusion of flushing solution and allow back flow of blood into the microcatheter.  
12. Visually verify t hat the flushing solution is infusing normally. Once confirmed, loosen the RHV to advance the push wire.  
13. With the aid of fluoroscopic monitoring, carefully advance the Vesalio NeVa VS System  until its distal marker lines up at the end of the microcatheter .     
WARNING:  IF EXCESSIVE RESISTANCE IS ENCOUNTERED DURING THE DELIVERY OF THE VESALIO NEVA VS SYSTEM , DISCONTINUE THE DELIVERY 
AND IDENTIFY THE CAUSE OF THE RESISTANCE. ADVANCEMENT OF THE VESALIO NEVA VS SYSTEM  AGAINST RESISTANCE MAY RESULT IN DEVICE 
DAMAGE AND/OR PATIENT INJURY.  
Deploying the Vesalio NeVa VS System  
14. Loosen the RHV around the microcatheter. To deploy the Vesalio NeVa VS System , fix the push er wire to maintain the position of the device while carefully 
withdrawing the microcatheter in the proximal direction. Do not advanc e the NeVa VS S ystem beyond the distal tip of the microcatheter, doing so risks damage to 
the vessel and/or the device.  
15. Retract the microcatheter until it is proximal to the proxim al marker of the Vesalio NeVa VS System . Tighten the RHV to prevent any movement of the push wire.    
16. Allow the NeVa VS to remain in place for up to [ADDRESS_292747] resis tance or significant vasospasm 
 may result in damage to the vessel or device  
18. After complete expansion or 10  minutes, re -capture the NeVa VS System into the microcatheter using the following steps:  Loosen the RHV around the microcatheter 
and around the push wire. With the aid of fluoroscopic monitoring, hold the push wire firmly in its position to prevent the V esalio NeVa VS System from moving. 
Carefully re -sheath the Vesalio NeVa VS System  by [CONTACT_241026].  
19. Once re- captured in the microcatheter, the catheter can be withdrawn to a more proximal segment and the device re -deployed to treat proximal vasospasm following 
steps 15- 17 above.  
  
WARNING:  IF EXCESSIVE RESISTANCE IS ENCOUNTERED DURING MICROCATHETER RE -CAPTURE  OF THE VESALIO NEVA VS SYSTEM , 
DISCONTINUE THE RE -CAPTURE  AND IDENTIFY THE CAUSE OF THE RESISTANCE . IF THERE IS CONTINUED RESISTANCE, WITHDRAW  THE 
MICROCATHETER AND NEVA VS SYSTEM TOGETHER AND RE -CAPTURE INTO THE GUIDE CATHETER. DO NOT PERFORM MORE THAN SIX 
DEPLOYMENTS AND MICROCATHETER RE -SHEATHING ATTEMPTS  USING A SINGLE VESALIO NEVA VS SYSTEM . 
20. After  the last deployment, re- capture the device into the microcatheter followi ng the steps above and withdraw  the micro catheter and NeVa VS S ystem through the 
guide catheter. Open the guide catheter RHV to allow the microcatheter and the Vesalio NeVa VS System  to exit without resistance. Use care to prevent air from 
entering the system.  
21. If additional vessel dilation attempts are desired with:  
a new Vesalio NeVa VS System , then repeat the steps described above starting with the “Preparation” section.

Person Administering Scale:________________________________________ 
 
Administer stroke scale items in the order listed.  Record performance in each category after each subscale 
exam. Do not go bac k and change scores. Follow directions provided for each exam technique. Scores 
should reflect what the patient does, not what the clinician thinks the patient can do.  The clinician should 
record answers while administering the exam and work quickly.  Exc ept where indicated, the patient should 
not be coached (i.e., repeated requests to patient to make a special effort).  
 
 Instructions  Scale Definition  Score  
1a. Level of Consciousness: The investigator must choose a 
response if a full evaluation is prevented by [CONTACT_198992], language barrier, orotracheal trauma/bandages. 
A 3 is scored only if the patient makes no movement (other than 
reflexive posturing) in response to noxious stimulation.  0 = Alert; keenly responsive.  
 
1 = Not alert ; but arousable by [CONTACT_55904], answer, or respond.  
 
2 = Not alert ; requires repeated stimulation to 
attend, or is obtunded and requires strong or 
painful stimulation  to make movements (not 
stereotyped).  
 
3 = Responds only with reflex motor or 
autonomic effects or totally unresponsive, 
flaccid, and are flexic.  ______  
1b. LOC Questions: The patient is asked the month and his/her 
age. The answer must be correct -  there is no partial credit for being 
close. Aphasic and stuporous patients who do not comprehend the 
questions will score 2. Patients unable to speak because of 
endotracheal intubation, orotracheal trauma, severe dysarthria from 
any cause, language barrier, or any other problem not secondary to 
aphasia are given a 1. It is important that only the initial answer be 
graded and that the examiner not "help" the patient with verbal or 
non-verbal cues.  0 = Answers both questions correctly.  
 
1 = Answers one question correctly.  
 
2 = Answers neither question correctly.  ______  
1c. LOC Commands: The patient is asked to open and close the 
eyes and then to grip and release the non- paretic hand. Substitute 
another one step command if the hands cannot be used. Credit is 
given if an unequivocal attempt is made but not completed due to 
weakness. If the patient does not respond to command, the task 
should be demonstrated to him or her (pantomime), and the result 
scored (i.e., follows none, one or two commands). Patients with 
trauma, amputation, or other physical impediments should be given 
suitable one- step commands. Only the first attempt is scored.  0 = Performs both tasks correctly.  
 
1 = Performs one task correctly.  
 
2 = Performs neither task correctly.  ______  
2. Best Gaze: Only horizontal eye movements will be tested. 
Voluntary or reflexive (oculocephalic) eye movements will be 
scored, but caloric testing is not done. If the patient has a conjugate 
deviation of the eyes that can be overcome by [CONTACT_198994] , the score will be 1. If a patient has an isolated peripheral 
nerve paresis (CN III, IV or VI), score a 1. Gaze is testable in all 
aphasic patients. Patients with ocular trauma, bandages, pre-
existing blindness, or other disorder of visual acuity or field s should 
be tested with reflexive movements, and a choice made by [CONTACT_1275]. Establishing eye contact [CONTACT_241030] a 
partial gaze palsy.  0 = Normal.  
 
1 = Partial gaze palsy; gaze is abnormal in one 
or both eyes, but forced deviation or total gaze 
paresis is not present.  
 
2 = Forced deviation, or total gaze paresis not 
overcome by [CONTACT_55907].  ______

  Page 81 of 92 3. Visual: Visual fields (upper and l ower quadrants) are tested by 
[CONTACT_55908], using finger counting or visual threat, as appropriate. 
Patients may be encouraged, but if they look at the side of the 
moving fingers appropriately, this can be scored as normal. If there 
is unilateral blindnes s or enucleation, visual fields in the remaining 
eye are scored. Score 1 only if a clear -cut asymmetry, including 
quadrantanopia, is found. If patient is blind from any cause, score 
3. Double simultaneous stimulation is performed at this point. If 
there is  extinction, patient receives a 1, and the results are used to 
respond to item 11.  0 = No visual loss.  
 
1 = Partial hemianopia.  
 
2 = Complete hemianopia.  
 
3 = Bilateral hemianopia (blind including 
cortical blindness).  ______  
4. Facial Palsy: Ask – or use pantomime to encourage –  the patient 
to show teeth or raise eyebrows and close eyes. Score symmetry 
of grimace in response to noxious stimuli in the poorly responsive 
or non- comp rehending patient. If facial trauma/bandages, 
orotracheal tube, tape or other physical barriers obscure the face, 
these should be removed to the extent possible.  0 = Normal symmetrical movements.

and the exam iner should test as many body areas (arms [not 
hands], legs, trunk, face) as needed to accurately check for 
hemisensory loss. A score of 2, “severe or total sensory loss,” 
should only be given when a severe or total loss of sensation can 
be clearly demonst rated. Stuporous and aphasic patients will, 
therefore, probably score 1 or 0. The patient with brainstem stroke 
who has bilateral loss of sensation is scored 2. If the patient does 
not respond and is quadriplegic, score 2. Patients in a coma (item 
1a=3) ar e automatically given a 2 on this item.  0 = Normal; no sensory loss.  
 
1 = Mild -to-moderate sensory loss; patient 
feels pi[INVESTIGATOR_240975]; or there is a loss of superficial pain 
with pi[INVESTIGATOR_29107], but patient is aware of being 
touched.  
 
2 = Severe to total sensory loss; patient is not 
aware of being touched in the face, arm, and leg.  ______  
9. Best Language: A great deal of information about 
comprehension will be obtained during the preceding sections of 
the examination. For this scale item, the patient is asked to describe 
what is happening in the attached pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], to name [CONTACT_241047]. Comprehension is judged from responses here, as well 
as to all of the commands in the preceding general neurological 
exam. If visual loss interferes with the tests, ask  the patient to 
identify objects placed in the hand, repeat, and produce speech. 
The intubated patient should be asked to write. The patient in a 
coma (item 1a=3) will automatically score [ADDRESS_292752] choose a score for the patient wit h stupor or limited 
cooperation, but a score of 3 should be used only if the patient is 
mute and follows no one- step commands.  0 = No aphasia; normal.  
 
1 = Mild -to-moderate aphasia; some obvious 
loss of fluency or facility of comprehension, 
without significant limitation on ideas expressed 
or form of expression. Reduction of speech 
and/or comprehension, however, makes 
conversation about provided materials difficult or 
impossible. For example, in conversation about 
provided materials, examiner can identify pi[INVESTIGATOR_240976]’s response.  
 
2 = Severe aphasia; all communication is 
through fragmentary expression; great need for 
inference, questioning, and guessing by [CONTACT_241032]. Range of information that can be 
exchanged is limited; listener carries burden of 
communication. Examiner cannot identify 
materials provided from patient response.  
 
3 = Mute, global aphasia; no usable speech or 
auditory comprehension.  ______  
10. Dysarthria: If patient is thought to be normal, an adequate 
sample of speech must be obtained by [CONTACT_241033]. If the patient has severe 
aphasia, the clarity of articulation of spontaneous speech can be 
rated. Only if t he patient is intubated or has other physical barriers 
to producing speech, the examiner should record the score as 
untestable (UN), and clearly write an explanation for this choice. Do 
not tell the patient why he or she is being tested.  0 = Normal.  
 
1 = Mild-to-moderate dysarthria; patient slurs 
at least some words and, at worst, can be 
understood with some difficulty.  
 
2 = Severe dysarthria; patient's speech is so 
slurred as to be unintelligible in the absence of 
or out of proportion to any dysphasia, or is 
mute/anarthric.  
 
UN = Intubated or other physical barrier,

information to identify neglect may be obtained during the prior 
testing. If the patient has a severe visual loss preventing visual 
double simultaneous stimulation, and the cutaneous stimuli are 
normal, the score is normal. If the patient has aphasia but does 
appear to attend to both sides, the score is normal. The presence 
of visual spatial neglect or anosagnosia may also be taken as 
evidence of abnormality. Since the abnormality is scored only if 
present, the item is never untestable.  0 = No abnormality.  
 
1 = Visual, tactile, auditory, spatial, or 
personal inattention or extinction to bilateral 
simultaneous stimulation in one of the sensory 
modalities.  
 
2 = Profound hemi -inattention or extinc tion to 
more than one modality; does not recognize 
own hand or orients to only one side of space.  ______

1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEM A 
 
This study  is designed  to assess  whether the sedative  Dexmedetomidine   (PRECEDEX),  
when  used  intraoperatively  only and stopped  at the end of the operative  procedure,   provides  
analgesia  up to 24 hours  following  surgery  as well as fewer  opi[INVESTIGATOR_232909].  If beneficial,  
the use of Precedex  could  be a component  in the 23 hour surgical  protocols.

2.1 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
2.2 Primary  Objective  
 
To determine  if the use of intravenous  dexmedetomidine  intraoperatively  only and stopped  at 
the end of the operative  procedure,  provides  analgesia  for up to 24 hours  following  surgery   
as well as fewer  opi[INVESTIGATOR_232909].  This will be measured  by [CONTACT_232962][INVESTIGATOR_232910]  (the equivalent  dose  in intravenous  morphine  as defined  
at the end of section  10.0 below).   The primary  measure  will be total opi[INVESTIGATOR_232911] 4 hours.  Data will be collected  up to 24 hours  after arrival  in PACU  or discharge  (if 
sooner).  
 
2.3 Secondary  Objectives  
 
To explore  whether  the use of intravenous  dexmedetomidine  infusion  intraoperatively:  
 
1. Improves  analgesia  as measured  by [CONTACT_232963]  (NRS)  
preoperatively  to postoperatively  at rest and with activity  (such  as coughing).  
2. Results  in fewer  cumulative  epi[INVESTIGATOR_232912]/or  sedation  
as measured  by [CONTACT_232964],  the use of antiemetics  and RASS  
sedation  scores,  respectively.

adequate  analgesia  with minimal  side effects  must be sought.  Without  an epi[INVESTIGATOR_232914],  opi[INVESTIGATOR_232915]  (IV-PCA)  or as

Selective  α2-adrenoceptor  agonists  such as clonidine  already  have  approved  uses for both 
acute  and chronic  pain when  given  epi[INVESTIGATOR_232917].  By [CONTACT_232966],  α2-adrenoceptor  agonists  produce  analgesia  at presynaptic  and postjunctional  alpha2 - 
adrenoceptors  in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_127102][3]. Activation  of the former  at the locus  coeruleus  results  in 
decreased  norepi[INVESTIGATOR_232918]. Other  regions  identified  to have  a high density  of α2- 
adrenoceptors  include  the substantia  gelatinosa,  and the intermediolateral  cell column  , sites 
of major  pain signaling [4]. 
 
Dexmedetomidine  is the active  dextro -isomer  of medetomidine  with [ADDRESS_281016].   Dexmedetomidine  was approved  in 1999  for short -term use of less 
than 24 hours  as a sedative  in mechanically  ventilated  patients  in the intensive  care unit [5]. 
Sedative  effects  are observed  within 5 minutes  following  intravenous  dexmedetomidine  
administration.  Unlike  other  sedatives  such as midazolam  and propofol,  patients  on 
dexmedetomidine  were  sedated but easily  arousable  without  respi[INVESTIGATOR_2477][6].   Its 
sedative,  sympatholytic  and pro-respi[INVESTIGATOR_232919]   (17-50%) with more  rapid  return  to a 
non-anesthetized  state[7].  
 
Used  off-label,  dexmedetomidine  has been  shown  in several  studies  to have  analgesic  
properties  [5-9].   Direct  spi[INVESTIGATOR_232920] α2-adrenoceptors  inhibits the release  of substance   
P, which  also results  in analgesia [10].  Randomized  studies  by [CONTACT_232967]. al. showed  a 
decrease  of morphine use by 66% for major  intraabdominal  and orthopedic  surgery   
(n=34) [8]. This study  may have  had incomplete  blinding  and involved  continuation  of the 
dexmedetomidine  infusion  in the recovery  room from its initiation  intra-operatively.   In studies  
by [CONTACT_232968],  dexmedetomidine  was administered  at low and high bolus  doses  
(no infusion) only postoperatively   (no intraoperative  use) and found  to be analgesic  but also 
sedative [6]. Interestingly,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_232921].  
Wahlander  and colleagues  used  IV dexmedetomidine postoperatively  following  thoracic  lung 
surgery  as an adjunct  to epi[INVESTIGATOR_232922] [11]. A bolus  and an infusion  were started  
postoperatively  only and showed  opi[INVESTIGATOR_232923],  but this was also associated  with 
bradycardia  and hypotension.  Lin and colleagues  demonstrated  opi[INVESTIGATOR_232924] a PCA (patient-controlled 
analgesic  device).  They  did note dexmedetomidine related  side effects  of bradycardia  and 
hypotension  postoperatively  but also reported  decreased morphine  induced  nausea.  All

dexmedetomidine  administration  continued  postoperatively  with consequent  hemodynamic  
effects  and sedation  in the recovery  room  as well as analgesia [12]. 
 
Patient‟s  presenting  for thoracic  surgery  often  have  significant  preexisting  lung disease  which  
narrows  the therapeutic  window  between  risk and benefit,  both intraoperatively  and 
postoperatively.  Anesthetics  are adjusted  intraoperatively  to promote  extubation,  while  
postoperative  analgesia  must  be maximized  to prevent  reintubation.  Patients  undergoing  
major  procedures  such as lobectomy  or pneumonectomy  can achieve  both goals  using  an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_232925].  Patients  undergoing  
thorascopic  procedures  (VATS) for wedge  resections  or other simpler procedures  (such  as 
mediastinoscopy)   are often  discharged  sooner  (1-2 days) making  the use of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_232926].  
 
In this study,  we wish to examine  the effect  of an intraoperative  only infusion  of 
dexmedetomidine  on postoperative  pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_232927].   These  patients  
represent  a population  for whom epi[INVESTIGATOR_232928];  but, for  some  surgeries,  the 
risk of epi[INVESTIGATOR_232929].  However,  given  that such patients  may 
have  significant  pre-existing  lung disease,  there  is a desire  to minimize  opi[INVESTIGATOR_232930].  Specifically,  we wish to examine  if there  is residual  analgesia  postoperatively  from 
dexmedetomidine  if the infusion  ends  in the operating  room.  Residual  analgesia  has been  
demonstrated  where  dexmedetomidine  was used  as an alternate  to Propofol  sedation  for 
Monitored  Anesthetic  Care  in regional  cases [7] but no such examination   has occurred  for 
general  anesthesia  cases.  The infusion  in this study  would  be started  in the operating  room  
by a continuous  intravenous  infusion.   Before  arrival  to the recovery  room,  the infusion  will be 
stopped  in the operating  room.  The goal is to assess  if the intraoperative  dose  of 
dexmedetomidine  will provide  residual  analgesia  in the recovery  room  resulting  in less opi[INVESTIGATOR_232931].  
 
No comparable  protocol  of this type has yet to be undertaken  (i.e. with dexmedetomidine  
used  intraoperatively  only).  The advantage  of this study  design  over previous  designs  is the 
intraoperative  use of the drug infusion  only during  the general  anesthetic.  In this way, any 
sedation  resulting  from the drug occurs  during  anesthesia  where  it may potentiate  the 
anesthetic,  blunting  the sympathetic  response,  which  may maximize  the cardio -protective  
effects.  Also,  any potential  bradycardia  and hypotension  from the drug will be identified  and 
treated  in a monitored  setting  with anesthesia  providers  continually  present.   Discontinuation  
of dexmedetomidine  will occur  before  transport  to the recovery  room,  minimizing  ongoing  
side effects  such as sedation,  bradycardia  and hypotension  while  allowing  assessment  of 
potential  ongoing  analgesia.  The average  Length  of Stay over July and August  2011  was 
3.67 days  for 117 patients  VATs  patients.  Given  the institution‟s goal to reduce  some  
surgeries  (such  as VATs)  to 23-hour stays,  in part by [CONTACT_232969],  this study  may represent  a component  towards  that end.

either  an active  agent  (dexmedetomidine)  or a placebo.  The infusion  will be started  in the 
operating  room through  a continuous  infusion.   Before  arrival  in the recovery  room,  the 
infusion  will be stopped  in the operating  room  and all patients  will receive  a dose  of ketorolac  
and IV acetaminophen,  if no contraindications  exist.  In addition,  the surgeon  will infiltrate  the 
wound  with local anesthetic.  On arrival  to the recovery  room,  all patients  will receive  a 
patient -controlled  analgesic  (PCA)  of intravenous  Fentanyl  (or equivalent)  as a rescue  dose  
only,  without  a basal  rate. In addition  all patients  will be given  acetaminophen  as a standing

scores  and opi[INVESTIGATOR_232909]  (use of antiemetics  and RASS  sedation  scores)  will be 
recorded  to assess  differences  between  active  and placebo  groups.  
 
For details  on the measures  used,  please  see section  10.0.  
 
4.2 Intervention  
 
The study  involves  the use of dexmedetomidine  infusion  intraoperatively  during  thoracic  
surgical  procedures  (not using  an epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873]) with discontinuation  in the immediate  
postoperative  period.  A key feature  in this study  is to employ  the drug infusion  
intraoperatively  only. Therefore,  sedation  resulting  from the drug will occur  during  general  
anesthesia,  where  it may potentiate  the anesthetic.  Also,  any potential  bradycardia  and 
hypotension  from the drug will be identified  and treated  in a fully monitored  setting  with 
anesthesia  providers  continually present.  
 
For this study,  the research  pharmacy  will prepare  both the active  and placebo  agent  in a 
syringe  at a fixed concentration.  This will be used  on a syringe  infusion  pump  and dosed  on a 
per kg basis.  The study  dose  of dexmedetomidine  is a continuous  infusion  of 0.4 mcg/kg/hr.  
This  is consistent  with prescribing  recommendations  for ICU sedation  and most  studies  
investigating  dexmedetomidine ‟s use as an analgesic [12]. . Both active  and placebo  agents  
will be dosed  in mls in an identical  fashion.  Before  arrival  in the recovery  room,  the infusion  
will be stopped  in the operating  room.

Page  8 of 23  
  
The active  agent  used  in the study  is dexmedetomidine,  which  is currently  part of the MSK 
formulary.  Dexmedetomidine  is the active  dextro -isomer  of medetomidine  and is about  8 
times  more  specific  for α2-adrenoceptors  than clonidine [10]. Dexmedetomidine  was approved  
in 1999  for short -term use of less than 24 hours.  The agent  is FDA approved  for use for 
sedation  of non-intubated  patients  before and during  surgical  and other procedures  and for 
sedation  of intubated  and mechanically  ventilated  patients  during  treatment  in an intensive  
care unit[10].  It has no current  analgesic  properties,  an endpoint  of this study.  
 
Dexmedetomidine  is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_232933] a rapid  distribution  phase  half-life of 
approximately  6 minutes  and a large  volume  of distribution[13].  
 
Dexmedetomidine  exhibits  linear  kinetics  in the dosage  range  of 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg/hr  when  
administered  by [CONTACT_232970] 24 hours.  
 
In subjects  with varying  degrees  of hepatic  impairment  (Child -Pugh  Class  A, B, or C), 
clearance  values  were  lower  than in healthy  subjects.  The mean  clearance  values  for 
subjects  with mild, moderate,  and severe  hepatic  impairment  were  74%,  64%,  and 53% of 
those  observed  in the normal  healthy  subjects,  respectively.  Mean  clearances  for free drug 
were  59%,  51%,  and 32% of those  observed  in the normal  healthy  subjects,  respectively.  
Although  dexmedetomidine  is dosed  to effect,  dosage  reduction  may be necessary  in 
patients  with hepatic  impairment.  Because  of this, evidence  of liver disease  represents  an 
exclusion  criteria.  
 
Pharmacokinetic  values  of dexmedetomidine  were similar  for patients  with a creatinine  
clearance  (CrCl)  < 30 ml/min  as compared  with healthy  subjects,  but the pharmacokinetic  
values  of the metabolites  of dexmedetomidine  have  not been  evaluated  in patients  with 
impaired  renal  function.  As dexmedetomidine  is extensively  metabolized  and most  of the 
metabolites  are excreted  in the urine,  metabolites  may accumulate  upon  long-term infusions  
in patients  with impaired  renal  function.

unapproved  indication  (pain).  
• That participation  is voluntary  
• An explanation  of the purposes  of the research  are to determine  if this drug has any 
analgesic  effect  and permitting  a decrease  in opi[INVESTIGATOR_232909]  
• The expected  duration  of participation  is at most  24 hours  or until discharge  
• That the patient  will be randomized  to this drug or placebo  and that the randomization  
will be unknown  unless  knowledge  is required.  
• Identification  that only FDA approved  drugs  are being  used  and they are not 
experimental  drugs  awaiting  approval.  
• A description  of any reasonably  foreseeable  risks or discomforts  to the patient  
• A description  of any benefits  to the patient  or to others  which  may reasonably  be 
expected  from the research

eligible  and to contact  [CONTACT_46443].  If the patient  turns  out to be 
ineligible  for the research  study,  the research  staff will destroy  all information  collected  on the 
patient  during  the initial  conversation  and medical  records  review,  except  for any information

the patients  who are screened  and minimal  PHI will be maintained  as part of a screening  log. 
For these  reasons,  we seek  a (partial)  limited  waiver  of authorization  for the purposes  of (1) 
reviewing  medical  records  to identify  potential  research  subjects  and obtain  information  
relevant  to the enrollment  process;  (2) conversing  with patients  regarding  possible  
enrollment;  (3) handling  of PHI contained  within  those  records  and provided  by [CONTACT_83699];  and (4) maintaining  information  in a screening  log of patients  approached  (if 
applicable).  
 
 
8.1 PRETREATMENT EVALUATION 
 
All patients  will be evaluated  by [CONTACT_232975].   Extent  of 
disease  and potential  resectability  will be determined  using  a variety  of cross -sectional  
imaging  and other  studies  that will vary depending  on the underlying  diagnosis.

Prior  to operation,  the following  will be performed.  
 
• The patient  will sign informed  consent  for the surgery  
• The patient  will be confirmed  to have  a documented  pre-operative  history  and 
physical  examination  in the EPIC  system.  Current  history  will include  any Psychiatric  
disorder  precluding  adequate  outcome  responses  (based  on investigator  judgment)  
as determined  by [CONTACT_232976].  Patient  
demographics  will be recorded  
• Standard  Preoperative testing,  including  EKG (to determine  any exclusions)  will be 
confirmed  
• Notation  will be made  of any tests  done  as part of pre-operative  clearance  
documenting  ejection  fraction.  
• Serum  pregnancy  test for women  of childbearing  potential  prior to therapy  (to 
determine  any exclusions)  as per the MSK standard  prior to surgery  will be followed.  
• A preoperative  Numerical  Rating  Scale  (NRS)  for pain at rest and with activity  (such  
as coughing)  will be completed  within  4 hours  prior to surgery,  in the pre-surgical 
center  as a baseline.  
• A preoperative  query  for nausea,  vomiting  and a RASS  sedation  score  will be 
completed  within  4 hours  prior to surgery,  in the pre-surgical  center  as a baseline.  
9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
 
Patients  scheduled  for Thoracic  Surgery  will undergo  no change  in their routine  care or 
preoperative  testing  except  for inclusion  of the study  drug or placebo.  As part of the study,  
the intravenous  infusion  will commence  with the induction  of general  anesthesia.  The 
infusion  should  end during  the commencement  of surgical  closure  , always  prior to arrival  in 
the recovery  room.   All patients  will receive  a dose  of ketorolac  and IV acetaminophen,  
unless  there  is a clinical  consideration  to avoid  dosing  (e.g. concern  of bleeding  
postoperatively  with ketorolac).  In addition,  the surgeon  will perform  intercostal  blocks  as 
standard  practice  (unless  not advisable  clinically).  On arrival  to the recovery  room,  all 
patients  will receive  a patient -controlled  analgesic  (PCA)  of intravenous  Fentanyl  (or 
equivalent)  as a rescue  dose  only,  without  a basal.  In addition  all patients  will be given  
acetaminophen  as a standing  order  every [ADDRESS_281022].  There  is no plan to take any specimens  as part of this study.

• New Arrhythmia  (excluding  sinus  tachycardia  and bradycardia  that does  not require  
treatment  with a continuous  infusion  agent)  
• Suspected  anaphylaxis  
 
Criteria  for censoring  of the patient‟s data include:

Linear  Model  and more  readily  identify  possible  outlying  observations.  
 
We will also perform  more  exploratory  analyses  to data such  as the total opi[INVESTIGATOR_232958] 8

Obtain  informed  consent,  by [CONTACT_40136].  
 
During  the registration  process  registering  individuals  will be required  to complete  a protocol  
specific  Eligibility  Checklist.  
 
All participants  must  be registered  through  the Protocol  Participant  Registration  (PPR) Office  
at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center.  PPR is available  Monday  through  Friday  from 
8:30am  – 5:30pm  at [PHONE_214].  Registrations  must  be submitted  via the PPR Electronic  
Registration  System  (http://ppr/ ).  The completed  signature  [CONTACT_28651]/RA  or 
verbal  script/RA,  a completed  Eligibility  Checklist  and other  relevant  documents  must  be 
uploaded  via the PPR Electronic  Registration  System.  
 
 
 
15.3 Randomization  
 
This is a double  masked  placebo  controlled  randomized  trial.  After eligibility  is established  
and immediately  after consent  is obtained,  patients  will be registered  in the Protocol  
Participant  Registration  (PPR)  system.  Patients  will be randomized  using  the Clinical  
Research  Database  (CRDB)  at the time of registration,  by [CONTACT_232984] 
[PHONE_214]  between  the hours  of 8:30am  and 5:30pm,  Monday  – Friday.   Randomization  
will be accomplished  by [CONTACT_206951],  stratified  by [CONTACT_547]  (male   / 
female)  and age (<45 / 45 to 65 / >65).   Since  this is a double  masked  study,  the patients‟ 
treatment  assignments  can be viewed  in the CRDB  only by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_232959].  The patient‟s randomizatio n status  will also be unblinded  at the 
request  of clinical  personnel  if medical  care warrants  such knowledge  to adequately  treat the 
patient  including  development  of a new arrhythmia  (excluding  sinus  tachycardia  and 
bradycardia  that does  not require  treatment),  use of vasopressor  infusion  intraoperatively

potential  patients  eligible  for consenting.  They  will also be re sponsible  for collection  of data 
from the EPIC  system  for intraoperative  measures.  They  will also be responsible  for data 
collection  in the PACU  and patient  floor based  on nursing  records  and the CIS system.  
Additional  responsibilities  of the RSA include  project  compliance,  data entry,  data reporting,  
regulatory  monitoring,  identification  of potential  withdrawals,  and SAE reporting.  The data 
recorded  for this study  will be entered  into a secure  database  compliant  with HIPAA

patient  questionnaires.  
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals  and completeness    
of registration  of data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data 
and inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates  and extent  of accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will be 
monitored  periodically  throughout  the study  period  and potential  problems  will be brought  to 
the attention  of the Principal  Investigator.  
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  
were  approved  by [CONTACT_28642]  2001.  The plans  address  the 
new policies  set forth by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  
Institute  for Data and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials”  which  can be found  at:

SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent  .  SAE reporting  is 
required  for 30-days after the participant ‟s last investigational  treatment  or intervention.  Any 
events  that occur  after the 30-day period  and that are at least possibly  related  to protocol  
treatment  must  be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires  submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP RR-408 „Reporting  of Serious  
Adverse  Events‟, the SAE report  must  be sent to the IRB within  5 calendar  days  of the event.  
The IRB requires  a Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted  
electronically  to the SAE Office  as follows:  
 
For IND/IDE trials: Reports that include a Grade 5 SAE should be sent to 
[EMAIL_440] .  All other  reports  should  be sent to [EMAIL_2141] . 
 
For all other  trials:  Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to  
[EMAIL_440] .  All other  reports  should  be sent to [EMAIL_203] . 
 
The report  should  contain  the following  information:  
Fields  populated  from CRDB:  
• Subject‟s  initials  
• Medical  record  number  
• Disease/histology  (if applicable)  
• Protocol  number  and title 
Data  needing  to be entered:  
• The date the adverse  event  occurred  
• The adverse  event  
• The grade  of the event  
• Relationship  of the adverse  event  to the treatment  (drug,  device,  or intervention)  
• If the AE was expected  
• The severity  of the AE 
• The intervention  
• Detailed  text that includes  the following  
o A explanation  of how the AE was handled  
o A description  of the subject‟s condition  
o Indication  if the subject  remains  on the study

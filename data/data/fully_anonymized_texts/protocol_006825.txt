CONFIDENTIAL To evaluate the effects of tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_894575]: 
 Difference in fasting GV 
 Difference in postprandial GV and in accommodation volume (that is, postprandial 
minus fasting gastric volumes) 
 Difference in gastric emptying (T 1/2, emptying at 2h and emptying at 4h) 
 Volume to fullness (sensation of usual postprandial fullness) and maximum feeling 
of fullness (MTV). 
 
Secondary: 
 Absolute postprandial gastric volume 
 Gastric volume (GV) ratio (postprandial/fasting GV)  
 Gastric emptying of solids at 2h 
 Gastric emptying of solids at 4h 
Intragastric meal distribution at time zero, (IMD0) following ingestion of test meal
 Maximum tolerated volume (MTV) during satiation test 
 Aggregate symptoms score [ADDRESS_1253526]  
 Individual symptom scores (nausea, bloating, fullness, pain) on satiation test 
  
Overall Design: 
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single center study during which 
healthy volunteers will be recruited, enrolled, and randomized to one of 2 treatment groups.  
Subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to either placebo or 
tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_053] , two 85mg tablet daily (b.i.d.) for 9 consecutive days. Subjects may be involved in 
study activity for up to five weeks from screening date to completion of all studies. The actual 
study related testing will be conducted on three days. 
 
Enrollment of subjects will continue until N=[ADDRESS_1253527] started their assigned study 
medication, but do not complete all the study testing  through Day 9 will be replaced.  
Primary Endpoint:  
The primary objectives of this study are: 
 Comparison of fasting gastric volume  induced by [CONTACT_894578][INVESTIGATOR_140609]. placebo studied by 
[CONTACT_592218] (SPECT) 
 Comparison of accommodation volume  induced by [CONTACT_894578][INVESTIGATOR_894576]. placebo studied by 
[CONTACT_894579] (VTF,mL) on satiation test for tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_894576]. 
placebo 
 Comparison of gastric emptying  T1/2 of solids on scintigraphy  for tradipi[INVESTIGATOR_894576]. 
placebo 
 Comparison of gastric emptying values at 2 and 4 hours

CONFIDENTIAL Criteria for evaluation: 
Efficacy:  
 Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to calculate fasting gastric 
volume and postprandial gastric accommodation  
 Measurement of volume to fullness (mL) on satiation test  
 Gastric emptying by [CONTACT_894580]:  
 Safety and tolerability assessments will include the recording of adverse events (AEs), 
physical examinations, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and electrocardiograms. 
 The Columbia-Suicide Severity Scale (C-SSRS) will be used to assess suicidal behavior and 
ideation. 
Sample Size Discussion:  
Sample size is based on the results of primary endpoints in the Mayo Clinic lab. Expected  
23.6% in the gastric accommodation volume  and 29.2% in gastric emptying  T1/2, based 
on the coefficients of variation observed from the Mayo Clinic laboratory in prior studies.

 NOTICE: 
DUE TO KNOWN PVSRIPO-MEDIATED TREATMENT EFFECTS, INCREASED 
TUMOR SIZE ON RADIOGRAPHIC IMAGING FOLLOWING PVSRIPO 
ADMINISTRATION MAY OCCUR. EXCEPT IN CASES OF EMINENT LIFE-
THREATENING EMERGENCY, CONSULT WITH STUDY-DESIGNATED NEURO-
ONCOLOGIST(S)/INVESTIGATOR STEERING COMMITTEE PRIOR TO 
INITIATING NON-PROTOCOL-SPECIFIED TUMOR TREATMENTS OR 
PERFORMING SURGICAL RESECTION.  
Per-Protocol management of cerebral edema / pseudoprogressive / polycystic / 
expansive tumor appearance within 6 months of any PVSRIPO infu sion is as 
follows: 
• Radiographic findings but patient asymptomatic/stable: 
o Observe and continue to follow per protocol 
• Radiographic findings with new onset/worsening clinical symptoms : 
o Initiation of low dose steroids (dexamethasone ≤ 4mg/day) if rapid 
administration is required  
o Preferred: Low dose bevacizumab (7.5mg/kg q 3 weeks; few cycles as 
possible to achieve symptom control) 
o Other supportive care treatments, as required (eg, antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_23698])  
• PVSRIPO’s immune-mediated mechanism of action (MOA) is known to result in 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_871367] 
• Due to PVRIPO’s MOA, reliance on radiographic imaging standards (iRANO, etc.) 
for determining disease progression is not valid 
• Time to objective radiographic anti-tumor response ranges from approxim ately [ADDRESS_1216962]-infusion in the Phase 1 study (median time to response 15 
months) 
• In order for patients to have the best opportunity for anti-tumor respon se, 
experience suggests that patients should be managed as noted above

01JUN2018 to 
02NOV2018 •Sections  6 Study Schema , 9.1 Investigational Plan,  9.1.8 Randomization,  14.10
Sample Size Calculations: Prior to the activation of ad ditional centers in the
multicenter study and compi[INVESTIGATOR_871368], to date
(October 2018), DUMC has enrolled 48 subjects on the sing le center phase 2 study.
As such, enrollment is being increased slightly (up to 4 0 additional patients; from N=62
to up to 102, distributed evenly across the study arms)  in an interim fashion to allow
time for continued enrollment during other site histor ical control data compi[INVESTIGATOR_344],
corresponding sample size calculations/adjustments and possib ly additional FDA
discussions.  As stated previously, sample size/statistical p ower will be updated if
necessary via a future amendment once the historical contr ol data from other centers
are available and analyzed .
•Sections  [IP_ADDRESS] Study Related Biopsy,  [IP_ADDRESS] Archival Tissue and  [IP_ADDRESS] Future
Surgical Procedures: Clarified that only the tests outli ned in the pathology manual

Version 8: 07FEB2020
Page 5 of 94 control patients in the Phase 1 study . However, early bevacizumab use as a potential 
surrogate marker of long term survival as outlined, will also be investigated at other 
centers and DUMC. Additional details will be outline d in the statistical analysis plan 
and finalized prior to conducting the interim analysis.  
•Section  10.2 Study Agent Lomustine: In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_871369] 
17AUG2018, the 5 mg dose of lomustine was discontinued by [CONTACT_871393], reference to the 5mg dose was deleted and the text was amended to state 
that the single dose of lomustine to be given at week 8 should not exceed but be 
within 10mg (the new lowest dose level capsule) of 110 mg/m2 or 90 mg/m2 if on 
bevacizumab since PVSRIPO infusion.
•Section  11.2 Exclusion Criteria: Clarified in this quoted section of exclusion criterion 
#8: “Patients may not be less than 12 weeks from radiation therapy…” that this 
specifically refers to radiotherapy of the brain; it now reads: “8. Patients may not be 
less than [ADDRESS_1216974] 4 weeks apart or 
histopathologic confirmation”.  Given recent inquires, for EC 15, added a note on how 
to clarify if a patient has an unrelated malignancy requiring current active treatment by 
[CONTACT_871394] [ADDRESS_1216975] be on file confirming that said unrelated malignancy does not 
require current active treatment (prophylactic like tamoxifen OK) and that the patient is 
stable with low risk of recurrence and/or death within the next 3 years (i e, is stable). If 
this letter is not on file, a consult with the Sponsor’s medical designee is required prior 
to submitting the patient for enrollment in the trial.
•Table 1 and Section  12.3 Follow-up PVSRIPO Infusion: Added 3 ml of blood collection 
at Day 1 (or Day 2) post-PVSRIPO infusion to explore inflammation-associated 
biomarkers/ for immunologic analysis.
•Section  12.8.6 Definition of Unacceptable Adverse Event:  In response to a site 
question, clarified language regarding unacceptable AE to specify relationship to 
protocol/test procedure, listed the tests/procedures that were applicable and defined 
what reversible means; an unacceptable AE is any grade 3 or grade 4 toxicity 
considered related (possibly, probably or definitely) to a protocol treatment (includes 
surgical biopsy/infusion procedure, PVSRIPO, lomustine, bevacizumab, 
corticosteroids) that is not reversible (i e, does not improve to ≤ grade [ADDRESS_1216976] grade level to next lower 
grade level) within 2 weeks. This includes any treatment-related life-threatening event 
or any treatment-related death. No material changes were made to the exceptions 
that follow this paragraph.

 5 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS AND RESEARCH SUMMARY 
Protocol Title: A Multicenter Phase 2 Study of Oncolytic Polio/Rhinovirus Recombinant 
(PVSRIPO) in Recurrent WHO Grade IV Malignant Gliom a Patients 
Protocol 
Number: Pro00077024  
Study Design: The purpose of this single-arm multicenter Phase 2 is to  investigate the 
safety and efficacy (anti-tumor response and survival) of PVSRIPO in 
recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV ma lignant glioma. 
Patients will be administered PVSRIPO intratumorally via convection 
enhanced delivery (CED) and followed per the Schedule of Study Tests 
and Procedures for Initial PVSRIPO Treatment ( Table 1 ). Retreatment 
with PVSRIPO is allowed, provided the retreatment eli gibility criteria are 
met. Patients retreated with PVSRIPO will be followe d per the Schedule 
of Study Tests and Procedures for PVSRIPO Retreatment ( Table 2 ).   
Phase: Phase 2  
 
Objectives: Primary Objective: 
• To estimate the objective anti-tumor response rate an d response 
duration among adults with recurrent WHO grade IV mal ignant 
glioma treated with PVSRIPO 
Secondary Objectives: 
• To assess the safety of PVSRIPO 
• To assess survival outcomes of adults with recurrent WHO gra de 
IV malignant glioma treated with PVSRIPO relative to  a historical 
control group  
• To assess the disease control rate following PVSRIPO in fusion 
Exploratory Objectives: 
• To describe changes visualized on imaging due to intratumo ral 
inoculation of PVSRIPO 
• To assess immunologic responses in peripheral blood and i n 
serum 
• To identify genetic predictors of response or failure of  response 
to treatment with PVSRIPO 
• To obtain the quantitative gut microbiome profile via  the 
OMNIgene®•GUT (OMR-200) kit to determine any potential 
influence in response to PVSRIPO 
• To explore future molecular genetic analyses of the buf fy coat to 
determine the genetic characteristics of these samples to  
determine any potential influence in response to PVSRI PO 
• As part of a smaller sub-study only at DUMC, subjects enro lled at 
this center may have blood drawn prior to PVSRIPO inf usion 
(both pre- and post-PV booster) and 1 week after PVS RIPO 
infusion to explore inflammation-associated biomarkers, im mune 
cell phenotype and innate and adaptive immune compete nce 
• Assess anti-tumor responses and outcomes following PVSRIPO  
retreatment(s) or treatment with any other non-protoco l specified 
therapy

 machinery, which stimulates viral, cap-independent translation via the HRV2 IRES in 
cancerous cells. 
 
In a phase 1 dose-finding study that enrolled patients with recurrent gr ade IV malignant 
glioma, PVSRIPO was well tolerated, with dominant adverse effects being 
complications from localized tumor inflammation and the secondary prolonged  use of 
steroids, particularly at higher doses of PVSRIPO. To limit these effects, the dose was 
de-escalated, and the trial continued as a dose expansion study. The trial closed to n ew 
accrual on 5/31/2017. There has been no evidence of propagation of infectious vi rus 
beyond the tumors in these patients nor evidence of viral encephalomyelitis, 
poliomyelitis, meningitis, or systemic autoimmune reactions. There is evidence that, i n 
addition to a direct cytotoxic effect of PVSRIPO on infected tumor cells, this treatment 
generates an immune response against the tumor itself, which can lead to a redu ction in 
tumor size. The localized inflammatory response is observed on imaging, and, as 
observed with other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], it is difficult to distinguish between localized 
inflammation and tumor progression. In some subjects with possible disease 
progression observed by [CONTACT_871400], the decision was made to  
treat with temozolomide or lomustine. A number of patients treated with temozolom ide 
or lomustine after PVSRIPO infusion showed a rapid decrease in tumor volume after  
initiation of chemotherapy. However, this tumor control was lost in some patients if they 
remained on therapy for a prolonged period. Immune monitoring in a  limited number of 
patients showed: 1) contraction of a specific, high-impact subset of 
(immunosuppressive) T-regulatory cells; and 2) beginning expansion of effector T- cells 
at the nadir ([ADDRESS_1217003] lomustine). Any such beneficial effect is likely to be lost upon 
standard multicycle chemotherapy, as subsequent lymphodepletions will eventually 
dampen the immune system’s capacity to target the tumor. 
 
Therefore, in this study, we initially proposed to evaluate a single intratumoral 
administration of PVSRIPO in combination with a single cycle of lomustine [ADDRESS_1217004] 9-cycle/1-year regimen for the followi ng reasons: 
a) Information stemming from patients treated with lomustine post-PVSRIPO on a 
phase 1 clinical protocol suggests significant clinical response, radiographic response, 
and the involvement of an antitumor immune component (ie, a PVSRIPO-induce d 
antitumor memory response) occurring after the first cycle, with no evidence for fu rther 
benefit with additional cycles of lomustine thereafter; b) this is in line with much 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_871375]-damaging 
chemotherapy, eg lomustine or temozolomide, in conjunction with immunotherapy 
regimens. Lymphodepletion is believed to generate an ‘immunologic reset’ by [CONTACT_871401] T-cell subsets and favoring preferential expansion of T-cell  
populations with pro-inflammatory activation phenotypes during immune recovery. While 
the immunologic benefits of lymphodepletive chemotherapy is well documented, it is 
equally well known that standard cycle-therapy ( eg with one year of lomustine) 
produces long-term immune suppression by [CONTACT_871402] o f immune 
recovery following the initial cycle of lomustine4. However, a preliminary review of safety 
and related information of 50 patients treated on study (24 on the PVSRIPO only arm 
and 26 on the PVSRIPO with lomustine arm) was conducted and there was no apparent

synthesis occurs upon recruitment of a multi-partite protein complex at the canonical 5 ’ 
‘cap’ structure. PV RNAs are un-capped and, hence, rely on cap-independent 
translation for viral protein synthesis. This involves direct recruitment of ribosomal 
subunits via binding of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G to viral RNA ( Figure 1 )29. 
eIF4G-binding occurs via the IRES, a cis-acting genetic element located in the 5’ 
untranslated region of the viral RNA. In tumor cells, this process is highly efficient, due 
to un-hinged signal transduction networks that greatly favor ribosome recruitme nt to 
viral RNA . 
PVSRIPO is deemed acceptable for investigation in humans, including after 
intracerebral inoculation, because it is incapable of driving viral translation in normal 
brain cells17. This is due to profound neuronal incompetence of the foreign HRV2 IRES 
in its genome. The foreign HRV2 IRES cannot recruit eIF4G to the viral genome, 
precluding viral protein synthesis in neuronal cells/the normal brain30. By [CONTACT_871404], early step in the infectious cycle specifically in neurons, PVSRIPO 
neurovirulence is eliminated.

toxicology, biodistribution, shedding and neutralizing antibody tests with intrathalamic 
inoculation of up to 5 x 109 TCID50  of PVSRIPO in M. Fascicularis31. These revealed: (i) 
absence of morbidity and mortality; (ii) absence of neuropathological signs consisten t 
with virus-induced CNS damage; (iii) absence of virus dissemination from the brain o r 
viremia; (iv) absence of extraneural replication; (v) absence of shedding with sa liva, 
urine or stool; (vi) presence of a neutralizing antibody response. 
7.2.[ADDRESS_1217007]- in-human oncolytic PV, PVSRIPO, therapy was initiated at the Preston Robert 
Tisch Brain Tumor Center (PRTBTC) at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) in 
early 2012 as a phase 1 trial in patients with histologically confirmed recurrent WHO 
grade IV malignant glioma (glioblastoma or gliosarcoma ; size of 1-5.5 cm). The study 
was closed to accrual on 5/31/2017 after 61 patients were treated. Key inclusion criter ia 
in this clinical trial included: ≥ 18 years, adequate performance status/organ function,  
and prior PV immunity. Key exclusion criteria included: pregnant/breast-feeding 
females, those who have received radiotherapy less than 12 weeks prior, and those 
with known immune dysfunction or febrile and/or other systemic illnesses. Patients were 
given a booster of inactivated PV vaccine ≥1 week, but not > [ADDRESS_1217008] underwent biopsy of the lesion to confirm

Page [ADDRESS_1217009] a catheter placed into the tumor ≥ [ADDRESS_1217010] from t he 
ventricles. The catheter was tunneled 5 cm under the scalp and connected to a n 
infusion pump. The agent was then infused at a rate of 0.5 mL/hr over a period of 6.5 
hours. In the investigational new drug (IND) toxicology studies in NHPs, no dose-limiting 
toxicities were observed, and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The 
starting dose in this first- in-human trial was 1 x 108 TCID50, which is 1/10th of the 
highest non-toxic dose in NHPs from the definitive, IND-directed toxicology study and 
1/50th of the highest non-toxic dose in NHPs from the dose-range finding toxicology 
study. In the dose escalation portion of the phase 1 trial, cohorts of patients were do sed 
at 1 x 108 TCID50 (dose level 1), followed by 3.3 x 108 (level 2), 1 x 109 (level 3), 3.3 x 
109 (level 4), and 1 x 1010 (level 5). The rationale and outcome associated with 
subsequent dose reductions to 3.3 x 108 (level 2), 5 x 107 (level -1), and 1.0 x 107 (level 
-2) are described below.
Dose Escalation Phase : The first [ADDRESS_1217011] was still alive (as of 5/31/2017)  and 
remained disease free for an extended period following initial treatment with PVSRIPO 
followed by [CONTACT_871405] (approximately 43 months) but has since been re-treated with  
a second infusion of PVSRIPO at dose level -[ADDRESS_1217012]-
treatment and had difficulty weaning down steroids following study drug administration 
due to cerebral edema possibly due to localized inflammation and/or progressive 
disease. As of 5/31/2017, the 2 patients treated at dose level 1 and 2 did not suffe r any 
significant toxicities and were alive with “No Evidence of Disease” 61+ and 60+ months 
from treatment, respectively. The patient at dose level [ADDRESS_1217013] all di ed of 
progressive disease 6-16 months following treatment. 
Dose Reductions to Dose Level -1 and -2 : Due to the continuing requirement for 
steroids in all of the additional patients treated at dose level 2 because of localized  
inflammation, due to treatment and/or tumor growth, a decision was made to de -
escalate to dose level -1 (5 x 107 TCID50). By 6/16/2016, twenty-four patients had been 
treated at dose level -1, including 12 patients that were treated more than 1 2 months 
prior. Three of these 12 subjects demonstrated tumor reduction without significant

concentration of the therapeutic agent at the tumor site, while minimizing systemic 
exposure, PVSRIPO will be delivered directly into the tumor. Significant pre-clinical 
antitumor activity of PVSRIPO has been observed in several rodent tumor models and 
in vitro. PVSRIPO was devoid of neuropathogenicity when injected into the thalami of 
NHPs even at doses as high as 5 x 109 TCID50. Also, the phase 1 trial of PVSRIPO in 
adults with recurrent WHO grade IV malignant glioma did not yield evidence of viral 
encephalomyelitis, poliomyelitis or meningitis with a proportion of patients achieving 
prolonged disease survival up to 92+ months. The main toxicity attributable to PVSRIPO 
has been post-treatment peri-tumoral inflammation that has required  prolonged steroid 
therapy and/or low-dose bevacizumab to control edema.

Page [ADDRESS_1217015] will be withdrawn from the study . Subjects 
in screening for retreatment whose biopsy does not confirm recurrence will not be 
retreated with PVSRIPO, but will remain on study in follow- up. 
 
The biopsy needle and catheter will be placed by [CONTACT_871406] a pre-operative MRI. After biopsy, a 
catheter [Vygon PIC-030 (Sophysa, Inc.; Crown Point, IN)] will be implanted in the 
operating room using sterile techniques, which may occur under general anesthe sia, at 
the same site or a different site from that used for the biopsy. The catheter will be  
implanted with in, or as close to, an enhancing region of tumor as possible ≥ [ADDRESS_1217016] 
from the ventricles. Based on prior experiences, a tumor ≤ 1cm from the vent ricles can 
safely and feasibly have a catheter tip placed ≥ 1cm from the ventricles while minimizing 
the possibility of infusate entering the ventricles. The catheter will be tunneled bene ath 
the scalp for a distance of at least 5 cm to aid in the prevention of infection. A computed 
tomography (CT) scan will be used to confirm catheter placement post-operatively. 
Anesthesia administration is discontinued once there is CT confirmation of the catheter 
placement, as applicable.  
 
Patients who are taking (and are stable on) less than or equal to 4 mg per day of  
dexamethasone (ie, low-dose corticosteroid) within the 2 weeks prior to admission for 
any PVSRIPO infusion (ie, patients who meet the relevant eligibility criterion) may 
continue on this dose. The administration of high-dose corticosteroids will be lim ited 
while on study due to concerns that high-dose corticosteroids might negatively impact 
the efficacy of PVSRIPO. However, high-dose corticosteroids may be administered on a 
limited basis to patients prior to, during, or after PVSRIPO infusion only when 
determined to be medically necessary. 
 
9.1.2  PVSRIPO Infusion  
 
The entire volume of the agent to be delivered will be pre-loaded into a syringe  and 
connected to the catheter under sterile conditions in the appropriate clinical care u nit 
(eg neurointensive care unit/intensive care unit or neuro step-down unit) just prio r to 
beginning of infusion. Due to the complexity of scheduling all of the necessary 
components for the infusion (operating room time, pharmacy time, and rad iology 
appointments), a +1 day window has been built into the study for the study drug 
infusion. This means that the infusion is allowed to start the following day after  the 
biopsy/catheter placement. This will still be considered “day 0” in regard to the p rotocol 
and the timing of the subsequent events. At the time of virus injection, emerge ncy 
drugs, including epi[INVESTIGATOR_871378], oxygen saturation, and cardiac rhythm will be monitored. Drug infusion will occur 
in the appropriate clinical care unit so that all other emergency facilities will be availa ble. 
Patients will be treated with a prophylactic antibiotic prior to biopsy and catheter 
insertion per the institution’s neurosurgical standard practice.

board (IRB) and FDA-approved trials using similar infusion technique s, patien ts will be 
infused at a rate of 0.5 mL/hr. A Medfusion™  3500 infusion pump (Smith s Medical, 
Minneapoli s, MN) or an y other comparab le FDA-cleared syringe infusion pump 
approv ed by [CONTACT_345266], will be pre-programmed to a delivery rate of 
0.5 mL/hr. The infusate will be loaded in an infusion syringe into the syringe pump at the 
initial onse t to avo id any interruptions in the infusion. The total amoun t of the infusate 
delivered to the patien t will be 3 mL. The catheter itself (30 cm length, 1 mm interior 
diameter) cannot be pre-loaded with virus suspension . Therefore, the infusion pump will 
be programmed for delivery o f 3.25 mL (0.25 mL to accoun t for catheter “dead space” 
with 3.0 mL delivered to the patient) . The infusion pump will be programmed for delivery 
of 0.5 mL/hr over approximately 6.5 hours (stopped when delivered amoun t is between 
3.125 and 3.250 mL). The catheter will be removed in the appropriate clinica l care unit. 
No sedation is required for catheter removal. A non-contrasted CT scan of the bra in will 
be used after catheter removal to confirm there is no bleed post catheter removal. 
The infusion catheter (PIC 030) and infusion tubing (PIT 400) are manufactured by 
[CONTACT_248567] , Inc. (Crown Point , IN) and supplied to the sites according to the Study 
Administration Manual ( SAM ). The Infusion Catheter Kit is a 30 cm clear, open-ended 
catheter (1.0 mm ID/2.0 mm OD) with [ADDRESS_1217017] stopcock connector with air 
filter, 4 m of microbore tubing with a ntisiphon valve, a red, vented cap and a white luer 
lock cap. The catheter produc ts are packaged sterile and non-pyrogenic and are 
intended for single (one-time) use only (see the infusion procedures in the study 
procedure manual).

PVSRIP O infusate for tracking purpose s, will no longer be manufactured nor be readily 
available in the US. This change was not related to product quality, safety, or efficacy 
(see:  FDA website for more information ). Therefore, for patients enrolled after 
10OCT2019 , addition of Magnevist® to the infusate was not required and the 
corresponding post-infusion MRI to occur with in [ADDRESS_1217020]-infusion in an effort to track 
infusate was also removed. 
9.1.4  Biopsy Sa mpling and Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study-Related Biopsy 
Prior to catheter placemen t and PVSRIP O infusion , a biopsy will be performed. The 
biopsy for the first PVSRIP O infusion will consist o f taking multiple samples as 
described below. 
1.A tumor tissue sample will be collected for review via routine histology to confirm
tumor recurrence by [CONTACT_871408](s) for confirmation of eligibility.  For the
first PVSRIPO infusion only, the study’s central neuropathologist at Duke, Dr. R.
McLendon or his design ee, will also provide a determination of histology upon
receipt of tissue, but this is not necessary for confirmation of eligibility. This wil l
require the sites to ship one H&E stained slide from the first PVSRIPO infusion
biopsy to DUMC (see pathology section of the SAM for additional information).
Additional unstained slides from this biopsy and others for subsequent PVSRIPO
infusion(s) may also be required, depending on the routine pathology/biomarker
tests that the site performs.
Additional pathology/biomarker tests that may be performed include, but are no t 
limited to, the following: 
•Anti-PV receptor
•EGFRvIII and w ild-type EGFR status
•O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter
methylation and MGMT immunohistochemistry
•Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2
•Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)
•Programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD-1)/programmed death-ligand
1 (PD-L1)
If any of these tests are routinely performed at the study site per standard o f care 
practice, these tests will not be repeated at DUMC. In these instances, the sites will 
Pro00077024: PVSRIPO 
Version 8: 07FEB2020  
Page 44 of 94 enter their local pathology results into the electronic case report form (eCRF). F or 
specific tests outlined in the pathology manual that are not run at the sites, unstaine d 
slides will be shipped to DUMC so that these tests can be conducted. Please see 
the pathology manual for the number and type of slides needed for each test. If a 
site would prefer to send a tissue block instead of unstained slides, that is permitted.  
If there is not enough tissue to perform all of these tests, the tests will be r un in order 
of priority per the pathology manual. 
2.After acquiring sufficient tissue for standard clinical pathologic testing (#1), up to
three additional core biopsies will be obtained, if possible. These additional core
biopsies will be frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound and kept at liquid
nitrogen temperature. They will be used for genetic analysis, including full geno me
or full exome sequencing, as well as other molecular genetic testing. The goal of
these molecular genetic tests is to identify genetic predictors of response or failure of
response to treatment with PVSRIPO. The molecular genetic testing will include, but
is not limited to, DNA sequencing, gene amplification, and gene expression. Plea se
see the pathology section of the SAM for information on core biopsy processing and
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].
[IP_ADDRESS] Archival Tissue 
Tissue samples from archival tissue, including initial surgical procedure where WHO 
grade IV malignan t glioma was confirmed and any additiona l surgical procedures for 
recurrence prior to enrolling in the PVSRIP O clinical trial, will also be collected. These 
tissue samples may be tested for, but not limited to, the pathology/biomarkers listed in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . Additionally, 10 unstained slides will be requested from each previous 
surgical procedure/biopsy for genetic analysis. 
If any of the pathology/biomarker tests mentioned in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] are routinely 
performed at the study site per standard of care practice and the information is available 
for the applicab le archival tissue , these tests will not be repeated at DUMC. In these 
instance s, the sites will enter their local pathology results into the eCRF. For specific 
tests outlined in the pathology manua l that are not run at the sites, unstained slides will 
be shipped to Duke so that these tests can be conducted. Please see the pathology 
section of the SAM for the number and type of slides needed for each test. If a site 
would prefer to send a tissue b lock instead o f unstained slides, that is permitted. If there 
is no t enough tissue to perform all of these tests, the tests will be run in order of priority 
per the pathology section o f the SAM. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Future Surgical Procedures 
Administration of PVSRIPO is associated with an inflammatory immune response that 
can result in a pseudoprogressive tumor appearance on radiographic imaging. 
Following PVSRIPO administration , patients should not undergo tumor resection based 
on radiographic tumor progression, without prior consultation with the stu dy-designated 
Pro00077024: PVSRIPO 
Version 8: 07FEB2020  
Page [ADDRESS_1217021](s) and/or ISC excep t in cases of eminen t life-threatening emergency. 
Shou ld subjects have a resection or biopsy after coming off study, each site will be 
responsible for requesting samples of this resected/biopsied tissue , which will then be 
sent to DUMC for pathology/biomarker tissue analysis. If a subject consents, portion s of 
resected/biopsied tissue will be delivered to the DUMC study neuropathologist , Dr. R. 
McLendon or his designate , for histopathological ana lyses and to Dr. M. Gromeier or his 
designate for correlative molecular analyses. The histopathological analyses may 
include, but are not limited to, the same pathology/biomarker tests listed in Section  
[IP_ADDRESS] . The correlative molecular analyses will require [ADDRESS_1217022] clinical pathologic testing. 
If any of the pathology/biomarker tests mentioned in Section [IP_ADDRESS] are routinely 
performed at the study site per standard of care practice for the samples collected from 
future surgical procedures , these tests will not be repeated a t DUMC. In these 
instance s, the sites will enter their local pathology results into the eCRF. For specific 
tests outlined in the pathology manua l that are not run at the sites, unstained slides will 
be shipped to DUMC so that these tests can be conducted. Please see the pathology 
section of the SAM for the number and type of slides needed for each test. If a site 
would prefer to send a tissue b lock instead o f unstained slides, that is permitted. If there 
is no t enough tissue to perform all of these tests, the tests will be run in order of priority

9.1.5  Lomustine (PVSRIPO +  Lomustine Ar m Only) 
Prior to implementation of protocol version 7, for patien ts randomized to the PVSRIPO 
with lomustine arm , lomustine was dispensed as an oral therapy a t 110 mg/m2 one time 
only [ADDRESS_1217023] was on bevacizumab (had been 
treated with bevacizumab in the time since PVSRIP O infusion) , the lomustine dose was 
dispensed as an oral therapy at 90 mg/m2 one time only [ADDRESS_1217024]’s weigh t at the week [ADDRESS_1217025] date they took the lomustine and dosage amount taken for 
documentation. 
9.1.6  Safety Considerations  
Lomustine safety:  Although not applicable after protocol version 7, the major toxicity of 
lomustine is delayed bone marrow suppression , so blood counts were monitored at a 
frequency determined by [CONTACT_1963] . Given that lomustine was administered 
only once and pulmonary toxicity with lomustine is a cumulat ive toxicity, a pulmonary 
function test in the PVSRIP O + lomustine arm was no t be required . Long-term use of 
nitrosoureas has been reported to be possibly associated with the developmen t of 
secondar y malignancies, which shou ld be prevented by [CONTACT_2224] a single cycle o f

of care practices. 
 
Surgical Complications:  The stereotactic tumor biopsies and catheter implantation 
procedure carries a risk for cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_28062], infection, hemorrhage, loss of 
neurologic function, non-neurologic complications and death. These risks depend 
primarily on the preoperative condition of the patient, the size and location of the  tumor 
and associated diseases. In addition, as is standard with surgical procedures, potential 
complications for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84065]-coagulation therapy prior to surgery may include hear t 
attack, stroke or other life-threatening blood clots. The potential risk for the patie nt will 
be discussed in detail with the patient and family by [CONTACT_871409]’s designee. 
 
Anesthesia: Patients undergoing general anesthesia may be subjected to associated  
risks including pneumothorax, pneumonia, airway injury, hypotension, myocardial 
infarction, stroke, hepatic and renal injury and death. 
 
Poliomyelitis:  PVSRIPO has been tested in NHPs according to the WHO standardized 
monkey neurovirulence tests. These tests revealed the absence of neuropathoge nic 
properties, evident as failure to induce symptoms of poliomyelitis in NHP s after 
intracerebral inoculation of virus. However, PVSRIPO is a replication-competent viral 
agent that, in principle, retains the potential to cause motor neuron damage. Possible  
complications include transient or permanent mono- or paraparesis, paralysis, a nd life-
threatening respi[INVESTIGATOR_5448]. 
 
Virus Recombination and Mutation:  PVSRIPO retains the ability to alter its genome 
during replication upon administration to patients. Various mechanisms are known to 
lead to genetic adaptation, including spontaneous mutagenesis and recombination that 
may give rise to viral progeny with changed properties. Empi[INVESTIGATOR_871381]. However, the occurrence of 
such events cannot be categorically excluded in patients receiving intracerebral 
PVSRIPO. Genetic changes may cause an altered phenotype of PVSRIPO, including 
adaptation to improved virus replication in the normal CNS. 
 
Long -Term Sequelae of Virus Injection: PVSRIPO does not encode foreign gene tic 
material; PVs are unable to insert viral genetic material in the host genome and  PVs are 
incapable of inducing latent or chronic CNS infection. Therefore, PVSRIPO is unable to  
induce long-term expression of foreign polypeptides or long-term persistence. Thu s, 
there are no long-term neurologic consequences to intracerebral PVSRIPO 
administration in study subjects. For these reasons, no specific measures to analyze the 
potential for persistence of virus replication in the CNS of long-term survivors are 
indicated. 
 
Gastrointestinal Infection and Virus Excretion: After oral uptake,  PV replicates in the 
gastrointestinal tract and is excreted by [CONTACT_871410]. Gastrointestinal 
Pro00077024: PVSRIPO 
Version 8: 07FEB2020  
Page 47 of 94 viral replication usually is asymptomatic but may cause mild symptoms of 
gastrointestinal discomfort. Excretion of PVSRIP O with stool doe s not occur after 
intracerebral inoculation in immunized/boosted patients. This is based on thorough 
testing in [ADDRESS_1217027]-in-human phase 1 trial and much historical evidence 
from investigations in NHP s. 
Cerebral Edema and Increased Intracranial Pressure:  Cerebral edema may be 
secondar y to the disease process itse lf, the surgical procedure , necrosis from previous 
radiation , or inflammation due to immune infiltration of the brain or destruction of tumor 
cells, which may manife st as neurologic dysfunction . Symptoms o f neurologic 
dysfunction due to cerebral edema may include , but are not limited to, seizure s, severe 
headache, confusion , letharg y, unresponsivene ss, coma , or focal neurological deficits. 
Patien ts will be monitored throughout the course of the study and upon any sign s or 
symptom s of cerebral edema , may have their stero id doses increased or receive 
treatmen t with an antiangiogen ic agen t (according to Special Considerations below), 
osmotic diure tic, or surgical decompression . Edema that fails to respond to aggressive 
therap y may lead to permanen t neurological impairment. The probability o f this risk can 
be predicted to some degree based upon tumor size, location , preoperative neurological 
impairment, and post-operative course prior to virus administration. The risks will be 
discussed with t he subject and the subject’s  family. Guideline s for reporting serious 
adverse events (SAEs) related to neurologic dysfunction due to cerebral edema are 
details in Section 12.8.4 .  
Special Consideration:  In the event a patien t demonstrates neurolog ic or radiographic 
signs suggestive of a localized inflammatory reaction secondary to the immune 
response triggered by [CONTACT_871411] O that requires a dose of dexamethasone above [ADDRESS_1217028]-PVSRIP O infusion , every effort should be made not to 
increase the dose o f dexamethasone further . Instead , patien ts shou ld be treated with 
bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg IV every [ADDRESS_1217029] require s planned treatmen t with 
bevacizumab > 7.5 mg/kg ever y 3 weeks , they w ill be considered off study and enter the 
follow-up phase . Neuroimaging (MRI) will be performed according to protocol schedule, 
and at that time, it will be assessed whether further treatmen t with bevacizumab is 
needed to control the cerebral inflammation . It is recommended that bevacizumab

 In initial phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, four potential bevacizumab-associated adverse 
events (AEs) were identified: hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic events, a nd 
hemorrhage. Additional completed phase [ADDRESS_1217030] cancer, gastrointestinal perforations, wound-heali ng 
complications, and arterial thromboembolic events. These and other safety signals a re 
described in further detail in the bevacizumab package insert. 
 
If there are AEs or other circumstances prohibiting the use of bevacizumab, 
corticosteroids or surgery, or other interventions deemed more appropriate for  the 
patient by [CONTACT_1963], will be used, if needed, to treat any localize d 
inflammatory reaction secondary to PVSRIPO. 
 
Risk of Infection: The intracerebral catheter placement and infusion may include the  risk 
of infection. However, similar procedures including stereotactic biopsy and 
ventriculostomy placement are commonly used in the routine clinical care of patients 
with malignant brain tumors with a very low and acceptable rate of infection. In the m ost 
extreme situation, however, infection may lead to systemic bacterial/fungal sepsis and 
possibly death. The risk of infection will be minimized by [CONTACT_871412]. Patients will be monitored throughout the co urse 
of the study for any signs and symptoms of infection. If an active infection is suspected, 
patients will be cultured and treated with appropriate antibiotics. 
 
Risk of Phlebotomy: Drawing blood or inserting an intravenous catheter into an ar m vein 
may result in bruising or swelling in the area of the insertion, bleeding at the site of th e 
needle puncture, light headedness, fainting and very rarely, local infection, which ma y 
be severe. These risks are reduced by [CONTACT_248584] a 
qualified physician, nurse or phlebotomist (a professional trained to draw blood). 
 
Risks of MRIs:  Risks and/or discomforts associated with MRI scans include anxiety 
produced from being in a tight, enclosed space (claustrophobia). In addition, the 
machine operates using a large and powerful magnet, which attracts certain metals. 
Therefore, people with these metals in their bodies (specifically pacemakers, infusion 
pumps, metal aneurysm clips, metal prostheses, joints, rods or plates) will be excluded 
from the study. Patients will also be checked to make sure that they do not bring any 
metal objects into the MRI facility. Dental fillings are less affected by [CONTACT_871413]. Patients will be asked to let the p hysicians 
conducting this study know of any metal in their bodies other than dental fillings. 
 
Allergic Reactions to Contrast Agents:  For MRI with contrast (considered standard of 
care for follow-up of rGBM patients) , a contrast agent is administered through the vein, 
which requires the placement of an IV catheter. The catheter placement is simil ar to 
drawing blood except that the catheter remains in the vein during the time th e agent is 
actively delivered. The risks of a blood draw and insertion of a catheter are similar. 
There have been a few, rare cases of allergies to the agent used in MRI contra st 
Pro00077024: PVSRIPO 
Version 8: 07FEB2020  
Page [ADDRESS_1217031] agen ts will be excluded from the study. Patien ts with less 
severe allerg ies (ie, manageable with prophylaxis ) should be pretreated with Tylenol® 
and Benadryl® prior to injection of the contras t agent , per the treating clinician . Prior to 
protocol version 8, in addition to the gadolinium (contra st agent) being given for MRI 
contrast, it was also co-infused with the study drug to assess infusion distribution. As 
noted previou sly, production of the contrast agen t was discontinued by [CONTACT_871414]-safe ty reasons and will no longer be included in the infusate. This 
approach to gadolinium administration was no t FDA approved. The potentia l risks of 
intracerebral infusion of gadolinium contrast agen ts  were no t completely kno wn but  
were believed to be small. Risks for infusion of gadolinium contrast agen ts intrathecally 
for procedures such as cister nography have been somewhat better studied, and were 
recently summarized by [CONTACT_248586] (2009)37. Encephalopathy, coma and seizures 
have been reported as side effects in case reports of accidental administration of large 
amounts of gadolinium contrast agents intrathecally in human s36,38. When these 
contra st agen ts are used in an appropriately low dose , however , the risk of intrathecal 
administration appears reasonably low. No neurological sequelae attributable to the 
procedure were detected in a series of [ADDRESS_1217032] material during M RI examination s, a reaction called 
nephrogenic systemic fibro sis (NSF) . Patients with kidney disease are at increased risk 
of developi[INVESTIGATOR_248526]. NSF may cause skin thickening , joint pain and/or swelling. In rare 
cases NSF can lead to lung and hear t problems and cause death. In addition, given 
new information of possible retention of gadolinium-based contrast agents, only MRIs 
absolutely necessary for the proper managemen t of the subject’s condition  will be 
obtained. 
Risks to Househo ld Conta cts of Study Subjects:  Primate toxicology studies showed that 
intracerebral infusion of PVSRIP O does no t lead to extraneural dissemination or 
replication and, hence , is no t associated with virus shedding . Therefore , and because 
PV transmission occurs via the fecal-oral route , the likeliho od of unintended exposure of 
patien t househo ld conta cts is exceedingly low. I f accidental exposure occurred , it would 
equal the risk o f exposure to any type [ADDRESS_1217033] to be considered part of the human environment, exposure to PVSRIP O would not 
represen t an added risk beyond the possibility for exposure that already exists. 
Unkno wn Risks:  The overall risk classification o f this research is unknown.

colorless liquid with no evidence of particulates or foreign matter. Details on the supply, 
receipt, and storage of PVSRIPO will be outlined in the SAM. 
 
10.1.4  Dispensing and Preparation 
 
For aliquot preparation, the agent will be thawed slowly on ice (4 C) and kept at that 
temperature. Thawed vials of PVSRIPO are stable at 4°C for 48 hours. PVSRIPO 
contained in the clinically intended delivery apparatus ( ie, ready for infusion) is stable at 
room temperature for 18 hours but should be used as soon as possible. The  
manufacturer will provide the study agent’s potency (as TCIDs) and will also supply the 
appropriate vehicle for aliquot preparation. Aliquot preparation will occu r in each 
institution’s designated investigational pharmacy preparation center. All handling of the 
study agent will occur in a biosafety cabinet or a similarly contained environment. 
 
Any materials in contact [CONTACT_62041], eg syringes, vials, etc., will be disposed of 
as biological waste.  The final desired aliquot of the study agent infusate will be 
prepared at the intended volume, which is sufficient for priming the infusion tubing  and 
for infusion. The capped infusion syringe containing infusate (and primed infusion tub ing 
if primed in pharmacy) will be transported to the study site in a ‘ziplock’ bag placed in a 
portable cooler or similarly contained transport device with a frozen ice block/ice pack, 
in order to maintain a temperature of approximately 4°C.  There is no need t o monitor 
the temperature during transport to the bedside. 
 
Details on dispensing and preparing study agent will be outlined in the Investigational 
Product–handling portion of the SAM. 
 
10.1.5  Compliance and Accountability  
 
Drug accountability records will be maintained for all clinical trial supplies. All empty and 
partially used clinical trial supplies will be destroyed in accordance with institutional 
guidelines. Each site’s designated investigational pharmacy will maintain detailed 
documentation of the receipt and/or destruction of the study agent, which will then  be 
provided to the Sponsor or designee. All materials coming in contact [CONTACT_871415], the syringe delivered from the investigational pharmacy, tubing, dressings o r 
coverings used to protect the trepanation site, will be disposed of as biological waste in 
the treatment room.

Page [ADDRESS_1217039]- PVSRIPO treatment. In the phase 1 PVSRIPO clinical trial, an initial 
increase in the extent of FLAIR abnormalities could be observed after PVSRIPO,  
followed by a decrease in the extent of FLAIR abnormalities. In addition, an initial 
increase in size of the enhancing lesion with multiple cystic degeneration was observed 
(“swiss cheese” or “honeycomb” appearance), as well as an extension of enhancing 
disease toward previously non-enhancing infiltrative disease, followed by a tumor 
retraction. Depending on the size of the tumor, the changes could be observed u p to [ADDRESS_1217040](s) /ISC prior 
to administration of non-protocol-specified treatments and/or surgical resection , if 
radiographic progression is suspected. 
 
For lesion measurement, the axial post contrast T1 slice where the enhancing lesion is 
at the largest on the baseline screening MRI (pre-infusion MRI), should be iden tified as 
the “target lesion.” Please note that as per RANO criteria for determination of target 
lesion, the enhancing lesion should measure at least [ADDRESS_1217041] demonstrated that on follow-up imaging, a n 
initial change in configuration of the target lesion is expected, often with increase in size 
of the lesion; this is due to the process of intratumoral administration itself and the 
immunotherapy effect of PVSRIPO, which often triggers microcystic degeneration of t he 
previously densely enhancing area, as well as an extension of an enhancing immune 
reaction into previously non-enhancing infiltrative disease. Such changes will not be 
described as progressive disease, but as “immunoprogression” (a term coined  for 
PVSRIPO, to distinguish from pseudoprogression, which is often reserved to imaging 
changes occurring after radiation therapy). This is often followed months later b y a 
tumor retraction.  
 
Complete response and partial response of the treated lesion will be defined using  the 
same criteria as in iRANO. However, in the case a patient is initiated on protocol 
specified dosage of bevacizumab for management of symptoms of immunoprogression 
and imaging demonstrates a complete or partial response of the target lesion wh ile on 
bevacizumab, this response must be maintained for at least 8 weeks after coming off 
low dose bevacizumab to be considered a treatment related radiographic response.  
 
Pro00077024: PVSRIPO 
Version 8: 07FEB2020  
Page 69 of 94 It is to note that with time, a number of patients develop a cystic/necrotic area with a thin 
rim of residual enhancement the same size (replacing the target lesion) or sometimes 
slightly larger than the previously densely enhancing target lesion, this should be 
labeled as stable disease.  
Given the radiographic changes post PVSRIPO making it impossible to properly identify 
true disease progression based solely on imaging criteria, per protocol, patients should 
not be taken off study for progressive disease based solely on imaging criteria. As per 
protocol, patients can come off study due to progression only once it has been sh own 
that they are not improving clinically with protocol allowed dose of bevacizumab only 
and therapy in addition to low dose bevacizumab must be added.

From these samples, immune signatures may be identified using patient peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells to 1) track longitudinally with clinical outcomes in  
PVSRIPO-treated patients to determine the precise mechanism responsible for the

 • Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur ( eg, social 
and/or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
• Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of preexisting diseases or conditions present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
 
Adverse events related to the non-standard of care screening procedures ( eg, polio 
vaccination booster) and biopsy/catheter placement procedure will be reported ( non-
treatment emergent adverse events). Treatment emergent adverse events will be noted 
from the time of infusion through the time the subject comes off study (as defin ed in 
Section 9.5 ), all AEs must be recorded in the subject’s medical record and AEs case 
report form. Subjects will be followed for SAEs for 30 days after coming off study. 
 
AEs will be assessed according to the CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events) version 4.03. If CTCAE grading does not exist for an AE, the severity 
of the AE will be graded as mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), life-thr eatening (4), or 
fatal (5). 
 
Attribution of AEs will be indicated as follows: 
• Definite: The AE is clearly related to the study drug(s) 
• Probably: The AE is likely related to the study drug(s) 
• Possible: The AE may be related to the study drug(s) 
• Unlikely: The AE is doubtfully related to the study drug(s) 
• Unrelated: The AE is clearly NOT related to the study drug(s) 
 
Attribution of AEs will be determined for each study intervention individually (cathe ter 
placement, PVSRIPO, lomustine (only for patients randomized to this arm prior to 
protocol version 7), bevacizumab, and corticosteroids). 
 
12.8.[ADDRESS_1217043]  
 
See section 9.1.6 for management of anticipated AEs. 
 
12.8.2  Reporting of AEs  
 
Any AE occurrence (spontaneously volunteered and enquired for, as well as ob served 
AEs) during the study must be documented in the patient’s medical records in 
accordance with the investigator’s normal clinical practice and on the AE page of the  
eCRF. SAEs that occur during the study must be documented in the patient’s m edical 
record, on the AE eCRF, and on the SAE form. 
 
The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on the  
signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should 
be documented as the AE (and SAE if serious) and not the individual signs/symptoms.

Page [ADDRESS_1217044] also be  
completed. A diagnosis, if known, or clinical signs or symptoms if the diagnosis is 
unknown, rather than the clinically significant laboratory finding or abnormal 
assessment, should be used to complete the AE/SAE page. If no diagnosis is known 
and clinical signs or symptoms are not present, then the abnormal finding should be 
recorded. Only laboratory results considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_871418] a diagnosis should be reported  as an 
AE. If an SAE report is completed, pertinent laboratory data should be recorded  on the 
SAE form, preferably with baseline values and copi[INVESTIGATOR_284944]. 
 
Reporting of any SAEs to applicable regulatory authorities will be the responsibility of 
the Sponsor or designee in compliance with local regulations. The SAE page should be  
completed as thoroughly as possible and signed by [CONTACT_871419]. It is very important that the investigator provide a n 
assessment of the causal relationship between the event and the study drug(s) at th e 
time of the initial report, as this will be useful for submissions to regulatory authorities. 
 
A database of all AEs (not just those considered related to the study drug(s)) will be 
maintained in 21 CFR Part 11 compliant database. The event will be categorized by 
[CONTACT_34565], relationship to treatment, its grade of severity, and resolution. Th e 
Sponsor/designee, along with an independent DSMB, will periodically review the 
collective AEs with the intention of identifying any trends or patterns in toxicity. If any 
such trends are identified, depending on their severity and frequency, a protoco l 
amendment will be considered. 
 
12.8.3  Serious Adverse Events  (SAEs) 
 
An AE is considered “serious” if it is one of the following outcomes: 
• Fatal 
• Life-threatening 
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• A medically significant condition (defined as an event that compromises subject 
safety or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the thre e 
outcomes above). 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]

The Sponsor is responsible for appropriate reporting of SAEs to the necessa ry 
regulatory bodies where appropriate. The Sponsor will report to the Investiga tors all 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) associated with PVSRIPO. 
The Investigator (or Sponsor where required) must report any S[LOCATION_003]Rs to th e IRB 
according to the Institution’s regulations. 
 
REPORTING OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS RELATED TO CEREBRAL EDEMA 
• Events related to cerebral edema that meet criteria for a serious adverse e vent 
(SAE) should be reported as described in the protocol and study procedure s (ie, 
within 24h of learning of the event). Investigators who have concerns about the  
protocol-specified medical management of cerebral edema, or the determinat ion 
of possible progressive disease, should contact [CONTACT_871421]-
oncologist to discuss the case as noted. 
• When reporting the SAE, describe the following in the narrative description o f 
the event: 
• Specific signs and symptoms of edema, such as seizures, headache, 
confusion, lethargy, unresponsiveness, coma, or focal neurologic deficits 
(eg, pyramidal tract syndrome, hemiparesis) 
• In addition, any specific signs or symptoms considered to be out of proportion for 
the extent of edema may be reported as additional SAEs, if indicated.   
• The narrative description should include the following: 
o Time to onset following PVSRIPO infusion 
o Maximum severity of signs and symptoms 
o Treatment(s) undertaken 
o Time to resolution as the information becomes available 
 
 
12.8.5  Toxicity Monitoring 
 
Pro00077024: PVSRIPO  
Version 8: 07FEB2020  
 
Page 74 of 94 
 Patients will be monitored for toxicity while on study. AEs will be categorized and 
graded in accordance with the NCI CTC AE (Version 4.03). Unacceptable AEs, as 
defined in  Section 12.8.6,  will be identified during this period of toxicity monitoring. 
 
12.8.6  Definition of Unacceptable Adverse Event  (ie, Adverse Events 
of Special Interest)  
 
An unacceptable AE (ie, adverse event of special interest; AESI) is any grade 3 or 
grade 4 toxicity considered related (possibly, probably or definitely ) to a protocol 
treatment (includes surgical biopsy/infusion procedure, PVSRIPO, lomustine (for 
patients randomized to this arm prior to protocol version 7), bevacizumab, 
corticosteroids) that is not reversible ( ie, does not improve to ≤ grade [ADDRESS_1217046] grade level to next lower 
grade level ) within 2 weeks. This includes any treatment-related life-threatening event or 
any treatment-related death. Any grade 2 or higher serious autoimmune to xicities—
particularly those affecting vital organs ( eg, cardiac, renal, CNS)—will also be 
considered unacceptable AEs if they occur within 2 weeks of any protocol treatment, 
whether the AE requires intervention.  
 
Exceptions to unacceptable AEs noted above are as follows, with or without supportive 
treatment: 
 
• Events associated with the biopsy procedure/catheter placement: seizures or 
hemorrhages occurring during anesthesia or the biopsy/catheter insertion prior to 
administration of the agent if grade 2 or lower (grade 3 or higher surgical 
complication from insertion of catheter is considered an unacceptable AE). 
• Seizures: Due to the nature of the disease under investigation in this protocol, 
patients may have preexisting seizures or be susceptible to new seizures as a 
result of the underlying disease process. Although seizures may be defined as 
grade 3 or 4 toxicities under NCI Common Terminology Criteria (CTC), and will 
be reported as such in this protocol, seizures will not be considered an 
unacceptable AE if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871390], they have not increased 
in frequency or can be attributed to another recognized cause of increasing 
seizure frequency such as subtherapeutic anticonvulsant levels or biopsy-proven 
tumor progression. 
• New neurologic deficits: Due to the nature of the disease under investigation in 
this protocol, patients may develop new neurologic deficits as a result of tumor 
invasion or inflammation. A new neurologic deficit or worsening of a known 
neurologic deficit, which resolves (ie, returns to baseline) within 2 weeks after 
initiation of medical therapy ( eg, corticosteroids or bevacizumab at 7.5 mg/kg IV 
every 3 weeks) will not be considered an unacceptable AE. 
• Thromboembolism: Due to the high incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  in 
this patient population, patients may have undiagnosed preexisting DVTs or be 
susceptible to the development of DVTs due to the underlying disease process. 
Although DVT may be defined as a grade 3 or 4 toxicity under NCI CTC, and will 
Pro00077024: PVSRIPO  
Version 8: 07FEB2020  
 
Page 75 of 94 
 be reported as such in this protocol, DVT will not be considered an unacceptable 
AE in this protocol. 
• Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH): Due to the hig h 
incidence of SIADH in this patient population, patients may be susceptible to the 
development of SIADH due to the underlying disease process. Although SIADH 
may be defined as grade 3 toxicity under NCI CTC, and will be reported as such 
in this protocol, SIADH will not be considered an unacceptable AE in this protocol 
unless it is refractory to medical management. 
• Muscle weakness and weight gain: Due to the high incidence of generalized 
muscle weakness (ie, steroid myopathy) and weight gain in patients taking 
steroids in this patient population, patients may be susceptible to the 
development of generalized muscle weakness or weight gain, which is due to 
steroids alone. Although generalized muscle weakness may be defined as grade 
3 or grade 4 toxicity and weight gain ≥ 20% may be defined as grade 3 toxicity 
under NCI CTC, and will be reported as such in this protocol, generalized muscle 
weakness or weight gain will not be considered an unacceptable AE in this 
protocol if the patient has required steroids greater than the physiologic d oses in 
the interval between the immunization and the development of the toxicity. 
• Tumor progression: Due to the nature of the disease under investigation in this 
protocol, patients may have an increase in preexisting neurologic deficits or have 
an onset of new neurologic deficits due to tumor progression. Although such 
neurologic deficits may be defined as unacceptable AEs under NCI CTC, and will 
be reported as such in this protocol, these clinical changes are not an 
unexpected phenomenon in this disease in the setting of tumor growth. As a 
result, neurologic deficits will not be considered an unacceptable AE if 
unequivocal tumor progression can be documented radiographically or 
histologically. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Guidelines for Monitoring Unacceptable Adverse Events 
 
Given that both long- and short-term toxicities are of interest in this study, it is not 
feasible to suspend accrual while toxicity is assessed, as is often done in phase 1 trials. 
If the following criteria are satisfied or there are other reasons for concer n about the 
safety of patient treatment ( eg, treatment-related toxic death; concerns are raised by [CONTACT_34052] [DSMB] or the Sponsor or their designee) , accrual 
will be suspended and data will be carefully reviewed to determine if accrual should  be 
permanently terminated or the protocol modified. These guidelines have n ot been 
adjusted for differential length of follow-up of accrued patients. 
 
Prior to protocol v7, each treatment group will be monitored independently of  the other 
by [CONTACT_4318]. However, if there are reasons for accrual suspension in either arm, 
accrual to both arms will be suspended pending a comprehensive review of patien t 
experiences. 
 
Tabulated below are the conditions under which accrual will be temporarily suspend ed 
and data carefully reviewed to determine the appropriate action, including per manent

Page 76 of 94 
 study termination, continuation with patient accrual after appropriate amendment, o r 
continuation with patient accrual with no modification of the protocol. Accrual will also  be 
suspended whenever a death occurs that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to 
protocol treatment.

toxicity rate is tabulated below based on simulation studies. These statistics were 
generated assuming toxicity outcome was known at the time of accrual and ignored 
issues such as time to toxicity, accrual rate, and length of follow- up.

DSMB for this study may be part of this decision-making in the event that there are  
unacceptable toxicities or inflammatory issues.

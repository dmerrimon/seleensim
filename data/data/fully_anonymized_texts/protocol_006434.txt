Extension Phase will add up to 1500 patients. Accrual Ceiling: 750, in order to enroll 725 to study treatment for the Randomized Controlled Trial.  Extension Phase will accrue up to an additional 1500 patients.  Study Population: Patients with known acute Ebola virus infection having symptoms of any duration  Accrual Period: November 2018 – November 2023 Study Design:  Randomized controlled clinical trial.  While awaiting data analysis an Extension Phase will offer study treatment for new patients.  Study Duration: Start Date: November 2018 End Date: November 2023 (i.e., nominally up to 5 years, but could be shortened or lengthened depending upon the pace of subsequent outbreaks in order to reach desired sample size)  Primary Objective: • To compare the mortality at 28 days in patients with Ebola virus disease who receive different investigational therapeutics relative to the control arm.  Secondary Objectives: • To assess whether the mortality rates in the monoclonal arms support analysis of an antibody-class effect versus a direct-acting antiviral product. • If pooling the monoclonal arms is justified based upon the analysis of heterogeneity outlined above, then compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of antibody-based products as a class with a direct-acting antiviral product in the treatment of Ebola. 
[ADDRESS_265453] Protocol Page 10 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of investigational therapeutics. • To compare the change in viral load between study arms. • To compare mortality rates among patients whose baseline predictors of disease place them in high-risk versus low-risk categories for disease severity. • To compare mortality rates of investigational arms up to 58 days after randomization. • When possible, to evaluate the presence of Ebola viral RNA in the semen of male survivors at ETU discharge or Day 28 (whichever comes first) and Day 58. • To assess the relationship between change in viral load over time with survival. • To compare time to successful discharge from the ETU between participants receiving investigational therapeutics.  • To compare time to death of participants receiving investigational therapeutics  • To collect data on the oSOC available in each participating ETU and, when possible, on the oSOC provided to each participant.  Exploratory Objectives: • To assess comparative ease of both preparation and administration of study agents. • Pharmacokinetic assessments of investigational agents, when possible. • Assessment of viral resistance over time, when possible.  Primary Endpoint: • 28-day mortality.   Inclusion Criteria: • Males or females of any age with documented positive RT-PCR in blood for acute Ebola virus infection within [ADDRESS_265454] symptoms of any duration (see special provision for neonates). • Willingness of study participant to accept randomization to any assigned treatment arm. • All males and females of childbearing potential must be willing to use effective methods of contraception, from time of enrollment until Day 58 of study. • Must agree not to enroll in another study of an investigational agent prior to completion of Day 28 of study. • Ability to provide informed consent personally, or by a legally acceptable representative if the patient is unable to do so. 
[ADDRESS_265455] Protocol Page 11 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 Exclusion Criteria: • Patients who, in the judgment of the investigator, will be unlikely or unable to comply with the requirements of this protocol through Day 28. • Prior treatment with any investigational antiviral drug therapy against Ebola virus infection within 5 half-lives or 30 days, whichever is longer, prior to enrollment. (Patients who have received an experimental (or, in future, potentially a licensed) immunization against Ebola virus remain eligible).   Study Design • A randomized controlled trial with interim monitoring to introduce new arms and allow early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16589], efficacy, or safety. Comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from concurrently randomized participants.  • It is assumed that this study will continue across more than one outbreak and in several countries. To allow for country specific preferences about what constitutes an ethical and scientifically-acceptable control arm, there are two design options at present and as described below. In the event that both options enroll participants, analyses will be stratified by [CONTACT_221136].  o Option 1: Drug A as the control arm (4 arms, Drug A+oSOC vs Drug B+oSOC vs Drug C+oSOC vs Drug D+oSOC)  o Option 2: oSOC as the control arm (5 arms, oSOC vs Drug A+oSOC vs Drug B+oSOC vs Drug C+oSOC vs Drug D+oSOC)        This study will initially enroll participants in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which has chosen Option 1; therefore, the initial plan will randomize (1:1:1:1) enrolled participants to ZMappTM, remdesivir, MAb114, or REGN-EB3 each given with a backbone of oSOC. It is noted that a decision to explore Option 2 in a future outbreak would require a major revision to the current study design and analysis plan that are not described within the current protocol. It is also noted that accrual of data in DRC as well as the availability of other investigational therapeutics may change the number and nature of arms.   • Randomization will be stratified by: [CONTACT_937]-PCR cycle threshold (≤22.0 vs >22.0), ETU site, and outbreak.   
[ADDRESS_265456] Protocol Page 12 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 • An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms. At the end of the outbreak, or if a predefined sample size is reached earlier, analyses will be presented to the DSMB. The DSMB will then recommend whether the results should be released or kept blinded until a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_221102].   • Outbreaks with filovirus species other than Zaire ebolavirus will require reconsideration of design and study arms with agents that have known activity for that species. The monoclonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_221103].   Study agents: Four arms for the DRC outbreak (all arms also receive oSOC): • ZMappTM, three doses of 50 mg/kg of body weight administered intravenously every third day beginning on Day 1. • Remdesivir, administered intravenously with a loading dose on Day 1 (200 mg for adults and pediatric patients with body weight ≥ 40 kg and for pediatric patients weighing < 40 kg one loading dose of remdesivir 5 mg/kg) followed by 9 to 13 days of once-daily maintenance dosing starting on Day 2 and extending through Day 10 to 14 (100 mg for adults and pediatric patients with body weight ≥ 40 kg and for pediatric patients weighing < 40 kg remdesivir 2.5 mg/kg). The recommended remdesivir dosing duration is a total of 10 days, but dosing may be continued at the daily maintenance dosing levels described above for an additional 4 days if Ebola viral load remains detectable in blood at Day 10 of treatment. • MAb114, at 50 mg/kg of body weight administered intravenously on Day 1 as a single infusion. • REGN-EB3 at 150 mg/kg of body weight administered intravenously on Day 1 as a single infusion.  Study Synopsis: • Informed consent for research participation upon admission into the treatment center. • Baseline determination of clinical status according to a standardized case report form (CRF). • Baseline collection of blood for quantitative Ebola viral load by [CONTACT_937]-PCR to be processed by [CONTACT_221137]. • Centralized randomization assignment made. • Provision of assigned study intervention, ideally immediately following randomization whenever possible, according to 
[ADDRESS_265457] Protocol Page 13 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 assigned treatment arm and the individual pharmacologic or logistical requirements of the treatment intervention. • 24- to 48-hour pharmacokinetic measurements of assigned intervention where appropriate and logistically feasible. • Daily assessments of clinical status (including oSOC provided within the capabilities of the site facility) according to standardized CRFs and the study flow sheet. • Serial collection of blood for quantitative viral load determination by [CONTACT_937]-PCR for processing in an appropriate laboratory facility, as possible. • Longer-term follow-up up to Day 58, when feasible, for any late onset clinical history, seminal viral persistence, or symptoms possibly consistent with delayed virologic relapse or drug toxicity.

Between [ADDRESS_265459] been many filovirus outbreaks affecting mostly central Africa, with 2 large outbreaks in 1995 in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and in Gulu, Uganda in 2000-2001. The 2013-[ADDRESS_265460] been developed as putative antiviral strategies for treating this infection. Unfortunately, phase 1/[ADDRESS_265461] ZMapp was studied through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in the 2014-[ADDRESS_265462] to close prior to crossing pre-specified evidentiary boundaries.  A WHO Research and Development Ebola Therapeutics Committee has agreed that, given the lethality of Ebola virus and the combination of human and non-human primate (NHP) efficacy data for ZMapp, either ZMapp+oSOC or oSOC alone could potentially be positioned as the control arm in comparative trials depending upon the preferences of the host countries. The DRC has chosen to use ZMapp + oSOC in the current protocol. However, both the nature and number of control and investigational arms may change over the course of the trial. Such changes would require protocol amendments.  This multicenter, multi-outbreak, randomized controlled trial will study the comparative safety and efficacy of additional investigational therapeutics compared to ZMapp in patients with known EBOV disease (Zaire) receiving oSOC. The primary endpoint of this comparison will be mortality by [CONTACT_2006] 28, with a number of secondary and exploratory endpoints also planned that should generate important knowledge about the safety, ease of administration, and antiviral activity of all of these investigational interventions.    
[ADDRESS_265463] Protocol Page 15 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
 Background 
 Filoviruses Ebolavirus is a large, negative-strand ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus composed of 7 genes encoding viral proteins, including a single glycoprotein (GP) (1-3). Ebolavirus is one of three genera in the Filoviridae family, which along with Marburgvirus, is known to induce viral hemorrhagic fever. Five distinct species, of which [ADDRESS_265464] been implicated as etiologic agents of human Ebolavirus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF), exist: Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Reston virus (RESTV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Taï Forest virus (TAFV), and Zaire virus (EBOV) (4). The BDBV, EBOV, and SUDV species have been associated with large EVD outbreaks in Africa, with reported case fatality rates of up to 90% (5). Between [ADDRESS_265465] been many filovirus outbreaks (Table 1) affecting mostly central Africa, with [ADDRESS_265466] African outbreak (approximately 28,000 cases and over 11,000 deaths) significantly exceeded all previous outbreaks in geographic range, number of patients affected, and in disruption of typi[INVESTIGATOR_221104]. EVD cases in persons who traveled from endemic areas were also reported in Italy, Spain, [LOCATION_002] (US), and [LOCATION_008] ([LOCATION_006]) (6). While the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an end to the EVD public health emergency in March 2016, the risk that small outbreaks will continue to occur remains omnipresent (6). Given the frequency of international travel, EVD also remains a global threat to public health. 
 Transmission and Disease Transmission of Ebolavirus to humans is not yet fully understood, but is likely due to incidental exposure to infected animals (7-9); through direct contact [CONTACT_166922], secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected people (alive or dead); and through indirect contact [CONTACT_221138] (5). It is thought that people are infectious for as long as their blood and secretions contain the virus. Men who have recovered from the disease can potentially still transmit the virus through semen for an extended period of time after recovery from illness (5, 10, 11). EVD has an incubation period of 2 to 21 days (7 days on average, depending on the species) followed by a rapid onset of non-specific symptoms such as fever, extreme fatigue, gastrointestinal complaints, abdominal pain, anorexia, headache, myalgias, and/or arthralgias. These initial symptoms, which last for about 2 to 7 days, are followed by [CONTACT_221139] (e.g., hemorrhagic rash, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], hematuria, hemoptysis, hematemesis, melena, conjunctival hemorrhage, tachypnea, confusion, somnolence, and, in some cases, both internal and external bleeding) and are accompanied with low white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes (5). These symptoms generally last for about 7 to 14 days. Death can occur at a variable time after the onset of symptoms, manifested by [CONTACT_221140], shock, and then multi-organ failure (7, 12). Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to the virus appear 2 to 9 days after infection followed by [CONTACT_12207] G (IgG) antibodies at approximately 17 to 25 days after infection; the latter 
[ADDRESS_265467] Protocol Page 16 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 coinciding with the recovery phase (13). In survivors of EVD, both humoral and cellular immunity are detected; however, their relative contribution to protection is unknown (13, 14). 
 Latest Outbreaks On May 3, 2018, the Provincial Health Division of Equateur Province in the DRC alerted its Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) of cases and community deaths clinically compatible with viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in the western region of that country. On May 8, 2018, an EVD outbreak (the 9th recorded outbreak in the DRC) was declared by [CONTACT_221141]. The epi[INVESTIGATOR_221105], including confirmation of cases reported in Mbandaka, the capi[INVESTIGATOR_221106] a large urban area and center of trade. Overall, a total of [ADDRESS_265468] been cured of their infections over the course of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]. Through a series of coordinated public health interventions overseen by [CONTACT_221142] (including the use of contact [CONTACT_144842], isolation, and safe burial practices), education, and possibly the use of [COMPANY_006]’s experimental rVSV-Ebola vaccine according to a ring vaccination strategy, the outbreak was declared officially ended as of July 24, 2018. Unfortunately, shortly after the outbreak in the western region of the DRC was declared over, on August 1, 2018, the Ministry of Health declared an outbreak of EVD following the confirmation of four cases of Ebola in the Mabalako health zone of the territory of Beni, North Kivu province, Eastern DRC. This is the first-time an Ebola outbreak was reported in this part of the country and constitutes the 10th known outbreak in DRC. As of August 3, 2018, a total of 49 cases had been reported across 7 health zones in two provinces, i.e., five health zones (Beni, Butembo, Oicha, Musienene and Mabalako) in North Kivu province and two health zones (Mandima and Mambasa) in Ituri province.

 Therapy Prior to the West African outbreak in 2013-2016, the standard treatment of EVD had been largely supportive, involving oral or intravenous fluid and electrolyte replenishment and pain reduction where possible. Due to the remote location of the outbreaks and the limited medical and logistical resources available in most of the affected regions, more aggressive treatment options usually had neither been available nor tested in most patients. However, some experimental interventions were explored in prior outbreaks. For example, during the Kikwit outbreak in 1995, 8 patients with EVD were treated with convalescent plasma harvested from EVD survivors; of those 8, 7 patients recovered from their acute illness (15). Overall, in certain centers where advanced treatment measures were able to be employed, a substantial reduction in mortality has sometimes been reported (16).  Wherever possible, the standard treatment for EVD continues to focus on management of symptoms that includes supportive oral or IV fluids, electrolyte replacement, maintaining oxygen status and blood pressure, and pain reduction. Efforts continue to identify, standardize, and deploy the most successful standard-of-care (SOC) measures that potentially could be introduced into previously resource-poor areas. As one example, WHO published Clinical Management of patients with Viral Haemorrhagic Fever; A pocket guide for front-line health workers (February 2016), which provides guidance for standard treatment of viral hemorrhagic diseases (16). 
[ADDRESS_265477] Protocol Page 18 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 Evidence-based guidelines provide support for improved or “optimized” SOC measures (oSOC) to reduce the high mortality rates associated with the disease in the affected regions. In contrast, in the US and other developed nations to which a small number of infected HCWs had been medically evacuated during past outbreaks, aggressive IV fluid resuscitation, hemodynamic monitoring and support, point-of-care (POC) diagnostic modalities, and other aspects of critical care medicine have already been employed in the attempt to save these critically ill individuals. Against this background of oSOC has been the introduction of several different investigational therapeutics as adjunctive therapy, ranging from the administration of convalescent plasma from recovered patients to the use of direct antiviral agents provided under emergency IND as medical countermeasures (MCMs). As of 2015, investigational treatment data were available on a total of [ADDRESS_265478] Africa (17). The reported investigational agents used in these individuals were as follows: • ZMapp or MIL77 • ZMab • TKM-Ebola • Favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654] • Brincidofovir • FX06 • Convalescent plasma • Convalescent whole blood • Amiodarone • Melanocortine  Conclusions about possible benefits or toxicities from these treatments were limited because they were not administered in the context of a study. Furthermore, in many cases these patients received multiple different MCMs either together or over a short period of time, making differentiation of either a beneficial treatment effect or toxicity attributable to any single one of these agents almost impossible to discern. In addition, [ADDRESS_265479] Africa, but without documented infection at the time of transfer, and each received 1 putative MCM each: Tekmira siRNA in one case and the investigational VSVΔG-ZEBOV vaccine in the remaining five (18). It should be emphasized that in almost all of these cases adequate phase [ADDRESS_265480] in humans and/or data to support the safety and efficacy of the product in those with documented Ebola infection were either incomplete or lacking altogether. Also, while the use of these particular agents was facilitated in most cases by [CONTACT_221143], it should be noted that several experimental treatment strategies were previously shown to be successful in in vitro or rodent models, but either failed testing or were not thoroughly tested in the NHP model, which is still considered the most accurate in modeling human disease. In regard to immune-based approaches to therapy, convalescent serum harvested from recovered patients has been one of the most widely used MCMs to date in the West African outbreak and, as noted above, was also used in a limited number of patients during the Kikwit [ADDRESS_265481] Protocol Page 19 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 outbreak. However, its earlier success remains a matter of dispute. Experimentally, passive immunization with horse serum resulted in protection of Hamadryl baboons (19), whereas it only delayed death in Cynomolgus macaques (20, 21). Certain monoclonal antibody treatments have also been successful in rodent models (22, 23) but have failed in preliminary NHP studies (24), indicating possible evasion of antibody neutralization as an escape mechanism of the virus. It is hoped that more recent monoclonal antibody products or cocktails may avoid this limitation. However, it remains fair to say, at least at this time, that a proven therapeutic role of convalescent plasma or monoclonal preparations as treatment adjuncts remains as yet unsubstantiated in this disease, as does the efficacy of direct antiviral agents that also appear promising in NHP studies. 
 RCT of ZMapp (PREVAIL II) As an example of this uncertainty, beginning in March [ADDRESS_265482] ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceuticals) plus SOC versus SOC alone in patients with EVD diagnosed by [CONTACT_937]-PCR assay (25). In this study, named PREVAIL II, eligible patients of any age were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the current oSOC or the current oSOC plus three IV infusions of ZMapp ([ADDRESS_265483] day). Patients were stratified according to their baseline RT-PCR cycle-threshold (CT) values for the virus (≤22 vs. >22) and by [CONTACT_221144]. Oral favipi[INVESTIGATOR_221109]. The primary endpoint was mortality at 28 days. Due to curtailing of the outbreak in that region, a total of only 72 patients could be enrolled at sites in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and the US out of a desired accrual of 100 patients per arm. Of the 71 patients who could be evaluated, 21 died, representing an overall case fatality rate of 30%. Death occurred in 13 of 35 patients (37%) who received the current oSOC alone and in 8 of 36 patients (22%) who received the current SOC plus ZMapp. The observed posterior probability that ZMapp plus the current SOC was superior to the current oSOC alone was 91.2%, falling short of the prespecified threshold of 97.5%. Frequentist analyses yielded similar results (absolute difference in mortality with ZMapp, −15 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, −36 to 7). It was noted that baseline viral load was strongly predictive of both mortality and duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_221110]. The authors concluded that although the estimated effect of ZMapp appeared to be beneficial, the result did not meet the prespecified statistical threshold for efficacy.  
 Rationale for Study The current state of medical science with respect to the treatment of filovirus infections such as Ebola virus disease does not adequately address the role of therapeutic adjuncts beyond supportive care in the successful management of these infections. In some cases, our understanding of the role that these adjunctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_221111] [ADDRESS_265484] Protocol Page 20 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 impetus to identify safe and effective drug treatments as quickly as possible so that case fatality rates associated with EVD can be reduced.  Intrinsic to this rationale for expedited drug discovery in the current Ebola crisis are the following principles, which are by [CONTACT_221145]-inclusive: • A multicenter, multinational randomized controlled study of lead therapeutic candidates is the best strategy for acquiring rigorous data about the safety and efficacy of investigational Ebola virus therapeutics. Single-use emergency IND, Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions (MEURI), or similar mechanisms will not lead to generalizable evidence.  • Randomization is essential to establishing efficacy results. EVD mortality rates vary considerably according to multiple factors, only some of which are known (e.g., CT, age,  ETUs). Randomization is needed to balance these risk factors across treatment arms, and thereby [CONTACT_221146]. • Collecting clinical and virologic data on enrolled patients according to standardized timelines and with a standardized collection instrument should provide valuable information about the clinical course, morbidities, and outcomes in these patients. • oSOC treatment options of fluid resuscitation, electrolyte monitoring and replacement, and other conventional approaches are a mainstay of therapy and must be the backbone to which experimental treatment modalities are added and compared. • Differences in oSOC may occur due to varying site resources and can obscure the potential additional contribution of experimental therapeutics. Therefore, every effort must be made to standardize the oSOC, both within and across treatment centers.  • The number of EVD cases available for enrollment in this trial during the present outbreak is unpredictable and  potentially limited. Therefore, requirements for traditional levels of evidence must be reconsidered. Standards within other areas of rare diseases may provide guidance in this regard (26-28). • Limited, intermittent, or even absent drug supply may exist for some lead candidates proposed for study. Hence, a flexible, adaptive treatment design may be required. • At present, knowledge of the potential toxicity of lead candidates in this patient population may be limited. However, this toxicity risk is considered acceptable in the face of high individual mortality and community risk for continued Ebola virus transmission.  • The use of a flexible platform design is recommended for the following reasons: o Efficiency: This design can accommodate the study of more than [ADDRESS_265485] Protocol Page 21 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 o Availability of study products: Some investigational products may be in limited, intermittent supply. The study design enables continuation of the study even if one product is not available. o A single trial allows a data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) to provide close oversight of safety and early efficacy signals.  2 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
 Primary Objective • To compare the mortality at 28 days in patients with Ebola virus disease who receive different investigational therapeutics relative to the control arm.  
 Secondary Objectives • To assess whether the mortality rates in the monoclonal arms support analysis of an antibody-class effect versus a direct-acting antiviral product. • If pooling the monoclonal arms is justified based upon the analysis of heterogeneity outlined above, then compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of antibody-based products as a class with a direct-acting antiviral product in the treatment of Ebola. • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of investigational therapeutics. • To compare the change in viral load between study arms. • To compare mortality rates among patients whose baseline predictors of disease place them in high-risk versus low-risk categories for disease severity. • To compare mortality rates of investigational arms up to 58 days after randomization. • When possible, to evaluate the presence of Ebola viral RNA in the semen of male survivors at ETU discharge or Day 28 (whichever comes first) and Day 58. • To assess the relationship between change in viral load over time with survival. • To compare time to successful discharge from the ETU between participants receiving investigational therapeutics.  • To compare time to death of participants receiving investigational therapeutics  • To collect data on the oSOC available in each participating ETU and, when possible, on the oSOC provided to each participant. 
 Exploratory Objectives • To assess comparative ease both of preparation and administration of the individual study agents. • Pharmacokinetic assessments of investigational agents, when possible. • Assessment of viral resistance over time, when possible. 3 STUDY DESIGN  
 General Study size:  Up to [ADDRESS_265486] Protocol Page 22 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 Study duration: Nominally up to 5 years, but could be shortened or lengthened depending upon the pace of subsequent outbreaks and other contextual factors (i.e., intended to potentially span across several outbreaks in order to reach desired sample size). Study duration of individual subjects: Initially for 30 days following the primary endpoint (mortality at Day 28), or for a total of 58 days.  [Under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_26338] a separate protocol yet to be developed, interested subjects may also be offered the opportunity, where and whenever feasible, to participate in longer-term follow-up (e.g., up to [ADDRESS_265487] Day 58 depending upon need) of their illness in order to determine whether they are at risk for late onset of any history or symptoms consistent with delayed virologic relapse potentially arising from immunologically-privileged sites (e.g., the central nervous system (CNS) or the male testes).] Sex distribution: Males and females. Age range: Unrestricted. Design: A multi-center, multi-outbreak, randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial of experimental Ebola virus disease therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], each administered with a backbone of oSOC. Figure 1 provides a schema of the study. Interim monitoring is included to introduce new arms or allow early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16589], efficacy, or safety. Guidelines for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_221112] 5 in Section 6.5. This is a superiority design using a 28-day mortality endpoint. For the EBOV outbreak in the DRC, eligible patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive either ZMappTM as the control arm, remdesivir, REGN-EB3, or MAb114. The rationale for the selection of these specific drugs as the lead candidates is described in Section 3.4 below. This design assumes sufficient quantities of each drug will be available to initiate the trial. It also assumes that a sufficient quantity of ZMapp exists to complete the study as planned since ZMapp serves as the comparator or control arm. Should a treatment shortage occur in one of the investigational drug arms being compared to ZMapp, enrollment will continue to the remaining arms. Should a treatment shortage occur in any arm, enrollment will continue to the remaining arms. Comparisons will be limited to data from concurrently enrolled patients. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_221147] ≤22.0 vs >22.0, ETU, and outbreak. The selection of a threshold value of 22.[ADDRESS_265488] African crisis (25).  The study will continue across outbreaks, unless a recommendation to modify or close the study is made by [CONTACT_4318]. It may be amended per DSMB request to drop or replace poorly performing arms including a modification of the control arm. At the end of the outbreak and at predefined enrollment numbers, analyses will be presented to the DSMB to evaluate safety and efficacy of each arm. The DSMB will recommend to the Steering Committee if results should be released or kept blinded until a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_221102].  It is understood that outbreaks with filovirus species other than the Zaire Ebola virus will require reconsideration of study drugs that have known activity for the circulating species. The monoclonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_221113]. Therefore, future outbreaks not due to Zaire ebolavirus or its susceptible variants will require a new study design. If that were to occur, this would result in a separate new 
[ADDRESS_265489] Protocol Page 23 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265490] a common control arm. Study Arms: Four arms (all given with oSOC): • ZMapp, three doses of 50 mg/kg of body weight administered intravenously every third day beginning on Day 1. • Remdesivir, administered intravenously with a loading dose of 200 mg on Day 1 followed by 9 to 13 days (depending on Ebola viral load) of the 100-mg daily maintenance dose (see pediatric weight-based dosing adjustments). • MAb114, at 50 mg/kg of body weight administered intravenously on Day 1 as a single infusion. • REGN-EB3 at 150 mg/kg of body weight administered intravenously on Day [ADDRESS_265491] clearly revealed that there is not necessarily consensus on what standards of care should be considered the minimal standards that all patients should receive, much less how the term “oSOC” treatment should be defined for the purposes of this study as a whole. Accordingly, attempts to legislate across all ETUs what a uniform definition of oSOC must include in order for a given site to qualify for study participation carries the risk of unfairly disenfranchising some sites, and therefore some patients, and therefore should be discouraged. As a general rule, however, an attempt to implement oSOC at study sites should include, but not necessarily be limited to, the provision of appropriate fluid resuscitation, hemodynamic and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], metabolic corrections, and treatment of concurrent infections (e.g. malaria), seizures, and other acute co-morbidities. In the field setting where ETU resources may be severely constrained, for example, a minimum oSOC should usually include regular physician assessments including collection of vital signs, provision of rehydration (by [CONTACT_221148]), serial measurement and correction of electrolytes, provision of empi[INVESTIGATOR_221114], and empi[INVESTIGATOR_221115]. However, it is acknowledged that the physician team in charge of a given ETU has the ultimate latitude to adjust these provisions based upon both ongoing resource considerations and their clinical judgment as to the suitability of a given provision for a specific patient. A deviation from the general oSOC measures described above in this circumstance will not constitute a protocol violation nor make the site ineligible for ongoing participation in the trial.

Note: as stated above, this design assumes that a sufficient quantity of ZMapp will be provided to complete the study since that drug serves as the control arm. If there is insufficient supply of ZMapp for any reason, randomization to other arms will continue. Any instances of lack of supply for any reason will be reported and accounted for in the analyses. 
 Extension Phase Refer to section 14.0 for PALM Extension Phase Plan. 
 Study Endpoints Study endpoints will be evaluated by [CONTACT_221149]. 
 Primary Endpoint • 28-day mortality.  
 Secondary Endpoints • Incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs; see safety section for limitations on collection). • Incidence of infusion-related adverse events (AEs). • Frequency and characterization of clinically significant AEs related to study agent administration.  • Incidence of other AEs as revealed by [CONTACT_144702] (see safety section for limitations on collection). • Mortality at Day 14 and Day 58. • Viremia at Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, and 28. 

[ADDRESS_265493] Protocol Page 25 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 • Ebola viral RNA in semen at ETU discharge or Day 28 (whichever comes first) and Day 58. • Time to discharge from ETU. • Time to death over 58 days. • Time to first negative Ebola virus RT-PCR in blood. • Time to two consecutive negative Ebola virus RT-PCRs in blood.  • oSOC provided to study participants at a site and, when possible, at an individual level • Delayed onset (after 28 days) of any clinical symptoms possibly consistent with virologic relapse or drug toxicity within 58 days after enrollment. 
 Exploratory Endpoints • Comparative ease both of preparation and administration of the individual study agents including supply and storage constraints. • Pharmacokinetic assessments of investigational agents when possible.* • Assessment of viral resistance over time, when possible.  * In general, pharmacokinetic measurements often involve processing (e.g., centrifugation) and testing of blood specimens with techniques or equipment not routinely available or safely performed in most point-of-care laboratory set-ups. These considerations, coupled with limitations on storage, transport, and analytical processing of infectious samples falling under Select Agent regulations, could limit these explorations outside the context of a high-containment laboratory such as a domestic BSL-[ADDRESS_265494] proprietary information concerning the products that is not in the public domain, the detailed descriptions of study agents are provided separately as Appendices to the protocol. For now, these agents include: Appendix A (ZMappTM), Appendix B (remdesivir), Appendix C (MAb114), and Appendix D (REGN-EB3). Each of these appendices contains preclinical, NHP, and human data in support of the choice of these products, information about how they should be administered, and their known side effect profiles.  
 Considerations in Choice of Study Drugs Several factors influencing the choice of study drugs/interventions to be compared in this protocol were considered: • Willingness of both the pharmaceutical sponsors and the regulatory authorities to allow each of these drugs to be studied according to this proposed trial design. • Dedicated supply of agents to be made available for the study over the projected timeline of the trial. • Agreement on ongoing equipoise between study arms: o No available individual therapeutics candidate has yet been proven unequivocally to be superior to oSOC. o No therapeutics candidate has yet been demonstrated to be superior to another,  o No compelling safety/toxicity concern has emerged with respect to individual therapeutics candidates to favor their removal from consideration as study interventions. • Given the consensus view on the value of this RCT and that MEURI access to interventions during the trial could preclude, or circumvent, interest in enrollment of 
[ADDRESS_265495] Protocol Page 26 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265496].  As summarized above, ZMapp, remdesivir, REGN-EB3 and MAb114 are the experimental therapeutics chosen for the implementation of the protocol during the second 2018 outbreak in the DRC. The decision to include these products in the study was based on several factors: 1) a desire to link to the data from the prior RCT of ZMapp during the 2014-16 outbreak to the current study; 2) the desire to study a direct acting agent with a different mechanism of action from monoclonal antibodies both to determine comparative efficacy as well as an important prelude to potential future combination drug trials; 3) the positive in vitro, NHP data, and early phase I safety data for MAb114 coupled with the strong desire of the host country to evaluate an agent for which they played a seminal role in development.  Initially the host country expressed a desire to restrict the study to no more than three arms (and limit the sample size to a total of 336 subjects) due to the complexity and feasibility of administering and accruing a study of this size. Accordingly, the initial version of the protocol that was designed, approved, and deployed was a three-arm design involving 1:1:[ADDRESS_265497] matter experts on Ebola therapeutics and whose purpose was to review all available therapeutic options and ensure that all stakeholders were comfortable that the study design was optimal. On November 9, 2018, the summary document from that consultation was finalized. Among other recommendations was the primary recommendation to add a fourth investigational treatment arm (i.e. REGN-EB3) to the current RCT. The specific rationale given for doing so was summarized as follows: “There was discussion of the trade-offs for including a fourth arm in the current RCT. Adding a fourth arm would spread enrolment across four arms and would increase the time required to accrue a sufficient number of patients in the trial. The trial could address the conceptual question of monoclonal antibody-based therapy vs. small molecule drug treatment without adding a fourth arm. It was also mentioned that each of the investigational products is different, have different dosing regimens and for the purposes of product licensure would be based on the available data for each of the products; a point in support of adding a fourth arm. The RCT will likely run over multiple outbreaks, so including each of the four investigational products (Mab 114, Regeneron, Remdesivir and ZMapp) provides a chance for data to be gathered on each using the current trial (as opposed to a future trial that might start at some point after the current trial has been completed). Also mentioned were the relative differences in the resources required to administer each of the products in the field with some products having single dose regimens. As noted above, taking these trade-offs into consideration, overall the group’s recommendation was to include the Regeneron product as a fourth arm in the current RCT.”  Based upon this recommendation, in late November, 2018, a revised Protocol Development Team was assembled and supported amending the initial three-arm design of the RCT to become a four-arm design involving the addition of REGN-EB3. Randomization will occur on a 1:1:1:1 basis to the four study arms in this amended design, and the study sample size will be increased to 500 patients (in protocol version 3.0). 
[ADDRESS_265498] Protocol Page 27 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0  Every attempt will be made to pre-position the investigational therapeutics under active study at the participating sites’ local or regional pharmacies in advance of anticipated enrollments. Randomization of an individual patient to a given study drug will only occur when there is sufficient quantity of each drug to complete a full treatment course for that individual. 
 Definitions for the Purpose of this Study Enrolled For the purpose of collecting data and samples, and recording and grading of baseline SAEs/AEs, a subject will be considered enrolled beginning from when the informed consent form is signed and randomization to an assigned treatment has occurred, even if the subject expi[INVESTIGATOR_221116], until the subject is considered either “discontinued” or “completed”.  Discontinued Subjects are considered discontinued when they meet the following criterion: • Subject withdraws consent after being dosed and prior to the completion of Day 28 (see also Section 4.5).   Completed Subjects are considered completed for the main study endpoint when they have died or are followed through Study Day 58 (i.e., [ADDRESS_265499] the primary endpoint measured at Day 28) and complete the final study follow-up visit or telephone contact [CONTACT_221150]. If patients cannot be located or contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (i.e., lost to follow-up) between the time of ETU discharge and study Day 58, their completion date will be considered the last known date of contact [CONTACT_221151]. While no plans currently exist to do so, it is possible that a long-term follow-up protocol may be developed to enable that protocol’s study personnel to collect additional information about the longer-term effects of EVD, the potential long-term effects of study drug administration, signs or symptoms possibly consistent with virologic relapse, and other relevant points of their clinical history for up to a year following ETU discharge. Patients will still be considered as having completed the current protocol if: 1) they decline this extended follow-up, or 2) they choose to discontinue extended follow-up prior to reaching 1-year past discharge. [ADDRESS_265500] cases this care would include the ability to provide regular physician assessments, collection and recording of vital signs, and provision of “systematic care” including oral (by [CONTACT_221152]) and/or IV fluids as needed, measurement and correction of electrolytes, use of empi[INVESTIGATOR_221114], and treatment for malaria until confirmatory testing is available. 
[ADDRESS_265501] Protocol Page 28 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 
 Participation of Site Employees Site employees who meet eligibility criteria may participate in this study, with the following conditions: • Neither participation nor refusal to participate in this protocol will have any effect on the subject’s subsequent employment or work situation nor in their accessibility to post-exposure prophylaxis. 
 Inclusion Criteria • Males or females of any age with documented positive RT-PCR for acute Ebola virus infection within [ADDRESS_265502] symptoms of any duration (see special provision for neonates below). • Willingness of study participant to accept randomization to any assigned treatment arm. • All males and females of childbearing potential must be willing to use effective methods of contraception, from time of enrollment until Day 58 of study. • Must agree not to enroll in another study of an investigational agent prior to completion of Day 28 of study. • Ability to provide informed consent personally, or by a legally acceptable representative if the patient is unable to do so. 
 Exclusion Criteria • Patients who, in the judgment of the investigator, will be unlikely or unable to comply with the requirements of this protocol through Day 28. • Prior treatment with any investigational antiviral drug therapy against Ebola virus infection within 5 half-lives or 30 days, whichever is longer, prior to enrollment. (Patients who have received an experimental (or, in future, potentially a licensed) immunization against Ebola virus remain eligible.) 
 Vulnerable Populations 
 Pregnant Women A full understanding of the potential risks from the study medications to human fetuses is lacking at this time. However, given the mortality associated with Ebola virus infection and the likelihood that there is a greater risk to the fetus from severe EVD than from the study medications themselves, pregnant women will be permitted entry into the study. However, there may still be certain antiviral medications (e.g., favipi[INVESTIGATOR_42654]) with known teratogenic potential that pregnant women should generally not receive, and these considerations must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis with study investigators.  The risks from the study medications to nursing infants are also unknown at this time. As women infected with Ebola will be quarantined in the ETU, breastfeeding will not be allowed. For women who are pregnant, every attempt will be made to track the pregnancy outcome through delivery in order to determine the outcome of the study intervention on the fetus. In many cases this may not be possible due to the challenges associated with tracking patients’ long term under difficult field conditions although every effort will be made to do so. 
[ADDRESS_265503] Protocol Page 29 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265504] only been tested in limited fashion, or not at all, in children. Again, however, children of any age,will be eligible for enrollment given the likelihood that untreated Ebola infection may pose greater risk than exposure to the study medications. A neonate (defined as ≤ 7 days old) born to a mother who is RT-PCR positive for acute Ebola virus represents a special case. These neonates are presumed to be RT-PCR positive for acute Ebola virus at delivery, with untreated infection posing a greater risk than exposure to study medication. As such, neonates born to an infected mother who has not yet cleared the Ebola virus are eligible for enrollment even prior to RT-PCR confirmation (i.e. obtaining whose results could pose unnecessary delay). Neonates born to a mother who has cleared Ebola virus following a course of her assigned investigational medication may be enrolled prior to RT-PCR confirmation according to the discretion of the investigator regarding the likelihood that the neonate is infected (e.g., based on the interval between when the mother clears the virus and the baby [CONTACT_50835]). Regardless of when a neonate is enrolled, baseline blood for RT-PCR will be collected before study drug initiation. 
 Adults Who Are Unable to Provide Initial or Ongoing Consent Adults who are unable to consent are eligible for enrollment in this protocol because of the high fatality rate with Ebola virus disease and the lack of other proven treatment options and the potential benefit provided by [CONTACT_15365]. Similarly, enrolled participants who lose the ability to provide ongoing consent during study participation may continue in the study. Capacity to provide initial and/or ongoing consent will be evaluated by [CONTACT_221153](s). Adults whose ability to consent is uncertain will be evaluated for the ability to consent according to local procedures. We will obtain assent for persons who are judged to have mental capacity above that of a 7-year-old. We will obtain permission for decisionally impaired adults via their appointed surrogate decision maker or another legally acceptable representative (such as a legal guardian). Local procedures will be followed for appointing a surrogate decision maker for adult participants who (a) are decisionally impaired, and (b) do not have a legal guardian. The risks of participation for adults unable to consent should be identical to those described for less vulnerable patients. The benefits for adults unable to consent are also the same because they will undergo the same procedures as participants who are able to provide consent. 
 Subject Withdrawal Subjects can terminate full or partial study participation at any time without prejudice. If a subject terminates participation before completing the study, the reason for this decision will be recorded in the study record. Persons voluntarily withdrawing may elect to allow continued collection of outcome information. Subjects will continue clinical care per the local/site standard. Best efforts will be made to follow withdrawn subjects who have received study interventions for safety.  
 Discontinuation of Subject by [CONTACT_221154]. Subjects may discontinue study treatment if, in his/her best judgment, the investigator believes that continuation in the study would be detrimental to the subject and therefore that discontinuation of the study drug would be in the participant’s best interests. In general, subjects withdrawn for AEs will still be 
[ADDRESS_265505] Protocol Page 30 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265506]. If an SAE is unresolved at the time of discontinuation, efforts should be made to follow up until the event resolves or stabilizes. Subjects will continue clinical care per the local/site standard. 
 Discontinuation of Study The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Democratic Republic of Congo Ministry of Health, future countries who may join the study and their Ministries of Health, each institution’s Institutional Review Board (IRB), the Protocol Steering Committee, or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may request to terminate this study at any time upon notification of the other stakeholders. Reasons for terminating the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: • The incidence or severity of an SAE in this or other studies indicates a potential health hazard to subjects. • Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory. • Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete to the degree that objective evidence essential for determining the primary endpoint cannot be ascertained. • Investigators do not adhere to the protocol or applicable regulatory guidelines in conducting the study.

 Schedule of Evaluations (see also Table 2 below) The day when the subject is enrolled and randomized to their assigned treatment arm is denoted as Study Day 1. The first day after randomization is Study Day 2. Subsequent days will be numbered chronologically through Day 58 of study. For each investigational agent being evaluated a unique schedule of assessments will be developed. The schedule of assessments will be harmonized across comparisons to provide the longitudinal data collection. Patients who agree to extended follow-up through Day 58 to help characterize potential late-onset symptoms, evidence of possible virologic relapse, or other clinical changes will either be seen in person or contact[CONTACT_221155]. If necessary, and with the patient’s verbal consent at the time they agree to this extended follow-up at time of ETU discharge, available medical staff and/or records at nearby [CONTACT_221156]-onset events. Performance of this extended follow-up will always remain subject to the patients’ wishes as well as the logistics and feasibility of being able to contact [CONTACT_221157].

Ebola RT-PCR from blood with quantitative CT should be performed on Study Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, and 28. As above, inability to obtain this testing on a given day due to clinical or other extenuating circumstances will not constitute a protocol deviation. e.

Each consent will be witnessed, and the witness will also sign the informed consent. Each consent will include the date signed. A separate participant consent is required for a neonate born to a female study participant in order to enroll the neonate. The informed consent process will occur on or before Day 1. 
 Demographics The following information should be recorded from the participant or surrogate: • Age • Sex • Ethnicity  • Race • Country of birth • Contact [CONTACT_221158]’s family 
 Medical History The following information should be recorded: • Focused medical history regarding EVD, including all prior RT-PCR results if known • Current symptoms  • Current participation in any recent research protocols 
 Clinical Data  • Vital signs (temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure) with oxygen saturation as possible  • Weight (actual or estimated) 
 Determination of Eligibility Once the screening evaluation is complete, eligibility will be determined based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects that are found to be ineligible will be informed during the screening evaluation, and the reason for ineligibility will be discussed.  
 Day 1 
 Baseline Evaluation Within 24 hours prior to randomization, a baseline clinical evaluation will be performed with documentation of current targeted symptoms (below) and significant comorbid/pre-existing clinical conditions including vital signs. The list of targeted symptoms and signs to assess includes: fever, cough, mental state change, hearing loss, vision loss, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, hiccups, rash, edema, conjunctival injection, convulsions, and hemorrhage. 
[ADDRESS_265515] Protocol Page 35 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 
 Baseline Laboratory Testing When possible, the following tests will be performed and recorded as baseline determinations. Baseline laboratory testing shall be performed within 24 hours of study entry (randomization).  [IP_ADDRESS] Minimum Baseline Requirements: • Creatinine • Potassium • Sodium • AST/ALT • Malaria test • Ebola virus RT-PCR with CT from blood sample o Although any positive Ebola virus RT-PCR from blood collected up to 3 days prior to informed consent provides eligibility, a baseline specimen should be collected on Day 1 if the prior specimen was collected >[ADDRESS_265516] substantially changed. Baseline blood for RT-PCR will be collected for all neonates before study drug initiation, but results are not needed for eligibility as described in Section 4.4.2. o If a patient is a recent [COMPANY_006] rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (within 5 days prior to RT-PCR testing) then it is possible that a positive RT-PCR test for GP only could be due to GP expression from the VSV viremia that results from vaccination rather than to true Ebola infection. In such cases a secondary confirmatory test using a different Ebola gene target (e.g., NP gene) will be needed in order to document acute Ebola infection.  [IP_ADDRESS] Optimal Baseline Laboratories • CBC with differential • Acute/hepatic/mineral chemistry panels as available via POC testing, defined as: o Metabolic Panel = Na, K, Cl, HCO3, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, Ca, Mg o Hepatic Panel = AST/SGOT, ALT/SGPT, Alkaline phosphatase, t-Bilirubin o Lactate o Albumin o ionized Calcium • Ebola RT-PCR with CT and/or quantitative copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL from blood • PT/aPTT/INR • D-Dimer (and/or fibrinogen if available) • Urinalysis, dipstick • Serum or urine pregnancy test (females of childbearing potential only) if available as POC • Specimen storage if possible • CK-MB 
[ADDRESS_265517] Protocol Page 36 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 
 Randomization A randomization scheme will be generated by [CONTACT_221159]. Randomization occurs on Day 1 with the site communicating with the regional operations center for the randomization. Randomization will only occur when a given individual has met all of the eligibility criteria as outlined above, including determination of their baseline PCR results necessary for stratification (see exception for neonates above). 
 Study Drug Administration and Pharmacokinetic Sampling It is possible that Study Day 1 may be consumed by [CONTACT_221160] a patient’s overall clinical status, implementation of oSOC provisions, assessment for study eligibility, study randomization, and other exigencies. Therefore, while not preferable, it is possible that actual administration of the investigational study intervention (as part of the assigned treatment arm) might need to be deferred until Study Day 2. Refer to the Pharmacy SOP for specific administration details of each product. 
 Pharmacokinetic Sampling Although not feasible in most settings, for those interventions where additional PK sampling may be of value and where sample processing can be performed safely and serial samples stored appropriately according to Select Agent regulations, as locally possible:  • Collection of baseline drug level prior to assigned treatment intervention • Initiation of serial PK blood draws whose frequency and duration (24-48 hours) will be guided by [CONTACT_221161]. 
 Follow-Up Study Days The plan for study drug administration, clinical assessments, and lab monitoring are outlined in the Schedule of Evaluations. Details on assessments are as follows:  
 Follow-up Daily Assessment and oSOC This will include documentation of: • Current symptoms or conditions, including identification of any new or worsening (S)AEs compared to baseline or last prior status, focusing on: o targeted symptoms (above list) o organ dysfunction, failure, or possible drug toxicity o known or suspected study agent toxicities  • Vital signs  • oSOC received • Study agent administration, as applicable • Laboratory (as performed) • Urinalysis (as performed, optional) • Imaging and fluid resuscitation (as performed, optional) • Discharge/Outcome information, as appropriate

 Clinical Safety Laboratory Testing [IP_ADDRESS] Minimum Requirements The required minimum safety laboratory testing is as follows. For the frequency of this required testing, refer to the Schedule of Evaluations in Section 5.3. While every effort should be made to obtain these laboratories per the above schedule, note that the frequency and volume of blood draws is always subject to the clinical judgment of the site investigator as to safety and logistical considerations. Hence any inability to obtain the minimal laboratory assessments on a given day due to clinical or other extenuating circumstances will not constitute a protocol deviation. • Creatinine • Potassium • Sodium • AST/ALT • Ebola virus RT-PCR with CT from blood • Malaria test [IP_ADDRESS] Optimal Daily Laboratory Monitoring Refer to Schedule of Evaluations (Table 2) in Section 5.3. Testing should be performed during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_221117]: • CBC with differential • Chemistry panels as available via POC testing • Ebola virus RT-PCR with CT from blood o After two negative Ebola virus RT-PCRs in blood, at least [ADDRESS_265519] RT-PCR negative result in blood • PT/aPTT/INR • D-Dimer (and/or fibrinogen if available) • Urinalysis, dipstick • Specimen Storage • CK-MB  
 Special Follow-up Assessments 
 Day of Discharge Additional information will be obtained on the day of discharge regarding the criteria for discharge and negative Ebola virus RT-PCR testing prior to discharge.

 Pregnancy As noted previously, whenever possible efforts will be made to follow any pregnant women enrolled into this study through delivery or end of pregnancy, for the express purpose of evaluating any reproductive impacts of study participation. 
 Extended Follow-Up Under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_26338] a separate protocol yet to be developed and approved, survivors of EVD enrolled in this study may be contact[CONTACT_221162] a special case report form dedicated to eliciting a history of signs or symptoms potentially consistent with late onset of a virologic relapse, possibly with a particular focus on ocular or neurologic symptoms (i.e., that may represent re-emergence of virus from a CNS source). 6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Design overview This is a randomized platform trial of candidate Ebola therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], as described above. Brief background about the two options is described here. Figure 1 provides a study schema of the design.   As discussed above, results about ZMapp from PREVAIL II were promising, but not definitive at the traditional levels of evidence. Mortality rates were 37% and 22% (2-tailed p=0.18) for the oSOC and ZMapp arms respectively (25). NHP models showed a survival benefit (29). These results, in combination with concerns about the high mortality rate from EVD, have led many to conclude that ZMapp must be provided as a control treatment, at least until additional data is accrued. This was the reasoning for the DRC decision to select Option [ADDRESS_265522] control of the two-tailed type 1 error rate at level 0.05, with adjustments for multiple comparisons of arms. This necessitates larger sample sizes to ensure high power. The current circumstances of high mortality, intermittent outbreaks, and the need to find effective treatments as quickly as possible argue for less austere statistical penalties.  As a result, the current trial will  use  Boschloo’s exact two-tailed tests at alpha=0.[ADDRESS_265523] Protocol Page 39 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265524] allowed even higher one-tailed type 1 error rates such as 0.10 (26, 27). The need for multiple comparison adjustment has always been somewhat controversial. The products in this trial are made by [CONTACT_221163], so one could view the comparisons almost like separate trials. The argument that no multiple comparison adjustment would be made in separate trials becomes even more compelling considering the special circumstances described above for this Ebola setting. 
 Study hypotheses and statistical analysis Primary hypothesis The primary hypothesis is that the 28-day mortality rate of the investigational arms will be lower than that of the control arm. Boschloo’s test will be used to evaluate the primary hypothesis. For comparison of a given arm to control, two-tailed tests will be used. Note that an exact procedure was chosen in anticipation of early looks with limited numbers. Boschloo’s test was chosen over Fisher’s exact test due to less conservative small-sample performance.  Secondary hypotheses Heterogeneity of mortality probabilities among antibody arms will be assessed using a global chi-squared test and separate pairwise chi-squared tests.  The antibody arms will be deemed combinable if the two-tailed p-values from the global and pairwise tests all exceed 0.10.  If the antibody arms are deemed combinable using the criteria described above, mortality in the combined antibody arm will be compared to that of the DAA arm using Boschloo’s test, as described in the primary analysis.    Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_221164] (SAE) for each arm relative to the control arm, using Boschloo’s test. Proportions of specific SAEs, to include infusion-related events, will be reported.  Viremia hypothesis: Differences in median days to viral clearance will be tested using a rank-based test, imputing deaths prior to day [ADDRESS_265525] ranks, with earlier deaths having a worse rank than later deaths.   Propensity score analyses: Because some patients may be too sick to be saved by [CONTACT_221165], principal stratification will be used to evaluate whether treatment effect differs by [CONTACT_221166]. This risk (or propensity) of death will be evaluated using baseline predictors (e.g., CT, symptoms, age). Treatment effects will be evaluated stratifying participants according to low- and high-risk. Full details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan.  Differences in mortality by [CONTACT_4475] 14 and day 58 between relevant comparator arms will be tested with Boschloo’s test in the manner described for the primary hypothesis.  Time-to-death: A log-rank test comparing time-to-death up to day 28 (and up to day 58) will be performed.   
[ADDRESS_265526] Protocol Page 40 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 Time-to-discharge: Differences in median days to becoming eligible for discharge will be tested using a rank-based test, imputing deaths prior to day [ADDRESS_265527] rank, with earlier deaths having a worse rank than later deaths. Note that discharge decisions may not always be based on objective clinical data. For example, during PREVAIL II, some patients were not discharged if a caseload was low and a relative was still under current treatment at the ETU. For these reasons, time to meeting criteria for discharge will be analyzed rather than time to actual discharge.   Proportions of patients with delayed onset of clinical symptoms possibly consistent with virologic relapse or drug toxicity within 58 days of enrollment will be summarized with descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals.  Ease of preparation and administration of investigational products will be summarized according to mean preparation and infusion times for each arm, with 95% confidence intervals. 
 Power and sample size The sample size will be 725 participants in total, with approximately 170 enrolled in the REGN-EB3 arm and 185 enrolled in each of the ZMapp, MAb114 and remdesivir arms.  This target is updated in this protocol (version 4.0) to increase power for smaller effect sizes as outlined in Table 4.  Comparisons will be made between each experimental arm and the ZMapp+oSOC control,using a two-sided type I error rate of 0.05. The initial mortality rate of 30% was based, in part, on a meta-analysis of eight clinical studies conducted during the 2014-[ADDRESS_265528] the mortality rate with ZMapp may be higher than the point estimate from PREVAIL II, which was 22%.

 Interim monitoring  Interim efficacy monitoring: Interim monitoring  will use symmetric upper and lower boundaries for comparisons of a given arm to the control.  The O’Brien-Fleming alpha-spending procedure will truncate boundaries at a one-sided type I error rate of 0.001. Four interim looks (including the final analysis) are planned, roughly corresponding to endpoint data from 33, 65, 100 and full enrollment (170 REGN-EB3 and 185 in each of the other 3 arms). The upper boundaries for the z-scores at these looks are 3.09, 3.09, 3.09, and 1.98. The timing of analyses might change depending on the size of the outbreak. A separate DSMB guidance document will be developed to address such issues as adding new therapeutics, changing the control group, droppi[INVESTIGATOR_221118], and sample size adjustments.

A rough guideline for futility is a conditional power of under 20%, computed under the original assumption of a 50% relative reduction in mortality. Details about these calculations and the resulting boundaries will be provided in a statistical analysis plan and a DSMB guidance document. These calculations and boundaries are advisory, and the DSMB will consider them along with the totality of evidence when making recommendations.  Final Analysis Plan: A data analysis plan developed and approved by [CONTACT_221167]. [ADDRESS_265536] cases. Animal and/or early/first in human clinical trials are ongoing, and changes to the risk/benefit profile for study interventions are anticipated during the course of this study. Known toxicity profiles of the included agents are summarized in the appendices. Safety profiles, risks, and other information relevant to participants decision to continue or to enroll in the study will be updated and provided under guidance of human subject protection oversight bodies and per regulatory bodies, requirements and guidance. The study may itself generate information that is relevant to human subjects, which will be provided under appropriate guidance standards and entities. Relevant 
[ADDRESS_265537] Protocol Page 45 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265538] been outlined in the informed consent/assent documents. 
 Risks of Phlebotomy The primary risks of phlebotomy include local discomfort, occasional bleeding or bruising of the skin at the site of needle puncture, hematoma and, rarely, infection or fainting. Because ongoing clinical care of participants may require frequent blood draws independent of actual study-related assessments, it will be important that study teams ensure that research blood draws do not exceed the guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_1356]’s safety regulations.  
 Risks to the Study Personnel and the Environment The principal risk for study personnel is exposure in the clinical setting to infectious pathogens from study subjects through various contact [CONTACT_221168] (e.g., needlestick or mucous membrane exposure to blood borne pathogens or infected bodily fluids). Adherence to mandatory hygiene practices and infection control practices, including consistent and appropriate use of PPE, for working with patients infected with Ebola is of absolutely paramount importance throughout the conduct of this trial. Any perceived break in those practices must be reported immediately to the appropriate supervisory authorities in each institution per established algorithms. 
 Potential Benefits There is no definite expectation of benefit to participants or to society at large. However, the agents planned for investigation in this study are all thought to have some potential to offer benefits to individual subjects, based upon previous pre-clinical and, in some cases, clinical investigation. Hence, while the potential benefits, if any, of a given medical intervention are presently unknown, it is possible that one or more interventions may subsequently be shown to offer evidence of a greater reduction in morbidity and mortality than that usually provided by [CONTACT_221169]. This may be manifested by a reduction in the length or the severity of disease, which may be life-saving in some cases given the nature of Ebola infection. If this is so, it is quite possible that this evidence will be suggestive, but not definitive, at this early stage of testing. However, even if no experimental treatment intervention is shown conclusively to provide this benefit, the knowledge gained from their study will provide important information that should help better inform what role such interventions should or should not play as adjunctive treatments in managing this disease. Thus, it is possible that both positive and negative results will help inform rapi[INVESTIGATOR_221119], and thus may offer a societal benefit.  
 Alternatives The alternative to participating in this protocol is not to participate and to receive access either to supportive care measures alone or to experimental therapi[INVESTIGATOR_221120] a non-participating ETU. 8 RESEARCH USE OF STORED HUMAN SAMPLES, SPECIMENS, AND DATA 
 Intended Use of the Samples/Specimens/Data Samples and data collected under this protocol may be used to determine the interventional agent safety and efficacy, anti-viral effects, development of anti-drug antibodies, effects on immune 
[ADDRESS_265539] Protocol Page 46 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265540] include: diagnostics and viral pathogenesis. 
 Storage of Samples/Specimens/Data  It is understood that blood, other bodily fluids, and tissue samples from this protocol will potentially be of great value in advancing our knowledge both of EVD pathogenesis and the treatment effects of investigational countermeasures. The first priority for samples collected in this study is to complete analyses outlined in this protocol. Accordingly, when possible, serial samples from the enrolled patients that may help address these important questions in Ebola research will be collected and stored. As part of this, reliable long-term storage in facilities capable of storing such samples safely and under appropriate storage conditions (e.g. having secure access, monitored freezer units, connection to a reliable electrical grid, etc.) will be arranged. Samples obtained in this study must adhere to national regulations for long term storage. Any export of samples outside of DRC will necessitate approval from the Ministry of Health of DRC.   For any potential U.S. sites for sample storage, CDC regulations govern the storage of blood obtained from patients infected with Select Agents in other than BSL-4 containment facilities, which specifically require documentation of destruction of potentially infectious samples after more than 7 days’ time according to established CDC guidelines. Whenever possible, sites which have access to a secure BSL-[ADDRESS_265541] agents. In the future, other non-protocol investigators (both locally in the affected countries, at NIH, and at other research centers) may wish to study these samples and/or data. In that case, IRB/ERB approval must be sought prior to any sharing of samples and/or data. Any clinical information shared about the sample with or without patient identifiers would similarly require prior IRB/ERB approval. The research use of stored, unlinked or unidentified samples from any US site may be exempt from the need for prospective IRB review and approval. Exemption requests will be submitted in writing to the NIH Office of Human Subjects Research, which is authorized to determine whether a research activity is exempt. 
 Reporting Loss or Destruction of Samples/Specimens/Data  Any loss or unanticipated destruction of locally maintained samples (for example, due to freezer malfunction) or data (for example, misplacing a printout of data with identifiers) that meets the definition of a protocol deviation, unanticipated problem, and/or compromises the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study, will be reported to the institution’s IRB or recognized ERB and to the protocol team. [ADDRESS_265542] Protocol Page 47 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 partial compensation for time and transportation costs associated with extended follow-up assessments. 10 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY Regulatory requirements, including FDA regulations and ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, set forth safety monitoring and reporting responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators to ensure the safety and protection of human subjects participating in clinical trials.  
 Definitions  Adverse Event (AE): An AE is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the research.  Adverse Reaction: An AE that is caused by [CONTACT_4523] (drug or biologic).  Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR): An AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational agent caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. An SAR implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than AR, which implies a high degree of certainty.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE): An SAE is an AE that results in one or more of the following outcomes: • death • a life-threatening event (places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred) • an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] • a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions • a congenital anomaly/birth defect or fetal loss/miscarriage • a medically important event* *Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_221121].  Unexpected Adverse Event: An AE is unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator’s brochure or package insert (for marketed products) or is not listed at the frequency, specificity or severity that has been observed. It is the responsibility of the IND sponsor to make this determination.  Serious and Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R): A S[LOCATION_003]R is an SAR that is both serious and unexpected.  Unanticipated Problem (UP): A UP is any event, incident, experience, or outcome that is 
[ADDRESS_265543] Protocol Page 48 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 1. unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to a. the research risks that are described in the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document, Investigator’s Brochure, or other study documents; and b. the characteristics of the participant population being studied; and 2. possibly, probably, or definitely related to participation in the research; and 3. places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. (Per the IND sponsor, an AE with a serious outcome will be considered increased risk.) Unanticipated Problem that is not an Adverse Event (UPnonAE): A UP that does not fit the definition of an AE, but which may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], involve risk to the participant or others, or significantly impact the integrity of research data. For example, we will report occurrences of breaches of confidentiality, overdose, accidental destruction of study records, or unaccounted-for study drug.  Protocol Deviation: A protocol deviation is defined as any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB approved study procedures in a research protocol. Protocol deviations are designated as serious or non-serious and further characterized as 1. Those that occur because a member of the research team deviates from the protocol. 2. Those that are identified before they occur, but cannot be prevented. 3. Those that are discovered after they occur  Serious Protocol Deviation: A deviation that meets the definition of an SAE or compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or others.  Non-compliance: The failure to comply with applicable NIH HRPP policies, IRB or ERB requirements, or national and international regulatory requirements for the protection of human subjects. Non-compliance is further characterized as 1. Serious: Non-compliance that a. Increases risks, or causes harm, to participants b. Decreases potential benefits to participants c. Compromises the integrity of the NIH-HRPP d. Invalidates the study data 2. Continuing: Non-compliance that is recurring 3. Minor: Non-compliance that, is neither serious nor continuing. 
 Assessment of Safety The primary purpose of safety data collection in a putative therapeutic study is to permit monitoring for the safety of those enrolled, and to gather data on study interventions to inform use and to protect other current and potential future users of the study-agents.   The study population will generally be in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_221122]. Signs and symptoms of Adverse Events are likely to progress through grade levels, and may achieve seriousness criteria in minutes to hours in many cases. This may occur prior to any study specific/investigational treatment. The highly infectious nature of the disease and characteristics of treatment facilities and the need to protect 
[ADDRESS_265544] Protocol Page 49 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 health care providers will each add layers of unavoidable challenge to the assessment and care process and to study activities.   The above factors will limit, within reason, and for good cause, the nature and timing of data collected and reported for safety.   Every attempt will be made to document the nature [name/type] and the severity [grade per DAIDS toxicity table version 2.1, July 2017] of conditions present at baseline, particularly as pertains to the status of Ebola infection and vital organ function, so that meaningful data can be collected on the safety and efficacy impact of study interventions. It is acknowledged at the outset that this effort will likely be incomplete, and there may be unavoidable inconsistencies over time and from place to place, due to harsh conditions at treatment/study sites. Nonetheless the study team is committed to working with the sponsor safety office and with all stakeholders to obtain the most complete and accurate dataset possible. Safety event assessment, recording, reporting, and cumulative evaluation will be aimed at achieving optimal safety for those enrolled in the study, and in pursuit of study objectives. Every attempt will be made to promptly identify relevant toxicity patterns that may require changes to the design or the conduct of the study, and to inform the use of these study interventions elsewhere.  The Data Coordinating Center will grade the severity of laboratory values and other events according to the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events Version 2.1, July 2017 (https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/daidsgradingcorrectedv21.pdf). The “Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)” version 5.0 (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm) will be used to grade drug infusion reactions. 
 Investigator Assessment of Serious Adverse Events The Investigator will evaluate all SAEs with respect to Seriousness and Causality (relationship to study agent and relationship to research) as defined below. 
 Causality  Causality assessment is based on available information at the time of the assessment of the event. The investigator may revise the causality assessment as additional information becomes available. The likelihood that the SAE is related to the study agent will be assessed by [CONTACT_221170]. Due to the severity of Ebola illness and limitations of an ETU, further detailed breakdown will not occur:  Reasonable Possibility  • reasonable temporal relationship • little evidence for a more likely alternative etiology  No Reasonable Possibility  • does not have a reasonable temporal relationship  OR • reasonable evidence for a more likely alternative etiology 
[ADDRESS_265545] Protocol Page 50 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 
 Timing and Scope of (S)AE Collection, and of Assessments and of Reporting Responsibilities to the Sponsor   SAE/AE data collection/recording, assessment/grading, reporting, and cumulative evaluation will be conducted/limited as follows:  o At BASELINE, and as close to dosing as is feasible, there will be collection, recording, and grading of targeted symptoms and of significant baseline conditions prior to study agent administration. o BEGINNING AT INITIAL STUDY DOSING, AND DAILY, THROUGHOUT INPATIENT STAY there will be collection and recording (based upon both open-ended questioning and targeted solicitation) of targeted symptoms (see list), and of significant baseline conditions. During this period, ONLY the following SAEs are graded and are required to be individually reported to the Clinical Safety Office:  § New/worsening events considered unlikely or definitely unrelated to underlying Ebola infection, and/or  § New/worsening events considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to study interventions or to a non-Ebola condition, including any baseline comorbidity that has worsened. NOTE: ALL SAEs that are reportable per the above two bulleted criteria are to be reported to the Clinical Safety Office as follows, by [CONTACT_221171]: § Deaths and Immediately Life Threatening SAEs:   • By [CONTACT_221172]. § All other SAEs: • By [CONTACT_221173]. o All other S/AEs (those not subject to the above criteria) that are recorded for the study will be included in a MONTHLY cumulative ‘line listing’ and summary report across all subjects, in a format to be agreed upon by [CONTACT_221174], to enable regulatorily compliant safety monitoring of the overall study. o The study Principal Investigator, subject to review and confirmation by [CONTACT_37755], will recommend an initial determination of expectedness for all SAEs. 
 Unanticipated Problems An Unanticipated Problem is any event, incident, experience, or outcome that is 1. unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to a. the research risks that are described in the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents; b. the characteristics of the subject population being studied (persons with life threatening Ebola infection); and 2. possibly, probably, or definitely related to participation in the research; and 3. places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
[ADDRESS_265546] Protocol Page 51 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265547] be reported to the Data Coordinating Center and local IRB/ERB as per local institutional requirements. Unanticipated problems may include problems with protocol implementation, participant safety, and/or concerns regarding informed consent. Initial reports must be communicated no later than 7 calendar days of site awareness of the event. Report all Unanticipated Problems that are also SAEs on the SAE CRF. 
 Pregnancy  Pregnancy itself is not an AE. However, complications of pregnancies are AEs and may be SAEs. Any complications that are SAEs will be reported on the SAE CRF within the above timelines.  If obtainable, pregnancy outcome data (e.g., delivery outcome, spontaneous or elective termination of the pregnancy) will be recorded on a protocol-specified form. Pregnant participants should be advised to notify their obstetrical care provider of study agent exposure, if applicable. In the event that the obstetrical care provider requires additional information on the pregnant participant, they will be referred to the study team for consultation. 
 Reporting Procedures to the IRB  As a general statement, SAEs, serious and non-serious UPs, and deaths will be reported per the institutional requirements of each participating entity.  Unanticipated problems, non-compliance, and other reportable events will be reported to the NIAID IRB according to Policy 801. 
 Annual Reporting to the IRB • A high level summary of the following events will be reported to the NIAID IRB per NIH Policy 801at the time of continuing review:  a. Major and minor deviations b. Noncompliance reported to the IRB that is not related to a protocol deviation c. Adverse events and serious adverse events (that do not meet the definition of a UP). Address if the expected frequency and severity of the events occurred as expected, or occurred in a manner that affected the safety assessment (i.e., rose to the level of a UP). d. UPs reported to the IRB • The following items will be reported to all other applicable IRB/ERBs in summary at the time of continuing review: a. Serious and non-serious UPs.  b. SAEs that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to the research. c. SAEs that are not related to the research. d. All collected AEs, except expected AEs granted a waiver of reporting (e.g. the large number of AEs expected to be due to the underlying disease and judged not attributable to study drug).  e. Serious and non-serious protocol deviations. Anticipated deviations in the conduct of the protocol will not be reported to the IRB unless they occur at a rate greater than anticipated by [CONTACT_3476]. f. Serious, continuing, and minor non-compliance. 
[ADDRESS_265548] Protocol Page 52 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265549] not resolved by [CONTACT_221175]-up period will be followed until final outcome is known. Pregnancy will be followed up as well as to outcome if feasible and if consent has been provided for such. If it is not possible to obtain a final outcome for an SAE (e.g., the subject is lost to follow-up), the reason a final outcome could not be obtained will be recorded by [CONTACT_221176] (if the CRF is still open) and the SERF.  
 Sponsor’s Reporting Responsibilities Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) as defined in ICH E6 5.[ADDRESS_265550] if indicated for unanticipated problems or SAEs. In addition, the Investigators are responsible for: • Protecting the safety and welfare of subjects • Evaluating subject safety • Notifying the sponsor of SAEs and immediately-reportable events • Informing the IRB/IEC of SAEs, as per institutional requirements 
 Sponsor Medical Monitor (SMM) A Medical Monitor, representing the IND Sponsor, may be appointed for oversight of safety in this clinical study.  
 Safety Review and Communications Plan A safety review and communications plan (SRCP) has been developed for the protocol. The SRCP is an internal communications document between the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_221123], which delineates the safety oversight responsibilities of the Principal Investigator, the Clinical Safety Office, and other stakeholders. The SRCP also includes the overall plan for conducting periodic safety surveillance assessments. 
 Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) An independent DSMB with international representation of the host countries participating in the trial will review the study no less frequently than twice a year. The DSMB may convene additional reviews as necessary, dependent on the rate of subject accrual. The DSMB will review 
[ADDRESS_265551] Protocol Page 53 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265552] of the study. All SAEs, all unanticipated problems, and all IND Safety Reports will be reported by [CONTACT_221177]. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_221124]’s written summary open reports with the DSMB’s recommendations to the IRB. A specific DSMB charter will be put in place establishing the roles and responsibilities of members after review and approval by [CONTACT_121158]. • The DSMB will monitor safety, efficacy, and quality of trial conduct measures closely throughout the trial and may pause enrollment in the event of unanticipated study-related deaths or SAEs that are considered study-related.  • The DSMB will also review the completeness of follow-up and other aspects of study conduct.  • After each meeting they will recommend that the study be continued as planned, modified, or terminated. 11 CLINICAL MONITORING STRUCTURE 
 Site Monitoring Plan  As per ICH-GCP 5.18 and FDA 21 CFR 312.50, clinical protocols are required to be adequately monitored by [CONTACT_4530]. This study monitoring will be conducted according to the “NIAID Intramural Clinical Monitoring Guidelines.” If feasible, monitors under contract to the NIAID/Office of Clinical Research Policy and Regulatory Operations (OCRPRO) or their designee may visit the clinical research site to monitor aspects of the study in accordance with the appropriate regulations and the approved protocol. The objectives of a monitoring visit would be: 1) to verify the existence of signed informed consent documents and documentation of the Informed Consent Form process for each monitored subject; 2) to verify the prompt and accurate recording of all monitored data points, and prompt reporting of all SAEs; 3) to compare data abstracts with individual subjects’ records and source documents (subjects’ charts, laboratory analyses and test results, medical progress notes, nurses’ notes, and any other relevant original subject information); and 4) to help ensure investigators are in compliance with the protocol. The monitors also may inspect the clinical site regulatory files to ensure that regulatory requirements (Office for Human Research Protections [OHRP]), FDA, and applicable guidelines (ICH-GCP) are being followed. During the monitoring visits, the investigator (and/or designee) and other study personnel should be available to discuss the study progress and monitoring visit. 12 ETHICS/PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 Informed Consent Process Informed consent is a process where information is presented to enable persons to voluntarily decide whether or not to participate as a research subject. It is an on-going conversation (in a language understood by [CONTACT_423]) between the human research subject and the researchers about the essential information about the study, which begins before consent is given and continues until the end of the subject's involvement in the research. Discussions of essential information about the research will include the study's purpose, duration, experimental procedures, alternatives, risks, and benefits, and subjects will have the opportunity to ask questions and have them answered. 
[ADDRESS_265553] Protocol Page 54 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 Participants over 18 years of age will sign the informed consent document (in a language understood by [CONTACT_423]) prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study. The signature [CONTACT_4007] a legally acceptable representative of the potential subject will be obtained for adults who are impaired and unable to provide informed consent. In the case of adults whose ability to consent is uncertain, capacity to consent will be evaluated by [CONTACT_221153](s). Parental/guardian permission and minor assent for children through [ADDRESS_265554]’s medical record. The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by [CONTACT_34693]. Due to the biohazard of Ebola virus contaminated documents, special safety provisions must be made for how source documents are collected and stored. For example, it may be necessary for a photograph or scanned image of the informed consent signature [CONTACT_221196] “electronic source document” rather than retaining a paper version. CRFs may also be used as source documents under these conditions. 
 Subject Confidentiality All records will be kept confidential to the extent provided by [CONTACT_1032], state and local laws in the jurisdictions in which the study is conducted. The study monitors and other authorized representatives of the Sponsor may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_737], including but not limited to, medical records. Records will be kept locked and all computer entry and networking programs will be done with coded numbers only. Clinical information will not be released without written permission of the subject, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_1744], the FDA, the NIAID, the OHRP, the INRB, or the sponsor’s designee. 13 DATA MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING 
 Data Management Responsibilities The site investigator is responsible for assuring that the data collected is complete, accurate, and recorded in a timely manner. Source documentation (the point of initial recording of information) should support the data transferred to the electronic data system and, when possible, should be signed and dated by [CONTACT_1024]/or reviewing the data. All data should be reviewed by [CONTACT_221178]-signed as required. 
 Data Capture Methods Study data collected at the bedside at study sites will later be recorded as paper or electronic CRFs with subsequent transmission to the Data Coordinating Center. Data Coordinating Center personnel shall enter data into an electronic database. Corrections to electronic data systems will be tracked electronically (password protected and through an audit trail) with time, date, individual making the correction, and what was changed. 
[ADDRESS_265555] Protocol Page 55 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265556]’s medical records, laboratory reports, ECG tracings, x-rays, radiologist’s reports, subject’s diaries, biopsy reports, ultrasound photographs, progress notes, pharmacy records, and any other similar reports or records of procedures performed during the subject’s participation in the study. 
 Source Documents and Access to Source Data/Documents Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities, and all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical trial.  Due to the biohazard of Ebola virus contamination, any original written source documents created at the bedside (i.e. in the ‘hot zone’) must be treated as potentially infectious unless an effective means of decontamination can be instituted. Where possible, photographs, digital scans, or other electronic data capture methods may be obtained instead. 
 Record Retention The protocol team is responsible for retaining all essential documents listed in the ICH Good Clinical Practice Guideline. All essential documentation for all study subjects is to be maintained by [CONTACT_83196] a secure storage facility for a minimum of 3 years per NIAID policies or per in-country local or federal regulatory requirements (whichever is longer). The FDA requires study records to be retained for up to 2 years after marketing approval or disapproval (21 CFR 312.62), or until at least [ADDRESS_265557] elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational agent for a specific indication. These records are also to be maintained in compliance with IRB/EC, state, and federal medical records retention requirements, whichever is longest. All stored records are to be kept confidential to the extent required by [CONTACT_1032], state, and local laws in the jurisdiction in which they are stored. 
 Data Sharing Plan At the completion of the trial, a comprehensive study report will be prepared by [CONTACT_221179], the FDA, study partners, and all other applicable regulatory and health agencies within the affected countries. The relevant primary and secondary outcome data from this trial will also be entered into ClinicalTrials.gov for access by [CONTACT_29091]. In addition, it is the intention of the extended protocol team that de-identified data from this trial will be made available upon request to outside investigators upon scientific review of the merits of their proposed research plan. This availability will be in accordance with the WHO Joint statement on public disclosure of results from clinical trials. To facilitate this, a Presentations and Publications subcommittee (which will include full representation of the DRC and any additional countries who may join the study as well as representation from the extended protocol team) will be created to receive, review for scientific merit, and, if appropriate, approve these requests for use of de-identified data arising from the trial. 
 Trial Organization To be outlined according to the governance model in development.   
[ADDRESS_265558] Protocol Page 56 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265559] BOTH been met: • study outcomes have been released and  • a new revised treatment plan for future management of EVD, if needed, has been designed, approved, and implemented by [CONTACT_221180]. It is expected that this revised plan will be formulated and communicated very quickly once the RCT outcomes are known.  Depending upon those outcomes, for example,  • a revised prioritization of the existing study drugs may be needed • combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_221125] • other treatment strategies may be adopted  During this Extension Phase, the existing stratification and randomization algorithm to determine treatment assignments (i.e. using hard-copy envelopes distributed to sites) of the present RCT will continue to be followed; HOWEVER two possible exceptions may apply: • not all drugs may be available at all times, in sufficient quantity, to support this, or • the DSMB, which will continue to monitor the PALM Extension,  may recommend that one of the two arms be stopped.   There is a strong rationale for continuing to enroll and randomize new EVD patients during this Extension Phase: 
[ADDRESS_265560] Protocol Page 57 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 • The support that the RCT has been providing to the overall outbreak response, and to the ETUs in particular, has been viewed as critical to their ongoing operations and should be continued if possible. • It will be less disruptive for sites to continue the current enrollment process in which they have already been trained rather than switch back to a compassionate release (MEURI) drug allocation process. • Continued oversight of the trial by [CONTACT_221181]. • Equipoise on the part of site investigators for the two study drugs will continue based on similar results during the interim analysis. • The Extension Phase will tend to make optimal use of the existing RCT infrastructure (data collection, data management, pharmacy support, etc.) already in place at the ETUs • Continuing the RCT enrollment process will facilitate more rapid transition to a new RCT if a decision to launch a new investigational study (e.g. a combination drug study) is undertaken based upon the RCT results. • The additional data collected about the study drugs during the Extension Phase will continue to contribute significant additional information to the overall efficacy and safety profiles of these agents that are still in early development, even if the data cannot be combined statistically with those data generated under the formal RCT for the primary endpoint.  Inasmuch as the data collected under the Extension Phase cannot contribute directly to the primary endpoint of the RCT, a streamlined set of data elements will be collected during this phase that represents a pared-down version of those elements collected during the formal RCT. This reduced dataset will minimize the burden to the sites to continue to enroll and randomize patients during this period, and will also require only a minimum of additional staff training at the site level. While every effort will be made to determine the study outcomes as quickly as possible, the exact duration of the Extension Phase will depend upon the timing of such factors as when data on the Day 28 visits are collected, when the study team can be unblinded to perform primary outcome analyses, when the study results are ready for dissemination, and when a follow-up plan for overall future management of EVD is developed, approved, and implemented within the DRC (and potentially other affected countries). It is anticipated that the results of the RCT may greatly influence that follow-up plan, although the scope of that influence cannot be predicted at this time while the study results remain blinded.    Similarly, the number of additional patients to be enrolled during the Extension Phase cannot be predicted with accuracy both because of the uncertain number of patients who may present to the four participating ETUs during this period as well as the unknown (but presumably brief) interval of time it may take to formulate and enact a new “open access” treatment plan once the RCT results are known and decisions have been made about the most appropriate treatments to be offered to future patients. For example, over the course of a 12-week period and at the current rate of new cases being identified, it is possible that between 100 and 200 new patients could present themselves to an ETU for admission and possible enrollment during this extension period. With this uncertainty in mind, there will be a generous ceiling of an additional 1500 patients imposed upon the enrollment during this phase as long as: 
[ADDRESS_265561] Protocol Page 58 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 • adequate investigational drug supply, as defined in this protocol, exists to support provision of treatment under this mechanism, and • ETU resources remain adequate to conduct the Extension Phase, and  • no recommendation to otherwise amend or halt the extension is made by [CONTACT_4318], the IRBs, or other regulatory bodies.  As outlined above, a reduced data collection plan will be implemented during the Extension Phase. The case report forms that will still be completed (as applicable) and collected are: • Screening • Eligibility • Randomization Request • Randomization Assignment • Study Drug Infusion (modified) • Discharge (with Ebola RT-PCR) • A Revised Day 28/End of Study Composite Form • Death • SAEs • Pregnancy  Accordingly, the following CRFs will not be collected: • Vital signs  • Daily follow-up (daily chemistries may still be performed but those results will be recorded in source documents only) • Day 58 • Optional Procedures • Semen Collection  Other than the exceptions noted above, study conduct will proceed as described in prior sections of this protocol (e.g. safety oversight and reporting).

What you should know about this study:   • You are being asked to join a research study because you have Ebola. This consent form explains the research study and your part in the study. • Read this consent form carefully or have someone you trust read it to you. Take as much time as you need to understand the study. • Ask the study team to explain any words or information that you do not understand. • You are a volunteer and you do not have to join this study. You should talk to your doctor about what your options are if you do not want to be in this study.  • If you join the study, you can change your mind later. You can decide not to take part or you can quit at any time. There will be no penalty or loss of benefits if you decide not to join or to quit the study. Your care within your community will not be affected.  • During the study, we will tell you if we learn any new information that might affect whether you wish to continue to be in the study. • If you are signing for a person who cannot consent for themselves, such as a child or a person who is too sick to read and understand this, the word “you” in this consent form refers to that person. If you are signing for a baby [CONTACT_221188] 7 days to a mother who has Ebola, we will assume that the baby [CONTACT_221189]. In this case, we may not wait for the baby’s Ebola blood test result to confirm an Ebola infection before starting them on this study.  
[ADDRESS_265581] Protocol Page 71 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 2. What is this study about? We are looking for new treatments for Ebola virus disease. Ebola virus can make people very sick and some people can die from it. There are no approved medicines for Ebola. There are some possible Ebola medicines that are called experimental medicines because we are not sure if they work to treat Ebola. We need to test the experimental medicines to see if they help people recover from Ebola virus disease. To do this, we need the help of people who have Ebola and are in a treatment center where we can test these experimental drugs and compare them to each other in a controlled way. The experimental drugs that we are testing in this study (the “study drugs”) are described below.  3. How many people will be in this study? We expect about 725 people to join the study in several Ebola treatment centers.  4. What will happen if you join this study? Before you can join the study, we will ask you some questions, review your health history, assess your symptoms, and collect some of your blood to test for Ebola.   If you are eligible and choose to join, you will be in the study for about [ADDRESS_265582] Protocol Page 72 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265583] survived Ebola.    5. What are the study drugs and their side effects? Each person in this study will get 1 of the 4 study drugs described below. All study participants will also get routine medical care for Ebola. If you join the study, the study drug you get will be randomly assigned (that is, like throwing dice). Right now, nobody is sure if any of the study drugs are better than the others. There may be some side effects with the study drugs.   The study team will tell you which study drug you will get, and will talk with you about it. You will only receive 1 of the study drugs while you are in this study. You will not be able to receive any other experimental drugs for 1 month.  Study Drugs  The 4 different study drugs we are using on this study are called  • ZMapp • remdesivir • MAb114 • REGN-EB3  Information about how these drugs are given and their risks is given below. These experimental drugs have not been studied in very many people, so there may be risks that we do not know about. It is possible for people to have allergic reactions to any drug, including hives, trouble breathing, or other allergic responses. This is very rare. Severe allergic reactions (called anaphylaxis) can cause heart attacks and, if untreated, even death. The study doctors will be prepared to promptly and appropriately treat any severe allergic reaction to any of the study drugs.   ZMapp: If you get ZMapp, we will give it to you [ADDRESS_265584] severe side effects that do not get better, we will not give you any more doses.  ZMapp has been tested in other studies in people with Ebola. Some of the side effects seen in people who received ZMapp were flushing (skin redness), fast heart rate, chills, a rise or fall in blood pressure, itchiness, swelling, fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, a drop in blood sugar, seizures, and skin rash. These side effects may be caused by [CONTACT_221190]. We do not know if the drug caused all of these side effects. Some of them may have been caused by [CONTACT_221191]. Some people have lived and some people have died after receiving ZMapp.   
[ADDRESS_265585] Protocol Page 73 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 Risks of antihistamine and acetaminophen: If you have some kinds of side effects from ZMapp, we may give you antihistamine or acetaminophen to help treat it. Sedation is the major expected side effect of antihistamine and may last up to several hours after the antihistamine is given. Other common side effects of antihistamine include tiredness, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], dizziness, disturbed coordination, drying and thickening of oral and other respi[INVESTIGATOR_171919], and stomach upset. An antihistamine may also cause blurred vision, double vision, tremor, loss of appetite, or nausea.  Significant side effects from a single dose of acetaminophen are uncommon but could include allergic-type reactions (for example, hives, rash, shortness of breath), minor stomach upset, and jaundice.  Remdesivir: If you get remdesivir, we will give it to you through your IV line [ADDRESS_265586]. When remdesivir was tested in animals, some of the animals had kidney damage. The animals’ kidneys went back to normal after the drug was stopped. Some of the animals also had redness around the spot of the drug infusion. We have not seen any kidney problems in the people who have taken this drug but since it is still being studied, it could still happen. We will be monitoring your blood during the study to check for kidney damage.  Remdesivir has an ingredient called SBECD. When SBECD was given to animals in research studies, it caused changes in the kidneys but did not affect how well the kidneys worked. SBECD has been approved for use in the [LOCATION_002] and is used to give other approved medications.  You should not drink alcohol for 14 days after you start receiving remdesivir. You should also not take paracetamol (acetaminophen).  MAb114: If you get MAb114, we will give you only [ADDRESS_265587] Protocol Page 74 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265588] discomfort, and shortness of breath.  Some drugs like MAb114 contain larger amounts of an ingredient called sucrose. This may cause temporary damage to the kidneys. MAb114 contains less sucrose than those other drugs, but we will still monitor your kidneys closely with blood tests during this study.  Some drugs like MAb114 attack human proteins and can increase the risk of serious infections. MAb114 is not expected to increase the risk of serious infections because it attacks the Ebola virus and not a human protein.  REGN-EB3: If you get REGN-EB3, we will give you only [ADDRESS_265589] Protocol Page 75 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265590] an allergy to doxycycline or any other medications.  6. What are the other risks or discomforts of the study? The needle used to draw blood or place an IV line can hurt. You may get a black and blue mark where the needle went in. Sometimes drawing blood causes people to feel lightheaded or even to faint. There is a very small risk of getting an infection where the needle went into the vein.   We will be careful to keep your study information confidential, but there is a small risk that someone not involved in the study could get this information.  7. What do I need to know about pregnancy or breastfeeding during the study? Women: We do not know the effects of the study drugs on a developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103]. If you can become pregnant, we may do pregnancy testing while you are on this study. If you are pregnant or become pregnant around the time you receive the study drug, there may be risks to you, the embryo, or fetus. These risks are not yet known. If you are a woman who can get pregnant, you must agree to use an effective method of birth control from the beginning of the study through the last study visit. If you find out that you were pregnant during the study, you must tell your doctor immediately. If you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed an infant, it is recommended by [CONTACT_221192] a period of time until your breast milk is tested to show that Ebola virus is not present. We also do not know if the study drugs can pass through in breast milk, and the risks to a nursing infant are not yet known.  Men: The effects of the study drugs on sperm is not known. To protect against possible side effects, you should not get a sexual partner pregnant while taking part in this study. You must agree to use a condom from the beginning of the study through the last study visit. Research studies have found that Ebola virus can persist in the semen of Ebola survivors for extended periods after recovery from an Ebola infection, and might infect a sexual partner. Therefore, we recommend that you either don’t have sex or that you use condoms during sexual intercourse for as long is currently recommended by [CONTACT_38375], or until your semen is tested to show that Ebola virus is not present.  We would like to test your semen for virus in this study when you leave the ETU and again about [ADDRESS_265591] Protocol Page 76 of 92 IND#: 125530          CONFIDENTIAL 4 October 2019, version 7.0 If you recover from Ebola, we will talk with you about precautions you should continue to take to prevent passing the virus to others through bodily fluids.  8. Are there benefits to being in the study? We do not know if you will benefit from being in this study. It is possible that the study drug you receive will help treat your Ebola infection. But we do not yet know whether any of the treatments are effective. It is also possible that even if a drug is effective, it may cause serious side effects that make it more harmful than helpful.  What we learn from this study may allow us to better understand Ebola and develop better ways of treating patients with Ebola in the future.  9. What will happen to your samples and personal information? We will store your samples and data (information) for a very long time to use for future research on Ebola. Your stored samples and data will be marked with a code and not with your name. Only researchers linked to this study can get the codes.  Your study information will be placed in a secure electronic system. It will not include your name. We must get approval from the DRC and US ethics boards that review this study before we share samples and data with other researchers. Other information, such as your sex, age, or health history might also be shared, but your name [CONTACT_221198]. This information cannot be traced back to you. You will not get any information about future research. Your sample will not be sold. You will not be paid for any products that result from this research.  The only risk of allowing us to store your sample would be an accidental release of your identity.  If you change your mind and decide you do not want us to store your sample or data, please let us know. We will do our best to follow your wishes but cannot promise that we will always be able to destroy your samples or data.  10. Will it cost you anything to be in this study? It will not cost you anything to be in this study.  11. Will you be paid if you join this study? No, you will not be paid.  12. Who is watching over this study? A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be looking at the study information very closely. The DSMB is made up of doctors and other people who are not directly involved in the study and who have a good understanding of Ebola and research studies. The DSMB may recommend changing the study drugs being used or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_221131] a drug is working better. The DRC and US ethics boards will also be watching over this study and have the authority to stop it at any time.

Davey, Jr., MD (US)   Site:  Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Central Africa   [ADDRESS_265595] to be in this study if you do not want to.  2 What is this study about? This is a research study where we are testing possible medicines. We want to find out if any of these medicines could help treat Ebola. We call these medicines the “study drugs.” We do not know if any of them will be helpful. They have been given to some people before, but not many. We need to test them in more people, including kids, so we can make sure they are safe and see if any of them can help treat Ebola.  [ADDRESS_265596] to be in this study? No. You can decide not to be in the study. You can talk to your family, friends, and doctor before you decide. Even if you want to be in the study now, you can change your mind later and stop being in the study at any time.  4 What will happen in this research study? If it is okay with you and you agree to join this study, we will give you [ADDRESS_265597] Protocol Page 80 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265598] you 2 more times to ask how you are feeling. If possible, we will give you a check up and take some more blood for tests. Then you will be done with the study. Your total time in the study will be about 2 months.  5 Will any part of the study hurt? Taking a study drug may make you feel sick, but you may also feel sick from the Ebola. The study drugs have not been given to a lot of people, so the study drug you get may cause changes that hurt or bother you that we do not know about. It may also not have been given to children before, so we may not know whether it may cause side effects in kids that were not seen in adults. In a very small number of people, the study drugs could cause something dangerous that people could die from. It is important that you always tell the study staff how you are feeling.  If you get the study drug called “ZMapp,” you will get it [ADDRESS_265599]. You might get seizures.  If you get the drug called “remdesivir,” you will get it [ADDRESS_265600] trouble poopi[INVESTIGATOR_48908] a while.  If you get the drug called “MAb114,” you will get it [ADDRESS_265601].  If you get the drug called “REGN-EB3,” you will get it [ADDRESS_265602] Protocol Page 81 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265603] on their own. There is a very small chance that you could get an infection.   6 What do I need to know about pregnancy during the study? If you are female: We do not know the effects of the study drugs in pregnancy or in a nursing baby. If you can become pregnant, we may do pregnancy testing while you are on this study. If you are pregnant or get pregnant around the time you get the study drug, we don’t know if there may be effects on you or your baby. Therefore, you should avoid getting pregnant for [ADDRESS_265604], and find medical care for your pregnancy.  If you are male: The effects of the study drugs on sperm are not known. Therefore, you should not get a sexual partner pregnant for at least [ADDRESS_265605] sex for 2 months after getting the study drug.  7 Will the study help me? We do not know if you will be helped by [CONTACT_55825]. We do not know if the study drug will make you feel better or get well sooner. It is possible that the study drug could make you worse.  8 Will the study help others? We might find out things from this study that will help other people with Ebola someday.  [ADDRESS_265606] other choices? You do not have to be in this study. It is up to you. You can talk to your parents and your doctor about your options.   No one will be upset if you don’t want to do this study. If you say okay now, but you want to stop later, that is okay too. If you decide to stop being in the study, all you have to do is tell your doctor or nurse that you don’t want to do the study anymore. No one will be mad at you if you change your mind.  If you say no, you will still be given your regular care for Ebola. We will not give you the study drugs.

Davey, Jr., MD (US)   Site:  Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Central Africa    1. What you should know about this study:   • You are being asked to join a research study because you have Ebola. This consent form explains the research study and your part in the study. • Read this consent form carefully or have someone you trust read it to you. Take as much time as you need to understand the study. • Ask the study team to explain any words or information that you do not understand. • You are a volunteer and you do not have to join this study. You should talk to your doctor about what your options are if you do not want to be in this study.  • If you join the study, you can change your mind later. You can decide not to take part or you can quit at any time. There will be no penalty or loss of benefits if you decide not to join or to quit the study. Your care within your community will not be affected.  • During the study, we will tell you if we learn any new information that might affect whether you wish to continue to be in the study. • If you are signing for a person who cannot consent for themselves, such as a child or a person who is too sick to read and understand this, the word “you” in this consent form refers to that person. If you are signing for a baby [CONTACT_221188] 7 days to a mother who has Ebola, we will assume that the baby [CONTACT_221189]. In this case, we may not wait for the baby’s Ebola blood test result to confirm an Ebola infection before starting them on this study.  2. What is this study about? We are looking for new treatments for Ebola virus disease. Ebola virus can make people very sick and some people can die from it. There are no approved medicines for Ebola. 
[ADDRESS_265610] Protocol Page 84 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265611] steps to make that information public.   The purpose of the current study is to offer you access to these experimental medicines.  3. How many people will be in this study? We have set a limit of [ADDRESS_265612] it may take a few weeks to a few months for those results to become available.    4. What will happen if you join this study? Before you can join the study, we will ask you some questions, review your health history, assess your symptoms, and collect some of your blood to test for Ebola.   If you are eligible and choose to join, you will be in the study for about [ADDRESS_265613] Protocol Page 85 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265614] survived Ebola.    5. What are the study drugs and their side effects? Each person in this study will get 1 of the 2 study drugs described below. However, it is possible that both drugs will not be available at all times. All study participants will also get routine medical care for Ebola. If you join the study, the study drug you get will be randomly assigned (that is, like throwing dice). If we run out of one of the study drugs, you will be randomly assigned to the study drug that is available.  Right now, nobody is sure if one of the study drugs is better than the other. There may be some side effects with the study drugs.   The study team will tell you which study drug you will get, and will talk with you about it. You will only receive 1 of the study drugs while you are in this study. You will not be able to receive any other experimental medicines for 1 month.  Study Drugs  The 2 different study drugs we are using on this study are called  • mAb114 • REGN-EB3  Information about how these drugs are given and their risks is given below. As of now these experimental medicines have only been studied in a few hundred people each, so there may be risks that we do not know about. It is possible for people to have allergic reactions to any drug, including hives, trouble breathing, or other allergic responses. This is very rare. Severe allergic reactions (called anaphylaxis) can cause heart attacks and, possibly, death. The study doctors will be prepared to promptly treat any severe allergic reaction to any of the study drugs.   If you have side effects while we are giving the study drug, let us know. We can slow down how fast we give you the drug to help with the side effects.  mAb114: If you get mAb114, we will give you only [ADDRESS_265615] Protocol Page 86 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265616] discomfort, and shortness of breath.  Some drugs like mAb114 contain larger amounts of an ingredient called sucrose. This may cause temporary damage to the kidneys. mAb114 contains less sucrose than those other drugs, but we will still monitor your kidneys closely with blood tests during this study.  Some drugs like mAb114 attack human proteins and can increase the risk of serious infections. mAb114 is not expected to increase the risk of serious infections because it attacks the Ebola virus and not a human protein.  REGN-EB3: If you get REGN-EB3, we will give you only [ADDRESS_265617] Protocol Page 87 of 92 IND#: [ADDRESS_265618] an allergy to doxycycline or any other medications.  6. What are the other risks or discomforts of the study? The needle used to draw blood or place an IV line can hurt. You may get a black and blue mark where the needle went in. Sometimes drawing blood causes people to feel lightheaded or even to faint. There is a very small risk of getting an infection where the needle went into the vein.   We will be careful to keep your study information confidential, but there is a small risk that someone not involved in the study could get this information.  7. What do I need to know about pregnancy or breastfeeding during the study? Women: We do not know the effects of the study drugs on a developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103]. If you can become pregnant, we may do pregnancy testing while you are on this study. If you are pregnant or become pregnant around the time you receive the study drug, there may be risks to you, the embryo, or fetus. These risks are not yet known. If you are a woman who can get pregnant, you must agree to use an effective method of birth control from the beginning of the study through the last study visit.

If you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed an infant, it is recommended by [CONTACT_221192] a period of time until your breast milk is tested to show that Ebola virus is not present. We also do not know if the study drugs can pass through in breast milk, and the risks to a nursing infant are not yet known.  Men: The effects of the study drugs on sperm is not known. To protect against possible side effects, you should not get a sexual partner pregnant while taking part in this study. You must agree to use a condom from the beginning of the study through the last study visit.

Therefore, we recommend that you either don’t have sex or that you use condoms during sexual intercourse for as long is currently recommended by [CONTACT_38375], or until your semen is tested to show that Ebola virus is not present.   If you recover from Ebola, we will talk with you about precautions you should continue to take to prevent passing the virus to others through bodily fluids.  8. Are there benefits to being in the study? We do not know if you will benefit from being in this study. It is possible that the study drug you receive will help treat your Ebola infection. But we do not yet know which study drug is more effective. It is also possible that even if a drug is effective, it may cause serious side effects that make it more harmful than helpful.

If possible, we will give you a check up and take some more blood for tests. Then you will be done with the study. Your total time in the study will be about 1 month.  5 Will any part of the study hurt? Taking a study drug may make you feel sick, but you may also feel sick from the Ebola. The study drugs have not been given to a lot of people, so the study drug you get may cause changes that hurt or bother you that we do not know about. It may also not have been given to many children before, so we may not know whether it may cause side effects in kids that were not seen in adults. In a very small number of people, the study drugs could cause something dangerous that people could die from. It is important that you always tell the study staff how you are feeling.  If you get the drug called “mAb114,” you will get it [ADDRESS_265627].  If you get the drug called “REGN-EB3,” you will get it [ADDRESS_265628] Protocol Page 93 of 94 IND#: [ADDRESS_265629] on their own. There is a very small chance that you could get an infection.   6 What do I need to know about pregnancy during the study? If you are female: We do not know the effects of the study drugs in pregnancy or in a nursing baby. If you can become pregnant, we may do pregnancy testing while you are on this study. If you are pregnant or get pregnant around the time you get the study drug, we don’t know if there may be effects on you or your baby. Therefore, you should avoid getting pregnant for [ADDRESS_265630], and find medical care for your pregnancy.  If you are male: The effects of the study drugs on sperm are not known. Therefore, you should not get a sexual partner pregnant for at least [ADDRESS_265631] sex for 2 months after getting the study drug.  7 Will the study help me? We do not know if you will be helped by [CONTACT_55825]. We do not know which study drug will make you feel better or get well sooner. It is possible that the study drug could make you worse.  8 Will the study help others? We might find out things from this study that will help other people with Ebola someday.  [ADDRESS_265632] other choices? You do not have to be in this study. It is up to you. You can talk to your parents and your doctor about your options.   No one will be upset if you don’t want to do this study. If you say okay now, but you want to stop later, that is okay too. If you decide to stop being in the study, all you have to do is tell your doctor or nurse that you don’t want to do the study anymore. No one will be mad at you if you change your mind.  If you say no, you will still be given your regular care for Ebola. We will not give you the study drugs.  [ADDRESS_265633] questions?

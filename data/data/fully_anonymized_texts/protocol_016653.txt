Study Protocol  
 
Inclusion criteria  
Participants are eligible for inclusion in the study if they: are between ages [ADDRESS_511259] in 
the clinic, and had no cognitive impairments. This minimize s confounding factors in treatment response 
and evaluation of acne (e.g., erythema from oth er skin conditions).  22 adolescents were identified as 
eligible and, with their parents, consented to participate in the study during the 11/20/2020 through 
09/20/2021 study period. No changes to eligibility were made during the study period.   
 
Randomizati on and Blinding  
Once consent  is obtained , eligible sample adolescents are randomized in a non -blinded, parallel fashion 
and in equal allocation to take either 20 mg or 100 mg doxycycline BID for 12 weeks. Additionally, the 
same over the counter regimen of Adapalene 0.1% gel and Benzoyl Peroxide 2 -5% wash was prescribed.  
 
Patients are randomized by [CONTACT_43435] a folded pi[INVESTIGATOR_405633] a bag that determined their dose. No 
blinding to treatment arms occurred to mimic a real world where patients are informed o f their dose. This 
allowed for the determination of patient -perceived effectiveness despi[INVESTIGATOR_405634] a 
lower dose.  
 
Materials and methods  
Participants are emailed a brief Qualtrics survey18 link on the day of enrollment and every two wee ks 
thereafter to self -report their doxycycline dose and perceived facial acne severity using the validated 
Patient -Centered Acne Severity Scale19 containing a [ADDRESS_511260] three survey responses will 
be included in the analysis. After 12 weeks of treatment, p articipants complete a follow -up appointment at 
three months for clinical evaluation.  
 
All participants are to be  screened, enrolled, and treated through the Messenger Dermatology Clinic. 
Treatment is initiated at the same visit as enrollment and data collection en ds at the thre e-month 
appointment. Patients pi[INVESTIGATOR_405635]; the clinic and 
study personnel d o not dispense the medication themselves. The Qualtrics software is programmed with a 
de-identified study identification number and message encryption.  
 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
Data analysis w ill be  performed with S.P.S.S. Version [ADDRESS_511261]. For all analytic procedures, a two -tailed coefficient α < 0.05  will be  
observed to indicate statistical significance.  
 
  
 
Research Participant Information and Consent Form  
 
You are being asked to participate in a research study and your parent is being asked to 
provide parental permission. Researchers are required to provide an assent 
form/parental permission form to inform both of you about the research study, to convey 
that participation is voluntary, to explain risks and benefits of participation, and to 
empower you to make an informed decision. You should feel free to ask the researchers 
any questions you may have.   Both of you need to agree for the child’s participation in 
this study.

1.  PURPOSE OF RESEARCH                                        
 
● You/your child are being asked to participate in a research study of whether a lower 
dose of the antibiotic doxycycline is still effective in treating acne.  
● You/your child have been selected as a possible participant in this study because we 
would normally treat this type of acne with doxycycline.  
● From this study, the researchers hope to learn whether  this lower dose is effective in 
treating acne.  
● You/your child’s participation in this study will take about three months, and possibly 
up to six months.  
● An alternative to participating in this study is to receive the standard dosing regimen 
of doxycycline , which is 100mg twice a day.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. WHAT YOU WILL DO  
 
● As part of this study, you/your child will be asked to fill out the initial screening 
document and consent forms. During screening, female participants of reproductive 
age will be required to take a  pregnancy test, as part of standard drug safety 
processes. The Messenger clinic will cover the cost of this pregnancy test.  
● You/your child will be asked to take your prescription as directed. As part of this 
study, you/your child will be randomly assigned  to take either 20mg of doxycycline 
twice a day or 100mg  of doxycycline twice a day.  
● You/your child will also be asked to fill out a brief online questionnaire at home every 
two weeks, in order to evaluate whether or not you feel there any improvements in  
your acne.  
● Lastly, it is important that you/your child come back for a follow -up appointment after 
about three months of treatment for clinical evaluation.  
 
 
3. POTENTIAL BENEFITS       
                                                   
• You/your child’s participation in this study may help us understand how to best treat 
acne while decreasing antibiotic resistance.  Antibiotic resistance is when bacteria 
are not as easily treated by [CONTACT_405637].  Widespread use of  standard dose antibiotics 
can make bacteria resistant and lead to infections that are more difficult to treat in 
the future.  The lower dose of doxycycline in this study is too low to affect bacteria, 
but still has anti -inflammato ry action.  
 
 
4. POTENTIAL RISKS    
                                                                 
● It is possible that you/your child may have an adverse reaction to the antibiotic 
doxycycline. Common adverse reactions to include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea , and 
a rash in response to sunlight exposure.  
● It is also possible that this lower dose of doxycycline may not be as effective in 
treating acne as the standard dose, and that you/your child’s acne may not improve 
while participating in this study.  
● Doxycycl ine is contraindicated in pregnancy. If you/your child become pregnant 
during the study, the drug needs to be stopped immediately due to the risk to the 
fetus and you/your child will be withdrawn from the study. We encourage females of 
reproductive age who  may become pregnant to take proper precautions to prevent 
pregnancy.  
● Like any medication, doxycycline carries its own risks, described on the package 
insert. These risks would be present regardless of participation in the study. One 
such rare risk, as wit h all antibiotics, is inadvertently causing antibiotic resistance.  
 
 
 
5.  PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY                         
 
● As a participant in this study, you/your child’s privacy and confidentiality will be 
rigorously protected.  
● The data for this proj ect will be kept confidential. You/your child will never be 
identified in any reporting of the data.  
● Information about you/your child will be kept confidential to the maximum extent 
allowable by [CONTACT_2371].  
● The patient surveys are anonymous surveys through Qualtr ics, a secure survey 
system, with no identifiable data tracking to the submission.  
● Once collected, data will be deidentified and stored on a password -protected, secure 
server until completion of the study. A correlation tool will be used to de-identify data 
that will be kept separately in password protected files.  
● Information that personally identifies you/your child may be removed from the data, 
so that it may then be used for future research studies. After this de -identification it 
may be u sed for future research or distributed to another investigator for future 
studies without additional informed consent from you/your child.  
● Clinically relevant research results will not be returned to you/your child unless 
you/your child request it.  
● The res earch staff and MSU HRPP are the main entities who will have access to the 
data for the duration of the study, and for the three years following the completion of 
the study. The HRPP oversees research studies to ensure patient safety. It is 
possible that t he Food and Drug Administration may inspect the records.

STUDY M14 -397  |  Version [ADDRESS_1231229] under development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis 
(MS).  It is a monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) of the human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) isotype that binds 
specifically to the soluble and the membrane -bound for ms of repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMa).
Neutralization of RGMa is a novel approach that may potentially provide neurorestoration/regeneration 
and functional recovery in a variety of degenerative central nervous system (CNS) diseases.  Repulsive 
guidanc e molecule A is a potent inhibitor of neurite outgrowth and is recognized as an important factor 
in inhibiting neuronal regeneration and functional recovery following CNS trauma or inflammation.  
Elezanumab binds to human repulsive guidance molecule A (hRG Ma), but not to related family members 
RGMb and RGMc.
Elezanumab is being evaluated to determine whether this novel approach of neutralization of RGMa 
could lead to neural restoration and improvement in MS -related physical function.  This mechanism of 
action is distinct from those used by [CONTACT_318018], anti -inflammatory drugs that are currently 
approved for the treatment of MS and, if successful, could serve to fulfill an unmet medical need in MS.
Clinical Hypothesis
Elezanumab will improve physical functioning in subjects with progressive forms of MS (Progressive 
forms of multiple sclerosis [PMS]) who have disability.
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
The safety and efficacy data from the elezanumab clinical program support development of elezanumab 
inPhase 2 in subjects with PMS.
For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data in the elezanumab 
Investigator's Brochure.[ADDRESS_1231230] of the study.
Considering the coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit and risk to subjects 
participating in this study have been r e-evaluated.  Management of these adverse events (AEs) will be 
made on a case -by-case basis with consideration of benefit/risk.  However, based on the limited 
information to date, the population and disease being studied, and the anticipation that 
COVID -19-related risks are not expected to differ substantially between study subjects and the broader 
population of subjects receiving treatment for MS, no change to the benefit/risk balance for subjects in 
this study is expected at this time.

3.1 Objective
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of elezanumab in subjects with PMS.
3.2 Primary Endpoint
Primary endpoint:
Mean Overall Response Score (ORS) at Week 52.
Overall Response Score is a composite score derived from 4 components: 
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)
Timed 25 -Foot Walk (T25FW)
9-Hole Peg Test in the dominant hand (9HPT -D)
9HPT in the non -dominant hand (9HPT -ND)
The ORS is scored with a range from –4 to +4 at each assessment.  Scores for each component are 
assessed relati ve to their baseline value:  –1 if there is clinically significant worsening, 0 if the change 
does not meet the clinically significant threshold criteria, or +1 if there is clinically significant 
improvement.  The scores for all components are summed at ea ch assessment.
The clinically significant change thresholds for T25FW and 9HPT are defined by a 20% change from 
baseline ( ≥ 20% decrease from baseline for improvement and ≥ 20% increase from baseline for 
worsening).  For EDSS, improvement is defined as a 1 -point decrease (baseline EDSS range of 1 to 5.5), 
or 0.5 -point decrease if the baseline EDSS is 6.0 or greater (baseline EDSS range of 6.0 to 6.5).  
Corresponding increases in the designated ranges is defined as EDSS worsening.
3.3 Secondary Endpoints
1.Disabil ity improvement response rate on the Expanded Disability Status Scale Plus (EDSS +) 
(T25FW, [ADDRESS_1231231] [9HPT, either hand], EDSS) at Week 52 
2.ORS at Weeks 12, 24, and 36
3.4 Safety Endpoints
Safety evaluations include AE monitoring, serious adverse event (SAE) monitoring, adverse events of 
special interest (AESI) monitoring, physical examinations, neurologic examinations, vital sign 
measurements, clinically significant magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities, electrocardiogram 
(ECG) variables, Colum bia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) assessments, and clinical laboratory

duration.
3.5 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
Samples will be collected for se rum elezanumab concentrations, elezanumab anti- drug antibody (ADA) 
titers, and elezanumab neutralizing ADAs.  Samples will be obtained at the visits indicated in Figure 1
and Appendix D.  Descriptive summary statistics will be provided for all serum elezanumab 
concentrations.  Additional paramete rs may be estimated if useful in the interpretation of the data.
3.6 Biomarker Research Endpoints for Target Engagement and 
Neuro -restoration
Blood samples including serum and plasma will be collected at specified time points ( Appendix D) 
throughout the study to evaluate known and/or novel disease -related and target engagement 
biomarkers and their response to treatment.  Types of biomarkers may include nucleic acids, proteins, 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and/or metabolites.  Biomarker endpoints may include, but are not restricted to RGMa, 
neurofilament light (NFL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neuro -restoration markers 
[e.g., microRNA -338 (miR -338), myelin basic protein (MBP), prote olipid protein 1 (PLP1), growth 
associated protein -43 (GAP -43), brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), interleukin -10 (IL -10)] that 
may be measured as extravesicular protein and/or nucleic acid cargoes in the plasma.  Other biomarkers 
that may be examin ed in the blood include matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP -9) and chemokine (C -X-C 
motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13), which have been shown to be elevated in MS patients.  DNA and RNA samples 
(transcriptional profiling) will be collected and may be analyzed from all subjects, unless precluded by 
[CONTACT_318019].  This research may be exploratory in nature and the results may not be 
included with the clinical study report.

This study will include an approximate 30 -day Screening period.  The Treatment Period will include 
14visits from Baseline (Week 0) every 4 weeks through Week 52.  Doses will be administered via 
Intravenous (IV) infusion at Week 0 (Baseline) and every 4 weeks thereafter through Week 48 for a total 
of 13 doses.  Th e follow -up period includes 6 follow -up telephone calls that will occur at Weeks 56 
through 76.  All visits during the Treatment Period and Follow -up Period will be allowed a window of ± [ADDRESS_1231234] results, ECG, and vital signs will be monitored 
(see Operations Manual [Appendix F]).  Throughout the study and for a period of 39 weeks (5 half -lives) 
after t he time of last study drug administration, females of childbearing potential will undergo monthly 
pregnancy testing; and for all subjects' AEs will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously 
reported by [CONTACT_423].
Eligible subjects will be randomiz ed at the Week 0 -Baseline Visit to receive either elezanumab  
or  as an IV infusion or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio (Section 5.8and Sec tion 7.3).  Blinded doses will 
be administered intravenously every 4 weeks for 48 weeks.  Subjects should remain on their current MS 
treatment regim en throughout the study.

Selection of Doses in the Study
The dose levels of  and  monthly for this study were selected on the basis of safety and 
biomarker data from two Phase 1 clinical studies.
The safety and tolerability of elezanumab has been demonstrated in ~ 50 healthy volunteers and

monthly doses of up to  were administered to MS patients for up to [ADDRESS_1231238] to the nature or frequency 
of treatment -emergent AEs in subjects who received elezanumab compared with subjects who received 
placebo.  A possible transient, non –dose -related, non -clinically significant elevation in blood pressure 
immediately following IV infusion was observed in a few subjects who received elezanumab. There 
were no notable changes on physical or neurological exam, and no ECG, MRI, clinical laboratory, or 
other vital sign perturbations.  Adverse events, when reported, were mild, sporadic, and self -limiting 
with the exception of [ADDRESS_1231239] receiving placebo and another receiving 
 elezanumab.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Two prespecified CSF biomarkers demonstrated a concentration -response relationship in the Phase 1 
studies.  Interleukin -10 has been associated with the promotion of remyelination, n euroregeneration, 
and neuroprotection as well as being able to mitigate inflammatory demyelination.  In Study M14 -173, a 
statistically significant increase in CSF IL -10 was observed.  The increase was observed only in the high 
dose of  monthly.  Likewise, in the same study, a statistically significant decrease in CSF 
neurofilament light (NF -l), a marker of neurodegeneration, was observed at the  dose when 
compared with the  dose group.  These data suggest a clinically relevant, dose -related 
pharmacodynamic effect.  Reductions in CSF soluble RGMa were observed in both Studies M14 -141 and 
M14 -173.  The maximum reduction was approximately 50% from baseline, and the maximum reduction 
was seen at single doses equal to and exceeding  in healthy volunteers and repeat doses equal to 
or exceeding  monthly in MS patients.  It is noteworthy that the maximum CSF reduction in 
soluble RGMa was achieved in the  dose group, which was characterized by a range of CSF 
ABT-[ADDRESS_1231240] been 
implemented.  An unblinded internal Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), independent from the study 
team, will review and evaluate safety information including, but not limited to AEs, vital signs, and 
clinical laboratory assessments.

STUDY M14 -397  |  Version [ADDRESS_1231268] Identifier Assignment
An interactive response technology (IRT) system will assign a unique id entification number to each 
subject at the Screening Visit.  For subjects who do not meet the study selection criteria, site personnel 
must register the subject as a screen failure in the IRT system.
Subjects who are enrolled will retain the subject number assigned to them at Screening Visit throughout 
the study.
Interactive response technology Vendor contact [CONTACT_318028].
Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Eligible subjects will receive either elezanumab  or placebo as an IV infusion at a 
constant rate by [CONTACT_318029] [ADDRESS_1231269] minute as well.  Blinded doses will be administered intravenously every 
4weeks for 48 weeks (13 total infusions).
Study Drug Accountability
The investigator or his representative will verify that study drug supplies are receiv ed intact and in the 
correct amounts.  This will be documented by [CONTACT_41143] a proof of receipt or similar document.  
A current (running) and accurate inventory of study drug will be maintained in the IRT system.
Throughout the study and at the stu dy site closeout visit, overall accountability will be performed and 
verified by [CONTACT_318030] (CRA) (Pharmacy CRA).  
The unblinded pharmacist or qualified designee will be responsible for maintaining study drug 
preparat ion records and drug accountability records for study drug as well as the saline IV solution 
dispensed by [CONTACT_779], including product description, manufacturer, and lot numbers.  Further details are 
provided in the Pharmacy Manual.
Study Blinding
Subjects in the placebo group will be administered 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection/Solution for Infusion 
that is identical in appearance and volume to the elezanumab solution.  An unblinded pharmacist or 
qualified designee will receive assignments and prepare the blinded doses across the treatment groups.  
The investigator, study site personnel (except the unblinded pharmacist or qualified designee) and the 
subject will remain blinded to the treatment assignment throughout the course of the study.
Because of the blinding of this study, deliveries of elezanumab and 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection/Solution, if applicable, will be shipped directly to the pharmacy.  The unblinded pharmacist or 
qualified designee will prepare the dosing of elezanumab (in a blinded manner) following the available 
preparation instructions in the Pharmacy Manual and based on the subject's assigned treatment group.

STUDY M14 -397  |  Version 5 .0
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].For blinding purposes, identical commercial 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection/Solution for Infusion bag or 
bottle will be use d in the placebo and elezanumab arms at each site.
For investigational product monitoring, there will be an unblinded [COMPANY_013] CRA (also referred to as a 
Pharmacy CRA) for verification of unblinded preparation documentation.  The unblinded Pharmacy CRA 
will be a separate individual than the blinded CRA to ensure blinding is maintained.
All [COMPANY_013] personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the trial (with the 
exception of [COMPANY_013] Drug Supply Management Team, the unblinded CRA and the AbbVi e safety review 
group), the investigator, study site personnel, and the subject will remain blinded to each subject's 
treatment throughout the study.
The IRT will provide access to unblinded subject treatment information in the case of a medical 
emergency.
[COMPANY_013] must be notified before breaking the blind, unless identification of the study drug is required for 
a medical emergency, i.e., situation in which the knowledge or the specific blinded treatment will affect 
the immediate management of the subject's conditions (e.g., antidote is available).  [COMPANY_013] must then 
be notified within [ADDRESS_1231270] be recorded in the source documentation and on the eCRF, as applicable.
5.8 Randomization/Dru g Assignment
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_1231271]'s assigned treatment group.  The 
use of the IRT system is described in the Operations Manual Section 3.15 ( Appendix F).
Randomization (Section 7.3) will be stratified between treatment and placebo arms based on the 
following factors:
Diagnosis of PPMS vs. SPMS
Presence or absence of background MS immunotherapy
5.9 Protocol Deviations
[COMPANY_013] does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol except when necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  The investigator is responsible for c omplying with all 
protocol requirements, written instructions, and applicable laws regarding protocol deviations.  If a 
protocol deviation occurs (or is identified, including those that may be due to the COVID -19 pandemic), 
the investigator is responsible for notifying IEC/independent review board (IRB), regulatory authorities 
(as applicable), and [COMPANY_013].

STUDY M14 -397  |  Version [ADDRESS_1231272]/device.  Complaints associated with any component of this investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_013].
Product Complaint
A product complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the 
medical device component(s).
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the 
labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properly, 
or packaging issues.
Product complaints concerni ng the investigational product and/or device must be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during the 
study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Event
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the 
product.  The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a 
routine basis throughout the study.  All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre- existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been 
pre planned before study entry.  However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during
the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for 
which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an AE, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the follow ing criteria, it is to be 
reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilance or contract research organization (CRO) (as appropriate) 
as an SAE within 24 hours of the site's being made aware of the SAE (refer to Section 4.2 of the 
Operations Manual [ Appendix F] for reporting details and contact [CONTACT_3031]):

STUDY M14 -397  |  Version [ADDRESS_1231273]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include 
an emergency room visit or visit to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in 
fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with 
the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability i s not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Pre vent 
Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on 
medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anoma ly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration up to 39 weeks (5 half -lives) fro m the last 
dose of study drug (Week 48 visit) will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_1560].  In addition, SAEs and protocol -related nonserious AEs will be collected from the time the 
subject signs the study -specific informe d consent.
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) reporting for 
the IMP in accordance with global and local requirements.  Additional information about S[LOCATION_003]R 
reporting is presented in the Operations Manual ( Appendix F) Section 5.2 S[LOCATION_003]R Reporting.
Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will rate the severity of each AE as mi ld, moderate, or severe.  The investigator will use 
the following definitions to rate the severity of each AE:
Page 26 of 101 
STUDY M14 -397  |  Version 5 .0
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Mild:   The AE is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate:   The AE causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usua l activities.
Severe:   The AE causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities and may be 
incapacitating or life -threatening.
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study 
drug:
Reasonable Possibility –After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, 
clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest 
a causal relationship.
No Reasonab le Possibility –After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence 
(information) to suggest a causal relationship.
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may 
indicate a trend or risk to subjects.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
For AESIs, serious and nonserious, meeting predefined criteria, specific questionnaires will be used to 
standardize the collection of follow -up information.  The AESI questionnaires will be issued within the 
electronic data capture (EDC) system once applicable.  The investigator will enter the information into 
the EDC system once applicable.
The following AESI will be monitored during the study:
Infusion reactions
Further information about AESIs is provided in the Operations Manual ( Appendix F) Section 4.1.
Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_1231274] be 
discontinued (Section 5.5).  If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject, information regarding the 
pregnancy and the outcome will be collected.
The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is 
considered a SAE and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the 
event.

7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP).  The SAP will be finalized before the interim database lock.  The sta tistical 
analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]).
7.2 Definition for Analysis Sets
The Modified ITT (mITT) Set includes all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Subjects will be grouped a ccording to treatment as randomized. 
Multiple sclerosis expert(s) will confirm which subjects experienced a clinical relapse(s) through 
adjudication of study data, including the MS -relapse questionnaire.  The RF Set includes all subjects in 
the mITT data set without any MS -related relapse during the Treatment Period (from Week 0 to 
Week 52).  Subjects will be grouped according to treatment as randomized.
The Minimal Missed Infusion Analysis (MMIA) Set includes all randomized subjects who received at least 
[ADDRESS_1231275]'s final dose.  Subjects will be 
grouped according to treatment as randomized.
The Safety Analysis Set includes all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  Subjects will be 
grouped according to treatment received regardless of randomization.
7.3 Statistical Analyses for Efficacy
The ORS scores will be summarized descriptively (including n, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
median, and maximum) along with the 95% confidence interval at each visit.  The frequency and 
percentage of ORS for –4 to +[ADDRESS_1231276] model for 
repeated measures (MMRM) including treatment group, visit, treatment- by-visit interaction, and 
stratification factors as fixed effects, with the baseline values for the ORS components as covariates.
For other continuous efficacy endpoints, the mean, standard devia tion, median, minimum and 
maximum will be reported for each treatment group.  The treatment comparison will be conducted 
using MMRM model including treatment group, visit, treatment -by-visit interaction, and stratification 
factors as fixed effects and the baseline value associated with the endpoint as a covariate.
For binary efficacy endpoints, the frequency and percentage will be provided by [CONTACT_1570].  The 
treatment comparison will be conducted using a logistic regression model adjusted for the stra tification 
factors and baseline score associated with the endpoint.
All efficacy endpoints will be analyzed on mITT population.  The RF and MMIA Sets will be used for the 
primary and other efficacy analyses as specified in the SAP.

No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Sample Size Estimation
Approximately 90 subjects will be equally randomized 1:1:1 to each treatment group (30 subjects in 
each treatment group, with a target of 20 PPMS subjects and approximately 10 SPMS subjects per 
treatment group).  There is limited prior data to estimate the magnitude of effect and variance for a 
neurorestorative therapy.  The sample size was therefore selected based on operational feasibility, 
variance seen in prior MS trials, and the likelihood of predicting success in subsequent phases of 
development. 
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety
Analysis of the following safety evaluations will be performed during the study:  Adverse events and 
SAEs; vital signs, laboratory tests, ECG, physical and neurologic examinations, and C -SSRS assessments.
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis of safety evaluations will be described and fully 
documented in the SAP.

Version 4.0 03 November 2020
Protocol Summary of Changes
The purpose of this version is the removal of on -site assessments performed at Weeks 64 and 76 so that 
all visits in the Follow -up period can be conducted virtually.  Other administrative revisions were made 
throughout the protocol, including the synopsis, and to the Operations Manual, to ensure consistency 
with the changes below:
1.Protocol Section 4.1, Overall Study Design and Plan, Figure 1. Study Schematic and Protocol 
Appendix D. Activity Schedule: Remove Weeks 64 and 76 as an on -site visit. 
2.Update to Appendix F, Operations Manual: Section 2.1, Individual Treatment Period Visit 
Activities and Section 2.2, Individual Post -Treatment Period Visit Activities (Week 64 and 
Week 76) to remove vital signs, EDSS, T25FW, 9HPT, urine drug and alcohol test, PK and A DA 
sample collections; Section 3.6 Scales and Questionnaires table to remove EDSS T25FW, 9HPT 
from Follow -up at Weeks 64 and 76.
Rationale:
By [CONTACT_36466] 2021, all study subjects had completed 52 weeks of therapy.  A recent, planned efficacy 
analysis revealed that elezanumab therapy provided no beneficial effects.  A lack of efficacy was 
observed on all endpoints.
The study initially had schedule d in person site visits at Week 64 and Week 76.  The purpose of these 
visits was to perform assessment of the primary endpoint to better understand the durability of 
improvement observed at Week 52.  Because there were no beneficial drug effects at Week 52 , there is 
no scientific purpose to having the subjects return for in person visits.  The ongoing COVID -19 pandemic 
also provides a strong justification for NOT having subjects perform unneeded in person site visits.
The collection of safety -related information by [CONTACT_122919] 4 weeks through Week 76, including AEs, 
C-SSRS assessments, and pregnancy testing results will continue.

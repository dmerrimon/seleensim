respi[INVESTIGATOR_272359]. In a 
2010 study, 33.3% of urgent care center visits were found to be due to upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073].

found to be for antibiotics.7 Antibiotic overuse for acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_272360].1 With the increasing threat 
of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), accurate and rapid diagnostics will aid in preventing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and promote antimicrobial stewardship.

 FilmArray Panel which in previous studies has been shown to be highly effective in 
diagnosing acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_10711].    Study Objectives:  
Aim 1 : To asses improvement  in patient -reported outcomes  (PRO) in Urgent Care 
patients with acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_272362]2.1 (EXP) versus  standard 
care (SC).  
 Hypotheses : Improvement in PRO’s in group ( tested with RP2.1 (EXP ) vs. standard 
care (SC)) assessed at Day 0 (i.e., day of test) and/ or Day 7 (call-back).  
 Outcomes  
Primary :  
• Satisfaction with Urgent Care (willingness to recommend urgent care versus 
others). Day 0.  
  
Secondary :  
• Satisfaction with Urgent Care (willingness to recommend urgent care versus 
others).  Day 7.  
• Time isolated  (or recommended to isolate) by [CONTACT_4676]. Day 0, 7.  
• Time isolated  (or recommended to isolate) by [CONTACT_103106] / close contacts. 
Day 0, 7. 
• Understanding of current disease process. Day 0 , 7 
• Need for additional diagnostic tests  by [CONTACT_4676] . Day 7. 
• Need for additional diagnostic tests of family members / close contacts. Day 7. 
• Missed time at wor k. Day 7. 
  
Aim 2 : To determine the difference in Urgent Care provider -reported outcomes  after 
treatment of  patients with acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_272363]2.1 vs. SC.  Assessed 
by [CONTACT_272367].  
 Hypothesis : Use of RP2.1 will lead to differences in provider -reported outcomes  
assessed at D ay 0 compared to SC.  
 
• Confidence in diagnosis  
• Recommendations regarding isolation 
• Ability to address patient needs / questions.  
• Recommendations regarding disease course.  
• Follow up recommendations  
 Study Synopsis  
 Stud y Design

 Sites  
Two GW Urgent Care sites (McPherson Square, Rhode Island Avenue) - also known as 
Immediate and Primary Care Sites (IPC)  
 
Enrollment times  
7 5 days per week, RA’s s creen for relevant chief complaint related to respi[INVESTIGATOR_42977] .  
 
• (Estimate 5 hours per day = 25 hours  / week ) at all 3 sites.  Therefore, 5 hours  x 3 
sites = 15 hours per day . Per week,  15 hours x 7 days / week  = 105 hours  / week  
• Follow up and survey = 3 hours per day = 21  hours / week  
• 105 + 21 = 136 RA hours per week  
 
Study Arms  
EXP: RP2.1  result  communicated plus scripted communication of meaning of resu lts.  
SC: Standard communication  
 
Outcome Measures  
Day 0   
RA communicat es results and assessment of Day 0 relevant patient, provider and 
process outcomes.  
 Day 7  
Review of EHR (Allscripts , CRISP ) 
Patient follow -up assessment performed by [CONTACT_648].  
 Processing Samples  
Samples will be collected and processed at  the three  urgent care/immediate primary 
care facilities (IPCs) affiliated with  George Washington University  Medical Faculty 
Associates .  
 
• Testing will occur on site.  Each urgent care performs  CLIA -waived lab tests for 
point of care tests.   
 
• Any Non- RP2.1  testing will be allowed in either group per discretion of the 
provider.  
 
• Standardize script for communication of results provided on same day as testing to providers.  
 Standard care  
Most patients with symptoms of a respi[INVESTIGATOR_272364] e testing fo r COVID -
19. The process for suspected COVID is to run a SARS antigen test  initially . Results of 
the antigen tests are available within [ADDRESS_332833] are d ependent on the number of tests LabCorp is  performing  but typi[INVESTIGATOR_272365] | 5  
 
 
 
 between 24 to 96 hours.   All patients with results that are positive receive a phone call; 
for patients with a negative test, no call is made and patients  must access the patient 
portal  to get results.   
 
Our expectation is that the use of RP2.1  will lead to improved satisfaction for 
patient and provider.   
 Inclusion Criteria  
• Age 7-year-old 
• Clinically stable  
• Must present with one symptom of respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375] (e.g., cough, sneezing, 
runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, headaches, muscle aches, trouble breathing, shortness of breath, and/or fever).  
 Exclusion criteria   
• Patient is unable to provide informed consent  
• Chronic symptoms (>14 days)  or asymptomatic  
• Unstable (or “too sick” to consent)  
• Prisoner or ward of state  
• Non-English speaker  
 Potential barriers  and solutions  
• Success for the study requires provider buy -in to aid with recruitment efforts .  
Lack of provider buy -in may hind er sample size  ascertainment . Proposed 
solutions include electronic alerts , incentive payments,  and communication aids 
to physicians to discuss results with patients.   
• Successful undertaking of this study requires dedicated research staff to ensure high recruitment goals and fidelity to protocol. We have budgeted for a study coordinator with 25 % effort allocated directly to the project  in addition to [ADDRESS_332834] several trained 
research assistants who will be assigned to this study allowing for rapid 
implementation of study.  
 Data Analysis and Statistical plan  
We anticipate that we will enroll 30 patients per week for 12 weeks, 360 patients . (Full 
power analysis still forthcoming,)  
 Data Collection

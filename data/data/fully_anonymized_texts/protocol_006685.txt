Study Des ign This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open -label, rollover study in subjects with CF who 
are homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and who 
participated in Studies  VX13-661-103, VX14- 661-106, VX14- 661-107, 
VX14-661-108, VX14- 661-109, VX14- 661-111, VX15- 661-112, VX1 6-661-114, 
or other Vertex studies investigating VX -661 in combination with ivacaftor. The 
study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long -term treatment of 
VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor.  
Subjects in the Treatment Cohort will receive VX -661 100 mg/ivacaftor 150- mg 
FDC tablet daily (qd) in the morning and ivacaftor 150- mg tablet qd in the 
evening. The Treatment Period will be approximately 96  weeks. 
While participating in the Treatment Cohort , if allowed by [CONTACT_363530], subjects may screen for the other Vertex study of investigational CFTR 
modulators (including clinical studies of Next Generation CFTR modulators , 
hereafter referred to as “another qualified Vertex study”), but are not permitted to 
screen for studies of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor and ivacaftor monotherapy.  
Subjects who completed at least 4  weeks of treatment before discontinuing 
Study VX14-661-110 to participate in another qualified Vertex study, and who 
meet the eli gibility criteria ( Sections 9.1 and 9.2) will be offered the opportunity 
to re-enroll once in the  Study VX14-661-110 Treatment Cohort. Subjects who 
re-enroll will resume treatment with VX -661/ivacaftor at the next study day after 
their previous treatment discontinuation in Study VX14-661-110. Subjects who 
discontinue Study  VX14-661-[ADDRESS_452701] 
is continuing onto commercially available VX -661/ivacaftor, the Early Treatment 
Termination Visit will be completed before dosing with commercial drug begins, and the Safety Follow -up Visit will not be required. Alternatively,  if local health 
authorities decline to approve, or if clinical benefit is not demonstrated for the use of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor for the treatment of CF in populations 
enrolled in Study  VX14-661-110, subjects with the relevant CFTR genotypes may 
be discontinued after communication to investigators and IRBs/IECs of the 
risks/benefits related to the safety and efficacy observed for the subset of subjects. If subjects are discontinued from the study, an Early Treatment Termination Visit should occur wit hin [ADDRESS_452702] dose of study drug.  
Observational Cohort  
Subjects <18  years of age (age on the date of informed consent/assent in the 
parent study) who received at least [ADDRESS_452703] -treatment safety of 
VX-661/ivacaftor combination therapy.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects an estimated 70,[ADDRESS_452725] in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an epi[INVESTIGATOR_139327] (Cl
-) channel 
activated by [CONTACT_315435] -dependent protein kinase A that is responsible for aiding in the 
regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion in various tissues .2 This function is 
defective in patients with CF due to a loss of cell surface expression and/or function. 
More than [ADDRESS_452726] the quantity of functional cell surface CFTR 
protein include defects that reduce CFTR protein synthesis and defects that impede the cellular processing and delivery of CFT R proteins to the cell surface.  
CFTR gene mutations associated with minimal CFTR function include  
• mutations associated with severe defects in ability of the CFTR channel to open and close, 
known as defective channel gating or “gating mutations”; 
• severe defects in the cellular processing of CFTR and its delivery to the cell surface;  
• no (or minimal) CFTR synthesis; and  
• severe defects in channel conductance.  
The most prevalent mutation is an in -frame deletion in the CFTR gene resulting in a loss of 
phenylalani ne at position 508 in the CFTR protein (F508del- CFTR).
[ADDRESS_452727] 87% 
of patients with CF have at least 1  copy of the  F508del- CFTR mutation, and approximately 47% 
have 2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014].11 In the European Union, approximately 83% of patients with CF have 1 or 
2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_1093] F508del- CFTR mutation, and approximately 38.7% of patients with CF in the 
[LOCATION_008] have [ADDRESS_452728] been studied.9 One approach is to treat with a compound that will modify the cellular 
processing and delivery of CFTR protein to the cell surface. This kind of compound has been 
termed a CFTR corrector. Another approach is to treat with a compound that increases channel gating activity of protein kinase A -activated CFTR at the cell surface to enhance ion transport. 
This kind of compound has been termed a potentiator. Depending on the amount of residual CFTR channel activity in the membrane and the pathophysiology of that activity (reflecting the CFTR genotype of the patient and possibly other factors), both approaches may be required to ameliorate lung disease in patients with CF. A modest restoration of Cl
- secretion through the 
action of a potentiator and/or corrector could prevent the hyperabsorption of water across the api[INVESTIGATOR_139329], allowing for proper  maintenance of airway hydration. Adequate 
airway hydration could alleviate the cycle of mucus plugging, infection, and inflammation that leads to irreversible structural changes in the lungs, and eventually respi[INVESTIGATOR_315404]. 
VX-661 is a compound developed by [CONTACT_139369] (Vertex) that has been shown to have CFTR corrector properties. Several lines of in vitro evidence suggest that VX-661 works by [CONTACT_363534] a fraction of F508del- CFTR protein during its 
biogenesis and processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, allowing it to exit the endoplasmic reticulum and traffic to the cell surface.
16 When added for more than 24 hours to human 
bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] (HBE) cells isolated and cultured fro m lung explants obtained from donors 
with CF (CF -HBE cells) who are homozygous for the F508del- CFTR mutation, a 
concentration -dependent increase in levels of mature (i.e.,  plasma membrane) F508del -CFTR 
was observed. The increased trafficking of F508del- CFTR to the cell surface resulted in a 
significant increase in Cl− secretion .[ADDRESS_452729] the processing and localization of 
other misfo lded or normally folded proteins other than CFTR, suggesting that the mechanism of 
VX-661 action is selective for CFTR (CFTR corrector).17 
Ivacaftor (also known as VX-770) is the first CFTR modulator to show an improvement in CFTR function and clinical bene fit in patients with CF. Results from several Phase [ADDRESS_452730] mutations that result in gating defects as evidenced by [CONTACT_139371] (measured  by [CONTACT_139372]) and corresponding substantial, durable

 DESIGN 
8.1 Overview of Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, rollover study in subjects with CF who are 
homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del- CFTR mutation and who participated in 
Studies VX13 -661-103, VX14-661-106, VX14-661-107, VX14-661-108, VX14-661-109, 
VX14-661-111, or other Vertex studies investigating VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor. The 
study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long -term treatment of VX -661 in 
combination with ivacaftor. 
A schematic of the study desi gn is shown in Figure  8-1. 
This study consists of a Treatment Cohort (eligible subjects 12 years of age and older) and an 
Observational Cohort (eligible subjects <18 years of age [age on the date of informed consent/assent in the parent study]), which will enroll subjects from Studies VX13 -661-103,

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   VX14-661-106, VX14 -661-107, VX14 -661-108, VX14-661-109, VX14 -661-111, and other 
Vertex studies investigating VX -661 in combination with ivacaftor. The Treatment Cohort and 
the Observational Cohort will be open to enrollment in parallel.  
Treatment Cohort  
Subjects who completed study drug treatment (i.e., VX-661/ivacaftor, ivacaftor monotherapy, or 
placebo) during the Treatment Period in the parent study who meet the eligibility criteria (Sections 9.1 and 9.2)  will be offered the opportunity to enroll in Study VX14 -661-110. Subjects 
who permanently discontinue study drug treatment or who withdrew consent during the parent study are not eli gible for enrollment in the Treatment Cohort.  
Subjects in the Treatment Cohort will receive VX -661 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 -mg fixed-dose 
combination (FDC) tablet daily (qd) in the morning and ivacaftor 150-mg tablet qd in the evening. The Treatment Period wi ll be approximately [ADDRESS_452737] 4  weeks of treatment before discontinuing Study VX14-661-110 
to participate in another qualif ied Vertex study , and who meet the eligibility criteria ( Sections 9.1 
and 9.2), will be offered the opportunity to re- enroll in the Treatment Cohort of 
Study VX14-661-110. Subjects who re- enroll will resume treatment with VX-661/ivacaftor at 
the next study day after their previous treatment dis continuation from Study VX14-661-110 
(e.g., a subject who discontinued at Study Day  50 would resume treatment at Study Day  51). 
Subjects who discontinue Study VX14-661-[ADDRESS_452738], if VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor is approved and 
available for the treatment of CF in populations enrolled in Study VX14-661-110, subjects with 
the approved CFTR genotypes may be discontinued from this rollover study at the discretion of the sponsor (Section 10.6 ). If a subject is continuing onto commerciall y available 
VX-661/ivacaftor, the Early Treatment Termination Visit (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) will be completed 
before dosing with commercial drug begins, and the Safety Follow- up Visit (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) will 
not be required. Alternatively, if local health authorities decline to approve, or if clinical benefit is not demonstrated for the use of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor for the treatment of CF in populations enrolled in Study VX14-661-110, subjects with the relevant CFTR genotypes may 
be discontinued after communication to investigators and IR Bs/IECs of the risks/benefits related 
to the safety and efficacy observed for the subset of subjects. If subjects are discontinued from the study, an Early Treatment Termination Visit should occur within [ADDRESS_452739] dose of study drug and a Safety F ollow-up Visit should occur within 28 (±  7) days after the last dose of 
study drug. 
Observational Cohort  
Subjects <18  years of age (age on the date of informed consent/assent in the parent study) who 
received at least [ADDRESS_452740] not to enroll in the Treatment Cohort, and meet eligibility criteria (Section 
9.1) will be offered the opportunity to enroll in the Observational Cohort.

Protocol VX14- 661-110, Version 3.4 IRE, ESP, ISR, US Page 28 of 75 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   [IP_ADDRESS]  Long- term  Follow -up 
Subjects will be followed for approximately [ADDRESS_452753] year and at approximately 2 years (± 4 weeks) 
as shown in Table 3-2.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_452754] to follow-up if both of the following occur: 
• The subject misses 2  consecutive study visits (telephone contact [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or clinic visit) and is 
subsequent ly unable to be contact[CONTACT_5143] (3  documented attempts by [CONTACT_155417] 2 weeks following the second missed visit) 
• The subject does not respond within [ADDRESS_452755] demonstrated significant increases in lung function (FEV
1) in subjects with CF who are homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR 
mutation when treated with VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor when compared to placebo (Study VX11-661-101) .
18 Four Phase 3 studies are investigating the efficacy and safety of 
VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor in subjects with CF who are homozygous (Study VX14-661-106) or heterozygous (Studies VX14 -661-107, VX14 -661-108, and 
VX14-661-109) with F508del- CFTR mutation . Study VX14-661- 107 was terminated early 
because the study met the prespecified futility criteria. In addition , 3 Phase 2 studies are 
investigating the safety and efficacy of VX -661 in combination with ivacaftor in subjects with 
CF who are homozygous for F508del- CFTR (Study VX13-661-103, Study VX14-661-111, and 
Study VX15 -661-112). Study VX16-661-114 is a Phase 3b study being conducted in subjects 
with CF who are homozygous for F5 08del. 
Study VX14 -661-110 will enroll subjects with CF who participated in a qualifying parent study 
of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor (Studies VX13-661-103, VX14 -661-106, 
VX14-661-107, VX14 -661-108, VX14 -661-109, VX14-661-111, and other eligible Ver tex 
studies investigating VX -661 in combination with ivacaftor ). Study VX14 -661-110 will enroll 
subjects with CF who participated in a qualifying parent study (Studies VX15 -661-112, 
VX16-661-114, and other eligible Vertex studies investigating VX -661 in combination with 
ivacaftor) or who completed study drug treatment. 
Results from Study VX14-661-110 will provide information on the safety and efficacy of long-
term treatment with VX -661 in combination ivacaftor in subjects with CF who are aged 12 years 
and older and homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del- CFTR mutation. Study VX14-661-
110 offers an opportunity to continue treatment with VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor for subjects in qualifying parent studies who had completed their assigned treatme nt with 
combination therapy. For subjects who received placebo in their qualifying parent study, 

Protocol VX14- 661-110, Version 3.4 IRE, ESP, ISR, US Page 29 of 75 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Study VX14-661-110 offers the opportunity to receive treatment with VX-661 in combination 
with ivacaftor. For subjects <18 years of age (age on the date of informed consent/assent in the 
parent study) not eligible for further treatment with VX -661 and ivacaftor or who choose not to 
continue treatment, participation in the Observational Cohort of this study provides an opportunity for long- term safety data collection after subjects discontinue VX-661 in 
combination with ivacaftor in an eligible parent study .  
If an evaluation of the efficacy data from the Phase 3 studies suggests that the VX-661/ivacaftor 
treatment does not provide clinically meaningful benefit for subsets of subjects included in these studies, Vertex may recommend that subjects with relevant genotypes discontinue from the Treatment Cohort. In addition, if local health authori ties decline to approve, or if clinical benefit 
is not demonstrated for the use of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor for the treatment of CF in populations enrolled in Study VX14-661-110, subjects with the relevant CFTR genotypes may 
be discontinued aft er communication to investigators and IRBs/IECs of the risks/benefits related 
to the safety and efficacy observed for the subset of subjects. 
8.2.2  Study Drug Dose and Duration 
All subjects enrolled in the Treatment Cohort will receive the same regimen of study drug that is 
being administered in the Phase 3 studies of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor in subjects with CF who are 12 years of age or older. Subjects will receive a morning dose of VX-661 100 mg/ivacaftor 150 mg (FDC tablet) and an evening dose of ivacaftor  150 mg. These dosages 
were selected based on efficacy, safety, and tolerability results from Study  VX11-661-101.
18 The 
dose regimen of ivacaftor planned for this study (150 mg q12h) is the current labeled dose regimen for patients with CF with gating mutations who are 12  years of age and older. Dosages 
for subjects 12 to 17 years of age (same as the adult dosage) were determined based on the 
historical data on weight as a function of age in patients with CF from the ivacaftor Phase [ADDRESS_452756] parameters for clinical studies in drug development. 
The efficacy assessments are widely accepted and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and 
relevant to the study of patients with CF.  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]: As lung disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality for patients with CF, 
CF lung disease is the desired primary target of VX-661/ivacaftor combination therapy. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (as measured by [CONTACT_10266]
1) is the most widely implemented standardized assessment to 
evaluate lung function. 
Nutritional Status (measured by [CONTACT_315442]): Malnutrition is common in patients with CF 
because of increased energy expenditures due to lung disease and fat malabsorption. Given that VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor is a systemic therapy, it has the potential to improve extrapulm onary manifestations of CF, including those in the gastrointestinal system. Improved 

Protocol VX14- 661-110, Version 3.4 IRE, ESP, ISR, US Page 30 of 75 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   nutritional status, defined as an increase in weight and/or BMI, is considered an appropriate 
endpoint for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_363506]-targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Studies  VX08-770-102 and VX08-770- 103). To evaluate the effect of 
VX-[ADDRESS_452757] of VX -661 in combination with ivacaftor on growth and 
nutrition adjusted for age and sex, weight- for-age, height -for-age, BMI -for-age, and the 
respective z -scores will be determined. Height and weight will be collected at the study visits 
indicated in the schedule of assessments.  
CFQ-R: The CFQ -R is a frequently used CF- specific instrument that measur es the health -related 
quality of life of patients with CF.21,22,[ADDRESS_452758] of VX -661 in combination with ivacaftor on patient report of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_315410] -related quality of life.  
Other Events Related to Outcome:  Pulmonary exacer bations, administration of antibiotic therapy 
for sinopulmonary signs and symptoms, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_363507].  CF pulmonary exacerbations are a 
compi[INVESTIGATOR_363508], including the use of intravenous (IV) antibiotics administered at home, at the site, or in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491]/or pulmonary exacerbations that may require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. To date, there is no generally accepted objective definition of a pulmonary exacerbation,
[ADDRESS_452759] definition, reduction in pulmonary exac erbation rate has served as a key 
clinical efficacy measure in definitive CF clinical studies, supporting the registration of 2  chronic 
CF pulmonary therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (inhaled recombinant human DNase and inhaled tobramycin) .[ADDRESS_452760] event of IV courses of antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations will be derived. For 
data consistency, this protocol specifies 1 definition of pulmonary exacerbation which is based on the definition used for the other studies including the ivacaftor monotherapy initial registration studies (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) . Because signs and symptoms in the definition may occur 
without meeting the overall definition of a pulmonary exacerbation, the number and timing of

9.3 Study Restrictions  (Treatment Cohort)  
For subjects enrolled in the Treatment Cohort, prohibited medications and certain foods are not allowed in this study while subjects are receiving study drug (Table 9-1 ). Both VX-[ADDRESS_452767]. John’s wort ( Hypericum  perforatum ) 
has the potential to significantly reduce VX-661 and ivacaftor exposure and is restricted in this 
study. Case-by-case exceptions for concomitant use of a moderate CYP3A inducer with 
VX-661/ivacaftor may be granted by [CONTACT_363538]'s opi[INVESTIGATOR_363511]. 
A more detailed but nonexhaustive list of study prohibitions and cautions for food and 
medication will be provided in the Study Reference Manual.

Restricted Medication/Food  Study Period  
Certain fruits and fruit juices 
(grapefruit, grapefruit juice, 
Seville oranges, marmalade)  None allowed within [ADDRESS_452768] dose of the study drug  through

CFTR: cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; CYP: cytochrome P450.  
9.4 Prior and Concomitant Medications  (Treatment Cohort)  
Medicinal products affected by [CONTACT_94273] -661/ivacaftor 
CYP3A, P-gp, or CYP2C9 substrates 
Co-administration with (oral) midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, did not affect midazolam 
exposure. No dose adjustment is required when co- administer ed with CYP3A substrates. 
Based on in vitro data, ivacaftor and its M1 metabolite have the potential to inhibit 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Co- administration of VX-661/ivacaftor with digoxin, a sensitive P- gp 
substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of P- gp by 
[CONTACT_328344]. Administration of VX-661/ivacaftor may increase systemic exposure of medicinal 
products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions . Use with caution and appropriate monitoring when using 
concomitant digoxin or other substrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index. Ivacaftor may 

Protocol VX14- 661-110, Version 3.4 IRE, ESP, ISR, US Page 35 of 75 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   inhibit CYP2C9; therefore, monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) during 
co-administration of VX-661/ivacaftor with warfarin is recommended.  
Information regarding all prior and concomitant medications, including the subject's CF medications, other medications, and herbal and naturopathic remedies administered at or after completion of treatment in the parent study through the Safety Follow- up Visit, if applicable, 
will be recorded in each subject's source documents.  
• Subjects must remain on a stable CF medication (and supplement) regimen through the 
Safety Follow-up Visit. Stable medication regimen is defined as the current medication 
regimen fo r CF that subjects have been following for at least [ADDRESS_452770] not initiate long -term treatment with new medication from 28  days before Day  1 
through the Safety  Follow-up Visit unless it is discussed and approved by [CONTACT_363539].  Guidelines for stable medication regimens for CF are as follows: 
o Subjects who are taking daily inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled antibiotics 
should remain on that regimen throughout the study. 
o Subjects who are on inhaled cycling antibiotics should continue on their prior schedule. The timing of the first dose of study drug should be synchronized as closely as possible to the first day of inhaled cycling antibiotics in the cycle.  
o Subjects who alternate [ADDRESS_452771] day of 1 of the inhaled alternating antibiotics.  
• There are no restrictions on the concomitant use of corticosteroids. 
For subjects in the Treatment Cohort, information on bronchodilator use during the study wi ll be 
collected and documented. 
Subjects who are using a bronchodilator must have their spi[INVESTIGATOR_155393] 11.7.1. 
9.5 Removal of Subjects (Treatment Cohort ) 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request. Subjects may be 
withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Vertex for safety, behavior, noncompliance with study procedures, or administrative reasons. If a subject has been withdrawn from study drug treatment, the subject will continue to be followed, provided the subject has not withdrawn consent.  
Subjects who discontinue study treatment early should continue to return for study assessments 
at the Early Treatment Termination Visit and/or the Safety Follow -up Visit, as noted in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact [CONTACT_423]. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject outcome. The investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return al l 
unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for a Safety Follow- up Visit, if 
applicable (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), and follow up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs.

AM: morning; IVA: ivacaftor; PM: evening.  
Treatment Cohort  
Study drug should be administered within [ADDRESS_452773] CF high -fat, high-calorie meal or snack, according to the following guidelines: 
1. Study drug should be administered q12h (± 2 hours). For each subject, all doses (morning 
and evening) of study drugs will be taken at approximately the same time each day. For example, the morning dose could be taken at 08:00 every morning and the evening dose could be taken at 20:[ADDRESS_452774]'s scheduled visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines must be used for administering either the morning or evening dose: 
• If the dose in the clinic will be within [ADDRESS_452775]'s scheduled morning dose, 
the subject should withhold their morning dose of study drug, and the morning dose will 
be administered in the clinic.  

Protocol VX14- 661-110, Version 3.4 IRE, ESP, ISR, US Page 37 of 75 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • If the dose in the clinic will be more than [ADDRESS_452776]'s scheduled morning 
dose, the subject should take the morning dose at home, and the evening dose will be 
administered in the clinic. In this event, all assessments will be collected relative to the evening dose. 
4. For visits after the Day  1 Visit, subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused study 
drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at each visit, as appr opriate. 
5. At the Week [ADDRESS_452777] dose of study drug will be the evening dose administered the day before the Week 96 Visit. 
Treatment Cohort Only:  
The date, amount taken, and time of study drug administration, including whether food was taken with each dose, will be recorded for 2 days before PK sample collection and on the days of PK sample collection.  
10.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
This is an open- label study. Randomization  is not required because all subjects will be treated 
identically in the Treatment Cohort.  
Subjects in the Observational Cohort will not receive study drug.  
10.4 Dose Modification for U se With Concomitant CYP3A Inhibitors  
(Treatment Cohort ) 
The dosage of VX-661/ivacaftor can be altered only when co -administered with moderate or 
strong inhibitors of CYP3A.

The dosage of VX-661/ivacaftor cannot be otherwise altered, but the investigator can interrupt or 
stop treatment ( Sections 10.5 and 10.6).  
10.5 Study Drug Interruption (Treatment Cohort)  
If study drug dosing must be interrupted for more than [ADDRESS_452779] should take 
his/her dose with food. If more than [ADDRESS_452780] elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the subject should skip that dose and resume his/her normal schedule for the following dose. For example, 
• if the morning dose of study drug should have been taken at approximately 08:00, and the 
subject remembers at 12:00 that he/she forgot to take his/her dose, he/she should take the 
dose with food as soon as possible. 
• if the morning dose of study drug should have been taken at approximately 08:00, and more 
than [ADDRESS_452781] elapsed beyond the scheduled dosing time (i.e., the time is past 14:00), the 
subject would resume dosing with the evening dose at approximately 20:00. 
10.6 Discontinuation of Study Participation (T reatment Cohort )  
If after review of a marketing application, local health authorities decline to approve, or if clinical benefit is not demonstrated for the use of VX-661 in combination with ivacaftor for the 
treatment of CF in populations enrolled in Study VX14-661-110, subjects with the relevant 
CFTR genotypes may be discontinued after communication to investigators and IRBs/IECs of the risks/benefits related to the safety and efficacy observed for the subset of subjects. In 
addition, if evaluation of efficacy data from the Phase 3 studies suggests that the VX-661/ivacaftor treatment does not provide clinically meaningful benefit for a population enrolled in Study VX14 -661-110, Vertex may recommend that subjects with relevant CFTR 
genotypes discontinue from the Treatment Cohort of the study. 
Subjects who become eligible to receive commercially -available VX -661/ivacaftor by 
[CONTACT_168793] a physician may be discontinued from this rollover study at the discretion of the 
sponsor. If a subject is continuing onto commercially available VX-661/ivacaftor, the Early Treatment Termination Visit (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) will be completed before dosing with commercial 
drug begins, and the Safety Follow- up Visit (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) will not be required. 
Subjects may be discontinued from the Treatment Cohort  at any time due to safety reasons. If a 
cataract or lens opacity is identified and determined to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_139389], the subject will be notified. After discussion with the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_363512], the subject may elect to 
continue or discontinue the study. If the subject discontinues study drug, they should complete the Early Treatment Termination Visit and Safety Follow -up Visit (see  Section [IP_ADDRESS] for Early 
Treatment Termination). If the subject continues, more frequent ophthalmologic monitoring should be considered.

11.8 Safety  
Safety evaluations will include AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, clinical evaluation of vital 
signs, ECGs, pulse oximetry, ophthalmologic examinations ( subjects <18  years of a ge [age on 
the date of informed consent/assent in the parent study] ), and PEs. 
11.8.1  Adverse Events (Treatment Cohort ) 
All AEs will be assessed, documented, and reported in accordance with ICH GCP guidelines. Section 13.1 outlines the definitions, collection periods, criteria, and procedures for 
documenting, grading, and reporting AEs. A separate document that details AE eCRF completion guidelines for inve stigators as well as training will be provided.  
11.8.2  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  (Treatment Cohort)  
Blood and urine samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory. With the exception of Day 15 (when a lipid panel is not required), all blood samples will r equire a [ADDRESS_452791] before collection 
(at least a [ADDRESS_452792] is needed for the lipid panel). Fasting is not required at other time points 
unless specified in the assessment table. On Day  1/Returning Visit, blood samples will be 
collected before the first  dose of the study drug. At all other scheduled visits, these samples will 
be collected at any time during the visit. Although blood samples are to be collected and 
analyzed at a central laboratory, a local laboratory may be used if a subject cannot return  to the 
clinical study site for the mandatory liver function testing (Section 11.8.6). All urine pregnancy 
tests will be performed at the site.  
Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory assessments will be collected as shown in 
Table 3-1.  Laboratory test results that are abnormal and considered clinically significant will be 
reported as AEs (see Section  13.1.1).

The safety laboratory test panels are shown in  Table 11-1. 
Pregnancy (β -human chorionic gonadotropin) testing for female subjects who are of childbearing 
potential from the time of the Day  1 Visit or at any point through the Safety Follow- up Visit (as 
defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]): Serum samples will be obtained as specified and analyzed at the 
central laboratory. Urine samples will be obtained as specified and all urine pregnancy tests will 
be performed at the site.  The urine pregnancy test on Day  1 (and the Returning Visit for 
subjects who re- enroll) must be negative before the first dose of study drug.  
Additional evaluations: Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged to be clinically appropriate.  
For purposes of study conduct, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. At the discretion of the local investigator, local laboratories may be used for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it should be verified by [CONTACT_94295]. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen 

Protocol VX14- 661-110, Version 3.4 IRE, ESP, ISR, US Page 47 of 75 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   to the central laboratory (e.g.,  the subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94248]), the investigator may base 
the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value. 
11.8.3  Physical Examinations and Vital Signs  (Treatment Cohort)  
A PE of all body systems and vital signs assessment will be performed at Day  [ADDRESS_452794] study 
visits. At other visits, symptom-directed PEs and symptom- directed vital sign assessments can be 
performed at th e discretion of the investigator or healthcare provider . 
A PE includes a review of the following systems: head/neck/thyroid; eyes/ears/nose/throat 
(EENT); respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indicated. Any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examinations will be reported as AEs. 
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature (oral), p ulse rate, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]. These will be assessed following a [ADDRESS_452795] in the seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. 
11.8.4  Electrocardiograms  (Treatment C ohort ) 
Standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the Schedule of Ass essments (Table 3-1 ). Additional standard 12- lead ECGs will be performed at 
any other time if clinically indicated. A window of ±  15 minutes will be allowed around the 
nominal times for all postdose ECG assessments.  
The performance of all ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines: 
• The subject will be instructed to rest in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5  minutes before 
having an ECG performed. 
• The ECG will be performed before any other procedures that may affect heart rate, such as 
blood draws. 
The ECG traces will be manually read at the study site at the Day  1 and Safety Follow-up Visits. 
A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by [CONTACT_168795]. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study 
through the Safety Follow- up Visit will be recorded as AEs.   
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the s tudy site will make comparisons to 
baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >45  msec from the baseline or an absolute 
QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs will be performed approximately 2  to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF 
values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>45 msec from baseline or ≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2  successive 
ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement.  
If the QTcF value remains above the threshold value (>45 msec from the average of the 3 predose values on Day 1 or ≥500 msec) on repeated measurement or is noted on >[ADDRESS_452796] their QTc monitored clos ely until 
it normalizes or returns to baseline.  

Protocol VX14- 661-110, Version 3.4 IRE, ESP, ISR, US Page 48 of 75 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Further details pertaining to ECGs will be provided to sites in a separate document (ECG 
Manual). 
11.8.5  Pulse Oximetry  (Treatment Cohort ) 
Arterial oxygen saturation by [CONTACT_363543] d in Table 3-1. This 
will be assessed following a [ADDRESS_452797] (seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) and before study drug dosing. At 
visits when study drug is taken at the site, pulse oximetry will be collected before the morning dose. This is a noninvasive measure of oxygen delivery to the tissues and has been correlated with clinical status and lung function.  
11.8.[ADDRESS_452798] Parameters (Treatment Cohort)  
Liver Fun ction Testing  
Liver function testing (ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, direct bilirubin, and total bilirubin) must be performed as noted for serum chemistry, while subjects are receiving study drug treatment and at the Early Treatment Termination Visit and the Safety F ollow-up Visit. These blood samples 
should be processed and shipped immediately per the Laboratory Manual. 
Subjects with new treatment -emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3  × ULN and clinical 
symptoms must be followed closely, including repeat confirmatory testing performed by [CONTACT_315452] [ADDRESS_452799] is >5 × ULN, repeat follow-up levels must be obtained within 7 ± [ADDRESS_452800] the tests repeated and  sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible 
(ideally within 48 to 72 hours). 
Study Drug Interruption  
Study drug administration must be interrupted immediately (prior to confirmatory testing), and 
the medical monitor must be notified, if any of the following criteria is met: 
• ALT or AST >8  × ULN 
• ALT or AST >5  × ULN for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST >3  × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2  × ULN and/or clinical jaundice 
A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be followed closely for clinical progression. 
If no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, or alcohol 
ingestion) for the confirmed elevated transaminases is identified, regardless of whether ALT or AST levels have improved, study drug treatment must be permanently discontinued if repeat testing within [ADDRESS_452801] their transaminases monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline. 
Resumption of Study Drug 

Protocol VX14- 661-110, Version 3.4 IRE, ESP, ISR, US Page 49 of 75 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation has been id entified, study drug may 
be resumed once transaminases return to baseline or are ≤2 × ULN, whichever is higher. 
Approval of the medical monitor is required before resumption of study drug. Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases should be assessed wee kly for 4 weeks. If a protocol-defined 
transaminase elevation occurs within 4  weeks of rechallenge with the study drug (with 
confirmation of the initial elevation by [CONTACT_94525] 48 to 72 hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless of the presumed etiology. 
11.8.7  Ophthalmologic Examination (Treatment Cohort)  
Subjects <18  years of age (age on the date of informed consent/assent in the parent study) will 
undergo a baseline ophthalmologic examination performed by a licensed opht halmologist within 
28 days before enrollment on Day 1 of Study VX14 -661-110, which includes: 
• measurement of best corrected distance visual acuity of each eye,  
• measurement of lens refracting power following cycloplegia (e.g., autorefractor or 
ophthalmoscopy streak), and 
• pharmacologically dilated examination of the lens with a slit lamp.  
The baseline ophthalmologic examination must be completed and the results reviewed before 
enrollment. This examination may be conducted while the subject is participating in the parent 
study.  
If a cataract or lens opacity is identified and determined to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_363544], the subject will be notified. After discussion with the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_363525], the subject may elect to participate or not to participate in the study. If the subject elects to participate, more frequent ophthalmologic monitoring should be considered. 
Subjects who are enrolled in the Treatment Cohort will have ophthalmologic exams as noted in 
Table 3-1. If a cataract or lens opacity is identified and determined to be clinically significant by 
[CONTACT_139389], the subject will be notified. After discussion with the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_363525], the subject may elect to continue or discontinue the study. If the subject discontinues study drug, they should complete the Early Treatment Termination Visit and Safety Follow -up Visit ( Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS]). 
If the subject continues, more frequent ophthalmologic monitoring should be considered. 
In addition to the baseline examination, an ophthalmologic examination will be performed by a 
licensed ophthalmologist at the Early Treatment Termination  or Safety Follow- Up Visit for 
subjects < 18 years of age (age on the date of informed  consent/assent in the parent study) who 
discontinue treatment after receiving at least [ADDRESS_452802] be 
completed by [CONTACT_363531]- Up Visit.  
In addition, on Day 1 of Study VX14-661-110, the following history will be obtained for all 
subjects, if it was not documented in the parent study: 
• history of steroid use 
• history or presence of diabetes 

Protocol VX14- 661-110, Version 3.4 IRE, ESP, ISR, US Page 50 of 75 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • any prior ophthalmologic or optometric examinations  
• history of trauma to the eye 
• any family history of glaucoma, congenital cataracts, or cataracts arising later in life  
• use of corrective lenses (contact [CONTACT_139390])  
• history of prolonged exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light and use of sunglasses 
• history of exposure to secondhand smoke. 
11.8.8  Contraception and Pregnancy  (Treatment Cohort ) 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Contraception 
Participation in this study requires a commitment from the subject and his/her partner to use at 
least [ADDRESS_452803] dose of study drug (unless otherwise noted) and until [ADDRESS_452804] dose of study drug.  
For female subjects using oral hormonal contracept ives: 
1. The oral hormonal contraceptives should be in successful use from at least [ADDRESS_452805] dose of study drug (unless otherwise noted) and until [ADDRESS_452806] 60 days  
after beginning oral contraceptives . 
Contraception  for the couple is waived for the following:  
• True abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,  calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
• If the male is infertile (e.g.,  bilateral orchiectomy). Infertility may be documented through 
examination of a semen specimen or by [CONTACT_94299]. 
• If the female is of non -childbearing potential, per the following: 
o Documented hysterectomy or a bilateral oophorectomy/salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936]-oophorectomy. 
o Postmenopausal: continuous amenorrhea for at least 12 months and serum FSH levels ≥ 40 mIU/mL.  
o Has not achieved menarche (has not had her first menstrual period). If a female achieves menarche during the study, she will need to follow acceptable methods of contraception or abstinence.  
For subjects for whom contraception methods are not waived due to at least 1  of the reasons 
cited above, the following are acceptable contraceptive methods for male subjects and their female (non -study) partners, and for female subjects and their male (non- study) partners:  

Protocol VX14- 661-110, Version 3.4 IRE, ESP, ISR, US Page 51 of 75 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Table 11-2 Acceptable Methods of Contraception  
• Male vasectomy [ADDRESS_452807] -vasectomy semen analysis for 
sperm. 
• Male or female condom with or without spermicide (either as a single product if commercially available and/or as 
allowed according to local regulations ; otherwise condom and spermicide as separate products).  
• Female bilateral tubal ligation performed at least 6 months previously.  
• Female diaphragm, cervical cap, or vaginal sponge, each with spermicide (where available). 
• Female continuous use of an intrauterine device (non -hormone releasing or hormone releasing) for at least [ADDRESS_452808] dose of study drug 
• Female combined (estrogen and progestogen -containing) or progestogen -only oral hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation if successfully used for at least [ADDRESS_452809] 60 days after beginning hormonal contraception . 
 
Important notes:  
• Local requirements may prohibit the use of some of these acceptable methods listed above. 
Please contact [CONTACT_64168]. 
• If applicable, additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according to local regulations and/or requirements. 
• Male and female subjects who are not sexually active at the time of screening must agree to follow the contraceptive requirements of this study if they become sexually active.  
• Female condom used with male condom (as a double method of contraception) is not an acceptable method of contraception due to risk of tearing; a different acceptable method of 
birth control must be used as described in Table 11-2.  
• Male subjects must not donate sperm after the first dose of study drug, throughout the study, 
and for [ADDRESS_452810] dose of study drug. 
• Female subjects and female partners of male subjects should not plan to become pregnant 
during the study through [ADDRESS_452811] dose of study drug. 
• Female subjects should not nurse a child from the start of study drug dosing through [ADDRESS_452812] dose of study drug. 
Other situations that do not fall within the above specifications may be discussed with the Vertex 
medical monitor on an individual basis. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy  
Subjects will be counseled to inform the investigator of any pregnancy that occurs during study treatment and within [ADDRESS_452813] be permanently discontinued immediately. For male subjects, study drug does not need to be permanently discontinued if the female partner's pregnancy resulted from donated sperm or sperm banked before study drug exposure (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) . The 
investigator must notify the medical monitor and Vertex GPS within 24  hours of the site's 
knowledge of the subject's (or partner's) pregnancy using the Pregnancy Information Collection Form. 

Protocol VX14- 661-110, Version 3.[ADDRESS_452814] or partner will be followed until the 
end of the pregnancy and the infant will be followed for 1 year after the birth, provided informed consent/assent is obtained. A separate ICF will be provided to explain these follow- up activities. 
Pregnancy itself does not const itute an AE.  
12 STATISTICAL AND ANAL YTICAL PLANS  
This section presents a summary of the planned analyses for the Treatment Cohort in this protocol. Statistical analysis details for the Treatment Cohort will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) w ill be finalized before the clinical data lock for the study.  
No analysis will be performed for the Observational Cohort.  
12.1 Sample Size and Power  
Study VX14 -661-110 is a rollover study that plans to enroll subjects from 
Studies VX13 -661-103, VX14-661-106, V X14-661-108, VX14-661-109, VX14-661-111, and 
other eligible Vertex studies investigating VX -661 in combination with ivacaftor who meet the 
eligibility criteria for this study. Approximately up to 1375  subjects are potentially eligible to be 
enrolled from the following parent studies: 40 subjects from Study VX13-661-103, 490 subjects 
from Study  VX14-661-106, up to 300 subjects from Study  VX14-661-108, up to 200 subjects 
from Study  VX14-661-109, and 45 subjects from Study VX14-661-111, if eligible.  
12.2 Analysis Sets  
For subjects in the Treatment Cohort, the assignment to analysis sets will be done before the clinical data lock for the study.  
The All Subjects Set is defined as all subjects who signed inform consent (enrolled) and have received at least [ADDRESS_452815] listings and disposition summary tables unless otherwise specified.  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is defined as all enrolled subjects who have received at least [ADDRESS_452816] one of the following mutations: 
F508del/F508del , F508del/Residual function, and F508del/Gating. The FAS is to be used in the 
efficacy analyses unless otherwise specified .  
The Safety Set is defined as all subjects who received at least 1  dose of study drug in 
Study VX14-661-110. The Safety Set is to be used for the safety analyses unless otherwise 
specified.  
12.3 Statistical Analysis  
12.3.1  General Considerations  
Continuous variables  will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: 
the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value 
(max). 
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages.  
Baseline value , unless otherwise specified, for efficacy and safety analyses , will be defined as 
the most recent non- missing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first 
dose of VX-661/ivacaftor or ivacaftor alone (in the parent study or Study VX14-661-110, but 

Protocol VX14- 661-110, Version 3.4 IRE, ESP, ISR, US Page 53 of 75 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   after the washout period, if applicable) . For subjects who received VX-661 and ivacaftor 
combination therapy in the parent study, the baseline will be the same as the baseline in the 
parent study. For subjects who received placebo or ivacaftor in the parent study and transitioned to VX-661/ivacaftor in Study VX14 -661-110, the baseline will be the baseline in Study 
VX14-661-110. For subjects from Study VX14-661-108, the parent study baseline will be the 
baseline for Treatment Period 2 in Study VX14 -661-108. For subjects from 
Study VX13-661-103, the parent study baseline will be the baseline in the Open- label Phase of 
Study VX13-661-103 for subjects who participated in the Open- label Phase or the baseline in 
Study VX14-661-110 for subjects who did not participate in the Open -label Phase of Study 
VX13-661-103.  
Change (absolute change) from baseline  will be calculated as postbaseline value - baseline 
value. 
Relative change from baseline will be calculated as (postbaseline value - baseline 
value)/baseline value.  
Efficacy Analysis Period will include the time from the first dose of VX -661/ivacaftor or 
ivacaftor alone (in the parent study or Study VX14 -661-110, but after the washout period, if 
applicable) to the last scheduled efficacy visit in Part of Study VX14 -661-110. For subjects who 
participate in another qualified Vertex study before completing Study VX14 -661-[ADDRESS_452817] 
dose after re-enrollment in Study VX14-661-110.  
Treatment -emergent (TE) Period will include the time f rom the first active dose of 
VX-661/ivacaftor or ivacaftor alone (in the parent study or Study VX14-661-110, but after the 
washout period, if applicable) to the Safety Follow-up Visit or [ADDRESS_452818] dose of Study VX14 -661-110. For subjects who 
participate in another qualified Vertex study before completing Study VX14 -661-110 (96 weeks) 
and re-enroll in Study VX14 -661-110, the TE Period will exclude the time spent in the other 
study. Specifically,  the TE Period will be interrupted [ADDRESS_452819] dose of VX -661/ivacaftor or 
ivacaftor monotherapy in the Treatment Period [ADDRESS_452820] 
active dose of study drug in the Open -label Phase of Study  VX13-661-103. 
12.3.2  Overview of Analysis Strategies  
• Study VX14-661-[ADDRESS_452821] active dose of VX-661/ivacaftor or ivacaftor alone ( after the washout period, if applicable).  
• The analysis baseline will be the last non -missing measurement prior to the first active dose 
of VX-661/ivacaftor or ivacaftor alone [in the parent study (after the washout period, if 

Protocol VX14- 661-110, Version 3.4 IRE, ESP, ISR, US Page 54 of 75 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   applicable) or Study  VX14-661-110]. All post- baseline measurements will be mapped to the 
uniform analysis visit windows based on the study days counted from the first active dose of 
VX-661/ivacaftor or ivacaftor alone (after the washout period in the parent study, if 
applicable) to ma ke the results more comparable and interpre table.  
• For subjects in Study VX14-661-110, the safety analyses will be performed on all of the 
subjects pooled together. The efficacy analysis will be performed on each CFTR mutation group separately  (F508del/F508del, F508del/Residual Function, and F508del/Gating).

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   [IP_ADDRESS]  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All summaries in this section will be performed on all subjects pooled together based on the 
Safety Set, unless otherwise specified in the SAP. No statistical hypothesis testing will be 
performed.  
Medications used in this study will be coded by [CONTACT_363545] -Drug 
Dictionary Enhanced and categorized as the following:  
• Prior medication:  any medication that started before the first active dose of study drug (in 
the parent study or in Study VX14-661-110, after the washout period, if applicable), 
regardless of when it ended. In addition, for subjects who participate in another qualified Vertex study before completing Study VX14 -661-110 assessments and re-enroll in 
Study VX14-661-110, any medication that was collected with a start date after the informed 
consent/assent for re-enrollment is signed and before the first dose of VX-661/ivacaftor after 
re-enrollment in Study VX14 -661-110 will also be considered as prior medication, regardless 
of when medication was discontinued. 
• Concomitant medication:  medication continued or newly received at, or after, initial dosing 
of study drug through the end of the TE Period. 
• Post-treatment medication:  medication continued or newly received beyond the TE Period. 
A given medication can be classified as a prior medication, a concomitant medication, or a post-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post- treatment; or 
prior, concomitant, and post- treatment. If a medication has a missing or partial missing start/end 
date or time and it cannot be determined whether it was taken before initial dosing, concomitantly, or beyond the TE Period, it will be considered as prior, concomitant, and post-treatment.  
Concomitant medications will be summarized descriptively for the Safety Set by: 1) preferred name; and 2) anatomic class (ATC) level 1, ATC level 2, and preferred name.  
The medications (prior, concomitant, post- treatment) will be listed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Exposure and Compliance  
All summaries in this section will be performed on all subjects pooled together based on the 
Safety Set, and performed on  each CFTR mutation group separately  (F508del/F508del , 
F508del/Residual Function, and F508del/Gating ) based on the FAS, unless otherwise specified 
in the SAP. No statistical hypothesis testing will be performed.  
Treatment Cohort  
Exposure to study drug (i.e., duration of treatment) will be summarized for the FAS in terms of duration of treatment a subject received (in days), defined as the last day minus the first day of dosing with VX-661/ivacaftor or ivacaftor monotherapy in the parent study (but after the washout period, if applicable) or VX-661/ivacaftor in Study VX14 -661-110, plus 1.  
Dosing compliance will be summarized for the FAS and is calculated as the actual number of days at which study drug was administered, as a percen tage of the duration of study drug 
exposure.

12.3.4  Efficacy Analysis  
Treatment Cohort  
Assessment of the long- term efficacy and tolerability  of VX-661 /ivacaftor for subjects in the 
Treatment Cohort is a secondary or other objective of this study. The efficacy analysis will be 
performed on each CFTR mutation group separately ( F508del/F508del, F508del/Residual 
function, and F508del/Gating). All data collected  during the efficacy analysis period through the 
end of Study VX14 -661-110 will be summarized.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of Primary Efficacy Variables  
Not applicable since efficacy is not a primary objective.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of Secondary   Efficacy Variables (Treatment 
Cohort)  
• Absolute change from baseline in ppFEV [ADDRESS_452823] repeated -measure 
model (MMRM), as applicable. The model will include the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV
1 as the dependent variable; treatment group, visit, and treatment- by-visit interaction as 
fixed effects; and subject as a random effect with or without adjustment for sex, age, baseline ppFEV
1. 
In the model, visit will be treated as a class variable, assuming an unstructured covariance matrix 
to model the within -subject variability. This model imposes no assumptions on the correlational 
structure and is considered robust. Denominator degrees of freedom for the F  test for fixed 
effects will be estimated using the Kenward -Roger approximation. If there is a convergence 
problem due to the use of an unstructured covariance matrix, a compound symmetry covariance structure will be used to model the within- subject errors. With a mixed -effects model based on a 
restricted maximum likelihood estimation used for the primary analysis and assuming that, conditional on fixed and random effects, data are missing at random, no imputation of missing data will be p erformed.  
Descriptive summary statistics including number of subjects, mean, standard error, and least square mean (LS mean), along with the associated 95% CI will be provided for each visit. 
• Relative change from baseline in ppFEV
1  
Analysis of this variable will be performed using the same MMRM model as described for the 
absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1. 
• Number of pulmonary exacerbations  
The number of pulmonary exacerbations will be analyzed using a negative binomial regression 
model as applicable. The independent variables will include visit, sex, age, baseline ppFEV 1. The 
event rate and 95% CI will be reported.

Analysis of this variable will be similar to the model as described for the ab solute change in 
ppFEV 1 from baseline, with the addition of baseline BMI as the covariate. 
• Absolute change from baseline in BMI z- score 
Analysis of this variable will be similar to the model as described for the absolute change in 
ppFEV 1 from baseline, with the addition of the BMI z- score at baseline as a covariate for 
subjects <20 years old at the time of the Screening Visit in the parent study. 
• Absolute change from baseline in CFQ -R respi[INVESTIGATOR_363526] 1 from baseline, with the addition of the CFQ- R respi[INVESTIGATOR_363527].  
• Absolute change from baseline in body weight  
Analysis for this variable will b e similar to the model as described for the absolute change in 
ppFEV 1 from baseline, with the addition of the body weight at baseline as a covariate. 
• Absolute change from baseline in body weight z -score for subjects aged <20 years at 
screening in the paren t study 
Analysis of this variable will be similar to the model as described for the absolute change in 
ppFEV 1 from baseline, with the addition of the body weight z- score at baseline as a covariate for 
subjects <20 years old at the time of the Screening Vis it in the parent study.  
• Absolute change from baseline in height z -score for subjects aged <20 years at 
screening in the parent study  
Analysis of this variable will be similar to the model as described for the absolute change in 
ppFEV 1 from baseline, with the addition of the height z- score at baseline as a covariate for 
subjects <20 years old at the time of the Screening Visit in the parent study. • Time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation 
Time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation is defined as days starting from the first dose of VX-[ADDRESS_452824] 
without exacerbation before the end of the Efficacy Analysis Period of Study VX14 -661-110 
will be considered censored at the end of the Efficacy Analysis Period. Kaplan -Meier method 
will be used to produce graphical presentation of the survival distribution (exacerbation- free 
survival) and to estimate cumulative survival rates by [CONTACT_363547].

lute change in Brody/CF -CT scores from baseline using LDCT scans for subjects 
enrolling from Study VX15-661-112 
Only applicable for the subjects enrolling from Study VX15-661-112. The absolute values and 
changes from baseline of the Total Brody/CF -CT scores  will be summarized 
descriptively.  
12.3.5  Safety Analysis (Treatment Cohort)  
Evaluating the long- term safety and tolerability of VX -661 in combination with ivacaftor 
treatment in the Treatment Cohort is the primary objective of this study. All safety analyses will be based on TE Period for subjects in the Safety Set.  
The overall safety profile of the combination treatment will be assessed in terms of the following 
safety and tolerability endpoints: 
• Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), SAEs, TEAEs leading to treatment 
discontinuations, TEAEs leading to treatment interruptions, deaths.  
• Clinical laboratory results (i.e., hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation studies, vitamin 
levels, lipid panel, and urinalysis) 
• Standard 12- lead ECGs  
• Vital signs  
• Pulse oximetry  
• Pregnancy test  
Descriptive analysis of safety will be performed  for subjects in the Safety Set of 
Study VX14-661-110.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events 
For analysis purposes, AEs will be classified as pretreatment AEs, TEAEs, or post- treatment 
AEs.  
• Pretreatment AE:  any AE that increased in severity or newly developed before the first 
active dose of VX -661/ivacaftor or ivacaftor alone in the TE Period. For subj ects who 
participate in another qualified Vertex study before completing Study VX14 -661-[ADDRESS_452825] dose of VX-661/ivacaftor in the TE Period, and

VX14-661-110. 
• TEAE: any AE that increased in severity or began at , or after, the first active dose of 
VX-661/ivacaftor or ivacaftor alone in the TE Period.  
• Post-treatment AE: any AE that increased in severity or began beyond the TE Period. 
For AEs with missing or partial start dates, if there is no clear evidence that the AEs started 
before or after study treatment, then the AEs will be classified as TEAEs.  
An overview of AEs table will include the following.

Protocol VX14- 661-110, Version 3.[ADDRESS_452827]/highest relationship level in the relationship summaries. An AE overview table will be 
provided. A separate table will summarize all TEAEs when each of them is considered unique, hereafter referred to as an AE count table. In addition, a listing containing individual subject AE data for all deaths and other serious and significant AEs will be provided separately. All AEs, including pre- and post- treatment AEs, will be presented in individual subject data listings.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
For the treatment -emergent laboratory measurements, the raw values and change from baseline 
values of the continuous laboratory parameters will be summarized in SI units at each scheduled time point during the TE Period. Mean value at each visit will be plotted for each of the liver function parameters.  In addition, a listing containing individual subject laboratory assessment 
values outside the reference ranges will be provided. 
The number and percentage of subjects with at least 1 threshold analysis event during the 
TE Period will be summarized for selected laboratory parameters. The shift of the threshold analysis criteria from baseline to postbaseline will also be summarized for selected laboratory parameters. The threshold analysis and parameter -selection crite ria will be provided in the SAP.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Interim Analysis  
Interim analyses may occur at any time during the study as determined by [CONTACT_139383]. During any 
interim analysis time, if any parent study is still not completely unblinded to the relevant study personnel, the analysis will be performed accordi ng to the relevant unblinding plans. In general, 
Vertex Biometrics will use blinded data to program tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) based on the relevant SAP for the interim analysis. An independent biometrics team (internal or external as defined in the Unblinding Plan) will then rely on the programs to prepare unblinded TFLs using unblinded data. The details of the unblinding process will be provided in the Unblinding Plan. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  DMC Analysis  
A DMC (Data Monitoring Committee) will be formed . The DMC’s objectives and operational 
details will be defined in a separate document (the DMC Charter). The DMC will conduct regular planned safety reviews of study data as outlined in the DMC Charter.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Data Monitoring 
Vertex will continuously monitor unblinded safety data. If in the course of evaluating safety events from other blinded studies, data from the open- label study may be shared with an external 
data monitoring committee in order to better understand any potential safety signals.  
12.4 Clinical Pharmacology Analy sis  
12.4.1  Pharmacokinetic Analysis (Treatment Cohort)  
A detailed description of the clinical pharmacology analyses will be provided in the CPAP. 
Listings of plasma concentration data of VX -661, ivacaftor, and their metabolites will be 
provided in the clinical study report. A population approach may be used to analyze the time-versus-plasma concentration data of VX-661, ivacaftor, and their metabolites. The 
PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship between concentrations of VX-661 and ivacaftor (and their metabolites as appropriate) and efficacy and safety measurements may be investigated. The 
results of the PK and PK/PD analyses using a population approach will be presented in a separate report, if applicable.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATORY, AND ADMI NISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting 
13.1.1  Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event does not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a preexisting condition (e.g., increase in its severity or frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinically Significant Assessments 
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs, will be assessed and 
those deemed a clinically significant worsening from baseline documented as an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the  absence of a diagnosis, the 
abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased hemoglobin). 
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more of 
the following: 
• Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment 
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
• A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study 
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by [CONTACT_093].  
A laboratory value that is Grade [ADDRESS_452828] indicates a life -threatening AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Documentation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected from the time ICF is signed, or assent, if applicable, until the following time points:  
• Until time of withdrawal of consent  
• For enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follow-up Visit: through the Safety Follow-up Visit 
• For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow-up Visit, the earliest  of: 
o [ADDRESS_452829] dose of study drug (see  Section [IP_ADDRESS]) , or 

Protocol VX14- 661-110, Version 3.4 IRE, ESP, ISR, US Page 63 of 75 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   o the Early Treatment Termination Visit, or until the time of enrollment in another 
qualified Vertex study  
All subjects will be queried, using non-leading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 
1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the eCRF and source document. The following data will be documented for each AE: 
• Description of the event 
• Classification of “serious” or “nonserious” 
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) 
• Severity 
• Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and non-serious AEs. The 
guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed August 
2012). AEs of CTCAE Grades  4 and 5 will be documented as “life-thr eatening.” In considering 
the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those given in the CTCAE.  
The severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definitions in Table 13-1.  
Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity  
Classification  Definition  
Mild (Grade  1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities  
Moderate (Grade  2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities  
Severe (Grade  3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening (Grade  4) Any adverse drug experience that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, 
at immediate risk of death  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to the study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in  Table 13-2.  

Protocol VX14- 661-110, Version 3.[ADDRESS_452830] been ruled out, 
and/or the event re -appeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly rel ated There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such 
as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject's medical record).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the A E. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3.  
Table 13-[ADDRESS_452831] to an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to contin ue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Outcome 
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-4. 
Table 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/Resolved  Resolution of an  AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/Resolved With 
Sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not Recovered/Not 
Resolved (Continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing 
Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g., a subject lost to follow -up) 

Protocol VX14- 661-110, Version 3.4 IRE, ESP, ISR, US Page 65 of 75 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE. 
13.1.2  Serious Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes: 
• Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after 
participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of 
the study drug) 
• Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home)  
If a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139355], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155409], unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139357]. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94253] (e.g., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]) will not be considered to indicate an SAE. 
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and "severe,” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significa nce, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.

to ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject's eCRF. Source documentation supporting the eCRF data will indicate the subject's participation in the study and will document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs, other observations, and subject status. 
The investigator, or designated representative, will complete the eCRF as soon as possible after 
information is collected.  
The audit trail entry will show the user's identification information and the date and time of any 
correction. The investigator will provide formal approval of all the information in the eCRFs, including any changes made to the eCRFs, to endorse the final submitted data for the subjects for whom the investigator is responsible.  
Vertex will retain the eCRF data  and corresponding audit tr ails. A copy of the final archival 
eCRF in the form of a CD or other electronic media will be placed in the investigator's study file.

 1 Background and Rationale  
1.1 Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39053] (ARDS)  
  Acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) is a n acute , life -threatening form  of    
  respi[INVESTIGATOR_96996]-exchange, decreased compliance and fluid accumulation in the airspaces .  
  Excessive inflammation is a major con tributor to lung injury in ARDS leading to   
  activation of the complement system by [CONTACT_97024] -infla mmatory cytokines such as TNF, IL -1, IL-6, and IL-17, as well as  
               multiple chemokines such as IL -8, CCL -2, and CCL -7 [1]. This leads to the accumulation  
  of neutrophils and monocytes to the site of injury where they  release toxic substances   
  that damage the capi[INVESTIGATOR_96997] [1]. The ensuing   
  cytokine storm  leads to systemic inflammatory response, septic shock, and multi -organ   
  failure [2, 3].  Multiple etiologies may trigger ARDS, including respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073],   
  sepsis/shock, trauma, pancreatitis, smoke inhalation, hematopoietic stem cell   
  transplant, and transfusion- related acute lung injury.   
 
  ARDS is currently diagnosed based  on the Berlin Definition of ARDS published in   
  2012 based on expert consensus  [4].  It is clinically manifested by  [CONTACT_97025][INVESTIGATOR_1401] ( PaO2/FIO2 ), along with bilateral opacities on  
  chest imaging.   ARDS is divided into 3 groups based on the degree of hypoxemia: mild  
  (PaO2/FIO2 201 -300 mm Hg), moderate ( PaO2/FIO2: 101- 200 mm Hg), and severe  
  (PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 100 mm Hg)  and ventilator settings  with a positive end -expi[INVESTIGATOR_96998] (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ≥5 cm H 2O.  The  
  mortality rate has been reported to be up to 50%, with increasing severity of ARDS   
  leading to higher likelihood of mortality  [5]. To date, no pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_96999], and t he primary  treatment   
  relies on  treating underlying causes  and supportive measures  such as mechanical  
  ventilation and fluid management [1].  Thus, effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_97000].  
1.2 Coro navirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) 
 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) is caused by s evere acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_97001] 2 (SARS- CoV-2), and  was first reported in Wuhan, China  in December 2019     
[6] . In January 2020, the Wo rld Health Organization (WHO)  declared the outbreak a   
 global emergency after rapid spread to multiple other countries including the United    
 States, Italy, Japan, Iran and others . The number of cases continues to increase  
exponentially with the number of cases surpassing 1, 500,000 globally by [CONTACT_11712] 10, 2020  
[7].  
 SARS- CoV2 belongs to the Coronavirus (CoV) family which also includes the severe   
acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] ( SARS- CoV) and Middle East  respi[INVESTIGATOR_97002] 4.2 (05 -25-2022)  
8 
 syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV) which led to epi[INVESTIGATOR_7509] [ADDRESS_107019] 
a higher  transmission rate  although the estimated basic reproductive number (R0) has 
been very dynamic as the number of cases continues to rise with increased testing 
availability  [8-11].  The most common clinical symptoms of COVID -19 at onset are fever, 
cough, dyspnea, myalgia, and/or fatigue  [10, 12, 13]. Less common symptoms included 
anosmia, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.  H owever, the clinical spectrum 
ranges widely from asymptomatic  or mild illness to critical illness in a subset of patients 
with progression to ARDS, shock, and/or multi -organ failure  lead ing to a case fatality 
rate variously estimated as 1% -4%.  [14].  
 
1.3  ARDS due to COVID -19 Disease  
Angiotensin converting enzyme -2 receptor (ACE -2) has been identified as a primary   
host receptor for cell entry utilized by [CONTACT_7544] -CoV-2 similar to SARS -CoV [15, 16]. ACE -[ADDRESS_107020] epi[INVESTIGATOR_24603], myocardial cells, and kidney proximal tubule cells , and high expression 
may  increase  susceptibility to  viral damage . It has been reported that approximately 
50% of patients  with COVID -19 pneumonia  will progress to ARDS  [12, 13, 17], with 
mortality approaching 50% in various studies  [10, 12, 13, 17, 18]. Risk factors for ARDS 
and increased mortality include age (older than 60 years), presence of comorbidities 
such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, COPD, immunocompromised  states , 
elevated markers of inflammation and higher disease severity as evidenced by [CONTACT_97026], SOFA, and CURB -65 scores  [10, 18-21].  At present, no effective antiviral 
treatment or vaccine is available ; however, multiple clinical trials are evaluat ing the  
safety and efficacy of pharmacologic agents .   
 
1.4   COVID -19-associated coagulopathy (CAC)  
Abnormalities in coagulation parameters have been observed in patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97003] -19 disease  [12, 19, 22, 23].  Most common are elevations in fibrinogen and 
D-dimer, which may correlate with a rise in inflammatory  markers. However, some 
patients with severe COVID- 19 disease develop classic  disseminated intravascular 
coagulopathy  (DIC) with moderate to severe thrombocytopenia , prolongation of 
PT/aPTT, elevated D -dimer, and fibrinogen less than 100 mg/dL.  Tang et al reported 
that use of low molecular weight (LMWH) or unfractionated (UFH) h eparin  was 
associated with decreased mortality in patients with severe COVID -19 disease  [
24]. 
Conversel y, progressively increasing D -dimer levels were  associated with increased 
mortality.  Based on these (and related ) findings, monitoring of platelet counts, 
PT/aPTT, D-dimer and fibrinogen levels is strongly recommended.  While the use of 
therapeutic antico agulation in patients with severe COVID- 19 disease is still under study, 
prophylactic low dose heparin  anticoagulation is recommended in the absence of active 
bleeding or other contraindications.

 1.5  Mesenchymal Stromal Cells  (MSCs ) for Inflammatory Disorders, including ARDS 
 Mesenchymal stromal cells  have shown benefit in patients with inflammatory  and 
immune -related disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease [ 25], rheumatoid 
arthritis [26], type 1 diabetes mellitus [ 27-29], systemic lupus  erythematosus  [30-33], 
multiple sclerosis  [34], and a cute graft versus host disease (a GVHD ) [35] as well as lung 
disease  [36-38]. MSCs are a cellular component of the supportive microenvironment 
that function as multipotent progenitor  cells with the capacity to differentiate into 
mesoder mal lineage s, such as adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes [39, 40]. MSCs 
also contribute to tissue repair [ 41-43]. They also have anti -inflammatory properties and 
increas e the activity of T regulatory cells, which may benefit development of immune  
tolerance [44-47].  Since MSCs do not express class II human histocompatibility antigens 
(HLA) or co -stimulatory molecules  (CD40, CD40L, CD80, and CD86) required for T cell 
activation, even allogeneic (banked) MSC appear to induce little alloreactivity  after 
administration [48, 49]. MSCs also secrete antimicrobial peptides that enhance bacterial 
clearance and improve survival [50-52]. These inherent qualities of MSCs make them a 
promising candidate for the treatment of lung injury without toxicities.  
 
Multiple preclinical studies have shown that MSCs  can be used for treat ing lung injury 
[53-55]. Chan et  al showed that human MSCs administered  to aged mice infected with 
H5N1  prevented or reduced lung injury , thereby [CONTACT_97027] . The  MSC s 
reduc ed pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased survival [56]. MSC administ ration  
similarly  reduced proinflammatory  cytokines and chemokines , and pulmonary 
inflammation in mice with H9N2 avian influenza induced lung injury [ 57].  MSCs also 
attenuate lung injury in mice and ex vivo human lungs  after injury by  [CONTACT_97028]  [51, 58]. In addition, MSCs may secrete paracrine factors that improve the 
rate of alveolar fluid clearance  [59, 60]. Based on these preclinical findings, MSCs were 
deemed to be  a promising form of adoptive cell therapy for the treatment of ARDS.  
 Several phase 1 and 2 studies evaluating the saf ety of MSCs  as treatment for a variety of 
lung diseases (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, COPD and ARDS)  have confirmed  
tolerability of this approach [ 36-38, 
61, 62].  A case report of  two patients with severe, 
refractory  ARDS treated with MSC from  allogeneic bone marrow ( 2 million cells /kg i.v.) 
had  significant improvement of  respi[INVESTIGATOR_97004] -organ failure, as well as reduction 
in inflammatory c ytokines  [63].  In a  phase 1 , dose -escalation study using bone marrow 
derived allogeneic MCSs for moderate to severe ARDS, no infusion or treatment related 
adverse events were reported in 9 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  [62]. Two patients died, but this was 
considered  unrelated to infusion of the MSCs.  Given the mortality associated with 
COVID -19 induced ARDS , Leng et  al. conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_97005] -CoV-2 pneumonia. They reported improvement in 
pulmonary function and symptoms, a nd a decrease in pr o-inflammatory cytokines such 
as TNF -α and  an increase in anti -inflammatory  IL-10 [21]. They were also able to show 
improvement, although not statistically significant, in the disease severity scores such as SOFA.   
Version 4.2 (05 -25-2022)  
[ADDRESS_107021] been safely used in numerous clinical trials , preparations of these 
cells may express Tissue Factor and therefore pose an increased thrombogenic  risk [64-
67].  Thus the general safety of bone marrow derived  MSCs [68] has been accompanied 
by [CONTACT_97029]  [65, 69-73]. MSC from these sources may express higher levels of TF  [74, 75] 
than BM der ived MSC s, potentially accounting for the observed “ instant blood -
mediated inflammatory r eactions ” (IBMIR) [76, 77].   
 
The TF expression of a dipose and placenta derived MSC shows  significant variation 
depending on donor and culture passage  [66, 70, 78, 79]. Although these thrombotic 
complications are rarely seen  after infusion of BM derived MSC s, low dose 
anticoagulation has been used preclinically and in human studies [ 72, 74, 75, 80, 81].  
These additives block activation of coagulation an d complement, decreasing the risk of 
IBIM -triggering. Thus, supplementation with anticoagulants  appears to be a simple 
method to reduce activation of coagulation pathways following MSC infusion, which 
might also enhance the therapeutic effect. Thus in an e ffort to mitigate any putative 
additional procoagulation activity following infusion of MSCS, patients with active 
COVID [ADDRESS_107022] be eligibl e for prophylaxis with LMWH/UFH.  
[ADDRESS_107023] enroll and treat six  patients with MSCs for safety run in. If no more than 
2 treatment -related severe adverse events (tSAEs) are observed, the study will enroll 
and randomize additional 60 patients in a ratio of 1:1 to receive either MSCs or routine/supportive care.  
2.2     Hypo thesis  and Specific Objectives  
2.2.1  Primary Hypothesis  
               T he primary hypothesis is that  banked, bone marrow  derived mesenchymal   
               stromal cells can be  safely used to mediate t he severe inflammatory response seen in  
               moderate or severe ARDS resulting from COVID -19 disease  compared to the control  
               group receiving routine supportive  care .

                  with local institutional and federal guidelines stating that they are aware of the  
                  investigational nature of this protocol and of the possible side effects of treatment.  
                  Further, patients must be informed that no efficacy of this therapy is guaranteed, and  
                  that unforeseen toxicities may occur. Patients have the right to withdraw from this  
                  protocol at any time. No patient will be accepted for treatment without such a  
                  do cument signed by [CONTACT_97037]. Full confidentiality of patients and   
                  patient records will be provided according to institutional guidelines.  
5.2 Registration and  Randomization    
                 All consented patients will be registered in the online collaborative research    
                 environment (Forte’s OnCore® eResearch CTMS), a Clinical Research Management  
                 System available at BCM Dan L. Duncan Compreh ensive Cancer Center.   Prior to  
                 enrollment in the study, the eligibility data must be reviewed and verified by [CONTACT_97038]. After the eligibility status is verified, the subject    
                 will be assigned to a unique study sequence number. After safety run in, additional  
                 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio  to either the MSC or control arm.  
                 Randomization will use the permuted block method and be stratified by [CONTACT_97039] (moderate and severe). Randomization information will be                   stored on a secure, access -restricted server a t Baylor College of Medicine.

                               which were deemed to be  related to the MS C infusion, which will be followed

                               directly related to the investigational infusion product. Adverse event grading  
Version 4.2 (05 -25-2022)

                                will be as defined by [CONTACT_97043]  
                               (CTCAE), Version 5. In making this assessment, there should be consideration  
                               of the probabi lity of an alternative cause (for example, COVID -19 itself or  
                               some other condition preceding randomization) and the timing of the event  
                               with respect to study treatment. The safety endpoint of the study is tSAE,  
                               defined as:  
- Any grade [ADDRESS_107040]- infusion 
- Grade 2 to 4 allergic reactions (severe rash, bronchospasm, and immediate -
type allergic react ions)  
- Arterial or venous thromboembolic event occurring within 48 hours of 
infusion  
- Serious Adverse Event (SAE) that, in the treating physicians’  judgment, is 
considered related to MSC infusion and requires withdrawal from the study  
 
8 Statistical Considerations  
8.1    Clinical Trial Design  
This is a  single -center , open label, non -blinded  randomized controlled, parallel study 
designed to evaluate the safety and clinical benefits of banked, allogeneic bone marrow 
MSCs versus  control (routine supportive  care) for treatment of COVID -19 related ARDS. The 
primary safety endpoint will be treatment -related serious adverse events (tSAE), defined in 
Section  7.4.5. The primary efficacy endpoint will be improvement in clinical status by [CONTACT_97044] [ADDRESS_107041] randomization. The six -category ordinal scale ranges from 6 to 1 with a  
      higher score indicates worse clinical outcome, i.e. 6 ꞊  death; 5 ꞊  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], requiring  
      ECMO and/or IMV; 4 ꞊ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], requiring NIV and/or HFNC therapy; 3 =  
      hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], requiring supplementa l oxygen (but not NIV/HFNC); 2 = hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], not  
      requiring supplemental oxygen; 1 = hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. The scale will be used to evaluate  
      patients’  status daily from baseline to day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Patients’ clinical status  at day  
      [ADDRESS_107042] randomization will be dichotomized as ‘improved’ ( decreased  by [CONTACT_97045]) or ‘not improved’ . Patients who died before day 14 will be deemed as ‘not  
      improved’. Public data about the  novel COVID -19 are limited  and the data varies between all   
      studies. Based on reported data, the time to improvement in patients with supportive care   
      were about 22 -23 days [20, 82] we expect 10% patients in the control group and 35%  
Version 4.2 (05 -25-2022)  
21 
      patients in the MSC group will achieve  ‘improved’ status at day 14 , a total sample size of  
     66 (36 in the MSC arm and 30 in  the control arm ) will provide 8 4% power to detect a  
     difference in clinical improvement  of 25% between control (10%) and MSC (35%) at a 7.5%   
     one-sided significance level using a Chi -square test.  
8.3     Randomization and Stratification  
   After safety run in, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either MSCs or    
   supportive care.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_97046] (moderate and severe),  
   and employ permuted blocks method.  
8.[ADDRESS_107043] the toxicity of MSC is low about 5 -10%. The chance of observing tSAE s in more than  
  two out of six patients is 1.6%. After the first six patients complete safety monitoring at day  
  28, we will halt  the study if more than two patients have tSAEs. Otherwise, the study will  
  continue to enroll  additional patients  
 
The study will continuously monitor the safety of MSCs infusions in patients who are 
randomized to the MSC arm so that the accrual can be  halted early if there is an unexpectedly 
high rate of treatment- related serious adverse events  (tSAE)  at day 28 , defined in Section 
7.4.5.  Patients who don’t complete the 28 -day observation due to a reason other than tSAE 
will be deemed not evaluable for tSAE. However, those patients in the randomization phase are evaluable for efficacy and will not be replaced. A tSAE rate of greater than or equal to 25% is considered excessive. The occurrence of tSAEs will be monitored using a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_97012] a Pocock -type boundary method [83]. The following sequential stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_97013]:  
 
Number of 
Patients  1-3 4-5 6-7 8-9 10-
12 13-
14 15-
17 18-
20 21-
23 24-
26 27-
28 29-
30 
Number of tSAEs <  - 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 
 
  The accrual will be halted if the number of tSAEs is equal to or exceeds the boundary in the  
  above table. Under this sequential stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], the probability of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_8169] 5% if the   
  true tSAE rate is 25%, and the probability of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_97014] 81% if the true tSAE  
  rate is 50%.  
8.5    Statistical Analysis  
   All patients who received any MSC infusions in the MSCs arm or supportive care in the control  
   arm will be included in the safety analyses.  All efficacy analysis will be based on the intent to  
   treat (ITT) population, defined as eligible and randomized subjects.   
 
   Adverse event data and corresponding toxicity grades after treatment will be    
   summarized descriptively  by [CONTACT_5268] . All adverse events, grades, and attributions  
Version 4.2 (05 -25-2022)  
22 
    will be listed and tabulated . Toxicity information including the type, severity, time of onset,   
   time of resolution, and the probable association with the study regimen will be tabulated and  
   summarized by [CONTACT_5268].  Rate of tSAEs  in patients treated with MSCs will be reported  
as proportion and its 95% confidence interval  overall and by [CONTACT_97047] (cancer patients 
versus  non-oncologic patients ).    
 
   Clinical outcome data (increase in oxygen saturation, decrease in oxygen  supplementation,   
   progression to mechanical ventilation or ECMO, evolution of other end -organ damage,  
   severity of ARDS, mortality rate, cause of death, duration on ventilation, durations  of ICU stay  
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], duration of vasopressor use, neg ative SARS -Co-V-2 RT -PCR by [CONTACT_4475] 28, and 
change in disease severity scores  and corticosteroid use) will be summarized descriptive ly. 
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_22977]. Continuous 
variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_3163], standard deviations, medians, interquartile ranges .  
 
   Proportion of patients who have an improvement of at least two categories on a six category   
   ordinal scale at day 14 and day  28 will summarized  using rate and their 95% confidence  
interval  by [CONTACT_97048] -square test s. Proportion of patients with 
improvement will also be reported b y cancer status. As exploratory analyses,  
   improvement in clinical status will also be assessed using logistic regression, adjusting for  
   potential confounders such as age, race/ethnicity, underline condition, and severity of ARDS.   
   Changes in the six -point ordinal scale, oxygen saturation, required FiO2, severity scores from  
   baseline will be presented graphically and compared with p aired t -tests or Wilcoxon singed  
   rank test s, whichever are  appropriate  (comparisons are considered exploratory ).  Duration of  
   overall survival will be days from date of randomization to date of death or date of last follow - 
   up for censoring.  Overall survival will be calculated using Kaplan -Meier survival curves with  
   estimates of medians and 95% confidence intervals by [CONTACT_97049] a log -rank test (comparison is considered exploratory).  
    
   Laboratory data, which include inflammatory markers  and chest imaging will be  reported  with  
   appropriate summary statistics . Changes from baseline to post -treatment  will be  plotted for  
   each patient over time and assessed using paired test methodologies when appropriate .  
   Comparison between the two treatment groups will be exploratory with appropriate two - 
   sample tests.

April 11, 2021  3  1.0 Background  
Hypertension (HTN) is more common and more harmful for African Americans than for any other ethnic group 
(AHA, 2020a). More than half of African American adults, about [ADDRESS_642508] HTN (AHA, 2017; 
Annie E. Casey Fdn, 2019). Furthermore, African Americans are 4 times less likely to adhere to HTN meds 
compared to their white counterparts (Schoenthaler et al. 2016). Tailored approaches to reduce the racial gap 
in HTN morbidity and mortality, particularly those supporting med adherence, are needed in  primary care 
(NHLBI, 2020). Importantly, HTN is one of most common co -morbidities in Covid19 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], 
particularly for African Americans (CDC 2020). Moreover, media coverage of a possible link between certain 
HTN meds, called RAAS inhibitors, and  severe Covid19 outcomes may have alarmed HTN patients about the 
safety of their meds. As a result, the ACC (March, 2020) issued guidelines recommending all patients adhere 
to HTN meds during the pandemic unless advised by [CONTACT_161009], as there is no evidence of a link 
between HTN drugs and Covid19 severity. In fact, severe heart complications have been reported among 
Covid19 patients that stopped HTN meds, including RAAS inhibitors, could worsen outcomes (ACC, July 2020). 
Thus, in the time of Covid19,  supporting med adherence of African Americans with HTN is extremely urgent.  
2.0 Goals  
We propose a digital adherence solution to help reduce HTN -related disparities among African Americans, 
called Memento.HTN, which is innovative in three key ways: 1) it  is the first -ever linked digital provider 
platform and patient SMS text system for HTN medication adherence; 2) it is culturally -tailored for African 
Americans with HTN; and 3) it has unique monitoring functionality allowing providers to monitor individua l 
patient adherence, support ‘new start’ patients, who are at increased risk for non -adherence, and to track 
group adherence rates by [CONTACT_156276], pi[INVESTIGATOR_499293], and patient demographics in order to inform clinical  
therapeutics. Requiring only minutes of staf f or prescriber monitoring per day, the Memento system simplifies 
and facilitates provider delivery of adherence support. The provider platform sends patients interactive SMS pi[INVESTIGATOR_499294] -sensitive motivational, educational, spi[INVESTIGATOR_37312]/str ess-supportive, and customizable 
texts, along with texts that target intentional non -adherence. Importantly, Memento allows [ADDRESS_642509] 
communication between providers and patients, and automatically alerts providers when a patient is having 
clinically -significa nt pi[INVESTIGATOR_499295].  
Specific Aim 1:  Develop an individually -tailored, culturally -sensitive digital health intervention comprised of a 
provider platform and linked patient SMS system to promote medication adherence in African Americans with 
HTN. 
Specific Aim 2: Implement a 6 -wk pi[INVESTIGATOR_499296]-term effectiveness for improving 
adherence.

up to 10 others or individual interviews (via zoom/phone) to gain their feedback on their experience with of 
the Memento program.  
5.0 Study  Procedures  
Patient Focus Groups:  For the formative & usability patient group  (or individual interviews), after providing 
online consent, individuals will meet for a 1.5 hour conversation via Zoom, during which they will either 
provide formative feedback on the Memento approach and on new text messages & the usability of the 
prototype Memento system. Focus groups/interviews will be audiotaped. Participants will receive $[ADDRESS_642514] at the end of each group/interview.  
Healthcare Provider Focus Groups:  For usability groups with healthcare providers (or individual interviews), 
after providing online consent, individuals will meet for a 1.5 hour conversation via Zoom, during which they 
will either provide formative feedback on the prototype Memento system, including how it might fit into 
clinical workflows, or usabil ity feedback on its functioning. Focus groups will be audiotaped.  
Participants will receive $ [ADDRESS_642515] evaluation:  After signing the online consent, participants will complete baseline 
assessments , pi[INVESTIGATOR_499297] (including medication name, dosing, retail or mail -order pharmacy, the preferred 
time for pi[INVESTIGATOR_499298], refill due date, and how long they have been on HTN meds), and demographic data in 
the online Qualtrics platform. Participants will rec eive $[ADDRESS_642516] for completion of baseline 
assessments. We will describe how to measure their arm with a tape measure (which we will have sent to 
them in advance) so that we can send them a correct size BP cuff. After taking the measurement, a ne w BP 
cuff (clinically - validated, blue -tooth enabled, Omron 5) will be delivered to each participant . Staff will meet 
again with participant (face -to-face or via zoom or phone) to guide them in getting baseline BP. The 
participant will be asked to sit quie tly in a chair with their feet on the floor for  several minutes, then measure 
their BP and pulse. Staff will record numbers. After another [ADDRESS_642517], the participant w ill begin receiving SMS texts from the 
provider platform.  
During the 6 -week study period, patient participants will receive several types of text messages: daily 
interactive pi[INVESTIGATOR_499298], educational, motivational, spi[INVESTIGATOR_37312]/stress -supportive .   Individuals that are ‘new 
starts,’ i.e. have been prescribed HTN meds within the last 8 weeks, will receive additional texts to support 
their implementation and persistence with their HTN med regimen. Study staff will monitor  backend data to

April 11, 2021  7  9.0. Outcome Measures  
HTN med adherence will be assessed by [CONTACT_499304] ( ARMS), a 
well-validated self -report measure used widely in studies with minority patients and/or those with low 
literacy (Buis et al., 2019; Kripalani et al., 2009; McNaugton et al., 2014). We will also use Segeral et 
al. (2010) 3 -item adherence measure, a s in our prior research (Pagan -Ortiz et al., 2019). Validated 
self-report measures correlate with clinical outcomes and are desirable to use in research with African 
American patients, who may resist providing bio -specimens due to historical mistrust (Ewin g et al., 
2019, Stirratt et al., 2015). Lastly, electronic pi[INVESTIGATOR_499300], expensive, and often 
ineffective for promoting and tracking adherence (Choudhry et al., 2017; Volpp et al., 2017).  
Secondary: Adherence self -efficacy will be assessed w ith the HTN med adherence self -efficacy scale 
(MASES) (Ogedegbe et al. 2003). HTN knowledge will be assessed using the NHLBI HTN Knowledge 
Scale (Carter -Edwards et al., 2002). Stress burden will be assessed using Perceived Stress Scale 
(Cohen et al., 1983) . Exploratory: BP will be measured at baseline and 6 weeks. Primary 
Hypothesis : Participants will show greater HTN med adherence at 6 wks compared to  baseline.  
Secondary Hypothesis: Participants will show greater HTN adherence self -efficacy, greater HTN 
knowledge, and lower stress burden at 6 wks compared to baseline. Exploratory Hypothesis : 
Participants will show a decrease in systolic BP at 6 wks compared to baseline. Data analyses:  We 
will conduct one -tailed paired t -tests at the .05 level for primary and exploratory hypotheses  and 
McNemar’s chi square for secondary hypotheses. Data from our Phase [ADDRESS_642525] 9 0% with a two -sided alpha level of .05.  
11.0  Privacy/Confidentiality  Issues  
For the pre -post evaluation, privacy breach due to electronic exchange of information will be protected 
against via technical safeguards including secure transmission modes for communication, including virtual 
private networks (VPN) or secure sockets layer (SSL), and encryption techniques, developed and utilized in 
other projects by 52Inc.  
The entire Memento.HTN system will use industry standard practices for access control, dat a security in 
transit, and data security at rest. The system will meet or exceed OWASP standards. All data in encrypted at 
rest using AES 256. All data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.[ADDRESS_642526] access to said data 
and all access by [CONTACT_499305]/or study team will be fully logged.  
Following the study, the pre -post data will be moved to a long -term storage database with Amazon Web 
Services and will only be accessible by [CONTACT_499306].  
In the patient pre -post informed consent, we will also state that online data collected for this study will be 
removed from the Qualtrics platform, which is HIPAA compliant, stored in our HIPPA compliant EH G 
Google Drive, and backed up on  encrypted folders on  an EHG MacBook Pro. Passwords to access the 
folders will be stored in LastPass, which uses strong encryption algorithms and provides extra

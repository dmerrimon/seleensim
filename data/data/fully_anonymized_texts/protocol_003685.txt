Protocol synopsis  
 
Title of study : A six month, single -center, feasibility study of the use of the Intuitive 
Surgical da Vinci® Single -Site™ Instruments and Accessories for Single -Port 
Laparoscopic Nephrectomies  
Purpose and rationale : After being informed of the potential risks and off -label use of 
the da Vinci Single -Site approach in our  study, patients will undergo a robotic -assisted 
single -site donor nephrectomy performed by a two -surgeon team utilizing existing da 
Vinci instrumentation and Single -Site platforms. Renal mobilization and vascular 
dissection will be performed with manual l aparoscopy performed for vascular division 
utilizing stapling devices.  
 
Objectives : The primary objective is to measure the feasibility of the current Single -Site 
platform to perform donor nephrectomy prior to vascular division and kidney extraction.  
 
Population : The proposed study population consists of adults aged between18 -[ADDRESS_897419] been previously approved by [CONTACT_664437].  
 
Inclusion criteria: The following criteria must be met in order for a patient to participate 
in the study. Male or female adults ages from [ADDRESS_897420] also be met in order to participate 
in the trial.  
 
Exclusion criteria: The following criteria will exclude any pati ents from participating in 
the clinical trial. Any patients suffering from cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, heart 
disease, liver disease, sickle cell disease, HIV or hepatitis, previous major abdominal 
surgery, or more than two left renal arteries.  
 
Study  design : After obtaining informed consent patients will be screened for eligibility. 
Patients will undergo a robotic -assisted single -incision laparoscopic donor nephrectomy 
with the use of the  da Vinci Surgical System with the Single -Site platform.

Efficacy assessments : Measurement of the ability of the current Single -Site platform to 
assist laparoscopic donor nephrectomy procedure prior to final extraction of the donor 
kidney.  

Data analysis : Statistical analysis will be performed on ergonomic and other collected 
data during the operative procedures and compared to matched patients. The proposed 
study of 20 patients may not generate statistically significant conclusions; however, we 
believe our observations will provide va lid conclusions that support the use and 
continued development of robotic single port donor nephrectomy.  
Sample size justification: The sample size was determined to provide a pi[INVESTIGATOR_664431] -Site platform in donor nephrectomies .

of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_664432] 90,000. 
Refinements in minimally invasive surgical approaches may encourage additional 
suitable indivi duals to consider kidney donation.  
 
Laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) surgery was introduced as one technique to 
further decrease the invasiveness of laparoscopic surgical approaches. We initiated our 
single -port donor nephrectomy program in 2009 and ha ve reported the World’s largest 
series. This series clearly supports the safety and improved outcomes associated with this 
approach. New instrumentation may further decrease the learning curve and operative 
times associated with single -port techniques. The  robotic single -port platform has 
demonstrated feasibility in a variety of procedures.   
 
Our center has performed over [ADDRESS_897422] 
laparoscopy and has reported patient benefits associated with a single port approach1. The 
single port robotic platform offers the potential to ameliorate the significant technical and 
ergonomic challenges that currently limit more widespread application of single port 
donor surgery.  
2.0 Purpose and rationale  
After  being informed of the potential risks and off -label use of the da Vinci Single -Site 
approach in our study, patients will undergo a robotic -assisted single -site donor 
nephrectomy performed by a two -surgeon team utilizing existing da Vinci 
instrumentation a nd Single -Site platforms. Renal mobilization and vascular dissection 
will be performed with manual laparoscopy performed for vascular division utilizing 
stapling devices.  
 
3.0 Objectives  
3.1 Primary objective  
The primary objective is to measure the feasibility of the current Single -Site platform to 
perform donor nephrectomy prior to vascular division and kidney extraction.  
3.2 Secondary objectives  
Secondary objectives include operative times, blood loss, and surgeon ergonomics as 
measured via techni ques developed in our surgical simulation center.  
 
4.0 Study design  
Hypothesis:  We believe that the da Vinci system and its single port platform will offer 
solutions to the challenges of visualization, instrument articulation, and ergonomics that 
limit the widespread application of single -port donor nephrectomy as the preferred 
approach for renal donation.  
Methods: We will perform an IRB -approved study of the use of the da Vinci Surgical 
System with Single -Site technology in donor nephrectomies. The IRB proposal and 
consent will be constructed to provide kidney donors with the opportunity to participate 
in our study. Patients will be informed of the potential risks and off -label use of the da 
Vinci Single -Site approach in our study. Because the standardiz ed approach for renal 
donation at our center is single port donor nephrectomy, we anticipate enrollment of up to 
20 patients for this study.  
Patients will undergo robotic -assisted single -site nephrectomy performed by a two -
surgeon team utilizing existing d a Vinci instrumentation and Single Site platforms. Renal 
mobilization and vascular dissection will be performed with conversion to standardized 
laparoscopy for the final stages of vascular division with stapling devices and extraction. 
The primary objectiv e is a feasibility measure of the ability of the current Single -Site 
platform to perform major portions of the procedure. Secondary objectives include 
operative times, blood loss, and surgeon ergonomics as measured via techniques 
developed in our surgical simulation center. Study cases will be compared to existing 
matched cohorts of single port donor nephrectomy cases performed by [CONTACT_664438]. The study population will include adults aged 18 to 70 of both genders who 
meet our center’s criteria for re nal donation and who consent to participate in the study. 
Our sample size of 20 patients is proposed to initiate this pi[INVESTIGATOR_664433].  
Statistical analysis will be performed on ergonomic and other col lected data during the 
operative procedures and compared to matched patients. The proposed study of 20 
patients may not generate statistically significant conclusions; however, we believe our 
observations will provide valid conclusions that support the use  and continued 
development of robotic single port donor nephrectomy techniques.

5.2 Exclusion criteria  
The following criteria will exclude any patients from participating in the clinical trial. 
Any patients suffering from canc er, diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease, liver disease, 
sickle cell disease, HIV or hepatitis, previous major abdominal surgery, or more than two 
left renal arteries.  
 
6.0 Treatments  
The study is a feasibility study. Patients will undergo a donor neph rectomy with the 
assistance of the investigational device, the da Vinci Surgical System with the Single -Site 
Instruments and Accessories .  
6.1 Investigational device  
The investigational device, the da Vinci Surgical System with the Single -Site Instruments 
and Accessories will be used to perform major portions of the procedure prior to vascular 
division and extraction.   
6.2 Treatment arms  
During pre -admission testing, if the patient has met all inclu sion/exclusion criteria, 
patients will be enrolled into the treatment group.  
6.3 Treatment assignment  
Once a potential study patient is identified and he/she fulfills the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and the informed consent form is signed, the patient will be entered into the 
study. The patient will be assigned a patient identification number (see Section  6.5.1).  
6.[ADDRESS_897424] patient is 
assigned patient number 1, and subsequent patients are assigned consecutive numbers 
(e.g. the second patient is assigned patient number 2, the third patient is assigned patient 
number 3). Once assigned to a patient, a patient number will not be reused. If the patient 
fails to be enrolled for any reason, the reason for not being enrolled will be entered on the 
Screen Failure eCRF.  
6.5.[ADDRESS_897425] -study treatment  
At study completion CRF page should be completed after the operation.  Due to the 
nature of the study (a onetime exposure to the investigational device during the surgical 
procedure) withdrawal from the study cannot occur. Subjects who wish to withdraw fro m 
the study follow up will be permitted to do so.

for admission and duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_664435]. All attempts will be 
made to collect RU variables in all patients throughout the duration of the study in order 
to avoid selection bias. There may also be circumstances when the col lection of such data 
after completion of the study may be warranted.  These data will be collected in the 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_664436] a separate report.    
7.5.2 Health -related Quality of Life  
The SF -36 is a widely used instrument to meas ure generic health status.  It is a 36 -item 
questionnaire that yields an 8 -scale health profile as well as summary measures of 
individual patients. It has proven useful in monitoring generic and specific populations, 
comparing the relative burden of differ ent diseases, differentiating the health benefits 
produced by [CONTACT_506001], and in screening individual patients.  The purpose 
collecting SF -36 data in this study is to compare the final health status of those 
undergoing the robotic assisted single -incision laparoscopic donor nephrectomy.  
The eight profiles (scales) are: bodily pain, general health, vitality, mental health, 
physical functioning, role -physical, role -emotional and social functioning. The two 
summary measures are physical health and m ental health.  
Patients will complete the questionnaire before other clinical assessments at any given 
visit. The SF -[ADDRESS_897429] the events as per 
instructions given in Section 7.5.1 of the protocol. Investigators will not encourage the 
patients to change the responses reported.

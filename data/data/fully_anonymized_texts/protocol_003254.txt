1.0      PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA  
 
This is a multi -center,  open  label  phase  I/II trial evaluating  the safety  and efficacy  of the novel  regimen  
vorinostat  and etoposide.  In the Phase  I portion,  the primary  objective  will be to determine  the dose 
limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  and the maximum  tolerated  dose (MTD)  for the combination  vorinostat  and 
etoposide  in pediatric  patients  with relapsed/refractory  solid  tumors  including  tumors  of the central  
nervous  system.  A standard  dose escalation  schema  will be used with 3-6 subjects  enrolled  per dose 
level  (cohort).  Patients  will be treated  with vorinostat  and etoposide  primarily  in the outpatient  setting,  
although  treatment  as an inpatient  will be permitted  as long as eligibility  criteria  are met. The dose 
schedule  will be comprised  of escalation  of the dose of vorinostat  in increments  of 30%.  Vorinostat  will 
be administered  orally  on Days  1-4 of every  21-day cycle  and given  4 hours  prior  to the administration  
of etoposide  on Days  3 and 4. The starting  dose of vorinostat  will be 50% of the single  agent  RP2D  for 
the oral formulation.  The etoposide  will be administered  intravenously  at a fixed  dose of 100 mg/m2/day 
on Days  3-5 of every  21-dose cycle.  Inter-patient  dose escalation  will proceed  as follows  until the MTD  
and RP2D is established:

portion  of the trial will begin.  The primary  objective  of the phase  II component  will be to determine  the 
efficacy  (CR+PR  rate) of the combination  vorinostat  and etoposide  in patients  with relapsed/refractory  
sarcoma.  Tumor  measurements  by [CONTACT_683138]  (version  1.1) will be obtained  every  2 
cycles  (every  6 weeks)  according  to section  12.[ADDRESS_925223],  unacceptable  
toxicity  or if the  patient  voluntarily  withdraws  from  the study.  It is anticipated  that the phase  II 
component  of the study  will be completed  within  1 year with an expected  accrual  of 28 patients.

Secondary  objectives  of the study  will include  correlative  studies  evaluating  the biologic  effects  of the 
novel  combination  of vorinostat  and etoposide  in pediatric  patients  enrolled  on this study.  Specifically,  
exploratory  studies  will be conducted  to determine  the changes  in histone  acetylation,  gene  expression  
profiling  and histone  phosphorylation  in patients  treated  on this study.  Functional  imaging  will be 
included  as a secondary  objective  to evaluate  alteration  in the  accumulation  of [18F]- fluorodeoxyglucose  
([18F]FDG)  with tumor  response.  
An exploratory  objective  of this study  will be the measurement  of symptom  distress  in patients  enrolled  
on this trial. It is hoped  that these  observations  will provide  unique  insight  into the changes  children  with 
relapsed/refractory  solid  tumors  experience  in symptom perception  during  treatment  with investigational  
agents.  In addition,  these  findings  may help predict  patterns  of symptom distres s and provide  us with the 
opportunity  to anticipate patients  at risk for heightened  symptom  distress.

3.1 BACKGROUND AND  RATIONALE  
3.2 Sarcomas  
IRB:  10-096 A(8) 
Amended:  03/25/14  
- 10 -  
  
Sarcomas  comprise  15% of pediatric  malignancies.  In 2003,  approximately  12,[ADDRESS_925224]  common  primary  malignant  bone  tumor  in children  and adolescents.  It is a 
highly  aggressive  neoplasm  typi[INVESTIGATOR_683087].  The development  of 
recurrent  and/or  metastatic  disease  depends  on the initial  therapy,  time to recurrence,  and the site and 
number  of recurrent  tumors.  With  aggressive  treatment,  40% of patients  who develop  metastatic  disease  
survive  > [ADDRESS_925225]  a significantly  lower  probability  of survival.  
These  patients  are candidates  for participation  in clinical trials with  novel agents.  
The Ewing  family  of tumors  (EFT)  represents  the second  most  common  primary  bone  malignancy  
affecting  children  and adolescents.  Patients  who initially  present  with or develop  metastatic  disease  have  
a significantly  less favorable  outcome  than those  with localized  disease.  Aggressive  multimodality  
therapy  can relieve  pain,  prolong  the progression -free interval,  and cure some  patients  of their disease;  
however,  the 5- year overall  survival  rate averages  33%.  
Soft tissue  sarcomas  are highly  malignant  tumors  that constitute  5-6% of all malignant  childhood  
neoplasms.  Of these,  rhabdomyosarcoma  (RMS)  is the most  common  in children.  Many  children  with 
RMS  are cured  with conventional  chemotherapy  and local  therapy:  surgery  with or without  
radiotherapy.  Children  with metastatic  disease  at presentation,  particularly  those  with bone  marrow  or 
bone  involvement  have  a much  poorer  outcome.  The 5-year overall  survival  for patients  with metastatic  
disease  is approximately  25%.  
Mortality  rate remains  disproportionately  high when  compared  with other  cancers  common  to these  age 
groups  such as testicular  cancer  and Hodgkin’s  disease.  Diagnosis  was delayed  in many  patients  by [CONTACT_683139],  who often  attribute  the initial  mass  to common  benign  lesions.  
Once  diagnosed,  patients  cannot  rely on a uniform  standard  of care,  resulting  in wide  variations  in 
outcomes.  Treatment  options  for patients  with advanced  pediatric  malignancies  are limited.  New  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_683088],  but the fragmentation  of biologic,  translational,  and clinical  research  makes  it 
difficult  to initiate innovative and timely  studies.  
This study  will evaluate  the role of a novel  histone  deacetylase  inhibitor,  vorinostat,  in combination  with 
the topoisomerase  II inhibitor,  etoposide  in all pediatric  tumors  in the phase  I component  but will later 
focus  on refractory  sarcomas  in the phase II  component.  
3.3 Vorinostat  
3.3.1 Histone  deacetylase  and HDAC Inhibitors  
Histone  deacetylase  (HDAC)  are enzymes  that catalyze  the removal  of acetyl  groups  from  the lysine  
residues  of proteins,  including  histones  and transcription  factors.  HDAC  inhibitors  can induce  tumor  
regression  in animals.  The transcription  of genes  is regulated  at least in part by [CONTACT_683140].  The core nucleosomal  histones  are the most  widely  studied  of the proteins  that 
become  acetylated  following  inhibition  of HDAC  activity.  In some  tumor  cells,  there  is an 
overexpression  of HDACs  or an aberrant  recruitment  of HDACs  to oncogenic  transcription  factors  
causing  hypoacetylation  of core nucleosomal  histones.  Hypoacetylation  of histones  is associated  with a 
IRB:  10-096 A(8) 
Amended:  03/25/14  
- 11 -  
  
condensed  chromatin  structure  and repression  of gene  transcription.  Inhibition  of HDAC  activity  allows  
for the accumulation  of acetyl  groups  on the histone  lysine  residues  resulting  in an open  chromatin  
structure and  transcriptional  activation.  
3.3.2 Mechanism  of Action  of Vorinostat  
Vorinostat  is a potent  inhibitor  of HDAC  activity  that binds  directly  to the catalytic  pocket  of HDAC  
enzymes.  Vorinostat,  at low nanomolar  concentrations  (IC 50 < 86 nM),  inhibits  the enzymatic  activity  of 
HDAC1,  HDAC2,  and HDAC3  (Class  I) and HDAC6  (Class  II). The concentration  of vorinostat  that 
causes  the accumulation  of acetylated  histones  also induces  cell cycle  arrest,  differentiation  or apoptosis  
of transformed  cells.  
Vorinostat  induces  apoptosis  in a wide  variety  of transformed  cells in culture,  including  cutaneous  T-cell 
lymphoma  cell lines,  circulating  atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]  T-cells derived  from  patients  with CTCL,  human  lymphoma  
cell lines  and murine  erythroleukemia  (MEL)  cells.  Vorinostat  also inhibits  proliferation  of cultured  
transformed  human  cells deriv ed from  leukemias,  non-small  cell lung carcinomas,  colon  carcinomas,  
central  nervous  system  tumors,  melanomas,  ovarian  carcinomas,  renal  cell carcinoma,  prostate  and 
breast  cancers.  In cultured  human  transformed  cell lines,  vorinostat  has synergistic  or additive  activity  in 
combination  with other  cancer  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  including  radiation,  kinase  inhibitors,  cytotoxic  agents,  and 
differentiating  agents.  In vivo,  vorinostat  demonstrates  anti-neoplastic  activity  in a variety  of rodent  
tumor  models  including  xenograft  models  of human  prostate, breast  and colon carcinoma.  
3.3.3 Nonclinical Pharmacology  of Vorinostat  
Vorinostat  is approximately  71% bound  to human  plasma  proteins  over the range  of concentrations  of 
0.5 - 50 g/mL.  
Vorinostat  has a low propensity  to cause  or be affected  by [CONTACT_9934]-drug interactions.  In animal  models  and 
in vitro human  systems,  the major  pathways  of metabolism  of vorinostat  are glucuronidation  and 
hydrolysis  followed  by -oxidation.  Additionally,  the glucuronidation  of vorinostat  is mediated  by 
[CONTACT_683141]  (UGTs),  making  it less susceptible  to 
drug interactions  through  modulation  of UGTs.  Vorinostat  is not recovered  intact  in urine  to any 
appreciable  extent.  Therefore,  compounds  known  to affect  renal  elimination  are not expected  to affect  
the pharmacokinetics  of vorinostat.  
Vorinostat  is not an inhibitor  (IC 50 of > 75 M) of CYP  drug metabolizing  enzymes  in human  liver 
microsomes.  Gene  expression  studies  in human  hepatocytes  detected  some  potential  for suppression  of 
CYP2C9  and CYP3A4  mRNA  and enzyme  activity  levels  were  observed  at ≥10 M vorinostat  
following  a 48 hr treatment  period.  However,  these  changes  were  observed  at concentrations  of 
vorinostat higher  than pharmacologically  relevant  serum  concentrations of  2 M (C max). Thus,  vorinostat  
is not expected  to affect  the pharmacokinetics  of other  agents.  As vorinostat  is not eliminated  via the 
CYP  pathways,  it is anticipated  that vorinostat  will not be subject  to drug-drug interactions  when  co- 
administered  with drugs  that are known  CYP  inhibitors  or inducers.  However,  no formal  clinical  studies  
have  been  conducted  to evaluate  drug interactions  with vorinostat.  Please  refer to vorinostat  CIB for 
detailed  information.  
3.3.4 Nonclinical Toxicology  of Vorinostat

Vorinostat  has been  investigated  in nonclinical  acute  and oral repeated -dose toxicity  studies,  
reproductive,  developmental  toxicity  studies,  and genetic  toxicity  studies  to support  oral administration  
of this compound  to humans.  The main  toxicities  observed  in animal  models  were  weight  loss and 
inappetence,  apparent  hemolytic  anemia  (rats only at 3.6 times  the equivalent  400 mg human  dose),  
leukopenia  (rats only at 1.3 times  the equivalent  400 mg human  dose),  thrombocytopenia  (male  rats 
only,  statistically  significant  change  at 0.5 times  the equivalent  400 mg human  dose but within  normal  
range  at all doses),  and gastrointestinal  tract irritation  (dogs  only,  at 8.5 times  the equivalent  400 mg 
human  dose).  Although  statistically  significant  and dose- dependent,  many  of the clinical  pathology  
findings  were  within  normal  historical  ranges  indicating  that they should  not have  major  toxicological  
consequences.  The toxicities  appeared  to be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_683089]  12 to 14 days.  There  has been no 
evidence  of cardiac  toxicity  based  on electrocardiogram  (ECG,  dogs  only),  blood  pressure  (dogs  only),  
heart  rate (dogs  only),  creatinine  kinase,  organ  weight,  gross  pathology,  or histopathology  assessments  
in studies  up to one month  duration.  No serious,  irreversible  damage  to any vital organ  has been  
observed. Importantly,  toxicities  in rats and  dogs  were  predictive  of adverse  effects  in humans  (anorexia,  
weight  loss, fatigue).  Toxicities  present  in animals  would  be manageable  in the clinic,  and the onset  of 
serious  toxicity  is readily  forecast  by [CONTACT_683142].  The nonclinical  toxicity  profile  of vorinostat  
is acceptable  for an oncology  drug.  Vorinostat  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_683090],  
following  administration  of a dose of 15 mg/kg/day  and 150 mg/kg/day,  respectively  (<1 times  the 
human  exposure  based  on AUC 0-24) and reached transplacental  equilibrium  within  [ADDRESS_925226]-dose.  
Vorinostat  was evaluated  in a panel  of genetic  toxicity  assays;  in vivo and in vitro  assays  were  found  to 
be positive.  Therefore,  vorinostat  should  not be taken  by [CONTACT_387974].  Pregnancy  should  be avoided  
both in female  subjects  taking  vorinostat,  and in female  partners  of male  subjects  taking  vorinostat  for at 
least [ADDRESS_925227] dose of vorinostat,  as data are not yet available  to establish  the safety  of 
vorinostat  ingesti on in male  patients  who impregnate  their partners.  No human  safety  data for the use of 
vorinostat  during  pregnancy  are available.  Please refer  to the vorinostat  CIB for  detailed  information  
3.3.5 Clinical  Pharmacokinetics  of Vorinostat  
The pharmacokinetics  of vorinostat  following  400 mg single -dose in a fasted  state;  and 400 mg single - 
and multiple -doses  in a fed (high -fat meal)  state were  evaluated  in 23 patients  in a Phase  I study  with 
relapsed  or refractory  advanced  cancer  using a validated  assay.  {Rubin}.  See Table  1.

Vorinostat  is eliminated  predominantly  through  metabolism  with less than 1% of the dose recovered  as 
unchanged  drug in urine,  indicating  that renal  excretion  does not play a role in the elimination  of 
vorinostat.  Recovery  of two pharmacologically  inactive  metabolites,  O-glucuronide  of vorinostat  (OG- 
V) and 4-anilino -4-oxobutanoic  acid (4A4OA),  in urine  was more  substantial. Please  refer to the 
vorinostat  CIB for  detailed  information.  
3.3.6 Summary  of Clinical  Experience  with Vorinostat  
As of July 2, 2012, Vorinostat  has been  orally  administered  to more  than 5,000  patients in Phase  I, Phase  
II and Phase  III clinical  studies.  These  studies  were  sponsored  by [CONTACT_683143],  Sharp  & Dohme  
Corporation,  a subsidiary  of [COMPANY_006]  & Co., Inc. (herein  referred  to as [COMPANY_006]),  including  MSD  KK

trials  with vorinostat.  One thousand  seven  hundred  and forty  seven  (1,740)  patients  have  been  treated  
with vorinostat  alone  or in combination  with other  chemotherapeutics  in [COMPANY_006]  & Co., Inc sponsored  
clinical  trials.  One thousand  six hundred  and seven  (1,607)  patients  have been  enrolled  in investigator - 
initiated  studies.  In addition,  61 studies  with vorinostat  are ongoing,  sponsored  by [CONTACT_683146]  (NCI)  under  the Cancer  Therapy  Evaluation  Program  (CTEP)  with one 
thousand  seven  hundred  and eighteen  (1,718)  patients  enrolled  as of November  5, 2012.  Therefore,  over 
five thousand  (5,000)  patients  have  received  at least one dose of vorinostat  in studies  sponsored  by 
[CONTACT_683147],  NCCN,  or independent  Investigators  (MISP).  Please  refer to the vorinostat  CIB for 
detailed  information  
3.3.7 Safety  of Vorinostat  
The total daily  dose of vorinostat  administered  per patient  ranged  from  200 mg to 900 mg across  all 
studies.  The tolerability  of vorinostat  appears  to be determined  by [CONTACT_683148].  The administration  frequency  across  all studies  included  once  daily  (QD)  
continuous  dosing,  twice  daily  (BID)  continuous  dosing,  BID discontinuous  dosing,  and three  times  
daily  (TID)  discontinuous  dosing  The maximum  tolerated  dose (MTD)  for continuous  daily  dosing  
without  a rest period  is 400 mg daily  or 200 mg twice  daily  (BID).  The MTD  for intermittent  dosing  has 
been  established  as 300 mg BID x 3 consecutive  days per week,  or 250 mg 3 times  daily  (TID)  x [ADDRESS_925229] period  {127}.  
Data  are presented  across  all 30 [COMPANY_006] -sponsored  protocols  to examine  the adverse  experience  profile  in 
the overall  population  of study  patients  receiving  vorinostat  monotherapy  and vorinostat  in comb ination  
therapy.  The clinical  safety  of vorinostat  is supported  by [CONTACT_41224]  1,740  patients  and 1,744  patient  
exposures  in CTCL  monotherapy,  CTCL  combination  therapy,  hematologic  malignancies  monotherapy,  
hematologic  malignancies  combination  therapy,  solid  tumor  monotherapy,  and solid  tumor  combination  
therapy  populations.  The additional  patient -exposures  occurred  in the initial  supportive  CTCL  study,  
where  patients  enrolled  in one cohort  were  permitted  to enroll  in a subsequent  cohort  at a later time 
point.  As a result,  4 patients  participated  in 2 dosing  cohorts.  While  the total number  of patients  in the 
CTCL  monotherapy population  was 180, the total number  of patient - exposures  was 184. 
Among  all 1,740  patients  (1,744  patient -exposures),  adverse  experiences  assessed  by [CONTACT_683149]  3 or higher  were  mainly  seen in the system  organ  classes  (SOC)  of: blood  and lymphatic  system  
disorders;  gastrointestinal  disorders;  general  disorders  and administration  site conditions;  investigations;  
metabolism  and nutrition  disorders;  nervous  system  disorders;  respi[INVESTIGATOR_696],  thoracic,  & mediastinal  
disorders;  and skin and subcutaneous  tissue  disorders.  The vorinostat  safety  profile  across  the different  
populations  is not significantly  different.  Most  of the common  AEs experienced  by ≥10%  of all patients  
across  the different  populations  are generally  comparable.  Three  hundred  and five (17.5%)  patients  have  
had SAEs  that were  considered  by [CONTACT_683150].  
Thrombocytopenia  was the most  common  drug-related  SAE  reported  across  all 30 [COMPANY_006] -sponsored  
studies  and occurred  in 39 (2.2%)  patients.  Overall,  treatment  with oral vorinostat  was well tolerated.  
Pulmonary  embolism  and deep  vein thrombosis  have  been  reported.  Investigators  should  be alerted  to 
the signs  and symptoms  of these  events.  QT prolongation  has been  observed  as well.  Monitoring  of 
electrolytes  and EKGs  at baseline  and periodically  during  treatment  is clinically  indicated.  Please  refer 
to the vorinostat  CIB for detailed  information.

Dose -limiting  toxicities  (DLTs)  of single  agent  vorinostat  were  mainly  non-hematologic  (anorexia,  
dehydration,  diarrhea,  and fatigue);  hematologic  toxicities  are primarily  anemia  and thrombocytopenia,  
most  of which  were  mild to moderate.  The majority  of these  DLTs  occurred  within  the first month  on 
vorinostat.  The DLTs  were  manageable  because  these  toxicities  resolved  quickly  after drug 
administration  was interrupted  
A phase  I study  of oral vorinostat  was performed  in children  with recurrent  or refractory  solid  tumors.  
Vorinostat  was administered  once  daily  at dose levels  180, 230, and 300 mg/m2/day.  The toxicity  profile  
was similar  to adult  trials.  Of 24 patients  evaluable  for toxicity,  DLTs  included  a deep  vein thrombosis  
noted  in 1/6 patients  treated  at a dose of 180 mg/m2/day and hypokalemia  in 1/6 patients  treated  at 230 
mg/m2/day.  DLTs  at 300 mg/m2/day include  reversible  hypokalemia  (1), neutropenia  (1), and 
thrombocytopenia  (2). The recommended  phase  II dose in children  was established  at 230 mg/m2/day.  
Additional  Grade  3 or 4 non-dose limiting  toxicities  included  elevation  in ALT/AST,  
hyperbilirubinemia,  leucopenia  and lymphopenia.[7] A phase  I study  has been  conducted  with the oral 
vorinostat  in combination  with 13 cis-retinoic  acid in children  with refractory  neuroblastoma,  
medulloblastoma,  primitive  neuroectodermal  tumors  and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_683091].  Vorinostat  was well 
tolerated  at a dose of 180 mg/m2/day for 4 days a week  when  administered  with cis-retinoic  acid at a 
dose of 80 mg/m2/dose  BID for 12 days of a 28 day course.  [41] There  have  been  no clinical  trials  
conducted  in children  with vorinostat  in combination  with a cytotoxic  agent  to date.  
3.3.8 Efficacy  of Vorinostat  
Vorinostat  has recently  been approved  by [CONTACT_683151]  T-cell lymphoma  (CTCL)  who have  progressive,  persistent  or recurrent  disease  
on or following  two systemic  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy  in Patients  with Solid  Tumors  
In Protocol  002, a Phase  II study  of vorinostat  in patients  with head  and neck  cancer,  no confirmed  
partial  or complete  responses  were  observed  in the 12 patients  enrolled  in the study.  An unconfirmed  
partial  response  was observed  in one patient  and stable  disease  was observed  in three  patients.  In 
Protocol  006, a Phase  I study  of vorinostat  in patients  with advanced  solid  tumor  and hematologic  
malignancies,  50 patients  with solid  tumors  were  enrolled.  Tumor  responses.  and stable  disease  were  
noted  in several  patients  with solid  tumors,  confirmed  PR’s  were  observed  in patients  with thyroid  
papi[INVESTIGATOR_683092] 2 unconfirmed  partial  responses  for 
patients  with – mesothelioma.  The confirmed  responses occurred  at 400 mg twice  daily  x7d/wk.  
In a Phase  I study  evaluating  the safety,  tolerability,  pharmacokinetic s and pharmacodynamics  of 
vorinostat  in patients  with advanced  cancers,  no formal  efficacy  evaluations  were  performed.  The study  
concluded  that short -term administration  of vorinostat  to patients  with advanced  cancer  was generally  
well tolerated.  
In a Phase  II study  of vorinostat  in patients  with relapsed  or refractory  breast,  colorectal,  and non-small  
cell lung  cancer,  the primary  objectives  of the  protocol  were  to determine  the response  rate of anti-tumor  
efficacy  using  RECIST  criteria  and to evaluate  positron  emission  tomography  (PET)  as an  early  
indicator  of response  to vorinostat  at the initial  starting  dose of 400 mg po BID for 14 of 21 days.  The 
efficacy  evaluation  included  all patients  who received  14 days of continuous  study  therapy  and PET 
scans  performed  on Day 15. A total of 16 patients  were  enrolled.  Seven  (7) patients  were  reported  to

In PN058,  a phase I clinical  study  of vorinostat in combination  with gemcitabine  and cisplatin  in 
patients  with advanced  non-small  cell lung cancer,  61 patients  were  enrolled.  Of the 49 patients  
included  in the efficacy  analysis,  across  five dose cohorts, 13  had an objective  overall  response.  
In PN066,  a phase  I clinical  study  of vorinostat  in combination  with carboplatin  and paclitaxel  
conducted  in Japan  (MSD  KK) in patients  with advanced  non-small  cell lung cancer,  3 patients

3.4 Etoposide  
Etoposide  (VP16),  a semisynthetic  derivative  of podophyllotoxin,  acts as a topoisomerase  II inhibitor.  It 
is a cell-cycle,  phase -specific  drug which  has demonstrated  activity  in the phase  II setting  in treating  a 
broad  spectrum  of pediatric  and adult  malignancies.  Single -agent  activity  for pediatric  solid  tumors  of 
approximately  20% with variation  in the disease  specific  response  rates (ie., osteosarcoma  9%, soft 
tissue  sarcoma  8%, rhabdomyosarcoma  19%,  and Ewing’s  sarcoma  40%).  In most  pediatric  and adult  
salvage  regimens,  etoposide is  usually  administered  intravenously  at a dose of 100-200 mg/m2/day for 3- 
[ADDRESS_925232],  differentiation,  and apoptosis  in a variety  of adult  
and importantly  in pediatric  tumors  including  neuroblastoma  and rhabdomyosarcoma.  [13-17] Extensive  
preclinical  studies  have  demonstrated  evidence  of anti-tumor  activity  of this agent  in combination  with a 
variety   of  agents  including   topoisomerase   II  inhibitors   (ie.  etoposide,   doxorubicin)   [18,  19],  DNA

hypomethylating  agents  (ie., 5-azacytidine  or decitabine)  [20] , Imatinib  mesylate[21-23] , Bortezomib  [24] , 
Ellipticine  [19], Cisplatin  [25] and Hsp 90 inhibitors  [26] . Of interest,  vorinostat  has been  shown  to 
potentiate  DNA  damage  induced  by [CONTACT_683152] a sequence -specific  fashion.  Pre- 
treatment  with Vorinostat  [ADDRESS_925233]  cancer  cell lines.[27] Enhanced  cytotoxicity  has also been demonstrated  with other  
chemotherapeutic  agents  including  ellipticine,  doxorubicin,  or cisplatin,  but not of the topoisomerase  I 
inhibitor  camptothecin.[19] However,  treating  cells in the reverse  order  (anticancer  drug followed  by 
[CONTACT_188758])  was no more  cytotoxic  than the anticancer  drug alone.  Additional  unpublished  data by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Aru Narendran,  an investigator  in this trial demonstrated  similar  results  with the combination  of 
vorinostat  and etoposide.  First,  drug sensitivity  curves  for etoposide  were  determined  then leukemic  
cells were  cultured  with increasing  concentrations  of vorinostat  alone  or in combination  with etoposide  
at its IC10 or IC25 values.  In these  experiments,  etoposide  was added  at the same  time,  48 hours  after the 
addition  of vorinostat.  After  four days in culture,  cell growth  inhibition  was quantified  by [CONTACT_683153].  The fraction  affected  (Fa) and the combination  index  (CI) were  calculated  with the CalcuSyn  
computer  program  (Biosoft)  according  to the method  of Chou  and Talalay.[ADDRESS_925234]  when  etoposide  
was added  after 48 hours  with a calculated  CI of 0.64 compared  to the final cytotoxicity  when  the two 
agents were added together  (CI = 1.1).

The study  will incorporate  biologic  correlative  analyses  to evaluate  the following:  assessment  of histone  
acetylation/gene  expression  profiling  and assessment  of cellular phosphorylation  profiling.  Incorporation

identify  expression  profiles  associated  with risk of metastasis  [28, 29] (van't  Veer  el al., 2002;  van de 
Vijver,  et al., 2002).  In this protocol,  pre- and post-treatment  samples  of tumor  will be collected  for 
correlative  molecular  studies.  These  samples  will be used to search  for (1) gene  expression  profiles  that 
predict  response  to the combination  vorinostat  and etoposide;  (2) expression  changes  that occur  after 
exposure  to Vorinostat  and Etoposide.  Results  from  these  gene  expression  studies  may provide  
important  information  regarding  the mechanisms  of response  to vorinostat.  Ultimat ely, these  results  
could guide  the selection  of patients for treatment  with vorinostat.  
Histone  Phosphorylation  Profiling  
Vorinostat  and another  HDAC  inhibitor,  depsipeptide,  have  shown  efficacy  in a wide  range  of cancers,  
in particular  for cutaneous  T-cell lymphoma  (CTCL),  and are progressing  in phase  II clinical  studies.  
However,  evidence  is accumulating  that specific  HDAC  enzymes  are important  with respect  to clinical  
efficacy,  calling  the usefulness  of the classical  inhibitors  into question.  Class  I enzymes  are being  
heralded  as the most  clinically  relevant;  however,  mechanisms  involved  in these  processes  are currently  
not clear.  [30, 31] 
Class  IIa histone  deacetylases  (HDACs)  are found  both in the cytoplasm  and in the nucleus  where  they 
repress  genes  involved  in several  major  developmental  programs.  [32] In response  to specific  signals,  the 
repressive  activity  of class  IIa HDACs  is neutralized  through  their phosphorylation  on multiple  N- 
terminal  serine  residues  and 14-3-3-mediated  nuclear  exclusion.  It has been shown  that class  IIa HDACs  
are subjected  to signal -independent  nuclear  export  that relies  on their constitutive  phosphorylation.  
EMK  and C-TAK1,  two members  of the microtubule  affinity -regulating  kinase  (MARK)/Par -[ADDRESS_925236]  been  identified  as regulators  of this process.[31] It has been  shown  that EMK  and C-TAK1  
phosphorylate  class  IIa HDACs  on one of their multiple  14-3-[ADDRESS_925237]  N-terminal  serine  residue  by [CONTACT_683154]/Par -1 kinases,  i.e., Ser155,  is a prerequisite  for the 
phosphorylation  of the nearby  14-3-3 site, Ser181.  This shows  that multi -site hierarchical  
phosphorylation  by a variety  of kinases  allows  for sophisticated  regulation  of class  IIa HDAC  function.  
[31] 
We propose  to investigate  target  modulation  patterns  in peripheral  blood  lymphocytes  in response  to 
specific  anti-tumor  activity  of Vorinostat.  This is based  on the rationale  that vorinostat  inhibits  its target  
enzyme  (HDAC)  in peripheral  mononuclear  cells while  exerting  its activity  on tumor  tissue.[13] The anti- 
tumor  activity  of HDAC  inhibitors  has been  attributed  to both their ability  to inhibit  deacetylases  and 
their capacity  to down -regulate  phenotypic  expression  of oncoproteins  as well as activation  of the 
intrinsic  apoptosis -inducing  cascade.  [32-35] It has been  shown  that cell cycle  arrests  or induction  of 
apoptosis  are dependent  on treatment  conditions  such as drug concentrations  and duration  of drug 
exposure,  as well as the intrinsic  sensitivity  of malignant  cells to this class  of anticancer  agents.[36]  In

addition,  HDAC  inhibition  has been  shown  to induce  acetylation  and inhibit  the ATP  binding  and 
chaperone  function  of heat shock  protein  (HSP)  90. This promotes  the polyubiquitylation  and 
degradation  of the pro-growth  and pro-survival  client  proteins  such as  FLT-3, Raf and AKT.[37] 
In the mantle  cell lymphoma  model,  HDAC  inhibitors  have been  shown  to reduce  VEGF  production  and 
to induce  growth  suppression  of the malignant  cells.  [38] Effects  of HDAC  inhibition  also lead to 
decreased  expression  of angiogenesis -related  genes  such as angiopoietin -2, Tie-2, and survivin  in 
endothelial  cells and down -regulated  hypoxia -inducible  factor  1-alpha  and VEGF  expression  in tumor  
cells.  [39, 40] Based  on these  data,  we hypothesize  that the analysis  of cell cycle  regulators,  apoptosis  
related  proteins,  clients  of Hsp90  and angiogenesis  related  molecules  in the peripheral mononuclear  cells 
of patients undergoing  therapy  would  provide effective target modulation  analysis  for this protocol.  
 
3.7 Exploratory  Objectives  
Symptom  distress  
Symptoms  are “perceived  indicators  of change  in normal  functioning  as experienced  by [CONTACT_1962]”.[42] 
Lenz  et al suggest  that each symptom  can be conceptualized  as a multidimensional  experience  which  
can be described  and measured  separately  by [CONTACT_8335].[42] Symptoms  possess  common  dimensions  
such as intensity  (strength  or severity),  timing  (duration  and frequency  of occurrence),  level  of perceived  
distress  (degree  of discomfort  or bothersome)  and quality.  Symptom  distress  is defined  as the amount  of 
physical  or mental  upset,  anguish,  or suffering  experienced  by [CONTACT_683155]  [43, 44]. Lenz  et al proposes  that symptom  distress  is the degree  to which  a person  is bothered  
by [CONTACT_683156].  Lenz  et al suggest  that the degree  of symptom distress  
felt by [CONTACT_683157].  Furthermore,  Lenz  et al suggest  that the concurrence  of multiple  unpleasant  symptoms  
is likely  to result  in an experience  that is multiplicative  rather  than additive.  This has significance  for 
cancer  patients  who experience  a variety  of unpleasant  symptoms  related  to their disease  and associated  
treatments.  
Symptom  clusters  
Depending  on a particular  disease  or treatment  type,  patterns  of symptoms  emerge.  It is this groupi[INVESTIGATOR_683094].  While  individuals  are able to distinguish  the unique  qualities  of 
each symptom,  the concurrent  experience  of multiple  symptoms  appears  to have  an effect  that is greater  
than,  and different  from,  the effect  of each individual  symptom  alone.  This phenomenon  has been  
demonstrated in studies  examining  the effect  of symptoms  on quality  of life [45, 46, 47] 
 
Symptom  Clusters  and Symptom  Distress  in Children with  Cancer  
Although  pediatric  cancer  clinical  trials  traditionally  have focused  on survival  or toxicity,  there  is an 
emerging  interest  in the measurement  of outcomes  that reflect  the impact  of treatment  on patients  and 
therefore,  their quality  of life. This interest  is related  both to the improved  survival  of children  with 
cancer  and to a consensus  that quality  of life outcomes  are highly  relevant.  [48, 49] 
The distressing  symptoms  caused  by [CONTACT_683158].   The  measurement   of  these  
IRB:  10-096 A(8) 
Amended:  03/25/[ADDRESS_925238]  of treatment  on a child’s  quality  of life. The intensity  
of these  symptoms  may ultimately  influence  the child  and adolescent’s  ability  to meet  important  
developmental  challenges  and milestones.  Therefore,  attention  must  be given  to the symptom  
experiences  that occur  during  childhood  cancer  treatment  so that we may decrease  their distress  and 
promote the needed energy  for engaging in normal  activities  of childhood  and adolescence.  [50] 
There  is much  still to be learned  about  the symptoms  pediatric  cancer  patients  experience  and the effect  
of these  symptoms  on their quality  of life. Few studies  have  attempted  to describe  the experience  of 
symptoms  in children  with cancer.  This is due, in part, to the lack of validated  symptom  assessment  
scales  for this population.  [51] Only  recently  have  studies  begun  to address  the distressing  cancer  events  
and symptoms  from  the perspective  of the child  and the family.  Collins,  et al in [ADDRESS_925239]  
common  physical  symptoms  in a group  of 160 children  with cancer  as lack of energy,  pain,  drowsiness,  
nausea,  coughing,  and lack of appetite.[48] In 2003,  Hedstrom  et al discovered  that the most  common  
causes  of distress  in a group  of 121 children  with cancer  were  treatment  related  pain,  nausea  and fatigue  
rather  than the cancer  itself.  [52] Woodgate  and Degner  evaluated  expectations  and beliefs  about  
childhood  cancer  symptoms  in a group  of 39 children  and their families  that showed  that these  
individuals  expected  to experience  suffering  as part of the cancer  treatment,  even  believing  that 
unrelieved  symptoms  were  necessary  for the cure.  [53] In a review  of the research  program  at [LOCATION_007]  
Children’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  it was demonstrated  that fatigue,  sleep  disturbances,  and pain are significant  
symptoms  experienced  by [CONTACT_7683].  They  also found  an association  between  these  symptom  clusters  and 
physical  performance  changes  as well as behavior  problems.  It was also at [LOCATION_007]  Children’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_683095]  (MSAS)  was reviewed  and modified  by [CONTACT_683159]:  the MSAS (10-18) and  the MSAS (7-12). [54] 
At present,  there  is no published  data regarding  multi  - symptom  assessment  in a Phase  I/II setting.  In 
this study,  we will use the MSAS  (10-18) instrument  to assess  symptom  complexes  in relation  to the 
novel chemotherapy  regimen,  vorinostat  and etoposide.  
This exploratory  study  may potentially  lead to more  definitive  studies  to establish  a correlation  between  
the symptom  complexes  and quality  of life in children  and adolescents  on early  clinical  trials.  The 
primary  focus  of these  exploratory  studies  will be to determine  whether  symptom  distress  differs  over 
time in children  with relapsed/refractory  sarcoma  receiving  vorinostat  and etoposide.  
This study  will provide  unique  insight  into the changes  children  with relapsed  or refractory  sarcoma  
experience  in symptom  perception  during  treatment  with vorinostat  and etoposide.  In addition,  findings  
may help us predict  patterns  of symptom  distress  and provide  us with the opportunity  to anticipate  
patients  at risk for heightened  symptom  distress.  Effective  clinical  practice  should  be based  on accurate  
assessments  and anticipation  of needs.  In order  to do this, the first step is identifying  symptoms  and their 
pattern  of manifestation.  Findings  from  this study  will accomplish  this. Future  strategies  include  
applying  interventions  known  to be effective  in the management  or prevention  of symptoms  or testing  
the efficacy  of newly  developed interventions  that may prevent or minimize  specific  symptoms

Part 1: Dose Escalation  Phase  
This is a multi -center,  open  label,  phase  I trial of escalating  doses  of vorinostat  in combination  with 
etoposide.  This component  of the study  is designed  to establish  the MTD,  DLT,  and the RP2D  of the 
combination  vorinostat  and etoposide  in pediatric  patients  with relapsed/refractory  solid  tumors.  Patients  
will be assessed  in 3-week  cycles.  Escalating  doses  of vorinostat  will be administered  orally  on a daily  x 
[ADDRESS_925240] completed  one course  of therapy  (e.g. 3 
weeks)  without  a DLT.  For the purposes  of this study,  DLT  will be defined  during  the first cycle  of 
treatment.  The individual  parameters of DLTs  are defined  in Section  9.7. 
If a patient  does not experience  a DLT  as defined  in Section  9.7 but is taken  off study  due to 
unacceptable  adverse  events/toxicity,  that patient  will be considered  to have had a DLT  for the purposes  
of dose escalation.  If therapy  is discontinued  during  the first cycle  for reasons  other  than toxicity,  an 
additional  patient  may be enrolled  at the dose level  of the  off-study  patient  to ensure  adequate  evaluation  
of toxicity.  
The MTD  is defined  as the highest  dose level  with an observed  incidence  of DLT  in no more  than one 
out of  six patients  treated  at a particular  dose level.  The dose escalation  scheme  is as follows:  
The dose escalation  scheme  is as follows:  
 
1) If none  of initial  three  patients  at a given  dose level  experience  DLT,  the next dose level  is 
studied  in another  cohort of three patients.  
 
2) If one of the initial  three  patie nts at a given  dose level  experience  DLT,  up to three  additional  
patients  will be treated  at that same  dose level.  Escalation  will continue  if one of the six 
patients  experience  DLT.  
 
3) If two or three  patients  experience  DLT  in the first three  patients,  or two or more  patients  
experience  DLT  in six patients  at a given  dose level,  the MTD  will be determined  as the 
preceding  dose level.  
 
4) If three  or fewer  patients  are treated  at a dose under  consideration  as the MTD,  additional  
patients  to total six will be treated  at that level  to confirm  the MTD.  
Once  the MTD  level  is determined,  this level  will be expanded  to treat a total of 9 subjects  to determine  
the safety  of the RP2D.  If two (or more)  of the 3-[ADDRESS_925241] been exceeded.

Symptom  distress  will be measured  with the MSAS  (10-18) [48] self-report  instruments  that measure  the 
presence,  frequency,  severity  and level  of distress  in children  with cancer.  The MSAS  (10-18) measures  
30 symptoms  derived  from  a multidimensional  symptom  assessment  instrument  validated  for use with 
adults.  For each symptom,  separate  4-or 5 point  Likert  scales  were  used to measure  the dimensions  of 
frequency,  severity  and distress.  Twenty -two symptoms  will be evaluated  for each of the three  
dimensions;  frequency  was not relevant  for eight  symptoms  and for these  only severity  and distress  are 
assessed.  Scoring  of the MSAS  yields  several  valid  subscores,  assessing  psychological  symptoms,  
physical  symptoms  and a global  distress  scale.  Finally,  the total MSAS  score  will be computed  as an 
average  of the symptom  scores  for all [ADDRESS_925247]  of treatment  and time on symptom  distress.

to complete  all fields  as required  may prevent  future  shipments  until it is determined  appropriate  
accountability  can be maintained.  Audit  of the DAR  will be included  in the monitoring  visits  of studies  
with investigational  agents.  All investigational  agents  will be stored  as per manufacturer  
recommendations  in a secure  location  away  from  commercial  drug stock  that is only accessible  to 
authorized  personnel.   Each  agent  is to be stored  and accounted  for separately  by [CONTACT_990].  
Investigational  agents  requiring  storage  in refrigerator  or freezer  must  be stored  within  the temperature  
range  required  by [CONTACT_683168].  The agents  must  be stored  separately  by [CONTACT_683169]/freezer.  No food products  may be stored  within  the refrigerator/freezer.  A 
thermometer  or monitoring  device  must  be utilized  to monitor  and record  temperatures  on a log posted  
on the equipment  at a minimum  of once  daily.  Out of range  temperatures  must  be documented  with 
reason for situation  and actions  taken  to correct.  
 
Investigational  agents  must  not be prepared  until the subject  is present,  required  testing  completed,  and 
the treating  physician’s  orders  are received.  The investigator  will administer  the agent  only to subjects  
registered  to the study  and under  the investigator’s  personal  supervision  or under  the supervision  of a 
sub-investigator  responsible to the  investigator . 
Procedures  for proper  handling  and disposal  of anticancer  drugs  should  be considered.  Several  
guidelines  on this subject  have  been  published.  There  is no general  agreement  that all of the procedures  
recommended  in the guidelines  are necessary  or appropriate.  Direct  contact  [CONTACT_683170].  
If such contact  [CONTACT_110534],  wash  thoroughly  as outlined  in the references.  Personnel  should  avoid  exposure  
to crushed  and/or  broken  capsules.  Please  refer to the published  guidelines  regarding  the handling  of 
anticancer agents  (refer  to Vorinostat CIB).

7.[ADDRESS_925276],  and Health  Insurance  Portability  and Accountability  
Agreement  (HIPAA)  must  be submitted  to the DCC  prior  to enrollment  of any subject  on this 
study. Verification  of subject enrollment  on this study is defined  in section  15.0.  
Every  effort  will be made  to include  women,  children  of both sexes,  and minorities  in the study  
population  for this trial. No patient  will be excluded  from participation  in this trial on the basis  of 
gender,  ethnicity,  or race.  Review  of accrual  to past pediatric  multicenter  studies  of new agents  
demonstrates  the accrual  of both genders  and all NIH-identified  ethnicities  to such studies.  The 
small  number  of patients  entered  into this trial will obviate  any analysis  of variation  in toxicity  
profile  or response  rate with  gender  or ethnicity.  
Data  from  the institutions  participating  in this trial have  been  reviewed  with respect  to 
enrollment  of patients  of different  races  and genders.  It is anticipated  that enrollment  of the 
current  study  will follow the same  pattern.

every  cycle  at a starting  dose of 125 mg/m2/dose.  The starting  dose of vorinostat  will be 50% of the 
pediatric  single  agent  RP2D  for the oral formulation.  The starting  dose of vorinostat  is approximately  
70% of  the dose that acceptable  dose reported  in combination  with the biologic  agent 13 cis-retinoic  acid 
reported  by [CONTACT_683175]. The dose of Vorinostat  will be escalated  in increments  of 30% as long as there  
is no evidence  of dose limiting  toxicity.  
If dose limiting  toxicity  is demonstrated  at the Dose  level  1, the dose of Vorinostat  will be reduced  de- 
escalated  by 25% (Dose  Level  -1). If a patient  experiences  emesis  within  30 minutes  of receiving  
vorinostat the  dose should  then be repeated.  
Etoposide  will be administered  intravenously  over 1 hour (+ 10 minutes)  on Days  3-5 of every  cycle  at a 
fixed  dose of 100 mg/m2/dose  in both phase  I and II components  of the study.  See Schema  in Table  7

of an anaphylactic  reaction,  the infusion  of etoposide  should  be terminated.  In the event  of hypotension,  
the infusion  of etoposide  should  be stopped  and Normal  Saline  administered  until the blood  pressure  
normalizes.  Once  the blood  pressure  has normalized,  the infusion  may be re-instituted  and the rate of 
administration  decreased  to double  the interval  of administration  (2H).  Source  documentation  for 
etoposide  administration  start and end  times,  and dose must  be provided.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-hematologic   dose-limiting   toxicity   will  be  defined   as  any  Grade   3,  4,  or  5 
nonhematologic  toxicity,  with the specific  exception  of: 
• Grade  3 nausea  or Grade  3 vomiting  that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_683110]  
9.8.5 and lasts for less than 48 hours.  
• Grade  3 diarrhea  that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_683111]  9.8.5  and 
lasts for less than 48 hours.  
• Grade  3 dehydration  that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_683111]  9.8.5  and 
lasts for less than 48 hours.  
• Alopecia  
• Inadequately  treated  hypersensitivity  reactions  
• Grade  3 elevated  transaminases  of < 1 week  in duration  
 
9.7.3 In addition,  the following  will also be considered  DLT:  
• Any drug-related  adverse  experience,  regardless  of (CTCAE)  version  4.0  grade,  leading

to a dose modification  of vorinostat;  
• Unresolved  drug-related  toxicity,  regardless  of (CTCAE)  version  4.[ADDRESS_925290] scheduled  treatment;  
• Requirement  for dose reduction  by [CONTACT_683176].  
Dose  escalation  will be determined  based  on the occurrence  of DLTs.  For the purposes  of deciding  
whether  to advance  the Dose  Level,  DLTs  will be counted  by [CONTACT_4676]  (i.e., a patient  who experiences  
more  than 1  DLT will  be counted only once).  
Management  and dose modifications associated  with the above  adverse  events  are outlined  in Section  
9.13.  
 
Dose  escalation  will proceed  within  each cohort  according  to the following  scheme.  
 
Number  of Patients  with 
DLT at Given  Dose  Level   
Escalation  Decision Rule  
0 of 3 Enter  3 patients  at the next dose level.  
>2 of 3 Dose  escalation  will be stopped.  This dose level  will be 
declared  the maximally  administered  dose (highest  dose 
administered).  Up to [ADDRESS_925291] 3 more  patients  at this dose level.  
• If 0 of these 3 patients  experience  DLT,  proceed to the 
next dose  level.  
• If 1 or more  of this group  suffer  DLT,  then dose escalation  
is stopped,  and this dose  is declared  the maximally  
administered  dose.

9.8.2 The concomitant  use of  other medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_683113] l. Patients  should  be stabilized  prior to study entry  on all medications.  
• Prolongation  of prothrombin  time (PT) and International  Normalized  Ratio  (INR)  have been 
observed  in patients  receiving  vorinostat  concomitantly  with coumarin  derivative  
anticoagulants.  Physicians  should  carefully  monitor  PT and INR in patients  concurrently  
administered  vorinostat and coumarin  derivatives.  
 
• Patients  may not receive  chemotherapy,  radiotherapy,  biological  therapy  or investigational  
anticancer  therapy  during  the study.  Patients  who require  these  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_683114].  
• Vorinostat  should  not be administered  concomitantly  with other  HDAC  inhibitors  (e.g.,  
valproic  acid)  as class -specific  adverse  reactions  may be additive.  
9.9 Supportive  Care  Guidelines  
9.9.1 Appropriate  antibiotics,  blood  products,  antiemetics,  fluids,  electrolytes,  and general  supportive  
care are to be used as clinically  indicated.  Diagnostic  studies  needed  for good  supportive  care 
should  be performed  as clinically  indicated.  Patients  who experience  indigestion  or 
gastroesophageal  reflux  symptoms  on vorinostat  may be treated  with Proton  Pump  Inhibitors  
(PPIs)  as well as H2 blockers  as clinically  indicated.  
9.9.2 Growth  factors  are not to be used routinely  in patients  on this  study. Administration  of filgrastim  
in patients  with serious  neutropenic  complications  such as sepsis  syndrome,  fungal  infection,  etc. 
may be administered  at the investigator’s  discretion.  Use of filgrastim  should  be discussed  with 
the Study  Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_683115], but should  only be administered  if clinically  
warranted.  
9.9.3 Use of corticosteroids  as anti-emetics  is contraindicated . 
9.9.4 There  is no  contraindication  to administration  of anti-emetics for  the subjects.  
9.9.5 Patients  will be permitted  to receive  appropriate  supportive  care measures  as deemed  necessary  
by [CONTACT_683177]:  
• Diarrhea:  Diarrhea  should  be treated  promptly  with appropriate  supportive  care,  including  
administration  of an anti-diarrheal  agent  according  to standard  practice  guidelines  for 
loperamide.  The anti-diarrheal  agent  loperamide  should  not be taken  prophylactically.  
Patients  should  be instructed  to begin  taking  the anti-diarrheal  agent  loperamide  at the first 
sign of: 1) poorly  formed  or loose  stool,  2) occurrence  of more  bowel  movements  than usual  
in one day or 3) unusually  high volume  of stool.  Loperamide  should  be taken  in  the 
following  manner:  [ADDRESS_925293] onset  of diarrhea,  then 2 mg after each unformed  stool.  The 
daily  dose of Loperamide  should  not exceed  16 mg/day.  Loperamide  should  be deferred  if 
blood  or mucus  is present  in the stool  or if diarrhea  is accompanied  by [CONTACT_411].  In this setting,  
appropriate  diagnostic  microbiologic  specimens  should  be obtained  to exclude  an infectious  
etiology.  Patients  should  also be advised  to drink  liberal  quantities  of clear  fluids  to help 
prevent dehydration.  
IRB:  10-096 A(8) 
Amended:  03/25/14  
- 39 -  
  
• Nausea/vomiting:  Nausea  and vomiting  should  be treated  aggressively,  and strong  
consideration  should  be given  to the administration  of prophylactic  antiemetic  therapy  
according  to standard  institutional  practice.  In particular,  the use of anti-emetics  including  
5HT3  antagonists  and/or  aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_683116].  Patients  should  be strongly  encouraged  to 
maintain  liberal  oral fluid intake  during  therapy,  especially  during  the initial  14 days of each 
treatment  cycle.  
 
• Anemia:  Transfusions  may be used as clinically  indicated  for the treatment  of anemia,  but 
should be clearly  noted  as concurrent  medications.  
• Neutropenia : Prophylactic  use of colony -stimulating  factors  including  G-CSF,  pegylated  G- 
CSF or GM-CSF should  not be used during  the first cycle  of therapy.  This must  be discussed  
with the Study  Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_683117].  
Factors  may be used if clinically  indicated  in subsequent  cycles  as outlined  in the guidelines  
for dose modification.  This must  be discussed with the Study  Principal  Investigator.  
• Thrombocytopenia : Transfusion  of platelets  may be used if clinically  indicated  in a manner  
consistent  with the guidelines  for dose modification.  
• Hyperglycemia:  Hyperglycemia  has been  observed  in patients  receiving  vorinostat.  Serum  
glucose  should  be monitored.  Adjustment  of diet and/or  anti-hyperglycemic  therapy  may be 
necessary.  
• Electrolyte  Disturbances : Hypokalemia  or hypomagnesemia  should  be corrected  prior  to 
administration  of vorinostat,  and consideration  should  be given  to monitoring  potassium  and 
magnesium  in symptomatic  patients  (e.g. patients  with nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  fluid 
imbalance  or cardiac  symptoms.)  
9.10 Duration of Therapy  
In the absence  of treatment  delays  due to adverse  events  and as long as the patient  has optimal  response  
(stable  disease  or greater),  treatment  may continue  up to 1 year or until one of the following  criteria  
applies:  
• Disease  progression  
• Intercurrent illness  that prevents  further  administration  of treatment,  
• Unacceptable  adverse  event(s)  
• Patient  decides  to withdraw from  the study  
• General  or specific  changes  in the patient's  condition  render  the patient  
unacceptable  for further treatment  in the judgment  of the investigator  
• Pregnancy  
 
9.[ADDRESS_925294] dose of protocol  therapy  will be required.  Patients  removed  from  study  for 
unacceptable  adverse  events  will be followed  until resolution  or stabilization  of the adverse  event.

Form  
9.13 Dosing  Delays/Dose  Modifications  
Therapy  will be held for patients  who experience ≥ grade 3 non-hematologic  toxicities related  to therapy  
until resolution  or return  to baseline.  If dosing is  delayed >3  weeks,  the patient  will be removed  from  
study.  
9.13.1  Dose  Modification  Plan (Phase  I Component  only)  
Patients  who experience  a DLT  may be retreated  with doses  of vorinostat  reduced  by [CONTACT_683178] a 
maximum  of [ADDRESS_925296]  resolved  prior  to re-treatment  at a lower  dose level.  Patients  who respond  to 
therapy  but experience  a DLT  may continue  to receive  vorinostat  at a lower  dose level  until intolerable  
toxicity  is encountered  or until the patient  experiences  progressive  disease  regardless  of the duration  of 
treatment.  
9.13.2  Dose  Modification  for Toxicity  Not Considered  to be DLT (Phase  I Component  only)  
Following  the occurrence  of any Grade  3 toxicity  with the exception  of neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia,  
leukopenia,  lymphopenia  and anemia  that does not constitute  a DLT,  vorinostat  will be held until there  
is resolution  to < Grade  [ADDRESS_925297]  of schedule  interruption  will be to reduce  the dose 
intensity  without  reducing  the total dose.  If dosing  is delayed  for > 3 weeks,  the patient  will be removed  
from  the study.  
 
10.0     EVALUATION DURING  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
Studies  required  for patients  enrolled  on this study  are summarized  in the table  below.  The following  
studies  will be performed  in all patients.  Cycle  1, week  1 complete  physical  exam,  laboratory  
evaluations and EKG evaluations do  not need to  be repeated  if completed  within  72 hours  of treatment.  
10.1 A complete  physical  examination  to be completed  weekly  and as clinically  indicated,  to include:  
vitals  (HR,  RR, BP, Temp),  and all  current  medications  will be documented.  
10.2 Height,  weight,  BSA,  and performance  status  will be collected  at the beginning  of each cycle  
IRB:  10-096 A(8) 
Amended:  03/25/14  
- 41 -  
  
prior  to receiving  treatment.  
10.3 The following  laboratory  studies  will be obtained  weekly:  complete  blood  count  w/diff,  PT/PTT  
(with  INR),  fibrinogen,  LDH,  chemistry  panel  including  the following  components:  albumin,  
alkaline  phosphatase,  total bilirubin,  bicarbonate,  BUN,  calcium,  chloride,  creatinine,  glucose,  
phosphorus,  potassium,  total protein,  SGOT(AST),  SGPT(ALT),  and sodium.  
10.[ADDRESS_925298]-treatment  samples  for correlative  studies  conducted  on peripheral  blood  and bone  marrow  
specimens  are described  below . 
10.5 An EKG  will be performed  prior  to every  cycle  of therapy. If  the EKG is performed  within  72 
hours of  starting  each cycle,  then a repeat  EKG does not need  to be performed.  
10.6 An extent  of disease  evaluation  should  be performed  to assess  the primary  tumor  and sites of 
metastatic  disease  including  radiologic  studies  appropriate  for the disease  (i.e. CT, MRI,  PET,  
bone scan, chest  x-ray, etc.) as defined  in section  12.0.  
Disease  assessment  must  be completed  at a POETIC  institution.  For collaborating  non-POETIC  
institutions,  the reviews  may be done  by [CONTACT_683179].  PET imaging  will  be 
obtained  as a correlative  study  in all patients  for whom  this imaging  study  is standard  of care 
and who have  PET capability  at their site. For these  patients,  it is recommended  that a baseline  
PET scan be performed  as part of the pre-treatment  extent  of disease  evaluation  and that the PET 
scan be repeated  after the second  cycle  of treatment  for this analysis.  While  these  scans  are 
recommended,  they are not required  for study entry.  
10.7 In the event  that a patient's  condition  is deteriorating  due to disease  progression,  laboratory  
evaluations  should  be repeated  within  [ADDRESS_925299] and all subsequent  
cycles of  therapy.

Evaluations in patients  who experience  treatment  delays  
In the event  of a treatment  delay,  the timetable  for the evaluations  above  will be modified  so that studies  
are performed  at the times  appropriate  relevant  to drug administration.  Height,  weight,  vital signs,  and 
performance  status  will be checked  and documented  during  weeks  in which  drug is administered.  The 
body  surface  area will be re-calculated  every  cycle  and the dose adjusted  if there  is a 10% change  in 
body  weight.  Physical  examinations  will also be performed  and documented  during  weeks  in which  drug 
is administered.  Laboratory  studies  as shown  in the table  will be performed  on a weekly  basis  during  
weeks  in which  drug is administered  and during  the following  weeks.  In the event  of treatment  delay,  
laboratory  studies  will be performed  at additional  time-points  as needed  for good  patient  care.  
Radiographic  assessments  will be performed  after every 2  cycles  of therapy.  
10.8     Correlative/Exploratory  Studies  
The study  will incorporate  biologic  correlative  studies  to evaluate  the following:  histone  acetylation,  
gene  expression  profiling,  and histone  phosphorylation  profiling.  It is hoped  that incorporation  of these  
correlative  studies  will enhance  our understanding  of histone  deacetylation  in pediatric  patients  with 
refractory  solid  tumors  treated  with the proposed  novel  combination,  vorinostat  and etoposide.  All 
correlative  studies are optional,  but are strongly  encouraged  to be collected.  
10.8.1  Histone  Acetylation  
The processing  of the peripheral  blood  and if possible  bone  marrow  samples  from  patients  with > 25% 
tumor  involvement  will be carried  out in the laboratory  of [CONTACT_683214]  at Ron Matricaria  Institute  
of Molecular  Medicine  at Phoenix  Children’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  an expert  in the molecular  pharmacology  of 
histone  acetylation.  [CONTACT_683215]  has an experienced  laboratory  for analysis  of histone  acetylation  and was 
a critical  collaborator  in the development  of vorinostat.  Processing  the samples  at [CONTACT_683215]’s  lab will 
ensure  consistent  sample  handling  and high quality  data.  Collection  of blood  and bone  marrow  is an 
important  part of this study  and whenever  possible  should  be collected  at the time points  indicated  
below.  
Sample Collection  Time  Points  
Five mL of peripheral  blood  and five mL of bone  marrow  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_683118]  (bone  marrow  
with > 25% tumor  involvement),  will be obtained  in a sodium  heparin  tube prior  to treatment  with 
Vorinostat  and Etoposide  and [ADDRESS_925303] dose of vorinostat  if consent  for this procedure  is 
obtained.

10.7.4  Positron  Emission  Tomography  (PET)  
Positron  emission  tomography  (PET)  will be incorporated  into this trial as a correlative  study  in patients  
with solid  tumors  to obtain  exploratory  data about  response  assessment  using  this imaging  modality  in 
pediatric  patients.  PET is a diagnostic  imaging  tool that evaluates  in vivo biologic  changes  using  
radiopharmaceuticals  that mimic  endogenous  molecules.  Accuracy  of tumor  assessment  has been  
enhanced  significantly  by [CONTACT_2329]  18F-fluorodeoxyglucose  ([18F]FDG)  PET for dynamic  imaging  of 
response  to a variety  of regimens  used for treatment  of adult  tumors.  There  is a paucity  of data regarding  
functional  imaging  in pediatric  patients.  A secondary  objective  of this study  will be to evaluate  
accumulation  prior  to and during  treatment  with vorinostat  and etoposide  in pediatric  patient  with solid  
malignancies.  
PET/CT  scans  will be done  at institutions  with the capability  to perform  this imaging  study.  The 
PET/CT  component  of this study  is not required  for enrollment  of patients  with solid  tumors.  Solid  
tumors  will be imaged  with PET/CT  at baseline  and following  completion  of the second  cycle  of 
therapy.  
The results  will be compared  to baseline  PET/CT  results.  The probability  of disease  progression  over 
time among  patients  with reduction  in the [18F]FDG  standardized  uptake  value  (SUV)  of 60% or greater  
will be estimated  using  the method  of Kaplan -Meier.  PET results  will not be used for assessment  of 
response  according  to RECIST  criteria  but will be used to achieve  the secondary  study  objective  to 
correlate alterations  in accumulation  of [18F]FDG  with tumor  response.  
The protocol  for PET/CT  imaging  is summarized  as follows:  Prior  to PET/CT  scanning,  patients  will 
fast for 6 hours  (except  for water).  A whole  body  PET/CT  scan will be carried  out per institutional  
protocol  for whole  body  evaluation  of extent  of disease  after 15 mCi/1.73  m2 [18F]FDG.  Patients  will be 
scanned  [ADDRESS_925313] component.  Emission  scans  are typi[INVESTIGATOR_683119]-thigh.  About  3 minute  acquisition  is carried  out per field of view  (~15 cm). 
Studies  are reconstructed  using  iterative  reconstruction  and using  the non-contrast  CT for attenuation  
correction.  Attenuation -corrected  PET images  are visualized  concurrently  with the CT component.  For 
the purpose  of this trial, interpreters  will not be blinded  as to clinical  or disease  state parameters.  Studies  
carried  out at baseline  (before  treatment)  and after 2 cycles  of treatment  with Vorinostat  and Etoposide

Amended:  03/25/[ADDRESS_925314] 
acquisition  parameters.  A standardized  uptake  value (SUV),  a semi -quantitative  measure  of tumor  
uptake  of the [18F]FDG  adjusted  for injected  dose and body  weight,  will be calculated  for each lesion.  
The method  for calculating  tumor  uptake  is by a differential  uptake  ratio of FDG  in the tumor.  It is 
defined  as the ratio of the activity  per gram  within  the lesion  to the activity  per gram  if the activity  were  
uniformly  distributed  through  the whole  patient.  See equation  below.  
 
SUV = activity/gram  ( lesion )  
activity  injected/body  weight  
The SUV  is obtained  from  the PET scanner  directly  for any region  drawn  on a PET scan image.  In more  
depth,  the numerator  in the above  equation  is obtained  from  a region  drawn  around  the lesion  on one of 
the PET slices.  The PET scanner  is calibrated  in units  of activity  per unit volume,  and therefore  this 
number  is obtained  automatically.  This calibration  is performed  by [CONTACT_683180],  using  a cylinder  of 
water  into which  an exactly  known  amount  of FDG  has been  added.  A PET scan of this cylinder  is used 
to determine  a calibration  factor  which  converts  the counts  from  the PET scanner  directly  into activity  
per unit volume.  The denominator  is the activity  injected  into the patient  divided  by [CONTACT_683181].  
These  numbers  are entered  into the PET scanner  computer  by [CONTACT_267313].  Hence  the scanner  is 
already  calibrated  to provide  SUVs.  SUV  is a semi -quantitative  measure  of selective  tracer  uptake  
within  lesions  that is independent  of the PET scanner  upon  which  it is performed  and therefore  does not 
vary from  center  to center.  
Interpretation  of changes  will follow  visual  scores  (0: no uptake;  1: uptake  equal  to soft tissue;  2: uptake  
greater  than soft tissue,  equal  to liver;  3: uptake  greater  than liver)  and standardized  uptake  value  (SUV),  
which  will be normalized  both to overall  patient weight  and to body surface  area.

12.1 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
Response  in patients  with measurable  disease  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_683182].  For the purposes  of 
this study,  patients  with solid  tumors  should  be reevaluated  every  2 cycles  ( > 4 and < [ADDRESS_925315] cycle  of treatment).  In addition  to a baseline  scan,  confirmatory  scans  will also be 
obtained  [ADDRESS_925316]  guideline  (version   1.1).[55]  Changes   in  only  the largest   diameter  (unidimensional

- 48 -  
  
measurement)  of the tumor  lesions  are used in the RECIST  guideline.  Note:  Lesions  are either  
measurable  or non-measurable  using  the criteria  provided  below.  The term “evaluable”  in reference  to 
measurability  will not be used because  it does not provide additional  meaning  or accuracy.  
 
 
 
12.2.[ADDRESS_925317] one dimension  
(longest  diameter  in the  plane of  measurement  is to be recorded)  with a minimum  size of: 
 
• [ADDRESS_925318] scan (CT scan slice thickness  no greater  than 5 mm.)  
• 10 mm caliper  measurement  by [CONTACT_40133]  (lesions  which  cannot  be accurately  measured  
with calipers  should be recorded  as non-measurable).  
• [ADDRESS_925319]  be recorded  in millimeters (or decimal  fractions  of centimeters).  
Malignant  lymph  nodes:  To be considered  pathologically  enlarged  and measurable,  a lymph  node  must  
be > [ADDRESS_925320] scan (CT scan slice thickness  recommended  to be no 
greater  than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short  axis will be measured  and followed.  
 
12.2.2  Non-measurable  Disease  
All other  lesions,  including  small  lesions  (longest  diameter  < 10 mm or pathological  lymph  nodes  with > 
10 to < 15 mm short  axis)  as well as truly  non-measurable  lesions.  Lesions  considered  truly  non- 
measurable  include:  leptomeningeal  disease,  ascites,  pleural  or pericardial  effusion,  inflammatory  breast  
disease,  lymphangitic  involvement  of skin or lung,  abdominal  masses/  abdominal  organomegaly  
identified  by [CONTACT_683183].  
 
12.2.3  Target  Lesions  
All measurable  lesions  up to a maximum  2 lesions  per organ  and 5 lesions  in total,  representative  of all 
involved  organs,  should  be identified  as target  lesions  and recorded  and measured  at baseline.  Target  
lesions  should  be selected  on the basis  of their size (lesions  with the longest  diameter),  be representative  
of all involved  organs,  and should  be those  that are suitable  for reproducible  repeated  measurement  
(either  by [CONTACT_683184]).  If the largest  lesion  does not lend to reproducible  
measurement,  the next largest  lesion  which  can be measured  reproducibly  should  be used.  A sum of 
diameters  (longest  for non-nodal  lesions,  short  axis for nodal  lesions)  for all target  lesions  will be 
calculated  and reported  as the baseline  sum diameters.  If lymph  nodes  are to be included  in the sum,  
only the short  axis is added  to the sum.  The baseline  sum diameters  will be used as a reference  to further  
characterize any objective  tumor  regression  in the measurable dimension  of the disease.  
12.2.4  Non-target Lesions  
All other  lesions  (or sites of disease)  should  be identified  as non-target  lesions  and should  also be 
recorded  at baseline.  Measurements  of these lesions are not required,  but the presence or absence  of each 
IRB:  10-096 A(8) 
Amended:  03/25/[ADDRESS_925321]  multiple  non- target  lesions  involving  the same  organ  as single  item (e.g. multiple  
pelvic  lesions).  
 
 
 
12.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable  Disease  
All measurements  should  be taken  and recorded  in metric  notation  using  a ruler  or calipers.  All baseline  
evaluations  should  be performed  as closely  as possible  to the beginning  of treatment  and never  more  
than 4 weeks  before  the beginning  of the treatment.  Tumors  in a previously  irradiated  area will be 
considered  measurable.  
The same  method  of assessment  and the same  technique  should  be used to characterize  each identified  
and reported  lesion  at baseline  and during  follow -up. Imaging  based  evaluation  should  always  be done  
rather  than clinical  examination  unless  the lesion(s)  being  followed  cannot  be imaged  but are assessable  
by [CONTACT_461].  
Clinical  lesions:  Clinical  lesions  will only be considered  measurable  when  they are superficial  and > 10 
mm diameter  as assessed  using  calipers  (e.g. skin nodules).  For the case of skin lesions,  documentation  
by [CONTACT_625802]  a ruler to estimate  the size of the lesion  is suggested.  As noted  above,  
when  lesions  can be  evaluated  by [CONTACT_683185],  imaging  evaluation  should  be 
undertaken  since  it is more  objective and may also be reviewed  at the  end of the study.  
Chest  X-ray: Chest  CT is preferred  over chest  X-ray, particularly  when  progression  is an important  
endpoint,  since  CT is more  sensitive  than X-ray, particularly  in identifying  new lesions.  However,  
lesions  on chest  X-ray may be considered  measurable  if they are clearly  defined  and surrounded  by 
[CONTACT_28638].  
CT, MRI:  CT is the best currently  available  and reproducible  method  to measure  lesions  selected  for 
response  assessment.  This guideline  has defined  measurability  of lesions  on CT scan based  on the 
assumption  that CT slice thickness  is [ADDRESS_925322] slice thickness  greater  than 5 
mm, the minimum  size for a measurable  lesion  should be twice  the slice thickness.  MRI is also  
acceptable in  certain  situations (e.g. for body scans).  
Ultrasound:  Ultrasound  is not useful  in assessment  of lesion  size and should  not be used as a method  of 
measurement.  Ultrasound  examinations  cannot  be reproduced  in their entirety  for independent  review  at 
a later date and, because  they are operator  dependent,  it cannot  be guaranteed  that the same  technique  
and measurements  will be taken  from  one assessment  to the next.  If new lesions  are identified  by 
[CONTACT_683186],  confirmation  by [CONTACT_435999].  If there  is concern  about  
radiation  exposure  at CT, MRI  may be used instead  of CT in selected  instances.  
Endoscopy,  laparoscopy:  The utilization  of these  techniques  for objective  tumor  evaluation  is  not 
advised.  However,  they can be useful  to confirm  complete  pathological  response  when  biopsies  are 
obtained  or to determine  relapse  in trials  where  recurrence  following  complete  response  or surgical  
resection  is an endpoint.  
Tumor  markers:  Tumor  markers  alone  cannot  be used to assess  objective  tumor  response.  If markers  are 
IRB:  10-096 A(8) 
Amended:  03/25/[ADDRESS_925323]  normalize  for a patient  to be considered  in 
complete  response.  Because  tumor  markers  are disease  specific,  instructions  for their measurement  
should be incorporated  into protocols  on a disease  specific  basis.  
Cytology,  histology:  These  techniques  can be used to differentiate  between  PR and CR in rare cases  if 
required  by [CONTACT_990]  (for example,  residual  lesions  in tumor  types  such as germ  cell tumors,  where  
known  residual  benign  tumors  can remain).  When  effusions  are known  to be a potential  adverse  effect  of 
treatment  (e.g. with certain  taxane compounds  or angiogenesis  inhibitors),  the cytological  confirmation  of 
the neoplastic  origin  of any effusion  that appears  or worsens  during  treatment  can be considered  if the 
measurable  tumor  has met criteria  for response  or stable  disease  in order  to  differentiate   between  
response  (or stable  disease)  and progressive  disease.  
 
12.4 Response  Criteria  for Patients  with  Solid Tumors  
12.4.1  Evaluation  of Target  Lesions  
 
Complete  Response  (CR):  Disappearance  of all target  lesions.  Any pathological  lymph  nodes  
(whether target  or non-target)  must  have  reduction  in short  axis to 
<10 mm. 
 
Partial  Response  (PR):  At least a  30%  decrease   in  the  sum  of  the  diameters   of  target  
lesions,  taking  as reference  the baseline  sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease  (PD):  At least a 20% increase  in the sum of  the  diameters   of  target  
lesions,  taking  as reference  the smallest  sum on study  (this includes  
the baseline  sum if that is the smallest  on study).  In addition  to the 
relative  increase  of 20%,  the sum must  also demonstrate  an absolute  
increase  of at least 5 mm. (Note:  the appearance  of one  or more  new 
lesions  is also considered  progression)  
 
Stable  Disease  (SD):  Neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to qualify  for PR nor sufficient  increase  
to qualify  for PD, taking  as reference  the smallest  sum diameters  
while  on study.  
 
12.4.2  Evaluation  of Non -target Lesions  
 
Complete  Response  (CR):  Disappearance  of all non-target  lesions  and normalization  of tumor  
marker  level.  All lymph  nodes  must  be non-pathological  in size (< 
10 mm short axis)  
 
NonCR/NonPD:  Persistence  of one or more  non-target  lesion(s)  and/or  maintenance  
of tumor  marker  level above  the normal  limits  
 
Progressive Disease  (PD):  Unequivocal  progression  of existing  non-target  lesions.  (Note:  the 
IRB:  10-096 A(8) 
Amended:  03/25/14  
- 51 -  
  
appearance   of  the  one  or  more   new  lesions  is  also  considered  
progression.)  
 
Although  a clear  progression  of “non -target”  lesions  only is exceptional,  in such circumstances  the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_683120],  and the progression status  should be  confirmed  at a later 
time by [CONTACT_683187].  
Note:  If tumor  markers  are initially  above  the upper  normal  limit,  they must  normalize  for a patient  to be 
considered  in complete  clinical response.  
 
12.4.[ADDRESS_925324] response  recorded  from  the start of the treatment  until the end of 
treatment  taking  into account  any requirement  for confirmation.  The patient's  best response  assignment  
will depend  on the achievement  of both measurement  and confirmation  criteria  (Section  12.3 and 
Section  12.4)  
 
Target  Lesions  Non-target  
Lesions  New  Lesions  Overall  Response  
CR CR No CR 
CR Non-CR/non -PD No PR 
CR Not evaluated  No PR 
PR Non-PD or not all 
evaluated  No PR 
SD Non-PD or not all 
evaluated  No SD 
Not all evaluated  Non-PD No NE 
PD Any Yes or No PD 
Any PD Yes or No PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
 
Note:  
Patients  with a global  deterioration  of health  status  requiring  discontinuation  of treatment  without  
objective  evidence  of disease  progression  at that time should  be classified  as having  “symptomatic  
deterioration.”  Every  effort  should  be made  to document  the objective  progression,  even  after 
discontinuation  of treatment.  
In some  circumstances,  it may be difficult  to distinguish  residual  disease  from  normal  tissue.  When  the 
IRB:  10-096 A(8) 
Amended:  03/25/14  
- 52 -  
  
evaluation  of complete  response  depends  on this determination,  it is recommended  that the residual  
lesion be investigated  (fine needle  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy)  before  confirming  the complete  response  status.

weeks.  
12.5.2  Duration  of Overall  Response  
The duration  of overall  response  is measured  from  the time measurement  criteria  are met for CR or PR 
(whichever  is first recorded)  until the first date that recurrent  or progressive  disease  is objectively  
documented  (utilizing  as reference  for progressive  disease  the smallest  measurements  recorded  since  the 
treatment  started).  
The duration  of overall  CR is measured  from  the time measurement  criteria  are first met for CR until the 
first date that recurrent  disease is objectively  documented.

14.1 BIOSTATISTICS  
14.2 Study  Design/Endpoints  
14.2.1  Phase  I Component  
This trial is a Phase  I evaluation  of vorinostat  and etoposide  with the starting  dose and schedule  as 
described  in Section  9.3 The primary  study  endpoints  will be assessment  of toxicity  based  upon  the 
determination  of toxicity  profile  of the combination  and determination  of the MTD,  DLT,  and RP2D.  A 
IRB:  10-096 A(8) 
Amended:  03/25/[ADDRESS_925327] cycle  (3 weeks)  of therapy.  Dose  escalation  will not be considered  until at least [ADDRESS_925328] completed  one course  of therapy  (e.g. 3 weeks)  without  a DLT.  If a 
patient  does not experience  a DLT  as defined  in Section  9.7 but is taken  off study  due to unacceptable  
adverse  events/toxicity,  that patient  will be considered  to have  had a DLT  for the purposes  of dose 
escalation.  If therapy  is discontinued  during  the first cycle  for reasons  other  than toxicity,  an additional  
patient  may be enrolled  at the dose level  of the off-study  patient  to ensure  adequate  evaluation  of 
toxicity.  
The following  design  will be used to determine  the MTD.  Patients  will be treated  in cohorts  of size [ADDRESS_925329]  dose level  
with an observed  incidence  of DLT  in no more  than 1 out of 6 patients  treated  at a particular  dose level.  
The dose escalation  scheme  is as follows:  
 
1) If none  of initial  3 patients  at a given  dose level  experience  DLT,  the next dose level  is studied  
in another  cohort  of 3 patients.  
 
2) If 1 of the initial  3 patients  at a given  dose level  experience  DLT,  up to 3 additional  patients  
will be treated  at that same  dose level.  Escalation  will continue  if one of the six patients  
experience DLT.  
 
3) If two or three  patients  experience  DLT  in the first three  patients,  or two or more  patients  
experience  DLT  in six patients  at a given  dose level,  the MTD  will be determined  as the 
preceding  dose level.  
 
4) If three  or fewer  patients  are treated  at a dose under  consideration  as the MTD,  additional  
patients  to total six will be treated  at that level  to confirm  the MTD.  
 
The dose escalation  scheme  provides  the following  probabilities  of escalation  based  on the true chances  
of DLT  at a specific  dose level.  One can see that the probability  of escalation  is high if  the toxicity  risks 
are low. 
 
True  Probability  of Toxicity:  .10 .20 .30 .40 .50 .60 
Probability  of Escalation:  .91 .71 .49 .31   .17 .08 
 
When  the MTD  is reached,  the additional  cohort  of 3 patients  will be recruited  at this dose to allow  for 
greater  confidence  in estimating  the toxicity  rate in this patient  population  (RP2D).  If none  of the 9 
patients  treated  at the MTD  experience  a DLT,  then we are 90% confident  that the probability  of a toxic  
event  in this patient  population  is less than 0.23.  However,  if 3 or more  DLTs  are observed,  the 
approximate  95% lower  confidence  bound  on the probability  of a DLT  is 0.12,  indicating  unacceptable  
toxicity.  If 3 or more  DLTs  occur  in 9 patients,  we will recommend  the next lower  dose level  for further  
evaluation  of this therapy,  which  would  then be the recommended  Phase  II dose.  This trial will require  a

Amended:  03/25/14

minimum  of 2 patients.  The maximum  number  of patients  needed  depends  on the dose level  reached.  An 
interim  safety  analysis  of the data in the Phase  I component  will be completed  prior  to starting  the Phase  
II component.  Although  not a primary  objective  of this portion  of the study,  proportion  of patients  with 
response will be calculated.  
 
14.2.2  Phase  II Component  
The primary  endpoint  of this component  will be to evaluate  the efficacy  of the novel  combination,  
vorinostat  and etoposide,  in the treatment  of recurrent  or refractory  childhood  malignancies  with 
recurrent  or refractory  sarcoma.  Efficacy  is defined  as a binary  endpoint  (CR+PR  versus  neither)  after 2 
cycles  of treatment.  We will use a minimax  Simon  two-stage  design.  Treatment  of pediatric  solid  tumors  
with etoposide  only results  in approximately  20% response  rate, however  the disease  type specific  
response  rates  are variable  (osteosarcoma  9%, soft tissue  sarcoma  8%, rhabdomyosarcoma  19%,  and 
Ewing’s  sarcoma  40%).  These  4 disease  groups  account  for 20-30%,  10-20%,  30% and 30% of pediatric  
sarcomas  respectively.  Due to highly  variable  response  rates  and possible  variability  in number  of 
recruited  patients  with specific  sarcoma  type,  we have  chosen  an unpromising  overall  response rate to be 
15%.  The promising  response  rate is 35%.  Initially  we will recruit  [ADDRESS_925330] a positive  result.  If there  are 7 or fewer  
responses,  the combination  therapy  will be considered  unpromising  for further  study.  The design  allows  
early  termination  of the study  due to inefficacy.  The probability  of early  termination  is 60% if the true 
treatment  response  is 15%.  This design  will effectively  discriminate  between  true response  rates  of 
<15%  and >35%  with a type I error  of 5% and power  of 80%. Upon  the completion  of the study, the true 
response  rate will be estimated  as an observed  rate, and the exact  confidence  interval  will be 
constructed.  Response  rate within  different  sarcoma  types will also be calculated.  
 
14.3 Sample  Size/Accrual  Rate  
14.3.1  Phase  I Component  
Review  of data from  the participating  institutions  regarding  numbers  of relapsed  patients  as well as 
accrual  to Phase  I studies  indicates  that 2-3 patients  per month  may be accrued.  It is anticipated  that 18- 
25 patients  will be accrued.  This will permit  completion  of the study  within  1 year.  Upon  completion  of 
the phase  I component,  an interim  safety  analysis  will be performed  before  determination  of the 
recommended  Phase  II dose of  the combination.  
 
14.3.2  Phase  II Component  
Review  of data from  the participating  institutions  regarding  numbers  of relapsed  patients  as well as 
accrual  to Phase  I studies  indicates  that 2-3 patients  per month  may be accrued.  It is anticipated  
approximately  28 patients  will be accrued.  This will permit  completion  of the study within  1 year 
 
 
 
14.4 Correlative Analysis

- 55 -  
  
This study  will incorporate  biologic  correlative  analyses  conducted  in the phase  I and II setting  to 
evaluate  the following:  histone  acetylation,  gene expression  profiling  and cellular  phosphorylation  
profiling.  These  markers  will be correlated  with tumor  response  and clinical  characteristics  using  
Wilcoxon  rank sum test for continuous  variables  and Fisher  exact  test for binary  variables.  Descriptive  
statistics  will be used  to summarize  the data at different  time points.  
A standardized  uptake  value  (SUV),  a semi -quantitative  measure  of tumor  uptake  of the [18F]FDG  
adjusted  for injected  dose and body  weight,  will be calculated  for each lesion  using  PET scan.  The 
association  of SUV with  tumor  response will be tested  using  Wilcoxon  rank sum  test. 
 
14.5 Exploratory  Analysis  of symptom distress  survey  
It is expected  that ¾ of all  patients  will be of the  age 10-18 and will participate  in the MSAS  exploratory  
studies.  The Statistical  Package  for the Social  Sciences  (SPSS,  Version  17 for Windows)  will be used to 
analyze  the data regarding  symptom  distress.  To test the research  question  in this study,  the total MSAS  
scores  and their subscales  will be used.  Descriptive  statistics  like mean,  median  and inter-quartile  range  
will be calculated  and compared  across  time.  All variables  will be examined  for outliers  through  
frequency  distributions,  measures  of central  tendency  and skewness.  Although  comparisons  will be 
made  at each time point,  the primary  time points  for evaluation  are at baseline  and at the time of the first 
three  radiographic  evaluations.  Intraclass  correlation  (ICC)  of the MSAS  will be used to calculate  the 
test.

Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center.  Registrations  will be handled  by [CONTACT_126321]  
(RSA)  at the POETIC  DCC.  The contact  [CONTACT_683189] (646)  888-5714/5715  and the fax number  
is (646)  888-5726.  Registrations  will occur  between  9:00 am and  5:[ADDRESS_925331]  Time  (EST),  
Monday  through  Friday  and will include  review  of the signed  consent  form,  HIPAA  research  
authorization  form,  eligibility  checklist,  and eligibility  source  documentation.  The RSA  will also verify,  
via a FAX/email  copy,  that the written  informed  consent  is obtained  and dated  prior  to subject  entry  on 
the study.  
The participating  site must  contact  [CONTACT_683190] a slot on  the protocol  when  a 
patient  is being  considered  for a trial. To begin  a registration,  the participating  site must  fax/email  the 
signed  consent  form  and HIPAA  research  authorization  to the RSA  within  [ADDRESS_925332],  and eligibility  source

research  tests.  
All research  participants  are registered  through  the Protocol  Participant  Registration  (PPR)  Office  at 
Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  by [CONTACT_683191].  PPR is available  Monday  through  Friday  
from  8:30 am - 5:[ADDRESS_925334]  be sent 
directly  to the DCC  prior  to 4:00 PM to ensure  timely  processing,  so that enough  time is allowed  for 
source  verification.  If a registration  is sent to the DCC  after 4:00PM,  all efforts  will be made  to have the 
patient  registered  that day, but it  cannot  be guaranteed  that a patient  will be registered  that day.  
Once  eligibility  has been  established  and the participant  is registered,  the participant  will be assigned  an 
MSKCC  Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  number  (protocol  participant  number).  This number  is 
unique  to the participant  and must  be written  on all data and correspondence  for the participant.  This 
protocol  participant  number  will be relayed  back  to study  staff at the registering  site via e-mail and will 
serve as  the enrollment  confirmation.  
Written  consent  must  be documented  on the appropriate  consent  form  and Research  Authorization  
designated  and approved  by [CONTACT_683192].  The following  Principal  Investigators  or their designated  Co-Investigators  may obtain informed

real-time monitoring  can be accomplished.  Queries  will be generated  by [CONTACT_683196],  and prompt  responses  are requested  back  to the DCC.  Internal  audits  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_219001].  Audits  may be accomplished  in one of two ways:  (1) source  documents  and research  records  for 
selected  patients  are brought  from  participating  sites to the DCC  for audit,  or (2) selected  patient  records  
may be audited  on-site at participating  sites.  These  audits  will be performed  by [CONTACT_683197].  During  these  audits  the 
following  activities  will take  place:  
 
 Review regulatory  binders  for protocol  documentation;  
 Ensure  that case report  forms  are source data verified  according  to the monitoring  plan;  
 Verify  drug accountability  is complete  and accurate; and 
 Verify  compliance  to GCPs,  ICH guidelines,  FDA regulations,  and applicable  SOPs.  
 
If there  is ever an audit  at the DCC,  then the DCC  is responsible  for having  all source  documents,  
research  records,  all IRB approval  documents,  Drug  Accountability  Record  Forms,  patient  registration  
lists, response  assessments  scans, x-rays,  etc. available  for the audit.  
 
16.7 Data  and Safety Monitoring  
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  under  the direction  of [CONTACT_683219]  and 
Bonnie  Edelman,  Manager, will be responsible  for monitoring  the data safety  of the open  and closed  to 
accrual  protocols  sponsored  by [CONTACT_200994].  The DSMC  meets  quarterly,  and will review data quarterly,  
semi  annually  or annually  based on the risk level of the protocol.  A copy of  the MSKCC Data  and 
Safety  Monitoring  Plans is on file at the Data and Coordinating  Center.  
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  were  initially  
created  and approved  by [CONTACT_40137]  2001.  The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  
were  established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_40138].  The plans  address  the new 
policies  set forth  by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute  for Data 
and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials”  which  can be found  at:  
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/clinicaltrials/conducting/dsm -guidelines . The MSKCC  Data and Safety  
Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at: http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm . 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  monitors  all Phase  I and II clinical  trials  and 
reports  to the Research  Council  and Institutional Review Board.  
16.8 Therapeutic  Response  Review  
The Therapeutic  Response  Review  Committee  (TRRC)  is MSKCC’s  independent  response review  
committee  which  annually  evaluates  therapeutic  responses  for participants  in IRB/PB  approved  clinical  
trials  where therapeutic  efficacy  is a stated  primary  objective,  typi[INVESTIGATOR_683126].  The 
process,  done  in an unbiased  blinded  fashion,  ensures  the data from  the institution’s  therapeutic  trials  
clinical  research  program  is verified  and vetted.  Studies  monitored  by [CONTACT_683198]-NIH,  in- 
house,  industrial  trials,  and multi -center  trials  where  MSKCC  is the coordinating  center,  which  are not 
reviewed  by [CONTACT_683199].  
MSKCC’s   TRRC   review  will  serve   as  the  committee   that  may  review  and  confirm   responses  of 
IRB:  10-096 A(8)

Note : Vorinostat  (SAHA)  in combination  with other  agents  could  cause  an exacerbation  of any adverse  
event  currently  known  to be caused  by [CONTACT_642657],  or the combination  may result  in events  never  
previously  associated  with either  agent.  
The effects  of vorinostat  on a fetus  and reproductive  organs  have  not been  studied  and are therefore  
unknown.  It is not known  whether  vorinostat  can cause  teratogenic  changes  to the fetus  or the 
consequences  to an unborn  child.  Patients  who are pregnant  or nursing,  planning  to become  pregnant  or 
to father  a child  are not permitted  to enroll  on this study.  Women  of childbearing  potential  must  have a 
negative  pregnancy  test before  the start of treatment  on the  study.  
An adequate  form  of contraception  must  be used by [CONTACT_683203].  It is recommended  that two forms  of birth  control  be used 
simultaneously  unless  abstinence  is the chosen method.

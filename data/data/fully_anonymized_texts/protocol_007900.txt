Research Plan  
I. Specific Aims  
 
Specific Aim 1:  To assess the feasibility, safety and preliminary efficacy of 
individualized, biomarker-guided corticosteroid dosing compared to usual care in 
critically ill patients with community acquired pneumonia and acute hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]. We hypothesize that , compared to usual care;  individualized, 
biomarker-guided corticosteroid dosing will lead to: 
• Lower cumulative exposure to corticosteroids 
• Lower incidence of adverse events (hyperglycemia, delirium, and nosocomial 
infections) 
• Improvement in pulmonary organ function based on requirements for oxygen and advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] 
• Reduced hospi[INVESTIGATOR_752575], to refine the trial intervention and endpoints,  and to calculate target sample sizes in preparation for a larger pragmatic clinical trial comparing the two approaches to corticosteroid administration . 
  
Specific Aim 2:  To evaluate the trajectories of C -reactive prot ein (CRP), 
pulmonary and non-pulmonary organ failures over time in patients from the two study arms .  
 
In addition to assessing the feasibility of individualized, biomarker guided steroid dosing, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_752576] a predictive 
enrichment  tool in identifying patients in whom steroid administration will be most 
beneficial and also as a prognostic enrichment tool (alongside severity of pulmonary 
and other organ failures) to identify patients at higher risk of poor outcomes. It will inform the target population and will help refine the thresholds for initiation, titration and discontinuation of individualized corticosteroid therapy used to reduce 
inflammation in patients with pneumonia and acute hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_752577] 3:  To evaluate the role of a biomarker -titrated adjuvant corticosteroid 
administration compared to usual care in patients admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_752578] -
V 2 (COVID -19) infection. We hypothesize that , compared to usual care, 
individualized biomarker- titrated dosing will be associated with:  
a) Improvement in pulmonary organ function based on requirements for oxygen 
and advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] 
3  1/4/2021
  
 b) Reduced hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] 
c) Reduced cardiovascular complications including evidence of myocardial 
injury, need for inotropes and new/worsening arrhythmias  
 
 
II. Background and Significance  
Pneumonia and acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS), are common causes of hypoxemic 
respi [INVESTIGATOR_1399], morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU)(1). Although 
outcomes from these conditions have improved in recent decades, in part due to improved organ support, earlier antimicrobial treatment and the prevention of iatrogenic lung injury from lung-injurious ventilator practices (2), the impact of pneumonia and ARDS on patient outcomes remains substantial. While inflammation is a hallmark pathologic feature of both pneumonia and 
ARDS, the pharmacological treatment of these conditions with corticosteroids and other anti-
inflammatory medications is controversial, and clinical practice remains heterogeneous.  
Observational and clinical trial data show almost 50% of patients with acute hypoxemic 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_752579] (3). Steroid prescribing practices are highly 
variable due to uncertainty regarding who will benefit, and whether concomitant processes such as chronic obstructive pulmonary dise ase (COPD) or septic shock are present. While smaller 
trials suggested possible beneficial effects of corticosteroid use on patient mortality and 
ventilator use (4) (5), other trials suggested potential adverse effects (6). A meta -analysis of 
clinical trials of corticosteroids in ARDS did not show benefit, although subgroup analyses 
suggested there may be benefit in those who received modest doses of corticosteroids early in the disease course (7).  Recent SCCM/ESICM guidelines cautiously recommend the use of corticost eroids in community acquired pneumonia and in ARDS (8). A 5−7 days duration at a 
daily dose of 1 mg/kg IV methylprednisolone equivalent has been recommended for pneumonia while a higher dose and longer duration has been recommended for patients meeting ARDS criteria (2 mg/kg/day IV methylprednisolone equivalent followed by [CONTACT_752607] 13 days).   
A major barrier to the more precise and informed use of corticosteroids in patients with 
pneumonia and ARDS is clinicians’ inability to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_752580]- inflammatory medications. Increased levels of pro -inflammatory mediators 
are a prominent feature in many patients with pneumonia and ARDS, and distinct hyper-inflammatory endophenotypes have been recently described(9). Prior studies have analyzed the effect of steroids on inflammatory biomarkers in ARDS including C- reactive protein (CRP) 
which is easily available in the clinical setting and can be completed quickly compared to other 
biomarkers that are difficult to obtain outside research setting.(10, 11)  More recently, studies 
investigating the treatment of pneumonia have utilized CRP to enrich a population that may benefit from corticosteroids. (12) This enrichment strategy suggested that patients with a high 
4  1/4/2021
  
 inflammatory response (pneumonia with an admitting CRP > 150 mg/L) may benefit from 
modest dose corticosteroid admini stration. While the clinical practice guidelines specifically 
state that lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_752581] (13) 
they recommend arbitrary dosing regimens irrespective of the degree of inflammation(8).  
Our objective is to better understand the role of steroids in pneumonia and ARDS, and to test the 
hypothesis that a precise, individualized steroid dosing algorithm will be more effective and safer 
than standard treatment recommended by [CONTACT_752608] (8). Therefore we 
propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], prospective, single- center clinical trial to compare a biomarker -driven 
individualized dosing algorithm to a guideline- based fixed -dose algorithm in emergency room 
patients with pneumonia and acute hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_752582].  
In response to the emerging COVID-19 (SARS Co-V 2) pandemic, we additionally propose 
evaluating the role of biomarker-titrated adjuvant corticosteroid dosing in patients with COVID-
19. Limited data exists regarding the role of corticosteroids in this setting, and no biomarker-titrated steroid administration has been studied. In a report of 149 patients with COVID-19 in China, 82 had elevated CRP
(14). However, just 5 patients received corticosteroids in this cohort. 
In a larger cohort of 1099 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, 204 patients received 
steroids, with a higher percentage among those with severe disease than non- severe disease 
(44.5% vs. 13.7%)(15). Relative survival of those who received steroids versus those who did not 
was not reported. In another series of 52 patients with severe COVID-19 infection in China, 
corticosteroids were administered in 30 patients (58%)(16). Survivors were more likely to receive 
steroids compared to non-survivors (70% versus 50%).  
Furthermore, t here is mounting evidence of cardiovascular complications of SARS-CoV-2 
infection including acute myocardial injury, shock and arrhythmias associated with worse 
outcomes(17). Potential mechanisms of these compl ications in  SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_1030398] myocardial toxicity/myocarditis  thus r ational therapeutic options should include anti-
inflammatory agents like corticosteroids, antiviral agents, and management of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]. 
Given the limited evidence of adjuvant steroid dosing in this setting, and the absence of any proven treatments for COVID-19, there is an urgent need to evaluate any potential therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
 
III. Progress Report and Preliminary Studies  
We performed a retrospective review of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at 
Mayo Clinic, [COMPANY_002]ster with pneumonia and acute hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]. In this group, 
we described current corticosteroid prescribi ng practices, and compared the efficacy and safety 
of steroid administration that is biomarker concordant (i.e. patients with a markedly elevated 
5  1/4/2021
  
 CRP/procalcitonin who were treated with steroids or patients with a low CRP/procalcitonin who 
were not treated  with corticosteroids), versus treatment that was biomarker -discordant. The 
threshold for an elevated CRP was 150mg/L and the threshold for an elevated procalcitonin was 
2.2ng/ml. After adjusting for severity of illness, early (within 12 hours of ICU admission) steroid 
administration in patients with pneumonia or ARDS was associated with decreased persistence or progression of pulmonary and other organ failures, reduced hospi[INVESTIGATOR_752583](table 1). Patients with  biomarker-concordant and biomarker-
discordant corticosteroid treatment had similar baseline severity of illness. Biomarker -
concordant corticosteroid treatment was associated with faster recovery of hypoxemia (table 2). No significant differences in mortality or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/ICU length of stay were seen between the biomarker-concordant versus the biomarker discordant group.

Definitions  
Pneumonia is defined as an acute infection of the lung parenchyma that is associated with clinical 
symptoms of community acquired pneumonia (cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea) and a new radiographic infiltrate
(18). ARDS complicating community acquired pneumonia will be 
defined in accordance with the Berlin Definition as acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_216851] a PaO 2/FiO 2 ratio 
< 300 and the need for positive end expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] > 5 mmHg and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates within 1 week of the diagnosis of community organized pneumonia 
(19).  
Suspected COVID -19 defined as anyone in whom COVID -19 testing is requested  
Confirmed  COVID- 19 is defined as a patient with positive COVID -19 PCR on either 
nasopharyngeal swab or microbiological testing from lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_752588] (e.g. tracheal secretions, bronchial washings, bronchoalveolar lavage).

individualized biomarker -concordant arm. Patients will be eligible for inclusion if they have 
received an initial dose of steroids by [CONTACT_511402]. In this situation they would either be 
randomized to usual care (continued steroid administration at discretion of primary service) or the individualized CRP -guided protocol outlined in Table 3.  
In the individualized, biomarker -concordant arm , all patients will re ceive steroids once at the time 
of admission, then a daily morning dose  In order to account for varying turnaround time at 
different laboratories, CRP levels will be drawn with early morning labs , and used to determine the 
steroid dosing for the day. Patie nts will receive daily CRP measurements for the first 5 days of the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. S teroid administration will be facilitated using 
standardized computerized physician order entry.  S teroid order sets will include 6 hourly point of 
care glucose monitoring, and an insulin sliding scale for glucose levels to facilitate glucose management. The need for insulin drip will be determined by [CONTACT_1963]. Additional testing including serum and urine ketones will be informed by [CONTACT_752609], serum anion gap and bicarbonate levels in routine basic metabolic panels and determined by [CONTACT_1963]. Glucose levels, new or worsening infections within 30 days of start of steroid (positive 
blood/sputum/urine culture) an d Confusion A ssessment Method in the ICU will be documented in 
case report forms.  
In the usual  care arm , patients  will receive daily CRP measurements for the first 5 days of the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. However, these  CRP measurements will not be  
accessible to the treating physicians .   
An oxygen titration protocol will be utilized to standardize oxygen weaning in both arms (please see appendix).  
Daily Troponin measurements will be added in both arms

C. Sample Size and Power: In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we do not have the power to test the efficacy of the 
intervention on patient -centered outcomes. However, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_752596] /III study.  
 
D. Data Collection: Case Report Forms will be completed by [CONTACT_752613] 
a REDCap database.  
 
 
11  1/4/2021
  
 E. Data Handling:  
-Protected health information will be preserved by [CONTACT_752614]-identified and 
given a study number. 
-This data will be recorded using REDCap and JMP. Any written data will be stored in 
storage files in a locked access building. -Data will only be accessible to investigators/participating personnel. 
-The computers where the data will be stored meet strict security requirements imposed by [CONTACT_111212]. -No data containing PHI will be transported on data sticks or laptops without being encrypted or password protected. -No hardcopy information containing PHI will be transported/removed from the Mayo campus.  
-Any hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_752597] a locked, secure location only accessible to the study personnel. -No data will be disclosed to another institution and all identifiers linking to the patient will 
be destroyed after data collection is complete.  
 
f. Data Analysis  
 Aims 1and 3 :   Continuous outcomes will be compared between treatment arms using linear 
regression and  binary outcomes using chi-square or fishers exact tests. Secondary outcomes will be tested without adjustment for multiple comparisons.   Data from this study, including 
estimated effects of the intervention and sample variation in outcomes, will provide valuable information to plan a well-powered subsequent phase II trial. 
 Aim 2: The correlation between CRP levels and corticosteroid dosing in those who receive individual -dose steroids versus usual care will be examined using Pearson’s correlation 
coefficient. The effect of CRP levels on the secondary outcomes will be evaluated using multivariable analysis adjusting for severity of illness.  The data from this study will help evaluate the usefulness of CRP as a predictive and prognostic enrichment tool and thus help inform and refine the thresholds for initiation, titration and discontinuation of corticosteroids in the subsequent larger study.  
 
 Decision to proceed wit h a larger study: The decision to proceed with a phase II/III  study will 
be based on the following criteria:  
- Ability to enroll an adequate number of eligible patients early in the course of illness. The 
expected hurdles include delayed identification of potentially eligible patients, 
provider/patient refusal, non- adherence to protocol,  and inability to obtain CRP levels in a 
timely manner.   
- Safety; i.e. absence of significant adverse events.   
12  1/4/2021
  
 - Preliminary efficacy: ability to show reduction in steroid use, reduced epi[INVESTIGATOR_752598].  
 The data collected will be essential to adequately plan the future study, estimate power and 
sample size, refine exclusion/inclusion criteria a nd determine the number and characteristics of 
future study sites.  
g. Feasibility and Time Frame:  
We believe that our project is feasible in the time frame of the grant; we hope to use the preliminary data generated from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_752599] a phase II/III study involving a larger study group and more centers (Table 5).  
 h. Strengths – This is a well -designed pi[INVESTIGATOR_752600] . Data 
from this study, including estimated effects of the intervention and sample variation in outcomes, will provide valuable information to plan a well -powered subsequent phase II /III 
trial. 
i. Limitation – Subject enrollment is dependent on availability of research coordinator s, therefore 
we aim to e nroll [ADDRESS_1030399] that  the lack of blindin g of treating 
attending physicians and physicians in training is a  strong limitation in  our study. 
V. Human Subjects  
Informed consent: All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this 
study and providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their 
participation in this study.  This consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and 
approval by [CONTACT_14884]. 
The risk profile would justify deferred consent for those who are unable to give consent and have 
no legally authorized representative available within the short timeframe .  
Our inclusion and exclusion criteria have been carefully selected to maximize potential benefit 
and minimize risk to study subjects.  
For suspected/confirmed COVID -19 subjects: Due to the high infectivity of COVID-19, and the 
strict need to minimize contact [CONTACT_752615] -19 patients and study staff, we 
propose consent be obtained verbally via telephone or via video.  
Patients would  still receive a copy of the consent form describing the study. This would be given 
to the patient by [CONTACT_752616].  
For all other subjects: The consent form must be signed by [CONTACT_29159]’s legally 
authorized representative, and the individual obtaining the informed consent. 
 
13  1/4/2021
  
 Potential risks :. We will include a detailed description of potential risks and benefits of 
corticosteroid administration while obtaining patient consent. 
All the tests and procedures that will be included in the study are consistent with standard 
clinical care; there will no extra costs to the subjects who consent to study participation. CRP would be taken during routine daily lab draws ; there may  be one ad ditional blood draw on the 
day of consent. All clinical assessments will be done through EMR.  
Potential benefits: The potential benefits include the importance of the knowledge to be gained 
from this study with the possibility of reduced adverse side effe cts of steroids associated with a 
lower dosing and shorter duration in the individualized arm.  
 
VI. Gender/Minority Mix

Oxygen Titration Protocol  
 
• Consult the patient specific SpO2 targets (per diagnosis category)  
• SPO2 target range 90 -95% 
o COPD in exacerbation:  SPO2 preferred target 88- 92% 
o ARDS:  SPO2 preferred target 88 -95%  
• Decision support tool should be utilized in stabilized patients only  
• Assess for titration minimally every 60 mins (with vital sign assessments)  
• Overall goal: Discontinue oxygen or wean to baseline need (NC, CPAP)

Device Deficiencies  
A device deficiency is inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance. A device deficiency may or ma y not be 
associated with patient harm (i.e., ADE or SADE); however, not all ADEs or SADEs are due 
to a device deficiency. The investigator should determine the applicable category listed in the 
Device Deficiency eCRF for the identified or suspect device de ficiency and report any patient 
harm separately. Examples of device deficiencies include the following:  
• Len missing/folded/fragments/ Lens cloudy /dirty  
• Lens surface/edge defect  
• Torn lens during handling/in pack  
• Packaging deficit (e.g., blister strip damage, primary/secondary label mismatch, 
mislabeled product, tampered seal)  
• Potential contaminant

• “Have there been any changes in the medicines you take since your last study visit? ” 
Additionall y, changes in any protocol -specific parameters  evaluated 
during the study are to be reviewed by [CONTACT_093]. Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter  that is 
clinically relevant, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], is to be reported as an AE. These 
clinically relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality.  
11.2 Procedures for Recording and Reporting  
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent. Any pr e-existing medical conditions or 
signs/symptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study (i.e., before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study and should be recorded in the Medical 
History section of the eCRF.  
In additio n, temporary lens awareness or visual changes during the fitting process are not 
considered AEs if the investigator assesses that the symptom(s) can reasonably resolve within 
the anticipated adaptation period.  
For each recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs do cumentation must include: date of 
occurrence, severity, treatment (if applicable), outcome, and assessments of the seriousness 
and causality. In addition, the investigator must document all device deficiencies reported or 
observed with Test and Comparator  products on the Device Deficiency eCRF. The site must 
submit all available information on ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies to the study sponsor 
immediately as follows  
• All SAEs  must be reported immediately (within 24 hours ) of the investigator ’s or 
site’s awareness .  
• ADEs that do not meet seriousness criteria and Device deficiencies must be reported  
within 10 calendar days of the investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .  
• A printed copy of the completed Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect 
and/or Device Deficiency  eCRF  must be included with product returns.   
• Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available.  
• Document all relevant information from Discharge Summary, Autopsy Report,  
Certificate of Death, etc., if applicable, in narrative section of the Serious Adverse 
Event and Adverse Device Effect  eCRF.

Alcon – Business Use Only  Note:  Should the EDC system become nonoperational, the site must complete the appropriate 
paper Serious Adverse Event and A dverse Device Effect  and/or Device Deficiency  Form. The 
completed form is emailed to the study sponsor at [EMAIL_225] according to the 
timelines outlined above; however, the reported information must be entered into the EDC 
system once it becomes operational.  
Any AEs and device deficiencies  for non -study marketed devices/products will be considered 
and processed as spontaneous (following the post -market vigilance procedures) and should be 
communicated to the device ’s/product ’s manufacturer as per local requirements.  
Study sponsor representat ives may be contact[CONTACT_529113] -related question.  
Further, depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency being reported, the study 
sponsor may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_13271] ’s medical records. The 
investigator must a lso report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory authorities or IRB/IEC.  
Intensity and Causality Assessments  
Where appropriate, the investigator must assess the intensity (severity) of the  AE based upon 
medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:  
Intensity (Severity)  
Mild  An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign or 
symptom.  
Moderate  An AE is moderate if the sign or sym ptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.  
Severe  An AE is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability to work or engage in their usual activities.  
For every AE in the study, the investigator must assess the causality (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study procedure). An assessment of causality will also be performed 
by [CONTACT_432574], as shown below:  
Causali ty 
Related  An AE classified as related may be either definitely related or possibly related

the AE  was caused by [CONTACT_443411].  
Not Related  An AE classified as not related may either be definitely unrelated or simply 
unlikely to be related (i .e., there are other more likely causes for the AE).  
The study sponsor will assess the A Es and may upgrade the investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality. The study sponsor will notify the investigator of any AEs that 
are upgraded from nonserious to serious or from unrelated to related.

which the code was broken and of the circumstances involved. Additionally, the study 
sponsor may be required to unmask the information in order to fulfi ll expedited regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
11.5 Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse Events   
The investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study.  
The investigator should provide the study sponsor with any new safety information (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previously reported AEs) that may affect the safety 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that  are unresolved/ongoing at time of subject exit from 
study, any additional information received at follow -up should be documented in the eCRFs 
up to study completion (i.e., database lock).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis Methods  
A mixed effect s repeated measures model will be utilized to test these hypotheses. The model 
will include terms for lens, visit, lens by [CONTACT_23259], period, and sequence. Within -
subject correlation due to eye and the crossover design will also be accounted for in the 
model. Lens difference (P1 fA minus MDT ) and the corresponding one -sided 95% upper 
confidence limit will  be computed  at Week 1 . Noninferiority in distance V A will be declared 
if upper confidence limit is less than 0.05 .

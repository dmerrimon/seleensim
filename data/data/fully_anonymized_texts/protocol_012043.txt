Page #  2Primary Objective:To determine the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of the culturally competent communication to improve engagement in ACP (i.e., end-of-life discussions with providers and families, completion of advance directives) for Latino patients with advanced cancer.Secondary Objectives:Not applicableExploratory Objectives:Not applicableEndpoints:Feasibility will be measured by [CONTACT_86288] (Benchmark: ≥ 70% complete the intervention sessions). Acceptability will be measured by a single-item question assessing helpfulness of the intervention (1 = not at all helpful, 5 = very helpful) as well an open-ended question about helpfulness of the intervention (“What was helpful about the intervention?”) (Benchmark: ≥ 70% rate it as “helpful” or “very helpful”).Advance Care Planning Readiness will be measured using the Advance Care Planning Engagement Survey, which is a validated 49-item scale (α=.94)1 designed to assess knowledge, readiness/motivation, and self-efficacy of ACP. Engagement in ACP will measure two key elements of ACP. First, EOL care discussions will be measured by [CONTACT_86289]-report whether they have discussed any of the following: (1) wishes they have about the care they would like to receive if they were dying and/or (2) advance care directives, with an oncology provider or family member: DNR orders, living wills, durable powers of attorney for health care, assignments of health care proxies (yes/no format). Second, completion of advance directives will be assessed by [CONTACT_86290] (DNR order, living will, durable power of attorney, health care proxy).Analytic Plan:SPSS version 23.[ADDRESS_94290] all quantitative statistical analyses. Participants (N=50) will be randomly assigned to the culturally competent communication intervention group or PLAN (n=25) or the control group (n=25). They will then complete measures of engagement in ACP post-intervention. Preliminary analyses will utilize t-tests to compare the two groups on baseline characteristics (e.g., education, age). Using a criterion of p < .10, any variables that are different among the groups will be included in the final logistic regression models as potential confounders. Five separate logistic regression models will be run in which ACP outcomes (end-of-life care discussions with family and providers; and the completion of advance directives DNR, health care proxy, and living will) will be predicted by [CONTACT_86291] (intervention vs. control). The statistical power of the proposed logistic regressions to detect a minimum odds ratio of 2.[ADDRESS_94291] with power (1 – β) equal to 0.80, and α = 0.05, requires a sample size of 113. Our proposed sample size of n=[ADDRESS_94292] size is small but adequately powered if it is large.

Background and SignificanceLatino/non-Latino, white disparities are prevalent in ACP and quality of EOL care. Cancer is the leading cause of death among US Latinos.2 This highlights the importance of addressing advance care planning (ACP) for Latino cancer patients. So do recent U.S. Census Bureau statistics indicating that Latinos are the fastest growing minority group in the U.S., with expected growth rates of 57% from 2015 to 2050 (totaling to 103 million).3. Latino/white disparities are prevalent in end-of-life care planning and outcomes. For instance, terminally ill Latinos are less likely than non-Latino, whites (hereafter referred to as “whites”) to engage in ACP.4-8 ACP enables patients to achieve their preferred EOL goals of care. Latinos are significantly less likely than whites to engage in two main forms of ACP: (1) end-of-life discussions (32% vs. 85%)4 and (2) completing advance directives such as having a living will (9% vs. 67%) or naming a health care proxy (4% vs. 59%).[ADDRESS_94293] been shown to be significantly more likely to receive care in line with their end-of-life care wishes (86% vs. 30%)[ADDRESS_94294] (85% preferred home).10 The absence of ACP, in turn, is linked to higher rates of death in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). ICU death is linked to greater physical and emotional distress and poorer quality of life.11,12 Latino patients are more likely than their white counterparts to receive aggressive care (e.g., CPR, ICU stays) at the end of life.13-15 They are also less likely to use hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86249].14,16-18 The aggressive care that Latinos often receive is generally contrary to their preferences and values,19-24 associated with poorer quality of life,12,19,25,26 and very costly.13Engaging in ACP is critical to having quality and value-consistent EOL care. Prior research as well as our pi[INVESTIGATOR_86250]-of-life care among Latinos. For example, one of our prior studies found that among Latino advanced cancer patients who completed a do not resuscitate (DNR) order and/or had an end-of-life discussion, none received aggressive care at the end of life.27 More recent findings from our recent publication28 demonstrate that when Latino patients had an end-of-life discussion, it increased their odds of completing a DNR order tenfold, nearly eliminating the pre-existing Latino/white disparities in DNR order completion. Thus, it is critical to develop an intervention that will increase engagement in ACP to improve quality of

Protocol # RG1121949Version Date: May 17, 2024
Page #  4care at the EOL among Latino advanced cancer patients.An effective intervention to increase Latinos’ engagement in ACP should incorporate communication competence and cultural values. In designing an effective intervention for increasing Latinos’ engagement in ACP, it is necessary to consider what contributes to Latinos’ low rates of ACP. First, as highlighted by a narrative review of the literature (33 empi[INVESTIGATOR_2292]), lack of knowledge about advance directives29 contributes to less engagement in ACP. Second, Latinos prefer a family-centered approach to determining end-of-life goals of care.[ADDRESS_94295] cultural and religious beliefs about end-of-life care also reduce engagement in ACP.15,17,18,20,21 Based on these findings, an effective intervention should target communication and knowledge of ACP while also incorporating cultural, religious, and familial beliefs about ACP.A patient-targeted “coaching” intervention may be the most effective approach for Latinos. Prior research in other clinical contexts indicates that clinicians give more information and achieve a better understanding of patients’ goals of care when patients engage in a more participatory consultation style (asking more questions, stating preferences).30-33 Patients’ participation has been shown to benefit disadvantaged and minority groups most, indicating its importance among Latinos.[ADDRESS_94296] to improve patient participation and communication in medical consultations is to utilize a patient-targeted coaching intervention (demonstrated to be effective across 137 intervention trials).34 Because Latinos’ beliefs surrounding ACP are also influenced by [CONTACT_86292], familial, and religious beliefs,15,17,18,20,[ADDRESS_94297] effective intervention for improving Latinos’ engagement in ACP. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_86251] a culturally competent communication coaching intervention, little research has focused on identifying effective strategies for improving Latino advanced cancer patients’ engagement in ACP. The proposed K07 aims to address this gap in the literature through developi[INVESTIGATOR_86252], acceptability, and efficacy of a theoretically-guided, culturally competent communication intervention that will coach Latinos on how to engage in ACP and communicate their preferred end-of-life goals of care. This intervention will be developed based on current literature grounded in models of communication competence.38,39 The proposed work will make a significant contribution by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_82612], low-resource intensive intervention designed to improve Latino advanced cancer patients’ engagement in ACP, ultimately leading to a reduction in disparities in end-of-life care. Results from this study will also guide the development of a future, multisite study (R01) examining the efficacy of the culturally competent communication intervention among various sub-groups of Latinos.

Page #  53. Study Design and Methods3.[ADDRESS_94298] the developed intervention (PLAN) to demonstrate feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness at improving patients’ engagement in ACP. To assess this, 50 Latino advanced cancer patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention group (n=25) or the control group (n=25). After completing the intervention/control, patients will fill out measures of completion of end-of-life discussions and advance directives (confirmed via medical charts). Phase III (of the ORBIT model)40 (Efficacy) will be tested in a future R01 RCT. Because this is a protocol being transferred from Weill Cornell to FHCC, the PI (Shen) requested that two additional sites (UT Southwestern and Confluence Health) be added to the protocol to ensure the proper number of Latino patients can be enrolled in this study. Confluence Health reports a base rate population of 58% Latino patients. UT Southwestern (UTSW) has been a prior collaborator of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_86253] R01 projects examining advanced cancer patients over time. In this prior work, they have consistently recruited several Latinx advanced cancer patients successfully and met all recruitment goals (often n=50 to 75 patients within 12 to 18 months), Additionally, [CONTACT_86329] has collaborated on this research and has several publications in the area of end-of-life care. Finally, the current number of eligible Latinx advanced cancer patients at this site is n=[ADDRESS_94299]. Paulk is the founder of palliative medicine programs at UTSW and currently serves as the Medical Director of ambulatory and inpatient palliative medicine programs for the Parkland Health and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48214] (PHHS). Additionally, this site is expected to serve as a site for future R01 submissions, thus inclusion at this point will enhance the ability to demonstrate feasibility. This request was approved by [CONTACT_86293] K07 award.3.2 Study PopulationPatient subjects with an advanced cancer diagnosis who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible for this study. 3.3 Inclusion CriteriaPatient eligibility criteria: (1) identifying ethnically as Latino; (2) locally advanced or metastatic cancer and/or have experienced disease progression on at least first-line chemotherapy and (3) ability to provide informed consent. 
Fred Hutch IRBApproved 6/5/2024
Protocol # RG1121949Version Date: May 17, 2024
Page #  63.4 Exclusion Criteria Patient exclusion criteria: (1) not fluent in English or Spanish; (2) severely cognitively impaired (as measured by [CONTACT_86294] ≥ 6 to be delivered by [CONTACT_86295]);41 (3) too ill or weak to complete the interviews (as judged by [CONTACT_86296]); (4) currently receiving hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86254] (to allow prediction of ACP); (5) children and young adults under age 18; and (6) patients deemed inappropriate for the study by [CONTACT_86297]. Because the primary outcomes include both completion of advance care planning documentation as well as conversations around ACP, we have chosen not to add exclusion criteria around completion of advance directives. The goal of PLAN is two-fold – which is to increase completion of these documents but also to increase engagement in conversations around ACP with loved ones and providers (which can be present or not present despi[INVESTIGATOR_86255]).3.[ADDRESS_94300] to confirm initial eligibility and obtain permission to approach these patients about the study. Using the eligibility criteria outlined, study staff will screen participating oncologists’ clinic schedules for patients that meet the inclusion criteria (e.g., cancer diagnosis and treatment status). Alternatively, oncologists will refer their patients directly to the study.To recruit patients at Confluence Health, a clinical roster will be reviewed daily by [CONTACT_86298]. Potentially eligible patients will be identified and forwarded in a list to FHCC study staff. Trained bi-lingual, bi-cultural FHCC research staff will approach, determine eligibility, and consent eligible patients.To recruit PHHS patients by [CONTACT_86299], the site PI ([CONTACT_86329]) or trained bi-lingual, bi-cultural staff at UTSW will obtain verbal consent either in-person or over the phone from Parkland patients eligible for the study. All consented patients will then be given assessments/surveys. For patients randomized to the intervention condition, they will receivethe telephone-based intervention by [CONTACT_86300]. These approaches are outlined and will be approved by [CONTACT_16529]’s local IRB. Recruitment and retention. We will recruit advanced cancer patients from three sites: FHCC, UT Southwestern, and Confluence Health. To maximize recruitment rates and ensure timely completion of the proposed study, we will use multiple methods and processes used in our prior (R01-CA106370, PI: [INVESTIGATOR_86256]) and current work (K07-CA207580, PI: [INVESTIGATOR_86257]; R21-CA224874, PI: [INVESTIGATOR_86257]) outlined below. Our team of investigators, most notably [CONTACT_86330] (PI), [CONTACT_86331] (Co-Investigator), and [CONTACT_86329] (Co-Investigator) have a long track record of success recruiting advanced cancer patients to research studies. Sampling and recruitment procedures to be utilized in the present study, as noted, have been used for similar NCI-funded studies (e.g., CwC I, II, and III; PI: [INVESTIGATOR_86256]: Site PI: [INVESTIGATOR_86258]). Recruitment across these studies (e.g., R01-CA106370, PI: [INVESTIGATOR_86256]) have indicated recruitment rates of 70-80% for an advanced cancer patient population with the same eligibility criteria outlined in this application. As such, we project a conservative estimate of 70% of eligible patients. The average number of new advanced cancer patients seen annually at FHCC (based on solid tumors included in the proposed study) is n= 2,405, of whom n=372 identify as Latinx (based on 2019 numbers from formerly Seattle Cancer Care Alliance). Given this projected 
Fred Hutch IRBApproved 6/5/2024
Protocol # RG1121949Version Date: May 17, 2024
Page #  7patient flow, the allowed year for active recruitment is a highly feasible timeline for recruiting n=[ADDRESS_94301] successfully recruited 70% of advanced cancer patients, we acknowledge that recruitment to the present study may pose different and unique challenges. As such, we outline here the specific measures we will take to maximize rates of recruitment and retention to ensure timely and full completion of the study at each site. At FHCC, study staff will review FHCC clinic schedules twice weekly to identify advanced cancer patients who meet the eligibility criteria. Study staff will confirm the potential eligibility of all identified patients through medical record review. Once a potentially eligible patient is identified, research study staff will email the patient’s treating oncologist or other clinical team member to confirm eligibility and request permission to approach the patient. When an eligible patient is identified and confirmed to be eligible by [CONTACT_102]’s treating oncologist or clinical team member, the research study member will approach the patient in the clinic and describe the study to the patient in person. If the research study member is unable to meet the patient during his/her clinic appointment, the study member will mail a letter out describing the study, which includes contact [CONTACT_19292]. The letter will instruct the patient to call the study team either to learn more about the study or indicate he or she is not interested. If no contact [CONTACT_86301], the study team member will follow up with a phone call to provide additional information about the study and assess interest in participating. Once the patient has expressed interest and is deemed eligible, they will each be given an introductory letter, a study information sheet, and consented to the study. Once consented, the assessments and telephone-based intervention will be conducted by [CONTACT_86302]. At UTSW, [CONTACT_86329] and other providers within the PHHS palliative care clinic will refer potentially eligible patients to UTSW research study members. A Form HH HIPPA supplement and waiver of authorization has been sent and approved by [CONTACT_86303]. When an eligible patient is identified and confirmed, the UTSW study member will either approach the eligible patient in person, during a clinic visit, or mail out recruitment material, if they are unable to approach the patient in person. If approaching the eligible patient in person, the study member will coordinate with the clinic staff to find an appropriate time to approach the patient. When approaching the patient, the study member, will proceed to describe the study and give the patient a study flyer. If the research study member is unable to meet the patient during their clinic visit, they will mail the patient an envelope containing a study flyer and information sheet. An information sheet is a UTSW form used to provide study information to potential participants and used for guiding the verbal consenting process. Two weeks after mailing out the letters, UTSW study staff will contact [CONTACT_86304]. A Form HH Waiver of Consent documentation has been sent and approved by [CONTACT_86305] (signed form) in order to obtain verbal consent. If the patient is interested after the in person or telephone call approach, the patient will give verbal consent for participation to the UTSW study member. Once verbal consent has been obtained the UTSW research assistants, will notify the Fred Hutch coordinator. The Fred hutch coordinator and social worker will then carry out the rest of the study procedures with the UTSW participants over the phone. Since the Fred Hutch Coordinator and social worker conduct the remaining study procedures, they will mail out the gift cards to participants who 
Fred Hutch IRBApproved 6/5/2024
Protocol # RG1121949Version Date: May 17, 2024
Page #  8have completed the surveys. Due to workflow, timing, scheduling and sessions/surveys conducted over the phone, Fred Hutch will take responsibility to compensate the participants, as UTSW staff will not be involved in the downstream of study procedures. To avoid any delays and to ensure timely compensation, once the participant has completed the survey with the participant over the phone, the Fred Hutch team will mail out the gift card to the participant. For each completed survey, the compensation will be a gift card in the amount of $25.00. Participants are eligible to receive up to $50.[ADDRESS_94302]. Overton (Co-Investigator, Confluence Health) will directly assist in this process by [CONTACT_86306]. When an eligible patient is identified and referred to FHCC study staff, staff members will be responsible for approaching the participant with an introductory letter and a study information sheet via mail. If interested, the patient will be consented to the study. All consented patients will then be given assessments as well as the telephone-based intervention by [CONTACT_86302].Each of these methods for approaching and consenting methods have been used successfully previously at Weill Cornell (PI’s previous institution) to recruit advanced cancer patient. Additionally, the following measures will be taken to improve retention. Follow up calls or texts (depending on participant preference) to participants will be utilized to remind patients of upcoming study activity (interviews, assessments, etc.). A social worker interventionist and “coach” has been included as the study interventionist to improve patients’ access to needed resources throughout the study intervention, which has been shown in our prior work to improve retention to intervention studies. Throughout the study period, accrual and retention rates will be monitored at weekly study meetings through CONSORT flow diagrams reporting reasons for missed approaches, study refusal, and loss to follow up. This will allow the PI [INVESTIGATOR_86259]/or retention and the potential reasons for it so that proper action can be taken to resolve the issue. This approach has previously helped similar studies which had fallen to 50% accrual to improve to 90% accrual through a targeted approach system that addressed the specific reasons for refusal (e.g., accommodating schedules, fatigue, etc.). Finally, all attempts have been made to keep interviews and questionnaires brief and flexible in order to reduce burden on the patients.Patients at the FHCC and Confluence sites, who are approved for contact [CONTACT_86307] a letter in the mail that includes a brief description of the study and contact [CONTACT_86308]. Research staff will then meet these patients in the clinic, introduce themselves, and provide the patient with a study information sheet and consent form. Patients who indicate they want to participate will be consented at that time or provided a pre-paid postmarked return envelope in which to return the consent form and contact[CONTACT_86309]-up. Patients who study staff are unable to meet during clinic appointments will be contact[CONTACT_86310]. Once consented, participants will be enrolled in the study.

AdministrationTiming and FrequencyPre-interview/baseline assessment, intervention, and post assessment follow up post-intervention (within a week).LocationTelephone-based delivery of the intervention and in person or over the phone assessments. Cancer patients may opt to have their interview(s) during infusion at participating sites (FHCC, UT Southwestern/PHHS, Confluence Health).*Additional measures to protect participants in the in-person interviews or usability testing from COVID-19 related exposure and infection. In-person interviews will only be conducted in line with all the safety regulations and recommended procedures for vulnerable and at-risk patient populations. As such, no in person approaches will happen prior to the appropriate approval and authorization at each participating site. In the even in person approaches are approved, study personnel will ensure proper PPE is worn by [CONTACT_86311], proper social distancing is observed, and that all patients consent to and are comfortable with in person interviews. Due to potential risks, telephone-based interviews will be promoted among participating patients, when available.Person IdentifiersClinical variables will be collected from medical records and will include the following: cancer diagnosis and stage, treatment received, co-morbid conditions (i.e., Charlson Comorbidity Index, CCI), and Karnofsky performance status.B. Study InstrumentsFeasibility will be measured by [CONTACT_86288] (Benchmark: ≥ 70% complete the intervention sessions). Acceptability will be measured by a single-item question assessing helpfulness of the intervention (1 = not at all helpful, 5 = very helpful) as well an open-ended question about helpfulness of the intervention (“What was helpful about the intervention?”) (Benchmark: ≥ 70% rate it as “helpful” or “very helpful”). Demographics will be measured via self-report assessing: age, gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, employment status, education, income, religion, insurance coverage, national origins (e.g., Mexican), cultural heritage, and acculturation.42 Clinical variables will be assessed using records from medical charts and will include the following: cancer diagnosis, treatment, site, and stage; co-morbid conditions, and Karnofsky43 performance status. Quality of life will be measured using the validated, 27-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scale.44 Cultural beliefs will be measured using three brief scales developed for the present studies (included in the R01). Fatalismo45 will be measured using a 4-item scale assessing the acceptance of belief that all events are predetermined and inevitable. Personalismo46,[ADDRESS_94303]. Respeto48 will be measured using a 4-item scale assessing the degree to which patients endorse the role of authority in following doctor’s orders. Familial beliefs will be measured using two brief scales developed for the present studies (included in R01). Familismo61,62

Page #  10will be measured using a 5-item scale assessing the degree of family loyalty and cohesion. Related to familismo, filial duty49 will be measured with a 6-item scale assessing the degree to which children should be involved in caring for their elderly parents. Religious/spi[INVESTIGATOR_86260]: (1) Religious copi[INVESTIGATOR_86261]’s brief RCOPE,50 which is a validated 14-item scale (α > .8050) assessing the extent to which patients engage in 7 types of positive and 7 types of negative religious copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. (2) Religious beliefs about EOL medical care will be measured using a 9-item scale. We have recently begun to validate this scale among advanced cancer patients in our prior studies.51 Potential confounders to be measured include terminal illness acceptance, which will be assessed using our validated, single-item question,19,52 which asks patients how they would define their current health status and illness understanding, a single item measure that assesses understanding of incurability of illness. We will use the Advance Care Planning Engagement Survey, which is a validated 49-item scale (α=.94)1 designed to assess knowledge, readiness/motivation, and self-efficacy of ACP. Engagement in ACP will measure two key elements of ACP. First, EOL care discussions will be measured by [CONTACT_86289]-report whether they have discussed any of the following: (1) wishes they have about the care they would like to receive if they were dying and/or (2) advance care directives, with an oncology provider or family member: DNR orders, living wills, durable powers of attorney for health care, assignments of health care proxies (yes/no format). Second, completion of advance directives will be assessed by [CONTACT_86290] (DNR order, living will, durable power of attorney, health care proxy). Patient’s Medical Status. Patients’ current and past cancer diagnoses, the dates of each, patients’ Karnofsky performance score43 and the number and type of oncology providers seen at that clinic will be obtained from the patient’s medical chart. Advance Directives and Referrals for Palliative Care. Patient’s medical charts will be reviewed for documentation of advance directives and referrals for palliative care during the study observation period (consent to interview).3.7 Intervention (PLAN)The intervention for this study, Planning For Your Advance Care Needs (PLAN), is a coaching-based communication information designed to be culturally competent, In PLAN, all coaching sessions will occur over the phone and be a maximum of 45 minutes to reduce patient burden. These sessions will focus on creating individualized messages and skill-building exercises based on patients’ learning needs, goals, and values (as indicated on the intake form). The intervention will be delivered across three sessions, with the following modules, as based on prior communication competence coaching interventions:53 (1) Assessment of current knowledge, motivation, and self-efficacy (action) as well as cultural and religious preferences/values surrounding EOL care (tablet-based intake questionnaire); (2) clarification and correction of misconceptions about EOL care and ACP; (3) teaching of relevant concepts (education about ACP and EOL care options); (4) planning (identifying goals of care, creating achievable goals of care, and creating strategies to communicate goals of care to providers and family members); (5) rehearsal of communication skills using role play exercises (practice question-asking, etc.); (6) portrayal of learned skills (patient applies learned skills in their oncology visit and/or with family members).3.[ADDRESS_94304] extensive experience interviewing

Training will consist of learning the interview question prompts/guides, practice sessions, and instruction in administration of surveys, including IRB approved procedures for approaching potential study participants. Newly trained interviewers will be required to have a high degree of inter-rater-reliability (e.g., κ=0.85) with fully-trained, experienced interviewers on core assessments (e.g., religious beliefs about end-of-life medical care) before they will be allowed to collect data for the study.Scheduling of Assessments. Study staff will contact [CONTACT_86312]. Patients will be given the option to communicate about their assessments and the scheduling of the assessments via phone calls, emails, and/or text messages. Patient assessments will be scheduled to occur at the earliest convenient time for the participant following study enrollment. All baseline assessments will be given first. Then, patients will engage in their first intervention session within one week of completing a baseline assessment. The three intervention sessions will then be given approximately a week a part, taking approximately four weeks to complete. After completion of the intervention, patients will complete a post-intervention assessment within one week. Finally, a brief three month follow up will occur that extracts data from their EHR on healthcare utilization. For those in the control condition, they will receive a baseline assessment and then a “post-intervention” session four weeks later, which is the expected span of time between baseline and post-intervention assessments for those in the experimental condition. Three month follow up data extraction will occur for subjects in experimental and control conditions. Conduct of Patient Assessments. Patients’ assessments will be conducted either in person in clinic or at home, or over the telephone depending on the wishes of the patient. Interviews will be conducted in English or Spanish depending on the preference of the patient. We have previously validated all measures to be used in samples of English- and Spanish-speaking advanced cancer patients, and all assessments will be translated into Spanish through Datagain, a professional translation service which utilizes HIPAA compliant procedures and has been used in prior studies by [CONTACT_978]. We will document the language in which the interview was conducted. Each interview will be conducted alone with the patient to permit greater freedom of expression and will be approximately [ADDRESS_94305] of their choosing within a few days. Considerable care has been taken to ensure that the interviews are as brief as possible. All Spanish translated materials will be submitted for IRB approval after receiving approval for the English documents.Medical Chart Extraction. Study staff will review participating patients’ medical charts during the course of the study to extract information about patients’ health and disease status, healthcare, documentation of advance care directives, and referrals for palliative care during the study observation period.Reducing Missing Data. To reduce missing data, following all assessments study staff will review the contents and scan for missing information. If missing information is found, the staff member will contact [CONTACT_86313]-in missing data.3.9 Intervention AdministrationA total of 50 Latino advanced cancer patients will be enrolled in this study and randomly assigned to the intervention (n=25) or control (n=25) condition.

After participating in the intervention or control condition, patients’ engagement in ACP will be assessed to determine if the intervention improved ACP engagement and planning.The intervention itself will be administered by a fully trained, licensed social worker via telephone. This interventionist will use a culturally competent communication intervention to “coach” patients in how to be motivated for and to actually engage in ACP, and will be bi-lingual in Spanish and English.Patients randomized into the control group will receive usual care. For usual care, patients will engage in standard care with no modifications. Thus, ACP discussions will only occur as they do in usual clinical care (i.e. brought up in clinical encounters). 3.[ADDRESS_94306] at a time and a location that is convenient for the participant, and will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. Patient assessments are designed to be focused and brief. The assessment batteries are less lengthy than those for a prior, similarly designed study (Copi[INVESTIGATOR_86262]), for which rates of incomplete assessments were extremely low, with no interviews of patients requiring rescheduling, and with minimal missing data.3.11 CompensationPatient participants will each receive $25 (gift card) compensation for each completed survey assessments (2) for a total of up to $50. The issue of compensation is addressed in the respective consent forms. This amount was selected to compensate patients for their time without coercion to enrollment in the study. UTSW participants will receive their gift cards via mail, by [CONTACT_86314].

Statistical ConsiderationsParticipants (N=50) will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (n=25) or the control group (n=25). They will then complete measures of engagement in ACP post-intervention. Feasibility and acceptability will be examined with frequency and descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, median, standard deviation, range) for enrollment rates, number of sessions completed, number of weeks required to complete the intervention, and Likert-scale items assessing satisfaction with the intervention and perceived helpfulness. Because this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], in accordance with published standards for pi[INVESTIGATOR_86266],54 inferential statistics on measures of feasibility (≥70% intervention completion rates) and acceptability (≥70% rate it as “helpful” or “very helpful”) are not recommended. Rather, we will examine the average rates of completion

Page #  17as well as satisfaction and helpfulness ratings to determine feasibility and acceptability based on those values being equal to or greater than 70%. We will also conduct qualitative analyses on the open-ended questions related to helpfulness. Thematic analysis using an iterative process will be conducted for all qualitative analyses.55-[ADDRESS_94313] (e.g., frequencies) and latent (e.g., underlying themes) variables. If discrepancies occur, a third coder will resolve these conflicts. Interviews will continue until thematic saturation is achieved.60,61 Based on our prior field testing of interventions with patients with advanced illness, we anticipate reaching saturation with n=10 participants. Thus, n=25 in the experimental condition should be well powered to reach thematic saturation.To examine potential efficacy, preliminary analyses will utilize t-tests to compare the two groups on baseline characteristics (e.g., education, age). Using a criterion of p < .10, any variables that are different among the groups will be included in the final logistic regression models as potential confounders. To test the study aim, five separate logistic regression models will be run in which ACP outcomes (yes/no to EOL discussions with family and providers; and the completion of advance directives DNR, health care proxy, and living will) will be predicted by [CONTACT_86291] (CCC intervention vs. control). The statistical power of the proposed logistic regressions to detect a minimum odds ratio of 2.[ADDRESS_94314] with power (1 – β) equal to 0.80, and α = 0.05, requires a sample size of 113.

Due notice is taken to ensure that patients know that they are free to skip items they prefer not to answer.8. Adverse Event Reporting Requirements8.1 Potential Adverse EventsPotential adverse events (AEs) for this project are all non-medical in nature. Participants may experience mild distress when discussing the status of the patients’ cancer, decision-making, or care. Study staff may become aware of adverse events through participant self-report, routine study assessments, or study staff interactions with participants. 
Fred Hutch IRBApproved 6/5/2024
Protocol # RG1121949Version Date: May 17, 2024
Page #  18We will use standard NIH definitions of AEs/SAEs and UPs as follows:Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human study participant, including any abnormal sign (e.g. abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participants’ involvement in the research, whether or not considered related to participation in the research. The most likely event for the present study is elevated psychological distress.Serious Adverse Event (SAE): Any adverse event that: Results in death; Is life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity; Results in congenital anomalies or birth defects; Is another condition which investigators judge to represent significant hazards. An example in the present study is a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86267].Unanticipated Problem (UP): Any incident, experience, or outcome that is: Unexpected, in terms of nature, severity, or frequency; related or possibly related to participation in the research; and suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.We will use the following grading and relatedness scales in use at FHCC, UT Southwestern, and Confluence Health for severity rating and relatedness raring: Grading scale:0. No adverse event1. Mild AE – No treatment needed2. Moderate AE – Resolved with treatment3. Severe AE – Inability to carry on normal activities, required professional medical attention4. Life-threatening or disabling AE5. Fatal AERelatedness scale:Definitely relatedProbably relatedPossibly relatedUnlikely to be relatedDefinitely not relatedTo summarize, potential adverse events (AEs) for this project are all non-medical in nature and are expected to be graded as mild to moderate. Participants may experience mild distress when discussing the status of the patients’ prognosis or advance care planning. Serious adverse events (SAE) will include the following: suicidal ideation and/or discussing plans to harm another individual. Study staff may become aware of adverse events through participant self-report, routine study assessments, or study staff interactions with participants.

Protocol # RG1121949Version Date: May 17, 2024
Page #  19An unanticipated problem (UP) in the present study would include physical harm of any form to patients, as the proposed study only poses to potentially increase distress. As outlined in NIH policy, the AEs are expected to be mild to moderate in severity; the SAEs are expected to be serious in severity; and the UPs are expected to be mild to moderate in severity. Based on our prior work, we anticipate that AEs will occur rarely (in less than 2% of cases based on prior studies); SAEs to be 0% (based on prior work); and UPs to be less than 1% based on prior work. In most cases, only an AE of distress is expected to be directly related to study procedures whereas SAEs and UPs are rarely linked to study procedures directly in similar work8.2 AE/SAE ReportingTo identify possible AEs and SAEs, all study staff will be trained in identifying possible AEs or SAEs and will be required to keep a written log after each participant completes study procedures. In the event an AE or SAE is noticed, study staff will notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_86268] 24 hours (for SAEs) or within five days (for AEs). Additionally, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_86269], including recording interviews and answers to study questions to ensure that no AEs or SAEs go undetected. All SAEs noted by [CONTACT_86319] [INVESTIGATOR_86270] [ADDRESS_94318] (IRB) on an ongoing basis. In addition, yearly IRB renewal submissions require detailed adverse event reporting, which will also be sent to the NCI Program Officer and the grant PI ([CONTACT_86330]). Adverse events are also reported as part of the progress reports in the non-competitive and competitive renewals for the NIH. All study staff will complete the NIH required training in participation and conduct of studies that involve human subjects. If study staff discover any untreated physical conditions, they will refer participants to appropriate treatment immediately. Some participants will be receiving active treatment at the time of study participation; therefore, fluctuations in cancer-related symptoms will not be considered adverse events related to the study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_86271], adverse events, participant complaints and, if any, protocol violations with co-investigators as well.Meetings with co-investigators will be used to determine if any additional procedures are needed to augment data and safety monitoring.

(All deaths within 24 hours, as per above.)The summary of all other SAEs will be reported to NIA Program Officer and SO, quarterly.Few AEs or SAEs are expected for this slightly greater than minimal risk study of a behavioral intervention. As such, it is possible based on the high morbidity and multimorbidity of this population (i.e., advanced cancer patients) that there will occur one or more hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4355]/or other moderate to severe illness-related events during the study period that are unrelated to study participation. Nonetheless, if these occur, they will be reported as AEs or SAEs and the appropriate steps as outlined above will be taken.Below are the specific events that will trigger reporting to the parties described above:Acute alerts/Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86273]Institutionalization of participantEmergency room visit of participantDeath of participantSafety Alerts/Adverse EventsSevere medical problem of participantParticipant threatens to harm him or herself or othersEvidence of abuse to participants8.[ADDRESS_94319] of studies that involve human subjects.

Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others 9.1 Potential Risks: The risks involved in this study are minimal. There are no risks of physical injury. We anticipate that there may be questions in the interview that some study participants find upsetting. However, based on interviewing patients with advanced cancers in prior NCI-funded studies, we do not anticipate that this will be problematic. Should participants become exceedingly upset, overwhelmed or fatigued, or need to attend to matters of personal care during the interview, interviewers will be instructed to ask the participant if he or she would like to take a break or reschedule the interview for another time. However, across all prior studies (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_86257]), distress caused by [CONTACT_86320]. In addition, participants may find engagement in the intervention to be upsetting, particularly due to the potential for family conflict to arise. In addition, discussing advance care planning and end-of-life goals of care can be difficult. Patients will be in weekly contact [CONTACT_86321]. These social workers will have the skills to assess exacerbations in distress in study participants and provide appropriate support. Additionally, the social workers will provide patients with continued support throughout the intervention. In the event a study participant requires a higher level of care than provided in this study,  a FHCC licensed on call psychiatrist or mental health professional, UT Southwestern Licensed Clinical Psychologist, or a Confluence Health licensed on call psychiatrist or mental health professional will be consulted and the participant will be referred to the appropriate level of care.

In summary, the consent form will include a description of all study procedures, information regarding the risks and benefits of participation, contact [CONTACT_86324]’ questions, and alternatives to participation in the study. The consent form will also state that: (1) participation is voluntary, (2) participants can refuse to answer any questions, (3) participants can withdraw from the study at any time, (4) all responses will remain confidential, and (5) participation in the study is not related to care received at the cancer center. The consent form will also describe circumstances justifying a breach of confidentiality in the event of a psychological emergency. All patients will be given a hard copy of the consent document. This hard copy will be mailed to participants who provide oral consent.9.2.[ADDRESS_94324]. In the event that a participant is actively suicidal and/or at risk of harming self or others, a FHCC licensed mental health professional, UT Southwestern clinical psychologist or psychiatrist, or Confluence Health mental health professional will be contact[CONTACT_86325]. In the event of a psychiatric emergency, confidentiality may be suspended. Participants will be informed of the limits of confidentiality during the consent process and will be provided with the PI’s contact [CONTACT_86326]. In the event family conflict arises from using the intervention (PLAN), the social worker interventionist will determine and provide the appropriate level of care and guidance to resolve the conflict and handle any undue distress. Should the resulting distress be severe, the above procedures outlined will be conducted.Measures taken to protect study participants include the exclusion of patients who would be too weak to participate in the interviews, the curtailed length of the interviews, and the option for administration of the interviews over the telephone. All interviews will be designed to be brief, focused, and of minimal burden to participants. Only essential information will be asked of participants. Similarly, the intervention is designed to be brief and focused only on information relevant to the patients’ current situation. Additionally, specific measures have been taken to reduce and oversee potential family conflict, including close monitoring of participants in the intervention. The inclusion of a licensed social worker as the interventionist was made to ensure proper study design, monitoring of participants, and handling of any potentially resulting distress or family conflict.

All project interviewers will receive all required training and certification in FHCC’s or UT Southwestern’s human subjects in research. Project interviewers will be required to participate in a training program designed to ensure that they administer the interviews and evaluate participant responses in a sensitive manner. Interviewers will begin each interview with a series of statements that remind participants of their right to refuse to answer a question, to stop the interview at any time, or to continue at a later date. Interviewers will be trained to speak clearly and audibly and let participants determine the pace of the interview. In addition, study interventionists will be licensed social workers. Study interventionists will be provided with thorough training on administration of the intervention in a manner that recognizes the difficult nature of the ACP decision-making process in the context of advanced cancer. Should participants become upset, disoriented or fatigued or need to attend to matters of personal care during study procedures, interviewers and interventionists will ask the participants if they would like to take a break or reschedule the interview/session for another time. Participants who express a desire following the final interview to talk at greater length about issues raised during the study will be encouraged to call study staff at the telephone number provided, and should they want a referral for additional psychological counseling, staff will provide them with a referral to a mental health professional at a location that is convenient for them.To ensure protection against study risks, the IRB will review and approve the study procedures, materials, and consent form prior to study initiation. Consistent with previously approved IRB protocols, the following procedures will be implemented to minimize the potential risk of loss of confidentiality: (1) all study data will be coded with unique participant identification numbers; (2) participant names and other identifying information will not be recorded on study measures; (3) study data will be stored either in secure databases (digital copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) or in locked file cabinets in a locked office; (4) all information saved on the FHCC  secure network will be password protected; and (5) only authorized study staff will have access to the study data. These procedures have been utilized in other studies managed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-Investigators with no breaches of confidentiality or other risks to participants, indicating their effectiveness.Study participants will be assured that all responses will be kept confidential. All data collected during the interview process will be de-identified. To ensure confidentiality, data collected will be linked to participants’ personal information only by [CONTACT_86315]. Authorized study staff will be the only individuals who have access to participants’ personal information. This information will be stored in a password protected computer file on the secure FHCC server and/or in a locked file cabinet in a locked office. De-identified study data will be stored in REDCap, a secure HIPAA-compliant data management system supported by [CONTACT_86327]. All necessary precautions will be taken to ensure that there is no breach of confidentiality.All study staff involved in the research proposed are required to be educated on the protection of human research participants and the proposed research will comply with the regulations set forth in 45 CFR Part 46, Protection of Human

Page #  25Subjects. All personnel involved in the proposed protocol have been educated regarding HIPAA regulations and fully understand their responsibility to safeguard the personal health information of every participant involved in the study.The following steps will be taken to minimize participant burden. First, significant effort will be made to coordinate in-person study contacts (e.g., to provide information on the study and administer informed consent) with existing appointments to minimize the number of trips to FHCC, UT Southwestern/Parkland Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or Confluence Health required of participants. Second, with the participant’s permission, study visits can be conducted during scheduled chemotherapy infusions (if applicable, as some advanced cancer patients will no longer be receiving chemotherapy). Chemotherapy infusion appointments are often long (multiple hours) and patients are unable to leave the clinic during the appointment. In our previous NCI-funded studies (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Shen) of patients with advanced cancer, patients often elected to conduct research meetings during infusion appointments to provide activity during the appointment and reduce the overall time spent at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Prior to conducting visits during infusion appointments, participants will be reminded that infusion clinics are often not private and their permission to conduct the visit during infusion will be obtained. Participants will also be informed that they can discontinue at any time if they become uncomfortable due to the setting. If participants are not comfortable conducting visits during infusion appointments, separate appointments will be scheduled over the telephone. Third, participants will be given the option to complete administration of all study measures over the telephone, if preferred. This method will eliminate the need for participants to travel to the clinic to complete study measures. Any subject participating in the study may decline to continue participation and may withdraw from the study at any time. If they do not wish to participate but are interested in exploring other options such as counseling or support groups, we will provide appropriate referrals. 9.2.[ADDRESS_94325].

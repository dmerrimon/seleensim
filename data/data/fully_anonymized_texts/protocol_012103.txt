Purpose of Study :  
• To determine whether  gynecologic surgeons at a large community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_793110] .  
o Primary Aim: To determine the proportion of patients undergoing hysterectomy 
for the indication of pelvic organ prolapse having concurrent  api[INVESTIGATOR_793111] : McCall’s culdoplasty,  Uterosacral Ligament Susp ension, Sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_793112] , Abdominal Sacrocolpopexy , or Robotic Sacrocolpopexy .  
o Secondary Aim s: Identify characteristics of surgeons not meeting  the 
recommended best practice including  their  training, location  of operation , 
operative times , concurrent procedures and estimated blood loss.  
  
Hypothesis or Research Question  
• We hypothesize that fewer than 1 0% of patients having hysterectomy for pelvic 
organ prolapse will not undergo  concurrent api[INVESTIGATOR_793113], being defined as  McCall’s 
Culdoplasty, Uterosacral Ligament Suspension, Sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_793114]/ Abdominal Sacrocolpopexy . 
 
Background   
 
The prev alence of pelvic organ prolapse  (POP)  in the [LOCATION_002]  is estimated to be between  
40-50% with an anticipat ed increase over the next several decades1-3.  Approximately 300,000 
women undergo surgeries to repair  POP in the [LOCATION_002] every year4.  Following pelvic 
reconstructive surgery, r ecurrence  rates  of symptomatic prolapse  range between  6-30%5-9.  This 
number has changed in r ecent years to favor a lower recurrence rate . This change in recurrence 
rate may be attributed to the efforts of pelvic surgeons in restoring proper levels of support 
during repairs.    
 
 
Our understanding of pelvic anatomy an d its support has been significantly improved over 
recent decades, with many researchers reporting on details and mechanics previously not 
understood.  A landmark article by [CONTACT_793125]11 proposed a now widely accepted model 
Crisp/Hill, Api[INVESTIGATOR_793108] [ADDRESS_1093536] of care?  
 
Our purpose therefore is to investigate the proportion of patients undergoing hysterectomy for 
the indication of pelvic organ prolapse at a TriHealth facility who receive a conc urrent api[INVESTIGATOR_793115], which inc ludes : McCall’s Culdoplasty,  
Uterosacral Ligament Suspension, Sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_793116]/ Abdominal 
Sacrocolpopexy .    
 
Research Plan  
• Study Design  
o Retrospective Descriptive Study  
• Setting for the study  
o A retrospective chart review will be performed on TriHealth EPIC platform of 
patients of  TriHealth  who underwent  hysterectomy for  pelvic organ prolapse at 
any of the affiliated TriHealth hospi[INVESTIGATOR_793117] O ctober 2012  and October of 
2017. 
 
• Participants  
o Study population:  All women 18 years of age or older, who underwent 
hysterectomy  for pelvic organ prolapse,  performed a t a TriHealth  facility  
between October 201 2 and October 2017 . 
o A chart review will be performed on all patients identified.

o Inclusion cri teria  
▪ Adults 18 years of age or older  
▪ Underwent hysterectomy  for pelvic organ prolapse, performed at a 
TriHealth facility between October 201 2 and October 2017 
o Exclusion criteria  
▪ Age < 18 years old  
▪ Pelvic Organ Prolapse was not an indication for their surgery  
▪ Surgery performed by a physician of Cincinnati Urogyn ecology  Associates.   
o Sample size  
▪ Given the retrospective nature of this study, a sample size calculation is 
not indicated . However, estimating the number of charts that may be 
available can be g arnered from internal reports on department  activity.  
Between October [ADDRESS_1093537] permission to review up to 250 
cases.  
 
• Data Collection  
o Each c hart will be reviewed and the following data will be collected or 
extrapolated:  
▪ General demographic data – name, date of birth, age, race , parity, BMI  
▪ Select comorbidities  (connective tissue disorders, history of chronic 
constipation, history of chronic cough)  
▪ Operative details – Date of surgery, c oncurrent p rocedures performed, 
type of api[INVESTIGATOR_793118], length of procedure, facility or location of 
procedure performed, estimated blood loss , reported intra -operative 
complications , primary surgeon, wh ether FPMRS or General OB/GYN.  
 
• Intervention or experimental aspect of the study  
o No intervention will occur as part of this study.  
o There are no potential risks to the study population by [CONTACT_793126].  
 
• Statistical Analysis  
o Given the descriptive nature of this study, limited statistical analysis will be 
performed. The proportion of patients who did not have concurrent api[INVESTIGATOR_793119] . Furthermore, the proportion 
of patients who had vario us postoperative outcomes (as defined above) will be 
calculated and compared to previous published literature.  
 
Ethical Considerations  
• Informed consent  
Crisp/Hill, Api[INVESTIGATOR_793108] 4 of 5 
 
 
o Since this is a retrospective study, waivers of Informed Consent and 
Authorization will be requested.  
• Privacy information  
o Extensive efforts will be made to ensure and maintain participant 
confidentiality. All identifying information will be maintained in a secure area 
at all  times. All communication between staff members regarding participant 
data will occu r via the Subject ID number only. However, identifying 
information will be retained in the original/source documents.  
o The Excel spreadsheet will be stored on a password protected, encrypted 
TriHealth computer for ten years following study closure, and then  purged.  
 
Cost/Budget  
• This study will incur no cost to the institution, the participants, or the investigators.

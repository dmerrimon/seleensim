   BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Spasmodic Dysphonia (SD)  
Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is a task -specific focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by [CONTACT_496191].[ADDRESS_637779] described by [CONTACT_496192] 
1939 and was for some time considered a psychiatric disorder.2 The estimated prevalence in western society is 
between 1 in 50,000 and 1 in 100,000.3,4 There are likely multiple neurological processes involved in the 
pathophysiology of SD: reduced cortical inhibition, sensory -processing and reflex disturbances, and 
neuroanatomical findings at several different levels. Thus, SD should be considered an integrative system 
disorder, rather than a disorder with a single pathological focus.[ADDRESS_637780] 
infections, and a history of childhood measles or mumps.1 The eventual development of SD may be viewed as a 
multiple -hit mechanism, with endogenous predispositions and environmental triggers resulting in the 
development of its phenotype. Adductor spasmodic dysphonia (AdSD), characterized by a harsh, strain -
strangled voice with breaks on vowels in speech, is the most common variant of the condition.5 Vocal tremor 
co-occurs in 30% to 60% of AdSD patients.1,[ADDRESS_637781] to diagnosis. Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA) is the most frequently used and studied formulation of 
botulinum neurotoxin.  
Based on the significant symptom response of blepharospasm to intermittent injections of Botox, Blitzer et al. 
performed the first laryngeal injection of Botox for SD in 1984.7,8 Botulinum neurotoxin  is internalized at the 
nerve terminal and works by [CONTACT_496193] (soluble n -ethylmaleimide -sensitive factor [NSF] 
attachment protein receptor) complex, which facilitate the binding of vesicles containing acetylcholine to the 
nerve terminal.9,[ADDRESS_637782] is not fully explained by [CONTACT_496194].9 It may therefore result in disease modulation at a central level.11  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_496187] “off -label” by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
botulinum neurotoxin  has remained the first -line treatment for spasmodic dysphonia.12 botulinum neurotoxin  is 
the recommended primary management strategy in the American Academy of Otolaryngology -Head and Neck 
Surgery’s Clinical Practice Guideline for dysphonia.13 Alternative treatment options for SD include surgical 
treatments, which include thyroarytenoid myotomy/myectomy, thyroplasty, selective laryngeal adductor 
denervation -reinnervation, laryngeal nerve crush, and recurrent laryngeal nerve resection.[ADDRESS_637783] ranged between 14 and 18 weeks. 
There is currently no cure for the condition. Thalamic deep brain stimulation may become a future treatment 
option to interfere with the central pathophysiology of SD.15 
Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IRB [ZIP_CODE].0 10]  Effective: 9/20/[ADDRESS_637784] of anesthetic techniques in 
laryngeal injections.  
Vocal fold injections (VFI) are commonly performed in -office procedures in laryngology that can be used as a 
treatment modality in vocal fold paralysis and in a number of other laryngeal pathologies, in addition to 
enabling the injection of botulinum neurotoxin  in the treatment of SD. These can be performed transcutaneously 
(with multiple techniques), transnasally, or transorally. The transcricothyroid approach (a needle is passed 
through the skin, soft tissue, and cricothyroid membrane) is the most studied technique overall. Specific to the 
treatment of SD, a transcricothyroid approach is favored by 90% of laryngologists treating SD with botulinum 
neurotoxin.[ADDRESS_637785] -choice VFI approach was 93%. Average patient -reported pain on the VAS 
was approximately 40. There was no statistically significant difference in pain between percutaneous and per -
oral VFI approaches (VAS 43.1 versus 38.4). Discomfort score differed significantly between those patients 
who had a VFI successfully completed with the first -choice VFI technique versus those who required more than 
one VFI approach (36.03 versus 61.29).[ADDRESS_637786] 80% of patients reported increased 
pain from baseline to during the procedure and from baseline to after the procedure. The majority of patients 
reported that their pain persisted or worsened during the first post -procedure day. Almost half of patients took 
additional pain medication. A third of patients were still experiencing some discomfort on the third post -
procedure day. They found that the magnitude of the increase in pain during the procedure was significantly 
associated with the presence of pain on the third post -procedure day. This data supports the hypothesis that 
nociceptive sensitization is responsible for lingering pain. In this study, patients reported a significant increase 
in sickening and punishing sensations as well as exhaustion and fear during the procedure.[ADDRESS_637787] of 
laryngologists report not using local anesthesia when treating SD with Botox.12 Nor were alternative anesthetic 
techniques utilized.  
 
  
Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IRB [ZIP_CODE].0 10]  Effective: 9/20/[ADDRESS_637788] been taken to mother so that she could "rub it to make it 
better". Ancient Greeks used vigorous massage to deal with sporting injuries, and by [CONTACT_496195], de 
Mandeville was able to include percussion as a recognized treatment for pain. Percussion analgesia for 
amputation stump pain was recognized in the aftermath of the American Civil War, but this approach was not 
reported until the mid -1940s.22  
 
In the 1960s a mechanism for the anesthetic capability of vibration was proposed. Melzack and Wall’s “gate 
control” theory of pain postulates that the intensity of pain can be reduced by [CONTACT_496196] -noxious 
stimulation, such as vibration.23 Their hypothesis states that the transmission of the sense of vibration from 
mechanoreceptors located in the skin via A -β nerve fibers results in the shutting down of a “gate” through 
which pain signals are transmitted to the brain through A -δ and C fibers.[ADDRESS_637789] in the facial plastic surgery literature analyzing the analgesic properties of vibratory 
stimulation while performing cosmetic injections.21,24 -26 Sharma et al. applied a vibratory stimulus during the 
cosmetic facial injection of Botox.21 There was a statistically significant reduction in patient’s pain scores (1.3 
vs 2.4 on a five -point Likert -type scale). Of the 50 patients, 82% noted that the vibration side of the face had 
lower pain than the side of their face injected without vibration. Further, 86% these patients preferred to utilize 
vibratory analgesia for subsequent injections.21 Mally et al. applied a vibratory stimulus during injection of the 
nasolabial folds with dermal filler.24 They found improved patient tolerance with vibratory stimulation. While 
88% of patients found the injections moderate to severely painful without vibration, only 14% with vibration 
experienced moderate to severe pain.24 This finding was replicated by [CONTACT_496197]. in a randomized split -lip 
study assessing vibration anesthesia during lip augmentation with cosmetic filler.25 The overall pain score on 
the vibration -assisted side was significantly reduced (3.8 vs 5.6 on a ten -point Likert -type scale). Of the [ADDRESS_637790] time. All patients 
that had undergone previous lip augmentation treatments expressed a desire for vibration anesthesia in the 
future.25 Chorney et al. published a prospective, randomized, self -control trial of cosmetic botulinum toxin 
injections comparing vibration anesthesia to topi[INVESTIGATOR_496188].26 There were 30 
injections given with vibration analgesia, with a mean VAS of 26.5. There were 28 injections given with ice 
that resulted in a mean VAS of 24.4. Among the 30 injections given without any analgesia, patients had mean 
VAS of 29.4. There was no statistically significant difference between these groups. Of note this study design 
resulted in a lack of power given only a maximum of 30 injections were present in each arm.  
 
There is additional support for the analgesic properties of vibratory stimulation outside of the facial plastic 
surgery literature. A systematic review evaluated evidence of the effectiveness of vibratory stimulation to 
reduce needle -related procedural pain in children.20 The meta -analysis of this systematic review showed  
Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IRB [ZIP_CODE].0 10]  Effective: 9/20/2017  
 
       Page 5 of 10 
 that vibratory stimulation was significantly effective according to both self -rated and observer -rated pain 
measurements regardless of age group, type of procedure, or type of vibration device.20 Within the dermatology 
literature further support can be found. Park et al. studied VAS scores when vibration anesthesia  
was used during keloid triamcinolone injections. Intralesional injection therapy without vibration  
yielded mean VAS scores of 59 compared to 33 when vibration was used (P < .05).27 Fix et al. studied vibration 
anesthesia during the injection of lidocaine in an open label, randomized, controlled, split -body  
trial. The median VAS pain score was 26 for injections without vibration versus 7.5 with vibration (P<0.01).28 
 
However, no study to date has analyzed the use of vibration analgesia during VFI.

Data Analysis  
 
 
Power analyses may not be appropriate if this is a feasibility or pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], but end -point analysis plans are 
always appropriate even if only exploratory. Provide all information requested below, or provide justification if 
not including all of the information.  
 
Power Statement :   
Sample size estimation is estimated based on the repeated methodology; that is, the VAS score will be measured 
at three time points (initial visit, 3 months and 6 months) for each patient. The comparisons between treatment 
arms (treatment B and C) and control arm (A) are of interest. To preserve the family wise type I error rate, 0.05, 
Bonferroni approach is used to adjust the pairwise type I error (0.05/2 = 0.025). We further assume the standard 
deviation across subjects at the same time point is 3.00, and there is a weak correlation between the VAS (<= 
0.3) within each patient. To achieve 80% to detect statistically significant differences in the mean VAS between 
A and B, and between A and C, the required sample size based on different value of correlation are listed 
below:  
 
 
 
VAS  Required sample size  
A B C Correlation = 0.3  Correlation = 0.1  Correlation = 
0.05

Note: The weaker the correlation and the smaller the mean difference in VAS the larger the sample size.  
Randomization schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_4305].  Randomization will determine the order 
they get these treatments and can follow any permutation.  
 
Data Analysis Plan:  
Data Handling   
The study data will be entered and saved in REDCap. The REDCap database will be created by [CONTACT_197121]. Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_496189].  
Data analysis  
Data will be summarized by [CONTACT_8477] (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range) for 
continuous variables, and frequency count (percentage) for categorical variable. The number of 
patients without the VAS score at 3 - and 6 -months after the initial visit will be reported. Generalized 
estimating equation will be used to compare the mean VAS score between groups, and the point 
estimate of the mean difference and 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
 
Endpoints  
Primary: Response to the Visual Analogue Scale  
Secondary : Patient preference regarding injection analgesia

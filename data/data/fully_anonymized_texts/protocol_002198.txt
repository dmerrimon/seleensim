Clinical Protocol SGI -110-06   
Confidential Information  7 29 October  2018  Study Treatment:  
Guadecitabine : 60 mg/m2 SC daily on Days 1 -5 and Days 8- 12 or on Days 1- 10 (first cycle).  
Second cycle will be 60 mg/m2 for either 10 days (Days 1 -5 and 8 -12 or Days 1 -10) or 5 days (Days 1 -5 only) 
based on assessment of disease response, and hematological recovery by [CONTACT_2006] ≥28 using the following general 
guidelines :  
• Evidence of active leukemia in PB : no need for BM assessment, give second cycle with 10 -day regimen with 
no delay.  
• No evidence of active leukemia in PB: perform BM assessment and decide on course of action as follows:   
- BM blasts ≥5%: give second cycle with the 10 -day regimen with no delay . 
- BM blasts <5%: assess recovery of PB normal counts as follows:  
• Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) >500/ μL and platelets >50,000/µL: give second cycle with no 
delay using the 5 -day regimen.  
• ANC <500/µL or platelets <50,000/µL: Delay treatment and repeat PB at least weekly and give 
second cycle either as a 5 -day regimen ( if both counts recover to a higher level than the limit above 
with no PB blasts); or 10 -day regimen (appearance of evidence of active leukemia with PB blasts 
regardless of normal count recovery).  
For Cycles ≥3, guadecitabine will be given for 5 days only (60 mg/m2/day, Days 1- 5). These guidelines may be 
modified if it is believed to be in the bes t interest of the subject according to  the treating physician’s best clinical 
judgment. Treat ment should be given for at least [ADDRESS_673160] 
continues to benefit based on investigator judgment.  
Treatment Choice (TC):  Before randomization, the investigator will assign each subject to one of the following 
TC options. The following doses and schedules are recommended based on prior published reviews and studies  
(Döhner et al  2015 ; Roboz et al 2014 ); however, small variations of dose, schedule, route, duration of treatment, 
and dose adjustment guidelines are allowed as long as they follow the locally approved prescribing information or institutional standard practice and  are documented in the eCRF. TC options include:  
• High intensity:  
- Intermediate or  high dose cytarabine (HiDAC), recommended as 1 -1.5 g/m
2 every 12 hours or up to 
6 g/m2/day for ≤6 days, maximum 36 g/m2 per cycle.  
- Mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine (MEC): For example: mitoxantrone 6- 12 mg/m2 IV 
(recommended 8 mg/m2), etoposide 80-200 mg/m2 IV (recommended 100 mg/m2), and cytarabine 
1000  mg/m2 IV; each daily for 5 days (Days 1- 5).  
- Fludarabine, cytarabine, G -CSF, +/- idarubicin (FLAG/FLAG -Ida): For example: fludarabine 
25-30 mg/m2 IV daily Days 1 -5; cytarabine 1 -2 g/m2 IV daily for up to 5 days (recommended to be 
given for 4 hours after fludarabine); G -CSF SC daily from Day 6 up to white cell count recovery with or 
without idarubicin 8 mg/m2 IV daily on Days 3 to 5.  
• Low intensity:  
- Low dose c ytarabine (LDAC), 20 mg SC or IV twice daily on Days 1 -10.  
- Decitabine 20 mg/m2 IV daily on Days 1- 5. 
- Azacitidine 75 mg/m2 IV or SC daily on Days 1- 7. 
• BSC only.   
Examples of variations in the above regimens include dose reductions in older subject s (>60 years) or subject s 
with prior HCT for the high intensity regimens; administering FLAG with no G -CSF; small variations in dose 
and days of treatment in the cycle; and giving azacitidine as a [ADDRESS_673161] 30 days of treatment . In 
the guadecitabine arm, earlier treatment cycles (prior to Day 29) are allowed to control high proliferative counts.

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
1.1 Background of the  Disease  
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia diagnosed in adults. In the 
[LOCATION_002], the American Cancer Society estimated that 19,950 new cases of AML will be 
diagnosed in 2016 and approximately 10,430 will die from their dis ease. The average age of a 
patient with AML is about 67 years; AML is generally a disease of older people and is uncommon 
before age 45 (American Cancer Society 201 6). As the population in the [LOCATION_002] ages, there 
appears to be an increasing incidence of AML (National Cancer  Institute  2016) .  
Characteristically AML is a disease associated with termination in cellular differentiation an d 
uncontrolled proliferation of clonal immature myeloid precursors (myeloblasts) in the bone marrow and blood (Scheinberg et al 2001). AML is differentiated from other hematopoietic 
malignancies by [CONTACT_519012] 20% myeloblasts in the bone marrow or blood. AML 
can be divided into de novo and secondary disease (Scheinberg et al 2001; Appelbaum et al 2001).  
Patients presenting with de novo AML often do not have any identifiable risk factor. Secondary causes for AML range from previous myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), Down syndrome, Fanconi anemia, ataxia -telangiectasia, long -term treatment consequences of certain 
chemotherapeutic agents, therapeutic or environmental radiation, and exposure to environmental 
hazards (eg, benzene). The common feature of all AML is genetic mutation, which in 70% of patients results in visible cytogenetic abnormalities when the leukemia cells are karyotyped.  
In AML, myeloblasts crowd out normal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow, leaving the patient with insufficient erythrocytes, platelets, and neutrophils. The consequent pancytopenias cause most of the symptoms of leukemia. Diagnosis is made by [CONTACT_519013] (PB) and bone marrow  (BM) , and no opportunity for early detection exists except 
in patients with antecedent hematologic malignancies or inherited disorders. Diagnosis of AML requires a rapid assessment and initiation of treatment. AML leads to death within a few week s to 
months after diagnosis if left untreated.  
AML is diagnosed and classified according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) 
classification, which considers the genetic, immunophenotypic, biological, and clinical characteristics of the disease (Vardiman et al 2009) . The WHO classification usually supersedes 
the previously used French- American -British (FAB) classification of AML, which was developed 
based on the morphological and cytological characteristics of the disease (Meenaghan et al 2012).

Clinical Protocol SGI -110-[ADDRESS_673171] therapy consists of 2 phases: induction therapy followed by [CONTACT_519014] (Estey and Döhner 2006) . The initial goal in treating AML is to produce 
complete remission with induction chemotherapy. This is followed by [CONTACT_519015] (high- dose cytosine arabinoside or other 
combination regimens) or hematopoi etic cell transplant (HCT) with the ultimate goal of cure.  The 
standard intensive induction chemotherapy has been the same for decades and mainly comprises 7 days of Ara -C and 3 days of an anthracycline (daunorubicin or idarubicin), known as the 7+3 
regime n, which produces remission in 70% to 80% of patients for whom the treatment is 
appropriate (Tefferi and Letendre 2012).  
Patients who do not enter remission after [ADDRESS_673172] levels of less than 5%, 
and morphologically normal hematopoiesis with a neutrophil count over 1000/µL and a platelet count over 100,000/µL (National Comprehensi ve Cancer Network [NCCN]  AML Guidelines  
2014).  
Although up to 80% of AML patients <60 years of age will achieve complete response (CR) with intensive chemotherapy, approximately 30% to 40% of these patients will die from their disease  
(Roboz 2011; Estey 2012) . The outlook for patients >60 years old is significantly worse. Only 
45% to 50% of older patients achieve complete remission and most remitting patients quickly relapse, leading to an overall median survival of approximately 9 months from diagnosis  
(Löwenberg et al 1989 ; Goldstone et al 2001; Wahlin et al 2001; Ross et al 20 15). These figures 
have not improved within the last 3 decades (Roboz 2011; Stalfelt 1994 ; Alibhai et al 2007 ). 
The incidence of AML increases with age, with more than 50% of patients with AML being over 
65 years of age (Medeiros 2015). For these older patients, traditional chemotherapy provides 
minimal chance for durable remission, a s well as significant toxicity, because of patients’ increased 
risk factors and inability to cope with aggressive treatment (Kuendgen and Germing 2009). 
Induction mortality has been reported to be as high as 20% ( Marks 2012 ).  
Patients unable to achieve a CR with standard induction therapy (refractory AML) or whose disease returns after achieving remission (relapsed) are likely to die from their disease (Estey  
2012) . Treatment strategy is directed towards getting the patient into remission and then to 
transplant. Otherwise, palliation is the goal. Patients whose first remission lasted longer than one year have a good chance at achieving a second remission with standard induction therapy and, if 
the transplant is successful, do almost as well as patients transplanted in first remission  
(Ossenkoppele et al 2016) . There are no proven treatment options for subjects with AML refractory 
to intensive remission induction chemotherapy or for subjects who relapse after intensive chemotherapy treatment(s), particularly if they fail re -induction with the standard regimen. Safe 
and effective treatments prolonging survival and/or bridging to transplant are urgently needed for patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r ) AML.

Confidential Information  21 29 October  2018  Choice of treatment  for patients with r/r AML is based mostly on evidence from small studies and 
considers factors such as age, performance status, previous treatment history and responses, 
cytogenetics, access to care, and availability of medications  (Roboz et al 2014) . There are several 
commonly used salvage regimens, most of which include cytarabine as either a single agent or in 
combination regimens (NCCN AML Guidelines 2014) , such as mitoxantrone, etoposide, and 
cytarabine (MEC)  (Archimbaud et al 1991; Archimbaud et al 1995)  and fludarabine, cytarabine, 
granulocyte colony- stimulating factor, and idarubicin (FLAG -Ida). The hypomethylating agents  
(HMAs)  decitabine and azacitidine, though mostly studied in MDS and newly diagnosed AML  
(Kantar jian et al 2012, Fenaux et al 2010, Lubbert et al 2012 ), are often considered an  option for 
frail, older patients with relapsed/refractory AML (Roboz et al 2014). Due to the lack of proven 
treatment for r/r AML, enrollment in a clinical trial is considered an appropriate strategy (NCCN AML Guidelines 2014 ; Roboz  et al 2014).  
1.3 Guadecitabine  
The DNA methylation inhibitors azacitidine and decitabine  (also known as HMAs), are approved 
in several jurisdictions for treatment of intermediate and high risk patients with MDS including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMML ). Guadecitabine is a new chemical entity that 
incorporates decitabine and deoxyguanosine linked by a phosphodiester bond. Unlike decitabine, guadecitabine is resistant to deamination by [CONTACT_301479] (CDAs). Guadecitabine is cleaved by [CONTACT_90169] - and extracellular phosphorylases and other enzymes, releasing decitabine. This 
cleavage in vivo (in primates) resu lts in gradual release of decitabine both extra - and 
intracellularly, thus prolonging decitabine half- life and effective exposure to decitabine.  
Compared with intravenous ( IV) decitabine, decitabine from subcutaneous (SC) guadecitabine had 
prolonged expos ure and lower  maximum concentration (C
max) (Issa et al 2015). This differentiated 
pharmacokinetic (PK) profile is the proposed basis for potential enhancement of clinical activity of guadecitabine.  
Guadecitabine is being evaluated in subjects with hematological malignancies (MDS and AML) 
and solid tumors (ovarian cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]). Long interspersed nucleotide element -1 (LINE -1) demethylation was demonstrated in AML/MDS subjects treated with 
guadecitabine (Issa et al 2015). Clinical responses in subjects with AML and MDS have been observed in the Phase 1-2 study (SGI-110- 01) (Issa et al 2015; Kantarjian et al 2013 ).  
A Phase 3 study (SGI -110-04) of guadecitabine versus treat ment choice (TC) is currently ongoing 
in adults with previously untreated AML who are unfit to receive or who are not considered candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy. Another Phase 3 study 
(SGI -110- 07) of guadecitabine versus TC is planned for adults with MDS or CMML who failed 
or relapsed after prior treatment with azacitidine, decitabine, or both.

1.5 Summary
 of Clinical Data for Guadecitabine  
Guadecitabine has been evaluated in patients with hematological malignancies (MDS and AML) and in patients with solid tumors (ovarian cancer and HCC). LINE -[ADDRESS_673173] been observed in patients with AML and MDS (Study SGI-110- 01), as well as in patients with ovarian cancer and HCC ( Studies SGI-110- 02 and SGI -
110-03).  
The results from the Phase 1 dose escalatio n of Study SGI -110-01 and Phase 2 dose expansion of 
Study SGI -110- 01 in patients with relapsed or refractory AML  (r/r AML ) have been summarized 
below. Please refer to the most recent IB for summaries of the other clinical studies.  
1.5.1 Phase 1 -2 Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Study (Study  SGI -110-01) 
Study SGI -110- [ADDRESS_673174] -in-human (FIH), multicenter, randomized study in patients with 
MDS or AML. It was conducted in 2 phases and enrolled 401 subjects. Phase  1 is complete and 
Phase 2 is ongoing.  • Phase 1 Dose Escalation: 93 subjects with refractory or relapsed MDS or AML treated with 
guadecitabine.  
• Phase 2 Dose Expansion: 308 subjects with MDS or AML treated with guadecitabine. 
All treatment cycles were 28 -day cycles in the Phase 1 -2 study.

Confidential Information  24 29 October  2018  [IP_ADDRESS] Phase 1 Dose Escalation (Study SGI-110- 01) 
Phase 1 dose escalation was performed in subjects with refractory or relapsed MDS or AML  
(Issa et al 2015 ) who had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 
0 to 2 and acceptable liver and kidney function. Co- primary endpoints were maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) and biologically effective dose (BED).  
Subjects were treated with 3 different dosing schedules (Daily×5, Once Weekly for 3 weeks, and 
Twice Weekly for 3 weeks). Guadecitabine was given SC in 28- day cycles starting at a dose of 
3 mg/m2 once daily on Days 1- 5 (Daily×5). Doses were escalated to 125  mg/m2 using the Daily×5 
schedule. The Once- Weekly (Days 1, 8, and 15) dosing schedule was initiated at 6 mg/m2 and was 
escalated to 125  mg/m2. An amendment added the Twice -Weekly (Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18) dosing 
schedule, which investigated guadecitabine at 60 and 90 mg/m2.  
The MTD was 90 mg/m2/day using the Daily×5 schedule for MDS subjects. The MTD was not 
reached for subjects with AML who were dosed up to 125 mg/m2/day Daily×5. Two subjects with 
MDS developed DLTs at the highest dose (125 mg/m2/day) in the Daily×[ADDRESS_673175] 
had thrombocytopenia and neutropenia; the other subject had febrile neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, and fatal sepsis. The MTD was not reached for the once weekly (up to 
125 mg/m2/dose) or the twice weekly (up to 90 mg/m2/dose) regimens.  
Potent dose -related D NA demethylation occurred on the Daily×5 regimen. The BED (defined as 
the minimum dose that achieves maximal demethylation of LINE -1 from 3 successive cohorts) 
was 60  mg/m2/day for the Daily×5 schedule. DNA methylation reached a plateau at 60 mg/m2 and 
was similar at 60, 90, and 125 mg/m2 Daily×5. Less demethylation was observed with the once 
weekly regimen; the twice weekly regimen did not lead to better LINE -1 demethylation than the 
Daily×5 regimen.  
A total of 74 s ubjects with r/r AML were treated with g uadecitabine in Phase 1 dose escalation. 
Responses were observed starting at 36 mg/m2. Of 49 subjects treated at 36 mg/m2 or higher in the 
daily and weekly regimens, 5 composite complete responses (CRc: complete response [CR] + 
complete response with incomplete blood count recovery [CRi] + complete response with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]), including 2 CRs, were observed. A  total of 19 subjects with 
relapsed/refractory MDS were treated in the Phase 1 study. Six subjects with MDS had clinical respons es: 2 subjects had marrow complete response (mCR), and 4 had hematological 
improvement (HI; [ADDRESS_673176] had bi- lineage HI).  
The most common Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) were febrile neutropenia (38/93; 41%), pneumonia (27/93; 29%), thrombocytopenia (23/93; 25%), anemia (23/93; 25%), and sepsis (16/93; 17%). The most common serious AEs (SAEs)  were febrile neutropenia (29/93; 31%), 
pneumonia (26/93; 28%), and sepsis (16/93; 17%).  
In summary, Phase 1 showed that the Daily×5 regimen induced maximal DNA demethylation, and 
the dose of 60 mg/m
2/day Daily×5 was the BED. The 90 mg/m2/day Daily×[ADDRESS_673177] well -tolerated dose for both MDS and AML subjects. Once weekly and twice weekly 
regimens were well tole rated at all doses, but did not improve biological or clinical activity relative 
to the Daily×5 regimen. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 2 (SGI -110- 01 Dose Expansion)  
Phase 2 was a dose- expansion, dose -ranging trial and was opened as a multicenter, open- label, 
randomized comparison of 60 vs 90 mg/m2 guadecitabine SC Daily×5 (once daily on Days 1- 5). 
The 60 mg/m2 Daily×5 dose was chosen because it represented the BED from Phase 1, while the 
90 mg/m2 dose was chosen to explore benefit from a higher dose that was still well tolerated in 
both MDS and AML subjects. Subjects were stratified by [CONTACT_55542] (treatment- naïve elderly 
AML, relapsed/refractory AML, HMA treatment -naïve MDS, and relapsed/refract ory MDS). A 
subsequent amendm ent, applying only to AML subjec ts allowed initial intensification with a 
10-day regimen (dosing on Days 1 -5 and 8 -12) at 60 mg/m2/day for up to 4 cycles, followed by 
[CONTACT_301480]×[ADDRESS_673178] in 
r/r AML subjects and then in treatm ent-naïve elderly AML subjects.  
Phase 2 in the cohort of subjects w ith r/r AML is complete  and the  results for these subjects are 
described below. Key eligibility for r/r AML subjects in Study SGI -110-01 Phase 2 included 
age ≥[ADDRESS_673179] treatment, 
and ECOG performance status of 0 -2. 
There was no limit on the number of prior regimens, white blood cell (WBC) count, or bone 
marrow (BM) blasts count . Only 1 previous cycle of decitabine or azacitidine was allowed. 
Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3 classification ) were excluded from the study. 
Subjects were randomized to receive either 60 or 90 mg/m2/day guadecitabine once daily on Days 
1-5 of a 28- day cycle. An additional 10- day cohort was added ; subjects in this cohort were treated 
with 60 mg/m2/day guadecitabine once daily on Days  1-[ADDRESS_673180] 2 cycles followed by [CONTACT_941] 5- day regimen in subsequent cycles.  The primary endpoint for  r/r 
AML subjects was CRc rate  (CRc rate = CR + CRp + CRi).  
A total of 108 subjects were enrolled with r/r AML  in Phase 2 , of whom 103 subj ects received 
treatment. Fifty subjects were randomized and treated with the 5 -day regimen  (24 and 26 subjects 
received study treatment  at 60 or 90 mg/m2 Daily×5, respectively ). Fifty -three  subjects were 
enrolled and treated with guadecitabine 60 mg/m2 in the 10- day regimen  
(according to protocol amendment 3, without randomization).  
Table  1 presents demographic and baseline characteristics for subjects with r/r AML enrolled and 
treated in Phase 2 Dose Expansion. The median age of subjects was 60 years, 60% of subjects 
were m ale, and 81% were White. The 10- day group was nearly equally divided between the sexes 
(51% men) compared with the 5-day group (70% men), but all other demographic characteristics 
were similar across treatment groups. Most subje cts (73%) had an ECOG status of  1 at baseline 
and had received a median of 2 prior regimens with up to 10 prior regimens including 11% with

Guadecitabine effects on global DNA methylation were measured by a quantitative bisulfite 
pyrosequencing method for LINE -1 methylation analysis as previously reported (Yang et al  
2004) . Ninety- three subjects with r/r  AML provided sufficient samples at different time points to 
assess guadecitabine effects on LINE -1 methylation: 22 treated with 60 mg/m2 on the 5 -day 
regimen, 21 with 90 mg/m2 on the 5- day regimen, and 50 with 60 mg/m2 on the 10 -day regimen. 
Figure 2 shows the kinetics of LINE -1 demethylation for these 3 groups of subjects. There was not 
a major difference in extent and duration of LINE -1 demethylation between subjects treated on the 
5-day regimen at doses of 60 or 90 mg/m2: the maximum mean (±SE) LINE -1 demethylation 
was -20.6% ± 2.8 for 60 mg/m2 and -22.6% ± 2.8 for 90 mg/m2. Both groups of subjects on the 5-
day regimen re -methylated LINE -1 sequences with the same kinetics. Maximum LINE -1 
demethylation was grea ter with the 10 -day regimen ( -30.6% ± 1.6) than with the 5- day regimen. 
Further, for the 10- day regimen, this decrease was sustained until Day 15.

The 30- and 60- day all -cause mortality rates (Table  4 were similar across treatments. Early all -
cause mortality was reported in 3.9% and 11.7% of subjects for 30- day and 60- day mortality, 
respectively, which is lower than what would be expected from intensive cytotoxic therapy. The 
consistently higher incidence of Grade ≥3 AEs reported with  the 10- day regimen (Table  3) did not 
translate into higher early mortality, suggesting that the increase in toxicity was manageable in the 
context of a fatal disease such as r/r AML.

Based on these results for r/r AML, we conclude that the recommended regimen comprises the 
previously identified BED of 60 mg/m2/day for 5 days (Days 1- 5), with initial intensification  
(first 1 -2 cycles) with 10 -day dosing (Days 1- 5 and 8- 12). This regimen, including the initial 
intensification, appears to facilitate a higher response rate which is associated with a trend for  
better overall survival, with more rapid response and more subjects bridged to transplant. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_518998] ≥3 AEs in the 10- day regimen, no increase in early mortality was noted with that

Confidential Information  31 29 October  2018  1.5.2 Phase 3 Trial in Previously Untreated AML (Study SGI -110-04) 
A Phase 3 study of guadecitabine versus treatment choice is ongoing in adults with previously 
untreated AML who are unfit to receive or who are not considered candidates for intensive remission induction chemotherapy. The study is a randomized, open- label, multicenter 
(approximately 100-160 centers) global clinical trial of guadecitabine (60 mg/m
2 Daily×5) versus 
treatment choice (cytarabine, decitabine, or azacitidine).   
1.[ADDRESS_673185] version of the Guadecitabine IB. Commonly 
observed AEs (regardless of relationship to treatment) in Study SGI-110- 01 in subjects with AML 
or MDS include injection site AEs, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, 
fatigue, and nausea. All these AEs and any AEs related to myelosuppression and infection such as pneumonia and sepsis are expected risks of guadecitabine in this Phase 3 trial in r/r AML.  
Potential benefits of guadecitabine include symptom improvement, improvement in blood counts, decreased need for transfusions, delayed disease progression, delayed need for subsequent anticancer therapy, and prolongation of survival.  
Risk-benefit considerations favor performance of this trial. This study population has limited 
therapeutic options, and available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_104764].  
2.0 RATIONALE  
2.1 Rationale for the Study  
Rationale for this study comes from guadecitabine's molecular structure, PK, pharmacodynamics  
(PD), and clinical data.  
Guadecitabine's dinucleotide structure protects the active decitabine metabolite from inactivation 
by [CONTACT_104798] (CDA). Human PK data confirms that gradual in vivo dinucleotide cleavage increases decitabine exposure time and effective half -life rel ative to decitabine IV infusion. 
Prolonged exposure time is predicted to increase efficacy because decitabine activity is dependent on its incorporation into DNA during DNA synthesis, ie, S -phase of the cell cycle  
(Griffith s et al 2013; Karahoca and Momparler 2013) . Prolonged exposure results in more cancer 
cells susceptible to decitabine activity as they enter into S -phase. Also, a lower decitabine C
max 
after guadecitabine relative to decitab ine IV infusion might improve safety for toxicities associated 
with peak decitabine concentrations.  
During the FIH Phase 1 SGI -110- 01 Dose Escalation, potent DNA demethylation, CR, and other 
clinical responses were observed in heavily pretreated subjects with AML and MDS, including 
those previously treated with other existing HMAs (decitabine and azacitidine). 
In the Phase 2 SGI -110- 01 Dose Expansion in subjects with r/r AML, 24 of 103 subjects responded 
to treatment with guadecitabine (Table  2), showing that guadecitabine is clinically active in 
Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Guadecitabine 
Clinical Protocol SGI -110-06   
Confidential Information  32 29 October  2018  heavily pretreated subjects with AML. The overall CRc rate was 23.3 % (95% CI: 15.5- 32.7) and 
the median overall survival in r/r AML subjects was 197  days (6.6 months [95% CI: 164, 
246 days]). In comparison, a recent Phase [ADDRESS_673186] 
(elacytarabine) to treatment choice in r/r AML had similar overall response rates to those found 
with guadecitabine ( CR+ CRi of 23% and 21% for elacytarabine and treatment choice groups, 
respectively) but had lower m edian survival (3.5 months and 3.3 months for elacytarabine and 
treatment choice groups, respectively) (Roboz et al 2014).  
2.2 Rationale for Guadecitabine  Dose and Regimen  
In the Phase 2 SGI -110- 01 Dose Expansion in subjects with r/r AML, t here was no difference in 
responses or survival between guade citabine regimens of 60 and 90 mg/m2 daily  for 5 da ys, so 
60 mg/m2/day was the selected dose. That study in r/r AML subjects also included a 10-day cohort, 
in which subjects were treated initially with a 10 -day regimen (Days 1- 5 and Days 8- 12) for up to 
[ADDRESS_673187] the 
toxicity, as evidenced by [CONTACT_519017] 5- day regimen. In particular, the 
incidence of related Grade ≥3 AEs and relat ed SAEs was higher in the 10- day group compared 
with the 5 -day group. All -cause mortality (30 - and 60- day), however, was similar between the 
regimens, so higher toxicity with the 10- day regimen did not translate to higher mortality. Few 
subjects in either regimen discontinued treatment due to AEs. 
Based  on these results for r/r AML, we conclude that the recommended regimen comprises the 
previously identified BED of 60 mg/m
2/day for 5 days (Days 1- 5), with initial intensification  
(first 1 -2 cycles) with 10 -day dosing (Days 1- 5 and 8-12 or Days 1-10). This regimen, including 
the initial intensification, appears to facilitate rapid response in heavily pretreated AML subjects with limited additional toxicity and therefore provides the most favorable benefit/r isk in this 
patient  population. We recommend limiting  the number of cycles of the 10- day regimen to 2 to 
limit the additional Grade ≥3 AEs.

guadecitabine will be given for 10 days on Days 1- 5 and Days 8-12 or on Days 1-10. The second 
cycle will be either the 5-day regimen  (Days 1 -5) or 10-day regimen  (Days 1 -5 and 8-12 or 
Days  1-10) based on assessment of disease response and hematological recovery  at the end of 
Cycle 1 . In subsequent cycles guadecitabine treatment will be for 5 days only (Days 1-5). 
Guadec itabine t reatment should be given for at least [ADDRESS_673192] continues to benefit based on inve stigator judgment.  
Treatment cycles are intended to be repeated every 28 days. However, treatment delays are permitted to allow normal count hematological recovery in the absence of PB blasts, particularly 
with more intensive treatment such as guadecitabi ne 10 -day regimen, HiDAC, MEC, and 
FLAG/Ida. Visits will occur on treatment days, as necessary. In addition, during the first 3 cycles, visits will occur weekly on Days 8, 15, and 22, then on Day 15 in Cycles 4-6. In Cycles >6, visits will only occur on tr eatment days (if necessary), with study specified assessments on Day 1. 
Additional visits based on treatment effect and blood counts may be done at the investigator’s discretion. Subjects will attend a safety follow -up visit after the last study treatment.  For subjects 
who discontinue study treatment before Cycle 6, long term follow -up visits will occur monthly 
until [ADDRESS_673193] 28 days. Subjects with disease progression leading to study therapy discontinuation may receive 
any other alternative anti -leukemia therapy; however, subjects in the TC arm are not allowed t o 
cross over to guadecitabine.  
Data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_519019] (DMC) at regular intervals 
primarily to evaluate safety during study conduct. Based on data from 278 randomly assigned 
subjects, the DMC recommended to stop further enrollment into the trial based on futility analysis 
that showed the trial is unlikely to show superiority of guadecitabine over TC for OS. 
Consequently, the study was closed to further enrollment in September 2018 (Amendment 4). The primary efficacy endpoint is OS, which will be assessed after at least [ADDRESS_673194] 6 cycles of treatment as well as during long- term follow -up visits. Subjects should be followed for 
survival information until death, withdrawal of consent, or termination of the clinical trial.

Standard intensive induction chemotherapy comprises 7 days of Ara -C and 3 days of an 
anthracycline (daunorubicin or idarubicin), known as the 7+3 regimen, which produces remission 
in 70%- 80% of patients for whom the treatment is appropriate  (Tefferi and Letendre 2012).  Less 
intensive regimens due to patients’ age and/or comorbidities are acceptable as long as they include cytarabine and an anthracycline, including the recently approved CPX -351. For patients wit h

combination regimens. HMAs  are also u sed, as discussed in Section  1.2. 
TC, the control therapy for this study, includes the treatments listed in Section  4.1. These therapi[INVESTIGATOR_104770], and regional treatment standards vary. Hence, all of these are allowed. TC doses and schedules specified in Section  7.2 are based on prior published reviews and

This study is open- label. The OS primary endpoint is not prone to observer bias. It would be 
difficult to conduct this trial in a blinded fa shion due to differences in treatment schedules and

Subjects who discontinue  study treatment will be followed up for important study data, as 
described below, unless they withdraw consent from further  follow-up. Medical records or 
publicly available information may be used to document date of death as needed. 
5.4.1 Discontinuation from Study Treatment  
Subje cts who discontinue  study treatment will still continue study follow -up procedures. 
Investigators are encouraged to assess all subjects according to the study protocol even after 
discontinuation from  study treatment.  
• Investigators can discontinue subjects from study treatment in case of unacceptable toxicity, 
non-compliance, disease progression requiring alternative therapy, or if the investigator 
determines it is in the subject 's best interest.  
• Astex Pharmaceuticals  may require that a subject is discontinued from treatment for safety 
reasons or for noncompliance.  
In all cases, the reason(s) for discontinuation from study treatment must be recorded in the source 
document and on the relevant page of the subject 's case report form or electronic case report form 
(CRF/eCRF ).  
It is important to obtain protocol- specified follow- up information on any subject discontinued from 
study treatment. Section  10.[ADDRESS_673206] starts 
alternative anti -leukemia treatment  for AML  (except for hydroxyurea as specified in 
Section  7.4.1) , whichever happens earl ier (see Section  10.4 ). Collection of AEs and concomitant 
medications may also continue until the decision is made to permanently discontinue study treatment.  Subjects in the BSC group will be considered to be on study treatment until they have

(if the subject  did not withdraw because of disease progression), subsequent anti -leukemia 
treatment, survival information, and safety da ta.  
The investigator must also ensure the subject understands that  his or her medical records may  
continue to be available for the follow -up period as described in the approved informed consent 
form (ICF).  
5.4.[ADDRESS_673208] will be assigned a unique number (subject number) which will comprise the center number and the assigned subject number within the center. This number will be used to identify the subject throughout the study.  
6.1 Randomization 
Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to study treatment. Treatment assignments for the individual subjects will be determined through a computer generated rando mization scheme and 
accessed through an interactive response system. Instructions for access and use of the interactive response system for randomization will be provided to participating study centers separately.  
Randomization will be 1:1 between guadecitabine and TC groups, and will be stratified by [CONTACT_519018] (high intensity vs low intensity vs BSC), ECOG performance 
status (0 -1 vs 2), baseline cytogenetics (poor risk vs other ; see Appendix 3) , and study center 
region (North America vs ROW).  
Selection of [ADDRESS_673209]. Subjects should receive study treatment as soon as possible after randomization (maximum of 1 week between 
randomization and treatment).

The sponsor 
recommends following Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
Guidelines
 for handling cytotoxic drugs outlined in Yodaiken and Bennett (1986)  or similar 
institutional or country -specific guidelines. Preparation should occur according to institutional 
practice. For skin contact [CONTACT_301483][INVESTIGATOR_4598], refer to the material safety data sheet (MSDS) fo r treatment 
options. 
Reconstituted drug product is intended for SC administration at a recommended concentration of 
100 mg/mL.  
Records of the receipt and dispensing of drug supplies will be kept at the study centers and reconciled at the end of the study to provide a complete accounting of all used and unused IMP . 
7.1.2 IMP  Regimens and Administration  
Guadecitabine will be given SC at a  dose of 60 mg/m
2 in 28 -day cycles  (delayed as necessary to 
allow blood count recovery, see Section  7.3.1) . For the first cycle guadecitabine will be given for 

Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Guadecitabine 
Clinical Protocol SGI -110-[ADDRESS_673212] 5 days, 
guadecitabine can be given on Days 1- 10 without interruption .  
The s econd cycle will be 60 mg/m2 for either 10 days (Days 1- 5 and 8-12, or in the case of appare nt 
progression, can be Days 1 -10) or 5 days (Days 1 -5 only) based on assessment of disease response, 
and hematological recovery at the end of Cycle 1, using the following general guidelines :  
• Evidence of active leukemia in PB: no need for BM assessment, give second cycle with 10- day 
regimen with no delay.  
• No evidence of active leukemia in PB : perform BM assessment and decide on course of action 
as follows:   
• BM blasts ≥5%: give second cycle with the 10-day regimen with no delay. 
• BM blasts <5%: assess recovery of PB normal counts as follows:  
• Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) >500/µL and platelets >50,000/µL: give second 
cycle with no delay using the 5- day regimen.  
• ANC <500/µL or platelets <50,000/µL: Delay treatment and repeat PB at least weekly 
and give second cycle either as a 5 -day regimen ( if both counts recover to a higher level 
than the limit above with no PB blasts); or 10 -day regimen ( appearance of evidence of 
active leukemia with PB blasts regardless of normal count recovery). 
For Cycles ≥3, gua decitabine will be given for 5 days only (60 mg/m2/day, Days 1 -5). These 
guidelines may be modified if it is believed to be in t he best interest of the subject  according to the 
treating physician’s best clinical judgment. Treatment should be given for at l east [ADDRESS_673213] 2  to 3 cycles and full 
response may need 6  or more cycles (Kropf et al 2015) . Maintaining treatment after response is 
essential to avoid quick relapse (Cabrero et al 2015 ). 
Administer guadecitabine by [CONTACT_10530], preferably in the abdominal area, upper thigh, or arm. The total amount (in mg) of guadecitabine to be administered is determined by [CONTACT_51737]  
(BSA). In calculating BSA, use actual heights  and weights. Do not adjust to “ideal” body weight. 
The institutional standard for calculating BSA is acceptable.  
Take c are to avoid intradermal injection, as this may result in injection site pain (see  
Section  8.4). 
Additional g uidelines regarding SC injection will be detailed in the Study Procedures Manual. 
Investigators are prohibited from supplying guadecitabine to any subject not enrolled in this s tudy 
or to any physicians or scientists except those designated as sub- investigators. The investigator 
must ensure that subjects receive guadecitabine only from personnel who fully understand the procedur es for administering the study treatment.

The TC  options for this study include high intensity, low intensity and BSC. Before randomization, 
the investigator will assign each  subject to one of the following TC options:  
High intensity: 
• Intermediate or high dose cytarabin e (HiDAC) , recommended as 1 -1.5 g/m2 every 12 hours or 
up to 6 g/m2/day for ≤6 days, maximum 36 g/m2 per cycle.  
• MEC: For example: mitoxantrone 6 -12 mg/m2 IV (recommended 8 mg/m2), etoposide 80-200 
mg/m2 IV (recommended 100 mg/m2), and cytarabine 1000 mg/m2 IV; each daily for 5 days 
(Days 1 -5).   
• FLAG/FLAG -Ida: For example: fludarabine 25-30 mg/m2 IV daily Days 1-5; cytarabine 
1-2 g/m2 IV daily for up to 5 days (recommended to be given for 4 hours after fludarabine); G -
CSF SC daily from Day 6 up to white cel l count recovery with or without idarubicin 8 mg/m2 
IV daily on Days 3 to 5. 
Low intensity: 
• LDAC 20 mg SC or IV twice daily on Days 1-10.  
• Decitabine 20 mg/m2 IV daily on Days 1-5. 
• Azacitidine 75 mg/m2 IV or SC daily on Days 1-7. 
Best supportive care  (BSC) only: given according to standard and institutional practice  (refer to  
Section  7.4.1) . 
TC administration guidelines and duration will be based on approved prescribing information and 
institutional standard practice. The above doses and schedules are recommended based on prior 
published reviews and studies (Döhner et al 2015 ; Roboz et al  2014); however, small variations of 
dose, schedule, route, duration of treatment, and dose adjustment guidelines are allowed as long 
as they follow the locally approved prescribing information or institutional standard practice and are documented in the CRF/eCRF . 
Examples of variations in the above regimens include dose reductions in older subject s  
(> 60 years) or subject s with prior HCT for the high intensity regimens; administering FLAG with 
no G- CSF; small variations in dose and d ays of treatment in the cycle; and giving azacitidine as a

2/day to 45 mg/m2/day, then to 30 mg/m2/day, 
and then to 15 mg/m2/day with the Daily×5 regimen.

according to institutional standards and relevant locally approved Prescribing Information.  
7.4 Concomitant Treatment  
On the concomitant medication CRF/eCRF, document a ll medications a subject takes, starting 
from [ADDRESS_673217] dose of study treatment , or 
start of new anti -leukemia treatment  for AML  (except for hydroxyurea as specified in  
Section  7.4.1) , whichever is first. Collection of concomitant medications may also continue until 
the decision is made to permanently discontinue study treatment  (in the event that  this decision 
occurs more than [ADDRESS_673218] dose of study treatment) . Prior anti- AML  and anti -MDS  
therapy should be documented regardless of timing with randomization. Include supporti ve or 
palliative treatment  whether prescription or nonprescription. I nclude start and stop date s and 
indication.  7.4.[ADDRESS_673219] can still continue on guadecitabine study treatment . 
Intrathecal treatment to control CNS disease is allowed for all subjects as a concomitant treatment. Supportive care  includes, but is not limited to treatment with hydroxyurea, blood transfusions 
(RBCs or platelets), growth factors including erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs), granulocyte stimulating factors (GSFs), iron chelating therapy, and broad spectrum antibiotics 
and/or antifungals . The investigator is permitted to prescribe supportive treatment(s) at his or her 
discretion. Give s upportive treatment according to the institu tional standard practice or other 
established standard of care guidelines.  Investigators are also allowed to give donor lymphocytes 
infusion (DLI) if it is part of their standard practice in certain subjects with r/r AML . Any 
supportive or other concomitant treatment should be documented in the provided CRFs/eCRFs.  
During treatment cycles of guadecitabine 10- day regimen and all high intensity regimens in the 
TC arm , prophylactic broad spectrum antibiotics and prophylactic broad spectrum antifungal 
treatment, with activity against Aspergillus species, such as posaconazole and voriconazole are 
highly recommended.

7.4.2 Prohibited Medications  
Other anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], unless specified in the protocol  (eg, endocrine therapy de scribed in 
exclusion criteria), are not to be used . Cytotoxic chemotherapy and investigational treatments are 
prohibited for as long as subjects remain on study treatment. 
Vaccination with live vaccines is prohibited while subjects remain on study treatment.  
7.[ADDRESS_673221] the actual dose of study drug administered in the source document and on the Dosing 
CRF/eCRF . Record any adverse clinical signs and symptoms associated with a potential overdose 
on the AE CRF /eCRF s. Report signs and symptoms of a potential overdose that meet SAE  criteria 
(defined in Section  10.1.2)  to Astex on the SAE form within 24 hours (see 
Section  10.3 ). Treat any AE (including SAE ) based on standard care for the specific signs and 
symptoms.  
8.0 RISKS/PRECAUTIONS  
For guadecitabine, refer to the most recent version of the IB for  the most current risks and 
precautions for guadecitabine, as well as a complete list of AEs considered expected with 
guadecitabine therapy. For risks and benefits of TC therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], refer to the latest locally approved Prescribing Information for each therapy. 
Since guadecitabine is an investigational drug, unexpected and potentially clinically significant 
AEs or SAEs may occur with its use. All subjects treated with guadecitabine should be closely monitored. The active metabolite of guadecitabine is decitab ine so all events expected with 
decitabine would also be considered expected for guadecitabine (Dacogen Prescribing  
Information ). 
Guadecitabine should not be given to women who are pregnant or to subjects with known sensitivity to decitabine. 
8.1 Dose Limiting Toxicities  
DLTs  related to myelosuppression occurred in 2 subjects with MDS in the Phase 1 Dose Escalation 
(SGI -110- 01) at a dose of 125 mg/m
2 SC Daily×5 and included thrombocytopenia  (Grade 4), 
neutropenia (Grade 4), and sepsis (Grade 5). There were no DLTs  in subjects with AML.  
Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Guadecitabine 
Clinical Protocol SGI -110-06   
Confidential Information  48 29 October  2018  8.2 Myelosuppression (Neutropenia, Febrile Neutropenia, Thrombocytopenia, and 
Anemia)  
Myelosuppression is the primary toxicity associated with administration of guadecitabine and its 
effects after 5 consecutive days of administration are maximal between Days 15 and 22 in a cycle with recovery in 1 to 3 weeks. With the 10- day regimen (dosing on Days 1- 5 and 8-12 or on 
Days  1-10) the nadir is lower and lasts longer than with the 5- day regimen. Panc ytopenia is a 
hallmark of AML and MDS and may aggravate or obscure the effects of guadecitabine. However, if a clinical response occurs and normal hematopoietic cells repopulate the bone marrow, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia may abate. 
Complete blood and platelet counts should be performed as needed to monitor counts. Since 
myelosuppression and infection events are also manifestations of the underlying disease of AML , 
careful investigator judgment regarding relationship to treatment is important to guide  the decision 
whether to dose delay, dose reduce, or both. The cyclic nature of myelosuppression (reduction of counts between Day 8- 15 and trend to recover by [CONTACT_2006] 22- 28 or later) could be more 
indicative of a drug effect, while persistent low counts regardless of treatment is probably more indicative of a disease effect that needs to be treated without dose delay. Investigators should use their clinical judgment guided by [CONTACT_301487] (see Section  7.3.1 ), and should use the guidelines of dose adjustment for TC 
options as per their local prescribing information and standard practice.

reported in the AML/MDS population and in subjects with solid tumors. Injection site reactions 
are related to guadecitabine SC administration and are mostly Grade [ADDRESS_673223] AEs observed in the Phase 1 -2 clinical trial are common in the AML/MDS population. 
Common AEs, regardless of relationship to guadecitabine, observed in the AML/MDS populations (r/r AML, treatment- naïve [TN] AML, TN MDS, r/r MDS, N=308 [Phase  2 Dose Expa nsion]) 
treated with guadecitabine (60 -90 mg/m
2 Daily×5 or 60 mg/m2 10-day regimen in AML only) 
include injection site AEs, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, anemia, and constipation. The most common SAEs were febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, and sepsis.  
MDS and AML subjects commonly have severely compromised bone marrow and blood counts. Severe or prolonged myelosuppression ha s been reported as related to guadecitabine, particularly 
at high doses when the drug may exert cytotoxic effects.

9.0 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
9.1 Efficacy Assessments  
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_301488] (OS, EFS, and survival rates at 1 and 2 years ), 
transfusion needs for RBC and platelets (independence and number of transfusions), response  (CR, 
CRh, CRc, CRi , CRp, and partial response  [PR]), HCT rate, NDAOH, and health -related QOL.   
Survival:  Survival will be monitored and documented throughout the study. Survival status will 
be monitored and recorded as long as possible during the long- term follow -up period. 
Transfusions/Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]: All blood and platelet transfusions will be documented and used 
to determine transfusion independence and to calculate the number of transfusions. One 
transfusion is defined as [ADDRESS_673225] 6 months 
then at every study visit until disease progression . For subjects who discontinue study treatment 
before Cycle  6, transfusions/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519000] 6 months after the start 
of study treatment , then at every study visit until disease progression . 
Response Assessments:  Clinical response is based on both PB sampling and BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_519001]. If BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_519002], slides 
should include touch prep slides. In cycles where a BM sample is not collected, the most recent 
previous BM sample will be used for response assessment.

persistence of ≥5% leukemic blasts that excludes the possibility of  a marrow response. After Cycle 
6, BM assessment, BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_5179] (with touch prep slides) will be repeated every [ADDRESS_673226] year on study and then every 6 mon ths thereafter until PB or BM assessment shows 
disease progression or relapse.   
Response evaluation may be done centrally by [CONTACT_519021], using the modified 2003 IWG AML response criteria (Cheson et 
al 2003; Tab le 6).

a Responses are based on both PB and BM conditions.  
b For the purpose of response assessment and according to published IWG criteria, blasts may be seen in PB 
because rare PB blasts may be identified during regeneration, but the subject is in CR if BM blasts  are <5% 
with no Auer rods (Cheson et al 2003).  
ANC=absolute neutrophil count; CR=complete response; CRh=complete response with partial hematologic 
recovery; CRp=complete response with incomplete platelet recovery; CRi=CR with incomplete blood count 
recovery.

efficacy observed.  
• CR; CRp  and CRi, including the subset of subjects with CRh; partial response.  
• Composite CR (CRc=CR+CRp+CRi).  
Subjects who did not have a sufficient post-treatment efficacy assessment ( eg, no BM or PB 
assessment) will be classified as nonevaluable for response presentations. These subjects will be included in the denominator of the  intent- to-treat (ITT) analysis for calculation of different 
response rates. Subjects who cannot be classified into a response category (CR, CRp, CRi, partial 
response) or the nonevaluable category will be classified as nonresponders.

Clinical Protocol SGI -110-[ADDRESS_673228] Rate:  In subjects who undergo HCT, time to stem cell engraftment and 100- day mortality 
rate post HCT will be assessed.  Time to engraftment will be calculated from the day of transplant 
to the first day of 3 consecutive days of PB ANC of >500/µL. 
Quality of Life: Health -related QOL will be assessed using the EQ -5D™, which is a standardized 
instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. QOL assessments will consist of the EQ -5D 
level health questionnaire (EQ -5D- 5L) and the EQ VAS which will be administered before 
treatment on Day 1 of each cycle for 6 cycles and then at every study visit until disease progression; 
for subjects who discontinue study treatment before Cycle  6, QOL will be assessed monthly until 
6 months after the start of study treatment, then at every study visit until disease progression .

Additional visits (not specified in Table  7) may be conducted for PB assessment, BM aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/  
biopsy, chemistry assessment, or AE evaluation, at the investigator's discretion. 
9.7 Missed Evaluations  
Evaluations should occur within the visit window specified by [CONTACT_760]. If an evaluation  is 
missed, reschedule and perform it  as close as possible to the original date . If rescheduling becomes, 
in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], medically unnecessary because the evaluation would occur too close 
to the next scheduled evaluation, it may be omitted . For guadecitabine dosing, if a dose is missed 
on one or more days, it should be administered as soon as possible to complete the full 5-day 
course (see Section  7.3.1) . For TC dosing, if a dose is missed, it should be made up in a manner 
consistent with institutional standards (see Section  7.3.2).  
10.0 EVALUATION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1 Definitions  
10.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal finding in laboratory tests or other diagnostic procedures), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without 
any judgment about causality . An AE can arise from any use of the drug and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
Disease progression is not considered to be an AE or serious adverse event (SAE). If there are 
specific AEs that are always part of disease progression, these do not need to be reported as AEs 
Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Guadecitabine 
Clinical Protocol SGI -110-06   
Confidential Information  64 29 October  2018  or SAEs.  Pre-existing medical conditions (other than natural progression of the disease being 
studied) judged by [CONTACT_301493] -specified AE reporting period will be reported as AEs  or SAEs as 
appropriate. 
An AE or SAE can also be a complication that occurs as a result of protocol mandated procedures 
(eg, invasive procedures such as biopsies).  
10.1.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
An AE is considered serious, if in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any 
of the following outcomes: • Death.  
• A life-threatening AE . 
An AE is considered "life-threatening " if in the view of either the investigator, or sponsor, its 
occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death . It does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324].  
• A persistent or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions . 
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening or require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based on the appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in the definition of SAE. Examples of such medical events are intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. For clarification, Grade [ADDRESS_673240]’s death. R ecord screening procedure -related AEs that occur befo re the start of 
study treatment. 
Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Guadecitabine 
Clinical Protocol SGI -110-[ADDRESS_673241] 's CRF /eCRF , in the source document, and if applicable , record on the SAE 
form. Whenever possible, the investigator should group signs and symptoms (including laboratory 
tests or other results of diagnostic procedures) into a single diagnosis under a single term. For example, cough, rhinitis, and sneezing might be reported as "upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] " or a 
pulmonary infiltrate, positive sputum culture and fever might be reported as "pneumonia." 
To optimize consistency of AE reporting across centers, ask the subject a standard, general, non-
leading question to elicit any AEs (such as "Have you had any new symptoms, injuries, illnesses 
since your last visit? ").  
Death is an outcome of an SAE and usually not itself an SAE , unless it is death with no  identifiable 
cause or event . In all other cases,  record the cause of death as the SAE. Investigators will asses s 
the status of previously reported, and occurrence of new AEs and SAEs at all subject evaluation 
time points during the study. 
10.2.1 Severity  
Use the d efinitions found in the CTCAE version 4.03 for grading the severity ( intensity) of AEs. 
The CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_673242] experience any AE not 
listed in the CTCAE v 4.03, use the following grading system to assess severity : 
• Grade 1 – Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
• Grade 2 – Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL), such as preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_263283], using the telephone, managing money, etc. 
• Grade 3 – Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limiting self -care ADL, such as bathing, 
dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. 
• Grade 4 – Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade 5 – Death related to AE.  
10.2.2 Relationship to Study Treatment  (Suspected Adverse Reactions)  
Assess all AEs/SAEs for relationship to study treatment or if applicable, to study procedure. 
If an AE/SAE occurs before the first dose of study treatment , report it only if it is considered 
related to a study -specif ic procedure ( eg, bleeding or local infection after skin punch biopsy). 
Those events will be recorded in the study database but will not be part of the treatment - emergent 
AE analysis.  
Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Guadecitabine 
Clinical Protocol SGI -110-[ADDRESS_673243] a causality assessment of each 
component to aid in analysis. 
Related   
(Suspected Adverse 
Reaction)  A suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. Reasonable 
possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE such as 
a plausible temporal 
relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of the drug; and/or the AE follows a known pattern of response to the drug; 
and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the drug or 
dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon rechallenge. Further examples of type of evidence that would suggest a ca usal 
relationship between the drug and the AE: 
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure ( eg
, angioedema, 
hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome), 
• One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly 
associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug ( eg, acute myocardial infarction 
in a young woman), 
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical study (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or 
condition under investigation or other events that commonly 
occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that 
indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug 
treatment group that in a concurrent or hist orical control group.

Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are SAEs that qualify for mandatory 
expedited reporting to regulatory authorities where the SAE is suspected to be caused by [CONTACT_519024] (ie, not defined as expected in the current IB clinical study 
protocol , or approved labeling for marketed drugs). In this case, Astex Pharmaceuticals Drug 
Safety or designee will report to the relevant regulatory authorities an d forward a formal 
notification describing the S[LOCATION_003]R to investigators, according to regulatory requirements . Each 
investigator must then notify his or her IRB/IEC  of the S[LOCATION_003]R as required by [CONTACT_301496]/IEC  policy.

11.0 STATISTICS  
Statistical analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_104821].  
Data summaries and listings will be generated using SAS version 9.3 or a more recent version   
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]).  
The statistical analysis plan and/or the clinical study report will provide additional details of the 
analysis, which may include details of missing and, if applicable, unused data, as well as additional 
sensitivity analyses of the primary and secondary variables. The clinical study report will describe 
deviations from the statistical analysis plan , if any .

the trial will require 315 death events. Assuming that the enrolment will be non- uniform over an 
18 month period (with additional follow up of 8 months) during which 3 to 29 subjects per month  
(3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, and 29)  are expected to be enrolled in the first [ADDRESS_673248] randomized (if [ADDRESS_673249] occurred), or after at least [ADDRESS_673250] 
been observed (corresponding to 86% power). Based on DMC recommendation to stop further 
enrollment, the time of primary analyses is shifted to occur after approximately [ADDRESS_673251] 6 months of the study because, during this study period, subjects are 
assessed monthly whether or not they are still on study treatment. Secondary analysis sets may 
also include additional data (eg, data collected over the entire study).

Section  4.4). An interim analysis of OS was planned to be conducted by [CONTACT_519025] [ADDRESS_673253] of the required 315 death events had 
occurred, the DMC recommended to discontinue enrollment based on futility, so no further interim analysis will be conducted. 
To achieve a mature analysis of OS and also keep the study duration within a reasonable period, 
the primary analysis was to be conducted either  after 315 death events (corresponding to a 90% 
power) have occurred  within [ADDRESS_673254] randomized (if 277 or more death events occurred by [CONTACT_221774]), or  after at 
least 277 death events (correspo nding to an 86% power) have been observed. Refer to 
Section  11.1 ; the time of primary analyses is shifted to occur after approximately [ADDRESS_673255] disposition including numbers screened, randomized, treated, treatment discontinuation

groups combined. 
11.6 Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy analyses will be presented by [CONTACT_1570] (guadecitabine vs TC) based on the 
Efficacy Analysis Set, except where it is specified otherwise. This section describes the analyses conducted at the primary analysis time point when [ADDRESS_673257] occurred, assuming that the study continued after the planned interim analysis. T he alpha levels referenced in this section are 
nominal alpha levels for judging statistical significance, taking into consideration the planned interim analysis and the hierarchical testing order of the (final) primary analysis.  The overall 
experimental al pha error is controlled at the [ADDRESS_673258] was randomized to the date of death (regardless of cause). Subjects without a documented death date will be censored on the last date known to be alive. 
Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Guadecitabine 
Clinical Protocol SGI -110-[ADDRESS_673259] stratified by [CONTACT_519027] f actors with an overall 
2-sided alpha level of 0.05. In order to control the overall type I error rate at 0.05  
(2-sided), the nominal alpha to be used in the final analysis will be calculated accounting for the 
alpha already spent  at the interim analysis.  
In addition, the hazard ratio and the 95% CI will be estimated using a Cox proportional- hazard 
model with treatment as the independent variable and stratified by [CONTACT_301499] -rank test.  
11.6.[ADDRESS_673260] recent prior BM will be used.   
Secondary efficacy endpoints are the following and will be defined in more detail in the statistical analy sis plan:  
• EFS defined as the number of days from randomization to the earliest date of disease 
progression, treatment discontinuation, start of alternative an ti-leukemia therapy  (except for 
HCT) , or death.  
• Survival rate at 1 year after randomization (subj ects will also be followed long term to estimate 
2-year survival rate).   
• NDAOH.  
• Transfusion independence  rate. 
• CR and CRh rates based on modified IWG 2003 AML Response Criteria, as described in 
Section  9.1. 
• CRc (CR+CRi+ CRp) rate , as described in Section  9.1. 
• HCT rate (in subjects who undergo HCT, time to stem cell engraftment and [ADDRESS_673261] will also be assessed ). 
• Duration of combined CR and CRh, defined as the time from first CR or CRh to time of relapse.  
• Health -related QOL by [CONTACT_28973] -5D (consisting of the EQ -5D- 5L descriptive system and the EQ 
VAS).  
If statistical significance is achieved for OS, hierarchically EFS, 1 -year survival  rate, NDAOH, 
transfusion independence  rate, combined CR+ CRh rate, CRc  rate, and HCT rate will be compared 
between the two treatment groups as addressed in Section  11.6.2. The alpha level for the secondary 
endpoints involved in statistical testing depends on results of previous hierarchical testing and on whether early  termination of the study occurs after the interim analysis.

Confidential Information  72 29 October  2018  [IP_ADDRESS] Event -free Survival (EFS)  
EFS is defined as the number of days from randomization to the earliest of disease progression, 
treatment discontinuation , start of alternative anti -leukemia therapy  (except for HCT), or death. 
Disease progression is defined as earliest occurrence of one of the following: 
• For subjects with CR, CRh, CRi, or CRp, the confirmed (at least [ADDRESS_673262] 1  week 
apart) appearance of ≥5% leukemic blasts in PB, OR ≥5% leukemic blasts in the BM.  
• For all other subjects, when PB or BM shows evidence of continued increase in blasts % that necessitates alternative therapy.  
EFS will be displayed using a Kaplan- Meier estimate and will be compared between the two 
treatment grou ps using a log- rank test stratified by [CONTACT_94487]. EFS 
time will be censored on the last date the subject is known to be alive without a n EFS event . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Survival rate at [ADDRESS_673263] date known to be alive. The stratification factors will be the same as those used in the OS analysis. The survival rate at 2 years will also be determined.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Number of Da ys Alive and Out of the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519007]. The number of days when subjects are still alive and out of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_301467] 6 months of the study will be summarized by [CONTACT_104829]  2 treatment groups using an analysis 
of variance model, which includes treatment group and all randomization stratification factors in the model.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Transfusion Independence  Rate  
Transfusion independence rate is calculated as number of subjects without RBC or platelet 
transfusion for any period of [ADDRESS_673264] stratified by [CONTACT_178204]. In addition, the Mantel- Haenszel weighted difference in transfusion 
independence rate between the 2 treatment groups and the associated CI will be provided.

Confidential Information  73 29 October  2018  [IP_ADDRESS] Complete Response and Complete Response  with Partial Hematologic Recovery  
Rate s 
The CR and CRh rates will be calculated individually and combined as the number of subjects 
with a best response of CR or CRh divided by [CONTACT_519028]. The CR, CRh, a nd combined CR+ CRh rates will be compared between the [ADDRESS_673265] stratified by [CONTACT_94487]. 
In addition, the Mantel -Haenszel weighted difference in CR, CRh, and combined CR+CRh rates 
between the 2 treatment groups and the associated CI will be provided.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Composite CR Rate  
The CRc rate is calculated as the number of subjects with a best response of CR, CRp, or CRi 
divided by [CONTACT_519029] s. The CRc rate will be 
compared between the [ADDRESS_673266] stratified by [CONTACT_519030] . In addition, the Mantel -Haenszel weighted difference in CRc rate between 
the 2 treatment groups and the associa ted CI will be provided. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematopoietic Cell Transplant  Rate  
The HCT rate will be calculated as the number of subjects who received an HCT after 
randomization divided by [CONTACT_104827]. The HCT 
rate will be compared between the [ADDRESS_673267] day of 3 consecutive days of PB ANC of >500/µL. Time- to-stem-cell engraftment will be summarized by [CONTACT_12922].  
One hundred- day post -HCT mortality rate (regardless of cause) will be calculated for subjects who 
received an HCT  after randomization , and summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Duration of Combined CR and CRh  
Duration of combined CR and CRh (in number of days) will be calculated from the first time a CR 
or CRh is observed to time of relapse (defined as the earliest time point whereby [CONTACT_519031]/disease progression due to confirmed reappearance of ≥5% 
leukemic blasts in PB or ≥5% leukemic blasts in BM). The duration of combined CR and CRh will 
be censored at the last available time point at which a relapse/disease progression was not observed. Duration of combined CR and CRh will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method 
for subjects who achieved a CR or CRh during the study. To take the proportion of responders into 
consideration when analyzing duration of combined CR and CRh, a separate analysis including all 
subjects will be conducted with a 0 day event duration assigned to subjects who did not achieve a CR or CRh .

Confidential Information  74 29 October  2018  [IP_ADDRESS] EQ-5D-5L 
The calculation for EQ -5D- 5L index value will be performed according to EuroQol group's 
EQ-5D- 5L User Guide (http://www.euroqol.org/about -eq-5d.html). The EQ -5D- 5L index value 
and VAS and their respective changes from baseline will be summarized by [CONTACT_765]. Only the data 
collected in the first 6 months of the study will be included in this analysis. In addition, the changes 
from baseline of EQ -5D-5L index value, and separately EQ VAS, wil l be analyzed using a mixed 
model approach for repeated measures.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Sequence of Statistical Tests for Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary endpoint OS will be tested first. If the test for OS is positive, hypothesis testing will proceed for the secondary endpoints in the following order: 
• EFS.  
• Survival rate at 1 year after randomization.  
• NDAOH during the first 6 months. 
• Transfusion independence  rate. 
• Combined CR +CRh rate.  
• CRc (CR+CRi+CRp) rate.  
• HCT rate.  
A positive test result of the earlier endpoint serves as a gatekeeper (Westfall and Krishen 2001)  
for analysis of the next endpoint. Other secondary efficacy endpoints (duration of CR and Health 
Related QOL) will be used as supportive evidence of the beneficial treatment effect. Dif ferences 
of treatment effect for these endpoints and associated 95% CIs, if applicable, will be constructed.

Cytogenetics- based risk classification is based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
(NCCN) Guidelines® (2014) as follows: 
Risk Status Based on Cytogeneticsa 
Risk Status  Cytogenetics  
Better -risk inv(16)b,c or t(16;16)b 
t(8;21)b 
t(15;17)  
Intermediate -risk Normal cytogenetics  
+8 alone  
t(9;11)  
Other non-defined 
Poor -risk Complex (≥3 clonal chromosomal abnormalities)  
Monosomal karyotype  
-5, 5q-, -7, 7q - 
11q23 - non t(9;11)  
inv(3), t(3;3)  
t(6;9)  
t(9;22)d 
a The molecular abnormalities included in this table reflect those for which validated assays are available in 
standardized commercial laboratories. Given the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] e volving field, risk stratification should be modified 
based on continuous evaluation of research data. Other novel genetic mutations have been identified that may 
have prognostic significance.  
b  Other cytogenetic abnormalities in addition to these findings  do not alter better risk status.

PROTOCOL TITLE: Acetaminophen  and Postpartum Blood Pressure in Preeclampsia  
 Page 4 of 32 Version Date : May 18, [ADDRESS_892064] -partum pain will : 
- have  a shorter  duration of severe range hypertension  postpartum  
- be less likely to require antihypertensive use  
- have  similar  length of postpartum hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
1.2. To compare postpartum pain control  among women diagnosed with severe preeclampsia who are 
randomized to the ibuprofen arm as compared to women randomized to the acetaminophen arm.  
1.2.1.  We hypothesize that women randomized t o the ibuprofen arm will have lower mean pain 
scores  than those randomized to the acetaminophen arm.  
 
2. Background  
2.1. Hypertensive disorders are significant contributors to maternal morbidity and mortality , and 
many women diagnosed with a hypertensive disorder  of pregnancy , or preeclampsia,  require  
prolonged postpartum observation or intervention for per sistent hypertension .1,2 In addition, 
women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are at increased risk for cesarean delivery  with 
its attendant need for postoperative pain relief .  Chronic use of non -steroidal anti -inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) , particularly cyclo -oxygenase (COX) inhibitors,  is known to increase the risk of 
development of hypertension in healthy, non -pregnant women as well  as antagonize the effects of 
some antihypertensive drugs in hypertensive patients receiving  treatment .3–[ADDRESS_892065] been proposed, including the inhibition of prostaglandin E2 -mediated 
sodium excretion, in hibition of prostacyclin -mediated vasodilation, and altered aldosterone 
metabolism.11,12 The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) suggests avoiding 
the postpartum use of NSAIDs in women diagnosed with preeclampsia, though this 
recommendation is not formally included in its most recent guidelines, likely due to the paucity 
of published data on preeclampsia and NSAID use2. Animal studies are limited to a single 
investigation in a rat model of preeclampsia and showed that indomethacin had no effect on blood 
pressure while rats we re still pregnant .13 In humans, the extremely limited data on the influ ence 
of COX inhibitors  on postpartum blood pressure among women with preeclampsia is 
conflicting.14–[ADDRESS_892066] of 
COX inhibitors  on postpartum blood pressure control in patients with preeclampsia.  
 
COX inhibitor s are ideally suited for postpartu m pain control ; before  issuance of the most recent 
guidelines, they were wi dely used for postpartum and post -cesarean section pain management  
particularly in bridging from opi[INVESTIGATOR_661364] -opi[INVESTIGATOR_661365] .17,[ADDRESS_892067] also been shown to 
decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_661366] .15,17 –21 Given New Mexico’s high rate of opi[INVESTIGATOR_661367] -related deaths, any therapeutic option which may decrease the requir ement 
for opi[INVESTIGATOR_661368].  Additionally, the analgesic alternatives to COX inhibitor s have 
significant risks. The use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_661369] (CNS) depression, and acetaminophen use is c ontraindicated in the setting of 
severe, acute elevation of liver enzymes, a common occurrence among patients with 
preecl ampsia22. Whether the theoretical effect of short -term COX inhibitor use on postpartum 
blood pressure  is clinically significant remains u nclear. Systolic blood pressure  has been shown 
to increase b y  up to  10mm Hg among both healthy and hypertensive  COX inhibitor  users , with 
changes in blood pressure appearing with just a few doses per month .23–25 Another study in men 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Acetaminophen  and Postpartum Blood Pressure in Preeclampsia  
 Page 5 of 32 Version Date : May 18, 2015  found that systemic vascular resistance increased by [CONTACT_8622] 20% immediately following 
intravenous administration of indomethacin. [ADDRESS_892068] blood pressure in the 
setting of preeclampsia. Thus, o ur study is necessary to determine whether  avoiding  postpartum  
COX inhibitor use is associated with improved outcomes for women diagnosed with 
preeclampsia.  
 
3. Study Design  
3.1. The proposed study is a ran domized, controlled double masked trial comparing the effects of  
acetaminophen versus  ibuprofen  for mild postpartum pain  among women with preeclampsia . 
3.2. Study  participants, study  person nel and providers will be  blinded to randomization status of study 
participants. Blinding will occur through the double ma sked design . The  ibuprofen and 
acetaminophen will be made to appear id entical to each other and will be unmarked  through 
compounding and encapsulation . After delivery, s tudy participants will be randomized  by [CONTACT_661384] , and allocation  will only 
be known by [CONTACT_36971]. Block randomization will be used to ensure equal 
allocation to the two study arms.  
4. Inclusion  and Exclusion Criteria  
4.1. All patients admitted to the labor and delivery unit with a diagnosis of a severe hyper tensive 
disorder (preeclampsia with severe features, chronic hypertension with superimposed 
preeclampsia with severe features, hemolysis, elevated liver function tests and low platelets 
(HELLP) syndrome, or eclampsia) will be assessed for eligibility.  
4.2. Inclusion criteria include age at least 18, ability to give informed consent, pregnant or recently 
pregnant (< 6 hours postpartum) with a diagnosis of severe  hypertensive disorder of pregnancy  
(as defined in 4.1).  We will also approach women diagnosed with pr eeclampsia without severe 
features who are being expectantly managed, anticipating that they may eventually develop 
severe features and be eligible for the study.  
4.3. Exclusion criteria include current incarceration, serum creatinine > 1.0mg/dL or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_661370], aspartate aminot ransferase (AST) > 200  unit/L , alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) > 200  unit/L , known allergy or sensitivity to NSAIDs or acetaminophen, delivery > 6 
hours prior to enrollment, chronic kidney di sease, chronic liver diseas e, prior liver transplant, 
chronic infectious hepatitis, gastritis , gastro -esophageal reflux disease (GERD) , peptic ulcer 
disease, or bleeding disorder . Additionally, a patient may be excluded from participation if their 
provider feels that participation is not in the best interest of the patient.  
4.4. This study will enroll women at the time of their diagnosis of preeclampsia, at which time they 
will most lik ely still be pregnant. Randomization and study intervention will not occur until they 
are postpartum.  Our study will not include minors, prisoners, or adults who are unable to give 
informed consent.  
4.5. The population of interest for this study is post -partum women with preeclampsia, which 
excludes men, as they do not become pregnant and do not suffer from preeclampsia.  
5. Number of Subjects  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Acetaminophen  and Postpartum Blood Pressure in Preeclampsia  
 Page 6 of 32 Version Date : May 18, 2015  5.1. Total number of subjects to be accrued is 100.  
5.2. Given that we plan to consent patients diagnosed with preeclampsia without s evere features in 
anticipation of a possible future diagnosis of preeclampsia with severe features, we plan to 
consent a total of 150 potential subjects.  
5.3. Sample size justification : Based on preliminary data obtained from n=31 patients  (as part of 
HRRC Study ID 16 -073), the duration of severe -range hyp ertension was found to follow an 
exponential distribution with mean  lifetime  = 35 hours (var = 1217 hr2). We performed a sample 
size estimate based o n this data to detect a [ADDRESS_892069] a duration of sever e-range hypertension = [ADDRESS_892070] 
duration = [ADDRESS_892071], 
we require a sample size of n=[ADDRESS_892072] a mean lifetime difference of 24 
hours between groups with 83% power at a significance level α = 0.05.  
 
6. Study Timelines  
6.1. Describe:  
 The dur ation of an individual subject’s participation in the research  will be from the time she 
is consented (while admitted to the labor and delivery or OB Special Care units) until her 
discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_661371]. This may be only a few days if she is enrolled 
just prior to or following delivery, but may last as long as several weeks if she is enrolled 
during a long course of inpatient expectant management prior to delivery.  
 We anticipate to enroll all study participants over the course of approximately 24 months.  
 We expect the study to conclude and analysis to be complete within 6 months of completing 
enrollment.  
7. Study Endpoints  
7.1. The primary  endpoint will be duration  of severe range hypertension (systolic  blood pressure ≥ 
160mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure  ≥ 110mm Hg) after delivery, measured in hours. Secondary 
outcomes will include:  
- Length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
- Mean arterial pressure  over the entire postpartum hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298]  
- Mean arterial pressure, stratified by [CONTACT_544150] 1, 2, 3, etc.  
- Mean n umber of severe range blood pressures  
- Proportion with severe -range hypertension in each group  
- Maximum blood pressure  for entire postpartum hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (in mm Hg)  
- The proportion of study participants requiring the use of any  scheduled oral 
antihypertensives  at discharge  
- Number of scheduled oral antihypertensive agents  required at discharge  
- Number of doses of antihypertensives (either oral or intravenous) given for acute  
lowering of blood pressure  
- The proportion of study participants requiring the use of intravenous  antihypertensives

1000mL . 
7.3. There are no exploratory endpoints.  
8. Research Setting  
8.1. Research will take place at University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center.  
8.2. Potential study participants will be identified and approached for participation while admitted to 
either the labor and delivery unit or the OB Special Care (antepartum) unit.  
8.3. Locations of research “procedures” are as follows:

– data analysis: UNM HSC CTSC  
8.4. A community advisory board  will not be necessary for this study.  
8.5. No research is planned outside of UNM HSC.  
9. Resources Available  
9.1. The PI, [CONTACT_661413] , has completed residency training in obstetrics and gynecology as well 
as a fellowship in Maternal -Fetal Medicine. He is board -certified in both general OB/GYN and 
Maternal -Fetal Medicine. He has many years ’ clinical experience , and as an A ssociate Professor 
of clinical education, he has the resources necessary to oversee and complete the project. [CONTACT_661414], who oversaw the majority of the study design and continues as a co -
investigator, has many years’ experience directing clini cal research, including acting as PI [INVESTIGATOR_8178]  a 
multi -center randomized controlled trial of oral misoprostol versus oxytocin for induction of 
labor among women with pre -labor rupture of members at term as well as a randomized 
controlled trial that compared EPA - and DHA -rich fish oil with soy oil placebo for prevention of 
perinatal depression among women at risk.  
9.2. We will be collaborating with the UNM CTSC for statistical support for the study. Our CTSC 
statistician is Cristina Murray -Crezan.  
9.3. The following license d providers will be primarily responsible for oversight of the medical 
services to which patients will be admitted:  
- Ellen Mozurkewich, MD , MS  
- Luis Izquierdo, MD , MBA  
- Conrad Chou, MD  
- Larry Leeman, MD, MPH  
- Sarah Gopman, MD  
- Nicole Yonke, MD, MPH  
- Mary Beth Sutter, MD  
9.4. Describe other resources available to conduct the research:

PROTOCOL TITLE: Acetaminophen  and Postpartum Blood Pressure in Preeclampsia  
 Page 8 of 32 Version Date : May 18, 2015   One of the co -investigators, Nathan Blue, is a fellow in Maternal -Fetal Medicine at UNM and 
has one full year of dedicated research time over the course of his fellowship (2015 -2018), 
during which the majority of the research work will be completed.   
 No special fac ilities will be required to conduct the research.  
 Given that participation in the study involves taking one of two commonly used med icines for 
mild postpartum pain, either of which m ay be prescribed to patients not participating in the 
study, we do not anticipate the need for additional medical or psychological resources as a 
result of participating in the study.  
 Prior to involvement in the study, a ll persons assisting with the resear ch will be oriented by a 
co-investigator, at which point they will review the protocol, consent process, and their 
specific duties in detail.  
10. Prior Approvals  
10.1. Describe any approvals that will be obtained prio r to commencing the research. (e .g., school,

describe how sponso r responsibilities will be fulfilled, including, but not limited to:  N/A – this 
study is not an FDA -regulated trial  
12. Study Procedures  
12.1. Study participants randomized to the ibuprofen arm will receive oral ibuprofen 600 milligrams 
(mg) every 6 hours starting immediately postpartum and continuing until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. 
Participants randomized to the acetaminophen arm will receive oral acetaminophen 650mg 
every 6 hours starting immediately postpartum and continuing until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. The 
purpose of the  scheduled dosing of either ibuprofen or acetaminophen is to treat mild pain (level 
1-3 on Wong -Baker scale). Around -the-clock, scheduled dosing of either ibuprofen or 
acetaminophen for mild pain is the current practice at UNM . Pain will be assessed  and re corded 
in Cerner PowerChart  as per the standard protocol for the OB Special care and Mother -Baby 
[CONTACT_661391] -Baker scale.  If study participants report a pain 
level of 1 -3, no additional medication will be given. If they report a pain level of 4 -6, 
oxycodone 5mg will be given as often as every 4 hours , as needed. For a pain level of 7 -10, 
oxycodone 10mg will be given as often  as every 4 hours,  as needed . 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Acetaminophen  and Postpartum Blood Pressure in Preeclampsia  
 Page 9 of 32 Version Date : May 18, 2015   The two agents being compared, ibuprofen and acetaminophen, are both marketed on -label  
for the treatment of pain . 
 Monitoring: During the first [ADDRESS_892074] management for preeclampsia 
with severe features. Again , as routine practice for treatment of preeclampsia at our 
institution, vital signs are measured hourly. Once off of magnesium sulfate, vital signs will be 
monitored every 4 hours until discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Serum studies are routinely sent 
daily  as part of normal clinical practice to assess for sequelae of preeclampsia until any 
abnormalities resolve and blood pressures are at goal  (< 160 mmHg systolic  and 110 mmHg  
diastolic ), though they may be checked more often if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_661392] s. 
They include complete blood count, lactate dehydrogenase, uric acid, prothrombin time, 
partial thromboplastin time, serum creatinine (Cr), aspartate amino transferase (AST), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), and total bilirubin. As is our current practice, patients remain 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192608] 72 hours postpartum and until th ey are free of “severe range” blood 
pressure (systolic ≥ 160mm Hg, diastolic  ≥ 110mmg Hg) for at least [ADDRESS_892075] of care for women with severe range blood pressures 
and preeclampsia.  
 Use of antihypertensives: if a study participant had been started or maintained on oral 
labetalol or nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_661372], it will be continued postpartum at the same dose, as is 
our current practice. If not on any oral antihypertensives, study participants will be sta rted on 
either labetalol or extend ed-release nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], according to their p rovider’s discreti on, if they 
have more than one blood pressure  of 150 mmHg systolic or 100 mmHg diastolic, 4 -6 hours 
apart, as recommended by [CONTACT_661393] (ACOG 2013).2 Antihypertensives will be 
titrated accordin g to the provider’ s discretion to achieve a goal blood pressure  of less than 
160mmHg systolic and 110mmHg diastolic. We chose to use these drugs for postpartum 
hypertension as they are first line for hypertension during pregnancy, and thus are the most 
likely agents which enrolled participants will already be on, and they are the first line 
treatment for postpartum hypertension at  our institution due to their relative safety while 
breastfeeding.   
 Demographic data will be collected from study participa nts at the time of enr ollment. 
Outcomes d ata to be analyzed will be collected from the patient’s electronic medical  record  in 
PowerChart.  
 All procedur es which are part of the study ( including the use of either acetaminophen or 
ibuprofen for mild postpartum pain  and serial laboratory studies) would be done  if the patients 
were not enrolled in the study, because they are the  current  standard of care at UNM.  
 The following will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_661373]:  
1.1..1.  No blood pressures >  160/[ADDRESS_892076] 72 hours of inpatient observation after delivery  
1.1..3.  Serum creatinine that is at the patient’s baseline, or trending toward normal  
1.1..4.  Serum AST < 250 and ALT < [ADDRESS_892077] normal  
1.1..5.  All other postpartum or postoperative discharge criteria (tolerating regular diet,  
ambulating, voiding, etc.) met per the discretion of the provider  
13. Data Analysis  
13.1. Summary statistics will be calculated to describe the patient characteristics. Means and standard 
devia tions or medians and quartiles will be reported for continuous data, as appropriate 
(exponential means for times to events or durations of events); frequencies and percentages will 
be reported for categorical data. For all analyses, the intention -to-treat population will be used. 
For the primary analysis, the exponential mean lifetimes (means) and variance will be calculated 
for each group and will be compared via the F test for the ratio of the lifetimes. We will report 
95% confidence intervals for the tim es and the p -value for the test will be compared to a type I 
error rate of 0.05. All of the secondary outcome measures will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics as reported above and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for each endpoint by 
[CONTACT_19313]. Graphical tools may be used for visual comparison of the group effect. Exploratory 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Acetaminophen  and Postpartum Blood Pressure in Preeclampsia  
 Page 10 of 32 Version Date : May 18, [ADDRESS_892078] (DSMB) will perform safety monitoring. It will be comprised 
of physicians with a background in obstetrics and gynecology but who will not be enrolling 
patients or supervising the care of potential study participants. The members of the board are 
affiliated with UNM and the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and include:  
- Valerie Rappa pport, MD  
- Yuko Komesu , MD  
- Sharon Phelan, MD  
Due to the relatively small number of subjects, there will not be interim analysis. The DSMB 
will convene in the event of one of the follow ing sentinel events  occurs to determine whether 
the event was attributable to the patient’s random ized intervention:  
- stroke  
- seizure / eclampsia  
- posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome  
- death  
14.2. If a sentinel event occurs, it will be reported to the DSMB within 24 hours, and the DSMB will 
convene within another 48 hours to review the case in detail and  determine whether the event is 
attributable to the patient’s study participation.  The DSMB will then render advice  regarding 
trial continuation  on a case -by-case basis . 
14.3. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) will be available for both ibuprofen and acetaminophen, in 
addition to the most recently published guidelines for management of hypertensive disorders of 
pregnancy for review by [CONTACT_4318].  
14.4. If the DSMB determines that the sentinel event is attributable to study participation  and that 
further enroll ment  poses undo risk to potential participants , the DSMB will have the power to 
halt the study.  
14.5. When  the DSMB convenes following a sentinel event, the conclusion of the board and its 
recommendation to continue or discontinue the study will be distributed to the investigators, the 
sponsor and HRRC in writing  within 48 hours of the DSMB convening.  
15. Withdraw al of Subjects  
15.1. Study  participants will be withdrawn  from treatment allocation and patient and provider 
mask ing (but not data collection) who experience the following after enrollment: new onset 
seizure activity; stroke; focal neurologic findings necessitat ing neuroimaging; patient request; 
serum Cr > 1. 1 mg/dL; new onset elevation in  AST > 250 mg/dL or ALT  >250 mg/dL . 
15.1.1.  Outlined here is our systematic tracking plan to ensure timely recognition of withdrawal 
criteria and withdrawal from the study.  When a patie nt is recruited for study participation, 
the on -call team will be notified of her study participation status, and the following 
information will be added to the electronic sign -out and census: the patient’s study 
participation status, the withdrawal criter ia, and the designated Research Phone number.  
15.1.2.  At the time of delivery, the on -call team refers to the Postpartum Orders Checklist when 
writing postpartum orders. The orders will include daily lab studies, including serum 
creatinine and LFTs, to be drawn the following morning at the latest, and earlier  if clinically 
indicated. The Postpartum Orders Checklist will also include information to be placed in the 
electronic sign -out and census, as described in 15.1.1.  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Acetaminophen  and Postpartum Blood Pressure in Preeclampsia  
 Page 11 of 32 Version Date : May 18, 2015  15.1.3.  The next morning (postpartum day #1), [CONTACT_661415]  (or [CONTACT_661416] or [CONTACT_125975], in [CONTACT_661417] ’s absence)  will review the labs with the on -call attending, and will complete a 
checklist documenting the review of lab studies, as outlined above in section 3.2.5 (see 
appendix [ADDRESS_892079]). On weekends and holidays, this will be don e by 
[CONTACT_661394] (either [CONTACT_661415], Katukuri, or Holbrook), and reviewed 
with the attending. The on -call attending will decide whether further lab studies are 
indicated the following day. This review and documentation will be completed  daily for the 
duration of study participation (until discharge).  
15.1.4.  If, at the time of daily lab review, the patient meets criteria for withdrawal, the Daily Lab 
Review Checklist will direct the reviewing fellow and attending to the Study W ithdrawal 
Checkli st, which outlines and documents the steps needed  to withdraw the study subject.   
15.2. As there is no risk related to immediate withdrawal from the study, a patient may be 
immediately withdrawn without special procedures given that all procedures which are part  of 
the study would continue (with exception of mask ing to medication use) because these are the 
routine medications given for postpartum pain at UNM.  
15.3. If a study participant requests withdrawal due to reluctance to continue with the randomization 
allocati on or mask ing procedure but still allows for her data to be collected and analyzed, she 
will then no longer receive the blinding procedure , but will contin ue to receive ibuprofen or 
acetaminophen  for mild postpartum pain, at her provider’s discretion  and if the patient is 
amenable .  
16. Data Management /Confidentiality  
16.1. IRB-approved co -investigators will review the study participant’ s electronic medical records on 
a daily basis during study participation, and will complete data collection as soon as  
partici pation in the study is complete in order to collect outcomes data.  Demographics data will 
be collected at enrollment or prior to completion of study participation.  When accessing 
patients’ charts, research team members will open the chart under the “resear cher” designation 
when accessing the chart for this purpose.  
16.2. The data collection does require the maintenance of patient identifiers (name, date of birth, 
medical record number) in order to access the electronic chart to collect the data.  
16.3. The data collecti on does require the accessing and storage of Protected Health Information, 
including medical comorbidities, elements of medical history, as well as empi[INVESTIGATOR_661374].  
16.4.  The data collection will included substance abuse information, and thus may be considered 
sensitive.   
16.5. A Certificate of Confidentiality will not be used to protect data from forced release (e.g., 
subpoena) and will be applied for once IRB approval is in place.   
16.6. Patient identifiers and collected data will  eventually  be separated.  At the time of enrollment, the 
data collection sheet with patient ide ntifiers will be stored in a locked cabinet until the data are 
collected. No patient identifiers will  be on the data collection sheets, and the  data will be labeled 
with a case number. In case of need for further review, a file will be maintained linking p atient 
identifiers to the case number. This file will be held in a password -protected, encrypted, and 
UNM HSC owned computer under the personal control of one of the coinvestigators.  The 
patient identifier file will not be kept on the same computer which w ill maintain the collected 
data. Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_661375].  
16.7. Data collected will be stored in both paper and electronic formats in order to provide backup 
should the electronic form b e corrupted or destroyed.  
16.8. If data will be transferred or transmitted to outside locations or entities, describe : N/A – all data 
collection and analysis will take place at UNM.  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Acetaminophen  and Postpartum Blood Pressure in Preeclampsia  
 Page 12 of 32 Version Date : May 18, 2015  16.9. The de -identified/coded data will be transmitted via email only after being encrypted , but not 
stored on the internet. The coding file, which will be maintained on a separate computer, will 
not be transmitted via email or the internet. It will remain on the computer to which it is 
assigned.  
16.10.  Data will  not be collected by [CONTACT_661395] v ideo recording.  
16.11.  Data will  not include photographs .  
17. Data and Specimen Banking  
17.1. De-identified study data will be stored for 5 years after study completion, and then destroyed.  ] 
17.2. No data or specimens will be banked or archived elsewhere .  
18. Risks to Subjects  
18.1. COX inhibitor s are known to contribute to acute kidney injury. Even though suspi[INVESTIGATOR_661376], a patient may have sub -clinical or evolving acute 
kidney injury at the time of enrollment, which may become appar ent only after randomization. 
The same possibility exists for randomization to the acetaminophen arm and the possibility of 
evolving subclinical liver injury not identified until after randomization.  Should acute kidney or 
liver injury occur, it will be id entified on the serial laboratory studies which are part of the study 
procedure, the providers will be unmasked  to the patient’s  allocation  (per criteria for 
withdrawal, as described above) , and therefor able to withdraw the study medication if needed.  
Acute kidney injury and acute liver injury are both virtually always temporary in association 
with preeclampsia , and can both occur in the absence of the use of COX inhibitors . The risk of 
one of these occurrences is unlikely to be increased by [CONTACT_661396] (or sometimes both) for 
mild postpartum pain in the setting of preeclampsia . Risks could include worse control of 
hypertension if assigned to the COX inhibitor  arm, but this is theoretical in this population and 
this question is the purpose of the experiment.  COX inhibitor  use is also known to exacerbate or 
contribute to GERD.  
There is also a risk of accidental breach of confidentiality by [CONTACT_661397]  
18.2. There is a possibility  unforesee n risks /adverse events to patients as a result of participation in 
this study.  
18.3. The only part of the process which will take place during pregnancy is the consent  and 
collection of demographics information . Once she has delivered, she will be randomized and the 
remaining study procedures will begin.  
18.4. There are no risks to others who are not subjects  
18.5. Describe the steps being taken to minimize the probability o r magnitude of risks.  
- Risk of acute kidney injury in those randomized to ibuprofen: only subjects with 
normal renal function will be enrolled. Daily serum BUN and creatinine will be 
collected (in addition to other preeclampsia labs) and study participants will be 
withdrawn and providers un -mask ed to their randomization status if evidence of acute 
kidney injury develops.  
- Risk of GERD in those randomized to ibuprofen: only subjects without gastritis will be 
enrolled.  
- Risk of acute liver injury in thos e randomized to acetaminophen: o nly subjects with 
normal liver function will be enrolled. Daily serum AST and ALT will be collected (in 
addition to other preeclampsia labs) and study participants will be withdrawn and 
providers un -blinded to their randomizat ion status if evidence of acute liver injury 
develops.  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Acetaminophen  and Postpartum Blood Pressure in Preeclampsia  
 Page 13 of 32 Version Date : May 18, 2015  19. Potential Benefits to Subjects  
19.1. Describe the potential benefits that individual subjects may experience from taking part in the 
research. Include as may be useful for the IRB’s consideration, the probab ility, magnitude, and 
duration of the potential benefits.  
- If randomized to the ibuprofen arm, study participants may have better pain control. If 
randomized to the acetaminophen arm, study participants may have better  blood 
pressure control. Again, this is  the principle question of the study. Otherwise, there is 
no direct benefit to study participants.  
20. Recruitment Methods  
20.1. Potential study participants will be identified by [CONTACT_661398].  Charts may  also be reviewed by [CONTACT_661399].  They will be approached by [CONTACT_661400], either during a period of initial observation following the diagnosis, during 
labor, or within the first [ADDRESS_892080] the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
21.1. The only settings in which potential study participants will be approached for participa tion are 
private: either their labor and delivery room, their private room while undergoing expectant 
management on the antepartum service , or in an outpatient clinic exam room . Additionally, all 
research procedures will occur in the privacy of a participa nt’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39223].  
21.2. Encounters with patients during study recruitment, consent and participation all will occur in a 
private setting of a patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_661377]. Documentation 
of consent will be stored initially in the provider workroom on the labor and delivery unit and 
will be collected at periodically, usually every 2 -3 days, for storage in a locked cabinet 
accessible only to study  personnel.  Issues related to data are addressed in the Data 
Management/Confidentiality Section.  
22. Economic Burden to Subjects  
22.1. Study participants will not be responsible for any additional cost because of participation in the 
study.  
22.2. The patients’ insurers will be responsible for paying for adverse events. If the patient is 
uninsured, or “self -pay”, then the study participants will be financially responsible. Because the 
medications being studied are both already the standard of care for mild postpartum pain , an 
adverse even likely would have occurred whether or not a patient is a participant of the study.  
23. Compensation  
23.1. Upon completion of the study (at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]) research participants will be 
compensated with a $[ADDRESS_892081] to a local retailer, such as Target™ . This dollar amount was 
chosen because it is enough to serve as an incentive to complete the trial, but is not so large as 
to compel potential participants who are economically disadvantaged to participate due to 
financial need.  
24. Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Acetaminophen  and Postpartum Blood Pressure in Preeclampsia  
 Page 14 of 32 Version Date : May 18, [ADDRESS_892082].  
25. Consent Proc ess 
25.1. Prior to study participation, consent will be obtained from each participant.  
25.1.1.  Coinvestigator s or study personnel will be responsible for obtaining consent. Their 
minimum qualifications include completion of the following online training modules:  
- Colla borative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) Program: Biomedical Responsible 
Conduct of Research  
- CITI Program: Human Research  
- UNM Conflict of Interest training  
25.1.2.  The consent process will take place in the patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_661378] . Other patients, or persons unknown to the patient will not be present for the 
consent process.  
25.1.3.  In order to minimize coercion or undue influence, potential study participants will be 
given the option of reviewing study contents alone  or with the provider o r study 
personnel.  
25.1.4.  After being approached, potential study participants will have the option for a waiting 
period of at least [ADDRESS_892083] a poor understanding of English 
language communication, oral consent will either be obtained in Spanish by [CONTACT_661401], or through the use of interpreters. Spanish 
language translations of consent documents will also be used and provided to the patients 
for review.  
25.1.9.  Patients not understanding either English or Spanish will not be recruited for 
participation, thus short -form consent documents will not be used.  
 
Cognitively Impaired Adults/Adults Unable to Consent/Use of a Legally 
Authorized Representative  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Acetaminophen  and Postpartum Blood Pressure in Preeclampsia  
 Page 15 of 32 Version Date : May 18, 2015  25.1.10.  Patients with limited decisional capacity (either due to long-term cognitive impairment or 
short -term medical etiology) will not be approached for study partici pation.  
25.1.11.  Potential study participants will only be approached for participation in the study if the 
assessment of the providers administering their care is that their decisional capacity is 
intact. Documentation of a potential study participant’s decisional  capacity will be 
included on the consent form.  
25.1.12.  Prior to approaching a potential study participant for recruitment, study personnel will 
review with the patient’s providers whether she has demonstrated intact decisional 
capacity during her hospi[INVESTIGATOR_661379]. If not, the potential participant will not be 
approached for recruitment. If the patient has demonstrated intact decisional capacity and 
meets other inclusion criteria, she will be approached. The study personnel reviewing the 
consent with the p otential participant will assess her decisional capacity by [CONTACT_661402] (as noted in section 25.1.6 above), but 
also the potential risk and benefit of each randomization arm (randomization to 
acetaminoph en may have risk of worse pain control, whereas randomization to ibuprofen 
may have risk of higher blood pressure). If the potential participant is unable to articulate 
this, then she will not be enrolled for participation.  Intact decisional capacity will be 
documented with a checkbox on the consent form.  
25.1.13.  Decisional capacity will be evaluated on a daily basis by [CONTACT_661403]. If a participant’s decisional capacity becomes affected and she is unable to 
provide ongoing consent, she  will be withdrawn from the study.  Given the short duration 
of the study, participants regaining decisional capacity will not be re -consented for 
continued participation.  
25.1.14.  Potential participants unable or unauthorized to give their own consent (as determine d 
either by [CONTACT_661404]) will not be enrolled in the study.  
25.1.15.  Given that only potential participants who are able to provider their own consent will be 
enrolled, obtaining assent is not applicable.  
Subjects  who are not yet adults (infa nts, children, teenagers) : All study 
subjects will be a minimum age of 18.  
Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process (consent will not be obtained, 
required element of consent will not be included, or one or more required 
elements of consent will be altered) : N/A  
26.  Documentation of Consent  
26.1. Full written informed consent will be documented on all participants.  
26.2. Consent will be obtained verbally with the use of  both a script  and an information sheet . An 
information sheet summarizing the salient points of the consent will be provided for use by t he 
consenting provider or study personnel and for review by [CONTACT_133039].  
27. Study Test Results/Incidental Findings  
27.1. Individual Results:  Individual test  results obtained as part of the study protocol (i.e . daily 
preeclampsia labs) will be shared with the study participant by [CONTACT_661405] (as would normally be the routine).  
27.2. Incidental Findings:  No experimental tests will be used as part of the study proto col. All tests 
that will be performed as part of the study protocol are relevant to the care of the study 
participant and would be performed anyway  as part of her care and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_661406]. Thus, any incidental findings will be communicated to the study 
participant by [CONTACT_661407](s).   
PROTOCOL TITLE: Acetaminophen  and Postpartum Blood Pressure in Preeclampsia  
 Page 16 of 32 Version Date : May 18, [ADDRESS_892084].  
28.2. We do not  intend to provide subjects with a summary of the study results after the study is 
complete.   
29. Inclusion of Vulnerable Populations  
29.1. The study will not exclude economically disadvan taged persons from participation, as there is 
no anticipated economic burden associa ted with participation. As the compensation for 
participation  is of small value , they are not vulnerable to economic coercion.  
29.2. The study will not exclude educationally disa dvantaged persons from participation. If a 
potential participant’s educational disadvantage is significant enough that they are unable to 
understand and articulate back the general nature of the study and the risks associated with 
randomization to each arm , they will not be enrolled in the study.  
29.3. All study participants will be recently pregnant.    
30. Community -Based Participatory Research   
30.1. N/A 
31. Research Involving American Indian/Native Populations  
31.1. American Indian/Native populations  are not the focus of this study, so no additional tribal 
approval or review will be pursued. Potential study participants of American Indian or Native 
background who are eligible for the study will be approached for participation in the same 
manner as all  non-Native potential participants.  
32. Transnational Research  
32.1. N/A 
33. Drugs or Devices  
33.1. The ibuprofen and acetaminophen administered as part of the study protocol will be stored and 
distributed by [CONTACT_53775] p harmacy and administered by [CONTACT_661408].  
Both medications are already FDA approved for use to control pain, thus an IND is not 
necessary . 
33.2. Update to study drug preparation process: at the time the study was initiated  the investigational 
pharmacy  was unable to source both acetaminophen  and ibuprofen in powdered form. As an 
alternative and to ensure uniformity between the two types of capsules, commercially prepared 
tablets were obtained for use in preparing blinded capsules. These tablets were broken into 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_661380]  a size “00” capsule shell in the required quantity.  Subjects 
numbered 1 through 50 were enrolled in the study between September 29, 2016 and March 10, 
2017. In late February 2017, IDS was able to procure both acetaminophen and ibuprofen in 
powdered form . For the second half of the study, IDS proposes switching from the use of tablet 
fragments to an equivalent dosage of a powdered formulation when preparing blinded capsules. 
The reformulated capsules will be smaller and less odorous, resulting in a formulat ion more 
agreeable to study subjects receiving the medication.  The amount of active ingredient in each 
capsule will remain the same with a calculated minimum amount of inert filler (microcrystalline 
cellulose) added to ensure uniform distribution of active  ingredients among capsules.

can review private information to identify potential subjects and/or determine 
eligibility prior to approaching potential subjects for consent or parental permission.  
1. Describe the  data source that you need to review (e.g., medical records):  
Labor and Delivery workroom monitor and electronic medical records.  
2. Describe the purpose for the review (e.g., screening):  
Screening for eligibility.  
3. Describe w ho will conducting the reviews (e.g.,  investigators, research staff):

 No. Explain:       
5. Verify that  each of t he following are true  or provide an alternate justification  
for the underlined regulatory criteria : 
a) The activity involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects  
because the  records review itself is non -invasive and the results of the 
records review will not be used for any purposes other than those 
described above.  
 True  
 Other justification:       
b) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and 
welfare of the subjects  because eligible subjects will be approached for 
consent to participate in the research and are free to decline.  Further, 
the information accessed during the records review will not be 
disclosed to anyone without a legitimate purpose (e.g., verification of 
eligibility).  
 True

research  in lieu of a traditional c onsent form?  
 Yes. Please attach a copy to your submission in Click.  
 No 
C. Alteration of Consent  
Complete this checklist if you intend to obtain consent but will be eliminating or 
altering one or more of the required elements of consent. Alterations of consent are 
commonly requested for research involving deception or for minimal risk research 
when an  abbreviated consent is desired and one or more of the required element are 
not relevant to the research.  
Note: FDA -regulated research is not eligible for an alteration of consent.

Provide justificati on for each of the following:  
1. Where scientifically appropriate, preclinical studies, including studies on 
pregnant animals, and clinical studies, including studies on non -pregnant 
women, have been conducted and provide data for assessing potential risks to  
pregnant women and fetuses.  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Acetaminophen  and Postpartum Blood Pressure in Preeclampsia  
 Page 25 of 32 Version Date : May 18, [ADDRESS_892090] been carried out on non -pregnant (mostly non -
reproductive age) humans , and at least one study in pregnant rats  assessing the 
effect of NSAIDs on blood pressure , with varying results . Our goal is not to 
assess the effect of NSAIDs on blood pressure during pregnancy but rather in 
the postpartum period. Thus, patients will no longer be pregnant while 
participating in the study protocol. They will, however, be consented while 
pregnant.  
2. The risk to the fetus is caused solely by [CONTACT_86688]; or, if there is no 
such prospect of benefit, the risk to the fetus is not greater than minimal and 
the purpose of  the research is the development of important biomedical 
knowledge which cannot be obtained by [CONTACT_162304].  
Given that randomization and the study interventions occur after delivery, 
there is no risk to the fetus.  Additionally, both study medications a re first line 
agents for postpartum pain control in the setting of breastfeeding and are 
considered safe for mothers and neonates who are breastfeeding.  
3. Any risk is the least possible for achieving the objectives of the research . 
The interventions in each  randomization arm are both first line treatments for 
mild postpartum pain and are used ubiquitously in postpartum patients, 
including those with preeclampsia. Besides being randomized to either 
ibuprofen or acetaminophen, all study procedures effectively mirror the 
standard of care that would be delivered even if patients were not participating 
in the study. Additionally, because study participation only occurs while 
admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], participants undergo very close observation and 
monitoring in th e form of lab tests, symptom checks and vital signs 
measurements  as part of routine care .  
D. Neonates of Uncertain Viability  or Nonviable Neonates  
Complete this checklist if the subject population will include neonates of uncertain 
viability.  
Provide justifi cation for each of the following:  
1. Where scientifically appropriate, preclinical and clinical studies have been 
conducted and provide data for assessing potential risks to neonates.  
      
2. Each individual pro viding consent is fully informed regarding the reasonably 
foreseeable impact of the research on the neonate.  
      
3. Individuals engaged in the research will have no part in determining the 
viability of a neonate.  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Acetaminophen  and Postpartum Blood Pressure in Preeclampsia  
 Page 26 of 32 Version Date : May 18, [ADDRESS_892091] population will include nonviable neonates.  
Provide justificat ion for each of the following:  
1. Where scientifically appropriate, preclinical and clinical studies have been 
conducted and provide data for assessing potential risks to neonates.  
      
2. Each individual pro viding consent is fully informed regarding the reasonably 
foreseeable impact of the research on the neonate.  
      
3. Individuals engaged in the research will have no part in determining the 
viability of a neonate.  
      
4. The purpose of the r esearch is the development of important biomedical 
knowledge that cannot be obtained by [CONTACT_11174] . 
       
Verify each of the following:  
5. Vital functions of the neonate will not be artificially maintained  
 True  
 False  
6. The research will not terminate the heartbeat or respi[INVESTIGATOR_162260]

PROTOCOL TITLE: Acetaminophen  and Postpartum Blood Pressure in Preeclampsia  
 Page 27 of 32 Version Date : May 18, [ADDRESS_892092] population will include prisoners.  
Note: Minimal risk for research involving prisoners is the probability and magnitude 
of physical or psychological harm that is normally encountered in the daily lives, or 
in the routine medical, dental, or psychological examination of healthy persons.  
1. Select and justify which allowable category of research involving prisoners 
this research fa lls within:  
 Study of the possible causes, effects, and processes of incarceration, and of 
criminal behavior, provided that the study presents no more than minimal 
risk and no more than inconvenience to the su bjects  
      
 Study of prisons as institutional structures or of prisoners as incarcerated 
persons, provi ded that the study presents no more than minimal risk and 
no more than inconvenience to the subjects  
      
 Research on conditions particularly affecting prisoners as a class (for 
example, vaccine trials and other research on hepatitis which is much 
more prevalent in prisons than elsewhere; and researc h on social and 
psychological problems such as alcoholism, drug addiction, and sexual 
assaults)  
      
 Research on practices, both innovative and accepted, which have the intent 
and reasonable probability of improving the heal th or well -being of the 
subject  
      
 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_32055] a disease by [CONTACT_32122] a disease, the research  presents no 
more than Minimal Risk  and no more than inconvenience to the subjects, 
and Prisoners are not a particular focus of the research.  
      
2. Provide justification for each of th e following  regulatory criteria : 
a) Any possible advantages accruing to the prisoner through his or her 
participation in the research, when compared to the general living 
conditions, medical care, quality of food, amenities and opportunity 
for earnings in the  prison, are not of such a magnitude that his or her 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Acetaminophen  and Postpartum Blood Pressure in Preeclampsia  
 Page 28 of 32 Version Date : May 18, [ADDRESS_892093] the value of such 
advantages in the limited choice environment of the prison is impaired  
      
b) The risks involved in the research are commensurate with risks that 
would be accepted by [CONTACT_162306]  
      
c) Procedures for the selection of subjects within the prison are fair to all 
prisoners and immune from arbitrary intervention by [CONTACT_86690]. U nless justification is provided , control subjects must be 
selected randomly from the group of available prisoners who meet the 
characteristics needed for that particular research project  
      
d) The information is present ed in language which is understandable to 
the subject population  
      
e) Adequate assurance exists that parole boards will not take into account 
a prisoner's participation in the resear ch in making decisions regarding 
parole, and each prisoner is clearly informed in advance that 
participation in the research will have no effect on his or her parole  
      
f) When appropr iate, adequate provision has been made for follow up  
examination or care  after research participation , taking into account 
the varying lengths of individual prisoners' sentences, and for 
informing participants of this fact

 NCI# 9144, PhII -[ADDRESS_701717] response rate for the 
combination compared to single agent bevacizumab.  
Correlative endpoints: 
To evaluate tumor tissue expression of CD105, TGFβ -RII, ACVRL1  and TGFBR1  
kinase from pre- and post -treatment tissue samples in order to determine whether 
CD105 and stem cell activation occurs after exposure to anti -VEGF therapy as 
predicted by [CONTACT_538460], and whether exposure to TRC105 affects these 
changes.   A primary goal of tissue analysis will be to  generate preliminary data to 
correlate levels of CD105,  TGFβ -RII, ACVRL1 and TGFBR1 in tissue with response 
to bevacizumab in combination with TRC105 compared to bevacizumab alone.  To 
compare the soluble CD105 levels at baseline and after treatment between the group 
receiving bevacizumab alone and the group receiving bevacizumab in combination 
with TRC105. 
To compare TGFβ -RII levels at baseline and after treatment between the group 
receiving bevacizumab alone and the group receiving bevacizumab in combination 
with TRC105. 
To evaluate whether circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be detected in this patient 
population using parylene membrane filter technology, and whether changes in CTC counts and CD105 expression on CTCs during therapy correspond to imaging and 
clinical response.  
 2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
2.1. Renal Cancer  
Renal cell cancer (RCC) causes over 13,000 deaths annually in the [LOCATION_002], and 
the incidence is rising [Jemal].  Standard chemotherapy has not been associated with 
significant responses, and the responses associated with immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_538442]- 2 and interferon- α are limited by [CONTACT_538461] 
[MRC, Linehan].  Targeting the unique biology of von Hippel Lindau inactivation (pro-angiog enic vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF , and mammalian target of 
rapaycin, mTOR , activity) has led to the emergence of far more successful therapi[INVESTIGATOR_538443]- free survival and favorably impact overall survival. As a 
result of researc h involving VHL related proteins, bevacizumab, everolimus, 
pazopanib, sorafenib, sunitinib, temsirolimus have all been incorporated as standard 
 NCI# 9144, PhII -[ADDRESS_701718] apoptosi s triggered by [CONTACT_68413] [Li ].  While it is  not expressed  
in vascu lature of normal tissues, it  is overexpressed in the neovasculature of malignant 
tissues, making it  an attractive target . [Fonsatti] .  Activation of  CD105 by [CONTACT_4722]β result s 
in stimulation of  endot helial cell proliferation through the TBR -II/ACVRL1 /TGFBR1  
heterotetrameric receptor complex. [Lebrin]   In addition, tumor cells themselves can 
express CD105, in particular r enal cancer cells [Sandlund] , and higher expression is 
associated with poorer outcomes [Dallas] Furthermore, the presence of CD105 may be a marker of an aggressive, tumor -generating population of RCC cells .  When injected 
into SCID mice, CD105+ RCC cells generated tumors 100% of the time, compared to 10% for CD105- cells [Bussolati].  W hen grown clonally, CD105+ cells expressed 
other characteristic stem cell markers, including CD44, CD90, CD146, CD73, CD29, vimentin, nestin, nanog, musashi, oct4 and the renal embryonic marker Pax2; they did not express pan- cytokeratin, nor the endothelial marker vonWillebrand factor.  Thus, 
CD105 represents an independently valuable therapeutic target that may facilitate elimination of more resistant RCC.

2.2. TRC105  
 
TRC105 is a chimeric  (human:murine) IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody against 
CD105.  It is composed of two light chains of [ADDRESS_701719], t he 
dose was escalated from 0.01 to 1 mg/kg every [ADDRESS_701720] 
was used to complete dose escalation from 0.3 to 15 mg/kg every two weeks and then 
10 and 15 mg/kg weekly and is the clinical material being used in continued development of TRC105.  Serum concentrations expected to saturate CD105 binding were continuously achieved at 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks.  Accumulation was noted at the dose level of 15 mg/kg/week and was associated with hypoproliferative anemia.  This has led to the selection of the dos e of 10 mg/kg weekly as the single agent 
recommended Phase 2 dose.  Dose escalation with bevacizumab was reported at ASCO 2012.  TRC105 and bevacizumab were dosed in 19 patients at TRC105 doses of 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg weekly with the approved dose of bevacizumab.  Tolerability (i.e., a decreased frequency of headaches) was improved when the initial dose of TR105 was delayed one week following the initial dose of bevacizumab and split into two doses during the first week of administration.   Following ASCO,  dose 
escalation continued to the single agent recommended Phase 2 dose of 10 mg/kg of TRC105, which was administered safely and without dose limiting toxicity in combination with the approved dose of bevacizumab of 10 mg/kg.   
 Early evidence for significant activity was noted in the phase I trial, with one 
complete PSA response associated with bone scan normalization and pain resolution in a man with metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer that has been durable for 
>3 years.  There was an additional minor response in a patient with uterine cancer, 
and several patients experienced prolonged disease stabilization.  Antitumor activity was also observed in the Phase Ib trial of TRC105 and bevacizumab.  T umor marker 
reductions and  radiographic response s were noted in multiple patients who 
progressed after prior bevacizumab treatment , who were then treated with TRC105 
weekly and 10 mg/kg bevacizumab every two weeks.  
 
2.3. Bevacizumab  
 
Bevacizumab was approved by [CONTACT_538462], phase III trials documented significantly longer progression- free 
survival for patients treated with  bevacizumab + interferon-α compared to interferon-α alone [Escudier, Rini]; overall survival is also favorably affected.   While bevacizumab was approved in combination with interferon, early  studies  with 
the agent in RCC documented efficacy as a single agent. In a randomized phase II 
 NCI# 9144, PhII -121 
          September 23, 2014  
 13 trial comparing placebo to 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of bevacizumab in metastatic RCC 
patients, the progression-free survival at 4 months was 64% for the 10 mg/kg dose compared to 39% for 3 mg/kg and 20% for placebo and the hazard ratio for time to disease progr ession was 2.55 (p<0.001) representing significant prolongation [Yang ].  
This more- than-doubling reflects the magnitude of effect seen in the interferon 
combination trial though the absolute duration cannot be compared across trials, especially since the phase II trial included  cytokine pre -treated patients, whereas the 
registrational trial [Escudier]  was in therapy -naïve patients.  Further evidence in 
support of single- agent bevacizumab as an appropriate control arm comes from the 
fact that intergroup CTSU E2804 trial had bevacizumab alone as its control arm [NCT0 0378703].   
 The most common side effects related to bevacizumab in RCC patients treated at the dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks included hypertension (14% overall; 8% grade 3), proteinuria (25% overall; 3% grade 3), malaise (13%, only grade 1 and 2), and epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] (8%, only grade 1 and 2) [Yang].  In the registrational trial combining bevacizumab with interferon adverse effects must be put in the context of the high rate of events in the placebo plus interferon arm; the toxicities which were significantly greater in the bevacizumab plus interferon arm included bleeding (33% compared to 9% for placebo, and 3% grade 3 or worse), proteinuria (18% compared to 3% for placebo, and 7% was grade 3 or worse), hypertension (26% compared to 9% for placebo and 3% grade 3 or worse), and thromboembolic events (3% compared to <1% for placebo and 2% grade 3 or worse) [Escudier].  Gastrointestinal perforation was a rare but serious adverse event seen only in the bevacizumab -treated patients.   In 
this trial we have cho sen to utilize bevacizumab without interferon as our control 
arm, in part to minimize toxicity , but also for simplicity and to isolate the added 
effect of TRC105 . 
 
2.4.  Rationale 
 One escape mechanism that may allow RCC to progress despi[INVESTIGATOR_538444]-1α, such as expression of the CD105 receptor [Sanchez- Elsner].  
Specifically, the expression of CD105 has been sh own to be upregulated after cancer 
cells are exposed to treatment with a VEGF antibody [Bochn er, Davis]. This escape 
mechanism makes targeting of CD105 attractive. In addition, the upregulation of CD105 as a result of VEGF ligand inhibition may allow TRC10 5 to be more effective 
by [CONTACT_538463]105 expression on the cell surface. In vitro data indicates that combined use of TRC105 and bevacizumab is more effective than either agent alone in VEGF stimulated tumor cell sprouting studies. (unpublished data) This makes the combination of CD105 inhibition with VEGF inhibition highly attractive in RCC.  
 We will evaluate the combination of TRC105, a monoclonal antibody against CD105, plus bevacizumab compared to bevacizumab alone in pre- treated metastatic renal 
cancer patients with a primary endpoint of progression- free survival  at 12 and 24 
 NCI# 9144, PhII -121

 14 weeks . The doses were chosen based on results from a phase Ib trial combining 
bevacizumab and TRC105. Seven  patients were treated at the top dose level  (10 
mg/kg bevacizumab + 10 mg/kg TRC105) without the development of DLT. Thus, 
this is a safe dosing schema for phase II study. 
 
2.5. Correlative Studies Background  
Hypoxia is known to upregulate CD105 expression [Li ], which increases signaling 
via the TGFβ- RII and activin -like receptor kinase ACVRL1 /TGFBR1  heterodimer.  
Higher CD105 expression (measured by [CONTACT_9064]) has been associated with higher risk of metastasis and death in several solid tumors [Schimming, Mineo, Dales].  While subjects with high expression of CD105 may have poorer prognosis, 
we anticipate that subjects with higher expression of CD105 activity will be mo re 
likely to respond to TRC105 and  less likely to respond to bevacizumab alone.   
In addition to the importance of being inducible by [CONTACT_398]105, TGFβ signaling via 
TGFBR1  has taken on new significance as it is identified as one of the pathways for 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]- to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [Kalluri], a hallmark of aggressive cancer.   
Increa sed expression of TGFβ mRNA in kidney cancer tissue compared to normal kidney 
tissue may indicate that this is an autocrine growth pathway [Gomella].   Tumor  tissue 
will be evaluated for exp ression of TGFβ- RII activity  using immunohistochemistry 
and immunof luorescence . Given that CD105 and other hypoxia-induced growth factors 
signal via this receptor, and it has been implicated in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_538445] (EMT), we hypothesize that higher expression will be associated with a poorer overall prognosis.  Since it may represent an escape pathway for VEGF inhibition, we hypothesize that elevated baseline expression will be associated with a higher likelihood of response to TRC105 and lower likelihood of response to bevacizumab alone.   
Given that TG F can signal via TGFBR1 to activate angiogenesis or through alternate 
receptor pathways including ACVRL1 to reduce angiogenesis, the differential expression of these proteins may prove markers of which cancers are more angiogenesis -driven.  We 
postulate th at elevated baseline tissue expression of TGFBR1 would be associated with a 
better prognosis due to higher likelihood of response to bevacizumab, but that higher expression of ACVRL1 would be associated with lower overall treatment response. 
  
Measuring VEGF after exposure to bevacizumab has proven difficult, since the agent 
interferes with the assay [Kindler], though immunodepletion may allow detection of a decrease despi[INVESTIGATOR_538446] -bound ligand [Loupakis].  
Thus, finding other molecular changes induced during response or progression on bevacizumab remains a high priority.   Suppression of VEGF signaling in preclinical models results in upregulation of CD105 expression.  CD105 is an integral component of TGFβ signaling; suppression of CD105 may result i n a compensatory 
increase in its upstream activator  TGFβ . This compensatory increase could represent 
a surrogate marker for effective CD105 suppression and tumor response. Circulating 
sCD105 has been found at high le vels in metastatic solid tumors [Takahashi].  We 
will explore serum levels  of sCD105 and TGFβ in met astatic  RCC patients , and 
 NCI# 9144, PhII -121 
          September 23, 2014  
 15 correlate baseline levels with prognosis and likelihood of response to TRC105.  We 
anticipate that subjects assigned to combination therapy (Arm B) will have lower levels of sCD105 and TGFβ at post- treatment time points compared to Arm A, where 
we expect serum levels of both factors to increase. .  
 Although circulating tumor cells  (CTCs)  have not yet been validated as a prognostic 
marker in RCC, they have proved to be strongly prognostic for prostate and breast 
cancer patients [deBono, Cristofanilli].  Using CD45 autoMACS depletion, investigators have been able to identify  CTCs in a high percentage of patients with localized RCC undergoing nephrectomy , which correlated with presence of nodal  
involvement and synchronous metastases [ Bluemke].  Given that targeted therapy for 
RCC results primarily in disease stabilization rather than dramatic regression of tumor burden, it can be difficult to measure the degree of response or benefit.  Reduction in CTCs could be a very useful objective measure by [CONTACT_538464].  We will use blood samples from baseline and after 6 weeks 
and 12 weeks to enumerate CTCs using a paryl ene membrane filter technology 
developed by [CONTACT_538465] [Zheng ].  We will evaluate whether 
changes in CTC counts reflect subsequent changes on radiographic imaging to determine whether changes in CTC counts could predict for ultimate radiographic response versus progression.  In addition, CTCs will be evaluated for CD105 expression by [CONTACT_538466]105 has an effect on  
CD105 expression.  Reduction in CTCs which express CD105 could correspond to elimination of cancer cells with more “stem -like” properties, a population resistant to 
standard therapy, which could account for resistance to VEGF- targeted therapy in 
RCC.

5.2. General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
There are no known drug-drug interactions for the study medications.  However, because these are vascular -targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], caution is warranted with 
anticoagulation.  Full- dose anticoagulation will exclude patients from enrollment in 
the study; if a subject develops an indication for full-dose anticoagulation, the appropriateness of their continuation on study therapy should be carefully assessed in consultation with the principal investigator.  
 
5.3. Duration of Therapy 
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event (s), treatment may continue for 
up to 12 cycles,  or until one of the following criteria applies: 
 
• Disease progression,  
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s),  specifical ly arterial thrombotic event, 
symptomatic grade 4 venous thrombosis, grade 4 hemorrhage, grade 4 
hypertension, grade 4 proteinuria, GI perforation or wound dehiscence. 
 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or 
 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. 
 
• Pregnancy  
 
5.4. Duration of Follow Up 
 
Patients will be followed for [ADDRESS_701737].  Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse event (s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.

• For expedited reporting purposes only:   
o AEs for the agent that  are bold and italicized in the CAEPR ( i.e., those listed 
in the SPEER column, Section 7.1.1) should be reported through CTEP -AERS  
only if the grade is above the grade provided in the SPEER. 
o Other AEs for the protocol that do not require expedited reporting are outlined 
in section  7.3.4. 
 
• Attribution  of the AE: 
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
 NCI# 9144, PhII -121 
          September 23, 2014  
 31 - Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
6.3. Expedited Adverse Event Reporting  
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_701740] use CTEP -AERS  (CTEP Adverse 
EventReporting System), accessed via the CTEP Web site  
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ).  The reporting procedures to be followed are 
presented in the “ NCI G uidelines  for Investigators: Adverse E vent Reporting 
Requirements  for DCTD (CTEP and CIP) and DCP INDs and IDEs ” which 
can be d ownloaded from the CTEP Web site  (http://ctep.cancer.gov ).  These 
requirements are briefly outlined in the tables below (Section 7.3.3). 
 
In the rare occurrence when Internet connectivity is lost, a 24-hour 
notification is to be made to CT EP by [CONTACT_1381] [PHONE_101].  Once 
Internet connectivity is restored, the 24-hour notification phoned in must be 
entered electronically into CTEP -AERS  by [CONTACT_433].  
 
7.3.2 CTEP -AERS  is programmed for automatic electronic distribution of reports to 
the following individuals:  Study Coordinator of the Lead Organization, Principal Investigator, and the local treating physician.  CTEP -AERS  provides 
a copy feature for other e -mail recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
 
7.3.3 Expedited Reporting Guidelines  
 
Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol- specific patient ID assigned 
during trial registration on all reports.  
 
Note:   
“Any death occurring  within [ADDRESS_701741] dose, regardless of attribution to 
the investigational agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours.” 
 
“Any death occurring greater than [ADDRESS_701742] dose of the 
investigational agent/intervention re quires expedited reporting within 24 hours 
only if  it is possibly, probably or definitely related to the investigational 
agent/intervention.” 
  Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) - Other 
(Progressive Disease)”  under the system organ class (SOC) of the same 
 NCI# 9144, PhII -121 
          September 23, 2014  
 32 name.  Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease 
(e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical 
deterioration associated with a disease process) should be submitted.  
 
 
Late Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies: Expedited Reporting Requirements for Adverse 
Events that Occur on Studies under an IND/IDE within [ADDRESS_701743] Administration 
of the Investigational Agent/Intervention1, 2 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not 
they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
 An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
 
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST  be immediately reported to the NCI via CTEP -
AERS within the timeframes detailed in the table below.

Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) portion of the CAEPR  
Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as:  
o “24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days” - The AE must initially be reported via CTEP -AERS within 24 hours of 
learning of the AE, followed by a complete expedited report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24-hour report.  
o “10 Calendar Days” - A complete expedited report on the AE must be submitted within [ADDRESS_701744] administration of investigational 
agent/intervention and have an attribution of possible, probable, or definite require reporting as follows:  
Expedited 24 -hour notification followed by [CONTACT_432] 5 calendar days for:  
• All Grade 4, and Grade 5 AEs  
Expedited 10 calendar day reports for:  
• Grade 2 adverse events resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]

Center at the City of Hope ( [EMAIL_593] ).  
 
6.5. Secondary Malignancy 
 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy 
(e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A 
secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  CTEP require s all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an 
agent under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS . Three options are 
available to describe the event:  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., a cute myelocytic 
leukemia [AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
6.6. Secon d Malignancy 
 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).   Second malignancies require ONLY 
routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified .

7.2. Bevacizumab  
 
8.2.1 Descriptive information  
 
Bevacizumab  (Avastin®, Genentech) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal 
IgG1 antibody that binds to and inhibits the biologic activity of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in in vitro and in vivo assay systems. 
Bevacizumab contains human framework regions and the complement arity-
determining regions of a murine antibody that binds to VEGF. Avastin has an approximate molecular weight of 149 kD. Bevacizumab is produced in a mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) expression system in a nutrient medium containing the antibiotic gentamicin.   Gentamicin is not detectable in the 
final product.  Bevacizumab is FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic RCC.  
 Bevacizumab  is a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to pale brown, sterile, pH 
6.2 solution for intravenous infusion. Bev acizumab  is supplied in 100 mg and 400 
mg preservative -free, single-use vials to deliver 4 mL or 16 mL of Bevacizumab  
(25 mg/mL). The [ADDRESS_701748] is formulated in 240 mg α,α- trehalose 
dihydrate, 23.2 mg sodium phosphate (monobasic, monohydrate), 4.8 mg sodium phosphate (dibasic, anhydrous), 1.[ADDRESS_701749] is formulated in 960 mg α,α-trehalose dihydrate, 92.8 mg sodium phosphate (monobasic, monohydrate), 19.2 mg sodium phosphate (dibasic, anhydrous), 6.[ADDRESS_701750] practices.

 NCI# 9144, PhII -[ADDRESS_701751] change after expression to VEGF antibody (bevacizumab) alone or with the added blockade of CD105 (TRC105).  We will also eva luate for changes  in serum factors and CTC expression induced by 
[CONTACT_3148], which will generate preliminary data about whether the agent in fact hits the 
target, and elucidate potential mechanisms of resistance to therapy.  
 Techniques.  Standard technique will be used for immunohistochemical (IHC) 
analysis, utilizing the commercially available primary murine antibodies against CD105 (Abcam) and TGFβ-RII (Abcam), and immunofluorecence using primary murine antibodies against ALK-1 and ALK-5 (Santa Cruz Biotech).  Following deparaffinization, antigen retrieval will be performed with heating during incubation with citrate buffer.  IHC will be visualized using 3,3’- diaminobenzidine (DAB; DAKO, Japan) and immunofluorescence with fluorescein antimouse IgG (Invitrogen).  We have chosen IHC and immunofluorescence because these are the methods  
for assessing CD105, TGFβ-RII, and ALK- [ADDRESS_701752] ELISA kits will be used for serum TGFβ and sCD105 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, [LOCATION_003]) and samples collected throughout the study will be run in batches.  CTCs will be run on microfilters developed by [CONTACT_538470]. We have chosen this platform because it allows for additional sophisticated assays of the captured cells, such as interrogation of captured cells for e xpression by [CONTACT_538471] [Xu 
2010, Xu 2011].  Also, since enumeration of CTCs by [CONTACT_538472] (CellSearch®) assay has not been shown to have prognostic value in RCC, it is not considered standard, and would not be held as the gold standard for this disease.  
Validation of the USC/CalTech microfilter platform in  
comparison to the Veridex assay has been completed as part of the randomized phase III clinical trial SWOG S0421 (results pending).    Competence of the laboratories which  will perform the assays.

 37 bloodwork at the same time as clinically necessary laboratory tests are being 
performed.  Tissue which has previously  been obtained by [CONTACT_538473], and extra biopsy will be an optional part of the study.  Only subjects with safely accessible tumors (ex: palpable lymph nodes or subcutaneous nodules) will be considered for participation in the extra biopsy.  Results of the correlative studies will not be routinely provided to subjects or treating physicians since they have not been validated for clinical decision -
making, however, results may be provided to treating physicians who request the results.  
 Banking of specimens.   In order to maximize the value of clinically annotated 
biological specimens obtained as part of this study, all unused tissue and blood will be banked.  However, tissue blocks which are submitted will NOT be banked, but will be returned so that they would be available to subjects should they need additional analysis of their tissue in the future.  Subjects who participate in the voluntary extra biopsy will have those tissue blocks banked.  Banking of specimens will be handled by [CONTACT_538474].

 immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence 
 
  [IP_ADDRESS]  Collection  
 
For all subjects, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks or unstained slides from a prior biopsy or nephrectomy specimen will be requested.  Please select a section that contains tumor.  If blocks are provided, the USC Norris Pathology Core will cut [ADDRESS_701753] 9 unstained slides (5 micron thick) plus 1 H&E from the same block. 
 
For subjects who agree to a repeat biopsy after therapy in order to compare tissue expression before and after treatment, a core needle biopsy is required to provide adequate tissue; if a core biopsy cannot be safely obtained the subject should not be asked to participate in the optional repeat biopsy aspect of the protocol.  Blocks or unstained slides should be prepared as above.

8.3.  Outcome measures  for correlative studies  
 
All data will be recorded using study ID #s only, without protected health information.  Data will be recorded in CAFÉ, the electronic database managed by [CONTACT_538477] (CISO). 
 
Tissue :  IHC will be evaluated for intensity by [CONTACT_141815], [CONTACT_538498], using ACIS.  ACIS, the automated cellular imaging system, provides a reproducible quantification of staining, both % of cells staining as well as intensity.  Both will be recorded.  IHC will be run in batches of 14 subjects intermittently during the study duration or within 3 months after study closure.  
 
Serum :  Standard ELISA kits will be used (R&D systems, Minneapolis, [LOCATION_003]) and 
samples collected throughout the study will be run in batches during the study duration or within 3 months after study closure.  
 
Circulating Tumor Cells:  Because the results are best when specimens are processed 
immediately, CTC samples will be processed on microfilters immediately upon receipt.  IHC staining for CD105 will occur in batches, however.  The following data will be

Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228-247, 2009].  Changes in the 
largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 For the purposes of this study, patients should be re- evaluated for response every 12 
weeks.  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4-6 weeks  following initial documentation of objective response.

Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response.  Patients who have lesions present at 
baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for non- target dise ase.  The response 
assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.

except for lymph nodes ) as >[ADDRESS_701763] x- ray or as >[ADDRESS_701764] be recorded in 
millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area will not be 
considered measurable.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_701765] 
scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or involved lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm 
short axis), are considered non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non -measurable.  
 Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they ar e, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 
 NCI# 9144, PhII -121 
          September 23, 2014  
 44 ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ 
and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum di ameters will be used as 
reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. 
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of 
these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
 
11.1.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_147877](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they 
are superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin 
lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray  Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when 
 NCI# 9144, PhII -[ADDRESS_701766] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the a vailability of MRI is variable globally.  As with 
CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts,  
and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body  scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if 
possible.  
PET- CT  At pre sent, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a 
combined PET- CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with 
RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic 
CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET- CT can be used 
for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
Ultrasound  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not 
be used as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine 
 NCI# 9144, PhII -121 
          September 23, 2014  
 46 relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical 
resection is an endpoint. 
 
Tumor markers   There are no tumor markers to be followed for RCC patients. 
 
Cytology, Histology   The cy tological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any 
effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
FDG -PET  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is 
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to 
complement CT scanning in assessment of progressi on (particularly possible 'new' 
disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG- PET imaging can be identified 
according to the following algorithm:  
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a 
sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FD G-PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at follow -up:  If the 
positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease 
confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up is not 
confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional  follow-up CT  scans 
are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET 
scan).  If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre- existing 
site of dis ease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic 
images, this is not PD.  
c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar 
to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG- PET in this 
circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623]- specific medical literature for the indication.  
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy 
resolution/sensitivity.  
   Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an 
uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
11.1.4 Response Criteria  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any 
 NCI# 9144, PhII -121 
          September 23, 2014  
 47 pathological lymph nodes (whether target or 
non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on st udy (this 
includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for 
PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient  to be considered in complete 
clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non- target 
lesion(s).  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions 
and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.  Unequivocal 
progression should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 NCI# 9144, PhII -121

Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_36408], 
and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of 
disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation 
of treatment.

since SD is increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment  of efficacy in 
some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not 
advised  
 
11.1.5 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 The duration of overa ll CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

analysis (12 and 24 weeks) proposed by [Freidlin].  Secondary endpoints will include toxicity, RECIST response rate and investigation of correlative markers.  
The main endpoint of interest will be whether the combination arm has a greater PFS than single agent bevacizumab.  Planning is based on the supposition of 12 -week PFS 
of 61% on the control arm and 78% on the combination arm.   This improvement of 17% corresponds to reducing the hazard of progression in half by [CONTACT_538481]105 to 
Bevacizumab.  The corresponding hypothesized PFS at 24 weeks would be 37% on the single -agent arm and 60% on the combination arm.  A randomized design is needed 
 NCI# 9144, PhII -[ADDRESS_701771] line therapy in RCC, 
published phase II and retrospective data for the use of sunitinib or sorafenib after prior VEGF -targeted therapy document median progression- free survival of 16- 34 weeks 
[DiLorenzo, Motzer 2006, Zimmerman].   Our  planning hypotheses, described above, 
correspond to median PFS of 17 weeks on the single agent arm, and 33 weeks on the combination arm.     Enrollment of 88 patients, at a rate of one patient per week, would provide approximately 80% power for a one -side d test at the 0.10 level of significance, based 
conservatively on a single evaluation.  We propose to use the two- point analysis (12 
and 24 weeks) proposed by [CONTACT_311382] [Freidlin] for unblinded randomized trials using PFS, which will increase power.    An interim analysis for futility will be done 
after [ADDRESS_701772] binomial lower confidence bounds will be calculated.   
 
In addition to the planned interim analysis for futility, the study will receive routine review  at monthly meetings of the [LOCATION_004] Cancer Consortium Data Coordinating 
Center to ensure adequacy of enrollment, tolerability  of treatment, and suitability of 
enrolled subjects (e.g. adequate expected survival).     
 
12.2.  Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
The sample size will be [ADDRESS_701773] to clear -
cell versus non- clear -cell disease, an d ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 versus 2. 
 
12.4. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
 
Correlative Endpoints:  The data generated from the correlative studies during this protocol will be exploratory in nature.

13.4.1 Tissue  studies  
Baseline levels of CD105, TGFβ- RII, TGFBR1 and ACVRL1  will be correlated 
with response.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] For CD105 , the reported median number of cells staining positive per core 
is 5 (range 0 -79) and staining in at least one of 2 tissue cores had some 
staining positivity in 75% [Sandlund].  We anticipate that patients whose 
tumors have higher levels of CD105 staining will be more likely to 
respond to TRC105 plus bevacizumab, and may be less likely to respond to bevacizumab alone.  If 5 subjects  on the combination arm  were to 
respond, and all 5 had above- median staining, the association would be 
significant (p=0.024) by a  one-sided version of Fisher’ s exact test.  While 
this provides an example of a detectable effect , without invoking a 
detailed model , the planned  analysis will use a rank -sum test  for improved 
power.  Generalized linear models for ordered categorical data will be used to address the treatment and staining interaction using the full dataset.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] For TGFβ -RII, the expression in kidney cancer ha s not yet been well 
described.  Given that CD105 and other hypoxia-induced growth factors signal via this receptor, and it has been implicated in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_538445] (EMT), we will explore the associate of this receptor’s expression wit h outcomes in study patients.   
 [IP_ADDRESS]. For TGFBR1 and ACVRL1 , again there are not published reports of 
extent of expression in renal carcinoma.  H owever, given that TGF can 
signal via ALK -[ADDRESS_701774] response to therapy 
and/or prognosis. 
 
13.4.2 Serum studies   
 
The change in serum levels of sCD105 will be compared between groups A & B.  
We anticipate that subjects assigned to combination therapy (Arm B) will have 
lower  levels  of sCD105 at post- treatment time points compared to Arm A, where 
we expect levels to increase. Both baseline levels of sCD105 and changes during 
treatment will be correlated with response , using the approach described above.   
 
(CTCs:  The change in number of CTCs from baseline to repeat time points will 
be correlated with radiographic response.  The change in expression of CD105 on CTCs will be compared between groups.) – ON HOLD pending funding

          September 23, 2014  
 55 12.5. Reporting and Exclusions  
 
13.5.1 Evaluation of toxicity  – All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time 
of their first treatment with Bevacizumab and TRC105. 
 
13.5.2 Evaluation of response – All patients included in the study must be assessed for 
response to treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if 
they are ineligible.  Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories:  1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insuf ficient data).   
 
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria and were randomized will be 
included in the main analysis of the response rate.  Patients in response categories [ADDRESS_701775] a treatment failure (disease 
progression).  Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.  
 
Subgroup analyses will include evaluation of progression-free survival among those categorized as good risk or intermediate risk by [CONTACT_538482].  Additionally, clear cell and non- clear cell 
subjects will be analyzed as separate subgroups.  
 
12.6. Safety Monitoring 
 
Safety and toxicity will b e reviewed monthly at the CCCP Data Coordinating Meetings, 
in which all toxicities (especially Grade 3+) are assembled and reviewed.   In addition, 
every time a patient dies within [ADDRESS_701776] likely due to 
treatment, then   a careful review of the trial data will be mandated.   Based on the review, 
a decisi on will be made to continue the study unchanged or to modify the regimen and 
amend the protocol.    Finally, at approximately every 6 months, at the time of the DSMC 
review, all deaths on both arms will be tabulated for overall review.  
13.   DATA AND SAFETY M ONITORING PLAN  
 
13.1. Oversight of CCCP Phase I and Phase II Trials 
 
The [LOCATION_004]n Cancer Consortium with Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] (CCCP) will oversee the development and conduct of all Phase I and II trials that are undertaken as part of this consortium.  However, it is also the CCCP policy to take advantage of reviews and infrastruct ure provided by [CONTACT_538483] (PRMSs) that are in place at each participating Cancer Center.  In addition to these institutional mechanisms for review and oversight, to ensure that the CCCP 
 NCI# 9144, PhII -[ADDRESS_701777]. 
 
14.1.1 Review of Trials Prior to Activation  
Prior to developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a protocol, the concept for a Phase I or Phase II trial is 
discusse d at a monthly CCCP teleconference.   While this discussion is 
informal, no concept is given the go- ahead without approval by [CONTACT_538484] (i.e. the grant PI’s at each of the 4 member institutions, for both the Phase I U01 and Phase II N01).  Discussion includes the scientific merit 
of the proposal, the compatibility with the CCCP priorities, and the ability to complete the study in a timely fashion. Once the protocol document is completed, the protocol is reviewed by [CONTACT_538485], by [CONTACT_538486] (to verify adherence to boilerplate and formatting requirements), as well as the CCCP leadership; at this stage, the plans to monitor safety and (if appropriate) efficacy are carefully reviewed.  
 
This is done before the document  is submitted for review by [CONTACT_241312]/or 
other sponsors, as well as the CCCP institutional PRMSs and IRBs. 
 
14.1.[ADDRESS_701778], and Data While Trial is Open to Accrual 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Ongoing Review 
The protocol principal investigator (PI) is responsible for monitoring the conduct and progress of this Phase I trial, including the ongoing review of accrual, data and toxicities, as well as the accumulation of reported adverse events from other trials testing the same drug(s).  The participating clinicians and their designees are responsible for timely submission of adverse event reports and case report forms.  The Data Coordinating Center for the CCCP Consortium is responsible for providing the PI [INVESTIGATOR_528910] a timely fashion.   Although the PI [INVESTIGATOR_528911], it is the Operations Office of the CCCP that distributes all submitted SAE reports to the 
appropriate individuals, including the local protocol principal investigators, at each of the participating institutions.   
 
The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) posts a summary (accrual, toxicities, and responses) of each CCCP i nitiated trial on the 
CCCP website.  In this way, each PI [INVESTIGATOR_25499]- to-date 
information on the status of his or her trial.  In consultation with the collaborating statistician, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_36417]:

The DCC meets monthly to review data management and data 
quality issues – completeness of data submissions as well as 
accuracy.  Any issues identified and the corrective plans are presented at the next CCCP teleconference meeting for review and approval. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Oversight 
Oversight of the conduct of CCCP trials occurs at several levels:  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 The Operations Office for the CCCP flags all trials that are approaching a decision in terms of toxicity (for both Phase I and Phase II trials) or responses (for Phase II trials).  Decisions are made by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_538455] (U01 Cooperative Agreement or N01 Contract, as appropriate) or his or her designee, and are communicated to the participating centers by [CONTACT_538487].  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 At the monthly teleconferences, the status of each open protocol is reviewed. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 For CTEP sponsored Phase I trials, data are reported 
to the NCI -designated clinical trials monitoring 
service (CTMS) which will audit patients’ records on each protocol – at each CCCP institution;  this audit 
is initiated by [CONTACT_472].  For all other CCCP trials, the CCCP will contract with Theradex to audit patient records at each CCCP institution.

 63 APPENDIX B : CTEP MULTICENTER GUIDELINES  
 
 
If an institution wishes to collaborate with other participating institutions in performing a CTEP sponsored research protocol, then the following guidelines must be followed. 
 
Responsibility of the Protocol Chair  
• The Protocol Chair will be the single liaison with the CTEP Protocol and Information Office (PIO).  The Protocol Chair is responsible for the coordination, development, submission, and approval of the protocol as well as its subsequent amendments.  The protocol must not be rewritten or modified by [CONTACT_36475].  There will be only one version of the protocol, and each participating institution will use that document.  The Protocol Chair is responsible for assuring that all participating institutions are using the correct version of the protocol. 
• The Protocol Chair is responsible for the overall conduct of the study at all participating institutions and for monitoring its progress.  All reporting r equirements to CTEP are the 
responsibility of the Protocol Chair.  
• The Protocol Chair is responsible for the timely review of Adverse Events (AE) to assure safety of the patients.  
• The Protocol Chair will be responsible for the review of and timely submission of data for study analysis. 
 
Responsibilities of the Coordinating Center 
• Each participating institution will have an appropriate assurance on file with the Office 
for Human Research Protection (OHRP), NIH.  The Coordinating Center is responsible 
for ass uring that each participating institution has an OHRP assurance and must maintain 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_36419].  
•  Prior to the activation of the protocol at each participating institution, an OHRP form 
310 (documentation of IRB appr oval) must be submitted to the CTEP PIO.  
• The Coordinating Center is responsible for central patient registration.  The Coordinating Center is responsible for assuring that IRB approval has been obtained at each participating site prior to the first patient registration from that site.  
• The Coordinating Center is responsible for the preparation of all submitted data for review by [CONTACT_36476]. 
• The Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of AE reports.  There are two options for AE reporting: (1) participating institutions may report directly to CTEP with a copy to the Coordinating Center, or (2) participating institutions report to the Coordinating Center who in turn report to CTEP.  The Coordinating Center will submit AE reports to the Protocol Chair for timely review.  
 
 
 NCI# 9144, PhII -121 
          September 23, 2014  
 64 • Audits may be accomplished in one of two ways:  (1) source documents and research 
records for selected patients are brought from participating sites to the Coordinating Center for audit, or (2) selected patient records may be audited on- site at participating 
sites.  If the NCI chooses to have an audit at the Coordinating Center, then the Coordinating Center is responsible for having all source documents, research records, all IRB approval documents, NCI Drug Accountability Record forms, patient registration lists, response assessments scans, x -rays, etc. available for the audit.  
 
Inclusion of Multicenter Guidelines in the Protocol 
• The protocol must include the following minimum information:  
1. The title page must include the name [CONTACT_538493], telephone number and e-mail address of the responsible investigator at each participating institution.  
2. The Coordinating Center must be designated on the title page. 
3. Central registration of patients is required.  The procedures for registration must be stated in the protocol. 
4. Data collection forms should be of a common format.  Sample forms should be submitted with the protocol.  The frequency and timing of data submission forms to the Coordinating Center should be stated. 
5. Describe how AEs will be reported from the participating institutions, either directly to CTEP or through the Coordinating Center. 
6. Describe how Safety Reports and Action Letters from CTEP will be distributed to participating institutions. 
 
Agent Ordering 
• Except in very unusual circumstances, each participating institution will order DCTD-supplied investigational agents directly from CTEP.  Investigational agents may be ordered by a participating site only after the initial IRB approval for the site has been forwarded by [CONTACT_36477].

APPENDIX C:  INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER 
AGENTS FOR PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS AND NON -STUDY HEALTH 
CARE TEAM  
 
The patient ____________________________ is enrolled on a clinical trial using the experimental agent TRC105.  This clinical trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_29630].  
This form is addressed to the patient, but includes important information for others who care for this patient.  
 Because TRC105 is an antibody, it is not known to interact with many other medications.  However, it does increase the risk of bleeding, and this side effect could be made worse by [CONTACT_538490] “thin the blood” at the same time.   
 Many health care prescribers can write prescriptions.  You must also tell your other prescribers (doctors, physicians’ assistants or nurse practitioners) that you are taking part in a clinical trial. Bring this paper with you and ke ep the attached information card in your wallet .   
 Please be very careful!  Over -the-counter drugs have a brand name [CONTACT_159964]—it’s usually big 
and catches your eye.  They also have a generic name—it’s usually small and located above or below the brand name, and printed in the ingredient list.  Find the generic name [CONTACT_159965], with the pharmacist’s help, whether there could be an adverse interaction.    Other medicines can be a problem with your study drugs.   
• You should check with your doctor or pharmacist whenever you need to use an over-the-counter medicine or herbal supplement.  
 
• Your regular prescriber should check a medical reference or call your study doctor before prescribing any new medicine for you.  Your study doctor’s name [CONTACT_832] _____________________________________ and he or she can be contact[CONTACT_6811] _____________________________________.

Monday through Friday (except holidays). 
2. Patients must be registered within 5 days (to allow for drug shipment via Priority Mail) prior to initiation of protocol therapy. 
3. A patient failing to  meet all protocol requirements may not be registered.  If you have any 
questions regarding eligibility, contact [CONTACT_170738] (DCC) at (626) 256-HOPE (4673), extension [ZIP_CODE]. 
4. Prestudy laboratory tests, scans and x -rays must be completed prior to registration 
according to study calendar/protocol. 
5. Patients must sign an informed consent prior to registration. 6. Confirm that the patient meets all inclusion and exclusion eligibility criteria for a protocol.  
7. Complete the Eligibility Checklist.   
8. Verify that all required prestudy tests were performed.  
9. Fax the completed Eligibility Checklist, signed and dated informed consent, pathology report, and relevant laboratory results to the City of Hope Consortium Coordinator for  
confirmation of eligibility.  The FAX number is ([PHONE_11182].  
10. Call the City of Hope Consortium Coordinator at (626) 256- HOPE (4673), extension [ADDRESS_701783] them paged at ([PHONE_10956]. 
11. If the patient qualifies, the City of Hope Consortium Coordinator will call the registering institution to complete the registration/randomization procedure and assign the patient's study ID number.   
12. Once a patient has been registered, the Data Coordinating Center will provide a "Confirmation of Registration" to the center registering the patient via email.

 67 APPENDIX E:  INFORMATION ABOUT CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 
Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence.   
Deparaffinization will be performed using xylene, followed by [CONTACT_538491] (100%, 95%, 85% for 5 min 3x, 2x, and 1x respectively).  Antigen retrieval will be 
performed in 0.001M citrate buffer (pH 7) and incubation in the pressure cooker for 5 minutes.  
Non-specific protein binding will be performed using albumin for 30 minutes, then endogenous 
peroxidase will be blocked using 3% H2O2 in distilled water.  Commercially available primary murine antibodies against CD105 (Abcam) and TGFβ-RII (Abcam) diluted 1:100 will be applied and incubated overnight at 4̊ C. For ALK-1 and ALK-5 (Santa Cruz Biotech) primary murine antibodies for immunofluorecence will be diluted 1:100 and incubated overnight at 4̊ C.    Secondary antibody diluted 1:500 will be applied (mouse-horseradish peroxidase) and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature.  IHC will be visualized using 3,3’- diaminobenzidine (DAB; DAKO, Japan)  with hematoxylin counter- stain,  and immunofluorescence with fluorescein 
antimouse IgG (Invitrogen).  We have chosen IHC and immunofluorescence because these are the methods for assessing CD105, TGFβ-RII, and ALK-[ADDRESS_701784]  (DH) , and IHC will be graded 0-2+ based on 
intensity of staining.  The pathologist will also use ACIS , and analysis will be performed using 
the ACIS output which is an arbitrary number from 0-[ADDRESS_701785] ELISA kits will be us ed for serum TGF β and sCD105 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, 
[LOCATION_003]) and samples collected throughout the study will be run in batches.    Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs).  
CTCs will be run on microfilters developed by [CONTACT_538470], using technique which has been  previously reported [Xu 2010, Xu 2011]. Briefly ,  7.5ml peripheral blood will be drawn by 
[CONTACT_538492] [ADDRESS_701786] tube. The tube will be kept at room temperature and delivered to the Goldkorn laboratory, where it will be subjected to Ficoll-Paque centrifugation to deplete red blood cells and to isolate the “buffy coat” layer containing CTC and white blood cells (WBC). Then, the buffy coat will be passed through the slot microfilter using a constant low-pressure delivery apparatus. The microfi lter-captured cells will be fixed in 1% formalin and 
subjected to immunofluorescent staining for cytokeratin ( Cam 5.2, BD), CD105, and DAPI. Captured CTC (DAPI
+Cam5.2+) will be enumerated by a blinded independent observer using the 
Nuance multispectral imaging platform.  Because there are fewer cells anticipated than are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_538459], percent of cells staining  IHC+  will be reported in addition 
to an intensity  score.

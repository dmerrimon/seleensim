Change Rationale Affected Protocol Sections 
Revised lesion count wording during the 
Recurrence Follow-up Period to indicate 
that lesions ‘within the treatment area’ should be counted.  Previously it was 
stated that lesions counted must be 
completely in the treatment area. To address concern 
regarding possible 
underestimation of 
recurrence. x Section 7.5.1 
Deleted reference to analysis of 
treatment/location interaction to show concordance. To provide clarification; 
the face and scalp will be analyzed as a whole; the 
face and scalp will also be

 The study consists of Screening, Treatment, Response Assessment Period, and a Recurrence Follow-
up Period.  After a Screening Period of up to 28 days, subjects will return to the site for confirmation 
of eligibility.  Eligible subjects will be randomized on Day 1 to treatment in a 1:1 (KX2-391 
Ointment 1% or vehicle) ratio in each treatment area subgroup. 
The treatment area will be marked with indelible marker at Baseline (Day 1 predose) at the 
investigational site.  Subjects will be given verbal and written instructions on self-administration of 
study drug/vehicle and a study kit containing [ADDRESS_938171] unresolved LSRs, hypo- or hy per- pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], scarring in the treatment area, 
or treatment-related AEs at Day 57 will return for additional follow-up, which includes standardized 
photography of the treatment area, every 7 to 28 days until resolution, returned to baseline, or deemed stabilized by [CONTACT_32366]. 
Subjects who achieve 100% clearance of AK lesions in the treatment area at Day 57 will continue in 
the Recurrence Follow-up Period to determine recurrence rate and safety for up to 12 months 
following the Day 57 Visit.  Visits du ring the Recurrence Follow-up Period will occur every 
3 months.  Subjects who develop AK lesions in the treatment area during the Recurrence Follow-up 
Period will be discontinued at the time of recurrence.  
Number of Subjects 
A sufficient number of subjects will be screened to randomize approximately 300 subjects.  At each 
site, a minimum of 10 subjects and a maximum of 20 subjects are projected to be enrolled.

Concomitant Drug/Therapy 
Use of any treatment for AK lesions other than study drug on the treatment area is prohibited during 
the study.  
Assessments during the Treatment and Response Assessment Periods (Day 1 through Day 57) 
Efficacy Assessments  
A dermatologist (Investigator or Subinvestigator) will perform a count of clinically visible AK lesions 
(lesion count) for all subjects at Screening, Baseline (Day 1 predose), and at the Response Assessment Visits on Days 8, 15, 29, and 57. 
Safety Assessments 
Safety will be assessed periodically through Day 57 by [CONTACT_88668], serious adverse events 
(SAEs), LSRs, and events of special interest. 
Safety assessments will also include vital signs, the performance of PEs, ECGs, laboratory evaluation 
of hematology, biochemistry, and urinalyses, and evaluation of pi[INVESTIGATOR_691733] ( Table 1 , Schedule of Procedures and Assessments). 
At each study visit, subjects will be asked a general question “How have you been since the last 
visit?”.  Adverse events will be recorded at each study visit, before assessment of LSRs, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and scarring in the treatment area.  AEs will be reported separately from LSRs. 
LSR Assessments The LSR assessment is the Investigator’s (or Subinvestigator’s) assessment of the following signs on the 
treatment area:  erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, ves iculation/pustulation, and 
erosion/ulceration.  These signs will be assessed using a grading scale ranging from 0=absent, 1=mild 
(slightly, barely perceptible), 2=moderate (distinct presence), and 3=severe (marked, intense).  In addition to LSRs, hypo- and hyper- pi[INVESTIGATOR_691734].  Application site reactions not classified as LSRs (eg, itching, 
burning, stinging, tenderness, pain) will be reported as AEs.  Standardized photography will be 
performed on Day [ADDRESS_938177] 
x Overdose of study medication 
x Pregnancy  
x Ocular exposures to study medication 
x Skin cancers (including BCC, SCC, and melanoma); the location and treatment will be 
reported. 
Assessments during the Recurrence Follow-up Period (up to [ADDRESS_938178]-Day 57) 
Efficacy Assessments  
A dermatologist (Investigator or Subinvestigator) will perform a count of clinically visible AK 
lesions (lesion count) for subjects who achieve 100% clearance of AK lesions in the treatment area at 
Day [ADDRESS_938179] 
x Skin cancers (including BCC, SCC, and melanoma) within the treatment area 
x Pregnancy 
Statistical Methods 
Efficacy: 
Primary Endpoint 
x Complete (100%) clearance rate of AK lesions, defined as the proportion of subjects at 
Day 57 with no clinically visible AK lesions in the treatment area  
Secondary Endpoints Key Secondary Endpoint: 
x Partial clearance rate of AK lesions, defined as the proportion of subjects at Day 57 with a 
75% reduction in the number of AK lesions identified at Baseline (Day 1 predose) in the 
treatment area  
Additional Endpoint: 
x Recurrence rate of AK lesions in subjects who achieved complete clearance at Day 57 
Safety: 
x Evaluation of LSRs, pi[INVESTIGATOR_691735], AEs, SAEs, events of 
special interest, clinical laboratory data, and other safety assessments (vital signs, PEs, 
ECGs) 
x AEs within the treatment area after Day [ADDRESS_938180]-Day 57  
Analysis Populations 
Intent-To-Treat (ITT) Population:  all randomized subjects. This is the primary efficacy population.  
Per-Protocol (PP)/Evaluable Population:   all randomized subjects who have received at least [ADDRESS_938181] efficacy, and returned for the final visit on Day 57.  
Safety Population :  all randomized subjects who have received at least one dose of study treatment. 
 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-004 
 
 
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 9 of 71 
 Recurrence Follow-up Population:   all subjects who achieved complete clearance at Day 57, 
regardless of which treatment they received. 
Efficacy Analyses 
To achieve statistical significance in the study, the Day 57 complete clearance rate will be analyzed 
using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) model cont rolling for treatment location and treatment 
group.  Before applying the CMH method, a Breslow-Da y test with a significance level of 10% will 
be used to explore heterogeneity of the odds ratios across treatment location subgroups. 
Further, the Pearson Chi Square (used to power the study) will be applied to demonstrate basic 
agreement with the CMH. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed with the ITT population, and will be repeated with 
the PP/Evaluable population to support the primary efficacy analysis results. 
Low enrollment sites will be pooled to analysis si tes with approximately 20 subjects in each pool. For 
example, the number of subjects enrolled will be graphically displayed by [CONTACT_691784] (face or scalp) from the smallest number to the largest, with bars depi[INVESTIGATOR_691736]. Then, analysis sites will be defined for approximately every [ADDRESS_938182] at a 
significance level of 10% will be applied. A finding of statistical significance in this test will be 
followed by [CONTACT_691785]. The outlier sites will be discussed and 
an exploratory analysis excluding the outlier sites may be carried out to estimate the impact of site-
by-treatment interactions. This process will be documented as an appendix to the final version of the 
SAP, prior to the first database lock. 
Partial clearance rate will be analyzed in the same way as the primary efficacy endpoint (complete 
clearance rate).  However, to control for multiplic ity, partial clearance rate as the key secondary 
efficacy endpoint will be examined using a step- down gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_691737] I error rate. In other words, the primary endpoint will serve as a gatekeeper for the key 
secondary endpoint. The complete clearance rate will be tested initially; if, and only if it is 
statistically significant at the 0.[ADDRESS_938183]-Day 57 
visit.  Subjects with missing AK assessments in the Recurrence Follow-up Period will be considered 
as censored.  
Safety Analyses 
For AEs, verbatim terms on the electronic case report form (eCRF) will be mapped to preferred terms 
(PTs) and system organ classes (SOCs) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA; v 16.0 or higher).   
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as either those AEs with an onset after the 
first dose or those pre-existing AEs that worsen after the first dose.  The incidence of TEAEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  TEAEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_78621].  By-subject listings of all SAEs and events of special interest will be provided.  
Laboratory parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics at baseline and at each 
subsequent timepoint by [CONTACT_1570].  Changes from baseline will also be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  In addition, shift tables (ie, low-normal-high at baseline versus low-normal-high at 
follow-up in a 3-by-3 contingency table) will be pr ovided to assess changes in laboratory values from

 baseline to Day 8 and baseline to Day 15 in each treatment group. 
LSR, hyper- or hypo-pi[INVESTIGATOR_691738] 57 will be 
displayed and summarized by [CONTACT_3232].   
Safety data collected through Day 57 and during the Recurrence Follow-up Period will be analyzed 
separately.  
Interim Analyses 
No interim analysis is planned for this study.  
Sample Size Rationale 
The sample size was estimated based on the primary efficacy endpoint for the comparison of 
KX2-391 Ointment 1% and vehicle control.  By [CONTACT_57971] g a Pearson Chi-square method, a sample size of 
100 scalp-treated subjects and 200 face- treated subjects, both of which are with a 1:1 treatment 
allocation ratio, will give a greater than 90% power to detect a 20% difference (30% for active 
treatment and 10% for vehicle control) with a two-tailed significant level 0.05.

2 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Background 
2.1.1 Indication 
In this study, the efficacy and safety of KX2-391 Ointment 1% will be evaluated in adult 
subjects with a diagnosis of clinically typi[INVESTIGATOR_547922] (AK) on the face or scalp. 
2.1.2 Mechanism of Action 
KX2-391 (referred to as KX01 in study protocol numbers) is a synthetic and highly selective 
inhibitor of Src tyrosine kinase signaling an d tubulin polymerization.  KX2-391 Ointment is 
being developed as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_565829].  KX2-391 is also being developed as an oral 
agent for oncology indications. 
KX2-391 promotes the induction of p53, G2/M arre st of proliferating cell populations and 
subsequent apoptosis via the s timulation of Caspase-3 and PARP cleavage.  Potent inhibition 
of the growth of primary human keratinocytes and several melanoma cell lines in vitro (50% 
growth inhibition [GI 50 YDOXHV@Q0VXJJHVWVWKDW.; -391 has the potential to inhibit 
the proliferative expansion and promote apoptos is of abnormally prolif erating cells in the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_691741].  KX2-391 has also been observed to 
inhibit T cell migration and endothelial tubule formation in vitro, suggesting additional 
potential therapeutic benefits for conditions where pathology is supported by [CONTACT_691788], inflammation, and/or angiogenesis. 
2.1.3 Nonclinical Studies 
Details regarding KX2-391 nonclinical studies  are provided in the KX2-391 Ointment 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
The bioavailability of KX2-391 after dermal administration to rats (1.59%) and rabbits 
(2.49% to 6.47%, depending on conc entration) was low.  Plasma  concentrations of KX2-[ADDRESS_938196] level (NOAEL) dose (1.2 5 mg/kg/dose) in a 28-day twice-daily oral 
toxicity study. Following 28 days of KX2- 391 topi[INVESTIGATOR_691742]_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-004 
 
  
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 20 of 71 
 
 (0.1%, 1%, and 2%) in rats and minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], an increase in KX2-391 plasma exposure was 
observed from Day 1 to Day 28, suggesting slight drug accumulation. 
In 28-day repeat-dose toxicology studies, KX2 -391 ointment was administered to rats and 
minipi[INVESTIGATOR_691743] 0.1%, 1%, and 2%. Ointment volumes of 2 mL/kg body weight 
were applied to approximately 10% of the body surface area of the skin. The administration 
sites were occluded with gauze a nd the applications left for 8 h/day in rats. The application 
site was semi-occluded for 20-22 hours in mi nipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. These doses contained 2, 20, or 
40 mg/kg KX2-391, respectively, e quivalent to 12, 120, or 240 mg/m2 in rats and 70, 700, or 
1400 mg/m2 in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. Systemic exposures on Day 28 to KX2-391 following daily 
application of 0.1% ointment were C max 22.9 ng/mL (male)/33.7 ng/mL (female) and 
AUC 0-24h 205 h*ng/mL (male)/216 h*ng/mL (female) in rats, and C max 2.03 ng/mL 
(male)/7.25 ng/mL (female), AUC 0-24h 37.4 h*ng/mL (male)/65.5 h*ng/mL (female) in 
minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. Exposure (AUC) in humans was not calculated due to the lack of quantifiable 
plasma concentrations following topi[INVESTIGATOR_691730]2-391 administration. However, the maximum 
Cmax value at the NOAEL in rats and minipi[INVESTIGATOR_691744] 24 and 5 times greater than 
the maximum plasma KX2-391 concentration of 1.42 ng/mL achieved in the clinic 
(Study KX01-AK-002). 
Other dermal toxicity studies with KX2- 391 showed that KX2-391 ointment may be 
sensitizing to the skin (Buehler assay and mu rine local lymph node assay), that KX2-391 
ointment was negative for phototoxicity, and that  KX2-391 ointment was an irritant to the 
eyes of rabbits after single application (effects cleared within [ADDRESS_938197] dose). 
KX2-391 was negative in a bacterial mutage nicity study (Ames test). KX2-391 caused 
chromosomal aberrations in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells at very high doses that are 
not likely to be clinically relevant. 
Studies of the effects of KX2-[ADDRESS_938198] been 
performed. In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, KX2-391 was 
administered orally in order to increase systemic exposure.  Embryo and fetal toxicity, LQFOXGLQJLPSODQWDWLRQORVVDQGIHWDOPDOIRUPDWLRQVRFFXUUHGD WRUDOGRVHVRIPJNJ
(rats) and 3 mg/kg (rabbits). The no-effect doses for fetal and reproductive effects were 
0.5 mg/kg (rats) and 1 mg/kg (rabbits ). At these doses, maternal C
max and AUC 0-8 h systemic 
exposures to KX2-391 were 25.4 ng/mL and 82.4 h*ng/mL (rats, Day 17) and 144 ng/mL 
and 251 h*ng/mL (rabbits, Day 18), respectivel y. Systemic plasma exposure (AUC) in 
humans could not be determined due to the lack of quantifiable plasma concentrations across 
multiple timepoints. However, maternal C max values at the NOAEL in rats and rabbits are 
approximately 18 and 1 00 times greater than the highes t KX2-391 plasma concentration 
achieved clinically of 1.42 ng/mL (Study KX01-AK-002).

 2.1.4 Clinical Experience with KX2-391 
[IP_ADDRESS] KX2-391 in Cancer (Oral) 
KX2-391 has been administered orally as a treatment for cancer to approximately 
120 patients with various types of malignancies in 4 clinical studies sponsored by [CONTACT_691789], 
Inc.  A summary of the safety information fro m these patients is provi ded in an appendix of 
the KX2-391 Ointment Investigator’s Brochure. 
Due to the differences in route of administra tion and short duration of  treatment (5 days), 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_691730]2-[ADDRESS_938199] the same toxicity 
profile as oral KX2-391. 
[IP_ADDRESS] KX2-391 as a Topi[INVESTIGATOR_691745], 2 clinical studies ha ve been conducted to evaluate  the activity and safety of 
KX2-391 Ointment 1% in subjects with AK. 
Study KX01-AK-01-US, a Phase 1, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic study, 
demonstrated that KX2-391 Ointment 1% was we ll-tolerated and showed clinical activity in 
[ADDRESS_938200] subjects experienced mild to moderate 
and transient local skin reactions (LSRs).  The majority of the LSRs observed were erythema 
and flaking/scaling that peaked around Day 5-10, before returning to or close to baseline.  
Symptoms of pruritus, stinging, and burning at the treatment area were generally mild and transient.  There were  no serious adverse events (SAEs) or deaths, and no subjects 
discontinued due to an adverse event (AE). 
Study KX01-AK-002 , an ongoing Phase 2a, open-label, sequential group study, evaluated 
the activity and safety of KX2-391 Ointment 1% when applied daily in a treatment area of 
25 cm
2 for 3 consecutive days (n=84 subjects) or 5 consecutive days (n=84 subjects) in adults 
with AK on face or scalp.  Preliminary data showed that most of the 168 subjects treated had mild to moderate LSRs (primarily erythema an d flaking/scaling.  Eleven (6.5%) subjects had 
16 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) considered treatment-related by [CONTACT_737].  Eight of these subjects had mild application site reactions including pruritus, tenderness, or stinging.  The remaining AEs considered by [CONTACT_300338]-related were mild headache, mild to moderate dizziness, mild arthralgia, or mild darkening of hair color near the treatment area.  All treatment-related TEAEs resolved prior to or stabilized by [CONTACT_2006] 57.  Four subjects reported [ADDRESS_938201] discontinued treatment due to AEs. 
Thirty-six of 84 subjects (43%) in the 5-day regimen and 27 of 84 subjects (32%) in the 
3-day regimen had 100% clearance of AK lesions in the treatment area on Day 57. 
Plasma concentrations of KX2-391 were meas ured in Study KX01-AK-002 using a validated 
liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay with a lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) of 0.1 ng/mL.  Pharmaco kinetic results showed that following 3 or 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-004

 5 consecutive days of treatment with KX2 -391 Ointment 1%, low systemic exposure 
(< 2 ng/mL) and limited drug accumulation were observed. 
Details of both studies are available in the KX2-391 Ointment Investigator’s Brochure. 
2.2 Study Rationale 
Actinic keratosis represents  the initial intra-epi[INVESTIGATOR_691746] (SCC).  
Squamous cell carcinoma is the second leading ca use of skin cancer deaths in the US, with 
up to 65% of SCC arising from pre-existing actinic keratoses .1,2  The risk of progression has 
been determined to be be tween 0.025% and 16% per year,1,3 and the calculated lifetime risk 
of malignant transformation for a patient w ith AK lesions followed up for 10 years is 
between 6.1% and 10.2%.[ADDRESS_938202] cosmetic outcomes. 
2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits 
Preliminary results of studies KX01-AK-01- US and KX01-AK-002 indicate that KX2-391 
Ointment 1% administered once daily for up to [ADDRESS_938203] th at the 5-day regimen of KX2-391 Ointment 
1% has greater activity (43%) than the 3-day regimen (32%). 
Preliminary safety results from both studies show ed that KX2-391 Ointment 1% is safe and 
well tolerated.  Even though LSRs (primarily erythema and/or flaking/scaling) were reported by [CONTACT_691790], they were generally mild or moderate in severity and mostly transient.  The treatment-related TEAEs that subjects experienced mainly consisted of mild application site reactions such as itching, burning, stinging, tenderness, and pain.  No subjects discontinued treatment due to AEs and no treatment-rela ted SAEs were reported.  
Based on these findings, the clinical benefit of treating actinic keratosis, a precancerous condition, with a short course of topi[INVESTIGATOR_691730]2-[ADDRESS_938204] 90 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056].

4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a double-blind, vehicle-controlled, ra ndomized, parallel group, multicenter study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of KX2-391 Ointment 1% administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_691747]. 
Enrollment will be controlled so that approximately two thirds of subjects enrolled will be 
treated on the face and approximately one third of subjects enrolled will be treated on the 
scalp.  A sufficient number of subjects w ill be screened to ra ndomize approximately 
300 subjects.  At each site, a minimum of 10 subjects and a maximum of 20 subjects are 
projected to be enrolled. 
The study consists of Screening, Trea tment, a Response Assessment Period, and a 
Recurrence Follow-up Period.  After a Screening Period of up to 28 days, subjects will return 
to the site for confirmation of eligibility.  Eligible subjects will be randomized on Day 1 to treatment in a 1:1 (KX2-391 Ointment 1% or ve hicle) ratio in each treatment area subgroup. 
The treatment area will be marked with indelible  marker at Baseline (Day 1 predose) at the 
investigational site.  Subjects will be given verbal and written instructions on self-administration of study drug/vehicle and a stud y kit containing [ADDRESS_938208] unresolved LSRs, hypo - or hyper- pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], scarring in the 
treatment area, or treatment-related AEs at Da y 57 will return for additional follow-up, which 
includes standardized photography of the trea tment area, every 7 to 28 days until resolution, 
returned to baseline, or deemed stabilized by [CONTACT_32366]. 
Subjects who achieve 100% clearance of AK lesi ons in the treatment area at Day 57 will 
continue in the Recurrence Follow-up Period to determine recurrence rate and safety for up to 12 months following the Day 57 Visit.  Visits during the Recurrence Follow-up Period will occur every 3 months.  Subjects who develop AK  lesions in the treatment area during the 
Recurrence Follow-up Period will be discontinued at the time of recurrence.

4.6 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Dosing and 
Control Groups 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-bli nd, vehicle-controlled, parallel group, efficacy 
and safety study of KX2-391 Ointment 1% admin istered topi[INVESTIGATOR_691748] 5 consecutive days.   
The dosing regimen for this study is base d on the Phase 2a study (KX01-AK-002).  
KX01-AK-002 is an open-label,  sequential group, non-randomiz ed, multi-center study that 
evaluated the dosing regimen of daily dosing fo r either 3 or 5 consecutive days of KX2-391 
Ointment 1% on a treatment area of 25 cm2 on the face or scalp that contained 4 to 8 AK 
lesions in 168 adults ([ADDRESS_938211] s per cohort).  Preliminary analyses showed that a higher 
percentage of subjects achieved complete clearance of AK on Day 57 for the 5-day treatment group (43%) than the 3-day treatment group (32 %).  For both the 5-day and 3-day treatment 
groups, KX2-391 Ointment 1% was found to be safe, well tolerated a nd minimally absorbed 
throughout treatment and follow up for both cohorts .  Thus, these data support the evaluation

6.2.2 Criteria for Interruption of Treatment/Dose Adjustments 
Not applicable; dose adjustment is not allowed. 
6.3 Randomization/Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment 
Groups 
Enrollment will be controlled so that approximately two thirds of subjects enrolled will be 
treated on the face and approximately one third of subjects enrolled will be treated on the 
scalp.  Eligible subjects will be randomized to treatment in a 1:1 (KX2-391 Ointment 1% or 
vehicle) ratio in each treatment area subgroup. 
Subjects will be assigned to treatments in a double-blinded manner based on a computer-
generated randomization scheme.  Based on the randomization scheme, 2 lists of enrollment numbers will be issued to each site; one list will be for subjects with the treatment area on the face and the other list will be for subjects with  the treatment area on the scalp.  Study kits 
bearing corresponding enrollment numbers will be pr ovided to the site.  One set of kits will 
be provided for subjects with the treatment area on the face and the second set of kits will be provided for subjects with the treatment area on the scalp. 
Enrollment numbers and study kits are distributed sequentially.  The first eligible subject 
with AK lesion on the face will be assigned the first enrollment number for treatment of the face and given a study kit bearing the same enrollment number on Day [ADDRESS_938220] research organizations (CROs) involved in  the clinical conduct of the 
study, the Investigators, study site personnel  and study subjects will be blinded to the 
treatment that is assigned to each subject.  The integrity of this clinical study must be maintained by [CONTACT_58956].  See Section 8.2.5 for breaking the blind.

 The Investigator or Subinvestigator may use the transparency and/or photograph from Baseline 
to locate the treatment area.  AK lesion counts from previous visits should not be used to assist in the assessment of AK lesion count at the current visit.  Only AK lesions completely within the treatment area will be counted. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_938236]. 
At each study visit, subjects will be asked a ge neral question “How have you been since the 
last visit?”.  Adverse events will be recorded at each study visit, before assessment of LSRs, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and scarring in the treatment area.   Adverse events will be reported separately 
from LSRs. 
Safety assessments will also include vital signs, the performance of PEs, ECGs, laboratory 
evaluation of hematology, bioche mistry, and urinalyses, as detailed in the sections below. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
All AEs will be assessed periodically through Day 57 ( Table 1 ). 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered an investigationa l product.  An AE does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the medicinal product.  Fo r this study, the study drugs are KX2-391 
Ointment 1% and vehicle ointment. 
The criteria for identifying AEs in this study are: 
x Any unfavorable and unintended sign (inc luding an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, 
whether or not considered relate d to the investigational product  
x Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease 
x Any deterioration in non-protoc ol-required measurements of a laboratory value or other 
clinical test (eg, ECG or x-ray) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, or discontinuation of study drug 
x Recurrence of an intermittent medical conditi on (eg, headache) not present pretreatment 
(Baseline) 
All AEs, regardless of relationship to study dr ug or procedure, should be collected beginning 
from the time the subject signs the study ICF through the final subject contact [CONTACT_307257].  Subjects who have unresolved LSRs, hypo- or hy per-pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], scarri ng in the treatment

 area, or treatment-related AEs at Day 57 will return for additional follow-up every 
7 to 28 days until resolution, returned to baseline,  or deemed stabilized by [CONTACT_32366]. 
Subjects who fail screening primarily due to AE(s) must have the AE(s) recorded in the AE 
eCRF and screen failure  reported on the eCRF. 
Subjects with onset of a study treatment-rel ated AEs will be followed until resolution, under 
medical care, or deemed stabilized by [CONTACT_737].  All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization. 
All AEs observed during the study will be reported on the eCRF. 
Laboratory Adverse Events 
A treatment-emergent abnor mal laboratory test result should be considered as a TEAE if the 
identified laboratory abnormality leads to any type of intervention whether prescribed in the protocol or not. 
An abnormal laboratory result shoul d be considered by [CONTACT_548014]: 
x Results in the withdrawal of study drug 
x Results in an intervention, based on medical  evaluation (eg, potassium supplement for 
hypokalemia) 
x Results in any out-of-range laboratory value that in the Investigator’s judgment fulfills 
the definitions of an AE with rega rd to the subject’s medical profile 
Abnormal laboratory values should not  be listed as separate AEs if  they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndrome that is being repo rted as an AE.  It is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to review all laboratory findings in all subjects and determine if they constitute an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated 
laboratory abnormality should be classified  as an AE.  Any laboratory abnormality 
considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Electrocardiogram Changes 
Any changes from the baseline ECG will be evaluated for clinical significance.  ECG 
changes that are determined to be clinically significant, regardless of relationship, will be reported as an AE. 
For symptomatic ECG abnormalities meeting criteria as SAEs, the study site must submit an 
SAE report, including the ECG report to the Sponsor or designee, using the SAE reporting 
procedures ( Section 8.1 ).

 [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_938237] be made by [CONTACT_691795]. 
Adverse events will be graded on a 3-point scale (mild, moderate, severe) and reported in 
detail indicated on the eCRF.  The definitions are as follows: 
Mild Discomfort noticed, but no di sruption of normal daily activity 
Moderate Discomfort sufficient to re duce or affect normal daily activity 
Severe  Incapacitating, with inability to work or to perform normal daily activity The criteria for assessing severity are differe nt than those used for seriousness (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] for the definition of an SAE). 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_938238] be made by [CONTACT_691796]. 
Items to be considered when assessing the rela tionship of an AE to the study treatment are: 
x Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment  
x The course of the event, especially the eff ect of discontinuation of study treatment or 
reintroduction of study tr eatment, as applicable  
x Whether the event is known to be associated with the study treatment or with other 
similar treatments  
x The presence of risk factors in the study subject known to increase the occurrence of the 
event  
x The presence of non-treatment-related factors th at are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event.  
Classification of Causality 
The relationship of each AE to the study drug will be recorded on the eCRF using the 
following criteria: 
Definitely Related:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to drug adminis tration, and which cannot be explained by 
[CONTACT_691797] e or other drugs or conditions 
Probably Related:   A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent or underlying disease or other drugs or conditions  
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-004 
 
  
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 44 of 71 
 
 Possibly Related:   A clinical event, including laborato ry test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_691798]:   The AE is clearly not related to inves tigational product and is  clearly related to 
underlying disease, environmental or toxi c factor(s), or other drug therapy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs will be asse ssed during the Treatment and Re sponse Assessment Periods, on 
Days 1, 5, 8, 15, 29, and 57 ( Table 1 ). 
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
x Results in death 
x Is life-threatening (ie, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred; this does not include an event that , had it occurred in a more severe form or 
was allowed to continue, might have caused death) 
x Requires inpatient hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
x Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the 
study drug) 
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], when based on ap propriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require intervention to prev ent one of the outcomes in the definition of 
SAE listed above should also be considered SAEs.  Medical a nd scientific judgment should 
be exercised in deciding whether expedited re porting is appropriate in such situations.  
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Events of Special Interest 
All events of special interest will be assesse d during the Treatment and Response Assessment 
Periods, on Days 1, 5, 8, 15, 29, and 57 ( Table 1 ). 
In addition to the AEs and SAEs described a bove, events of special interest are to be 
captured and reported in the appr opriate eCRF and Events of Special Interest Forms (see 
Section 8.2 ).  Events of special interest will be consid ered as SAEs if they meet the criteria 
for an SAE ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]) . 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment [ADDRESS_938239] during the Treatment  and Response Assessment Periods (Days 1 to 
57) are as follows: 
x Overdose of study medication  
x Pregnancy  
x Ocular exposures to study medication 
x Skin cancers (including BCC, SCC, and melanoma); location and treatment will be 
reported.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications will be assessed during the Treatme nt and Response Assessment 
Periods, on Days 1, 5, 8, 15, 29, and 57 ( Table 1 ).  Any medication (including 
nonprescription medications) or therapy administere d to the subject during the course of the 
study (starting at the date of informed consent) will be recorded on the Concomitant Medication eCRF up to Day 57.  The Investigator  will record any AE on the Adverse Event 
eCRF for which the concomitant medication/therapy was administered. 
Use of sunblock from Day [ADDRESS_938240] or any to pi[INVESTIGATOR_691764] 57. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Focused Dermatological Exam of Treatment Area and Standard Photography 
The focused dermatological exam of the treatment area includes evaluation of LSRs, pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and scarring (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 and Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 , respectively). 
Standardized photography will be performed at the Response Assessment Visits (Days 5, 8, 
15, 29, and 57) and at additional follow-up vi sits after Day [ADDRESS_938241] 
unresolved LSRs, hypo- or hyper- pi[INVESTIGATOR_386078], or scarring in the treatment area ( Table 1 ).

[IP_ADDRESS].1 L OCAL SKIN REACTIONS  
After the assessment of AEs at the Response Assessment Visits (Days 5, 8, 15, 29, and 57) 
(Table 1 ), the Investigator or Subinvestigator will assess for LSRs in the treatment area.  See 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for details.  The same Investigator  or Subinvestigator  will conduct the LSR 
assessment at all visits for an individual subject. 
All application site reactions and LSRs will be followed to re solution, or if resolution is 
unlikely, to stabilization. 
Treatment for any LSR will be recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF.  
Interruption/discontinuation of study treatment for an LSR will be recorded on the eCRF.

Hypo- and hyper-pi[INVESTIGATOR_691765] e treatment area will be assessed at the 
Response Assessment Visits (Days 5, 8, 15, 29, and 57) ( Table 1 ).  See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details.  The same Investigator or Subinvestigator will assess pi[INVESTIGATOR_691766]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examinations  
A complete PE will be performed on Day 57 ( Table 1 ) and will include weight and an 
assessment of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT), integumentary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], musculoskeletal, and neurological systems.  
Height will be measured at Screening only. 
Documentation of the PE will be included in the source documentation at the site(s).  
Changes from screening PE to findings at the last visit that meet the definition of an AE will be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs 
Vital signs will also be recorded at the Response Assessment Visits on Days 5 and 57 
(Table 1 ).  Vital sign (pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pr essure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and 
body temperature) measurements will be taken after the subject has been seated for at least 5 minutes.  Serial vital signs may be obtained to confirm accurate readings. 
Clinically significant abnormal vital signs, as assessed by [CONTACT_737], will be reported as 
adverse events. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiograms 
Electrocardiograms will be obtained at the Re sponse Assessment Visits on Days 5 and 15 
(Table 1 ).  See Section 7.1.11  for details. 
Any ECG abnormality that the Investigator consider s as an AE should be recorded as such on 
the Adverse Event eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory Measurements 
Blood will be collected for clinical laboratory tests at Response Assessment Visits on Days 8 and 15 ( Table 1 ).  Collection of blood and urine (including samples for pregnancy 
testing, where applicable) will be conducted at the clinic site.  Approximately [ADDRESS_938242] during the study.  All sample s will be sent to a 
central laboratory for testing.

 Microscopic urinalysis will be conducted only when clinically indicated based on dipstick 
results (laboratory protocol) or as deter mined by [CONTACT_737].  When conducted, 
microscopic urinalysis results will be recorded on the eCRF. 
The clinical laboratory tests to be measur ed during the study are provided in Table 3.  
Table 3 Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Category Parameters 
Hematology red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, and white 
blood cells (WBC) with differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils 
Chemistry  
 Electrolytes chloride, potassium, sodium, bicarbonate (HCO 3) 
 Liver function tests alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), direct bilirubin, total bilirubin 
 Renal function tests blood urea/blood urea nitrogen, creatinine 
 Other Albumin, calcium, cholesterol, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 
phosphorus, total protein, triglycerides, uric acid 
Urinalysis (dipstick) hydrogen ion concentration (pH), specific gravity, protein, glucose, 
ketones, leukocyte esterase, nitrite, bilirubin, urobilinogen, blood 
Pregnancy Testing serum pregnancy test or urine pregnancy test (see  Table 1 ) 
 
A laboratory abnormality may meet the criteria to qualify as an AE as described in this 
protocol (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  In these instances, the AE corresponding to the laboratory 
abnormality will be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
For laboratory abnormalities meeting the criteria of SAEs (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), the site must 
report the SAE, including the laboratory report (as regionally required), to the Sponsor using 
the SAE form (see Section 8.1 ). 
7.3.[ADDRESS_938243] will be performed on Day 57/early termination at the clinical site ( Table 1 ).  Serum samples will be sent to a central laboratory 
for testing. 
7.[ADDRESS_938244] (Investigator or Subinvestigator) will perform a count of clinically visible AK 
lesions (lesion count) for subjects who achieve 100% clearance of AK lesions in the treatment area at Day 57 during the Recurrence Follow-up Period at the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month visits (Table 1 ).  The Investigator or Subinvestigator performing the lesion count should be the 
same Investigator or Subinvestigator who eval uated the subject previously during the study. 
An AK lesion should be counted if it is within the treatment area.  All AK lesions within the 
treatment area must be counted and recorded in the eCRF as an AK recurrence. 
When AK lesions are identified in the treatment area, the transparency which was used to 
map the AK lesions at Baseline should be used to  determine if the lesion(s) is new (ie, one 
which was not identified in the target treatment area at Baseline and emergent during the Recurrence Follow-up Period) or recurred (ie, one which is at the same AK lesion location 
identified at Baseline and resolved at Day 57). 
For subjects who have complete response at Day [ADDRESS_938245] their Final Visit at the visit when the AK recurrence is identified.  Subjects who develop 
AK lesions in the treatment area during the Recurrence Follow-up Period will be discontinued at the time of recurrence. 
7.5.2 Safety Assessments 
During the Recurrence Follow-up Period, safety assessments will include the monitoring and 
recording of AEs and SAEs within the treatment  area at the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month visits 
(Table 1 ).  See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for further information on the assessments of AEs.   
Concomitant medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_691767]/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_691768]-up Period at the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month visits ( Table 1 ) and will be recorded on the Concomitant 
Medication eCRF.  The Investigator will record any AE within the treatment area on the Adverse Event eCRF for which the concomitant medication/therapy was administered. 
Events of special interest during the Recurrence Follow-up Period include skin cancers 
(including BCC, SCC, melanoma) within the tr eatment area and pregnancy.  Information on 
skin cancers will be collected during the Recurrence Follow-up Period at the 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month visits and reported as an event of sp ecial interest and as an AE in the Adverse 
Event eCRF (see  Section 8.2.4 ). 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment [ADDRESS_938246] (overdos e of study medication, 
pregnancy, ocular exposure to study medication, and skin cancers [including BCC, SCC, and 
melanoma]) are to be reported to the Sponsor within 1 business day of the Investigator becoming aware of the event.  Specific forms for reporting each type of event will be provided to the sites. 
The Sponsor (or its designee) must inform Investigators and regu latory authorities of 
reportable events, in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, on an expedited basis (ie, within specific timeframes).  For this reason, it is imperative that sites provide complete SAE and events of special interest  information in the manner described below. 
In determining what SAEs meet criteria for expedited reporting, the current version of the 
KX2-391 Ointment Investigator’s Brochure will be  used as the referenc e safety information 
for KX2-391 Ointment 1%.

 Any SAE event judged by [CONTACT_449129] (definitely, probably, or possibly 
related) to study treatment shoul d be reported to the Sponsor re gardless of the length of time 
that has passed since study completion.  
Deaths and life-threatening events should be reported immediately by [CONTACT_756].  The 
initial report must be submitted within 1 business day by [CONTACT_691799].  
It is very important that the SAE Report Form be filled out as completely as possible at the 
time of the initial report.  This includes the Investigator’s assessment of causality.  All supporting documents should be se nt de-identified and should c ontain the subject’s assigned 
enrollment number.  Only supporting documents di rectly related to the event should be sent. 
Any follow-up information received on SAEs should be forwarded as soon as possible.  If the 
follow-up information changes the Investigator’s assessment of causality, this should also be 
noted on the follow-up SAE form. 
Preliminary SAE reports should be followed as soon as possible by [CONTACT_691800][INVESTIGATOR_691769], autopsy reports, and other documents 
requested by [CONTACT_1034]. 
8.[ADDRESS_938248] be repor ted; pregnancies in female partners of male subjects for 
which the estimated date of conception was within [ADDRESS_938249] information for the reporting of 
pregnancies is provided in  the Investigator File. 
If an adverse outcome of a pregnancy is suspected to be related to study drug exposure, this 
should be reported regardless of the length of time that has pa ssed since the exposure to study 
treatment. 
A congenital anomaly, death dur ing perinatal period, an induced  abortion, or a spontaneous 
abortion are considered to be SAEs and should be reported in the same  timeframe and in the 
same format as all other SAEs (see  Section 8.1 ). 
All pregnancies must be followed to outcome .  The outcome of the pregnancy must be 
reported as soon as possible but no later than [ADDRESS_938250]’s assessment must be provided as a follow-up on the Ocular Exposure Report Form.  The 
contact [CONTACT_691801].   
Ocular exposure to study medication must be captured on the appropriate eCRF.  If the 
ocular exposure is associated with an AE, th e AE must be captured on the Ocular Exposure 
Report Form and the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the ocular exposure  is associated with an SAE, 
an SAE Report Form should be completed and sent along with Ocular Exposure Report 
Form. 
8.2.4 Skin Cancer 
During the Treatment and Response Assessmen t Periods (Days 1 to 57), all skin cancers 
(including BCC, SCC, and melanoma) will be reported as events of special interest.  The

 location and treatment will be reported.  During the Recurrence Follow-up Period, skin 
cancers (including BCC, SCC, and melanoma) within the treatment area will be reported as events of special interest.  The treatment  of the skin cancer will be reported. 
The Skin Cancer Report Form must be used for reporting.  The skin cancer must be reported 
by [CONTACT_691802] [ADDRESS_938251]’s treatment  allocation for this study.  The Investigator 
may request to unblind the treatment assignment of any subject when this is needed for proper medical management of a medical emerge ncy or SAE.  Agreement of the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor or designee should be sought  prior to unblinding.  Instructions for 
requesting unblinding of a subject will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
The Pharmacovigilance departme nt may unblind individual cases when required for safety 
reporting.  The treatment assignment will be included on the MedWatch or CIOMS form for suspected unexpected serious adverse reac tion (S[LOCATION_003]R) reports provided to health 
authorities.
 
[ADDRESS_938252] resolved, returned to baseline, or 
been deemed stabilized by [CONTACT_32366], the data collected before the Recurrence Follow-up Period will be locked and the randomization c ode will be released to the Sponsor only.  
The endpoint analyses, except for the recurrence  rate and AEs in the treatment area after 
Day 57, will be performed. 
For the second step, after the entire study has been completed, the data collected during the 
Recurrence Follow-up Period will be locked and th e randomization code wi ll be released to

 the study sites as well.  Then, the recurrence rate and AEs in the treatment area after Day 57 
will be analyzed. 
Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS software or other validated statistical 
software as required.  The statisti cal analyses of the study data are described in this section.  
Further details of the statistical analyses will be included in a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be written and signed off prior to unblinding of Day [ADDRESS_938253] dose of study treatment.

9.1.6 Efficacy Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis 
To achieve statistical significance in the study, the Day 57 complete clearance rate will be 
analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) model controlling for treatment location and treatment group.  Before applying th e CMH method, a Breslow-Day test with a 
significance level of 10% will be used to ex plore heterogeneity of the odds ratios across 
treatment location subgroups. 
Clinical Study Protocol_Amendment 01 KX01-AK-004 
 
  
Athenex, Inc. 
FINAL v2.0_18 Feb 2018 Confidential Page 55 of 71 
 
 Further, the Pearson Chi Square (used to power the study) will be applied to demonstrate 
basic agreement with the CMH. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed with the ITT population, and will be 
repeated with the PP/Evaluable population to s upport the primary efficacy analysis results. 
Low enrollment sites will be pooled to analysis s ites with approximately 20 subjects in each 
pool. For example, the number of  subjects enrolled will be graphically displayed by [CONTACT_691804] (face or scalp) from the smallest number to the largest, with bars depi[INVESTIGATOR_691773]. Then, analysis sites will be defined for approximately every [ADDRESS_938258] at a 
significance level of 10% will be applied. A finding of statistical significance in this test will be followed by [CONTACT_691785]. 
The outlier sites will be discussed and an exploratory analysis excluding the outlier sites may 
be carried out to estimate the impact of site-by-treatment interactions. This process will be documented as an appendix to the final version of the SAP, prior to the first database lock. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses 
Partial clearance rate will be analyzed in th e same way as the primary efficacy endpoint 
(complete clearance rate).  However, to control for multiplicity, partial clearance rate as the key secondary efficacy endpoint will be exa mined using a step-down gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_691774] I error rate. In other words, the primary endpoint will serve as a gatekeeper for the key secondary endpoint. Th e complete clearance rate will be tested 
initially; if, and only if it is statistically sign ificant at the 0.[ADDRESS_938259]-
Day 57 visit.  Subjects with missing AK assessments in the Recurrence Follow-up Period will be considered as censored. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Additional AK Lesion Count Analysis 
The number of AK lesions and the change from baseline in lesion count at each visit will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics (ie, mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum) by [CONTACT_662193] (face or scalp) a nd treatment group for the ITT population.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Missing Data Handling and Sensitivity Analysis 
For the primary and the key secondary efficacy endpoint analyses, all missing data caused by 
[CONTACT_691805] a last observation carried forward (LOCF) method.  
In addition, the following approaches will be us ed as sensitivity analyses for the primary and 
key secondary efficacy endpoints: 
1. Observed Cases (OC): Those subjects with missing AK lesion counts at Day 57 visit will 
be excluded from the analysis populations (ITT and PP/Evaluable) and then the primary and 
key secondary endpoint analyses described above  will be repeated to show concordance. 
2. Subjects without Day 57 AK lesion counts due to  early termination or other reasons will 
be considered as non-responders for comp lete/partial clearance rate analysis  
3. Multiple Imputation (MI): A multiple imput ation method may be applied to impute 
missing values (only for the primary an d key secondary efficacy variables). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Subgroup Analysis 
To indicate concordance with the overall results , the primary and the key secondary efficacy 
endpoints will be tabulated and di splayed graphically in subgroups such as treatment location

 [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events 
For AEs, verbatim terms on the eCRF will be mapped to preferred terms (PTs) and system 
organ classes (SOCs) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (version 16.0 or higher). 
All AEs, treatment-emergent or otherwise, will be presented in subject data listings.  Only 
those AEs that are treatment-emergent will be included in summary tables.   
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as: 
x either those AEs with an onset after the first dose or  
x those pre-existing AEs that worsen after the first dose. 
TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  The incidence of TEAEs  will be reported as 
the number (percentage) of subjects with TE AEs by [CONTACT_12130] a nd PT and treatment 
group.  A subject will be counted only once within an SOC and PT, even if the subject experienced more than 1 TEAE within a specific SOC and PT.  The number (percentage) of subjects with TEAEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_764] (by [CONTACT_691806], moderate or severe rating) a nd by [CONTACT_691807].  Treatment-related TEAEs 
include those events considered by [CONTACT_691808] (definitely, probably, or 
possibly related) to study treatment. 
By-subject listings of all SAEs and events of special interest will be provided.  If any deaths 
occur in the study, a by-subject listing of all AEs leading to death will be provided. 
A subject data listing of all AEs leading to discontinuation from the study will be provided. For subjects who have treatment-related AEs at Day 57, all safety endpoints observed during 
any additional follow-up assessments will be listed. 
During the Recurrence Follow-up Period, TEAEs in the treatment area will be summarized 
separately. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory Values 
Laboratory parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics at baseline and at each subsequent timepoint by [CONTACT_12922].  Changes from baseline will also be summarized 
by [CONTACT_1570].   
In addition, shift tables (ie, lo w-normal-high at baseline versus  low-normal-high at follow-up 
in a 3-by-3 contingency table) will be provided to assess changes in laboratory values from baseline to Day [ADDRESS_938260].

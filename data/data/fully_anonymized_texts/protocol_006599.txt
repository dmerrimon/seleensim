1 PROTOCOL SUMMARY
1.1 SYNOPSIS 
Title: Adding Trauma-focused Psychotherapy to Ketamine Treatment for Chronic 
PTSD: A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_809490]: Current treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) do not work 
for a significant proportion of individuals with PTSD, or work only partially, 
leaving persistent and disabling residual symptoms. Our research team has 
led the development of ketamine for the treatment of chronic PTSD. After 
our initial, proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a single 
ketamine infusion in individuals with chronic PTSD showed promising 
results, we completed the first RCT of repeated intravenous ketamine 
infusions where individuals with chronic PTSD received a course of six 
ketamine infusions (vs. active placebo midazolam infusions) and 
demonstrated a rapid and robust improvement in PTSD symptoms. The 
median time to loss of response, however, was 27.5 days following the 
course of infusions, making it imperative to investigate novel approaches 
aimed at preventing symptom relapse following ketamine treatment. We 
thus propose a proof-of-concept, open-label pi[INVESTIGATOR_809491]-based, brief and scalable trauma-focused 
psychotherapy, Written Exposure Therapy (WET), to a course of ketamine 
infusions in maintaining PTSD symptom improvement over time, in

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017 2participants with chronic PTSD.. To accomplish this aim, we will enroll 
individuals who meet DSM-5 criteria for chronic PTSD. 
Eligible patients will receive a total of 6 ketamine infusions and 5 WET 
sessions. The primary outcome will be change in PTSD symptom severity 
assessed by [CONTACT_138208]-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) 
from baseline (before the first infusion) to 12 weeks from the start of WET. 
All participants will be assessed until week 12 following the start of WET. 
They will complete weekly assessments from baseline until 6 weeks from 
the start of WET, as well as assessments at 12 weeks from the start of 
WET. At other time points between 6 and 12 weeks, participants will be 
assessed weekly, or less frequently as tolerated. 
Although initial response to ketamine (PTSD and co-morbid depressive 
symptom improvement) will be assessed after the first four infusions 
(prior to starting WET), all participants will receive 6 infusions and 5 WET 
sessions regardless of their initial response to ketamine.
Participants will be asked not to make any changes to any concomitant 
treatment (i.e., medication dosages, psychotherapy) during this period.
Thereafter, participants who remain improved at the 12-week time point 
(compared to baseline) will then receive additional monthly assessments 
up to 24 weeks or until loss of this improvement.
We will also evaluate whether extinction learning ability –assessed with a 
computerized extinction learning task– is associated with PTSD symptom 
improvement from baseline to 12 weeks from the start of WET. If 
demonstrated to result in significant and maintained PTSD symptom 
improvement, this novel combined treatment may represent a promising 
intervention for individuals with chronic PTSD, deserving further study.
Objectives: Primary Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of adding WET to ketamine 
therapy in improving PTSD symptoms from baseline to 12 weeks from the 
start of WET,  in individuals with chronic PTSD . 
Secondary Objectives (exploratory): (1) To evaluate improvement in PTSD 
symptoms from baseline to 6 weeks, and on other measures from baseline 
to 6 weeks, and from baseline to 12 weeks; (2) To evaluate durability of 
PTSD symptom improvement beyond 12 weeks in patients who remain 
improved, up to 24 weeks; (3) To evaluate whether ketamine-induced 
change in extinction learning is associated with improvement in PTSD 
symptoms from baseline to 12 weeks from the start of WET.
Endpoints: Primary Endpoint: Change in PTSD symptom severity assessed by [CONTACT_597134]-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) from baseline to 12

2.1 STUDY RATIONALE 
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and disabling condition. Trauma-focused 
psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_809492]. Access to these specialized forms of 
therapy, however, is often limited by [CONTACT_809538], economic, and time-commitment barriers, as well as 
need for extensive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_73775]. Additionally, 25-40% of patients drop out of treatment 
prematurely. There is thus a strong need to develop more efficacious and scalable treatments for PTSD. 
Recent evidence from our research group showed efficacy of repeated intravenous (IV) infusions of 
ketamine at sub-anesthetic doses (0.5 mg/kg) in rapi[INVESTIGATOR_809493], as well as co-morbid depressive symptoms. However, these effects are time-limited, with

session evidence-based written trauma-focused therapy without in between-session assignments, with 
demonstrated efficacy and low dropout rates in patients with PTSD. WET will be administered to 
participants starting after they receive four initial ketamine infusions; the first WET sessions will be 
interleaved with two additional ketamine infusions to take advantage of a window of increased 
neuroplasticity potentially induced by [CONTACT_809539]. WET be administered on different 
days as the ketamine infusions.
2.2 BACKGROUND 
1. SIGNIFICANCE 
Chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder.1,[ADDRESS_1119385] been published to date, including only one in individuals with PTSD (n=10).11-[ADDRESS_1119386] of which we are aware to evaluate the efficacy of adding a trauma-
focused psychotherapy, Written Exposure Therapy (WET), to a course of ketamine infusions in maintaining 
ketamine response over time in individuals with chronic PTSD who demonstrate a rapid and clinically 
significant response to initial ketamine infusions. If demonstrated to be efficacious, this novel combined 
treatment may represent a promising intervention worthy of additional study for the broader population 
of individuals with chronic PTSD.
1.A. Chronic PTSD and insufficient efficacy of currently available treatments. Only two medications 
[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) sertraline and paroxetine] are FDA-approved for the 
treatment of PTSD, with two additional medications showing moderate-level efficacy. Only about one 
third of individuals with PTSD achieve remission with SSRIs, with another third showing symptom 
improvement; thus, about two thirds of patients are either treatment non-responders or partial 
responders.3,5,[ADDRESS_1119387] training and significant time commitment on the part 
of patients; these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_809494]-response and treatment 
dropout.15,[ADDRESS_1119388] led the development of ketamine as a novel treatment for chronic PTSD. Ketamine, a 
noncompetitive glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, was first FDA-approved as 
an anesthetic and analgesic agent several decades ago.7 Following initial evidence of its efficacy for 
treatment-resistant depression (TRD),[ADDRESS_1119389] of a single IV infusion 
of ketamine in individuals with chronic PTSD (compared to the psychoactive placebo midazolam), showing 
rapid and significantly greater improvement following ketamine administration.[ADDRESS_1119390] of 
repeated IV ketamine infusions for chronic PTSD, compared to repeated midazolam infusions, 
demonstrating significantly greater efficacy of ketamine (67% treatment responders in the ketamine

administered over two consecutive weeks.[ADDRESS_1119391] demonstrated that chronic stress is associated with atrophy of dendrites and 
synaptic loss in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), resulting in dysfunction of 
glutamatergic transmission.20,21 It has been proposed that recurrent intrusions of trauma memories 
experienced by [CONTACT_809540] a form of chronic stress, in turn associated with 
maintenance and worsening of disrupted synaptic connectivity and abnormalities in glutamatergic 
transmission, increasingly understood as key biological abnormalities underlying the pathophysiology of 
PTSD.22,23 
1.C.2. Fear extinction abnormalities in chronic PTSD. Alterations in fear processing and regulation 
characterize PTSD and are thought to contribute to the persistence of PTSD symptoms.24 Key among these 
alterations is impaired fear extinction learning, assessed by [CONTACT_809541] a conditioned stimulus 
without the unconditioned stimulus.24 Extinction learning involves learning that certain stimuli previously 
associated with danger or a trauma (e.g., a quiet street) are now safe (e.g., do not signify that an assault 
is imminent). Successful fear extinction involves formation of a new memory of safety, which overlays the 
original fear memory and relies on intact ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) function.[ADDRESS_1119392] been proposed to underlie a range of PTSD symptoms, including intrusions 
and heightened arousal. 
1.C.3.  Mechanisms underlying the effects of ketamine: Reversal of disrupted synaptic atrophy, 
enhancement of fear extinction learning. Studies in animal models have yielded insights into the 
mechanisms of action of ketamine. In rats first subjected to chronic unpredictable stress for 21 days, a 
single dose of ketamine was shown to reverse, within 24 hours, stress-induced behavioral deficits, 
synaptic atrophy, and pyramidal neuron dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex (PFC).[ADDRESS_1119393] not yet been published, ketamine 
was shown to normalize disrupted functional dysconnectivity between PFC/subcortical regions and the 
rest of the brain in patients with major depressive disorder, [ADDRESS_1119394] that ketamine enhances fear 
extinction learning. In one study of fear-conditioned rats, ketamine administration enhanced the effects 
of fear extinction training, resulting in reduced return of fear a week later upon exposure to the original 
fear conditioning context, mediated by [CONTACT_218525]1 signaling in the mPFC.32 In a mouse model of PTSD, 
repeated ketamine administration also enhanced the effects of fear extinction training, resulting in 
reduced relapse of fear associated with increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the 
hippocampus and mPFC.[ADDRESS_1119395] that ketamine might open a window of increased

1.D. Adding Psychotherapy to Ketamine Treatment for PTSD: Potential for Synergistic Effect: As the 
effects of ketamine 
administration in 
individuals with PTSD 
(or TRD) are rapid and 
robust, a key next step 
in treatment research 
is to identify strategies 
to maintain this initial 
response to ketamine 
over time. In this 
context, interest in 
leveraging a ketamine-
induced temporary 
window of increased 
neuroplasticity and 
enhanced learning by

CBT),11,[ADDRESS_1119397] recently in PTSD (prolonged exposure, PE).[ADDRESS_1119398], helpi[INVESTIGATOR_809495] (see Figure 2). An open-label pi[INVESTIGATOR_809496] 
(three infusions, administered weekly) with a course of PE therapy in a small sample (n=10) of veterans 
with chronic PTSD was recently published.[ADDRESS_1119399] the feasibility of adding an exposure-
based psychotherapy to ketamine treatment, the potential efficacy of this approach in maintaining 
response to ketamine over time needs to be formally studied. Of note, in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], which employed 
a 10-session traditional Prolonged Exposure (PE), 50% of participants dropped out prior to completing 
therapy.13 In our proposed trial, we anticipate that the selection of WET, a brief and highly tolerable 
exposure-based therapy, will be associated with much lower participant dropout. 
1.E. Written Exposure Therapy (WET) is an evidence-based, brief and scalable exposure-based 
psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD, co-developed by [CONTACT_15957]-Investigator [CONTACT_809580], and designed 
to be a tolerable and efficient exposure-based treatment for PTSD that does not include between-session 
assignments. WET evolved from a careful and systematic series of studies to identify necessary 
components for successful PTSD treatment.[ADDRESS_1119400], nominal time 
needed to train therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], and brevity of treatment results in an approach that addresses many of the Figure 2: Potential Synergistic Effect of Adding an Exposure-based

1.F. Extinction learning as a potential predictor of PTSD symptom change following repeated ketamine 
+ WET. The collective findings summarized above (and in Figure 2) constitute the scientific rationale for 
evaluating ketamine-induced improvement in extinction learning as a predictor of  response to ketamine 
+ WET (Aim 2). While better extinction learning prior to starting exposure therapy has been hypothesized 
to predict better outcomes, this has rarely been studied, with the exception of two neuroimaging studies 
evaluating extinction learning as a predictor of response to exposure therapy in individuals with public 
speaking anxiety and spi[INVESTIGATOR_391922], respectively. Better extinction learning pre-intervention, and neural 
activation during extinction learning, predicted higher post-intervention symptom reduction, assessed in 
the first study two weeks post-intervention.43,44 The authors of the second study conclude that “boosting 
the extinction circuitry may be a target for improving exposure therapy success.”[ADDRESS_1119403] session –measured by [CONTACT_809543]’ facial fear expression, acoustic startle, skin

2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
2.3.1 KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS 
Risks to privacy and confidentiality: 
As the research study involves collection of protected and sensitive health information, there is a 
potential risk of loss of confidentiality. This risk will be conveyed to subjects as part of informed consent 
and will be minimized by [CONTACT_809544], 
which comply with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act rules.

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017 11Risks associated with blood draw or insertion of intravenous canula:  
Subjects might feel pain during blood draw or when IV is inserted, and can develop bruising, and rarely, 
infection. The sight of blood or insertion of IV canula may also cause dizziness or brief loss of 
consciousness due to vasovagal response. Therefore, all blood draws will be conducted by [CONTACT_31809], using aseptic precautions, and in a setting where the subject is resting comfortably and the 
risk of fall is minimized.
Risks associated with psychological questionnaires and assessments: 
Answering questions related to mental health and past experiences may be stressful. Research 
interviews will be interrupted if subjects become distressed or object to answering questions. If in the 
judgment of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_354240]-affiliated psychiatrist, the patient has worsened to such a degree that 
further participation would put the patient at risk, then the subject will be discontinued from the study 
and provided appropriate clinical care.
Risks associated with ketamine infusion: 
Ketamine is an analgesic agent and general anesthetic for human and veterinary use. It also has 
dissociative and psychedelic properties. For that reason, ketamine was categorized as a Schedule III drug 
in the Controlled Substance Act in August 1999. Over the past several decades, ketamine has been 
administered as an anesthetic to several million adults and children and has a very favorable safety 
profile. In addition, it has been used in psychophysiological studies in normal volunteers and patients 
with severe mental disorders including major depressive disorder and PTSD (with similar doses to those 
used in our proposed study) safely for three decades. Furthermore, the s-enantiomer of ketamine was 
approved for use as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder by [CONTACT_53010] & Drug 
Administration, and more recently for the treatment of depressive symptoms in individuals with major 
depressive disorder with acute suicidal ideation or behavior, reflecting its favorable risk versus benefit 
profile. Perceptual disturbances may manifest as vivid dreaming, visualization of psychedelic color, 
suspension in space, kaleidoscopic floating, and out-of-body experiences. Some patients report the 
psychic experiences as bizarre or frightening, while others describe them as pleasurable, joyful, or 
fascinating. When such reactions occur, they are usually mild and short-lived, resolving several minutes 
following the end of infusion. Other side effects commonly associated with ketamine include temporary 
increases in blood pressure and/or heart rate which will be monitored closely during, and for 1 hour 
after the end of, the infusions. Use of ketamine may also be associated with nausea. Interruption or 
discontinuation of infusion is usually adequate to resolve these ketamine-associated acute side effects.
Risks associated with WET: 
Although WET may decrease PTSD and related symptoms, we recognize that individuals with PTSD may 
face the risk of symptomatic worsening. Indeed, one concern with exposure to trauma reminders is that 
individuals may acutely feel more anxious, even though exposure and habituation generally decrease 
PTSD symptoms over time. Conducting WET remotely via video telehealth requires special care in 
monitoring potential symptom worsening during sessions. We will take multiple precautions to ensure 
patient safety. 
Financial risks:  
Subjects will not be charged for any study procedures. However, in case they experience an adverse  
effect and seek care, they or their insurance provider will be responsible for this clinical care. Subjects 
will be informed of this risk as part of informed consent process.

proposed study, REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), will collect it in a de-identified fashion, 
using only the subjects’ assigned study ID number (after eligibility is verified). As the study requires 
infusions of ketamine, subjects will be informed that their protected health information may be entered

We have described above the potential risks of the research procedures and the safeguards that will 
be used to minimize risks. These include termination of subjects from research participation if it is 
believed that such participation endangers their welfare. Monitoring procedures are used to evaluate 
potential side effects of treatment or of research procedures. The protocol stipulates an extensive 
medical and psychiatric evaluation of all subjects as a condition for research participation. Subjects are 
monitored throughout the study for potential reactions to psychological assessments, ketamine 
administration, or participation in WET, including treatment-emergent suicidality. Special attention will 
be devoted to monitoring and assessing participant safety during remote video telehealth sessions, 
including monitoring for potential symptom worsening. Any concern about elevated participant risk

have access to a family member or friend who can inform them of the subject’s condition. To ensure 
safe participation, it is helpful to ask each subject to designate an emergency contact [CONTACT_9702]. All suicide 
threats are taken seriously. It is important to assess the risk of suicide carefully when working with these

Many subjects may admit to fleeting thoughts of death or briefly wishing for death; these thoughts 
need to be considered in context of the subject’s overall history, along with a consideration of other risk 
factors for suicide. Study psychiatrists will assess every patient at each visit for suicide risk and potential. 
As is the SOP for our Center, a 24-hr on call psychiatrist (PI [INVESTIGATOR_354240]-affiliated psychiatrist) will be 
designated to cover emergencies. Individuals at such risk will be treated appropriately, including options 
such as increased contact, more frequent clinical visits, or emergency psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Please

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017 154 STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 OVERALL DESIGN
The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of adding WET to a course of ketamine 
infusions in improving PTSD symptoms from baseline to 12 weeks from the start of WET, in individuals 
with chronic PTSD (Aim 1). Additional objectives are to evaluate whether ketamine-induced change in 
extinction learning, assessed with an online Extinction Learning Task, predicts PTSD symptom 
improvement (Aim 2) in participants with chronic PTSD. In order to accomplish these objectives, we will 
conduct an open-label trial of ketamine plus WET in individuals with chronic PTSD. Participants will start 
WET after completing the first four ketamine infusions. Participants will receive two additional ketamine 
infusions (for a total of six infusions), interwoven with five WET sessions.  
Eligible participants will receive a total of six ketamine infusions (see Figure 1 and Methodological 
Details below), administered over [ADDRESS_1119409] three sessions of WET will be administered during the week following the end of ketamine infusions.
The clinical trial primary outcome is change in PTSD symptom severity from baseline to 12 weeks from 
the start of WET, measured with the CAPS-550. Secondary outcomes include change in PTSD symptom 
severity from baseline to 6 weeks from the start of WET, and change in other outcome measures from 
baseline to 6 weeks, and baseline to 12 weeks. Patients whose improvement in PTSD symptoms is 
maintained after 12 weeks will complete monthly assessments up to 24 weeks from start of WET. A 
continuous clinical rater will administer the CAPS-5 and the MADRS for the primary and secondary 
outcome assessments.
Methodological Details 
a. Screening Procedures (see 3.1 Schedule of Activities): Individuals will undergo informed consent 
procedures and study screening at the clinical site. If the COVID-19 pandemic remains a concern, these 
procedures will be conducted remotely, via a HIPAA-compliant telehealth platform (e.g., VSee, Doximity, 
HIPAA-Zoom). After signing the informed consent form, participants will complete a structured 
diagnostic interview with the SCID-5,[ADDRESS_1119410] of Adult Reading (WTAR),[ADDRESS_1119411] (MoCA).[ADDRESS_1119412] 
of scales to be completed by [CONTACT_809548]. All subjects will complete forms related to 
demographics, medical history, concomitant medications and treatment, and self-report measures 
including the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ),56 Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ),[ADDRESS_1119413] for DSM-5 (PCL-5),58 and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS).59 Participants will also undergo a 
medical evaluation, including medical history; physical examination by a nurse practitioner; 
documentation of height, weight and vital signs; comprehensive blood tests; and urinalysis, urine 
toxicology screen, and urine pregnancy test (in women of childbearing potential). After reviewing all 
information, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_809499], and current medications and treatment, answer any questions the patient might have,

b. Administration of ketamine infusions: Eligible participants will receive a total of six infusions, 
administered over two consecutive weeks. At each infusion, they will receive 0.5 mg/kg of racemic 
ketamine hydrochloride, and total dose no higher than 60 mg per infusion (regardless of body weight). 
All infusion procedures and monitoring will take place at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 
(ISMMS) Psychiatry Infusion Suite  or Clinical Research Unite (CRU) using the existing Standard Operating 
Procedures that are in place for the administration of ketamine in research studies. 
c. Assessment of response to ketamine: Response to ketamine, assessed 24 hours after the fourth 
infusion, is defined as ≥ 30% reduction in PTSD symptom severity on the CAPS-5, administered to the 
participant by a trained clinical rater, compared to baseline (prior to any infusions). This degree of 
improvement is commonly used in clinical trials in individuals with PTSD to represent clinically significant 
PTSD symptom improvement,62-[ADDRESS_1119415] of repeated ketamine

WET consists of five sessions, with the first session lasting [ADDRESS_1119416]. Denise Sloan, who co-developed the WET intervention.65 Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_809500]’s- or PhD-level mental health providers, supervised by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Sloan. WET will be delivered over a 
total of two weeks. The first two sessions of WET will be delivered starting after completion of the first 
four ketamine infusions, and interleaved with the last 2  ketamine infusions (each WET session and 
ketamine infusion occurring on one of four different days). The ketamine dose and administration 
protocol will be the same for all six infusions. The last three sessions of WET will be delivered the following 
week, after completion of the six ketamine infusions. Participant narratives will be collected as part of the 
WET sessions, as they are a necessary part of treatment and are used to ensure that the instructions for 
each writing session are followed by [CONTACT_3038]. Collection will be completed securely, either by 
[CONTACT_77500] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_809501], uploading a scanned copy of the narratives, 
or by [CONTACT_809549] (if there is a planned in-person visit shortly

Assessments will be administered weekly starting at baseline, prior to the first infusion.
Primary outcome measure:  The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5),[ADDRESS_1119417] measure 
in clinical trials in individuals with PTSD, will be administered weekly by a blinded clinical rater. The primary 
outcome is change in PTSD symptom severity as measured by [CONTACT_809550] 12 weeks 
following the start of WET. All participants will be followed for 12 weeks. Participants who remain 
improved will additionally be followed monthly for 12 to 24 weeks. 
Secondary outcome measures (exploratory): The CAPS-5 will be administered weekly (beginning at 
baseline prior to the first ketamine infusion) until 6 weeks from the start of WET; thereafter, the CAPS-5 
will be administered weekly as tolerated until 12 weeks; all participants will be administered the CAPS-5 
at the 12-week time point. Participants who maintain PTSD symptom improvement after 12 weeks will be 
assessed monthly up to 24 weeks from the start of WET or until loss of improvement, by [CONTACT_809551]. The PCL-5 and SDS (self-report scales), the MADRS (administered by [CONTACT_809552]), and the CGI-S and CGI-Improvement scales (administered by a study psychiatrist or clinician) will 
be administered at the same time points until 12 weeks, and then monthly up to 24 weeks or until loss of 
improvement (See 3.1 Schedule of Activities). The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-

baseline (prior to any infusions) and again [ADDRESS_1119420] WET session; data from these scales will 
be used for Aim-3 analyses.
Safety Assessments: Participants will be evaluated prior to each infusion by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_809502]-
affiliated psychiatrist; including review of vital signs, weight/BMI, drug and pregnancy tests, concomitant 
medications and adverse events. Participants will be monitored continuously during all ketamine 
infusions. On infusion days, side effects will be assessed with the Patient-Rated Inventory of Side Effects 
(PRISE) Adverse Event Visit Checklist,71 the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS),72 the 
Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) [ADDRESS_1119421] item.74  
f. Online Extinction Learning Task ( see Figure 7 : The computerized task, administered online, consists of 
three phases: an initial aversive conditioning phase (in context A), extinction learning phase (in context 
A), and further extinction learning (in novel context B) (see Figure 6 ). Importantly, the conditioned 
stimulus (CS) associated with the aversive loss outcome (US), the CS+, is only partially reinforced 
(P(US|CS+)=1/3), and the transition to extinction (P(US|CS+)=0) is unsignaled. This design maximizes 
uncertainty about whether CS+ trials during extinction should be grouped with unreinforced conditioning 
phase CS+ trials, implying a common cause is responsible for both kinds of observations, or instead that 
the change in contingencies indicates it is likely that a new cause is active in the environment. The 
predictive measure generated from this task for Aim 2 analyses is the difference in discrimination between 
CS+ and CS- across the first six blocks of the task. Further, loss expectancy ratings data from each trial of 
the online extinction task will be analyzed via a computational model of latent cause inference developed 
by [CONTACT_809553], Niv, and colleagues75,76 (see Data Analysis Strategy ). There are two versions of the task  (see

phases: (1) initial aversive conditioning phase, in context A; (2) extinction learning phase, also in context 
A; and (3) further extinction learning, in new context B (see Figure 6). Participants are told that they are 
traveling through different zones of a spaceship. In order to power their trip home, they need to escape 
with enough space coins. These coins are carried by [CONTACT_809554], but some are unreliable. Participants

Leaning Task: (1) before the first ketamine infusion and (2) after completion of four ketamine infusions 
(pre-WET). Extinction learning will be defined as the difference in discrimination between the aversively 
conditioned (CS+) and safe (CS-) stimuli on the first six blocks of this task. Ketamine-induced change in 
extinction learning will be evaluated as a predictor PTSD symptom improvement from baseline to 12 
weeks from the start of WET. A recently developed computational model75,76 will be employed to 
determine whether differences in discrimination between CS+ and CS- are related to differential 
inferences about the causal structure of the task during learning (i.e., participants’ belief that one vs. 
multiple underlying causes explain observations during progression through the task).48
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DOSE
In this trial, the dose of ketamine administered at each infusion (0.5 mg/kg, administered over 40 
minutes) is the same dose that is administered in most clinical trials of intravenous ketamine for 
treatment-resistant depression (TRD), and the same dose that was administered in our two completed 
clinical trials of intravenous ketamine for chronic PTSD. This dose has shown efficacy and safety for 
these disorders. Additionally, as requested by [CONTACT_809557], the maximum dose of 
ketamine will be 60 mg at each infusion, regardless of participant body weight. 
Employing the same dose, frequency, and total number of infusions in this open-label clinical trial of 
ketamine + WET will allow us to compare study findings to the findings from our completed clinical trial 
of repeated ketamine infusions for PTSD, which evaluated the efficacy of a repeated course of ketamine 
infusions, without WET.

Participants who use tobacco products will be instructed that use of nicotine-containing 
products (including nicotine patches) will not be permitted while they are in the clinical unit. 
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical trial but are not 
subsequently assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. A minimal set of screen failure 
information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants, to meet the 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to 
queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, 
eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event (SAE).
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) because of an 
exclusionary concomitant medication, or a recent change in medications or psychotherapy may be 
rescreened. Rescreened participants should be assigned the same participant number as for the initial 
screening.

Protocol STUDY 21-[ZIP_CODE] 23 June  2021
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017 245.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION
Planned Recruitment Activities:
The research strategy for the present study calls for the enrollment of N=30 adults with chronic 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), aged 18-70 years. This enrollment is with the goal of identifying up 
to N=16 participants who are screened, eligible, and go on to receive ketamine infusions and WET. This 
is based on an anticipated screen fail rate of 25% to 50%.This enrollment will take place over the 
proposed 54-month recruitment period. 
The expected enrollment rate of ~1.2 subjects per month who receive ketamine infusions is highly 
feasible based on the current flow of subjects in clinical trials at the Depression and Anxiety Center for 
Discovery and Treatment (DAC) and the demonstrated track record of similar rates in prior studies at 
DAC and recruiting from WTC populations in CDC/NIOSH-funded studies led by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Feder. As one of 
the major research and clinical programs at the Department of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of 
Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), DAC has five full-time faculty members. This includes three 
psychiatrists, two part-time clinical psychologists, two full-time post-doctoral fellows, three full-time 
Masters-level clinical raters, five full-time clinical research coordinators, a database manager, and a 
program administrator. Investigators at DAC have a long track record in successfully recruiting subjects 
and completing studies involving the assessment and treatment of individuals with PTSD.  
Recruitment Procedures:
We will post advertisements on Craigslist, ResearchMatch, Facebook, TrialFacts, BuildClinical and Google 
and will post flyers in the community, and accept referrals from clinicians. Through TrialFacts and 
BuildClinical, we will have targeted advertisements on Google and Facebook.
Potentially eligible participants who express interest in being considered for this clinical trial will 
complete a phone screen interview under the supervision of PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Feder. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_809507]-Investigators Drs. Jha 
and Murrough, so that any deviation from the anticipated enrollment schedule will be detected and 
remedied quickly. All outreach and advertising activities will also be reviewed on a weekly basis. 
 
Engagement Strategies for Retention:
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_809508]-Investigators Drs. Jha and 
Murrough to monitor enrollment and ensure that enrolled subjects are completing all study procedures 
as per protocol.
For infrastructure, the Scientific Computing department at ISMMS provides a secure centralized 
electronic data management platform that is HIPAA and FDA-compliant – Research Electronic Data 
Capture (REDCap). For this specific project, we will create databases in REDCap for screening, subject 
tracking, and a study database proper. As subjects complete study visits, the date of each visit will be 
entered in the database. Missed visits will be coded for reason (such as scheduling issues, illness). On a 
weekly basis, the primary research coordinator, who will also serve as data manager, will run a report on 
patient enrollment and study progress for review by [CONTACT_978]. On an ongoing basis, the data manager, PI,

Denise Sloan (who will supervise the study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]) to identify any potential issues related to delivery 
of WET to participants.
Within DAC, the study coordinator will be the participant’s point of contact [CONTACT_61641]. Subjects 
will be provided with phone and email contact [CONTACT_809559], in addition to contact 
[CONTACT_71722]. When enrolled, participants will provide detailed contact [CONTACT_809560], their clinical providers (if applicable), and a family member or close friend who is aware of 
the participant’s study participation. At each visit, the study coordinator will “check in” with the 
participant regarding protocol adherence and study satisfaction, in addition to any protocol-specific 
procedures. This system provides an opportunity to detect reasons for non-adherence or early 
discontinuation in a timely fashion and to address any issues, if at all possible. 
Strategies to ensure a diverse, representative sample: 
Since its inception, ISMMS has fostered community partnerships that are mutually beneficial to the 
School and nearby [CONTACT_809561]. Faculty members have benefited from collaborations with 
underserved and often hard-to-reach populations and front-line clinicians, to recruit for research, 
develop research partnerships and to ensure that community expertise, experiences and priorities 
inform their work. The Centers for Community and Academic Research Partnerships (CCARP) at Mount 
Sinai is facilitating the formation and transformation of these partnerships so that they become the 
catalyst for groundbreaking research that uncovers and addresses important social, environmental, and 
health problems; builds skills among academic and community partners; and improves health of 
communities. 
The ISMMS is part of a large urban medical center, located in the Manhattan borough of [LOCATION_001] City, 
and benefits from a large and diverse catchment area. For the proposed clinical trial there are no special 
restrictions with regard to ethnicity or race. It is expected that the study sample will closely approximate 
the racial and ethnic composition of populations residing in the [LOCATION_001] City metropolitan area. 
Potential recruitment/enrollment challenges and strategies that can be implemented in the event of 
enrollment shortfalls:
Anticipated barriers include issues with staff workload and scheduling windows. This will be addressed 
by [CONTACT_809562]-up coordinators for the primary study coordinator on the proposed project. 
Furthermore, Co-Investigators [CONTACT_102691], [CONTACT_29189], and [CONTACT_174990] will serve as back-up study physicians 
for the PI, [CONTACT_116239], within the research team. Back-up team members will allow the team to screen 
and enroll participants and complete study visits within participant’s availability. All study staff involved 
in participant recruitment will be trained by [CONTACT_978], in collaboration with Director of DAC [CONTACT_29189], 
and participant progress and study procedures will be reviewed at weekly project meetings to ensure 
protocol adherence and consistency of procedures across primary and back-up study personnel. 
Anticipated participant-related barriers include appointment scheduling, transportation issues, and 
maintaining contact [CONTACT_242173]. To ensure that participants are able to attend appointments,

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.[ADDRESS_1119435]. Staff will also 
reach out before each scheduled appointment to ensure participants are able to attend and complete 
visits as scheduled. To ease the burden on participants, we will also administer the five WET sessions 
remotely, via a HIPAA-compliant video telehealth platform.
At the current moment, the COVID-19 pandemic poses a potential barrier to enrollment in this and 
other studies. DAC is working closely with Departmental and Health System leadership to ensure 
optimization of SOPs related to mitigating risks pertaining to COVID-19 infection. Strategies to mitigate 
this barrier include the use of clear and consistent messaging to potential participants regarding safety 
precautions at DAC, including the implementation of thorough and consistent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-grade cleaning 
and disinfecting, the use of masks and eye protection by [CONTACT_3462], the use of masks by 
[CONTACT_4317], and social distancing. We are also allowing provisions for remote visits (via HIPAA-
compliant video telehealth platforms) wherever possible, in addition to the WET sessions, which will 
take place remotely.
In the case of slower than anticipated enrollment, PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Feder and Co-Is Drs. Murrough and Jha will 
review reasons for pre-screen and screen failures during weekly DAC research meetings, and consider 
additional recruitment and outreach methods including additional advertising methods, and additional 
outreach methods to clinicians and centers providing treatment to individuals with chronic PTSD.
6 STUDY INTERVENTION
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) ADMINISTRATION
6.1.1 STUDY INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION
Ketamine:
Ketamine is widely available as an anesthetic agent under the brand name [CONTACT_809579], for use in emergency 
rooms and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_809509]. The typi[INVESTIGATOR_243375]-anesthetic dose in clinical trials 
for patients with TRD or PTSD is 0.5 mg/kg, administered intravenously over 40 minutes.
Relevant to the criteria for an exemption in § 312.2(b), we informally reached out to the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) via email seeking their advice regarding the IND exemption. We were informed 
that the Division of Psychiatry Products is currently exempting studies with [ADDRESS_1119436] extensive

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.[ADDRESS_1119437] will be enrolled in the proposed 
study until an IND exemption has been granted.
Relevant to the individual criterion for exemption in § 312.2(b) (bolded statements from FDA guidance):
1.The drug product is lawfully marketed in the [LOCATION_002]. We propose to use ketamine that is 
commercially available and will be supplied by [CONTACT_195465], the Investigational Drug 
Service at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
2.The investigation is not intended to be reported to the FDA as a well-controlled study in 
support of a new indication and there is no intent to use it to support any other significant 
change in the labeling of the drug. We do not intent to report the results of our proposed study 
to the FDA as a well-controlled study in support of a new indication, nor do we intend to use it 
to support any other significant change in the labeling of the drug. As mentioned earlier, the 
purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the addition of Written Exposure Therapy to a 
course of ketamine infusions can extend the effect of ketamine on PTSD symptoms in individuals 
with chronic PTSD who respond to ketamine.
3.The investigation is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the 
drug. We do not intend to utilize the data we generate to support any changes in advertising of 
ketamine. As mentioned in the specific aims section, the purpose of this study is to evaluate 
whether the addition of Written Exposure Therapy to a course of ketamine infusions can extend 
the effect of ketamine on PTSD symptoms in individuals with chronic PTSD who respond to 
ketamine.
4.The investigation does not involve a route of administration, dose, patient population, or 
other factor that significantly increases the risk (or decreases the acceptability of the risk) 
associated with the use of the drug product (21 CFR 312.2(b)(1)(iii)). We intend to use 
ketamine via intravenous route (after diluting it with normal saline for total infusion volume of 
100 mL) in adults with PTSD who are medically stable and have no medical contraindications 
against ketamine administration, three times per week for two weeks (total of 4 or 6 infusions 
over 2 weeks, depending on ketamine response). Previous reports have used repeated infusions 
of ketamine (up to 6) over a two-week period, including our recently completed randomized 
controlled trial of repeated ketamine infusions in patients with chronic PTSD, compared to the 
active placebo midazolam (PI [INVESTIGATOR_809510], [CONTACT_116239], was the PI [INVESTIGATOR_809511], funded in 
part by a NARSAD Independent Investigator Award from the Brain & Behavior Research 
Foundation).
5.The investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements for review by [CONTACT_2717] (21 
CFR part 56) and with the requirements for informed consent (21 CFR part 50). We plan to 
enroll subjects after the study is approved by [CONTACT_809563].
6.The investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements of § 312.7 (i.e., the 
investigation is not intended to promote or commercialize the drug product). We do not 
intend to promote or commercialize the drug product (ketamine) with this investigation.

6.1.2 DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION
Ketamine:
The dose of ketamine at each infusion is fixed at 0.5mg/kg mg, and up to 60 mg per infusion (regardless 
of body weight), to be administered intravenously over 40 minutes. Individuals at or above 120 kg will 
receive 60 mg over 40 minutes. Ketamine infusion will be discontinued earlier if necessary due to side 
effects as described below:
1. Changes in psychiatric symptoms at any time during the study: 
a. Treatment-emergent mania, hypomania, worsening suicidality or psychosis
2. Emergent medical symptoms on the infusion days:
a. Criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_51119]:
i. Any change in mental status resulting in inability to respond to verbal 
stimuli.
ii. Severe headache, or severe anxiety, or other patient tolerability issues
iii. SBP >180, DBP >110 on 2 consecutive readings, ~5 min apart
iv. HR >120 for 5 minutes
v. RR< 6, SPO2 <90% at any time point
vi. Should the patient’s vital signs deviate from normal, the clinician may 
temporarily pause the infusion until the vital signs/mental status have 
returned to normal, and subsequently resume the infusion at the same or 
slower rate. Recommended protocol: If 150 ml/h not tolerated, slow to 100 
ml/h; If 100 ml/h not tolerated, slow to 50 ml/h.
b. During intravenous infusion day and post-administration monitoring period: in the 
event of tachycardia >110 beats per minute, systolic BP>160 mm Hg or diastolic 
BP>100mg Hg that is not resolved by [CONTACT_809565], the 
study physician will treat using the following preferred medications;
i. Esmolol 100-500 mcg/kg IV titrated to reduce the heart rate and systolic BP.
ii. Nitroglycerin 20-80 mcg IV titrated to reduce the BP to an acceptable range.
iii. Further therapy with longer acting agents such as metoprolol, esmolol and 
labetalol will be administered if the response to initial therapy is not 
adequate.
c. If three consecutive vital sign measurements (over 15 minutes) are consistently 
above the HR and BP limits stated above despi[INVESTIGATOR_116175], intravenous infusion will 
be discontinued.
d. If a patient becomes sedated to the point that he/she is unresponsive to verbal 
commands or there is complete or partial airway obstruction, intravenous infusion 
will be discontinued. The patient would then be transferred to the Post Anesthesia 
Care Unit or an intensive care unit bed as necessary for further observation and 
treatment.

Procedures Related to Ketamine Administration:
Ketamine Infusion: All infusion procedures and monitoring will take place at the Psychiatry Infusion 
Suite, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), using the existing Standard Operating 
Procedures that are in place for the administration of ketamine in research studies. All eligible 
participants will receive six infusions, administered three times per week over two consecutive weeks. 
At each infusion, participants will receive 0.5 mg/kg racemic ketamine hydrochloride, the same dose 
administered in prior studies of ketamine for the treatment of PTSD 6,49. An indwelling catheter will be 
placed in the antecubital vein of the non-dominant arm, and pulse, blood pressure, digital pulse-
oximetry, and ECG monitoring will be instituted. All physiologic monitoring data will be recorded on a 
standard anesthesia record beginning five minutes prior to ketamine administration. Co-Investigator [CONTACT_809581] or another study- affiliated physician with privileges to administer ketamine will be present at the 
Psychiatry Infusion Suite throughout the administration of ketamine so that potential adverse events 
can be evaluated and treated promptly. A medical crash cart is available for emergencies. [CONTACT_102691] or 
another study-affiliated physician will remain available until at least one hour following the termination 
of the study drug infusion or until the patient meets Aldrete criteria (good respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], O2 saturation, 
consciousness, circulation, and activity) for post- anesthesia care, whichever period is longer. Blood 
samples will be collected from participants during the first infusion for measurement of plasma 
ketamine and norketamine levels.
Assessment of response to ketamine after four initial infusions: Response to ketamine is defined as ≥  
30% reduction in PTSD symptom severity from baseline (prior to any infusions) determined with the 
CAPS-5, administered to the participant by a trained clinical rater [ADDRESS_1119438] of 
repeated ketamine for PTSD.49

7 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL
7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION
Discontinuation from ketamine or WET does not mean discontinuation from the study, and remaining 
study procedures should be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690].  If a clinically significant 
finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline) after enrollment, the 
investigator or qualified designee will determine if any change in participant management is needed. 
Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as an adverse event (AE).
The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the following:
Symptom measures (e.g.,CAPS-5, MADRS, PCL-5, SDS)
Global Clinical Severity and Improvement (CGI-S and CGI-I)
End-Of-Infusion labs
Safety data
Concomitant medications
Follow-up plan 
7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.
An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study for the following reasons:

The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_809570]/or should continue in the study.
Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, 
a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). 
These contact [CONTACT_13140]’s medical record or study file. 
Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up.
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
Participants in this proposed study will provide the following efficacy data: (A) data from clinician-
administered structured interviews (e.g., structured diagnostic interview with the SCID-5 and CAPS-5, 
clinical evaluation); (B) self-report data (e.g., symptom measures); and (C) behavioral data (online 
Extinction Learning Task). Additionally, participant will provide data on (D) demographics (e.g., age, sex, 
race, education, socioeconomic status); (E) measures of estimated IQ and cognitive functioning; and (F) 
psychiatric history and treatment, including any history of psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

Protocol STUDY 21-[ZIP_CODE] 23 June  2021
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017 34Diagnostic and Assessment Procedures: The diagnostic interviews and clinical ratings will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_31272]’s- or PhD-level clinical raters well-trained in diagnostic interviews and the clinical rating 
scales, supervised by [CONTACT_978]. Bi-annual inter-rater reliability procedures are conducted at DAC to ensure 
adequate calibration of inter-rater reliability (ICC> 0.90). In the event of staff turnover, new raters must 
achieve this threshold of reliability prior to participation.
The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) is the most widely used structured diagnostic 
interview to determine psychiatric diagnoses in clinical research settings based on DSM-5 criteria. The 
SCID-5 is organized into diagnostic modules, to assess mood, psychotic, substance use, anxiety, 
obsessive-compulsive and related, eating, and trauma- and stressor-related disorders, and other 
disorders 51. The SCID-5 will be used in this study to determine whether subjects meet DSM-5 criteria for 
PTSD and to assess other co-morbid psychiatric diagnoses, in order to determine study eligibility.
The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5)  is a structured diagnostic interview and the 
gold standard for assessing the DSM-[ADDRESS_1119445] a total CAPS-5 score ≥30, indicating at least moderate PTSD symptom 
severity, in order to be eligible to participate in this study. The CAPS-[ADDRESS_1119446] four ketamine infusions. 
Importantly, participants’ total CAPS-[ADDRESS_1119447] .
The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a 10-item instrument used for the 
evaluation of depressive symptoms in adults and for the assessment of any changes to those 
symptoms.52 Each of the 10 items is rated on a scale of 0 to 6, with differing descriptors for each item. 
These individual item scores are added together to form a total score, which can range between 0 and 
60 points. The estimated time to administer this scale is 20 minutes. Inter-rater reliability of the scale is 
high and scores correlate significantly with those of the HAM-D. On the infusion days a modified MADRS 
will be used that will exclude the sleep and appetite items. The MADRS will be used in this study as a 
secondary outcome measure, to assess change in co-morbid depressive symptom levels over time. 
Additionally, the MADRS will be employed to assess severity of co-morbid depressive symptoms as a 
clinical predictor for Aim 3 analyses.
The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a widely used cognitive screening tool to differentiate 
mild cognitive impairment from cognitive changes associated with health aging.55 A recommended 
cutoff score of 23 will be used to determine eligibility for this study, based on meta-analytic findings 
indicating that the cutoff of 26/[ADDRESS_1119448] of Adult Reading (WTAR) is a neuropsychological assessment measure used to derive 
a pre-morbid estimate of intelligence, and requires participants to read a list of 50 words.54 The WTAR 
will be administered at study screening to estimate participant IQ. Subjects with estimated IQ < 80 will

The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) is a widely used, valid and reliable retrospective self-report 
scale to screen for a history of childhood abuse and neglect. It includes a total of 28 items, and yields 
five subscale scores –emotional abuse and neglect, physical abuse and neglect, and sexual abuse–, as 
well as a minimization-denial score.56 In the proposed study, the CTQ will be employed as a trauma 
history predictor for Aim 3 analyses.
The Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ)  is a commonly used and rigorously tested self-report 
scale to assess the frequency, severity, and timing of a wide range of traumatic experiences experienced 
across the individual’s lifetime, including childhood and adulthood.[ADDRESS_1119450] for DSM-5 (PCL-5) is a widely used 20-item self-report measure to assess the 20 
DSM-5 PTSD symptoms.58 The PCL-5 measure has a Specific version to assess severity of PTSD symptoms 
in relation to a specific trauma. The Specific version of the PCL-5 will be used in this study as an 
additional, secondary outcome measure of PTSD symptom severity.
A 5-item abbreviated version of the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS),68 a 
widely used self-report scale assessing perceived social support, including emotional/informational, 
tangible and affectionate support, utilizing a 5-point Likert scale. This scale will be administered at 
baseline (before the first infusion) and again 3 weeks after the addition of WET. This scale will be used 
for exploratory analyses for Aim 3.
The Perceived Ability to Cope with Trauma (PACT)70 is a 20-item self-report scale assessing perceived 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_809522] a traumatic event. There are two main subscale scores: Forward-focused 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_809523], reflecting the respondent’s ability to maintain goals and plans following a traumatic event, 
and Trauma-focused Copi[INVESTIGATOR_809523], reflecting the respondent’s ability to face feelings and cognitions 
relating to a traumatic event. Additionally, a Flexibility score can be calculated to determine the 
respondent’s ability to engage in both forward-focused and trauma-focused copi[INVESTIGATOR_809524] 
a traumatic event. This scale will be administered at baseline (before the first infusion) and again 3 
weeks after the addition of WET. This scale will be used for exploratory analyses for Aim 3.
The short-item Centrality of Event Scale (CES)[ADDRESS_1119451] 
stressful/traumatic event is to an individual’s identity and life narrative. This scale will be administered 
at baseline (before the first infusion) and again [ADDRESS_1119452] of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R)  is one of the most widely used self-report measures of stress 
reactions to traumatic events,67 measuring both intrusion and avoidance. Correlations between IES-R 
subscales and PTSD diagnosis assessed with the CAPS are high (>0.75). Unlike the PCL-5, this scale is able 
to assess changes in PTSD symptoms (intrusion and avoidance) over a 24-hour time period. In this study, 
we will use this measure as a secondary outcome measure to assess for rapid improvement in  PTSD 
symptom severity at 24-hours after the first ketamine infusion, and to assess symptom change at each 
ketamine infusion and on the ketamine response assessment day.

including passive and active suicidal ideation, suicidal intent, and suicidal behaviors.[ADDRESS_1119456] extensive experience in its utilization. The Center has established 
SOPs for handling suicidality. For patients who do not show suicidality at the described threshold and 
proceed to participate in this study, the C-SSRS will be administered at each assessment time point (until 
12 weeks, and then monthly up to 24 weeks or until loss of response), to assess for suicidal ideation and 
participant safety throughout the study. Participants with scores of 4 or greater at any point during the 
study will be exited from the study and promptly referred for clinical care.
The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)  is a brief, 5-item self-report scale that assesses functional 
impairment in domains of work or school, social life, and family life.59 Higher scores on this scale

The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)  is a clinician-administered assessment used to capture acute 
behavioral changes throughout treatment.73 We will use only the four items assessing positive (+) 
symptoms of psychosis such as conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspi[INVESTIGATOR_23703], and 
unusual thought content for this proposed study. The scale will be administered before and after each 
infusion.
The Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS)  is commonly used in ketamine studies, 
and will be administered before and after each infusion to assess the severity of dissociative symptoms 
associated with ketamine administration.72

of a spaceship, and needed to escape with enough space coins to power their journey home. Unfortunately, the coins need to 
be carried by [CONTACT_809554], some of whom are unreliable. On each trial, participants encounter a robot and rate how likely they 
think that robot will be to lose coins using a sliding bar (participants are informed that their ratings will not change the outcome 
they observe, but that their predictions should be as accurate as possible in order to aid future space travelers). In a second 
version of the task (identical in structure but with an underwater setting), participants must travel through different parts of the 
ocean, and predict how likely they think different sea creatures they encounter are to keep or lose pearls they must trade for 
their passage.

associated with the aversive loss outcome (US), the CS+, is only partially reinforced (P(US|CS+)=1/3), and 
the transition to extinction (P(US|CS+)=0) is unsignaled. This design maximizes uncertainty about 
whether CS+ trials during extinction should be grouped with unreinforced conditioning phase CS+ trials, 
implying a common cause is responsible for both kinds of observations, or instead that the change in 
contingencies indicates it is likely that a new cause is active in the environment. The predictive measure 
generated from this task for Aim 2 analyses (PTSD symptom change between baseline and 12 weeks 
from the start of WET) is the difference in discrimination between CS+ and CS- across the first six blocks 
of the task. 
Further, loss expectancy ratings data from each trial of the online extinction task will be analyzed via a 
computational model of latent cause inference developed by [CONTACT_809553], Niv, and colleagues75,76 (see 
Data Analysis Strategy). There are two versions of the task (see description in Figure 7 note): one version 
will be administered prior to any ketamine infusions, and the second version after completion of the 
first four infusions. We will examine whether improvement in extinction learning from baseline to 
completion of four initial ketamine infusions (prior to starting WET) is associated with PTSD symptom 
improvement from baseline to 12 weeks from the start of WET.
8.2 SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS
Participants in this proposed study will provide the following safety data: 
(A) Data related to medical history, physical examination including review of systems, vital signs, 
ECG, routine laboratory tests (comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, thyroid 
function testing) needed to determine eligibility and to monitor safety of participants
(B) Measures to assess for any acute side effects associated with ketamine before and after each 
infusion; potential longer- lasting side effects will be assessed weekly until resolution.
For laboratory tests, all results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_354240]-affiliated psychiatrist, and any 
incidental finding will be conveyed to the subject with provision for additional work-up if needed.
Plasma ketamine and norketamine levels will be assessed via serial blood draws at the first ketamine 
infusion. Blood will be drawn from a second IV catheter at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes from the start of 
the infusion. Samples will be spun down and aliquoted into plasma samples. These samples will then be 
transported to Mount Sinai Clinical Laboratory Services (Sinai Labs) for shipment to an external 
laboratory (LabCorps) for the ketamine and norketamine levels.
The Patient-Rated Inventory of Side Effects (PRISE) Adverse Event Visit Checklist71 is a clinician- 
administered questionnaire used to qualify side effects by [CONTACT_29164]. This scale will be completed before and after each infusion, and at each assessment time 
point (weekly until 12 weeks, and then monthly up to 24 weeks or until loss of response), by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_809526].

Protocol STUDY 21-[ZIP_CODE] 23 June  2021
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017 398.3.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)
 All adverse events (AEs), defined as any physical or clinical change or disease experienced by a 
participant at any time during the course of the study, will be recorded in the participant’s research 
records and will be captured in the electronic data capture system. [CONTACT_116239] will be responsible for 
reporting to and following the guidance of any other applicable oversight bodies, including (but not 
limited to) the Institutional Review Board, the Data Safety and Monitoring Board.
8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE) 
An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse 
event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
8.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT
[IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT
For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines 
will be used to describe severity. 
•Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities. 
•Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.
•Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or 
incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.
[IP_ADDRESS] RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION
All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_21217]/her clinical judgment. 
The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the 
study product must always be suspect. 
•Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention administration and cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the

Protocol STUDY 21-[ZIP_CODE] 23 June  2021
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017 40study intervention (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge 
procedure if necessary.
•Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within 
a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on 
withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition.
•Potentially Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other 
factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other 
concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it 
can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or 
“definitely related”, as appropriate.
•Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose 
temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal relationship 
improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the 
study intervention) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides 
plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).
•Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an 
alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].
[IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTEDNESS 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_21190] (AE) is expected or unexpected.  An 
AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with 
the risk information previously described for the study intervention.
8.3.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_21218] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs 
occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be 
followed to adequate resolution.
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any 
time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.

during the course of the study and again at its completion, the DSMB will be provided with summaries of 
the numbers and rates of adverse events. These reports will include types of events, severity, and 
treatment phase. Data on individual non-serious adverse events is not expected to be needed for this 
review.
Many subjects may admit to fleeting thoughts of death or briefly wishing for death; these thoughts need 
to be considered in context of the subject’s overall history, along with a consideration of other risk 
factors for suicide. The presence of suicidal ideation without intent will therefore not be considered an 
Adverse Event, unless the suicidal ideation has increased in frequency or severity since baseline.

caused the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all-cause mortality) must be 
reported in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship 
between the study intervention and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the 
investigator must immediately report the event to the DSMB and ISMMS IRB.
All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site 
investigator deems the event to be chronic or the participant is stable. Other supporting documentation 
of the event may be requested by [CONTACT_809571].
The study sponsor (ISMMS) will be responsible for notifying the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of

8.3.9 REPORTING OF PREGNANCY 
In the event that a participant becomes pregnant while completing the study intervention(s), the 
participant will be exited from the trial after having completed end-of-infusion safety labs. Any 
pregnancies that occur while a subject is active in the protocol and after they have received ketamine 
infusions will be reported to the DSMB, ISMMS IRB, and other agencies (FDA, OHRP) as necessary.
8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS
8.4.1 DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the 
following criteria:
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol-related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant population being studied;
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.
8.4.2  UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING 
The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB). The UP report will include the following information:
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number;
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome; 
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP; 
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP.
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017 43• UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB within 24 hours of the 
investigator becoming aware of the event. 
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB within 5 business days of the investigator becoming 
aware of the problem. 
•All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s 
written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and the Office for 
Human Research Protections (OHRP) within 6 months of the IRB’s receipt of the report of the 
problem from the investigator.
 
8.4.3 REPORTING UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS TO PARTICIPANTS 
Unanticipated problems will be added to the study consent form if any are identified (via an IRB 
amendment). Newly enrolled participants will thus be informed about any such problems during 
administration of consent procedures for the study.
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES
Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s): 
oThe primary outcome is change in PTSD symptom severity from baseline to 12 weeks 
from the start of WET measured by [CONTACT_138208]-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 
(CAPS-5) score at 12 weeks from the start of WET minus the CAPS-5 score at baseline. 
The analysis of the primary endpoint for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_809527].  The mean change in CAPS-5 score and 
corresponding 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s) (Exploratory):
In this early-phase study, analyses of secondary efficacy outcomes will be considered 
exploratory and hypothesis-generating. Therefore, no formal hypothesis testing will be 
conducted. 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_809528] 15 patients will be enrolled.  A sample size of 15 patients will produce a two-
sided 95% confidence interval around the mean change in CAPS-[ADDRESS_1119463] deviations.
Precision was calculated using PASS 2019.83

Per-protocol Analysis Dataset (including only participants who completed the study). Additionally, a 
Safety Analysis Dataset and descriptive analyses will include all participants in the study.
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES
9.4.1 GENERAL APPROACH
Continuous variables will be summarized using the following descriptive statistics: number of non-missing 
values, means, standard deviations, medians, interquartile range, maximum, and minimum. Categorical 
variables will be summarized using number of non-missing values, counts and percentages. 
Rates of events will be calculated as the ratio of the total number of events recorded divided by [CONTACT_809572]-time. Total patient-time will be calculated by [CONTACT_260968] (in study time units, e.g., days or 
months) that patients were at risk for a specific event from the reference time point until either study exit or 
the end of the time period of interest. Rates and their 95% confidence intervals will be reported.  
Time-to-event variables will be summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method.
For any variable measured at multiple points in time, change since the day prior to starting WET, “pre-
WET” (i.e., the day when response to ketamine is assessed), will be calculated as the difference between 
the value of the variable at a specific point in time (e.g. 12 weeks) minus the value from pre-WET. 
Relative change from pre-WET will be calculated as the value of a parameter at a specific point in time 
minus the pre-WET value of the parameter divided by [CONTACT_7416]-WET value of the parameter.  Percent 
change will be calculated as the relative change multiplied by 100.
Should any of the statistical methods proposed prove unsuitable during data analysis, more appropriate 
methods will be used. These include data transformation (for example to a logarithmic scale) to satisfy model 
assumptions such as normally distributed residuals with constant variance, the application of non-parametric 
techniques or the use of a different link function or analytical/modeling technique. The SAP will be updated 
with the methods used and the justification for the change prior to data set and database lock.
9.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)
The primary outcome is change in PTSD symptom severity from baseline to 12 weeks from the start of 
WET measured by [CONTACT_138208]-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) score at 12 weeks from the 
start of WET minus the CAPS-5 score at baseline. The analysis of the primary endpoint for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_809529]. The mean change in CAPS-5 score from baseline with corresponding 95% confidence 
interval will be reported.
9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)
oSecondary Efficacy Outcomes (Exploratory): In this early-phase study, analyses of secondary 
efficacy outcomes will be considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating.  CAPS-5, PCL-5, 
MADRS, CGI and SDS scores will be collected weekly through 6 weeks after the start of WET from all

at the 12-week time point for all participants). All participants will be followed naturalistically for 12 
weeks from the start of WET, in order to capture, descriptively, more gradual effects of WET and 
potential effects of the combination of ketamine + WET in all patients. Thereafter, they will be 
collected monthly through week 24 from start of WET or until loss of treatment response, for the 
subgroup of participants who demonstrate improvement on the CAPS-5 at the 12-week assessment. 
Aggregate scores prior to adding WET, during WET, and during the maintenance phase (weeks [ADDRESS_1119464]) will be reported descriptively at each time point using the number observed, mean, 
standard deviation, median, and interquartile range. Individual patient trajectories on these 
measures will be plotted over time to explore treatment response and patterns in maintenance of 
response.  Mean change in CAPS-5 scores from baseline and corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals, as well as the proportion of patients with ≥30% improvement from baseline on the CAPS-[ADDRESS_1119465] after comparing each model fit statistic (i.e., Akaike information criterion, AIC) where the 
best fitting model is the model with the lowest corresponding AIC. Once fit is assessed, parameter 
interpretation will commence. 
oIES-R and QIDS-SR with past-24-hour recall – collected only at baseline, before each ketamine 
infusion, [ADDRESS_1119466] infusion, and on the response to ketamine assessment day – will be 
examined descriptively.
The relationship between depressive symptoms and PTSD  will be explored to assess whether 
worsening depressive symptoms correlate with worsening PTSD symptoms and whether there is any 
evidence that the worsening of one precedes the other. Scale scores of both measures will be plotted 
over time together to evaluate trends descriptively.  Fixed and mixed effects regression models will also 
be explored to estimate effects and 95% confidence intervals.  
oFinally, additional analyses might explore differences with a historical comparison group from our 
published repeated IV ketamine study for PTSD (Feder et al 2021).
Aim 2 (Exploratory): To evaluate whether ketamine-induced change in extinction learning predicts 
maintenance of ketamine response over time. We will use regression models to evaluate whether 
ketamine-induced change in extinction learning [improvement in extinction learning between two time 
points: (1) before infusions and (2) after four infusions (prior to starting WET), measured with the 
computerized online  Extinction Learning Task, is associated with change in CAPS-5 at 12 weeks after the 
start of WET. A univariable model of ketamine-induced change on the extinction learning measure 
[discrimination between aversively conditioned (CS+) and safe (CS-) stimuli over the first six blocks of the 
task] and changes in CAPS-5 score will be examined. Beta coefficients and 95% confidence intervals will 
be reported. A significant association between greater ketamine-induced improvement in extinction 
learning and improvement in CAPS-5 scores will be considered supportive of Hypothesis 2.
Computational analyses: Loss expectancy ratings data from each trial of the online extinction task will 
be analyzed via a computational model of latent cause inference developed by [CONTACT_809553], Niv, and 
colleagues.75,76 Importantly, this model has previously been shown to be able to explain individual 
differences in failure of extinction learning in both healthy volunteers and trauma-exposed individuals

which underlying (latent) cause is responsible for their observations, based on a combination of their 
previous experience and prior beliefs about causal structure of the environment. Prior beliefs about the 
causal complexity of the environment are governed by a single concentration parameter, alpha (α). The 
key model output submitted to further analysis is the likelihood for each participant of a model where α 
was allowed to be > 0 (favoring multiple causes), compared to a model where α=0 (single cause 
responsible for all observations), quantified as a log Bayes Factor (logBF; higher values=greater 
likelihood of a multi-cause model). The analysis will be run in MATLAB,84 using publicly-available code 
associated with Gershman and Niv’s published work.75,76
9.4.4 SAFETY ANALYSES
Side effects measured by [CONTACT_33230]-Rated Inventory of Side Effects (PRISE) will be reported

10.1.1 INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS
[IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO 
PARTICIPANTS
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks are given to the 
participant and written or electronic documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting 
intervention/administering study intervention.  The following consent materials are submitted with this 
protocol: HRP-502a, documentation of informed consent.
[IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION
After completing the screening process at DAC through protocol STUDY-10-[ZIP_CODE], potentially eligible 
participants will be invited to participate in a screening visit for this protocol. Informed consent may be 
obtained in person or remotely, using a HIPAA-compliant telehealth platform(e.g., VSee, Doximity, 
HIPAA-Zoom) and the electronic consent survey housed on REDCap. As the proposed study involves 
ketamine infusions, the informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_21114] [INVESTIGATOR_809530]-affiliated 
psychiatrists. Consent may be obtained by a clinical research coordinator prior to administering clinical 
rating scales, self-report scales, the extinction learning task, and/or the medical clearance assessment. 
In this case, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_354240]-affiliated psychiatrist will re-review the consent form with the participant 
and will co-sign the form prior to the participant beginning the first study intervention (ketamine 
infusions). Potential participants will be informed about possible alternatives to participating in the 
study. A release of information will be obtained for review of any available historical and clinical data. 
Authorization is also obtained from each subject in the consent document, permitting the research team 
to use, create, or disclose the subject's PHI for research purposes. The nature of the project, procedures, 
relative risks and benefits, and alternatives to participation in the project will be discussed with the 
individual. The individual will be given ample opportunity to ask any questions they might have. 
Following this discussion, the individual will be given a physical or electronic copy of the consent form to 
review at their leisure, and any remaining questions will be answered. If the individual remains 
interested in the project, written or electronic informed consent is obtained, and medical and 
psychiatric screening procedures are undertaken to confirm eligibility. If the individual decides not to 
participate in this study, a staff member provides reasonable and timely assistance in obtaining an 
alternative referral, if so desired. The decision not to participate does not affect eligibility to participate 
in future studies, to receive treatment at Mount Sinai or at any program serving PTSD populations, or to 
receive treatment on a private basis. Subjects will be also be given the opportunity to withdraw from the 
study at any point. The consent process also includes documentation of permission to obtain previous 
medical records, including contact [CONTACT_370191], pharmacies, and family members.

A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established as an independent body to ensure the 
safety of participants and the validity and integrity of study data for all protocols at DAC that involve 
ketamine administration.
Functions of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)
The primary goals of the DSMB are as follows:
1. To monitor and advise on scientific and ethical issues related to study 
implementation for the protection of human subjects.
2. To review and approve the protocol and subsequently conduct bi-annual reviews to 
determine whether participant safety has been adequately safeguarded.
3. To review procedures and decisions regarding the adequate protection of specific 
patients when investigators remove patients from protocol treatment because of 
serious adverse events (SAEs) or clinical deterioration. 
4. To review progress to see that enrolment and retention goals are being met.
5. To monitor and advise on ethical issues related to serious adverse events.
6. To oversee the confidentiality of data, and quality of data collection, management, 
and analysis.
7. To conduct any interim analysis of study outcome, as well as determining from such 
analyses whether study continuation or discontinuation is warranted. 
 
Membership of the DSMB
The DSMB will be the same DSMB that currently reviews all ongoing ketamine clinical trials conducted 
by [CONTACT_116219], and will be comprised of the same personnel. The DSMB includes the following 
members: Dan Iosifescu, MD (DSMB Chair, Department of Psychiatry, [LOCATION_001] University), Lee Chang, 
MD (Department of Anesthesiology, Baylor College of Medicine), Mark Green, MD (Department of 
Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai), Menachem Wiener, MD (Department of 
Anesthesiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai), and Emilia Bagiella (Statistician, Icahn School 
of Medicine at Mount Sinai). The board will review the project’s data and safety on bi-annual basis and 
report their findings to the PI.  [CONTACT_116239] will work with the study research coordinator to convene the 
DSMB within the first three months of the project period.

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017 5610.4 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT HISTORY
The table below is intended to capture changes of IRB-approved versions of the protocol, including a 
description of the change and rationale. A Summary of Changes table for the current amendment is 
located in the Protocol Title Page. 
Version Date Description of Change Brief Rationale
1.1 3/23/21 Limited maximum dose of ketamine 
to 60 mg per infusion (dose for 
approximately 120 kg body weight)Safety; requested by [CONTACT_8415]
1.2 5/24/21 Removed End of Infusions Medical 
Assessment and changed CAPS-5 
cutoff score from (score ≥ 25) to 
(score ≥ 30).Undue patient burden; not 
necessary for patient safety
For consistency with prior 
studies, and to capture moderate 
severity PTSD
2.0 6/23/21 All eligible participants will receive 
six (6) infusions of ketamine and five 
(5) WET sessions, regardless of 
responder status, and will be assessed 
weekly for 12 weeks following the 
start of WET. After 12 weeks, 
participants who demonstrate ≥ 30% 
improvement at the 12-week 
assessment will be assessed monthly 
for up to 24 weeks following the start 
of WET or until loss of response.
Adding Hood Mysticism Scale and 
Psychological Insight Questionnaires 
to Infusions 1 and 2.Based on our recent meeting 
with a panel of experts in the 
field, and following their 
recommendation, we would like 
to offer all 6 infusions and 5 
WET sessions in order to 
capture more gradual effects of 
WET and the potential effects of 
Ketamine + WET in both 
responders and non-responders 
to ketamine. The primary aim of 
the study remains unchanged.
We are adding the scales to 
assess participant experiences 
during the infusions.

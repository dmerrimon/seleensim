Protocol Number: 017007
Protocol Title: A Safety Trial of Lisocabtagene Maraleucel (JCAR017) for Relapsed and Refractory (R/R) 
B-cell Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) in the Outpatient Setting (TRANSCEND -OUTREACH -007)
Sponsor: Juno Therapeutics ,Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celgene Co rporation.
Study Rationale: 
JCAR017 is a CD19 -directed genetically modified autologous T -cell immunotherapy consisting of a defined 
composition of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T -cell product with flat dosing of both CD4+CAR+ and 
CD8+CAR+ T-cell subset s. Clinical trials of JCAR017 and other CAR T -cell products to date have been 
performed in tertiary care centers that have consolidated the site of care for CAR T -cell administration and 
follow -up. In the US, however, about 80% of patients receiving treatm ent for relapsed or refractory (R/R) 
diffuse large B -cell ly mphoma (DLBCL) in third line are treated outside of these centers. The product profile of 
JCAR017 is conducive to administration and monitoring in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_656897]; however, the safety profile of this product administered in nontertiary care centers has not been 
evaluated. Preliminary data from Juno Study 017001 show that treatment of this patient population with 
JCAR017 demonstrates encouraging efficacy results and a manageable safety profile, includi ng low rates of 
severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity (NT) events, which support outpatient administration 
and outpatient monitoring for toxicity. Early experience with JCAR017 in Study 017001 suggests that outpatient 
administration of JCAR017 can be provided safely with appropriate education and outpatient monitoring, and
can reduce the duration of inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_656898] 40% when compared to inpatient administration (Maloney 
2017). Thus, a s afety  study  to assess the use of JCAR017 in no ntertiary  care outpatient settings is proposed to
confirm these initial findings . 
Study Objectives:
Primary :
To evaluate the safety of JCAR017 administered in nontertiary care centers as reflected by [CONTACT_27891] ≥ 3 
adverse events (AEs) of CRS, NT, prolonged cytopenias, and infections in adult subjects with R/R
aggressive B -cell non -Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)
Secondary:
To evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of JCAR017 , including toxicit y management and 
outcomes 
To evaluate the safety of JCAR017 treatment in subjects monitored asoutpatient s
To assess the antitumor activity of JCAR017
To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of JCAR017
To assess health -related quality of life (HRQoL) and health economics and outcome research (HEOR) 
Explo ratory

 
Study Design: 
This is an open -label, multicenter, Phase 2 study to assess the safety and efficacy of JCAR017 administered in 
nontertiary  care centers to adult subjects with R/R DLBCL, transformed DLBCL arising from indolent
histologies (tDLBCL),high -grade B -cell ly mphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements with 
DLBCL histology ,primary  mediastinal B-cel llymphoma (PMBCL) and follicular lymphoma Grade 3B . There 
will be no control group in this study.

Upon successful JCAR017 product generation, subjects will enter the treatment phase and will receive 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (flu/cy) followed by [CONTACT_304893]017 at a dose 
of 100×106CAR T cells administered intravenously (IV) 2to 7days after completion of lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy. 
After treatment with JCAR017 , subjects will enter post -
treatment follow -up, and will be fo llowed on this study 
for up to [ADDRESS_885056] -treatment follow -up in this protocol, long -
term follow -up (LT FU) for survival, long -term toxicity, and viral vector safety will continue under a separate 
protocol for up to [ADDRESS_885057] dose of JCAR017 .
Oversight
A Safety Review Committee (SRC), comprised of Principal Investigators , and the Sponsor’s medical monitor , 
safety physician, andstatistician will regularly assess the safety of JCAR017 administration throughout the trial. 
The SRC may make recommendations based on safety.

by [CONTACT_6751] (ECHO) or multiple uptake gated acquisitio n (MUGA) scan performed within
1month of the determination of eligibility 
7.Adequate vascular access for leukapheresis procedure (eithe r peripheral line or surgically placed line) 
8.Subjects who have received previous CD19 -targeted therapy must have CD19 -positive lymphoma 
confirmed on a biopsy since completing the prior CD19 -targeted therapy 
9.Females of childbearing potential*must:
a.Have 2 negative pregnancy tests as verified by [CONTACT_737] (one negative serum beta -human 
chorio nic go nadotropin [ß- hCG] pregnancy test result at screening, and within [ADDRESS_885058] dose of lymphodepleting chemotherapy). This applies even if the subject practices true 
abstinence** from heterosexual contact.
b.Either commit to true abstinence** from heterosexual contact [CONTACT_137772], and be able to 
comply  with, effective contraception without interruption. Contraception methods must include [ADDRESS_885059] 12 months following 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy. 
d.There are insufficie ntexposure data to provide any recommendation concerning the duration of 
contraception and the abstaining from breastfeeding following treatment with JCAR017. Any 
decision regarding contraception and breastfeeding after JCAR017 infusion should be discusse d 
with the treating physician.
Note: Highly effective methods are defined as those that result in a low failure rate ( ie, less than 
1% per y ear) w hen used consistently and correctly. The following are examples of highly effective 
and additional effective m ethods of contraception:
Intrauterine device (IUD)
Hormonal (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], injections, implants)
Tubal ligation 
Partner's vasectomy

b.There are insufficient exposure data to provide any recommendation concerning the duration of 
contraception following treatment with JCAR017. Any decision regarding contraception after 
JCAR017 infusion should be discussed with the treating physician.
* A female subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at 
some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has not been naturally 
postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at 
least 12 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).
**True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 
In contrast, periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulatio n methods) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.
11.Subjects must agree to not donate blood, organs, sperm or semen, and egg cells for usage in other 
individuals for at least 1 year following lymphodepletion chemotherapy. There are insuf ficient 
exposure data to provide any recommendation concerning the duration of refraining from tissue 
donation following treatment with JCAR017. Therefore, subjects treated with JCAR017 should not 
donate blood, organs, tissues, and cells for transplantatio n

1.1. B-cell Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma
Approximately  72,000 new cases o f non -Hodgkin lympho ma (NHL) will be diagnosed and 
approximately  20,000 pati ents will  die of  their disease in the [LOCATION_002] in 201 9 (Siegel 
2019). NHL is the seventh most commo n cancer in the US, accoun ting for 4. 2% of new cancers 
and 3. 3% of all cancer -related deaths ( SEER 2019 ). In the US, 80% to 85% of NHL cases are as 
B cell lympho mas and 15% to 20% are T -cell/natural killer cell lympho mas ( NCCN 2019 ).
Diffuse large B -cell lympho ma (DLBCL) is the most commo n aggressive subt ype, const ituting 
approximately  30% of adul t pati ents wi th NHL in the US, Europe, and Japan ( Aoki 2008, Ferl ay 
2013, Novelli 2013, NCCN 2019 ). DLBCL is a disease o f the elderly, wi th a median age at 
diagnosis of approximately 70 y ears ( Issa 2015, Smit h 2015 ), although i t may  rarely  occu r in 
children and young adults. With current treatments, relapsed or refractory  (R/R) aggressive 
B-cell NHL have poor outcomes and the efficacy of salvage options are dim inished in the era of 
rituximab -containing regimens. As such, there remains a need to develop new therapi [INVESTIGATOR_656903] R/R B -cell NHL.
Historically, fi rst-line treatment for patients with high -stage aggressive B -cell NHL, including 
DLBCL, primary mediast inal B -cell lymphom a (PMBCL), and follicular lympho ma Grade 3B, 
has been [ADDRESS_885080] ine, and 
prednisone (R -CHOP), with reduced- intensity dosing regimens recommended for infirm or 
elderly  patients >80 years of age (NCCN 2019 ). Recently, data have been reported that support 
the use of more intensive therapy  for PMBCL in the upfront setting (NCCN 2019 ), and ongoing 
studi es are evaluat ing the effect of augmented RCHOP regimens on outcomes in high -risk 
subtypes of aggressive B -cell NHL.
Approximately  one-third of  DLBCL patients will be refractory  to or relapse after R -CHOP 
therapy  within 5years of di agnosis 
(Cunningham 2013 ). Pati ents at hi gh risk of  relapse to 
R-CHOP include those with a high internat ional prognostic index (IPI) score (Ziepert 2010 , 
Cunningham 2013 ), those with act ivated B -cell or nongerminal center B -cell (GCB) origin (Fu 
2008, Culpin 2013 ), and doubl e -hit DLBCL, now referred to as high- grade B -cell lymphom a 
with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements (Friedberg 2012, Morgan 2013) . In these 
high-risk groups, 50% or less o f patients ar e disease -free at 2 y ears (Ziepert 2010 , 
Culpin 2013 , 
Morgan 2013) . Overall survival (OS) for all DL BCL patients approaches 75% at 5years 
(Cunningham 2013 ); however, in high -risk pat ients, it may beas low as 25% to 30% (double- hit 
and n on-GCB) to 50% (IPI 3 to 5) at 5years (Ziepert 2010 , Culpin 2013 , Morgan 2013).
For pati ents who are refractory  to or rel apse foll owing f ront-line therapy and are eligible for 
autologous hem atopoiet ic stem cell transplant (auto -HSCT), various high -dose, pl atinum -based 
salvage chemotherapy  regimens are recommended (NCCN 2019 ). It is estimated that 35% to 
50% of R/R patients are not suitable for h igh-dose chemotherapy, for reasons including (but not 
limited to) comorbidit ies, poor performance status, or age, and are thus not eligible for HSCT .
These pat ients may be treated wi th a platinum and/or gemcitabine -based regimen such as 
rituximab, or gem citabine and oxaliplat in (R -GemOx), which may be co mbined with invo lved
field radi ation therapy  (El Gnaoui  2007 ), or preferent ially be enrolled in clinical trials testing the 
activit y of novel drugs or combinat ions of agents. The effect iveness of single -agent or

Confident ial and Propri etary 24 Protocol 017007 Amendment 2.0: 17 Mar 2020There are 2 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved treatment as a salvage regimen for 
patients wi th R/R aggressive large B -cell NHL a fter at l east 2 pri or therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014]-axicabtagene 
ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel (discussed further below). Because th esetherapi[INVESTIGATOR_656904] (2017), most data on outcomes in this populat ion are from pat ients treated with 
combinat ions of agents or monotherapy  or experimental  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_656905]. The m ost comm only used t reatment is a combinat ion of ri tuximab wi th 
bendamustine (~25%) (Crump 2017 ). The effect iveness of co mbinat ion and single -agent 
therapi [INVESTIGATOR_53301] m ultiply relapsed, aggressive B -cell NHL is limi ted to a minori ty of those treated; 
specifically, the ORR (12% to 46%) and complete response ( CR) rates (6 %to 38%) are low; 
median PFS (< 6months) and median OS (< 12months) results are equally poor (Pettengell 
2012, Rigacci 2012 , Mounier 2013, Nagle 2013, Wang 2013, Czuczman 2014, Jacobsen 2015, 
Van Den Neste 2016 ).In a study  of the m ost comm only used combinat ion, rituximab and 
bendamustine, an ORR of 45% with a 15.5% CR was reported in pat ients with R/R DLBCL; 
median PFS was only 3.6 m onths (Vacirca 2013). Importantly, m ost pati ents in thi s study  had 
only 1prior therapy  (median = 1, range = [ADDRESS_885081] ively (Nagle 2013, Van Den Neste 2016). In a recent meta -analysis o f DLBCL 
patients who were refractory  to thei r last chem otherapy -containing regimen or who r elapsed 
within [ADDRESS_885082] (the SCHOLAR -1 study ), outcom es were even worse, with 
ORR of 26%, CR rate of 7%, and median OS of 6.3 months (Crum p 2017 ).Therefore, there is 
significant unmet need for patients who have R/R B -cell NHL.
1.2. CD19 as a Therapeutic Target
CD19 i s a 95 -kDa glycoprotein present on B -cells fro m early  devel opment until  different iation 
into plasma cells (Stam enkovic 1988) . It is a m ember of the immunoglobulin superfamily  and a 
component of a B -cell surface signal transduct ion complex that posit ively regulates signal 
transduction through the B -cell r eceptor (Stamenkovic 1988; Brent jens 2011) . 
CD19 i s an attractive therapeut ic target because it is expressed by [CONTACT_304900] B -cell malignancies, 
including B -cell NHL ( Li 1993 , Li 1996 , Davila 2012 ). Importantly , the CD19 ant igen is not 
expressed on hematopoiet ic stem cells or on any normal t issue apart from those of the B -cell 
lineage. 
1.3. CD19 -Targeted Chim eric Antigen Receptors
CD19 -specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are single chain variable fragments (scFv) 
fused to a transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic signaling domains. Expressio n of the 
CD19 -directed CARs in autologous T cells (CAR T) is achie ved by  [CONTACT_656933] a 
recombinant retroviral or lent iviral vector. The CAR i s expressed on the T -cell surface and 
redirects the transfected T cells to CD19- expressing lympho ma cells, leading to CD19 -specific 
tumor cell recognit ion, lysis, cy tokine secret ion, and T -cell pro liferat ion (Sadelain 2013) . In 
clinical studies, CD19 -targeted CAR T cells have demonstrated encour aging act ivity in adult and 
pediatric subjects wi th R/R B -cell acute lymphoblasti c leu kemia (ALL) and B -cell NHL (Porter 
2011, Davila 2014a, Maude 2014, Kochenderfer 2015, Lee 2015, Park 2016, Turtle 2016a,

The final JCAR017 investigational drug product includes 2individually formulated CD4+ CAR+
and CD8+ CAR+ T-cell suspensio ns in media containing dimethyl sulfo xide (DMSO ) that are 
thawed and infused separately. JCAR017 is administered by  [CONTACT_33980] (IV) infusio n.
The CD19 -specific CAR is introduced into autologo us CD4+ and CD8+ T cells ex vivo using a 
replicat ion-incompetent, self -inactivating lent iviral vector. The CD19 -specific CAR consists of 
an scFv binding do main derived fro m a murine CD19 -specific mo noclonal  antibody  (FMC63) 
and the 4- 1BB and CD3ζ chain sig naling do mains. Thetruncated epi[INVESTIGATOR_13392] (EGFRt )protein is expressed as a separate cell surface protein for purposes of cell 
tracking.

1.5. Clinical Experience with JCAR017
Clinical study  017001 i s an ongoing open -label, mult icenter, pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 1 study to determine 
the efficacy and safet y of JCAR017 in adults wit h R/R aggressive B -cell NHL, including

with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements with DLBCL histology , PMBCL, fo llicular 
lympho ma Grade 3B, and mantle cell  lymphom a (MCL ). Two disease -specific cohorts are being 
enrolled: the DLBCL cohort and the MCL cohort. Subjects in the DLBCL cohort must have been 
treated with an anthracycline and rituximab (or other CD20 -targeted agent) and have R/R disease 
afterat least [ADDRESS_885084] undergone lymphodeplet ion chemotherapy  
with low-dose fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day for 3 days) + cycl ophosphamide (300 mg/m2/day for

See the JCAR017 IB for further details.
2. STUDY PURPOSE AND RA
TIONALE
The purpose of this Phase 2 study  is to eval uate the safet y and antitumor activit yof JCAR017
administered in nontertiary  care centers in adult subjects with R/R aggressive B -cell NHL who 
have failed [ADDRESS_885086] consolidated the site of care for CAR T -cell administration and 
follow-up. In the US, however, about 80% of patients receiving treatment for R/R DLBCL in 
third lin e are treated outside of these centers (data on file) . The product profile o f JCAR017 is 
conducive to outpatient administration and toxicit y monitoring in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_656906] y management in an associated hosp ital setting; however, the 
safet y profile of this product administered in nontertiary care centers has not been evaluated. 
Preliminary data from the ongoing Juno Study  017001 show that treatment of this patient 
popul ation with JCAR017 demonstrates encoura ging efficacy results and a manageable safet y 
profile, including low rates of all grade and severe CRS and NT events. This supports outpatient 
administration and toxicit y monitoring, wi th hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4073] n upon symptom s of toxi city. 
Experi ence to date wi th JCAR017 in Study  017001 suggests that outpatient administration of 
JCAR017 can be provi ded safely  with appropri ate educati on and outpatient monitoring and can 
reduce the duration of inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_656898] 40% when co mpared to inpat ient administratio n 
(Maloney 2017 ). Thus, a safet y study  to assess the use of JCAR017 in nontertiary outpatient 
settings is designed to confirm these init ial findings.
2.1. Rationale for JCAR017 Dose Level
In Study  017001, JCAR017 at flat doses of 5 0×106CAR+ T cells and 1 00×106CAR+ T cells 
resul ted in durable responses and demonstrated an acceptable safet y profile in the third -line or 
greater treatment of R/R aggressive DLBCL. 
Addit ionally , as of  [ADDRESS_885087] improved ORR at 3 month s was observed in 
patients treated at Dose Level 2 (1 00×106CAR T +cells) compared to Dose Level 1 
(50×106CAR + Tcells): 62% (16/26; 95% CI :41, 80) v ersus 48% (19/40; 95% CI :31, 64). 
Based on these results, the dose of 1 00×106CAR +T cells has been cho sen for development in 
the third -line setti ng. 
2.2. Rationale for Study Design
The purpose of this Phase 2 study  is to eval uate the safet y and efficacy of JCAR017 administered 
in nonterti ary care centers in adult subjects with R/R aggressive B -NHL (non-Hodgkin ’s 
lympho ma)who have failed at l east 2prior lines of therapy . There is no approved standard of 
care for this populat ion. A nonrando mized design was chosen because of the lack of effect ive 
therapi [INVESTIGATOR_656907] (see Secti on1.1), leading to concerns about comparing against an 
ineffect ive therapy given the promising preliminary efficacy results in third -line subjects (see

likely  to be difficul t, given the lack of efficacy of cu rrently used regimens and the number of 
clinical studies ongo ing in this population. 
2.3. Rationale for Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy
As noted in Section 1.5, preliminar y data available fro m subjects wi th R/R NHL in 
Study [ADDRESS_885088] eting chemotherapy regimen used, 
cyclophosphamide (300 m g/m2/day × 3 day s) combined with fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day × 
3days) in co mbinat ion with JCAR017 , has adequate safet y and good efficacy in subjects wi th 
R/R NHL. This lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy regimen was selected to limit toxicit y and retain 
efficacy , as well as to optimize cellular expansion and efficacy after treatm ent wi th JCAR017 . 
See the JCAR017 IBfor more informat ion. This same flu/cy dose is planned for the current 
[ADDRESS_885089] 
(AESIs) are defined for this study , including CRS, NT, prolonged cy topenia, Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_885090] ivation syndrome (MAS), tumor lysis syndro me (TLS), infusion 
reacti ons, hypogamma globulinemia , autoimmune di sorders, and second primary  malignancies
because these events have been ident ified as potential risks associated with JCAR017 treatm ent 
as well as other CAR T -celltherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
The efficacy endpo ints to be assessed in this study  are standard endpoints for the assessment of 
aggressive B -cell NHL. Di sease response will be determined according to the 
“Reco mmendat ions for Initial Evaluat ion, Staging, and Response Assessment of Hodgkin and 
Non-Hodgkin Lympho ma: The Lugano Classificatio n” (Cheson 2014 ). 
2.5. Risk/Benefit Summary
As di scussed in Sect ion 1.1, options for treatment of R/R DLBCL are limi ted and few patients 
respond to chemotherapy  in the thi rd-line setting and beyo nd. Preliminary data on JCAR017
treatm ent from the ongoing Juno Study  017001 show that treatment of this patient populat ion 
with JCAR017 demonstrates encouraging e fficacy  resul ts and a m anageable safet y profile, 
including low rates of all grade and severe CRS and NT events, which support outpatient

this strategy  can reduce the duration of inpat ient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_656898] 40% when co mpared to

Thus, a safet y study  to assess the use of JCAR017 in nonterti ary outpati ent settings has been 
designed to confirm these init ial findings.
Overall, consi dering the poor prognosis in R/R subjects receiving third- line treatment and the

6. STUDY TREATMENTS
6.1. Leukapheresis
Following enro llment on the study , a leukapheresis collect ion will be performed on each subject 
to obtain a sufficient quant ity of peripheral  blood m ononuclear cells (PBMCs) for the production 
of the JCAR017 invest igational p roduct. Shoul d a technical issue arise during the procedure or in 
the processing o f the product such that it cannot be used for JCAR017 administration, the subject 
may have subsequent collect ion procedure(s) performed. Subjects must con tinue to m eet 
eligib ility requi rements for repeat l eukapheresis; see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for informat ion about 
assessments that do not need to be repeated for addit ional ap heresis.
Please refer to the PBMC collect ion manual for further details.
6.2. Anticancer Treatments between Leukapheresis and 
Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy
If necessary, ant icancer treatment is allowed for disease control while JCAR017 is being 
produced (ie, aft er leukapheresis and prior to lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy). Low dose 
chemotherapy (eg, vincristine, rituximab, cy clophosphamide ≤ 300 mg/m2) isallowed if 
completed at l east 7days prior to the start of lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy. If other agents are 
used, the washout periods noted in the exclusio n criteria (see Section 5.2) must be m et. The use 
of therapeuti c agents wi th little/no evi dence in the scientific literature for DLBCL should be 
discussed wi th the Sponsor. Local  radiation is allo wed to a single lesio n or subset of lesio ns if 
other un -irradiated PET -positive lympho ma lesio ns are present. If ant icancer treatment is 
necessary  during this time , the pretreatm ent PET and computed tomography ( CT)assessments 
and other pretreatment study  procedures (see Section 8.2.4) m ust be performed after the 
anticancer treatment has been completed. The subject must continue to have PET
-posit ive 
disease and meet eligibilit y criteria pertaining to adequate organ funct ion, active infections, 
pregnancy, and washout of prior therapy  before initi ation of lymphodepl eting chemotherapy.
6.3. JCAR017 Investigational Drug Product
The JCAR017 invest igational drug product is co mprised of autol ogous CD8+ and CD4+ T cells 
that express a CD19- specific CAR that are provided as frozen cell suspensio ns for intravenous 
(IV) administration. The JCAR017 invest igational drug product is provide d as 2 individually  
formulated CD4+CAR+ and CD8+CAR+ T-cell suspensio ns in media containing DMSO for 
direct IV administration in equal CAR T -cell quantit ies into the subject.
The CD19 -specific CAR is introduced into autologous CD8+ and CD4+ T cells ex vivo using a 
replicat ion-incompetent, self -inactivating lent iviral vector. The CD19 -specific CAR consists of 
an scFv binding do main derived fro m a murine CD19 -specific mo noclonal  antibody  (FMC63) 
and the 4- 1BB and CD3ζ chain signaling do mains.

6.3.2. Exception Use of Non -confo rming Product
Once a decisio n is made for the except ion use of non -conforming JCAR017, country  specific
requi rements will be fo llowed for the rel ease of a non -conforming JCAR017 product to treat a 
subject enrolled in a JCAR017 clinical trial. For example, approval  from local health authori ties 
and/or IRBs/ECs will be obtained where required. Any subject will need to provide consent by  
[CONTACT_656934]’s IRB approved non -conforming product ICF prior to receiving the non -
conforming JCAR017 product. While subj ects treated wi th non-conforming product will be 
followed as per the Table of Events ( Appendix A ) listed in the protocol, their data will be 
excluded fro m the primary  safety/efficacy evaluable analysis. Their data will be analy zed 
separately  (Secti on 10.2.4 ). 
Subjects treated with non -conforming product will be replaced for the purposes of study  
enrollment of per protocol evaluable subjects.
6.3.3. Dose and Schedule
The dose of JCAR017 will be 100×106CAR+ T cells. JCAR017 will be administered 2 to 7 days 
after completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . Subjects mus t 
meet the criteria for treatment specified in Sect ion8.2.5.[ADDRESS_885113] eting chemotherapy (see Sect ion8.2.5.1 ). The l ast dose of lymphodeplet ing

Monitoring
Prophylactic treatment/measures are strongly recom mended for subjects at risk for TLS , per 
institutional or clinical  standards. Supportive care for the management of CRS is detailed i n 
 In som e cases, tocilizumab, an anti -IL-
6R-antibody , may be requi red to treat 
toxicities such as severe cy tokine release syndrome ( sCRS ).  Please refer to currently approved 
RoActem ra® Summary  of Product Characteristics ( RoActemra SmPC, 2015). It is important to 
understand that the JCAR017 Management Guideli nes f orCytokine Release Syndro me and 
Neurotoxi city and the recommended use of tocilizumab is different from the CRS management 
algorithms for the approved CAR Ts. The Sponsor requires that all JCAR017 sites must have at 
least [ADDRESS_885121] are required in each pharmacy  facility. It is recommended to resupply in case 
tocilizumab is given.
The preferred dose to intervene in subjects with sCRS is 8 mg/kg. Other anti -IL-[ADDRESS_885122] 
shoul d be considered in the event of sCRS not resp onding to tocilizumab. Dosing of any other 
anti-IL-6 agent should be per prescribing informat ion.
Prophylactic treatment measures for neurological toxicit ies are detailed in

7. POTENTIAL RISKS AND MANAGEMENT OF TOXICI TIES 
A summary  of management of potential treatment toxicit y is provided below.  See th e JCAR017
IB for a complete discussio n of potenti al risks associ ated wi th JCAR017 .Cytokine rel ease 
syndro me (CRS) and neuro toxicity(NT) are associated with CAR T -cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Celgene has 
developed specific toxicit y management guidelines (TMG) for CRS and NT associated with 
Celgene cellular products based on current clinical experience across the clinical development 
programs  These reco mme ndations are based on the CRS revised grading system 
(Lee, 2014 ) and the CTCAE and need to be used for grading of CRS and NT to guide 
management in thistrial. 
If available and adopted as per site standard practice, CRS and N T grading according to the 
American Societ y for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy  (ASTCT) Consensus Grading 
System  (Lee, 2019 ) shoul d also be recorded in the e CRF to i nform  future m odificati ons of  the 
management guidelines.
7.1. Cytokine Release Syndrome 
Administrati on of  CAR T cells, such as JCAR017 , is associated with CRS. Cytokine release 
syndro me is characterized by [CONTACT_242679], fat igue, nausea, headache, dyspnea, tachycardia, rigors, 
hypotension, hypoxia, myalgia/arthralgia, and anorexia. Clinical symptoms and severit y of CRS

With JCAR017 , CRS usually occurs within 2 weeks after infusio n (Abramson 2017 ).
Fever, especially  high f ever ( ≥38.5°C or ≥101.3 °F), is a commo nly-observed 
hallmark of CRS, and many  features of CRS mimic infection. Hence, infect ion must 
be considered in all subjects presenting wit h CRS symptoms and appropriate cultures 
must be obtained and empi[INVESTIGATOR_304852].
Less commo n symptom s associ ated wi th CRS include cardiac dysfunct ion, adul t

disseminated intravascular coagulation, and capi[INVESTIGATOR_304853] e. 
Neurotoxi cityhas been observed con current ly wit h CRS.
CRS has been reported in a few cases to be associated with findings of 
MAS /hemophag ocytic lymphohist iocytosis ( HLH), and the physio logy of the 
syndro mes may overlap.
Please refer to for a detailed description of CRS, grading, and treatment 
recommendat ions.If available and adopted as per site standard practice, CRS and neurological 
toxicity (NT) grading according to the ASTCT Consensus Grading System ( Lee, 2019 ) should 
also be recorded in the eCRF to inform future modificat ions of the management guidelines.
7.2. Fever
The possibilit y of CRS shoul d be considered for all subjects with fever (≥38.0ºCor ≥100.4 ºF) 
following JCAR017 treatment. Subjects should be mo nitored cl osely  for hem odynamic 
instabilit y and changing neuro logic status. Febrile subjects, neutropenic or otherwise, shoul d be 
evaluated promptly andmanaged per inst itutional or standard c linical practice. 
The possibilit y of CRS shoul d be considered for all subjects with fever fo llowing JCAR017
infusio n. Subjects should be monitored closely for hemodynamic instabilit y and changing 
neuro logic status.
7.3. Neurologic Toxicities
CAR T -cell therapy is associated with unique neurologic toxicit ies. Neurol ogic symptoms may 
include altered mental status, aphasia, altered level of consciousness, and seizures or seizure -like 
activit y. With JCAR017 to date, the start of neurologic symptoms has been noted b etween 3 to 
23 day s (median 10 days) ( Abramson 2017 ) after CAR T -cell infusio n and, in severe cases, may  
requi re admissio n to the ICU for frequent monitoring, respi[INVESTIGATOR_304856], or intubat ion for 
airway protecti on. The sympt oms are variable and generally  occur as CRS i s reso lving or after 
CRS resolut ion.
Please refer to for detailed descript ions of neuro logic toxi cities, grading, and 
treatm ent recommendat ions. Note: Tocilizumab is not indicated for the treatment of neuro logic 
toxicities.

Confident ial and Propri etary 44 Protocol 017007 Amendment 2.0: 17 Mar [ZIP_CODE].4. Macrophage Activation Syndrome
Macrophage activation syndro me is a serious disorder potentially associated with uncontrolled 
activat ion and proliferat ion of CAR T cells and subsequent activation of macrophages (See the 
JCAR017 IB for further background about MAS). Macrophage activat ion syndrome is t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_656916] -grade, n on-remitt ing fever, cytopenias, and hepatospleno megaly. 
Laboratory  abnorm alities found in MAS include elevated inflammatory  cytokine levels, serum 
ferritin, soluble IL -2 receptor (sCD25), triglycerides, and decreased circulat ing NK cells. Other 
findings in clude variable levels of transaminases, signs of acute liver failure, coagulopathy , and 
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy . There are no definit ive diagnost ic criteria for MAS; it 
is typi[INVESTIGATOR_656917] 
(Schulert, 2015). While there is considerable overlap in clinical manifestations and laboratory  
findings between MAS and CRS, other dist inguishing MAS physical findings such as 
hepatospl enomegaly and lymphaden opathy  are not comm on in adul t subjects treated wi th 
activated T cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Subjects treated with JCAR017 should be monitored for MAS, and cytokine -directed therapy  
shoul d be considered as clinically  indicated .
7.5. Infusion Reactions
Administrati on of  JCAR017 m ay cause infusio n reactions, including fever, rigors, rash, urticaria, 
dyspnea, hypotension, and/or nausea. To minimize the risk of infusio n reactions, all subjects 
shoul d be prem edicated wi th acetaminophen and diphenhydramine. In case a subject cann ot 
tolerate di phenhydramine, an equivalent ant ihistamine may be substituted. Mild infusio n 
reacti ons shoul d be managed expectant ly wit h ant ipyretics, ant ihistamines, and ant iemetics. 
Corti costeroi ds shoul d be avoi ded because o f the potenti al impact on effi cacy o f infused 
JCAR017 cells. Rigors may be treated with meperidine.
The fo llowing gui delines shoul d be f ollowed for infusio n reactions:
Grade 1: administer symptomat ic treatment; continue JCAR017 administration both 
CD8+CAR+ and CD4+CAR+ co mponents at th e sam e dose and rate
Grade 2: stop administration of JCAR017; administer symptomatic treatment; resume 
JCAR017 administration of both CD8+CAR+ and CD4+CAR+ components at a reduced rate 
only after symptom s reso lve
Grade 3: stop administration of JCAR017, ad minis ter symptomatic treatment, and resume 
JCAR017 administration of both CD8+CAR+ and CD4+CAR+ components at a reduced rate 
of administrati on only after symptoms reso lve. If a Grade 3 reaction recurs, discont inue 
JCAR017; no further CD8+CAR+ or CD4+CAR+ c omponents of JCAR017 should be 
administered
Grade 4: discontinue administration of JCAR017 and administer symptomat ic treatment as 
necessary; no further CD8+CAR+ or CD4+CAR+ components of JCAR017 should be

7.7. B-cell Aplasia
B-cell aplasia is an expected potential o ff-tumor, on -target toxi city. Prol onged B -cell aplasia has 
been observed in other CD19- directed CAR T cell programs ( Davila, 2014; Grupp, 2013 ). Serum
immunogl obulin levels will be obtained fro m all subjects prior to and at various timepo ints 
following JCAR017 infusio n. Hy pogammaglo bulinemic subjects (serum IgG < 500 mg/dL) 
shoul d be considered for IV immunoglobulin replacement therapy  per inst itutional guidelines.

Severe (Grade ≥ 3) cy topeni as including anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and 
thrombocy topenia, can occur wi th JCAR017 andlymphodepl eting chemotherapy and delayed

symptom atic treatment with antimicrobial, ant ifungal, ant i-pneum ocyst ic, and/or antiviral 
therapi [INVESTIGATOR_244836] d be considered per l ocal institutional guidelines.
7.10. Graft -versus -host Disease

generat ion of replication -competent lent iviruses (RCL) during manufacturing is st ill a 
possibilit y. Modern vector production systems have been improved to reduce the risk of RCL 
generat ion. To date, there have been no reports of RCL generated during lentiviral vector 
manufacturing, which may be due in part, to the use of self- inact ivating vectors such as the 
lentiviral vector used in the production of JCAR017 (Rothe 2013 ).
Concerns for possible vector integration into the host genome have arisen due to preclinical 
studi es that have shown retrovirus -mediated malignant tr ansformat ion in mice (Li 2002 ,Modlich
2005) and monkeys (Donahue 1992 ), and a single clinical study  reporting development of 
leukem ia in subjects wi th X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency who received retroviral -
modified CD34+ hematopoiet ic stem cells (Hacein -Bey-Abina 2003 ), including [ADDRESS_885132] who 
died (Couzin 2005) . Of note, no instances of RCL generat ion during production or lent ivirus -
mediated m alignant transformation in animals or humans have been reported to date.
Data has recent ly been published on the integration sites o f retroviral and lent iviral vectors used 
for T-cell modificat ion in clinical trials (Wang 2009, Scholler 2012 , McGarrit y 2013) . No 
clonali ty of integrati on si tes was observed. In addi tion, there di d not appear to be enrichment of 
integrat ion sites near genes invo lved in clo nal expansio n or persistence.
Per the FDA Reco mbinant DNA Advisory Co mmittee guidelines (FDA 2000 ), all subjects will 
be followed in this study  for RCL and vector sequences for up to 15 years fo llowing JCAR017
treatm ent as part of a LTFU protocol. All subjects will be mo nitored f or evi dence o f unexpected 
JCAR017 expansi on and the em ergence of a new second primary malignancy (SPM) , 
particularly one of T-cell origin. Invest igators must con tact the Sponsor immediately if an 
unexpected pattern of JCAR017 expansio n and/or a new SPM arises. 
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interest and must be reported as 
serious adverse events. This includes any  new malignancies, regardless of causal relationship to 
JCAR017, occurring throughout the subject’s ent ire par ticipati on in the study . If a subject 
develops a new malignancy, the Sponsor will request that a tumor sample, and blood samples are 
collected (see 017001 laboratory  manual ).See Secti on8.3.[ADDRESS_885133] ion 8.2.11 .

Subjects m ay undergo an opti onal cycle of salvage l ow-dose chemotherapy (eg, vincrist ine, 
rituximab, cyclophosphamide ≤ 300 m g/m2) or noncurat ive standard -of-care chem otherapy for
disease control  prior to l eukapheresis and/or while JCAR017 is being manufactured (ie, between 
leukapheresis and lymphodeplet ing ch emotherapy ). Exam ples of acceptable regimens include:
Bendamust ine plus rituximab (BR)
Rituximab, cy clophosphamide, etoposi de, procarbazine, and prednisone (R -CEPP)
Rituximab, cy clophosphamide, epi [INVESTIGATOR_14962], and prednisone (R -CEOP)
Rituximab, gem citabine, ci splat in, and dexamethasone (R -GDP)
Rituximab and l enalido mide
Other regimens may be acceptable after discussio n with the Sponsor. 
Any selected regimen should be administered per inst itutional guidelines. Chemotherapy given 
after leukapheresis to m aintain disease control  must be stopped ≥ [ADDRESS_885136] eting chemotherapy, and the washout periods noted in the exclusio n criteria (see 
Secti on 8.2.3 ) must be m et. The use of therapeutic agents with litt le/no evidence in the scient ific 
literature for DLBCL should be discussed wit h the Sponsor. If clinically indicated, local 
radiation is allowed to a single lesio n or subset of lesio ns if other un -irradiated PET -posit ive 
lympho ma lesions are present.
If bridging ant icancer treatment is given, subjects must continue to meet eligibilit y criteria 
pertaining to adequate organ funct ion, active infectio ns, pregnancy , washout of pri or therapy  
prior to lymphodeplet ion, and PET -avid disease. If the subject has not had any cardiotoxic 
medicat ions or radi otherapy  in which fields include the heart, screening assessments of cardiac 
funct ion (MUGA/ECHO) do not need to be repeated. The pretreatment evaluat ions in 
Secti on8.2.[ADDRESS_885137] repeat eligibilit y assessments (some procedures may not be required

9. SAFETY MONITORING AN D REPORTING
9.1. Definitions
9.1.1. Adverse Event
In accordance with the Internat ional Council for Harmonisat ion (ICH) E2A guideline, and 
21Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §312.32, an AE is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence in a clinical study  subject administered a pharmaceut ical product which does not 
necessarily have a causal relat ionship wi th this trea tment.
9.1.2. Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is defined as an event that, at any  dose, meets any  of the cri teria in Table 5. Special 
considerations for SAE reporting are presented in Table 6.
Table 5: Definitions of Serious Adverse Events
Criteria Description
Fatal: The AE resulted in death
Life-threatening: The AE placed the subject at immediate risk of death (This classification does 
not apply to an AE that hypothetically might have caused death if it had been 
more severe).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolongation of 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:The AE resulted in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] (See 
Table 6below).
Disability/incapacity: The AE resulted in a disability, significant incapacity, or substantial disruption 
of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions
Congenital Anomaly/birth 
Defect:The AE was an adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a sub ject exposed to the 
study treatment regimen before conception or during pregnancy
Medically Important : The AE was a medically important event that did not meet any of the above 
criteria, but may have jeopardized the subject and may have required medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above (examples 
include allergic bronchospasm that required treatment in an emergency room, 
seizures that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or blood dyscrasias)

do require SAE reportingThis classification does not apply for the following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]:
Admissions for social or situational reasons (eg, no place to stay, live too 
far away  to come for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042]) in the absence of any clinical AE
Admissions at the discretion of the investigator for administration of 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy or JCAR017
Admissions for elective or preplanned treatment for a pre -existing 
conditio n that is unrelated to the condition under study and has not 
worsened since providing informed consent
Admissions for routine treatment (eg, platelet transfusion) or monitoring 
of the condition under study not associated with any deterioration in 
conditio n
Admissions for routine procedures (eg, bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) 
assoc iated with the disease under study 
Emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in 
admission, unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above
AE = adverse event; EOS = end of study; FDA = Food and Drug Administration; SAE = serio us adverse event .
9.1.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest
An AESI (serious or nonserious) is one of scient ific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product, for which ongo ing monitoring and rapid co mmunicat ion by [CONTACT_656946]. Such an event might warrant further invest igation in order to 
characterize and understand it.
Adverse events of special interest may include, but are not limited to ,CRS, NT, prolonged 
cytopeni a,Grade ≥ 3infect ions, TLS, MAS, infusion reacti ons, hypogammaglo bulinemia ,
autoimmune disorders, and second primary malignancies (see for CRS/NT). These 
events have been ident ified as potential risks associated with JCAR017 treatm ent as well as other 
CAR T -cell t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Details of the AESIs definit ions are provided in the SAP.
Prolonged cy topeni a(laboratory  values), is define d as the occurrence of Grade ≥ 3 cytopeni a not
resolved by  [CONTACT_656947] 29 visit, based on l aboratory  resul ts of low hem oglobin, absol ute neutrophil 
count decreased, and platelet count decreased . The frequency of subjects experiencing each 
individual laboratory  abnorm ality and the total  number wi th at least1abnormalit y will  be 
summarized, as will recovery  from prolonged cy topenia after Day 29. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Grading and Intensity of Adverse Events
Adverse events, with the except ion of CRS, will be graded using the CTCAE, Version 4.03
(https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applicat ions/ctc.ht m
). CRS will be 
graded according to the grading scale adapted from Lee (Lee 2014) ,  
The reported verbat im term should be the most descript ive medical diagnosis , even if it does not 
match the CTCAE term used for assigning severi ty.

an AE, while ‘serious’ is a regulatory  defini tion and serves as a gui de to the Sponsor for defining 
regul atory  reporting obligations.
9.2. Relationship to Study Drug
The assessment of the relationship of an AE/SAE to lympho depleting chemotherapy  and 
JCAR017 (related or not rel ated) is a clinical decisio n based on all available informat ion and the 
following considerations:
Related: There i s a reasonable possibilit y and/or evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship 
between the study  drug and the AE/SAE and no other more likely alternat ive 
cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], disease complicat ions, etc.) is suspected.
Not 
related:There i s no reasonable possibilit y and/or evi dence to suggest a causal relat ionship 
between study  drug and the AE/SAE and another more likely alternative cause 
(concomitant drugs or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], disease complicatio ns, etc.) is suspected.
9.3. Recording Adverse Events 
Adverse events/SAE are recorded on the eCRF in accordance with the reporting criteria for 
different time periods as defined in Section 9.4. Each AE/ SAE i s to be evaluated for:
Durati on (onset and resolut ion dates) 
Severit y, including grade changes during the 90 -day period fo llowing JCAR017
administration, as per the eCRF complet ion gui delines (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
Outcom e 
Seriousness (see Sect ion 9.1.2 )
Causal relat ionship wi th lymphodepl etingchem otherapy  or JCAR017 (see 
Secti on9.2)
9.3.1. Recording a Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms
Whenever possible, a unifying diagnosis should be reported, as opposed to a list ing o f individual 
symptoms. However, symptoms should be grouped into a diagnosis only if each sign or symptom 
is a medically  confirmed com ponent of that diagnosis as evidenced by  [CONTACT_656948] m edical 
textbooks. If any aspect of a sign or sym ptom  does not fi t into a cl assic pattern of the diagnosis, 
the individual symptom should be reported as a separate AE/SAE.
One except ion to reporting a diagnosis as opposed to symptoms is the event of CRS. If a subject 
experiences an event of CR S, a di agnosis of CRS and any  grade changes for the event of CRS 
shoul d be reported as an AE. Individual signs and symptoms of CRS and grade changes for those 
signs and symptoms should be entered as CRS Symptoms in the eCRF. 
When manifestations o f neuro logical toxicities appear in the presence of CRS or alone, those 
manifestations should be reported as separate AEs.

Any laboratory  abnorm ality (eg, clinical chemistry or hematology ) or other ab norm al assessment 
findings (eg, ECG or vital signs) that meets any o f the following cri teria shoul d be recorded as an 
AE or SAE:
Requi res m edical  or surgi cal interventi on (incl uding transfusio ns or growth factors)

9.3.3. Recording Serious Adverse Events
The fo llowing shoul d be considered when recording SAEs:
Death i s an outcome of an event. The event that resulted in death should be recorded 
in the eCRF and reported on the SAE Report Form.
For hospi[INVESTIGATOR_304867], the illness leading to the 
surgi cal or di agnosti c procedure shoul d be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure 
itself. 
When progression of the disease under invest igation meets any o f the seri ousness 
criteria, i t will  be reported as an individual SAE. When reporting SAE terms related 
to disease progression, specific manifestations of the progression (eg, “malignant 
pleural  effusi on,” “lymphadenopathy  from underlying non-Hodgkin lympho ma”) 
shoul d be reported, rather than the general term “disease progression.”
9.3.4. Death Reports
All deaths must be reported on the Death eCRF. Deaths due to PD will not be reported as an 
SAE unless considered related to a study  drug.
Any AEs l eading to death from the time the subject provides informed consent through 90 days 
after the JCAR017 infusio n shoul d be reported according to Table 7.
Deaths that occur more than 90 day s after JCAR017 infusio n will  be captured on the Death

a) Serum pregnancy test must be done within 48 hours prior to lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy. 
b) Not done for subjects who have received subsequent anticancer therapy .
c) Not required if done at the study site for screening and no intervening antitumor 
therapy  has been administered. If required, recommended within [ADDRESS_885178] be performed after completion of the intervening anticancer treatment and as 
close as possible to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy (recommended within 
7-14 days prior to start).
d) If clinically indicated .
e) Required only for subjects with suspected or confirmed CNS involvement, or as 
clinically indicated .
f) All evaluations and laboratory as sessments must be done prior to administration of 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy or JCAR017 .
g) To be done on each day of lymphodepleting chemotherapy .Prior to first dose, it 
must be confirmed that the subject meets criteria for lymphodepleting chemotherapy
as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
h) Weight only .
i) Measured within approximately [ADDRESS_885179] hour and hourly (±15 
minutes) for the next 2 hours. Continue to monitor vital signs after this point until 
stable and as clinically indicated .
j) Routine neurological examination only .
k)For subjects with tDLBCL, a pathology report from the biopsy of their current 
relapsed disease is requi red.
l) PET and CT scan may be performed Day 22 to Day 29.
m) If CR is achieved, only CT scans will be required. Upon progression/relapse or 
initiation of another anticancer treatment, PET and CT scans are no longer required. 
Subjects who receive HSCT post-JCAR017 but no other anticancer treatment should 
continue to undergo PET and/or CT scans in accordance with the previous 
2sentences. PET scans should be performed to verify PD.
** MUGA/ECHO must be repeated after any intervening cardiotoxic anticanc er 
therapy .n) Not required if CR previously documented. 
o) If more than 1% of cells in test samples collected at the Day [ADDRESS_885180] will be asked 
to provide another blood sample 3 months later for follow -up testing.
p) If a subject receives lymphodepleting therapy but not JCAR017 , all AEs/SAEs 
should be recorded/reported for [ADDRESS_885181] dose of lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy. For subjects starting a subsequent nonchemotherapy -containing 
anticancer therapy (eg, checkpoint inhibitors, IMIDs) prior to 90 days following 
final JCAR017 administration, all AE/SAEs will be collected after initiation of the 
subsequent therapy for 90 days following final JCAR017 infusion or 30 days 
following subsequent therapy, whichever is longer. For subjects starting a 
subsequent chemotherapy -containing anticancer therapy prior to 90 days following 
final JCAR017 administration, only AEs and SAEs related to JCAR017 and/or 
protocol -mandated procedures must be recorded/reported after initiation of 
subsequent therapy.
q) Starting from [ADDRESS_885182] dose of JCAR017 until EOS visit .
r) Ifany of the following clinical conditions are observed, an SAE should be reported 
unless the event can be definitely attributed to an alternative cause: new/secondary 
malignancies; new onset or exacerbation of a pre -existing neurologic disorder; new 
onset of a rheumatologic or other autoimmune disorder; new onset of a hematologic 
disorder; rare and unexpected disorders with an unknown etiology (eg, Guillain -
Barré, Stevens -Johnson syndrome) .
s) Not required if B -cell recovery documented without recent admini stration of 
intravenous immune globulin .
t) Samples may be archived if all samples collected within the first year after the last 
dose of JCAR017 were tested and were negative for RCL.
u) Prior to dose, it must be confirmed that the subject meets criteria for JCAR017
treatment as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
v) Not required if the subject is medically incapacitated and/or medically unable to 
complete .
w) Pregnancy test and contraceptive counseling for women of childbearing potential. 
x) Immunogen icity Assessment; samples will be processed to plasma and analyzed 
for the presence of antibodies that bind to the extracellular region of JCAR017.

   1 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE Section 1 should be no more than 3 – 5 pages. Refer the reader to the applicable grant, or attached literature references for more detailed information.  Introduction Tinnitus is a medical condition with a wide variety of causes that is characterized by [CONTACT_319580], often described as ringing or buzzing, without an external stimulus.1 It is extremely common, and has a prevalence in the [LOCATION_002] ranging from 10% to 15% of the population.[ADDRESS_394322] on quality of life, with individuals suffering from the condition manifesting higher rates of anxiety, depression, and lowered self esteem3-5.  Pulsatile tinnitus is a specific subtype of tinnitus with limited treatment options. It is defined as a “whooshing” sound that pulsates in rhythm with the patient’s heartbeat and generally manifests unilaterally.6 Pulsatile tinnitus affects over 10% of the total tinnitus population, and it has a variety of both vascular, specifically venous, and nonvascular causes.[ADDRESS_394323] for venous pulsatile tinnitus consists of the physician lightly compressing the internal jugular vein ipsilateral to the side of symptoms.9 For patients with any venous cause of pulsatile tinnitus, symptoms will be relieved upon compression of the ipsilateral internal jugular vein and return when pressure is released by [CONTACT_4921], a diagnostic finding with 93% sensitivity.[ADDRESS_394324] or Intervention The current FDA approved internal jugular vein compression collar, marketed as the Q collar, is manufactured by Q30 Innovations Home. It is designed to be worn around the neck of individuals aged 13 and older. It functions by [CONTACT_319585]’s bilaterally, safely increasing intracranial volume and intracranial pressure. The FDA approved neck collar device is made of a thermoplastic elastomer that is specifically fitted to an individual to provide mild internal jugular vein compression.[ADDRESS_394325] was developed and confirmed with ultrasonography to confirm appropriate fit and compression of the vein based on an athlete’s neck circumference.12       

   
   2 1.2 Findings from Non-Clinical and Clinical Studies  (This section is only applicable for drugs, biologics and devices) 1.2.1 Non-Clinical Studies The landmark paper by [CONTACT_319586]. (2012) and Turner et al. (2012) demonstrated significant reduction in axonal injury following internal jugular vein compression in a rodent concussion model and this catapulted the translatable research specifically in concussion mitigation.[ADDRESS_394326]. Matthew Dedmon, the collar was identified as a potential intervention for venous pulsatile tinnitus. 1.2.2 Clinical Studies The use of jugular compression collars (Q-collar) during physical activity has recently been shown to reduce white matter alterations associated with head impact exposure in male and female athletes in sports including football, hockey, and soccer. Ongoing trials have demonstrated improvements in concussion biomarkers through clinical and radiographic measures.13, 16-17  1.3 Relevant Literature and Data Pulsatile Tinnitus: Overview, Pathophysiology, Diagnosis  Pulsatile Tinnitus is the auditory perception of rhythmic noises in time with the heartbeat.[ADDRESS_394327] common causes of pulsatile tinnitus, particularly structural and flow abnormalities in one or multiple intracranial or extracranial venous structures secondary to intracranial hypertension or anatomical variation.22  Non-invasive imaging is an effective means of diagnosing pulsatile tinnitus, successfully identifying relevant phenomena in 40% to 70% of cases.23-24  Furthermore, physical exam alone can distinguish venous causes from other ideologies of pulsatile tinnitus.9 Specifically, relief of symptoms upon temporary manual neck compression of the ipsilateral IJV detects venous etiology with 93% sensitivity, a finding that is replicated with less sensitivity by a Valsalva maneuver or by [CONTACT_319587]’s head toward the side lateralizing with pulsatile tinnitus.9-[ADDRESS_394328] differential of specific etiologies. All etiologies involve disturbed flow of an internal jugular vein and/or one of the veins or sinuses that drain into it.30 The turbulent flow is conducted by [CONTACT_319588], resulting in the perception of pulsating sound.25-26 Broadly, these etiologies and their treatments can be classified by [CONTACT_319589]: the lateral sinuses, emissary veins, jugular bulb, and internal jugular vein.[ADDRESS_394329] all been employed for symptomatic management with limited success.11  Surveys and Scales:  The Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) is a 25-item validated survey that evaluates the degree of impact a patient’s tinnitus has on their quality of life.[ADDRESS_394330] line survey for systemic impacts of tinnitus and is attached at the end of this proposal. In addition, NIH validated patient reported outcome measurement information system (PROMIS) questionnaires on anxiety, depression, physical function, and satisfaction will be administered before and after the treatment period to evaluate the collar’s broader impact on patient quality of life (see end of proposal).28 Additionally, a custom tinnitus intensity scale modeled after the numerical pain scale with be used to assess relief. Lastly, a single item Likert scale inquiring about use of the collar when symptoms present will be applied to evaluate adherence.   1.4 Compliance Statement This study will be conducted in full accordance with all applicable University of North Carolina Research Policies and Procedures and all applicable Federal and state laws and regulations All epi[INVESTIGATOR_48478]. The investigators will perform the study in accordance with this protocol, will obtain consent and assent, and will report unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others in accordance with University of North Carolina IRB Policies and Procedures and all federal requirements. Collection, recording, and reporting of data will be accurate and will ensure the privacy, health, and welfare of research subjects during and after the study.  2 STUDY OBJECTIVES The purpose of the study is to determine the preliminary efficacy of an internal jugular vein compression collar for treating pulsatile tinnitus. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], if demonstrative of efficacy, will be used to apply for a multicenter grant. 2.1 Primary Objective (or Aim) The primary objective of this study is to determine if an internal jugular vein compression collar can relieve symptoms of venous pulsatile tinnitus. 2.2 Secondary Objectives (or Aim) The secondary objectives are to:  • Determine if the collar effect varies with time • Evaluate changes in quality of life as a result of collar use • Compare home use with in clinic use [ADDRESS_394331]: Screen for eligibile participants through EPIC First Visit: Consent, collect voluntary demographic and QOL data, fit collar, educate on use, evaluate symptom relief Home Use:  
   
   [ADDRESS_394332] Visit: Consent, Fitting, Education, Evaluation, Scales During the first visit, potential participants identified through screening will be invited by a member of the study team to participate. If they agree, they will fill out consent forms, demographics, and preliminary QOL scales through REDCAP, as well as a baseline tinnitus intensity scale. At this point, a clinicial research team member not associated with their care will supervise fitting of the collar. The patient will be monitored for 10 minutes for adverse effects, then asked to complete the scale once more. Lastly, the patient will be educated on fitting and use of the collar, specifically not to use for more than 4 hours daily nor while sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], given the collar with its packaging and its instructions, and sent home for home use. 3.1.3 At Home Use (2 weeks) Through a REDCAP link to their email or mobile device, the participants will daily record length of time using collar, average tinnitus intensity with and without collar, and any discomfort/adversity with collar use for 14 days consecutively. 3.1.4 Second Visit: Re-evaluation and Exit Scales The participant will undergo refitting of the collar and evaluation of symptomatic relief under medical supervision once again. The participant will then complete QOL surveys again and an exit survey. This concludes participation. 3.[ADDRESS_394333] Study Participation 16 days: 1 day for consent, fitting, and initial evlauation; 14 days for at home use, and 1 day for follow up.  3.2.2 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected The study will be conducted at approximately [ADDRESS_394334] Inclusion Criteria 1) Male or female age 18 years and older 2) Diagnosis of venous pulsatile tinnitus 3) Patient at UNC ENT Meadowmont Clinic 3.3.[ADDRESS_394335] Exclusion Criteria • Increased presence of acid in the body or excessive blood alkalinity • Open head injury (including in or around the eye) within the past six months • Pseudotumor cerebri (false brain tumor) • Presence of brain or spi[INVESTIGATOR_171495] • Known seizure disorder • Known airway obstruction • Increased likelihood of blood clotting (coagulation)

   6 Patient reports daily average tinnitus intensity with and without collar, length of use, and any adverse events through REDCAP email/text link Continues daily for [ADDRESS_394336] Completion/Withdrawal Example: Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their care.  They may also be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator for lack of adherence to study treatment or visit schedules, development of exclusion criteria, or adverse events  The Investigator or the Faculty Advisor may also withdraw subjects who violate the study plan, or to protect the subject for reasons of safety or for administrative reasons.  It will be documented whether or not each subject completes the clinical study. If the Faculty Advisor becomes aware of any serious, related adverse events after the subject completes or withdraws from the study, they will be recorded in the source documents and on the CRF. 4.2.[ADDRESS_394337] Review Diagnosis of venous pulsatile tinnitus Inclusion/Exclusion criteria Year of Birth Time since diagnosis (chronicity of current disease) 5.1.2 Physical Examination • Date of birth • Gender • Race 5.2 Efficacy Evaluations 5.2.1 Diagnostic Tests, Scales, Measures, etc. • Primary endpoint: symptom relief o Tinnitus aural intensity scale before and after collar administration at each visit and once daily for with collar and without collar intensity • Secondary endpoint: QOL Impact o Tinnitus Handicap Index (Once at beginning of study, once at end) o Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scales in depression, anxiety, physical function, and satisfaction • Secondary endpoint: Temporality o Aural intensity scale submissions will be plotted and compared over time course of study • Secondary endpoint: Homes vs. clinic use o Supervised tinnitus intensity scale measurements will be compared to at home measurements to evaluate if perception of symptomatic intensity varies with environment 5.3 Safety Evaluation Example: Subject safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_319590]-supervised fitting period at the beginning of the study and by [CONTACT_319591]-being or onset of new symptoms and immediate reporting of that occurrence to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_319575]. 
   
   8 6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 6.1 Primary Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint will be the change in tinnitus intensity with and without the collar averaged within participants for each completion and across participants the study and 6.2 Secondary Endpoints Secondary endpoints will include the following: • The change in participant quality of life • The effect of time on symptomatic relief •  The effect of medical supervision on symptomatic relief • Adverse events (none are expected; however, the unlikely occurrence will be tabulated or a lack thereof shall be reported)  6.[ADDRESS_394338] descriptive summaries (e.g. means and standard deviations for continuous variables such as age and percentages for categorical variables such as gender). 6.3.2 Efficacy Analysis The primary analysis will be based on an intention to treat approach and will include all subjects who complete the study.   The primary efficacy endpoint will be the change in tinnitus intensity with and without the collar, averaged within and across each patient’s completion of the tinnitus scales. This means that there will be [ADDRESS_394339].  Secondary endpoints will include the following: • Temporality of symptom relief o Subjects with and without collar scores will be averaged for each day of the study, ANOVA testing will evaluate for the presence of a significant time component. • Supervised vs. unsupervised use o The mean relief recorded at the first and second visit will be averaged and compared avross patients with the mean relief recorded during at home use using a bidirectional t test. • QOL impacts o Evaluated for each scale using bidirectional t test 6.3.3 Safety Analysis Adverse events are not expected; however,  all subjects entered into the study at Visit 1 will be included in the safety analysis. The frequencies of AEs by [CONTACT_24975], body system, severity and relationship to study drug will be summarized if at all present. SAEs (if any) will be described in detail. AE incidence will be summarized along with the corresponding exact binomial 95% two-sided confidence intervals. 
   
   [ADDRESS_394340] deviation of plus or minus 2 (such that 95% of the venous pulsatile tinnitus population has tinnitus intensity between 1 and 9). Intensity scale measurements will be averaged across individual submissions and across participants. With 16 paired evaluations per participant and 20 participants total, that creates 320 non collar tinnitus intesnity measures 320 collar intensity measures. Setting an alpha of p=.05 and a power of 0.8 (beta=0.2), we expect a minimum effect of a [ADDRESS_394341] size to be significant Substitution lends us the following ng = (1.96+ 0.8416)2*(22+22)/(2)2 ng = 15.[ADDRESS_394342]; we will be able to assess the significant effect within each participant, given that each participant will complete both the with and without collar scales a total of 16 times. This gives our study strong internal and external validity.  6.5 Interim Analysis Not planned. Significant safety adverse events would lead to termination of study.  

   
   10 7 STUDY DEVICE (STUDY DEVICE OR OTHER STUDY INTERVENTION) 7.1 Description 7.1.1 Usage The collar can be worn while awake for no more than 4 hours daily by [CONTACT_319592]/exclusion criteria. This point shall be educated to participants who enroll. 7.1.[ADDRESS_394343] safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_319590]-supervised fitting period at the beginning of the study and by [CONTACT_319591]-being or onset of new symptoms and immediate reporting of that occurrence to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_319575].   
   
   11 8 SAFETY MANAGEMENT 8.1 Clinical Adverse Events Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.  8.2 Adverse Event Reporting Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen during the course of this study (including SAEs) they will be reported to the IRB in accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. AEs that do not meet prompt reporting requirements will be summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review (if continuing reviews are required), or will be tracked and documented internally by [CONTACT_319593] (if continuing reviews are not required).  
   
   [ADDRESS_394344]-protected redcap database available only to access by [CONTACT_3462]. All study personnel are trained and certified in HIPAA. Data collection will occur through individualized links to REDCAP database administered on secure clinic iPad during visits or sent to participant phone/email during home phase. 9.[ADDRESS_394345] safety, and the accuracy and security of the emerging data. 9.4.2 Risk Assessment Not Greater than Minimal: - Psychological o Wearing the collar might be embarrassing for some patients. This is averted through a flexible at home protocol in which they are only asked to wear the collar on an as needed basis for symptomatic relief and report their efficacy. Patients will be allowed to withdraw from the study at any time. - Confidentiality o Any study has potential consequences a breach of confidentiality, this study will avoid those consequences through maintenance of the data in a password protected REDCAP database accessible only to the research team, all of whom are HIPAA certified. - Discomfort o The device is FDA approved for contact [CONTACT_62879], and there are no adverse risks for the indicated population. However there is a possibility that patients will feel discomfort when wearing it. Care will be made to ensure the fitting is optimize the patient's needs. Possibility of mild discomfort if collar used incorrectly; this will be averted by [CONTACT_319594][INVESTIGATOR_319576].   
   
   [ADDRESS_394346] Benefits: Immediate symptom and quality of life improvement while wearing the collar during the study. Indirect Benefits: contributing to widespread approval and access of color are used for venous pulsatile tinnitus population if effective in relieving symptoms by [CONTACT_319595][INVESTIGATOR_319577]. 9.4.[ADDRESS_394347] that this condition has limited treatment options outside of surgery, we determine it worthwhile to proceed with the study. 9.5 Recruitment Strategy A HIPAA waiver has been requested for the screening of eligible participants. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_319578]. Recruiting will occur by a member of the study team not responsible for the patient’s direct care engaging them during their clinic visit independent of their provider at UNC ENT Meadowmont.  9.6 Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_319579]’s care will approach a patient meeting exclusion and inclusion criteria in person during one of their regular visits at UNC Meadowmont outpatient clinic. This will occur in the examination room after the patient’s care provider has stepped out. At this point the patient will be asked about their interest in hearing about and possibly participating in a study that could help their tinnitus. If the patient acquiescence, the team member will then explain the study as well as its potential direct benefits and risks to the patient, emphasizing that the ultimate goal is scientific advancement instead of improved care. If the patient acquiesces, the consent forms and HIPAA form will be shared and explained to them. If they are still willing to participate, they will sign the forms and become a participant. 9.6.[ADDRESS_394348]/poster.

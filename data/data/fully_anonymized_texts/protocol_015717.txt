 2 Introduction  
 
Background  
Coronary artery by[CONTACT_10956] (CABG) is the definitive surgical approach 
for the treatment of ischemic heart disease, with >400,000 procedures performed 
annually in the [LOCATION_002] al one [1].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_259926], the saphenous vein remains an important conduit that is still 
used for more than 70% of grafts, due to its  ease of use and ready availability  [2].  
While co nvenient as a c onduit however, the saphenous vein is severely limited 
by [CONTACT_260005].  With important 
clinical sequalae, saphenous vein graft disease remains an unresolved medical 
problem, as up to 20% of venous grafts occl ude in the first year after by[CONTACT_13786] [3].  Between 1 and 6 years, the graft attrition rate is 1% to 2% per year, 
and between 6 and  10 years it rises to 4% per year.  By 10 years after surgery, 
only 60% of grafts are patent and only 50% of patent vein grafts are free of 
significant stenosis.  In addition, native coronary artery disease  (CAD)  
progresses in 5% of patients annually [4-7].  As a result of graft and native vessel 
attrition, this population is at high risk for subsequent ischemic events, including 
myocardial infarction (MI) and death [6].  Further revascularization, either 
reoperation or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), is required in 4% of 
patients by 5 years, 19% of patients by 10 years , and 31% of patients by 12 
years after the initial by[CONTACT_4897] [2, 8] . 
 
Saphenous vein graft disease is composed of three discrete stages: thrombosis, 
intimal hyperplasia, and atherosclerosis.  These processes are interlinked 
pathologically in the evolution of vein graft disease [5-6, 8-10].  Early thrombosis 
is a major cause of vein graft attrition during the first month after CABG.  Even 
when preformed under optimal conditions, the harvesting of venous conduits is 
associated with f ocal endothelial disruption that results in the accumulation of 
fibrin on the luminal surface, the adherence and aggregation of platelets, and the 
activation of the extrinsic coagulation cascade by [CONTACT_260006] 
[11-12].  Grafts that survive this early period develop a progressive thickening of 
the media with neointimal formation that begins within days of implantation.  This 
continues over the subsequent months, and forms a template for the  
deve lopment of superimposed atherosclerotic changes [9-10]. 
 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259927] s econdary prevention after CABG because of its 
effects on early patency and reduction in cardiac events [13-16].  By [CONTACT_260007] -A2 production, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259928] t aggregation [14].  When 
administered within [ADDRESS_316065] [17].  Several randomized controlled trials have 
demonstrated that aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259929] [18-
21].  In the largest trial on the subject, the Veterans Administration Cooperative 
Study enrolled 772 CABG patients, noting that , compared to placebo, as pi[INVESTIGATOR_9601] a 
dose of 325 mg/day or higher increased vein graft patency both at 60 days [22] 
TARGET Trial - Brilinta ISSBRIL0220   Version  4 – October 17, 2013  
 3 and 1 year after surgery  [23].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_259930] , aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259931].  It is a relatively weak an tiplatelet 
agent and does not inhibit platelet aggregation by [CONTACT_182777] A2 -independent 
pathways (e.g. ADP or collagen stimulation).  Even with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259932], a large number of recurrent events occur [24].  Moreover, 
a significant proportion of patients undergoing CABG may be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259933], as 
defined as undetectable platelet inhibition after 1 week of therapy [25-26].   
Depending on the population studied and the specific definition of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259934], anywhere from 10 -40% of patients have an inadequate antiplatelet 
response to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] [25, 27] .  Such patients appear to be at increased risk for the 
development of vascular events.  In theory, these aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] -resistant patients may 
derive particular benefit from alternative antiplatelet therapy (such as ticagrelor) 
instead of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] [28]. 
 
Because of the conc erns regarding aspi[INVESTIGATOR_36830] [25, 27] , and the high vein 
graft occlusion rate no ted in recent trials [3], several investigators have sought to 
evaluate the role of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_259935].  A  thienopyridine that irreversibly 
inhibits the platelet P2Y [ADDRESS_316066]  important  antithrombotic effects [29] and clinical benefits in 
several CAD trials [30-31].  Following CABG surgery however,  observational and 
clinical trials have failed to convincingly demonstrate that its use improves clinical 
outcomes [32-35] or postoperative graft patency [36-39] compared to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_205335].  To date, [ADDRESS_316067] of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_259936] (with 
cardiopulmonary  by[CONTACT_6476] ) [36-39].  Only one of these trials found a benefit in 
terms of  vein graft patency with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87237] .  Nevertheless,  this study 
was limited by t he lack of blinding  and placebo -control, and the control arm 
received a fairly low dose of  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]  (100 mg) [38].  Using a higher dose of 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], Kulik et al. performed a randomized double -blind placebo -controlled trial 
comparing 162 mg aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259937] 162 mg plus clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] 75 mg daily, 
and no difference in vein graft patency was noted [39]. 
 
Overall, the experience with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_259938].   In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_259939] [40-41], the current standard of care for 
postoperative antiplatelet therapy is isolated aspi[INVESTIGATOR_119457], in doses of 100 -325 
mg daily.   Interestingly , a favorable experience with ticagrelor was recently noted 
after CABG.  Like clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], ticagrelor inhibits the platelet P2Y 12 adenosine 
diphosphate receptor, but has a more rapid onset of action and more consistent 
and pronounced platelet inhibition than clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] [42-43].  In the PLATO study, 
18,624 patients with acute coronary syndrome were randomized for 1 -year 
treatment with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259940] 90 mg twice daily or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259941] 
75 mg daily.  The pr imary end point of the study (cardiovascular death, MI, or 
stroke) was significantly reduced by [CONTACT_260008][INVESTIGATOR_7745] (9.8% 
versus 11.7%, ticagrelor versus clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], P<0.001) [42].  In a sub sequent sub -
group analysis of  the 1,261 PLATO patients who underwent CABG , ticagrelor 
TARGET Trial - Brilinta ISSBRIL0220   Version  4 – October 17, 2013  
 4 treatment led to a non -significant reduction in the primary end -point at 1 year 
(10.6% versus 13.1%, ticagrelor  versus clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], P=0.29), and a significant 
reduction in cardiovascular mortality (4.1% versus 7.9%, ticagrelor  versus 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], P<0.01) [43]. 
 
To date, no data is available regarding the impact of ticagrelor on saphenous 
vein graft patency following CABG.  Even with routine aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259942], 
10-20% of vein grafts occlude within [ADDRESS_316068] 
antiplatelet treatment after  CABG surgery, 10 -20% of vein grafts  continue to 
occlude despi[INVESTIGATOR_259943]. Compared to 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259944], ticagrelor treatment leads 
to a more pronounced platelet inhibition, and ma y substantially improve graft 
patency following CABG compared to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  No data has yet to be collected 
regarding the impact of ticagrelor on saphenous vein graft patency following 
CABG.   In this context, we seek to compare vein graft patency between pa tients 
randomized to receive a spi[INVESTIGATOR_119457], the current standard of care, or ticagrelor  
treatment, starting in  the early postoperative period, and continuing for 2 years 
after CABG . 
 
Benefits, Risks and Ethical Assessment  
It is anticipated that ticagrelor will improve vein graft patency in this clinical trial.  
To maximize the benefits and minimize the risks associated with ticagrelor, 
concomitant aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259945].  P atients who are randomized to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259946] 162 mg daily in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_259947], since a lower 
daily dose of 81 mg  daily may be under -treatment and insufficient for antiplatelet 
therapy after CABG.   In addition to graft patency at 1 and 2 years after surgery, 
TARGET Trial - Brilinta ISSBRIL0220   Version  4 – October 17, [ADDRESS_316069] ethical standards, in accordance with the applicable  [LOCATION_002] 
Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) regulations and institutional review board  
requirements.   This trial will be submitted to the FDA for review .  Moreover, 
research ethics approval will be sought from the Western Inst itutional Review 
Board (WIRB).  
 
 
Study Objectives  
 
Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this clinical trial will be to evaluate whether , as compared 
to usual aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259948], ticagrelor early after CABG prevent s saphenous vein 
graft occlusion  1 year after surgery , as assessed by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) 
coronary angiography , as well as 2 years after surgery  via study extension . 
 
Secondary Objective  
The secondary objective of this clinical trial will be to evaluate whether , as 
compared to usual aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259949], ticagrelor early after CABG prevent s 
saphenous vein graft stenosis,  defined as >50% narrowing of the graft,  1 year after 
surgery, as assessed by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) coronary angiography , as 
well as [ADDRESS_316070] of 
ticagrelor treatment, as compare to  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], on the incidence of major adverse 
cardiovascular events (mortality, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_259950], and need for coronary intervention) a nd 
bleeding events in the first year and second year study  after CABG  (Appendix B).  
It is recognized  that the study will be under -powered in the evaluation of these 
outcomes, which will be defined using the previously published definitions from the 
CURE and CASCADE trials  [30, 39, 44] .  Specifically, major bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_259951], intraocular bleeding leading to the 
loss of vision, or bleeding necessitating the transfusion of at least [ADDRESS_316071] 5 grams per deciliter or to 
substantial hypotension requiring the use of intravenous inotropic agents, if it 
necessitates a surgical intervention, if it is a symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, 
or if it necessitates the transfusion of four or more units of blood.  Minor bleeding 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_259952] (i.e. nose bleeds) that lead to the 
interruption of the s tudy medication.  
 
 
 
 
TARGET Trial - Brilinta ISSBRIL0220   Version  4 – October 17, [ADDRESS_316072] coronary 
angiogram  will assess graft patency.  Patients will then be invited to  continue 
participat ing in the study for a second year (study extension) .  A C T coronary 
angiogram will subsequently asses 2 -year graft patency.  
 
[COMPANY_008] LP ( Wilmington, Delaware) will provide the ticagrelor tablets for the 
study  (Appendix C) .  The ticagrelor tablets will be submitted by [CONTACT_260009] (Boca Raton, [LOCATION_012]), a pharmaceutical custom 
compounding company.   The aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259953] .  The ticagrelor and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259954].  T he compounding process does not 
affect the bioavailability of ticagrelor  or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] , and the bioavailability of the 
capsules will be confirmed through independent biochemical analysis.   A bullet 
pulverizer will be used to crush a pool of 300 tablets  at a time (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259955]).  A ProFiller 3600 capsule filling system will then prepare 300 capsules 
containing the active powder (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259956]), with inert microcrystalline 
cellulose used to fill the remaining capsule space.   The crushed tablets will not 
be used beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_259957].  
 
Compounding Docs will prepare identical capsules containing  either  81 mg of 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_36837] 90 mg of ticagrelor.   These prepared capsules will appear identical for 
the purpose of blinding in this study.  Patients in the trial will be assigned to 
receive either one aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 81 mg capsule 2 times per day (Arm A – aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) or one 
ticagrelor 90 mg capsule 2 times per day (Arm B – ticagre lor).  Compounding 
Docs will prepare pi[INVESTIGATOR_259958] 180 capsules to cover for a 3 -month 
supply.  The blinded capsules will be stored at room temperature (25°C), as 
indicated on the bottle container label.   These pi[INVESTIGATOR_259959] (BRRH) pharmacy.   Ordering and dispensing 
of the blinded study medication will be coordinated by [CONTACT_260010].  
Shipment of study medication to the  second recruitment site at the University of 
Ottawa Heart Institut e (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) will also be coordinated by [CONTACT_260011].  After surgery, each trial participant will be provided with a 3 -
month supply of study medication, and a new pi[INVESTIGATOR_259960] 3 months over the cou rse of the 1- or 2-year trial enrollment.  
  
The study population will include all patients undergoing CABG over the study 
period at the Lynn Heart and Vascular Institute  of the Boca Raton Regional 
TARGET Trial - Brilinta ISSBRIL0220   Version  4 – October 17, [ADDRESS_316073] one saphenous vein graft is used.  
Patients undergoing concurrent valve repair or replacement surgery will als o be 
eligible, unless postoperative warfarin anticoagulation is anticipated (i.e. 
mechanical prosthetic valve).  CABG patients will b e pre-screened and  evaluated 
for study eligibility in the perioperative period  (Appendix A ).  Study eligible  
patients will be selected and approached by [CONTACT_260012].  Consent and r andomization will occur within 5 days after surgery .  
Randomization will be stratified based on the surgical site, the presence of 
diabetes mellitus, and  the use of cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476] (on -pump or off -
pump).  
 
Prior to trial enrollment, in the early postoperative period, patients will be treated 
with usual aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259961]  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 325 mg daily)  starting within 24 
hours after surgery, in ke epi[INVESTIGATOR_259947]  [41].  At the time of 
randomization  following surgery , this standard aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259962] .  Patients will be randomized into an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34209] ( Arm A - aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 
81 mg bid ) or a ticagrelor group ( Arm B - ticagrelor 90 mg bid).   The study 
capsules will be  identical  to ensure blinding.  Medication administration and data 
collection will be performed in a double -blind manner, such that neither the 
patient nor the healthcare personnel will be aware of the medication assignment.  
 
Recruitment and written consent will be performed either prior to surgery or 
within 5 days after surgery .  This interval of time after surgery will enable subjects  
to recover from anesthesia and the occasional confusion associated with 
postoperative narcotic use, in order  to provide informed consent.  Randomization 
will occur following surgery.  Patients who are requiring high levels of 
hemodynamic support (more than 2 inotropes) within 48 hours after surgery will 
not be randomized into the study.   Patients requiring posto perative 
antico agulation with warfarin will also not be recruited.  Following surgery, the 
study medication will be administered daily via nasogastric tube (if patient is 
intubated) or orally, starting on postoperative days [ADDRESS_316074] postoperative graft patency, current clinical guidelines recommend 
lipid-lowering therapy after CA BG to achieve low -density lipoprotein (LDL) levels 
<100 mg/dL  [41].  As such, patients in this trial will undergo lipid level evaluation 
at baseline before surgery and every 3 months during study  enrollment.   This 
information will be made available to clinicians involved in the care of study 
subjects to facilitate modification of lipid -lowering therapy, as needed, in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_259963] - Brilinta ISSBRIL0220   Version  4 – October 17, [ADDRESS_316075].

Study Conduct  
Restrictions during  the S tudy  
Patients who require long -term anticoagulation (chronic atrial fibrillation, 
mechanical valve) will not be recruited into the TARGET trial, due to the higher 
risk of bleeding complications associated with the combination of both ticagrelor  
and coumadin.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_259968], subjects who are recruited into the trial 
may subsequently develop an indication for anticoagulation after study 
enrollment.  As an example, anticoagulation may be necessary starting [ADDRESS_316081] will discontinue the blinded study medication (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259956]) and 
receive open label treatment as indicated by  [CONTACT_260013]’s care (i.e. open label 81 mg aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259969]).  When 
anticoagulation is no longer needed (resolved atrial fibrillation), or the course of 
coumadin has been completed, open label treatment will cease, and  the trial 
subject will resume the blinded study medication.   The subject will continue to 
followed as part of the trial and undergo CT graft evaluation irrespective of study 
medication interruptions.  
 
In the case of a serious bleeding event (i.e. gastroi ntestinal bleeding requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) while enrolled in TARG ET, a study subject will permanently 
discontinue the study medication.  The patient will continue to be followed for the 
duration of trial enrollment , but the subject will receive open lab el treatment as 
indicated by [CONTACT_260014]’s care (i.e. open label 81 mg 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34223]).  
 
Subject Enrollment and Randomization  
CABG patients will be evaluated by [CONTACT_260015]-screening and 
trial eligibility in the perioperative period.  Consent and randomization will occur 
within 5 days after surgery .  Randomization will be stratified based on the 
surgical site, the presence of diabetes mellitus, and the use of cardiopulmonary 
by[CONTACT_6476] (on -pump or off-pump).  A block randomization technique will ensure an 
equal distribution of diabetic patients in both arms of the trial, in addition to an 
equal distribution of on -pump and off -pump CABG patients.  The randomization 
schedule will be generated using SA S 9.1 software (SAS, Cary, NC).  All patients 
and study personnel will be blinded to the treatment assignment which will be 
performed by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_259970] - Brilinta ISSBRIL0220   Version  4 – October 17, 2013  
 12 University of Ottawa Heart Institute.  While consent may be performed before 
surgery, randomization will not be performed until after surgery when clinical 
stability has been ensured (patients who are requiring high levels of 
hemodynamic support and are at high risk of perioperative death will not be 
randomized int o the study).  At the time of randomization following surgery, 
standard aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259971].  Patients will be randomized into 
an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34209] (Arm A - aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 81 mg bid) or a ticagrelor group (Arm B - 
ticagrelor 90 mg bid).   
 
Procedur es for Randomization  
Once a patient has been identified and consented , the pharmacy will be notified 
that the patient needs to be randomized.   A Randomization Form will be 
completed and faxed to the pharmacy.   In addition, protocol orders will be 
entered into the patient’s medical record.   The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_259972].   In 
addition, a second pharmacist will be required to sign off on the Randomization 
Form to confirm that t he patient was assigned to the appropriate group.  
 
Procedures for Handling Subjects I ncorrectly Randomized  
The Randomization Form will be designed in a manner that the subgrou ps will be 
clearly identified.   In addition, the process of utilizing a second pharmacist during 
the randomization phase will avoid incorrect assignments.   If a subject has been 
incorrectly enrolled , the unblinded pharmacist will be notified and the 
randomization number will be corrected.   The patient will remain on the same 
blinded study medication . 
  
Blinding and Procedures for Unblinding the Study  
The study personnel will be blinded, with the exceptio n of the pharmacy staff 
involved in  randomizing the trial subjects .  Only unblinded pharmacy personnel 
will have access to any unblinded patient logs.   Unblinded pharmacy personnel 
will be notified by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_259973] a patient requires 
unblinding.   A patient should not be unblinded without the authorization of the 
Principal Investigator.   Any reques ts for unblinding should be directed to the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the research coordinator.   Upon approval of the 
Principal Investigator, a patient may be unblinded if this information is essential in 
determining the continued care of the patient.  
 
Methods for Ensuring B linding  
The study personnel will not have access to any of the unblinded patient logs.   
This includes patient assignment logs and/or drug accountability logs.   These 
logs will be maintained in the pharmacy.

guidelines.  This will include smoking cessation counseling and the 
administration of beta blockers, angiot ensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and 
lipid-lowering medications as indicated  [41, 46 -47].  Target LDL values (less than 
100 mg/dL) will be those recommended as per current guidelines.  In the 
absence of specific contraindications, all patients will be on postoperative lipid 
lowering therapy, and lipid profiles will be assessed ev ery [ADDRESS_316083].  Once drinking well, diabetic patients will be restarted on their 
original preoperative diabetic regimens (oral agents and/or insulin therapy).  The 
treatment of diabetes during this study will be closely monitored in collabora tion 
with endocrinologists.  
 
Treatment Compliance  
The research coordinator s involved in the trial and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_259976], assess patient compliance with the trial protocol, and evaluate 
TARGET Trial - Brilinta ISSBRIL0220   Version  4 – October 17, 2013  
 14 safety issues throughout trial enrollment .  Telephone calls by [CONTACT_260016] 3  months  after surgery.   Additional ly, trial 
participants will meet with a research coordinator every 3 months to receive a 
new 3 -month supply of the study medication.  These visits and telephone calls 
will help in the retention of study subjects.  Patient compliance will be evaluated 
through personal interviews and the counting of remaining pi[INVESTIGATOR_32404] 3 -month 
intervals (at the time that new study medication is provided to patien ts). 
 
Accountability  
The research coordinator will count remaining investigational drug a t the time of 
study drug return.   This information will be maintained in the study patient ’s chart.   
In addition, patient assignment logs and drug accountability logs will be  
maintained in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4601].   These logs will be maintained by [CONTACT_260017].  
 
Discontinuation of Investigational Drug  
A recruited subject who subsequently develops an indication for anticoagulation 
(i.e. new -onset postoperative atrial fibrillation or deep vein thrombosis) will be 
asked to discontinue the TARGET blinded study medication.  The participant will 
then receive open label treatment as indicated by [CONTACT_260013]’s care (i.e. open la bel 81 mg aspi[INVESTIGATOR_259969]).  When 
anticoagulation is no longer needed (resolved atrial fibrillation), or the course of 
coumadin has been completed, open label treatment will cease, and the trial 
subject will be asked to resume the blinded study  medication.  
 
In the case of a serious bleeding event (i.e. gastrointestinal bleeding requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) while enrolled in TARG ET, a study subject will permanently 
discontinue the study medication.  
 
Procedures for Discontinuation of a Subject from Investigational Drug   
If it is determined that a patient will be discontinue d from the investigational drug, 
then alternate medication wil l be prescribed , if applicable, by [CONTACT_941] P rincipal  
Investigator or the patient’s health care provider.   Attempts will be made to obtain 
any remaining i nvestigational drug in the patient’s possession.  
 
Withdrawal from  Study  
A patient may be withdrawn from study medication at any time by [CONTACT_260018]’ s consent.   For examp le: if it is in the 
patient’s best interest, if the patient has problems complying with study 
procedures, if the patient becomes pregnant, if the patient does not consent to 
continue in the study after being told of changes in the research, if the patient 
makes a request , if the patient has a serious adverse event (GI bleed), or for any 
other reason.  
 
TARGET Trial - Brilinta ISSBRIL0220   Version  4 – October 17, [ADDRESS_316084] coronary 
angiography at 1 year and 2 years after CABG.  The incidence of major adverse 
coronary events and safety outcomes will be documented during postoperative 
visit at 1  month after surgery and every 3 months thereafter .  A research 
coordinator will phone each patient every 3 months to document any other events 
and ensure study drug compliance.   This data will be recorded on the case report 
forms.  
Enrollment  Procedures  
Patients undergoing CABG procedures will be pre-screened for eligibility in the 
study.   Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed.   The research 
coordinator  will consult with the Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11637] -investigator(s) 
regarding patient’s eligi bility prior to enrollment.   Once a patient is deemed 
eligible for the study, the patient will be invited to participate.  
Follow -up Procedures  
Patients will be contact[CONTACT_260019] -up visits.   
Appointments will be scheduled and lab oratory tests  and/or CT scan will be 
completed.   Patients will receive a resupply of study drug at these appointments, 
if applicable.   The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or sub -investigator(s) will be 
informed of the patient’s status.  
 
 
Safety  
Definition of A dverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is the development of an undesirable medical condition or 
the deterioration of a pre -existing medical condition following or during exposure 
to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally related to the 
product.  An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e .g. nausea, chest 
pain), signs (e .g. tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal results of an 
investigation (e .g. laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  In clinical studies, a n 
AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, even if no 
study treatment has been administered.   The term AE is used to include both 
serious and non -serious AEs.  
 
TARGET Trial - Brilinta ISSBRIL0220   Version  4 – October 17, 2013  
 16 Definitions of Serious A dverse Event 
A serious adverse event is an  AE occurring during any study phase (i .e. follow -
up) that fulfils one or more of the following criteria:  
 Results in death  
 Is immediately life -threatening  
 Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 Results in persisten t or significant disability/incapacity or substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
 Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
 Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent o ne of the outcomes listed above  
The causality of serious adverse events ( SAEs ) and their relationship to the 
study treatment  will be assessed by [CONTACT_093] s and communicated to 
[COMPANY_008].  
 
Causality Assessment of Adverse Ev ent to Treatment  
The investigator will assess the relationship of any AE to the use of the study 
drug, based on available information, using the following guidelines:  
 
Unlikely related – no temporal association, or the cause of the event has been 
identified, or the drug, biological or device cannot be implicated  
 
Possibly related – temporal association, but other etiologies are likely to be the 
cause; however involvement of the drug, biological, or device cannot be excluded  
 
Probably related – temp oral association and other etiologies are possible but 
unlikely  
 
 
Recording of A dverse Events  
Adverse events will be recorded for study subjects while they are enrolled in the 
trial (maximum 2 year enrollment ).  Serious adverse events that occur at any 
time after the inclusion of the subject in the study (defined as the time when the 
subject is randomized) up to [ADDRESS_316085] (e.g. 
phone contact [CONTACT_260020]), or [ADDRESS_316086] dose of 
the study medication, whichever is later.  
As noted above , the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events ( mortality, 
myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_259977], and need for coronary intervention) a nd bleeding events will be 
recorded (and noted as a dverse events)  for trial subjects in the 2 year period 
after CABG.  If , during trial enrollment , a participant develops a major adverse 
cardiovascular event or major bleeding event, the TARGET blinded study 
TARGET Trial - Brilinta ISSBRIL0220   Version  4 – October 17, 2013  
 17 medication will be discontinued .  The  participant will then rec eive open label 
treatment as indicated by [CONTACT_260014]’s care.  
The following variables will be collected for each AE:  
 Adverse event description  
 The date when the AE started and stopped  
 Whether the AE is serious or not  
 Investigator causality rating against the study medication  
 Action taken with regard to  study medication  
 Whether  AE caused subject’s withdrawal from study  
 Patient outcome  
 
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs:  
 Date AE met criteria  for serious AE  
 Date investigator became aware of serious AE  
 Reason AE is serious (i.e. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , probable cause of death)  
 Dates of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], discharge, and/or death  
 Whether a utopsy performed  
 Investigator causality rating against the study me dication or other 
medications  
 
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Investigators and other site personnel will inform the FDA, via a MedWatch  form, 
of any serious, unexpected , possibly related adverse events that occur in 
accordance with the reporting obl igations of [ADDRESS_316087] all such reports to [COMPANY_008] .  A copy of the MedWatch report will be 
faxed to [COMPANY_008] at the time the event is reported to the FDA.  It is the 
responsibility of the investigator to compi[INVESTIGATOR_259978] a report according to the FDA reporting requirement 
timelines and to ensure that these reports are also submitted to [COMPANY_008] at 
the same time.  
 
When reporting to [COMPANY_008], a cover page  will accompany the MedWatch  
form indicating the following:  
 Investigator Sponsored Study (ISS)  
 The investigator IND number assigned by [CONTACT_1622]  
 The investigator’s name [CONTACT_3816]  
 The trial title and [COMPANY_008] ISS reference number  
 
The i nvestigative site will also indicate, either in the SAE report or the cover 
page, the causality  of events in relation to all study medications  as determined by 
[CONTACT_458].  
 
The SAE report and accompanying cover page will be sent by [CONTACT_251938]’s de signated fax line: 1 -[PHONE_5395] . 
 
TARGET Trial - Brilinta ISSBRIL0220   Version  4 – October 17, [ADDRESS_316088] 
(IRB) as soon as possible, in accordance with local laws  and regulations.   All 
SAEs will be reported to the Western Institutional Review Board ( WIRB).  The 
development of serious adverse events that might be attributable to the study 
medication will lead to the termination of the study drug.   
 
 
 
Ethical and Regulatory R equirements  
Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The TARGET trial will  adhere to the highest research ethics standards, in 
accordance with the applicable FDA regulations and IRB requirements.  The 
study protocol will be reviewed by [CONTACT_260021][INVESTIGATOR_307].  Thereafter , the protocol, the Informed Consent Form (ICF), 
and relevant supporting information will be submitted to the Western Institutional 
Review Board (WIRB) for human research ethics approval.  The trial protoc ol will 
also be submitted to the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to 
obtain exemption status from Investigational New Drug Application (IND) 
regulations.  
 
Patients will be approached before or after CABG surgery for enrollment in the 
trial.  As part of the consent process, patients will be explained the rationale of 
the trial and the potential adverse side effects associated with enrollment.  
Patients will be reminded that they are free to choose to e ither participate or not 
participate in the study.  
 
Ethics and R egulatory Review  
The TARGET trial will not begin subject recruitment until approval has been 
granted by [CONTACT_260022].  The investigator will be responsible for reporting 
to WIRB of the pro gress of the study at least once per year or as required.  In 
addition, the Investigator will be responsible for obtaining WIRB approval for any 
changes made to the protocol or Informed Consent prior to implementation, 
except where study subject safety is affected.  
The Investigator will promptly notify WIRB , [COMPANY_008],  and the FDA of all 
serious, unexpected , possibly related adverse events.  
TARGET Trial - Brilinta ISSBRIL0220   Version  4 – October 17, [ADDRESS_316089] safety is affected.  [COMPANY_008] will be notified of any changes 
to the Protocol and/or Informed Consent.  
Audits and Inspections  
[COMPANY_008] will be notified of any audits or inspections conducted at the study 
location s.  The Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_259979], in accordance with federal guidelines.  
 
 
 
Study M anagement  
Training of Study Site Personnel  
All personnel will be properly trained in the protocol  and procedures expected of 
them.   In addition, refresher training may be conducted, as needed.   Training 
logs will be kept in the study regulatory binders.  
Monitoring of the S tudy  
The site s will perform self monitoring of this study.  
Source Data 
All source documents will be maintained in the research chart for each subject.   
In addition, electronic medical records (EMR) may also be  utilized by [CONTACT_260023].   It is the practice of the research facility to allow EMR access to monitors 
or auditors,  if requested.  
Study T imetable and End of Study  
Patient recruitment is expected to be completed within [ADDRESS_316090] for 2 additional 
years.  The study duration is estimated a t 4 years.  
 
During the time of enrollment, patients will be seen every three months. This 
includes the 3 month visit, 6 month visit, 9 month visit, and 12 month visit.   At the 
12 month visit, patients will be given the opportunity to continue in the study for 
an addition al 12 months.   This would include the 15 month visit, 18 month visit, 
21 month visit, and 24 month visit.  
 
TARGET Trial - Brilinta ISSBRIL0220   Version  4 – October 17, 2013  
 20 Data Management  
All data will be recorded on preprinted case report forms (CRF) suitable for 
electronic data capture. The case report forms will be kept in the patient’s 
research chart.   The research charts will be stored in a locked, secure location. 
Data will be entered by [CONTACT_260024].  
 
 
Statistical Methods  
 
Sample Size  
This trial will be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  Outcome estimates will form the basis for assessing 
the feasibility of designing a future large and definitive trial.  One hundred fifty 
patients in each study arm will be enrolled (300 total patients).  Since each patient 
will receive 2 vein graft s, on average, there will be approximately 300 vein grafts 
in each group (600 vein grafts total).  This sample size will be large enough to 
detect whether a clinically important difference exists in terms of vein graft patency 
between the groups, but small  enough that subject recruitment can be performed 
in an expedient manner, likely within the first 24 months of the study.  
 
This trial will not be designed or powered as a definitive clinical trial.  Based on 
several previously published clinical trials, it  is anticipated that 10 -20% of vein 
grafts will be documented as occluded at the 1 -year time point after CABG.  Should 
ticagrelor improve graft patency and reduce vein occlusion from 20% to 10%, 
power calculations suggest that this pi[INVESTIGATOR_259980] 96 % power to detect a 
significant difference (P<0.05) between the groups.  Alternatively, if ticagrelor were 
to decrease the occlusion rate from 15% to 10%, the power will be approximately 
58%.  
 
Statistical Analysis  
All study data will be collected in  a blinded fashion during the course of the trial.  
At 1- and [ADDRESS_316091] imaging.  
The radiologists will be blinded to study treatment  assignment.  The data analysis 
will also be performed in a blinded fashion, with un -blinding at the conclusion of 
the analysis.  Study outcomes will be compared on an intention -to-treat basis 
according to the randomization study -group assignment.  Vein gr aft occlusion, the 
primary outcome of the study, will be compared between the two randomization 
groups using a Fisher’s exact test.  To account for within -patient correlation and 
the possibility of multi -graft occlusion within individual patients, vein gra ft data will 
also be analyzed using logistic regression fit with generalized estimating equations 
methods.  For secondary outcomes, continuous data will be compared between 
the two groups using two -sided Student’s t tests, two -sample Wilcoxon rank -sum 
tests, or ANOVA, and a Fisher’s exact test will be used for categorical data.  Time 
to major adverse cardiovascular event will be determined for the study groups 
using the Kaplan -Meier method, and groups will be compared with a log -rank test.  
In accordance wi th intention -to-treat analysis, clinical and safety data will be 
analyzed for all randomized patients in the study.  This will include data collected 
TARGET Trial - Brilinta ISSBRIL0220   Version  4 – October 17, [ADDRESS_316092] 
coronary angiography (5% ex pected refusal).  
 
Study analysis will be performed at the [ADDRESS_316093] crossed the 2 -year 
time-point after surgery.  
 
 
 
Important Medical Procedures to be followed by [CONTACT_260025], 
then the investigators or other site personnel will inform appropriate [COMPANY_008] 
representatives within  one day  (i.e. immediately but no later than the end of the 
next busines s day ) of when he or she becomes aware of it.  
 
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative will work  with the Investigator to 
ensure that all relevant information is provided to the [COMPANY_008]  Patient Safety  
data entry site.  
Pregnancy  
Patients who are p regnan t or seeking to become pregnant will be excluded from 
trial recruitment.  A ll outcomes of pregnancy , should they occur, will be reported 
to [COMPANY_008].

 26 Appendix B – Definitions of Outcomes  
As per the and CASCADE  and CURE Trials [30, 39, 44]  
 
Death from Cardiovascular Cause  
Death from cardiovascular cause is defined as any death for which there is no clearly 
documented nonvascular cause.  
 
Myocardial Infarction  
Myocardial infarction is defined by [CONTACT_260036]: ischemic 
chest pain, the elevation of the serum levels of cardiac markers or enzymes (troponin, 
creatinine kinase, creatinine kinase MB isoenzyme, or other cardiac enzymes) to at least 
twice the upper limit of the normal referen ce range or three times the upper limit of normal 
within 48 hours after percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG (or to a level 20% 
higher than the previous value if the level has already been elevated because of an earlier 
myocardial infarction), and el ectrocardiographic changes compatible with infarction.  
 
Cerebrovascular Accident  
Stroke is defined as a new focal neurologic deficit of vascular origin lasting more than 24 
hours.  Stroke is further classified as the result of intracranial hemorrhage, isch emia (if a 
computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging scan is available), or uncertain 
cause.  
 
Angina  
Recurrent angina after surgery is defined by [CONTACT_260037] (CCS) 
classification and the need for anti -angina agents (i.e. ni trates).  Refractory ischemia after 
surgery is defined by [INVESTIGATOR_1312] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_260003] [ADDRESS_316104] 5 grams per deciliter or to 
substantial hypotension requiring the use of intravenous inotropic agents, if it necessitates 
a surgical intervention, if it is a symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, or if it necessitates 
the transfusion of four or more uni ts of blood.  Minor bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_260004].

Endpoints : The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of CONTOUR  
NEXT  and CONTOUR  PLUS ELITE  BGMSs with residual neonatal  blood 
samples . The performance of the BGMSs will be analyzed according to the 
following objectives:  
Primary Objective:  
• At least 95% of all blood glucose results shall fall within ±12.5%  of reference 
values (laboratory method) for glucose concentration ≥100 mg/dL  (5.55 
mmol/L ) and within ±12 mg/dL  (±0.67 mmol/L)  at glucose concentrations 
<100 mg/dL  (5.55 mmol/L) . 
• At least 98% of values sh all be within ±20% of reference values (laboratory 
method) for glucose concentration ≥75 mg/dL  (4.16 mmol/L)  and within ±15 
mg/dL (±0.83 mmol/L) at glucose concentrations < 75 mg/dL  (4.16 mmol/L) .  
Number of study sites  [ADDRESS_734649]’s participation is not applicable because the study uses 
residual samples.  
4.0 Identification and description of the investigational device  
4.1 Name [CONTACT_559243]:  
• CONTOUR  NEXT  blood glucose monitoring system ( Meter, CONTOUR  NEXT  Test 
Strips , Control solutions)   
• CONTOUR  PLUS ELITE  blood glucose monitoring system ( Meter, CONTOUR  PLUS  
Test Strips, Control solutions)   
4.2 Intended purpose  of investigational devices  
4.2.1 The CONTOUR  NEXT  and CONTOUR  PLUS ELITE  blood glucose monitoring 
systems ( BGMS ) are investigational BGMS s comprised of  the blood glucose meter, 
the compatible test strips, and control solutions . They  are automated   systems 
intended for the quantitative   measurement of glucose in  fresh capi[INVESTIGATOR_559209] , arterial blood, and venous blood.  Its use in this 
trial is for the quantitative measurement of glucose levels in neonates from fresh 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_559210].

Version : 14Oct2022         CONFIDENTIAL  
  
Page 10 of 42 4.2.2 The  system is intended to be used for self -testing  by [CONTACT_559226] -patient testing by  [CONTACT_559227] s (HCP) to monitor  the 
effectiveness of diabetes control .   
4.2.3 The BGMS can only be used for monitoring blood glucose levels and is not for 
diagnosis or screening of diabetes. The system is intended for in vitro  diagnostic use 
only.  
4.3 Ascensia Diabetes Care (ADC) is the m anufacturer of the device . 
4.[ADDRESS_734650]  between the devices and the patients is required since all testing will be 
performed on blood sampled from a tube.  
4.7 The technical and functional features of the investigational devices , CONTOUR  NEXT  and 
CONTOUR  PLUS ELITE  BGMSs , can be found in the User Guides (UG) in  Attachment s 
1 and 2.   
4.8 The instructions for use for the devices are found in the UGs ( Attachment s 1 and 2).  
4.9 Training and experience required for use of the device is Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) 
training, and laboratory experience.  The study staff will be provided specific device 
training as part of the Site Initiation Visit (SIV) by [CONTACT_456] .  
5.[ADDRESS_734651] BGMS that are currently used are initia lly developed for monitoring 
blood glucose levels in adult patients with diabetes. Neonatal blood differs from adult blood in two 
major aspects —it has lower concentrations of blood glucose and a wider range of hematocrit levels  
(Adamkin 2011; BAPM 2017; Ha rris et al 2012; Lucas et al 1988; Movalia and Ogino 2006; 
Nuntnarumit et al 2011 ; Roth -Kleiner et al 2010; Rozance 2006) .

Page 12 of 42 7.0 Objectives and Hypotheses  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of CONTOUR  NEXT  and 
CONTOUR  PLUS ELITE  BGMSs with residual heel-stick capi[INVESTIGATOR_559213], 
i.e. babies who are less than 28 days old . The performance of the BGMS  will be analyzed according 
to the following objectives :  
7.1 Primary Objective : The accuracy criteria below are taken from CLSI. Point -of-Care Blood 
Glucose Testing in Acute and Chronic Care Facilities; Approved Guideline – Third Edition . 
CLSI document POCT12 -A3. Wayne, PA: Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute; 
2013.   
7.1.[ADDRESS_734654] 95% of all blood glucose results shall fall within ±12 .5% of reference values 
(laboratory method) for glucose concentration ≥100 mg/dL  (5.55 mmol/L)  and 
within ±12 mg/dL  (±0.67 mmol/L)  at glucose concentrations <100 mg/dL  (5.55 
mmol/L) . 
Note: Sat isfying Criterion  7.1.1  would also satisfy the ISO [ZIP_CODE] :2013  criteria of 
obtaining the ±15% of reference values (laboratory method) for glucose 
concentration ≥100 mg/dL (5.55 mmol/L)  and within ±15 mg/dL  (±0.83 mmol/L)  at 
glucose concentrations <100 mg/dL  (5.55 mmol/L).  
7.1.[ADDRESS_734655] 98% of values sh all be within ±20% of reference values (laboratory method) 
for glucose concentration ≥75 mg/dL  (4.16 mmol/L)  and within ±15 mg/dL  (±0.83 
mmol/L)  at glucose concentrations < 75 mg/dL  (4.16 mmol/L) . 
7.2 Other Objectives:  
• Evaluate the performance of both BGMSs for neonates who are <[ADDRESS_734656] 
hematocrit results.  
• Evaluate the performance of both BGMSs with blood samples from babies in the NICU .  
• Compute differences between BGMS and laboratory blood glucose measurements and plot 
them against bilirubin  results , for those subjects where bilirubin measurements were recorded 
(when available) . 
8.0 Clinical Study Design  
8.1 This is an open label , prospective, single arm study .   The results of the study devices will 
be compared to the laboratory analyzer results from the same blood sample . 
8.2 For each BGMS, 120 evaluable samples (N=240 evalu able results  due to  duplicate testing ) 
are required . Therefore at least 120 subjects will be enrolled.  Up to 200 subjects may be 
enrolled to obtain the required number of samples.

Page 13 of 42 8.3 Randomization : 
8.3.1 Since two BGM Ss will be tested in the study, the order of testing the study devices 
will be randomized.   
8.3.2 Three strip lots (per BGMS) will be tested, with each sample tested with one lot.  
The strip lots will be randomized.  
8.4 The results from these two BGMS s will not be compared to each other.  
8.5 The study design follows  CLSI - POCT12 -A3:2013 and ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2019(E)  to ensure it is 
scientifically robust and valid.  
8.6 Subjects  with non -evaluable data will be replaced as needed to obtain N=120 samples, and 
N= 240 results (duplicate results) for each BGMS.

Page 16 of 42 The site staff will use their Laboratory Glucose Analyzer (approved by [CONTACT_1034]) for the 
laboratory assessment of blood glucose samples tested in duplicate  as part of prescribed testing  of 
the same sample . The laboratory duplicate results will be averaged . In cases where the prescribed 
test for the sample is a bilirubin analysis, the results of this test will be recorded as part of the study 
data.  
During the study, three test strip lots will be used for each BGMS. The test strip lots will be 
arbitrarily designated  as green, blue , or red to easily identify the bottles during the study. See Table 
[ADDRESS_734666] strip lots . The assignment will be made in a rotating order following the random 
order in which samples are  received.  For each sample, t he order of testing each of the two 
BGMSs will also be randomized.

11.3.4  If results are out of range, troubleshooting will be performed (see UG) , and the test 
will be repeated for a total of up to 3 attempts.  
11.3.5  If the meter tests are out of range after troubleshooting is complete, the meter will be 
removed from the study, and the Ascensia Study Manager will be notified.  
Additionally, this will be documented on the ‘Device Deficiency Reporting Form ’. 
11.4 Blood  Glucose  Testing  
11.4.1  No blood will be taken from study subjects solely for this study. Neonatal 
blood will be collected for prescribed testing and residual blood from the 
sample will be used for this study. Blood will be collected following HCP's 
orders by [CONTACT_41207]/phlebotomy staff using standard heel puncture techniques. 
All samples will be transported to the laboratory per standard practice and 
submitted for prescribed clinical testing. Samples will be collected according 
to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_559219] a tube 
containing anticoagulants (lithium heparin).

11.10  Temperature and Humidity Logs  
• The study staff will measure the temperature /humidity in the meter testing area once during 
the day that meter testing occurs and record the results on the appropriate log form .  
• Study staff will maintain a temperature log for the storage of investigational materials 
including the meters, test strips, controls, and serum controls.  
12.0 Monitoring Plan  
12.1 A monitoring plan will be completed by [CONTACT_127024]/designee prior to the study . 
12.[ADDRESS_734679] the SIV. The frequency of the number of 
monitoring visits by [CONTACT_559230](s) will be based on the monitoring plan 
and will include at least [ADDRESS_734680].  
13.0 Statistical Plan  
13.1 Sample  Size 
13.1.1  The sample size requirement is based on the primary objective, section 7.0. 
13.1.2  There will be a minimum of N = [ADDRESS_734681] 2*120 = 240.  
13.1.3  With a sample size of n = 240 results, there is approximately a 95% chance that at 
least  228  of those results (95% of 240) will be "accurate" (errors within either ±12 
mg/dL  (±0.67 mmol/L)  when the comparator result is < 100 mg/dL  (5.55 mmol/L) , 
or ±12.5% when the comparator result is ≥ 100 mg/dL  (5.55 mmol/L ) if the  
evaluation (meter)  system has a 96.77% chance of yielding an "accurate"  result.  
13.1.4  Conversely, there is about a 95% chance of obtaining fewer than 228 "accurate" 
results if the system only has an approximately 92.03% chance of yielding an 
accurate result.  
13.1.5  Note that each glucose result obtained with the evaluation devices will be considered 
either 'accurate' or 'not accurate ’, where accuracy depends on the particular test 
criterion as described in section 7.0 of this protocol.

Page 21 of 42 13.2 Blood Glucose  Measurements  
Data analysis follows analyses and presentations described in CLSI. Point -of-Care Blood Glucose 
Testing in Acute and Chronic Care Facilities; Approved Guideline – Third Edition . CLSI 
document POCT12 -A3. Wayne, PA: Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute; 2013.  
The unit conversion formula for blood glucose is the following:  
Xmmol/L = Ymg/dL / 18.016  
13.3 Bland -Altman  Plots  
Modified Bland -Altman plots (the difference between each evaluation device results and reference 
results plotted against reference results) will be constructed.  
13.[ADDRESS_734682] comparator results will be performed.  
If M represents the meter result, and C the comparator result, the linear model can be expressed as:  
𝑴= 𝜷𝟎+𝜷𝟏𝑪+𝜺 
𝜺~𝑵(𝟎,𝒄𝒗∗𝑪) 
The parameter cv is the coefficient of variation, which is assumed to be constant across the glucose 
range.  The weighting function will be:  
𝒘=𝑪−𝟐 
This weighting function is used to account for the constant cv nature of glucose measurement 
(Draper and Smith, 1998).  
13.5 Accuracy Analyses  
13.5.1  Two sets of metrics will be calculated:  
Relative (Percent) Difference (RD) for reference result  ≥ threshold glucose:  
𝑹𝑫 =𝑴−𝑪
𝑪𝟏𝟎𝟎 % 
where: M = strip/meter result and C = comparator or reference method result.  
 
Difference (D) for reference result < threshold  glucose:  
𝑫=𝑴−𝑪 
Protocol /CIP: GCA -PRO -2021 -003-01 - Amendment 1      Ascensia Diabetes Ca re 
Version : 14Oct2022         CONFIDENTIAL  
  
Page 22 of 42 13.5.2  Primary objective :  
The threshold glucose value is 100 mg/dL  (5.55 mmol/L).  Accuracy will be assessed using the 
CLSI. Point -of-Care Blood Glucose Testing in Acute and Chronic Care Facilities; Approved 
Guideline – Third Edition . CLSI document POCT12 -A3. Wayne, PA: Clinical and Laboratory 
Standards Institute; 2013.  
i.e.,  D within ±12 mg/dL ( ±0.67 mmol/L)  for comparator result < 100 mg/dL  (5.55 mmol/L)   and 
RD within ±12.5%  for comparator result ≥ 100  mg/dL (5.55 mmol/L) . 
For RD, the percent of results within  ±5%,  ±10%,  ±12.5%,  ±15% and  ±20% will be computed.  
For D, the percent less than or equal to ±5 mg/dL  (±0.28mmol /L), ±10 mg/dL  (±0.56 mmol /L), 
±12.0 mg/dL  (±0.67 mmol/L) , ±15 mg/dL  (±0.83 mmol/L) , and ±20 mg/dL  (±1.11 mmol/L)  will 
be computed.  
The RD and D distribution tables will be constructed using a threshold of 100 mg/dL (5.55 mmol/L) .  
As discussed in section 13.1 (Sample Size),  with n =240, the critical number (minimum) of 
accurate results is 228, which yields approximately 95% chance of satisfying the criterion if the 
actual probability that any result will be accurate is at least  96.77%. Symbolically, this criterion 
is equivalent  to tes ting the  hypothesis:  
 
H0 : Prob{accurate}< 96.77% versus  the alternative:  
H1  :  Prob{accurate } ≥   96.77%  
This test has a power of about 95%, with n =240, to reject H 0 if the actual probability of obtaining 
an accurate result is 96.77%. Conversely, there is about a 95% chance that the null will NOT be 
rejected if the actual probability that a result with the evaluation device would satisfy this definition 
of accuracy is only about   92.03%.  
13.5.[ADDRESS_734683] 98% of the n = [ADDRESS_734684] fall 
within ±15 mg/dL (±0.83 mmol/L)  of the comparator result (comparator < 75 mg/dL /4.16 mmol/L )) 
or ±20% of the comparator result (comparator ≥ 75 mg/dL /4.16 mmol/L ).  Thus, with n = 240, 
there must be at least 236 BGMS results satisfying this requirement.  This is equivalent to testing 
the hypotheses:  
H0: Prob{accurate}< 98.33% versus  the alternative:  
H1:        Prob{accurate } ≥   98.33%  
There is approximately a 95% chance of rejecting H0 in favor of H1 if the actual probability that a 
meter measurement would satisfy the ±15mg/dL or 20% is 98.33%.  Conversely, there is about a 
95% chance that the null will NOT be rejected if the actual probability that a result with the 
evaluation device would satisfy this definition of accuracy is only about   96.23%.   It is possible

Version : 14Oct2022         CONFIDENTIAL  
  
Page 23 of 42 that the sample size after the study is completed may not be exactly 240.  The critical values will 
be approximately 95% or 98% of results (first and second parts of primary objective, respectively), 
and the associated hypotheses will be adjusted to reflec t the change while maintaining no more 
than a 95% chance of rejecting the null hypotheses.  
13.6 Neonates < 24 hrs. old and Neonates in NICU  – Other Objectives  
In addition to the neonates less than 28 days of age, additional analyses of data from neonatal 
subjects ≤ [ADDRESS_734685] the laboratory instrument results (modified Bland -
Altman plot).

13.8 Bilirubin Analysis – Other Objectives   
For neonates who would have bilirubin results, regression analysis will be used to assess the effects 
of bilirubin on the difference between meter and laboratory reference method blood glucose 
measurements.  
There must be at least [ADDRESS_734689] deviation, minimum and maximum room temperature, and humidity will 
be computed.  
13.10  Data Evaluability  
Blood glucose data will be considered not evaluable for the following reasons:  
• Samples with no associated or valid hematocrit value.  
• Samples with no associated or valid Cobas 6000  value.

Page 24 of 42 • Failure to begin to separate the plasma from the red cells within [ADDRESS_734690].  
• The collected samples exceed a maximum of 5 h of sample withdrawal time, and 
will be kept at room temperature  (23 ± 5 °C) before evaluation.  
• For a given sample, the meter is missing a replicate.  
• Results of the g lucose analyzer blood sample  are not within ±4% of each other, 
100* (Rep2 -Rep1)/Rep1, or ±4mg/dL  (0.22mmol/L)  of each other (Rep2 -Rep1) 
if the average falls below 100mg/dL  (5.5mmol/L) . 
14.[ADDRESS_734691]/sample. The unique number will be entered on 
the CRFs. The site will create a procedure to de -identify subjects from samples so that the 
staff members documenting subject names will not have access to sample resul ts and the 
staff members testing the samples will not have access to subject names. A master list of 
subject names,  with their subject  IDs, will be kept by [CONTACT_559231].  
14.2 Study personnel will complete and sign all appropriate forms in compliance with GCP. 
CRFs should be completed legibly, in black or blue ink. If it is necessary to make 
corrections, a single line should be drawn through the original entry, the new entry is written 
in, and the correction initialed and dated by [CONTACT_559232].  
14.3 Study  data will be primarily collected through an electronic data capture ( EDC ) system 
used by [CONTACT_127007]. The d ata will be recorded on forms by [CONTACT_559233]. All source forms will be 
retained by [CONTACT_779].  
14.4 In addition to data collection, the EDC system will be used for data cleaning as well as 
monitoring operations. Site users will be trained on this system before the start of the study 
and their access to EDC system will be contingent upon successful comple tion of training 
requirements.

 Appendix B  - Instructions for Processing of Blood for the glucose analyzer  
 
Processing of Neonatal  Blood for laboratory glucose  analysis  
Once collected, process the microtainer tube for laboratory glucose analysis as follows:   
• Label all tubes with the subject number using a Sharpie®-like marker.   
• Gently invert the microtainer tube several times to mix the anticoagulant.  
• Centrifuge the whole blood immediately to separate the plasma from the red blood cells.  The 
centrifugation start time must occur within [ADDRESS_734714].  The timing 
of all meter testing/centrifugation will be recorded on the appropriate CRF.   
• It is recommended that after centrifugation, the plasma is transferred from the microtainer tube 
to a small clean tube or container with a cap.   Ensure the tube is labeled and the cap is secured , 
and proceed  with the site’s laboratory glucose analyzer procedures .  
• The plasma will be tested in duplicate with the laboratory analyzer within [ADDRESS_734715], plasma samples may be 
refrigerated .  
• Insufficient (or suspected to be insufficient) samples, missing samples, and other sample issues 
should be recorded in the CRF and on the glucose analyzer  printout , as appropriate.  If a sample 
is hemolyzed, record it in the CRF.

 Appendix C - Instructions for Tracking Accuracy and Precision of the 
Laboratory Glucose Analyzer  
Procedure for Tracking Accuracy and Precision of Site Laboratory Analyzer  
Performance of the Cobas 6000  will be assessed to ensure accuracy.  Analyzer performance will 
be tracked by [CONTACT_392577]: the Laboratory Analyzer QC procedure regularly applied by [CONTACT_42042] , and the testing of serum controls provided by [CONTACT_127007] . 
The following are the procedures required for each method:  
I. Laboratory Analyzer QC Procedure  
The Cobas 6000  will be maintained and operated according to the instructions in the 
manufacturer’s operating manual by [CONTACT_779]’s lab specifications/SOP previously reviewed by [CONTACT_360936]. 
Before the study begins, the analyzer will be set up and the appropriate maintenance will be 
performed.  
The site will perform glucose analyzer control tests in accordance with the site ’s quality control 
check  procedures and requirements.  Site staff will keep a log for the analyzer, including daily 
operational checks and maintenance.  
II. Ascensia Serum Controls1 
A set of three  serum control levels will be provided to the investigator to document the 
performance of the Cobas [ADDRESS_734716] been assayed by a 
method traceable to one proposed for use as a national glucose reference method.  
Serum Control Testing Schedule:  
• Pre-study: The controls will be assayed (singlet readings) on the  Laboratory Analyzer for 
at least three runs prior to the assay of subject samples. The runs will occur over at least 
three days, if possible.  The data will be sent to the Ascensia Study Ma nager, or designee, 
for review before the study begins.  
• Once the study begins, serum control testing should be completed on each Analyzer on the 
Monday and Friday of the first week , and then on one day for each week that the study 
continues.   
• Record all data on the CRF.  One reading will be recorded for each control level (for a total 
of 3 readings per run).   
 
 
1 Caution: The serum glucose traceability controls are human serum -based and must be handled using universal 
precautions.

Proper Handling of Ascensia Serum Controls  
Ascensia  completed the characterization of serum controls purchased from Bio -Techne® (formerly 
Bionostics). During the characterization, staff observed that sample stratification during thawing 
can occur if the control vials are not handled judiciously. The recommended procedure is as 
follows.  
• Store the frozen controls in a -20C freezer upon arrival.  
• Thaw the frozen control amber glass vials at 2 -8ºC for 2 -3 days in the refrigerator.  Each 
vial holds approximately 2.0 mL.  
• Before opening, mix the vials well by [CONTACT_559240] 10 times.  
• Prepare an aliquot of each level in capped microcentrifuge tubes.  Cap tightly.  We prefer 
Fisherbrand™ Microcentrifuge 0.5mL tubes (PN 02 -681-333) with O -ring seal caps (PN 
02-681-358).  
• Store any remaining control in the amber glass vials at 2 -8ºC. 
• Before running a control sample on the laboratory analyzer, mix the aliquot tubes by [CONTACT_559241].  
• At the beginning of each day, remix the amber glass vials and refill the aliquot tubes.  When 
not in use, store the aliquots at 2 -8ºC. 
• The thawed control use life is two weeks.  Discard all thawed control —aliquot tubes and 
amber glass vials —after two weeks.  
• Since slow thawing for 2 -3 days is recommended, it is advisable to keep an extra thawed 
set available for testing.

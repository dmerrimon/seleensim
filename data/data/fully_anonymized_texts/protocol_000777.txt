observed that nurses use suction swabs and tonsil suction devices for removing oropharyngeal secretions. 
Preliminary Studies:  High Resource Utilization, Large Volume of Secretions, Oral Suction Strategies 
Our preliminary work has focused on airway management of critically ill patients who require MV. We found 
that development of VAP is associated with up to $40K per case in additional costs, along with longer LOS.
13,112 Our work has identified that frequency of oropharyngeal suction varies widely, and that the tonsil 
suction device is preferred.26-28 In a simulated laboratory setting, we determined that the oropharyngeal suction 
catheter was more effective than either a suction swab or tonsil suction device in removing oropharyngeal secretions.
99 Two oropharyngeal suction catheters are included in oral care kits used on MV patients at the 
study site to be used concurrently with tooth brushing; however, average use is only 0.[ADDRESS_870815] large volumes of oropharyngeal secretions that can be potentially aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3831].25,93,113 In preliminary 
work, we suctioned an average of 7.5 mL of secretions within a 4-hour interval, although volumes as high as 
25 mL were removed.25 Secretion removal can be achieved with < [ADDRESS_870816] not identified any issues when 
using the oropharyngeal suction catheter.25,93 In a recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 13 critically ill subjects, we found that all 
subjects had α-amylase present in the oral secretions, and 6 (46%) had α-amylase detected in the first tracheal 
sample.[ADDRESS_870817] α-amylase procedures and the intervention. A second specimen obtained 
one to four hours later (when ETT suctioning was needed) showed only 4 subjects (31%) with α-amylase in the 
tracheal secretions, and a lower value in those positive. The study established our ability to measure α-
amylase in the APH Specialty Diagnostic Laboratory with precision and quality controls. It also provided data 
that microaspi[INVESTIGATOR_649661]. Our co-investigator, [CONTACT_649734], has studied biomarkers for microaspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].114-[ADDRESS_870818] a reduction in 
microaspi[INVESTIGATOR_649662] α-amylase (1.1) 
and mean values of α-amylase (1.2). 
A secondary aim is to compare the effects of t he NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649663]-free days. By [CONTACT_649717] r microaspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], VAC should be reduced. Our working 
hypotheses are that the subjects in the NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649664] a lower rate of VAC (2.1) and longer duration of VAC-free days (2.2). Another secondary aim is to explore changes in the ratio of α-amylase in the 
tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_649665]. Our work ing hypothesis is that subjects in the NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649666] a lower tracheal/oral α-amylase ratio over time (3.1).

service. [CONTACT_649735] is the Director of the Center for Nursing Research, and [CONTACT_649736] holds an appointment as a nurse scientist, in addition to her faculty role. The APH Pediatric Specialty Diagnostic Laboratory is part of 
Orlando Health, and will run the α-amylase assays. [CONTACT_649734] (co-investigator) provides leadership for the 
laboratory, and is an expert in biomarkers of microaspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. Drs. Talbert and Xan are faculty members at 
UCF and will be involved in data management and analysis. Team members have worked together on many 
previous studies, including our R21. 
Sample. Subjects (n=560) will be enrolled if they meet the following inclusion criteria: 1) 18 years of age or 
older; 2) orally intubated with ETT and treated with MV; 3) 24 hours or less since intubation; and 4) expected to 
be intubated for at least 36 hours after enrollment. Exclusion criteria are: 1) documented aspi[INVESTIGATOR_649669]; 2) intubation to treat known aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] ; 3) treatment with rescue MV therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (high-frequency 
oscillator ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation); 4) re-intubation for any reason; 5) contraindications to receiving the intervention (e.g., oral  injuries); 6) history of lung or head/neck cancers that 
may produce α-amylase in the lungs; 7) history of disease that affects saliva production (e.g., Sjögren's 
syndrome); and 8) prisoners. Eligible subjects are ava ilable. In fiscal year 2012, 1,641 patients were treated 
with MV on the study units (median=4 days; mean=6.2 days). On average, [ADDRESS_870819] a large pool of patients who are highes t risk:  trauma, burn, and neurological conditions.
[ADDRESS_870820] a 15% reduction in the proportion of specimens that 
are positive for α-amylase (primary aim) at an alpha level of .05 with a power of .87 (H1.1). The sample size 
will be able to detect differences in mean values of α-amylase with an effect size (d) of .25, alpha .05, and 
power of .80 (H1.2). Since VAC, our secondary aim, is a newer measure, we used data from recent studies to 
provide sample estimates. A final sample size of [ADDRESS_870821] a 12.7% reduction in VAC with an 
alpha of .05 and power of .80 (H2.1).  We will overenroll by 40% to account for attrition, for a targeted 
enrollment of [ADDRESS_870822] used successfully in previous studies. 
We also incorporated procedures described by [CONTACT_649718],109 Metheny,18,19 Munro (our consultant),73,[ADDRESS_870823] conducted intervention studies to prevent complications in MV patients. 
Screening and Enrollment of Subjects . A convenience sample of eligible subjects will be enrolled after ICU 
admission, within 24 hours of intubation . Our goal is to enroll subjects as soon as possible to maximize the 
effects of the intervention. Munro demonstrated the ability to recruit similar patients within 24 hours,73,120 and 
we will use her expertise as we implement the study.  Nseir used a 48-hour recruitment window in a study

(RA) will be available for [ADDRESS_870825] experience caring for patients on MV. The PD will coordinate all staffing and will develop a master schedule; flexible and variable shifts will be offered to ensure 
coverage for enrollment and delivering the intervention. We have a plan in place to ensure coverage and are 
committed to success. 
Randomization . Our biostatistician will oversee the process of randomization of subjects to either the NO-
ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649670]. He will develop a blo cked randomization procedure, using different sized 
blocks, to ensure balanced assignment without being able to predict group assignment.
166 Because many 
subjects will be intubated with the specialized SS-ETT (about 65% from historical data), we will stratify 
randomization by [CONTACT_649719]-ETT are 
randomly assigned to each group. Stratification will help to address type of tube as a potential confounding 
variable, and will allow for secondary sub-group analysis. A member of the study team not involved in data 
collection will place group assignments for each ty pe of ETT in numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes. Upon 
enrollment, study personnel will identify the type of  ETT, and open the appropriate envelope to determine 
group assignment. Only study team members who prov ide the intervention will know the subjects’ assigned 
groups. ICU personnel, as well as subjects and family members, will be blinded to the assignment.  Research Strategy                                                                                             Page 84Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Sole, Mary Lou

RA will collect baseline data, implement 
the assigned intervention (NO-
ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649672]/sham), and 
collect specimens. The RA will then implement the intervention as designated by [CONTACT_649720] 4 hours. Figure 4 
summarizes the procedures for each 
group. 
To control for possible differences in 
usual oral care practices, the RA will 
perform oral cleansing and suctioning with a suction swab after delivering the NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649673]. The RA will also perform 
tooth brushing every 12 hours. Oral antisepsis will be done after obtaining specimens for α-amylase. Some 
subjects may require additional oral suctioning for secretion management; staff will use the available tonsil 
suction device for oral suctioning in-between the scheduled interventions and document in the medical record. 
Additional necessary oral suctioning will be recorded and controlled for, if applicable.

Figure 2D) and is one that we tested in the simulated setting as being most effective in removing 
oropharyngeal secretions.
99 Figure 5 compares secretion removal with a suction swab (usual care) versus the 
oropharyngeal suction catheter. This length and pliability of the oropharyngeal suction catheter facilitate manipulation of the catheter around the ETT to reach secretions in the oropharynx . In contrast, suction swabs 
and tonsil suction devices are shorter and rigid, and do not reach secretions that pool in the oropharynx.   
During the intervention, the 
oropharyngeal suction catheter will be repositioned to reach both 
sides of the mouth and the 
oropharynx. Suctioning will be done using standard suction pressures until secretions are no longer audible or visible, for a duration of about [ADDRESS_870826] response will be 
observed and the procedure will 
be stopped if intolerance is noted.  
Usual Care/Sham Intervention. A usual care/sham intervention will be delivered to those in the usual care 
group. Trained RAs will insert the suction catheter into the subject’s mouth and mimic the suction procedure for 45 seconds without occluding the suction port. The us ual care/sham intervention will be done every 4 hours. 
Data Collection. Data will be collected at enrollment and at regular intervals (Table 1), including demographic 
and physiological data to describe the sample and test equivalence between groups . We will also collect data 
related to factors that might influence microaspi[INVESTIGATOR_649676]. We anticipate having [ADDRESS_870827] will be allott ed for delivering the intervention and obtaining specimens.

Scheduled times for the intervention will be determined (e.g., 0800, 1200, 1600 military time). The RA will 
begin the shift and deliver the intervention per study arm to the first scheduled subject. The procedure will be repeated until the intervention has been delivered to all subjects per schedule. Hand hygiene and infection 
prevention measures will be strictly followed. We will allow a 30-minute window before and after the scheduled 
time to deliver the intervention to account for patient care activities. If the subject is off the unit during the scheduled time, it will be delivered upon return to the unit. De lays or omissions in providing the intervention will 
be recorded in the study record. These data will allow us to calculate the number of scheduled interventions 
that are completed each day (dose), which may be useful in interpreting findings.

specimens will be frozen to -20  C until the assays are run. A compact medical lab freezer, used solely for 
purposes of this study, will be purchased and located on or near one of the study units for easy storage. 
Specimens will be regularly transported on ice to the APH Specialty Diagnostic Laboratory.  
Endpoints . The intervention will be delivered per protocol until one of the following endpoints is met 
(whichever occurs first):  1) ETT removed (extubation); 2) tracheostomy performed; 3) 14 days of enrollmen t; 
or 4) other exclusion criterion met (e.g., rescue ventilation). Extending the intervention to 14 days will allow us 
a better opportunity to address the secondary aim of VAC. At the study site, the median time to tracheostomy 
is 8 days; 85% of patients on prolonged MV undergo a tracheostomy by [CONTACT_2006] 14.

enrollment of [ADDRESS_870836] procedures (See Appendix A). Laboratory 
personnel will be blinded to study group. Alpha-amylase activity in the paired samples will be analyzed using the Stanbio α-amylase LiquiColor Reagent Kit. The recommended procedure was modified for a microplate 
reader. Each run of samples is accompanied by [CONTACT_649722], and the controls are evaluated before results are 
released. A 10 µl sample is placed in a microplate well, and 200 µl of Α-amylase LiquiColor reagent, which has 
been pre-warmed to 37 C, is added to each sample and mixed. The increase in absorbance is measured at 
405nm in a spectrophotometer in 3-minute intervals for [ADDRESS_870837] curve of α-amylase in µmol/min/ml, which will be converted to U/L. An α-amylase value 
of 0.6 µmol/min/ml will be considered positive. No am ylase should be detected; the value 0.6 µmol/min/ml is 
the lowest possible concentration of amylase that can be detected with the method’s analytic sensitivity. After detection, the total values of α-amylase in secretions will be recorded. Amylase that is detected would be either 
of oropharyngeal or gastrointestinal origin; however, in this setting and location of sampling, presence from pancreatic source would be unlikely. Indeed the additional step of using a specific inhibitor for salivary amylase 
was shown to be not necessary in airway samples during our preliminary study. The paired oral-tracheal 
samples evaluated in the preliminary study detected large amounts of α-amylase in the oral secretions of all 
subjects, and smaller amounts in those who also had positive results in in tracheal secretions.
[ADDRESS_870838]. For hypothesis 1.2, the mean values of α-amylase will be calculated.  
VAC.  VAC will be determined using the CDC/NHSN criteria (Figure 6, blue boxes).16 We will assess ventilator 
data (FiO 2 and PEEP) daily from the medical record to assess for worsening oxygenation status. Per 
consultation with [CONTACT_649737], we will assess for VAC for [ADDRESS_870839] the time to VAC

monitor and promote adherence, and document 
potential issues. To control for usual oral care 
practices, we will deliver oral care suctioning and cleansing/antisepsis interventions to both groups. We will also record documentation of 
additional oral suctioning interventions and 
method/tolerance of enteral feedings. Although 
random assignment of subjects to groups should address potential confounders, we will compare 
data between groups and control statistically if differences are noted.  
Data Management and Integrity. We will record data in electronic format, using spreadsheet or database 
software, on tablet or laptop computers that are passw ord protected and used solely for the study. Computers 
will be stored in a locked secured area when not in us e. We will use the software data validation features 
and/or filters for as many variables as possible to ensure accuracy of data entry, including missing data and 
out-of-range values. These features allow for drop down sele ction of findings, and specifications of parameters 
for values that are expected to be recorded. We have successfully used similar pr ocedures in previous studies 
to ensure consistency and accuracy of data collect ion. [CONTACT_649738] will oversee data management and integrity 
for the study, and will be assisted by [CONTACT_187284]. He ha s past experience in this role on NIH-funded grants, and is 
an expert at managing large databases. The PD will monitor study records to ensure completeness. Accuracy of the data collected from the EMR will be reviewed for 10% of subjects during the first month of the study. 
Errors will be corrected, and re-training will be done as necessary. Following the initial audit, 5% of the files will 
be audited quarterly for completeness and accuracy; we will create an audit trail to identify and correct issues 
and/or errors.
123 If causes of error other than random variation are identified, we will change our procedures. 
Data Analysis   
Subjects will be randomly assigned to each of the two treatment groups at 1:[ADDRESS_870843] differences between 
the two groups. For categorical demographic variables, the Pearson’s chi-square test will be used to examine differences between the two groups. If subject subsets are found to be significantly different for a demographic variable, then this variable will be included into the st atistical models. All planned analyses will be based on the 
intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which consists of  all subjects who have been randomized into the NO-
ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649670]. In all analyses, an alpha level of 0.05 will be used.

NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649690]. Since we will be delivering oral hygiene, we will communicate 
well with the nursing staff to avoid duplication of procedures. Prior to the study, we will provide information 
sessions for staff (nurses and RTs) to outline roles of study team members and reinforce existing protocols. 
We will assess the medical record for additional oral suctioning done by [CONTACT_15228]. We will use standard unit supplies for usual care from the oral care kit, and label components to assess if supplies are used by [CONTACT_2312]. Additional suction swabs and catheters are not available to the staff beyond those included in the kit. If the patient needs additional suctioning to manage secretions, the tonsil suction device is readily available. We will promote adherence to existing protocols for head of bed elevation, daily interruption of sedation for weaning 
assessment, enteral feeding management, and ETT cuff pressure.  We will monitor these interventions during 
rounds, reinforce adherence, and document findings. We will record information related to potential 
confounders from the EMR. We will compare equivalence between groups and control statistically if indicated. Standard practices to prevent microaspi[INVESTIGATOR_649691]. We will monitor for potential influences of any new practices, and we will include them in the analyses if warranted.  Random assignment of 
subjects to groups should address potential issues. We will also use the expertise of our consultants.

amylase as a biomarker for microaspi[INVESTIGATOR_649692] a specific measure of migration of oral secretions 
from the oropharynx to the lungs. We considered measuring pepsin; however, it has a short window for 
detection after aspi[INVESTIGATOR_649693]. Although α -amylase is a newer biomarker for Research Strategy                                                                                             Page 89Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Sole, Mary Lou
microaspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], the rationale for its use is strong since α-amylase is present in oral secretions and detection in 
tracheal secretions indicates aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. We have spoken with other researchers who have tested this 
biomarker and are confident in our decision.[ADDRESS_870850] also specified exclusion criteria to ensure accuracy of 
findings (e.g., Sjögren's syndrome). Some researchers hav e used cultures of the endotracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_649694] a 
marker of microaspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].15,109  However, culture results are not always precise, are expensive, and may be 
influenced by [CONTACT_649727]. Using cultures only informs of microbial growth in secretions, not 
specifically aspi[INVESTIGATOR_649695].  
VAC as an Outcome Measure . The VAE algorithm published by [CONTACT_6750]/NHSN will be used to determine 
VAC.[ADDRESS_870851] developed a staffing plan to ensure coverage by [CONTACT_3462] 18 hours/day, [ADDRESS_870852] is complex; 
however, we are confident that we conduct the study as planned and will readily use our consultants’ expertise.  
Recruitment and Retention.  Although unanticipated delays in subject recruitment are common in studies of 
critically ill subjects, we have been successful in enrolling subjects with similar inclusion and exclusion criteria 
in prior studies. We have a strong working relationship with the medical staff, nurse managers, and staff nurses on the units. We will also use the expertise of our consultant, [CONTACT_435591], who has conducted large NIH-funded clinical trials with similar populations. We have identified a conservative approach for recruitment and retention 
of subjects over [ADDRESS_870853] very restrictive inclusion/exclusion criteria, and only 1-[ADDRESS_870854] the study 
over 4 years (Table 2). We have allocated [ADDRESS_870855] been logically and systematically conducted to gui de this intervention study. The study has a great 
potential for improving patient outcomes and will pr ovide data to develop evidence-based practices for 
secretion removal. Findings may also result in methods for earlier detection and treatment of potential aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. A strong multi-professional team, including internationally-known consultants, has been convened.  
Strong support for clinical research is provided by [CONTACT_649728]. Table 2:  Project Timeline

Human Subjects  
A. HUMAN SUBJECTS INVOLVEMENT, CHARACTERISTICS, AND DESIGN 
Describe the proposed involvement of human subjects in the work outlined in the Research Strategy 
section.  
The population for this study is critically ill patients w ho have an ETT who require mechanical ventilation (MV) 
support. Considering power analysis calculations, we propose to enroll 560 subjects to achieve a final sample 
size of 400 subjects randomized to either the NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649670].  Subjects will be critically ill 
patients, age 18 and older, who are admitted to one of the ICUs at Orlando Regional Medical Center (ORMC):  Trauma, Neuroscience, Multi-System (medical-surgical), and Cardiac. Subjects will have an oral ETT, and 
require MV as part of their treatment. The project populat ion will include: women, children (age 18-20), elderly, 
inner city and rural, low-income groups, minority populations, and those with trauma as well as chronic 
disease.  
Recent data from the study setting show that 65% of patients are male, with an average age of 53 years. Over 
half of patients admitted to the study units receive MV. Patients who are aged 18-20 represent 9% of the study 
population, and 36% are 65 years of age or older. Using similar inclusion and exclusion criteria as proposed in 
this study, we were able to enroll a diverse sample in prior studies.   
Describe and justify the sampling plan, as well as the recruitment and retention strategies and the 
criteria for inclusion or exclusion of any subpopulation.  
Subjects (n=560) will be enrolled if they meet the follo wing inclusion criteria: 1) 18 years of age or older; 2) 
orally intubated with ETT and treated with MV; 3) 24 hours or less since intubation; and 4) expected to be 
intubated for at least 36 hours after enrollment. Exclusion criteria are: 1) documented aspi[INVESTIGATOR_649696]; 2) intubation to treat known aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]; 3) treatment with rescue MV therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (high-frequency oscillator ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation); 4) re-intubation for any reason; 5) contraindications to receiving the intervention (e.g., oral  injuries); 6) history of lung or head/neck cancers that 
may produce α-amylase in the lungs; 7) history of disease that affects saliva production (e.g., Sjögren's 
syndrome); and 8) prisoners.  
The Project Director (PD) and Research Assistants (RAs) will make rounds in the units on a regular basis (in 
between the scheduled interventions) to assess eligibilit y of new admissions. The PD or RA will explain the 
study and seek informed consent from patients that are able to provide their own consent, or from the legally-authorized representative (LAR). The consent form will be available in Spanish, and translators are available at 
the Orlando Health system for those who do not read or speak English.  
Adequate subjects are available to complete the study  and represent a broad cross section of critically-ill 
patients. The number of MV patients per day averages [ADDRESS_870856] had adequate representati on of children (18-20 years of age), women, and 
racial/ethnic minorities.  
Our past experiences conducting research in the clinical setting with the same patient population will enhance our ability to recruit and retain subjects. The continued presence of the PD and RAs throughout the study should facilitate retention of subjects. RAs will be readily available to discuss the study and answer questions as they arise. We will also use our consultant, [CONTACT_435591], to guide us. 
Explain the rationale for the involvement of special vulnerable populations. 
We will include children ages 18-20 who meet eligibility cr iteria. Approximately 9% of the population is in this 
age range. In particular, younger patients are admitted to the surgical/trauma critical care service line. Patients 
with burn, trauma, and neurological injury are at highest risk for infection, and are often younger. Therefore, it is important to include this age group.  
We will include the elderly as they are at an increased risk for complications of MV secondary to chronic illness 
and decreased immune response, and their mortality for VAC (lung injury) is higher than younger patients.
128 
We will also include pregnant women because if they require MV, oral care interventions are not any different for them, and the NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649697].  
Although children less than 18 years of age are sometimes treated in the adult ICUs, we will exclude them 
because the VAC criteria specifically note applicability only to those 18 years of age and older.
16  
We will exclude prisoners.  Protection of Human Subjects                                                                                  Page 91Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Sole, Mary Lou
Describe procedures for assignment to a study group. As related to human subjects’ protection, 
describe and justify the selection of an intervention’s dose, frequency, and administration. 
Our biostatistician will oversee the process of randomization of subjects to either the NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649698]. He will develop a blocked randomization procedure, using different sized blocks, to ensure 
balanced assignment without being able to predict group assignment.166 Because many subjects (about 65% 
to 70% from historical data) will be intubated with the specialized subglottic suction ETT (SS-ETT), we will stratify randomization by [CONTACT_649729]-ETT to ensure that approximately half of those with and without the SS-ETT will be randomly assigned to each group. This will help to address type of tube as a potential confounding variable, and will allow for secondary sub-group analysis. A member of the study team, who will 
not be involved in data collection, will place group assignments in sequentially-numbered, sealed, opaque 
envelopes for each type of ETT. Upon enrollment, study personnel will identify the type of ETT inserted, and 
open the appropriate envelope to determine group assignm ent. Only study team members who provide the 
intervention will know the subjects’ assigned groups. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66417], as well as subjects and their family members, will be blinded to group assignment.  
The NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649672]/sham intervention will be administered by a member of the research team 
every [ADDRESS_870857]’s need for ETT suctioning.  
List any collaborating sites where human subjects research will be performed, and describe the role of 
those sites and collaborating investigators in performing the proposed research. Explain how data from the site(s) will be obtained, managed, and protected. 
Subjects will be patients in one of the ICUs at Orlando Regional Medical Center. The study team has extensive 
experience conducting clinical studies in these units. Three of our co-investigators are employees at the site. 
[CONTACT_506561] is chairman of the corporate Critical Care Committee, which will facilitate communication across 
units. As Director for the Center for Nursing Research , [CONTACT_649735] helps to establish collaborations between 
the university and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. [CONTACT_649734] oversees the APH Specialty Diagnostic Laboratory where the α-amylase 
assays will be run. Additionally, [CONTACT_649736] has an appointment as a Nurse Scientist at the agency, which also facilitates collaboration and the ability to conduct research in the setting.  
Data will be recorded in electronic means on password-protected computers. The subject’s medical record 
number will be used to retrieve study-related data from the electronic medical record (EMR). All subjects will be 
issued a unique code that will be recorded in the research files. All data will be de-identified for final analysis and findings will be reported in aggregate. A key, pairing the medical record number and unique identification code, will be kept separate from all data in a locked file in [CONTACT_649736]’s research office at UCF. Access to this information will be limited and only on a “need-to-know” basis.  
B.  SOURCES OF MATERIALS  
Describe the research material obtained from living individuals in the form of specimens, records, or 
data.  
The research materials for this study include data from the subject’s medical record and observation. Oral 
secretion and sputum specimens (endotracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]) for assays of α-amylase  will be obtained at baseline 
and every [ADDRESS_870858] described in the 
application.  
At baseline (enrollment), we will collect demographic, physiological, and ventilator data (Table 1). Data include 
age, gender, ethnicity, race, diagnosis, ETT information (type of tube and time of intubation), and severity of illness data. Physiological data will be obtained from the medical record at time of enrollment and per schedule (either daily or every 4 hours):  temperature, vital signs, and sedation score. Information related to types of 
enteral tubes and nutritional support will be collected. Ventilator data will include mode of ventilation, set 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], positive end expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111], pre ssure support, and fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401]. Ventilator 
data will assist in determining VAC. Temperature and results of tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_649699] 92Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Sole, Mary Lou
the EMR for secondary analysis of infection or non-infection related VAC. Upon completion of the study, 
additional outcome data will include ICU length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation and cost data from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_649700]. 
Indicate who will have access to individually identifiable private information about human subjects.  
Study personnel who are collecting data from the EMR will have access to the medical record number to 
access study-related data. All data will be colle cted to meet HIPAA regulations and will be treated 
confidentially. All subjects will be issued a unique i dentification number so that data cannot be personally 
identified. All files (paper and electronic) will be coded wi th this identification number. Subjects’ medical record 
numbers will be cross-referenced to identification number s, and will be kept separate from all data collection 
forms in a locked cabinet in one of [CONTACT_649736]’s research offices. Access to information will be limited to the 
members of the research team on a “need to know” basis . All research team members will sign a confidentiality 
agreement and will complete mandatory CITI training for protection of human subjects. Results for presentation and publication will be presented in a way that individual patients cannot be identified.  
Provide information about how the specimens, records, and/or data are collected, managed, and 
protected as well as whether material or data that include individually identifiable private information 
will be collected specifically for the proposed research project. 
All data will be recorded electronically into the study database per the subject’s unique identification number. 
Demographic and other physiological data will be retrieved from the subject’s medical record. Observational data will be collected during the scheduled intervention times per the study protocol. Study personnel will 
record all data in electronic format using a password-protected tablet or laptop computer. Data will be backed 
up to a secure server at the College of Nursing.  
C. POTENTIAL RISKS 
Describe the potential risks to subjects (physical, psychological, financial, legal, or other), and assess 
their likelihood and seriousness to the human subjects.  
The probability of adverse consequences to participants is minimal. Removal of secretions is an independent 
nursing action that is routinely done but not per ev idence-based protocol. We propose to enhance secretion 
removal through a protocol-driven procedure done every [ADDRESS_870859] performed this procedure (NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649701]) to obt ain specimens in previous studies without any 
adverse issues, such as gagging or oral trauma.
25,[ADDRESS_870860] for each patient, with supplies for oral suction, cleansing every 4 hours, and tooth 
brushing every 12 hours. We will use the same brand of or opharyngeal catheter that is packaged in the kits on 
a scheduled every-4-hour basis to those in the NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649702].  
All subjects will get usual care to prevent microaspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], including head of bed elevation, management of 
enteral feedings, assessment of readiness to wean fr om MV, and management of ETT cuff pressure within 
recommended ranges. Many subjects will be intubated with the specialized subglottic suction ETT.  
Trained members of the research te am will implement the NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649672]/sham interventions 
and collect data related to the study; all RAs will be experienced practitioners in management of patients on 
MV. Education and training is scheduled before beginning data collection and regularly throughout the study.  
We will purchase all study-related supplies, including the oropharyngeal suction catheters, sputum traps, and materials needed to run the α -amylase
 assays. No additional costs will be associated with participation.  
Where appropriate, describe alternative treatm ents and procedures, including the risks and potential 
benefits of the alternative treatments and pr ocedures, to participants in the proposed research. 
No alternate treatments are identified. 
D. RECRUITMENT AND INFORMED CONSENT   
Describe plans for the recruitment of subjects and the process for obtaining informed consent. If the 
proposed studies will include children, describe the process for meeting requirements for parental permission and child assent. Protection of Human Subjects                                                                                  Page 93Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Sole, Mary Lou
Subjects will be recruited from the study units at Orlando Regional Medical Center. The PI, PD, or RAs will 
review the medical records of newly admitted patients to  the study units. If a potential subject meets inclusion 
criteria, the study will be explained and a request for permi ssion to enroll will be made to the patient (if alert 
and oriented and able to give consent) or the LAR. RAs will collaborate with the staff nurses, charge nurses, and the intensivist teams to assist in identification of  potential subjects and to receive notification when the 
LAR is available. Our goal to enroll subjects as early as possible after admission; however, we need to ensure 
that the patient has been stabilized and that the patient or LAR is able to discuss participation.  
Include a description of the circumstances under which consent will be sought and obtained, who will seek it, the nature of the information to be provided to prospective subjects, and the method of 
documenting consent.  
The PI, PD, or RAs will obtain consent from the patient (if competent to provide consent) or the LAR as soon 
as feasible after admission, within the designated enr ollment period. Using data from previous studies, we 
expect that nearly all consents will come from the LA R. Study personnel will approach the patient or LAR, 
explain the study, and obtain consent for participation. From experience, we anticipate that 75% of LARs who 
are approached will give consent for participation. A st andard script will be developed for explaining the study 
and answering study-related questions. The consent process will be available in both English and Spanish, 
and an interpreter will be available if needed through the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s translation services.  
The consent form will include all required information:  purpose, number of subjects, procedures, risks and 
benefits, measures to protect confidentiality, and the organization’s required HIPAA statements. Consent will 
be documented. The patient or LAR will be given a copy of the signed consent form.  
If during the course of the study, a subject becomes alert enough to understand the study and research 
processes, and the LAR has provided initial consent for participation, we will obtain verbal assent (nodding) or writing (yes/no) for continuation in the study from the subject. Should the subject gain sufficient cognitive ability to provide consent while enrolled, the study personnel will obtain his/her signature [CONTACT_649733] 18-20 years of age, who are considered children for federal 
proposals. We will follow all rules and stipulations for enrolling this age group as specified by [CONTACT_649730]. The IRB treats those 18 years of age and older as adults who are able to provide their own consent (http://www.orlandohealth.com/pdf%20folder/IRB%20Policies%20&%20Procedures/11-14-08/400-
Children06-2008.pdf ).  
E. PROTECTION AGAINST RISK 
Describe planned procedures for protecting against or minimizing potential risks, including risks to 
privacy of individuals or confidentiality of data, and assess their likely effectiveness. 
During the study, patient safety will be of highest priority  and all standards of care for the ventilated patient will 
be followed. All study team members delivering the in tervention will receive training in both simulated and 
clinical settings before beginning the study, and periodic re-assessment of skills is scheduled throughout the 
study. The NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649703]. Intolerance will be assessed by a 20% or more increase in heart or respi[INVESTIGATOR_649704] a decrease in oxygen saturation below 85%. We will train RAs in all procedures, and monitor subjects for 
any adverse responses. The assigned critical care int ensivist physician will be notified immediately should any 
serious adverse events occur during the study.  
Subjects in both groups will have oral suctioning done every 4 hours. The NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649705]/sham group will be suctioned with the swab. 
We will use the same type of oral hygiene equipment (catheter and swab) readily available in the oral care kits 
for the NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649683]/sham interventions. We will regulate the suction pressure for 
oropharyngeal and ETT suction within recommended ranges. Subjects may awaken during the intervention. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], 25% of subjects awakened during the procedure; however, they returned to their resting state immediately after the procedure. Any oral intervention has the potential to increase gagging; however, we have 
not noted that to be an issue with the oropharyngeal suction catheter in our preliminary studies.  
Paired oral and tracheal specimens will be obtained for analysis of α-amylase. Tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_649706] 12 hours during a scheduled NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649707]/sham intervention if clinical 
assessment indicates that the subject needs to be suctioned through the ETT. Suctioning will be done per 
standard procedures using the closed ETT suction system and recommended suction pressures. The subject 
will be hyperoxygenated via the ventilator before the procedur e. ETT suctioning is regularly necessitated by [CONTACT_649731] 94Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Sole, Mary Lou
respi[INVESTIGATOR_105489]. We have used the same procedures in preliminary studies. Oral specimens will be 
obtained during the NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649672]/sham intervention. 
Existing standards of care to prevent microaspi[INVESTIGATOR_649708]. These interventions include head of bed elevation, management of enteral feedings, management of the 
subglottic suction ETT (if patient is intubated with the SS-ETT), maintaining the ETT cuff pressure within recommended ranges (20 and 30 cm H
2O), daily assessment of readiness to extubate, and oral antisepsis.  
All data will be coded to ensure confidentiality of informat ion. Members of the research team will be trained in 
measurement techniques and safety precautions for all interventions and related procedures. They will demonstrate proficiency in a simulated setting prior to initiation of the study, and on a regular basis. 
 
Where appropriate, discuss plans for ensuring necessary medical or professional intervention in the event of adverse effects to the subjects. Studies that involve clinical trials (biomedical and behavioral intervention studies) must include a general description of the plan for data and safety monitoring of clinical trials and adverse event reporting to the IRB, the NIH and others, as appropriate, to ensure the safety of subjects. 
The PI, [CONTACT_649736], will assume all responsibility for int egrity and safety of the proposed study, and will provide 
close oversight of all aspects of the study. We do not anticipate adverse issues related to the study; however, 
we will be vigilant in our assessment to identify any issues and work in collaboration with our intensivist co-investigators. The NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649709]. The assigned intensivist physician will be notified immediately should any serious adverse events 
occur during the study.  
At regular study team meetings, safety data will be reviewed, including compliance with the protocol, 
enrollment data, and any adverse events. Monthly m eetings will be held, and will be convened more frequently 
if indicated. Should any standards of care that might influence the conduct of the study change during the study, meetings will be held accordingly to discuss their impact on the study. The protocol should be designated as no more than minimal risk; therefore, frequency of review and monitoring of data should be 
adequate. All reporting as required by [CONTACT_649732]. All federal, state, local, university, 
and HIPAA regulations will be followed.  
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DMSB) will be established to oversee the study and 
review any adverse events. (See H .)  
F. POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF PROPOSED RESEARCH TO SUBJECTS AND OTHERS  
Discuss the potential benefits of the research to research participants and others.  Those assigned to the NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649710] y have a reduced risk of microaspi[INVESTIGATOR_649711]. It 
is also possible that subjects will have no direct benefit from the study. Patients in the future who are intubated 
and receiving mechanical ventilation may benefit  from knowledge gained from this study. 
Discuss why the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits to research participants and others. 
The NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649712]. It will help to identify standard oral suctioning practices and 
assess the benefits. The potential benefit of the intervention to future patients is very high if it results in a reduced rate of microaspi[INVESTIGATOR_649711]. 
G. IMPORTANCE OF THE KNOWLEDGE TO BE GAINED  
Discuss the importance of the knowledge gained or to be gained as a result of the proposed research.  Findings will be used to inform practice and establish standards of oral suctioning that can be incorporated into 
comprehensive airway management of the mechanically-v entilated patient. Knowledge of effectiveness of the 
NO-ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649713] a large sample of divers e critically ill patients w ill have great importance in 
influencing future practice to reduce microaspi[INVESTIGATOR_649714]. The study will yield important data to guide practice, and has the potential to influence types of oral care equipment that are most effective. It may 
also provide data for earlier detection of microaspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and guide treatment if needed. 
 
  Protection of Human Subjects                                                                                  Page 95Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Sole, Mary Lou
Discuss why the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to the importance of the knowledge that 
reasonably may be expected to result. 
The study is associated with minimal risks in that all study-related procedures are considered part of the care 
of the mechanically-ventilated patient. The knowledge to be gained will help to identify effective methods and 
establish standards of practice to prevent microaspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  
H. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
Since we are using a clinical trial approach, we will establish an independent Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board (DMSB) to oversee the study and review any adverse events. The DSMB will include an intensivist, a 
nursing manager, and a master’s or doctoral-prepared critical care nurse. None of the members will be directly 
associated with the project. The DSMB will be convened at the start of the study and will meet every [ADDRESS_870861]. Talbert (data manager) and the Project Director will prepare reports for the 
DMSB. The reports will include enrollment data and any issues or adverse events noted. The Board can request additional information to assist in safety monitoring. Written minutes of DSMB meetings with 
summaries of adverse events will be forwarded to the ORMC IRB and NIH according to established written 
procedures for each group. Determinations or recommendations for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_649715].

Inclusion of Women and Minorities 
 
Inclusion of Women 
In the critical care units where patients will be enrolled, women represent 35% of patients who require 
mechanical ventilation.  In our preliminary studies, we have recruited at least this percentage of women.  We 
anticipate that enrollment in this study will be similar to the demographics of the study units.  We will monitor 
demographic data on a regular basis to assess inclusion of  women in the study.  If issues are noted, we will 
identify and implement solution to ensure that women are represented.   
 
Inclusion of Minorities 
Patients who require mechanical ventilation represent racial and ethnic diversity.  In a recently completed 
study, we found that Hispanic or Latino patients represented 14% of the population, and non-whites comprised 28% of the population.  This diversity will facilitate our enrolling a diverse sample.  Based on our enrollment calculations, we anticipate that 15% of our subjects will be Hispanic or Latino, and at least 25% will represent racial groups other than white.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_649716].  We have achieved good diversity enrollment in  previous studies conducted on the study units.

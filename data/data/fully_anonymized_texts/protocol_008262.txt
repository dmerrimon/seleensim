vi. Evidence of recent alcohol or drug abuse.  
vii. History of poor cooperation, non- compliance with medical treatment, or unreliability. 
viii. Exposure to an investigational drug study within [ADDRESS_831110]'s health or well -being is threatened by [CONTACT_118862]. Such subjects should be

 The following are circumstances that would result in the subject's discontinuation from the study:  
 
 the subject experiences a serious adverse event rendering them unable to continue study participation;

enrollment into this study. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
model DFT015 (test article) or model SN60WF (control  article) in both eyes. To further 
reduce bias, all subjects and site assessors will be masked to subject treatment assignment 
until the end of the study.  
 
The first operative eye is defined as the eye with the worse BCDVA. If the BCDVA is the 
same in both  eyes, identify the right eye (OD) as the first operative eye. The second eye

 The schedule of visits is included as Table 9 -1 in the appendix.  
 
The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the safety and performance of ACRYSOF IQ EDF 
IOL at Month 6/Visit 4A. After all subjects complete Month 6/Visit 4A, the study database 
will be locked to conduct planned analyses. Results from these analyses will be used in a 
clinical study report for submission.

(Visit2/2A), Day 30 -60 (Visit 3A), and Day 120 -180 (Visit 4A). See Figure 9 -1 Study

curve testing) and all contrast sensitivity assessments will remain masked with regard to 
treatment assignment until after the final database lock. Alcon and site personnel will not

subject safety concern arise, refer to Section 13.10 of the protocol (Unmasking of the Study

4.3 Statistical Methods for Effectiveness  Analyses  
4.3.1 Primary Effectiveness  Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Monocular Distance Corrected Intermediate Visual  Acuity 
at [ADDRESS_519583] primary effectiveness endpoint (DCIVA) will be based on a two -sample 
t-test, with a type I error rate of 2.5%, 1 -sided. The difference in means (ACRYSOF IQ EDF 
IOL minus ACRYSOF IQ Monofocal IOL) and the associated two -sided 95% confi dence 
interval will be presented.  
 
The following SAS pseudocode will be used for the primary analysis:

Poolability of primary outcomes across sites will be assessed using a fixed effects model 
including main effects of treatment and site along with a treatment by [CONTACT_412049]. 
Subjects across sites will be con sidered poolable if the interaction effect is not significant at 
type I error of 0.15. If the interaction effect is significant, a mixed effects model will be used 
to estimate treatment effect. The following mixed effect models will be used and compared 
using Bayesian information criterion (BIC).  
 
1. A fixed effect for treatment and random effects for site and site by  [CONTACT_412050]  
 
2. A fixed effect for treatment and random effect for  site 
 
The model with smaller BIC will be selected as the final model to estimate treatment effect 
(Littell 2006). The SAS pseudocode for each of the above models are provided below.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Mesopic Contrast Sensitivity (With and Without  Glare)  
Contrast sensitivity testing is conducted at 1.5, 3.0, 6.[ADDRESS_519596] of a sample grating (represented as ‘S’ in Table 5 –2) 
followed by [ADDRESS_519597] levels for testing (represented by [CONTACT_15750] 1 to 
8 in Table 5 –2). A subject’s performance at each CPD is either an ‘S’, if only the sample 
grating is identified, or numbers 1 to 8 (with [ADDRESS_519598] 
that can be identified). Scores of ‘S’ are recorded as  [ADDRESS_519599] is 
unable to identify the sample grating at a particular CPD, the data for that CPD is considered 
missing and will be recorded as a -1 in the scoring form.  
 
The following table presents the manufacturer’s recommended lo g contrast sensitivity norms 
corresponding to the recorded scores of -1, 0, or 1 -8.

 Subjects who score a ( -1) i.e. are unable to see a targeted spatial frequency at any available 
contrast, including that of the reference patch, are assigned the lowest measurable value 
(corresponding to score of 0 in Table 5–2). The resulting mean will be preceded by [CONTACT_412065] (<) to indicate that the actual contrast sensitivity is less than 
the calculated value. Similarly, the resulting standard deviations and any other variability 
statistics calculate d from the data sets containing unmeasurable values ( -1) will be preceded 
by [CONTACT_412066] (>). The number and percentage of subjects who cannot 
see any contrast (i.e. scores of -1) will be recorded and tabulated for each spatial freque ncy to 
provide a qualitative extent of the bias. Descriptive statistics will include number of eyes, 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and additional percentiles (10th,

Approximately 220 subjects will be randomized to achieve 200 subjects who complete the

Effectiveness  
 
The proposed sample size (N = 200; 100 for each IOL group) provides >99% power for the 
superiority hypothesis test on mean monocular photopic dist ance corrected intermediate 
visual acuity (66 cm) when tested at the 0.025 level of significance (one -sided). This 
assessment assumes:  
 
Difference in DCIVA (66 cm) [logMAR]: Mean (SD) = -0.12 (0.18)  
The proposed sample size will provide 84% power for the n on-inferiority hypothesis with 
respect to mean photopic monocular best corrected distance visual acuity when tested at the  
0.05 level of significance (one -sided) with a non -inferiority margin of 0.1 logMAR assuming:  
 
Difference in BCDVA [logMAR]: Mean (SD) = 0.04 (0.16)  
The proposed sample size provides >99% power for the superiority hypothesis test on mean 
photopic monocular distance corrected near visual acuity (40 cm) when tested at the 0.025 
level of significance (one -sided). This assessment assumes:  
Difference in DCN VA (40 cm) [logMAR]: Mean (SD) = -0.12 (0.18)  
The proposed sample size will provide 94% power, with α=0.025, [ADDRESS_519603] a 
difference of 25% in proportion of subjects who respond “Never” to Q1 of the IOLSAT 
questionnaire (Overall, in the past 7 days , how often did you need to wear eyeglasses to 
see?), assuming a 50% rate in the ACRYSOF IQ EDF IOL group.

EDF IOL, the one -sided exact 95% upper confidence limit is less than 3%. Thus, with 
95% confidence the true adverse event rate is less than 3%.

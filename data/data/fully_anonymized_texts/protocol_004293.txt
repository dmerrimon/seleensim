1.0 BACKGROUND  
Depression is a recurrent and persistent disorder associated with impairment in multiple domains and 
i
ncreased risk for substance use disorders and suicide (e.g., Costello, Erkanli, & Angold, 2006; Reinecke 
& Curry, 2008). Therefore, finding efficacious treatments for depression in adolescents is critical. Medications can reduce depression in youth, but they also can have undesirable side effects (Vitiello & Swedo 2004). Psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_309192], although the overall effect sizes have been modest (e.g., ES=.34; Weisz, McCarty, & Valeri, 
2006). A review of 52 RCTs testing the efficacy of psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_309193], found that both Interpersonal Psychotherapy [IPT (ES = .56)] and Cognitive Behavioral 
Therapy [CBT ( ES = .46)] were significantly more beneficial than most control conditions at post-
treatment and at follow -up (Zhou et al., 2015). Thus, efficacious treatments for youth depression exist, 
but there is still room to improve upon these treatments. There remains a critical need to improve upon 
these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_309194].  
One v
ariable hypothesized to affect children's interpersonal relationships is their level of soci al cognitive 
development on abilities particularly relevant to social functioning (e.g., social perspective taking). This  
study will test whether an intervention that aims to increase social cognitive (SC) abilities will improve 
these skills in youth with depression. We focus on the particular social cognitive abilities of perspective 
taking/theory of mind (ToM), because impairment in these skills has been associated with greater 
difficulties in interpersonal relationships and with depression (e.g., Bora & Burk, 2016; Nestor, 
Sutherland, & Garber, 2022). Social perspective taking ability also has a clear link to the skill of cognitive reappraisal, which is taught in CBT (Garber et al., 2016). The Social Cognitive abilities that are the focus 
of this intervention include recognition that other people may not see things the same way one does, 
which helps people have a better understanding of others' thoughts and feelings. This is  particularly 
important when a person is experiencing disappointment or anger about what another person did or did not do. By [CONTACT_309208]'s perspective, the aim is for the person to see that their belief about the situation  might not be what is going on. 
Youths (ages 12-17) with depression diagnoses or clinical levels of depressive symptoms ( CDRS -R >3 5) 
will be randomly assigned to either the social  cognitive training enhanced CBT (CBT+SC T) or to CBT 
only. Pre- and post-treatment evaluations will assess social  cognitions  and depression. If the CBT+SCT 
intervention significantly improves children's SC abilities  and decreases their depressive symptoms, then 
this will substantially improve clinical care.  
2.0 SPECIFIC AIMS 
This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to treat youths ages 12- to 17-years -old who have a current 
diagnosis of a depressive disorder or high levels of depressive symptoms ( CDRS -R >35). The aim is to 
test the effects of CBT+SCT  for (1) increasing children’s social cognitive (SC) abilities. We also wil l 
examine the effects of the treatments on reducing depressive symptoms .  
Hypothesis : Adolescents receiving CBT+SCT  will show significantly higher levels of SC abilities at post-
intervention, controlling for pre-intervention levels, as compared to youth in CBT alone. Exploratory Hypothesis : Youth in CBT+SCT  will show significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms 
at post-intervention, controlling for baseline levels, as compared to youth in CBT only .

1.Seri
ous, current suicidality or in need of more intensive services (e.g., partial or inpatient programs)
2.Current substance or alcohol use disorders
3.A lifetime history of schizophrenia, psychosis, mania, or conduct disorder
4.0 ENROLLMENT /RANDOMIZATION Eligible participants  will be randomized to either CBT+SCT or CBT 
only; randomization will be stratified by  [CONTACT_309210]’ age (12-14, 15-17), sex, race/ethnicity , and current 
medication use.  
5.[ADDRESS_378925] an initial phone screen with parents/guardians to 
determine initial study eligibility of the child for the study. Participants who appear eligible following the 
phone screen will be invited to complete a diagnostic interview to verify study eligibility. 
Eligible teens will be randomly  assigned to one of the two individual treatments  with a Masters -level or 
PhD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_309195] 12 sessions and they will  complete  assessments before a nd after treatment  
Treatment appointments  will be scheduled at a time that is mutually  agreed upon among participants and 
providers – most  likely  afternoons  or early  evenings. Participants  taking medications  will be able to 
continue. All appointments may be conducted remotely (i.e., Zoom).  
Assessment s 
-- The first assessment is an interview with the parent and teen separately  to determine eligibility  for the study.  
-- Interviews  take about [ADDRESS_378926] -treatment evaluations  (about 60 minutes).  
-- Teens  also will complete measures on the computer administered by a research assistant (60 minutes). 
Treatment  
-- Eligible  teens will be assigned randomly to one of the treatments. Both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_309196], problem solving, assertive communication, engaging in positive activities, and realistic thinking. In 
addition, CBT +SCT  teaches additional skills for taking others’ perspectives.  
-- Teens  will meet remotely with a  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_309197] (about 50 minutes). Therapy sessions will be 
recorded via Zoom for quality control (i.e., to ensure that the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_309198]).  
-- Teens  will receive up to [ADDRESS_378927] if desired.  
Compensation for  participation 
Parents  and children  will be paid for completing the assessments . Gift cards (e.g., Amazon) will be given 
after completion of each assessment as follows:  
A parent and teen participant will be paid for completing all parts of the study as follows:
$[ADDRESS_378928] assessment (pre-treatment: to determine eligibility)  
If eligibl e and child participates in the study, then $[ADDRESS_378929]-treatment assessment
Payments will be made through gift cards ( e.g., Amazon), given after completion of each  assessment.
6.0  Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk 
Data and 
safety monitoring plan general description: The PIs will monitor the accuracy (reliability and 
validity) of all data collected. All measures were selected based in part on their established levels of 
reliability and validity. All data will be checked for errors prior to any analysis. Assessment data will be 
obtained through online electronic forms and on standard paper -and-pencil forms as needed; all 
interviews will be audio-recorded, and responses will be recorded on standard forms. Data will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_309211]. All data will be stored in a secure, shared Box folder with locked 
sharing permissions using the SAFER add-on. Participants will be identified by [CONTACT_309212]; 
names and other possible identifiers will not be included in the electronic database. Identification 
numbers do not reveal the identity of participants (e.g., no birth dates, initials, social security numbers). An archival record of all data collected that has passed through the above-noted checks will be maintained on a secured server.  
R61 MH115125 [ADDRESS_378930]: A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) monitor s the clinical trial 
and serves as a reporting body to the NIH as well as to the respective IRBs. The primary role of the 
DSMB is to monitor the safety of participants in both intervention conditions, receive reports of all 
adverse events in a timely and consistent fashion, and check the validity and integrity of the data. The 
DSMB is composed of three members, none directly involved in the project or employed by [CONTACT_28144]. The DSMB consists of experts knowledgeable in several areas relevant to this study including social cognitive development and emotion regulation in children and adolescents ( Janice 
Zeman, Ph.D.), prevention and treatment of depression in youth (Jane Gillham, Ph.D.) and biostatistics 
(Scott Maxwell , Ph.D.).  
Data monitoring and participant safety : The DSMB first will review and approve the protocol and 
subsequently conduct annual reviews to determine whether participant safety has been adequately safeguarded and enrollment goals have been met. The DSMB will be informed of any protocol -related 
serious adverse events when they occur. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_309199] ; the DSMB also will be called upon to render judgments if any 
serious clinical problems (e.g., serious suicidal intent) occur. The DSMB will serve as the final arbiters of 
whether individual participants should be removed from the study. The DSMB also will be called upon to 
render judgments when any serious clinical problems (e.g., serious suicidal intent) occur. Psychiatric or other life crises that are high risk and imminent will be acted upon immediately with staff linking 
participants to appropriate crisis services. These are reviewed immediately with the clinically responsible 
PI. Lower risk and less imminent crises are reviewed within 48 hours by [CONTACT_152314]. Interim analyses will be conducted at each annual review for safety only, not effectiveness. Assuming there are no safety issues, we will prepare the data for analysis.  
Critical Incident Protocol & Reporting of Adverse Events:  We will collect interview and questionnaire 
data that could indicate potential harm to participants (e.g., participants expressing intent to harm self or others, or data indicating child, spousal, elder or other forms of abuse or neglect). The Critical Inci dent 
Protocol  will be triggered if a participant reveals information indicating possible or actual harm to 
themselves or others. Information collected by [CONTACT_309213] a day of data collection. All adverse events  or unanticipated problems involving risk to participants or 
others will be reported to the appropriate agency as required including the IRB, specific state agenc y and 
stakeholders ( TN), the Data Safety and Monitoring Board, and the National Institute of Mental Health. 
The clinically responsible PIs will monitor and report any adverse events. The PIs also will supervise all study staff, interviewers, and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_309200]. 
Adverse events and clinical worsening of symptoms.  Because the intervention sessions address 
sensitive issues for participants and are designed to help youth modify their cognitions, there may be a 
temporary  increase in anxiety or other negative emotions. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_309201]. If significant problems are identified, then the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_309202]. Garber 
or Hollon to determine if further intervention is needed. We will follow  the guidelines defining adverse 
events, serious adverse events, and unanticipated problems set forth by [CONTACT_309214]. 
All serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB according to the procedures  outlined in their 
regulations. We will monitor participants' depressive symptoms at the pre- and post-intervention. We also 
have participants complete the PH Q each week  to check  for individuals whose symptoms may have 
worsened requiring further evaluation and clinical  service. If a participant reveals currently active suicidal 
ideation, attempts, or non-suicidal self -injury during therapy or the clinical evaluation, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_309203]  "critical incident" plan that specifies what should be done if such an event 
occurs. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_309204] (PI s) if 
they have any questions about what to do at any point. All such serious incidents are reported within 48 
hours to the Vanderbilt IRB and DSMB . 
7.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_309205] a participant be taken out of the research study  to ensure his /her safety  and 
well-being. Some  reasons  include:  
•If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_309206] a participant is not receiving  the appropriate treatment
•The participant’s  condition worsens,  reports  serious  suicidality, or is deemed to be a risk to
R61 MH1151256 
him/herself or others. A participant may require more  intensive treatment. In either  case, the 
research  team  will discuss  this with participants and will provide  them with other appropriate clinical  
resources, as needed.  
If a participant  wants  to withdraw  from study  participation , they should  tell the  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], interviewer,  or 
Project Coordinator . Deciding not to be part of the study  will not affect their medical  care in any way.  
8.0 Statistical  Analysis Plan 
We will use the general linear model (i.e., MANCOVA)  to test hypotheses. The between subjects  
factor will be Condition with two levels (CBT+SCT  vs. CBT only ) and the within-subjects factor will be 
Time  with two  levels (baseline, post-test). We will adopt a multivariate approach to repeated measures  
(as assumptions of compound symmetry are untenable). Dependent variables (DVs) will vary across 
analyses; child age and sex , will be covariates in all analyses. 
Specific Aims. To test whether  youth in CBT+SCT have better SC skills  at post-treatment than youth in 
CBT only at post-treatment.    
Hypothesis : We will test the effect of CBT+SCT  on SC skills (target) using the Faux Pau task as the 
DV. We will first test the 2x [ADDRESS_378931].  
Exploratory Hypothes is: To test the effect of CBT+SCT on depressive symptoms, the DV will be the 
clinician -rated depression measure (CDRS). Analyses will be the same as described for  the main  
hypothesis except that we will test the depression measure as the dependent variable. 
Power. To estimate power, we assumed that autocorrelations among the repeated measures were .4 - 
.6. With N=4 2 (21 per cell), alpha = .05, and a medium effect size (e.g., a .[ADDRESS_378932] at T2), 
we will  have approximately .[ADDRESS_378933] the initial 2x 2 Condition x Time interaction (f V = .32). 
Assuming correlations of .3-.6 among the same measure over time, alpha = .05, and medium effect sizes  
we will have .85 power for the 2x 2 Condition by [CONTACT_309215].  
9.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues:  Methods for protecting privacy and confidentiality.  
All research data will be coded with a study ID number rather than names. No identifying information will 
be stored  with research data. A database linking participant contact [CONTACT_309216]-protected and stored on a secure server. Only key study personnel involved in contact[CONTACT_309217]. Questionnaire data will be collected and s tored online.  
We will generate codes to protect participant identities; these codes will be comprised of a 4-digit number. Following the completion of the study, de-identified research data will be maintained indefinitely 
to verify the integrity and validity of results of the study. Documents with identifying information and the 
database linking contact [CONTACT_309218].  
Confidentiality : Participants and parents will be informed during the consent process that confidentiality is 
limited in cases of child abuse/neglect or imminent risk of harm to self or others. In cases of suspected 
child abuse or neglect, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_10718], and we will f ollow the requirements to file a report based on 
the law. If a teen expresses current severe suicidality, the inter viewer or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_309207]/caregiver and then follow the procedures  described in the critical incident protocol.  
All efforts, within reason,  will be made  to keep p articipants’ personal  information in the
 research record 
confidential,  but total confidentiality  cannot be guaranteed. The research files at Vanderbilt  include the 
following identifiers  that are kept separately  from the research data: p articipant’s name, address,  phone  
number, e-mail  address, date of birth,  and a unique study  ID number. 
oResearch records  will be labeled only with the study  ID number and kept separate from any
documents  cont aining identifying  information.
oThe signed consent form will be stored separate from data.
The study has some support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and therefore participants ’ 
study information is protected by a Certificate of Confidentiality. This Certificate allows us, in some 
cases, to refuse to give out participant information even if requested using legal means. It does not 
protect information that we have to report by [CONTACT_2371], such as child abuse or some infectious diseases.  
R61 MH115125 [ADDRESS_378934] or sharing 
research data for this study or future research. Disclosures that participants  make themselves  are also 
not protected. oParticipants’  de-identified, coded
 research information may be put in one or more  databases  and
used for future research. Information stored in these databases  will not include any identifying  
information such  as participants’ name,  address,  telephone number, or date of birth.  Participants’  
research data will only be available  to researchers who have  received approval  from data access  
committees  and/or  Institutional Review Boards. Some  of these databases  are maintained by 
[CONTACT_29392],  some  are maintained by [CONTACT_309219], and some are maintained by [CONTACT_309220].  
oIf any publication or presentation results  from the research, no personally  identifiable information
will be shared.  Participants’ de-identified  research data will be maintained indefinitely  to verify  the 
integrity  of the data and validity  of results.    
Privacy:  All efforts, within reason, will be made to keep participants’  information private. Using or sharing 
(“disclosure”) such data must follow federal privacy rules . By [CONTACT_309221], 
participants  are agreeing (“authorization”) to these  uses and sharing of data . 
Vanderbilt  University  may share the results  of the study to the following groups: the Federal  
Government  Office for Human Research Protections, the Vanderbilt  University  Institutional  Review  
Board, or the study  sponsor  (National  Institute of Health). Federal  privacy  rules  may not apply  to these  
groups; they have  their own rules  and codes  to assure that all efforts,  within reason, will be made to 
keep participants’  research data private.  Participants’ data will be shared with the appropriate 
authority  as required by [CONTACT_309222], or a participant has experienced 
physical  or sexual  abuse  or neglect.  
The study  res
ults will be kept in participants ’ research record  for at least  seven  years  after analyses  of 
the study  data are finished. Unless  told otherwise, participants’  consent  to use or share  de-identified data 
does  not expi[INVESTIGATOR_1312].  If participants  change their mind, they should contact  [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Garber  in writing  and let her 
know  that they withdraw  their consent. Her mailing address  is Department  of Psychology  & Human 
Development, Peabody  College #552, [ADDRESS_378935],  Nashville,  TN [ZIP_CODE]. At that time, we 
will stop getting any more  data from the participants , but the data we stored  before withdrawal of consent  
may still be used for reporting and research quality.

bupi[INVESTIGATOR_283112]:  8 5/11/[ADDRESS_345334] of care for use in interscalene blocks here at the U of MN. Acetaminophen is a medication used to treat pain, gabapentin is a gabapentinoid which is used to treat postoperative pain.   
4.4 Drug/Device Handling: The LB will be stored in a locked pyxis fridge in a 
box labeled study LB.  It will be retrieved by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_9814] I’s for use in the interscalene blocks.  
● The LB will be stored in a locked pyxis fridge in a box labeled 
Liposom al Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  The anesthesiologists in charge of 
regional anesthesia the day the procedure will be informed will write the order for dispensing the medication and the block per standard of care.  It will be retrieved by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_9814] I’s for use in the interscalene blocks.  
4.5 Biosafety: n/a  
4.6 Stem Cells: n/a  
 
5.0 Procedures Involved  
5.1 Study Design: Level I randomized prospective outcomes study 
comparing two groups of patients.  One group will receive LB plus bupi[INVESTIGATOR_283131].  The other will  receive 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_283132].  
Study Procedures: Patients will be identified in the pre -operative time period by [CONTACT_283155].  If that is unable to be accomplished the patient will be introduced to the study and given a copy of the consent form to evaluate prior to surgery.  On the day of surgery, the research coordinator, research assistant or primary or sub investigators will determine if the p atient has any questions so that they can be answered.  After discussion with the 
person obtaining consent, consent will be obtained in the pre-operative area. A random number generator will be used to determine if the patient will have LB plus bupi[INVESTIGATOR_283133].  The primary investigator will access the number generator in the pre-op area immediately prior to block placement.  The website www.random.org  will be used as the random number generator.   
 
Treatment technique:  
All patients will receive preoperative oral multimodal medications consisting of 
acetaminophen [ADDRESS_345335] ASA monitors applied.  Sedation will be provided with midazolam 0-2 mg and propofol 50 mg. The

bupi[INVESTIGATOR_283112]:  8 5/11/2020 
9 interscalene groove will be identified with the ultrasound.  Using sterile technique, a 21g Nerve block needle will then be inserted and advanced under ultrasound guidance until it 
is in the interscalene groove.  Once in the interscalene, 20 mL of local anesthetic will be injected, with 10 mL deposited at the top of the brachial plexus and 10 mL at the bottom.  In the study group, 5 mL of each 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_283134].  The control group with have 20 mL of 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_283135] (10 mL at each site). The patient will be monitored in the p reoperative area 
until he/she is brought into the operating room for their procedure. A working block prior to surgery will be confirmed via sensory testing of the shoulder.  All patients will undergo a standard induction with propofol 1.5-3.0 mg/kg, ondansetron 4 mg, dexamethasone 10 mg and ketamine 0.25 mg/kg.  A MAC or general with LMA or ETT will be placed and an opi[INVESTIGATOR_283136]. Standardized maintenance will be a propofol infusion without neuromuscular blockers.   25-50 mcg of IV Fentanyl will be utilized for increases in heart rate greater than 20% or increases in systolic blood pressure above baseline.    Once in the operating room the surgeon will use an additional 10 mL of 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_283137], subcutaneous, and intraarticular injection.   When the operation is complete, the patient will be woken up and brought to the PACU.  There the patient will receive IV fentanyl for a pain score of greater than 7 (50 mcg of Fentanyl x 2 if needed).  If more than 100 mcg of fentanyl is given and pain still remains above a 7 then IV hydromorphone will be used (max dose of 1 mg and given in increments of 0.3 mg q 10 minutes prn severe pain). Once the patient is able to tolerate oral medications a dose of 5 mg of oral oxycodone (or 2 mg of oral hydromorphone if allergic to oxycodone) will be given i f their pain score is greater than 4 (on the Visual 
Analog Scale).  Once the patient meets discharge criteria, they will be discharged home 
where each day they will fill out a pain diary.  Additionally, a member of the research team will call the patient for signs of complications and ask the patient their current pain score, total opi[INVESTIGATOR_283138]-opi[INVESTIGATOR_283139] 24, 48, and [ADDRESS_345336] in the PACU to assess diaphragm function. All patients will be discharged with instructions to take acetaminophen 975 mg q8 hours & ibuprofen [ADDRESS_345337] a prescription for oxycodone 5 mg, 30-40 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], dosing 1-2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] q 4 hours prn severe pain.     Enrollment procedures : Patients will be ide ntified in the pre-operative time period by 
[CONTACT_283156].  If that is unable to be accomplished the patient will be introduced to the study 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Prospective Randomized controlled study comparing lipos omal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_283112]:  8 5/11/[ADDRESS_345338] (HIPAA) forms.  The patient will review the forms with the surgeon, r esearch staff, or anesthesiologist.  Subjects will be reminded that 
participation is completely voluntary, and that they may stop participation at any time without question or penalty.  The surgeon, research staff, or anesthesiologist will answer any quest ions that the subjects may have about the study.  If the patient decides to 
participate, they will be asked to sign the consent and HIPAA forms.  One copy will be saved for study records, and the subject will be provided with a copy of the forms for their own records.  The patient will then have an opportunity to ask any questions of the surgeon regarding the treatment option that has been selected. All forms will be locked and stored in a file cabinet in the research department.  Enrollment will proceed fr om July 
2018 to July 2019.  Enrolling consecutive patients will help reduce selection bias.  
 
Assessments:  Post-operatively patients will be evaluated at [ADDRESS_345339]-
operatively by a blinded research staff.  This person will not be aware of the pati ent’s 
mode of analgesia. The patients will be contact[CONTACT_283157] 24, 48, and 72 hours +/- [ADDRESS_345340]-injection if they would undergo interscalene block with their medication again or if they would opt for a different form of pain management. Patients will fill out a Quality of Recovery Survey at 72 hours and 14 days, and be assessed for block related complications at this time.  All complications will be recorded including:  
● Failure of the block  
● Wound infections 
● Subsequent procedures 
● Complications related to placement of the interscalene block including nerve injury, prolonged sensory loss greater than 3 days, prolonged arm weakness greater than 3 days 
● Opi[INVESTIGATOR_283140]/or vomiting 
● Local anesthetic toxicity as evidenced by [CONTACT_283158] (any 
health care professional) regarding their pain over night and that will be documented.   
 All data will be recorded on the Clinical Diagnostic Sheet and will then be given to the research coordinator for manual data entry.  Data collection will continue until POD #14.  At that time study participation will be terminated.  Should patients be re- admitted to the

bupi[INVESTIGATOR_283112]:  8 5/11/2020 
11 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_283141] (Up to POD #30) for pain, a notation will be made in study records.  An analysis of the total cost of analgesics will be tabulated at the conclusion of the study to determ ine the most cost effective treatment option as this will be added into the cost of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_283142].    Blinding Procedure:  The research assistant in this study will be blinded to the method of analgesia for the patient.   The research assistant will assess pain one time per day.  
This person will not be responsible for any clinical testing and will record all data in the protected database daily.  They will not have any access to the patients’  clinical records 
or chart.   Any questions from the patient will be referred to the on -call resident or 
staff on call.   
 
5.2  
Describe:  
● The interscalene block is standard of care for patients and would be 
performed regardless of patient’s participation in the study.  All patients still would get preoperative multimodal treatment as well as an opi[INVESTIGATOR_283143].   
● Patients would be required to take a dose of acetaminophen 975 mg oral and gabapentin 300 mg oral prior to surgery.  They would then be required to receive an interscalene block with either liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_283144].  Intraoperatively they would be required to receive propofol, lidocaine, ondansetron, dexamethasone, and ketamine for induction of anesthesia.

11.2 I
dentification of Potential Particip ants:  Patients will be identified by 
[CONTACT_283159]’s clinic, pre -assessment 
clinic, or preoperative area. Patients who have opted out of research will not be 
asked to participate in the study. Patients will be approached to consent for the study by a surgeon, anesthesiologist, or member of the research team. Patients who agree to participate in the study will sign both a study consent and HIPAA authorization allowing the use of specified information contained in medical records for research purposes. 
11.3 Recruitment Materials: N/A  
11.4 Payment: No payment will be provided to patients.   
12.0 Withdrawal of Participants  
12.1 Withdrawal Circumstances:.  Subjects who have consented prior to the 
day of surgery and for some reason choose not to participate will be withdrawn 
and a notation will be made in the study records and these people will be considered screen failures.  The surgeon may choose to withdraw the patient from the study prior to surgery for  any medical reason or if they suffer a major life threatening  adverse event.  
12.2 Withdrawal Procedures:  I
 f the patient is withdrawn from study prior to the 
procedure, they will be noted in study records as screen failures. If they undergo 
the procedure and they decide they no longer want to be a part of the study or withdrawn by [CONTACT_099], they will be withdrawn and no further data will be collected.  This will also be noted in the study documentation. 
12.3 Termination Procedures:  If the study is terminated for any reason, or there 
is more than 5 % major adverse events the data that is already collected will be 
stored in a secure location only accessible to research personnel on this study. No further data will be collected if the study is terminated.  
13.0 Risks to Participants  
13.1 Foreseeable Risks:  The st udy has the following risks:  
·      infection  
·      bleeding 
·      nerve injury

1.1 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
1.[ADDRESS_1207996] -of-care  is to suspend  cytotoxic  therapy,  treat  with  brain  radiotherapy  (either  whole  brain  or 
stereotactic),  and subsequently  treat  with  additional  cytotoxic  chemotherapy.  Based  on the premise  that 
radiation  therapy  induces  tumor  antigen  release,  concurrent  treatment  with  tremelimumab —a 
therapeutic  immune  checkpoint  antibody —may  induce  anti-tumor  immunity  and systemic  disease  control.  
Thus,  the overarching  goal of this study  is to utilize  brain  irradiation  as a “window  of opportunity”  to 
provide  effective  immunotherapy,  which  may provide  a period  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_865906] a patient  
population  forwhom  few or no alternative  effective  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_865907].  
1.3 Protocol  Summary  
 
A single  institution  pi[INVESTIGATOR_865908]  (treme)  plus brain  irradiation  
+/- HER2  directed  therapy  in breast  cancer  patients  with  brain  metastasis  (BCBM)  for whom  post -brain  
irradiation  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  was planned.  Subjects  received  either  whole  brain  radiation  treatment  
(WBRT)  or stereotactic  radiosurgery  (SRS),  as per standard  of care,  with  tremelimumab  administered  at 
10mg/kg  every  [ADDRESS_1207997]  cancer  subtypes  were  eligible  for enrollment:  subjects  not requiring  
concurrent  HER2  directed  therapy  such  as trastuzumab  (tras),  were  enrolled  in a Simon  2-stage  efficacy  
arm,  whereas  subjects  with  HER2 -positive  (i.e. HER2  overexpressing  and/or  amplified)  disease  requiring  
continuation  of HER2  directed  therapy  were  enrolled  in a HER2  directed  therapy  safety  arm designed  to 
evaluate  the safety  of HER2  directed  therapy  and tremelimumab/RT  co-administration.  As of 3/1/2017,  
the 12 week  disease  control  rate was 2/10  (10%)  in the efficacy  arm and 2/6 (33%)  in the safety  arm.  One 
patient  treated  with  concurrent  HER2 -directed  therapy  had a 57% partial  response  by [CONTACT_393]  v1.[ADDRESS_1207998]  comment  treatment  related  AEs were  diarrhea  (12.9%),  
fatigue  (9.7%),  and colitis  (6.5%).  Thus,  an expansion  of the HER2  arm is planned  in a parallel  Simon  two- 
stage  design  to evaluate  efficacy  of brain  RT with  checkpoint  blockade  and concurrent  HER2 -directed  
therapy.  However,  because  of the diarrhea and colitis  associated  with  tremelimumab  mediated  CTLA4  
blockade  when  administered  at 10mg/kg  monthly  (a well described  class  effect),  a lower  dose  of 
tremelimumab  will be co-administered  with  trastuzumab  in the expansion  study  in combination  with  
durvalumab,  a PD-L1 directed  antibody  that is currently  US FDA approved  for other  indications.  
1.2.1  Protocol  Expansion  Summary  
 
Given  the safety  and response  demonstrated  in the safety  arm of patients  treated  with  brain  RT, 
checkpoint  and HER2 -directed  therapy,  this arm will be expanded  to evaluate  efficacy  in a Simon  two- 
stage  design.  In this expansion,  we will evaluate  the combination  of tremelimumab  (treme),  durvalumab  
(durva),  and HER2 directed  therapy  plus brain  irradiation  in breast  cancer  patients  with  brain  metastases  
(BCBM)  for whom  post -brain  irradiation  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  is planned.  Subjects  will receive  either  
whole  brain  radiation  treatment  (WBRT)  or stereotactic  radiosurgery  (SRS),  as per standard  of care,  with  
tremelimumab  administered  at 75 mg and durvalumab  administered  at 1500mg  every  28 days  for 4 cycles.

After the  4th  cycle,  patients  will continue  to receive  1500mg  durvalumab  every  28 days.  Patients  will 
continue  to receive  HER2  directed  therapy  at a NCCN -guideline -endorsed  dose  and schedule,  as 
determined  by [CONTACT_209859].  The same  study  design  parameters  will be applied  to the 
expansion  (Fig 1.2-2) as were  previously  applied  to the completed  efficacy  cohort  not requiring  concurrent  
HER2  directed  therapy  (Fig 1.2-1).

1.4 Efficacy  Arm (Completed  as of 3/1/2017)  
 
The primary  objective  of the trial will be to evaluate  non-CNS disease  control  of tremelimumab  plus brain  
irradiation  at 12 weeks,  defined  as either  complete  response  (CR),  partial  response  (PR),  or stable  disease  
(SD) by [CONTACT_393]1.[ADDRESS_1208000] 3 patients  in the efficacy  arm complete  the 6 week  enrollment  hold,  safety  will be assessed  
on a continuous  basis,  and enrollment  will be suspended  if toxicities  exceed  the pre-defined  safety  
threshold.  
 
1.5 HER2  directed  therapy  Co-administration  Arm (Completed  as of 3.1.2017)  
 
Women  with  HER2 -overexpressing  breast  cancer  for whom  continuation  of HER2  directed  therapy  is 
indicated  will be eligible  to enroll  in an arm that will enroll  concurrently  with  the efficacy  arm,  but will 
evaluate  the safety  of HER2  directed  therapy  and tremelimumab  co-administration.  
 
Subjects  in the co-administration  arm will receive  RT and tremelimumab  at the same  schedule  and dose  as 
the efficacy  arm,  but will continue  to receive  HER2  directed  therapy  at a NCCN -guideline -endorsed  dose  
and schedule,  as determined  by [CONTACT_093].  For heightened  safety  monitoring,  a safety  run-in will be 
performed,  whereby  [CONTACT_865974] [ADDRESS_1208001].   Accrual  will follow  a modified  3+3 design,  to minimize  drug  exposure  if the treatment  
is not tolerable.  
1.6 Protocol  Expansion  (Planned  as of 3.1.2017)  
 
Subjects  in the study  expansion  will be enrolled  in a Simon  two-stage  arm,  designed  to evaluate  the safety  
and efficacy  of tremelimumab,  durvalumab,  HER2 directed  therapy,  and RT co-administration.  A maximum  
of [ADDRESS_1208002] three  patients  in this stage  complete  the 6 
week  enrollment  hold,  safety  will be assessed  on a continuous  basis,  and enrollment  will be suspended  if 
toxicities  exceed  the pre-defined  safety  threshold.  
1.7 Drug  administration  and  Radiation  Initiation  
 
1.6.1  Efficacy  and HER2 -directed  Safety  Arms  (Completed  as of 3.1.2017)  
 
In both  the efficacy  arm and HER2  directed  arms,  tremelimumab  was administered  intravenously  at 
10mg/kg  2 days  prior to  the initiation  of radiotherapy.  In cases  where  this was not feasible,  tremelimumab  
was administered  at any time  during  a period  of 5 days  preceding  the initiation  of radiotherapy,  to 3 days  
following  initiation  of radiotherapy.  Subsequent  doses  of tremelimumab  were  administered  every  28 days

+/- 1 week  until  progression  or intolerable  toxicity.  The dosing  schedule  was based  on a patient’s  first 
dose  of tremelimumab.  
1.6.1  HER2  Expansion  (Planned  as of 3.1.2017)  
 
In the protocol  expansion,  tremelimumab  will be administered  at 75 mg and durvalumab  will be 
administered  at 1500  mg 2 days  prior  to the initiation  of radiotherapy.  In cases  where  this is not feasible,  
tremelimumab  and durvalumab  may be administered  at any time  during  a period  of 5 days  proceeding  
initiation  of radiotherapy  to 3 days  following  initiation  of radiotherapy.  Subsequent  doses   of 
tremelimumab  and durvalumab  will be administered  every  28 days  +/- 1 week  for 4 cycles.  After  the 4th 
cycle,  durvalumab  1500  mg will be administered  until  disease  progression  or intolerable   toxicity.   The 
dosing  schedule  will be based  on the patient’s  first dose  of tremelimumab  and durvalumab.  Patients  will 
receive  HER2  directed  therapy  at the NCCN -guideline -endorsed  dose  and schedule,  as determined  by [CONTACT_1275].  
 
 
 
 
During  tremelimumab  +/- durvalumab  administration,  systemic  therapy   beyond   HER2 -directed  therapy  
will be suspended  until  confirmed  radiographic  progression  or clinical  deterioration,  at which  ti me 
tremelimumab  +/- durvalumab  will be discontinued  and systemic  therapy  may  be initiated.  Subjects  who  
initiate  non-study  cancer -directed  systemic  therapy  before  the imaging  assessment  will be considered  
treatment  failures  when  determining  the primary  endpoint.  
 
Concurrent  administration  of bone  modifying  agents  (i.e. Denosumab  or zoledronic  acid)  is permitted  on 
study.  
Week  [ADDRESS_1208003] treatment.  Response  assessment  will occur  12 weeks  thereafter  (i.e. at week  
13 +/- 1 week),  with  a confirmatory  scan  at 16 weeks  (i.e. week  17 +/- 1 week  ) in patients  with  evidence  
of radiographic  progression  at week  13 (Table  10.0 -1). Responses  will be determined  by [CONTACT_38183] -of-care 
whole  body  imaging  contrast -enhanced  CT chest  abdomen  pelvis.  For patients  with  bone  metastases  or 
with  an appropriate  clinical  indication,  concurrent  bone  scan or PET scan  is recommended.  Other  imaging  
modalities  will be performed  as clinically  indicated  at the discretion  of the investigator.  
 
When  feasible,  subjects  with  symptomatic  brain  metastases  will be managed  conservatively  without  the 
use of steroids.  Subjects  requiring  steroids  for symptom  management  will be eligible  for enrollment  as 
outlined  in section  9. CNS and systemic  response  assessments  will be evaluated  every  12 weeks  starting  at 
week  13 (i.e. 12 weeks  after  treatment  in week  1). Research  bloods  will be obtained  for immune  
monitoring.

3.[ADDRESS_1208004]  cancer  is a global  public  health  burden  with  more  than  200,000  new  cases  diagnosed  each  year  in 
the United  States  and more  than  one million  new  cases  diagnosed  worldwide  each  year  (Society  2012).  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_865909],  about  one-third  of women  diagnosed  with  early  stage  disease  
develop  lethal  distant  metastases.  Furthermore,  brain   metastases   are a relatively  common   and 
devastating  complication  of breast  cancer.  Hence,  more  effective  approaches  are needed.  The uniqueness  
of tumors  and hosts  provides  an opportunity  for individualized  treatment.  Because  the synergistic  effect  
of radiotherapy  (RT) and immunotherapy  has been  demonstrated  in multiple  preclinical  studies  and 
because  RT combined  with  immunotherapy  may  confer  an abscopal  effect  with  regression  of distant  
metastases,  our proposed  strategy  uses  immune  stimulation  to augment  the therapeutic  impact  of whole  
brain  radiation  therapy  (WBRT)  or stereotactic  radiosurgery  (SRS)  on clinical  outcomes  for women  with  
breast  cancer  brain  metastases  (BCBM).  Thus,  the central  goal for this project  is to make  a major  advance  
for women  with  BCBM  by [CONTACT_865976]’s  immune  response  to their  existing  tumor.  
 
Brain  metastasis  is a relatively  common  and devastating  complication  of breast  cancer.  In fact,  breast  
cancer  is the second  most  common  cancer  associated  with  brain  metastasis  in the United  States  
(Barnholtz -Sloan,  Sloan  et al. 2004).  Both  the incidence  and prevalence  of BCBM  are rising  (Frisk,  Svensson

et al. 2012).  Although  brain  metastases  are diagnosed  in approximately  15% of breast  cancer  patients,  
autopsy  data  suggest  a prevalence  of up to 30% -40%  (Tsukada,  Fouad  et al. 1983).  Brain  metastasis  
secondary  to breast  cancer  is an independent  poor  prognostic  factor,  with  variable  outcomes  depending  
on histologic  subtype.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1208005]  Cancer  Brain  Metastases  at MSKCC  
 
Because  published  outcomes  data  for women  with  BCBM  treated  in the modern  treatment  era are 
limited,  we performed  a retrospective  study  of our recent  experience  with  this disease  at Memorial  Sloan - 
Kettering  Cancer  Center  (MSKCC)  (Morikawa,  Diab  et al. 2013).  For women  with  newly  diagnosed  BCBM  
and treated  with  brain  RT at MSKCC  between  January  2009  and December  2011,  the median  time  from  
brain  metastases  to death  for all patients  was 15.3  months  (10.9 -18.2mo,  95% CI). The distribution  by 
[CONTACT_865977]:  28/113  (25%)  HER2 -positive  (HER2+);  59/113  (52%)  hormone  receptor -positive,  
HER2 -negative  (HR+HER2 -); and 26/113  (23%)  hormone  receptor -negative,  HER2 -negative,  or “triple  
negative”  (HR-HER2 -). The majority  (70%)  were  treated  with  WBRT.  By [CONTACT_130334],  the median  time  from  
brain  metastases  to death  was 32.8 months  for women  with  HER2+  disease;  12.7 months  for women  with  
HR+HER2 - disease;  and 11.3 months  for women  with  HR-HER2 - disease  (p=0.001).  The median  time  to 
death  was 12.0  months  for women  treated  with  WBRT,  and 23.0  months  for women  treated  with  SRS. 
These  outcomes  represent  significant  improvements  when  compared  with  published  historical  data,  
thereby  [CONTACT_865978]/or  local  therapeutic  strategies  have  translated  into 
improved  survival  for women  with  BCBM.  However,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_865910],  the prognosis  for these  
women  remains  poor  and further  inroads  are desperately  needed.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1208006]  in part because  of the blood -brain  barrier.  For example,  the successful  development  of 
trastuzumab  in HER2+  breast  cancer  translated  into an approximately  50% reduction  in the risk of distant  
metastases  when  administered  in the adjuvant  setting  (Slamon,  Eiermann  et al. 2011).   However,   in 
women  with  HER2+  metastatic  breast  cancer  (MBC)  treated  with  chemotherapy  and trastuzumab,  
approximately  30% develop  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  metastases  (Gori,  Rimondini  et al. 2007).  It was 
hoped  that the small  size of lapatinib,  a tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  of EGFR  and HER2,  would  permit  CNS 
penetration  and therefore,  provide  effective  systemic  treatment  of brain  metastases.  However,  studies  of 
single  agent  lapatinib  and lapatinib  in combination  with  chemotherapy  did not confer  significant  benefits  
(Lin,  Carey  et al. 2008).  Response  rates  to systemic  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_865911].  Consequently  radiotherapy  remains  the cornerstone  for  the treatment  of BCBM,  
palliating  neurologic  symptoms  and potentially  prolonging  survival  (Wong,  Hird  et al. 2009).  
3.[ADDRESS_1208007] Cancer  Brain  Metastases  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_865912],  CNS failure  is common  (Ogura,  Mitsumori  
et al. 2003).  Therefore,  local  control  in the brain  could  potentially  be improved  by [CONTACT_865979]  a systemic  strategy  that augments  and prolongs  the host  immune  response  to radiotherapy- 
generated  tumor -specific  antigens.  One such  systemic  strategy  is the use of a therapeutic  immunologic

checkpoint  blockade  antibody  such  as ipi[INVESTIGATOR_865913].  In melanoma  patients  with  brain  
metastases,  the anti-cytotoxic  T-lymphocyte  antigen  4 (CTLA -4) antibody,  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],  generated  14% 
disease  control  as monotherapy.  (Margolin,  Ernstoff  et al. 2012)  
 
Immunotherapy  for the treatment  of metastatic  breast   cancer  has long   been  a goal of scientists  and 
clinicians.  However,  numerous  challenges  to successful  implementation  have  included  limited  numbers  of 
viable  targets  as a consequence  of tumor  heterogeneity,  limited  efficacy  of available  agents,  and the lack 
of sustained  anti-tumor  effects  even  in the face of increased  immune  responses.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_865914],  
a recent  and growing  literature  indicates  that immune  therapy  for the treatment  of breast  cancer  is a 
viable  strategy.  Studies  have  demonstrated  the prognostic  and predictive  impact  of tumor  tissue  
infiltration  by T effector (Teff)  and T regulatory  (Treg)  cells  in curable  breast  cancer  (Bates,  Fox et al. 2006,  
Ladoire,  Mignot  et al. 2011,  Mahmoud,  Paish  et al. 2011 ). Furthermore,  in the retrospective  MSKCC  study  
of outcomes  after  BCBM  diagnosis  in the modern  treatment  era, an absolute  lymphocyte  count  ≥0.7/ul  
was associated  with  improved  survival  (Morikawa,  Diab  et al. 2013).  Together,  these   data  suggest  that 
there  is a critical  relationship  between  the immune  system  and breast  cancers,  thereby  [CONTACT_865980] -specific  immunotherapy  in this setting.  
 
 
3.5 Anti -CTLA -4 therapy  
 
CTLA -4 is a homolog  of the co-activation  receptor  CD28  that,  when  bound  to B7 ligands  (CD80  and CD86),  
inhibits  T-cell function  by [CONTACT_865981]  (Krummel  and Allison  1995).  CTLA -4 
induces  inhibitory  downstream  T-cell receptor  signaling,  but also leads  to up-regulation  of CTLA -4 
expression  and competitive  inhibition  of CD28 -mediated  co-activation.  CTLA -4 is also highly  expressed  on 
CD25+FOXP3+ T-regulatory  (Treg) cells  and is instrumental  in Treg function.  CTLA -4 blockade  been  shown  to 
promote  T-cell activation,  as well as depletion  of intratumoral  Tregs (Quezada  and Peggs  2013)  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  
(IgG1)  and tremelimumab  (IgG2)  are the two human  anti-CTLA -[ADDRESS_1208008]  CTLA -4 enhance  T cell function,  measured  by [CONTACT_865982]-2, IFN-γ, and other  cytokines.  In CTLA -4 knock -out mice,  extensive,  polyclonal  lymphoproliferation

develops  that is consistent  with  dysregulated  activation  of lymphocytes.  Treatment  of tumor -bearing  mice  
with  anti-mouse  CTLA -4 mAb  (9H10)  can induce  antitumor  immunity  and markedly  enhance  T cell- 
mediated  killing  of various  mouse  solid  tumors.  At a concentration  of approximately  30 μg/mL  9H10,  anti- 
tumor  activity  of 9H10  was observed  in vivo.  Thus,  a concentration  of ~ 30 μg/mL  was iden tified  as the 
target  plasma  concentration.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics  (PK) of tremelimumab  were  evaluated  in cynomolgus   monkeys   following   single  
(0.75,  10, 30, and 100 mg/kg)  and multiple  (5 to 50 mg/kg  weekly)  intravenous  (IV) administrations.  The 
PK of tremelimumab  is characterized  by a low plasma  clearance  (CL =  4.32 mL/day/kg),  small  volume  of 
distribution  at steady -state  (Vss = 53.8  mL/kg),  and long  half-life (t½ = 9.1 days).  In toxicologic  studies  in 
cynomolgus  monkeys,  systemic  exposures  of tremelimumab,  assessed  by [CONTACT_865983]  (Cmax) and mean  area  under  the concentration -time  curve  (AUC),  increased  dose -
proportionally  within  the dose  ranges  examined  following  single  or multiple  IV administrations.  No 
evidence  of nonlinear  PK or gender -related  differences  in exposures  was observed.  Anti-drug  antibody  
(ADA)  responses  were  detected  in some  animals  from  all dose  groups  following  single  or multiple  IV 
administrations  of tremelimumab.  Finally,  PK and ADA  responses  of clonally- and nonclonally -derived  
tremelimumab  were  comparable.  
 
Population  PK analysis  of tremelimumab  was performed  on combined  data  from  Phase  1, Phase  2, and 
Phase  3 studies  (N = 654)  in subjects  with  metastatic  melanoma  using  nonlinear  mixed -effects  modeling  in 
NONMEM  software.  A 2-compartment  population  PK model  adequately  described  the plasma  
concentrations  of tremelimumab  following  various  dosing  regimens.  The population  estimate  for CL and 
central  volume  of distribution  (V1) was 0.26  L/day  and 3.[ADDRESS_1208009]  (31.8%  and 20.4%,  respectively).  Clearance  was faster  in males,  subjects  with  
higher  values  of creatinine  clearance  and endogenous  Ig, and subjects   with  relatively  poor  baseline  
prognostic  factors.  Central  volume  of distribution  was higher  in males  and subjects  with  highe r body  
weight.  No dose  adjustment  was needed  based  on the magnitude of the change  inL(<  30%;  Wang  et al, 
 
201 4). Preliminary  population  PK of tremelimumab  was performed  using  data  from  two second -line, 
single -arm investigator -initiated  Phase  2 studies  (NCT01  649024  /N CT0 1655888)  in subjects  with  malignant  
mesothelioma.  A total  of 40 subjects  provided  evaluable  PK data  following  15 mg/kg  Q90D  [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]  
or 10 mg/kg  Q4W  for 6 months  followed  by 10 mg/kg  Q12W  [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]  dosing  regimens.  
Tremelimumab  PK exposure  in mesothelioma  subjects  was similar  to previous  melanoma  studies  following  
15 mg/kg  Q90D.  Following  the 15 mg/kg  Q90D,  PK exposure  was below  the target  trough  level  of 
approximately  30 µg/mL  for about  half of the dosing  interval  with  almost  all subjects  below  the lowerlimit 
of quantitation  at the end of the 90-day dosing  interval.  Following  more  frequent  dosing  of 10 mg/kg  
Q4W,  PK exposure  was increased  and maintained  at or above  the target  level  in the majority  of subjects  
over  the entire  dosing  interval.  Tremelimumab  PK was best  described  using  a 2-compartment  linear  model  
with  first order  elimination.  Following  IV dosing,  the typi[INVESTIGATOR_865915] V1 were  0.2 L/day  and 3.[ADDRESS_1208010]  variability  for CL and V1 were  22% and 7%, respectively.  The estimated

covariates  for CL, whereas  only  baseline  body  weight  was significant  covariate  for volume  of distribution.  
These  correlations  will be further  validated  using  data  from  larger  clinical  studies.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  To xico logy  
The toxicology  program  conducted  for tremelimumab  consisted  of in vivo general  toxicology  studies  in 
cynomolgus  monkeys  for up to [ADDRESS_1208011],  skin,  lymphoid  organs,  thyroid  
tissues,  and hematological  systems.  Dose -limiting  toxicities  (DLTs)  were  identified  in chronic   toxicity  
studies  in monkeys  and include  persistent  diarrhea  microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_865917],  colon,  and/or  duodenum,  weight  loss,  and development  of adverse  skin 
conditions  (scabbed  areas;  open  sores;  swollen  eyelids;  dry, scaly,  or crusted  skin;  rash or reddened  skin;  
yellowish  skin)  accompanied  histologically  with  mononuclear  cell inflammation.  Most  toxicities  were  
reversible  or showed  a trend  towards  reversibility.  
 
An embryo -fetal  development  study  was conducted  in pregnant  cynomolgus  monkeys  during  the period  of 
organogenesis.  Tremelimumab  was administered  IV once  weekly  from  Day 20 to 50 of gestation  at doses  
of 0 (control),  5, 15, or 30 mg/kg.  Tremelimumab  did not elicit  maternal  toxicity,  developmental  toxicity,  
or teratogenicity.  
 
3.6.3 Summary  of Clinical  Experience:  Monotherapy  
As of November  12, 2014  (for all studies  except  D4190C00006  that has a cutoff  date  of December  4, 2014),  
[ADDRESS_1208012]  received  tremelimumab  or placebo  in the ongoing   double - 
blinded,  Phase  2b mesothelioma  study,  D4880C00003  (DETERMINE;  data  remain  blinded).  Tremelimumab  
in combination  with  other  anticancer  agents  has been  administered  to 208 subjects  with  a variety  of tumor  
types  in 12 of the 22 clinical  studies,  7 of which  are ongoing.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy  
 
Across  the clinical  development  program  for tremelimumab,  a pattern  of efficacy  has emerged,  also 
observed  for the related  anti-CTLA -4 antibody,  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],  which  appears  to be consistent  across  tumor  
types  for this mechanism  of action.  Response  rates  to anti-CTLA-4 antibodies  are generally  low,  
approximately  10%.  However,  in patients  who  respond,  the responses  are generally   durable,   lasting  
several  months  even  in those  with  aggressive  tumors  such  as refractory  metastatic  melanoma.  Moreover,  
survival  benefit  was reported  even  in subjects  without  radiographic  regression  in tumor  burden.  In a 
single -arm Phase  2 study  (Study  A3671008)  of tremelimumab  administered  at 15 mg/kg  Q90D  to subjects  
with  refractory  melanoma,  a response  rate of 7% and median  OS of 10 months  in the second -line setting

(as compared  to approximately  6 months  with  BSC reported  from  a retrospective  analysis;  (Korn,  Liu et 
al. 2008)  was observed  (Kirkwood,  Lorigan  et al. 2010).  In a randomized,  open -label,  first-line Phase  3 
study  of tremelimumab  (administered  at 15 mg/kg  Q90D)  versus  chemotherapy  (DTIC  or temozolomide)  
in advanced  melanoma  (Study  A3671009),  results  of the final  analysis  showed  a response  rate of 11% and 
median  OS of 12.[ADDRESS_1208013]-line setting  (as compared  to 10.[ADDRESS_1208014]  
chemotherapy)(Ribas,  Kefford  et al. 2013).  Additionally,  in a Phase  2 maintenance  study  in NSCLC,  PFS at 
3 months  was 22.7%  in the tremelimumab  arm compared  with  11.9%  in the BSC arm (Study  A3671015).  
 
Survival  analysis  of 293 subjects  treated  with  tremelimumab  in a Phase  3 study  in melanoma  showed  
better  OS in subjects  with  higher  exposure.  The median  OS was 18.4  months  for the high  AUC  (≥ 123,665  
μg·hour/mL)  group  compared  to 9.0 months  for the low AUC  (< 123,665  μg·hour/mL)  group  (HR 0.5; p < 
0.001)  as shown  in Figure  [IP_ADDRESS].  Higher  rates  of 1-year  survival  (67%  vs 56%)  and 2-year  survival  (16%  vs 
5%) were  observed  in the high  versus  low AUC  groups,  respectively.  It is possible  that the lower  OS in the 
low AUC90  group  is due to less favorable  prognostic  features  in that group.  Subjects  who  had an AUC90  
below  the median  were  more  likely  to have  baseline  characteristics  that predict  poor  prognosis,  including  
M1c (67%  vs 47%),  LDH > ULN (30%  vs 17%),  ECOG  performance  status  > 0 (42%  vs 21%),  and CRP > 1.5 × 
ULN (40%  vs 18%).  However,  subjects  who  were  able to achieve  a higher  AUC  despi[INVESTIGATOR_865918] a better  survival  outcome  than  those  who  did not, suggesting  that 
maximizing  exposure  could  improve  the survival  outcome  with  tremelimumab.  
 
Preliminary  data  are available  for the ongoing  study,  D4190C00006,  which  is evaluating  MEDI4736  in 
combination  with  tremelimumab.  As of the data  cutoff  date  of 04Dec2014,  a total  of [ADDRESS_1208015]  8 weeks  of follow -up. Of these,  8 subjects  had PR, 11 subjects  
had stable disease,  and 12 subjects  had PD.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety  
 
 
The profile  of adverse  events  (AEs)  and the spectrum  of event  severity  have  remained  stable  across  the 
tremelimumab  clinical  program  and are consistent  with  the pharmacology  of the target.  Based  on 
integrated  data  from  the completed  and rollover  tremelimumab  monotherapy  studies  (N = 973),  AEs (all 
grades,  regardless  of severity)  reported  in > 10% of subjects  were  diarrhea  (45.3%),  fatigue  (37.5%),  
nausea  (32.5%),   rash  (28.8%),  pruritus   (27.3%),   decreased   appetite  (22.8%),  vomiting  (22.5%),   pyrexia  
(15.3%),  cough  (15.0%),  constipation  (14.4%),  abdominal  pain  (13.9%),  headache  (13.8%),  dyspnea  
(12.4%),  and decreased  weight  (10.2%;  see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for details).  Integrated  data  from  completed  
studies  of tremelimumab  in combination  with  other  agents  (N = 116) showed  that AEs (all grades,  
regardless  of causality)  reported  in > 15% of subjects  (all grades,  regardless  of causality)  included  diarrhea  
(54.3%);   nausea  (40.5%);   fatigue   (38.8%);   rash  (35.3%);   pruritus,   decreased   appetite   (30.2%   each);  
vomiting  (27.6%);  pyrexia  (26.7%);  influenza  like illness  (20.7%);  arthralgia  (19.8%);  constipation  (19.0%);  
thrombocytopenia,  injection  site reaction  (18.1%  each);  and increased  aspartate  aminotransferase  
(15.5%).  Most  of these  events  occurred  at a higher  rate with  tremelimumab  plus sunitinib  than  with  other  
combinations.  
 
Events  reported  in > 5% of subjects  treated  with  tremelimumab  monotherapy  and assessed  by [CONTACT_865985]  (listed  in descending  order  of frequency)  were  diarrhea,  rash,  pruritus,  
fatigue,  nausea,  vomiting,  decreased  appetite,  headache,  abdominal  pain,  and colitis.

In an integrated  analysis  of tremelimumab  monotherapy  studies,  944 of the 973 subjects  (97.0%)  treated  
with  tremelimumab  monotherapy  experienced  at least  1 AE (Table  [IP_ADDRESS]).  The events  resulted  in 
discontinuation  of tremelimumab  in 10.0%  of subjects,  were  serious  in 36.5%,  were  ≥ Grade  3 in severity  
in 49.7%,  were  fatal  in 67.7%,  and were  considered  to be treatment  related  in 79.1%  of subjects.  
 
The frequency  of any AEs and ≥ Grade  3 AEs was gene rally  similar  across  the tremelimumab  dose  groups.  
However,  a higher  percentage  of subjects  in the 10 mg/kg  Q28D  and 15 mg/kg  Q90D  groups  compared  
with  the All Doses  < 10 mg/kg  group  experienced  treatment -related  AEs,  SAEs,  AEs resulting  in 
discontinuation  of investigational  product,  and deaths.  
 
A total  of 944 subjects  (97.0%)  experienced  at least  1 event  for a total  of 10,341  events.  Adverse  events  
(all grades)  reported  in > 10% of subjects  (in decreasing  order  of frequency)  were  diarrhea,   fatigue,  
nausea,  rash,  pruritus,  decreased  appetite,  vomiting,  pyrexia,  cough,  constipation,  abdominal  pain,  
headache,  dyspnea,  and decreased  weight.  The frequencies  of these  AEs were  higher  in the 10 and 15 
mg/kg  dose  groups  than  the All Doses  < 10 mg/kg  group.  Notably,  for all of these  frequent  AEs (all grades),  
except for diarrhea,  abdominal  pain,  headache,  and dyspnea,  the incidence  was higher  in the 10 mg/kg  
group  than  the 15 mg/kg  group.  
 
Approximately  half of the subjects  experienced  AEs of ≥ Grade  [ADDRESS_1208016]  frequent  ≥ Grade  3 
AEs reported  in ≥ 2% of subjects  (in decreasing  order  of frequency)  were  diarrhea,  fatigue,  colitis,  disease  
progression,  dyspnea,  dehydration/nausea/vomiting,  abdominal  pain,  decreased  appetite,  and asthenia.  
The events  of diarrhea,  abdominal  pain,  and colitis  occurred  at a higher  rate in the 10 mg/kg  group,  
whereas  fatigue,  disease  progression,  dehydration,  nausea,  vomiting,  decreased  appetite,  and asthenia  
were  reported  more  frequently  in the 15 mg/kg  group.  
 
Adverse  events  were  considered  to be treatment  related  in 770 subjects  (79.1%).  Treatment  related  AEs 
were  reported  at similar  rates  in the 10 and 15 mg/kg  groups  (81.8%  and 80.0%,  respectively),  and were  
mostly  Grade  1 or 2 in severity  (≥ Grade  3 treatment -related  AEs reported  in 26.1%  of subjects).  The most  
frequent  treatment -related  AEs (in > 5% of subjects)  were  diarrhea  (41.2%),  rash  (27.2%),  pruritus  (25.1%),  
fatigue  (23.8%),  nausea  (21.9%),  vomiting  (13.5%),  decreased  appetite  (11.3%),  headache  (7.2%),  pyrexia  
(7.0%),  abdominal  pain  (6.7%),  and colitis  (5.5%).

659 subjects  (67.7%)  who  received  tremelimumab  monotherapy  have  died  due to a number  of causes,  
including  0.5%  which  was attributed  to tremelimumab.  
 
 
3.6.4  Summary  of Clinical  Experience:  Combination  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
[ADDRESS_1208019]  received  tremelimumab  in combination  with  other  
anticancer  agents  in 5 of the 15 clinical  studies.  Overall,  114 of 116 subje  cts (98.3%)  treated  with  
tremelimumab  in combination  with  other  agents  experienced  at least  1 adverse  event.  The frequency  of 
events  overall  was similar  across  the combination  therapy  arms.  Adverse  events  resulted  in discontinuation  
of tremelimumab  in 25.9 % of subjects,  and were  serious  in 39.7%,  fatal  in 45.7%,  ≥ Grade  3 in severity  in 
62.9%,  and considered  to be treatment  related  in 70.7%  of subjects.  Adverse  events  reported  in > 10% of 
subjects  overall  were  diarrhea,  nausea,  fatigue,  rash,  decreased  appetite, pruritus,  vomiting,  pyrexia,  
influenza -like illness,  arthralgia,  constipation,  injection  site reaction,  thrombocytopenia,  aspartate  
aminotransferase  increased,  peripheral  edema,  alanine  aminotransferase  increased,  back  pain,  dysgeusia,  
headache,  dyspnea,  and cough.  Most  of these  events  occurred  at a higher  rate with  tremelimumab  + 
sunitinib  compared  with  the other  combinations.  
 
Of the subjects  who  experienced  AEs, 73 (62.9%)  had events  of ≥ Grade  [ADDRESS_1208020]  frequently  
reported  ≥ Grade  3 treatment  emergent  AEs (TEAEs)  (in > 3% of subjects)  were  diarrhea  (14.7%),  fatigue  
(7.8%),  hypertension  (5.2%),  disease  progression  and dyspnea  (4.3%  each),  and nausea,  alanine  
aminotransferase  increased,  lipase  increased,  and dehydration  (3.4%  each).  Adverse  events  were  considered  
to be treatment  related  in 82 subjects  (70.7%).  The most  frequent  treatment -related  TEAEs  (occurring  in > 
10%  of  subjects)   were   diarrhea  (44.0%),   pruritus   (25.0%),  fatigue   (24.1%),   rash  (23.3%),   nausea  (19.8%),

[IP_ADDRESS]  Summary  of Tremelimumab  in Breast  Cancer  
In the only reported  study  of anti-CTLA -[ADDRESS_1208023]  cancer,  conferring  a 
42% 12-week  disease  control  rate across  multiple  doses  (Vonderheide,  LoRusso  et al. 2010).  The MTD  was 
determined  to be 6mg/kg  q90d,  however,  dose  escalation  at the q28d  schedule  was aborted  when  the first 
subject  receiving  6mg/kg  q28d  developed  dose -limiting  diarrhea.  The effect  of exemestane  on the rate of 
adverse  effect  profile,  or the disease  control  rate,  is unknown.  
 
3.6.5  Tremelimumab  Dose  & Schedule  
For future  clinical  studies,  tremelimumab  will be administered  IV at a dose  of 10 mg/kg  Q4W  for the first 6 
doses,  followed  by [CONTACT_128243]  Q12W  until  disease  progression.  The proposed  dose  and schedule  is informed  
by [CONTACT_31577], safety,  and efficacy  data  on tremelimumab.  
In an early  small  Phase  2 study  (A3671002),  2 dosing  regimens  of tremelimumab  were  compared  in subjects  
with  melanoma:  15 mg/kg  Q90D  (N = 45) and 10 mg/kg  Q28D  (N = 44). Comparable  efficacy  and overall  AE 
rates  were  observed  in both  arms;  however,  the rate of treatment -related  CTCAE  Grade  3 or 4 AEs was 
higher in the 10-mg/kg  Q28D  arm (27%)  compared  to the 15-mg/kg  Q90D  arm (13%).  
 
Subsequently,  2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_865919]  (Phase  2 Study  A3671008  and Phase  3 Study  A3671009)  in 
subjects  with  melanoma  used  the regimen  15 mg/kg  Q90D.  Although  neither  study  met its primary  endpoint,  
the observed  response  rate and OS clearly  indicate  activity  of tremelimumab  in melanoma.  Retrospective  
exposure -survival  analyses  of these  studies  suggest  better  OS in subjects  with  higher  tremelimumab  
exposure  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  In the Phase  3 trial,  there  was no difference  in the incidence  of ≥ Grade  3 AEs 
between  low and high  exposure  groups  of tremelimumab.  
 
Tremelimumab  at a concentration  of 30 μg/mL  enhanced  IL-2 release  (in vitro)  and showed  antitumor  activity  
(in vivo),  and was consequently  identified  as the target  concentration.  Pharmacokinetic  simulations  indicate  
that following  a dose  of 10 mg/kg  Q28D  for 6 months,  approximately  90% of subjects  are expected  to be 
above  the target  level  of 30 μg/mL  during  the induction  phase  (See  figure  [IP_ADDRESS]).  In the Phase  3 melanoma

trial with  less frequent  dosing  of 15 mg/kg  Q90D,  only approximately  50% of the subjects  treated  with  
tremelimumab  were  above  the target  concentration,  for only  half of the dosing  interval. 
 
 
 
Q28D  = once  every  28 days;  Q90D  = once  every  90 days.  
 
Note:  The horizontal  line represents  the target  level of 30 µg/mL.  
 
 
 
Tremelimumab  at a dose  of 10 mg/kg  QM for 6 months  followed  by 10 mg/kg  Q3M  is expected  to yield  PK 
exposures  similar  to those  of the related  anti-CTLA -4 mAb  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460545] a dose  of 10 mg/kg  every  3-weeks  
followed  by 10 mg/kg  Q3M,  the dosing  regimen  that was tested  in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_865920]-line melanoma  trial 
(Robert,  Thomas  et al. 2011).  The ipi[INVESTIGATOR_865921] -term  benefits  of anti-CTLA -4 therapy  
may  be sustained  with  a reduced  frequency  of dosing  in patients  who  are benefiting  from  therapy.  
 
Based  on these  data,  tremelimumab  will be administered  at a dose  of 10 mg/kg  Q4W  for [ADDRESS_1208024]  is deriving  clinical  benefit.  
 
3.6.5  Benefit -risk and Ethical  Assessment  
In the nonclinical  setting,  treatment  of tumor -bearing  mice  with  anti-mouse  CTLA -4 mAb  (9H10)  induced  
antitumor  immunity  and markedly  enhanced  T cell-mediated  killing  of various  mouse  solid  tumors.  Clinical  
trials  of tremelimumab,  and of the related  anti-CTLA-[ADDRESS_1208025]  activity

and are usually  mild  in nature.  Events  reported  at a frequency  of ≥ 5% and assessed  by [CONTACT_865986]  (listed  in descending  order  of frequency)  were  diarrhea,  rash,  pruritus,  fatigue,  nausea,  
vomiting,  anorexia,  headache,  abdominal  pain,  and colitis.  Infusion -related  AEs were  rare.  
 
Overall,  the observed  benefit -risk profile  supports  the further  investigation  of tremelimumab  in the patient  
population  chosen  for this study.  
 
3.7 Combination  of anti-CTLA -4 antibody  with  radiotherapy:  Background  
 
A recent  phase  II study  of patients  with  melanoma  brain  metastases  treated  with  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_865922] a approximately  25%  of patients   at 12 weeks  
without  unexpected  toxicities  (Margolin,  Ernstoff  et al. 2012).These  data  are corroborated  by a retrospective  
analysis  of melanoma  patients  receiving  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_865923]  (Weber,  Amin  et al. 2011).  In 
this study,  5/12  identified  patients  had CNS clinical  benefit,  with  a median  survival  of 14 months,  and 3 
patients  living  longer  than  4 years.  
 
Combining  an anti-CTLA -4 antibody  with  radiation  therapy  (RT),  which  potentially  releases  antigenic  stimuli  
and inflammatory  cytokines  and alters  the tumor  microenvironment,  may allow  for synergistic  activity  (Shiao  
and Coussens  2010).  This could  result  in improved  clinical  outcomes  and could  lead  to an entirely  new 
treatment  approach  for patients  with  brain  metastases  in breast  and other  cancers.  
 
The synergistic  effect  of RT and immunotherapy  has been  demonstrated  in multiple  preclinical  studies.  The 
combination  of ionizing  radiotherapy  and anti-CTLA -4 antibody  delayed  growth  of irradiated  tumor,  inhibited  
lung  metastases,  and improved  survival  in a 4T1 murine  carcinoma  model  (Demaria,  Kawashima  et al. 2005).  
These  findings  were  confirmed  in a 9H10  model,  in which  combination  therapy  enhanced  primary  tumor  
regression,  and produced  abscopal  regression  of non-irradiated  lesions  (Dewan,  Galloway  et al. 2009).  
Importantly,  this study  suggested  that delays  in immunotherapy  beyond  2 days  may  reduce   anti -tumor  
activity;  additionally,  the fractionated  radiotherapy  was more  effective  compared  to single -dose.  Another  
murine  model  demonstrated  that the combination  of radiotherapy  and antibodies  against  CD137  + PD-1 was 
curative,  and associated  with  tumor -antigen  specific  CD8+  T-cell infiltration  (Verbrugge,  Hagekyriakou  et al. 
2012)  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

Approval date: [ADDRESS_1208028]  reported  a retrospective  experience  of 45 
melanoma  patients  receiving  concurrent  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  + brain  SRS (Kiess,  Wolchok  et al. 2012).  Patients  treated  
with  stereotactic  radiosurgery  (SRS)  during  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_865924],  
less neurologic  deaths  and a trend  toward  fewer  local  recurrences  than  those  treated  with  SRS before  or 
after  CTLA -4 blockade.  A follow -up evaluation  demonstrated  overall  survival  of 9 months  and 39 months  in 
melanoma  subjects  receiving  non-brain  RT during  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_865925],  respectively  
(Barker,  Postow  et al. 2013).  The possible  synergy  between  RT and CTLA -4 blockade  was also corroborated  by 
[CONTACT_865987]  (Knisely,  Yu et al. 2012).  These  results  indicate  that RT and CTLA -[ADDRESS_1208029],  whereby  [CONTACT_865988] (Postow,  Callahan  et al. 2012).  
 
3.7.1  Safety  of combination  CTLA -4 blockade/RT  
In the aforementioned  studies,  the safety  of combination  CTLA -4 blockade/RT  was evaluated.  In a single - 
institution  evaluation  of 29 subjects  receiving  non-brain  radiotherapy,  grade  ≥3 immune  related  AE’s 
occurred  in 22% of patients  receiving  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  3mg/kg,  and 43% of patients  receiving  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  10mg/kg.  
These  rates  were  not significantly  different  compared  to monotherapy  historical  controls,  and included  grade  
III cytokine  release  (n=2),  grade  III diarrhea  (n=1),  grade  III transaminase  elevation  (n=4)  , grade  III 
rash/pruritus  (n=3),  grade  3 radiculitis  (n=1),  grade  3 thrombocytopenia  (n=1),  and grade  IV uveitis  (n=1).  
Grade  ≥3 AE’s  in irradiated  organs  was 15%.  77% of patients  experienced  improvement  in symptoms  with  
therapy  (Barker,  Postow  et al. 2013).  
 
In the retrospective  evaluation  of patients  treated  with  concurrent  brain  SRS and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],  patients  
receiving  concurrent  SRS and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  (n=14)  experienced  grade  ≥3 toxicities  including  rash/pruritus  (7%),  
cardiopulmonary  (7%),  CNS bleeding  of treated  brain  metastases  (14%),  and seizure  (14%).  On MRI,  40% of 
metastases  treated  during  or before  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_865926]  150%,  of which  only  
ultimately  7% reflected  recurrence.  The majority  of CNS bleeds  or increased  tumor  size was asymptomatic,  
but some  were  associated  with  seizure  or headache.  CNS bleeds  did not interfere  with  completion  of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  (Kiess,  Wolchok  et al. 2012).  In a  separate  retrospective  evaluation,  melanoma  patients  who  
received  both  SRS and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_865927],  
however  the timing  of SRS compared  to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_865928],  and may  not have  
been  delivered  concurrently  (Mathew,  Tam  et al. 2013).  In an additional  retrospective  series  of 13 melanoma  
patients,  combination  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  + WBRT  was safe,  with  only  1 patient  experiencing  a grade  III/IV  acute  CNS- 
related  toxicity  (cognitive  change).  (Gerber,  Young  et al. 2014)  Finally,  the concordant  toxicity  profiles  of 
tremelimumab  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_865929] -effect  (CTLA -4 blockade),  and 
that tremelimumab+RT  may  have  a similar  safety  profile  as ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]+RT.  
 
A related  strategy  is to combine  potential  tumor -antigen  releasing  therapeutic  modalities  with  anti-CTLA -4 
therapy.  For example,  thermal  ablation  leads  to immediate  tissue  destruction  and necrosis  secondary  to 
crystallization,  osmotic  changes,  and vascular  stasis.  This promotes  a release  of tumor  antigen  that could  
activate  a specific  immune   response  (Sabel  2009).  At MSKCC,  we have  conducted  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_533443],

evaluating  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103966]/or  cryoablation  in [ADDRESS_1208030] -of-care  mastectomy.  With  a median  followup  of  15 
months,  no treatment -related  grade  III/IV  toxicities  were  reported  (Diab,  Solomon  et al. 2013).  
 
In summary,  the incidence  and prevalence  of BCBM  continues  to increase  and these  patients  need  new  and 
effective  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  We hypothesize,  based  on the compelling  clinical  and  pre-clinical   evidence   outlined  
above,  that the combination  of tumor -targeted  brain  RT with  systemic  CTLA -4 blockade  with  tremelimumab  
will induce  disease  control  and ultimately  permit  a clinically  meaningful  delay  in cytotoxic  chemotherapy.  We 
therefore  propose  a Simon  2-stage  study  of tremelimumab  with  brain  RT in women  with  BCBM  for whom  
cytotoxic  therapy  is planned.  
3.8 Combination  of anti -CTLA -4 therapy  with  anti -HER2  therapy:  background  
 
Trastuzumab  is a therapeutic  human  antibody  against  human  epi[INVESTIGATOR_61977]  2 (HER2),  and is 
commonly  used  to treat  metastatic  breast  cancer  in patients  with  HER2 -overexpressing  tumors  (Hudis  2007).  
The therapeutic  mechanism  of trastuzumab  is multifold,  with  activity  attributed  to inhibition  of downstream  
HER2  signaling  as well as immune  modulation.  The immune  activity  of trastuzumab  is pleiotropic,  dependent  
on both  antibody -dependent  cell-mediated  cytotoxicity,  antibody  production,  and T-cell activation   (Page,  
Naidoo  et al. 2014).  
 
While  trastuzumab  has limited  efficacy  as monotherapy,  clinical  benefit  is maximized  when  trastuzumab  is 
combined  with  a cytotoxic  backbone  (Hudis  2007).  Based  upon  expert  opi[INVESTIGATOR_865930],  it is 
now  standard  practice  to continue  trastuzumab  at the time  of progression,  when  a switch  in the cytotoxic  
backbone  is required  (von  Minckwitz,  du Bois et al. 2009,  Hamberg,  Bos et al. 2011 ). In patients  with  newly  
diagnosed  brain  metastasis,  trastuzumab  is often  continued  during  and after  brain  irradiation,  whereas  
systemic  therapy  is suspended  for several  weeks  to minimize  the risk of exacerbating  radiotoxicity.  
 
Trastuzumab  is generally  well tolerated.  However,  <5% of patients  experience  cardiotoxicity,  which  is 
generally  reversible  upon  discontinuation  of therapy  (Hudis  2007).  Other  potential  adverse  effects  include  
infusion  reaction  and rash.  The mechanism  of cardiotoxicity  is thought  to be related  to inhibition  of 
downstream  HER2  signaling,  which  is integral  to growth,  repair  and survival  of cardiac  myocytes  (Fedele,  
Riccio  et al. 2012).  No data  suggests  an immune -based  mechanism  of cardiotoxicity.  
 
Because  of the immune -mediated  mechanism  of trastuzumab,  combination  with  anti-CTLA -4 may  produce  
synergistic  clinical  benefit.  In mice,  combination  anti-CTLA -4 with  anti-HER2 and AKT blockade  generated  
synergistic  tumor  regression  (Wang,  Li et al. 2012).  Additionally,  anti-HER2  antibody  has been  shown  to 
synergize  with  otherimmunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including  vaccine  therapy  and anti-PD-1 (Stagg,  Loi et al. 2011),  with  
no reports  of unanticipated  adverse  events.  Anti-CTLA -4 has been  safely  combined  with  other  therapeutic  
antibodies  in humans  (Wolchok,  Kluger  et al. 2013).  
 
3.9 Durvalumab  
 
Durvalumab  is a human  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  of the immunoglobin  G (igG)  1 kappa  subclass  that 
blocks  the interaction  of PD-L1 (but not programmed  cell death  ligand-2) with  PD-1 T cells  and CD80  (B7.1)  
on immune  cells  (IC). It is being  developed  by [CONTACT_38227]/MedImmune  for use in the treatment  of cancer.  
(MedImmune  is a wholly  owned  subsidiary  of [COMPANY_008];  [COMPANY_008]/MedImmune  will be referred  to as

[COMPANY_008]  throughout  this document.)  Durvalumab  has been  engineered  to reduce  antibody-dependent 
cellular  cytotoxicity  and complement -dependent  cytotoxicity.  In vitro  studies  demonstrate  that durvalumab  
antagonizes  the inhibitory  effect  of PD-L1 on primary  human  T cells,  resulting  in their  restored  proliferation  
and release  of interferon  gamma  (IFNγ;  Stewart  et al. 2015) . 
 
As of the DCO  date  (12 July 2016),  a total  of [ADDRESS_1208031]  been  exposed  to 1 or more  doses  of 
durvalumab  in ongoing  open -label  [COMPANY_008] - or MedImmune -sponsored  Phase  I-III monotherapy  and 
combination  therapy  studies  across  all indications.  Refer  to the current  duvalumab  Investigator’s  Brochure  
for a complete  summary  of non-clinical  and clinical  information  including  safety,  efficacy,  and 
pharmacokinetics.  
 
3.9.[ADDRESS_1208032]  additive  or synergistic  activity  (Pardoll  2012)  because  the 
mechanisms  of action  of CTLA -4 and PD-1 are non-redundant;  therefore,  [COMPANY_008]  is also investigating  the 
use of durvalumab  + tremelimumab  combination  therapy  for the treatment  of cancer.  Combination  
CTLA -[ADDRESS_1208033]  demonstrated  synergy  compared  with  either  strategy  alone  in other  
settings  including  metastatic  melanoma  (Wolchok  JDNEJM 2013,  Postow  AACR  2016).  
 
The durvalumab  + tremelimumab  doses  and regimen  selected  for this study  are based  on the goal of 
selecting  an optimal  combination  dose  of durvalumab  and tremelimumab  that would  yield  sustained  target  
suppression  (sPD -L1), demonstrate  promising  efficacy,  and have  an acceptable  safety  profile.  
 
3.9.2 Fixed  Dosing  for durvalumab  and  tremelimumab  
A population  PK model  was developed  for durvalumab  using  monotherapy  data from  a Phase  1 study  ( study  
1108;  N=292;  doses=  0.1 to 10 mg/kg  Q2W  or 15 mg/kg  Q3W;  solid  tumors ). Population  PK analysis  indicated  
only  minor  impact  of body  weight  (WT)  on PK of durvalumab  (coefficient  of ≤ 0.5).  The impact of body  WT- 
based  (10 mg/kg  Q2W)  and fixed  dosing  (750  mg Q2W)  of durvalumab  was evaluated  by [CONTACT_865989]  (5th, median  and 95th  percentiles)  using  the population  PK model.  A fixed  dose  
of 750 mg was selected  to approximate  10 mg/kg  (based  on median  body  WT of ~75 kg). A total  of 1000  
patients  were  simulated  using  body  WT distribution  of 40–[ADDRESS_1208034]  variability  with  fixed  dosing  regimen.  
 
Similarly,  a population  PK model  was developed  for tremelimumab  using  data  from  Phase  1 through  Phase  3 
(N=654;  doses=  0.01  to 15 mg/kg  Q4W  or Q90D;  metastatic  melanoma ) [Wang  et al. 2014].  Population  PK 
model  indicated  minor  impact  of body  WT on PK of tremelimumab  (coefficient  of ≤ 0.5).  The WT-based  (1 
mg/kg  Q4W)  and fixed  dosing  (75 mg/kg  Q4W;  based  on median  body  WT of ~75 kg) regimens   were  
compared  using  predicted  PK concentrations  (5th, median  and 95th  percentiles)  using  population  PK model  in 
a simulated  population  of [ADDRESS_1208035]  variability  with  fixed  dosing  
regimen.

Approval date: [ADDRESS_1208036]  been  reported  by [CONTACT_2312]  [Ng et al 2006,  Wang  et al. 2009,  Zhang  et al, 2012,Narwal  et al 
2013].  Wang  and colleagues  investigated  [ADDRESS_1208037]  variability  in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics  parameters  [Zhang  et al 
2012].  
 
A fixed  dosing  approach  is preferred  by [CONTACT_865990].  Given  expectation  of similar  pharmacokinetic  exposure  and variability,  we considered  it feasible  to 
switch  to fixed  dosing  regimens.  Based  on average  body  WT of 75 kg, a fixed  dose  of 750 mg Q2W  MEDI4736  
(equivalent  to 10 mg/kg  Q2W),  1500  mg Q4W  durvalumab  (equivalent  to 20 mg/kg  Q4W)  and 75 mg Q4W  
tremelimumab  (equivalent  to 1 mg/kg  Q4W)  is included  in the current  study.  
 
Fixed  dosing  of durvalumab  and tremelimumab  is recommended  only for subjects  with  > 30kg  body  weight  
due to endotoxin  exposure.  Patients  with  a body  weight  less than  or equal  to 30 kg should  be dosed  using  a 
weight -based  dosing  schedule.  
 
3.9.3 Safety  of durvalumab  
 
Risks  with  durvalumab  include  diarrhea,  colitis,  pneumonitis  /ILD,  endocrinopathies  (hypo- and hyper - 
thyroidism,  type  I diabetes  mellitus,  diabetes  insipi[INVESTIGATOR_27562],  hypophysitis  and adrenal  insufficiency)  
hepatitis/hepatotoxicity/increases  in transaminases,  neurotoxicities,  nephritis/increases  in creatinine,  
pancreatitis,   rash/pruritus/dermatitis,   myocarditis,  infusion -related   reactions,   anaphylaxis,   hypersensitivity  
or allergic  reactions,  and immune  complex  disease.  
 
Further  information  on these  risks  can be found  in the current  version  of the durvalumab  IB. 
 
In monotherapy  clinical  studies  AEs (all grades)  reported  very commonly  (≥10%  of patients)   are fatigue,  
nausea,  decreased  appetite,  dyspnea,  cough,  constipation,  diarrhea,  vomiting,  back  pain,  pyrexia,  abdominal  
pain,  anemia,  arthralgia,  peripheral  edema,  headache,  rash,  and pruritus.  Approximately  8% of patients  
experienced  an AE that resulted  in permanent  discontinuation  of durvalumab  and approximately  5%  of 
patients  experienced  an SAE that was considered  to be related  to durvalumab  by [CONTACT_154976].  
 
The majority  of treatment -related  AEs were  manageable  with  dose  delays,  symptomatic  treatment,  and in 
the case of events  suspected  to have  an immune  basis,  the use of established  treatment  guidelines  for 
immune -mediated  toxicity  (see the Dosing  Modification  and Toxicity  Management  Guidelines  in Error!  
Reference  source  not found. ). 
 
A detailed  summary  of durvalumab  monotherapy  AE data  can be found  in the current  version  of the 
durvalumab  IB. 
3.9.4 Safety  of durvalumab  + tremelimumab  
 
The safety  of durvalumab  + tremelimumab  combination  therapy  is being  evaluated  in the ongoing  dose  
escalation  and dose  expansion  Study  006, in patients  with  NSCLC,  and has so far shown  a manageable  safety  
and tolerability  profile.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

Approval date: 29 -Jun-2018  
Page  30 of 98  
  
 
The potential  risks  with  the combination  of durvalumab  + tremelimumab  are similar  to those  for durvalumab  
and tremelimumab  monotherapy.  Emerging  data  from  study  006 and from  combinations  of other  agents  in 
the same  class  indicate  an increased  frequency  and/or  severity  of some  of these  potential  immune -mediated  
toxicities.  
 
In durvalumab  + tremelimumab  combination  studies  at the dose  of durvalumab  20mg/kg  and tremelimumab  
1mg/kg  AEs (all grades)  reported  very  commonly  (≥10%  of patients)  are fatigue,  diarrhea,  nausea,  dyspnea,  
decreased  appetite,  pruritus,  vomiting,  anemia,  constipation,  cough,  abdominal  pain,  pyrexia,  back  pain 
hyponatremia  and rash.  
 
Approximately  13% of patients  experienced  an AE that resulted  in permanent  discontinuation  of study  drug  
and approximately  13% of patients  experienced  an SAE that was considered  to be related  to durvalumab  and 
tremelimumab  by [CONTACT_154976].  
A detailed  summary  of durvalumab  + tremelimumab  combination  AE data  can be found  in the  current  
version  of the durvalumab  IB. 
 
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design 
 
4.1.1 Efficacy  and  safety  cohort  study  (completed  as of 3/1/2017)  
 
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_865931],  breast  cancer  patients  with  brain  metastasis  (BCBM)  and measurable  
systemic  disease  for whom  whole  brain  radiation  treatment  or stereotactic  radiosurgery  is indicated  received  
tremelimumab  10mg/kg  q28 days,  with  the first dose  initiated during  or in proximity  to administration  of 
radiotherapy.  The primary  objective  was to evaluate  non-CNS disease  control  at 12 weeks.  Secondary  
objectives  were  to characterize  safety  and to evaluate  anti-tumor  efficacy  using   other  metrics  including  
overall  survival  (OS),  CNS 24 week  objective  response,  and CNS and non-CNS progression  free survival  (PFS).  
Additionally,  the safety  of tremelimumab  and HER2  directed  therapy  co-administration  will be evaluated  in a 
parallel  safety  cohort.  
 
Eligible  patients  were  ≥18 years  with  good  functional  status  (ECOG  0-2) and life expectancy  ≥12weeks,  with  
pathologically  confirmed  invasive  breast  carcinoma  (any  histologic  subtype),  radiologically  confirmed  brain  
metastases  for which  standard -of-care brain   RT (either  SRS or WBRT)  was planned,  and RECIST1.1  
measurable  non-CNS metastases  with  recent  progression  of disease  as determined  by [CONTACT_093],  for 
which  a change  in systemic  therapy  is planned.  Alternatively,  patients  who  had stable  disease  to their  current  
systemic  therapy  were  also eligible  if a  treatment  holiday  was planned.  Subjects  with  CNS complications  
requiring  urgent  neurosurgical  intervention  or intrathecal  therapy  / intravenous  methotrexate  for 
leptomeningeal  disease  were  excluded.  
 
A Simon  2-stage  single -arm design  (n=17)  was employed  to evaluate  for preliminary  efficacy.  A maximum  of 
[ADDRESS_1208038] 9 subjects  were  enrolled,  and the accrual  to this arm continued,  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 15 -038 A(7)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_1208039] dose  of tremelimumab  was administered  at 10mg/kg  two days  prior  to initiation  of radiotherapy.  If 
not feasible,  tremelimumab  was administered  any day from  [ADDRESS_1208040]  non-negligible  serum  chemotherapy  levels  at the time  of tremelimumab  administration.  
Thus,  we will exclude  enrollment  of patients  with  ongoing  reversible  ≥CTCAE  grade  II chemotherapy -related  
toxicities.  We believe  the risk of unfavorable  drug -drug  interactions  is acceptably  low,  as the safety  of anti- 
CTLA -4 therapy  combined  with  various  cytotoxic  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_865932]  (Reck,  
Bondarenko  et al. 2013,  Weber,  Hamid  et al. 2013 ). Concurrent  administration  of cytotoxic  therapy  with  
tremelimumab  will not be permitted.  Concurrent  bone -directed  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_865933].  
 
Subsequent  tremelimumab  doses  were  administered  at 10mg/kg  every  28 days  +/- 1 week  until  radiographic  
progression  or until  treatment  was no longer  tolerated.  
Patients  for whom  concurrent  HER2  directed  therapy  is indicated,  as determined  by [CONTACT_209859],  
were  enrolled  in a parallel  HER2  directed  therapy  safety  arm.  As described  in section  3.8, the combination  of 
tremelimumab  and HER2  directed  therapy  with  brain  irradiation  was anticipated  to be safe,  with  possible  
synergistic  benefit.  However,  because  HER2  directed  therapy  had not yet been  evaluated  in combination  
with  tremelimumab  in humans,  additional  precautions  were  taken  to monitor  for overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_850872].  A 
modified  3+[ADDRESS_1208041] three  subjects.  If the HER2  directed  therapy  safety  
arm completes  accrual  prior  to completion  of the Simon  2-stage  efficacy  arm,  an expansion  cohort  will be 
considered  under  a protocol  amendment.  Similarly,  if concurrent  HER2  directed  therapy  /tremelimumab/RT  
is not tolerated at the specified dose, a dose de-escalation cohort may be considered under a protocol 
amendment.  
 
Steroids  and anti-seizure  medications  are permitted  on study.  However,  because  steroid  administration  
practices  vary in clinical  practice,  and because  of the potential  impact  on immune  modulation,  
recommendations  for steroid  use will be provided  (section  9.1).  Serum  levels  of anti-seizure medications  will 
be monitored  at the discretion  of the treating  neurologist.  
As of 3/1/17,  the primary  endpoint  was established  for the efficacy  arm without  HER2 -directed  therapy  and 
the safety  arm with  HER2 -directed  therapy.  Specifically,  the 12 week  disease  control  rate was 2/20  (10%)  in 
the efficacy  arm and 2/6 (33%)  in the safety  arm.  One patient  treated  with  concurrent  HER2 -directed  therapy  
had a 57% partial  response  by [CONTACT_393]  v1.[ADDRESS_1208042]  common  treatment  
related  AEs were  diarrhea (12.9%),  fatigue  (9.7%),  and colitis  (6.5%).  Thus,  an expansion  of the HER2  arm is 
planned  in a parallel  Simon  two-stage  design  to evaluate  efficacy  of brain  RT with  checkpoint  blockade  and

concurrent  HER2 -directed  therapy.  However,  because  of the diarrhea  and colitis  associated  with  
tremelimumab  mediated  CTLA4  blockade  when  administered  at 10mg/kg  monthly  (a well described  class  
effect),  a lower  dose  of tremelimumab  will be co-administered  with  trastuzumab  in the expansion  study  in 
combination  with  durvalumab,  a PD-L1 directed  antibody  that is currently  US FDA approved  for other  
indications.  
 
4.1.2 Expansion  Study  (planned  as of 3/1/2017)  
 
The expansion  cohort  for the HER2+  breast  cancer  patients  who  are also undergoing  concurrent  HER2  
directed  therapy  is designed  as a Simon’s  two-stage  optimal  study  with  design  parameters  similar  to that 
used  to study  patients  not requiring  continuation  of HER2  directed  therapy.  Specifically,  a maximum  of 17 
HER2+  breast  cancer  patients  will be enrolled  in a Simon  2-stage  design  to evaluate  for preliminary  efficacy.  
 
As described  in section  3.8, the combination  of tremelimumab  and HER2  directed  therapy  with  brain  
irradiation  was safe,  with  possible  synergistic  benefit.  However,  because   HER2  directed  therapy  has not yet 
been  evaluated  in combination  with  tremelimumab  and durvalumab  in humans,  additional  precautions  will 
be taken  to monitor for overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_850872].  A modified  3+[ADDRESS_1208043] three  subjects.  Similarly,  if concurrent  HER2  
directed  therapy  /tremelimumab/durvalumab/RT  is not tolerated  at the specified  dose,  a dose  de-escalation  
cohort  may  be considered  under  a protocol  amendment.  
 
Patients  in this expansion  will have  two biopsies  attempted.  The first tissue  biopsy  will be collected  
(attempted)  at baseline,  within  28 days  prior  to starting  study  treatment.  A second,  optional,  biopsy  will be 
performed  at times  such  as disease  progression,  prior  to starting  a new systemic  cancer  treatment  and if the 
patient’s  condition  allows  it, or at the time  of radiographic  response,  at the investigator’s  discretion  and in 
discussion  with  the patient.  Tissue  biopsy  will be taken  by [CONTACT_865991].  For each  core 
needle  biopsy,  an attempt  should  be made  to collect  at least  3 core  needle  samples;  however,  if it is not 
medically  feasible  to collect  [ADDRESS_1208044]  as much  tumor  
tissue  as is deemed  medically  feasible.  
 
 
Eligible  patients  will be ≥18 years  with  good  functional  status  (ECOG  0-2) and life expectancy  ≥12weeks,  with  
pathologically  confirmed  HER2 -positive  invasive  breast  carcinoma  (3+ by [CONTACT_69162]/or  > 2.0 by [CONTACT_4656]),  
radiologically  confirmed  brain  metastases  for which  standard -of-care  brain  RT (either  SRS or WBRT)  is 
planned,  and RECIST1.[ADDRESS_1208045]  
stable  disease  to their  current  systemic  therapy  will also be eligible  if a treatment  holiday  is planned.  Subjects  
with  CNS complications  requiring  urgent  neurosurgical  intervention  or intrathecal  therapy  / intravenous

administration  of cytotoxic  therapy  on study  will not be permitted.  Concurrent  bone -directed  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_865935].  
 
Steroids  and anti-seizure  medications  are permitted  on study.  However,  because  steroid  administration  
practices  vary in clinical  practice,  and because  of the potential  impact  on immune  modulation,  
recommendations  for steroid  use will be provided  (section  9.1).  Serum  levels  of anti-seizure medications  will 
be monitored  at the discretion  of the treating  neurologist.  
 
4.2 Intervention  
 
4.2.1  Tremelimumab  and  Radiotherapy  administration  
Dose  1 of tremelimumab  (at 10mg/kg)  will ideally  be administered  2 days  prior  to initiation  of brain  
radiotherapy  (or between  5 days  prior  and 3 days  after  initiation  of radiotherapy  if administration  2 days  
prior  to initiation  of brain  radiotherapy  is not feasible).  Subjects  will receive  either  WBRT  or SRS, depending  
on the number  and size of their  brain  metastases,  as per the standard  of care.  
 
Following  dose  1, tremelimumab  will be administered  q28 days  from  the date  of first tremelimumab  
administration,  plus or minus  1 week.  Immune  monitoring  blood  draws  will occur  as outlined  in section  10. 
 
4.2.2 Concurrent  trastuzumab  and other  HER2  directed  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_865936] 2mg/kg  IV weekly,  or 6mg/kg  IV 
every  three  weeks.  Because  both  schedules  are acceptable  and regarded  as equivalent,  the  dose   and 
schedule  for trastuzumab  will be administered  at the discretion  of the treating  physician.  Cardiac  monitoring  
with  transthoracic  echocardiogram  (TTE)  or MUGA  is recommended  every  [ADDRESS_1208048]  practice  at the discretion  of the treating  physician.  
 
4.2.3 Protocol    Expansion:    Tremelimumab,    durvalumab,    and   HER2    directed   therapi[INVESTIGATOR_865937]. 
 
Dose  1 of tremelimumab  and durvalumab  (75 mg and 1500  mg, respectively)  will ideally  be administered  2 
days  prior   to  initiation   of  brain   radiotherapy   (or  between   5  days  prior   and  3  days  after  in itiation   of

radiotherapy).  Subjects  will receive  either  WBRT  or SRS, depending  on the number  and size of their  brain  
metastases,  as per the standard  of care.  
Following  the first dose,  tremelimumab  and durvalumab  will be administered  q28 days  from  the date  of first 
tremelimumab  and durvalumab  administration,  plus or minus  1 week,  for 4 cycles.  After  the fourth  cycle,  
durvalumab  will be administered  alone  until  progression  of disease  or unacceptable  toxicity.  HER2  directed  
therapy  will be administered  per the NCCN -guideline -endorsed  dose  and schedule,  as determined  by [CONTACT_1275].  
 
Immune  monitoring  blood  draws  will occur  as outlined  in section  10.1.  
 
4.2.4 Duration  of treatment  and criteria  for retreatment  
 
For patients  receiving  durvalumab  + tremelimumab,  retreatment  is allowed  (once  only)  for patients  meeting  
the retreatment  criteria  below.  The same  treatment  guidelines  followed  during  the initial  treatment  period  
will be followed  during  the retreatment  period,  including  the same  dose  and frequency  of treatments  and 
the same  schedule  of assessments.  
 
Patients  receiving  the combination  of durvalumab  and tremelimumab  may  undergo  retreatment   in  the 
clinical  scenario,  described  below:  
1. Patients  who  complete  the 4 dosing  cycles  of the combination  of durvalumab  and tremelimumab  
portion  of the regimen  (with  clinical  benefit  per Investigator  judgment),  but subsequently  have  
evidence  of PD during  the durvalumab  monotherapy  portion  of the combination  regimen,  with  or 
without  confirmation  according  to RECIST  1.1, may  restart  treatment  with  the combination.  
 
For the durvalumab  + tremelimumab  treatment  group,  before  restarting  their  assigned  treatment,  the 
Investigator  should  ensure  that the patient:  
 
1. Does  not have  any significant,  unacceptable,  or irreversible  toxicities  that indicate  continuing  
treatment  will not further  benefit  the patient  
 
2. Still fulfils  the eligibility  criteria  for this study,  including  re-consenting to restart  durvalumab  and 
tremelimumab  
 
3. Has not received  an intervening  systemic  anticancer  therapy  after  their  assigned  treatment  
discontinuation.  
 
4. Has had a baseline  tumor  assessment  within  28 days  of restarting  their  assigned  treatment;  all 
further  scans  should  occur  with  the same  frequency  as during  the initial  treatment  period  until  
study  treatment  is stopped.  
 
During  the retreatment  period,  patients  receiving  durvalumab  + tremelimumab  may  resume  durvalumab  
dosing  at 1500  mg q4w with  75 mg of tremelimumab  q4w  for 4 doses  each.  After  the 4th dose,  the treating  
investigator  and site PI [INVESTIGATOR_865938]’s  clinical  and radiographic  status  to confirm  if the patient  
should  continue  on the tremelimumab  + durvalumab  combination,  or if they  should  continue  with  
durvalumab  monotherapy  at 1500  mg q4w.

Treatment  through  progression  is at the Investigator’s  discretion,  and the Investigator  should  ensure  that 
patients  do not have  any significant,  unacceptable,  or irreversible  toxicity  that indicate  that continuing  
treatment  will not further  benefit  the patient.   A patient  with  a confirmed  progression  receiving  
durvalumab  + tremelimumab  cannot  continue  therapy  or obtain  retreatment  if dosing  is ongoing  in the 
combination  portion  of therapy  (q4w  dosing)  and progression  occurs  in a target  lesion  that has previously  
shown  a confirmed  response.

administered  in cases  of oligometastatic  disease,  with  ≤[ADDRESS_1208051]  with  combined  RT+ anti-CTLA -4 (Dewan,  Galloway  et al. 2009).  This was corroborated  by a 
murine  melanoma  study  which  demonstrated  optimal  tumor  control  with  7.5Gy/fraction  dosing,  which  
generated  the highest  interferon  production,  and a favorable  ratio  of effector  to regulatory  T-cell 
proliferation  (Schaue,  Ratikan  et al. 2012).  The translatability  of these  findings  to humans  is unknown,  and 
the relative  immunogenicity  of alternative  radiotherapy  regimens  such  as SRS and WBRT  should  be explored  
in a clinical  trial.

refrigerator  at 2- oC. The 20 mg/mL  solution  will be diluted  into a saline  bag for IV infusion.  Vials  containing  
tremelimumab  may  be gently  inverted  for mixing,  but should  not be shaken.  
 
For dose  preparation  steps,  the following  ancillary  items  are required:  
 
• IV infusion  bags  of 0.9%  sodium  chloride  injection  (250  mL size).  Saline  bags  must  be latex -free 
and can be made  of polyvinyl  chloride  (PVC)  or polyolefin  (e.g.,  polyethylene),  manufactured  with  
bis (2-ethylhexyl)  phthalate  (DEHP)  or DEHP -free.  
• IV infusion  lines  made  of PVC/DEHP  or PVC/tri  octyl  trimellitate  (TOTM)  or polyethylene  or 
polyurethane.  All DEHP -containing  or DEHP -free lines  are acceptable.  Lines  should  contain  a 0.22  
or 0.2 µm in-line filter.  The in-line filter  can be made  of polyethersulfone  (PES)  or polyvinylidine  
fluoride  DRF (PVDF).  Lines  containing  cellulose  -based  filters  should  not be used  with  
tremelimumab.  
• Catheters/infusion  sets made  of polyurethane  or fluoropolymer  with  silicone  and stainless  steel  
and/or  PVC components.  
• Syringes  made  of polypropylene  and latex -free.  Polycarbonate  syringes  should  not be used  with  
tremelimumab.  
• Needles  made  of stainless  steel.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose  Calculation  
Subject weight  at baseline  should  be used  for dosing  calculations  unless  there  is a ≥ 10%  change  in weight.  
The dose  will be calculated  using  the following  formula:  
Dose  (mL)  = [subject  weight  (kg) × dose  level  (10 mg/kg)]  
drug  concentration  (20 mg/mL)  
The corresponding  volume  of investigational  product  should  be rounded  to the nearest  tenth  mL (0.1 mL). 
Each  vial contains  a small  amount  of overage  and the overage  should  be utilized  as much  as possible  before  
using  another  vial. 
 
The number  of vials  required  for dose  preparation  is the next  greatest  whole  number  of vials  from  the 
following  formula:  
 
Number  of vials  = Dose  (mL)  ÷ 20 (mL/vial)  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose  Preparation  Steps  
Tremelimumab  does  not contain  preservatives  and any unused  portion  must  be discarded.  Preparation  of 
tremelimumab  and preparation  of the IV bag are to be performed  aseptically.  Total  in-use storage  time  for 
the prepared   final IV bag should   not exceed  24 hours  at 2-8°C or 4 hours  at room  temperature  (25°C).  
However,  it is recommended  that the prepared  final  IV bag be stored  in the dark at 2-8°C until  needed.  The 
refrigerated  infusion  solutions  in the prepared  final  IV bag should  be equilibrated  at room  temperature  for

1) All investigational  product  vials  should  be equilibrated  to room  temperature  for 30 minutes  prior  
to dose  preparation.  
2) To prepare  the IV bag, first,  calculate  the dose  volume  of investigational   product  required.  
Second,  remove  the volume  of 0.9%  sodium  chloride  IV solution  equivalent  to the  calculated  
dose  volume  of investigational  product  from  the IV bag. Lastly,  add the calculated  dose  volume  of 
investigational  product  to the IV bag. Gently  mix the solution  in the bag by [CONTACT_865992].  Avoid  shaking  the IV bag to prevent  foaming.  
 
 
Example:  A subject  weighing  85 kg will require  42.5 mL (3 vials)  of investigational  product.  Remove  42.[ADDRESS_1208058]  should  be administered  using  
the following  guidelines:  
1) Investigational  product  must  be administered  at room  temperature  (25°C)  by [CONTACT_498275] a peripheral  vein.  Prior  to the start  of the infusion,  ensure  that the 
bag contents  are at room  temperature  to avoid  an infusion  reaction  due to the administration  of the 
solution  at low temperatures.  
2) A physician  must   be present  at the site or immediately  available  to respond  to emergencies  
during  all administrations  of investigational  product.  Fully  functional  resuscitation  facilities  
should  be available.  
3) Investigational  product  must  not be administered  via IV push  or bolus  but as a slow  IV infusion.  
The entire  content  of each  IV bag will be infused  using  an infusion  pump.  
4) The infusion  lines  should  be attached  only  at time  of use. Lines  used  for infusion  during  dose  
administration  will need  to be equipped  with  0.22  or 0.2 μm in-line filters.  
5) If there  are no requirements  to slow,  interrupt,  or permanently  stop  the infusion,  the anticipated  
infusion  time  to deliver each  dose  (250  mL) is anticipated  to be at least  60 minutes.  
6) Some  investigational  product  may  remain  in the IV line after  the infusion  has completed.  Fif teen  
to 30 mL of 0.9%  sodium  chloride  IV solution  should  be added  to the infusion  bag after  the 
investigational  product  has been  administered  to flush  the line.  The infusion  rate should  not be 
changed.  
 
 
The duration  of the investigational  product  administration  will be recorded.  
 
5.2.6 Monitoring  of Dose  Administration  
Vital  signs  (blood  pressure,  temperature,  pulse,  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2844])  will be collected  before  investigational

A dose  of 75 mg (for patients  >30kg  in weight)  will be administered  using  an IV bag containing  0.9%  (w/v)  
saline  or 5% (w/v)  dextrose,  with  a final tremelimumab  concentration  ranging  from  0.10  to 10 mg/mL,  and 
delivered  through  an IV administration  set with  a 0.2- or 0.22 -μm in-line filter.  Add 3.8 mL (i.e.,[ADDRESS_1208066]  tenth  mL) to the IV bag.  The IV bag size should  
be selected  such  that the final  concentration  is within  0.10  to 10 mg/mL.  Mix the bag by [CONTACT_865993].  
 
Weight -based  dosing  (for patients  ≤30 kg) will be administered  using  an IV bag containing  0.9%  (w/v)  saline  
or 5% (w/v)  dextrose,  with  a final  tremelimumab  concentration  ranging  from  0.10 to 10 mg/mL,   and 
delivered  through  an IV administration  set with  a 0.2- or 0.22 -μm in-line filter.  
 
It is recommended  that the prepared  final IV bag be stored  in the dark  at 2ºC-8°C (36°F -46°F)  until  needed.  If 
storage  time  exceeds  these  limits,  a new dose  must  be prepared  from  new vials.  The refrigerated  infusion  
solutions  in the prepared  final  IV bag should  be equilibrated  at room  temperature  for about  [ADDRESS_1208067]  should  be administered  using  
the following  guidelines:  
1) Investigational  product  must  be administered  at room  temperature  (25°C)  by [CONTACT_865994] a peripheral  or central  vein.  Prior  to the start  of the infusion,  ensure  
that the bag contents  are at room  temperature  to avoid  an infusion  reaction  due to the 
administration  of the solution  at low temperatures.  
2) A physician  must  be present  at the site or immediately  available  to respond  to emergencies  
during  all administrations  of investigational  product.  Fully  functional  resuscitation  facilities  
should  be available.  
3) Investigational  product  must  not be administered  via IV push  or bolus but as a slow  IV infusion.  
The entire  content  of each  IV bag will be infused  using  an infusion  pump.  
4) The infusion  lines  should  be attached  only  at time  of use. Lines  used  for infusion  during  dose  
administration  will need  to be equipped  with  0.22  or 0.2 μm in-line filters.  
5) If there  are no requirements  to slow,  interrupt,  or permanently  stop the infusion,  the anticipated  
infusion   time   to  deliver   each   dose   is  approximately   60 minutes  (±5  minutes).   Less  than   55

minutes  is considered  a deviation.  If there  are interruptions  during  infusion,  the total  allowed  
time  should  not exceed  8 hours  at room  temperature.  
6) The IV line will be flushed  with  a volume  of IV solution  (0.9%  [w/v]  saline  equal  to the priming  
volume  of the infusion  set used  after  the contents  of the IV bag are fully administered,  or 
complete  the infusion  according  to institutional  policy  to ensure  the full dose  is administered  and 
document  if the line was not flushed.  
 
The duration  of the investigational  product  administration  will be recorded.  
 
5.3.7 Monitoring  of Dose  Administration  
Vital  signs  (blood  pressure,  temperature,  pulse,  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2844])  will be collected  before  investigational  
product  infusion,  every  30 minutes  +/- 10 minutes  during  infusion,  at completion  of infusion,  and 30 and 60 
minutes  +/- [ADDRESS_1208068] cycle,  subsequent  infusion  
observation  periods  can be at the Investigator’s  discretion  (suggested  30 minutes  after each  durvalumab  and 
tremelimumab  infusion).  If the infusion  takes  longer  than  [ADDRESS_1208069]  be trained  to recognize  and treat  anaphylaxis,  as per local  institutional  guidelines.  
 
In the event  of a ≤Grade  2 infusion -related  reaction,  the infusion  rate of study  drug  may  be decreased  by 50% 
or interrupted  until  resolution  of the event  and re-initiated  at 50% of the initial  rate until  completion  of the 
infusion.   For patients  with  a ≤Grade  2 infusion -related  reaction,  subsequent  infusions  may  be administered  
at 50% of the initial  rate.  Acetaminophen  and/or  an antihistamine  (eg, diphenhydramine)  or equivalent  
medications  per institutional  standard  may  be administered  at the discretion  of the treating  investigator.  If

7.0        RECRUITMENT  PLA N 
 
7.1 Expansion  recruitment  plan  
 
The study will enroll at two locations, MSKCC and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) in Los Angeles. MSKCC 
and CSMC  provide  large  referral  bases,  with  approximately  [ADDRESS_1208102]  cancer  
treated  with  WBRT or SRS across  both  sites  each  year  (15 at MSKCC  and 10 at CSMC).  Notably,  the completed  
efficacy  and safety  arms  for this study  enrolled  briskly.  Given  that there  are no competing  trials  at MSKCC  or 
CSMC  and given  that this patient  population  is typi[INVESTIGATOR_865943],  we anticipate  an average  accrual  
rate of 1-2 patients  per month  with  accrual  of 17 patients  within  1 year  (approx  10 at MSKCC  and 7 at CSMC).  
Potential  research  subjects  will be identified  by a member  of the patient’s  treatment  team,  the protocol  
investigator,  or research  team  at both  sites.  If the investigator  is a member  of the treatment  team,  s/he  will 
screen  their  patient’s  medical  records  for suitable  research  study  participants  and discuss  the study  and their  
potential  for enrolling  in the research  study.  Potential  subjects  contact[CONTACT_865996]/research  staff  of the study.

The site principal  investigator  (PI) may  also screen  the medical  records  of patients  with  whom  they  do not 
have  a treatment  relationship  for the limited  purpose  of identifying  patients  who  would  be eligible  to enroll  
in the study  and to record  appropriate  contact  [CONTACT_865997].  
 
In most   cases,  the initial  contact  [CONTACT_865998],  investigator  or the research  staff  working  in consultation  with  the treatment  team,  specifically  the 
radiation  oncology,  medical  oncology,  or urgent  care / inpatient  departments.  Potential  patients  may  also be 
identified  by [CONTACT_865999],  who  can identify  breast cancer  patients  who  demonstrate  
new/progressive  CNS disease  on MRI imaging.  
 
During  the initial  conversation  between  the investigator/research  staff  and the patient,  the patient  may  be 
asked  to provide  certain  health  information  that is necessary  to the recruitment  and enrollment  process.  The 
investigator/research  staff  may  also review  portions  of their  medical  records  in order  to further  assess  
eligibility.  They  will use the information  provided  by [CONTACT_17491]/or  medical  record  to confirm  that the 
patient  is eligible  and  to  contact  [CONTACT_46443].  If the patient  turns  out to  be 
ineligible  for the research  study,  the research  staff  will destroy  all information  collected  on the patient  during  
the initial  conversation  and medical  records  review,  except  for any information  that must  be maintained  for 
screening  log purposes.  
 
Once  patients  are identified,  an expedited  consultation  will be facilitated  by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_865944],  in order  to obtain  consent  and assess  for eligibility.  Additionally,  an expedited  radiation  oncology  
evaluation  will be facilitated  to evaluate  for WBRT/SRS.  Radiation  therapy  will then  be administered  as per 
standard  of care,  and tremelimumab/durvalumab  will be administered  at a scheduled  primary  investigator  
appointment  or as an inpatient  if the subject  is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
 
The recruitment  process  outlined  presents  no more  than  minimal  risk to the privacy  of the patients  who  are 
screened  and minimal  PHI will be maintained  as part of a screening  log. For these  reasons,  we seek  a (partial)  
limited  waiver  of authorization  for MSK  patients  for the purposes  of (1) reviewing  medical  records  to identify  
potential  research  subjects  and obtain  information  relevant  to the enrollment  process;  (2) conversing  with  
patients  regarding  possible  enrollment;  (3) handling  of PHI contained  within  those  records  and provided  by 
[CONTACT_28632];  and (4) maintaining  information  in a screening  log of patients  approached  (if 
applicable).  Cedars  Sinai  will obtain  a limited  waiver  from  their  IRB/privacy  board  separately.  
8.[ADDRESS_1208103]  be obtained  prior  to screening  assessments  and before  any 
study -specific  assessments  are initiated.  
 
The following  will be obtained  prior  to enrollment:  
Within  4 weeks  (28 days)  of enrollment:  
• Patients  must   undergo   MRI  of the  brain   as well  as either  contrast -enhanced   PET/CT  or contrast - 
enhanced  CT of the chest,  abdomen,  and pelvis  with  bone  scan  for baseline  assessment  
• For subjects  continuing  trastuzumab  or other  HER2  directed  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  a baseline  TTE or MUGA  must  
be obtained

• A baseline  biopsy  will be performed  (attempted)  for all patients  
Within  2 weeks  (14 days)  of enrollment:  
• Medical  History  
• Height,   body  weight,   ECOG  PS,  and  vital signs  including   blood   pressure,  pulse,   temperature,   and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2844].  
• Physical  exam  will be  completed.   Any changes  in the patients’  mental  or physical   condition   since  
screening  that would  make  him/her  ineligible  for the study  should  be considered  
• Clinical   safety  labs (CBC  with  differential,   CMP,   magnesium,   phosphorus,   INR/PT,   amylase/lipase, 
LDH,  TSH with  reflexive  free T3/free  T4, gamma  glutamyltransferase)  
• A serum  HCG  test will be obtained  for all women  of childbearing  potential  
• Urinalysis  
• A baseline  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  in triplicate,  2-5 minutes  apart  
• A baseline  CA15 -3 and CEA 
• Baseline  peripheral   blood  for immune   monitoring  (for flow cytometric  analysis,  circulating  soluble  
factors,  baseline  serologic  evaluation,  and T-cell repertoire  analysis)  
• Screening  HIV, Hepatitis  B and C studies  
 
9.1 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  PLAN  
 
Tremelimumab  +/- durvalumab  + WBRT/SRS  will be administered  as per the schedule  delineated  in section  
4.0. 
9.1 Concomitant  Steroid  Administration  for symptomatic  CNS disease  
 
Subjects  with  newly -diagnosed  CNS metastases  frequently  benefit  from  steroids  for symptomatic  relief.  
Current  practices  are founded  on level  3 evidence  alone,  with  no randomized  studies  demonstrating  superior  
benefit  of higher  steroid  dose  over  lower  steroid  dose.  (Ryken,  McDermott  et al. 2010)  Therefore,  it is 
reasonable  to treat  patients  with  lower -dose  steroids  at the onset  of radiation  therapy  and titrate  up if 
needed,  in order  to minimize  the immunosuppression  associated  with  steroids.  
 
We defer to the discretion  of the treating  physician;  however,  in an effort  to standardize  steroid  use as much  
as possible,  we offer  the following  recommendations,  which  were  developed  in collaboration  with  radiation  
oncology  and neurology  co-investigators.

to continuously  assess  safety.  (Ivanova,  Qaqish  et al. 2005)  These  criteria were  based  on assumptions  that a 
toxicity  rate of 50% is deemed  unacceptable,  and a rate of 20% is deemed  acceptable.  The boundaries  to stop 
the study  were  given  as follows:  
 
• If [ADDRESS_1208105]  a SAE attributable  to the experimental  intervention,  stop  the 
study.  
• If [ADDRESS_1208106]  a SAE  attributable  to the experimental  intervention,  stop  the 
study.  
• If [ADDRESS_1208107]  a SAE  attributable  to the experimental  intervention,  stop  the 
study.  
 
With  these  parameters,  there  is a 0.94  probability  of crossing  the boundary  if the true toxicity  rate is .50, and 
there  is a 0.14  probability  of .14 probability  of crossing  the boundary  if the true toxicity  rate is .20.”

Approval date: [ADDRESS_1208108] dose  of tremelimumab  
before  additional  HER2 -positive  patients  were  enrolled.  
 
During  the safety  run-in, the following  were  criteria  that would  prompt  discontinuation  of enrollment  of 
subsequent  patients  in the HER2  directed  therapy  safety  arm:  
 
• Any subject  experiencing  symptomatic  CHF requiring  therapeutic  intervention.  The CHF must  be 
attributable  to the experimental  intervention.  The diagnosis  should  be confirmed  by a TTE 
demonstrating  evidence  of heart  failure.  A cardiology  consultation  should  be obtained  in cases  of 
diagnostic  uncertainty.  
• Any subject  with  a cardiac  event  requiring  therapy,  including  myocardial  infarction  or 
myocarditis/pericarditis,  if the cardiac  event  is attributable  to the experimental  intervention.  
• SAE’s  attributable  to the experimental  intervention,  requiring  treatment   discontinuation,  
occurring  in two of three  subjects.  If a serious  adverse  event  (SAE)  attributable  to the 
experimental  intervention  occurs  in 1/[ADDRESS_1208109]  the principal  investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_865945].  
• Closure  of the tremelimumab/RTefficacy arm related  to toxicity  concerns.  
 
If cardiac  toxicity  or additional  SAEs  occur  in patients  following  the safety  run-in, the decision  to continue  
enrollment  of additional  patients  requiring  concurrent  therapy  will be made  by [CONTACT_62674].  If 
enrollment  is discontinued  for safety  concerns,  the decision  of whether  to halt therapy  in previously  enrolled  
patients  will be made  on a case -by-case  basis  by [CONTACT_866000].  
 
Patients  who  tolerate  therapy  are defined  as patients  who  do not discontinue  tremelimumab  for safety - 
related  reasons  within  [ADDRESS_1208110]  out of the three  subjects  enrolled  experience  unacceptable  toxicity;  we will expand  
to enroll  3 more  patients.  If either  0/6 or 1/6 subjects  tolerate  therapy,  the combination  will be deemed  
safe.  Depending  on availability  of resources,  if the combination  is deemed  safe,  we may consider  enrollment  
of additional  subjects  in an expansion  cohort,  to be defined  under  a protocol  amendment.  Similarly,  if the 
combination  is deemed  not  tolerable,  we may consider  enrollment  of additional  subjects  in a dose  de- 
escalation  cohort.  
 
Cardiac  monitoring  with  TTE or MUGA  is recommended  at baseline  and every  12 weeks  (+/- 1 week  ) for 
patients  receiving  concurrent  HER2  directed  therapy  while  on study.  Left  ventricular   dysfunction,  
symptomatic  or not, should  be treated  and followed  according  to standard  medical  practice.

9.4 Expansion  of the HER2+  safety  cohort  
 
As of 3/1/2017,  the safety  arm of patients  with  HER2 -positive  disease  requiring  continuation   of  HER2  
directed  therapy  met the criteria  for treatment  expansion  per the above  enrollment  schema.  As a result,  this 
cohort  of patients   will be expanded   in  order  to  evaluate  efficacy  in a Simon   two-stage  design.  In  this 
expansion,  we will evaluate  the combination  of tremelimumab  (treme),  durvalumab  (durva),  and  HER2  
directed  therapy  plus brain  irradiation  in breast  cancer  patients  with  brain  metastases  (BCBM)  for whom  
post -brain  irradiation  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  is planned.  Subjects  will  receive  either  whole  brain  radiation  
treatment  (WBRT)  or stereotactic  radiosurgery  (SRS),  as  per standard   of care,  with  tremelimumab  
administered  at 75 mg and durvalumab  administered  at 1500  mg every  28 days  for 4 cycles.  After  the 4th 
cycle,  patients  will continue  to receive  1500  mg durvalumab  every  28 days  until  disease  progression  or 
unacceptable  toxicity.  Patients  will continue  to receive  HER2  directed  therapy  at a NCCN  -guideline -endorsed  
dose  and schedule,  as determined  by [CONTACT_093].  Study  design  parameters  and safety  rules  are 
consistent  with  those  that were  used  to study  subjects  not requiring  concurrent  HER2 directed  therapy.  
 
 
9.5 Determining  when  to reinitiate  systemic  therapy  
 
Subjects  will be eligible  to reinitiate  cytotoxic  therapy  when  any of the following  criteria  are met:  
 
• Subject  is experiencing  symptomatic  progression  of disease  as determined  by [CONTACT_866001],  radiation  oncologist,  or neurologist  
• Subject  has confirmed  progression  of disease  by [CONTACT_866002]  12 
• At the discretion  of the investigator  
 
Subjects  requiring  reinitiation  of therapy  before  adjudication  of the primary  endpoint  will be designated  
progressors,  and will be included  in calculating  disease  control  rate,  as per the intention  to treat  principle.

10.0  EVALUATION  DURING  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
Subjects  will require  frequent  monitoring  which  includes  history  and physical  exam,  toxicity  grading,  
laboratory  analyses,  response  assessment  imaging  (including  body  imaging),  and ECG.  Detailed  monitoring  
schedules  are provided  in tables  10.0 -1, 10.0 -2, 10.1 -1, and 10.1 -2.

infusion) : 
- At the beginning  of the infusion  (at 0 minutes)  
- At 30 minutes  during  the infusion  (±10  minutes)  
- At the end of the infusion  (at 60 minutes  ±10 minutes)  
- In the [ADDRESS_1208117] -infusion:  30 and 60 minutes  after  the infusion  (ie, 90 and 120 minutes  from  the start  of the 
infusion)  (±10  minutes).  A 1-hour  observation  period  is required  after  the first infusion.  If no clinically  significant  infusion  reactions  
are observed  during  orafter  the first cycle,  subsequent  infusion  observation  periods  can be at the Investigator’s  discretion  (suggested  
30 minutes  after  each  durvalumab  and tremelimumab  infusion).  
If the infusion  takes  longer  than  60 minutes,  then  blood  pressure  and pulse  measurements  should  follow  the principles  as described  above  
or more  frequentlyif  clinically  indicated  
6 – During  Screening,  ECGs  should  be taken  in triplicate 2-[ADDRESS_1208118]  one time  point  0 to 3 hours  after  the infusion . Baseline  and abnormal  ECGs  should  be performed  in triplicate.  At all other  
times,  single.  After  C1D1,  ECGs  should  be performedas  clinically  indicated.  
7 – To be performedas  clinically  indicated  after  C1D1  
8 – The first  tumor  biopsy  will be taken  (attempted)  at baseline,  within  [ADDRESS_1208119].  An 
optional  tumor  biopsy  will be performed  at times  such  as disease  progression,  if the patient’s  condition  allows  it, or at the time  of radiographic  
response,  at the investigator’s  discretion  and in discussion  with  the patient.

discussion  with  the patient.  
 
 
 
11.1 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
11.1  Overview  of Tremelimumab  Toxicity  Profile  
In the nonclinical  setting,  treatment  of tumor -bearing  mice  with  anti-mouse  CTLA -4 mAb  (9H10)  induced  
antitumor  immunity  and markedly  enhanced  T cell-mediated  killing  of various  mouse  solid  tumors.  Clinical  
trials  of tremelimumab,  and of the related  anti-CTLA -[ADDRESS_1208126]  activity  
(improved  survival)  of these  agents  in melanoma.  Tremelimumab  has also shown  activity  (objective  
responses  and disease  stabilization)  in the malignant  mesothelioma  setting,  with  preliminary  results  
suggesting  that tremelimumab  may  lead   to improved   survival  with  45.5%   of subjects   alive  at  [ADDRESS_1208127]  toxicities  were  reversible  or showed  a trend  towards  reversibility.  
 
The profile  of AEs from  > [ADDRESS_1208128]  been  
observed  in every  organ  system  and are mainly  due to the inflammation  caused  by [CONTACT_629429]’s  
mechanism  of action.  The most  common  AEs involve  skin,  the gastrointestinal  tract,  and endocrine  system,  
and are usually  mild  in nature.  Events  reported  at a frequency  of ≥ 5% and assessed  by [CONTACT_865986]  (listed  in descending  order  of frequency)  were  diarrhea,  rash,  pruritus,  fatigue,  nausea,  
vomiting,  anorexia,  headache,  abdominal  pain,  and colitis.  Infusion -related  AEs were  rare.

11.3  Toxicities/Side  effects  of durvalumab  + tremelimumab  combination  therapy  
Guidelines  for the management  of immune -mediated  reactions,  infusion -related  reactions,  and non-immune - 
mediated  reactions  for durvalumab  monotherapy  and durvalumab  + tremelimumab  are provided  in the 
Dosing  Modification  and Toxicity  Management  Guidelines  in section  20.3.  Patients  should  be thoroughly  
evaluated  and appropriate  efforts  should  be made  to rule out neoplastic,  infectious,  metabolic,   toxin,  or 
other  etiologic  causes  of the imAE.  Serologic,  immunologic,  and histologic  (biopsy)  data,  as appropriate,  
should  be used  to support  an imAE  diagnosis.  In the absence  of a clear alternative  etiology,  events  should  be 
considered  potentially  immune  related.

In addition,  there  are certain  circumstances  in which  durvalumab  and tremelimumab  should  be permanently  
discontinued  (see  the Dosing  Modification  and Toxicity  Management  Guidelines  in section  20.3).  
Following  the first dose  of IP, subsequent  administration  of durvalumab  and tremelimumab  can be modified  
based  on toxicities  observed  as described  in the Dosing  Modification  and Toxicity  Management  Guidelines  in 
section  20.3.  These  guidelines  apply  to AEs considered  causally  related  to durvalumab  monotherapy  and the 
durvalumab  + tremelimumab  regimen  by [CONTACT_486102].  
 
If dosing  must  be delayed  for reasons  other  than  treatment -related  toxicity,  dosing  will resume  as soon  as 
feasible.  Dosing  intervals  of subsequent  cycles  may  be shortened  as clinically  feasible  in order  to gradually  
align  treatment  cycles  with  the schedule  of tumor  efficacy  (RECIST)  assessments.  Subsequent  time  between  2 
consecutive  doses  cannot  be less than  22 days,  based  on the half-lives of durvalumab  and tremelimumab  
(see current  Investigator  Brochures  for durvalumab  and tremelimumab.  
Dose  reductions  are not permitted.  
 
11.3.1  Durvalumab  + tremelimumab  adverse  events  of special  interest  
An adverse  event  of special  interest  (AESI)  is one of scientific  and medical  interest  specific  to understanding  
of the Investigational  Product  and may  require  close  monitoring  and rapid  communication  by [CONTACT_866003].  An AESI may  be serious  or non-serious.  The rapid  reporting  of AESIs  allows  ongoing  
surveillance  of these  events  in order  to characterize  and understand  them  in association  with  the use of this 
investigational  product.  
 
AESIs  for durvalumab  and tremelimumab  include  but are not limited  to events  with  a potential  inflammatory  
or immune -mediated  mechanism  and which  may require  more  frequent  monitoring   and/or  interventions  
such  as steroids,  immunosuppressants  and/or  hormone  replacement  therapy.  These  AESIs  are being  closely  
monitored  in clinical  studies  with  durvalumab  monotherapy  and combination  therapy.  An immune -related  
adverse  event  (irAE)  is defined  as an adverse  event  that is associated  with  drug  exposure  and is consistent  
with  an immune -mediated  mechanism  of action  and where  there  is no clear  alternate  etiology.  Serologic,  
immunologic,  and histologic  (biopsy)  data,  as appropriate,  should  be used  to support  an irAE diagnosis.  
Appropriate  efforts  should  be made  to rule out neoplastic,  infectious,  metabolic,  toxin,  or other  etiologic  
causes  of the irAE.  
 
If the Investigator  has any questions  in regards  to an adverse  event  (AE) being  an irAE,  the  Investigator  
should  promptly  contact  [CONTACT_33139].  
 
AESIs  observed  with  durvalumab  and tremelimumab  include:  
• Diarrhea/Colitis  
• Pneumonitis/ILD  
• ALT/AST  increases  / hepatitis  / hepatotoxicity  
• Neuropathy   /  neuromuscular   toxicity   (i.e.  events   of  encephalitis,   peripheral   motor   and  sensory  
neuropathies,  Guillain -Barré,  and myasthenia  gravis)

• Endocrinopathy  (i.e. events  of hypophysitis,  adrenal  insufficiency,  diabetes  insipi[INVESTIGATOR_27562],  type  I diabetes  
mellitus,  and hyper - and hypothyroidism)  
• Rash/Dermatitis  
• Nephritis/Blood  creatinine  increases  
• Pancreatitis   (or labs suggestive  of pancreatitis  - increased  serum  lipase  , increased  serum  amylase)  
• Cardiac  disorders  (myocarditis)  
• Otherinflammatory responses  that are rare with  a potential  immune-mediated aetiology  include,  but 
are not limited  to, myocarditis,  pericarditis,  and uveitis.  
 
• In addition,  infusion  related   reactions  and hypersensitivity,   anaphylactic  reactions  with  a different  
underlying  pharmacological  etiology  are also considered  AESIs  
 
Further  information  on these  risks  (e.g.  presenting  symptoms)  can be found  in the current  version  of the 
durvalumab  and tremelimumab  Investigator  Brochure.  For durvalumab  and tremelimumab,  AESIs  will 
comprise  the following:  
 
Pneumonitis  
AEs of pneumonitis  are also of interest  for [COMPANY_008],  as pneumonitis  has been  observed  with  use of anti- 
PD-1 mAbs  (but not with  anti-PD-L1 mAbs).  Initial  work -up should  include  a high-resolution  CT scan,  ruling  
out infection,  and pulse  oximetry.  Pulmonary  consultation  is highly  recommended.  Gui delines  for the 
management  of patients  with  immune -related  AEs (irAEs)  including  pneumonitis  are provided  in Table  20.3.  
 
Infusion  reactions  
AEs of infusion  reactions  (also  termed  infusion -related  reactions)  are of special  interest  to [COMPANY_008]  and 
are defined,  for the purpose  of this protocol,  as all AEs occurring  from  the start  of IP infusion  up to 48 hours  
after  the infusion  start  time.  For all infusion  reactions,  SAEs  should  be reported  to [COMPANY_008]  Patient  safety  
as described  in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  
 
Hypersensitivity  reactions  
Hypersensitivity  reactions  as well as infusion -related  reactions  have  been  reported  with  anti-PD-L1 and anti- 
PD-1 therapy  (Error!  Reference  source  not found. ). As with  the administration  of any foreign  protein  and/or  
other  biologic  agents,  reactions  following  the infusion  of mAbs  can be caused  by [CONTACT_498277],  
including  acute  anaphylactic  (IgE-mediated)  and anaphylactoid  reactions  against  the mAbs  and serum  
sickness.  Acute  allergic  reactions  may  occur,  may  be severe,  and may   result  in  death.   Acute   allergic  
reactions  may  include   hypotension,  dyspnea,  cyanosis,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_33078],  urticaria,  pruritus,  angioedema,  
hypotonia,  arthralgia,  bronchospasm,  wheeze,  cough,  dizziness,  fatigue,  headache,  hypertension,  myalgia,  
vomiting,  and unresponsiveness.  Guidelines  for the management  of patients  with  hypersensitivity  (including  
anaphylactic  reaction)  and infusion -related  reactions  are provided  in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  
 
Hepatic  function  abnormalities  (hepatotoxicity)  
Hepatic  function  abnormality  is defined  as any increase  in ALT or AST to greater than  3 × ULN and concurrent  
increase  in total  bilirubin  to be greater  than  2 × ULN.   Concurrent  findings  are those  that derive  from  a single

blood  draw  or from  separate  blood  draws  taken  within  8 days  of each  other.  Follow -up investigations  and 
inquiries  will be initiated  promptly  by [CONTACT_866004]/or  whether  there  is objective  evidence  that clearly  supports  causation  by a disease  (eg, 
cholelithiasis  and bile duct  obstruction  with  distended  gallbladder)  or an agent  other  than  the IP. Guidelines  
for management  of patients  with  hepatic  function  abnormality  are provided  in Table  20.3.  
 
Gastrointestinal  disorders  
Diarrhea/colitis  is the most  commonly  observed  treatment  emergent  SAE when  tremelimumab  is used  as 
monotherapy.  In rare cases,  colon  perforation  may occur  that requires  surgery  (colectomy)  or can lead  to a 
fatal  outcome  if not  properly  managed.  Guidelines  on management  of diarrhea  and colitis   in  patients  
receiving  tremelimumab  are provided  in Table  20.3.  
Endocrine  disorders  
Immune -mediated  endocrinopathies  include  hypophysitis,  adrenal  insufficiency,  and hyper - and 
hypothyroidism.  Guidelines  for the management  of patients  with  immune -mediated  endocrine  events  are 
provided  in Table  20.3.  
 
Pancreatic  disorders  
Immune -mediated  pancreatitis  includes  autoimmune  pancreatitis,  and lipase  and amylase   elevation.  
Guidelines  for  the management  of patients  with  immune -mediated  pancreatic  disorders  are provided  in 
Table  20.3.  
 
Neurotoxicity  
Immune -mediated  nervous  system  events  include  encephalitis,  peripheral  motor  and sensory  neuropathies,  
Guillain -Barré,  and myasthenia  gravis.  Guidelines  for the management  of patients  with  immune -mediated  
neurotoxic  events  are provided  in Table  20.3.  
 
Nephritis  
 
Consult  with  nephrologist.  Monitor  for signs  and symptoms  that may be related  to changes  in renal  function  
(e.g.  routine  urinalysis,  elevated  serum  BUN  and creatinine,  decreased  creatinine  clearance,  electrolyte  
imbalance,  decrease  in urine  output,  proteinuria,  etc).  Patients  should  be thoroughly  evaluated  to rule out 
any alternative  etiology  (e.g.,  disease  progression,  infections  etc.)  
Steroids  should  be considered  in the absence  of clear  alternative  etiology  even  for low grade  events  (Grade  
2) , in order  to prevent  potential  progression  to higher  grade  event.  Guidelines  for the management  of 
patients  with  immune -mediated  neurotoxic  events  are provided  in Table  20.3.

of an alternate  etiology  (eg, infection  or PD), an immune -related  etiology  should  be considered  for signs  or 
symptoms  of enterocolitis,  dermatitis,  pneumonitis,  hepatitis,  and endocrinopathy.  In addition  to the dose  
modification  guidelines  provided  in Table  20.3,  it is recommended  that irAEs  are managed  according  to the 
general  treatment  guidelines  outlined  for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  (Error!  Reference  source  not found. ). These  guidelines  
recommend  the following:  
 
• Patients  should  be evaluated  to identify  any alternative  etiology.  
 
• In the absence  of a clear alternative  etiology,  all events  of an inflammatory  nature  
should  be considered  immune  related.  
 
• Symptomatic  and topi[INVESTIGATOR_486049]-grade events.  
 
• Systemic  corticosteroids  should  be considered  for a persistent  low-grade  event  or 
for a severe  event.  
 
• More     potent    immunosuppressives    should    be   considered    for   events    not 
responding  to systemic  steroids  (eg, infliximab  or mycophenolate).  
 
If the Investigator  has any questions  in regards  to an AE being  an irAE,  the Investigator  should  immediately

Approval date: [ADDRESS_1208136]  will be obtained  
when  possible  to determine  if there  was any delayed  tremelimumab  +/- durvalumab  activity  unless  consent  
is withdrawn  or the subject  is lost to follow -up or starts  receiving  another  anticancer  therapy.  Additional  
scans  can also be done  at any time  based  on investigator  discretion.  
 
An initial increase in tumor  burden or the appearance of new lesions could precede immunotherapy-induced 
tumor  regression  (Wolchok,  Hoos  et al. 2009).  According  to this model  of response,  subjects  initially  assessed  
as PD by [CONTACT_393]1.[ADDRESS_1208137]  4 weeks  later.  The following  
criteria  will be used  to determine  if study  treatment  is continued:  
 
• If the tumor  burden  at the confirmatory  scan  is more  than  20% larger  than  the tumor  burden  at the 
initial  PD scan,  the subject  will be considered  to have  confirmed  PD and will be discontinued  from  
study  treatment  
• If the tumor  burden  at the confirmatory  scan  is within  20% of the tumor  burden  at the initial  PD scan,  
the subject  will be considered  to have  SD and will continue  treatment  until  the next  scheduled  scan  3 
months  after  the initial  PD. Any subsequent  scheduled  tumor  assessment  visit showing  that  the 
tumor  burden  is more  than  20% larger  than  the tumor  burden  at the initial  PD scan  will be 
considered  as confirmed  PD, and the subject  will be discontinued  from  study  treatment  
• In subjects  with  new  lesions  in the setting  of overall  response,  the decision  to continue  treatment  will 
be discussed  on a case  by [CONTACT_866005]  [INVESTIGATOR_279539]  
• It is important  to maintain  the schedule  of assessments  every  [ADDRESS_1208138]  criteria  v1.1  (Eisenhauer,  Therasse  et al. 2009).  To  assess  
objective  response  or future  progression,  it is necessary  to estimate  the overall  tumor  burden  at baseline  and 
use this as a comparator for sub sequent measurements. Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_866006]  (10mm  by [CONTACT_3610]  [CT scan  slice thickness  no greater than  5mm],  10mm  caliper  
measurement  by [CONTACT_40133],  or 20mm  by [CONTACT_13190]  x-ray).  A lymph  node  must  be at least  15mm  in short  axis 
when  measured  by [CONTACT_3610].  When  more  than  one measurable  lesion  is present  at baseline,  all lesions  up to a 
maximum  of 5 lesions  total  (and  a maximum  of 2 lesions  per organ)  representative  of all involved  organs  
should  be identified  as target  lesions  and will be recorded  and measured  at baseline.  Remaining  lesions  will 
be considered  non-target  lesions.  For full details  of the RECIST1.1  criteria,  refer  to the Eisenhauer  
reference.(Eisenhauer,  Therasse  et al. 2009)  
The RECIST1.1  criteria  response  definitions  are summarized  as follows:  
 
• Complete  response:  Disappearance  of all target  lesions.  Any pathological  lymph   nodes   (whether  
target  or non-target)  must  have  reduction  in short  axis to <10mm.  
• Partial  response:  At least  a 30% decrease  in the sum of diameters  of target  lesions,  taking  as 
reference  the baseline  sum diameters.  
• Progressive  disease:   At least  a 20% increase  in the sum  of diameters  of target  lesions,  taking  as 
reference  the smallest  sum on study  (this includes  the baseline  sum if that is the smallest  on study).  
In addition  to the relative  increase  of 20%,  the sum  must  also demonstrate  an absolute  increase  of at 
least  5mm.

12.2.2  CNS  Response  Determination  
 
CNS response  will not be included  in the primary  endpoint.  Investigators  may  plan  more  frequent  imaging  as 
clinically  indicated,  including  MRI imaging.  
 
Subjects  who  experience  systemic  disease  control  and CNS progression  may  continue  receiving  study  
medication  at the discretion  of the investigator.  These  subjects  may  receive  additional  brain -directed  SRS if 
clinically  warranted.  
 
Table  [IP_ADDRESS]:  RANO  Criteria  for CNS response  (Wen,  Macdonald  et al. 2010)  
Response  Criteria  
Complete  
Response  Requires  all of the following:  complete  disappearance  of all enhancing  measurable  and 
non measurable  disease  sustained  for at least  4 weeks;  no new  lesions;  stable  or 
improved  non enhancing  (T2/FLAIR)  lesions;  patients  must  be off corticosteroids  (or on 
physiologic  replacement  doses  only);  and stable  or improved  clinically.  Note:  Patients  
with  non measurable  disease  only  cannot  have  a complete  response;  the best   
response  possible  is stable  disease.  
Partial  
Response  Requires  all of the following:  ≥50%  decrease  compared  with  baseline  in the sum of 
products  of perpendicular  diameters  of all measurable  enhancing  lesions  sustained  for 
at least  4 weeks;  no progression  of non measurable  disease;  no new lesions;  stable  or 
improved  non enhancing  (T2/FLAIR)  lesions  on same  or lower  dose  of corticosteroids  
compared  with  baseline  scan;  the corticosteroid  dose  at the time  of the scan  
evaluation  should  be no greater  than  the dose  at time  of baseline  scan;  and stable  or 
improved  clinically.  Note:  Patients  with  non measurable  disease  only cannot  have  a 
partial  response;  the best  response  possible  is stable  disease.  
Stable  Disease  Requires  all of the following:  does  not qualify  for complete  response,  partial  response,  
or progression;  stable  non enhancing  (T2/FLAIR)  lesions  on same  or lower  dose  of 
corticosteroids  compared  with  baseline  scan.  In the event  that the corticosteroid  dose  
was increased  for new  symptoms  and signs  without  confirmation  of disease  
progression  on neuroimaging,  and subsequent  follow -up imaging  shows  that this 
increase  in corticosteroids  was required  because  of disease  progression,  the last scan  
considered  to show  stable  disease  will be the scan  obtained  when  the corticosteroid  
dose  was equivalent  to the baseline  dose.  
Progression  Defined  by [CONTACT_39132]:  ≥25%  increase  in sum of the products  of perpendicular  
diameters  of enhancing  lesions  compared  with  the smallest  tumor  measurement  
obtained  either  at baseline  (if no decrease)  or best  response,  on stable  or increasing  
doses  of corticosteroids;  significant  increase  in T2/FLAIR  non enhancing  lesion  on 
stable  or increasing  doses  of corticosteroids  compared  with  baseline  scan  or best  
response  after  initiation  of therapy  not caused  by [CONTACT_866009]  (e.g.,  radiation  
therapy,  demyelination,  ischemic  injury,  infection,  seizures,  postoperative  changes,  or 
other  treatment  effects);  any new  lesion;  clear  clinical  deterioration  not attributable  to 
other  causes  apart  from  the tumor  (e.g.,  seizures,  medication  adverse  effects,  
complications  of therapy,  cerebrovascular  events,  infection,  and so on) or changes  in 
corticosteroid  dose;  failure  to return  for evaluation  as a result  of death  or  
deteriorating  condition;  or clear  progression  of non measurable  disease.

the IMF (currently  located  in the Zuckerman  building).  The following  exploratory  endpoints  are proposed:  
 
1) To evaluate  the effect  of tremelimumab  +/- durvalumab  + RT on: lymphocyte  phenotype  and 
serum  cytokines,  disease  related  biomarkers,  and humoral  and cellular  responses  to tumor  
antigens  and recall  non-tumor  antigens;  
 
2) To evaluate  serological  and cellular  immune  correlates  of toxicity  and/or  clinical  activity;  
 
To this end,  the specimens  to be collected  for IMF evaluation  include  research  blood  samples  at time  points  
as delineated  in table  10.1 -1 and 10.1 -2. For each  blood  draw,  4 CPT tubes  will be collected  for: 
• Flow  cytometric  analysis:  
o T-cells:  activation  and memory  markers  
o Dendritic  cells:  activation  and maturation  markers  and markers  of inhibitor/tolerogenic  DCs 
• Intracellular  cytokine  assay  (ICCA)  and ELISPOT:  to detect  responses  to specific  tumor  antigens  
(forexample, HER2  or MUC1)  which  are expressed  in breast  cancers  
• Serum  cytokines:  Soluble  factors,  such  as interferon  gamma,  are detectable  at increased  levels  
following  administration  of anti-CTLA -[ADDRESS_1208140]  cancer  patients  (Page,  Yuan  et 
al. 2014),  and may  serve  as a pharmacodynamic  marker  of immune  activation  and biomarker  of 
response  
• Serology  assays:  Antibody  levels  to cancer  testis  antigens  and breast  tumor  specific  antigens  will 
be assessed  by [CONTACT_866010] -linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA).  
• DNA  deep  sequencing  T-cell repertoire  analysis:  Maintenance  of peripheral  T-cell clonal  diversity

12.3.2  Imaging  
In subjects  receiving  PET/CT,  radiographic  response  by [CONTACT_866011].  This comparison  will help  to evaluate  whether  metabolic  uptake  might  be useful  in distinguishing  clinical  
response  to immunotherapy  in breast  cancer  patients,  who  frequently  are evaluated  off-protocol   with  
PET/CT.  
 
PET/CT  is commonly  used  as a standard -of-care modality  for evaluating  response  to palliative  therapy  in 
metastatic  breast  cancer  off-study.  However,  on study,  response  to treatments   is often  measured  
anatomically  using  the Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  (RECIST)  guidelines  version  1.1. However,  
there  are limitations  in using  anatomic response  criteria  alone,  particularly  when  evaluating  bone  metastases  
without  an extra -osseous  component,  which  is common  in breast  cancer  patients.  Furthermore,  while  RECIST  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 15 -038 A(7)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_1208141]  (PET  response  criteria  in solid  tumors)  is a commonly  proposed  method  for measuring  treatment  
response  based  on metabolic  response  criteria  with  PET.  A limitation  of PERCIST  is that it only  takes  into 
account  the single  hottest  lesion  and it relies  upon  SUV peak  measurements,  which  are not easily  
reproducible  in lesions  with  low FDG-avidity,  as are often  found   in breast  cancer.  Since  there  are no 
standardized  methods  for quantifying  FD G-tracer  avidity  in individual  tumor  lesions,  we will use a 
modification  of PERCIST  criteria  called  “PET  Response  Criteria”  (PRC)  that is currently  being  utilized  in other  
cancer  protocols  at MSK  requiring  metabolic  assessment.  In brief,  up to 5 FDG -avid  target  lesions  will be 
selected,  SUVmax measured   for each  lesion,  and the sum of all lesions  (Sum  SUVmax)  recorded.  On 
subsequent  studies,  the same  target  lesions  will be measured  and Sum  SUVmax  recorded.  Lesions  where  
SUVmax  is no greater  than  background  will be recorded  as zero.  Response  or progression  will be graded  as 
follows:  
 
• Complete  Response:  All lesions  no greater  than  background  SUVmax  
• Partial  Response:  Sum  SUVmax  decreased  by >30%  but still greater  than  background  SUVmax  
• Stable  Disease:  Lesions  that do not fit criteria  for response  or progression  
• Progressive  Disease:  Sum  SUVmax increased  by > 30% or development  of a new  lesion  
 
Thus,  PET will be performed  in conjunction  with  dedicated  CT in this study  in order  to explore  similarities  and 
differences  in the information  conferred,  ultimately  in order  to inform  future  studies.

attempted  at baseline,  within  28 days  prior  to starting  treatment.  A second,  optional,  tumor  biopsy  will be 
performed  at times  such  as disease  progression,  prior  to starting  a new systemic  cancer  treatment  and if the 
patient’s  condition  allows  it, or at the time  of radiographic  response,  at the investigator’s  discretion  and in 
discussion  with  the patient.  For each  core needle  biopsy,  an attempt  should  be made  to collect  at least 3 core  
needle  samples;  however,  if it is not medically  feasible  to collect  [ADDRESS_1208143]  one dose  of tremelimumab  +/- durvalumab  will be evaluable  for toxicity  and 
will be included  in the intent  to treat  analysis.

13.1 CRITERIA  FOR  REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
Permanent  discontinuation  of the drug:  An individual  subject  will not receive  any further  
Tremelimumab/durvalumab  if any of the following  occur  in the subject  in question:  
a) Withdrawal  of consent  from  further  treatment  with  investigational  product  
b) Lost to follow -up 
c) An AE that,  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1072],  contraindicates  further  dosing  
d) Adverse   event   related   to  Tremelimumab/durvalumab   that  met  criteria   for  discontinuation   as 
defined  in Section  11 
e) Subject  who  skips  2 consecutive  doses  because  of ongoing  treatment -related  toxicity;  
f) Subject  who  has received  any amount  of infliximab  or other  tumor  necrosis  factor  alpha  (TNF-α) 
inhibitor.  
g) Subject  is determined  to have  met one or more  of the exclusion  criteria  or failed  to meet  all of 
the inclusion  criteria  for study  participation  at study  entry  and continuing  investigational  therapy  
might  constitute  a safety  risk 
h) Pregnancy  or intent  to become  pregnant  
i) Subject  noncompliance  that,  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1072],  warrants  withdrawal;  e.g.,  refusal  
to adhere  to scheduled  visits  
j) Initiation  of alternative  anticancer  therapy  including  another  investigational  agent  
k) Confirmation  of progressive  disease  and investigator  determination  that the patient  is no longer  
benefitting  from  treatment  
l) Grade  ≥ [ADDRESS_1208144],  regardless  of the 
reason  (withdrawal  of consent,  due to an AE, other),  will be identified  as having  permanently  discontinued  
treatment.  Subjects  who  permanently  discontinue  treatment  may  either  be considered  to have  completed  
the study  or not to have  completed  the study.  
 
Subjects,  who  are permanently  discontinued  because  of toxicity  and in the absence  of disease  progression,  
will be asked  to come  in for every  protocol -specified  visit and will follow  all protocol  procedures  with  the 
exception  of dosing.  For subjects  refusing  to return  to the site, they  should  be contact[CONTACT_866012].  
 
Subjects  who  are permanently  discontinued  from  receiving  investigational  product  will  be  followed   for 
safety,  including  the collection  of any protocol -specified  blood,  or urine  specimens,  as specified  in section  10, 
unless  consent  is withdrawn  or the subject  is lost to follow -up or enrolled  in another  clinical  study.  Subjects  
who  decline  to return  to the site forevaluations will be offered  follow -up by [CONTACT_866013].

Withdrawal  of consent:  If consent  is withdrawn,  the subject  will not receive  any further  investigational  
product  or further  study  observation.  Note  that the subject  may  need  to undergo  additional  tests  or tapering  
of treatment  to withdraw  safely.  
 
Withdrawal  of treatment:  at any time  the subject  may  withdrawal  the consent  to further  treatment,  without  
withdrawing  the consent  to the study;  in this case  the subject  will not receive  any further  investigational  
product,  but he/she  will continue  to follow  the study  procedures.  
 
Lost to follow -up: Subjects  will be considered  lost to follow -up only if no contact  [CONTACT_866014]’s  status  at 
that time.  
 
Note:  For subjects  refusing  to continue  participation  in the study,  they  should  be documented  as “withdrawal  
of consent”  rather  than  “lost  to follow -up.”  Investigators  should  document  attempts  to re-establish contact  
[CONTACT_866015].  If contact  [CONTACT_4490]  a missing  subject  is re-established,  the 
subject  should  not  be considered  lost  to follow -up and any evaluations  should  resume  according  to the 
protocol.  
13.1 Premature  Patient  Withdrawal 
 
A patient  may  withdraw  from  the study  at any time  for any reason without  prejudice  to his/her  future  
medical  care by [CONTACT_866016]. Likewise,  the Investigator  has the right  to  withdraw  
patients  from  the study.  Should  a patient  (or a patient’s  legally  authorized  representative)  decide  to 
withdraw,  all efforts  will be made  to complete  the required  study  procedures  and report  the treatment  
observations  as thoroughly  as possible.  
 
A complete  final  evaluation  should  be made  at the time  of the patient’s  withdrawal,  the  Study   Status  
Outcome  form  in the case report  form  should  be completed  with  an explanation  of why  the patient  is 
withdrawing,  and an attempt  should  be made  to perform  a follow -up evaluation.  
 
Reasons  for a premature  withdrawal  of a patient  include,  but are not limited  to, the following:  
 
• Significant  protocol  violation  or noncompliance  on the part of the patient  or Investigator  
• Refusal  of the patient  to continue  treatment  or observations  
• Best  medical  interest  of the patient  (at the discretion  of the Investigator)  
• Unrelated  medical  illness  or complication  
• Lost to follow -up

14.2 Sample  Size  Determination  
 
The overarching  goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_865951],  and to confirm  safety  of concurrent  HER2  directed  therapy  + 
tremelimumab  at the previously -defined  recommended  doses  for these  two agents.  The  total   maximum  
accrual  will be 23 patients,  17 in the efficacy  cohort  and 6 in the HER2  directed  therapy  co-administration  
safety  cohort.  If preliminary  efficacy  is ascertained,  this will prompt  a multi -institutional  randomized  trial 
which  will more  definitively  evaluate  efficacy.  
 
14.2.1  Primary  Endpoint:  Efficacy  Cohort  
Because  clinically  there  can be a discord  between  the response  of brain  metastases  and non-CNS metastases  
to any given  therapy,  because  there  are no uniformly  accepted  criteria  for evaluating  brain  metastases  
responses  to immunotherapy,  and because  criteria  for evaluating  CNS and  non-CNS  responses  differ,  we 
have  chosen  to evaluate  non-CNS disease  control  rate as the primary  endpoint.  
 
In the efficacy  cohort,  a Simon  two-stage  design  will test whether  tremelimumab  and brain  irradiation  yields  
a 12 week  non-CNS disease  control  rate (CR + PR + SD per RECIST  1.1) that is of clinical  interest.  This design  
limits  the expected  number  of subjects  who  receive  treatment  when  the true [ADDRESS_1208146] the null hypothesis  that the true non-CNS disease  control  rate is ≤ 5% versus  the 
alternative  hypothesis  that the true non-CNS disease  control  rate is > 25%.  The 2-stage  testing  will target  a 
Type  I error  rate of 5 % and will have  80 % power  to reject  the null hypothesis  if the true non-CNS disease  
control  rate is 25%.  
 
The Simon  design  requires  [ADDRESS_1208147]  if, at the end of the second  stage,  there  are ≥ [ADDRESS_1208148] dose  of 
tremelimumab  will be replaced,  and will not be included  in analysis,  but will be documented  and reported  
with  the results  of the study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Ration  ale of Altern  ative  Hypothesis  
 
Tremelimumab  + RT  is a novel  treatment  modality —unique  from  cytotoxic   chemotherapy —which  could  
potentially  provide  clinical  benefit  in a heavily  pre-treated patients  for whom  relatively  few effective  
cytotoxic  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_865907].  Another  potential  advantage  of tremelimumab/RT  is that patients  may benefit  
from  a “respi[INVESTIGATOR_865952]”  during  which  they  may  recover  from  the cumulative  toxicities  of cytotoxic  
chemotherapy,  while  still receiving  active  therapy.  Because  of these  unique  attributes,  and because  of the 
durability  of clinical  benefit  observed  in melanoma  patients  treated  with  anti -CTLA -4, we have  selected  an 
alternative  hypothesis  of 25% non-CNS disease  control  rate,  which  we believe  would  be of sufficient  clinical  
value  to consider  further  study.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Ration  ale of Null  Hypothesis  
 
By [CONTACT_866017],  women  are eligible  for study  participation  if, as determined  by [CONTACT_093],  they  
experienced  a non-CNS progression  of disease  for which  a change  is  systemic   therapy   cytotoxic  
chemotherapy  is planned   after  brain  irradiation.  The null hypothesis,  therefore,  is based  upon   the 
expectation  of a 12-week  non-CNS disease  control  rate of 5% or less  off systemic  therapy.  
 
In light  of the potential  intangible  benefits  of a “chemotherapy  holiday,”  the 5% null hypothesis  establishes  a 
conservative  lower  threshold  by [CONTACT_866018].  In other  words,  
should  this strategy  confer  a 25% non-CNS disease  control  rate,  a rate which  is comparable  to the expected  
benefits  of chemotherapy  in this setting,  and also permit  a “chemotherapy  holiday,”  then  the strategy  would  
warrant  further  study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy  Cohort  Continuous  Safety  Assessment  
In the tremelimumab  efficacy  arm,  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_241491]  (based  on a repeated  significance  testing  method)  will be 
employed  to continuously  assess  safety.  (Ivanova,  Qaqish  et al. 2005)  These  criteria  were  based  on 
assumptions  that a toxicity  rate of 50% is deemed  unacceptable,  and a rate of 20% is deemed  acceptable.  
The boundaries  to stop  the study  are given  as follows:  
 
• If [ADDRESS_1208149]  a SAE attributable  to the experimental  intervention,  stop  the 
study.  
• If [ADDRESS_1208150]  a SAE  attributable  to the experimental  intervention,  stop  the 
study.  
• If [ADDRESS_1208151]  a SAE  attributable  to the experimental  intervention,  stop  the 
study.  
With  these  parameters,  there  is a 0.94 probability  of crossing  the boundary  if the true toxicity  rate is .50, and 
there  is a 0.14 probability  of .14 probability  of crossing  the boundary  if the true toxicity  rate is .20.”  
14.1.2  HER2  directed  therapy  Co-administration  Safety  cohort  
In the HER2  directed  therapy  co-administration  cohort,  the safety  of HER2  directed  therapy  and 
tremelimumab  co-administration  will be evaluated  in a minimum  of 3 subjects.  The sample  sizes  and dose  
expansion  algorithm  is based  upon  a classical  3+3 dose  escalation  design,  whereby  [CONTACT_866019] -limiting  toxicity  occurs  in ≤1/[ADDRESS_1208152] 6 weeks  of therapy.  
 
If the combination  of HER2  directed  therapy  + tremelimumab  + RT is deemed  tolerable,  a dose  expansion  
cohort  will be considered,  to further  evaluate  overall  safety  and toxicity  profile  of the combination.   This 
cohort  will accrue  following  a protocol  amendment.  Similarly,  if time  permits  and the treatment  is deemed  
too toxic,  a dose  de-escalation  cohort  may  be considered  under  a separately  filed  protocol  amendment.  
 
This cohort  is not statistically   powered  to evaluate  for preliminary  efficacy  of the combination  of 
tremelimumab  + HER2  directed  therapy  + RT, however  if data  permit,  we will conduct  preliminary  analyses  to 
evaluate  for differential  clinical  activity  across  the two cohorts.

In the event  that accrual  of the efficacy  arm completes  prior  to completion  of the HER2  directed  therapy  
safety  arm,  the primary  endpoint  may  be reported  independently  of the secondary  and exploratory  
endpoints.  
 
14.1.3  The  HER2+  Protocol  Expansion  
 
As of 3/1/17,  the 12 week  disease  control  rate was 2/20  (10%)  in the efficacy  arm and 2/6 (33%)  in the safety  
arm.  One patient  treated  with  concurrent  HER2 -directed  therapy  had a 57% partial  response  by [CONTACT_393]  v1.[ADDRESS_1208153]  common  treatment  related  AEs  were   diarrhea   (12.9%),  
fatigue  (9.7%),  and colitis  (6.5%).  Thus,  an expansion  of the HER2  arm is planned  in a parallel  Simon  two- 
stage  design  to evaluate  efficacy  of brain  RT with  checkpoint  blockade  and  concurrent   HER2 -directed  
therapy.  In this expansion,  we will evaluate  the combination  of tremelimumab  (treme),  durvalumab  (durva),  
and HER2  directed  therapy  plus brain  irradiation  in breast  cancer  patients  with  brain  me tastases  (BCBM)  for 
whom  post -brain  irradiation  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  is planned.  Subjects  will receive  either  whole  brain  
radiation  treatment  (WBRT)  or stereotactic  radiosurgery  (SRS),  as per standard  of care,  with  tremelimumab  
administered  at 75 mg and durvalumab  administered  at 1500  mg every  28 days  for 4 cycles.  After  the 4th 
cycle,  patients  will continue  to receive  1500  mg durvalumab  every  28 days  until  disease  progression  or 
unacceptable  toxicity.  Patients  will continue  to receive  HER2  directed  therapy  at a NCCN -guideline -endorsed  
dose  and schedule,  as determined  by [CONTACT_093].     Study  design  parameters  and safety  rules  are similar  
to those  that were  used  to the previously  enrolled  study  subjects  who  did not require  concurrent  HER2  
directed  therapy.  
 
 
 
14.2 Subjects  for analysis  
 
• All Enrolled  Subjects:  All subjects  who  signed  an informed  consent  form  and were  registered  into the 
IVRS.  
• All Treated  Subjects:  All subjects  who  received  at least  one dose  of any study  medication.  
• Biomarker  Subjects:  All assigned  subjects  with  available  biomarker  data.  
 
14.3 Definitions  of endpoints  
 
14.3.1  Primary  endpoint  
The primary  endpoint   will be assessed  by [CONTACT_393]1.1  criteria  as described  in section  12.1.  The  non-CNS 
disease  control  rate (CR+PR+SD)  at 12 weeks  will be calculated  with  a 95% confidence  interval.  Subjects  who  
clinically  progress  or die prior  to the 12 week  assessment  will be included  in the analysis  as failures.  
14.3.2  Secondary  endpoints  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Immune -related  respons  e 
Objective  response  (CR + PR), disease  control  (CR + PR + SD), non-CNS objective  response,  and non-CNS 
disease  control  rates  will be evaluated  at 12 weeks  utilizing  the immune-related response  criteria.  (Wolchok,

Hoos  et al. 2009)  The irRC calls  for confirmation  of radiographic  progression  with  a repeat  scan  4 weeks  after  
initial  scan,  and allows  for the presence  of new  lesions  when  evaluating  for possible  response.  These  rates  
will be calculated  with  a 95% confidence  interval.  
 
Immune -related  progression  free survival  (irPFS)  will be defined  as the time  from  the first dose  of 
tremelimumab  until  death  or progressive  disease,  as measured  by [CONTACT_19104].  Non -CNS irPFS  will also be measured.  
PFS endpoints  will be evaluated  using  Kaplan -Meier  methods,  and if necessary,  using  a cumulative  risk 
approach  that adjusts  for competing  risks.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Other  response  parameters  using  RECIST1.1  
In addition  to the primary  endpoint,  RECIST1.1  will be used  to assess  the above  listed  response  parameters  
(see section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CNS  respons  e 
CNS-only  responses  will be assessed  using  the RANO  criteria  as detailed  in section  12.2.2.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overall  Survival  
Overall  survival  is defined  as the time  from  first dose  of tremelimumab  until  death  from  any cause.  This will 
be evaluated  using  Kaplan -Meier  methods.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Exploratory  Endpoints  
All exploratory  endpoints  will be analyzed  descriptively  and graphically.  Any statistical  test will be performed  
using  nonparametric  methods  and interpreted  with  caution.

16.0  DATA MANAGEMENT  ISSUES  
 
A MSKCC  Research  Study  Assistant  (RSA)  will be assigned  to the study.  The responsibilities  of the RSA include  
project  compliance,  data  collection,  abstraction  and entry,  data  reporting,  regulatory  monitoring,  problem  
resolution  and prioritization,  and coordination  of the activities  of the study  team.  
 
The Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  will be used  for data  collection.  The data  will be report  to the MSKCC  
(IRB) and the drug manufacturer(MedImmu ne) as appropriate. 
 
16.1 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals,  protocol  compliance,  eligibility  
verification,  informed  consent  procedure,  data  accuracy,  and completeness  of registration  data.   Routine  
data  quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data  and inconsistencies.   Accrual  rates  and extent  
and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will be monitored  periodically  throughout  the study  period  and 
potential  problems  will be brought  to the attention  of the study  team  for discussion  and action.  
 
Random -sample  data  quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_2362],  at a 
minimum  of two times  per year,  more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
16.2 Data  and  Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  were  approved  by 
[CONTACT_40137]  2001.   The plans  address  the new policies  set forth  by [CONTACT_633147]  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute  for Data  and Safety  Monitoring of Clinical  
Trials”  which  can be found  at: http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/learningabout/patientsafety/dsm  -  
guidelines/page1 .  The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were  established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_232985].   The MSKCC  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Plans can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at:  
http://smskpsps9/dept/ocr/OCR%20Website%20Documents/Clinical%20Research%20Quality%2 0Assurance  
%20(CRQA)/MSKCC%20Data%20and%20Safety%20Monitoring%20Plan.pdf    . 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_211148],  safety  and quality.  
There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  monitoring,  compliance  and 
data  verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff  education  on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  
procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two institutional  committees  that are responsible  for 
monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials  programs.   The committees:  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for 
Phase  III clinical  trials,  report  to the Center’s  Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
 
 
 
 
17.0  PROTECTION  OF HUMAN  SUB JECTS  
 
Prior  to the enrollment  of each  patient,  the risks,  benefits  and objectives  of the study  will be reviewed  with  
the participant,  including  a discussion  of the possible  toxicities  and side effects.  Every  effort  will be made  to 
keep  study  records  private.  Neither  the patient's  name  [CONTACT_866033].  Trained  staff  at Memorial  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  the 
Food  and Drug  Administration,  or the study  supporters  will be able to review  the medical  records  if 
necessary.  The patient  may  terminate  her participation  in the study  at any time  during  the trial.

17.1 Privacy  
 
MSKCC’s  Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  pursuant  to a 
completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  Authorization  form.  A Research  Authorization  
form  must  be completed  by [CONTACT_45822]  [INVESTIGATOR_40092]  (IRB/PB).  
 
17.2 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  Reporting  
 
An adverse  event  is any undesirable  sign,  symptom  or medical  condition  occurring  after  starting  study  drug,  
even  if the event  is not considered   to  be related  to  study  drug.  Information   about  all adverse  events,  
whether  volunteered  by [CONTACT_423],  discovered  by [CONTACT_334956],  or detected  through  physical  
examination,  laboratory  test or other  means,  will be collected,  recorded  and followed   as  appropri  ate. 
Medical  conditions/diseases  present  before  starting  study  treatment  are only  considered  adverse  events  if 
they  worsen  after  starting  study  treatment  (any  procedures  specified  in the protocol).  Adverse  events  
occurring  before  starting  study  treatment  but after  signing  the informed  consent  form  are recorded.  Once  an 
adverse  event  is detected,  it should  be followed  until  its resolution  or until  it is judged  to be permanent.  
Abnormal  laboratory  values  or test results  constitute  adverse  events  only if they  induce  clinical  signs  or 
symptoms,  require  changes  in study  medication(s),  or require  therapy,  and are recorded.  Laboratory  
abnormalities  that meet  the criteria  for Adverse  Events  should  be followed  until  they  have  returned   to 
normal  or an adequate  explanation  of the abnormality  is found.  
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY  of the following  outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A Life threatening  adverse event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40088]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial   disruption  of the ability  to conduct  normal  life 
functions  
• Is a congenital  abnormality  or birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or requi  re 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613],  based  upon  medical  judgment,  they  may  jeopardize  
the patient  or subject  and may  require  medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  one of the 
outcomes  listed  in this definition.  
• Note:  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46426] a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  a SAE 
 
 
 
Events  not considered  to be serious  adverse  events  are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15976]: 
• routine   treatment   or  monitoring   of  the  studied   indication,   not  associated   with   any 
deterioration  in condition,  
• treatment,  which  was elective   or pre-planned,  for a pre-existing  condition   that  did not 
worsen,  
• treatment   on  an  emergency,   outpatient   basis   for  an  event  not  fulfilling   any  of  the 
definitions  of serious  given  above  and not resulting  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105904].

Pregnancy,  although  not itself  a serious  adverse  event,  should  also be reported  on a serious  adverse  event  
form  or pregnancy  form  and be followed  up to determine  outcome,  including  spontaneous  or voluntary  
termination,  details  of birth,  and the presence  or absence  of any birth  defects  or congenital  abnormalities.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent.  SAE reporting  is required  for 30-days  after  
the participant’s  last investigational  treatment  or intervention.  Any events  that occur  after  the 30-day period  
and that are at least  possibly  related  to protocol  treatment  must  be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires  submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP RR-408 ‘Reporting  of Serious  Adverse  Events’,  the 
SAE report  must  be sent  to the IRB office  within  5 calendar  days  of the event.  The IRB requires  a Clinical  
Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  to be submitted  electronically  to the SAE Office  as follows:  
 
For IND/IDE  trials:  Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent  to [EMAIL_440] . All other  
reports  should  be sent  to [EMAIL_2141]  
 
The report  should  contain  the following  information:  
Fields  populated  from  CRDB:  
• Subject’s  initials  
• Medical  record  number  
• Disease/histology  (if applicable)  
• Protocol  number  and title 
Data  needing  to be entered:  
• The date  the adverse event  occurred  
• The adverse  event  
• The grade  of the event  
• Relationship  of the adverse event  to the treatment  (drug,  device,  or intervention)  
• If the AE was expected  
• The severity  of the AE 
• The intervention  
• Detailed  text that includes  the following  
o A explanation  of how the AE was handled  
o A description  of the subject’s  condition  
o Indication  if the subject  remains  on the study  
o If an amendment  will need  to be made  to the protocol  and/or consent  form.  
o If the SAE is an Unanticipated  problem.  
 
The PI’s signature  [CONTACT_866034].  
For IND/IDE  protocols:  
The CRDB  AE report  should  be completed  as above  and the FDA assigned  IND/IDE  number  written  at the top 
of the report.  If appropriate,  the report  will be forwarded  to the FFA by [CONTACT_866021].

17.2.1  Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  Reporting  responsibilities  to [COMPANY_008]/MedImmune  
 
All SAEs  will be reported,  whether  or not considered  causally  related  to the investigational  product,  or to the 
study  procedure(s).  The reporting  period  for SAEs  is the period  immediately  foll owing  the time  that written  
informed  consent  is obtained  through  [ADDRESS_1208155] dose  of study  drug  or until  the initiation  of 
alternative  anticancer  therapy.  The investigator  and/or  Sponsor  are responsible  for informing  the Ethics  
Committee  and/or  the Regulatory  Authority  of the SAE as per local  requirements.  
 
The investigator  and/or  sponsor  must  inform  the FDA,  via CRDB  SAE form,  of any serious  or unexpected  
adverse  events  that occur  in accordance  with  the reporting  obligations  of [ADDRESS_1208156]  be emailed  to 
[COMPANY_008]  at the time  the event  is reported  to the FDA.  It is the responsibility  of the sponsor  to compi[INVESTIGATOR_865953]  a report  according  to the FDA reporting  requirement  
timelines  and to ensure  that these  reports  are also submitted  to [COMPANY_008]  at the same  time.  
 
* A cover  page  should  accompany  the CRDB  SAE form  indicating  the following:  
 
• “Notification  from  an Investigator  Sponsored  Study”  
• The investigator  IND number  assigned  by [CONTACT_1622] 
• The investigator’s  name  [CONTACT_3816]  
• The trial name/title  and [COMPANY_008]  ISS reference  number  (ESR -##-#####)  
* Sponsor  must  also indicate,  either  in the SAE report  or the cover page,  the causality  of events  in relation  to 
all study  medications  and if the SAE is related  to disease  progression , as determined  by [CONTACT_119785].  
 
* Send  SAE report  and accompanying  cover  page  by [CONTACT_363000]’s  designated  mailbox:  
[EMAIL_661]  
 
If a non-serious  AE becomes  serious,  this and other  relevant  follow -up information  must  also be provided  to 
[COMPANY_008]  and the FDA.  
 
Serious  adverse  events  that do not require  expedited  reporting  to the FDA still need to be reported  to 
[COMPANY_008]  preferably  using  the MedDRA  coding  language  for serious  adverse  events.  This information  
should  be reported  on a monthly  basis  and under  no circumstance  less frequently  than  quarterly.  
 
Reporting  of deaths  to [COMPANY_008]  
 
All deaths  that occur  during  the study,  or within  the protocol -defined  30-day post -last dose  of study  drug  
safety  follow -up period  must  be reported  to [COMPANY_008]  as follows:  
 
• Death  that is clearly  the result  of disease   progression  should  be 
documented  per institutional  standards  but should  not be reported  as a 
SAE to [COMPANY_008].  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 15 -038 A(7)  
Approval date: 29 -Jun-2018  
Page  81 of 98  
  
 
• Where death  is not due (or not clearly  due) to progression  of the disease  
under  study,  the AE causing  the death  must  be reported  to [COMPANY_008]  as 
a SAE within  24 hours . The report  should  contain  a comment  regarding  the 
co-involvement  of progression  of disease,  if appropriate,  and should  assign  
main  and contributory  causes  of death.  
 
• Deaths  with an unknown cause  should  always  be reported as a SAE.

recommendations  are not a representation  of benefit/risk.  A general  principle  is that differential  
diagnoses  should  be diligently  evaluated  according  to the standard  medical  practice.  
 
Non-inflammatory  etiologies  should  be explored  and appropriately  treated.  Corticosteroids  are a 
primary  therapy  for immune  related  events.  The oral equivalent  of the recommended  IV doses  may  
be considered  for ambulatory  patients  with  low grade  toxicity  and good  oral tolerance.  Lower  
bioavailability  of oral corticosteroids  should  be taken  into account  when  switching  to the equivalent  
dose  of PO corticosteroids.  Consultation  with  a medical  or surgical  specialist,  especially  prior to an 
invasive  diagnostic  or therapeutic  procedure,  is recommended.

Pneumonitis/ILD:  
- Monitor  patients  for signs  and symptoms  of pneumonitis  or ILD (new  onset  or worsening  shortness  of 
breath  or cough).  Patients  should  be evaluated  with  imaging  and pulmonary  function  tests  including  
other  diagnostic procedures  as described  below  
- Initial  work -up may  include  clinical  evaluation, monitoring  of oxygenation  via pulse  oximetry  (resting  and 
exertion),  laboratory  work -up and high -resolution  CT scan.  
Grade  1 - No dose  modification  required.  
However,  consider  holding  study  
drug/study  regimen  dosing  as 
clinically  appropriate  and during  
diagnostic  work -up for other  
etiologies - Monitor  and closely  follow  up in 2-4 days  for clinical  
symptoms,  pulse  oximetry  (resting  and exertion)  and 
laboratory  work -up and then  as clinically indicated  
- Consider  pulmonary  and infectious  disease  consult  
Grade  2 - Hold  study  drug/study  regimen  
dose until  grade  2 resolution to 
≤ Grade  1 
- If toxicity  worsens  then  treat  as 
Grade  3 or Grade 4 
- If toxicity  improves  to grade  ≤1 
then  the decision  to reinitiate 
study  drug/regimen  will be 
based  upon  treating  physician’s  
clinical  judgment  and after  
completion  of steroid  taper.  - Monitor  symptoms  daily  and consider  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
- Promptly  start  systemic  steroids  (e.g.,  prednisone  1- 
2mg/kg/day  PO or IV equivalent)  
- Reimaging  as  clinically  indicated  
- If no improvement  within  3-5 days,  additional workup  
should  be considered  and prompt  treatment  with  IV 
methylprednisolone  2-4mg/kg/day  started  
- If still no improvement  within  3-5 days  despi[INVESTIGATOR_865967] 2-4/mg/kg/day,  promptly  start  
immunosuppressive  therapy  such  as  TNF inhibitors  
(e.g.  infliximab  at 5mg/kg  every  2 weeks).  Caution:  
Important  to rule  out sepsis  and refer  to infliximab  
label  for general  guidance  before  using  infliximab  
- Once  improving,  gradually  taper  steroids  over  ≥4 
weeks  and consider  prophylactic antibiotics, antifungal  
or anti PCP treatment  (refer  to current  NCCN

Diarrhea/  E nterocolitis:  
- Monitor  for symptoms  that may  be related  to diarrhea/enterocolitis  (abdominal pain,  crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007],  or changes  in 
bowel  habits such  as increased  frequency  over  baseline or blood  in stool)  or related to bowel  perforation  
(such  as sepsis,  peritoneal  signs  and ileus)  
- Patients  should  be thoroughly  evaluated  to rule  out any alternative etiology  (e.g.,  disease  progression,  other  
medications,  infections ) including  testing  for clostridium  difficile  toxin,  etc. 
- Steroids  should  be considered  in the absence  of clear  alternative  etiology,  even  for low grade  events,  in order  
to prevent  potential  progression  to higher  grade  event

Peripheral  neuromotor  syndromes,  such  as Gui llain -B arre  and My astheni  a Gravis:  
- The prompt  diagnosis  of immune -mediated  peripheral   neuromotor  syndromes  is important,  since  certain  
patients  may  unpredictably  experience  acute  decompensations  which  can result  in substantial  morbidity  or in 
the worst  case,  death.  Sp ecial  care  should  be taken  for certain  sentinel  symptoms  which  may  predict  a more  
severe  outcome,  such  as prominent  dysphagia,  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_865970],  and signs  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_865971]  
- Patients  should  be evaluated  to rule  out any alternative  etiology  (e.g.,  disease  progression,  infections, 
metabolic  syndromes  and medications,  etc.).  It should  be noted  that  the diagnosis  of immune -mediated  
peripheral  neuromotor  syndromes  can be particularly challenging  in patients  with  underlying  cancer,  due to 
the multiple  potential  confounding  effects  of cancer  (and  its treatments)  throughout  the neuraxis.  Given  the 
importance  of prompt  and accurate  diagnosis,  it is essential  to have  a low threshold  to obtain  a neurological  
consult  
- Neurophysiologic  diagnostic  testing  (e.g.,  electromyogram  and nerve  conduction  investigations, and 
“repetitive  stimulation”  if myasthenia  is suspected)  are routinely  indicated  upon  suspi[INVESTIGATOR_865972] a neurology  consultation

- Steroids  may  be successfully  used  to treat  Myasthenia  
Gravis.  Important  to consider  that  steroid  therapy  
(especially  with  high  doses)  may  result  in transient  
worsening  of myasthenia  and should  typi[INVESTIGATOR_362916] a monitored  setting  under  supervision  
of a consulting  neurologist.  
- Patients  unable  to tolerate  steroids  may  be candidates  
for treatment  with  plasmapheresis  or IVIG.  Such  
decisions    are   best    made   in   consultation    with    a

General  Gu idelines:  
- Manage  per institutional standard  at the discretion  of investigator. 
- Monitor  patients  for signs  and symptoms  of infusion-related reactions  (e.g.,  fever  and/or  shaking  chills,  
flushing  and/or  itching,  alterations  in heart  rate and blood  pressure,  dyspnea  or chest  discomfort,  or skin 
rashes)  and anaphylaxis  (e.g.,  generalized  urticaria,  angioedema, wheezing,  hypotension,  or tachycardia).  
Grade  1  The infusion  rate of study  drug/study  
regimen  may  be  decreased   by  50%  
or temporarily  interrupted  until  
resolution of the event.  − Aceta  minophen  and/or  antihistamines  may  be 
administered  per institutional  standard  at the 
discretion  of the investigator.  
− Consider  premedication  per institutional standard  
prior  to subsequent  doses.  
− Steroids  should  not be used  for routine  
premedication of Grade  ≤2 infusion  reactions. 
Grade  2  The infusion  rate of study  drug/study  
regimen  may  be decreased  50%  or 
temporarily interrupted  until  
resolution of the event.  
- Subsequent  infusions  may  be 
given  at 50%  of the initial  
infusion  rate.  − Aceta  minophen  and/or  antihistamines  may  be 
administered  per institutional  standard  at the 
discretion  of the investigator.  
− Consider  premedication  per institutional standard  
prior  to subsequent  doses.  
− Steroids  should  not be used  for routine  
premedication of Grade  ≤2 infusion  reactions. 
Grade  3 or 4  Permanently  discontinue  study  
drug/study  regimen.  Manage  severe  infusion -related  reactions  per 
institutional  standards  (e.g.,  IM epi[INVESTIGATOR_238],  followed  
by [CONTACT_866032], and IV 
glucocorticoid).

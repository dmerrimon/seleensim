8/16/[ADDRESS_622581] limited metastases are still potentially curable with 
aggressive local therapy. However, conventional moderate dose radiation is unlikely to provide 
durable local control. Given the recent technologic advances in rad iation delivery, it is now 
possible to deliver tumoricidal doses, using stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) over a short 
time course with highly focal techniques. Stereotactic radiation has proven efficacious in the 
intracranial setting and in multiple e xtracranial sites in adults. It has not yet been well studied in 
the pediatrics population where there is a particularly strong rationale due to the ablative doses 
that can be delivered to tumor while simultaneously reducing high dose to normal tissues. Th e 
proposed trial is a single arm phase II study to determine the efficacy of SBRT in pediatric 
sarcomas with surgically unresectable metastatic disease. Metastatic sites eligible for treatment 
in this study include bony sites of disease. SBRT will be deliv ered to each eligible site to a total 
dose of 4000 cGy delivered in 5 fractions of 800 cGy per fractions each day. Following 
completion of SBRT, patients will undergo treatment response assessment with the use of 
diagnostic imaging, clinical examination, a nd completion of the Brief Pain Inventory to assess 
quality of life. The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of SBRT 
delivered to a dose of 4000 cGy in 5 fractions of 800 cGy each for patients greater than 3 years 
of age and < 40 years of age with metastatic disease of bone secondary to pediatric sarcoma. The 
secondary objectives of this study include describing the toxicity of SBRT with this regimen;  
assessing clinical response rate of each target lesion;  assessing long -term clinic al outcomes; and 
assessing  quality of life following completion of treatment.  For patients with potentially curable 
oligometastatic disease, surgical resection in conjunction with systemic therapy remains the 
standard of care. Patients on this study will be able to receive chemotherapy [ADDRESS_622582] systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

1.   OBJECTIVES  
  
1.1 Primary Objectives  
  
To determine the lesion -specific local control at 6 months of SBRT delivered to a  dose of 
4000 cGy in 5 fractions of 800 cGy each for patients greater than 3 years of age and < [ADDRESS_622584] assessment   
   (FDG - PET/CT is optional for assessment)  
      
  1.2.[ADDRESS_622585] ed that these oligometastatic patients 
would benefit from effective local therapy in addition to systemic therapy (1). In agreement 
with this hypothesis, surgery and chemotherapy for isolated pulmonary metastases can result 
in long term disease -free period s (2). Additionally, some 25% of patients following resection 
and chemotherapy for colorectal cancer and isolated liver metastases can similarly have 
longterm disease free survival (3 -5). Patients who may benefit most from curative therapy 
are most likely those patients with limited systemic disease when metastatic disease is 
generally confined to a lesion state of five metastatic sites or fewer.   
  
2.2 Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT)  
The treatment of metastases depends on multiple factors including  1) the location of the 
primary tumor, 2) the presence or absence of other metastatic foci, 3) the size, number and 
location of metastases, 4) the effectiveness of various forms of therapy, and 5) the patient’s 
functional status.  Conventional moderate dos e radiation for metastatic disease is given 
primarily for palliation. Recent advances in radiation delivery now make it possible to image 
and treat precisely within any anatomical region of the body. As a result, the capacity to 
deliver tumoricidal doses i n a single or few (1 -10) outpatient treatments is now possible. In 
addition, by [CONTACT_484423], it should also be 
possible to decrease the rate of complications. Intracranial stereotactic radiation therapy has 
been  shown to be a highly effective treatment for brain metastases in both the adult and 
pediatrics population (6,7). This suggests that selective small extracranial tumors may be 
effectively controlled by [CONTACT_211455] -dose stereotactic body radiotherapy  (SBRT). 
Local control in excess of 75% has been reported using extracranial SBRT for metastatic 
tumors of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], lung and liver, which is significantly higher than conventional moderate 
dose radiation (8 -24). Toxicity has been minimal in these reports  despi[INVESTIGATOR_484401] (8 -24).   
  
2.[ADDRESS_622586] been shown to increase control in histologies, such as sarcoma, which    are 
common in the pediatrics population (11,25). With stereotactic radiation therapy        
      techniques, a reduction in normal tissue d ose surrounding the target lesion of interest may  
also be accomplished resulting in lower toxicity. Given that pediatric patients with sarcomas,  
presenting with limited metastases  in lung and bone, are still considered to be a curable

Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center.  
   
To register a patient, the fol lowing documents should be completed and faxed or e -mailed 
to the Coordinating Center:  
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, 2018  
10  • Signed patient consent form  
• HIPAA authorization form  
• Completed and signed eligibility checklist  
• De-identified copi[INVESTIGATOR_484404]. To complete 
the registration process, the Coordinating Center will:  
• assign a patient study number  
• register the patient on the study with the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer 
Center’s Clinical Research Office   
• fax or e -mail the patient study number to the participating site  
  
  
 5.  TREATMENT PLAN  
  
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  Expected toxicities and potential 
risks are described in Section 7.  Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 
6. No investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_105896]’s malignancy  concurrently.  
  
   5.1   Pre-Treatment P rocedures  
  
The following will be completed prior to radiation initiation:  
• Medical history and clinical examination  
• Pathologic confirmation of malignancy  
• CBC, chemistry panel   
• CT of treatment site (not required if MRI is obtained)  
• MRI of treatment site, optional depending on site (required for spi[INVESTIGATOR_484405])  
• Positron Emission Tomography (FDG -PET) scan (optional)  
    
   5.[ADDRESS_622595] scan acquisition 
in conjunction with maximum intensity projection (MIP), will be considered 
acceptable maneuvers to account for organ motion. If the target cannot be 
visualize d or localized on the planning imaging modality as a result of motion or 
metal artifact, stereotactic treatment should not be used.      
  
The treating radiation oncologist will identify the location of the tumor.  Gross 
tumor volume (GTV) delineation will  be performed with a diagnostic radiologist 
on sequential axial computed tomography images. A radiosurgical treatment plan 
will be developed based on tumor geometry and location. Adjacent normal 
structures including but not limited to the heart, esophagus,  aorta, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], 
kidneys, rectum, bowel, liver, and stomach within 5 cm of the GTV will be 
identified for the purpose of limiting incidental radiation to these structures 
(please see Appendix D for a list of normal tissue dose constraints to be used on  
protocol as well as constraints for high and low -dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]).  
We plan to deliver [ADDRESS_622596] 90% of 
the defined target volume. For          patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_484406], the vert ebral body will be 
contoured as a separate clinical target             volume (CTV) encompassing the GTV. 
The CTV vertebral body will be          expanded by [ADDRESS_622597]                      dose constraint (see table below):

The spi[INVESTIGATOR_484407].       
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_484408] [ADDRESS_622598] can move within the thecal sac.  The thecal sac will be 
contoured based on T2 MRI or bony limit of spi[INVESTIGATOR_484409] a PRV 
(planning org an at risk volume) for the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. Thecal sac volume will be defined 
as [ADDRESS_622599] should not be contoured as skin unless 
skin is actually present in these locations. Ribs within 5 cm of the PTV should be 
contoured by [CONTACT_484424]. The intercostal spaces should not be 
included as part of the ribs.  The minimum, mean, and maximum dose to the PTV will 
be reported. Only < 1 cc or < 1-5% of unspecified tissue outside of the PTV can 
receive > 100-110% of the prescribed dose.   
  
   5.3  SBRT Treatment Delivery  
  
All patients should receive 5 fractions of 800 cGy over a five -day period (See Section 
6 for dose modification). Ideally all 5 fractions should be delivered Monday through 
Friday, however it may be delivered over two weeks.  
  
Within three weeks of the initial treatment planning imaging study, SBRT will be 
administered using image -guidance. This protocol allows conventional linear 
accelerators and specialized linear accelerators with image guidance (e.g. Novalis, 
Trilogy, Synergy, Artiste) capable of conformal dose delivery and IMRT. Specialized 
accelerators (e.g. Cyberknife or Tomotherapy) are also allowed.   
  
During treatment, real time cone beam CT images of the patient’s body site of in terest 
will be obtained. Cone beam CT scan will be obtained immediately prior to treatment 
and will be repeated until the treatment shift, required to align the CT planning scan 
and the cone beam CT scan performed on the day of treatment, is within [ADDRESS_622600].  
  
 5.4  General Concomitant Me dication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
  
 
  
  There are no known potential interactions between SBRT and concomitant 
medications.  
  
 5.5  Duration of Therapy  
  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue 
for 2 weeks or until one of the following criteria applies:  
    
• Disease progression,  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
• Patient or parent/guardian (for minors) decides to withdraw from the study, or  
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

 7.  ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
  
   7.[ADDRESS_622603] treatments, which are not part of this study, 
their treating physician will be counseling them on the risk of their treatments, 
including the risk of surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy, wh ichever is 
appropriate for the type and the stage of their cancer. Clinically significant toxicities 
in the study will include Grade 3, 4, and [ADDRESS_622604] imaging, MRI imaging, and SB RT. 
Recording and reporting requirements are discussed in Section 7.3.  
  
Risks associated with blood draw:  
Phlebotomy can cause pain, bleeding, and rare needle site infection. CT imaging 
results in low dose radiation exposure, which has an extremely smal l risk of causing a 
secondary cancer.   
    
Risks associated with SBRT:  
It is difficult at this time to predict with confidence the complication rate from the 
proposed SBRT. However, it is reasonable to extrapolate from the current experience 
with SBRT to  the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], lung and pancreas in adults.    
  
Toxicities commonly associated with such treatment will depend on the location of 
the treated metastasis. These toxicities can include skin erythema and desquamation, 
pain, neuropathy, dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss.  Some of 
these symptoms can also be due to tumor progression. One significant toxicity is 
radiation pneumonitis, which can be manifested as fever, increased excertional 
dypsnea, pleuritic chest pain, and peritumoral infiltrate on chest imaging.  It generally 
occurs betwe en 1 to 3 months of completion of radiotherapy.  The risk of grade 2 -4 
radiation pneumonitis is aproximately 10 -15% in patients treated with standard 
fractionated large field radiotherapy and higher in patients treated with combined 
chemoradiotherapy.  It is highly dependent on the volume of the lung treated to high 
dose and the mean lung dose.  At this point, the incidence of RT pneumonitis from 
stereotactic radiosurgery for small pulmonary tumors is unknown.  However, if the 
treated tumor volume is kept ≤  65 cc, the risk should be < 10 -15% with the proposed 
dose level. Also, given that this protocol focuses on SBRT to bone and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rather 
than lung, the risk of pneumonitis is expected to be low. Fracture is also a potential 
risk of radiotherapy to bone a nd spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], although doses in this study will be lower than 
the radiosurgery doses thought to put patients at high risk for fracture as reported in 
the literature (29).   
    
Growth delay or arrest is a potential late effect of radiotherapy to bone for child ren 
who have not completed puberty. For this reason, patients in this protocol are limited 
 
  
  to those who have surgically unresectable disease or to those patients whose families 
refuse surgery. Given the data that demonstrates the improvement in clinical 
outcomes associated with aggressive local therapy in properly selected metastatic 
patients, the potential benefit of delivering a therapeutic dose of radiation likely 
outweighs the risks. The alternative treatment in this scenario is the delivery of 
subthera peutic doses of radiation with palliative rather than curative intent.  
  
Clinical and radiographic assessments will be performed as indicated to identify all 
adverse effects, ascertain their etiology, and provide the most appropriate palliative 
measures.  Complications other than radiation pneumonitis, if any, will be graded 
according to the CTCAE version 4.0  
  
   7.2  Definitions  
  
   7.2.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
  
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or 
experience t hat develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of 
study treatment or any procedure specified in the protocol, even if the event is not 
considered to be related to the study.   
  
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events 
only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further 
diagnostic tests.  
  
   7.2.2  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and 
regardless of causality that:   
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening. Life -threatening means that the person was at 
immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e ., it does not 
include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it 
occurred in a more severe form.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the event required at 
least a 24 -hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n beyond the 
expected length of stay). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical 
operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to 
study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before 
the person was enroll ed in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in 
an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than 
planned).  
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, 2018  
16  • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is 
defined as a substantial disruption of  a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or  
• Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and require medical  or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of 
such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or th e 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
  
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:  
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated 
with any deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures  
• elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen  
• emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious 
criteria outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admission  
• respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]  
    
 7.2.3  Expectedness  
  
Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.'   
  
   [IP_ADDRESS] Expected adverse event  
  
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as 
resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes of this  study, 
an adverse event is considered expected  when it appears in the current 
adverse event list, the Inve stigator’s Brochure, the package insert or is 
included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.     
  
Refer to Section 7.1 for a listing of expected adverse events associated 
with the study agent(s).  
  
   [IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected adverse event  
    
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected  
when it varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information 
provided in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, 
the package insert or when it is not included in the informed consent 
document as a potential risk.    
  
 
  
     7.2.4  Attribution  
  
Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event 
and the study treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:  
  
• Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study treatment.  
• Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.   
• Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related  to the study treatment.  
• Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
  
 7.[ADDRESS_622605] or other means, 
will be recorded in the participant’s medical record.  Low grade toxicities are to be 
expected given the disease profile. Any toxicity below CTCAE v4.0 grade 3 will not be 
reported on the Master AE Log or Case Report Forms. However, this information will 
be monitored and retained in patient charts.   
  
Hematologic toxicity will be assessed an d monitored but not reported.  
  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_484410]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_484411] 30 days from completion of SBRT and that are not attributable to research 
intervention will be recorded on the Master AE Log and reported at the time of 
continuing review and SMC monitoring.  
  
These parameters are drafted in accordance with CFR21, though provide realistic 
expectations based on the sickness of this patient population.

J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, [ADDRESS_622611] – Solid Tumors  
  
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response [ADDRESS_622612] their response classified according to the definitions stated 
below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end 
of SBRT will also be considered  evaluable.) Evaluable patients will also be those 
who received the protocol -specified dose.   
  
   9.1.[ADDRESS_622613] one dimension (longes t diameter to be recorded) as 
>10 mm with diagnostic techniques (CT, FDG -PET/CT, or MRI). All tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).   
  
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), in cluding small 
lesions (longest diameter <10 mm with diagnostic techniques), are considered 
non-measurable disease. Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal 
masses (n ot followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all non -measurable.  
  
Target lesions.   Target lesions in this study will be considered metastatic sites up 
to a maximum of [ADDRESS_622614] or MRI and/or any lesion that shows increase 
metabolic uptake on FDG -PET/CT scans.   
  
Non-target lesions .  N/A  
  
   9.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, [ADDRESS_622615], FDG -PET/CT, and MRI  These techniques should be performed 
with cuts of [ADDRESS_622616], abdomen, and pelvis.  Head and neck tumors and those of 
extremities usually require specific protocols.  
  
   9.1.4  Response Criteria  
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Response Assessment of Bone Metastases  
  
Radiographi c assessment of bone metastasis can be difficult as remodeling bone 
may lead to residual abnormalities on bone scan, CT scan, and MRI scan. This 
leads to inherent difficulties in using RECIST 1.1 criteria for response 
assessment. For the purposes of the cu rrent protocol, response at bone metastasis 
will be graded as follows:  
  
Complete response (CR)  = A negative FDG -PET at the irradiated lesion in 
patients who have a positive FDG -PET at the time of SBRT at the target lesion. 
FDG -PET is optional on study. T herefore, CR will be recorded but not required to 
constitute a response.  
  
Progressive disease (PD)  = Any of the following will constitute PD:  
  
• Development of a new soft tissue mass > 1 cm in maximum axial dimension at 
a previous site of bone metastasis without a soft tissue component or with a soft 
tissue component < 1 cm in maximum axial dimension on previous evaluations.  
  
• For bone metastasis with a soft tissue component > [ADDRESS_622617] axial diameter of 
the soft tissue component by > 20%.   
  
• A previous bone metastasis that was positive on FDG -PET, became negative 
with protocol therapy, and then becomes positive a gain should prompt concern 
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, 2018  
  
 24  
  for progression at that site. Confirmatory testing is required to document 
progression at a previous site of bone metastasis. Together with return of FDG -
PET uptake, MRI scan with documentation of an enhancing bone lesion will 
constitute adequate evidence to support progression at that site. Biopsy is 
strongly encouraged, but not required to confirm progression at a previous site 
of bone metastasis.   
  
• Biopsy evidence of viable sarcoma at a previously radiated bone metastasis.  
Stable disease (SD)  = Patients not meeting either CR or PD criteria.  
  
   [IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Response   
  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of 
the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as  reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started).  Best overall response will be based on the overall 
response of the target lesions.  
  
   9.1.5  Duration of Response  
  
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from 
the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as 
reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.   
  
   9.1.6  Clinical Response Parameters  
  
Progression -free survival (PFS)  is defined is the time from starting treatment to 
the time of first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, 
whichever occurs first. Death is considered as an event here. For subjects whose 
disease does not pr ogress or who do not die, PFS will be censored at the time of 
the last visit.   
Time to progression (TTP)  is defined as the time from starting treatment to the 
time of first documented tumor progression. Subjects who do not progress will be 
censored at the time of the last contact. In addition, death from any cause will also 
be censored.    
Overall survival (OS)  is defined as the time from starting treatment until death 
due to any cause. For subjects who do not die, time to death will be censored at 
the time  of last contact.  
Local Control (LC)  is defined as the time from starting treatment until local 
relapse is documented. The target lesion will be considered locally controlled if 
criteria for progression are not met, taking as reference the smallest measur ements 
recorded since the treatment started.

  at SKCC C by [INVESTIGATOR_484397], MD and externally by [CONTACT_484427].  Trial monitoring and reporting will be done through the Safety 
Monitoring Committee at SKCCC.  
  
Authorized representatives of the Coordinating Center may visit pa rticipating sites to 
perform audits or inspections, including source data verification.  The purpose of these 
audits or inspections is to systematically and independently examine all trial related 
activities and documents to determine whether these activit ies were conducted and data 
were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP), and any applicable regulatory requirements.  
  
11.2 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_484412] 20 patients and toxicity will be monitored continuously throughout. 
Any Grade 5 toxicity that is possibly related to radiation will suspend accrual until the 
study chair reviews the case. The criteria for severe adverse events to be considered 
clinically significant toxicities are pres ented in Section 7.1. We established a safety 
monitoring rule that will recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_484413] (AE) rate is convincingly above 30%. Specifically, if 
the posterior probability of the AE ra te exceeding 30% is 65% or greater, we will 
consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_484414]. The prior distribution for the risk of 
AE is beta (0.5, 3.5), representing our prior guess at the AE rate is 12.5% on average and 
there is 90% certainty that i t is between 0.05% and 45%. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_484415] 5000 simulations are shown in the

 13.  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
  
 13.1   Study Design/Endpoints  
  
13.1.1 Definition of primary outcome/endpoint  
  
The efficacy of SBRT delivered with a dose of 4000 cGy in 5 fractions on 800 cGy each 
to pediatric nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma or bone sarcoma patients who are 
greater than 3 years of age and < [ADDRESS_622622] 1.1 criteria, local control at the radiated  site will be defined as 
the absence of progression of disease as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Thus, CR and SD 
will constitute local control. Local control assessment will start at one month following 
completion of protocol treatment and continuous assessm ent will be pursued during the 
follow -up period. The reference response probability for comparison will be 70%. This is 
based on the study by [CONTACT_484429]. (31)  
  
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, 2018  
  
 30  
   13.2  Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
  
The primary endpoint of this trial is to  estimate the loca l control of SBRT at 6 months.  
We anticipate that the local control rate will be roughly 90% as opposed to a 70% 
historical response with conventional moderate dose radiation. With 20 subjects 
participated, we will be able to estimate the local control ra te to within 20% (i.e., 
maximum width of the 90% confidence interval reached is when the observed rate is 
50%). If we observe a 6 -month local control rate of 90%, we will be 90% certain that the 
true rate is greater than 70%. The associated exact 90% confi dence interval will be (0.72, 
0.98).     
  
Using a Simon optimal two -stage design with a type I error of 10% and a type II error of 
20%, the first stage would consist of [ADDRESS_622623] stage.  Otherwise, accrual would continue to a total of 20 patients. If 17 or 
more patients respond at the end of the second stage, the regimen with SBRT is 
considered promising (i.e ., local control at 6 months is greater than 70%).  This design 
has a 58% chance of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_484419] 70% (the null 
hypothesis) and 11% chance of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_484419] 
90%.  
  
The goal  of enrollment is [ADDRESS_622624] 
binomial 90% confidence interval.  
  
 13.3   Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
  
13.3.1 Definition of secondary outcomes/endpoints:  
• To describe the toxicity of SBRT delivered to a dose of 4000 cGy in 5 fractions of  
800 cGy each for the population enrolled using grading with CTCAE v. 4.0  
• The clinical response rate of each lesion will be assessed by [CONTACT_484430] 
(FDG -PET/CT is opt ional for assessment) and defined by [CONTACT_484431]. The absence of progression will constitute a response. Therefore, 
lesionspecific CR or SD will be measured as a response.   
• To assess long -term clinical outcomes of this patient population aft er completion 
of SBRT by [CONTACT_484432] -free survival and overall survival. Relapse -free 
survival will be measured from time of enrollment to date of disease progression 
or death. Patients who are lost to follow -up will be censored for determination of 
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, [ADDRESS_622625] evaluation. Overall survival is 
defined as time from enrollment to death due to any cause.   
• To assess quality of life following completion of SBRT using pre - and post -SBRT 
completion of the Brief Pain In ventory form and 10 point Visual Analog Scale 
which will be filled out by [CONTACT_484433].    
  
13.3.2  Analysis plan for secondary endpoints:  
• Toxicities will be graded and tabulated at the time of each follow -up assessment.  
The proportion of toxicities by [CONTACT_484434] 95% 
confidence intervals.  
• Each metastatic lesion will be considered a target lesion and independently 
evaluated for response. The proportion of these lesions that have a stable or better 
response and the intra -cluster correlation will be estimated with an intercept only 
generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression.  This will be estimated directly 
with SAS Genmod by [CONTACT_484435], the identity li nk function, 
and an exchangeable correlation structure.   
• Hazard rate estimates and 95% confidence intervals as well as Kaplan -Meier 
(KM) estimates will be used to summarize survival (OS), progression free 
survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP) and loco regional control (LRC) 
functions over time.  The median OS, PFS, TTP and LRC will be reported.  Cox 
proportional hazards models will be used to evaluate the impact of key covariates 
on these endpoints as the sample size permits.    
• Quality of life will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory form and [ADDRESS_622626] be assessed 
for response to treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment 
deviations.  Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories:  1) 
complete response, 2) stable disease, 3) progressive d isease, 4) early death 
from malignant disease (defined as death prior to first evaluation after 
completion of SBRT), 5) early death from toxicity, 6) early death because of 
other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).  [Note:  By 
[CONTACT_484436], category 9 usually designates the “unknown” status of 
any type of data in a clinical database.]  
  
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, [ADDRESS_622627] been identified (e.g., early death due to 
other reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, majo r protocol violations, 
etc.).  However, these sub -analyses may not serve as the basis for drawing 
conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding 
patients from the analysis should be clearly reported.  The reason for 
performing sub set analyses would be to generate hypotheses for future 
prospective clinical trials.

Guidelines for Spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]   
J1367 Protocol Version: December 21, 2018  
–  
 40  
    
High Dose Spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]:  
1. Any dose > 105% of the prescription dose should occur primarily within the PTV itself and not 
within the normal tissues outside the PTV. Therefore, the cumulative volume of all tissue outside 
the PTV receiving a dose > 105% of prescription dose should not be more than 15% of the PTV 
volume.  
2. Conformality of PTV coverage will be j udged such that the ratio of the volume of the prescription 
isodose meeting criteria 1 through 4 to the volume of the PTV is ideally < 1.2 (see table below). 
These criteria will not be required to be met in treating very small tumors (< 2.5 cm axial GTV 
dimension or < 1.5 cm craniocaudal GTV dimension) in which the required minimum field size of 
3.[ADDRESS_622638] be rapid in all 
directions and meet the following criteria:  
a. The maximum total dose over all fractions in Gray (Gy) to any point [ADDRESS_622639] be no greater than D2cm where D2cm is given by [CONTACT_941] t able below.  
2. The ratio of the volume of 50% of the prescription dose isodose to the volume of the PTV must be  
no greater than R50% where R50% is given. See Table below.  
3. Respect all critical organ dose -volume limits listed above

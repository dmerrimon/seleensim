  5 2  INTRODUCTION 2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) represent the most common forms of dementia, with an estimated 7.2+ million Americans living with Alzheimer’s disease or Lewy body dementia.1-2 As many as 70% of persons with AD/ADRD experience reduced quality of life due to agitation,3 with behavioral disruptions such as aggression, combativeness, shouting, exit-seeking, and disinhibition. Agitated individuals with dementia make up a significant portion of those living in residential care facilities, because family/home caregivers can no longer manage the burden alone.  Based on studies on the effectiveness of simulated presence therapy, repetitive messaging, and reminiscence therapy,4-5 Edgewater Safety Systems developed a smart media player (Memesto) worn by [CONTACT_84035]/ADRD patient that delivers personalized music and pre-recorded messages to reduce agitation.  The current study will confirm proof-of-concept by [CONTACT_402288]/caregiver voice and music delivered by [CONTACT_402289]/ADRD persons living in a residential care facility. 2.2 BACKGROUND  An unprecedented need exists for rigorous, transformative solutions to improve health outcomes for the 7.2+ million people in the [LOCATION_002] (US) who suffer with AD/ADRD. 1-2 AD/ADRD are age-related neurodegenerative diseases characterized by [CONTACT_402290], orientation, independent decision-making capacity, and self-care. Lack of effective care approaches and technologies leads to premature institutionalization for AD/ADRD sufferers and poor quality of life for themselves and their caregivers.6-7 Up to 70% of AD/ADRD sufferers experience acute agitation,[ADDRESS_506921] diagnoses for the drug’s intended use, using them instead to ‘mentally subdue’ distressed patients.8 AD/ADRD patients displaying agitation, especially once it has reached crisis level, require significant stressful intervention from caregivers, contributing to caregiver burn-out. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], caregivers detect building agitation in AD/ADRD persons from experience. Two key problems with this approach are that: 1) caregivers are often overwhelmed with direct patient care and intervention, reducing patient monitoring time; and 2) rising agitation isn’t always obvious until it reaches crisis mode and severe behavioral problems arise. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Behavior-Based Ergonomic Therapy, for example) are used which aim to calm patients by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_402272]. Such therapi[INVESTIGATOR_402273], but require staff resources, and can neither predict nor stop rising agitation.  A means of detecting agitation in patients as it increases and automatically delivering an effective, calming intervention would have benefit. Edgewater Safety Systems created the Memesto, a wearable smart audio player that delivers time-settable and/or repeating voice/music therapy to reduce patient agitation. The device was informally pi[INVESTIGATOR_402274]/ADRD persons in care facilities, with 11 of 11 caregivers rating the unit 4.5 of 5 for “usefulness in lowering agitation”. Caregiver feedback indicated patients were calmer, 
Protocol ESS-MEM-[ADDRESS_506922] be established by [CONTACT_38350] a prototype and testing it to validate real-time operation. This study aims to generate the quantitative data needed to show Memesto-delivered audio therapy reduces agitation. 2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  2.3.[ADDRESS_506923] cellular service. Per guidance issued by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) on software device functions and mobile medical applications,9 the Memesto is not considered a medical device and is therefore not regulated by [CONTACT_1622].  There is potential that using the device (e.g., wearing the device, listening to repeated music/voice messages) as well as answering study-related questions about the participant’s mood and behavior may become upsetting, frustrating, and/or tiring to either the participant and/or study partners. 2.3.2 KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  Participants with AD/ADRD may see modest benefit if agitation is improved. Study partners also may find some relief and/or feel more engaged in caring for a person living with AD/ADRD experiencing agitation through use of the device. Finally, study-related questions may serve to help study partners recognize agitation symptoms more reliably and with greater precision. In contrast, societal benefits may be substantial. Problems associated with dementia and agitation are common and create significant distress for persons living with AD/ADRD and their family and professional caregivers. Knowledge gained from the study has direct implications for efforts to advance a non-pharmacological approach to reducing the morbidity associated with agitation in persons living with AD/ADRD. 2.3.3 ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  This is a minimal risk study. While it could not otherwise be carried out without the involvement of persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers, study-related questions may be refused and further participation may be declined at any time. Potential study benefits, while modest to the participant, may be of critical importance to providing family and professional caregivers with more tools for improving agitation in persons living with AD/ADRD. Thus, the anticipated benefit-risk profile of this study is favorable. 3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
Protocol ESS-MEM-001  Version 1.0   01 December 2021  
  7  OBJECTIVES ENDPOINTS Primary  To evaluate the efficacy of Memesto in reducing agitation Change in average score on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) agitation domain subscale from baseline to Week 10  Secondary  To evaluate the clinical benefit of Memesto in reducing agitation  Change in average score on the Clinical Global Impressions – Severity (CGI-S) scale from baseline to Week 10  4 STUDY DESIGN 4.1 OVERALL DESIGN This is an open-label, proof-of-concept study evaluating the efficacy of Memesto in reducing agitation in persons with AD/ADRD currently living in a residential care facility. Approximately 20 persons with AD/ADRD will take part in the study. Each participant will have two study partners: a family caregiver and a professional caregiver (from the residential care facility) willing to participate in the study along with the person with AD/ADRD. Participants will be adults with a dementia diagnosis who have clinically significant agitation, defined as a state of poorly organized and purposeless psychomotor activity characterized by [CONTACT_37408]: aggressive verbal (screaming, cursing), aggressive physical (destroying objects, grabbing, fighting), or non-aggressive physical (restlessness, pacing) behaviors.  After informed consent is obtained from both the participant and respective study partners, participants will complete a preliminary screening for eligibility and trained on the Memesto to use over a two-week screening/training phase. Once satisfactorily completing this phase, participants will be followed for 10 weeks of data collection with visits (either in-person or via telephone) occurring at baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. The primary study endpoint is the NPI [INVESTIGATOR_402275] a secondary study endpoint of the CGI-S scale; both assessed as the average change from baseline to the end of treatment (Week 10). The study will be approved and overseen by [CONTACT_3551] (IRB). Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_458] (PI) and study staff via adverse event reporting in accordance with all IRB and funding agency requirements. 4.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN As this is a proof-of-concept study designed to provide initial data to determine whether Memesto use quantitatively reduces agitation in persons with AD/ADRD, study design consists of a single open-label treatment arm. While the open-label design has some risk for reporting bias, it is expected that “triangulation” with ratings from two separate study partners will reduce some of the bias while still enabling a clear signal for further device development in the form of a future randomized trial involving a sham device.

  8 4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR INTERVENTION This study is designed to demonstrate the efficacy of Memesto in reducing agitation in persons with AD/ADRD. Data collected across the 10-week treatment phase is intended to establish device feasibility for further development.  4.4 END-OF-STUDY DEFINITION The end of the study is defined as completion of Visit 7 (Week 10) or Early Termination (ET) as shown in Section 1.3, Schedule of Activities. [ADDRESS_506924] two study partners: (1) a spouse, sibling, or adult child; and (2) a professional caregiver from the care facility (e.g., nurse, activity director, certified assistant). All participants must meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. In order to provide a broader understanding of the Memesto’s use in diverse populations of persons living with AD/ADRD, we plan on 50% of the participants living with AD/ADRD being non-White and anticipate 20% being Latino. Additionally, approximately 67% of the participant cohort will be women and 33% will be men. 5.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA 1. Age 18 years or older at time of informed consent. 2. Diagnosis of AD/ADRD as confirmed by [CONTACT_402291]. 3. Significant agitation characterized by [CONTACT_402292]: a. Verbal aggression (e.g., screaming, cursing); b. Physical aggression (e.g., destroying objects, grabbing, fighting); or c. Non-aggressive physical behavior (e.g., restlessness, pacing). 4. CGI-S score ≥ 4 at Screening. 5. Availability of (1) a spouse, sibling, or adult child AND (2) a professional caregiver from the care facility (e.g., nurse, activity director, certified assistant) willing to serve as study partners who can: a. Provide study staff accurate information regarding the participant’s personal and health information, mood, behavior, medications, and device use throughout the course of the study; and b. Record personalized messages and/or help identify music for audio therapy and program the Memesto’s therapy schedule. 6. Signed informed consent obtained from (a) the participant or the participant’s legally authorized representative (if the participant is incapable of providing consent for him or herself), and (b) both study partners. 5.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA 
Protocol ESS-MEM-001  Version 1.0   01 December 2021  
  9 1. Inability to demonstrate compliance using the Memesto during the screening/training phase as evidenced by [CONTACT_402293][INVESTIGATOR_402276] (i.e., wearing) of the device as reported by [CONTACT_402291](s). 5.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS N/A 5.4 SCREEN FAILURES Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in this study but do not proceed into the 10-week treatment phase.  Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) because of meeting the exclusionary criteria may be rescreened. Rescreened participants will be assigned the same participant number as for the initial screening. 5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION Working with dementia unit directors, nurse managers, and activity directors at given residential care facility (i.e., formal study partner), family caregivers of persons with AD/ADRD and agitation will be identified and approached. The recruitment process involves a presentation about AD/ADRD and agitation, the need for the study, and what is involved in study participation. Written materials on dementia, agitation, and the Memesto will be made available. Study staff will then engage individually with each potential participant and family caregiver (i.e., informal study partner) who expresses interest in the study. All study procedures, risks and benefits, and the option to withdraw without penalty will be reviewed. Since this study is most likely to involve persons with moderate to severe dementia based on who typi[INVESTIGATOR_402277]/ADRD in residential care facilities, most if not all participants will likely not have capacity to consent at the time of enrollment. Therefore, the power of attorney/authorized decision maker for the person living with AD/ADRD will be approached to provide consent for participation. After all parties have had as much time as needed to consider participation and all their questions answered, signed consents will be obtained with copi[INVESTIGATOR_402278].  Study retention is supported by [CONTACT_7661] a two-week training period built into the protocol. Also, close follow-up with the participant triad (person with AD/ADRD, family caregiver, professional caregiver) will be maintained by [CONTACT_464]. [ADDRESS_506925] with waterproof case will be provided with the device to facilitate use and accountability. 6.1.2 ADMINISTRATION AND/OR DOSING Participants will be provided the Memesto at Screening for a two-week screening/training phase of use. Participants successfully completing this phase will continue use for [ADDRESS_506926] TRAINING AND TRACKING All study staff responsible for providing device training will be instructed on device use by [CONTACT_402294]. Training will be documented and filed in the Investigator Site File (ISF). Further, representatives from Edgewater Safety Systems will be available throughout the duration of the study for device- or application-related questions or troubleshooting. 6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING N/A 6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION ADHERENCE Adherence to study treatment will be recorded in the form of a device accountability log completed by [CONTACT_402295]-between study visits as well as review of scheduled voice/music therapi[INVESTIGATOR_402279]. 6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY Use of prescription and non-prescription medications will be reviewed at each study visit and documented in the relevant electronic case report form (eCRF). 6.5.1 RESCUE THERAPY N/A 7 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL 7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION All participants who permanently discontinue study treatment and do not agree to continued data collection through study completion (Week 10), for whatever reason, will be withdrawn from the study. Refer to Section 0, Schedule of Activities for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation (i.e., ET). 
Protocol ESS-MEM-001  Version 1.0   01 December 2021  
  11 7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_147140] a participant from the study for any of the following reasons:  • Significant study intervention non-compliance; • Inability to replace a study partner should a study partner’s participation end early; • Lost-to-follow up; unable to contact [CONTACT_3445] (see Section 7.3, Lost to Follow-Up); • Any event or medical condition or situation occurs such that continued collection of follow-up study data would not be in the best interest of the participant; or • The study is cancelled.  The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be documented in the relevant eCRF.  7.[ADDRESS_506927] 3 documented attempts.  8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 8.1 ENDPOINT AND OTHER NON-SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 8.1.1 NEUROPSCYHIATRIC INVENTORY The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) is a widely used, well-established instrument that assesses behavioral changes in neurologic illnesses through a structured interview with a caregiver.10 Behavioral domains are scored based on frequency and severity. The nursing home version of the inventory will be utilized in this study and administered (in-person or via telephone) to both the formal and informal study partners by [CONTACT_127431]. Only the agitation domain of the NPI [INVESTIGATOR_402280]. 8.1.2 CLINICAL GLOBAL IMPRESSIONS SCALE - SEVERITY The Clinical Global Impressions Scale – Severity (CGI-S) is a brief observer-rated instrument that establishes a global rating of illness severity.11 The scale responses range from 1 (normal) to 7 (amongst the most extremely ill). The CGI-S in relation to agitation will be administered (in-person or via telephone) to both the formal and informal study partners by [CONTACT_127431]. 8.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS Adverse event (AE) reporting will begin at Screening and will continue until the end of the study. The occurrence of AEs will be sought by [CONTACT_105]-directive questioning of the participant and/or study partners during each study visit. AEs may also be detected when volunteered through unsolicited contact [CONTACT_402296]/or study partners between study visits. Refer to Section 8.3, Adverse Events and Serious 
Protocol ESS-MEM-001  Version 1.0   01 December 2021  
  12 Adverse Events and Section 8.4, Unanticipated Problems for further details regarding collection, documentation, and reporting requirements.  8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS This protocol uses the National Institute on Aging (NIA) guidelines for reviewing and reporting adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Definitions are from the January 2007 Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others and Adverse Events: OHRP Guidance.[ADDRESS_506928] or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human study participant, including any abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participants’ involvement in the research, whether or not considered related to participation in the research.  Given this is a minimal risk study, only AEs associated with use of the Memesto device or with study-related questioning will be recorded. 8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS An SAE is defined as any AE that: • Results in death • Is life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred • Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] • Causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity • Results in congenital anomalies or birth defects • Is another condition which investigators judge to represent significant hazards Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]/emergency room visits for worsening of agitation associated with the underlying AD/ADRD will not be considered SAEs.  8.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT [IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT All recorded AEs will have their severity classified by [CONTACT_9152]-trained clinician as follows:  • Mild – Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of minor irritant type causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient. • Moderate – Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_14212]; moderate experiences may cause some interference with functioning. • Severe – Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating. 
Protocol ESS-MEM-001  Version 1.0   01 December 2021  
  13 Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed.  [IP_ADDRESS] RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION All recorded AEs will have their relationship to study procedures, including the intervention, assessed by [CONTACT_9152]-trained clinician based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the following categories:  • Definitely Related – The AE is clearly related to the investigational agent/procedure – i.e., an event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study intervention, follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected intervention, that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_366245]’s clinical state. • Possibly Related – An adverse event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study intervention follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected intervention, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  • Not Related – The adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational agent/procedure - i.e. another cause of the event is most plausible; and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event and the study intervention and/or a causal relationship is considered biologically implausible. [IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTEDNESS  All recorded AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_9152]-trained clinician as to whether they were expected to occur or unexpected as follows: • Unexpected – Nature or severity of the event is not consistent with information about the condition under study or intervention in the protocol or consent form. • Expected – Event is known to be associated with the intervention or condition under study. 8.3.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP The occurrence of an event may come to the attention of study staff during study visits or through unsolicited reporting by [CONTACT_4538]/or study partner outside of a study visit. All AEs occurring while on study, not otherwise precluded per the protocol, will be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization. 8.3.5 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  All events will be recorded on the relevant eCRF. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study procedures, whether it was expected, and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. This study will utilize the NIA-approved flow sheets and forms to identify and track events. Events will be assessed to determine if they meet criteria for an AE, SAE, or unanticipated problem (UP).  Events meeting criteria for an AE will be reported, as necessary, in accordance with IRB and funding agency requirements. Further details regarding AE reporting are outlined in the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP). 
Protocol ESS-MEM-001  Version 1.0   01 December 2021

Further details regarding UP reporting are outlined in the DSMP. 8.4.3 REPORTING UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS TO PARTICIPANTS  N/A [ADDRESS_506930] method. 9.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S) The pre-specified quantitative end point will be change from baseline in the NPI [INVESTIGATOR_402282]. The NPI [INVESTIGATOR_402283] (professional and family caregiver, respectively) for symptom frequency and severity. The domain score is a composite (frequency x severity) score of [ADDRESS_506931] a 30% reduction in the agitation domain score. The NPI [INVESTIGATOR_402284] (http://npi[CONTACT_348244].net/faqs.html) suggests that a 30% decrease in scores is generally clinically meaningful.  Therefore, a positive finding would be that at least half of the study participants would have a 30% improvement after 10 weeks of treatment. 9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S) A secondary endpoint will be a validated agitation measure (change in the average CGI-S score over the 10-weeks of data collection). The CGI-S is measured based on a 7-point Likert scale. The number of persons with a CGI-S score showing improvement will be calculated, defined as achieving a final Week 10 score (or if missing last observation, carried forward score) of 3 or less. A clinically meaningful signal will be if improvement is noted on 30% of the participants.

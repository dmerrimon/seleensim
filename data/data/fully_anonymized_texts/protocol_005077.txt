[INVESTIGATOR_189995]  (QOL) is very often a cause of concern for parents of children with autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD). This concern may develop as parents observe their children struggle to 
adapt to the world around them. Children with ASD may be come especially agitated when 
confronted with situations not normally considered challenging for the neurotypi[INVESTIGATOR_189996] ; and 
parents of children with ASD learn quickly to avoid potentially volatile situations in order to 
maintain their child’s equilibrium. Comorbid anxiety, with prevalence estimates ranging from 
44% to 83% (Johnson et al., 2009; Hollway & Aman, 2011) greatly stresses the ability of the 
family to engage in enrichment activities . Additionally, a nxiety in ASD has been found to be a 
strong predictor of sleep disturbance (Hollway, Aman, & Butter, 2013) and irregular and delayed 
sleep may leave the child exhausted, impact ing daytime behavior (Meltzer & Mindell, 2006) and 
QOL in children (Hsiao & Nixon, 2007; Wirell, Blackman, Barlow, Mah & Hamiwka, 2005). 
 
Considerably m ore impairing , the bidirectional nature of sleep disturbance and anxiet y 
affects QOL, as anxiety may disturb sleep , and a lack of sleep may lead to increased anxiety 
(Hollway & Aman, 2011). In a report of unpublished data (Hollway, 2012), the investigator found that Emotional Functioning on the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory  (PedsQL) was 
associated with sleep disturbance in 1583 children with ASD. Out of 12 possible predictors, seven significantly predicted Emotional Functioning [ F(7,1482) = 87.643, p <.001]. The results 
indicated that the Children’s Sleep Habits Question naire (CSHQ) subscales,  Sleep Anxiety, 
Bedtime Resistance, and being a poor sleeper  in general,  contributed to quality of emotional 
functioning and showed a moderate effect ( R
2 = .293). This indicated that a moderate proportion 
of the variance found in the PedsQL Emotional Functioning subscale score was explained by [CONTACT_10994] (29.3%) (Cohen, 1988). 
 Sleep problems cause significant family distress (Hiscock & Wake, 2002; Doo & Wing, 
2006) and clinicians are utilizing behavioral intervention (BI) first for sleep improvement. For many, this intervention is sufficient for improving sleep quality and quantity (Andersen et al., 2008). However, when BI alone is unsuccessful and sleep problems persist, there ar e few 
alternatives from which parents can choose that do not involve pharmacological agents (e.g., melatonin, medication) (Hollway & Aman, 2011a; Hollway & Aman, 2011b).  As an adjunct, an essential oil formulation distributed by [CONTACT_190020]. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_189997] . This study will provide data to help 
us decide whether continued study is warranted in a much larger multisite study. The proposed research will contribute new knowledge that could be useful for clinicians. The purpose of this research is to increase the existing knowledge regarding quality of life in children with ASD.

Background and Significance 
 
Aromatherapy has been used as a supplement to decrease stress, anxiety, and to help 
induce sleep (Hur, Song, Lee, J. & Lee, M., 2014; Lee, Wu, Tsang, Leung & Cheung, 2011). 
However, there is a paucity of empi[INVESTIGATOR_189998].  The data that are available include studies lacking 
systematic rigor that are fraught with methodological problems (Hirokawa & Nishimoto, 2012; 
Hur, Song, Lee, J. & Lee, M., 2014; Lee, Wu, Tsang, Leung & Cheung, 2011; Williams, 2006). Studies of late have introduced massage therapy while simultaneously implementin g essential 
oils (Cetinkaya, B., Basbakkal, Z.; 2013; Satou, et al. 2012; Williams, 2006). In these studies the length of the physical contact [CONTACT_190021]. Other studies have used aromatherapy in a variety of ways such as the diffusion method, applying the oil directly to a body part (without massaging it in), and adding the oil to a cotton ball and attaching it to a pi[INVESTIGATOR_189999] (Ndao et al., 2012; Nord & Belew, 2009).  In other studies subjects were not randomized (Hirokawa & Nishimoto, 2012), there was not an adequate placebo (Satou et al., 2013), and the sample sizes were quite small (Hirokawa & Nishimoto, 2012; Williams, 2006). Another problem was the subjective nature of the data collection (parent or subject self ratings). Not surprisingly the results were mixed (Jefarzadeh, Arman & Farahbakhish Pour, 2012; Ndao et al., 2012; O’Flaherty, vanDijk, Alertyn & Millar, 2012; Satou et al., 2013; Williams, 2006; Wu, 2014).  Our aim is to systematically evaluate in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_190000], equanimity, and sleep. We intend to enroll [ADDRESS_225116] 3 months of the study while  Group 2 will receive a scented coconut oil comparator. At the end of 
the 3 month period there will be a one month washout and each group will be crossed over to the opposite condition.  We will use parent ratings of QOL and objective measures of 
relaxation/sleep (actigraph ). 
 
Specific Aims/Hypotheses  
  
Our primary aims are to evaluate the feasibility of a larger study and examine preliminary 
data regarding benefit and tolerability of an essential oil formulation distributed b y Young 
Living Essential Oils, Lehi, UT., for enhancing QOL  in children with ASDs. We will develop 
preliminary data suitable to be submitted in a competitive NIH grant application for a larger multisite study. The proposed study will include a 7 -month crossover with two 3-month 
conditions and a month washout between, with randomly assigned order. The 2 conditions will be a proprietary formula of essential oils and a scented coconut oil comparator. Measures of QOL, equanimity, and sleep health will include parent report on valid and reliable rating scales.   
 
Primary Hypotheses  
 
1. We can recruit 2 8 participants in 2 years with 85% adherence and 85% retention through 
both conditions. 
3 
V 1.4 8/3/[ADDRESS_225117] size. 
3. While receiving essential oils participants will show negligible or no increases in adverse 
events (AEs), including allergic contact [CONTACT_8748], immediate contact [CONTACT_190022] (contact [CONTACT_22815]), and photosensitivity, compared to the control condition.   
Secondary Mediational Hypotheses 
 
1. With essential oils, compared to the control condition, participants will show significantly improved sleep onset and maintenance on objective and subjective measures (actigraphy; parent sleep diaries, and parent and clinician-rated scales)  with a medium 
effect size, and this will mediate the improvement in QOL . 
2. With essential oils , compared to the control condition, participants will display greater 
equanimity and improvements in mood and daytime behavior on objective and subjective measures (heart rate; parent and clinician rated scale) compared to the control condition  
and this will mediate the improvement in QOL .

V 1.4 8/3/2016  
Study Design  
 
This study will use a double-blind -controlled crossover design with random assignment 
to order of conditions.  The 2 conditions will be ReconnectTM, a mixture of essential oils 
formulated by [CONTACT_190024] (YL) vs. a fragrant appearance- matched coconut -oil comparator. In 
order to randomize [ADDRESS_225118] month  to assess whether the mode of essential oils 
application is tolerable (i.e., inhalation or topi[INVESTIGATOR_59407]) and to develop graphs of effect on sleep and equanimity over time. During the final [ADDRESS_225119] significant problems with QOL as measured by [CONTACT_190025], with a total item mean score of  > 1.5 (i.e., one standard deviation below the normative 
mean). 
   At baseline, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two orders of essential oils . 
The oil will be dispensed at the Baseline visit, and will be administered by [CONTACT_190026] d iffusion method in the 
evening. 
 
 In this study, clinical responders will be defined as showing a 30% improvement in the 
total score of the PedsQL Inventory.    Approximately 50% of children will wear a device known as an actigraph that measures 
activity level and sleep quality. There will be [ADDRESS_225120] serve basis . There may be some 
participants who are unwilling to wear the actigraph and for those who are tactiley  defensive we 
will not require them to do so.  Participants will wear the devices for five consecutive nights, on three separate occasions (i.e., between Screening and Baseline, prior to  the End P oint of the first 
3 month period, and  prior to the End Point of the second 3 month period). The small watch -like 
devices worn on the wrist or ankle will collect activity data and measure body temperature while 
the participant sleeps.  They will yield the following sleep variables: 1) time in bed, 2) total sleep  
time (from lights out), 3) sleep onset latency, 4) morning waking time, 5) frequency of night 
5 
V 1.4 8/3/2016 wakings, 6) longest sleep period, and 7) sleep efficiency.  This is a reliable method of objective 
data collection for sleep -wake patterns including timing, continuity, and duration of sleep. 
   In the proposed study, there will be a primary clinician  (the physician) and an 
independent evaluator. The physician will discuss possible side effects and make dose or 
administration mode adjustments. The independent eval uator will interview the parents with 
respect to target improvements ( QOL) and make DD-CGAS ratings based on all feedback, 
including parent rating scales.   Dosing Each participant will utilize both oil delivery methods: diffusion at night and topi[INVESTIGATOR_190001]. If a participant is unable to tolerate one of these delivery methods, then both the morning and night- time doses can be administered via the same, more tolerable method.  
 Reconnect™ Directions:  
To be applied only by a trusted adult or under adult supervision.   Topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]: Apply [ADDRESS_225121] sensitive skin. Apply in the morning.    Aromatic Method : Diffuse one diffuser- full (8-12 drops of oil in water) at night. 
1. Home diffuser instructions: Open the water reservoir by [CONTACT_190027]. Add room-
temperature water (distilled water is recommended) up to the fill line of the reservoir. Do 
not exceed the fill line.   
2. Add 8-[ADDRESS_225122] the lid to cover the water reservoir.   
4. Plug in the Home Diffuser and push the power switch to start diffusing.  
5. When water r uns out, the diffuser will automatically shut off.  
6. To cycle through the three-mode power settings, press the power switch quickly:  Mode 1: Green light - Constant diffusion Mode 2: Red light - 30 seconds intermittent diffusion Mode 3: Off.  Use constant diffusion  (green light, mode 1).  
7. To turn on/off the ambient LED light, press and hold the power switch for approximately 2 seconds.  
Notice: Due to the mist output of the Home Diffuser, use caution on surfaces that are sensitive to water. 
 Essential Oil  
The type of Young Living essential oil we will be utilizing is Reconnect™. Reconnect™ contains the following ingredients: Caprylic/capric triglycerides, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (Sweet almond) oil, Boswellia sacra† oil, Citrus aurantium bergamia† peel oil, Commiphora 
myrrha oil, Lavandula angustifolia† oil, Pelargonium graveolens† flower oil, Callitris intratropi[INVESTIGATOR_190002], Santalum paniculatum† wood oil, Cananga odorata† flower oil, Cedrus atlantica† wood oil, Aniba rosaeodora† wood oil, Melissa officinalis† leaf oil, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_190003]†

V 1.4 8/3/2016 branch/leaf/wood oil, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_190004], Hyssopus officinalis† leaf oil, Rosa damascena† 
flower oil. The comparison oil is coconut oil with a tiny amount of vanilla, just enough for an aroma. Please see Table 2 for a listi ng of the ingredients, their current common uses, and  
potential side effects.  
Primary Outcome Measure 
 
Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL)  (Varni, Burwinkle, & Seid, 2006). The [ADDRESS_225123] on the quality of life in children as outlined by [CONTACT_38375]. The four Multidimensional Scales are: Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, So cial Functioning, 
and School Functioning. The summary scores include a Total Scale Score, a Physical Health Summary Score, and a Psychosocial Health Summary Score. Response choices are in Likert -
scale format ranging from 0 to 4 (i.e., 0 = Never, 1 = Almost Never, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Often, 4 = Almost Always). There are [ADDRESS_225124] condition; once selected, the same scale will be used throughout that child’s participation. To be enrolled participants wi ll 
have clinically significant problems with quality of life (i.e., total item mean score of  > 1.5). 
 
Other Measures for Establishing Study Inclusion Criteria  
 Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ( ADOS) (Rutter et al. , 2004). The ADOS is an 
investigator -based assessment that places the child in naturalistic social situations demanding 
specific social and communication responses. Behaviors are coded in the areas of social communication, social relatedness, play and imagination, and repetitive behaviors. The ADOS provides a DSM- based algorithm for the diagnosis of ASD. The ADOS will be administered by a research -reliable clinician if it has not already been done by a reliable administrator .  
 Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory (CASI) (Gadow & Sprafkin, 2004). We will use the CASI to evaluate children ages 3 to 9 years of age for symptoms of common childhood psychiatric disorders. The CASI will aid ruling out exclusionary psychiatric disorders. Based on 
DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, this scale assists clinicians by [CONTACT_190028]. The inventory offers both criterion- related cut -off scores and norm-
based scores for determining symptom severity (low, moderate, or high, based on parent ratings.   
Exploratory Dependent Measures in addition to Ped sQL 
 
Developmental Disabilities – Children’s Global Assessment Scale (DD- CGAS) (Wagner et al., 
2007). The DD -CGAS is a reliable instrument for measuring global functioning of children with 
developmental di sorders in treatment studies. We will use the DD -CGAS to characterize 
children’s impairment on the following four domains: Self Care, Communication, Social Behavior, and School/Academic. In addition, this scale also includes a series of descriptive “bands” to characterize global functioning in children with pervasive developmental disorders from “extreme and pervasive impairment” through “superior functioning.”  Parent Stress Index (PSI) (Abidin, 1995). The PSI is used to evaluate the degree of stress in the 
7 
V 1.4 8/3/2016 parent-child relationship. The Short Form is composed of 36 items taken from the full length PSI 
and is completed in 10- 15 minutes. Child characteristics in the full scale include 
Distractibility/Hype ractivity, Adaptability, Reinforces Parent, Demandingness, Mood, and 
Acceptability. Parent measures include Competence, Isolation, Attachment, Health, Role 
Restriction, Depression, and Spouse. The PSI  is used for early identification of dysfunctional 
parent-child interactions, parental stress, and family functioning. It may be used for parents of 
children up to 12 years, but it is primarily intended for parents of children 0- 3 years. It yields a 
Total Score and three domain scores. Parents rate each of the 36 items on a 5- point scale (1 = 
strongly disagree, to 5 = strongly agree). The 90th percentile of the Total PSI score represents a 
clinically significant level of parenting stress (i.e., total score of > 260). The PSI will be a 
secondary outcome. 
 
Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) (Owens, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_50175], & Mcguinn, 2000). The abbreviated CSHQ is a valid measure of sleep problems with good psychometric properties. The CSHQ was designed for use in children [ADDRESS_225125] common sleep problems. The CSHQ incorporates items related to eight key sleep domains. The eight subscales include: (1) bedtime resistance (2) sleep onset latency, (3) sleep duration, (4) anxiety around sleep, (5) night awakenings, (6) sleep disordered breathing, (7) parasomnias and (8) morning waking/daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. A Total Score of 41 or greater on the CSHQ 33 items has been reported to be an appropriate clinical cu t-off for identifying sleep problems in children.  In a 
recent study of the participants in the Autism Treatment Network 75% of the participants analyzed had a CSHQ score of 41 or higher (Hollway, Aman, and Butter, 2013). The Abbreviated CSHQ will be used to determine whether a child has a clinically significant sleep problem and will be a secondary (mediational) outcome measure of the study.  
 Parent Sleep Diary (Thomas & Burr, 2009). A parent/caregiver  diary documenting overall 
information about participant sleep -wake behavior patterns , will be implemented. Caregivers 
will record “time in bed,” time asleep,” “time awake after sleep onset,” and “number of nighttime awakenings.” The diary will be used in conjunction with the CSHQ ra ting scale to 
collect caregiver estimates of  sleep efficiency . These data will be evaluated for their reliability 
when compared to our objective measure of the sleep, the Motion-logger Micro Watch.  The sleep diary will be distributed to the caregiver at the end of each vi sit to be filled in at home  
each morning.  
 The Autism Anxiety Scale (AAS)(Aman, Scahill, Lecavalier, and Sukodolsky, 2013). Investigators 
from OSU, Emory University, and Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] (CHOP) are engaged in developi[INVESTIGATOR_190005] (NIMH grant “Toward outcome measurement of anxiety in youth with autism spectrum disorders”).  This project uses the Children and Adolescent Symptom Inventory’s (CASI) anxiety items as its nucleus. But investigators have expanded the scale’s content 
following a review of the literature and conducting [ADDRESS_225126] for use in randomized clinical trials. We are fortunate to be allowed to use an early version of this cutting -edge scale. The AAS, in addition to 
the abbreviated CSHQ, will be a secondary (meditational) outcome measure of the study.  
8 
V 1.4 8/3/[ADDRESS_225127] (ABC).The ABC is a 58-item parent -report measure with five 
subscales:  1) Irritability (includes agitation, aggression and self-injurious behaviors, 15 items); 2) 
Social Withdrawal (16 items); 3) Stereotypi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (7 items); 4) Hyperactivity (16 items); and 5) Inappropriate Speech (4 items), (Aman et al., 1985a; Aman et al. 1985b; Aman et al., 1987, Brown, Aman, & Havercamp, 2002). Psychometric characteristics of the ABC range from satisfactory to very good (Aman et al.,1985b). The ABC has been commonly used in research on children with ASD and is highly sensitive. Its parent- rated five subscales wi ll be used to explore 
whether the use of Reconnect Essential Oils is associated with behavior changes during the day. We will evaluate the ABC to assess irritability levels and improvement over the course of the study. The ABC will be an exploratory outcom e measure.  
 
Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (Costantino et al., 2003). This 65- item rating scale measures 
the severity of autism spectrum symptoms as they occur in natural social settings.  Completed by 
a parent or teacher in 15 to 20 minutes, the SRS pr ovides a clear pi[INVESTIGATOR_510] a child's social 
impairments, assessing social awareness, social information processing, capacity for reciprocal social communication, social anxiety/avoidance, and autistic preoccupations and traits. It is appropriate for use wit h children from 4 to 18 years of age. Sensitive and reliable across a wide 
range of symptom severity, the SRS can be used as a screener in clinical or educational settings, an aid to clinical diagnosis, or a measure of response to intervention. SRS scores are particularly helpful in identifying Autism, Asperger's Disorder, Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD -NOS), and Schizoid Personality Disorder of Childhood. 
 Short Sensory Profile (SP) (Dunn, 1999). The Short Sensory Profile is a 38-item caregiver 
questionnaire and score sheet designed for use in screening and research protocols. The items on the Short Sensory Profile  are grouped into three major sections: sensory processing, modulation, 
and behavioral and emotional responses. In a recent report it was found that sensory sensitivities were related to sleep difficulties in children with ASD (Hollway, Aman, Butter, 2013). We will use the SP to track sensory sensitivities which may be related to  avoidance behavior that 
interferes with family QOL , over the course of the study. The SP will be  an exploratory measure. 
 Repetitive Behavior  Scale – Revised (RBS -R) (Lam & Aman, 2007). The RBS -R is a 43-item 
self-report questionnaire that is used to measure the breadth of repetitive behavior in children, 
adolescents, and adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders. The RBS-R provides a quantitative, continuous measure of the full spectrum of repetitive behaviors. The RBS- R consists of six 
subscales including: Stereotyped Behavior, Self -injurious Behavior, Compulsive Behavior, 
Routine Behavior, Sameness Behavior, and Restricted Behavior that have no overlap of item content. This permits differential identification and scoring of discrete varieties of repetitive behaviors. Participants are asked to read a list of behaviors and choose a score that best describes how much of a problem the behavior has been. Behaviors are rated on a 4- point scale: 0 -
Behavior does not occur, 1-Behavior occurs and is a mild problem, 2-Behavior occurs and i s a 
moderate problem, 3-Behavior occurs and is a severe problem. We will use the RBS -R to assess 
repetitive behaviors and improvement over the course of the study.   Swanson, Nolan, and Pelha m Version IV Parent Rating Scale (SNAP- IV).  The SNAP -IV ADHD 
and ODD sections include the 18 DSM- IV symptoms of ADHD (9 hyperactive/impulsive items 
9 
V 1.4 8/3/2016 and 9 inattention items) and eight symptoms of ODD (Oppositional Defiant Disorder) on a 0-3 
metric; it can be  downloaded from www.adhd.net. We will use the SNAP -IV to asses s ADHD 
and ODD symptoms and improvement over the course of the study.  
Objective Measure of Sleep  
 Motionlogger Micro Watch (Ambulatory Monitoring) . The Motionlogger Micro Watch includes 
basic sleep estimation with simultaneous environmental data collection . A range of recording 
capabilities exist including four validated sleep algorithms and a suite of circadian rhythm analyses. The software package allows for quick easy download of actigraph data. Study 
participants will wear the actigraph on five consecutive nights between the Screen and Baseline Visits, between Visit [ADDRESS_225128] phase (Week 12), and at the Endpoint of the last phase (Week 28). The following tests will be 
run on the blood samples: ALT, AST, total and direct bilirubin, creatinine, CRP, IL -6, and CBC. 
The following tests will be run on the urine samples: standard urinalysis , to evaluate protein , PH, 
glucose, ketones, nitrites, appearance, color, specific gravity, and bacteria. 
Adverse Events (AEs). To minimize the risk, subjects will be systematically monitored. AEs, 
vital signs, including resting BP, will be evaluated at ea ch visit throughout all phases of the 
study. When the treating clinician elicits an AE, it will be documented on a case report form, 
regardless of suspected relationship to the essential oil. For all AEs, the investigator will obtain sufficient information  to determine the onset, course, and outcome of the AE.  If a subject has 
experienced an AE, the subject may return to the site for an unscheduled visit at the PI’s discretion.  If any of these AEs are serious and/or unexpected, the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_190006].       Potential AEs include sun sensitivity due to the Bergamot in the essential oil, possibly 
gynecomastia in pre-pubescent males due to the lavender oil in the essential oil, and skin irritation at the application site.  
Sample Characteristics 
 
Demographic Profile .  This will be completed by [CONTACT_7071] / caregiver at screening to 
document basic demographic information (parent education, occupation, and marital status). 
 
Cognitive / Developmental Measures.  Depending on the age and functioning level of the child, the Stanford- Binet Intelligence Scales; 5th Edition abbreviated battery (Nagle & Bell, 1993) or 
Mullen Scales of Early Learning AGS Edition will be administered (Mullen,  1995). These are 
the two cognitiv e/developmental measures used in the Autism Treatment Network and our other 
projects.  We will evaluate level of cognitive functioning to characterize our sample. The IQ test 
results will be used to characterize our sample via mean and standard deviation.   
10 
V 1.4 8/3/[ADDRESS_225129] condition and the second. This questionnaire will be used to determine parents  level of satisfaction with the study conditions and procedures. The 
Consumer Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) speaks to feasibility of a larger study, which is one of the study’s aims.  
 Masking Questionnaire. The Making Questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_190029] a study clinician at Visit 10 (Week 28). This questionnaire will be used to determine whether parents and clinicians can guess the oils that parents received during the first and last 3 months of the study and why. This questionnaire will provide information about the efficacy of masking essential oils treatments  that may be useful for future studies.  
 
Data Analytic Plan  
 
The primary goal of this double-blinded randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_190007] a full- scale study by [CONTACT_56620] (1) recruitment (retention and adherence), (2) 
safety, (3) and preliminary evaluation of the effect on the clinical outcomes. The primary outcome is  QOL.  Chief secondary outcomes are CSHQ, AAS  and PSI.  Exploratory outcomes 
include DD- CGAS, ABC SRS, RBS and Actigraphy .  
  Data analysis will be primarily comparing Reconnect to the control condition. For drop-outs, we will do a terminal evaluation and evaluate whether it is related to study oils or 
procedures or to some unrelated issue (e.g., moving away), and report the pattern of drop out. If more subjects drop out at a very early stage (week 1 or 2) than expected based on our experience, we will consider recruiting additional subjects to insure [ADDRESS_225130] sizes of the changes of 
these clinical outcomes after 12 weeks will be estimated, using Cohen’s definition, for each condition. Each phase will last for a total of [ADDRESS_225131] 2 8 subjects randomized into 2 orders of 
condition with a block size of 4 initially, then block size of 2 as the sample size nears 
11 
V 1.4 8/3/2016 completion. Considering up to 15% early drop outs due to reasons not related to essential oils , 
we plan to  randomize up to [ADDRESS_225132] 3 months will involve data analysis and manuscript writing.

evidence in the availab le information on 
coconut oil, peanut oil, and oleic acid that demonstrates, or suggests reasonable grounds to suspect, a hazard to the public as they are now used in paper and cotton 
packaging material for food at levels now 
current or as they might reaso nably be 
expected to be used for such purposes in 
the future.”  Composed of 92% saturated

 PERIOD OF TRIAL  
Planned study conduct duration of approximately 3 years . 
 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
Integrated whole- body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -positron emission tomography 
(PET) scanners have recently been introduced for clinical use.  This technology combines the anatomic and perfusion data obtained with Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) MRI with functional imaging data obtained from PET.  For breast imaging, the combination of MRI and PET has important potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and provide molecular characterization of breast cancer.  The overall purpose of this research is to 
determine the technical feasibility  of simultaneous breast DCE MRI  with 18F-FES PET for 
measuring estrogen receptor ( ER) in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS) and 
identifying patients with low -risk of disease recurrence.  We hypothesize that quantitative 
18F-FES uptake parameters from PET/MRI will correlate well with the ER 
immunohistochemistry score and with low -risk recurrence scores.   
 Primary Objective  
To compare quantitative 
18F-FES uptake of biopsy -proven DCIS measured using 
PET/MRI  with ER protein levels determined by [CONTACT_9064] .   
 Secondary Objectives  
1) To determine the optimal cut -point 
18F-FES uptake value for distinguishing 
between ER+ and ER -negative DCIS; 2) to determine the test -retest reproducibility  
of quantitative assessment of tumor 18F-FES uptake; 3) to determine the optimal 
cut-point 18F-FES uptake value for distinguishing between low -risk DCIS and 
intermediate/high- risk DCIS; 4) t o estimate the association of quantitative 18F-FES 
uptake (continuous SUV max) with research- based Oncotype DX DCIS scores (0 -
100); 5) to measure the upgrade rate to invasive cancer at surgical excision; 6 ) to 
correlate tumor 18F-FES uptake with serum estradiol and sex hormone binding 
globulin levels.  
 Exploratory Objective 
8 
 To correlate tumor cell density with 18F-FES uptake on PET/MRI .

 STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective, one- arm, observational study which will enroll patients with biopsy -
proven DCIS  scheduled for diagnostic breast MRI for preoperative staging/extent of 
disease evaluation as part of standard of care.  Eligible patients will be consented for 
participation in the research study  which includes a directed breast PET/MRI  with 
18F-
FES.  18F-FES uptake of the known malignancy will be measured on the PET/MRI  
examination using standardized uptake values (SUV) and tumor -to-normal tissue ratios.  
The proposed work -flow is described in the schema.   
 
 
* Patients  with newly diagnosed DCIS from a screening breast MRI are also eligible to participate in this 
study. For these subjects, the research breast PET/MRI should be performed prior to any treatment or 
surgery for DCIS.  
 
[ADDRESS_1231295] the hypothesis that 18F-FES SUV max from PET/MR I correlates well against 
the ER IHC Allred score .  The correlation of the two measures will be evaluated using 
Spearman correlation analysis .  A sample size of 12 patients achieves 8 2% power 
(β=0.20) for detecting an expected correlation coefficient (r=0.73) to be significantly different from zero with two -tailed α value of 0.05.   
 We anticipate enrolling approximately [ADDRESS_1231296] reproducibility, a subset of up to 5 participants with ER+ DCIS will have the option 
to for both test -retest FES scans .  The number of subjects with ER -negative DCIS will be 
limited to ≤ 3.

[ADDRESS_1231298] cancer ( 1).  The 
incidence of DCIS has markedly increased since the widespread utilization of screening 
mammography.  It is estimated that approximately 63,410 new cases of in situ carcinoma will be diagnosed in the [LOCATION_002] in 2017 ( 2).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_880896], 
overall treatment outcomes are excellent with 3.3% breast -cancer specific mortality after 
20 years ( 3). 
 DCIS is a non -obligate precursor to invasive breast cancer, meaning some disease will 
remain DCIS if not surgically excised while others will progress to invasive cancer ( 4, 5).  
Small study series of the natural history of DCIS have found that approximately 28% (7/25) of untreated DCIS progressed to invasive disease within 15 years ( 6).  Even cases 
of low nuclear grade DCIS have been shown to develop into invasive breast cancer in 36% (16/45) of patients undergoing biopsy only ( 7).  In contrast, data also exist from 
autopsy studies that have found undiagnosed DCIS in up to 15% of women who died from causes other than breast cancer ( 8).   
 The conventional treatment of DCIS is surgical excision, either through lumpectomy or mastectomy (9).  For patients eligible for breast conserving surgery, radiation therapy is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_880897] (10) since adjuvant radiotherapy has been 
shown to reduce the risk of local recurrence (either recurrent DCIS or invasive cancer) by [CONTACT_3450] 50% ( 11).  Compi[INVESTIGATOR_880898] 
3,[ADDRESS_1231299] shown that radiation therapy reduced the ten- year rate of 
local recurrence from 28.1% in patients randomized to surgery alone versus 12.9% for those randomized to surgery with radiation therapy ( 11).  Adjuvant endocrine therapy 
(tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors) can also be considered as an additional systemic risk -
reducing treatment option in women with estrogen receptor (ER) positive DCIS ( 12-16).             
 In contrast with invasive breast cancer, use of adjuvant radiotherapy or endocrine therapy for DCIS patients has not yet been shown to improve survival ( 11, 12
).  Thus, the potential 
for over -diagnosis and over -treatment of DCIS has become a controversial topic.  
Improved individualized treatment plans for women with DCIS and prevention of over -
treatment in patients with “low -risk” DCIS has been ranked highly as a critical and 
impactful research priority ( 17-20).  There are ongoing clinical trials evaluating the 
comparative effectiveness of treatments that are alternatives to the standard described above.  These include the E4112 trial, which seeks to avoid radiation therapy in women with low risk DCIS and the COM ET trial which is evaluating endocrine therapy as an 
alternative local control approach for women with ER/PR+ low and intermediate grade pure DCIS.  
 Current approaches for risk stratification are primarily based on clinical and pathological factors.  These include patient age, nuclear grade, size, and surgical margin status.  Prognostic models, such as the University of Southern [LOCATION_004]/Van Nuys Prognostic Index (21) and the Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center Nomogram (22), have been 
developed that incorporate these clinicopathologic variables.  These models are available to clinicians to provide a patient with information regarding the probability of local 
[ADDRESS_1231300] not been fully validated using 
independent data sets outside of the institutions from which they were developed ( 23, 
24). 
 A multigene expression assay has been recently developed that provides a ten- year risk 
estimate of local recurrence for DCIS patients following breast conserving therapy alone (25).  The 12- gene Oncotype DX DCIS Score is generated from expression levels of 
seven cancer related genes and five reference genes determined from a patient’s biopsy or surgical specimen ( 25).  The score is a continuous variable from 0 to 100.  Low -risk 
scores are 0 to 38.  Intermediate- risk scores are 39 to 54.  High- risk scores are 55 to 100.  
The score was initially validated using data from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) E51 [ADDRESS_1231301] 
conserving surgery alone.  The 10 -year risks (95%CI) of any ipsilateral breast event (local 
recurrence of DCIS or invasive carcinoma) for low, intermediate, and high risk scores 
were 10.6% (6.9- 16.2%), 26.7% (16.2 -41.9%) and 25.9% (14.8 -43%), respectively and 
3.7% (1.8 -7.7%), 12.3% (5.1- 27.8%), and 19.2% (9.5- 36.4%), respectively, for an 
invasive i psilateral breast event ( 25).  The DCIS score was further validated in a more 
diverse patient population treated with breast conserving surgery alone, the Ontario DCIS cohort (26, 27).  The 10- year risks (95% CI) of any ipsilateral breast event for these 571 
patients with low, intermediate, and high risk scores were 12.7% (9.5- 16.9%), 33.0% 
(23.6- 44.8%), and 27.8% (20.0 -37.8%), respectively (26).  Thus, this genomic test has 
been shown to provide information on local recurrence independent of traditional 
clinicopathologic factors such as age, size, and grade ( 25, 26) and has been shown to 
have clinical utility in influencing patient management ( 28, 29).  However, the test is 
expensive (~$3500) and may not be cost effective ( 30).  Furthermore, it requires a 3 -week 
turnaround time ( 29) and sufficient tissue for analysis which may introduce sampling bias.  
 An important molecular target in premalignant and malignant breast tissue is ER, which drives hormone- dependent breast tumor growth, and can be inhibited by [CONTACT_880906].  As shown in invasive breast cancer, ER appears to be an important prognostic factor and predictive biomarker for clinical benefit of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment for 
DCIS (16).  In normal breast tissue, ER is expressed in a minority of cells at low to 
moderate staining intensity.  However, very high levels of ER expression in nearly all cells are noted in most premalignant and noninvasive breast lesions (e.g. hyperplasias, atypia, lobular carcinoma in situ, and non- comedo DCIS) ( 31).  The majority of DCIS express ER 
protein (approximately 69%; range 49- 97%) (32).  The exception is high grade comedo 
DCIS which can have low or no ER expression.  Semi -quantitative ER levels measured 
by [CONTACT_880907] (33).  Interestingly, tumors cells at 
sites of focally disrupted myoepi[INVESTIGATOR_880899] (86.4%) ER-negative 
(34).   
 Expression of ER can be measured in patients through the use of a radiolabeled estrogen ligand, 16α -
18F-fluoro- 17β-estradiol (18F-FES), and positron emission tomography (PET) 
13 
 imaging (35, 36).  Tumoral 18F-FES uptake, as measured by [CONTACT_880908]/CT imaging, correlates well (r=0.56- 0.96) with ER expression in invasive breast 
cancer, as measured by [CONTACT_880909] ( 37, 38).  Overall sensitivity of 18F-FES PET for detection of ER+ breast 
cancer was 84% (95% CI:  73– 91) in four published studies involving 114 patients ( 35, 
37-40).  Overall specificity was high at 98% (95% CI:  90– 100) demonstrated by [CONTACT_880910] 18F-FES uptake (SUV max less than 1.0) in [ADDRESS_1231302] cancer in three studies ( 35, 38-40).  
 
18F-FES PET imaging has been studied as a predictive factor for clinical benefit of 
endocrine therapy in patients with metastatic ER+ breast cancer (35, 36).  Van Kruchten 
et al.  combined the results of four single- institution studies and determined that lack of 
response to endocrine therapy was predicted by 18F-FES SUV max under 1.5 in this 
heterogeneous group of ER+ patients (35).  Using the 1.[ADDRESS_1231303] had a clinical benefit (PPV of 65%).  Alternatively, of the 42 patients with 
18F-FES 
SUV below 1.5, 37 derived no clinical benefit from endocrine therapy (NPV 88%).   
 The addition of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides exquisite anatomic detail to characterize tumor morphologic characteristics and for functional assessment of lesion perfusion (41).  In addition to anatomic data, certain advanced MRI techniques, such as 
diffusion weighted imaging, has potential to distinguish low versus high risk DCIS ( 42, 
43).  The ECOG/ACRIN trial E4112 titled “Prospective Study of Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging (MRI) and Multiparameter Gene Expression Assay in Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)” is a multi -institutional study of [ADDRESS_1231304] DCE 
MRI with 18F-FES PET for quantifying ER in patients with DCIS and identifying patients 
with low- risk of disease recurrence.  If successful, we will pursue further studies using this 
imaging approach for stratifying patients with ER+ DCIS who may avoid radiation therapy (as in the E4112 study) and/or surgery (as in the COMET trial) and potentially derive the most benefit from endocrine therapy.

The primary objective is to measure 18F-FES uptake of biopsy -proven DCIS using 
PET/MRI .  The reference standard will be ER expression measured with 
immunohistochemistry.   Secondary objectives  include 1) to determine the optimal 
cut-point 18F-FES uptake value for distinguishing between ER+ and ER -negative 
DCIS; 2) t o determine the test -retest reproducibility  of quantitative assessment of 
tumor 18F-FES uptake; 3) to determine the optimal cut -point 18F-FES uptake value 
for distinguishing between low -risk DCIS and intermediate/high- risk DCIS; 4) to 
estimate the association of quantitative 18F-FES uptake (continuous SUV max) with 
research- based Oncotype DX DCIS scores (0- 100); 5) to measure the upgrade 
rate to invasive cancer at surgical excision; 6) to correlate tumor 18F-FES uptake 
with serum estradiol and sex hormone binding globulin levels.   An exploratory 
objective is to correlate tumor cell density with 18F-FES uptake on PET/MRI.  
 5.[ADDRESS_1231313] for ER Expression  
The primary objective is to measure 
18F-FES uptake of biopsy -proven DCIS using 
PET/MRI .  The reference standard will be ER  expression measured with 
immunohistochemistry  performed as per the current standard of care.    
 
ER status is reported as positive or negative and includes a percentage of cells 
staining positive as well as intensity of staining.  This information will be obtained 
from the clinical pathology report in the subjects’ electronic medical record and will 
be used to calculate a semi -quantitative Allred score ( 44).  If the information 
needed to calculate the Allred score is not included in the clinical pathology report, a pathologist on the research study team will review the existing ER IHC slides.   
 The Allred score is the sum of the proportion score and the intensity score ( Table 
1) (44).  ER- negative cancers  can have either an Allred score of 0 or 2 (1+1) .  ER -
positive cancers can have an Allred score of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.  An Allred score of [ADDRESS_1231314].

consent form will be mailed or emailed to subjects prior to the scheduled consent phone call.  
(i) Subjects who are unable to undergo a PET/MRI scan will be invited to undergo a PET/CT along 
with a separate MRI scan   
 
5.[ADDRESS_1231316] MRI  (Standard of Care)  
The clinical breast MRI will be performed and interpreted according to standard clinical practice. If additional management recommendations are generated based on the clinical breast MRI (i.e. identification of unsuspected suspi[INVESTIGATOR_880900]), the research examinations will ideally be scheduled prior to the 
date of scheduled intervention(s)  but can also be performed after a biopsy 
[ADDRESS_1231317] 
18F-FES PET/MRI  
 
5.5.1 Timing of 18F-FES PET/MRI  
Patients must complete the research breast PET/MRI study prior to 
surgical/oncologic intervention for their biopsy -proven breast cancer as part 
of their routine clinical care.   Ideally, the research breast PET/MRI study 
should be performed prior to any interventions (i.e. biopsies) prompted by 
[CONTACT_880914], but this is not required.  If patients are also scheduled for clinical nuclear medicine studies using 
99mTc-based or 18F-based radiopharmaceuticals, the research 
study should be scheduled on a separate day.  
 5.5.2 Patient Preparation  
The patient does not  need to be fasting for 18F-FES PET/MRI .  Prior to 
arrival, the patient should be well-hydrated (encourage drinking two-three 
8-12 oz glasses of water) unless a fluid- restriction diet is prescribed by [CONTACT_4677]’s treating physician (e.g., congestive heart failure).  The patient should continue to take any of their prescribed medications as scheduled by [CONTACT_24018]. 
 
Upon arrival, subject compliance with pre- procedure instructions will be 
confirmed.   Subject completion of the informed consent documentation will 
also be confirmed. The patient’s height  and weight will be measured and 
recorded.  Women with childbearing potential will be asked to confirm they 
are not pregnant. If they cannot confirm, they will have a urine pregnancy 
test either at the imaging study visit or within [ADDRESS_1231318] cancer, 
18F-FES will be given by 2 -
minute infusion, and the dose administered will be approximately 6 mCi ± 20%.  The injection site will be inspected by [CONTACT_880915].  The patient will wait approximately [ADDRESS_1231319] -infusion will be 
recorded (a phone call to the participant  performed 1 to 3 days after 
18F-
FES infusion is acceptable means of collecting this information). The 
adverse events to be specifically monitored during the infusion include localized discomfort at the IV injection site, pain, respi[INVESTIGATOR_046], flushing, dizziness, pruritus/rash, and any other symptoms that could be 
[ADDRESS_1231320] will be instructed to 
report any subjective symptoms or sensory changes noted.  
 
5.5.4 Imaging Quality Assurance (QA)/Quality Control (QC) Procedure  
QA/QC procedures will include review of DICOM files against study protocols. The PET/MRI scanner must be kept calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. The scanner should routinely be assessed for quantitative integrity and stabilit y by [CONTACT_880916] a standard phantom. For SUV measurements, this assessment should include a comparison against a dose calibrator to ensure accuracy; that is, a comparison of the absolute activity measured versus the meas ured activity injected, should be performed.  
 
A daily QC check must be performed at the beginning of the day, including PET/MRI scanner and dose calibrator, in accordance with the manufacturer recommendations. If any of the QC results are outside of the manufacturer’s guidelines, the study must be res cheduled and the problem rectified before 
scanning any patients.  
 
5.5.5 
18F-FES PET/MRI Imaging Acquisition  
Image acquisition and reconstruction protocols specific to this research study will be available in a separate “Imaging Manual”.   The protocol is 
briefly described here.  
 
The patient will be escorted to the GE Discovery 750W 3T MR scanner 
containing the PET insert and an 8- Channel breast coil qualified for 
PET/MRI  located in the basement level of  WIMR Tower 1.  Directed breast 
PET/MRI  data will be acquired with the patient in the prone positi on.  
Imaging will be performed by [CONTACT_880917]/or collaborating investigators.  MRI -sequences utilized in a 
standard clinical breast MRI will be obtained, including T2- weighted fat 
suppressed and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) prior to gadolinium contrast administration followed by T1- weighted fat suppressed DCE 
imaging.  The MRI sequences will include standard clinical sequences and may include resear ch MRI sequences under development and evaluation 
at the University of Wisconsin.  A  standard MR -based attenuation correction 
algorithm provided by [CONTACT_880918].  Breast specific 
PET emission data will be acquired simultaneous with the MR images. The entire examination is expected to take 30 – [ADDRESS_1231321] is unable to be imaged using the simultaneous PET/MRI scanner (e.g. excessive girth, technical issue with scanner performance), the subject will undergo two separate scans.  A breast MRI (approximately 30 to 40 minutes) will be performed using a 3T 
[ADDRESS_1231322] MRI scanner  (e.g. GE Signa Premier)  using MRI sequences as 
described above, and a breast specific PET/CT scan will be performed 
using a PET/CT scanner (e.g. Discovery IQ or G E Discovery 710)  located 
in the Department of Radiology in the Wisconsin Institutes for Medical 
Research (WIMR) Tower 1.  The subject  will be positioned prone with arms 
overhead.  Following a CT scout (topogram), a directed low -dose, non-
contrast, non- breathhold, non- diagnostic CT scan through the chest/breasts 
will be performed for attenuation correction calculations.  Next, a static PET 
emission scan of the thoracic region to specifically cover the breasts will be acquired in 3D acquisition mode.  The entire examination is expected to take approximately 15- [ADDRESS_1231323] MRI.  
 5.5.6 
18F-FES PET/MRI Image Analysis  
Images will be reviewed for general quality.  The known biopsy -proven 
breast cancer (s) will be identified on the MRI/PET examination based on its 
known location from the prior clinical breast MRI, if performed, or the 
patient’s previous imaging , as is typi[INVESTIGATOR_880901] .  
MRI images will be used to localize the lesion(s), measure the lesion size (in three dimensions) , and assign the region of interest ( ROI) for PET 
imaging analysis .   
  
Quantitative analysis of 
18F-FES uptake will be performed at the lesion-
level.  Standardized uptake values (SUV) will be measured by [CONTACT_880919] a region of interest (ROI) to encompass the entire lesion guided by 
[CONTACT_880920].  For the primary objective, the maximum SUV value (SUV
max) will be determined.  For potential exploratory 
analyses, additional uptake values may include SUV peak (small fixed -size 
ROI centered on most intense part of tumor), SUV mean (average value), 
SUV min (minimum value), SUV sd (standard deviation), tumor -to-normal 
tissue uptake ratios, FTV (functional tumor volume; i.e. the volume of tumor tissue with increased 
18F-FES uptake) and TLU (total lesion uptake; i.e. the 
product of FTV × SUV mean).  A research workstation/software (e.g. Mirada 
Medical) will be used to perform these advanced quantitative techniques.     
 
5.6 Clinical Laboratory Testing 
A blood sample is to be obtained at the time of imaging (drawn prior to 18F-FES 
injection) and submitted for hormonal analysis (estradiol and sex hormone binding 
globulin) by [CONTACT_880921].  Results from the UW Health clinical 
laboratory automatically post to the subjects’ medical records.  
 
5.7 Risk Assessment  
Clinicopathologic -based r isk scores will be calculated using the University of 
Southern [LOCATION_004]/Van Nuys Prognostic Index (21) and the Memorial Sloan-
Kettering Cancer Center Nomogram ( 22). 
[ADDRESS_1231324] 
(25, 26).  The risk score (0- 100) is generated from expression levels of seven 
cancer related genes and five reference genes ( Table 3) determined from a 
patient’s biopsy or surgical specimen ( 25).  Scores are further categorized as low -
risk (0 -38), intermediate- risk (39 -54), and high- risk (55 -100).  Since utilization of 
the Oncotype DX DCIS score for clinical care is variable (only 1- 5% of DCIS 
patients locally) , we will perform an equivalent “research- based” assay using 
previously published methods (45).  Tissue blocks from the surgical specimen will 
be identified and used for RNA isolation performed by [CONTACT_880922] (TRIP) Lab.  The Fowler lab will then perform 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) published by [CONTACT_642441] ( 46) and 
will follow the algorithm of Solin et al ( 25) to calculate the genomic -based risk 
score.  Results of this research assay will not be used to guide clinical management .  A batched analysis will be performed after all subjects are enrolled 
for those with sufficient remaining tissue.

 5.8 Repeatability  
18F-FES PET/MRI (Optional)  
Up to 5  patients with ER+  DCIS who agree to participate in this optional portion of 
the study  will undergo a second (test -retest) 18F-FES PET/ MRI examination.  The 
test-retest exam  cannot be performed the same day but should be completed prior 
to any therapy or surgical excision.  This will not delay any scheduled routine standard of care therapy or procedures for the patient.   This optional sub- study will 
be offered to all patients at the time of consent until we have accrued up to 5 
patients  with ER+ DCIS.  
6. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES 
Patients must not start protocol procedures prior to registration.   Patients mus t complete 
the breast  PET/MRI study  prior to surgical/oncologic intervention for their biopsy -proven 
breast cancer as part of their routine clinical care.  
 
6.1 Patient Recruitment  
Potentially eligible patients can be identified by [CONTACT_880923]:  study coordinator(s) who have access to the clinical breast MRI schedule and the 
schedules from other providers that serve this patient population (e.g. surgeons) , 
radiologists who are protocoling clinical breast MRI exams in advance, from 
patients presented at our weekly multidisciplinary and radiologic -pathologic 
22 
 concordance conferences, and/or through automatic search results of the 
electronic medical record provided by [CONTACT_880924](s) and study coordinator(s) via REDCap database.  The breast imaging radiologist performing radiologic -pathologic 
concordance after biopsy can also flag patients as potentially eligible.  
 Recruitment flyers will also be posted in clinics that serve this patient population.  Patients interested in learning more about the research will be required to respond to a research team member(s) noted on the flyer.  
 Study eligibility will be based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria and will be determined by [CONTACT_880925](s) and/or study coordinator(s).  If a patient is potentially eligible for the study, the study coordinator will contact [CONTACT_880926].  If the patient is interested in the study, the study coordinator will describe the study in more detail and/or record the subject’s preferred contact [CONTACT_880927] -up with the patient by [CONTACT_880928].  If they choose, an encrypted version of the 
consent form will be emailed to them to allow additional time to review the form.  If the patient indicates they are interested in proceeding with the study, scheduling for 
18F-FES production with the Radiopharmaceutical Production Facility will be 
coordinated with the patient’s clinical breast MRI appointment.  
 If the patient is uncertain about participating in the study, they can be offered the contact [CONTACT_880929] (BCRAN) to use as a resource for general information 
about participating in clinical research . 
 The consent process will occur prior to the administration of research procedures.  During the COVID -[ADDRESS_1231325] preferences and capabilit ies: 
• Electronic signature [CONTACT_93369]  
• Subject will be asked to scan a copy of the entire consent document and email it back to the study team.  
• Subject will be asked to take a photo of the signature [CONTACT_93370] a copy to the study team.  
23 
 • If subjects are unable to provide an electronic copy of the signed consent 
form, they will be asked to bring a copy of the form to the research visit.    
   
 Once institutional requirements are met, remote consenting may  continue by 
[CONTACT_880930].  
 6.[ADDRESS_1231326]’s questions.  The information in the consent form, including study procedures, risks associated with participation, alternatives to participation and whom to contact [CONTACT_93362], will be reviewed.  Any questions will be addressed prior to the start of any research procedures and all subjects  will be reminded that participation is optional and they 
can change their mind at any time and still get clinically required testing completed.  
Those interested in participating will be asked to sign informed consent and HIPAA 
authorization and the subject will be enrolled in the research study.   Subjects will 
be assigned a unique ID number.  Both t he MRI screening questionnaire as well 
as the PET screening questionnaire will be reviewed  to confirm eligibility criteria .

7. TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
This is an o bservational study  and the results of the 18F-FES PET/MRI will not be used to 
change patient  therapy.   The results of the research studies will not be reported by a 
radiologist, will not be part of the patient’s medical record, and will not be available to the 
patient or their physician.  The exception is if the breast MRI component of the breast 
PET/MRI is  used as the patient’s clinical examination, then interpretation of the breast 
MRI and management recommendations will be made based on routi ne clinical practice.  
No medications will be administered as pa rt of the study protocol except intrav enous 
injection of a gadolinium -based contrast agent for MRI and 18F-FES PET tracer required 
for PET imaging.

 8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
8.1 Purpose  
Adverse event (AE) data collection and reporting, which are required as part 
of every clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of the patients enrolled, as well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents.  
 
8.2 Terminology  
• Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. Therefore, an AE can be ANY unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
• Attribution: An assessment of the relationship between the adverse 
event and the protocol treatment, using the following categories.  
ATTRIBUTION DESCRIPTION 
Unrelated  The AE is clearly NOT  related to 
treatment.  
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related to 
treatment.  
Possible  The AE may be related to treatment.  
Probable  The AE is likely related  to treatment.  
Definite  The AE is clearly related  to treatment.  
• CAEPR ( Comprehensive Adverse Events and P otential Risks List):  
An NCI generated list of reported and/or potential AEs associated with an agent currently under an NCI IND. Information contained in the CAEPR is compi[INVESTIGATOR_311289]’s Brochure, the Package Insert, as well as company safety reports.  
• CT
CAE:  The NCI C ommon Terminology Criteria for A dverse Events 
provides a descriptive terminology that is to be utilized for AE reporting. A grade (severity) is provided for each AE term.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]): For AE reporting 
purposes, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240542] 24 hours.  
• Life Threatening Adverse Event:  Any AE that places the subject at 
immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred.  
• Serious Adverse Event (SAE): Any adverse event occurring at any dose that results in ANY of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse event  
26 
 • Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
(for ≥ 24 hours).  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious 
when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
8.3 Reporting Procedure  
Per 21CFR312.32(c), all adverse events deemed both serious and 
unexpected associated with the use of the drug must be reported to the FDA and to all participating investigators as soon as possible and in no event later than 1 5 days.  
 The FDA will be notified of any unexpected fatal or life threatening experience associated with the drug as soon as possible but in no event 
later than 7 calendar  days.  The University of Wisconsin Health Sciences -
IRB will be notified in accordance with posted institutional policy.  
 Serious and Non- Serious Adverse events will be recorded, regardless of 
whether or not they are thought to be related to the investigational imaging  
tracer.  While all adverse events will be tabulated and reported in the study final report, serious adverse events will be reported in the course of the trial.  Adverse events that  meet criteria of a serious adverse event listed above 
will also be recorded and reported.  
 The Investigator will inform the IRB of all adverse events attributed to the investigational imaging tracer in accordance with posted institutional policy.  
 
8.4 Additional Adverse Event Information 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:   The descriptions and grading 
scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version [ADDRESS_1231330] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5 .0.  
A copy of the CTCAE version 5 .0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web 
site

m 
 The following adverse event information was obtained from the NCI.  
 
[ADDRESS_1231331] – 18F-FES PET  
POSSIBLE, SOME MAY BE SERIOUS  
• Swelling and redness at the site of the medication injection  
• Changes in taste  
 
The only adverse events that have been attributed to PET imaging with 
diagnostic 18F-FES at the levels described in the Investigators Brochure 
have been mild transient disturbances in taste.  Therefore, no significant 
adverse events are expected as a result of the intravenous (IV) administration of 
18F-FES for typi[INVESTIGATOR_452195].  
 
As with any IV administered agent , 18F-FES could cause an allergic reaction 
that could potentially pose a threat to life (anaphylaxis).  This has not been 
observed in reported human exposure to date.  Reasonable precautions 
should be taken, consistent with normal radiologic and clinical facility practice.  The patient should be monitored until the PET procedure is completed, and trained personnel and emergency equipment should b e 
available per facility standards.  
 
For purposes of informed consent regarding reasonably foreseeable risks 
to subjects in trials utilizing 
18F-FES, the following potential adverse events 
are considered extremely rare:  
• Injection- related risks that may include infection, or accidental 
extravasation of the dose that may lead to discomfort, localized pain, or infection.  
• Risks related to allergic reaction/anaphylaxis that may be life threatening.  
 
As with all PET imaging agents, 
18F-FES is a radiopharmaceutical that 
decays with positron emission.  As such, it poses an intrinsic radiation exposure risk.  However, when administered in accordance with the Investigator’s Brochure as a PET imaging agent, this risk is felt to be extremely small.  The organ and total body doses associated with 
18F-FES 
PET imaging are comparable to or lower than those associated with other widely used clinical nuclear medicine procedures.   
 
18F-FES in combination with other agents could cause an exacerbation of 
any adverse event currently known to be caused by [CONTACT_6767], or the combination may result in events never previously associated with either agent.

therapy . 
 
10. STUDY PARAMETERS 
Information regarding time intervals for performance of the study and c ontact points is 
included as T able [ADDRESS_1231333] agent  
Gadobenate dimuglumine (MultiHance) is the gadolinium -based 
intravenous contrast agent used for the MRI portion of this study.  It will be 
obtained from a commercial source (e.g. Bracco Diagnostics, Inc).  This agent is used routinely in standard clini cal practice at our institution.  Please 
refer to package insert for  more comprehensive information.  
 
11.2 16α-[
18F]-fluoro- 17β-estradiol (18F-FES)  
18F-FES is the radiopharmaceutical  which will be used for this study.   For 
complete information, please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure:   
“[18F]Fluoroestradiol: An investigational positron emission tomography 
(PET) radiopharmaceutical for injection, intended for use as an in vivo diagnostic for imaging estrogen receptors in tumors ( NCI-held IND 79,005)”, 
Edition Number 4, Edition date 2011.  
 
11.2.1 Other Names  
[F-18]FES, FES  
 
11.2.2 Classification  
Investigational new drug: Radiopharmaceutical/radiotracer  
In May 2020, 
18F-FES was approved by [CONTACT_880931] “CERIANNA” , but the labelled indication for clinical use is for 
a different breast cancer patient population (recurrent or metastatic) 
than included in this research study  (DCIS) .  Thus, we will continue 
to perform this research study under our existing approved IND.  
 
11.2.3 Mode of Action 
18F-FES binds to ER  alpha with a binding affinity nearly identical to 
estradiol.  18F-FES binding to sex steroid binding protein (SBP or 
SHBG) is also similar to that of estradiol, providing equivalent transport to sites of ER expression, including tumor sites.  In breast 
cancer, the uptake of 
18F-FES, measured by [CONTACT_880932] /CT, 
has been shown to correlate with ER expression in biopsy material assayed by [CONTACT_880933].  
[ADDRESS_1231334] 
prior to release for human administration.  Once delivered, doses will 
be stored in the appropriate storage area in the nuclear medicine facility until they are administered to the patient. The drug solution is stored at room temperature in a gray butyl septum sealed, sterile, 
pyrogen- free glass v ial with an expi[INVESTIGATOR_375285] 6  hours.  
 
11.2.5 Dose Specifics  
The injected dose of 
18F-FES will be 6 mCi ( 222 MBq) ± 20% with a 
specific activity greater than 170 Ci/mmol at the time of injection for 
an activity dose of 6 mCi.  In all cases, less than 5 μg of 18F-FES 
should be injected. 18F-FES is the only active ingredient. There is no 
evidence that nonradioactive and radioactive FES molecules display different biochemical behavior.  
 
11.2.6 Preparation 
Fluorine- 18 labeled FES is synthesized with high specific activity so 
the quantity of estrogenic material injected with the radiopharmaceutical is ≤ 5 μg (≤ 17 nmol).  For a 6 mCi dose, this 
would be 170 Ci/mmol.  Between 3 and 6 mCi of [
18F]FES is 
administered in a nominal volume of 1 0 mL of phosphate buffered 
saline containing less than 15% ethanol (v:v) for a single PET scan.  
 
Specific manufacturing processes will follow our approved Drug Master File for 
18F-FES.  Briefly, [18F]FES is purified by [CONTACT_880934] 50% ethanol, USP in sterile water for injection. The final product [
18F]FES with a total volume of 10 mL is formulated in 10% 
ethanol for injection, USP and 0.075M saline for injection, USP, buffered with 0.075M sodium phosphates injection, USP. The concentration of ethanol in the final injectate is less than 15% by [CONTACT_8544], or a maximum of 1.5 mL of ethanol. This is less than one-
sixth of the amount of ethanol in one alcoholic drink and < 0.025 mL/kg (< 0.02g/kg) for a standard 56.8- kg woman.  
 
11.2.7 Route of Administration 
18F-FES is a sterile, intravenously (IV) injectable solution in a volume 
of ≤ 10 mL containing of 0.15 M phosphate buffered saline: < 15% 
ethanol (v:v).  Prior studies have shown that this volume of injectate 
infused over 2 minutes is well tolerated and minimizes local saturation of SHBG which could limit systemic delivery of 
18F-FES.  
 
11.2.8 Incompatibilities  
N/A 
30 
  
11.2.9 Availability  
cGMP -grade 18F-FES will be  manufactured on- site in the UW -
Madison Radiopharmaceutical Production Facility.  This facility has  
been qualified and approved for production by [CONTACT_880935] (CIP) and ECOG -ACRIN for other FES clinical trials .  The 
investigational pharmacist or qualified nuclear medicine technologist will be the responsible party designated by [CONTACT_093].  
 
11.2.10 Side Effects  
See Section 8.4 for side effects. The radiation absorbed effective 
dose equivalent to the whole body from intravenously injected 
18F-
FES is estimated to be 0.022 mSv/MBq (488 mrem for a 6 mCi  
injection). The critical organ is the liver, with an average absorbed dose of 0.13 mGy/MBq. The organ and total body doses associated with 
18F-FES PET imaging are comparable to or lower than those 
associated with other widely used clinical nuclear medicine procedures and are well below the maximum suggested individual study and annual total body dose of 30 and 50 mGy, respectively, suggested for investigational radiopharmaceuticals by [CONTACT_1622].  
 11.2.11 Nursing/Patient Implications  
Standard safety precautions required when handling radioactive materials (predominantly during the injection and uptake period) should be followed. 
18F-FES requirements are similar to those used 
for other PET tracers, such as 18F-FDG.  
 
11.3 Cerianna (fluoroestradiol F- 18) 
If scheduling conflicts do not permit use of locally produced 18F-FES, then 
commercially available 18F-FES (CERIANNA) will be obtained which is FDA 
approved for patients with recurrent or metastatic ER+ breast cancer  and is 
being used in a manner that is consistent with its approval . 
 The use of this product in research is consistent with the criteria for IND exemption in accordance with 21 CFR 312.2(b)(1). Cerianna is a lawfully marketed drug,  and this research is not intended to support a new indication 
or new product labeling.   
 
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
12.1 Primary Objective  
To compare quantitative 
18F-FES uptake of biopsy -proven DCIS measured 
using PET/MRI with ER protein levels determined by 
[CONTACT_9064].  
 
31 
 The primary objective is to compare 18F-FES SUV max from PET/MR I with 
the ER immunohistochemistry  semi -quantitative score obtained by  [CONTACT_880936] .  We will test the hypothesis that 18F-FES SUV max from 
PET/MRI  correlates well against the ER IHC Allred score .  The correlation 
of the two measures will be evaluated using Spearman correlation.  The null 
hypothesis is H 0: p0=0.00 and the alternative hypothesis is H 1: p1 =0.73. 
 
A sample size of 12 patients achieves 82 % power (β=0.20) for detecting an 
expected correlation coefficient (r=0.73) to be significantly different from zero with two -tailed α value of 0.05 (http://www.sample- size.net/correlation-
sample- size/).    We anticipate enrolling [ADDRESS_1231335]  every 1 -2 month s.  The 
number of subjects with ER -negative DCIS will be limited to ≤ 3. 
 
Other measures of 
18F-FES uptake including SUV peak, SUV mean, tumor- to-
normal tissue uptake ratio, and total lesion uptake will also be correlated 
with the ER  immunohistochemistry semi -quantitative score obtained by 
[CONTACT_880937].     
 
12.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
1. To determine the optimal cut -point 18F-FES uptake value for 
distinguishing between ER+ and ER -negative DCIS.  
 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis will be performed to determine the optimal cut -point for 
18F-FES uptake to 
distinguish ER+ from ER- negative DCIS, as defined by [CONTACT_880938].  The area under the curve (AUC)  for the ROCs and 
their respective two- sided 95% confidence intervals will be 
calculated using logistic regression.   The optimal cut -off point will be 
determined by [CONTACT_880939] 18F-FES uptake value with the 
maximum sensitivity and specificity .   
 
2. To determine the test -retest reproducibility  of quantitative 
assessment of tumor 18F-FES uptake.  
 The reproducibility of the two measurements  (test- retest) of 
18F-FES 
uptake in the subjects (up to 5) who elect to undergo a second 
imaging session will be assessed by [CONTACT_90169]- class correlation 
coefficient (ICC) and its 95% confidence interval  (47). Additionally, 
the coefficient of repeatability (CR) and the Bland- Altman plot will be 
used (48). 
 
3. To determine the optimal cut -point 18F-FES uptake value for 
distinguishing between low -risk DCIS and intermediate/high- risk 
DCIS.  
 
32 
 ROC curve  analysis will be performed to determine the optimal cut -
point for 18F-FES SUV max to distinguish low- risk DCIS and 
intermediate/high- risk DCIS.   Risk categories will be determined 
using the Van Nuys Prognostic Index, the Memorial Sloan- Kettering 
Cancer Center Nomogram, and the research- based Oncotype DX 
DCIS score.  Sensitivity and specificity will be determined with two -
sided 95% confidence intervals.  The AUCs for the ROCs and their 
respective two- sided 95% confidence intervals will be calculated 
using logistic regression.    
The optimal cut -off point will be determined by [CONTACT_880939] 18F-
FES uptake value with the maximum sensitivity and specificity .   
This analysis will be done separately for each risk assessment model . 
 
4. To estimate the association of quantitative 
18F-FES uptake 
(continuous SUV max) with research- based Oncotype DX DCIS 
scores (0 -100). 
 
Scatter plots of continuous quantitative 18F-FES uptake (SUV max) on 
the y -axis and research- based Oncotype DX DCIS scores (unitless) 
on the x -axis will be created to explore the distribution of the 
measurements.  Pearson’s or Spearman’s r ank correlation will be 
used to evaluate the association between quantitative 18F-FES 
uptake and research- based Oncotype DX DCIS score. The 
correlation coefficient (rho)  and 95% confidence interval  will be 
reported.    
 
5. To determine the upgrade rate to invasive cancer at surgical 
excision.  
 This percentage will be calculated by [CONTACT_880940] -proven DCIS in 
the study.  
 
6. To correlate tumor 
18F-FES uptake with serum estradiol and sex 
hormone binding globulin levels.  
 A correlation analysis of serum estradiol and sex hormone binding globulin levels will be performed using Pearson’s or Spearman’s r ank 
correlation.  Scatter plots, correlation coefficient s (rho) and 95% 
confidence intervals  will be reported.   
 
12.3 Secondary Objectives  
To correlate tumor cell density with 
18F-FES uptake on PET/MRI.  A strong 
correlation between tumor cell density and detection by 18F-FDG PET/CT 
33 
 imaging has been reported ( 49).  A correlation analysis of tumor 18F-FES 
uptake and tumor cell density  will be performed using Pearson’s or 
Spearman’s rank correlation.  Scatter plots, correlation coefficients (rho) 
and 95% confidence intervals will be reported.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_1231336] of care (histologic diagnosis, grade, tumor biomarker 
status ).  ER status is reported as positive or negative and includes a 
percentage of cells staining positive as well as intensity of staining.  This information will be obtained from the clinical pathology report  in the subjects’ 
electronic medical record and will be used to calculate a semi -quantitative 
Allred score ( 44).  If the information needed to calculate the Allred score is 
not included in the clinical pathology report, a pathologist on the research study team will review the existing ER IHC slides.   If the information needed 
to determine tumor cell density is not included in the clinical pathology report, a pathologist on the research study team will review the existing H&E slides.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_1231337].   
Existing pathology slides (ER IHC and H&E) from the breast biopsy used for initial diagnosis will be requested from the Department of Pathology for 
Allred scoring by [CONTACT_880941] . 
 
For the research- based Oncotype DX DCIS score, a study pathologist will 
review the H&E slides from the surgical specimen and select a block for 
release to the TRIP Laboratory .  We anticipate needing [ADDRESS_1231338].

 14. RECORDS TO BE KEPT  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_880902].  The following types of data 
and materials will be collected:  
 
14.1 Images  
Images from the PET/MRI  examinations will be stored on the local pi[INVESTIGATOR_659456] (PACS) (McKesson, San Francisco, CA).  The local 
PACS system is password protected behind the UWHC Department of Radiology firewall.   
 14.[ADDRESS_1231339] ’s experimental bill of rights, and a signed 
HIPAA form.  Research charts will be kept in a locked file cabinet  within a study 
team members secure office .  An enrollment log will be maintained.  The 
enrollment log will confirm that informed consent was obtained on each subject.   
The patient has the right to decline to participate in the study and to request removal  from the study at any time.  Informed consent will be provided and signed 
prior to enrollment in the study.  Patients may refuse to answer any questions 
asked during the duration of the study if they are too uncomfortable to answer.  All of these potential risks wi ll be described to the patient in the informed consent 
document.  
 
14.[ADDRESS_1231340] of 
1996 (HIPAA). Subjects will be assigned a unique study number upon enrollment that will be used to label their research data in lieu of directly identifiable 
information.  All subject  data collected during participation in the study will be kept 
in a locked file cabinet  within a secure office  or a password- protected database  
that uses departmental servers  and will only be accessible to study team members .  
After the study is completed, all data will be de- identified  for the purposes of 
research presentations/publications .  The study breast MRI examinations will be 
archived on the standard clinical PACS system which is password protected behind the UWHC firewall.   The study data and records will be maintained for up 
to [ADDRESS_1231341] of the study or protocol, review of adverse events tracking and reporting, and review of drug production and acco untability.  
 These tools include:  
• Study visit checklists –  Research Coordinators use study visit checklists, 
developed in conjunction with the PI, to ensure that all study required procedures and processes are met before, during and after the subject has been enrolled. Items listed on these checklists include informed consent obtained, consent questions answered (and by [CONTACT_20898]), medications reviewed, MR safety form, etc. These checklists are completed and reviewed by [CONTACT_880942] .  
 
• Safety monitoring –  The safety monitoring of subjects enrolled in the research 
includes both internal and external safety checks governing the administration of  
18F-fluoroestradiol (FES) . Internal monitoring is performed by [CONTACT_3252]- investigators and 
external monitoring by a team of four physicians, scientists, and staff with the appropriate broad clinical and technical expertise. The internal monitoring plan 
includes a brief review of each subject visit after it occurs.  In this regard, the study 
team will discuss data quality, 
18F-FES production and administration, and subject 
compliance and tolerance of research procedures.  
 The external monitoring plan includes a 4- person committee of physicians, 
scientists, and staff with the appropriate expertise (nuclear medicine, oncology, research nurse manager, medical physics) that meets annually with representatives from the research team, to discuss research progress, AE reports, 
as well as other data reports (note- to-file documentation, protocol deviations, 
reportable events) compi[INVESTIGATOR_880903].  If an AE occurs, an ad hoc 
committee meeting will be organized to discuss whether the event is considered serious, whether it can be attributed to research procedures, whether it constitutes an unanticipated problem or non- compliance on the part of the study team, and 
the plan for resolution and a future remediation.  
 
As part of this plan, the monitor(s) will verify that:  
• The rights and well -being of human subjects are protected  
• Reported study data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source 
documents  
• The conduct of the study is in compliance with the currently approved 
protocol, GCPs, applicable regulatory requirements, and guidelines for 
clinical research studies at the University of Wisconsin- Madison and its 
affiliates  
[ADDRESS_1231342] PET/MRI .  Injection 
of gadolinium contrast has common mild side effects, including nausea, headache, and hives.  More serious reactions, while rare, can occur, including allergic reactions.  Any significant allergic reaction or contrast extravasation will be moni tored and treated appropriately by [CONTACT_45914].   
 All hardware used to obtain MR images is FDA approved and will be used in accordance with the conditions approved by [CONTACT_8415].  The investigational 
software being used in image acquisition is designed to stay within the 
current guidelines for MRI safety, established by [CONTACT_1622].  In addition, the investigational software does not meet the definition of a Significant Risk 
Device as outlined by [CONTACT_93364] 21 CFR 812.3 as being:  
• Intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;  
• Purported or represented to be for use supporting or sustaining 
human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, 
safety or welfare of a subject;  
• For a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, 
or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a subject; or  
• Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.  
 
16.1.[ADDRESS_1231343] cancer patients participating in clinical trials  
worldwide as of 2013.  In May 2020, 18F- FES was approved by [CONTACT_880943] “CERIANNA”, but the labelled indication for clinical use is for a different breast cancer patient population (recurrent or metastatic) than included in this research study (DCIS).  Thus, we will continue to perform this research study under our existing approved IND .  
The only adverse events that have been attributed to 
18F-FES at the levels 
described in the Investigators Brochure have been mild transient disturbances in taste and injection site pain.   
 
Risks associated with PET imaging result primarily from the radiation dose 
from the radiopharmaceutical .  For this research  study , approximately  [ADDRESS_1231344] 
dose used for other clinical trials  using 18F-FES.   The radiation absorbed 
effective dose equivalent to the whole body from intravenously injected FES 
37 
 is estimated to be 0.022 mSv/MBq ( 4.88 mSv for a 6  mCi injection).  The 
critical organ is the liver, with an average absorbed dose of 0.13 mGy/MBq.  
For context, the average person in the [LOCATION_002] receives an estimated 
effective dose of about 3 mSv per year from naturally occurring radioactive 
materials, such as radon and radiation from outer space.  The organ and total body doses associated with FES PET imaging are comparable to or lower than those associated with other widely used clinical nuclear medicine procedures and are well below the maximum suggested individual study and annual total body dose of 30 and 50 mGy, respectively, suggested for 
investigational radiopharmaceuticals by [CONTACT_1622]  (50). 
 
16.1.3 Unexpected findings  
All patients in this study will receive the clinical “ gold standard” , diagnostic 
breast MRI  and ER measurement via IHC , as part of their clinical care as a 
requirement for  enrollment in the study.  Thus , the breast specific  
18F-FES 
PET data is not expected to yield any unexpected findings . Subjects will not 
be informed of any unexpected findings on the 18F-FES PET/MRI  imaging.      
16.1.4 CT (performed only in rare instance when subject is unable to be 
imaged using the simultaneous PET/MRI scanner ) 
Risks associated with  CT include exposure to 1.[ADDRESS_1231345] PET/CT is 
approximately 6.5 mSv .  This corresponds to approximately 2  years of 
natural background radiation and remains well below the annual 
occupational dose limit for radiation workers.  
 
Additionally, s ubjects may experience discomfort while lying in the PET/CT 
scanner.

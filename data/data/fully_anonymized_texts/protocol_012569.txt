Losartan COVID -19 | V5.0 | 27 APR 2020  Background 
 
As of March 11, 2020, COVID -19 caused by t he coronavirus SARS -CoV-2 reached pandemic status. 
Worldwide, there are 121, 564 confirmed cases with 4,373  deaths and both numbers are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_3408]. While our 
understanding of the disease continues to increase, the clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_401489]:1 
median age is 47 years  (41.9% females) , most common symptoms are f ever (88.7% during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) and 
cough (67.8%) , radiographic findings include ground- glass opacities on CT  scans  (56.4%) , and l ymphocytopenia 
(83.2% ), ICU admissions are required in 6.1%  of the cases  with 2.3% needing mechanical ventilation and 1.4% 
are dying. In Italy, the numbers are slightly different: median age 65, up to 15% ICU admissions, and current 
death rate up to 6%.  
As the name [CONTACT_401521], death is usually associated with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]. Thus, the question is 
how to mitigate the development of lung disease in COVID -19 since no SARS- CoV-2, FDA approved  
therapeutics are available as yet . While trials wi th anti-viral and other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_401490], e.g., 
remdesivir2 and chloroquine3, additional safe and nontoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_401491]. We therefore propose a proof of concept clinical trial with losartan  to block angiotensin II type 1 
receptors  (AT1R) in the lung of patients with  worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_401492] -CoV-2.  
Arguments  to use angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)  for persons with COVID -[ADDRESS_506289] two opi[INVESTIGATOR_10162] .4, 5 More importantly the premise is based on scientific data assembled over years in 
multiple models of viral pneumonia. Like other coronaviruses, SARS -CoV-2 infects cells by [CONTACT_401506]- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),6, 7 a protein highly expressed in the lung.8 The enzyme is thereby 
[CONTACT_401507]- angiotensin axis that results in 
more angiotensin II9 and less angiotensin 1 –7, a vasodilator. This finding was confirmed in the systemic 
circulation of patients with H7N9 influenza in whom elevated plasma angiotensin II is associated with worse 
outcome .10 Disproportionate AT1R stimulation has been shown to mediate pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_401493]1R 
blockade or knockdown is associated with better outcomes in animal models.11, 12 Furthermore, ACE2 null  mice 
develop an angiotensin II -mediated cardiomyopathy through unopposed stimulation of AT1R.13 
Since AT1R blockade increases ACE2,14-16 one could be concerned about possibly worsening viral entry with 
worsening outcome. In this context, hypertension is a risk factor for severe COVID -19 disease and hypertension 
rates  are high in C hina. However, ARBs are not commonly used in China to treat hypertension .17 In addition and 
maybe paradoxically, ACE2 upregulation may still be  beneficial in disease models ,18 possibly  by [CONTACT_401508] 1–[ADDRESS_506290] losartan in a Phase I proof of concept and safety trial. The primary hypothesis 
to be tested is that losartan treatment is safe in the setting of acute SARS -CoV-2 infection. Secondarily, losartan 
can potentially reduce the length of respi[INVESTIGATOR_401494] -CoV-2.  
 
Significance  
Importance of the problem : As outline d above, there is currently no data that support s specific treatment 
options for respi[INVESTIGATOR_401495] -19. There are active or soon to be active clinical trials that may show 
promise in this space such as blocking IL- 6 with tocilizumab
20 or using hydroxychloroquine. None of these 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_401496].  
  
Approach and Protocol  
 This is an open label, phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety of losartan in respi[INVESTIGATOR_61491] -
19.  
 
Clinical Trial setup:   
Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below. Briefly, 50  patients with COVID -19 and respi[INVESTIGATOR_401497] 25 mg daily on study 
day 0. If parameters are met the dose of losartan will be increased to 50 mg on study day 3 . Participa nts will 
continue losartan until they experience resolution of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (normal oxygen levels on room air), are discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], meet stoppage criteria (detailed below) or complete 14 days of therapy.

Radiographic imaging will be recorded upon presentation and subsequently thereafter as indicated.  
 
Monitor for deteriorating acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_401500].  
 
Study procedures (see schematic)  
Day 0  
• Labs collected for routine clinical care and the medical record will be reviewed to screen for eligibility. 
Assuring pre -menopausal women have a negative pregnancy  test.  
• Consenting participants who meet enrollment criteria will be started on losartan 25 mg once daily per 
mouth.  
• Treatment group will have nasaopharyngeal swab and research plasma collected for analysis.  
• Control group will be followed only for data collection until study completion.  
 
Day 1 -2; 
• Monitor subject for safety and losartan stoppage criteria. 
• For participants following inclusion criteria #5: Day [ADDRESS_506293] dose of SOC losartan administration.  
 Day 3:  
• Dose escalation:  On study day 3 if none of the parameters listed  below are met the dose of losartan will 
be increased to 50 mg once daily.  
 Day 4  until study completion:  
• Monitor subject for safety and losartan stoppage criteria. 
• Treatment group will have nasopharyngeal swab and research plasma collected at end of study. 
 
Stoppage criteria for losartan  
• Hyperkalemia (persistent values >5.[ADDRESS_506294] 2 readings).  
• Worsening renal function (Cockcroft -Gault < 30 mL/min/1.73 m
2) or urinary output <20 mL/h . 
• Skin rashes, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_401501] (interference with usual daily activities) without clear explanation should warrant immediate cessation of treatment and notification of study personnel.  
• Development of sustained hypotension defined as SBP <90 mmHg, DBP <[ADDRESS_506295] two readings 30 min apart or use of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] >0.1 µ g/kg/min.  
 
Losartan COVID -19 | V5.0 | 27 APR 2020  • Any change in monitor lab parameters deemed significant and potentially related to study drug by [CONTACT_3786].  
 
Dose de- escalation criteria 
• Any change in monitoring parameter after dose increase from 25 mg to 50 mg that is considered 
significant by [CONTACT_401511] a decrease dose back to 25  mg 
• If abnormal parameter is resolved and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], is unlikely to be related to 
losartan will increase dose back to 50 mg 
• If de-escalation criteria is met after re challenging 50mg dose, the dose will be once more decreased to 
25mg until the end of the study.  
 
Criteria for resum ing after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
• If stoppage criteria ha ve resolved and reason for stoppage is felt to be  unlikely or possibly related to 
losartan, discussion of  resumption of losartan with medical monitor  
• Dose resumption will start at 25 mg. If stopped at 25 mg  the dose will be continued for three days 
followed by [CONTACT_401512] [ADDRESS_506296] medical information relating to safety criteria on historical controls treated at the University of Kansas 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385683] 30 days prior to the study start dat e (3/25/2020)  and during the study period. These controls will 
be retrospectively identified through query of the electronic health record. We will attempt to include controls that 
meet all criteria for enrollment into the study but to achieve a ratio of controls to study participants of 2:1 may 
need include some with exclusion criteria (excluding prior ACE inhibitor or ARB use). C ontrols identified 
retrospectively will no t undergo informed consent as this represents minimal risk.   
 
 
Losartan COVID -19 | V5.0 | [ADDRESS_506297] on blood pressure. The proposed starting dose of losartan is 25 mg orally per 
day with increase to 50 mg orally per day on day 3 if tolerated until they patient is discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
met stoppage criteria (above) or completed [ADDRESS_506298] common side effects are fatigue and dizziness. Serious adverse events that are rare include 
angioedema, hypotension, renal dysfunction or failure, blood dyscrasias, hepatitis, or rhabdomyolysis. The following are meant to mitigate risk to the subjects: Dosing will be done in an inpatient setting wi th clinically 
indicated close observations of blood pressure and  organ dysfunction (blood work). Subjects with hyperkalemia, 
renal dysfunction, or who are taking potassium supplements will not be enrolled into the study. Participants will be given written descriptions of potential side effects and potential responses to the side effects.  
 
Sample size  and Statistics  
Since there is no information on the effects of losartan in human beings suffering from COVID -19, a statistical 
analysis based on efficacy is not possible. From a safety perspective, we would accept considering losartan equivalent or superior to the comparison group not receiving losartan (historical or no consent) if there is a ±20% 
difference in total AE/SAEs. Historical controls will be matched with study participants based on upon age, sex 
and disease severity in a 2:1 ratio for safety comparison. From  a safety perspective, losartan’ s long track record 
as a safe medication is reassuring. See section on DSMB for further details on safety monitoring and analysis.   
 
Confidentiality  
All information provided by [CONTACT_401513], and all information that is collected about the 
subjects by [CONTACT_473], shall be kept confidential to the extent that is provided by [CONTACT_2371]. Computer data files 
will be stored and backup up to secure, HIPPA compliant, password protected computers and servers. Electronic 
data capture into REDCap system will be used. Access to these  databases will be restricted to individuals 
associated with the study who require access to the data t o perform their duties. These individuals will be named 
by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_401502]. The subject's actual identity cannot be ascertained exclusively from these data and the subject's name [CONTACT_401522].  All 
investigators and staff involved in the research protocol will be bound by [CONTACT_401514].  
 
Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation  
Definition of an Adverse Event  
For the purpose of this protocol, an AE  will be defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during 
the study listed under DMSB - An ticipated Adverse Events and Grading Scale section of this protocol as well 
as safety monitoring data listed on table [ADDRESS_506299] completes study 
participation.  
Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
•  Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after participation in 
the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study drug)  
•  Life -threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred  
•  Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_401503] -19 | V5.0 | 27 APR 2020  •  Persist ent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person ’s

Pregnancy  
Female subjects will be tested for pregnancy by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_41361]. If pregnant they will be excluded.  
 
It is not expected that a female subject becomes pregnant while participating in the study. In the rare case this 
does occur, study drug must be stopped immediately and permanently discontinued. Losartan does not have effects on a fetus in the [ADDRESS_506315] notify the DSMB and IRB within 24 
hours of the site's knowledge of the subject's pregnancy and other agencies as by [CONTACT_2371]. Pregnancy itself does not constitute an AE. Pregnancy test will be performed at all site visits.  
 
Data monitoring plan will be implemented as follows:  
• Safety monitoring will be done:  
o All SAEs attributable to study drug will be reported to the study investigator(s) and discussed with 
an internal safety and monitoring group of [ADDRESS_506316](s), infectious disease specialist(s), ethicist and biostatistician.  These experts may not report to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_173003].  
o Any serious AE or SAE attributable to study drug will be shared with the medical monitor and safety and monitoring group within 24 hrs. The members will make the decision whether or not to stop the trial. 
• All SAEs will be reported to the safety and monitoring group and the appropriate agencies including FDA and IRB as required.  
• All adverse effects will be reported according to the rules to the FDA, the IRB and our internal DMSB  
• Initial interim analysis on safety will be done after the first 5 patients and reviewed by [CONTACT_401515].  
• The DSMB may stop the study due to safety or futility.  
• All DSMB reports will be shared with the IRB. 
 
Safety Reporting  
Data monitoring plans will be implemented as follows:  The study will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-
PIs. Any relevant AE or SA E will be reported to the medical monitor and to the DSMB  (separate charter) .  
• DSMB meeting  will occur after the first 5 patients, 25 patients and at end of study,  or more frequ ently if 
needed.   
o Safety monitoring will be done by [CONTACT_4318]. Safety monitoring will be done as follows : The 
investigators will continuously monitor the study for side effects. If any AE or serious adverse 
events (SAEs) occur, the physicians will assess th e event and report them to the appropriate 
authorities if needed as per Good Clinical Practice. Subjects might be withdrawn from the study if they experience intolerance to the study medication, initially based on the investigators’ discretion.  
o All advers e effects will be discussed among the investigators  
 If deemed severe the data will be shared with the medical monitor and the safety and 
monitoring group. The group will make the decision whether or not to stop the trial based on 
safety data.  
• All SAEs will be reported to the IRB and the appropriate agencies including FDA as required.  
 
Losartan COVID -19 | V5.0 | 27 APR 2020  • All adverse effects will be reported according to the rules to the FDA (if needed), the IRB and the DSMB.  
 
Safet y Reviews  
Safety review will occur at least every month  and/or if a SAE occurs. The internal safety and monitoring group 
will meet after the first [ADDRESS_506317] in  data analysis for adverse events as well (fee for service basis). However, this is a 
small study.   
 
Removal of Subjects from Study  
A subject withdrawal is defined as a discontinuation from the study for any reason. Subjects may withdraw or 
be withdrawn from this study for the following reasons:  
• At their own request or at the request of their authorized representative at any time for any reason  
• If, in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation in the study would be detrimental to the subject's well -being 
 
Subjects must be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons: 
• Subjects with an occurrence of any medical condition which, either because of its severity or duration or 
necessary change in treatment, contravenes the condition of the study or puts the patient at unnecessary 
risk or harm.  
• Subjects with an occurrence of  an AE/SAE, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_11922]/or subject req uires 
termination of treatment  
• Subjects who are noncompliant with the protocol per the investigator’s discretion  
• Pregnancy  
 
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal will be recorded in the subject's medical records  and case report forms . 
Subjects who terminate the clinical study prematurely, either at their own request or on the recommendation of 
the clinical investigator, will be considered early terminations. Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced but asked that their progress off drug can be followed as well. The DSMB should be notified of all early 
withdrawals and/or termination in the trial.   
 
REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
The protocol will be submitted to the KUMC IRB . The study was  registered on clinicaltrials.gov . 
 
ADMINISTRATIVE SECTION  
Protocol Amendments 
Any amendments to the protocol will be approved by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_6254]- investigators and the independent Data 
Monitoring Committee and the DSMB. All amendments will be submitted to the IRBs for review and approval prior to implementation unless the amendment details changes related to safety.  
 
Protocol Deviations 
The investigator will only make changes to the protocol procedures when necessary to protect the safety, rights, 
and welfare of the subjects. In such an event where protocol procedures are changed, the investigators are responsible for notifying the IRBs and the internal DSMB. 
In the event that an isolated, unforeseen instance occurs resulting in a protocol deviation, the investigators are 
to document this deviation and notify IRBs as by [CONTACT_401516].  
 
Case Report Form (CRF)  
All clinical data will be recorded on the CRFs for this study, including their electronics versions (Red Cap and 
Velos databases).  
 
Study Documentation and Records Retention 
The Good Clinical Practice guidelines issued by [CONTACT_401517] 
“The investigator must arrange for retention in strict confidence of the subjects ’ identification codes, names and 
addresses for at least 15 years after the completion or discontinuation of the trial. ” Subjects ’ files and other 
pertinent documentation (i.e., study protocol, signed informed consent forms, drug dispensing logs, correspondence, and other documents pertaining to the conduct of the study) must be kept for the maximum 
 
Losartan COVID -19 | V5.0 | 27 APR 2020  period permitted by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_401505], but not less than 15 
years.

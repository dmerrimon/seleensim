Statistical analysis  Statistical analysis will be performed in the following populations.  
Full Analysis Set (FAS):  
Full analysis set for efficacy analysis will include all randomized 
subjects, who received the study products and underwent at least one 
CRP measurement after administration of the study products. This 
set is the main population for efficacy analysis.  
Per Protocol Set (PPS):  
All FAS subjects without relevant Protocol  deviations affecting 
assessment of the  primary efficacy parameter. Such major Protocol  
deviations will be defined before database lock in a blinded data 
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312115]-2021 Page 27 of 98 review. This set is supplementary population for efficacy 
assessment.   
Safety Population : 
All randomized subjects, who received the study pro ducts.  
General considerations:  
Detailed description of statistical data analysis including last 
observation carried forward will be presented in statistical analysis 
plan (SAP). SAP development will be finalized until the study 
database lock. Any deviation s from analysis planned in SAP should 
be justified in the report on study results.  
Any data will be generalized using descriptive statistics: number of 
the subjects, mean value, minimum and maximum, median and 
quartiles for continuous variables, frequency  of observations with 
percentages - for qualitative variables.  
After the last subject completes 28 -day follow -up period, an analysis 
of hsCRP, BNP and NT -pro-BNP will be performed for 14 and 28 
days of the study. The analysis results may be used to define the 
strategy for further RPH -104 development.  
At this stage the primary efficacy analysis will be performed. This 
analysis will be performed only once and will not be repeated during 
the final analysis stage. Sensitivity analysis cannot be done during 
the interim stage and will be performed during the final analysis 
stage.  
Secondary efficacy variables (AUC from day 1 to day 28) will be 
derived and analysed for parameters hsCRP, BNP and NT -pro-BNP 
at the interim analysis stage. This analysis will be performed only 
once and will not be repeated during the final analysis stage.  
After the completion of the study, a final statistical data analysis will 
be conducted, and the final study report will be prepared.

  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312119]-2021 Page 29 of 98 2. Study rationale  
2.1. Introduction  
The term " myocardial infarction ” (MI) is used when there is verified myocardial lesion (defined 
as increased cardiac troponin level by [CONTACT_256834] 99th percentile of normal 
reference value) and myocardial necrosis in clinical situations suggesting myocardial ischemia. To  
ensure urgent selection of treatment approach including reperfusion therapy, MI is diagnosed in 
cases of anginal pain or its equivalents with ST elevation in at least 2 or more consequent leads or 
acute left bundle branch block (LBBB) and defined as ST -segment  elevation MI (STEMI) ( Ibanez 
B. et al, 2017 ).  
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of mortality globally (1.8 million deaths 
annually) and is 20% of all fatal outcomes in Europe despi[INVESTIGATOR_256747] ( Ibanez B. et al, 2017 ).  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_256748] R F are disparate. According to the available assessments, in Russia 
economic losses from all cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in 2016 was 2.7  trillion rubles being 
equivalent to 3.2% of GDP. In the structure of losses among all circulatory diseases, CHD  rates 
the first, financial burden in Russia is more than 1 trillion rubles (Kontsevaya A.V. et al, 2018).  
One of the most relevant forms of CHD  characterized by [CONTACT_256835]. Globally more than 
15 million of new onset MI cases are reported annually ( Garganeyeva А.А. et al, 2015 ; WHO, 
2017 ). MI aggravates prognosis signific antly: according to European register, mortality among the 
subjects with STEMI during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256749] 4% to 12%, 6 -month mortality may 
exceed 12%, 12 -month mortality is approximately 10% and may reach 20% within 5 years ( Ibanez 
B. et al, 2017 ). At that, unfavourable prognosis is still relevant for surviving post -MI subjects 
(Berger C.J., 1992 ; VNOK Work Group , 2007 ; Minzdrav, 2016 ).  
According to some authors, the urgency of MI epi[INVESTIGATOR_256750] > 60 years old both by [CONTACT_256836][INVESTIGATOR_256751] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256752] ( Okrugin S.А., 2018 ). 
The main therapeutic measures are directed at myocardial reperfusion as soon as possible with 
recanalization by [CONTACT_256837] (PCI) ( Ibanez B. et al, 2017 ).  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_256753], more than 20% surviving subjects develop HF (HF) 
within 90 days ( Gjesing A. et al., 2014 ).  
According to Russian epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037] (EPOHA -CHF, EPOHA -Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -CHF and 
EPOHA -Decompensation -CHF), prevalence of chronic HF  in the RF increased from 4.9% (1998) 
to 10.2% (2014) within 16 years. At that, the number of subjects with chronic HF functional class 
(FC) II -IV increased significantly due to incr eased age of the subjects as well as increased weight 
of etiological CHD causes (69.7% in 2014) and previous MI (15.3% in 2014). Overall mortality is 
6% annually ( Fomin I.V., 2016 ).  
STEMI is associated with intensive inflammatory response promoting further lesion and predicting 
increased  mortality or H F risk ( Frangogiannis N.G., 2008 ; Velagaleti R.S. et al., 2008 ; 
Vanhaverbeke M. et al., 2018 ).  
Interleukin -1 (IL -1) is the key mediator of local and systemic inflammatory response to injury . 
Nonclinical studies demonstrated that IL -1 inhibition improves infarction healing and prevents  the 
development of  HF (Abbate A. et al., 2006 ).  
The studies indicated that concentration of high -sensitive С -reactive protein (hsCRP), the marker 
of inflammatory response and surrogate marker of IL -[ADDRESS_312120]-2021 Page 30 of 98 syndrome/ MI, independently correlate d with the risk of unfavourable cardiovascular outcomes 
(including HF) (Ridker P. et al., 2005 ; Scirica B.M., 2009 ; Vanhaverbeke M. et al., 2018 ). 
Individual studies also demonstrated that, where the signs of persistent inflammation (increased 
hsCRP level) and hemodynamic stress ( an increase in a proBNP  level ) are observed, the subjects 
are under the highest r isk of HF ( Scirica B.M., 2009 ; Vanhaverbeke M. et al., 2018 ).  
Currently evaluation of medicinal products blocking activity of IL -1 (anakinra, rilonacept, 
canakinumab) is perform ed to improve outcomes in subjects with acute coronary syndrome/ MI 
(Buckley L.F. and Abbate A., 2018 ).  
Randomized double -blind placebo -controlled study of canakinumab (CANTOS) enrolled 
[ZIP_CODE]  subjects with MI and hsCRP level of ≥ 2 mg/L. The subjects received [ADDRESS_312121], the subjects reaching reduced hsCRP below 2  mg/L sho wed 
reduced frequency of major adverse cardiovascular events by 25% and mortality by 31% compared 
to the subjects not reaching hsCRP reduction. Similar results were demonstrated for other 
outcomes (including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256754] ( Ridker P.M. et al., 2017 ; Ridker P.M. et al., 2018 ). 
Three pi[INVESTIGATOR_256755]: VCU‐ART, VCU – ART2 
and VCU‐ ART3 ( Abbate A. et al., 2010 ; Abbate A., 2013 , Abbate A. et al., 2020 ; Van Tassell 
B.W. et al., 2018 ). In total, these pi[INVESTIGATOR_256756] 140 subjects with STEMI receiving 
reperfusion therapy who were randomized (within [ADDRESS_312122] coronary angiography) for daily 
anakinra therapy for [ADDRESS_312123]  (IL-1RA) , 
was tolerated well and reduced serum hsCRP level. Anakinra -treated subjects showed tendency 
for more favourable left ventricular (LV) remodelling and lower frequency of HF in the mid -term 
and long run.  
RPH -104 belongs to the class of target agents affecting IL-1. It is a hybrid protein selectively 
binding and inactivating IL -1β. Nonclinical studies show that RPH -104 is being developed for the 
treatment of human subjects with diseases associated with increased activity of IL -1β.  
To date , the clinical study of  drug use in  treatment of acute gout attacks has been completed, and 
the studies of potential benefits of the drug for the treatment of Familial Mediterranean fever, 
idiopathic recurrent pericarditis are ongoing.  
Given similar mechanism of action of RPH -104 and anakinra, RPH -104 is expected to reduce 
intensity of inflammatory response at myocardial lesion in subjects with STEMI and, therefore, to 
reduce hsCRP level and improve short -term and long -term outcomes.  
2.2. Cumulative presentation of the results of no nclinical and clinical studies 
relevant for this study  
RPH -104 is a hybrid protein with a molecular weight of the non -glycosylated form of 
126.8  kilodalton (kDA) selectively binding and inactivating IL -1β. Two active parts of the molecule 
are responsible f or RPH -104 binding with IL -1β: an extracellular portion of human IL -1 receptor  
type 1 (IL-1R1), type 1 and a portion of human IL -1 receptor accessory protein (IL -1RAcP) that is 
an IL -1 co-receptor.  
Structurally, RPH -104 molecule contains two polypeptide chains: the first one consists of 
extracellular part of IL -1 receptor (amino acids from 18 to 333 of human IL -1R1) and mutant Fc -
fragment of human  immunoglobulin G1  (IgG1 ); the second one consists of the part of IL -1RAcP 
(amino acids from 21 to 358 of huma n IL-1RAcP) and mutant Fc -fragment of human IgG1. Each of 
the extracellular parts of the molecule also contains [ADDRESS_312124] of RPH -104 on IL -1β-mediated secretion of IL -6 cell line of non -
transformed human lung fibroblasts (MRC5) demonstrated that 50% inhibitory concentration of 
RPH -104 (IC 50) is about 0.4 ng/mL (2.0 pmol/L).  
The amino acid sequence  of the extracellular domain of IL -1 receptor  in the RPH -104 molecule 
subunit is 94.7% identical to the amino acid sequence of IL -1 receptor of cynomolgus monkeys and 
only 64% identical to the IL -1R1 sequence of rodents. In addition, RPH -104 has co mparable cross -
reactivity in tissues of humans and cynomolgus monkeys. Therefore, cynomolgus monkeys are a 
suitable biological species for nonclinical studies of RPH -104 in vivo . 
RPH -104 shows linear pharmacokinetics  (PK)  in animals and humans. After a sin gle subcutaneous 
administration to cynomolgus monkeys, RPH -104 bioavailability is 52 -85% without signs of 
accumulation. After repeated administration to cynomolgus monkeys, plasma concentration and 
half-life tended to decrease by 20 -80% compared to single dose values due to production of anti -
product antibodies. Apparent gender -related differences in the product  PK are lacking.  
RPH -[ADDRESS_312125] level (NOAEL) in mice and monkeys was 100 mg/kg.  
Mathematic modeling  studies demonstrated that the minimum effective dose of RPH -104 required 
to achieve the desired plasma level of free IL -1β was 1 mg upon once weekly dosing. Maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) for humans is 6.4 mg/kg which is equivalent to [ADDRESS_312126] clinical study (phase 1) of RPH -104 was  completed. The study aimed at  evaluat ing 
the tolerability, safety , pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of the drug 
(RPH104FIH01/CL04018045) in healthy volunteers. The study results demonstrated that RPH -104 
at doses from 4 to 160 mg inclusive with a single subcutaneous injection are tolerated well by t he 
volunteers of either gender. No serious adverse events  (SAEs)  or any other adverse events  (AEs)  
resulting in early withdrawal have been reported. All adverse events (70 in total) in all dose groups 
were mild and resolved completely without any complicat ions. Headache was the only AE with 
tendency for higher frequency in RPH -104 group compared to placebo.  
The results of investigation of RPH -104 PK after a single administration presented in analysis of this 
clinical study demonstrated linear and dose -depen dent increase in C max and AUC (0-t) values. In 
general, median T max was 96 hours (4 days), however the median was 120 hours (5 days) in 40 and 
160 mg groups. Half -life was similar in all dose groups and was equivalent to 235 -249 hours ([ADDRESS_312127]-2021 Page 32 of 98 days).  
The results of pharmacodynamic (PD) study presented in the RPH104FIH01/CL04018045  study 
report  demonstrated that administration of the product at [ADDRESS_312128] of RPH -104 on S100 A8 levels.  
No antibodie s to RPH -104 were detected in the blood samples of healthy volunteers collected during 
the study.  
In 2020, an international multicenter randomized double -blind adaptive placebo -controlled single -
dose study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olokizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) and RPH -104 in patients 
with severe COVID -19 (SARS -CoV-2) infection conducted in RF was completed (CL04041078). 
The analysis of primary efficacy endpoint (response to treatment) showed no significant differences 
between the treatment group s. 
During the study of RPH -104 administration , 128 AEs were reported in 61 (49.6%) patients in the 
RPH -104 group and 111 AEs in 48 (38.7%) patients in the placebo group. The most common AEs 
belonged to the systemic organ class of “Investigations” (ALT incr eased, AST increased, GGT 
increased): 29 (23.6%) patients in the RH -104 group and 23 (18.5%) patients in the placebo group. 
Less common AEs belonged to the SOC of “Infections and infestations” (e.g. acute sinusitis, 
bacterial bronchitis, COVID -19, C.diffic ile-induced pseudomembranous colitis, otitis media, 
otosalpi[INVESTIGATOR_8937], pneumonia, pseudomembranous colitis, sepsis, septic shock, urinary tract infection, 
fungal urinary tract infection, viral sepsis – none of events were reported in more than 5% in each 
treatment group).  
At least one SAE was reported in 12.2% of patients in the RPH -104 group and 6.5% of patients in 
the placebo group. The majority of SAEs belonged to the SOC “Infections and infestations” (i.e. 
sepsis, septic shock, COVID -19, viral sepsis).  SAEs that led to death were reported in 11.4% and 
4.8% of patients in the RPH -104 and placebo groups, respectively. Only one SAE that resulted in  
death in the RPH -104 group was considered related to the  study drug (i.e. a case of septic shock). 
RPH -[ADDRESS_312129] been reported in any other 
ongoing studies of RPH -104 so far.  
In 2021, an open -label randomized phas e 2a clinical study assessing the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of RPH -104 at various doses in subjects with an acute 
gout epi[INVESTIGATOR_256757] (CL04018054)  was completed . In this study, the subjects receiv ed RPH -[ADDRESS_312130] pronounced decrease in the joint pain severity 72 hours after the start of the study treatment 
(primary endpoi nt) was observed in the RPH -104 20 mg, 80 mg and 160 mg dose groups, as well as 
the diclofenac group. In all groups, the use of the study treatment resulted in decreased severity of 
swelling and pain in the affected joint, elimination of erythema and impro vement of the patients’ 
performance status. The results of analysis of changes in the health assessment parameters (using 
the HAQ) indicated clinically significant improvement of the patients’ performance status while on 
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312131]-2021 Page 33 of 98 the study treatment in the 20 mg, 4 0 mg, 160 mg dose groups, and the diclofenac group.  
The analysis of PK parameters in this study demonstrated a tendency to increased  Cmax and AUC 
with the drug dose increased, except for the 20 mg dose group, which demonstrated higher mean 
values of these  parameters, similar to those observed in the 80 mg dose group. High interindividual 
variability of T max was observed. The half -life in the dose groups was about 10 days.  
RPH -104 dosing in patients with acute gout attacks resulted in decreased concentrations of the main 
inflammatory markers – hsCRP and serum amyloid A ( SAA ). hsCRP and SAA levels tended to 
show more significant decrease in the RPH -104 80 mg and 160 mg dose g roups; the [ADDRESS_312132] of hsCRP level increase 
compared to the diclofenac group.  
The study demonstrated a favo rable  safety profile of the drug. AEs related to the use of RPH -104 
included: in the 40 mg dose group – injection site hemorrhage, gouty arthritis; in the 80 mg group – 
drug-induced liver injury; in the 160 mg group  - leukocytosis, sinus tachycardia, injection site 
erythema, injection site itching, cholesterol level increased, creatinine level increased, triglyceride 
level increased, blood urea level increased, lymphocyte count increased, creatinine clearance 
decreased, neutrophil count and percentage decreased,  arthralgia, joint swelling, pain in extremities, 
allergic dermatitis. Injection site reactions were observed only in three patients treated with RPH -
104: two patients in the 4 mg dose group (swelling, hemorrhage) and one patient in the 160 mg dose 
group ( injection site erythema and itching).  
Two serious adverse events (SAEs) were  reported  in patients receiving the test product and one SAE 
in the active control group; there were no deaths.  
A 47 -year-old male patient with acute gouty arthritis treated with RPH -104 SC 80 mg developed 
highly active drug -induced hepatitis on a background of fatty liver (Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities  [MedDRA ] preferred term : drug-induced liver injury).  The investigat or 
regarded this event as probably related to the study drug and acknowledged the possible role of 
existing liver disease. However, taking into account the normalization of liver enzyme levels within 
a few days after the onset of symptoms, along with a persisting noticeable increase in panc reatic 
enzyme levels (which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_256758]), the patient's history of chronic 
pancreatitis, chronic cholecystitis, deformity of the duodenum (which could predispose to the 
development of acute pancreatitis or exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis), the Sponsor classified this 
event  as unrelated to the study drug and regarded the detected  disorders as more typi[INVESTIGATOR_256759].   
Another patient (male, 66 years old), who received once subcutaneous  injection of RPH -[ADDRESS_312133] for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex  and was 
diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis.  According to the Investigator’s assessment, the study drug was 
not related to these events. The Sponsor assessed both events as unrelated to the use of RPH -104: 
a blood sample was taken [ADDRESS_312134] for tuberculosis and the administration of the study drug biologically 
and chronologically implausible; the connection of pulmonary fibrosis with the use of PH -104 is 
chronologically impossible, since pulmonary fibrosis cou ld not develop in such a short period.  
In general, the available data on the safety of RPH -104 do not indicate that there is a significant 
risk to the safety of the study participants.  
Based on the results of the efficacy assessment in the CL04041078 stu dy, it was concluded that 
RPH -104 does not contribute to improving the clinical status (with respect to respi[INVESTIGATOR_256760]) or mortality rates in patients with severe COVID -19, however, the potential benefit in 
relation to other clinical outcomes requires study in further clinical studies. The results of the 
CL04018054 study indicate the potential efficacy of RPH -[ADDRESS_312135] to the doses of 
80-160 mg in terms of treatment of diseases associated with increased IL -1 activity. To date, no 
data are available on the efficacy of RPH -104 in humans with other disorders.  
The efficacy and safety of the use of RPH -104 is also being studied in an ongoing do uble-blind 
randomized placebo -controlled phase 2/3 clinical trial in patients with idiopathic recurrent 
pericarditis (CL04018068) in the R F, during which patients receive the investigational product 
according to the following regimen: the first injection a t a "loading" dose of 160 mg, then – at a 
dose of 80 mg – at Week [ADDRESS_312136] been reported in this study: community -acquired pneumonia associated 
with coronavirus infec tion ( RPH-104/placebo), exacerbation of idiopathic recurrent pericarditis 
(RPH -104), and bacterial community -acquired pneumonia (RPH -104). The case of bacterial 
community -acquired pneumonia was regarded by [CONTACT_256838] d with RPH -[ADDRESS_312137] of IL -1 inhibitors on the risk of infections’ 
development. These events were not included in the current safety analysis. In addition, patients 
are being recruited to an international multicenter double -blind placebo -controlled randomized 
clinical trial of the efficacy and safety of RPH -104 used to prevent recurrent seizures in adult 
patients with Familial Mediterranean fever with colchicine resistance or colchicine intolerance 
(CL04018065), for which a subsequent long -term open -label extension study is planned 
(CL04018071).  
A Phase 2, double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
RPH -[ADDRESS_312138] ed (CL04018066) , and 
so is a double -blind randomized placebo -controlled phase 3 study to evaluate efficacy and safety of 
RPH -104 in adult -onset Still ’s disease ( CL04018093).   
In view of the mechanism of action, RPH -104 is expected to be a highly effective, safe drug for 
reducing the inflammatory response to myocardial injury in STEMI patients and for improving short - 
and long -term outcomes.  
Detailed data on the results of nonclinical and clinical studies of RPH -104 are provided in the 
Investigator's B rochure.  
2.3. Brief summary of kno wn and potential risks and benefits for the study 
subjects  
RPH -104 study program currently includes the data from nonclinical studies and phase 1 clinical 
study on healthy volunteers , as well as a randomized double -blind placebo -controlled study of the 
use of RPH -104 in patients with severe COVID -19 (SARS -CoV -2 infection), and an open -label 
randomized phase 2a clinical study in patients with gout. Phase [ADDRESS_312139] 
been identified du ring the studies of RPH -104 i n patients with COVID -19 or gout.  
Based on the known safety profile of drugs in this class (IL -1 inhibitors), the following adverse 
reactions should be carefully monitored during their use:  
 Any i nfections  (including serious infections) , including but not limited to: upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014], pneumonia, urinary tract infection, gastroenteritis, 
tuberculosis, opportunistic infections, sepsis ; 
 Decreased neutrophil count;  
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312140]-2021 Page 35 of 98  Decreased platelet count;  
 Drug -induced liver injury, any liver enzyme increase ; 
 Elevation of blood lipid ; 
 Development of malignant neoplasms;  
 Ineffective vaccination or generalized vaccine -associated infection;  
 Macrophage activation syndrome;  
 Development of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions. These reactions can manifest 
as acu te infusion reactions, allergic reactions, or delayed -type hypersensitivity reactions.  
To detect AEs and take timely medical measures, all subjects will undergo regular examinations 
including vital signs, physical examination, laboratory tests and evaluati on of the product 
administration site.  
In addition, to assure safety of the subjects involved in the study, selection criteria stipulate 
ineligibility of the subjects in which the study product may increase the risk of AEs such as 
infections or reduced bl ood neutrophil count.  
Since the RPH -[ADDRESS_312141] as acute infusion reactions, allergic reactions or 
delayed -type hypersensitivity reactions.  Therefore, administration of RPH -104 will be performed 
at the study sites provided with medicinal products and equipment designed for the treatment of 
anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions.  
Based on the information available from the results of noncli nical studies and from RPH -104 
administration to healthy volunteers, patients with COVID -19 and gout, single subcutaneous 
administration to the subjects with acute STEMI at 80 mg or 160 mg is not expected to cause 
severe or serious AEs.  
Placebo administrat ion is not associated with additional risks for the study subjects with STEMI 
as the Protocol  does not define any additional or treatment -limiting conditions. The subjects who, 
based on their status, will await for cardiosurgery will not be enrolled in thi s study.  
Physical methods of examination to be performed in this study are routine methods (weight and 
height measurement, evaluation of vital signs  – blood pressure [BP], heart rate [HR], respi[INVESTIGATOR_862] [RR], body temperature], physical examination) and do not pose any additional risk for the 
subjects  during their participation in the study . 
Echocardiography (Echo -CG) is a routine examination method for the subjects with STEMI and 
does not pose additional burden and/or risks for the subjects participa ting in the study.  
According to the Protocol , laboratory examination requires blood sampling, therefore there is low 
risk of infection which may be ruled out by [CONTACT_256839].  
By [CONTACT_256840], the subjects will obtain reliable information on their 
health status within the examinations.  
In addition, based on the results of the studies of the products with similar mechanism of action in 
the same  population, improved STEMI outcome may be expected: more favourable LV 
remodeling and lower rate of HF in the mid -term and long run.  
Therefore, benefit from the study for the patients is expected to outweigh the risk and overall risk -
benefit ratio is fav orable.  
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312142] will be administered as a single subcutaneous dose of 80 mg (2 mL) or 160  mg 
(overall volume 4 mL: 2 mL in different administrati on sites).  
Placebo will be used as a single subcutaneous injection at 2 mL or 4 mL (2 mL in different 
administration sites).  
Nonclinical dose -ranging studies were not performed on relevant animal models.  
In the studies of anakinra, an agent with similar  mechanism of action, the product was administered 
once daily for 14 days in subjects with STEMI. Given that RPH -104 half -life is 250  hours, single 
administration is supposed to provide inhibition of IL -1 with reduced hsCRP level.  
According to study data for rilonacept, a drug with a similar mechanism of action, a single dose of 
320 mg of rilonacept is well tolerated, and a dose of 160 mg weekly has proven its therapeutic 
efficacy in patients with diseases in which IL -1 plays a lead ing pathogenic role (Hashkes P.J. et 
al., 2012 ; Hoffman H.M. et al., 2008 ; Krause K. et al., 2012 ). RPH -104 contains active fragments 
similar to rilonacept, while the molecular weight of the former is 2 times less, therefore the same 
dose of RPH -104 can provide a molar ratio 2 times higher than that of rilonacept. In addition, 
according to the results o f phase 1 study (RPH104FIH01/CL04018045) in healthy volunteers doses 
of 80 and 160 mg provide higher blood concentrations of the drug with a similar safety profile 
compared to lower doses . 
In addition, in an open -label phase 2a study in patients with gout,  there was a tendency to a more 
pronounced decrease in hsCRP in the dose groups RPH -104 80 mg and 160 mg. A comparative 
intergroup analysis (RPH -104 at doses of 4 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg and 160 mg versus 
diclofenac) revealed a statistically significant su periority compared to the diclofenac group in 
reducing the hsCRP from the baseline level for the 80 mg dose group at certain time points after 
administration of the study drug.  
Dose selection (80 mg or 160 mg) for further phases of clinical studies will be  based on the results 
of analysis of data from this study in terms of risk -benefit ratio for two doses of RPH -104.  
The results of phase 1 study demonstrated that single subcutaneous administration of RPH -104 at 
doses from 4 mg to 160 mg was tolerated well  by [CONTACT_112640]. These results , as well as the 
results of the use of RPH -104 in patients with COVID -19 or gout (during which no new safety 
signals were identified)  suggest that in the present clinical study RPH -104 at 80 mg or 160 mg will 
be tolerated well by [CONTACT_256841].

2.6. Description of study population  
The study is supposed to enroll male and female subjects aged from 18 years old (inclusive)

determine upper age limit.   
Selection criteria for this study were carefully developed to assure safety of the subjects and 
authenticity of th e study results.

4.2. Description of the study design, design flow chart, description of the 
study procedures and stages  
4.2.1.  Description  of the study design  
International, multicenter, phase 2a, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled clinical study 
comparing single administration of RPH -104 80 mg, RPH -104 160 mg and placebo (1:1:1) in 
subjects with STEMI at the study sites of the RF and [LOCATION_003].  
After the signing informed consent  form (ICF) , the investigator will assess the subject's eligibility 
for the study. The following procedures will be performed during the screening: collection of 
medical history, recording previous and concomitant therapy, demographic data, recording 12 -
lead electrocar diography ( ECG ) findings on which STEMI diagnosis was based, recording date 
and time of STEMI symptom development, recording date, time and results of CAG at admission 
to the study site, measurement of blood neutrophil count, vital signs assessment, physic al 
examination  (including weight measurement if a functional bed is available) , blood collection for 
hematology, biochemistry, determination of concentration of hsCRP and brain natriuretic peptide 
(BNP; NT -pro-BNP), for females with retained reproductive p otential – pregnancy test (test 
strips).  
During the first 10 weeks, not more than 3 patients per week will be included in the study.  
The subjects meeting selection will be randomized to one of the three groups for single 
subcutaneous administration of RPH -104 80 mg, RPH -104 160 mg or placebo.  
Therefore, screening, randomization and administration of the study products will be made on the 
same (first) study day.  
Further 4 -week (28 -day) clinical follow -up and additional [ADDRESS_312149]-2021 Page 40 of 98  
Figure 1. Study design flow chart  
4.2.2.  Discussion of the study design including selection of  control groups  
The design chosen was multicenter, double blind, randomized, placebo -controlled clinical study 
comparing single administration of RPH -104 80 mg, RPH -104 160 mg and placebo (1:1:1) in 
subjects with acute STEMI.  
Randomized, double -blind, con trolled studies are currently a golden standard of the clinical study 
design as they minimize risk of bias upon distribution to treatment groups and outcome evaluation.  
Selection of two doses of test product and placebo as a reference product will allow t o obtain 
reliable data concerning safety and efficacy of lower and higher doses of the product compared to 
placebo.  
Selection of a surrogate endpoint - area under concentration - time curve (AUC) for hsCRP from 
Day 1 (baseline) till Day 14 – as a primary efficacy criterion is determined by [CONTACT_256844] -104 reduces concentration of hsCRP, a surrogate 
marker of IL -1 activity and predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes ( Ridker P. et al., 2005 ; 
Scirica B.M., 2009 ; Abbate A. et al., 2010 ; Abbate A., 2013 ; Ridker P.M. et al., 2017 ; 
Vanhaverbeke M. et al., 2018 ; Ridker P.M. et al., 2018 ; Van Tassell B.W. et al., 2018 ).  
At that, direct cardiovascular and other clinica l outcomes were chosen as secondary endpoints in 
accordance with international definitions of cardiovascular outcomes for clinical studies 
(Hicks  K.A.et al., 2018 ) allowing to evaluate direct product effects on the dis ease outcomes.  
In addition, structural and functional cardiac parameters  (based on the Echo -CG findings)  allowing 
to consider remodelling and concentration of brain natriuretic peptide  (BNP, NT -pro-BNP), a 
surrogate marker of HF will be evaluated.  
Therefore the selected study design and endpoints will suggest reasonability of RPH -[ADDRESS_312150] will be no more than 12 mo nths.

 AE/SAE recording.  
Description of procedures is provided in Section 8.2.1.  
4.5. Subjectivity minimization measures  
4.5.1.  Randomization  
The subjects will be randomized in 1:1:1 ratio without stratification into one of treatment groups 
- RPH -104 80 mg,  RPH -104 160 mg or placebo based on randomization scheme prepared using 
the relevant software by [CONTACT_256848]. Distribution will be made using block, 
non-adaptive, centralized randomization using Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) .  
At Visit 1 after eligibility of the patient  is confirmed  by [CONTACT_256849] , the 
unblinded investigator will perform randomization using the IWRS  and obtain information about 
the patient's randomization number and assigned therapy group .  
Detailed information on IWRS system will be presented in an individual IWRS manual kept in 
Trial Master File (TMF) and in each Investigator Site File (ISF).  
The u nblinded researcher will keep a register linking the screening and randomization numbers of 
study participants and therapy groups. Access to these registers for blinded employees will be 
limited.  
Study participant r andomization number may not be changed du ring the study. Distribution of the 
subject to a treatment group may not be changed during the study.  
If the subject decides to refuse to participate or withdraw from the study for any reason, his/her 
randomization number may not be re -used.  
Randomizatio n scheme and identification of each subject will be added to the study report.  
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312159]-2021 Page 46 of 98 4.5.2.  Blinding  
The study will be double -blind, i.e. neither the physician ( investigator ) performing examination 
and follow -up, nor the subject will be aware of the treatment group to which the subject has been 
assigned and of the product administered. To assure double blind design, unblinded investigator's 
team and unblinded monitor will be involved. Detailed description of operational peculiarities will 
be presented in an individual G uidelines on medicinal product handling.  
Given that administration of RPH -104 at 160 mg is only possible by [CONTACT_1192] 80 mg injections (2  mL) 
at different sites and appearance of the finished forms of test product and placebo may differ, the 
following dosing re gimen will be used to assure double blind design:  
 in RPH-104 80 mg group, the subjects will receive 2 mL (80 mg) of RPH -104 and 2 mL 
of placebo on diffe rent administration sites;  
 in RPH-104 160 mg group, the subjects will receive 2 mL (80 mg) of RPH -104 and 2 mL 
of (80 mg) of RPH -104 on different administration sites;  
 in placebo group, the subjects will receive [ADDRESS_312160]'s visual control will be enforced upon the study product 
administration.  
Monitoring of this process on Sponsor's behalf will be made by [CONTACT_256850].  
4.6. Storage of  randomization/identification codes and their unblinding  
The investigator should ensure confidentiality of the subjects. CRFs and other documents should 
only identify the subjects by [CONTACT_256851].  In 
this study, the screening number is the patient’s identification code. The screening number is 
assigned by [CONTACT_256852].  
The blinded investigator must enter the patient’s screening number in the source documentat ion 
and keep a separate screening and randomization log. The  patient’s  screening number cannot be 
changed during the study.  
The investigator should keep a special identification log/list of numbers, surnames, addresses and 
phones and numbers of medical doc umentation (if available).  
Unblinding of the identification code of the subject is only possible with his consent verified in 
writing and/or for the sake of his life and health.  
Until the end of the study, randomization plan will be kept by [CONTACT_147636] e study statistician. 
Unblinded staff of the center should ensure that a clinical study participant receives the therapy 
matching the therapy group assigned by [CONTACT_125070].  
Unblinding randomization codes and treatment groups may be performed as agreed with Sponsor 
in case of urgency and/or SAEs . Treatment group unblinding will be performed by [CONTACT_256853]’s identification number, according to the procedure 
described in an individual IWRS guideline.  
4.7. List of d ata recorded directly in CRF  
Electronic case report form (eCRF) shall be filled for each subject participating in the study 
including basic study -related data.  
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312161]-2021 Page 47 of 98 All the information added to eCRF should comply with the one in source documents (medical 
treatm ent record, clinical record, laboratory test reports, Protocol s and extracts from other 
examinations).  
No data to be entered in eCRF without reflecting the same information in source documentation 
will be stipulated by [CONTACT_74556]. All study -related data will be first recorded in source 
documentation and then in eCRF.

therapy should not be forbidden by  [CONTACT_89191] (see section 6.2.2).  
Concurrent/ongoing treatment with any cytochrome P450 substrate (see Table 3) with a narrow 
therapeutic index should be clinically monitored to ensure therapeutic effect is maintained; doses 
of the cytochrome P450 substrate may need to be adjusted as the enzyme may be normalized with 
co-administration with RPH -104.

Periodicity of the procedures and assessments is also provided in Schedu le of visits and procedures 
(see Table 1 ). 
Blood sampling to determine concentration of hsCRP and level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP, 
NT-pro-BNP) will be made at Visit 1 Day 1 (at baseline), Visit 2 (Day 3 ), Visit 3 (Day 14 ±3) and 
Visit 4 (Day 28 ±3) of the study. In addition, blood sampling to determine level of brain natriuretic 
peptide (BNP, NT -pro-BNP) will be made at Visit 6 (Month 12±2  weeks) of the study. 
Concentration of hsCRP and level of brain natriuretic peptide (B NP, NT -pro-BNP) will be 
determined in central laboratory.  
Throughout the clinical study, the investigator will follow the subjects to evaluate and record 
cardiovascular and other outcomes (fatal outcomes, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]1, new HF) based on the 
current cl inical recommendations and terminological criteria "2017 Cardiovascular and 
Stroke  Endpoint  Definitions for Clinical Trials" (Hicks K.A.et al., 2018) ( see Attachment 1).   
Echo -CG will be carried out at Visit 1 (Day 1 ) (this procedure is permitted to be done within 24 
hours from the moment of randomization) , Visit 4 (Day 28± 3) and Visit  6 (Month 12±2 weeks) 
by [CONTACT_256862]. Measurements will 
be carried out in accorda nce with the internal document on the interpretation of echo -CG findings.  
Echo -CG parameters assessed during the study are described in detail in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan.  Given than Echo -CG is an operator -dependent technique, assessment and recording  echo -
CG results will be centralized.  
The following information will be collected upon dose change, dosing scheme modification or 
product discontinuation  in concomitant therapy : date of change, description of change 
(discontinuation, dose escalation, dose  reduction, switch to another product of another group), 
cause of changes (improved condition, aggravated condition, adverse events/adverse reactions 
associated with the study product).

parameters  
8.2.1.  General provisions  
Safety assessment will include monitoring all recording all AEs and SAEs according to MedDRA 
and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.5.0.).  
The unblinded medical monitor will receive and evaluate all AE reports on a regular basis durin g 
the study.  
Monitoring will include physical examination including vital signs, hematology, serum chemistry 
as outlined in Schedule of visits and procedures ( see Table 1 ).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Physical examination  
Physical examination will be carrie d out at Visit 1 (Day 1 ), Visit 2 (Day 3 ), Visit 3 (Day 14 ±3), 
Visit 4 (Day 28± 3) and Visit 6 (Month 12±  2 weeks) and will include the assessment of the 
following: general condition, injection site, condition of skin, musculoskeletal system, lymph 
nodes, thyroid gland, upper and lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352], heart, vessels, abdominal organs, kidneys, 
psychoneurolo gical status. Abnormal values reported at the screening visit will be recorded in 
eCRF section "Co -morbidities". At the following visits, "Adverse Events" section of eCRF will 
include only abnormal values/changes relative to screening physical examination values meeting 
AE definition.  
Weight measurement will be carried out at Visit 1 (Day 1 ) or Visit 2 (Day 3), Visit 3 (Day 14 ± 3), 
Visit  4 (Day 28± 3) and Visit 6 (Month 12±2 weeks). Based on severity of the subject's condition, 
body weight will be measured in recumbent condition at Visit 1 Day 1 using hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256770], if not 
available, at Visit 2 (Day 3 ) in standing position using the relevant balance. At the remaining visits, 
measurement will be done in standing position using the relevant balance.  
Height m easurement will be done in a standing position at Visit 3 (Day 14 ±3) or at any time during 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (it is permissible to record any value obtained during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], when 
it is possible to measure the patient's height) .  
Vital signs wi ll be measured at Visit 1 (Day 1 ) or Visit 2 (Day 3), Visit 3 (Day 14 ±3), Visit 4 (Day 
28±3), Visit 6 (Month 12±2 weeks). Based on severity of the subject's condition, vital signs will 
be measured in recumbent position or sitting position after a [ADDRESS_312182]. Systolic and diastolic BP 
will be measured on the same arm using the same device. HR will be measure d on the apex of 
heart using phonendoscope. HR and RR will be measured for 1 min. Body temperature will be 
taken by [CONTACT_256863].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Laboratory examination  
Hematology and biochemistry will be made at Visit 1 (Day 1 ) (baseline) , at Visit 3 (Day 14±3)  
and Visit 4 (Day 28± 3) in central laboratory. At Visit 1 d etermination of the absolute neutrophil 
count is performed in the local laboratory of the site to assess the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Hematology will include the following parameters: hemoglobin,  erythrocyte count, leukocyte 
count, leukogram with obligatory measurement of absolute neutrophil count, platelet count.  
Biochemistry will include the following parameters: hepatic chemistry values (AST, ALT, GGT, 
AP, LDH, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin , indirect bilirubin), renal chemistry values (serum 
creatinine, serum urea /urea nitrogen [BUN ]), serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chlorides), 
CPK, CPK -МВ.  
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312183] regardless of causality. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
product.  
AEs include (but not limited to) the following:  
 Laboratory v alues outside normal range having clinical relevance.  
 Pre-existing findings at physical examination which aggravated compared to baseline and 
are considered clinically relevant.  
 Physical examination findings (including vital signs) considered clinically relevant.  
8.2.3.  Adverse events of interest  
The following safety concerns have been identified as Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) 
based on the safety data currently available for RPH -104 and IL -1 inhibitor biologics:  
 Infections (including serious infections), including tuberculosis and opportunistic 
infections  
 Confirmed cases of active tuberculosis should also be documented as SAEs ; 
 Malignant neoplasms  
 The investigator will be asked to provide relevant medical 
information/documentation (i.e . the results of pathological/ histological 
examination ) for all cases of malignant neoplasms, regardless of their seriousness, 
as these cases are subject to entry into the safety database;  
 Increased blood lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] ( i. e., hypercholesterolemia, increased blood cholesterol, increased 
blood triglycerides, hypertriglyceridemia, and increased LDL cholesterol);  
 Systemic reactions to drug administration and hypersensitivity reactions;  
 Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia;  
 Drug -induced liver injury, any liver enzyme increase ; 
 Injection site  reactions . 
All of the above events  are subject to recording  and analysis as AESIs . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Emergency  
Given that in rare cases anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reaction s are possible during the product 
administration, the study site should dispose of the relevant medicines and equipment for urgent 
medical assistance including antishock therapy. Development of such urgency and measures taken 
should be recorded on the rele vant pages of eCRF.  
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312184] administration will be added to eCRF section "Medical history".  
The investigator should document all the AEs during the study in case histories and eCRFs.  
Adverse events will be recorded based on complaints reported by [CONTACT_256864], results 
of interviews between investigator and subject, results of physical examination and laboratory 
tests. The investigator should formulate his questions to the subject in the manner not provoking 
the subject to report unreliable informatio n. 
AEs will be recorded in the relevant eCRF sections as well as in source medical documents of the 
subject.  
The following information should be specified when recording adverse events:  
 Subject identification number;  
 Nature of AE (preferably diagnosis rat her than the list of symptoms);  
 Date of AE onset and resolution (and time if applicable);  
 Measures related to AE;  
 AE meeting SAE  criteria;  
 AE severity;  
 AE meeting unexpected AE criteria;  
 Relationship between the AE and study product administration (accordi ng to the 
investigator);  
 Outcome of AE.  
8.2.5.  Definition of a serious adverse event  
A serious adverse event - SAE  - is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
 Resulted in death;  
 Was life -threatening;  
 Resulted in permanent  or pronounced incapacity or  disability;  
 Required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256771];  
 Resulted in a birth defect/congenital abnormalit y in children of patients who had been 
treated with the drug . 
 Furthermore, serious adverse events include any event not meeting the criteria above 
though being a relevant medical event according to the investigator.  
Any other AEs not meeting these criteria will be rated as non -serious.

or by [CONTACT_6791]:  
+7 (495) [ADDRESS_312186] notify  the Local Ethics Committee  (LEC )/Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
on the SAE according to LEC /IRB  standard operation procedures.  
8.2.7.  Definition of unexpected adverse event s 
An unexpected AE in its nature or severity is inconsistent with the ones outlined in the current 
Investigator's Brochure.  
Any other AEs are considered to be expected.  
8.2.8.  Submission of reports on suspected unexpected adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
The stud y sponsor should notify regulatory authorities on all suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) within the terms specified by [CONTACT_28769]. In context of notification of regulatory 
authorities and investigators, the S[LOCATION_003]Rs  will mean unexpected SAEs  considered by [CONTACT_36284]/or Sponsor as related to the study product.  
8.2.9.  Adverse event  severity  assessment  
AE severity will be evaluated according to CTCAE v5.0 classification. If an AE is lacking in 
CTCAE classification, it will be classified based o n the following grading:  
Grade 0:  No AE  
Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age 
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.[ADDRESS_312187]-2021 Page 61 of 98 Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; 
limiting self -care activities of daily living.3  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death related to AE.  
Severe AE is not necessarily serious by [CONTACT_256865].   
8.2.10.  Adverse event  outcome  evaluation  
AE outcome will be determined as follows:  
Fatal : The subject died due to AE (death is an outcome, not an AE)  
Recovering/Resolving  Reduced intensity of AE  
Not Recovered/ Not Resolved 
(Continuing)  AE did not resolve, intensity unchanged  
Recovered/Resolved with 
Sequelae  AE resolved but with a permanent defect.  
Recovered/Resolved  AE resolved completely without sequelae  
Unknown:  AE outcome is unknown as the subject did not attend the 
follow -up visit and attempts to obtain the follow -up 
information were useless (loss to follow -up) 
8.2.11.  Relationship between an adverse event  and study drugs  
The investigator will be responsible to assess causality between the AE and study product 
administration (related /unrelated). The investigator should use hi s knowledge on the subject, 
circumstances of the event and evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether 
the AE is related to the study product or not. One of the following options should be chosen for 
relationship between AE and the study product: "related" or "unrelated". The following 
recommendations should be taken into account:  
 relationship between AE development and initiation of the study product 
administration;  
 AE changes over time  after discontinuation of the study product;  
 known relationship between the study product or similar treatments;  
 risk factors increasing the risk of AE;  
 any non -treatment -related factors associated with the event frequency.  
The investigator should report relationship of every event with the study pro duct based on the most 
probable relationship assessment, at that the study site personnel will be responsible to obtain any 
lacking data.

abnormalities or birth defects in children of study subjects are considered to be SAEs . Elective 
abortions, abortions for medical reasons, with sequelae as well as any serious pregnancy 
complications (including spontaneous abortions) should b e recorded as SAEs . Planned abortions 
without sequelae are not AEs. 
All pregnancy cases reported during the study (including pregnancies of female partners of the 
study subjects) should be duly recorded. Where pregnancy is confirmed, the investigator shoul d 
notify Sponsor pharmacovigilance officer by [CONTACT_17258] a pregnancy report. Pregnancy report 
should be filled by [CONTACT_256866] 24 hours after obtaining pregnancy 
information. A pregnancy should be reported by [CONTACT_189806]  “Pregnancy” page in the eCRF

monitored where possible until 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year old.  
8.2.14.  Other safety re ports  
Investigators will submit to LEC /IRB  reports on other treatment safety aspects subject to 
immediate notification if they affect risk -benefit ratio, related to the treatment or may require 
relevant changes in the treatment within the study or study me thodology.  
In addition to urgent reports, Sponsor will annually prepare safety update reports on RPH -104 
containing all the new relevant safety information obtained during the reporting interval. Summary 
of these reports will be sent to the investigators for submission to LEC /IRB  of medical institutions 
on an annual basis.  
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312191] will be 
presented in statistical analysis plan (SAP). SAP deve lopment will be finalized until the study 
database lock. Any deviations from analysis planned in SAP should be justified in the clinical 
study report.  
Any data will be generalized using descriptive statistics: number of the subjects, mean value, 
minimum a nd maximum, median and quartiles for continuous variables, frequency of observations 
with percentages - for qualitative variables.  
9.2. Selection of data for the analysis  
Statistical analysis will be conducted in the following study sets:  
Full analysis set (FAS) for the efficacy analysis  
Full analysis set  (FAS)  for efficacy analysis will include all randomized subjects who received the 
study products and underwent at least one hsCRP measurement after administration of the study 
products. This set is the main  population for efficacy assessment.

as lists.  
Vital signs will be presented using de scriptive statistics by [CONTACT_256874]. Changes 
relative to baseline will also be presented.  
9.4. Sample size justification  
Rationale for sample size will be based on testing the hypothesis of statistical superiority to 
compare hsCRP area under cu rve AUC between day 1 and day 14 (primary endpoint) between 
each RPH -104 group and placebo. Given exploratory nature of the study, adjustment of α -level 
due to multiple comparisons (two RPH -104 doses and placebo) will not be used.  
Assuming that the expect ed mean hsCRP AUC will be 350±250 mg/L for the subjects with STEMI 
in placebo group (according to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] ( Van Tassell B.W. et al., 2018 ) and standardized 
effect size (d Cohan) 0.[ADDRESS_312194] dose (conserva tive estimate based on ( Van Tassell B.W. 
et al., 2018 ), 34 randomized subjects in each treatment group (1:1:1) (102  randomized subjects in 
total) will assure the study power > 90% (2 -sided level α = 0.05) for comparison of lower dose 
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312195]-2021 Page 66 of 98 with placebo and study power > 95% to detect the expected further hsCRP AUC 50% reduction 
by 50% and increased effect of the higher RPH -104 dose compared to placebo.  
Given proportion of withdrawals and/or 20% statistical analysis (conservative estimate), the study 
power > 80% will be maintained for all comparisons.  
Given potential screening failures of up to 30%, the study will enroll not more than 146 subjects.  
9.5. Applied level of significance  
Probability of type I error (two -sided level of significance) is established at 5% level for all 
comparisons. Due to exploratory nature of the study, adjustments for multiple comparisons are not 
planne d.  
9.6. Reporting deviations from the initial analysis plan  
Deviations from the planned statistical analysis will be agreed with Sponsor and reflected in the 
study report.  
9.7. Interim analysis  
After the last subject completes 28 -day follow -up period, a n interim  analysis of hsCRP, BNP and 
NT-pro-BNP will be performed after 14 and 28 days of the study. Based on this analysis, decision 
on the study termination will not be taken. The analysis results may be used to define the strategy 
for further RPH -104 development .  
Population for performing an interim analysis – Full Analysis Set.  
During the interim analysis  the primary efficacy analysis will be performed ( see section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
This analysis will be performed only once and will not be repeated during the final ana lysis stage. 
Sensitivity analysis can’t be done during the interim stage and will be performed during the final 
analysis stage.  
Secondary efficacy variables (AUC from day 1 to day 28) will be derived and analysed for 
parameters hsCRP, BNP and NT -pro-BNP at  the interim analysis stage ( see section [IP_ADDRESS] ). This 
analysis will be performed only once and will not be repeated during the final analysis stage.  
Values at visits (Day 1 – baseline, Days 3, 14 and 28) and changes from baseline (Days 3, 14 and 
28) will  be described for hsCRP, BNP and NT -pro-BNP parameters  using d escriptive statistics 
upported with graphics . 
All individual subject’s dat a will be kept blinded for the S ponsor and all other staff involved into 
the data review except unblinded statistician.  
9.8. Independent study clinical outcome assessment committee  
An independent study outcome assessment committee (ISOAC) will be arranged to assure 
reliability and quality of data on assessment of cardiovascular and other Protocol -defined 
outcomes as efficacy par ameters. The committee will include three independent cardiologists with 
the relevant qualification for outcome classification according to terminology criteria 2017 
Cardiovascular and  Stroke  Endpoint Definitions for Clinical Trials (Hicks K.A.et al., 2018 ) (see 
Attachment 1).  Outcome classification will be blinded. ISOAC -defined outcome classification will 
be considered to be final for the purpose of the study result analysis. The committee shall convene 
in accordance with the ap proved work plan.  The information on the composition, procedures and 
decisions of ISOAC will be included into the study report.

Definitions for Clinical Trials  
(translation of extracts from publication by [CONTACT_256898] K.A.et al., 2018 ) 
Definition of cardiovascular death  
 
Cardiovascular death  includes death due to acute  myocardial infarction  (MI), sudden cardiac 
death, death from heart failure  (HF), death from stroke, death from cardiovascular (CV) 
procedures, death from CV hemorrhage and other CV death . 
 
More specific classification of cardiovascular death (MI, sudden death, etc.) in outcome studies 
is not generally required. Furthermore, such  classification is difficult as it refers to both principal 
cause (e.g. acute MI which may cause fatal arrhythmia or HF) and to death (sudden, arrhythmic; 
HF due to MI or aggravated HF) which are mostly overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. However, the following 
definitions may b e used as necessary.  
  
1. Death due to acute myocardial infarction  belongs to any cardiovascular death (e.g. 
arrhythmia, sudden death, HF, stroke, pulmonary embolism, peripheral artery disease) 
within [ADDRESS_312222] MI, it 
will be considered to be MI -related death.  
 
Acute MI shoul d be confirmed by [CONTACT_256899] (see 
Definition of MI in publication by [CONTACT_256898] K.A.et al., 2018  and publication by [CONTACT_256900] K. 
et al., 2018 ) or by [CONTACT_256901] a previous MI or coronary artery 
thrombosis.  
 
Death due to MI therapy procedure (percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary 
artery by[CONTACT_15806] (CABG) or treatment of MI -related complication should also be 
considere d as death due to acute MI.  
 
Death due to coronary procedure for the treatment of myocardial ischemia (i.e. chronic stable 
angina) or death due to MI as a result of CV examination/procedure/surgery should be 
considered as death due to treatment of CV patho logy.  
 
2. Sudden cardiac death  means sudden death outside of [ADDRESS_312223] acute MI. Sudden 
cardiac death includes the following scenarios:  
 
                                            
[ADDRESS_312224]-2021 Page 80 of 98 a. Death which was certified and occurred without development or aggravation of 
symptoms  
b. Death was certified within  60 min after development or aggravation of cardiac symptoms 
if the symptoms do not verify acute MI   
 
c. Death certified and caused by [CONTACT_256902] (e.g. recorded at electrocardiogram 
(ECG), recorded on the monitor or not certified but detected at in spection of implantable 
cardioverter defibrillator)  
 
d. Death after unsuccessful resuscitation at cardiac arrest (e.g. sudden cardiac death without 
response to implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), electric activity arrest without 
pulse)  
 
e. Death after successful resuscitation at cardiac arrest without determination of specific 
cardiac or non -cardiac etiology   
 
f. Uncertified death of the subject who was seen alive and clinically stable within 24 hours 
before he/she was found dead, without any evidence of a  specific non -cardiovascular 
cause of death (where appropriate, the information on the subject's clinical status should 
be provided)  
 
General provisions  
 
o If additional information does not suggest an alternative cause of death (e.g. other 
cardiovascular de ath), if the subject was seen alive within 24 hours before he/she was 
found dead, sudden cardiac death (2f criterion) should be recorded. For the subjects who 
were not seen alive within 24 hours before death, the cause of death should be recorded 
as undefi ned (e.g. the subject found dead in his/her bed if the family did not see him/her 
for more than 24 hours).  
 
3. Death from heart failure means death due to clinical aggravation of the symptoms and/or 
signs of HF regardless of etiology of HF (see Heart failure definition ). HF death may have 
various etiologies including single or recurring MI, ischemic or non -ischemic 
cardiomyopathy, hypertension or heart valve disease.  
 
4. Death from stroke means death post stroke which is a direct consequence of stroke or its 
complication. Acute stroke should be verified using diagnostic stroke criteria where possible 
(see Appendix 8 of publication by [CONTACT_256898] K.A.et al., 2018 ).  
 
5. Death from cardiovascular procedures means death caused by [CONTACT_256903] a 
cardiovascular procedure . 
 
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312225]-2021 Page 81 of 98 6. Death from cardiovascular hemorrhage means death associated with a hemorrhage 
including non -stroke intracranial hemorrhage (e.g. subdural hem atoma) (see Appendix 8 to 
publication by [CONTACT_256898] K.A.et al., 2018 ), non -procedural or non -traumatic vessel rupture (e.g. 
aorta aneurysm) or hemorrhage causing cardiac tamponage.  
 
7. Other cardiovascular death refers to death from CV pathologies not included into the 
categories above where there is a certain known cause (e.g. pulmonary embolism or 
peripheral artery disease).  
 
 
Definition of non -cardiovascular death  
 
Non-cardiovascular death is any death with a specific c ause which in its nature is not 
associated with a cardiovascular pathology as specified in Definition of cardiovascular death . 
Detailed recommendations on classification of non -CV causes of death are beyond this 
document. The required level of details and optimal classification will depend on the nature of 
the study population and expected number and type of non -CV deaths. Any specific expected 
safety issue should be added as an individual cause of death. Below is t he recommended list of 
causes of non -CV death.  
 Pulmonary  
 Renal  
 Gastrointestinal  
 Hepatobiliary  
 Pancreatic  
 Infection (including sepsis)  
 Inflammatory (e.g. systemic inflammation response syndrome (SIRS)/Immune 
(including autoimmune) (may include environmental anaphylactic reaction (e.g. food 
allergy))  
 Bleeding other than CV hemorrhage or stroke (see Definition of cardiovascular death , 
Section 6 and Appendix 8 of publication by [CONTACT_256898] K.A.et al., 2018 ) 
 Procedure or surgery not associated with a CV pathology  
 Injury (including murder)  
 Suicide  
 Response to OTC product  or overdose  
 Response to an OTC product or overdose (may include anaphylactic reaction)  
 Neurological (non -CV) (other than CV death due to ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke 
or stroke for unknown cause or CV hemorrhage into central nervous system)  
 Malignan t tumour (e.g. leukemia, lymphoma or another malignant tumour)  
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312226]-2021 Page 82 of 98  Another non -CV cause (specify): _________________  
 
 
Definition of uncertain cause of death  
 
Undefined cause of death refers to death not related to any of the CV or non -CV death 
categories above. Inability to classify the cause of death may be due to lack of information (e.g. 
the only available information is "the subject died") or due to deficit of additional information 
or data to determine the cause of death. Overall, most deaths should b e classified as CV -related 
or non -CV-related, therefore this category of death is not encourage and should only be used in 
rare cases in well -designed clinical studies.  
 
General analytical approach to analysis of death causes consists in assumption that al l 
unexpected cases belong to CV category (e.g. supposed CV death, particularly "other CV 
death"). Nevertheless, the relevant classification and analysis of undefined causes of death 
depend on the population, study intervention, follow -up period and disease  course (assumption 
that CV death is unlikely, e.g. in subjects with advanced oncology, advanced pulmonary disease, 
long-lasting infection, etc.). The approach should be pre -defined and described in the Protocol  
and other study -related documents including determination of endpoint and/or statistical 
analysis plan.  
 
 
Definition of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256796]  
 
1. Ischemic discomfort (angina pectoris or equivalent symptoms) ≥ 10 minutes  
 at rest or  
 with increased intensity and frequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_256797].  
 
AND  
 
2. Unscheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21342] [ADDRESS_312227] 24 -hour stay (or change 
of calendar date if the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256798]).  
 
AND  
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312228] on e of the below -mentioned:  
 
a. New change in ST or T -wave or their aggravation on ECG at rest (with no 
confounding factor s including left bunch branch block or left ventricular 
hypertrophy)  
 
 Temporary ST elevation (< 20 min)  
New ST elevation at J -point on two adjacent electrodes with separation point:  
≥ 0.1 mV for all electrodes except for V2 -V3 to which the following separation 
points are applicable: ≥ 0.2 mV for males aged ≥ 40 years old (≥  0.25 mV for 
males aged < 40 years old) or ≥ 0.15 mV for females.  
 ST depression and modification of T -wave  
New h orizontal or descending ST depression ≥ 0.05 mV on two adjacent 
electrodes and/or new inversion of T -wave ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_312229] or R/S > 1.  
 
b. Myocardial ischemia is definitely suspected by:  
 early positive physical exercise test,  i.e. ST elevation or ST depression ≥ 2 mm 
up to 5 metabolic equivalents  
OR 
 stress -echocardiography (reversible wall movement deviation) OR 
 myocardial scintigraphy (reversible perfusion defect) OR 
 MRI (deficit of myocardial perfusion at pharmacological burden).  
   
and presumed association with the symptoms/signs of myocardial ischemia.  
 
c. Angiographic evidence of a new lesion site or aggravation a pre -existing site ≥ 70% 
(≥ 50% for left main site) and/or clot in epi[INVESTIGATOR_256799]/signs.  
 
d. Necessity in coronary revascularization (PCI or CABG) due to the site causing acute 
condition according to 3c criterion. This criterion will be met if revascularization 
was carried out during unscheduled hospi [INVESTIGATOR_256800].  
 
AND  
 
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312230]-2021 Page 84 of 98 4. Negative cardiac biomarkers and lack of MI evidence  
 
General provisions  
 
1. Escalation of pharmacotherapy at ischemia including intravenous administration of nitrates 
or elevation of β-adrenoblocker dose should be considered as supporting but not diagnosing 
unstable angina. However, typi[INVESTIGATOR_256801] 3 are insufficient to verify 
classification of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256802].  
 
2. If the subjects are admitted with suspected unstable angina and further testing reveals non-
cardiac or non -ischemic etiology, this event should not be recorded as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256803]. Potential ischemic events meeting MI criteria should not be considered as 
unstable angina.  
3. Scheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256804]. For example,  
 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] a subject with stable effort angina for coronary angiography and PCI 
based on positive outpatient stress test should not be considered as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256805].  
 
 Repeated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] a subject meeting the criteria of unstable angina which has 
been stabilized, with further discharge and repeated h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_256806] a second hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256802].  
  
4. A subject undergoing elective catheterization after coronary artery disease is diagnosed and 
further undergoing coronary revascularization does not meet hospi [INVESTIGATOR_256807].  
 
 
Definition of heart failure  
 
Heart failure  includes hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256808]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256809]. If 
emergency visits are included into HF endpoint, the number of emergency visits should be 
specified separately from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256810]:  
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312231]-2021 Page 85 of 98  
1) The subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256811]  
 
2) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256812] 24 hours  (or change of calendar date if admission and 
discharge time are lacking)  
 
3) Upon admission the subject has new or aggravated pre -existing symptoms due to HF 
including at least ONE  of the following:  
 
a. Dyspnea (exertional dyspnea, dyspnea at rest, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal 
dyspnea)  
b. Decreased exercise tolerance  
c. Fatigue  
d. Other symptoms of decreased perfusion of the target organ or volume overload 
(should be specified or described in the Protocol ) 
 
4) The subject has objective evidence of a new or aggravated pr e-existing HF including  at 
least TWO  results of physical examination OR one result of physical examination and 
at least ONE  laboratory test) including:  
 
a. Results of physical examination associated with heart failure including 
development of new or aggravat ion of pre -existing:  
 
i. Edema peripheral  
ii. Progressive bloating or ascites (without underlying liver disease)  
iii. Pulmonary rales/sounds  
iv. Increased jugular vein pressure and/or hepatojugular reflux  
v. Third heart sound gallop rhythm  
vi. Clinically relevant or rapid body weight gain presumably due to fluid 
retention  
 
b. Laboratory evidence of a new or aggravated pre -existing HF when obtained 
within [ADDRESS_312232] admission including:  
 
i. Increased level of natriuretic peptide B (BNP)/N -terminal fragment BNP 
(NT-proBNP) correlates  with heart failure decompensation (e.g. 
BNP  > 500 pg/mL or NT -proBNP > 2000 pg/mL). Subjects with 
chronically increased natriuretic peptide level should have significant 
increase above baseline.  
 
ii. Radiological confirmation of pulmonary congestion  
 
iii. Non-invasive diagnostic evidence of clinically relevant increased left or 
right ventricular filling pressure or low cardiac output. E.g. 
echocardiographic criteria may include: septal or lateral E/e’> 15 or > 12, 
respectively; D -dominant nature of pulmonary venous  inflow; plethoric 
inferior vena cava with minimum collapse at inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]; or moderate 
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312233] (LVOT) (time -velocity 
integral [TVI])  
  
OR 
 
iv. Invasive diagnostic evidence with right cardiac catheterization

Note : All results of diagnostic tests should be reported if any, even if they do 
not me et the criteria above as they provide important information to decide 
on these events.   
 
5) The subject receives at least ONE  of HF treatments below:  
 
 
a. Significant intensification of oral diuretic therapy (e.g. doubling dose of a loop 
diuretic, initiation of supporting therapy with a loop diuretic, initiation of 
combined diuretic therapy)  
b. Initiation of intravenous administration of a diuretic (even at a single dose) or 
vasoactive product (e.g. inotropic, vasoconstrictive, vasodilating agents)

ii. Mechanic fluid elimination (e.g. ultrafiltration, hemofiltration, dialysis)  
  
General considerations (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256739])  
 
Combined diuretic therapy may include 1) thiazide diuretic (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide, 
metolazone, chlorothiazide) + loop diuretic; or 2) mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist 
(MCRA) (e.g. spi[INVESTIGATOR_256813]) + loop diuretic.  
 
Emergency visit due to heart failure  is an event meeting all the criteria below:  
 
1) The subject seeks urgent unscheduled assistance from a physician or in an intensive care 
unit with the primary HF diagnosis but does not meet criteria for HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
2) The subject has all the signs and symptoms of HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e. 3),  
4) results of physical examination/laboratory tests evidencing new or aggravated pre -
existing HF as detailed above)  
3) The subject receives at least ONE of HF treatments below:   
 
a. Initiation of intravenous administration of a diuretic or vasoactive product (e.g. 
inotropic, vasoconstrictive, vasodilating agents)*  
 
b. Mechanic or surgical intervention including:

i. Mechanical circulatory support (e.g. aortic balloon pump, ventricular assist 
device, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, artificial heart)  
ii. Mechanic fluid elimination (e.g. ultrafiltration, hemofiltration, dialysis)  
 
* Note that significant intensification of oral diuretic therapy is NOT sufficient to meet 
urgent HF visit criteria.  
 
 
General considerations (urgent HF visit)  
 
1. Clinical visits for scheduled  therapy or procedures associated with HF (e.g. intravenous 
administration of diuretics, intravenous administration of vasoactive agents or mechanical 
fluid elimination) are NOT  qualified as HF without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
  
 
Definition of Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack  
 
Introduction  
 
These definitions of Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack apply to a wide range of clinical 
trials.  They are general, overarching, and widely applicable definitions combined with a specific 
clinical measurement of d isability.  They are flexible in their application and consistent with 
contemporary understanding of the pathophysiology of stroke.  This approach enables clinical 
trials to assess the clinically relevant consequences of vascular brain injury for determining  the 
safety or effectiveness of an intervention.  
 
The distinction between an Ischemic Stroke and a Transient Ischemic Attack is the presence of 
infarction.  Persistence of symptoms is an acceptable indicator of acute infarction.  Thus, duration 
of symptom pe rsistence that will be used to distinguish between transient ischemia and acute 
infarction should be defined for any clinical trial in which it is used.  
 
In trials involving patients with stroke, evidence of vascular central nervous system injury 
without r ecognized neurological dysfunction may be observed.  Examples include 
microhemorrhage, asymptomatic infarction, and asymptomatic hemorrhage.  When encountered, 
the clinical relevance of these findings may be unclear.  If appropriate for a given clinical trial , 
however, they should be precisely defined and categorized.  
 
Subdural hematomas are intracranial hemorrhagic events and not strokes.  
 
Transient Ischemic Attack  
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312235]-2021 Page 88 of 98  
Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as a transient epi[INVESTIGATOR_256814], spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], or retinal ischemia, without  acute infarction.  
 
Stroke  
 
Stroke is defined as an acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_256815], 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], or retinal vascular injury as a result of hemorrhage  or infarction.  
 
Classification:  
 
A. Ischemic Stroke  
 
Ischemic stroke is defined as an acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_196545], spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], or retinal 
dysfunction caused by [CONTACT_256904].  
 
Hemorrhage may be a consequence of ischemic stroke.  In this situation, the stroke is an 
ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation and not a hemorrhagic stroke.  
 
B. Hemorrhagic Stroke  
 
Hemorrhagic stroke is defined as an acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_256816], intraventricular, or subarachnoid hemorrhage.  
 
C. Undetermined Stroke  
 
Undetermined stroke is defined as an acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_256817], spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], or retinal vascular injury as a result 
of hemorrhage or infarction but with insufficient information to allow categorization as 
either ischemic or hemorrhagic.  
 
Stroke Disability  
 
Disability should be measured by a reliable and valid scale in all cases, typi[INVESTIGATOR_256818] 90 days after th e event.  For example, the modified Rankin Scale may be used to address 
this requirement:   
 
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312236]-2021 Page 89 of 98 Scale  Disability  
0 No symptoms at all  
1 No significant disability despi[INVESTIGATOR_5119]; able to carry out all usual duties and 
activities  
2 Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own 
affairs without assistance  
3 Moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance  
4 Moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to at tend 
to own bodily needs without assistance  
5 Severe disability; bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and 
attention  
6 Dead  
 
 
Interventional Cardiology Definitions  
 
A. Clinical Definitions  
 
1. Clinically -Driven Target Lesion Revascularization : Revascularization is clinically -
driven if the target lesion diameter stenosis is > 50% by [CONTACT_256905] (QCA) and the subject has clinical or functional ischemia which cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_256906].  Clinical or functional 
ischemia includes any of the following:  
 
a. A history of angina pectoris, presumably related to the target vessel  
b. Objective signs of ischemia at rest (electrocardiographic changes) or during exercise 
test (or equivalent), presumably related to the target vessel  
c. Abnormal results of any invasive functional diagnostic test [e.g., coronary flow 
reserve (CFR) or fractional flow reserve (FFR)]  
 
Comment : Target lesion revascularization (TLR) of a > 70% diameter stenos is by [CONTACT_256907] -driven.  
 
Comment : In the absence of QCA data or if a < 50% stenosis is present, TLR may be 
considered clinically -driven by [CONTACT_34164] (CEC) if severe ischemic 
signs and symptoms attributed to the target lesion are present.  
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312237]-2021 Page 90 of 98  
2. Non-Target Lesion and Non -Target Lesion Revascularization : A lesion  for which 
revascularization is not attempted or one in which revascularization is performed using 
a non -study device, respectively.  
 
3. Non-Target Vessel and Non -Target Vessel Revascularization : A vessel for which 
revascularization is not attempted or one in  which revascularization is performed using 
a non -study device, respectively.  
 
4. Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) Status : 
 
a. Elective:  The procedure can be performed on an outpatient basis or during a 
subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256819] (MI) or 
death.  For stable in -patients, the procedure is being performed during this 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256820]'s clinical situation demands the procedure prior to discharge.  
 
b. Urgent:  The procedure should be performed on an inpatient basis and prior to 
discharge because of significant concerns that there is risk of myocardial ischemia, 
MI, and/or death. Patients who are outpatients or in the emergency department at the 
time th at the cardiac catheterization is requested would warrant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256821].   
 
c. Emergency:  The procedure should be performed as soon as possible because of 
substantial concerns that ongoing myocardial ischemia and/or MI  could lead to 
death.  "As soon as possible" refers to a patient who is of sufficient acuity that one 
would cancel a scheduled case to perform this procedure immediately in the next 
available room during business hours, or one would activate the on -call tea m were 
this to occur during off -hours.  
 
d. Salvage:  The procedure is a last resort. The patient is in cardiogenic shock when the 
PCI begins (i.e., the time at which the first guide wire or intracoronary device is 
introduced into a coronary artery or by[CONTACT_256908]) OR within the last ten minutes prior to the start of the case or 
during the diagnostic portion of the case, the patient has also received chest 
compressions or has been on unanticipated circulatory support (e.g., intra -aortic 
balloon pump, extracorpore al membrane oxygenation, or cardiopulmonary support).  
 
5. Percutaneous Coronary Intervention  (PCI):  Placement of an angioplasty guide wire, 
balloon, or other device (e.g., stent, atherectomy catheter, brachytherapy delivery device, 
or thrombectomy catheter) i nto a native coronary artery or coronary artery by[CONTACT_256909].  In the assessment of the 
severity of coronary lesions with the use of intravascular ultrasound, coronary flow 
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312238]-2021 Page 91 of 98 reserve (CFR), or fractiona l flow reserve (FFR), insertion of a guide wire will NOT  be 
considered PCI.  
 
6. Procedural Success : Achievement of < 30 % residual diameter stenosis of the target 
lesion assessed by [CONTACT_256910] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256822] (MAC E, a composite of death, MI, or repeat coronary revascularization of the 
target lesion).  Ideally, the assessment of the residual stenosis at the end of the procedure 
should be performed by [CONTACT_256911].  
 
Comment : For some device interventions (e.g., balloon angioplasty), achievement of  
< 50% diameter stenosis by [CONTACT_256912].  
 
7. Target Lesion : Any lesion treated or attempted to be treated during the PCI with the 
study device.  The target lesion includes the arterial segment treated with the study device 
(stent, in most cases) plus 5 mm proximal and 5 mm distal to the treatment site.  
 
8. Target Lesion Failure  (TLF):  The composite of ischemia -driven revascularization of 
the target lesion, MI related to the target vessel, or cardiac death related to the target 
vessel.  If it cannot be determined with certainty whether the MI or death was related to 
the target vessel, it is considered a TLF.  
 
9. Target Lesi on Revascularization  (TLR):  Any repeat percutaneous intervention of the 
target lesion (including 5 mm proximal and 5 mm distal to the target lesion) or surgical 
by[CONTACT_256913].  In the assessment of TLR, angiograms should be assessed by [CONTACT_214703] (if designated) and made available to the CEC for review 
upon request.  
 
10. Target Vessel : A major native coronary artery (e.g., left main coronary artery, left  
anterior descending coronary artery, left circumflex coronary artery, or right coronary 
artery) or by[CONTACT_256914].  A native coronary artery target vessel 
includes the arterial segments upstream and downstream to the target lesio n plus major 
side branches.  
 
11. Target Vessel Failure  (TVF):  The composite of ischemia -driven revascularization of 
the target vessel, MI related to the target vessel, or cardiac death related to the target 
vessel.  If it cannot be determined with certainty whe ther the MI or death was related to 
the target vessel, it is considered a TVF.  
 
12. Target Vessel, Non -Target Lesion, and Target Vessel, Non -Target Lesion 
Revascularization : Any lesion or revascularization of a lesion in the target vessel other 
than the target  lesion, respectively.  
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312239]-2021 Page 92 of 98  
13. Target Vessel Revascularization  (TVR):  Any repeat percutaneous intervention or 
surgical by[CONTACT_256915].  In the assessment of TVR, 
angiograms should be assessed by [CONTACT_256911] (if designated) and 
made available to the CEC for review upon request.  
 
14. Vascular Complications :  
 Access site hematoma:  Development of a new, localized collection of blood at a 
vascular access site sufficient to produce a palpable mass within 72 hours of a 
procedure.  
 Arteriovenous fistula:  Development of a new, unintended communication between 
an artery and a vein occurring at a vascular access site within 72 hours of a procedure.  
 Peripheral ischemia:  Development of new arterial insufficiency sufficient to 
produce clinical signs or symptoms of ischemia (pallor, pain, paresthesia) distal to a 
vascular access site within 72 hours of a procedure.  
 Peripheral nerve injury:  Development of new sensory or motor loss of peripheral 
nerve function from external nerve co mpression (e.g., as a result of positioning 
during a procedure), or internal compression or direct nerve damage from the 
procedure, occurring within 72 hours of a procedure.  
 Pseudoaneurysm:  Development of a new localized collection of blood with a 
persistent communication (neck) originating at a vascular access site and occurring 
within 72 hours of a procedure.  
 Retroperitoneal hemorrhage:  Development of new bleeding into the 
retroperitoneal space originating at a vascular access site and occurring w ithin 72  
hours of a procedure.  
 
B. Angiographic Definitions  
 
1. Abrupt Closure : New intra -procedural severely reduced flow (TIMI grade 0 -1) within 
the target vessel that persists and requires intervention by [CONTACT_13774], or 
results in MI or d eath.  Abrupt closure requires an association with a vascular dissection, 
thrombus, or severe spasm at the treatment site or within the instrumented vessel.

3. Dissection : 
Based on the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Dissection 
Classification System:  
 Grade A:  Minor radiolucencies within the lumen during contrast injection with no 
persistence after dye clearance  
 Grade B: Parallel tracts or double lumen separated by a radiolucent area during 
contrast injection with no persistence after dye clearance  
 Grade C:  Extraluminal cap with persistence of contrast after dye clearance from the 
lumen  
 Grade D:  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_256823]  
 Grade E:  New persistent  filling defect with delayed antegrade flow  
 Grade F:  Non-A-E types with total coronary occlusion and no distal antegrade flow  
 
Note : Grade E and F dissections may represent thrombus  
 
4. Late Loss : Minimum lumen diameter (MLD) assessed at follow -up angiography  minus 
the MLD assessed immediately after the index procedure.  MLDs are measured by [CONTACT_13775].  
 
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312244]-2021 Page 97 of 98 5. Minimum Lumen Diameter  (MLD):  The mean minimum lumen diameter (typi[INVESTIGATOR_256824] -lesion, in -stent, and in -segment) derived from two orthogonal views by 
[CONTACT_13775].  
 
6. No Reflow : An acute reduction in coronary flow (TIMI grade 0 -1) in the absence of 
dissection, thrombus, spasm, or high -grade residual stenosis at the original target lesion.  
 
7. Percent Diameter Stenosis (% DS):  The value calculated as 100 x (1 – MLD/RVD) 
using the mean values determined by [CONTACT_256916] (when possible).   
 
8. Reference Vessel Diameter  (RVD):  Defined as the average of normal segments within 
10 mm proximal and 10 mm distal to the target lesion from two orthogonal views using 
QCA.   
 
9. Restenosis : Re-narrowing of the vessel following the treatment of a prior stenosis  
 
 Binary restenosis : A diameter stenosis of > 50% at the previously treated lesion 
site, including the originally treated site plus the adjacent vascular segments 5 mm 
proximal and 5 mm distal to the site.  
 
 In-stent restenosis (ISR) : A previously stented lesion with a > 50% diameter. 
stenosis.  
 
10. Thrombus (Angiographic) : A discrete, mobile, intraluminal filling defect with defined 
borders with or without associated contrast staining.  
 
11. TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Flow Grades :  
 
 Grade 0  (no perfusion):  There is no antegrade flow beyond the point of occlusion.
  
 
 Grade 1  (penetration without perfusion):  The contrast material passes beyond the 
area of obstruction but “hangs up” and fails to opacify the entire coronary bed distal 
to the obstruction for the duration of the cineangiographic filming sequence.  
 
 Grade 2  (partial perfusion):  The contrast material passes across the obstruction and 
opacifies the coronary be d distal to the obstruction.  However, the rate of entry of 
contrast material into the vessel distal to the obstruction or its rate of clearance from 
the distal bed (or both) is perceptibly slower than its entry into or clearance from 
  Protocol CL04018075  
 version 4.[ADDRESS_312245]-2021 Page 98 of 98 comparable areas not p erfused by [CONTACT_256917] (e.g., the opposite 
coronary artery or the coronary bed proximal to the obstruction).  
 
 Grade 3  (complete perfusion):  Antegrade flow into the bed distal to the obstruction 
occurs as promptly as antegrade flow into t he bed proximal to the obstruction and 
clearance of contrast material from the involved bed is as rapid as from an 
uninvolved bed in the same vessel or the opposite artery.

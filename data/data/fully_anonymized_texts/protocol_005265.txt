Amendment 05 14-May- 2019 As this is designed to be a 
global study across multiple countries, randomization in 
each country will be targeted 
to approximately 35% or less 
of the total sample size. This change is being implemented to achieve geographical 
representation across 
countries and to minimize the potential for any single country to have a disproportionate impact on the overall efficacy and/or safety profile.
Other changes include:
-Updated text in the 
definition of sPGA in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] to be consistent with 
the description in Appendix
5. 
-Updated the description for 
the following endpoints: ‘Time to relapse until Week 52’ and ‘Time to rebound in

Amendment 06 06-June- 2019 Revised the testing order 
(hierarchy) of key secondary endpoints  and revised the text in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS] accordingl
y as follows: 
xRemoved endpoints 
containing ‘PSSD sign 
score.’ The reason for this 
change is that PSSD sign 
score is redundant with components assessed by 
[CONTACT_82719].
xRemoved ‘change from baseline in DLQI score.’ 
The r eason for this change 
is that DLQI endpoint 
‘DLQI 0/1 among subjects with baseline DLQI score ≥2’ is 
clinically meaningful and is already in the hierarchy.

Rationale:
The primary purpose of this global revised protocol is to outli ne changes resulting from visits being 
missed or conducted remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, includ ing:
• method of study treatment assignment when COVID-19-related issu es result in the 
Week 24 and/or subsequent visits being missed or conducted remo tely 
• statistical impacts due to COVID-19
Changes made to the previous version of the global protocol and the rationale for these changes 
are noted below in the summary of key changes table. All change s applied to the protocol body 
were applied to the synopsis, as necessary; synopsis changes ar e not included in the summary of 
key changes table. Only major additions and deletions are provided in this summary document; all 
minor grammatical, formatting, stylis tic changes, or clarificat ions as well as organizational 
changes are not included.

remotely , the study treatment assigned by [CONTACT_82720], because PASI 
assessments will no t be done. Study t reatment assignment will be 
done as per the following:

[CONTACT_82722] -[ADDRESS_90171] on 
Safety VariablesNew Section Text:
9.[ADDRESS_90172] on Efficacy Endpoints 
There are no COVID -19-related impacts to the Week 16 efficacy 
endpoints as all subjects remaining in the trial completed the 
Week 16 visit prior to COVID -19 site restrictions. Efficacy 
endpoints involving Week 24 and later visits may b e impacted by  
[CONTACT_4113] -19 in the form of missing data and/or study treatment 
assignment defaulting to B MS-986165. 
Censoring rules will be applied to the PASI [ADDRESS_90173] Week 24:
xSubject ’sstudy treatment assignment was defaulted to 
BMS-[ADDRESS_90174] will be censored at the time of the remote visit if relapse had 
not been observed already;
xSubject has missing visit(s) (ie, efficacy assessments 
not perf ormed) after Week 24 and assuming relapse 
was not observed prior to missed visit(s):
oIf the subject returns at a later visit and is 
found to have relapsed, midpoint imputation 
will be used to determine time-to- relapse (ie, 
midpoint of the censoring interval).
oIf the subject returns at a later visit and has not 
relapsed, then the subject will continue to be 
evaluated for relapse.
oIf the subject is discontinued from study 
treatment, then the s ubject will be censored at 
the time of study treatment discontinuat ion.
Sensitivity analyses for time -to-relapse may be performed with 
additional details provided in  the statistical analysis plan pr ior to 
database lock.
Data handling due to COVID -19-related issues for other efficacy 
endpoints  will be desc ribed in the statistical 
analysis plan prior to database lock.

1.1 Synopsis
Protocol Title: A Multi-Center, Randomized, Doubl e-Blind, Placebo- and Active 
Comparator-Controlled Phase 3 Study with Randomized Withdrawal and Retreatment to Evaluate 
the Efficacy and Safety of BMS-986165 in Subjects with Moderate -to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis
Short Title: Efficacy, Safety, and Durabi lity of Response of BMS-986165 vers us Placebo and 
Active Comparator in Subjects with Psoriasis
Study Phase: 3
Rationale:
BMS-986165 could be a therapeutic option for the treatment of s ubjects with moderate-to-severe 
plaque psoriasis based on results of a recently completed 12-we ek randomized Phase 2, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (Study IM011011) with 5 different BMS-986165 
treatment arms: 3 mg every other day (QOD); 3 mg once daily (QD ); 3 mg twice daily (BID); 
6 mg BID and 12 mg QD. Overall, 267 subjects were randomized (44 to 45 subjects per treatment 
arm) in the Phase [ADDRESS_90179] a 75% improvement in the  Psoriasis Area and Severity I ndex (PASI 75) after 12 weeks of 
treatment. Compared with the placebo treatment group (6.7%), 38 .6% (P = 0.0003), 68.9% 
(P < 0.0001), 66.7% (P < 0.0001), and 75% (P < 0.0001) of the sub jects treated with BMS-[ADDRESS_90180] equivalent 
efficacy as the 3 mg BID dose in Phase 2, in a larger global po pulation of subjects with stable 
moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and will assess the durability of a PASI 75 response after treatment withdrawal. 
Study Population:
Men and women ≥18 years of age diagnosed with stable (defined a s no morphology changes or 
significant flares of disease activity in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_82685]) moderate-to-severe plaque 
psoriasis for ≥ 6 months and with ≥10% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, who have a 
static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA) ≥3, a PASI score ≥1 2, and who are candidates for 
phototherapy or systemic therapy may be eligible to participate  in the study.

xTime to relapse until Week 52
Overall Design:
This will be a 52-week, multi-center, randomized double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and 
active comparator-controlled study in subjects with stable mode rate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. 
Subjects will undergo screening evaluations within 28 days prio r to administration of study 
medication to determine eligibility.Active Comparator-Controlled Period
Following the screening process, qualified subjects will be randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to one of 
the following 3 treatment groups:
xBMS-[ADDRESS_90185] 30 mg BID (with initial titration per label)
Randomization should not occur until at least 8 days after the screening visit to allow collection 
of PSSD data during screening in order to calculate a baseline PSSD score. Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_1617] (US/rest of the world), previou s biologic use for psoriasis, psoriatic 
arthritis or other inflammatory disease (yes/no), and body weig ht (≥90 kg and <90 kg). As this is 
designed to be a global study across multiple countries, randomization in each country will be targeted to approximately 35% or less of the total sample size. This change is being implemented 
Approved
2.[ADDRESS_90186] on the overall effica cy and/or safety profile.
xAt Week 16, subjects receiving placebo will be switched in a bl inded manner to 
BMS-986165 6 mg QD.
Subjects in the other treatment groups will continue their curr ent regimen through Week 24.
Randomized Withdrawal and Maintenance Period
At Week 24, subjects originally randomized to BMS-986165 6 mg Q D who do not achieve 
PASI 75 response will continue to receive BMS-986165 6 mg QD in a  blinded manner. Subjects 
who achieve PASI 75 response will enter the randomized withdrawa l and maintenance period. 
These subjects will be re-randomized in a blinded manner to one of the following 2 treatment 
groups in a 1:1 ratio:
xBMS-986165 6 mg QD
xPlacebo
If the subjects re-randomized to placebo experience a relapse a s defined below at any visit during 
this period, they will be treated with BMS-986165 6 mg QD until the end of the maintenance 
period (Week 52).
At Week 24, subjects receiving apremilast who achieve PASI [ADDRESS_90187] will be treated with BMS-986165 6 mg QD until the end o f the maintenance period 
(Week 52). Subjects who do not achieve PASI [ADDRESS_90188] a 50% loss of

as topi[INVESTIGATOR_82686] (WHO Classes I-V), only at this time point at the discretion 
of the investigator.
Number of Subjects: 
Approximately 1000 qualified subjects will be randomized in a 2 :1:[ADDRESS_90190] 30 mg BID, and placebo, respectively. This sample size will provide 
adequate power (≥90%) to compare BMS -986165 6 mg QD with placebo for each of the coprimary 
efficacy endpoints (sPGA 0/1 and PASI 75 at Week 16) and BMS-[ADDRESS_90191] for sPGA 0/1 and PASI 75 (Week 16).

Statistical Methods:General Methodology
The primary efficacy analysis population will be the Full Analy sis Set (FAS). The FAS will 
include all randomized subjects who are dispensed study drug. 
The analysis model for the coprimary efficacy endpoints and sec ondary binary endpoints will use 
stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) tests stratified by [CONTACT_82723] (US and rest of 
world), prior biologic treatment use for psoriasis, psoriatic a rthritis or other inflammatory disease
(yes/no), and body weight (≥90 kg and <90 kg) to compare the re sponse rates of BMS-[ADDRESS_90194] udy prior to Week 16, start a 
protocol prohibited medication/therapy that could improve psori asis during the first [ADDRESS_90195] otherwis e missing endpoint data at the s pecified timepoint.
The analysis model for continuous secondary endpoints will use analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment, geographic region (US and rest of world), prior biologic treatment 
use for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis or other inflammatory di sease (yes/no), and body weight 
(≥90 kg and <90 kg) as fixed effects. The baseline value will be adde d into the model as a

Testing Strategy f or Efficacy Endpoints
The primary family of coprimary e ndpoints will each be tested at a Type I error =0.[ADDRESS_90198] and, if 
significant for both endpoints, testing will proceed for the se condary family of key secondary 
endpoints . The primary family of coprimary endpoints will be the serial  gatekeeper for 
proceeding with testing of the secondary family of key secondary  efficacy endpoints.
Primary Family –Coprimary endpoints compared with placebo; both must be significant at a Type 
I error=0.05 in order to proceed with the secondary family tests  for the key secondary endpoints: 
xPrimary 1: Proportion of subjects who achieve sPGA 0/1 at Week 16
xPrimary 2: Proportion of subjects who achieve PASI 75 at Week 16
In order to control for Type I error rate inflation within the secondary family of key secondary 
endpoints, separate testing branches with a 2-sided Type I error= 0.[ADDRESS_90199] may only proceed to the next 
key secondary endpoint within each testing branch if the null h ypothesis is rejected at a Type I 
error=0.025. If an endpoint fails at any step, then all subsequ ent comparisons will be considered 
descriptive.
Please refer to Section 9.8.[ADDRESS_90200] on efficacy endpoints due to COVID-19.
Safety Analysis
Safety data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables and frequency distributions (counts and 
percentages) for categorical variables.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder, characterize d primarily by [CONTACT_82731], that affects up to 3% of the general population. Men a nd women are equally affected and 
it can present at any age.1,2Several studies have observed a bimodal distribution of psorias is onset 
with the first peak ranging from [ADDRESS_90210] common form of psoriasis (58% to 97% of cases) is plaq ue psoriasis 
(psoriasis vulgaris), with less common forms being guttate, pus tular, inverse (flexural), and 
erythrodermic psoriasis. The disease can have a fluctuating rel apsing course, with flares that may 
be induced by [CONTACT_82732], trauma, smoking, and stress.3Psoriasis can involve skin 
in any part of the body; particularly disabling is the involvem ent of specific anatomic regions, such 
as hands and feet (palmoplantar), face, scalp, and nails. Disease severity can be classified by [CONTACT_82733] (BSA) involvement with mild defined as ≤ 10% BSA, and moderate-to-severe as
> 10% BSA.6Psoriasis has a profound impact on quality of life and can lead to psychological, 
social, and economic consequences, especially in moderate-to-se vere disease. This condition is 
also associated with an increased risk of depression, occurrenc e of sleep disturbances, social 
stigma, and decreased work productivity.7,8Commonly associated comorbidities found in 
psoriasis patients include diabetes mellitus and metabolic synd rome. In patients with more severe 
forms of the disease, life expectancy is decreased due to an in crease of cardiovascular risk.9
Treatments include topi[INVESTIGATOR_82690], eg, corticosteroids, v itamin D analogues, calcineurin 
inhibitors, and salicylic acid; phototherapy modalities, includ ing psoralens with ultraviolet A 
(PUVA) and narrow band ultraviolet B (UVB); and systemic therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014]. In moderate-to-severe 
disease, systemic treatments are usually needed and may include  oral agents (retinoids, 
methotrexate, cyclosporine, and a premilast) or injectables (eg,  biologics such as tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF) inhibitors etanercep t, infliximab, and adalimumab) anti-IL-12/23p40 antibody 
(ustekinumab), IL-17 antagonists (secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab), and anti-IL-23p19
antibody (guselkumab). Many of these treatments are associated with increased risk of adverse 
events (AEs) such as hepatotoxicity and neutropenia (methotrexa te);10nephrotoxicity 
(cyclosporine);11depression and weight loss (apremilast);12serious infections (cytokine 
inhibitors);13,14,15,16and candidiasis and Crohn’s disease (IL-17 antagonists).16,17,18
Although effective therapeutic options are available, under-treatment or non-treatment of psoriasis 
has been reported in up to half of surveyed patients (based on absence of treatment and/or 
dissatisfaction with treatment).19Many patients with severe disease are still being managed with 
only topi[INVESTIGATOR_8593],4,8and many patients consider their psoriasis treatment to be inad equate. 
Accordingly, there remains a need for more effective oral optio ns, when compared with currently 
available agents, that would improve efficacy responses and inc rease adherence to treatment.
2.1 Study Rationale
BMS-986165 could be a therapeutic option for the treatment of s ubjects with moderate-to-severe 
plaque psoriasis based on results of a recently completed 12-we ek randomized Phase 2, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study with 5 different BMS-9 [ZIP_CODE] treatment arms: 3 mg every

(Study IM011011). Overall, 267 subjects were randomized (44 to 45  subjects per treatment arm) 
in the Phase [ADDRESS_90211] a 
75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) after 12 weeks of treatment. 
Compared with placebo treatment group, in which 6.7% of the sub jects achieved PASI 75 
response, 38.6% (P = 0.0003), 68.9% (P < 0.0001), 66.7% (P < 0.0001), and 75% (P < 0.0001) of subjects treated with 3 mg QD, 3 mg BID, 6 mg BID, and 12 mg QD  achieved PASI 75, 
respectively. The PASI 75 responses plateaued at a dose of 3 mg BID. Also, there was a clinically 
significant proportion of subjects treated with BMS-986165 achi eving an sPGA score of 0 or 1 
compared with placebo at Week 12. Compared with the placebo tre atment group in which 6.7% 
of the subjects achieved an sPGA score of 0 or 1, 41.5%, 75.6%, 65.9%, and 75% of the subjects 
treated with 3 mg QD, 3 mg BID, 6 mg BID, and 12 mg QD achieved an sPGA score of 0 or 1, 
respectively with responses again plateauing at dose of 3 mg BID. The Phase 3 dose selected 
(6 mg QD) is expected to demonstra te equivalent efficacy to the [ADDRESS_90212], in a larger global population of 
subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. 
2.2 Background
Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase associated with receptors for the 
p40-containing cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and IL 23, as well  as the Type I interferon (IFN) 
receptor, and is required for the activation of their downstrea m signaling pathways. TYK2 
catalyzes the phosphorylation of the intracellular receptor dom ains and signal transducer and 
activator of transcription (STAT) proteins resulting in the activation of STAT-dependent 
transcription and functional responses specific for these cytok ines.
20,21,22Because TYK2-
dependent cytokines (eg, Type I IFNs, IL-12, IL-23) are distinct from those dependent on closely 
related Janus kinase (JAK) family members JAK1/JAK3 (eg, IL-2, IL-15, IL-7) or JAK2 (eg, 
erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, a TYK2 
inhibitor would be expected to have a highly differentiated pro file from inhibitors of other JAK 
family kinases. TYK2 dependent pathways and the cytokine networ ks they modulate (eg, IL-
23/IL- 17, IFNα) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of multiple immune -mediated 
diseases, including psoriasis, lupus, spondyloarthritides, and Crohn’s disease.
BMS-986165 is a potent, highly selective, oral small molecule i nhibitor of TYK2. A 
comprehensive in vitro and in vivo characterization of BMS-9861 65 has been established and 
supports the development of this compound in humans. Inhibition  of TYK2 is expected to provide 
therapeutic benefit for subjects with psoriasis for multiple re asons: 1) Many of the pathways in the

[IP_ADDRESS] Screening Period
Subjects will be evaluated during the screening period to ensur e that they meet eligibility criteria 
for this study. A detailed medical history will be done at this  time, as well as a complete PE. 
Psoriasis-related history, which will include length of diagnosi s (duration of disease), body surface 
involvement, and history of systemic treatment, will be assesse d here. Depression and suicidality 
assessments will also be performed. An evaluation for tuberculosis (TB) will be done based on 
medical history, recent chest imaging, and a QuantiFERON-TB Gol d test.
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Period
Qualified subjects who have completed the screening procedures and have met the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized on Day 1 in a 2:1:1 ratio, respectively, to one of 
the following 3 treatment groups:
xBMS-[ADDRESS_90221] titrated to 30 mg BID as follows:
oDay 1: 10 mg tablet in the morning
oDay 2: 10 mg tablet in the morning and evening
oDay 3: 10 mg tablet in the morning and 20 mg tablet in the even ing
oDay 4: 20 mg tablet in the morning and the evening
oDay 5: 20 mg tablet in the morning, and 30 mg tablet in the eve ning
oDay 6 and thereafter: 30 mg tablet in the morning and the eveni ng
Dummy tablets (placebo to the BMS-[ADDRESS_90222] 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg during titrat ion) will be administered to the 
subjects to maintain blinding. Additional details are provided in Section 6.1.
Randomization should not occur until at least 8 days after the screening visit to allow collection 
of PSSD data during screening in order to calculate a baseline PSSD score. Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_1617] (US and rest of world), previou s biologic use for psoriasis, psoriatic 
arthritis or other inflammatory disease (yes/no), and body weig ht (≥90 kg and <90 kg). As this is 
designed to be a global study across multiple countries, randomization in each country will be 
targeted to approximately 35% or less of the total sample size. This change is being implemented 
to achieve geographical representation across countries and to minimize the potential for any single 
country to have a disproportionate impact on the overall efficac y and/or safety profile.
[IP_ADDRESS] Week 16
The coprimary endpoints (sPGA 0/1 and PASI 75) will be assessed at Week 16. Subjects receiving 
placebo will be switched in a blinded manner to BMS-[ADDRESS_90223] 30 mg BID will c ontinue the same treatment 
through Week 24.
4.1.2 Randomized Withdrawal and Maintenance Period (Week 24-52)
The Randomized Withdrawal and Maintenance Period will start at Week 24 and continue to 
Week 52. The subjects who had been in the placebo arm and switch ed to BMS-986165 6 mg QD 
at Week 16 will continue t his treatment until Week 52.
[IP_ADDRESS] Week 24At Week 24, subjects originally randomized to BMS-986165 6 mg Q D who do not achieve 
PASI 75 response will continue to receive BMS-986165 6 mg QD in a  blinded manner. Subjects 
who achieve PASI 75 response will b e re-randomized in a blinded manner to one of the following 
2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio:
xBMS-986165 6 mg QD
xPlacebo
If the subjects who were re-randomized to placebo experience a relapse as defined below at any 
visit during this period, they will be switched back in a blind ed manner to  BMS-986165 6 mg QD 
until the end of the maintenance period (Week 52). Relapse will  be defined as at least a 50% loss

5.3.3 Activity
No restrictions are required; however, unusual physical exertio n should be avoided during the 
study.
5.4 Screen Failures
Screen failures are defined as subjects who consent to particip ate in the clinical study but are not 
subsequently randomized in the study for any reason. A minimal set of screen failure information 
is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subjects, to meet the Consolidated

from regulatory authorities. Minimal set of screen failure info rmation includes date of consent, 
demography, screen failure details (ie, eligibility criteria th at the subject did not meet), and any 
serious AEs during the screening period.
5.4.[ADDRESS_90241] is declared a screen failure. This is an effort 
to find all possible well-quali fied subjects. Consultation with  the medical monitor may be needed 
to identify whether repeat te sting of any particular parameter is clinically relevant.
The study permits the rescreening (after the end of the initial  28-day screening period) of a subject 
who discontinues the study as a pretreatment failure (ie, the subject fails to meet eligibility criteria 
and has not been treated). The subject must be reconsented and will be assigned a new 
identification number, and a full screening visit must be perfo rmed again. A subject can only be 
rescreened 1 time (ie, if the subject fails 1 rescreening attempt, no additional rescreening is allowed). Depending on the timing of rescreening, repeat chest imaging may not be required. 
Duration of existing treatments and required discontinuation pe riods shall be considered relative 
to the new screening visi t and/or randomization.
The most current result prior to randomization is the value by [CONTACT_35853], as it represents the subject’s most current clinical state.
6 TREATMENT
Study treatment is defined as any investigational treatment(s), marketed product(s), placebo, or 
medical device intended to be administered to a study subject a ccording to the study randomization 
or treatment allocation.
Study treatment includes both Investigational [Medicinal] Produ ct (IP/IMP) and 
Non-investigational [Medicinal] Product (Non-IP/Non-IMP) and can consist of the following: 
BMS-986165, placebo, and apremilast.
An investigational product, also known as investigational medic inal product in some regions, is 
defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active substance or plac ebo being tested or used as a 
reference in a clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization but used 
or assembled (formulated or packaged) differently than the authorized form, or used for an 
unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.
Other medications used as support or escape medication for prev entative, diagnostic, or therapeutic 
reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diag nosis, may be considered as
non-investigational products. Table 5 shows the study treatments for Protocol IM011047.

6.2 Method of Treatment Assignment
Before the study is initiated, each user (at investigative site s) will receive log-in information and 
directions on how to access the interactive response technology  (IRT) system. At the time of the 
screening visit, immediately after informed consent is obtained and before any study-related 
procedures are performed, the investigative site will access the  enrollment option of the IRT 
system for assignment of a subject number for all subjects, inc luding subjects not subsequently 
randomized or treated. The subject number is assigned sequentia lly by [CONTACT_82740]. All enrolled subjects will be assigned  sequential subject numbers. The 
Approved
2.[ADDRESS_90246] is rescreened, they will be given 
a new identification number.
At Week 0 (Day 1), subjects who meet all criteria for enrollmen t at Screening and Day 1 will be 
centrally randomized in a 2:1:[ADDRESS_90247] 30 mg BID 
as determined by a computer-generated randomization schedule us ing IRT. The randomization 
lists will be generated by [CONTACT_82741] a permuted bloc k design within each combination 
of stratum level. The randomization in this study will be strat ified by [CONTACT_82742] (US and rest of world), previous biologic use for psoria sis, psoriatic arthritis or other 
inflammatory disease (yes/no), and body weight (≥90 kg and <90 kg). As this is designed to be a 
global study across multiple countries, randomization in each country will be targeted to 
approximately 35% or less of the total sample size. This change  is being implemented to achieve 
geographical representation across countries and to minimize th e potential for any single country 
to have a disproportionate impact  on the overall efficacy and/o r safety profile.
After all inclusion/exclusion cri teria have been met for a subje ct, the investigative site will access 
the IRT on Day [ADDRESS_90248]. Study treatment  will be dispensed at study visits as 
shown in the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3).
At Week 16, subjects receiving p lacebo will be switched in a blinded manner to BMS-[ADDRESS_90249] visit 
being missed or conducted remotely, the study treatment assigne d by [CONTACT_82743], because PASI assessment s will not be done. Study 
treatment assignment will be done as per the following:
o Missed visits: the study treatment assigned by [CONTACT_82744]  
o Visits conducted remotely: the study treatment assigned by [CONTACT_941] I RT system will be 
defaulted to BMS-986165 6 mg QD for the duration of the study
6.3 Blinding
6.3.1 Maintaining the Blind
Blinded treatment assignments will be managed using IRT. 
All tablets are identical in appearance and will be supplied in  blister cards or bottles with each 
daily dose made up of the appropriate combination of active and/or placebo tablets to provide the 
correct treatment, as shown in Table [ADDRESS_90250]'s management , the blind for that subject may be 
broken by [CONTACT_093]. The subject’s safety takes priority  over any other considerations in 
determining if a treatment assignment should be unblinded.
Before breaking the blind of an individual subject's treatment,  the investigator should determine 
that the unblinded information is necessary, ie, that it will a lter the subject's immediate 
management. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is c learly not related to the 
investigational product, the problem may be properly managed by  [CONTACT_82745]. It is highly desirable that the decis ion to unblind treatment assignment 
Approved
2.[ADDRESS_90251] has been made.
In case of an emergency, the investigator has unrestricted acce ss to randomization information via 
IRT and is capable of breaking the blind through the IRT system without prior approval from the 
sponsor. After the unblinding, the investigator shall notify th e medical monitor and/or study 
director. The method of unblinding for emergency purposes is de scribed in the IRT manual. 
Subject and unblinded treatment information and the reason for the blind being broken must be 
recorded on the appropriate study  status page of the electronic case report form (eCRF). After 
unblinding via IRT, the investigator shall notify the medical m onitor.
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact [CONTACT_82746]. Any request to unblind a subject for non-emergency purposes must be 
discussed with the medical monitor prior to unblinding.

due to an AE, study treatment can be restarted in consultation with the medical monitor.
6.5 Preparation/Handling/Storage/AccountabilityThe investigational product should be stored in a secure area a ccording to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that investiga tional product is only dispensed to 
study subjects. The investigational product must be dispensed o nly from official study sites by 
[CONTACT_20443].
The product storage manager should ensure that the study treatm ent is stored in accordance with 
the environmental conditions (te mperature, light, and humidity)  as determined by [CONTACT_20444]. If 
concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study treat ment arise, the study treatment 
should not be dispensed and BMS should be contact[CONTACT_15608] .

8.1.1 Investigator-administered Assessments
[IP_ADDRESS] static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA)
The sPGA is a 5-point scale of an average assessment of all pso riatic lesions based on erythema, 
scale, and induration.24The sPGA measure determines ps oriasis severity at a single poin t in time 
(without taking into account the baseline disease condition) as  clear (0), almost clear (1), mild (2), 
moderate (3), or severe (4). sPGA assessments should be perform ed by a trained physician (eg, 
dermatologist) or appropriately trained investigator who is exp erienced in the assessment of 
psoriasis patients. Every effort should be made to ensure that the physician or designee who 
performed the sPGA evaluations for a subject at randomization p erforms the sPGA for that subject 
at all subsequent visits (see APPENDIX 5 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)
The PASI is a measure of the average redness, thickness, and sc aliness of psoriatic skin lesions 
(each graded on a 0 -4 scale), weighted by [CONTACT_82755] (head, arms, trunk to groin, and 
legs to top of buttocks).25PASI produces a numeric score that can range from [ADDRESS_90269] a 50% improvement 
in PASI score as compared with the baseline value. The PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI [ADDRESS_90270] a training session prior to in itiation of the study to demonstrate 
proper PASI scoring. PASI assessments should be performed by a trained physician

(40 handprints). BSA assessments should be performed by a dermat ologist or appropriately trained 
investigator who is experienced in the assessment of psoriasis patients.
[IP_ADDRESS] scalp specific Physician’s Global Assessment (ss -PGA)
For this assessment in subjects with scalp involvement,29scalp lesions are evaluated in terms of 
clinical signs of redness, thic kness, and scaliness and scored on the following 5-point ss-PGA 
scale:
0 = absence of disease, 1 = very mild disease, 2 = mild disease , 3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe 
disease.

The PGA-F will be performed only in subjects with psoriatic fin gernail involvement to assess 
severity and subsequent improvement. An example is provided in APPENDIX [ADDRESS_90271] or appropriately trained  investigator who is experienced

clinical trials.37The PSSD  assesses severity of 5 symptoms (itch, pain, stinging, burning,  skin  
tightness) and [ADDRESS_90273]-observed signs (skin dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding or flaking, 
redness, bleeding) using 0 to10 numerical ratings. The severity  of each item is rated on an 11-point 
numeric rating scale ranging from 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imagin able). Two versions of the PSSD 
were developed, one with a 24-hour recall period (PSSD-24h) and one with a 7-day recall period. 
The PSSD-24h will be administered daily in this trial to avoid recall bias with a longer recall period

The investigator and any designees are responsible for detectin g, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain resp onsible for following up AEs that 
are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the s tudy, or that caused the subject to

Such events may require further investigation  to better charac terize and understand them. In the 
BMS-986165 clinical development program, certain skin-related A Es (eg, acne), infection AEs, 
and CK elevation have been identified as potential AEIs; however, there has been no definitive 
assessment on the causal relationship between these events and treatment with BMS-986165. 
Additionally, given a potential association between treatment fo r autoimmune diseases and

collected on the case report form in order to better characterize and understand them.
8.2.2 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
The collection of nonserious AE information should begin at ini tiation of study treatment until
discharge from the study (ie, final study visit for a given sub ject), at the timepoints specified in the 
Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3).
The Reference Safety Information in Sections 5.6.[ADDRESS_90278]’s written consent to 
participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not rela ted to study drug, must be collected, 
including those thought to be associated with protocol-specifie d procedures.
All SAEs must be collected from the date of subject’s written c onsent until [ADDRESS_90279]’s participation in the study if the last scheduled visit occurs at a 
later time. Monitoring for SAEs will occur at every study visit . 
xThe investigator must report any SAE that occurs after these ti me periods and that is believed 
to be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure. Medical occurrences that begin 
before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informe d consent will be recorded on the 
appropriate section of the CRF.
xAll SAEs will be recorded and reported to Sponsor or designee w ithin [ADDRESS_90280] has been 
discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reaso nably related to the study treatment 
or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify t he sponsor.
The method of evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAE s and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in APPENDIX [ADDRESS_90281]. (In order to prevent r eporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specifi c occurrence of one or more AEs .)
8.2.4 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
xNonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilizatio n, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see APPENDIX 3 ).
xFollow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interr uption or discontinuation of 
study treatment and for those present at the end of study treatment as appropriate.
xAll identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on  the nonserious AE page of 
the CRF. Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for A Es and/or laboratory 
abnormalities that are reported /identified during the course of the study.

All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting the defined criteri a, must be reported as SAEs (see 
Section 8.2and APPENDIX 3 for reporting details). Wherever possible, timely confirmation of 
initial liver-related laboratory abnormalities should occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI 
event.
Potential drug-induced liver injury is defined as: 
1)Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (A ST) elevation > [ADDRESS_90284]
AND2)Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_90285], without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),
AND
3)No other immediately apparent possible causes of liver function  test elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or acute 
liver disease, or the administr ation of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.

Any significant worsening of a pre-existing medical condition n oted during interim or final PE, 
ECG, x-ray filming, any other potential safety assessment requi red or not required by [CONTACT_82757] a nonser ious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.
8.3 OverdoseFor this study, taking more than 2 days’ worth of study treatme nt within a 24 -hour time period will 
be considered an overdose.
In the event of an overdose the investigator should:
1)Contact [CONTACT_10990]
2)Closely monitor the subject for AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnorma lities
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be  made by [CONTACT_82758].

discontinuation, AEs by [CONTACT_764], and AEs by [CONTACT_82761]. All TEAEs as well  as AEIs, and each AE 
adjudicated category (ie, infect ions, cardiovascular, and suici dal ideation/behavior) will also be 
summarized by [CONTACT_82762]. 
9.5.[ADDRESS_90308] deviation, medi an, minimum, and maximum 
unless otherwise specified.
9.6.2 Prior and Concomitant Medications
Prior and concomitant medicati ons, categorized by [CONTACT_82763] (WHO) Drug Dictionary, will be su mmarized by [CONTACT_82764]-treated population. Medications with an end date prior to th e first dose of study drug will be
considered prior medications.
9.6.[ADDRESS_90309] of relevant protocol deviations on the primary efficacy results will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_82765] i n supportive analyses of the 
primary efficacy endpoints. Relevant protocol deviations to be c onsidered regarding exclusion of 
subjects from the FAS will include the following:
xSubject randomized but did not  take any study treatment
xSubject failed to meet any study inclusion criteria but was ran domized to receive study 
treatment
xSubject met a study exclusion criterion which may have an impact  on the coprimary 
efficacy endpoints but was randomi zed to receive study treatmen t
xSubject non-compliant with study treatment within the first 16 weeks of treatment; defined 
as <80% compliant with study treatment 
xSubject took prohibited concomitant medication prior to Week [ADDRESS_90310] on Efficacy Endpoints 
There are no COVID-19-related impacts to the Week 16 efficacy e ndpoints as all subjects 
remaining in the trial completed the Week 16 visit prior to COV ID-19 site restrictions. Efficacy 
endpoints involving Week 24 and later visits may be impacted by  [CONTACT_4113]-19 in the form of 
missing data and/or a treatment a ssignment defaulting to BMS-986165.
Censoring rules will be applied to the PASI [ADDRESS_90311] Week 24:
xSubject study treatment assignment was defaulted to BMS-[ADDRESS_90312] will be censored at the time of the remo te visit if relapse had not 
been observed already;
xSubject has missing visit(s) (ie, efficacy assessments not perf ormed) after Week 24 and 
assuming relapse was not observed prior to missed visit(s):
oIf the subject returns at a later visit and is found to have re lapsed, midpoint 
imputation will be used to determine time-to-relapse (ie, midpoint of the censoring 
interval).
oIf the subject returns at a later visit and has not relapsed, t hen the subject will 
continue to be evaluated for relapse.
oIf the subject is discontinued from study treatment, then the subject will be 
censored at the time of st udy treatment discontinuation.
Sensitivity analyses for time-to-relapse may be performed with additional details provided in the 
statistical analysis plan prior to database lock.
Data handling due to COVID-19-related issues for other efficacy  endpoints  will 
be described in the statistical ana lysis plan prior to database  lock.

2.[ADDRESS_90313] on Safety Variables
No modifications are planned for the analysis of safety data du e to COVID-19-related issues. There 
will not be any additional safety data handling considerations for missing data or treatment 
interruptions due to COVID-19.

Regulatory and Ethical Considerations
Good Clinical Practice
This study will be conducted in accordance with:
xGood Clinical Practice (GCP), 
xas defined by [CONTACT_25039] (ICH)
xin accordance with the ethical  principles underlying European U nion Directive 2001/20/EC
x[LOCATION_002] Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (2 1CFR50) 
xapplicable local requirements.
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. Th e protocol and any amendments 
and the subject informed consent will receive approval/favorabl e opi[INVESTIGATOR_82702]/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC), and regulatory au thorities according to 
applicable local regulations prior to initiation of the study.
All potential serious breaches must be reported to Sponsor or d esignee immediately. A serious 
breach is a breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in c onnection with the study or the 
protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, t he safety or physical or mental integrity 
of the subjects of the study or the  scientific value of the study.
Personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by  [CONTACT_8640], training, and 
experience to perform their respective tasks.
This study will not use the services of study personnel where s anctions have been invoked or where 
there has been scientific mis conduct or fraud (eg, loss of medic al licensure, debarment). 
Institutional Review Board/ Independent Ethics Committee
Before study initiation, the inve stigator must have written and  dated approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_20291]/IEC for the protocol, consent form, subject recrui tment materials 
(eg, advertisements), and any other written information to be provided to subjects. The investigator 
or BMS should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the Inves tigator Brochure or product 
labeling information to be provide d to subjects and any updates . 
The investigator, Sponsor, or designee should provide the IRB/I EC with reports, updates, and other 
information (eg, expedited safety reports, amendments, and admi nistrative letters) according to 
regulatory requirements or institution procedures.
Compliance with the Protocol and Protocol Revisions
The investigator should not implement any deviation or change to the protocol without prior 
review and documented approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_82703] t from the IRB/IEC (and if 
applicable, also by [CONTACT_14306]) except where necess ary to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to study subjects. 
Approved
2.[ADDRESS_90320](s) prior to 
obtaining relevant approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649](s) the deviation or change will be submitted, as soon 
as possible to:
xIRB/IEC
xRegulatory Authority(ies), if a pplicable by [CONTACT_427] ( per national requirements)
Documentation of approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_82704](s)/IEC(s) and if applicable, also by [CONTACT_82768].
If an amendment substantially alters the study design or increa ses the potential risk to the subject: 
(1) the consent form must be revised and submitted to the IRB(s )/IEC(s) for review and 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]; (2) the revised form must be used to obtain consent from subjects 
currently enrolled in the study if they are affected by [CONTACT_20508]; and (3) the new form must 
be used to obtain consent from new subjects prior to enrollment .
If the revision is done via an administrative letter, investiga tors must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s).
Financial Disclosure
Investigators and sub-Investigators will provide the Sponsor wi th sufficient, accurate financial 
information in accordance with local regulations to allow the S ponsor to submit complete and 
accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to th e appropriate health authorities. 
Investigators are responsible for providing information on fina ncial interests during the course of 
the study and for [ADDRESS_90321] ensure that subjects are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential 
risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate. 
In situations where consent cannot be given to subjects, their l egally acceptable representatives (as 
per country guidelines) are clearly and fully informed about th e purpose, potential risks, and other 
critical issues regarding clinica l studies in which the subject volunteers to participate. 
Sponsor or designee will provide the investigator with an appropriate (ie, Global or Local) sample 
informed consent form which will include all elements required by [CONTACT_12212], GCP, and applicable 
regulatory requirements. The sample informed consent form will adhere to the ethical principles 
that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Investigators must:
xProvide a copy of the consent  form and written information abou t the study in the language in 
which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study pa rticipation. The language must be 
non-technical and easily understood. 
xAllow time necessary for subject or subject's legally acceptable representative to inquire about 
the details of the study.
Approved
2.[ADDRESS_90322]'s legally 
acceptable representative and by [CONTACT_35884] i nformed consent discussion. 
xObtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_82705], prior  to the beginning of the study, 
and after any revisions are com pleted for new information.
If informed consent is initially given by a subject’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subse quently becomes capable of makin g and communicating his or her 
informed consent during the study, consent must additionally be  obtained from the subject.
Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a perso n designated by [CONTACT_093], 
should fully inform the subject or the subject's legally accept able representative or legal guardian, 
of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new informatio n relevant to the subject's willingness 
to continue participation in the study. This communication shou ld be documented. 
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects mus t be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentiality rules appli cable to regulatory requirements , the subjects' signed ICF and, in the 
US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and regulatory authorities have direct 
access to subject records.
For minors, according to local legislation, one or both parents or a legally acceptable representative 
must be informed of the study procedures and must sign the info rmed consent form approved for 
the study prior to clinical study participation. The explicit w ish of a minor, who is capable of 
forming an opi[INVESTIGATOR_82706], or to be withdrawn 
from, the clinical study at any time should be considered by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator. 
Minors who are judged to be of an a ge of reason must also give their written assent.
Subjects unable to give their written consent (eg, stroke or su bjects with or severe dementia) may 
only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a legally acc eptable representative. The subject 
must also be informed about the nature of the study to the exten t compatible with his or her 
understanding, and should this subject become capable, he or sh e should personally sign and date 
the consent form as soon as possible. The explicit wish of a su bject who is unable to give his or 
her written consent, but who is capable of forming an opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] a nd assessing information to refuse 
participation in, or to be withdrawn from, the clinical study a t any time should be considered by 
[CONTACT_093].
The rights, safety, and well-being of the study subjects are th e most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.

Monitoring
Sponsor or designee representatives will review data centrally to identify potential issues to 
determine a schedule of on-si te visits for targeted review of s tudy records. 
Representatives of BMS must be allowed to visit all study site locations periodically to assess the 
data quality and study integrit y. On site they will review study records and directly compare them 
with source documents, discuss the conduct of the study with the investigator, and verify that the 
facilities remain acceptable. Certain CRF pages and/or electronic files may serve as the source 
documents.
In addition, the study may be evaluated by [CONTACT_82770], source documents , other study files, and study 
facilities. BMS audit reports will be kept confidential.
The investigator must notify BMS promptly of any inspections sc heduled by [CONTACT_12721], 
and promptly forward copi[INVESTIGATOR_82707]. 
Records Retention
The investigator (or head of the study site in Japan) must reta in all study records and source 
documents for the maximum period required by [CONTACT_35888], or 
institution procedures, or for the period specified by [CONTACT_35889] d esignee, whichever is longer. The 
investigator (or head of the study site in Japan) must contact [CONTACT_35890].
BMS or designee will notify the investigator (or head of the st udy site in Japan) when the study 
records are no longer needed.
If the investigator withdraws from the study (eg, relocation, r etirement), the records shall be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (eg, another inv estigator, study site, IRB). Notice 
of such transfer will be given in writing to BMS or designee.

DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW-UP AND REPORTING
Adverse Events
Adverse Event Definition:
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical oc currence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subje ct administered study drug and that 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the us e of study drug, whether or not 
consider ed related to the study drug.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
xAny abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chem istry, or urinalysis) or 
results from other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, consi dered clinically 
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the inves tigator. Note that 
abnormal lab tests or other safety assessments should only be reported as AEs if the 
final dia gnosis is not available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term 
should be updated to be the diagnosis.
xExacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre- existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
xNew conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention a dministration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.
xSigns, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction.
xSigns, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdo se of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose as a verbati m term (as reported by 
[CONTACT_093]), should not be reported as an AE/SAE unless i t is an intentional 
overdose taken with possible suicidal/self- harming intent. Such overdoses should be 
reported regardless of sequelae and should specify "intentional  overdose" as the 
verbatim term.
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
xMedical or surgical procedure ( eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): th e condi tion that leads 
to the procedure is the AE.
xSituations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occu r (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).

If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot b e an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met.
Serious Adverse Events
Serious Adverse Event Definition : Any untoward medical occurren ce that, at any dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer t o an event which hypothetically m ight have caused death if it were 
more severe)
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20345] (see note 
below)
Note: The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_82709]: 
xa visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24  hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event)
xelective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
xadmissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical proce dure
xroutine health assessment requiri ng admission for baseline/tren ding of health status 
(eg, routine colonoscopy)
xmedical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill healt h and planned prior to entry 
into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases.
xadmission encountered for another life circumstance that carrie s no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housi ng, economic 
inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administra tive reason)
xadmission for administration of ant icancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs 
(applies to oncology protocols)
Results in persistent or significant disability or permanent damage
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) th at may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based up on appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize  the subject or may require in tervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed i n the definition a bove). Examples 
of such events include, but are not  limited to, intensive treat ment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions  that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Potential drug -induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event (see Section 8.2.8 for the definition of potential DILI). 
Approved
2.[ADDRESS_90324] follow the same transmission timing and processes to BMS as 
used for SAEs (see Section 8.2.6 for reporting pregnancies).
Evaluating AEs and SAEs
Follow-up of AEs and SAEsAssessment of Intensity
The intensity of AEs is deter mined by a physician and will use the following levels:
xMild: An event that is easily tolerate d by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with everyday activities.
xModerate: An event that causes su fficient discomfort and interferes with normal 
everyday activities.
xSevere: An event that prevents nor mal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed 
as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a categ ory utilized for 
rating the intensity of an even; and both AEs and SAEs can be a ssessed as severe.
Assessment of Causality
xThe investigator is obligated to assess the relationship betwee n study intervention 
and each occurrence of each AE/SA E. A “reasonable possibility of a relationship” 
conveys that there are facts, evidences, and/or arguments to su ggest a causal 
relationship rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.  
xThe investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the re lationship.
xAlternative causes, such as unde rlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationshi p of the event to study intervention 
administration will be considered and investigated.
xThe investigator will also consult the Investigator Brochure (I B) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
xFor each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that 
he/she has reviewed the AE/SA E and has provided an assessment o f causality.
xThere may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to Sponsor. However, it is very 
important that the investigator alw ays make an assessment of ca usality for every 
event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to Sponso r.
xThe investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_35816]-up
information and send a SAE follow- up report with the updated ca usality 
assessment.
xThe causality assessment is one  of the criteria used when deter mining regulatory 
reporting requirements.

METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent  sterilization methods include hy sterectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bilateral oophorectomy.
Women in the following categor ies are not considered WOCBP
xPremenarchal
xPremenopausal female with 1 of the following:
Documented hysterectomy
Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]
Documented bilateral oophorectomy
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the subject’s medical records, 
medical examination, or medical history interview.
xPostmenopausal female
A postmenopausal state is defined as [ADDRESS_90326] a serum follicle-stimulating horm o n e  ( F S H )  l e v e l  >  
40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Note: Females treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are  likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order  to obtain a physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the inves tigators should use their judgment 
in checking serum FSH levels. 
x1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, ge ls)
x4 week minimum for transdermal products
x8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long a s 6 months. If the serum FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered 
postmenopausal.

DEFINITIONS
Suicidal Ideation
Passive suicidal ideation: wish to be dead
Patient has thoughts about a wish to be dead or not alive anymo re, or wish to fall asleep 
and not wake up.Active suicidal ideation: nonsp ecific (no method, intent, or plan)
General nonspecific thoughts of wanting to end one’s life or co mmit suicide (eg, “I’ve 
thought about killing myself”) without general thoughts of ways  to kill oneself/associated 
methods, intent, or plan during the assessment period.Active suicidal ideation: met hod, but no intent or plan
Patient has thoughts of suicide and has thought of at least one method during the assessment 
period. This situation is different than a specific plan with time, place, or method details 
worked out (eg, thought of method to kill self but not a specific plan). Includes person who 
would say, “I tho ught about taking an overdose but I never made a specific plan as to when, 
where, or how I would actually do it . . . and I would never go  through with it.”
Active suicidal ideation: met hod and intent, but no plan
Active suicidal thoughts of killing oneself, and patient report s having some intent to act on 
such thoughts, as opposed to “I have the thoughts but I definit ely will not do anything about 
them.”
Active suicidal ideation:  method, intent, and plan
Thoughts of killing oneself with details of plan fully or parti ally worked out and patient 
has some intent to carry it out (ie, some degree of intent is i mplicit in the concept of plan).

intent to die as a result of the act. Evidence that the individual intended to kill him- or 
herself, at least to some degree, can be explicit or inferred f rom the behavior or 
circumstance.
Suicide attempt
A potentially self-injurious behavior, associated with at least  some intent to die as a result 
of the act. Evidence that the individual intended to kill him- o r herself, at least to some 
degree, can be explicit or inferred from the behavior or circum stance. A suicide attempt

21 May 2020, Revised Protocol 09 , Final Approved BMS Confidentia l 137Interrupted suicide attempt
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_24662]) fro m starting a potentially 
self-injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have occurred).
Aborted suicide attempt
When person begins to take steps toward making a suicide attemp t, but stops before 
actually engaging in any self-destructive behavior. Examples ar e similar to interrupted 
attempts, except that the individual stops before being stopped  by [CONTACT_6615].
Preparatory acts toward immi nent suicidal behaviors
This category can include anything beyond a verbalization or th ought, but it stops short of 
a suicide attempt, an interrupted suicide attempt, or an aborte d suicide attempt. This might 
include behaviors related to assembling a specific method (eg, buying pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], purchasing a 
gun) or preparing for one’s death by [CONTACT_20673] (eg, giving things away, writing a suicide 
note).
Self-Injurious Behavior Without Suicidal Intent
Self-injurious behavior associated with no intent to die. The b ehavior is intended purely for other 
reasons, either to relieve distress (often referred to as self-mutilation (eg, superficial cuts or 
scratches, hitting or banging, or burns)) or to effect change i n others or the environment.

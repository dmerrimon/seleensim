1.1. Background  
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and when left untreated, is a 
leading cause of morbidity and mortality from stroke, heart failure and myocardial infarction 
(Ben Freedman, 2015; Moran, 2016). Data from the Framingham Heart Study indicates that by 
[CONTACT_654] 40 years, lifetime risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_115473] 1 in 4 (Lloyd-Jones, 2004). AF is also a growing public health problem with prevalence projected to triple between 2010 and 2050, with an 
estimated 12.1 million diagnosed cases in 2030 in th e [LOCATION_002] (US) alone (Colilla, 2013). 
Early detection and treatment of patients with AF minimizes the risk of sequelae of 
thromboembolism including >60% reduced risk of stroke (Moran, 2016; Omboni, 2016). 
However, many affected with AF are unaware they have this dysrhythmia due to a number of 
factors including lack of symptoms, or experience only mild symptoms that they do not attribute to a disease (Moran, 2016). As a result, asymptomatic patients are [ADDRESS_128927] 
sustained an ischemic stroke prior to diagnosis than those with symptoms ( Ben Freedman, 2015; 
O'Neal , 2016). These findings raise concerns and have prompted several variations of screening 
programs to detect patients with asymptomatic AF to prevent an embolic event (Ben Freedman, 
2015; Moran, 2016). While systematic and opportunistic screening programs have demonstrated 
increased rates of detection when compared to detection during routine clinical practice, such screening programs are not yet widely implemented (Moran, 2016). Additionally, AF may be 
paroxysmal (PAF or intermittent AF) and therefore missed by [CONTACT_44745] a single in -clinic 
electrocardiogram (ECG). This is especially true for those patients with intermittent symptoms. 
Holter devices are commonly used for ambulatory [ADDRESS_128928] limited sensitivity for the detection of new AF ( Brachmann, 2016).  
Once diagnosed with AF, the condition of AF can affect individual patients with different degrees of burden. AF burden itself can be defined as the percentage time a person is in AF 
during a specified time period. AF burden has been traditionally estimated through monitoring 
devices such as Holter devices, implantable loop recorders, or implantable pacemakers and 
defibrillators. AF burden, moreover, is a strong area of focus in medical research on its impact 
on outcomes and management. One recent study ( Go, 2018) identified 3-fold higher risk of 
stroke in patients with the highest burden compared to those with low burden. For non -stroke 
outcomes, AF burden has been a focus of research interest as a potential predictor of other events 
such as heart failure, mortality, and other car diac-related outcomes (Chen, 2018). 
Although established guidelines do not currently utilize AF burden alone to drive clinical decision making, for many patients, AF burden can have a negative impact on daily life due to 
symptoms and impact on their cardiovascular health. Indeed, quality of life is of great 
importance in patients with AF and often a primary goal in optimization of their health after 
prioritizing stroke prevention. Patients can have a wide range of symptoms while in AF, from 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], tiredness, low energy, and other manifestations to complete absence of symptoms. 
For those patients with symptoms, the degree of AF burden can be correlated with th eir quantity 
of symptoms, and therefore have great impact on their quality of life. A number of clinical interventions are utilized to manage AF and its symptoms, including rate control medications, 
antiarrhythmics, and nonpharmacologic strategies such as catheter ablation.  Outside of clinical 

  
   09 April 2021 
Confidential   Page 15 interventions, recent data suggests that patients can pursue lifestyle modifications such as weight 
loss, exercise, improved sleep, and stress management to manage AF burden; as an example , 
recent guidelines by [CONTACT_34129]/ACC/HRS now recommend, as a Class I indication, lifestyle interventions for overweight persons with AF (January, 2019).  
Recent guidelines and professional society consensus documents highlight the importance of 
enhancing patient knowledge of AF (January, 2019; Lane, 2015). Given that mobile devices 
permit ways to frequently monitor patients in an outpatient setting, our hypothesis is that use of 
the test device can facilitate both the identification of AF in the undiagnosed users as well as provide valuable information regar ding AF burden estimates for users with known diagnosis of 
AF. 
1.2. Device Description  
The Investigational Irregular Rhythm Notification Feature (IRNF) 2.0 and Atrial Fibrillation 
Burden Feature (AFBF) 1.0 algorithms are software-based medical devices.  
The IRNF 2.0 algorithm analyzes background data opportunistically collected by [CONTACT_115488] a compatible Apple Watch (wrist device) to identify and notify users of 
irregular rhythm suggestive with AF.   The AFBF 1.0 algorithm also analyzes background data opportunistically collected by [CONTACT_115489] a compatible Apple Watch (wrist device) and estimates the 
proportion of time a user is in an AF rhythm as compared to other rhythms; these results can be 
displayed and accessed by [CONTACT_115490] a compatible iPho ne. 
1.3. Study Rationale  
This clinical study is being conducted to evaluate the performances of investigational Irregular 
Rhythm Notification Feature (IRNF) 2.0 and Atrial Fibrillation Feature Burden (AFBF) 1.0 
algorithms (test devices). 
1.4. Risk/Benefit Assessment  
There may be risks or discomforts associated with participating in this study. No significant risks 
or permanent side effects are anticipated. Precautions will be taken to minimize risks; however, 
there may be risks that are not yet known about. Subjects will be encouraged to talk to study staff 
if they experience any injuries, side effects, or discomfort while or as a result of participating in 
this study.  
• Subjects may experience slight to moderate discomfort associated with attachment 
and removal of adhesive electrodes used for ECG  patches. The risk will be minimized 
by [CONTACT_115491]-grade disposable electrodes and by [CONTACT_115492]. Even with these precautions, temporary skin 
irritation may still occur.  
• Subjects may experience rash from the ambulatory ECG monitor or from the wrist 
device band. 
• Subjects may experience slight to moderate discomfort associated with wearing the 
wrist device, such as pressure related muscle tenderness .

 Data  from subjects in Cohorts 1, 3, and [ADDRESS_128930] this 
hypothesis.
 
The secondary endpoint hypothesis associated with the IRNF compares the tachogram -level false 
positive rate (FPR) of the test device to that of the predicate device to determine if the test device 
algorithm FPR is non-inferior ) to that of the predicate device using all tachograms generated only from subjects in Cohort 2 (Aggressor Rhythm Cohort).  
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
AFB F: 
The primary endpoint hypothesis associated with the AFB F is: 
 
 
 
 
 
The secondary endpoint hypotheses associated with the day -specific and four-hour segment-
specific endpoints are listed below, respectively:   
 
  

  
   [ADDRESS_128931] (IRB) prior to recruitment or enrollment of study 
subjects.  
Written, informed consent will be obtained from all subjects before any protocol-directed 
procedures are performed. All potential subjects will participate in a screening visit, and if 
eligibility is confirmed, subjects may begin study participation.  
Subjects will be given two separate wrist devices for use in the study – one wrist device will be 
worn during waking hours, the other wrist device will be worn overnight such that the subject is 
not wearing multiple wrist devices at one time. Subjects will wear a wrist device simultaneously 
with a single-lead ambulatory ECG patch for up to 13 days (± 2 days), or until the end of the 2nd 
ECG patch wear period, if less than 13 ± [ADDRESS_128932] ECG patch will be replaced after  5 days (+2 
days). The wrist device will collect accelerometer data continuously   and photoplethysmography 
(PPG) data when the user is still during their daily life use. The study duration will be for up to 13 days (± 2 days). The ECG patch will be returned and assessed for presentation of AF and 
other arrhythmias. 
The study will target enrollment of subjects with varying diagnoses of AF, normal sinus rhythm, 
and other rhythms with a goal to generate a dataset with AF burdens that span from 0% to 100%. 
Target recruitment bins of AF burden for subjects in Cohorts 3 and 4 will be monitored during 
the study using only data collected from the ambulatory ECG patch  to ensure minimum data 
collection in each; study enrollment of Cohort 3 and 4 subjects will continue until minimum 
enrollment targets of low AF burden and high AF burden are achieved (as defined in Section 4.2). Because of anticipated discrepancies between self -reported type of AF and the 
amount of AF burden measured via ECG patch, for purposes of analysis, the final Cohort 
assignment will be determined based on the AF burden measured via ECG patch.   
The investigational Irregular Rhythm Notification Feature (IRNF) 2.0 and Atrial Fibrillation Burden Feature (AFBF) 1.0 algorithms (test device) will be run post-hoc on the sensor dataset to 
generate tachograms and notifications. The performance of each test device will be determined 
based upon adjudication of concurrent data from the reference device.  
A sub-study cohort of approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled prior to the start of the clinical 
validation (i.e., pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735]) study. These subjects will follow the same study procedures outlined in 
this protocol.  However, no data from this cohort will contribute towards the  performance 
evaluation of the test device algorithms .  This sub-study is primarily intended to provide 
assurance that all of the data collection, evaluation, and data transfer tools are performing as 
intended prior to the start of the clinical validation study.  Subject accountability, demographic, 
and safety data will be summarized and reported for this cohort.

4.2. Study Cohorts and T arget Population  
The study will include 4 cohorts of subjects:  
• Cohort 1 will include subjects with no known history of AF* 
• Cohort 2 (Aggressor Rhythm Cohort) will include subjects with no known history of 
AF*, but with history of frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs), frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), or non -
sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT)  
• Cohort 3 (non-permanent AF) will include subjects with known history of paroxysmal, 
persistent, or chronic AF* 
• Cohort 4 (permanent AF) will include subjects with permanent AF. 
* History of AF encompasses the 2 years prior to participation in study screening procedures . 
For all cohorts, the following age, gender, and race/ethnicity enrollment targets will be adhered 
to during subject recruitment: 
• A minimum of 10% of subjects will be enrolled the age category of <55 and a minimum of 20% in of the age categories of 55 to 64, and ≥65 years.  
• At least 40% of subjects in Cohort [ADDRESS_128937] 40% male. At least 20% of subjects in each of Cohorts [ADDRESS_128938] 20% will be male. 
• At least 10% of subjects in Cohort [ADDRESS_128939] 10% of subjects will be non-Caucasian.  
The incidence of AF is known to increase with age, male gender, and White race  (Benjamin, 
2019). These recruitment targets are also consistent with the subject population observed in the 
Apple Heart Study, which is representative of the intended use population (Turakhia, 2019).  
Table 1 identifies the estimated number of subjects targeted for enrollment. A minimum of 
subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 2.

Abbreviations: NSR = normal sinus rhythm  
While subjects will be recruited based upon known inclusion/exclusion criteria including history 
of arrhythmia, there is uncertainty on whether the presentation of that rhythm will present and occur during study based on the natural temporal variability of  heart rhythms.  Thus, study 
enrollment will continue until minimum targets based on rhythm presentation during study is 
achieved across all cohorts; enrollment may cease after minimum targets are achieved.   
Enrollment for Cohort [ADDRESS_128940] in the self-reported 
enrollment Cohorts 3 and 4 will be determined from the ambulatory ECG Patch reference device 
after subjects complete and/or terminate from the study. A final AF cohort assignment will be determined based on this adjudicated AF burden measurement. Enrollment for Cohort 4 will 
continue until minimum numbers with ≥95% AF burden as determined by [CONTACT_115497].

prior to this visit.  
Skin tone assessment on the Fitzpatrick scale will be confirmed at this visit.  
5.2.1. Data Collection Study Equipment Set up 
The following procedures will be performed for each study subject at study participation:  
Two wrist devices of the same series/configuration will be assigned to each subject for the study . 
The first wrist device will  be worn during the day for daytime data collection. The second wrist 
device will be worn during the night for nighttime data collection during sleep. The wrist devices 
are to be charged while not being worn.  

  
   [ADDRESS_128951] to choose his/her preferr ed wrist to wear the wrist device. The wrist 
device can be worn on whichever side the subject prefers unless there is a skin condition 
on one wrist as noted above in the exclusion criteria, in which case, the wrist device must 
be worn on the non-affected wrist. Record the chosen wrist. If the subject does not have a 
side preference or skin condition on one wrist, the wrist device will be placed on the left 
wrist. 
2. The subject will be asked to put the wrist device on his/her wrist (as indicated in 1). The wrist device should be fitted tightly enough that it does not move when the hand/wrist is 
shaken.  
3. Ask user to adjust band tightness for a snug fit and adjust as needed. 
An ECG patch will be self -applied to the upper torso of the s ubject on Day 1 and Day 5 (+2 
days) of the study. Self -application of ECG patch may be performed with aid of instructions via 
televideo. If the visit is occurring on site, the study staff may assist with the patch placement.

activities for up to 13 (± 2) days.  This includes pressing a button on the patch to confirm that the 
patch is still working properly.  Follow up calls or telehealth video calls may be made to the subject as needed throughout the home use period. Subjects will be advised to not swim or do 
activities that will cause excessive sweating.  
5.4. Study Day [ADDRESS_128953] ambulatory ECG patch on study Day 5 (+2 days). A 2nd ECG patch 
will be self -applied to the subject. If the visit is occurring on site, the study staff may assist with 
the patch placement. The 1st patch will be returned to study staff.  This visit will be conducted 
remotely; in person on-site visits can occur only after Sponsor approval. 
5.5. End of Study Visit  
Thirteen days (±2 days) after the initial study visit, or after the conclusion of the 2nd ECG patch 
wear period, if less than 13 ± [ADDRESS_128954]’s participation in the study will

ECG Strip Diagnosis (Secondary Endpoint) 
ECG strips will be identified from the ECG patch for the period of time corresponding to each 
tachogram that was selected for analysis .  
Strips will be reviewed by [ADDRESS_128956] adjudicators for a strip diagnosis ( Section [IP_ADDRESS].1). If there are any 
differences in adjudication decisions, the strip in question will be sent to a third adjudicator for 
final decision. Adjudicators will be instructed to review ECG s independently and separately of 
each other and not to confer about diagnoses. All adjudicators will be blinded to cohort and 
AFBF information.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Rhythm Diagnoses 
The diagnosis of the rhythm will  fall into one of five categories : 
1. Sinus Rhythm  
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF) 
3. Atrial Flutter (AFL) 
4. Other irregular rhythms (examples include sinus rhythm with frequent PACs, sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs, SVT, VT/VF) 
5. Unreadable as defined that a diagnosis cannot be made as the strip is not adequate for 
reading 
The diagnosis will be made via the following logic flow (in sequential order):  
1. If the ECG strip contains at least 10 seconds of continuous atrial fibrillation, then it will be 
classified as “Atrial fibrillation.”  Any atrial fibrillation with PACs or PVCs will be classified 
as “Atrial fibrillation”, with the note of PACs or PVCs be added to the comments section.  
2. Otherwise, if 6 or more of the sub-strips cannot be interpreted (e.g. due to noise or artifacts), then the strip will be classified as “Unreadable.”  
3. Otherwise, if the ECG strip contains a non-AF arrhythmia, then it will be classified as “Other 
arrhythmia”. This includes:  
• Supraventricular Tachycardia (includes atrial tachycardia, AVNRT, AVRT)  
• Sinus rhythm with PACs 
• Sinus rhythm with PVCs 
• Sinus rhythm with junctional beats  
• Sinus arrhythmia  
• Ventricular tachycardia (sustained or nonsustained)  
• Heart Block (includes 2nd or 3rd degree HB) 
4. Otherwise, the ECG will be classified as “Sinus rhythm” 
 

  
   [ADDRESS_128957]. The subjects’ sensor datasets will be used as the 
common source of data for this study to which the algorithms will be applied in a post-hoc 
fashion. 
For evaluation of the IRNF, the algorithm software will collect accelerometer data continuously 
and PPG data when the user is still, which is when it would be possible for a tachogram for either 
the predicate or test algorithms to be collected. The platform and device algorithms for the test 
and predicate devices will be run on the sensor dataset to generate tachograms and notifications. 
The performance of the test device will be compared to the performance of the predicate device according to the pre-specified analyses as outlined below . 
For the AFBF, the platform algorithm will be applied to reflect the tachogram sampling strategy that will be implemented in the final, finished product. The algorithm parameters associated with 
minimum requirements to produce the 7 -day AF burden measurement will be finalized prior to 
database lock. The AFBF algorithm will be run on the subjects’ sensor datasets to estimate the 7-
day average AF burden and identify AF epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. Additionally, the algorithm will be applied to 
the set of tachograms generated via the IRNF 2.[ADDRESS_128958] Certified Cardiologists. The AFBF analyses will be 
performed on all subjects in Cohorts 3 and 4. 
6.2. Statistical Methodology   
For all of the IRNF statistical analyses, atrial fibrill ation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) will be 
treated as a single category of “AF”.  For all of the AFBF statistical analyses, atrial fibrillation 
(AF) will be considered its own unique category (i.e., atrial flutter will not be included as part of 
the detection of AF epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]).  
6.2.1. Randomization Methodology 
A summary of the randomization methodology applied in this study is outlined below.  
Additional details may be found in the study Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
Wrist Device Assignments 
Subjects will be randomly assigned to wear two wrist devices  
 from the same series/configuration. A pre-determined block randomization schedule will 
be generated for each enrollment cohort and subjects will be assigned sequentially to either a

The primary endpoint hypothesis associated with the AFBF algorithm is: 
    
    
 
 
a  
 

  
   [ADDRESS_128965] 10 seconds per the ECG strip diagnosis definition pres ented in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Notification-Level PPV = (# of notifications with  an adjudicated ECG strip diagnosis of AF of at 
least 10 seconds for any tachogram comprising the notification) / (# of alert notifications)  
For subjects who exhibit a high level (≥ 95%) AF burden, it is expected that a large (100 to 200) number of notifications will be generated in total for both the IRN 1.0 and 2.0 algorithms  
resulting in >1,[ADDRESS_128966] and predicate de vice algorithms and 
because multiple notifications may be associated with some subjects, a bootstrap approach will 
be implemented to obtain 95% two-sided confidence intervals separately for each algorithm’s 
notification-level PPV. The bootstrap sampling will randomly select subjects who have 
analyzable data with replacement rather than individual data points to account for any correlation structure that might exist within subjects so that confidence limits are corrected for within -
subject correlation. 
Two tachogram-level analysis results  
associated with the secondary endpoints 

  
   [ADDRESS_128967] and predicate devices will b e presented as outlined in Table 7 
below.

Tachogram performance for the test and predicate devices will be estimated separately as 
outlined below because the set of tachograms will differ by [INVESTIGATOR_16897]. Two -sided 95% bootstrap 
confidence intervals will be constructed for each performance metric by [CONTACT_115505].  
Tachogram Sensitivity = (n12+n13)/(nAF+nAFL) 
Tachogram Specificity = n21/nS R 
Tachogram False Positive Rate = (n11+n14)/(nSR+nOA) 
Tachogram PPV = (n12+n13)/(nTI-n15) 
Tachogram NPV = n21/(nTN-n25) 
The ECG strips corresponding to all tachograms which comprise each notification for subjects in 
Cohorts 1, [ADDRESS_128968] classifications from ECG strips where the SR and Other 
Abnormal Rhythm adjudications are combined into a single category.  
 
Using the notation of Table 7, tachogram performance will be estimated as outlined below  from 
the randomly selected tachograms for all subjects in Cohorts 3 and  4. Two-sided 95% bootstrap 
confidence intervals will be constructed for each performance metric to account for potential 
within subject correlation of the multiple tachograms associated with each subject.  
• Tachogram Sensitivity = n12/nAF  
• Tachogram Specificity = (n21+n23+n24)/(nSR+nAFL+nOA)  
• Tachogram PPV = n12/(nTI-n15) 
• Tachogram NPV = (n21+n23+n24)/(nTN-n25)  
Although the set of tachograms for the AFBF device algorithm will differ from the set of 
tachograms generated from the test IRNF device algorithm,  
 
The same tachogram performance analysis of 
the AFBF device algorithm will be performed as specified above.  
The analysis of the day-specific AF burden estimate  will be performed to demonstrate that the 
algorithm provides accurate estimates of AF burden regardless of the set of days included in the 
analysis using a Monte Carlo simulation based approach.  In this approach and at each iteration 
of the simulation, days will be selected at random (and without replacement) for each  subject 
from the set of days where reference and test device data is available.  An AFB measurement 
will be determined from the test device across the selected days as will the reference AFB 
measurement for each subject.

6.2.4. Safety Analyses 
All adverse events (AEs) will be recorded throughout the entire study period, whether they are 
considered to be related to the study procedures o r not. Signs and symptoms of each AE will be 
described in detail: date of event, description of event, severity, relationship to study procedures, 
action taken and outcome. AEs will be collected as spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_748].  
AEs will be coded using MedDRA (latest version). The number of any AEs and the number and 
percentage of subjects reporting each type of adverse event will be presented by [CONTACT_9560]. 
Multiple occurrences of the same event reported by [CONTACT_115506] y once.   
AE summaries (number of events and incidence) will be presented for  all AEs, including the 
following: 
• Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
• Study procedure related AEs 
• Severe AEs, which are AEs that are rated as Severe in intensity    
Study procedure related AEs will include those events classified as possibly or definitely related 
to the study procedure.  
6.2.5. Additional Analyses  
Subject accountability, device accountability, medical history, medication, demographic and 
baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_115507]. The final 
cohort assignments for subjects who self-report at the time of screening in Cohorts 1, 3, and 4 
will be determined based on their final adjudicated reference ECG results of AF burden as follows: 
• Cohort 1: Adjudicated AF Burden via reference ECG of 0% 
• Cohort 3: Adjudicated AF Burden via reference ECG of >0% to < 95% 
• Cohort 4: Adjudicated AF Burden via reference ECG of > 95% 
The final cohort assignment of subjects who self-report at the time of screening in Cohort [ADDRESS_128969] closely align the 
reporting of results based on the presentation or absence of AF during the study monitoring period regardless of prior diagnosis.

measurements. Boxplots of the weekly AFBF device measurements for ECG Patch categories of 
0%, >0% to 33%, >33% to < 95%, ≥95% will also be displayed. 
The paired differences in the weekly AFB average measurements between the AFBF device and 
ambulatory ECG patch and corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals  for the average 
paired difference will be presented for each of the following ranges of ambulatory ECG patch 
AFB categories:  
• 0% 
• >0% to 33%  
• >33% to < 95%  
• ≥95%  
The false negative rate will be estimated as the number of subjects with a weekly AFBF device 
measurements = 0% and a paired ECG patch AFB measurement > 0% divided by [CONTACT_115510] a paired ECG patch AFB measurement > 0%.  A two-sided 95% exact binomial 
confidence interval for the false negative rate will also be reported.     
A modified Bland-Altman analysis will be performed using only reference AF burden 
measurements which are strictly between 0% and 100%. In the analysis, the x -axis will be the 
reference burden and the y-axis will be the paired differences between the test device and 
reference method.  Estimated limits of agreement and mean bias with associated 95% confidence interval) will be reported.  No hypotheses will be tested in this analysis. 
Medications (verbatim terms) will also be tabulated and reported.  
6.3. Sample Size Determination  
IRNF 
The approach for sample size determination associated with the IRNF primary endpoint follows 
that of Zhou et al for the comparison of sensitivity and  specificity of paired subject-level data 
arising from the test and predicate IRNF devices (Zhou 2002). Performance estimates used for 
the sample size calculations are based on internal engineering data.

Additionally, to assess the secondary endpoint hypothesis H 02 of the study, an aggressor cohort 
of subjects with no known history of AF but with a known history of other arrhythmias which 
may resemble the irregularity of AF (i.e., frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs), frequent 
premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), or non -sustained 
ventricular tachycardia (NSVT)) will be enrolled.

The approach for sample size determination follows the approach of Lu et al ( Lu, 2016). The power 
associated with the primary endpoint hypothesis can be estimated as  
 
where F(x) is the cumulative density function of the standard normal dist ribution, () is the 
expected average difference in AF burden measurements between the device and reference 
method, d is the maximum allowable difference, za/2 is the cumulative 100(α/2)% percentile of 
the standard normal distribution, and se LOA is the standard error of the lower or upper Limit of 
Agreement defined as se LOA = S D*sqrt[1/n + (1.96^2)/(2*(n-1)] where S D is the standard 
deviation of the paired AFB differences. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
To summarize, a total  subjects will be enrolled into the study according to the 
cohorts below: 
• n  (Cohort 1: No Known Diagnosis of AF) 
• n  (Cohort 2: Aggressor Rhythm Cohort) 
• n  (Cohort 3: Non-Permanent AF) 
• n  (Cohort 4: Permanent AF) 
   
6.4. Significance Level   
The primary non-inferiority hypotheses test of sensitivity and specificity and the secondary 
endpoint non-inferiority comparison of false positive rates for the IRNF will use a one-sided 

  
   [ADDRESS_128971] of superiority will be 
performed using the same significance level.   
All AFBF analyses will use a two-sided significance level of 0.05.   
6.5. Missing Data  
Rigorous efforts will be made to ensure all subjects are compliant with the protocol. However, 
some subjects may drop out prematurely or some planned measurements may not be readable or 
interpretable. The data analyses will be conducted on all readable and inte rpretable data.  
Additional details defining readable and interpretable data may be found in the study Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
6.6. Subgroup Analyses  
In accordance with the FDA Guidance on the reporting of age -, race-, and ethnicity-specific data, 
the primary endpoints for both IRNF and AFBF devices will be reported by [CONTACT_2225] (data permitting). Some subgroups may be combined depending on data availability.  
• Age group (<55; ≥55 to <65; ≥65 years) 
• Sex (Male; Female) 
• Race (White; Black or A frican American; Asian; American Indian or Alaska Native; 
Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander)

Term Definition Reference 
Adverse 
Event (AE) Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended 
disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs 
(including abnormal laboratory findings) in 
subject s, users or other persons, whether or not 
related to the study procedures. ISO [ZIP_CODE]: 
2011 
Serious 
Adverse 
Event (SAE) Adverse event that 
1. Led to death, 
2. Led to serious deterioration in the health of the 
subject , that either resulted in: 
a. A life-threatening illness or injury, or 
b. A permanent impairment of a body 
structure or a body function, or 
c. In-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or

The Severity  of an AE will be categorized  as follows:  
Mild  Mild  events are those that are tolerated with  no disruption of 
normal daily activity 
Moderate Moderate events are those that cause sufficient discomfort to 
interfere  with daily  activity  
Severe Severe events are those that incapacitate and prevent usual 
activity x 
7.1.1. AE/SAE Collection  
Any abnormal laboratory findings, abnormal safety assessments, or anticipated day -to-day 
fluctuations which are associated with a pre-existing disease or condition, are not considered an 
adverse event unless judged by [CONTACT_115511]. 
All adverse events must be fully recorded throughout the entire study period, whether they are 
considered to be related to the study procedures or not. Adverse events will be collected as 
spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_748].  

  
   09 April 2021 
Confidential   Page 47 Adverse events should be followed until they are resolved or stabilized (returns to baseline for a 
pre-existing condition) and followed by a private MD , or the subject is lost to follow-up. In the 
event of a subject not returning to the clinical unit, the ou tcome of this event will be recorded as 
lost at follow up. 
Possible AEs include the following: 
● Skin rash on wrist due to wearing the wrist device;  
● Pressure artifacts on wrist due to wearing the wrist-sensor device; 
The following occurrences are not to be regarded as AEs: 
● Underlying (pre-existing) symptoms or diseases, unless there is an increase in severity 
or frequency during the course of the investigation; 
● Detection of atrial fibrillation or other irregular heartbeat ; 
● Complaint about wrist device functionality. 
7.1.2. SAE Reporting  
The site investigator should report all SAEs to the Sponsor as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. The site investigator should also report the SAEs to 
their IRB as soon as possible and according to their IRB reporting requirements, but in no event 
later than 10 working days after the investigator becomes aware of the event. On the date the Site 
staff became aware that the event met the SAE definition set out in this protocol, the investigator 
will be requested to complete an AE/ SAE reporting form in the database, in addition to the 
information on the source documentation.  The investigator will conduct further investigation of 
these events regarding determination of event as a serious adverse event and determination of relatedness of the event to the study. The investigation of these events will be completed and

1.0  Purpose of the Study ..................................................................................................... ..................... 3 
2.0  Background / Literature Review / Rationale for the study ................................................................ [ADDRESS_375441] Center  of Northwestern Medicine/ Prentice Women’ s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Now, we seek to evaluate 
performance of skin self-examination (SSE) by [CONTACT_31267], who receive information during their 
mammogram appointment, and follow-up with dermatol ogy for a melanoma screening examination.   
 
In the second phase, a more intensive intervention in which women will not only receive information 
about SSE, but will also receive a reminder to pe rform SSE one week after the screening mammogram 
and information on how to schedule an appointment with dermatology will be provided. The number of 
women who perform SSE at home and find a concerning mole (lesion), number who see a 
dermatologist, and number who have a concerning lesi on biopsied will be compared in two arms of the 
study 1) women who receive the intensive interv ention 2) women who receive the informational 
brochure about SSE alone.    
 
Our hypothesis is that women who receive more th e intensive educational intervention will be more 
likely to perform SSE at home and schedule a follo w-up dermatologist appointment as compared to 
those who receive the information brochure alone. This project builds upon Robinson’s successful SSE 
training program for melanoma patients that resulted in  patients’ accurate evaluations of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_306636]’ skin examinations.4  
 
The study aims are as follows : 
1. Assess whether SSE education introduced during routine screening mammography encourages 
women to implement SSE at home, find concerning lesions, and seek follow-up with a dermatologist. 
2. Assess the effectiveness of additional reminders to perform SSE and providing information on how 
to schedule follow-up with a dermatologist on partic ipant performance of SSE with identification of a 
concerning lesion or scheduling a screening examination with a dermatologist without performing 
SSE.   
2.0 Background / Literature Revi ew / Rationale for the study 
1. Significance 
Invasive melanoma, a lethal form of skin cancer, is the seventh most common cancer in women. The 
vast majority of melanomas are curable if the cancer is caught early, yet over 10,[ADDRESS_375442] died of melanoma in 2017.1 New opportunities to decrease mortality 
from this deadly cancer, which is visibl e on the skin surface, are warranted.  
Melanoma incidence increased 3% per year for the l ast two decades in part due to indoor tanning by 
[CONTACT_306641]. In 1994, [CONTACT_306653] on’s group found that 24% of teen women in Illinois tanned 
indoors.2 Since 1994, indoor tanning has increased from 24% to 40% among women between the ages 
of [ADDRESS_375443] 
cognitive impairment causing problems with functioning at a sixth grade reading level or 
inability to speak. 
3.3 Special populations  
Special populations will not be invited to participate in this research.  
3.0 Procedures Involved  
3.1 Study Design 
 Phase 1: Delivery of educational SSE program .  
Each of the eight changing room s of the Lynn Sage Comprehens ive Breast of Northwestern 
Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_306637] a pos ter, brochures (Fig 1 and Fig 2) and cards 
with information about obtaining an appointment with a dermat ologist for concerning skin 
lesions.   A woman research assistant will obtain consent to participate in  the research and review of 
medical information, collect contact [CONTACT_306642] X, 8+ or 
8, and ensure receipt of an informational brochure. Women will be asked if they own an 
iPhone X, 8+ or [ADDRESS_375444] with information on scheduling 
dermatology follow-up prior to check-out (Group 1), (Fig 3). During weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8 of 
the study period, 400 women will be given brochu res to perform SSE at home and proceed 
to check-out of the mammogram area (Group 2). The women in Group [ADDRESS_375445] of SSE education delivered during the mammography experience.

 email or text message. One month after the mammogram visit both groups will be called and 
surveyed to see if they checked their sk in and/or made an appointment to see a 
dermatologist. Three months after the mammogr am, both groups will be asked to participate 
in a complete survey (either via REDCap or telephone), including whether the women followed up in dermatology and if any concerning lesions were biopsied. 
 
 
Phase 2:  Assessment of SEE Implementation  
A research assistant will be presen t at the mammography center to collect consent, telephone 
numbers, iPhone model information, and email addresses to have women sign onto REDCap to 
complete a survey.  A telephone survey will be administered to each woman enrolled in the study in 
both groups (N=800) one month after the mammogram asking if she performed a SSE at home and 
whether a follow-up with dermatology was made. An anonymous REDCap survey may be used 
in place of the telephone call, depending on participant’s preferred method of contact 
[CONTACT_245233]. Then, three months after the screening ma mmogram, an anonymous <2 minute REDCap 
survey will be sent via email to  each woman enrolled in both grou ps to ascertain the number of 
women who identified that they were at increased risk for melanoma (history of sunburn, history of 
indoor tanning >10+sessions, family or personal hi story of skin cancer), performed a SSE at home, 
found a concerning lesion, made a follow-up appointment with a dermatologist, and had any 
concerning lesions biopsied. If participants do not co mplete the REDCap survey in 2 weeks, they will 
be called and surveyed via telephone. We anticipate a 20% attrition rate (Fig 3). Participants will be 
offered a $[ADDRESS_375446] in appreciation of co mpleting the one month survey and an additional 
$[ADDRESS_375447] of SSE education delivered during the mammography experience.

EMR review If a woman responds yes to item [ADDRESS_375451]. 
The pathology report of biopsied mole(s) will be reviewed and added to the deidentified 
database.  
 
3.4 Measures  
The number of women with ri sk factors for melanoma, who performed SSE after the 
screening mammogram, who found a con cerning mole, who saw dermatology, who 
had a concerning lesion biopsied in each  group will be analyzed by [CONTACT_84814]. The difference in  proportions of women who 1) performed SSE 2) saw a 
dermatologist in the educational intervention group from the intensive intervention group will be compared using a 
[ADDRESS_375452]. If the woman res ponded “yes” to follow-up 
in dermatology, a chart review of the elec tronic medical record will be performed to 
assess whether any lesions were biopsied and pathology of the concerning lesions.  
The accuracy of the woman’s selection of  a concerning lesion will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_306644]’s assessment during SSE and 
the dermatologist. The overall correspondence rate will be calculated with a random 
intercept-only mixed logistic regression m odel. The statistical analysis will be 
performed by [CONTACT_306645], MD, MPH.

6.0 Incomplete Disclosure or Deception  
6.1 N/A. This research will not use incomplete disclosure or deception.  
 
5.0  Recruitment 
7.1 Recruitment of Patients 
A woman research assistant will perform in-person interviews with participants to ascertain 
if women is eligible for the study and intere sted to participant. Women who sign written 
consent and fill out a registration form will be entered into the study. (n=800) (see attached 
forms)  
 
8.0 Consent Process 
8.1 Written consent will be obtained at the following location:  Lynn Sage Breast Center of 
Prentice Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/Northwestern Medici ne. (see attached consent document)  
8.2. N/A. Non-English speaking participants will not be enrolled in this research.  
8.3. Participants who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers) will not be enrolled in this 
research. Participants in structured interviews , who are the age of 18 years or older, will be 
enrolled in this research. Assent will be required from all participants. The RA will obtain verbal 
assent from each participant and will be documented. The RA will read the assent script to the 
participant and will then document the participant’s response. 
8.4 Cognitively Impaired Adults: Participants w ill be screened for preexisting conditions that 
would prohibit their participation due to being over burdened by [CONTACT_3252]-morbid diseases, unable 
to participate in a conversation at a sixth grade language level due to cognitive impairment (e.g., by a stroke), and unable to speak and read English, inability to see to read a newspaper.  
Subjects having conditions that contraindicate participation will not be enrolled in this research. 
8.5. Adults Unable to Consent: Please see above rationale for excluding Cognitively Impaired 
Adults.

will consult with the patient’s own dermatologist and an appropriate referral will be made.                           
Because of the potential for the educationa l intervention to help the subject identify 
melanoma at a stage of development with th e best prognosis, we f eel that the potential 
benefits, in reduced morbidity and mortality, to the subject outweigh the risk of potential 
enhanced anxiety in discoveri ng a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_240892]. Should su bjects report hi gh levels of 
anxiety a referral for psychological support will be made.                                                                              
10.2. We do not believe that subjects in this st udy will be exposed to any risk of physical or 
psychological harm as a result of either the in tervention or research processes. Our measures 
do not assess individuals at risk of immediat ely harming themselves (e.g. suicide); therefore 
we will not have to screen the data to potenti ally intervene with individuals who may be a 
risk to themselves. 
10.3. N/A. There are no anticipated risks to others who are not participants .

they are at risk to develop a nother melanoma. Should subjects repo rt high levels of anxiety, a 
referral for psychological support will be made.  
 
The knowledge to be gained by [CONTACT_306647]-term 
benefit of skin self-examination. By [CONTACT_306648]-examination, the appli cants believe that it will be possible to determine if the 
educational intervention that can be used  in mammogram facilities, which would be 
beneficial if brought in to widespread use. 
12.0 Financial Compensation  
12.1 N/A. Participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_375457] for participation in the second 
survey (telephone call/REDCap one month after mammogram vi sit) and an additional $[ADDRESS_375458] su rvey (REDCap) three months after the 
mammogram.   
13.[ADDRESS_375459] deviations (age) and 
counts and percentages for all categorical variable s. Primary outcomes of SSE performance, biopsy, 
and diagnoses will be compared using Chi-square te sts of association or Fisher’s exact tests where 
sample sizes were restrictive. Due to the skewed  nature of the anxiety scale, a Wilcoxon rank sum 
test will be used to compare anxiety, the s econdary outcome, in the two groups. Descriptive 
statistics will be performed for th e tertiary outcome of dissemination. 
 
15.0 Confidentiality and Data Management: 
1. There are no biological specimens. All of the fo llowing data is collected in person consent 
and responses to structured interviews and focus groups.  
2. Our systems are guarded against outside en try by [CONTACT_140515]’s own firewall supporting 
128-bit encryption. This level of encryption prov ides the highest level of protection against 
hackers, computer break-ins, et c. All data is deidentified. Experienced research assistants 
will be employed and will receive training that includes emphasis upon the importance of confidentiality of information, and all personnel on the project will complete the required 
NIH training in the protection of human research participants.  
3. Data will be retained in separate locked file  cabinets and on computers with restricted and 
password protected access, without links to th e master code list. All data based on the 
research will be reported in aggregate form. No individual respondents will be identified. Electronic data will be maintained in a study specific database on the server of the 
Department of Dermatology at the Feinberg Sc hool of Medicine. Pape r- based files will be 
kept in a locked cabinet in a locked room w ithin the Northwestern University Department 
of Dermatology research offices. Identifiable data will be kept separate from the case report forms and source documents. Data gathered as  a result of this study are available to 
inspection on request by [CONTACT_306649], and the Northwestern Univ ersity Institutional Review Board (IRB).  
 
4. Only approved research personnel will have acce ss to the stored data. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_306638]. As per Department of Dermatology 
protocol, data will retained indefinite ly after the completion of the study.  
  
5. All data and other information in this study will  be maintained confidentially. In order to 
protect against risks posed by a potential loss of  confidentiality, we will take the following 
steps: First, subjects will be assured they are free to refrai n from answering any questions 
they do not wish to answer. Secondly, all data  will be identified only by a unique subject

15.1 Data Monitoring Plan to Ensu re the Safety of Participants: 
As previously described, all participants are encouraged to contact [CONTACT_978], [CONTACT_60966] at 
Northwestern, to report compla ints or adverse events. A telephone number and email address 
will be given to patients to contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Robinson if  they have any concerns or increased anxiety, 
or if they become worried about developi[INVESTIGATOR_306639]. Instructions  for reporting adverse 
events and complaints, as well as  for contact[CONTACT_306650] s, are included in the consent 
documents and on all contact [CONTACT_306651] d to participants through the course of the 
study. Any significant adverse events  will be reported to NIH in addition to the local IRB, in 
compliance with federal regulations.  
 
Our measures do not assess individuals at risk  of immediately harming themselves (e.g., 
suicide); therefore, we will not have to screen th e data to potentially intervene with individuals 
who may be a risk to themselves.

Title: Real-World Treatment Patterns and Outcomes Postmenopausal, Hormone-Receptor 
Positive (HR-positive), Human Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14907] 2 Negative (HER2-Negative), Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) Patients Treated with Palbociclib Plus Letrozole (Palbociclib+LET) as Initial Endocrine Therapy at Community Oncology Practices in the U.S.
Rationale and Background: Real-world research describing the demographic and clinical 
profile of patients, treatment patterns, and clinical benefit of palbociclib+LET as initial endocrine therapy for postmenopausal, HR-positive, HER2-negative MBC has been limited by [CONTACT_659089]-up. Similarly little is known regarding the profile of patients being prescribed newer agents such as ribociclib or what drives thecontinued use of aromatase inhibitor (AI) monotherapy as initial endocrine therapy for MBCwith the availability of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 agents.
Research Question and Objectives: This study aims to describe demographics, clinical 
characteristics, toxicity monitoring, treatment patterns and clinical outcomes across a geographically diverse, representative cohort of MBC patients receiving palbociclib+LETaccording to its labeled indication at U.S. community oncology practices.
Objectives
Among postmenopausal women receiving palbociclib+LET as initial endocrine therapy for 
HR-positive, HER2-negative, MBC:
1. Describe demographic and clinical characteristics of patients at the initiation of 
treatment.
2. Describe the frequency of laboratory monitoring for hematologic and cardiovascular 
toxicities during treatment.
3. Describe treatment patterns in terms of palbociclib+LET dosing, cycles received, and 
post-discontinuation treatment regimens.
4. Describe clinical outcomes in terms of objective response rates (ORR),
progression-free survival (PFS) during treatment and survival.

Palbociclib is approved for the treatment of HR- positive, HER2 -negative MBC in 
combination with an AI as initial endocrine based therap y in postmenopausal women or in 
combination with fulvestrant in women with disease progression following endocrine 
therap y.1Approval was based on the randomized phase II PALOMA -1 trial, which 
demonstrated that the addition of palbociclib to letrozole significantl y improved PFS in 
patients with advanced estrogen receptor positive ( ER-positive )/HER2 -negaive MBC 
(median PFS, 20.2 months vs. 10.2 months; hazard ratio [HR]= 0.448; P =0.0004).2
Palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant was approved one year later (February  2016) in 
pre-or postmenopausal women with disease progression following endocrine therap y based 
on results from the PALOMA -3 randomized controlled trial (RCT).3In the phase III RCT, 
PAL OMA -2, the findings of PAL OMA -1 were confirmed.  The me dian PFS estimate in the 
palbociclib +LET arm was 24.8 months compared to 14.5 months in the placebo plus 
letrozole arm (HR=0.58; P<0.001).[ADDRESS_889210] 
retrospective databases.5-8Estimates of the clinical benefit (partial response or better as 
reported b y the treating provider ) of palbociclib +LET presented in earl y 2018 were markedl y 
similar ranging from 79.5% to 83.5%.6,8Landmark PFS anal ysis varied between th e two 
studies ranging from 80.0% to 96.7% at 6 months, 67.1% to 84.1% at 12 months, and 
54.7%to 69.3% at 18 months.6,8A 24 -month estimate was available from one study  
(reported the higher estimates at each of the 6 -,12-, and 18- month interval previously  
referenced) ,which found 64.3% of patients were progression- free at 24 months.   With an 
additional y ear of real -world experience accrued since the time of data collection for these 
studies ,more precise estimates of disease response and PFS are available. 
The prior research was not statistically  powered to compare outcomes between 
palbocicl ib-treated patients to t hose who received LET monotherap y.  A large proportion of 
female HR -positive /HER2 -negative MBC continue to be prescribed AI monotherap yin lieu 
of the results of the PALOMA trials.9Moreover, recentl y published research indicates a 
higher rate of discontinuation (45.8% vs. 34.5%) for women prescribed AI -monotherap y.[ADDRESS_889211]-linetreatment with LET versus those prescribed palbociclib +LET have not been 
explored nor have clinical outcomes between them been compared .  Additionally , since the 
completion ofthepreviously  described real -world research ribociclib was approved in same 
indication as palbociclib in March of 2017 (in combination with an AI  as initial 
endocrine -based therap y for the treatment of postmenopausal women with 
HR-positive /HER2 -negative MBC).10No real -world data on clin ical characteristics, 
treatment patterns (including dose reductions and rates of discontinuation), or earl y estimates 
of rates of progression have been explored in a real -world cohort of ribociclib +AI treated 
patients.  Further exploration of treatment pat terns and clinical outcomes in terms of rates of 
progression, which patients receive LET or ribociclib +AI,and the outcomes of this treatment
is needed to understand the ty pes of patients most likely  to benefit from palbociclib +LET in 
the indicated populat ion.

8. RESEARCH METHODS 
8.1. Study Design
The current study will be conducted as a retrospective observational cohort study using a 
chart review methodology.  Providers in the Cardinal Health Oncology Provider Extended Network (OPEN) will be recruited to participate in the patient identification and data abstraction for this research study.  All study data are secondary data and will have been collected retrospectively from existing clinical data originally collected as part of routine care. 
Patient eligibility will be confirmed by [CONTACT_1963].  Providers will abstract the 
patient level data necessary to achieve the research objectives into an electronic case report form (eCRF).  Providers may complete a maximum of 20 eCRFs; verification of submitted data will be performed by [CONTACT_659091] (further description of data verification processes are provided in Section 8.8 ).  In order to achieve the research objectives related to the estimation 
of a 24-month PFS, providers will be asked to select consecutive patients starting with the earliest patient treated with palbociclib+LET meeting all the study eligibility requirements (See Section 7.2 ).  In addition, providers will be asked to consider the “earliest” 
palbociclib+LET treated patient as the first patient treated [ADDRESS_889212] instance they prescribed palbociclib+LET in clinical practice outside of a clinical trial.  In total up to200 patients treated with palbociclib+LET per labeled indication will be identified. 
8.2. Setting
Providers from OPEN will identify patients meeting the study selection criteria.  OPEN is a 
community of over 7,000 oncologists, hematologists and urologists providing care to cancer patients geographically distributed across the U.S. and practicing in both community and 
academic research settings.  OPEN community members include medical doctors, nurse 
practitioners, pharmacists and other individuals providing care to cancer patients.  Community members are not limited to any specific group purchasing organization or any other membership requirements.  Community members are included in OPEN if they and their practice utilizes Cardinal Health’s proprietary Point-of-Care claims remittance software for practice management purposes or if they have participated in Cardinal Health sponsored research activities.  Providers within the OPEN database are evenly distributed between regions (Northeast, Midwest, South and West regions) across different size practices (small, medium or large practice) and years of experience in providing cancer care.CCI

treating two or more HR -positive /HER2 -negatie MBC patients who meet the eligibility  
criteria for the stud y.  Providers who responded to the initial feasibility  survey  will be the 
first set of ph ysicians asked to participate in the research.   Should further recruitment be 
required to achieve the desire d sample size Cardinal Health will recruit from its entire 
database of providers.
Providers will be allowed to complete up to [ADDRESS_889214] 
(IRB).   No site specific IRB approval will be sought and pr oviders requiring this approval 
will not be eligible. 
After IRB approval of the research protocol, the eCRF will be pre -tested with 4 providers;
data collected as part of the pre -test will not be used in the final anal ytical dataset.  After 
testing and re visions (if necessary ),providers who completed a feasibility  assessment for the 
research will be contact[CONTACT_659092].   Data collection will be 
conduc ted over the course of 4 -weeks.  Providers arecompensated at fair market value for 
each completed and verified eCRF assuming a rate of pay ment based on one hour of data 
collection (seeSection 8.6.1 ). 
8.2.1. Inclusion Criteria
Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the 
study :
1.Diagnosed with locoregional recurrent or metastatic female breast cancer .

No exclusion criteria will be imposed for the selection of patients.i
8.3.Variables
For purposes of this study, a regimen will be defined as one or more anti -cancer agents given 
in combination, ove r a period of time .  Providers will be informed as to the definition of a 
regimen but will make the determination themselves as to what constituted a line of therapy 
in the advanced/ metastatic setting .  However, re -assignment of the lines of therap y in the
metastatic setting may  occur during data anal ysisbased on the dates regimens were initiated 
and discontinued and the rationale for that discontinuation.  For example a patient treated 
with palbociclib +LET who discontinued p albociclib but continued with L ETmay be 
indicated as a single line by  [CONTACT_659093].  All dates of initiation and 
discontinuation of individual agents when received in combination will be abstracted b y the 
patient’s treating ph ysician.
Additionally , disease progression is taken to have occurred when a pathology  report or 
radiological scan note indicates disease progression and/or there is a ph ysician progress note 
consistent with that determination.   Providers will be informed of these criteria and indicate 
the date of disease progression as recorded in the patient charts during initial endocrine 
therap y for MBC following that guidance.

Page 19 of 318.4. Data Sources
Providers will complete data abstraction into the eCRF using all structured and unstructured 
data, including laboratory, pathology, and radiology files from the selected patients’ electronic health records. 
8.5. Study Size
To ensure sufficient patients treated with palbociclib+LET could be identified a feasibility 
assessment was conducted.  A random sample of providers in the OPEN database were queried in March 2018 to determine the number of potential patients’ eligible for the research.  Among the 51 physicians who responded, 44 (86%) reported treating a total of 804 HR-positive/HER2-negative MBC patients with palbociclib+LET in the past year.  Among those [ADDRESS_889215] year, 126 achieved CR, 340 achieved PR, 232 achieved SD, 95 achieved PD, and 11 were missing response documentation.  Based on the results of this query, it is estimated that Cardinal Health through OPEN will be able to identify 200 patients treated with palbociclib+LET, 
 for the study cohort.
8.6. Data Management 
All study data will be entered into the eCRF.  The eCRF is designed to allow providers to 
efficiently move through the patient chart or electronic medical record (EMR) based on the journey of the patient through the course of their disease.  The eCRF conforms to the rules and regulations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 governing the abstraction and storage of protected health information (PHI).  Noprotected health information will be collected in the course of the chart review or stored in the eCRF.
Physicians will be compensated through an honoraria payment for each completed and 
validated eCRF.  The eCRF is anticipated to take up to 45 minutes per patient to complete,and the rate of payment to providers for participation in this study is $300/completed and validated eCRF.  Participating physicians will be asked to complete the chart review individually, meaning that site research staff or supportive staff will not complete any data abstraction. 
Cardinal Health will be responsible for the programming, testing, and hosting of data from 
submitted eCRFs.  Providers will access the eCRF through a secure web-based portal, 
including during the field testing procedures, with all data stored on encrypted, password 
protected and HIPAA compliant servers housed within the Cardinal Health electronic data storage infrastructure.  Cardinal Health will perform extensive testing of the eCRF to ensure functionality across web-based user environments, loopi[INVESTIGATOR_593878]-related fields (required responses to certain fields prior to entering data into subsequent field), and other programmatic checks to ensure the reduction of the input of erroneous data (such as specifying maximums for year of birth or initiation of first-line treatment within the dates of the enrollment period).  In addition, the eCRF will be field-tested among [ADDRESS_889216] results will be reviewed b y [COMPANY_007] with Cardinal 
Health staff; however, [COMPANY_007] will not have access to the individual data collected.   Any 
changes made to the eCRF doc ument as a result of the pre -test will require the resubmission 
of the eCRF and stud y protocol to the I RB. 
8.6.1. Case Report Forms (CRFs) /Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an el ectronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient .  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without w ritten permission from [COMPANY_007].  Cardinal Health shall ensure that the 
CRFs are securel y stored at the study  site in encrypted electro nicform and will be password 
protected to prevent access by  [CONTACT_20011].
Cardinal Health has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any  other data collec tion forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring , and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed b y an authorized staff member of Cardinal Health to attest that the data 
contained on the CRFs are true.  Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the 
original entry .
In most cases ,the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110258]'s chart.  In these cases, 
data collected on the CRFs must match those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document.  In these cases, a document 
should be available at Cardinal Health and at [COMPANY_007] that clearly  identifies those data that will 
be recorded on the CRF ,and for which the CRF will stand as the source document. 
8.6.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], 
Cardinal He alth agrees to keep records, including the ident ity of all participating patients 
(sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed 
informed consent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safet y reporting forms, source documents, 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes , and telephone call reports).   The records should 
be retained b y Cardinal Heath according to local regulations or as spe cified in the vendor 
study  contract whichever is longer.  The investigator must ensure that the records continue to 
be stored securel y for so long as they  are retained.
If Cardinal Health becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records fo r the 
required period ,[COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The study  records must be 
transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007], such as another investigator, another 
institution, or to an independent third part y arranged by [CONTACT_4618].

even if r etention requirements have been met.
8.7.Data Analysis 
Detailed methodology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of data collected in this study will 
be documented in a SAP, which will be dated, filed and maintained by  [CONTACT_456].   The SAP 
may modify  the pla ns outlined in the protocol; any major modifications of primary  endpoint 
definitions or their anal yses would be reflected in a protocol amendment .
Beyond the variables described in Section 8.3,non time -to-event clinical outcomes of interest 
include the ORR and clinical benefit rate (CBR) (CR+PR+SD lasting >24 weeks) .  The ORR
and CBR will be ev aluated according the provider assessed response to therap y.  
Additionally , providers will also enter the data of disease progression into the eCRF 
(ordiscontinuation due to toxicity  or other rationale) as reported in the patient charts .  PFS
and/or time to progression will be assessed at 6 -, 12-, 18- , and 24- month following the 
initiation of therapy  (survival rates will also be reported separatel y).
All categorical or numeric non time- to-event variables collected from the chart data 
abstraction or calculated from said data will analyzed using descriptive statistical techniques.   
For numeric variables, th e mean , standard deviation, median, and minimum/maximum will 
be calculated as appropriate.   For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be 
provided.  The number of missing or unknown observations will be described for both 
categorical and n umeric variables.   The 95% confidence internals will be provided as a 
measure of estimated precision when appropriate.   Comparisons of categorical variable will 
be made using Chi -square tests (or Fisher exact test) while the student’s T- test (or Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test), F -test or other non-parametric equivalent test will be used to compare values 
for numeric variables.   Statistical significance will be determined using a two -sided =0.[ADDRESS_889218] progressed by [CONTACT_659094] , the Kaplan -Meier method (product limit estimator) will be used to generate 
median estimates of time to events if median time is reached within the population and 
survival curves will also be genera ted.  In addition to calculating the median survival 
estimate, the life -table method will be used to estimate progression free rates and PFS at 
6-, 12-, 18-, and 24 -monthfollowing initiation of endocrine -based therap y in the metastatic 
setting.

Page 22of 318.8.Quality Control
During data collection, Cardinal Health’s clinical research staff will review all submitted 
eCRFs for qualit y control.  Cardinal Health’s clinical research team will inspect each 
submitted eCRF for implausible dates (ie ,date of death prior to last date of treatment), 
non-standard treatments, laband radiology  results which are inconsistent with known clinical 
parameters, or other clinical data which is inconsistent with known standards and outcomes.   
Should these items be discovered, Cardinal Health ’s clinical research team will contact [CONTACT_659095] .  All providers are informed in their 
contractual agreement that follo w-up with clinical staff at Cardinal Health may be required.  
Participating providers are as ked to create a [ADDRESS_889219] an anal ysis of submitted data to identify  any data points which are inconsistent 
(outliers) with the study  population average.  This anal ysis will include a descriptive analy sis 
of the provider characteristics, demographics, baseline clinical and disease characteristics, 
and characteristics of treatment patterns (eg ,DOT).  Data points flagged as outliers will be 
delivered to the clinical research team who will contact [CONTACT_659096].
8.9.Limitations of the R esearch M ethods
The key limitation of this research and research of this nature involving retrospective medical 
chart review abstraction by a patient’s treating providers is the reliance on the provider to 
accuratel y complete the eCRF.   In order to ensure clarity  and consistency in reporting ,the 
eCRF will be internall y and externally pre -tested.  In addition, clinical data quality  review 
will be conducted for each eCRF and invalid or outlier data will be flagged for further review 
with the treating clinician by  [CONTACT_659097]. 
Several other limitations impact the external generalizability  the results of this retrospective 
cohort study .  Given that providers abstract data on sele cted patients there is an opportunity  
for the following to occur: (1) provider selection bias; (2) patient selection bias; (3) and 
information bias, related to the availability  and quality  of data contained within the patient 
charts.
In terms of the repres entativeness of the provider cohort by [CONTACT_659098] a maximum number of 
eCRFs which can be completed this bias is reduced.  With a maximum of [ADDRESS_889220], data may not be available directly making it possible that items such as dates of initiation and discontinuation of treatment would be less accurate compared to data obtained from an administrative claims database.  Similarly, data points such as date of death will be determined based on patient records; providers are not asked to verify date of death based on the Social Security Administration or commercial entities which collect detailed death data.  In all these examples, the data are assumed to be missing at random and inspection of data elements will be used to confirm this hypothesis. 
There is also a risk of incomplete data as a result of variable patient follow-up with a single 
provider.  Patients may have initiated care at another provider and transitioned to the provider or practice completing the data abstraction.  Patients may also have received care from another provider within the practice at multiple points during the course of their disease management and treatment.  Thus, data elements from the prior period may not be captured in the participating physician’s EMR or clinical notes and providers abstracting the data may misinterpret the intent of the treating provider’s notes.  In this study, it is required that the patient submitted for study inclusion has been managed and or seen by [CONTACT_659099].

9. PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS
All study materials, including the research protocol and paper-version of the eCRF, will be 
reviewed by a central IRB prior to any data abstraction including field-testing of the eCRF.  Providers are required to be able to participate in research monitored by a central IRB.  At all times, patients’ PHI will be kept confidential in accordance with HIPAA.  The eCRF will not capture any data related to the patients’ name, full date of birth, social security number, health insurance plan number, medical record number, or other such PHI although PHI related to dates of treatment or clinical events will be collected.  A waiver for obtaining informed consent from the provider or patient is sought for this research given the minimal risk imposed by [CONTACT_659100]. CCI

Final v1, [ADDRESS_889221] of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
with scientific purpose, value and rigor and follow generall y accepted research practices 
described in Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepi[INVESTIGATOR_16084] (GPP) issued by  [CONTACT_659102] , Good Practices for Outcomes Research issued by  [CONTACT_659103] (I SPOR), the STROBE (Strengthening the

principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.
10.MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING OF ADVANCE EVENTS /ADVANCE
REACTIONS
This study  protocol requires human review of patient- level unstructur ed data; unstructured 
data refer to verbatim medical data, including text- based descriptions and visual depi[INVESTIGATOR_539935], such as medical records, images of ph ysician notes, neurological scans, 
X-rays, or narrative fields in a database.  T he reviewer is obligated to report adverse events 
(AEs) with explicit attribution to any  [COMPANY_007] drug that appear in the reviewed information 
(defined per the patient population and study  period specified in the protocol).  Explicit 
attribution is not infer red by  a temporal relationship between drug administration and an AE, 
but must be based on a definite statement of causality  by a healthcare provider linking drug 
administration to the AE.
The requirements for reporting safet y events on the non -interventio nal study  (NIS) adverse 
event monitoring (AEM) Report Form to [COMPANY_007] Safet y are as follows:
All serious and non- serious AEs with explicit attribution to any [COMPANY_007] drug that 
appear in the reviewed information must be recorded on the CRF and reported, withi n 
24hours of awareness, to [COMPANY_007] Safety  using the NI S AEM Report Form .
Scenarios involving drug exposure, including exposure during pregnancy , exposure 
during breast feeding, medication error, overdose, misuse, extravasation, lack of 
efficacy ,and occupa tional exposure associated with the use of a [COMPANY_007] product must 
be reported, within [ADDRESS_889222] one patient identifier (eg, gender, age as captured in the narrative field of 
the form) will be reported on the NI S AEM Report Form, thus allowing the report to be 
considered a valid one in accordance with pharmacovigilance leg islation.  All identifiers will 
be limited to generalities, such as the statement “A 35- year-old female...” or “An elderl y 
male...”  Other identifiers will have been removed.

Name” may  be documented in month/y ear (mmm/yyyy ) format rather than identify ing the 
actual date of occurrence within the month /y ear of occurrence in the day /month/y ear 
(DD/MMM/YYYY) format.
All research staff members must complete the following P fizer training requirements:
“YRR Training for Vendors W orking on [COMPANY_007] Studies (excluding interventional 
clinical studies and non- interventional primary data collection studies with

These trainings must be completed by  [CONTACT_659104].  All trainings include a “Confirmation of Training Certificate” (for signature b y 
the trainee) as a record of completion of the training, which must be kept in a retrievable 
format.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_659088] t raining certificates must be provided to [COMPANY_007].
Re-training must be completed on an annual basis using the most current Your Reporting 
Responsibilities training materials.
11. P LANS FOR DISSEMINATING AND COMMUNICATING STUDY RESULTS
In the event of an y prohibi tion or restriction imposed (eg, clinical hold) by  [CONTACT_220009] y in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of an y new 
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of a [COMPANY_007] 
product , [COMPANY_007] should be informed immediately .

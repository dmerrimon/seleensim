Page 3PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Background
Tanezumab is a monoclonal antibody  that binds to and inhibits the actions of nerve growth 
factor (NGF).  The Nerve Growth Factor Inhibitor ( NGFI) class may  offer an important 
breakthrough in the treatment of chronic pain and is under clinical investigation for the 
treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis or other chronic pain conditions. 
The completed Phase [ADDRESS_50319] demonstrated that 
tanezumab is efficacious and generally  safe and well tolerated for the treatment of pain due 
to osteoarthritis and chronic low back pain.  In addition, completed Phase 1/2studies suggest 
tanezumab is also efficacious and generally  safe for the treatment of neuropathic, visceral, 
and cancer pain. 
In 2010, the [LOCATION_002] (US) Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Division of 
Analgesia, Anesthetic, and Addiction Products (DAAAP) placed tanezumab (June/July  2010) 
and subs equentl y the entire NGFI class (December 2010) on partial clinical hold due to 
adverse events initially  described b y investigators as osteonecrosis that in some cases 
resulted in total joint replacement.  [COMPANY_007] voluntarily  imposed the partial clinical hold on 
study  conduct in all countries.
Extensive anal yses of the reports of osteonecrosis and other total joint replacements were 
conducted.[ADDRESS_50320] 
not been identified in previously  completed tanezumab studies, per agreement with the FDA, 
this and other clinical studies of tanezumab will incorporate additional safety measures to 
monitor for and manage subj ects who may  develop evidence of clinicall y important 
sympathetic nervous s ystem dy sfunction.  
Study Objectives and Endpoints
Primary Objective :
To describe the post -operative outcome of subjects who underwent a total knee, hip, 
or shoulder replacement wh ile participating in tanezumab Study  A4091056, 
A4091057 or A4091058 (treatment period and safety follow -up period) .
Secondary Objective s:
To compare the post- operative outcome for tanezumab 2.5 mg and 5 mg versus 
non-steroid anti -inflammatory  drugs ( NSAID s)for subjects who underwent a total 
knee, hip, or shoulder replacement while participating in tanezumab Study  
A4091058.
To describe the post -operative outcome of subjects from tanezumab Study  A4091059, 
A4091061 or A4091063 who underwent a total knee, hip, or shoulder replacement
Endpoints :
The following endpoints are considered co -equal:
Surgeon’s Assessment of Procedural Difficult y: number and percentage of surgeries 
assessed as uneventful, minor complications or major complications .
Subject’s overall satisfaction with surgery  as assessed by [CONTACT_47584] -Administered 
Patient Satisfaction (SAPS) Scale: number and percentage of subjects satisfied vs .
unsatisfied with their total joint replacement at Week 24 .
Number and percentage of subjects with a post -surgical complication(s) up to 
Week 24 (derived from reported adverse events; see also Section 9).

only).
Concomitant analgesic medication use.
Study Design
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, long -term observational s tudy of subjects from tanezumab 
Study  A4091056, A4091057 or A4091058 (regardless of treatment group) who undergo a 
total knee, hip or shoulder replacement during participation in the study (treatment period or 
safet y follow- up period) .  If while the subjec t is participating in this study  (A4091064), the 
subject undergoes an additional total joint replacement surgery  or the site becomes aware that 
an additional total joint replacement surgery  has been scheduled for the subject, the subject 
will be requested to provide information on the additional total joint replacement surgery  as 
well.  Finally , any subject with a qualifying total joint replacement after the last subject in the 
study  completes the treatment period in tanezumab studies A4091059, A4091061 or 
A4091063 may be followed in this study  (A4091064).
This study  is designed with a total duration of subject follow- up of 24 weeks after the total 
joint replacement surgery.  There will be two methods of data collection utilized in this 
study : interview b y site staff via the telephone and interactive web- response sy stem (IWRS) 
accessed b y desktop, laptop or tablet computer (or paper if the subject has no access to the 
internet via a desktop, laptop or tablet computer).  Following the surgery , the subject will be 
contact[CONTACT_47585] y via telephone b y stud y site personnel to ascertain whether the subject has 
experienced an y adverse events and to record an y concomitant analgesic medications the 
subject is taking as well as the reason for the medication use.  An asse ssment of the subject’s 
overall satisfaction with their total joint replacement (IWRS), average pain in the replaced 
joint (I WRS), the subject’s level of function and activity  in the replaced joint (I WRS) and 
physical rehabilitation activities (telephone interview) will be made at Weeks 4, 12 and 24.  
At Weeks 12 and 24, subjects will be queried during the telephone interview as to whether 
any additional or corrective procedures related to the total joint replacement are planned. 
All events of total knee, hip or shoulder replacement will be reviewed b y the Joint Safety 
Adjudication Committee (Adjudication Committee) established for the tanezumab clinical 
program.

Final Protocol Amendment 1, [ADDRESS_50321] in the study  completes the 
treatment period in studies A4091059, A4091061 or A4091063 may be included.  The 
number of subjects who will enroll in this study  is unknown but is estimated to be less than 
250subjects. Also unknown is the distribution of subjects ac ross treatment groups (i e,the 
treatment given in Study A4091056, A4091057, A4091058 , or other tanezumab study). 
Therefore, it is predicted that there will be insufficient statistical power to perform statistical 
inferential analy ses.  All anal yses will be descriptive in nature.
All subjects enrolled in the study  who have a total joint replacement will be included in the 
summary  tables. 
A summary  of data will be shown using subject s from study  A4091058.  The incidence of 
subjects with a total joint replac ement will be summarized for all subjects, and split by  [CONTACT_26769]  
A4091058 treatment group.  Comparisons of the total joint replacement rates will be made 
between tanezumab versus active comparator treatment groups, using risk differences and 
ratios with 95% c onfidence intervals. Summaries of the time to total joint replacement 
surgery  and time to first sy mptom (leading to total joint replacement surgery ) will be 
summarized using Kaplan -Meier survival estimates from the date of first subcutaneous dose 
in Study A4091058, and shown overall, and split by  [CONTACT_26769]  A4091058 treatment group where 
there are sufficient numbers of subjects .  A further summary  of the incidence of subject s with 
total joint replacements will be shown separately  for studies A4091056, A4091057,
A4091059, A4091061 and A4091063, as applicable .  Similar summaries by  [CONTACT_47586].   The summary  of time to total joint replacement surgery  
and time to first symptom (leading to total joint replacement surgery ) will also b e performed 
using data for s ubject s from Studies A4091056 and A4091057.
Unless otherwise stated, data from this study  will be presented at Baseline and Weeks 4, 12, 
and 24 using observed data (no imputation for missing data), and at Week [ADDRESS_50322] (LOCF) for missing data.  Data will be shown at the timepoints 
specified and also using change from (pre- surgery) Baseline when Baseline data are available 
and where relevant.  Data will be shown overall, and split by  [CONTACT_39815] p.  Data on 
surgical difficult y and outcomes, and subject safety  data will be summarized by  [CONTACT_3449] , with 
an additional combined summary  for the subject s from the osteoarthritis studies.
For the Surgeon’s Assessment of Procedural Difficulty , the number and p ercentage of 
subjects in each category (Uneventful, Minor complications, Major complications) will be 
presented.  Complications reported by  [CONTACT_47587].
For the s ubject’s overall satisfaction with s urgery  assessments (using the Self -Administ ered 
Patient Satisfaction scale, SAPS), the responses [score] for each category  will be stratified by  
[CONTACT_47588] (hip, knee or shoulder) and summarized for each of the four items. Thetotal

the question “ How satisfied are you with the results of y our surgery ?” will also be stratified 
by [CONTACT_47588] (hip, knee or shoulder) and summarized as satisfied (very satisfied and 
somewhat satisfied categories combined) an d dissatisfied (somewhat dissatisfied and very  
dissatisfied categories combined).
Similarly , the number and percentage of subjects who have required (i) additional or 
corrective procedures related to their total joint replacement and (ii) participating in physical 
rehabilitation activities related to their replaced joint will be presented. 
Average pain ( Numeric Rating Scale , NRS) in the replaced joint for all subjects, WOMAC 
Pain, Stiffness and Phy sical Function sub- scale scores for subjects who had total knee or hip 
replacement and SPADI Pain, Function and Total Score for subjects who had total shoulder 
replacement will be summarized (including change from Baseline summaries).
Standard safet y reporting tables will summarize and list adverse event and conco mitant 
analgesic medications data.
The number and percent of subjects with specified post- surgical complications will be 
presented. The list of post -surgical complications will be derived from reported adverse 
events and will consist of complications that are clinically  significant and attributable to the 
total arthroplasty  procedure e g,periprosthetic joint infection/wound infection, periprosthetic 
fracture, pulmonary embolism or sepsis/septicemia/shock.  Literature reported anal ysesof 
post-surgical complications will be used for guidance in developi[INVESTIGATOR_47560] -surgical 
complications. The list of post- surgical complications will be developed during Study
A4091064 and finalized prior to Study A4091058 database lock. 
Separate adverse event summaries by  [CONTACT_47589] s ympathetic function will be presented. 
For subjects from study  A4091058 and for subjects from an y of the osteoarth ritis studies, 
summaries of total joint replacement, adjudication event r ates and post -surgical outcomes 
will be shown for subgroups including age, gender, body -mass index (BMI), baseline 
Kellgren- Lawrence grade of the replaced joint (knees and hips onl y) and number of joints 
with osteoarthritis ( OA).
Data Monitoring Committee
An independent, external Data Monitoring Committee ( E-DMC )has been re-instituted for 
the tanezumab clinical program.   This committee will be composed of at least one 
rheumatologist, neurologist, statistician, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_47561].   The E-DMC will review 
unblinded safet y data including (but not limited to) adverse events and serious adverse events 
on a regular basis throughout the trial.   The E-DMC will have written operating procedures 
and a Charter, including a specific description of the scope of their res ponsibilities.

Page 161.INTRODUCTION
1.1. Mechanism of Action/ Indication
Tanez umab (PF -04383119, formerl y RN624) is an anti -nerve growth factor monoclonal 
antibody  under development for the relief of signs and sy mptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) and 
management of chronic pain including c hronic l ow back pain (CLBP).
1.2.Background and Ration ale
1.2.1. Role of Nerve Growth Factor in the Modulation of Pain
During mammalian development, nerve growth factor (NGF) is required for the survival and 
growth of several populations of neurons.  In adults, the effect of NGF signaling shifts from 
the regulation of neuronal survival to the regulation of neuronal phenoty pe and function.  The 
role of NGF in the adult mammal appears to principally  be as a modulator of nociceptive 
neuronal activity .  Thus, NGF play s an important role in modulation of the pain response.4,5  
Many  studies employ ing a variet y of antibodies to NGF or tropomyosin receptor kinase 
A(trkA) -IgG fusion protein have demonstrated that blocking NGF bioactivity normalizes 
pain sensitivity , particularly  in states of allody nia and hy persensitivity , following a variet y of 
insults such as Freund’s adjuvant, carrageenan, or surgical incision.5,6
Both interleukin (IL) -1and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF -) have been shown to induce 
synthesis of NGF.  Inhibition of NGF in turn blocks the hy peralgesia experienced after 
administration of these cy tokines.7,[ADDRESS_50337]
Tanezumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G Type2 (IgG 2) monoclonal antibody , derived 
from a murine precursor by  [CONTACT_47590] a 
human antibody  framework, followed by  [CONTACT_47591] -directed mutagenesis using 
proprietary  technology  to improve binding a ffinity and specificit y.  A mutation was 
performed in the Fc portion of the antibody  to decrease its ability  to activate complement or 
to support antibody  dependent cell -mediated cy totoxicity .9,10
Tanezumab is highly  potent in sequestering NGF and preventing interaction with the trkA or 
p75 receptors.  Tanezumab and/or the murine precursor have been shown to be an effective 
analgesic in nonclinical animal models of pathological pain including arthritis, cancer pain, 
and post -surgical pain models.[ADDRESS_50338] been treated with 
tanezumab in non cancer pain clinical studies.  In patients treated with tanezumab 
monotherap yor tanezumab + NSAID in completed non cancer pain studies, treatment 
experience with tanezumab approximates 5900 patient -years of treatment exposure.

Page 17A total of 17 clinical studies overall (4 Phase 2 studies and 13 Phase 3 studies ) were initiated 
to provi de evidence of efficacy  and safety  of tanezumab with intravenous (IV)or 
subcutaneous ( SC)administration for the relief of the signs and sy mptoms of osteoarthritis 
alone or in combination with NSAI Ds.  Both IV and SC routes of administration with 
tanezuma b at fixed dose levels of 2.[ADDRESS_50339] s. 
The efficacy  and safet y of tanezumab IV in chronic low back pain has been evaluated in 
3Phase 2 studies (N=1564).  The first was a small Phase 2proof -of-concept study  
(A4091004; N=217) which evaluated the efficacy  and safet y of tanezumab 200 g/kg IV 
relative to placebo or naproxen 500 mg twice a day  (BID).  This study  was followed by  a 
Phase 2 dose -ranging study  (A4091012; N=1347) that evaluated the efficacy and safet y of 
fixed doses of tanezumab of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg IV relative to placebo or naproxen 
500mg BI D and a long term safet y extension study (A4091039; N=848) which evaluated the

administered b y IV or SC administration every  8weeks at fixed doses ranging 1 mg to 20 mg 
or equivalent bod y-weight adjus ted doses up to 100 mg. 
In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Division of Analgesia, Anesthetic, 
and Addiction Products (DAAAP) placed tanezumab (June/July  2010) and subsequently  the 
entire NGFI class (December 2010) on partial clinical hol d due to adverse events initially  
described b y investigators as osteonecrosis that in some cases resulted in total joint 
replacement.  [COMPANY_007] voluntarily  imposed the partial clinical hold on study  conduct in all 
countries.  The conduct of Phase 2/3 studies in osteoarthritis or other chronic pain conditions 
was impacted to vary ing extents by  [CONTACT_47592]/July  2010.
Extensive anal yses of the reports of osteonecrosis and other total join t replacements were 
conducted.[ADDRESS_50341] 28, 2012, the FDA lifted the partial clinical
hold on tanezumab allowing the resumption of clinical studies for osteoarthritis and all other 
chronic pain conditions. 
The FDA placed another partial clinical hold on the tanezumab clinical development program 
as well as all NGFI antibody  studies in Dec ember 2012 due to concerns about adverse 
changes in the s ympathetic nervous s ystem of mature animals.  Onl y studies in patients with 
cancer pain were allowed to continue.  During 2013- 2014, [COMPANY_007] conducted a comprehensive 
series of nonclinical studies to investigate the nonclinical effects on the s ympathetic nervous 
system which led to the partial clinical hold (described in Sections 5.3 of the tanezumab 
Investigator ’s Brochure).

The majority  of information regarding the safet y profile of tanezumab comes from studies 
conducted in subject s with osteoarthritis.  The safety  profile observed to date in chronic low 
back pain and other chronic pain subject populations does not differ markedly  from the 
results observed in the osteoarthritis studies.
A total of [ADDRESS_50351] s were t reated in studies using I V administration of tanezumab; 
however, 985subject s with osteoarthritis were treated in [ADDRESS_50352] s treate d with tanezumab monotherapy  (5-10 mg) was similar to subject s 
receiving active comparator treatment and increased over placebo -treated subject s.  In the 
tanezumab 2.5 mg monotherap y treatment group, the incidence of adverse events was similar 
to active comparator while the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious 
adverse events was similar to that of the placebo treatment group. Across the tanezumab 
monotherap y doses, the rates of adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and 
serious adverse events were similar with tanezumab 5 mg and 10 mg, and elevated in 
comparison to tanezumab 2.5 mg.  Tanezumab/NSAI D combination therapy  was as sociated 
with higher overall adverse event rates.  The relationship of incidence to the dose of 
tanezumab administered was similar to that observed with tanezumab monotherapy .

nasophary ngitis, osteoarthritis, and hy pertension.
The most common adverse events reported in the non- controlled, lon g-term Phase 3 
osteoarthritis studies were similar to those seen in the controlled Phase 3 osteoarthritis 
studies with the exception of the inclusion of musculoskeletal pain and exclusion of 
hypertension and nasophary ngititis and all gastrointestinal- related adverse events.  
Dose -related increases in the incidence of peripheral edema, joint swelling, osteoarthritis and

[IP_ADDRESS].1. Sympathetic Nervous System
In completed Phase 3 osteoarthritis studies, the incidence and discontinuation rates due to 
adverse events consistent with decreased s ympathetic function associated with tanezumab 
monotherapy (combined doses of 2.5 to 10 mg) were less than or equal to rates with placebo 
or active comparator.  No evidence of dose related elevations in the frequency of adverse 
events suggestive of decreased s ympathetic nervous sy stem function were observed at 
tanezumab doses of 2.[ADDRESS_50354] s with osteoarthritis or chronic low back pain. 
Tanezumab 20 mg in chronic low back pain had marginally  higher event rates compared to 
placebo and active comparator treatment groups. 
Based on completed osteoarthritis studies where orthostatic blood pressure, heart rate deep 
breathing, or autonomic sym ptoms captured with the Neuropathy  Symptom Change (NSC) 
questionnaire were specifically  assessed, the data are not suggestive of an adverse effect of 
tanezumab on autonomic function. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Joint Safety 
Following the imposition of the clinical hold, a comprehe nsive investigation and anal yses 
related to joint -safety  were conducted, based on tanezumab monotherapy  exposure in over 
[ADDRESS_50355] s and tanezumab/NSAID combination therap y in [ADDRESS_50356] s who received tanezumab treatment alone or in combination with NSAI Ds 
for 6 months or longer.  These data were sufficient to define and characterize the adverse 
event of concern –rapi[INVESTIGATOR_47566] –and evaluate the risk of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y 
progressive osteoarthritis in the conte xt of the overall benefit -risk profile of tanezumab 
compared to standard of care.  The results and conclusions regarding tanezumab and the 
other anti -NGF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_47567].1,2,[ADDRESS_50357] from osteoarthritis. A 
risk of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y progressive osteoarthritis was identified.  The risk of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_47568]/NSAID combination therap y but greater than with placebo or active comparator 
treatment.  A majorit y of subject s identified with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_47569].  The event rate of all -cause 
joint replacements in subjects with osteoarthritis was comparable among placebo, active 
comparator, and tanezumab monotherapy  treatment groups.
Risk mitigation measures have been developed as an outgrowth of the joint- related safet y 
analyses to reduce the risk of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y progressive osteoarthritis. Risk mitigation measures 
were developed using recommendations from discussions with European agencies [United 
Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory  Agency  (MHRA), [LOCATION_013] ’s 
Paul Ehrlich I nstitute (PEI) and Spain’s Agency  on Medicinal Products and Medical Devices 
(AEMPS)] as well as the FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee and interactions with FDA . 
These risk mitigation measures have been included in the tanezumab clinical development 
program.
1.2.4. Rationale for Study
Measures to better characterize the joint safet y issue have been developed and agreed with 
FDA.  This study  is one component of the agreed risk characterization measures and is an 
attempt to address the potential concern that subject s treated with tanezumab have a different 
post-surgical outcome than those not treated with tanezumab.  The total joint replacement 
data from completed tanezumab studies does not suggest a different post -surgical outcome in 
tanezumab treated subject s however those data were gathered retrospectively. The t ypes of 
endpoints to be assessed in this prospe ctive study  and the duration of the study  have been 
agreed to with the FDA.  Every  effort will be made to enroll all A4091056, A4091057 and 
A4091058 subject s who undergo a qualify ing total joint replacement into this study  however 
it is acknowledged that t o a certain extent the population enrolled in this study  will be 
'self-selected' and thus there may be subject s with a qualify ing total jo int replacement who 
choose not to enter the study .
1.2.5. Rationale for Selected Subject Reported Outcome Measures
Subject -based measures of health-related qualit y of life have increasingly  been used b y the 
orthopedic research community  as a means to define a successful intervention.12Subject
reported outcomes ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_47570] t-arthroplasty  include overall satisfaction with the 
joint replacement, pain and function. 
TheSelf-Administered Patient Satisfaction Scale (SAPS) will be utilized to assess subject
satisfaction in this study .  The SAPS is a multidimensional, disease spec ific measure that 
evaluates subject satisfac tion with the outcome of hip or knee arthroplast y and was designed 
to be used in conjunction with other clinical measures and functional health status 
instruments to evaluate the results of hip and knee arthropla sty.  The validity  and reliability  
of the scale has been demonstrated.13The scale consists of four items focusing on 
satisfaction with the extent of pain relief, improvement in ability  to perform home or y ard 
work, ability  to perform recreational activities and overall satisfaction with joint replacement.

The WOMAC is a self -administered condition- specific instrument which assesses pain, 
disability  and joint stiffness in knee and hip osteoarthritis.  I t is a valid, reliable and 
responsive measure of outcome in subject s with arthritis and has been used extensively .12,15,[ADDRESS_50359] s undergoing shoulder arthroplasty .17,18The 
instrument consists of two dimensions (pain and function).  The pain dimension consists of 
five questions regarding the severit y of an individual’s pain.  Functional activities are 
assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty  an individual has 
with various activities of daily  living that require upper extremity  use.
For each of the selected subject reported outcome measures t here are data available in the 
literature .These data will be utilized to contextualize the results of this study.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Interactive Web Response System
To avoid a social desirability  bias in the subject reported outcomes, an Interactive Web 
Response Sy stem (IWRS) will be utilized in this study.   Contingency  plans w ill be in place to 
address s ystem and/ or connectivity  issues with the I WRS. 
However, eligibility  for this study  does not require access to the internet via a desktop, laptop 
or tablet computer so, for those subject s without access to the internet via a de sktop, laptop or 
tablet computer , paper versions of the assessments will be utilized .Though not optimal, the 
use of two methods to collect subject reported outcomes will maximize the ability  tocapture
information from allsubject s who undergo a total kn ee, hip, or shoulder replacement surgery  
while participating in tanezumab Study  A4091056, A4091057 or A4091058 .Additional 
considerations which mitigate the concerns about using two methods to collect subject
reported outcomes in the sa me study  include th at this study  has not been formally  powered 
and all anal yses will be descriptive rather than inferential.

3.STUDY DESIGN
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, long -term observational study  of subjects from tanezumab 
Study  A4091056, A4091057 or A4091058 (regardless of treatment group) who undergo a 
total knee, hi p or shoulder replacement during participation in the study (treatment period or 
safet y follow- up period) .  If while the subject is participating in this study  (A4091064), the 
subject undergoes an additional total joint replacement surgery  or the site beco mes aware that 
an additional total joint replacement surgery  has been scheduled for the subject, the subject 
will be requested to provide information on the additional total joint replacement surgery  as 
well. Finally , any subject with a qualifying total j oint replacement after the last subject in the 
study  completes the treatment period in studies A4091059, A4091061 or A4091063 may be 
followed in this study  (A4091064). 
This study  is designed with a total duration of subject follow -up of 24 weeks after the total 
joint replacement surgery.  There will be two methods of data collection utilized in this 
study : interview b y site staff via the telephone and IWRSaccessed b y desktop, laptop or

of function and activ ity in the replaced joint (I WRS ) and phy sical rehabilitation activities 
(telephone interview ) will be made at Weeks 4, [ADDRESS_50363] 
been completed should be asked to complete all assessments scheduled for Week 24.
All events of total knee, h ip or shoulder replacement will be reviewed b y the Joint Safety 
Adjudication Committee (Adjudication Committee) established for the tanezumab clinical 
program.  This Committee will adjudicate in an independent and blinded fashion if the event 
is primary  osteonecrosis, worsening OA (further sub -divided into rapi[INVESTIGATOR_47571] 
[RPOA ]type1 or t ype2, normal progression of OA or not enough information to distinguish 
between RPOA and normal progression of OA), subchondral insufficiency  fracture, 
pathologic fracture, other (with diagnosis specified) or not enough information to specify  a 
diagnosis.  Prior to the Adjudication Committee’s review of a given event, Committee
members will be provided with blinded, available source documentatio n of progress report s 
from the i nvestigator, orthopedic consult reports, operative reports, the pathology  report from 
the central laboratory , radiology  reports, Dual Energ y X-ray Absorptiometry  (DXA ) reports, 
x-ray images and magnetic resonance images (MRI) for review.  Sites will be requested to 
submit required source documentation to the Endpoint Management Team as soon as 
possible and ideally  within 29 5days after the total joint replacement surgery  (ie, b y the 
time the Week 4 visit occurs). In addition, blinded summaries of the following data from the 
parent stud y (A4091056, A4091057, A4091058 or other studies) will be provided to the 
Committee members for review for each event undergoing adjudication : demographic and 
baseline characteristics, medical history  and concomitant medications, investigational 
product administration, non- drug treatments, subject disposition, efficacy  data, adverse event 
information, neurological safet y data and a serious adverse event narrative (if applicable).  
The Adjudication Committee, in c oordination with the Data Monitoring Committee
(E-D MC), is responsible for ongoing anal ysis of these outcomes and for informing the 
sponsor of recommendations made.

All female subjects who are of childbearing pote ntial and are sexuall y active and at risk for 
pregnancy ,and who withdraw from Study A4091056, A4091057 A409105 8, or other 
tanezumab study less than [ADDRESS_50365] agree to use two (2) methods of h ighly  effective contraception consistently  and 
correctly until 112 days (16 weeks) after the last dose of subcutaneous investigational 
product .  The investigator or his/ or her designee, in consultation with the subject, will 
confirm the subject has select ed the most appropriate forms of contraception for the 
individual subject from the permitted list of contraception methods (see below) , and instruct
the subject in their consistent and correct use.  Subjects need to affirm that they  meet the 
criteria for c orrect use of at least two of the selected methods of contraception.  The 
investigator or his/her designee will discuss with the subject the need to use highly  effective 
contraception consistently and correctl y according to the schedule of activities and d ocument 
such conversation in the subject’s chart.   In addition, the Investigator or his/ or her designee
will instruct the subject to call immediately  if the selected birth control method sare
discontinued or if pregnancy  is known or suspected in the subje ct.
Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and 
include:
1.Established use of oral, inserted, injected ,implan tedor transdermal hormonal 
methods of contraception isallowed provided the subject remains on the same 
treatment throughout the entire study  and has been using that hormonal contraceptive 
for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness.
2.Correctl y placed copper -containing intrauterine device (IUD). 
3.Male condom or female condom used WI TH a spermicide (ie, foam, gel, film, cream, 
or suppository ).For countries where spermicide is not available or condom plus 
spermicide is not accepted as highly  effective contraception, this option is not 
appropriate.

administering the I WRS or entering data into the IWRS are specificall y documented using 
the appropriate forms and are based on documented evidence of adequate traini ng in 
administration and use of th e IWRS.  The investigator (or other site staff specificall y 
delegated b y the investigator) is responsible for regular monitoring of the compliance of the 
subject s with the required data entry  by [CONTACT_47598] I WRS.  The I WRS will also 
be programmed to notify  designated site staff when data has not been recorded within the 
requested timeframe.   Regardless of how the i nvestigator delegates responsibility  for 
administering the I WRS or en tering data into the IWRS, the investigator remains responsible 
for providing adequate supervision and oversi ght of the i nvestigator’s colleagues, emplo yees 
and an y third parties as per FDA regulations and guidelines and Good Clinical Practice.
6.1.Baseline Visit
Baseline information for t his study  should be obtained as close as possible to, and prior to,

[IP_ADDRESS].1. WOMAC Pain Subscale
The WOMAC Pain subscale is comprised of 5 questions regarding the amount of pain 
experienced due to OA in the index joint (selected study knee or hip) in the past 48 hours. 
For this study, the index joint (selected study knee or hip) is defined as the joint to be or 
that has been replaced.  This may or may not have been the index joint in Study 
A4091056, A4091057 or A4091058.   The WOMAC Pain subscale is calculated as the mean 
of the scores from the five individual questions, which may not be a whole (integer) number.  
The WOMAC Pain subscale NRS scores for each question, and the WOMAC Pain subscale 
score, range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher pain.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. WOMAC Physical Function Subscale
The WOMAC Phy sical Function subscale is comprised of 17 questions regarding the degree 
of difficulty  experienced due to arthritis in the index joint (selected study  knee or hip) in the 
past 48 hours.  For th is study, the index joint (selected study knee or hip) is defined as 
the joint to be or that has been replaced.  This may or may not have been the index joint 
in Study A4091056, A4091057 or A4091058.  The WOMAC Phy sical Function subscale is 
calculated as t he mean of the scores from the seventeen individual questions, which may  not 
be a whole (integer) number.  The WOMAC Phy sical Function subscale NRS scores for each 
question, and the WOMAC Phy sical Function subscale score, range from [ADDRESS_50382] 's ability  to move around and 
perform usual activities of daily  living.
[IP_ADDRESS].3. WOMAC Stiffness Subscale
The WOMAC Stiffness subscale is comprised of 2 questions regarding the amount of

error CRF which is a specific version of the AEpage, and on the SAE form when 
appropriate.  In the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified 
immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error iscaptured on the medication erro r version of the AE page 
and, if applicable, any associated AE(s) are capt ured on an AE CRF page.
8.5.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AEare as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires addition al diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention ;
and/or

significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y;and/or
Test result is considered to be an AEby [CONTACT_4687].
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE.
8.6.Serious Adverse Events
Anserious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at an y dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Medical and scientific judgment isexercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical eve nt.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of d rug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.6.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events 
There are no protoco l-specified SAEs in this study . All SAEs will be reported by  [CONTACT_4688], and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y 
databas e (see the Section onSerious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements ) 
8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury 
Liver function tests ( LFTs) are not required as a routine safet y monitoring procedure in this 
study .  However, should an investigator deem it necessary  to run LFTs because of clinical 
sign/sy mptom presentation in a subject , such L FT results should be handled and followed up 
as described below.

Page 44Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin that meet the criteria outlined below in 
the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered potential cases of drug- induced 
liver injury  (potential Hy’s Law cases ) and should alway s be considered important medical 
events. 
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug- induced liver injury  
depends on the subject’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who 
present wi th the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:
Subjects with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range 
who subsequently  present wi th AST or AL T 3times the upper limit of normal 
(xULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin [ADDRESS_50386] with no evidence of hemoly sis 
and an alkaline phosphatase [ADDRESS_50387] or not available .
For subjects with preexisting AL TORAST ORtotal bilirubin values abov e the 
upper limit of normal, the following threshold values should be used in the definition 
mentioned above:
For subjects with pre -existing AST or AL T baseline values above the normal 
range: AST or ALT  2times the baseline values and  [ADDRESS_50388], or [ADDRESS_50389] 
(whichever is smaller).
Concurrent with
For subjects with pre -existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin level increased from baseline by [CONTACT_8895] 1x ULN
or3normal ULN (whichever is smaller).
The subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within [ADDRESS_50390] bilirubin, gamma -glutamy l transferase, prothrombin time (PT)/ international 
normalized ratio ( INR), and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed his tory, including relevant 
information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen , recreational drug and supplement 
consumption, family  history , occupational exposure, sexual history , travel history , history  of 
contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person , surgery , blood transfusion, history  of liver or allergic 
disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or 
C infection and liver imaging ( eg, biliary  tract) may  be warranted. All cases confirmed on 
repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria defined above , with no other cause for L FT 
abnormalities identified at the time should be considered potential Hy ’s Law cases 
irrespective of availability  of all the results of the investigations performed to determine 
etiology  of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy’s Law cases should be reported as SAEs.

Page 46Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as AEs .  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acu te appendicitis 
that begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.
8.8.Severity Assessment
If required on the AEcase report forms (CRFs) , the investigator will use the adjectives 
MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE.  For 
purposes of consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE .  For example, a headache may  be severe (inter feres significantly with 
subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAE s, listed above.
8.9.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
nonserious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements if 
applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of wheth er there 
exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an 
AE; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be 
provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not theinvestigational product caused 
the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting 
purposes, as defined b y the Sponsor (see the Section on Reporting Requirements ).  If t he 
investigator's causalit y assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational product", 
this should be clearl y documented on study records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines an SAE is associated with study  procedures, the 
investigator mu st record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.
8.10. Exposure During Pregnancy (EDP)
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  occurs if:
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having 
been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product; or the female be comes or is found to be pregnant after 
discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational product; 
Tanezumab
A4091064
Final Protocol Amendment 1, [ADDRESS_50391] in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2.A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to 
the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is 
exposed during his partner’s pr egnancy . 
If a stud y subject or study subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this 
information to the [COMPANY_007] Drug Safet y Unit on a nSAE report form and an EDP supplemental 
form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred .  In addition, the investigator must submit 
information regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a 
subject reports that she is pregnant and ha s been exposed to a cy totoxic product by  [CONTACT_8897][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EDP supplemental form .  This must be done irrespective of whether an 
AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information 
submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related 
to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDPreports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow t he pregnancy until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a follow up 
to the initial E DP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for 
termination should be specified and, if clinicall y possible, the structural integrity  of the 
terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless preprocedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscar riage and missed abortion.
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_50392] .
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  [CONTACT_093].  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm i nfants to identify  developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the study  subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information 
Form to deliver to his partner.  The Investigator must document in the source documents that 
the subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.

8.11. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet y unit within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE report form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE /SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , 
the information is not reported on a CRF; however, a copy  of the completed SAE report form 
is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.12. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See Also the Section on Subject
Withdrawal /Early Termination )
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on the appr opriate AECRF 
page. 
When a subject withdraws due to anSAE , the SAE must be reported in accordance with the 
reporting requirements defined below.
8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  reported b y 
the study  subject .  In addition, each study  subject will be questioned about AEs.
8.14. Reporting Requirements
Each AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAE s.  If a nSAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow loca l and international regulations, as appropriate.
8.14.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If anSAE occurs, [COMPANY_007] is to be notified within [ADDRESS_50394] be made 
immediately , irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation.  This time frame also 
applies to additional new information (follow- up) on previously  forwarded SAE reports as 
well as to the initial and follow- up reporting of EDP, exposure via breastfeeding cases and 
occuptational exposure cases.

Page 49In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a nSAE
immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  subject initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the
investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time 
of his/her first awareness of the AE .
For all SAE s, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to [COMPANY_007] in 
accordance with the time frames for reporting specified above.  In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by  [CONTACT_4695] -up information in an 
expedited fashion.  This i nformation collected for SAE sismore detailed than that captured 
on the AE CRF .  In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causality .  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided.  I n the case of a subject death, a 
summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its 
designated representative. 
8.14.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requireme nts
All AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF.  I t should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AECRF.  Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For examp le, the same AE
term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.
8.14.3. Sponsor ’sReporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
Adverse event reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodolog y for the summary  and descriptive analyses of the data collected in this 
study  will be documented in a Statistical Analy sis Plan, which will be maintained by  [CONTACT_103].  This document may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any  major 
modifications of the planned anal yses will also be reflected in a protoco l amendment.
9.1.Sample Size Determination
This study  is designed to collect information sufficient to describe the post -operative 
outcome of subject s who underwent a total knee, hip, or shoulder replacement while 
participating in tanezumab Study  A4091056, A4091057 or A4091058 (treatment or safet y

11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject .  The completed

third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
author ities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they  are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  [CONTACT_47616]. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source

these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigat ivesite as well as at [COMPANY_007] and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or [COMPANY_007], the investigator
agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating subject s (sufficient 
information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed 
consent documents , copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety  reporting forms, source docume nts, and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence ( eg,letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be 
retained b y the investigator according to the ICH guidelines, local re gulations, or as specified 
in the Clinical Study  Agreement (CSA) , whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period ( eg,retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007] , such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to an independent third part y arranged by [CONTACT_4618]. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_50402] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institu tional Review Board /Ethics Committee 
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, 
eg, recruitment advertisements, if applic able, from the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] I RB/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007]. The investigator should also receive the approval from the national 
competent authorit y befo re implementing a substantial amendment.
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject s.  In 
that event, the investigator must n otify  the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
Tanezumab
A4091064
Final Protocol Amendment 1, [ADDRESS_50403] of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences 2002), Guidelines for GCP (ICH 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World 
Medical Association 1996 and 2008). 
In addition, the study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the ICHguideline 
on GCP , and applicable local regulatory  requirements and laws.
12.3. Subject Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of subject personal data and will not include subjectnames 
or other identifiable data in any reports, publications, or other disclosures, except where
required b y laws.
When study  data are compi[INVESTIGATOR_47581], s ubject
names, address es, and other identifiable data will be replaced b y a numerical code based on a 
numbering sy stem provided by  [CONTACT_47617] -identify  study subject s.The study  site 
will maintain a confidential list of subjects who participated in the study , linking each 
subject’s numerical code to his or her actual identity . In case of data transfer, [COMPANY_007] will 
maintain high standards of confidentialit y and protection of subject s’personal data consistent 
with applicable privacy  laws .
The informed consent document must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory  
requirements, and legal requirements , including applicable privacy  laws .
The informed consent document( s) used during the informed consent process must be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_456], approved by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC before use , and av ailable for 
inspection.
The investigator mus t ensure that each study  subject , or his/her legal ly acceptable
representative, is fully  informed about the nature and objectives of the study  and possible 
risks associated with participation. 
Whenever consent is obtained from a subject’s legally  acceptable representative , the 
subject’s assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the subject has 
the capacity to provide assent, as determined by  [CONTACT_941] I RB/EC.  If the investigator determines 
that a subject’s decisional capacit y is so limited he/she cannot reasonabl y be consulted, then, 
as permitted b y the IRB/EC and consistent with local regulatory  and legal requirements, the 
subject’s assent may  be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not 
obtained.  If the stud y subject does not provide his or her own consent, the source documents 
must record wh y the subject did not provide consent (eg, minor, decisionally impaired adult), 
how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the subject’s legall y 
acceptable representative, the consent signer’s relationship to the study  subject (eg, parent, 
spouse) , and that the subject’s assent was obtained, or waived.  If assent is obtained verball y 
it must be documented i n the source documents.

12.4. Subject Recruitment
Subject recruitment efforts are not required for this study  because this is an observational 
extension study . 
12.5. Reporting of Safety Issues and S erious B reaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
competent authorit y in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of any  new 
information thatmight influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational 
product, [COMPANY_007] should be informed immediately. 
In addition, the investigator will inform [COMPANY_007] immediately  of any  urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investiga tor to protect the study  subject s against an y immed iate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.
13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
13.1. End of Trial in a Member State 
End of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is 
deemed that sufficient number of subjects have been recruited and completed the study  as 
stated in the regulatory  application (i e,clinical trial application (CTA)) and ethics application 
in the Member State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than t he anticipated number in the 
CTA) by  a Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a 
normal conclusion to the study  in that Member State.
13.2. End of Trial in A ll Other Participating Countries 
End of Trial in all other participatin g countries is defined as database lock.
14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study  may  occur because of a regulatory  authority  decision, 
change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/EC, or investigational product safety  problems, or at the 
discr etion of [COMPANY_007].  In addition, [COMPANY_007] retains the right to discontinue development of
tanezumab at an y time.
If a stud y is prematurel y terminated or discontinued, P fizer will promptly  notify  the 
investigator .  After notification, the investigator must cont act all participating subject s and 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4601]  (if applicable) within 1week .  As directed b y [COMPANY_007], all study  
materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.

Final Protocol Amendment 1, [ADDRESS_50410] agree to use one (1) method of highly  effective contraception consistently  and 
correctly  until 112 days (16 weeks) after the last dose of subcutaneous investigational 
product .  The investigator or his/or her designee, in consultation with the subject, will 
confirm the subject has selected the most appropriate form of contraception for the individual 
subject from the permitted list of contraception methods (see below) , and instruct the subject
in itsconsistent and correct use.  Subjects need to affirm that they  meet the criteria for correct 
use of the selected method of contraception.  The investigator or his/her designee will discuss 
with the subject the need to use highly  effective contraception consistentl y and correctly 
according to the schedule of activities and document such conversation in the subject’s chart.  
In addition, the Investigator or his/ or her designee will instruct the subject to call 
immediately  if the selected birth control met hodsarediscontinued or if pregnancy  is known 
or suspected in the subject .
Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfe ct use) and 
include the following:
1.Established use of hormonal methods of contraception is allowed provided the subject 
remains on the same treatment throughout the entire study  and has been using that 
hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness.  
Acceptable methods include:
Combined (estrogen and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation:
Oral
Intravaginal
Transdermal
Progestogen-onl y hormonal contraception associated with inhib ition of

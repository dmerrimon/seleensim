Background
Accurately quantifying food intake is vital to promoting health and reducing chronic 
disease risk. Food intake encompasses energy intake, nutrient intake (macronutrients, 
micronutrients, vitamins, minerals), and intake of various food groups (e.g., fruits, 
vegetables), and thus reflects the nutritional status of individuals. Nutrition affects 
disease risk, including risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_139430], [ADDRESS_830009] the [LOCATION_002] (U.S). Nonetheless, accurate assessment of food 
and nutrient intake has remained challenging, despi[INVESTIGATOR_623279]. Self-
report methods, namely food records, are a mainstay of nutritional epi[INVESTIGATOR_623280], [ADDRESS_830010] been comprehensively outlined. 10 As a result, there remains a 
significant need for methods that are sufficiently accurate to provide researchers with 
good outcome data and to guide health promotion efforts. 
The PortionSize™ app was designed by [CONTACT_623283], and to guide users to follow specific diets. PortionSize relies on users 
capturing images of their food selection and waste. Food intake data are immediately 
provided since the user relies on built in tools, including templates, to estimate portion 
size. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_623281], the PortionSize app has yet to be 
fully validated. Determining the accuracy of PortionSize is vital before users can utilize 
the app to obtain immediate feedback about their food intake. We accordingly aim to 
test the validity of PortionSize during two buffet meals in a controlled laboratory setting 
and compare this to another app that has been adopted widely - MyFitnessPal©, which 
is an electronic food record.
Methods
Study Design
We will recruit adults to use the PortionSize app or the MyFitnessPal during laboratory-
based simulated meals.
Participants and Recruitment
We will recruit 43 adults (approximately equal proportion of men and women) who will 
be randomly assigned in approximately a 1:[ADDRESS_830011] visit 
(and MyFitnessPal at the second visit), or MyFitnessPal at the first visit (and PortionSize 
Pennington Biomedical IRB FWA 00006218
Approved December 3, 2020
at the second visit). We expect to enroll an approximately equal number of participants 
with body mass indexes (BMI; kg/m2) between 18.5 to 25; 25 to 30; and 30 – 50kg/m2.  
Recruitment will be stratified based on sex and body mass index.
Inclusion criteria include:
oMale or female, age 18-70 years
oBody mass index (BMI) 18.5-50 kg/m2
oOwnership of an iPhone model 6s or later, which the participant is willing 
to use for the study
oAccess to Apple ID, password, and email address and willing to use them 
in the course of the study
oWilling to use data and any accompanying charges as part of study 
participation
oWilling to be re-contact[CONTACT_623284]/or follow-up
Exclusion criteria include 
oCenter employee, as previous reviewers argued that they are not 
representative of the community 
oAny condition or circumstance that could impede study completion
Procedures
Screening visit/Study Visit 1
In the screening visit, written informed consent will initially be obtained. We will then 
obtain:
Demographics: age, race, ethnicity, sex, employment, income, marital status, 
education level (Appendix A: Lifestyle, Demographics, and Health Questionnaire)
Anthropometrics: height, weight, and BMI
On being deemed eligible, in this within subjects design, participants will be randomized 
to use either PortionSize or my MyFitnessPal at this first visit, with the other app being 
used at the second visit. They will receive training on the app that they will use that day 
to subsequently rate a meal. Training will span up to ~45 minutes. 
Participants will then estimate food intake from a simulated lunch meal; i.e., they will not 
eat food during the meals. The meal will consist of at least three foods, one calorie 
containing beverage, and may contain a vitamin and/or supplement. Participants’ 
energy requirements will be calculated using sex-specific formulas. Energy 
requirements will be multiplied by 1.[ADDRESS_830012] meal 
will include 30% of this value, which represents a typi[INVESTIGATOR_623282]. Plate waste will be 
determined at the individual food item level and will range between 0% and 100%, but 
the distribution will be skewed to the lower end such that mean plate waste is ~5% of 
foods provided, which is slightly higher than actual plate waste from our free-living data 
Pennington Biomedical IRB FWA 00006218
Approved December 3, 2020
(~3%). 11 Simulated food provision and plate waste will be covertly weighed, and 
simulated food intake calculated by [CONTACT_263567]. 
When participants use PortionSize, they will be instructed to use PortionSize to estimate 
food provision and plate waste. PortionSize will then calculate food intake, with energy 
intake being the primary outcome variable. PortionSize will also transfer the food 
images to the Food Photography Application for expert rater analysis, and these are 
secondary outcome data. When participants use MyFitnessPal, they will enter estimated 
food intake into the app.
Near the end of the visit where participants used the MyFitnessPal app, they will 
complete the MyFitnessPal User Satisfaction Survey (Appendix B) and the 
MyFitnessPal Computer System Usability Questionnaire (MyFitnessPal CSUQ) 
(Appendix C) to quantify satisfaction and ease of use of the MyFitnessPal app. The 
CSUQ is a standardized, reliable, and valid questionnaire originally designed to 
evaluate computer programs12,13 that has been used to quantify the usability of mobile 
phone apps.14,15 Similarly, at the end of the visit where they used the PortionSize app, 
they will complete the PortionSize User Satisfaction Survey (Appendix D), as well as the 
PortionSize CSUQ (Appendix E). Additionally, only after the visit that includes the 
PortionSize app, participants will complete a modified version of a self-administered 
food frequency questionnaire (Appendix F, Diet History Questionnaire, Version 3.0 or 
the DHQ-III).[ADDRESS_830013] meal. Thus, only those items 
(vitamins and supplements) of the DHQ-III will be administered, and the instructions will 
ask participants to note if those items were present in the test meal. 
Study Visit [ADDRESS_830014] visit. They will then estimate food intake from another simulated 
lunch meal. This will be conducted exactly as Study Visit 1. Participants will then 
complete either the PortionSize User Satisfaction Survey or the MyFitnessPal User 
Satisfaction Survey, depending on which app they used during Study Visit 2. They will 
also complete either the PortionSize CSUQ or the MyFitnessPal CSUQ. 
Participants then will complete an the User Preference Survey (Appendix G) to 
determine which app (PortionSize or MyFitnessPal) they prefer, think is most accurate, 
etc. 
Outcome measures
The primary analyses assessing equivalence between PortionSize and the criterion 
measures (and MyFitnessPal and the criterion measures), will rely on equivalence 
testing using the Two One-side T-test (TOST)17,18 method. The criterion measure is 
directly weighed foods from the simulated lunch meal. Differences in the observed error 
from PortionSize and MyFitnessPal will be compared with dependent t-tests, with error 
calculated as the difference between each experimental method and the criterion 
variable (e.g., energy intake values from PortionSize minus energy intake values from 
Pennington Biomedical IRB FWA 00006218
Approved December 3, 2020
weighed foods). These procedures will also produce results indicating if the error from 
each method differs from zero. Subsequent regression-based exploratory analyses 
will determine if error from the apps varies by [CONTACT_482712] (kg, BMI), age, or sex; and will 
evaluate differences in user satisfaction and preference between the apps. Bland-
Altman analysis19 will be used to test for differences in error variance over levels of the 
variable being measured (e.g., food intake).
Thus, primary endpoints will be:
Energy intake (kcal)
User satisfaction and usability of the app 
Secondary endpoints will be:
Nutrients (e.g., fat, carbohydrate, and protein) and food groups (PortionSize only) 
intake 
oOnly PortionSize has the ability to provide output in food groups due to the 
link with the FNDDS database.  
Exploratory endpoints include the modified Dietary History Questionnaire (DHQ) as a 
comparator for the possible dietary supplement. This specific addition was not an 
outcome included in the grant and was added post award.

Power calculation
We will recruit 43 participants and we are powered even if we experience attrition of up 
to 10%, resulting in 39 participants finishing both visits. Estimated food intake values 
form the PortionSize (and MyFitnessPal) will be compared to directly weighed values. 
Equivalence tests that follow the Two One-sided T-test (TOST)17,18 method will be used 
with alpha = 0.05 and specified acceptable lower and upper bounds of equivalence 
(error reflects the difference between weighed intake and estimates from either 
PortionSize or MyFitnessPal). Equivalence is set as within ± 6% of the directly weighed 
value. With as few as [ADDRESS_830016] equivalence with ±6% error bounds 
(±35.2 kcal). Additionally, with [ADDRESS_830017] a 46 kcal difference in error 
(effect size = 0.6) between the conditions. Finally, with [ADDRESS_830018] R2 > 0.16.[ADDRESS_830019].
Withdrawal of Subjects
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study if he/she misses study visits and will be 
notified of their withdrawal via telephone or mail. If a subject voluntarily withdraws from 
the study, no additional data will be collected and they will be considered dropouts in 
the study.
Risks to Subjects
This study involves no greater than minimal risk. The main risk is breach of 
confidentiality, and the PBRC team will work to minimize this during data collection, 
handling, and analysis.  
Potential Benefits to Subjects
Participants may benefit by [CONTACT_623285]. 
Sharing of Results with Subjects
The participants may receive information such as body weight and anthropometrics. 
Those results will be provided to the participant at the end of the study if requested.

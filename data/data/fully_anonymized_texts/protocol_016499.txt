2   SYNOPSIS  
Objectives : 
Secondary Objectives (analyzed hierarchically)  
4. Evaluate the effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the diplopia responder rate 
(i.e., the percentage of subjects with baseline diplopia > [ADDRESS_946469] a 
reduction of ≥ 1 grade with no corresponding deterioration [≥ 1 grade worsening] in 
the fellow eye) at Week  24. 
5.4. Evaluate the effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the mean change from Baseline to 
Week 24 in the Graves’ Ophthalmopathy Quality of Life (GO-QoL) questionnaire overall 
score.  
Study Design:  
At the end of the double- masked Treatment Period (Week 24), subjects who are proptosis 
non-responders (study eye has < 2 mm decrease in proptosis) will be eligible to enter an open -
label extension study (HZNP- TEP-302) in which subjects may receive up to  8 infusions of 
teprotumumab (10 mg/kg for the first infusion and 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions) in an 
open-label fashion.  
Subjects who complete the Week [ADDRESS_946470] will  be questioned regarding type of treatment and 
outcome/response.

* Infusion of study drug.  
1. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (stratified by [CONTACT_697310]) to receive:  
a. Teprotumumab 20 mg/kg (10 mg/kg on Day 1 followed by 20 mg/kg q3W for the remaining 7 infusions); or 
b. Placebo (placebo q3W for all 8 infusions).  
2. Visit windows are ± 1 day for Weeks 1 and 4, ± 3 days for Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21, and ± [ADDRESS_946471] to participate in the open- label extension study will enter a 48 -week 
Follow -Up Period. Subjects who are responders at Week 24 but relapse during the Follow -Up Period may enter the open- label study and receive 
up to 8 infusions if they meet specified  criteria.  
4. Visit windows of ± [ADDRESS_946472]. 
65. Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_3012]/email the day following the first and second infusions for safety and tolerability assessments; phone/email 
contacts will also occur the day after any clinic visit where a subject experiences an infusion- related adverse event . 
76. Subjects who are proptosis  non-responders at Week 24 of the double- masked Treatment Period will be offered the option to enter an open -label 
extension study and receive up to 8 additional  infusions of teprotumumab 20 mg/kg (10 mg/kg on Day 1 followed by 20 mg/kg for the remaining 
7 infusions  all subsequent doses ). 
Inclusion Criteria : 
10. Women of childbearing potential (including those with an onset of menopause <2 years 
prior to Screening, non-therapy-induced amenorrhea for <12 months prior to Screening, or 
not surgically sterile [absence of ovaries and/or uterus]) must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and negative urine pregnancy tests at all protocol- specified 
timepoints (i.e., prior to each dose and through Week 48 of the Follow- Up Period); subjects 
who are sexually active with a non- vasectomized male partner must agree to use 
[ADDRESS_946473] dose of study drug. Highly effective contraceptive methods (with a failure rate less than 1% per year), when used consistently and correctly, includes implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner.   
11.  Male subjects must be surgically sterile or , if sexually active with a female partner of 
childbearing potential,  must agree to use a barrier contraceptive method from Screening 
through [ADDRESS_946474] dose of study drug.  
Dose Regimen/Route of Administration:  
The infusion rate may be reduced and the dose may be interrupted or held based on tolerability (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2
 for details). The first and second infusions will be administered over 
approximately 90 minutes (but not less than 80 minutes).  Subsequent infusions will be

 administered over a approximately 60 minute s (but not less than 50 minutes), period 
providing there are no significant infusion- associated events.  
Duration of Treatment and Follow- up: 
Subjects who complete the Week [ADDRESS_946475].    
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_567146] (measured as exophthalmos evaluation of the Clinical 
Measures of Severity using a Hertel instru ment provided by [CONTACT_697311]), CAS (7 -item scale), diplopia (measured as part of the Clinical Measures of 
Severity),  and C linical Measures of Severity (including motility restriction assessments).  
Statistical Analyses  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints (analyzed hierarchically): 
4. The effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the diplopia responder rate 
(percentage of subjects with baseline diplopia > [ADDRESS_946476] a reduction of 
≥ 1 grade with no corresponding deterioration [≥ 1 grade worsening] in the fellow eye) 
at Week 24.  
5.4. The effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the mean change from Baseline to Week  24 
in the GO- QoL questionnaire overall score.  
Statistical Analysis of Efficacy Parameters : 
The primary analyses will be conducted in the Intent- to-Treat (ITT) population. The analysis of 
the primary proptosis responder endpoint will assess risk difference (difference in response 
rates) in a stratified analysis.  The analysis will use  Cochran- Mant el-Haenszel (CMH) 
weighting to estimate the common risk difference within strata and to estimate the 
standard error of the common risk difference . be a logistic regression with treatment group as 
the model effect . Subjects missing the Week 24 evaluation wi ll be considered to be treatment 
failures (non -responders) for the primary analysis. Further, subjects who prematurely 
discontinue study drug dosing prior to Week 21 during the double -masked Treatment 
Period will be considered to be treatment failures (non -responders), unless an assessment 
at Week 24 is available. Stratification for the analysis will use the same factor as was used 
to stratify randomization, tobacco use (non- user, user). Since tobacco use status (non user vs. 
user) is used to stratify the r andomization, it will be included as a categorical covariate . The 
difference in response rates , comparing teprotumumab to placebo, will be estimated Odds 
ratio comparing teprotumumab to placebo will be estimated  along with the corresponding 95% 
confidence interval (CI) and p- value.  
An analysis of risk difference with stratification  by [CONTACT_697312] (non- user vs. user)  Logistic 
regression will also be used to analyze the 32 secondary categorical endpoints (overall responder 
rate, CAS [value of 0 or 1] and diplopia responder rate) . For the analysis of proptosis as a 
continuous secondary endpoint and GO-QoL, a Mixed- Model Repeated -Measures (MMRM) 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be fit to the individual change fro m baseline

[IP_ADDRESS] Determination of Dose Volume  
The volume of study drug to be administered will be determined by [CONTACT_89931] (IWRS) and will be based on the subject’s weight. The first dose will be 10 mg/kg, and 
subsequent doses will be 20 mg/kg. Weight will be measured at Screening and Weeks [ADDRESS_946497] the 
dose beginning at Week 12 or Week 15, as appropriate. and the dose may be adjusted at Week 
12, as appropriate.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_946498] and second IV infusions on Day 1 and Week 3 will be administered over approximately 90 minutes (but not less than 80 minutes)  for all subjects; subsequent infusions 
may be administered over a shorter time period ( approximately 60 minutes , but not less than 
50 minutes ) in the absence of any infusion- associated events. All subjects will be monitored for 
AEs from the start of infusion through [ADDRESS_946499] 3 doses; the monitoring period for subsequent doses may be reduced to 30 minutes after infusion completion for subjects who do not experience infusion- associated events.

Following the appearance of either immediate or delayed infusion- associated events, subsequent 
doses may  be pre-treated with diphenhydramine (1 to 1.25 mg/kg IV; maximum of 50 mg), 
ranitidine (50 mg IV), famotidine (0.5 mg/kg IV), dexamethasone (0.4 mg/kg IV; maximum of 
20 mg), and/or acetaminophen (500 mg). All subsequent infusions will be administered over approximately 90 minute s (but not less than 80 minutes)  period with vital signs monitored 
every 15 minutes from the start of the infusion through 60 minutes after infusion completion. 
9.5.1 Efficacy Variables  
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_567146] (measur ed as exophthalmos evaluation of the Clinical 
Measures of Severity using a Hertel instrument provided by [CONTACT_697317]), CAS  (7-item scale), diplopia (measured as part of the Clinical Measures of 
Severity) and Clinical Measures of Severity (including motility restriction assessments).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature) will be measured at 
all clinic visits. Vital signs will be measured pre - and post -infusion on Day  [ADDRESS_946500]’s arm 
unconstrained by [CONTACT_697318]. When 
possible, the same arm will be used for measurements in all study visits. Temperature will be 
obtained oral ly or via the ear.

 9.6.3 Primary and Secondary Endpoint Analysis  
The primary analyses will be conducted in the ITT population. The analysis of the primary 
proptosis responder endpoint will assess risk difference (difference in response rates) in a 
stratified analysis.  The analysis will use  Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) weighting to 
estimate the common risk difference within strata and to estimate the standard error of the 
common risk difference . be a logistic regression with treatment group as the model effect. 
Subjects missing the Week 24 evaluation will be considered to be treatment failures (non- responders) for the primary analysis. Further, subjects who prematurely discontinue 
study drug dosing prior to Week 21 during the double -masked Treatment Period will be 
considered to be treatment failures (non -responders), unless an assessment at Week 24 is 
available. Stratification for the analysis will use the same factor as was used to stratify 
randomization, tobacco use (non- user, user).  Since tobacco use status (non user vs. user) is 
used to stratify the randomization, it will be included as a categorical covariate . The difference 
in response rates , comparing teprotumumab to placebo, will be estimated  Odds ratio 
comparing teprotumumab to placebo will be estimated along with the corresponding 95% 
confidence interval (CI) and p- value.  
An analysis of risk difference with stratification  by [CONTACT_697312] (non- user vs. user)  Logistic 
regression will also be used to analyze the 32 secondary categorical endpoints. For the analysis of 
proptosis and GO- QoL (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for details) as continuous secondary endpoints, a 
Mixed -Model Repeated- Measures (MMRM) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be 
fit to the individual change from baseline scores for the study eye , with terms in the model 
being the baseline score, tobacco use status, treatment group, visit, and the visit-by- treatment an d 
visit-by-baseline -score interactions. The main focus of the analysis will be to test the treatment 
differences at Week 24, with the main results consisting of the Week [ADDRESS_946504] Square (LS) means and their differences with 95% CI s and p-value s. 
To control the overall Type [ADDRESS_946505] placebo at the

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Measures of Severity  
The C linical Measures of Severity  results (see Table 9.3) for each item will be summarized at 
each designated  visit for each eye with the number and percentage of subjects being classified as 
responders on each individual criterion. The proportions of responders will be analyzed using the 
same risk difference method described for the primary endpoint a Chi square test in 
Section  9.6.3 .

 Study Design:  
This is a randomized, double -masked , placebo -controlled, parallel -group,  multicenter study. Subjects will b e 
screened for the study within 2 to 6 weeks prior to the Baseline (Day 1) Visit. A pproximately 76 subjects 
(38/group) who meet the study eligibility criteria will be randomized on Day 1 in a 1:1 ratio (stratified by 
[CONTACT_697314] ) to receive 8 infusions of teprotumumab (10 mg/kg for the first infusion  and 20 mg/kg  for the 
remaining 7 infusions ) or placebo q3W . All s ubjects will enter a 24-week double -masked  Treatment Period, 
during which study drug will be infused on Day 1 (Baseline ), and Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21  (with a final 
visit at Week 24) . All study drug dosing will be performed at the clinic under the supervision of clinic staff , and 
at any scheduled infusion, the infusion rate may be reduced or the dose may be interr upted or held based on 
decreased tolerability  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2  for details) . On each dosing day, scheduled assessments (except for 
adverse event [AE] and concomitant medication use monitoring, which will be monitored throughout the clinic 
visit) will be completed prior to study drug dosing. After each of the first 2 infusions, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_89725]/email the following day and will return to the clinic 1 week after the infusion (Weeks 1 and 4) for 
safety and tolerability assessments; additional phone/email contacts and clinic visits may also be conducted for any subject experiencing an infusion -associated event.  
At the end of the double -masked  Treatment Period (Week 24), subjects who are proptosis  non-responders (study 
eye has < 2 mm decrease in proptosis)  will be eligible to enter an open -label extension study (HZNP -TEP-302) 
in which subjects may receive 8 infusions of teprotumumab (10 mg/kg for the first infusion and 20 mg/kg for 
the remaining 7 infusions) in an open -label fashion.   
At Week 24, proptosis  responders , as well as non -responders who choose not to enroll in the open -label 
extension study (HZNP -TEP-302), will enter a 48-week Follow -Up Period , during which study drug will not be 
administered and clinic visits are scheduled for Weeks  28, 36, 48, 60, and 72 (Months 7, 9, 12, 15, and 18 ). 
Subjects who are considered responders at Week 24 but who meet criteria for re- treatment due to relapse during 
the Follow -Up Period may enroll in the open- label extension study, HZNP -TEP- 302 (see  Secti on 9.3.4 ). 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing prior to Week [ADDRESS_946512] will 
be questioned regarding type of treatment and outcome/response.

considered proptosis  non-responders at Week 24 or subjects who were responders at Week 24 but who meet 
criteria for re -treatment due to relapse during the Follow -Up Period may enroll in the open- label extension 
study , HZNP -TEP- 302 (see  Section 9.3.4 ). 
At Week 24, proptosis  responders , as well as non -responders who choose not to enroll in the open -label 
extension study, will enter a 48-week Follow -Up Period.  
Subjects who complete the Week [ADDRESS_946527].  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
The most sever ely affected eye will be defined as the "study eye" at the Baseline ( Day 1) Visit. If there is a 
discrepancy between CAS and proptosis in determining the study eye, this will be adjudicated always to the eye 
Horizon Pharma  [LOCATION_003], Inc.  Teprotumumab (HZN -001) IND: 112952 
Date: 31 January 2019                          Protocol: HZNP -TEP-[ADDRESS_946528] significant proptosis. If both eye s are affected equally, the Investigator will choose the “study 
eye”. Both eyes will be assessed for efficacy but the study eye will be used to assess the primary outcome 
measure.  
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_567146] (measured as exophthalmos evaluation of the Clinical Measures of 
Severity  using a Hertel instrument provided by [CONTACT_697317] ), CAS  (7-item 
scale), diplopia ( measured as part of the Clinical Measures of Severity),  and Clinical Measures of Severity 
(including motility restriction assessments ).  
Quality of life will be assessed using the GO-QoL questionnaire. 
Blood samples for teprotumumab PK assessment will be collected prior to , and at the end of, the infusion on 
Day 1 and W eeks 3 and 9 during the Treatment Pe riod; in addition, single sample s will be collected at Weeks 1, 
4, and 24. PK/PD relationships will be explored.  
Serum  samples may be analyzed for biomarkers (IL -4, IL -6, IL -10, IL -12, IL -13, IL -17, IL -23, IL -1β,  sIL-1RA, 
INFγ, TGFβ, TNF α,  and micRNA) and possibly functional thyroid stimulating hormone r eceptor stimulating, 
blocking, and binding antibody (TSH -R-Ab) during the Treatment Period.  Based on the results of the above 
assays, other similar serum biomarkers may be assayed to further explore drug  and disease mechanisms.  
Safety will be assessed via AE and concomitant medication use monitoring, immunogenicity testing, physical 
and oph thalmic examinations, vital signs, clinical safety laboratory evaluations (complete blood count, 
chemistry (including  thyroid panel and HbA1 c), and urinalysis), pregnancy testing (if applicable), and 
electrocardiograms  (ECG) . The study will also be monitored by a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  
Statistical Analyses : 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary outcome measure is the effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the proptosis  responder rate 
(percentage of subjects with a ≥ 2 mm reduction from Baseline in proptosis in the study eye, without 
deterioration [≥ 2 mm increase] of proptosis in the fellow eye)  at Week 24 . 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  (analyzed hierarchically ) 
1. The effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the overall  responder rate (percentage of subjects with 
≥ 2-point  reduction  in CAS AND  ≥ 2 mm reduction in proptosis  from Baseli ne, provided there is no 
corresponding deterioration [≥ 2-point/mm increase] in CAS or proptosis in the fellow eye) at 
Week  24. 
2. The effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the percentage of subjects with a CAS value of [ADDRESS_946529] of teprotumumab versus placebo on the diplopia responder rate (percentage of subjects with 
baseline diplopia > [ADDRESS_946530] a reduction of ≥ 1 grade with no corresponding 
deterioration [≥ 1 grade worsening] in the fellow eye) at Week  24. 
5. The effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the mean change from Baseline to Week [ADDRESS_946531] of teprotumumab versus placebo on the overall responder rate at Week 24 stratified by [CONTACT_697320] (high responders, responders, low responders,  and non- responders).  
4. To evaluate the PK parameters of teprotumumab to estimate exposure and understand the PK- PD 
relationships.

Date: 31 January 2019                          Protocol: HZNP -TEP-[ADDRESS_946532] of teprotumumab versus placebo on the mean change from Baseline to Week 24 on the motility component  of the C linical Measures of Severity . 
Statistical Analysis on Efficacy Parameters  
The primary analyses will be conducted in the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population. The analysis of the primary 
proptosis  responder endpoint will assess risk difference (differe nce in response rates) in a stratified analysis. The 
analysis will use Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) weighting to estimate the common risk difference within 
strata and to estimate the standard error of the common risk difference. Subjects missing the Week 24 evaluation 
will be considered to be treatment failures (non-respo nders) for the primary analysis. Further, subjects who 
prematurely discontinue study drug dosing prior to Week 21 during the double -masked Treatment Period will be 
considered  to be  treatme nt failures (non -responders), unless an assessment at Week 24 is available.  Stratification 
for the analysis will use the same factor as was used to stratify  randomization, tobacco use (non -user, user). The 
difference in response rate s, comparing teprotumumab to placebo, will be estimated along with the 
corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) and p- value.  
An analysis of risk difference with stratification  by [CONTACT_697312] (non- user vs. user) will also be used to analyze 
the 3 secondar y categorical endpoints  (overall responder rate , CAS [value of 0 or 1]  and diplopia responder 
rate). For the analysis of proptosis as a continuous secondary endpoint  and GO- QoL, a Mixed -Model Repeated -
Measures (MMRM) analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) model w ill be fit to the individual change from baseline 
scores  for the study eye , with terms in the model being the baseline score, tobacco use status, treatment group, 
visit, and the visit- by-treatment and visit -by-baseline -score interactions. The main focus of  the analysis will be 
to test the treatment differences at Week 24, with the main results consisting of the Week [ADDRESS_946533] Square (LS) means and their differences with 95% CI s and p- value s. 
To control the overall Type [ADDRESS_946534] placebo at the 0.05 level only if teprotumumab was statistically 
significant for the outcome measure preceding it in the hierarchical order.  
Sample Size Estimate : 
In the prior TED01RV  study, a 51% difference (71% vs 20%) in proptosis reduction of 2  mm or more  between 
teprotumumab (10 mg/kg for the first infusion followed by 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions) and placebo 
was observed at Week [ADDRESS_946535] s per group provides 90% 
power  at the 2-sided alpha 0.[ADDRESS_946536] a difference of 39% between teprotumumab and placebo; the 
sample size has been adjusted to allow for a 1 6% discontinuation rate .

levels < 50% above or below the normal limits). Every effort should be made to correct the mild hypo- or hyperthyroidism promptly and to maintain the euthyroid state for the 
full dura tion of the clinical trial.  
26. HbA1 c must be < 9.0% for randomization. If the HbA1 c is elevated  and considered clinically significant  at any time point after S creening, it will be repeated approximately 
every [ADDRESS_946543] tests positive for NAb,  he/she will be 
followed until levels either revert to Baseline or the subject’s value decreases or remains stable. Any subject with a positive NAb test at Week 72 (or PW) during the 
Follow-Up Period will continue to be followed  until the subject’s value decreases or remains stable . 
28. Not collected for subjects who prematurely discontinue from the Treatment Period.  
29. Adverse events (AEs) that occur within 2 weeks prior to Day 1 and prior to dosing on Day 1 will be considered baseline signs/symptoms. Adverse events occurring or 
worsening after the dose on Day 1 through the end of the Treatment Period will be considered treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs). Adverse events occurring or worsening 
during the Follow -Up Period will be considered postdose AEs. All SAEs that occur from the signing of informed consent through 30 days after study discontinuation will be 
recorded.

response targeting orbital soft tissues; and “inactive TED,” which is the name [CONTACT_697361]. Active TED typi[INVESTIGATOR_34607] [ADDRESS_946561] the permanent pathology of inactive TED [ Burch et al, 1993]. 
The annual incidence rate of TED in the US has been estimated to be 16 cases per 100,000 people for women and 2.9 cases per 100,000 people for men [ Bartley, 1994]. The incidence 
appears to be comparable in Europe [ Abraham-Nordling et al, 2011; Mostbeck et al, 1998; Noth 
et al, 2001 ; Tanda et al, 2013]. Patients aged between [ADDRESS_946562] frequently 
affected, with severe cases more frequent in those older than 50 years [Dickinson, 2010]. The 
occurrence and severity  of TED is associated with smoking [ Prummel et al, 1993]. 
A mounting body of evidence in the scientific literature indicates that the pathophysiology of active TED involves the autoimmune activation and proliferation of orbital fibroblasts [Bahn, 
2010; Boschi et al, 2005; Smith, 2010] . The activation of fibroblasts triggers release of 
inflammatory cytokines, infiltration of immune cells into orbital soft tissues (muscle, interstitial and adipose), excessive synthesis of extracellular matrix, and tissue expansion and remodeling (ibid). Clinical features of moderate -to-severe TED include orbital pain, swelling, dry eye, 
redness and discomfort of the lids and ocular surface, thickening and retraction of the eyelids, and proptosis (exophthalmos) due to the expansion of tissue behind the eye [ Bahn, 2010; Burch 
et al, 1993 ; Dickinson, 2010; Mallika et al, 2009 ]. 
In its moderate -to-severe form, TED has high morbidity [ Bartalena et al, 2008 ; Bartley, 1994; 
Dickinson, 2010; Gerding et al, 1997 ]. Morbidity takes the form of orbital pain, together with a 
number of serious, sight- threatening conditions, including diplopia (due to inability to correctly 
align the eyes), corneal ulceration (due to inability to close lids), and dysthyroid optic neuropathy (due to proptosis, tissue crowding, and stress on the optic nerve). These combine to produce marked reductions in quality of life (QoL) (e.g., physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, mental health, health perceptions, and pain) [ Gerding et al, 1997; C. Terwee et al, 
2002]. TED can also produce profound psychosocial problems, in particular anxiety and depression, due to the alarming and disfiguring changes in appearance [ Bartley et al, 1996; 
Coulter et al, 2007; G. J. Kahaly et al, 2005]. Taken toget her, these data show that moderate- to-
severe active TED is a physically and emotionally debilitating condition ( Figure 7.1).

7.1.2 Insulin- like Growth Factor-1 R eceptor  (IGF -1R) 
The key underlying mechanism in Graves’ hyperthyroidism is the generation of auto-antibodies 
(Grave’ Disease immunoglobulin G; GD-IgGs) that act on the thyroid to produce 
hyperthyroidism [ Akamizu, 2001]. The primary molecular mechanism through which GD- IgGs 
produce hyperthyroidism is believed to be activation of thyroid stimulating hormone receptors (TSHR) in thyroid follicular cells [Akamizu, 2001]. TED  also has an autoimmune basis, but in 
this case, the primary cellular target appears to be orbital fibroblasts. GD -IgGs stimulate orbital 
fibroblasts to proliferate, release cytokines, initiate an inflammatory response, differentiate into adipocytes and myofibroblasts, and to secrete excessive amounts of extracellular matrix (e.g., 
hyaluronan), which in turn results in fibrosis and edema [ Smith, 2010] . It was initially assumed 
that, as with Graves’  hyperthyroidism, GD-IgGs produced TED  through activation of TSHR. 
However, the data for this has never been definitive and a number of lines of evidence argue against there being a single, common molecular target for the 2 conditions. For example, it is not uncommon for there to be longitudin al misalignments in the time courses of Graves’ 
hyperthyroidism and TED ; approximately 10% of TED  patients never become hyperthyroid and 
some TED patients experience unilateral eye symptoms. Moreover, there is disagreement in the literature about whether the levels of TSHR expressed in orbital tissues are alone sufficient to 
trigger and drive TED  (e.g., [Bahn, 2010; Boschi et al, 2005 ; Smith et al, 2004]). 
There are no well -established animal models for TED , and this has hampered both the study of 
mechanism and the discovery of novel therapeutics. Neve rtheless, evidence is now accumulating 
that TSHR may not be the only autoantigen that is involved in regulating TED pathology. 
Specifically, a substantial body of data has been generated arguing that the insulin- like growth 
factor -1 receptor (IGF -1R) plays an important role in regulating the pathophysiological 
responses produced in orbital an immune cells by [CONTACT_86467]-IgGs. Key nonclinical data supporting the 
involvement of IGF -1R in the mechanism of active TED are:  
1. IGF-1R is localized on orbital fibroblasts and binding of IGF to fibroblasts can be 
displaced by [CONTACT_86467]- IgGs  [Weightman et al, 1993]. 
2. IGF-1R is up- regulated in cultured orbital fibroblasts from patients with TED, while 
TSHR is only expressed at low levels  [Tsui et al, 2008]. 
3. Stimulation of IGF -1R by [CONTACT_86467]- IgGs in orbital fibroblasts from patients with TED causes 
increased release of the T -cell attracting cytokines IL -16 and RANTES [Pritchard et al, 
2003] . Importantly, this effect of GD -IgGs is fully reversed by a monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) antagonist specific for IGF -1R. 
4. IGF-1 and GD-IgGs increase hyaluronan synthesis in orbital fibroblasts from patients 
with TED, but not in orbital fibroblasts from control subjects or dermal fibroblasts [Smith 
et al, 2004]. Again, this effect of GD- IgGs is blocked by a selective IGF -1R antagonist 
antibody. Interestingly, in these studies thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) failed to 
stimulate hyaluronan synthesis in orbital fibroblasts from patients with TED.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Exper ience  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Introduction 
Teprotumumab was originally developed by F. Hoffman-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd. for the treatment of 
subjects with advanced solid tumors, including sarcoma. Development for this indication was 
discontinued based on insufficient clinical efficacy  and was not based on any observed safety 
issues in the more than 700 subjects treated in the oncology program.  
Teprotumumab is currently being developed by [CONTACT_697323]- to-severe 
active TED  (also known as Graves’ Ophthalmopathy or Orbitopathy [GO] and 
Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy [TAO]). 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of teprotumumab were characterized by [CONTACT_26702]. A biomarker to 
assess target interaction – increases in serum IGF -1 – was also identified. PK/PD m odeling 
indicated that co ncentrations of 20 μg/mL re sulted in > 90% IGF-1R receptor occupancy, and 
that d oses that produced teprotumumab trough blood concentrations of 20 μg/mL  were well 
tolerated.  
The clinical safety database of teprotumumab in oncology was likely confounded by [CONTACT_697324] s. The 
oncology studies, however, did identify a number of potential AEs of special interest  (AESIs: 
infusion-associated events, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and anemia) and these events 
were monitored carefully in the initial study in TED subject s, TED01RV.  
TED01RV was the first study in which non-oncology subject s received teprotumumab. This 
study enrolled [ADDRESS_946563] s (43 teprotumumab; 44 placebo) between the ages of 18 and 75 years 
with recent onset (≤ 9 months from diagnosis) moderate- to-severe active TED . The primary 
efficacy endpoint was the overall responder rate ( decreases from Baseline of ≥ 2 points in overall 
Clinical Activity Score [ CAS ] and ≥ 2 mm  in proptosis, provided that there was no deterioration 
[i.e., increase s of ≥ 2 points in CAS o r ≥ 2 mm  in proptosis] in the non-study eye) at the end of 
the 24- week treatment phase. In this study, the responder rate was significant ly greater with 
teprotum umab  treatment compared to placebo ( 69% versus 20%; p < 0.001) at Week 24 . 
Therapeutic effects were rapid, with increased responder rates in the teprotumumab group 
relative to placebo detected at Weeks 6, 12, and 18 (all p < 0.001). The secondary endpoints 
(QoL, proptosis, and CAS as continuous variables) all supported the primary analysis conclusion 
that teprotumumab was superior to placebo in the treatment of TED . Population PK modeling in 
TED01RV confirmed that trough concentrations were consistently above the 20 μg /mL 
threshold, which had been previously determined by [CONTACT_697325]/PD modeling as result ing in 
> 90% IGF -1R occupancy in the tissues. Results of the TED01RV study were published in the 
New England Journal of Medicine [ Smith et al, 2017]. 
Of the AESIs identified in the oncology studies (i.e., infusion- associated events, 
thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and anemia), the only one that emerged in the initial trial in subjects with TED was hyperglycemia. Among subjects treated with teprotumumab, hyperglycemia was uniformly mild in non-diabetic subjects and adequately controlled by

No deaths occurred in TED01RV, and early terminations were comparable in each treatment 
group (6/group). SAEs occurred in 5/43 (11.6%) of the subject s in the teprotumumab group and 
1/45 (2.2%) of the subject s in the placebo group ( Table  7.3). Two SAEs in the teprotumumab 
group were categorized by [CONTACT_697327] “possibly related” ( diarrhea and mental 
confusion, which had a provisional diagnosis of Hashimoto’s encephalopathy); the remaining 
were categorized as “unrelated”. In the teprotumumab group, 4 discontinuations for SAEs 
occurred after the following number of infusions: diarrhea after 6 infusions; inflam matory bowel 
disease ( IBD) after 7 infusions; Escherichia coli  sepsis after 3 infusions; and Hashimoto’s 
encephalopathy after [ADDRESS_946566] .

Infusion- associated AEs were reported for [ADDRESS_946568] (facial flushing and 
warmth with concomitant elevated heart rate and blood pressure at the end of the 90-minute 
observation period after the second infusion). At the third infusion visit, the subject was pre-medicated with diphenhydramine, dexamethasone, famotidine and Tylenol and had a similar reaction prior to the study drug infusion. 
Among non- diabetic subject s, hyperglycemia occurred at comparable rates in both treatment 
groups and was uniformly Grade [ADDRESS_946569] s; this was well -controlled after 
diabetes medication adjustment. Glycemic control, as assessed by [CONTACT_13505]1 c, was at baseline levels 
following the treatment phase for all subject s in the teprotumumab group.  
No subject s experienced thrombocytopenia as an AE. There were small differences in the

not considered clinically significant and , importantly , diminished with continued dosing. 
No subject s experienced anemia as an  AE.

should be pre-medicated with the above medications (diphenhydramine, ranitidine, dexamethasone, and/or acetaminophen). Subjects who experience a worsening delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction following repeated infusions of teprotumumab or who have other signs of serum- sickness (e.g., delayed fever, myalgias, arthralgias) may be removed from the study 
after discussion with the Investigator and Sponsor.  
Hyperglycemia  
In preclinical studies, there was no in vitro  cross-reactivity of teprotumumab with the insulin 
receptor. During TED01RV, among non- diabetic subjects, hyperglycemia occurred at 
comparable rates in both treatment groups and was uniformly Grade [ADDRESS_946572] s; 
this was well -controlled after diabetes medication adjustment. Glycemic control, as assessed by 
[CONTACT_13505]1 c, was at baseline levels following the treatment phase for all subject s in the teprotumumab 
group.  
Subject s with known controlled diabetes mellitus are allowed to participate in studies with 
teprotumumab. HbA1c levels should be monitored regularly in these subjects. Investigators are 
strongly encouraged to adjust their subjects’ diabetes management to maintain subject s’ HbA1c 
levels at ≤ 7%. In the event a subject ’s HbA1c level rises to > 7% while in the study, the 
Investigator must determine the risk versus benefit for each subject to remain in the study.  
Fasting glucose leve ls (after at least an [ADDRESS_946573]) should be tested at B aseline. Hyperglycemia 
should be promptly investigated and managed. Subjects with recurrent hyperglycemia, defined as a fasting glucose level of moderate intensity (glucose >160  – 250 mg/dL), will require evaluation 
for diabetes mellitus (e .g., fasting glucose, glucose tolerance, and HbA1c tests) and appropriate 
medical management at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Muscle Spasms  
During the TED01RV study, muscle spasms were identified in 19% of the subjects receiving teprotumumab versus 5% of those receiving placebo. In the teprotumumab  group, 8 subjects had 
muscle spasms ( 6 had Grade 1 and 2 had Grade 2 ); only 2 subjects experienced  the event for 
longer than one week and were treated with muscle rel axants. If possible, avoid medications 
known to cause muscle spasms or muscle toxicity such as diuretics or statins and evaluate for other causes of muscle spasm such as electrolyte abnormalities and dehydration.

 Diarrhea  
In the TED01RV study, diarrhea occurred in 14% of subjects receiving teprotumumab versus 5% 
of those receiving placebo. In the teprotumumab group, 8 subjects had diarrhea (5 had Grade 1, 
2 had Grade 2, and 1 had a Grade 3 [ severe]), with 2 subjects requiring treatment . The severe 
diarrhea (Grade 3) occurred in a subject with a history of colitis and was considered possibly 
related to study drug. This subject was subsequently diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and 
required colectomy  leading to discontinuation from the study. Additionally, ano ther subject was 
diagnosed with IBD during the course of the study.  
Both subjects likely had IBD as a pre-existing condition, prior to study start. However, given the temporal sequence, exacerbation of underlying IBD by [CONTACT_697329]. Therefore, diarrhea that is progressive and persistent, or has features of IBD such as bloody stools or abdominal pain , should undergo prompt evaluation to exclude IBD or other serious 
conditions. If possible, avoid medications known to cause di arrhea such as laxatives and 
magnesium.

and is highly selective; in particular, it does not recognize the insulin receptor. Teprotumumab is well-tolerated in humans at doses that produce > 90% IGF-1R occupancy. Systemic 
administration of teprotumumab to subjects with moderate- to-severe active TED should, 
therefore , attenuate all disease symptoms that are dependent on IGF -1R activation . This 
argument holds whether IGF-1R is being activated by [CONTACT_86467]-IgG or endogenous ligands IGF-[ADDRESS_946575] on long- term outcome , reducing the need for 
corrective surgeries. Previous preclinical and clinical experience indicates that, at doses that are 
pharmacologically relevant for blocking IGF-1R, teprotumumab has an acceptable safety profile following IV infusion and is, therefore , a suitable drug candidate to be investigated in the TED 
indication.

 9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This study will be conducted at up to 16 sites in the [LOCATION_002]  and Europe. 
This is a randomized, double-masked, placebo -controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study. 
Subjects will be screened for the study within 2 to 6 weeks prior to the Baseline (Day 1) Visit. 
Approximately 76 subjects (38/group) who meet the study eligibility criteria will be randomized 
on Day 1 in a 1:1 ratio (stratified by [CONTACT_697310]) to receive 8 infusions of teprotumumab  
(10 mg/ kg for the first infusion and 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions) or placebo every 
3 weeks (q3W ). All subjects will enter a 24 -week double- masked  Treatment Period, during 
which study drug will be infused on Day 1 (Baseline), and Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 (with a final visit at Week 24). A ll study drug dosing will be performed at the clinic under the 
supervision of clinic staff, and at any scheduled infusion, the infusion rate may be reduced  or the 
dose may be interrupted or held based on decreased tolerability  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 for 
details). On each dosing day, scheduled assessments (except for AE and concomitant medication 
use monitoring, which will be monitored throughout the clinic visit) will be completed prior to study drug dosing. After each of the first 2 infusions, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_3012]/email 
the following day and will return to the clinic 1 week after the infusion (Weeks 1 and 4) for safety and tolerability assessments; additional phone/email contacts and clinic visits may also be conducted for any subject experiencing an infusion- associated event.  
At the end of the double- masked  Treatment Period (Week 24), subjects who are proptosis 
non-responders (study eye has < 2 mm decrease in proptosis) will be eligible to enter an 
open- label ex tension study (HZNP -TEP-302) in which subjects may  receive 8 infusions of 
teprotumumab (10 mg/kg for the first infusion and 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions) in an 
open- label fashion.  Discussion of this option with the subject and informed consent presentation 
for HZNP -TEP-[ADDRESS_946580] occur within 2 weeks of the Week 24 Visit.  
At Week 24, proptosis responders, as wel l as non-responders who choose not to enroll in the 
open-label extension study (HZNP -TEP-302), will enter a 48-week Follow-Up Period, during 
which study drug will not be administered and clinic visits are scheduled for Weeks 28, 36, 48, 
60, and 72 (Months 7, 9, 12, 15, and 18). Subjects who are responders at Week 24 but who meet 
the criteria for re -treatment  due to a relapse during the F ollow -Up Period may enroll in the 
open-label extension study , HZNP -TEP-302 (see Section 9.3.4 for details) . 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing prior to Week 21 of the Treatment Period will return to the clinic and undergo the scheduled Week 24 assessments and will be encouraged to participate in the Follow-Up Period unless they initiated another intervention due 
to lack of efficacy . Subjects who enter the Follow-Up Period but prematurely discontinue study 
participation prior to 48 weeks following the double- masked  Treatment Period will return for a 
final visit and undergo the scheduled Week 72 assessments prior to study discharge.

8 infusions if they meet the criteria defined in  Section 9.3.4. 
4. Visit windows of ± [ADDRESS_946583].  
6. Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_3012]/email the day following the first and second infusions for safety and tolerability assessments; phone/email 
contacts will also occur the day after any clinic visit where a subject experiences an infusion- related AE.  
7. Subjects who are proptosis  non-responders at Week 24 of the double- masked Treatment Period will be offered the option to enter an open -label

9.[ADDRESS_946584] es for adequate and well -controlled studies. The 
study population is well- defined and is consistent with the expected target population for whom 
teprotumumab  will be indicated  (adult subjects with Graves ’ disease and moderate- to-severe 
active TED ). 
The measurements used in this study for the primary and secondary endpoints ( proptosis , CAS , 
and GO-QoL questionnaire) are established and well -validated endpoints that have been shown 
to correlate significantly with TED . 
The sample size for this study was based on the data from the TED01RV  study. A sample size of 
38 subjects per group provides 90% power at the 2-sided alpha 0.[ADDRESS_946585] a difference 
of 39% between teprotumumab and placebo in the proptosis responder rate ; this sample size has 
been adjusted for a 16% dropout rate.

 Given the teratogenic effects of teprotumumab  noted in a monkey embryo- fetal development 
toxicity study  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details) and pharmacokinetic profile of teprotumumab (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].3), all subjects (men and women) are required to use adequate contraception and 
report any pregnancies for at least [ADDRESS_946586] dose, the estimated plasma concentration (0.2 µg/mL) is considered reason ably safe with a 
low risk of teratogenicity . Furthermore, a 6-month waiting period is in line with 
recommendations given for other teratogens, such as cytostatic chemotherapy .

9.3.[ADDRESS_946597] from the study at any time. The primary reason for discontinuation from the study and/or study drug should be recorded on the eCRF  using one of the following categories: 
• Adverse Event. The subject experiences an AE that imposes an unacceptable risk to the 
subject’s health, or the subject is unwilling to continue because of an AE. AEs requiri ng 
permanent study drug discontinuation per the protocol include: 
Horizon Pharma  [LOCATION_003], Inc.  Teprotumuma b (HZN- 001) IND: 112952 
Date:  31 January 2019  Protocol: HZNP -TEP-[ADDRESS_946598] 2 weeks prior to the next scheduled dose. 
o Severe drug-r elated hyperglycemia (e.g., blood glucose > 250 mg/dL) that does 
not abate to mild or moderate intensity with anti- diabetic treatment (dose may be 
skipped up to 2 times prior to permanently discontinuing study drug; see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2 for details).  
o Diagnosed or suspected IBD (e.g., diarrhea with or without blood or rectal bleeding associated with abdominal pain or crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/colic, urgency, tenesmus, or incontinence for more than 4 weeks without a confirmed alternative diagnosis OR endoscopic or radiologic evidence of enteritis/colitis without a confirmed alternative diagnosis . 
• Lack of Efficacy . Removal of a subject from the study is at the discretion of the 
Inves tigator and may occur if the Investigator determines that study drug administration 
is not benefitting the subject and eye symptoms linked to progressing disease worsen  
posing an unacceptable risk to the subject.  The specific care of the subject is best 
determined by [CONTACT_697330](s) involved in the subject’s care and may require removal from the study. All subjects are free to withdraw from study participation at any time, for any reason, allowing them to receive any specific treatment for TED that is considered necessary per their treating physician and local standard of care.  
• Non-Compliance with Study Drug/Other /Protocol Deviations . The subject has a 
significant protocol deviation, does not comply with study drug administration schedule, or fails to adhere to other study requirements as stated in the protocol.  
• Lost to F ollow -Up. The subject does not return to the clinic for scheduled assessments, 
and does not respond to the site’s attempts to contact [CONTACT_423]. 
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_27720]/Guardian . The subject wishes to withdraw from the study. The 
clinical site should attempt to determine the underlying reason for the voluntary withdrawal and document it on the eCRF; if the underlying reason is documented as an AE or lack of efficacy , the category of withdrawal should be marked in the corresponding 
category and not as voluntary withdrawal. 
• Study Terminated by [CONTACT_2728]. The Sponsor, IRB/IEC, or regulatory agency terminates the study. 
• Pregnancy. 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing prior to Week 21 of the Treatment Period  will return to the clinic and undergo the scheduled Week 24 assessments and will be 
encouraged to participate in the Follow-Up Period unless they initiated another intervention due 
to lack of efficacy . Subjects who enter the Follow -Up Period but prematurely discontinue study 
participation prior to 48 weeks following the Treatment Period will return for a final visit and undergo the scheduled Week 72 assessments prior to study discharge.  Subjects who discontinue

with teprotumumab (HZNP -TEP-302) and receive 8 infusions of t eprotumumab. The criteria to 
determine relapse is the following:  
• Increase in proptosis of ≥ 2 mm in the study eye since Week 24, or 
• An increase in CAS ≥ 2 points since Week 24 with an absolute CAS of ≥ 4 in the study 
eye following the Week 24 V isit. 
• In addition to one of the bullet points above, the Investigator should also consider the 
subject’s symptomology to ensure a relapse has occurred  (e.g., new onset of double 
vision). 
9.3.5 Replacement Policy  
[IP_ADDRESS] Subjects  
No subject prematurely discontinued from the study for any reason will be replaced. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Centers  
A center may be closed and/or replaced for the following administrative reasons:  
• Excessively slow recruitment.  
• Poor protocol adherence. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Screen Failures 
Subjects who do not meet all  of the inclusion c riteria or meet any of the exclusion c riteria will be 
considered screen failures. Scre en failures may be allowed to rescreen for the study if both the 
Investigator and Sponsor are in agreement regarding rescreening and if the Investigator 
determines that they can satisfy all of the eligibility criteria. Based on the TED01RV study, the 
expec ted screen fail ure rate is 20 – 25%  [Smith et al, 2017]. 
9.4 Treatment s 
9.4.1 Treatments Administered  
All study drug dosing will be performed at the clinic under the supervision of clinic staff. On Day 1 of the double- masked  Treatment Period, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio 
(stratified by [CONTACT_697310]) to receive infusions of either: 
1. Teprotumumab 20 mg/kg (10 mg/kg on Day 1 followed by 20 mg/kg q3W for the remaining 7 infusions), or  
2. Placebo (q3W for all 8 infusions).

not less than 50 minutes), providing there are no significant infusion- associated events. 
9.4.2 Identity of Investigational Products 
[IP_ADDRESS] Teprotumumab  
Teprotumumab ( HZN -001) is a fully human anti- IGF-1R mAb . The physiochemical properties 
were previously presented in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Teprotumumab will be provided in single-dose 
20 mL glass vials as a freeze-dried powder containing, in addition to the drug substance, 
20 mmol/L histidine -histidine chloride, 250 mmol/L trehalose, and 0.01% polysorbate 20 (w/w).  
Prior to administration, each vial containing 500 mg teprotumumab  freeze- dried  powder will be 
reconstituted with 10 mL of water for injection. The resulting solution has an approximate 
concentration of 50 mg/ mL teprotumumab. The r econstituted teprotumumab solution must be 
further diluted in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride (NaCl) solution prior to a dministration  (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details) .

All dosing instructions are applicable for teprotumumab and placebo administration.  
Subjects will be monitored for immediate infusion -associated events (e.g., nausea, vomiting, 
facial flushing , warmth, dyspnea, dizziness, hypertension, hypotension, pruritus ) and delayed 
infusion- associated events (e.g., rash). If immediate infusion- associated events are noted , the 
infusion rate will be slowed or interrupted , symptomatic treatment (e .g., antipyretics, 
antihistamines, beta -agonists, oxygen, IV fluid) will be administered , and vital signs 
(temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) will be monitored every 5 minutes until 
stable and then every 15 minutes for 2 additional determinations. The infusion may be restarted upon complete resolution of symptoms; however, study drug dosing will be permanently discontinued if the event is an anaphylactic reaction .  
If delayed  infusio n-associated event s are noted, subjects may continue dosing at the 
Investigator's discretion ; however, if a rash worsens following repeated dosing or other signs of 
serum  sickness (e.g., delayed fever, myalgias , arthralgias) are present, study drug dosing will be 
permanently discontinued. 
Following the appearance of either immediate or delayed infusion- associated events, subsequent 
doses may be pre-treated with diphenhydramine (1 to 1.25 mg/kg IV; maximum of 50 mg), 
ranitidine (50 mg IV), famotidine (0.5 mg /kg IV), dexamethasone (0.4 mg/kg IV; maximum of 
20 mg), and/or acetaminophen (500 mg). All subsequent infusions will be administered over 
approximately 90 minutes (but not less than 80 minutes) with vital signs monitored every [ADDRESS_946613] 2 weeks prior to 
the next scheduled dose in order for the dose to be administered; if the AE remains severe in 
intensity within [ADDRESS_946614] in the study, the next scheduled infusion visit may be skipped to allow modified anti-
diabetic treatment to show its activity and hyperglycemia to return to mild/moderate level before dosing. The subject would then be dosed at the next scheduled visit (i.e., 6 weeks after the previous infusion). Fasting blood glucose levels must return to mild/moderate severity before the next scheduled infusion. The above process of withholding a scheduled infusion will be permitted only twice during the study.

9.4.8 Masking and Unmasking  
The pharmacists or designees responsible for preparing the teprotumumab or placebo solutions 
for IV administration  will not be masked  to the identity of the study drug. Pharmacists/designees 
will provide study drug in infusion bags (fully diluted for administration ) to study site personnel 
with appropriate masked labels. The subject, Investigator , and all other study site personnel will 
be masked  to the treatment being administered.  
During the phase [ADDRESS_946616] the Sponsor or Sponsor’s des ignee before 
unmasking the subject’s data. If a subject’s data are unmasked without prior knowledge of the 
Sponsor, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as possible and no later than the next business day. All circumstances surrounding the event must be clearly documented.  
The Sponsor ’s Pharmacovigilance department or designee will unmask the identity of the study 
medication for an unexpected , drug- related  SAE for submission to health authorities and 
IRB/IEC according to applicable regulatory requirements. However, the results will not be 
shared with other Sponsor representatives or staff at study sites.  Details of subject s who are 
unmasked during the study will be included in the Clinical Study Report. 
Unmasking for independent pharmacological analysis of biological samples or SAE reporting 
will be performed according to procedures in place to ensure integrity of the data.  
All investigative site staff directly involved in this study will remain masked from Screening 
through analysis of the Follow-Up data and all site close-out visits. The Sponsor and its 
designees will be unmasked after the database lock following completion of all subjects in the 
double- masked  treatment phase.

discrepancy between CAS and proptosis in determining the study eye, this will be adjudicated 
always to the eye with the most significant proptosis. If both eyes are affected equally, the 
Investigator will choose the “study eye”. Both eyes will be assessed for efficacy but the study 
eye will be used to assess the primary outcome measure.  
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_567146] (measured as exophthalmos evaluation of the Clinical 
Measures of Severity using a Hertel instrument provided by [CONTACT_697311]), CAS  (7-item scale), diplopia ( measured as part of the Clinical Measures of 
Severity) and Clinical Measures of Severity (inclu ding motility restriction assessments).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Proptosis  (Exophthalmos) 
The most severely affected eye will be defined as the "study eye" at the Baseline (Day 1) Visit . 
Proptosis assessments will be performed using a Hertel  exophthalmometer provided by [CONTACT_697339] , and (except when strictly unavoidable) the same Hertel 
instrument and same observer should be used at each evaluation  for the full duration of the study. 
Additionally , the same intercanthal distance (ICD) must  be used on each occasion . Instructions 
for the measurement of proptosis are included in Section 17.2 . 
Proptosis will be measured  for each eye at Screening, Day 1 and Weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24 (or 
premature withdrawal [ PW]) during the Treatment Period, and at Weeks 28 , 36, 48, 60, and 72

recorded on the C linical Measures of Severit y eCRF under exophthalmos. The B aseline  value 
will also be recorded.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Activity Score (CAS)  
The CAS will be completed at Screening , Day 1 and Weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24 (or PW) during the 
Treatment Period, and at Weeks 28 , 36, 48, 60, and 72 (or PW) during the Follow-Up Period 
using the 7-item European Group on Graves’ Ophthalmopathy (EUGOGO) amended CAS 
[Mourits et al, 1989] ( Table 9.2).  
The CAS must be ≥ 4 for enrollment and r andomization. Subjects whose CAS score decreases 
2 or more points from Screening to Baseline are not eligible for randomization.

9.5.5 Safety Variables 
Safety will be  assessed via AE and concomitant medication use monitoring, immunogenicity 
testing, physical and oph thalmic  examinations, vital signs, clinical safety laboratory evaluations 
(complete blood count, chemistry [inc luding thyroid panel and HbA1 c], and urinalysis), 
pregnancy testing (if applicable), and ECGs . The study will also be monitored by a DSMB. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.[ADDRESS_946621] a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding) , symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
Pre-existing conditions that worsen during a study are to be reported as AEs. New findings 
reported from the on-study ophthalmic examinations will not be reported as AEs if according to 
the Investigator the abnormalities are related to TED and not consider ed related to the 
investigational product. 
Unchanged, chronic conditions are NOT considered AEs and should not be recorded on the AE 
pages of the eCRF unless there is a clear  exacerbation of a chronic condition.  
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a subject’s condition attributable to the 
disease for which the study drug is being studied (i.e., TED). It may be an increase in the severity 
of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. The development of worse ning proptosis may be considered as disease progression and not an AE. Events, which are 
unequivocally due to disease progression, should only be reported as AEs if they fulfill any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the study drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.2 Serious Adverse Event Definition  
A TEAE , baseline event,  or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of 
either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death.  This includes any death that occurs during the conduct of a clinical study, 
including deaths that appear to be completely unrelated to the study drug (e.g., car 
accidents).  
Horizon Pharma  [LOCATION_003], Inc.  Teprotumuma b (HZN- 001) IND: 112952 
Date:  31 January 2019  Protocol: HZNP -TEP-301 
  Version 4.0, incorporating Amendment 3  
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON PHARMA [LOCATION_003], INC  Page 83 of 117 
 • Life-threatening adverse experience. An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered 
life-threatening if, in the view of either the Investigator or the Sponsor, i ts occurrence 
places the subject  at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an AE or suspected 
adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Persistent  or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]. 
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Other medically important event which, according to appropriate medical judgment, may 
require medical or  surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Surgical procedures or other therapeutic interventions themselves are not AEs, but the condition 
for which the surgery/intervention is required is an AE and should be documented accordingly.  
Elective surgeries that require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697304].  
In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697305], and emergency room visits less than 24 hours in duration are not considered hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.3 Non-Serious Adverse Event Definition  
A non- serious AE includes any AE that is not described in the previous SAE category. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.4 Unexpected Adverse Event Definition  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the Reference 
Safety Information section of the IB or is not listed with  the specificity or severity that has been 
observed. Unexpected, as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the Reference Safety Information as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.[ADDRESS_946622]  
Based on previous clinical experience in TED, the following AESIs are identified for this study 
(See Sectio n [IP_ADDRESS].5.5 for further information): 
• Infusion reactions (e.g., nausea, vomiting, facial flushing , warmth, dyspnea, dizziness, 
hypertension, hypotension, pruritus) 
• Hyperglycemia 
• Muscle spasms  
• Diarrhea

 [IP_ADDRESS].2 Documentation of Adverse Events  
Adverse events that occur within 2 weeks prior to Day 1 and prior to dosing on Day 1 will be 
considered baseline signs/symptoms. The TEAE reporting period begins with administration of 
the first dose of study medication on Day [ADDRESS_946623] dose of study 
drug through completion of the Follow- Up Period (Week 72 or PW). All baseline 
signs/symptoms, TEAE s, and AEs during the Follow-Up Period must be recorded in the sourc e 
documents and on the subject’s e CRF . 
If the Investigator observes an SAE after study completion that he/she believes was possibly caused by [CONTACT_7860], the Investigator will report this SAE using the procedures described in  Section [IP_ADDRESS].5. 
Detailed information regarding all SAEs must also be recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Reporting Form. Whenever possible, the Investigator should group together into a single term the signs and symptoms that constitute a single diagnosis.  For example, cough, rhinitis, and 
sneezing might be grouped together as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]” if the Investigator is confident of the diagnosis. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Intensity  of Adverse Events  
All clinical AEs encountered during the clinical study will be reported on the AE form of the 
CRF. Intensity of AEs will be graded on a 5- point scale (mild, moderate, severe, life- threatening , 
death )
 and reported in detail on the e CRF .  
Intensity  Definition  Corresponding NCI Grade  
Mild  discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity  [ADDRESS_946624] daily activity  2 
Severe inability to work or perform normal daily activity  3 
Life-Threatening  represents an immediate threat to life  4 
Fatal  results in death  5 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Relationship to Study  Drug  
The relationship of the study drug to each AE will be determined by [CONTACT_697342]: 
• No reasonable causal relationship (probably not related): There is no plausible temporal 
relationship or there is  another explanation that unequivocally provides a more plausible 
explanation for the event. 
Horizon Pharma  [LOCATION_003], Inc.  Teprotumuma b (HZN- 001) IND: 112952

  Version 4.0, incorporating Amendment 3  
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON PHARMA [LOCATION_003], INC  Page 85 of 117 
 • Yes, reasonable causal relationship (possibly related): There is evidence in favor of a 
causal relationship  (i.e., there is a plausible time course) and at least o ne of the following 
criteria apply:  
 There is a reasonable pharmacological relationship (or known class effect)  
 There is no other more plausible explanation 
 There is a positive de- challenge (without active treatment of the event)  
 There is a positive re -challenge  
 There is a distinguishable dose effect  
Within the reporting requirement under 21 CFR 312.32(c )(1)(i), the FDA provides the following 
examples of types of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. 
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome ). 
• One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon 
rupture).  
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group . 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_946625] be reported. The following steps will be taken to report promptly and document 
accurately any SAE, whether or not it appears to be related to the study medication:  
1. Report the SAE to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_39985]

3. Respond in a timely manner to any querie s from Sponsor regarding the SAE.  
4. Conduct appropriate consultation and follow-up evaluation until the SAE is resolved, stabilized, or otherwise explained by [CONTACT_737]. 
5. Review each SAE report and evaluate the relationship of the SAE to study treatment.  
The Sponsor will determine whether the SAE is unexpected in nature. 
6. The Investigator must report all AEs or SAEs that meet the criteria for Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Human Subjects or Others to the IRB /IEC . 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_946629] . 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_946630], at a dose > 5% above that which is assign ed to that individual 
subject according to the study protocol. 
All cases of medication errors and overdose (with or without associated AEs) will be 
documented on the eCRF in order to capture this important safety information consistently in the 
database. A Es associated with an overdose and SAEs of overdose are to be reported according to 
the procedures outlined in Sections [IP_ADDRESS].2 and [IP_ADDRESS].5, respectively. 
In the event of drug overdose, the subject is to be treated with symptomatic and supportive care as required . 
[IP_ADDRESS].8 Review of Adverse Events and Emerging New Safety Information 
The Sponsor will perform an ongoing review of all AEs and all other emerging new information relevant to the safety of the drug, including periodic review and analyses of their entire safety

[IP_ADDRESS].11 Development Safety Update Reports  
The Sponsor will prepare and submit annual safety reports to competent authorities and 
concerned ethics committees.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy Reporting  
Pregnancy testing will be performed for women of childbearing potential (including those with 
an onset of menopause <2 years prior to Screening, non-therapy-induced amenorrhea for <12 months prior to Screening, or not surgically sterile [absence of ovaries and/or uterus]) at  
Screening , Baseline, prior to dosing during the Treatment Period (Weeks, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 21), 
the end of the Treatment Period (Week 24 or PW), and at Weeks 28 , 36, and 48 during the 
Follow-Up Period; if a subject discontinues study participation during the Follow- Up Perio d 
prior to the Week [ADDRESS_946631] will be performed at Screening and urine pregnancy tests will be performed prior 
to dose at all other visits, as applicable; the serum sample will  be analyzed at a central study 
laboratory and the urinary pregnancy t ests will be performed locally . 
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the Treatment Period, she should immediately 
notify the Investigator, and teprotumumab dosing should be permanently discontinued.  
Pregnancy occurring in the partner of a male subject participating in the study should be reported 
to the Investigator and the S ponsor. Monitoring of the pa rtner should continue until conclusion 
of the pregnancy.  
Pregnancies occurring  up to [ADDRESS_946632]/subject’s female partner has

 [IP_ADDRESS] Medical History  
Medical history, including tobacco use history and Graves’ di sease and treatment history, will be 
conducted at Screening. TED must be moderate to severe in intensity (non- sight threatening but 
appreciable impact on daily life) with an onset of ophthalmic symptoms (as determined by 
[CONTACT_697313]) within 9 months prior to the Baseline Visit for study enrollment.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature) will be measured at all clinic visits. Vital signs will be measured pre - and post-infusion on Day [ADDRESS_946635]’s arm unconstrained by [CONTACT_697318]. When possible, the same arm will be used for measurements in all study visits.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical and Ophthal mic Examinations, Height, and Weight  
A physical examination, including complete undilated ophthalmic examination, will be 
performed at Screening, Baseline (Day 1) and thereafter at Weeks 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 (or PW) during the Treatment Period and at Weeks 48  and 72 (or PW) of the Follow-Up Period .  
The ophthalmic exam should include best-corrected visual acuity, pupil exam, color vision assessment, Ishihara color plates (or equivalent) or related red desaturation, intraocular pressure and slit lamp ex am. If significant abnormalities are noted compared with previous visits, 
including a loss of [ADDRESS_946636] (APD), rise in intraocular pressure, development of corneal infi ltrates or 
other abnormalities not here specified but of concern to the ophthalmologist, further investigations of visual function will be conducted according to the ophthalmologist decision.  
Subjects who have decreased best -corrected visual acuity due to  optic neuropathy (defined by a 
decrease in vision of [ADDRESS_946637] 6 months) at Screening are not eligible for enrollment. 
New findings reported from on -study ophthalmic examinations will not be reported as AEs if, 
according to the Investigator, the abnormalities are related to TED and not related to the study 
drug. 
Physical exam will include assessment of presence or absence of pretibial myxedema on Day 1, 
Week 24 (or PW) of the Treatment Period, and Week 72 (or PW) of the Follow-Up Period. If

only. 
Weight will be measured at Screening and every 12 weeks throughout the study (Weeks 12 and 
24 [or PW] during the Treatment Period and Weeks 36, 48, 60, and 72 [or PW] of the Follow- Up 
Period ). The dose on Day 1 of the double- masked  Treatment Period will be based on the 
Screening weight. The weight obtained at Week 12 can be used in dose calculations beginning at 
Week 12 or Week 15. 
[IP_ADDRESS] ECGs  
12-lead ECGs will be performed at Screening, B aseline, Weeks 3, 6, 12, and 24 (or PW) of the 
Treatment Period, and Week 72 (or PW) of the Follow-Up Period. At infusion visits, the ECG 
will be performed prior to the infusion. The results will be recorded as normal or abnormal on the e CRF and all abnormal results will be evaluated as clinically (CS) or not clinically significant 
(NCS) by [CONTACT_737]. A copy of the ECG tracing will remain with the source documents.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Safety Tests  
With the exception of urine pregnancy tests, a central study laboratory will be used for all protocol- specified clinical laboratory parameters. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed

studies. The study population is well- defined and is consistent with the expected target 
population for whom teprotumumab will be indicated  (adult subjects previously diagnosed with 
Graves’ hyperthyroidism and with  moderate -to-severe active TED ). 
9.5.7 Study Procedures  
Subjects who provide informed consent and who meet all the entry criteria for participation in this study will be randomized to treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Screening  
Due to the large number of screening  assessments, the Screening Visit may be completed in 
more than one day. During the Screening Visit, potential study subjects will be informed fully 
regarding the nature of the study and possible AEs, and will receive a co py of the ICF for review.  
Potential study subjects must read the ICF and sign the document after the Investigator has 
answered all questions to the study candidate’s satisfaction.  Further procedures can begin only 
after the ICF has been signed. The original signed ICF will be retained by [CONTACT_11219] a 
copy will be given to the study subject. 
Study candidates will be evaluated for study entry according to the stated inclusion and exclusion 
criteria ( Section 9.3).  The Investigator will evaluate the results of all examinations, including 
clinical laboratory tests, and will determine each candidate’s suitability for the study.  The 
Investigator must review the results of all Screening tests before determining that a candidate is 
eligible for study drug treatment. The ser um pregnancy test performed at S creening on all female 
candidates of childbearing potential mus t be negative for those subjects to be eligible for 
initiation of treatment.  All screening procedur es must be completed within 42 to 14 days prior to 
Study Day 1 (i.e., the first day of administration of study drug). The following procedures will be performed during S creening to establish  each candidate’s general heal th and eligibility for 
enrollment into the study:

9.6 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size   
Detailed statistical analyses will be presented in a separate statistical analysis plan  (SAP), and 
analyses presented in the SAP will supersede those presented in the protocol . Some key points 
identified for statistical analyses are outlined below.  
9.6.1 Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Endpoint  
The primary out come measure is the proptosis responder rate (percentage of subjects with a 
≥ 2 mm reduction from Baseline in proptosis in the study eye, without deterioration [≥ 2 mm 
increase] of proptosis in the fellow eye) at Week 24. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Endpoints (analyzed hier archically ) 
1. The overall responder rate (percentage of subjects with ≥ 2-point reduction in CAS AND 
≥ 2 mm reduction in proptosis from Baseline, provided there is no corresponding 
deterioration [≥ 2 point/mm increase] in CAS or proptosis in the fellow eye) at Week 24. 
2. Percentage of subjects with a CAS value of 0 or 1 in the study eye at Week 24. 
3. Mean change from Baseline to Week 24 in proptosis measurement in the study eye.  
4. Diplopia responder rate (percentage of subjects with baseline diplopia > [ADDRESS_946652] a reduction of ≥ 1 grade with no corresponding deterioration [≥ 1 grade 
worsening] in the fellow eye) at Week 24. 
5. Mean change from Baseline to Week 24 in the GO-QoL questionnaire overall score.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Exploratory Endpoints  
1. Evaluate the effect of tepr otumumab versus placebo on the Clinical Measures of Severity 
individual response status frequencies and percentage of responders for each component 
of clinical severity from Baseline to Week 24.  
2. Evaluate the effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the me an change from Baseline to 
Week 24 in the CAS. 
Horizon Pharma  [LOCATION_003], Inc.  Teprotumuma b (HZN- 001) IND: 112952 
Date:  31 January 2019  Protocol: HZNP -TEP-[ADDRESS_946653] of teprotumumab versus placebo on the overall responder rate at 
Week 24 stratified by [CONTACT_697320] (high responders, responders, low responders, 
and non-responders; see Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 for definitions).  
4. Evaluate pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of teprotumumab to estimate exposure and understand PK -PD relationships. 
5. Mean change from Baseline to Week [ADDRESS_946654] of teprotumumab versus placebo on the mean change from Baseline to Week 24 on the motility component of the C linical Measures of Severity . 
9.6.2 Populations for Analysis 
The following analysis populations will be defined for this study:  
• Intent- to-Treat (ITT)   
• Modified Intent- to-Treat (MITT) pop ulation 
• Per Protocol (PP) population  
• Safety Population 
The ITT population will include all subjects who are randomized to treatment. Full details of the 
analysis populations will be described in the SAP. 
9.6.3 Primary and Secondary Endpoint Analysis  
The primary analyses will be conducted in the ITT population. The analysis of the primary 
proptosis responder endpoint will assess risk difference (difference in response rates) in a stratified analysis. The analysis will use Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) weighting to  estimate 
the common risk difference within strata and to estimate the standard error of the common risk difference. Subjects missing the Week 24 evaluation will be considered to be treatment failures (non-responders) for the primary analysis. Further, subjects who prematurely discontinue study 
drug dosing prior to Week 21 during the double- masked Treatment Period will be considered to 
be treatment failures (non -responders), unless an assessment at Week 24 is available. 
Stratification for the analysis will use the same factor as was used to stratify randomization, 
tobacco use (non-user, user). The difference in response rates, comparing teprotumumab to placebo, will be estimated along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) and 
p-value.  
An analysis of risk difference with stratification by [CONTACT_697312] (non- user vs. user) will also be 
used to analyze the 3 secondary categorical endpoints. For the analysis of proptosis and GO -QoL 
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details)  as continuous secondary endpoints , a Mixed -Model Repeated -
Measures (MMRM) analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA) model will be fit to the individual 
change from baseline scores for the study eye, with terms in the model being the baseline score,

differences with 95% CIs and p- value s. 
To control the overall Type [ADDRESS_946656] placebo at the 
0.05 level only if teprotumumab was statistically significant for the outcome measure precedin g 
it in the hierarchical order.  
9.6.4 Exploratory Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic s/Pharmacodynamics 
All PK data and parameters will be presented descriptively, including arithmetic means, standard deviations, geometric means, CVs , medians , and ranges. The key data are C
trough plasma levels at 
Week 9 prior to infusion and at Week 24, important to confirm that plasma concentrations were 
maintained above the 20 µ g/ml level through the course of the dosing period. 
The relationship between clinical endpoints and the plasma concentrations of teprotumumab will 
be explored in a descriptive manner. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Measures of Severity  
The C linical Measures of Severity  results (see Table 9.3) for each item will be summarized at 
each designated  visit for each eye with the number and percentage of subjects being classified as 
responders on each individual criterion. The proportions of responders will be analyzed using the 
same risk difference method  described for the primary endpoint in Section 9.6.3. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Motility Component of the C linical Measures of Severity  
The monocular ductions of the study eye (degrees) will be compared between the 2 treatment groups at each evaluation period for adduction, abduction, supraduction and infraduction.  
For each motility measure, the analysis of the changes from baseline in the target eye will be 
conducted using the same MMRM ANCOVA analysis as the continuous secondary endpoint analysis in Section  9.6.3, substituting the appropriate bas eline assessments.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Activity Score (CAS)  
CAS will be measured as a continuous variable using the MMRM ANCOVA model described above to compare the treatment groups. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_946657]  will be 
classified into one of 4 response categories at Week 24:

  Version 4.0, incorporating Amendment 3  
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF HORIZON PHARMA [LOCATION_003], INC  Page 105 of 117 
 • High responders: Subjects who had a reduction in both proptosis and CAS of 3 or more 
(>3) from B aseline in the study eye, and no deterioration in the fellow eye (i.e., increase 
in CAS ≥ 2 points or increase in proptosis > 2 mm).  
• Responders: Subjects who had a reduction in both CAS and proptosis of 2 or more (but less than 3) from Baseline in the study eye, and no deterioration in the fellow eye.  
• Low Responders: Subjects who had a reduction in both CAS and proptosis of 1 or more (but less than 2) from Baseline in the study eye, and no deterioration in the fellow eye. 
• Non-Responders: Subjects who did not fit into any of the above categories, or were not 
present for the Week 24 evaluation.  
A logistic regression analysis will be used to compare the treatment groups on the basis of this 
ordered 4- category classification.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Quality of Life Analysis  
QoL assessments will be used to derive pre- specified Q oL scores according to the directions for 
the GO- QoL scale. These scores will be summarized by [CONTACT_697350]. The overall score, and the VF and A subscale scores , will be evaluated at 
Week  24 using the MMRM model described above. Final analysis plans will be provided in the 
SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Blood and Serum Biomarkers  
Biomarker data will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Analyses 
The safety analysis population will include all subjects who receive at least one dose and had at 
least one post -dose safety assessment. All safety parameters will be summarized and presented in 
tables based on this safety population. Details of the safety data analysis will be presented in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Interim Analyses  
No interim analyses are planned. 
9.6.5 Sample Size and Power Considerations  
In the prior study, TED01RV, a 51% difference (71% vs 20%) between teprotumumab 
(10 mg/kg for the first infusion followed by 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions) and placebo was observed at Week [ADDRESS_946658] s per group provides 90% power at the 2-sided alpha 0.[ADDRESS_946659]

17.2 Proptosis (Exophthalmometry) Method  
1. Choose a Hertel  exophthalmometer provided by [CONTACT_697356] a snug mechanism and preferably a square angle where it sits 
against the orbital rim (a). 
2. Open it wider than required. 
3. Sit opposite the patient and at the same level.  
4. Keep the patient relaxed, avoiding breath holding and excessive eyelid retraction. 
 
5. Position left foot of Hertel against the patient’s right lateral orbital rim, at level of 
lateral canthus (b).   
It should sit firmly as  medially as possible, but outside lateral canthus and without 
distorting position of globe. 
6. Slide right foot medially into identical position on left orbital rim (c). This will feel 
tight and slightly uncomfortable, but minimizes potential side slippage o f Hertel.  
7. Ask patient to fix their right eye on your left eye while you occlude the patient’s left visual axis with your right thumb. In this position, align the instrument such that the 
vertical mark (or cone) is aligned with the manufacturer’s pre -marked  position on the 
ruler. Once aligned, rotate the instrument  slightly  around the horizontal plane such as 
to view the apex of the cornea in the mirror. Record the position of the corneal apex on the ruler. This is Hertel value.  
8. To record the left eye, hold the instrument stationary and move your head. Then use 
your right eye to record the patients left eye. Again, the opposite visual axis is 
occluded by [CONTACT_567176], while the patient is asked to fix on your right eye. 
Ensure that the corneal apex is measured by [CONTACT_697357].

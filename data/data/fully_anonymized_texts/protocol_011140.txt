Tourniquet Time in Primary Total Knee replacement  
Protocol Date: 7/8/17  
Revised 07/17/2018  
Current Version 11/8/[ADDRESS_1257675] Summary  
 
Resistance to cefalosporins in Staphylococcus Aureus (SA) and Coagulase negative 
Staphylococci (CoNS) isolates is increasing, and vancomycin has been suggested as 
an alternative prophylactic agent in TKA1.  Recently, we have investigated 
prophylactic vancomycin via intraosseous regional administration (IORA) in primary TKA
2, which allowed the use of a lower dose (500mg) while still achieving tissue 
concentrations 4- 10 times higher than systemic administration.  
The use of IORA vancomycin requires the use  of a tourniquet for the duration of the 
procedure. Many surgeons prefer to perform the surgery with tourniquet use minimised or without a tourniquet at all.  The aim of this study is to evaluate whether 
IORA vancomycin can achieve effective tissue concentrations with tourniquet use 
minimised.  
 
Based on a power calculation using previous IORA data, 26 patients undergoing 
primary  TKA for osteoarthritis  will be enrolled in a prospective, randomized, 
controlled trial. Patients will be randomized into two groups. Group A would receive 
a weight based dose of 15mg/kg systemic IV vancomycin via a forearm vein, given 
over a 1-[ADDRESS_1257676] IV 
systemic prophylaxis with a cephalosporin.

Group B  500 mg  IORA  Up 10  min, down, up for cement  
 
 
Primary  TKA would then be carried out as normal, and during the procedure ten 
tissue samples ( 6 subcutaneous fat, 4 bone) will be taken at set time intervals. These 
samples would then be processed using a previously validated technique involving 
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the tissue 
concentration of vancomycin. Samples would be stored in a - 80C freezer in the 
laboratory at Mayo Arizona, before being sent as one shipment to a laboratory in Christchurch, New Zealand for processing. Tissue concentrations would then be 
compared between the two groups. 
 
 
 
  
 3 Introduction 
 
Total knee Arthroplasty (TKA) remains one of the most successful interventions in 
medicine.  Patients who are facing lifelong, crippling pain due to knee arthritis now 
have the opportunity to return to near normal function.   
 
The cost of treating an estab lished infection is estimated at $US107,[ADDRESS_1257677] commonly used 
cephalosporin agents among Staphylococcus Aureus (SA) and Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS) isolates continues to rise
1,11. Vancomycin, which retains broad 
efficacy against such organisms, has been suggested as an alternative prophylactic agent in TKA
1,12.   
 However, systemic vancomycin requires a prolonged administration time, risks 
promoting further antibiotic resistance, and can cause systemic  toxicity. Regional 
administration of medication using a tourniquet achieves higher tissue concentrations than systemic administration, by [CONTACT_897123]. 
Recently, we have investigated prophylactic vancomycin via intraosseous regional 
administration (IORA) in primary TKA
2,12, which allowed the use of a lower dose 
(250mg or 500mg) while still achieving tissue concentrations 4- [ADDRESS_1257678] may mean tissue 
concentrations remain high for the remainder of the procedure. The aim of this study 
is to evaluate whether IORA vancomycin can achieve effective tissue concentrations 
for the  duration of the procedure with tourniquet use minimised in primary TKA.

Potential Benefits of Regional Vancomycin Administration 
 
Regional administration of vancomycin has the following potential advantages: 
 
1) Lower risk of toxicity  

 [ADDRESS_1257679] been associated with a greater risk of 
nephrotoxicity.2,12,18,19 Because regional administration restricts all of the medication 
to its site of action, lower doses may still provide effective tissue concentrations while minimising the risk of systemic toxicity.  
 2) More effective prophylaxis 
 
As well as the advantage of more effective coverage of resistant organisms with 
vancomycin, by [CONTACT_897124]. Therefore a higher tissue concentration of the antibiotic can be achieved, 
even with a lower dose.  This is relevant as higher concentrations of vancomycin have 
been associated with greater efficacy in a clinical setting.
18-20 In addition, greater 
efficacy of the IORA technique has been demonstrated in an animal model of TKA infection.
13 
  3) Ease of administration  
 Vancomycin is normally given systemically over one hour, as high systemic 
concentrations can cause histamine release and a subsequent ‘red man syndrome’, 
caused by [CONTACT_897125].  The timing of 
prophylactic antibiotics is extremely important, and the dose should be given within 
the 60 minutes preceding the surgical incision.
2,12,21,22 Due to the long infusion time 
vancomycin is normally given, achieving optimum t iming as a prophylactic antibiotic 
is difficult to achieve in a busy operating room. In a review of 18,342 arthroplasty 
procedures, vancomycin was given with appropriate timing in only 22% of cases, 
compared to 77% of cases given a cephalosporin3-5. 
 The lower doses of vancomycin used with regional administration and the fact that its 
distribution is limited to the limb reduces the risk of ‘red man synd rome’.  This allows 
for more convenient administration of the antibiotic thus ensuring correct timing of administration.  
 
 6 4) Less resistance pressure  
 
Development of resistance to antibiotics relates to both duration and dosage of the 
antibiotic, which applies a ‘selection pressure’ to bacteria promoting the emergence of 
resistant organisms.  The advantage of regional administration over systemic is that a 
lower overall dose can be used, while still maximizing the effectiveness of the 
antibiotic at its site  of action.  
  
Aim 
 
The aim of this study is to evaluate whether IORA vancomycin can achieve effective 
tissue concentrations with tourniquet use minimised in primary TKA .

Both groups would receive weight- based dose of systemic cefazolin ( or 
alternative antibiotic if allergic to cefazolin)  15 minutes prior to tourniquet 
 7 inflation – either 2g for patients between [ADDRESS_1257680] the limb exsanguinated  and an 
above knee tourniquet inflated  to 300mmHg.  
 
Group A would receive 15mg/kg based on actual body weight (maximum of 2g) 
of vancomycin via the systemic route at a rate of 15mg/kg as per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_159698] (acceptable to give 2g over 2 hours). Systemic IV vancomycin is given 
via a forearm vein, given over an infusion timed to finish immediately prior to surgery.  
 
Immedia tely following  tourniquet inflation , Group B  will receive  500mg of 
vancomycin, via an EZ -IO ( Teleflex Medical , San Antonio, [LOCATION_007]) intraosseous

 9 Samples  
 
Ten tissue samples will be taken from each patient, 6 ‘fat’ samples and 4 ‘bone’ 
samples.  Each sample will be approximately the size of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_897122].  Bone samples 
will be taken from the femur only to ensure no direct contamination from the site of 
injection (tibia).  Where possible, both bone and fat samples will be taken from tissue 
which is normally discarded during the course of a total knee replacement procedure, 
otherwise samples will be taken from tissue that is already exposed with no further 
incisions or invasive procedures required.  Due to the small size of the samples it is 
anticipated that there will be no detrimental effect on the patient.  Samples will be 
stored the Mayo Clinic Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_870109] - 90°C, before being transported to 
Christchurch, New Zealand for analysis using a previously validated te chnique2,12. 
Bone samples will be crushed with pliers, finely cut further with a scalpel, then 
weighed and immersed in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.[ADDRESS_1257685] as the bone 
samples.  The immersed bone or fat tissue suspension will be vortexed for 30 seconds 
and centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant will be transferred to a clean tube and perchloric acid added to precipi[INVESTIGATOR_223337]. After centrifugation at 
15,000 g for 5 min, 50 uL  of clear supernatant will be analysed. Drain fluid samples 
will be processed by [CONTACT_897126] 2500rpm 
for 10 minutes.  The supernatant will be placed in a 1.8ml cryovial.  The 
remaining supernatant and cell pellet will be discarded.  The drain fluid samples 
will be stored at - 90°C until they are shipped with the other samples to 
Christchurch, New Zealand .  
 
  
 10 Power Calculation 
 
Data from a previous randomized trial comparing (IORA) of 500 mg vs. systemic  
administration of 1g vancomycin provide AUC of concentrations during the procedures.   The following table provides the information of AUC and standardized 
AUC (AUC/length of procedure).

Using AUC  
The standardized area under the curve is 30.5 (STD: 26.6) in the IO arm, and 2.4 
(STD: 0.6) in the systematic arm. To achieve 90% statistics power with type I error 
rate of 0.05, 12 patients will be required for each group after accounting for 10% 
missing data.  
 While data on pharmacodynamics of vancomycin for prophylaxis are lacking, in 
treatment models of infection, the area under the concentration- time curve divided by 
[CONTACT_897127] (MIC, a parameter that reflects the sensitively of a bacterial strain to a given antibiotic) is the pharmacokinetic -pharmacodynamic 
 [ADDRESS_1257686] predictive of efficacy. Therefore, further increases in tissue 
vancomycin concentrations are likely to enhance the effectiveness of prophylaxis, 
particularly  in organisms with MICs of 1g/L or more such as MRSA and CoNS20; this 
suggests the differences used in our power analysis are clinically relevant.  
 
 
Statistical analysis 
 
Means, standard deviations, and the 95% confidence limits will be calculated for the 
concentrations in the different samples. Different tissue samples were pooled 
according to surgical steps. Coefficient of variations (CV) of concentration level will 
be summarized at each surgical step for the comparison between two arms. Repeat 
measure analysis of variance will be used to compare the average level of 
concentration across time between groups adjusted by [CONTACT_44207], age, and length of 
surgical procedure; Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]- Wilk test will be used to assess the normality of the 
residuals.  Adverse event will be recorded by [CONTACT_897128].  
 
  
 12 Safety of the intraosseous route 
 
The technique of intraosseous regional administration of antibiotics has been 
evaluated in humans in two randomised controlled trials 2,12.  No complications 
related to the use of the technique were found.  
The use of the intraosseous route for administration of both fluids and medications is 
well established. In 1947, Heinld
4 reported on the use of the intraosseous route in over 
1000 paediatric patients, reporting a 95% success rate in administering fluids, blood products, and a variety of medications. The technique has been more popular in 
paediatric patients because intraven ous access is more difficult; however intraosseous 
administration is equally as effective in adult patients. A summary of more current literature is included below, and a copy of a comprehensive review article recently 
published by [CONTACT_897129]
[ADDRESS_1257687] investigated the regional 
(with tourniquet on) intraosseous delivery of antibiotics in horses.  Scheuch
27 
compared intraosseous versus intravenous infusion of amikacin (an antibiotic) and found similar tissue levels of antibiotic in 21 horses. Mattson
28 found effective tissue 
concentrations of gentamicin after intraosseous regional delivery in 12 horses, and recommended this as a f orm of treatment for infection.  Similarly Rubio
29  compared 
regional intravenous versus intraosseous administration of vancomycin in 12 horses and found equivalent tissue perfusion for both routes.  None of the above studies 
reported any complications with the intraosseous route. 
 
The use of regional (with tourniquet inflated) intraosseous infusions of medications 
has also been investigated in humans. Waisman
11 on 109 patients who were given 
local anaesthetic agents through the regional intraosseous route, in both the upper and lower limbs, to allow surgical procedures to be performed on the limb with the patient 
awake.  The procedure was successful in 106 of 109 patients, with 3 failures.  In one 
patient the needle was incorrectly positioned, and two patients had inadequate 
anaesthesia which  the authors attributed to an insufficient amount of medication 
infused.  No other complications were reported.  This paper is a useful reference as it 
has a very similar concept to our study (substituting the intraosseous route for 
 13 intravenous in the regional delivery of medications) and provides evidence of the 
safety of the technique in a large number of patients.  
 
There are [ADDRESS_1257688] been reported in 
adults. All relate to technical errors or prolonged infusions in an emergent setting, and 
are therefore extremely unlikely to occur in the single, controlled injection proposed 
in this study.  
 
1) Extravasation of fluid (due to incorrect needle placement) 
This complication occurs when a needle is not place correctly (outside the bone), and  
infusion of fluid or medication is commenced. With modern intraosseous needles this complication is reduced by [CONTACT_897130], particularly at the IO 
needle insertion site, and using appropriate length IO needles to prevent over 
penetratio n through the bone.  The reported success rates for the EZ-IO needle used in 
the current study range from 94- 100%, and it is anticipated that as the needle will be 
placed by a trained orthopaedic surgeon in a controlled theatre environment the 
chance of incorrect needle placement will be very low.  
 2) Compartment Syndrome 
Compartment syndrome again relates firstly to incorrect needle placement, and has 
been described rarely in a isolated case report following intraosseous infusions
30. It 
occurs if the tip of the needle is placed into soft tissues rather than bone, then prolonged infusion of fluids commenced and the situation is not recognised. Large 
published series of intraosseous infusions have not reported this complication 
suggesting it is very rare.
7 It is extremely unlikely to occur in the context of this study 
as the needle is left in situ for a very short time, and fluid is injec ted as a single bolus 
so needle malposition or fluid leakage into the tissue will be immediately recognised.  
  
3) Fracture  
There have been isolated reports of fracture following intraosseous needle placement in the literature. This is thought to relate to  the use of excessive force with manual 
needle placement, and to our knowledge has not been reported with the powered needle driver used in the current study.  
 14  
4) Infection / osteomyelitis  
A meta -analysis of 4359 intraosseous insertion attempts reported an incidence of 
infection of 0.6%7.  It is anticipated  that as the insertions in our study will take place 
in a full sterile environment and antibiotic will be injected through the needle the incidence of infection is likely to be even lower.  
The above complications will be outlined in the patient informatio n sheet.  
 
Vancomycin and ‘Red Man Syndrome’  
Vancomycin has been administered successfully via the intraosseous route in both 
human
12 and animal studies29,31. One advantage of using the regional technique 
outlined in this study is the potential to use lower doses to achi eve high local 
concentrations, and thus minimize systemic side effects such as ‘Red Man Syndrome’.  
 Red man syndrome is an anaphylactoid reaction caused by [CONTACT_897131]. It is not an allergic reaction and is independent of 
preformed immunoglobulin E. It occurs in 30% to 90% of healthy volunteers given 
vancomycin
32, and symptoms are usually mild and alleviated by [CONTACT_897132]. Incidence is related to both dosage and rate of infusion; Polk et al.33 
observed the reaction during systemic infusion of 1 g vancomycin in  82% of 
volunteers, but no reaction occurred when a 500 -mg dose was used. Healy et al.34 
noted symptoms in eight of 10 volunteers (80%) given 1 g vancomycin over 1 hour 
but in only three of 10 volunteers (30%) given the same dose over [ADDRESS_1257689] of the high tissue concentration, that causes antibiotic to be released gradually into the systemic circulation after 
tourniquet deflation
29.  
 As a precaution, the patients receiving IORA vancomycin in this study will be 
monitored closely after tourniquet deflation and an antihistamine will be available if 
clinical signs  of red man syndrome are seen.

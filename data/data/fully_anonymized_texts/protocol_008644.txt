Tumors are potentially immunogenic, however they fail to spontaneously induce  immune 
respon ses capable of rejecting tumors. A major reason for this is that the tumor 
microenvironment lacks ade quate innate immune activation required to initiate strong adaptive 
antitumor immunity. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are highly spec ialized components of 
the innate immune system that are capable of sens ing microbial nucleic acids via intracellular 
Toll-like receptors. During viral infection, pDCs acc umulate in infected tissues  and are 
activated by [CONTACT_472653] I interferons (IFNs) and 
generate protective immunity against the virus by [CONTACT_472654], T cells, and 
natural killer cells. Tumors also contain pDCs but do not provide molecular signals to activate 
pDCs, although tumors contain self-DNA released  in the extracellular environment at high 
conc entrations as  a result of increased tumor cell turnover. pDCs, though activated by [CONTACT_472655], are normally not able to sense tumor-derived DNA and thus are unable to initiate 
strong innate anti-tumor immune responses. We recently found that pDCs can,  in fact, sense 
and respond to self-DNA when combined with an endogenous peptide called LL37. LL37 can 
bind to self-DNA fragments released by [CONTACT_472656] a nd condensed 
structures that are delivered to and retained within early endos omes of pDCs. In these 
intracellular compartments,  LL37/self-DNA can interact with Toll-like receptor [ADDRESS_605861] t ype I IFN production similarly to viral DNA. Because tumors release  large amounts of 
self-DNA and contain pDCs but  do not express LL 37, our hypothesis for the proposed phase 
I/II outcome-adaptive Bayesian dose finding clinical trial desc ribed herein is that exogenous 
LL37 can be used to target tumor-derived self-DNA and convert it into a “danger signal” that 
triggers pDC act ivation and type I IFN production at the tumor site in patients with melanoma. 
This then induces  T-cell-mediated immunity against melanoma by [CONTACT_472657]-viral-immune responses are induced.  
 
 
1. Objectives 
 
1.1 Primary  Objective 
 
To determine the optimal biologic dos ing of LL37 based on toxicity and efficacy. 
 
1. 2 Secondary Objectives 
 
To evaluate antitumor immune responses and clinical efficacy of intra-tumoral 
injection of LL37 in patients with melanoma. 
 
2. Background and Rationale 
 
 
2.1 Natural anti-tumor immune responses are often weak compared with antiviral 
immune responses 
 
The notion of whether the immune system is capable of recognizing, respo nding to, 
and eradicating established  tumors was at one time a rather contentious and 
LL37: 2013-[ADDRESS_605862] shed 
light on  why viruses and  other pathogens can elicit such  potent and effective natural 
immune responses. We believe that harnessing and adapting the mechanisms used 
by [CONTACT_472658] a very promising 
approach to improving spec ific antitumor immune responses. 
 
 
2.2 Activation of innate immunity is critical for the generation of effective 
adaptive immune responses 
 
 
Effective antiviral immune responses are initiated through activation of innate 
immune cells, including NK cells, con ventional myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), and 
plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), by [CONTACT_472659]  11-13.  Activation of 
innate immunity induces the  production of proinflammatory cytokines which can 
directly activate cells important for the initiation of adaptive immune respon ses.  
Type I interferons (IFNs) and tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-β), for example, are potent 
induce rs of mDC maturation, inducing upregulation of major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC ) and costimulatory molecules as well as p roduction of IL-12, all of 
which are important for the priming of naïve T cells 14,15. In addition, the activation of 
NK cells by [CONTACT_438549], cytokines and TLR ligands  may lead to increased lysis of virally- 
infected cells or tumors which can provide antigen to mDCs for presentation to T 
cells. Activation of innate immunity is important not only for the generation of 
antigen-spec ific T-cells, but also to induce inflammation at the pathogen site which 
leads to enhanced migration of antigen-specific T-cells to the infected tissue.  
 
 
2.3 Plasmacytoid DCs represent a critical link between innate and adaptive 
immunity

 As the  major producer of type I IFNs (represented by [CONTACT_20129]-α and IFN-β), pDCs 
represent one of the most important links between innate and adaptive immunity 16- 
20. Upon triggering of TLR7 or TLR9 by [CONTACT_166193], pDCs rapi[INVESTIGATOR_472640] I IFNs, activate a variety of immune cells such  as B cells, natural killer (NK) 
cells and  macrophages, and differentiate into antigen presenting cells (APCs) to 
induce  antigen-specific T cell responses 21. Both mDCs and NK cell activation can 
               -/- mDCs are defective in 
the ability to adequately respond  to viral infections 22, suggesting that interferon- 
produc ing pDCs may be critical for the activation of mDCs and subsequent 
development of adaptive immunity. 
 
 
2.[ADDRESS_605863] the ability to increase the levels of circulating T-cells cap able 
of recognizing tumor antigens.  However, this has  not led to significant tumor 
regressions in patients.  For example, an analysis of the response rate in over 500 
patients with metastatic melanoma treated with vaccines was un der 3% 23.  Our 
hypothes is is that this is due  to inadequate activation of innate immunity at the  site of 
immunization as well as at the tumor site itself. Lack of adequate inflammation at  
the vaccine site may lead to suboptimal T-cell priming, while equally important; the 
lack of inflammation at the tumor site may lead to inefficient migration of T-cells back 
to the tumor. 
 
 
2.5 Plasmacytoid dendritic cells and myeloid dendritic cells synergize in their 
ability to generate antigen specific immune reactions, resulting in enhanced 
antitumor res ponses in vivo  
 
We hypothesized that by [CONTACT_472660], pDCs would 
potentiate the function of mDCs when used in combination. Indeed, when purified 
murine pDCs and mDCs were co-cultured in the presence of antigen and a TLR 
activation stimulus, such as CpG, followed by [CONTACT_438553], antigen-specific 
T-cell levels were higher than with the administration of either DC subset alone 
(Figure 1). Since the total number of DCs was kept constant for all groups, t he

Importantly, tumor reduction was also enhanced when mice were treated with the

2.6 Self-DNA Coup led with LL37 Triggers TLR9 
 
Beca use pDCs sense  DNA through TLR9 24, we examined TLR9 to determine whether 
it is involved in the recognition of the LL37/self-DNA complex by [CONTACT_472663]. Chloroquine, 
which blocks e ndosomal TLR signaling, potently inhibited the IFN-α expression induced 
by [INVESTIGATOR_93601]37/ DNA (Figure 3A). To spec ifically inhibit TLR9 in pDC, we used short 
oligonuc leotides (ODN-TTAGGG)  that block type I IFN induction by [CONTACT_472664] (TLR9 
agonists) but not by [CONTACT_472665] (R837; TLR7 agonist) (Figure 3B). Pretreatment of 
pDCs with ODN-TTAGGG spec ifically inhibited IFN-α induction by [INVESTIGATOR_93601]37/DNA. We 
confirmed TLR9-mediated recognition of LL37/DNA by [CONTACT_472666]37/DNA 
complex activated the IFN-α4 promoter in IRF7/TLR9-transduced HEK293  cells but not 
in HEK293 cells expressing an irrelevant TLR (Figure 3C). As in pDC cultures, the 
LL37/DNA complex but not DNA alone activated TLR9-transduced cells. However, in 
contrast with pDC cultures, LL37 alone was unable to induce activation of TLR9- 
transdu ced cells, which is cons istent with the absence of cell death in these cultures 
and hence lack of DNA release. Taken together, these data demonstrate that in 
complexes with LL37, self-DNA can activate pDCs through TLR9 25.

numbers of pDCs can infiltrate the tumor microenvironment of human melanoma 
metastase s. Tumor-infiltrating pDCs had  nonactivated phenotypes as desc ribed 
previously 35 and were able to produce type I IFNs in response  to CpGs as d emonstrated 
by [CONTACT_472667]-derived mononuclear cell suspensions (data not sho wn). As 
aggressively growing tumors, melanomas are typi[INVESTIGATOR_472642]. This phenomenon is well kno wn to pathologists in particular because 
the high degree of cell death makes  immunohistological ana lysis of tumor spec imens 
difficult to interpret26.  Using flow cytometry, we indeed found cons iderable numbers of 
dead tumor cells identified acco rding to their typi[INVESTIGATOR_472643]/side 
scatter  and staining for 7-AAD. The presence of dying tumor cells suggests the  presence 
of self-DNA released into the extracellular tissue compartment.

exclusively in supe rnatants of irradiated melanoma cells cultured with LL37 (data not 
shown). These results indicated that irradiated melanoma cells release self-DNA that is 
bound to LL37 and protected by [INVESTIGATOR_93601]37. 
 
 
2.9 Intratumoral Injection of LL37 Elicits Local Antitumor Activity 
 
We inoculated 3 x 105 B16 melanoma cells into shaved flanks  of C57BL/6 mice. We 
allowed the resulting tumors to grow for 7 days. On  day 7, we injected tumors with a 
single dose  of LL37 (20 μmol) or injected them with saline as a control. We monitored 
tumor size using a caliper and estimated tumor volume using the formula π/[ADDRESS_605866] 20 mm in maximal diameter. 
We found that a single intratumoral injection of LL37 significantly delayed the growth of 
estab lished B16 tumors (Figure 5). Thus, intratumoral LL37 injection induces potent 
antitumor activity in melanomas.

irradiated  B16 cells expressing  OVA delays the 
growth of pre-established B16-OVA tumo rs. Mice 
beari ng 7-day subcutaneous B16 melanomas 
transfected with a gene encoding OVA (B16-OVA) 
were vaccinated subcutaneously with LL37 alone, 
irradiated B16-OVA tumor cells (iB16-OVA), irradiated 
B16-OVA tumor cells mixed with 20 µmol of CpG-2216 
(iB16 -OVA+CpG), or irradiated B16-OVA tumor cells 
with 20 µmol of LL37 (iB16-OVA +LL37 ). Tumor size 
was monito red using a caliper every other  day. The 
data represent the mean for four mice per group. 
 
 
 
We performed vaccine studies using the B16 model of melanoma. B16 cells can be 
transfected with ovalbumin (OVA) to produce an immunogen that allows easy  tracking of 
antitumor immune responses. We subcutaneously implanted 3 x 105 B16-OVA  cells in the 
flanks  of C57BL/[ADDRESS_605867] CpG. A detailed method for the generation of these vaccines is 
desc ribed below in Resea rch Design and Methods. We monitored the sizes of the resulting 
tumors using a caliper and estimated the tumor volumes using the formula π/[ADDRESS_605868] 20 mm in 
maximal diameter. Vacc ination with LL 37 plus irradiated tumor cells significantly delayed the 
growth of 7-day estab lished B16  tumors more than the control groups and more than the mice 
that received irradiated B16-OVA cells mixed with CpG (Figure 6). These findings indicate that 
vaccination with LL37+dying tumor cells elicit potent systemic antitumor activity. LL37 ap pears 
to be more potent than CpG, which is among the most potent adjuvantscu rrently tested  in 
clinical vaccination trials 35. We performed these experiments using CpG-2216, which is the 
most potent CpG sequence  for inducing type I IFNs in both murine and human pDCs 28. 
 
Having demonstrated that LL37, which is capable of stimulating innate immunity by [CONTACT_472670], we propose to evaluate this peptide in 
patients by [CONTACT_472671]37 into accessible tumor sites followed by [CONTACT_472672], 
blood samples, and biopsies of injected  and non-injected tumors. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_605869] melanoma tumor depos its with LL37 in order to activate the 
innate immune response at the tumor site. We hypothesize that this will lead to a strong 
systemic T-cell response resulting in immune activation and tumor regression at LL37 
injected  as well as n on-injected  sites. The primary objective will be to ascertain the 
optimal biologic dose  of LL37 which will be defined based upon toxicity and efficacy 
 
We anticipate that these studies may lead to principles in cancer immunotherapy that 
may be widely applicable to the treatment of melanoma as well as other cancer types. 
9 LL37: 2013-[ADDRESS_605870] ituted to a concentration of 8 mg/mL in sterile saline and stored frozen in 
aliquots of at -20°C. The peptide solution will be thawed and diluted as required 
in sterile saline to achieve peptide concentrations of 8 mg/mL (2000 μg/250 μL) 
or 4 mg/mL (1000 μg/250 μL) or 2 mg/mL (500 μg/250 μL) or 1 mg/mL (250 
μg/250 μL). Peptide solution will be prepared in P14 CTL/GMP laboratory by 
[CONTACT_21724]. The peptide solution will be prepared from the bulk LL37 
received from Bachem Americas ac cording to an approved SOP. The solution 
will be vialed and the lot will be tested per the SOP. Analytical test ing is 
performed by [CONTACT_472673] a QA reviewed/app roved report is provided to the MD 
Ande rson GMP. The MD An derson GMP will prepare a CoA and if all test 
spec ifications are met, the lot will be released and sent to investigational 
pharmacy. 
 
Since it is assumed that the average size of a melanoma nodule is approximately 
1cm3 which is equivalent to  1mL, use of a vialed peptide solution at 
2000µg/250µL would produce  a final concentration of 2000µg/250 µL injected 
into the tumor. Similar mathematics is utilized for all dose levels and injection of 
250µL of LL37 administered into tumor sites will achieve conce ntrations of 250, 
500, 1000, or 2000 µg/tumor. Up to four lesions will be treated per patient. 
 
3.2 Dose Justification 
 
In our murine studies we injected  100 µg into 0.1-0.2 cm3 tumors. Assuming that 
tumors are a self-contained mass in which the injected peptide will diffuse,  we 
hypothes ize concentrations of 500-1,000 µg/ml are in the range that is needed 
for pDC activation and antitumor function. This range is also close to the levels 
seen  in psoriasis patients (mean 1,520 µg/ml), in which robust  pDC activation is 
seen29. Therefore, in the clinical trial we propose to inject 250, 500, 1,000, or 
2,000 µg of LL37 peptide into tumors. Ass uming that the average size of injected 
human melanoma nodules is 1cm3 (= 1ml) the concentrations in the tumors will 
be 250, 500, 1,000 or 2,000 µg/ml. We estimate that these levels shou ld be well 
tolerated by [CONTACT_472674].

4.3.8  Medical p hotography and measurements of in-transit lesions and/or 
cutaneous lesions. 
 
4.3.9  Base line adverse event recording, physical e xam and concurrent 
medication usage will be documented 
 
4.3.10  Base line biopsy of tumor site to be injected with LL37 
 
 
 
4.3.11  If patient agrees to the optional procedure, leukapheresis consisting of 
7.5-10 liter exchan ge lasting approximately 3 hours to obtained baseline 
immunologic sampling 
 
 
 
5. Treatment Plan 
 
5.1 Phase I (dose escalation) Overview 
 
The dose escalation schema is listed in table 5.1. 
Table 5.1: dose escalation schema for phase I 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A total of 36 patients will be enrolled into the study.  Two patients will be entered 
at each dose level beginning with coho rt 1 (starting dose  250 µg/tumor). The 
number of subjects at each  dose  level will be assigned adaptively as desc ribed in 
the Statistics Section (section 10) but to summarize, the  efficacy and toxicity of 
LL37: 2013-[ADDRESS_605879] two weeks of ea ch patient’s the rapy. 
Once  the efficacy and toxicity data are available, the EffTox program will be 
utilized and the next cohort of patients can be assigned. 
There will be no intra-patient dose escalation above the assigned dosing. 
Dose Limiting Toxicity in a given patient is defined as: 
a. Any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity by [CONTACT_137773] 4.03 
regardless of duration, including: 
Grade [ADDRESS_605880] 1  cm in diameter. Patients will receive weekly intratumoral injections of 
LL37 for up to 8 weeks. The injections will be given every 7 days (+/- 48 hours). 
 
Dose administration will be delayed based on toxicities including development of 
intolerable Grade [ADDRESS_605881] G rade 1 within this spec ified 
time. 
 
Biopsy  samples of injected tumors will be obtained before the initial injection, 24 
hours (+/- 8 hours), and 4 weeks (+/- 48 hours) after the initial injection. 
Minimum biopsy sample size is a 5mm by 5mm punch  biopsy performed in clinic 
by [CONTACT_20169]-level providers or attending physicians. The samples will be obtained by 
[CONTACT_5640] a punch biopsy  or an excisional b iopsy.  Biopsy  samples of distant  non- 
treated tumors will be obtained at week 4  (+/- 48 hours). 
 
Peripheral blood, approximately 60 ml, will be collected before the initial injection 
and then every 2 weeks (+/- 48 hours) to assess s ystemic immune responses to 
tumors.  If patient agrees to  the optional procedure, leukapheresis will be 
performed prior to initial treatment and at week 8 for more extensive immune 
monitoring.

 6. Evaluation during Study 
 
6.1 Clinical evaluation: 
 
Patients will be evaluated every week at the time of the injections for up to 8 
weeks. Ph ysical e xamination, update of concurrent medications and adverse 
event recordings will be done during weekly visits prior to LL37 injections.  CBC 
with differential and serum chemistries during weekly visits for up to 8 weeks and 
when off study will be performed. Medical photography  at base line, week 4, 8 
and off study will be performed. After completion of LL37 injections, patients will 
be followed routinely in clinic for a period of one year to assess  ongoing 
respon se to therapy. 
 
6.2 Immunological Evaluations 
 
6.2.1  For blood and tissue studies, specimens will be collected as part of the 
protocol as specified in the Study Calendar (section 5.2), processed 
and/or stored for later analysis.  
 
6.2.2  If patient agrees to the optional procedure, leukapheresis will be utilized 
for blood collection instead of phlebotomy to obtain peripheral 
lymphoc ytes at t wo time points when feasible. Leukapheresis will be 
performed prior to treatment and 8 weeks (+/- 48 hours) after initial LL37 
injection for assessment of specific T-cell reactivity in peripheral blood. 
 
Each  leukapheresis will cons ist of a 7.[ADDRESS_605883] vaccination. Tumor biopsy  of an  
  injected  site will be taken approximately 24 hours (+/- 8 hours) after initial LL37  
  injection to allow for analysis of interferon alpha levels which will help inform us of 
  the optimal biologic dose. At  week four, biopsy of both LL37 injected and non-  
  injected  sites will be taken if tumor tissue is still presen t. Tumor biopsies may be  
  taken  using any biopsy method to optimize tumor yield using standard sterile  
  techn iques. We anticipate most biopsies will be done via a 5mm x 5mm skin pun ch 
  biopsy performed in clinic. At least one injected  or one non-injected de posit must  
  not be biopsied to allow for preservation of measureable disease. Fresh tumor  
  biopsies will be sent to the Immunotherapy Platform or Melcore lab.  
 
If patient agrees to the optional procedure, blood and tissue specimens 
collected  in the course of this research project may be banked and provided in 
the future to investigators with IRB approved resea rch protocols.

laboratories, medical photography and clinical tumor measurements. Off study 
procedures will be completed within 14 days of patient going off-treatment. 
Patients will be contact[CONTACT_472676] 30 days (+7 days) from last 
drug administration for all drug-related toxicities which were present at the end of 
study. 
 
6.5 Duration of Treatment 
 
Patients who tolerate the drug without  documented evidence of progression (as 
defined by [CONTACT_472677]) will be treated for eight weeks. 
After completion of all 8 sets of LL37 injections, pat ients will be monitored off of 
therapy with routine clinic visits and  restaging scans  every 8-12 weeks per  the 
discretion of the treating physician. 
 
6.6  Duration of Follow Up 
 
  After patients are removed from the study, they will be followed every 3 months 
  for 1 year to assess status of disease if poss ible. If the patient does not plan to 
  continue to receive medical ca re at MDACC, they will be contact[CONTACT_472678]/email/letter to assess d isease status.

the clinical research monitor. 
7.5 Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE) 
 
An adverse event or suspec ted adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the 
view of either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
 
7.5.1  Death.  
 
7.5.2  A life-threatening adverse drug experience  – any adverse experience that 
places the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of 
death from the adverse experience  as it occurred. It  does not include an 
adverse experience  that, had it occu rred in a more severe form, might 
have caus ed death.

7.5.5  A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, 
or require hosp italization may be considered a serious adverse drug 
19 LL37: 2013-[ADDRESS_605888] and may require medical or  surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical e vents include allergic bronchos pasm requiring 
intens ive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR

8. Criteria for Response 
 
8.1 Tumor measurements will be performed at week 0, then every 4 weeks while the 
patient remains on the study.  For visible cutaneous or palpable subcutaneous 
tumors, target sites will be assess ed by [CONTACT_472679]’s electronic 
chart. Tumor measurements and photography will be performed every [ADDRESS_605893] scans will be performed every 8 weeks  while the 
patient remains on the study. Percentage decrease  in the size of individual tu mor 
lesions will be monitored and compared for different time points during the study.

8.3 Tumor response to therapy for this study will be assessed  using immune-related 
respon se criteria (irRC) which is a modified version of the WHO criteria 30. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_605894] one diameter > [ADDRESS_605895] 10mm in 
diameter. 
 
Non-Measurable (evaluable) Lesions are all other  lesions, including 
unidimensionally measurable disease and small lesions. 
 
8.5 Definition of Index/Non-Index Lesions 
In many patients,  all measu rable disease  will be cutaneous, so we will allow all 
[ADDRESS_605896] at baseline. The index lesions 
shou ld be representative of all involved organs.  In addition, index  lesions s hould 
be selected based on their size (lesions with the longest diameters), their 
suitability for accurate repeat  assessment by [CONTACT_472680], and how 
representative they are of the patient’s tumor burden. A sum of the products  of 
diameters (SPD) for all index lesions will be calculated and considered the 
base line sum of the products  of diameters. Respon se criteria to be followed are 
listed below. The baseline sum will be used as the  reference point to determine 
the objective tumor response of the index lesions at tumor assessment (TA). 
Measu rable lesions, other than index and all sites of non-measurable disease will 
be identified as non-index lesions. Non-index lesions will be recorded on the 
medical record and should be evaluated at the same assessment time points as 
the index lesions. In subse quent assessments, non-index lesions will be 
recorded as “stable or decreased diseas e,” “absent ”, or “progression.” 
 
8.6 Definition of Tumor Response Using irRC 
The sum of the products of diameters at tumor assess ment using the immune- 
related response criteria (irRC) for progressive disease incorporates the 
contribution of new  measurable lesions. Each net Percentage Change in Tumor 
Burden per assessment us ing irRC criteria accounts  for the size and growth 
kinetics of both old and new lesions as  they appear. 
 
Definition of Index Lesions Response Using irRC 
 
irComplete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all index lesions. 
This category encompasses e xactly the same subjects as  “CR” by [CONTACT_242837]. 
 
irPar tial Response (irPR): Decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater  in 
the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of all index 
LL37: 2013-0422 
D05 1-4-17 
HOUSTON, TX M.D. ANDERSON CANCER CENTER 
22  
 and all new  measurable lesions (i.e., Percentage Change in Tumor Burden). 
Note: the appearance of new  measurable lesions is factored into the overall 
tumor burden, but does not  automatically qualify as progressive disease  until the 
SPD increases by  >25% when compared to SPD at  nadir. 
 
irStable Disease (irSD): Does not meet criteria for irCR or irPR, in the absence 
of progressive diseas e. 
 
irProgressive Disease (irPD): At least 25% increase  Percentage Change in 
Tumor Burden (i.e., taking sum of the products of all index lesions and any new 
lesions) when compared to SPD at nadir. 
 
Definition of Non-Index Lesions Response Using irRC 
irComplete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all non-index lesions. 
This category encompasses e xactly the same subjects as  “CR” by [CONTACT_472681] (irPR) or irStable Disease (irSD): non-index  lesions a re not 
cons idered in the definition of PR, these terms do not apply. 
 
irProgressive Disease (irPD): Increases in number or size of non-index lesions 
does  not constitute progressive disease  unless/unt il the Percentage Change in 
Tumor Burden increases by  25% (i.e., the SPD at nadir of the index lesions 
increases  by [CONTACT_242839]). 
 
Impact of New Lesions on irRC 
New lesions in and by [CONTACT_472682]. 
However, their contribution to total tumor burden in included in the SPD which in 
turn feeds into the irRC criteria for tumor response. Therefore, new non- 
measurable lesions will not discontinue any subject from the study. 
 
8.7 Definition of Overall Response Using irRC 
Overall response  using irRC will be based  on these  criteria: 
 
Immune-Related Complete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all 
tumor lesions (index and non-index together  with no new 
measurable/unmeasurable lesions) for at least 4 weeks  from the date of 
documentation of complete response. 
 
Immune-Related Partial Response (irPR): The sum of the products of the two 
largest pe rpendicular diameters of all index lesions is measured and captured as 
the SPD baseline.  At each  subse quent tumor assess ment, the sum of the 
products  of the two largest pe rpendicular diameters of all index lesions and of 
new measurable lesions are added together  to provide the Immune Respon se 
Sum of Product Diameters (irSPD).  A decrease, relative to baseline of the irSPD 
LL37: 2013-0422 
D05 1-4-17 
HOUSTON, TX M.D. ANDERSON CANCER CENTER 
23  
 compared to the previous SPD  baseline, of 50% or greater  is considered an 
immune Partial Response (irPR). 
 
Immune-Related Stable Disease (irSD): irSD is defined as the failure to meet 
criteria for immune complete response or immune partial response, in the 
absence of progressive disease. 
 
Immune-Related Progressi ve Disease (irPD): It is recommended in difficult 
cases to confirm PD by [CONTACT_242841].  Any of the following will const itute 
progressive disease:  
• At least 25% increase in the sum of the products of all index lesions over 
base line SPD calculated for the index lesions. 
• At least a 25% increase in the sum of the products  of all index lesions and 
new measurable lesions (irSPD) over the baseline SPD ca lculated for the 
index  lesions.

8.[ADDRESS_605897] Overall Response Using irRC (irBOR) 
irBOR is the  best confirmed irRC overall response  over the study as a whole, 
recorded between the date of first dose until the last tumor asse ssment before 
subse quent therapy (except for local palliative radiotherapy for painful bone 
lesions) for the individual sub jects in the study.  For assessment of irBOR, all 
available asses sments per subject are considered. 
 
If a lesion is surgically resected  or treated with definitive radiosurgery, the size of 
the lesion prior to the definitive local therapy will be included in the calculated 
irBOR. 
 
Primary evidence  of antineoplastic act ivity will be evaluated  as a function of 
objective tumor response following the vaccination period. An overall objective 
assess ment of all measurable and non-measurable disease will be performed as 
outlined in 8.6. Tumor assess ments should be performed by [CONTACT_117145], 
ultrasound, MRI or CT scan, throughout the study. The treating physicians will 
perform tumor measurement. Radiological studies must account for all lesions 
that were present at baseline and must use the same techniques as  used  at 
base line. All complete and partial responses must be confirmed by a second 
asses sment at least four weeks later. 
 
 
 
9. Criteria for Removal from the Study 
 
Patients will be taken off the study if: (a) the patient voluntarily withdraws, (b) there is 
significant noncompliance (failure to appear to more than 2 protocol spec ified 
procedures), or (c) there is progression of disease  in those patients after treatment. 
LL37: 2013-0422 
D05 1-4-17 
HOUSTON, TX M.D. ANDERSON CANCER CENTER 
25  
 Any patient who develops a DLT or Grade IV toxicity due to treatment will be taken off 
protoco l. 
 
10. Statistical Considerations and Data Analysis 
 
The primary objective of this trial is to determine the optimal biological do se (OBD) of LL37 
based upon toxicity and efficacy. The trial will be conducted based on a phase I/II 
outcome-adaptive Bayesian dose-finding procedu re (EffTox) desc ribed in Thall and Cook 
31 and Thall, Cook and Estey  32.  Under the EffTox procedure, the efficacy and toxicity of 
each  dose  will be monitored simultaneously and will be used to determine the desirability 
of each  dose (I.e. trade-off between efficacy and toxicity) based  on the accumulating dose- 
outcome data. Each time a dose must be chosen,  the desirability of each  dose is 
determined based on the current interim data and the next coho rt is given the most 
desirable dose.  Efficacy will be defined by [CONTACT_20129]-alpha expression at the treated tumor site 
[ADDRESS_605898] injection of LL37 (positive is defined as at least  2-fold higher IFN 
than baseline levels).  Toxicity will be defined as a DLT (defined in Section 7.2) 
experienced  within the first two weeks . 
 
 
 
Each  successive cohort of 2 patients (N=36) will be assigned adaptively to one of four 
dose  levels of LL37, with the first cohort starting at dose level 1: 250 µg (per 1 cm3 tumor). 
Dose levels 2-[ADDRESS_605899] ively.  Simulation results 
estab lishing the design’s properties under each of five potential dose-outcome scenarios 
are summarized in Table 10.1 (EffTox dose-finding v4.0). The lowest acc eptable 
probability of efficacy (pE) used in the simulation was 0.20  [Pr (pE > 0.20 | data) > 0.05]. 
The highest acceptable probability of toxicity (pT) used in the simulation was 0.30 [Pr (pT 
< 0.30 | data) > 0.05]. Each  scenario was simulated 1000 times.  For each  scenario, 
Table 10.1 includes the desirability (see technical d etails), the proportion of trials that each 
dose  is selected, and the average number of patients treated at each dose. Of note, if 
there is no evidence  of efficacy at any dose  (Scena rio 3), the percent of selecting no OBD 
is 80% and only 14 patients will be treated before the study will be stopped.

Data Analyses 
 
At the end of the trial, the OBD will be determined using the algorithm above.  Safety data will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_15994].

 Analyses of response will be performed on patients treated at the OBD. The rates of CR, PR, 
SD, and PD will be estimated with 95% confidence  intervals.  Additionally, response will be 
defined as experiencing either a complete or partial response (CR or PR), and the association 
between response and disease characteristics and  T-cell responses will be asses sed using 
logistic regression.  Because  we are using an adaptive design, the number of patients that will 
be treated at the OBD is unk nown up front, but we expect th is number to be between 19 and 
27 (from the table above).  If we have [ADDRESS_605900] 80% power 
to detect  an odds ratio of 3.6 associated with a particular covariate, assu ming a logistic 
regression model with a normally distributed  covariate and a Type I error rate of 5%.  If we 
have [ADDRESS_605901] 80% power to detect an  odds ratio of 2.[ADDRESS_605902]. 
 
11. Data Entry and Protocol Management 
 
For the purposes  of this study  at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, the Protocol Data 
Management System  (PDMS) will be employed. All patients will be registered in CORe 
utilizing a two-turnstile registration before any study  spec ific tests a re performed. The 
EffTox procedure will be implemented using the Biostatistics Department Clinical Trial 
Condu ct Website. Concomitant medications will be captured in the medical record.

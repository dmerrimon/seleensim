Gorlin/Ketamine   12Nov2019   V4  CONFIDENTIAL   Introduction 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in 
accordance with the applicable [LOCATION_002] government regulations and Mayo Clinic research policies and procedures.  
 
 
Background  
Obesity has become a public health crisis in the developed world, especially in the 
[LOCATION_002]. According to the CDC, more than one- third (36.5%) of adults in the 
[LOCATION_002] are obese as defined by a BMI greater than or equal to 30. A 2013 study 
estimated that 6.6% of the US population is morbidly obese (BMI > 40) (Sturm) Negative health consequences of obesity include cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), systemic hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes, musculoskele tal problems and various malignancies (Adams BJA 2000). Given the 
severe health consequences of obesity and the difficulty that many patients have maintaining a healthy weight, surgical management of obesity has become an effective therapeutic option for m any patients with morbid obesity (Elder Gastroenterology 2007).  
 
The Roux -en-Y gastric by[CONTACT_846624] “gold standard” for weight loss surgery 
and it is frequently performed laparoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897]. It involves anastomosing the proximal portion of the stomach to the jejunum, by[CONTACT_846625] (Ogunnaike A&A2002). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_846606], obese patients pose significant challenges for perioperative physicians and are at higher risk for adverse events postoperatively, especially pulmonary complications (Adams BJA 2000).  
 
Obese patients have increased oxygen consumption, increased CO2 production, reduced lung FRC and reduced chest wall compliance all of which puts  them at risk for 
hypoxemia and hypercarbia particularly in the postoperative period (Adams BJA 2000). Opi[INVESTIGATOR_846607] f or 
adverse event.  
 
Most concerning, however , is the association between obesity and obstructive sleep 
apnea (OSA) which is a risk factor for perioperative respi[INVESTIGATOR_846608] (Chung A&A2008, also multiple case reports). Up to 70% of patients undergoing bariatric surgery have OSA (Frey Obes  Surg  2003).  OSA is a 
disorder characterized by [CONTACT_846626].  
Obese patients are at particular risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_846609] (Romero Chest 2010). In addition, as discussed above, obese patients are more vulnerable to 
disordered gas exchange and have less reserve for tolerating brief periods of obstruction.  
 
OSA patients are especially vulnerable to apneic events postoperatively due to surgical stress, the residual effects of anesthesia, disruption of the normal sleep cycle and

Gorlin/Ketamine   12Nov2019   V4  CONFIDENTIAL   exposure to central nervous system depressants (Benumof Curr Op Anesth 2004). 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_846610]  (Craven 2007, White J 
Physiol 2009). However, poorly managed abdominal pain may itself compromise respi[INVESTIGATOR_846611]. Clinicians are often confronted with the challenge of balancing the risks of opi[INVESTIGATOR_846612]. Non- opi[INVESTIGATOR_846613] (Chung). Other drugs such as dexmedetomidine and gabapentin have also shown promise for reducing perioperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], though both drugs are also central nervous system depressants and it is unknown what effect they may have on airway muscle tone during sleep (Chung).  
 
Ketamine is an NMDA antagonist that, at high doses (>1mg/kg), induces dissociative anesthesia with minimal effects on ventilation and airway reflexes (Gorlin). Low dose ketamine infusions (<0.3mg/kg/hour) have proven efficacy for reducing pain scores as well as reducing post -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_13336] a wide variety of surgical 
procedures (Gorlin JAnesthClinPharm 2016 ). Furthermore, even at anesthetic doses, ketamine has no negative effect on pharyngeal muscle tone (Drummond BJA 1996).  
For these reasons, low dose ketamine may be an ideal analgesic adjunct for patients undergoing gastric by[CONTACT_6476]. Sollazzi et al demonstrated lower PACU pain scores and 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_846614] a combined ketamine/clonidine infusion in the operating room (Sollazzi SurgObesRelDis2009).  
However, to our knowledge, there have been no studies looking at combined intraoperative and postoperative ketamine infusions for gastric by[CONTACT_6476].  
 
Our hypothesis states that in laparoscopic gastric by[CONTACT_846627] -four hours post -surgery 
provides superior pain control and decreases post -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_846615]-ketamine therapy.

Enrollment will be completed within 48 months.  
 
Statistical Plan  
 
Sample Size and Power Calculation  
Our primary hypothesis is to check if the new management will keep patient to get less 
“48 hours morphine equivalent (mg)“. A sample size of [ADDRESS_1177120] 80% power to detect a probability of 0.746 that an observation in new management group is less than an observation in control group using a Wilcoxon (Mann- Whitney) rank -sum test 
with a 0.[ADDRESS_1177121] 17 comes from the new management group, we will claim a success. 
 
Statistical Methods  
Basic patient characteristics,  using mean+ SD or median (range) for continuous variable 
and frequency (% percentage) for categorical data, will be summarized in a table. 2- group 
t-test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Pearson Chi -square test or Fisher exact test will be used to 
compare the two kinds of management when appropriate. The “48 hours morphine equivalent  (mg)” will be compared between the two groups using Wilcoxon Rank sum test. 
A p-value less than 0.05 will be treated as statistical significant. All statistical analyses will 
be performed by [CONTACT_98688] 9.4 software (SAS institute Inc, Cary  NC). 
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
For this study, the follow -up period is defined as [ADDRESS_1177122]- protected database (RedCap). The data 
storage will be restricted to facility computers that are password protected. Relevant clinical information will be reported only with collective data with no identities revealed.  
 
Study Monitoring Plan 
Subjec ts will be closely monitored for adverse events  during  treatment.  All study - 
related AEs must be followed until resolution or stabilization. The investigator will allow 
adequate time for such monitoring  activities.

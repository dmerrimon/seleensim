 1 1  PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1 SYNOPSIS  
Title:  FLUVOXAMINE FOR EARLY TREATMENT OF COVID -19: A FULLY -REMOTE, 
RANDOMIZED PLACEBO CONTROLLED TRIAL   
Study Des cription : This clinical trial will test a promising drug  for early treatment of COVID -19 
in 880 adults who are SARS -CoV-2 positive and recently infected.  The trial 
will determine whether fluvoxa mine  (1) prevent s clinical deterioration 
(defined as the combination of shortness of breath and hypoxia), and (2) 
improve s short - and long -term functional outcome. Clinical deterioration is 
the primary endpoint. Fluvoxamine is an SSRI (FDA approved for OCD and 
Social Anxiety Disorder) that also activates the  sigma -1 receptor (an 
immunomodulatory receptor). It prevented  clinic al deterioration in a 
preliminary RCT  (called STOP COVID) .  Fluvoxamine  (or placebo) will be 
given for approximately [ADDRESS_518159] -randomization , during which 
participants will self -report on shortness of breath and oxygen saturation 
via a twice -daily surve y.  At the end of approximately 15 days, fluvoxamine  
(or placebo) will be stopped.  An additional survey at approximately day 15 
and approximately day 90 will assess function.  
 
Objectives:  
 The primary objective of this clinical trial is to test whether fluvoxamine  
prevents  clinical deterioration in early COVID -19 illness.    
 
The primary  outcome  will be clinical  deterioration , defined  as both  of the 
following: (1) presence of dyspnea and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410923], plus (2) decrease in O 2 saturation (<92% on room air 
and/or supplemental oxygen requirement to keep O 2 saturation ≥92%).   
The hypotheses are:  
Participa nts randomized  to fluvoxamine  will have  a lower  rate of clinical  
deterioration,  compared  to placebo.   
A secondary objective of this clinical trial is to test whether fluvoxamine  
improve s 15-day and [ADDRESS_518160] -randomization  using  the PROMIS  
10-item  Global  Health  Scale.   This secondary  outcome  reflects  the 
increasing  concern  regarding  persistence  of COVID -19 illness  and 
functional  impairment  in a substantial  percentage  of individuals  with  
initially  “mild”  symptoms.  We will also explore  persistent  symp toms  of 
COVID -19 at these  timepoints.    
The hypotheses  are:  
FLUVOXAMINE FOR EARLY TREATMENT OF COVID -19: A FULLY -REMOTE, RANDOMIZED PLACEBO CONTROLLED TRIAL  
  
 [ADDRESS_518161] whether  baseline  oxygen  saturation  
moderates  (modulates  the drug -placebo  difference)  fluvoxamine’s  effect  
on clinical  deterioration.    
The hypothesis  is:  
Participants  with  baseline  O2 saturation  ≤96%  will have  a larger  treatment  
effect  size (i.e.,  larger  fluvoxamine -placebo  difference  in rate of clinical  
deterioration)  than  those  with  O2 saturation  ≥97% .   
The basis  for this hypothesis  is an exploratory  analysis  of the preliminary  
RCT which  found  that all cases  of clinical  deterioration  (26%  of the placebo  
group)  occurred  in participants  whose  baseline  oxygen  saturation  was 96%  
or less.

2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
 
2.2 BACKGROUND   
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19), caused by [CONTACT_410944][INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV-
2), can cause serious illness including lung damage, hypoxia, and cardiac damage, which can lead to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death.[ADDRESS_518166] debilitating persistent symptoms and loss of function , even three or more months after the initial 
stage of illness.  The causes of this persistent illness are unclear and likely heterogene ous; they include persistence of 
the viral infection, immunological changes, and exacerbation of underlying medical conditions.[ADDRESS_518167] -COVID functional impairment.  
 
FLUVOXAMINE FOR EARLY TREATMENT OF COVID -19: A FULLY -REMOTE, RANDOMIZED PLACEBO CONTROLLED TRIAL  
  
 5 Fluvoxamine, an SSRI, repurposed for early treatment of COVID -19 
Fluvoxamine is unique among the SSRIs in that it strongly activates the sigma -1 receptor (S1R), and preclinical studies 
have suggested that by [CONTACT_410945] -19.  In 
2019, it was shown that fluvoxamine given early in treatment, reduced d eterioration and mortality in two animal models 
of sepsis (bacterial peritonitis and lipopolysaccharide stimulation).[ADDRESS_518168] in reducing clinical deterioration of COVID -19, the drug (and 
other S1R agonists) could be an important addition to the armam entarium vs. this pandemic.  
Therefore, we conducted a double -blind, placebo -controlled RCT to test whether fluvoxamine, given as early treatment 
in individuals with mild COVID -19 illness, might prevent clinical deterioration.  49  
From April 10 -Sept 19 , 2020, we conducted the 
STOP COVID trial  (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED] ), a preliminary single -site trial 
conducted in Missouri and Illinois, to test whether 
a course of fluvoxamine given early in COVID -[ADDRESS_518169] 
with participants.  
The STOP COVID participant flow diagram is shown along with participant baseline characteristics ( see Figure and Tables 
on next page ). Participants were randomized to receive fluvoxamine 100 mg vs. placebo up to  three times daily. Study 
medication and monitoring equipment (fingertip pulse oximeter, blood pressure cuff, thermometer) were delivered 
directly to participant homes. Participants entered their own O 2 saturation, vital signs, and symptom rating data twic e 
daily for 15 days online or via phone into REDCap surveys, which were monitored daily by [CONTACT_464]. Participants were 
contact[CONTACT_410946]/ O 2 saturation (e.g., when participants reported an out -of-bounds 
value or one indic ating hypoxia). This monitoring included study staff, under study physician supervision, advising 
participants to contact [CONTACT_410947]. The primary study endpoint was 
time to clinical worsening, which was defi ned as 1) dyspnea or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410924] 
2) O 2 saturation <92% or requirement for supplemental O 2 to keep saturation ≥92%.

The key finding from STOP COVID was that 0% (0/80) 
of fluvoxamine -treated individuals suffered clinical 
deterioration, vs. 8.3% (6/72) of those who received 
placebo ( Figure, right ).  In this study, fluvoxamine was 
generally well -tolerated.  The fluvoxamine group had 
1 serious adverse event and 11 other advers e events, 
while the placebo group had 6 serious and 12 other 
adverse events. Further, we collected 30 -day follow -
up data (after the [ADDRESS_518170] phase): 1 individual in 
each group received ER or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422] ([ADDRESS_518171] pain, 1 fluvoxamine for head ache) and no 
individuals clinically deteriorated.  This demonstrated 
that fluvoxamine prevented, rather than merely 
delayed, deterioration.  
 
This preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility of conducting a fully -remote COVID -[ADDRESS_518172] oxychloroquine studies led by [CONTACT_163671].  
Baseline O 2 may be a moderator of 
fluvoxamine’s treatment effect size.   As the 
figure to the right shows, we found that low -
normal baseline O 2 saturation may be a risk 
factor for clinical deterioration and a 
moderator of fluvoxamine’s treatment effect 
size.  In post -hoc analyses, we examined 
baseline (pre -treatment) O 2 saturations in the 
152 participants.  All of the clinical 
deterioration occur red in individuals with 
baseline O 2 saturation of ≤96%: 6/23 (26%), 
compared to 0/49 (0%) in those with baseline 
O2 saturation ≥97%.  This is important 
because it suggests that fluvoxamine could be 
given to individuals with early COVID -19 only 
if and when their O 2 saturation falls to 96% or 
less.  
Anti-inflammatory (cytokine reduction) actions resulting from S1R activation would fit with recent findings of benefits of 
other anti -inflammatory drugs for COVID -19, including colchicine and corticosteroids.17,18  However, a recent study found 
lower levels of cytokines in severe COVID -19 comp ared to bacterial sepsis.19  If fluvoxamine’s benefit is a S1R -mediated 
effect, this drug could be utilized not only to reduce morbidity and mortality in COVID -19, but also in other medical 
conditions in which treatments to  dampen immunopathology are relevant – including future pandemics.  
There were, however, several limitations to this study.  First, this was a single -site study with a small sample size; the 
small sample size also results in wide confidence intervals (i.e.,  fluvoxamine appeared 100% effective at preventing 
clinical deterioration, but true effect size may be much lower than this).  Second, we did not enrich the sample for risk 
factors for deterioration (such as older age); as a result, the rate of deteriorati on was low (8.3%) in the placebo group; 
this led to a fragile study finding.

 [ADDRESS_518173], 
the presenting symptoms were highly heterogeneous as demonstrated in the Table above. Second, we conducted 
several advanced data analytic techniques focusing on latent trajectory modelling, and we fo und that the temporal 
dynamics of COVID -19 symptoms were highly heterogeneous.  In other words, while symptoms overall decelerated 
(declined non -linearly over time), the trajectories of symptoms varied greatly between participants.  This great 
heterogeneit y of symptoms and their time course presents a challenge for the assessment of symptom change in clinical 
trials.[ADDRESS_518174] for assessing COVID -19 persistence ; however, we 
did not include such a measure in STOP COVID.  Additionally, a longer -term  outcome is needed (beyond 15 days) to 
assess persistence of COVID -19.   
Fluvoxamine Possible Mechanisms of Action  
Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and a S1R agonist.21 The preliminary study was motivated 
by a hypothesis that S1R agonists could dampen excessive inflammation in COVID -19.  This and other potential 
mechanisms by [CONTACT_410948] -19 are summarized below.  
1) Anti -inflammatory effects though the S1R -IRE pathway.   The S1R is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone protein 
involved in many cellular functions, including regulation of the ER stress response/unfolded protein response (UPR) and 
inflammation.22 S1R has been shown to inhibit ER stress sensor inositol -requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1) mediated spl icing  of 
XBP123, a master regulator of cytokine production. These a nti-inflamma tory effects may be the most likely explanation 
for fluvoxamine’s beneficial effects. In COVID -19, an excessive inflammatory process known as “cytokine storm” may 
contribute to worsening of symptoms and cardiopulmonary complications, which can sometimes oc cur around the 
second week of illness. Fluvoxamine may dampen this excessive inflammatory response.   
In a 2019 study by [CONTACT_410949], fluvoxamine showed benefit in preclinical models of inflammation and sepsis.10 
In one model, mice were exposed to the Toll -like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligand li popolysaccharide (LPS), which can trigger an 
inflammatory response.  In another model, a fecal slurry was injected, which triggers a usually sub -lethal infection and 
an inflammatory response. Mice lacking the S1R showed excessive increases in cytokine leve ls and greatly reduced 
survival under either of these conditions, suggesting the S1R inhibits excessive inflammatory responses.  Wildtype mice 
exposed to the same inflammatory triggers showed reduced cytokine levels and increased survival when treated with  
fluvoxamine (a S1R agonist). When investigating the underlying mechanism of this effect, the authors demonstrated that 
S1R inhibits activity of IRE1, which in turn prevents the excessive cytokine production. In an experiment using human 
peripheral blood, they also showed that fluvoxamine can reduce LPS -induced cytokine production by [CONTACT_410950]. In the 
case of COVID -19, fluvoxamine’s S1R agonist action may have a similar ability to reduce the excessive inflammatory 
response induced by [CONTACT_410951], thus reducing inflammation -mediated organ damage.  
2) Anti -viral action through effects on lysosomes, autophagy and/or endocytosis.   Coronaviruses utilize cathepsin 
proteases present in the late endosome to facilitate cell entry24 and re -model ER and phagosomal membranes into sites 
of viral replication.[ADDRESS_518175].26,27 Further Nsp6 has been shown to 
physically  associate with S1R.28 Critically, S1R not  only drives early stage autophagy through the IRE1/UPR pathway, but 
is also essential for lysosomal fusion to complete autophagy, likely by [CONTACT_410952].[ADDRESS_518176] as a promising strategy to treat SARS -CoV-
2.30,31 
Chemically, fluvoxamine is a cationic amphiphilic drug (CAD) wit h a log P 3.1 and a pKa 9.4 and, along with a range of 
antipsychotic and antihistamine drugs, preferentially accumulates in the lysosome. Perhaps due to this, fluvoxamine 
achieves higher concentrations in the lungs (which are lysosome -rich) than in the bra in.[ADDRESS_518177] epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130].33 At high doses (10 uM), CADs including fluvoxamine, have

 [ADDRESS_518178].35  
3) Antiviral effects and prevention of organ damage through regulation of the ER stress  response/UPR.  Some viruses 
hijack the ER stress response/UPR to achieve viral functions36,37, and a number of studies have suggested drugs targeting 
the ER stress response/UPR may be beneficial in treating COVID -19.28,38  S1R agonists (such as fluvoxamine) regulate ER 
stress.  S1R ligand effects on ER stress and other ER functions may reduce organ  dysfunction/damage.39,40 
4) Antiplatelet Effects (common to all SSRIs) . Hyperactivity of platelets may contribute to pathophysiological processes 
leading to thrombotic complications in COVID -19.41 SSRIs can inhibit platelet activation, which may reduce the risk of 
thrombosis, and these anti -platelet effects may be cardioprotective.42  
5) Elevation of melatonin levels in the body. The SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_518179] to reduce inflammation.45,46 Fluvoxamine 
inhibits the metabolism of melatonin, so can increase the melatonin level in the body47, which may be beneficial in 
COVID -19. 
 
In summary:  We need to replicate (or refute) these preliminary findings in a larger confirmatory trial.  We need to find 
out: (1) can fluvoxamine prevent clinical deterioration in early COVID -19? (2) Can fluvoxamine  mitigate the long -term 
impact of COVID -19? (4) Do the benefits of fluvoxamine for preventing deterioration vary as a function of baseline 
oxygen saturation?  
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
 
2.3.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
Potential risks associated with study assessments  
There are no risks associated with any of the as sessments.  
POTENTIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH STUDY MEDICATION  
Fluvoxamine:  
General comments: Fluvoxamine is an antidepressant drug that functions as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor 
(e.g., similar to escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), etc – among the most commonly  
prescribed drugs in the US). Its risk profile  below is for chronic use in a psychiatrically ill population; the risks for short -
term use in a non -psychiatric population are likely lower , as our initial STOP COVID trial demonstrated (18 total AEs in 80 
fluvoxamine -randomized participants, compared to 19 AEs in 72 placebo participants ).  The research team will carefully 
evaluate co -prescribed drugs as well as OTC medications and will instruct participants to minimize caffeine (which has its 
metabolism inhibited by [CONTACT_410953]) , to mitigate drug -drug int eractions.   
Likely risks: none . 
Less likely (1 -10%):  Nausea, Vomiting, Weight loss, Yawning, Loss of appetite, Agitation/Nervousness/Anxiety, Insomnia, 
Somnolence , Tremor , Headache, Dizziness, Palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814] , Tachycardia  (high heart rate), Abdominal pain, 
FLUVOXAMINE FOR EARLY TREATMENT OF COVID -19: A FULLY -REMOTE, RANDOMIZED PLACEBO CONTROLLED TRIAL  
  
 10 Dyspepsia  (indige stion), Diarrhea , Constipation , Hyperhidrosis  (excess sweating), Asthenia  (weakness), Malaise , Sexual 
dysfunction  (including delayed ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, etc.), Xerostomia  (dry mouth).  
Rare (<1%):  Arthralgia , Hal lucination, Confusional state , Extrapyramidal side effects (e.g. dystonia, parkinsonism, tremor, 
etc.), Orthostatic hypotension , Cutaneous hy persensitivity reactions (e.g. edema [buildup of fluid in the tissues], rash, 
pruritus), Mania  (elevated mood together with reduced need for sleep and increased energy), seizures, Abnormal 
hepatic (liver) function, Photosensitivity (being  abnormally sensitive to light), Galactorrhea (expulsion of breast milk 
unrelated to pregnancy or breastfeeding).  
Minimizing risk of fluvoxamine in this study:  
Fluvoxamine has been used for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders worldwide since the 1990s.  Its safety 
profile is well -known from millions of patient -years of use.  It is not fatal even in overdose48 and it does not prolong the 
QTc interval unlike other SSRIs (especially citalopram).  It requires no therapeu tic drug level monitoring or safety labs for 
its use. Its use in this study is within FDA -approved dosing; and it is only used for approximately [ADDRESS_518180] day(s) of 
intervention, the dose can be adjusted  as needed to minimize side effects.  Further, monitoring will include oversight by 
[CONTACT_410954] .  Study exclusions will minimize the risk of clinically  significant drug:drug 
interactions or other problems.  
Other risks  
There may also be unknown risks .  We will adjust the informed consent process if new risks are identified.   
2.3.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
Although the study hopes to prevent serious symptoms of COVID -19, there is no guarantee that the study participants 
will receive any clinical benefits by [CONTACT_6231]. All participants regardless of study randomization, will 
receive increased monitoring  of their COVID -19 illness , potentially leading to management (e.g., being told to contact 
[CONTACT_410955])  that would not have occurred otherwise  or as promptly without this monitoring .  
Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  
COVID -[ADDRESS_518181]. Procedures to recruit 
participants for the protocol and obtain their informed consent or assent a re conducted and supervised by [CONTACT_978]. 
Trained study staff will discuss the study, including the risks and benefits of participation, with potential participants an d 
relevant members of their treatment team as needed to provide informed consent for interes ted individuals. Informed 
consent will be obtained from all participants before any study procedures are initiated. The consent form, which 
incorporates HIPAA authorization, contains a description of the purpose and procedures, risks, procedures to minimiz e 
them, and possible benefits. Participants will be assured that participation in the study in completely voluntary , and that 
they are free to withdraw consent at any time and discontinue participation without prejudice to their current or future

 [ADDRESS_518182] sign a consent document (e -
consent or paper), indicating their consent, approved by [CONTACT_410956], before they can participate in the study.  
PREVENTING BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
Electronic records (computer files, electronic databases, etc.): The risks of breaching confidentiality will be strictly 
limited by [CONTACT_410957], as well as the use of participant ID numbers rather than names 
in the survey database. All other data will be collected/entered in the secur ed, c entralized REDCap database.  
Paper/hard copy records (hard copy surveys, questionnaires, consent, etc.): The major ity of data for this study will be 
collected and maintained electronically.  For participants without access to internet, we will collect consent and data 
using paper documents. The risks of breaching confidentiality for paper documents will be strictly limi ted by [CONTACT_410958], as well as the use of participant ID numbers rather than names whenever possible. 
Medical records containing PHI and research records are stored using the two -lock rule.  
Data and Safety Monitoring Pl an:  
Serious adverse events (SAE) and adverse evets will be monitored continuously throughout the study and will be 
reported to the DSMB and IRB according to pre -specified requirements. SAE/AE rates and interim study results will be 
reviewed and discussed by [CONTACT_165177].  
 
3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 
OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  JUSTIFICATION FOR ENDPOINT S 
Primary    
(a) Participants  randomized  to 
fluvoxamine  will have  a lower  rate 
of clinical  deterioration,  compared  
to their  respective  placebo s. (b) 
Participants  with  baseline  O2 
saturation  ≤96%  will have  a larger  
treatment  effect  size with  
fluvoxamine  (i.e.,  larger  
fluvoxamine -placebo  difference  in 
rate of clinical  deterioration)  than  
those  with  O2 saturation  ≥97%.  
 The primary  outcome  will be clinical  
deterioration , defined  as both of the 
following: (1) presence of dyspnea 
(SOB rating of 4+ on the twice daily 0 -
10 scale, and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410925], 
plus (2) decrease in O 2 saturation 
(<92% on room air via the twice -daily 
at-home self -monitoring or via 
monitoring at a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/ER/urgent 
care center, and/or supplemental 
oxygen requirement to keep O 2 
saturation ≥92%).   
Two blinded research staff will 
adjudicate all potential cases of 
clinical deterioratio n to confirm these 
criteria are (or are not) met.  
 The goal  of the study  is to test 
prevention  of clinical  
deterioration.   We chose  a clinical  
outcome  including  a laboratory -
confirmed  (ie SpO2)  endpoint,  
consistent  with  World Health 
Organization clinical t rial 
recommendations 
(https://www.who.int/blueprint/15 -
01-2020 -nfr-bp-wg-clinical -trials -
ncov.pdf?ua=1 ).   In our previous 
trial (STOP COVID), 6 participants 
met this endpoint; 5/6 went to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491] 4/6 were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410926] 10 days, 
demonstrating the clinical relevance 
of this endpoint . Although  we saw 
no mortality  and only  1 ventilator,  
mortality  from  COVID -19 is largely  
FLUVOXAMINE FOR EARLY TREATMENT OF COVID -19: A FULLY -REMOTE, RANDOMIZED PLACEBO CONTROLLED TRIAL  
  
 [ADDRESS_518183]  
contri butor  to death.  A focus  on 
clinical  deterioration  from  a 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_410927],  commonly  
observed  in COVID -19 patients  early  
on prior  to ventilator  need,  would  
be in line with  WHO’s  scale  and 
would  be consistent  with  an early  
deterioration  observed  in the 
clinical  course  of COVID -[ADDRESS_518184]  on outcome,  this is based  on 
observations  made  in our 
preliminary  study:  all 6 cases  of 
clinical  deterioration  (in the placebo  
group)  were  among  those  with  
baseline  O2 saturation  96%  or 
below.  
Secondary    
Participants  randomized  to 
fluvoxamine  will have  higher  post -
COVID  functional  status  at day [ADDRESS_518185] -
COVID  functioning  at 15 days  and at 
90 days  using  the PROMIS  Global  
Health  Scale.   This secondary  
outcome  reflects  the increasing  
concern  regarding  persistence  of 
COVID -19 illness  and functional  
impairment  in a substantial  
percentage  of individuals  with  
initially  “mild”  symptoms.  We will 
also explore  persistent  symptoms  of 
COVID -19 at these  timepoints.    
 It is increasingly clear that COVID -19 
is a persistent illness for some.  
Measuring this persistence is 
challenging because the symptoms 
are highly heterogeneous and 
temporally dynamic.  An alternative 
is to use a validated measure of 
functional status to assess whether 
fluvoxamine  results in an increased 
level of function and quality of life.  
The 10 -item PROMIS Global Health 
Scale is a validated measure of 
function and quality of life.  
Tertiary/Exploratory    
We will also explore symptoms of 
COVID -[ADDRESS_518186] severity ever of the 
symptom, and a 1 -10 scale for 
current severity of the symptom.  
 The long -term course of symptoms 
of COVID -19 is still poorly 
understood.  These data will 
provide additional information 
about COVID -19 symptoms and 
whether their persistence is 
influenced by [CONTACT_410959].

4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
Summary:  We propose a fully -remote US study: we will  screen, consent, deliver fluvoxamine/placebo and other supplies 
to (self -quarantined) patients, including thermometers, blood pressure cuffs, and O [ADDRESS_518187] data via participants’ phones/computers and via medical records.  We  will carry out national recruitment, similar 
to the University of Minnesota COVID -19 hydroxychloroquine trial s carried out in early 2020 .   
Hypotheses : 
Primary : 
Participants  randomized  to fluvoxamine  will have  a lower  rate of clinical  deterioration,  compared  to placebo.   
Secondary : 
Participants  randomized  to fluvoxamine  will have  higher  post -COVID  functional  status  at day 15 and day 90, compared  
to placebo.  
Partic ipants  with  baseline  O2 saturation  ≤96%  will have  a larger  treatment  effect  size (i.e.,  larger  fluvoxamine -placebo  
difference  in rate of clinical  deterioration)  than  those  with  O2 saturation  ≥97%.    
Phase:  3 
Design : randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blinded, parallel design, nationally -recruiting, fully -remote, multi -site. 
Methods to minimize bias : placebo control , blinding, randomization.  
 
Interim analyses planned : none.  
Stratification planned : sex, age.  
Study team: The complementary expertise of our group will assure the success of this clinical trial, as already evidenced 
by [CONTACT_410960].  
Eric Lenze, M.D., is a clinical trialist and geriatric psychiatrist.  He has success fully conducted numerous clinical trials, 
including large -scale trials.  He and his research team led the STOP COVID trial that randomized 152 individuals to 
fluvoxamine or placebo for early treatment of COVID -19 and demonstrated fluvoxamine’s efficacy at preventing clinical 
deterioration. He will lead this clinical trial along with his study team, overseeing all aspects of the research.  
Angela Reiersen, M.D., M.P.E., is a child psychiatrist and epi[INVESTIGATOR_410928], longitudinal course, and genetics (including pharmacogenetics) of various childhood -onset psychiatric 
disorders and a rare genetic disorder of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Wolfram Syndrome).  She developed the 
hypothesis regarding fluvoxamine’s  potential anti -inflammatory benefits in the treatment of COVID -19. [CONTACT_410970] 
hypothesized the potential anti -inflammatory effect may occur through fluvoxamine’s known actions on the S1R -
Inositol -requireing enzyme 1α (IRE1) pathway, which is a component  of the ER stress response. She initially became 
interested in S1R ligands years ago due to observed differences in anxiety/depression treatment response to SSRIs with 
varying S1R actions, which she saw among study participants with Wolfram Syndrome. Along  with [CONTACT_155371], she 
developed and oversaw the STOP COVID trial.  Her role in the proposed trial will include study design (with emphasis on 
development of appropriate symptom questionnaires and other outcome measures), supervision of study staff, 
interpre tation of findings based on knowledge of drug mechanisms, supervision of data analysis, and publication of 
results.

trials with national (and Canada) recruitment, including the hydroxychloroquine early treatment trial which randomized [ADDRESS_518190]. Boulware and his team has been advising the investigators

4.2 SCIENTIFIC R ATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
Rationale for study design: placebo control provides the highest level of rigor for efficacy and safety analyses.  A placebo 
control is both necessary and safe/ethical because of the lack of a widely -available standard of care treatment for early 
COVID -19 illness.  
 
 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DO SE 
Fluvoxamine: Participants receive a day zero dose of 50mg fluvoxamine (or matching placebo) in the evening 
immediately after the baseline assessment and confirmation of eligibility, and 100mg twice daily as tolerated, on days 1 -
15.  This dose range was determined based on fluvoxamine’s binding affinity for the S1R.  After 15 days, this study drug 
is stopped; there is no need to taper fluvoxamine (i.e.,  to prevent SSRI withdrawal) after only a brief course.  
The dosing target of 200mg (100mg twice daily) in the proposed study is also justified by [CONTACT_410961]. T hat preliminary study  used  a target of 100mg three times daily based on the FDA maximum dose of 
300mg/day, and based on a review of the S1R agonist activity at various doses of fluvoxamine  
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1766 2961/ ).  However, in STOP COVID almost all participants (86/90; 96%) in the 
fluvoxamine group achieved a dose of 200mg/day, but only 50% increa sed up to 300mg/day and of those that did, this 
was only after 5 -6 days’ treatment, which may have already been outside the period of greatest risk for clinical 
deterioration.  In other words, it did not appear necessary to reach 300mg/d.  We also reviewed  fluvoxamine’s 
pharmacokinetics and binding affinity at the S1R with several experts in pharmacology, who agreed that a maximum of 
200mg/d was sufficient for adequate binding of the S1R.   
 
4.4 END OF STUDY DEFINITION  
The end of the study is day 90, when the p articipant has completed the day 90 survey; or when the participant has 
withdrawn consent or was withdrawn by [CONTACT_978].  
 
5 STUDY POPULATION  
 
5.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA  
Inclusion criteria:   
1) Men and woman age 30 and older;  
2) Not currently hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]  
3) Proven SARS -CoV-2 positive (per lab or physician report).   Positive test is within 3 days prior to or during the current 
symptomatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
FLUVOXAMINE FOR EARLY TREATMENT OF COVID -19: A FULLY -REMOTE, RANDOMIZED PLACEBO CONTROLLED TRIAL  
  
 16 Note: Test positivity can be via participant self -report initially; however, sta ff will also attempt to  get confirmation (eg 
forwarded text from lab, photo of positive report, etc).  For randomized participants for who there is no confirmation , a 
pre-planned secondary analysis of outcome will be conducted without them . 
4) Currently sy mptomatic with one or more of the following symptoms: fever, cough, myalgia, mild dyspnea, chest pain, 
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anosmia (inability to smell), ageusia (inability to taste), sore throat , nasal congestion . 
5) Expectation, on screening, that  the participant will start study medication within 7 days of symptom onset.   
Note: participants who are randomized and then fail to start study medication by [CONTACT_4475] 7 of symptoms  will (or 
may) remain in the study and be managed and assessed just as other ra ndomized participants.  They will not be 
included in the modified intention to treat sample during data analysis.  
5) Able to provide informed consent.  
6) Upon initial screening, participant reports one of the following risk factors for clinical deteriorat ion: age≥40, 
racial/ethnic group African -American, Hispanic, South Asian, or Native American (including more than one race), or 1+ of 
the following medical conditions which increase risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_410929] -severe COVID illness: obesity, 
hypertension, diabetes, heart disease (coronary artery disease, history of myocardial infarction, or heart failure), lung 
disease (eg asthma, COPD), immune disorder (eg rheumatoid arthritis, lupus).  
 
5.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
Note: exclusions are same as in previous STOP COVID trial, but with additional exclusions for Coumadin and several 
other medications, based on recommendations of DSMB and co -investigators.  
1) Illness severe enough to require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410930]’s primary endpoint for clinical worsening (eg 
current O 2 saturation <92% on room air, current use of supplemental oxygen to maintain O 2 saturation ≥92%).  
Note: participants who are randomized and then found to meet clinical deterioration criteria at baseline – or 
meet deteriorat ion criteria prior to starting study medication - will (or may) remain in the study and be managed 
and assessed just as other randomized participants.  They will not be included in the modified intention to treat 
sample during data analysis.  
2) Unstable me dical comorbidities (eg decompensated cirrhosis), per patient report and/or medical records.  
3) Immunocompromised from the following: solid organ transplant, BMT,  high dose steroids (>20mg prednisone per 
day) , or tocilizumab  
4) Already enrolled in another  COVID 19 medication trial  (not including vaccination or prophylaxis trials ) 
5) Unable to provide informed consent  
6) Unable to perform the study procedures  
7) Taking donepezil (rationale: donepezil is a S1R agonist) , or sertraline (rationale: sertraline is a strong sigma -[ADDRESS_518192]) . 
8) Taking warfarin -also known as Coumadin (rationale: increased  risk of bleeding), phenytoin (rationale:  fluvoxamine 
inhibits its metabolism ), clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (rationale: fluvoxamine inhibits its metabolism from pro -drug to active drug which 
raises risk of cardiovascular events), and St John's wort  (rationale:  fluvoxamine + St John’s wort are considered 
contraindicated because of the risk of serotonin syndrome ) 
FLUVOXAMINE FOR EARLY TREATMENT OF COVID -19: A FULLY -REMOTE, RANDOMIZED PLACEBO CONTROLLED TRIAL  
  
 17 9)  Taking SSRIs, SNRIs, or tricyclic antidepressants, unless these are at a low dose such that a study  investigator 
concludes that a clinically significant interaction with fluvoxamine (ie either serotonin syndrome or TCA overdose) is 
unlikely  (examples: participant takes escitalopram but only at 5 -10mg daily; that dose plus 200mg fluvoxamine would be 
insufficient to cause serotonin syndrome; or, participant takes amitriptyline but only at 25mg nightly; even if 
fluvoxamine inhibits its metabolism, it would  be an insufficient dose to cause QTc prolongation or problematic side 
effects) . 
10) Individuals who report they have bipolar disorder or are taking medication for bipolar  disorder  (lithium, valproate, 
high -dose antipsychotic), unless the investigator conc ludes that the risk for mania is unlikely (ie it is doubtful that the 
patient actually has bipolar disorder).  
11) Individuals who take alprazolam or diazepam and are unwilling to cut the medication by 25% (rationale: fluvoxamine 
modestly inhibits the metab olism of these drugs ). 
12) Participants taking theophylline, tizanidine, clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], or olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (drugs with a narrow therapeutic index that are 
primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097] 1A2, which is inhibited by [CONTACT_410953]) will be reviewed with a study investigato r and 
excluded  unless the investi gator concludes that the risk to the participant is low ( this would be unlikely; example: 
participant takes tizanidine only as needed and is willing to avoid it for the 15 days of the study) . 
13) Received vaccine for COVID -19.  Rationale: COVID -19 vaccines may prevent serious illness.  Note that participants in 
vaccine trials are eligible, unless they know that they received the active vaccine.  
14) Individuals who are already taking an approved or investigational COVID -[ADDRESS_518193] already 
received monoclonal antibody treatment or convalescent plasma . (rationale:  these individuals are unlikely to 
develop serious COVID -19).

Individuals  who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) will be rescreened if they 
subsequently meet inclusion criteria.  The same subject number will be used .  
 
5.[ADDRESS_518195] Louis, and 
nationally. The catchment reflects a diversity of settings including urban and rural settings, creating a diverse sample .  
Study patients will be identified via a number of  strategies, chiefly those shown effective in the fully -remote 
hydroxychloroquine studies: advertisements, media, and social media.  As well, we will use strategies that were 
successful in the STOP COVID trial: using EHR, self -referral or through referrals  from individual physicians.  The research 
team, using interview with the potential participant and medical records review or discussion with the patient’s 
physician, will then screen for eligibility as per the inclusion/exclusion criteria below.  
Pre-screening and consent are conducted via REDCap surveys and telephone.  No in person visits are required.

6 STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) ADMINISTRATION  
 
6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION  DESCRIPTION  
 
Participants are randomized to  approximately 15 days of fluvoxamine or placebo . Study medications are matching oral 
capsules (taken twice daily).  The study medication is stopped after approximately 15 days.   The observation period for 
measuring the primary endpoint (clinical deterioration) is days 1 -15 (beginning as soon as the first dose of the study 
medication and ending on day 15).   
Sample size:  We propose to enroll approximately n=1,[ADDRESS_518196] one dose of study medication.  A modif ied intention -to-treat strategy 
is required because participants are shipped supplies and study medication (whereupon they are randomized) prior to 
their measuring oxygen saturation to confirm study eligibility.  In the preliminary study (STOP COVID), appr oximately 
20% of individuals who received study supplies were not in the intention to treat sample, mainly because study eligibility 
could not be confirmed.  
Randomization:  Patients are randomized 1:[ADDRESS_518197] with participan ts are blinded, including outcome assessors and 
investigators, as are participants themselves.  
6.1.2  DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION  
Participants receive a day zero dose of 50mg fl uvoxamine (or matching placebo) in the evening immediately after the 
baseline assessment  and confirmation of eligibility  (as is feasible; sometimes this dose is not taken until the next day) , 
and fluvoxamine 100mg (or placebo) twice daily as tolerated, on days 1 -15.  Fluvoxamine will be self -administered.  
 
6.2 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZA TION  AND BLINDING  
Participants and all study staff (except for the study statistician running the randomization, and the study staff putting 
study medication into the package to deliver to participant) are blinded.  This blinding is kept throughout the study until 
analyses of the primary endpoint are preliminarily conducted.   
 
Blocked randomization will also reduce the chance of bias.  Another strategy to reduce bias is that the primary endpoint, 
clinical deterioration, includes an objective component, oxygen saturation, wh ich may be less prone to an expectancy 
effect (vs. self -reported measures).   Blinded study staff will not have access to randomization assignment for 
participants. Study investigators will also be blinded.  
Treatment guess: Participants will make a treatmen t guess at the end of the [ADDRESS_518198] the adequacy of the blind.   
 
6.3 STUDY INTERVENTION  COMPLIANCE  
FLUVOXAMINE FOR EARLY TREATMENT OF COVID -19: A FULLY -REMOTE, RANDOMIZED PLACEBO CONTROLLED TRIAL  
  
 19 Participant data, including IP compliance, will be collected via REDCap daily surveys.    Each day the survey will ask the 
participant how many fluvoxamine (vs placebo) capsules they took.  
 
 
 
7 STUDY INTERVENTION  DISCONTINUATION  AND PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  
 
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTION  
Management of participants who clinically deteriorate and/or are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410931]:  We will make every effort to continue the study intervention throughout the 15 -day period if patients are not 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], or if they are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410932].   However, we will not exclude 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410933] -directed treatments (e.g., remdesivir, dexamethasone, convalescent 
plasma).   For patients who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410934] d show deterioration, such patients will discontinue fluvoxamine/placebo, 
with the rationale that this study’s main goal is test whether fluvoxamine prevents deterioration, and in such cases, the 
participant will have met this study’s primary endpoint (i.e ., the prevention has “failed”).   They  would  be eligible  for any 
studies  of treatments  for serious  COVID.   We will continue to collect data including day -15 and day -90 data under the 
intention -to-treat principle, as well as the rationale that fluvoxamine m ay improve longer -term outcomes even in cases 
that it fails to prevent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .56  
 
Discontinuation from fluvoxamine or placebo  does not mean discontinuation from the study, and remaining study 
procedures should be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_410962].   If a clinically sig nificant finding 
is identified ( including, but not limited to changes from baseline) after enrollment, the investigator or quali fied designee 
will determine if any change in participant management is needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as 
an adverse event (AE) . 
 
The data that we will attempt to collect  at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the following:  
• Vital signs, including O2 saturation,  pulse,  blood pressure and temperature.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410935].  
 
 
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  FROM THE STUDY  
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_410936] a participa nt from  the study for the following reasons : 
 
• Participant is not contributing data and/or appears to be lost to follow -up. 
• If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs such 
that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant  or interferes with 
the integrity of the study data.  
• Disease progression which requires discontinuation of the study intervention  
• If the participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously recognized) that 
precludes further study participation  
 
 
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
FLUVOXAMINE FOR EARLY TREATMENT OF COVID -19: A FULLY -REMOTE, RANDOMIZED PLACEBO CONTROLLED TRIAL  
  
 20 Outcome Assessments: The primary endpoint will be clinical deterioration  of COVID -19 illness. The secondary endpoint 
will be day 15 and day 90 functioning.  
Clinical deterioration  is defined meeting both  of the following: (1) presence of dyspnea and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410925], plus (2) decrease in O 2 saturation (<92%) on room air and/or supplemental oxygen 
requirement in order to keep O 2 saturation ≥92 %.  
The primary method of assessment for these outcomes is participants’ reports on twice -daily surveys throughout the 15 -
day randomized period, corrob orated by [CONTACT_3647] (e.g., calling participants when low oxygen saturation was 
reported).  For participants who stop answering the surveys prior to day 15, as well as those who appear to be meeting 
the primary endpoint, we will use , as is feasible,  medical records and subsequent calls to these participants and their 
family to determine whether they sought medical care for shortness of breath or hypoxia.  We will also confirm medical 
care needed (e.g., supplemental oxygen, length of stay, ventilator sup port)  as is feasible .    
We will collect sufficient data on all participants to also measure the clinical deterioration on the World Health 
Administration COVID -19 clinical trial outcome scale: 0 -1: ambulatory (no clinical deterioration during RCT phase), 2: 
limitation of activities but no hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 3: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410937] O 2 needed; 4: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], O 2 needed; 5: non -
invasive ventilation or high -flow oxygen; 6: ventilator needed; 7: ventilator plus organ support needed; 8: death.  Scale 
can be found on p6 of: https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority -diseases/key -action/COVID -
19_Treatment_Trial_Design_Master_Protocol_synopsis_Final_18022020.pdf . Since ordinal scales have proved useful in 
studies of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410938], this measure will be particularly helpful as an outcome 
measure for the subset of study participants who require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. This cross -walk with the WHO scale is also 
useful given that our primary outcome is a study -specific scale.  
The secondary endpoint will be functioning at day 15 and day 90, measured by [CONTACT_941] 10 -item PROMIS Global Health Scale 
(“Global -10”).    This scale’s items  assess general domains of health and functioning including overall physical health, 
mental health, social health, pain, fatigue, and o verall perceived quality of life. The [ADDRESS_518199] been reported in the literature to date on a 0 -10 scale (0= absent; 10=sever e).  
Data collection and participant interaction specifics: All interactions with participants will be fully -remote via 
phone/text/email/videoconference.  Data collection is done by [CONTACT_27656] -daily REDCap surveys sent to patients via email, 
with telephone -based data collection as a back -up to ensure that individuals wi thout internet access are able to 
participate.  The surveys record oxygen saturation, vital signs, medication adherence, and COVID -19 symptoms.  Fixed 
race and ethnicity categories are collected by [CONTACT_410963].  The surveys measure dyspnea (shortness of breath) using a continuous 0 -10 scale (0= symptom not present, 
10= symptom is very severe) via the technique of Ecological Momentary Assessment (i.e., “how bad is your symptom 
right now?”).  Phone contact [CONTACT_410964]’ questions 
and concerns such as medication -related issues, and throughout the trial to remind them to complete assessments as 
necessary.  Additional phone cal ls are conducted on a case -by-case basis when participants’ survey data indicate out of 
range values (e.g., low O 2 saturation) and to recheck and confirm these as necessary. This messaging will also be 
displayed  when participants enter out of range values  online for the baseline and daily surveys . Also, for participants 
who appear to be having worsening COVID -[ADDRESS_518200] assessment of safety will be conducted at screening.  Research staff will, via telephone, determine whether 
participants meet eligibility criteria and what are their medical conditions and medications.  This information will be 
FLUVOXAMINE FOR EARLY TREATMENT OF COVID -19: A FULLY -REMOTE, RANDOMIZED PLACEBO CONTROLLED TRIAL  
  
 21 provided to the study physician investigator to concur with enrollment, prior to starting any stu dy medication.  For 
example, if participants are taking an SSRI or a medication of concern for interaction with fluvoxamine (e.g., olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), 
this will need to be reviewed by [CONTACT_410965].   
 
The second assessment of safety is conducted when study materials (including pulse oximeter, blood pressure cuff, and 
thermometer).  Participants will report on their O2 saturation, vital signs, and current symptoms , via electronic survey , 
prior to starting study medication.  
 
The third assessment of safety is throughout days [ADDRESS_518201] a phone visit with study staff daily on days 1-3.  Additional phone calls will be as 
needed (e.g., to confirm out of bounds values on O2 saturation or vitals, and to advise participants whether to call their 
provider or go to an emergency room).  
 
Medical records, if available, will be used to supplement each of these assessments.  
   
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
 
 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
A formal Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP) will be completed prior to database lock and unblinding of the study data.  It will 
include any additional details regarding the strategies described in this section.   
The primary hypotheses (superiority hypotheses) are: 
Participants  randomized  to fluvoxamine  will have  a lower  rate of clinical  deterioration,  compared  to placebo.  (Null:  
participants  randomized  to fluvoxamine  will not have  a lower  rate of clinical  deterioration,  compared  to placebo)  
• Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  
 
Participants  will meet  the primary  endpoint  of clinical  deterioration  at the point  that  they  meet  both  of the following: 
(1) presence of dyspnea and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410939], plus (2) decrease in O 2 saturation 
(<92% on room air and/or supplemental oxygen requirement to keep O 2 saturation ≥92%).  This will be measured during 
study days 1 -15. The primary source of information to ascertain this endpoint is the twice -daily survey which is carried 
out on study days 1 -15; this survey includes participant  self-report of  their shortness of breath (dyspnea) rating on a 0 -
10 scale (wher e a score of [ADDRESS_518202] part of this endpoint) and 
of their pulse oximeter reading (where a reading of <92% meets the second part of this endpoint).  Study staff will 
confirm the pulse oximeter rea dings with participants via phone when possible, asking them to re -check, and will call 
participants to collect these data via telephone if surveys have been skipped.   Other data sources for this endpoint 
include participant and/or family report, or medic al records data, regarding medical care received, during study days 1 -
15, in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/ER/urgent care center.  
 
The secondary hypotheses (also superiority hypotheses) are:  
Participants  randomized  to fluvoxamine  will have  higher  post -COVID  functional  statu s at day 15 and day 90, compared  
to placebo.  
• Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s):  
FLUVOXAMINE FOR EARLY TREATMENT OF COVID -19: A FULLY -REMOTE, RANDOMIZED PLACEBO CONTROLLED TRIAL  
  
 [ADDRESS_518203] 80% power to detect a treatment 
effect of 35% reduction (20% in placebo vs. 13% in fluvoxamine).  Two -tailed a lpha=0.05 for this power analysis, as time 
to clinical deteriora tion is the primary analysis and endpoint.   
The basis for the assumption of 20% meeting the clinical deterioration endpoint (in the placebo group) is the enrichment 
strategy for this trial, in which participants must indicate, on screening, at least one r isk factor for clinical deterioration 
(e.g., age, medical condition).  
The basis for the assumption of 35% reduction: (1) 35% would be a clinically meaningful relative risk reduction in a high -
risk group; (2) a 35% relative risk reduction is what has been reported with corticosteroids such as dexamethasone when 
given in more serious COVID -19. 
To achieve n=[ADDRESS_518204] 
20% dropout/ineligible from the time of shippin g/couriering study supplies to the first dose of medication, as in the 
preliminary clinical trial.  The main reason for dropout/ineligibility in the preliminary  study was that we were unable to 
confirm study entry criteria, which included a baseline O 2 saturation of 92% or greater.   This level of dropout/withdrawal 
after consent and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_410940].  
This sample size has suitable power for the secondary endpoint analysis (function at day 15 and day 90).  For a simple t -
test between two groups, n=400 each (allowing for dropout), we can detect a difference of 0.[ADDRESS_518205] deviations 
(Fleiss’ d) with a po wer of 80%; i.e., a small effect size.  
The examination of persistent symptoms at day 15 and day 90 will be exploratory only; the analytic plan will depend on 
the structure of the data collected.  Therefore no power analysis was conducted for this explorato ry examination.  
The moderator  hypothesis  is: Participants  with  baseline  O2 saturation  ≤96%  will have  a larger  treatment  effect  size (i.e.,  
larger  fluvoxamine -placebo  difference  in rate of clinical  deterioration)  than  those  with  O2 saturation  ≥97%.  
This moderator  hypothesis  is consistent  with  the strategy  of prognostic  enrichment , and our methodology  and analytic  
strategy  follows  the FDA guidance  on prognostic  enrichment,  found  in https://www.fda.gov/regulatory -
information/search -fda-guidance -documents/enrichment -strategies -clinical -trials -support -approval -human -drugs -and-
biological -products . 
The test for moderation  is a test of the interaction  between  treatment  and baseline  O2 saturation  (dichotomized  as 
≤96%  vs. ≥97%).   
Power  for this moderator  hypothesis:  We have  at least  80%  power  at p=0.[ADDRESS_518206]  size modulation  such  that 
in the low-risk group  (baseline  O2 saturation  ≥97%)  there  was a treatment  odds  ratio  of 1 (e.g.,  equal  proportions  of 
FLUVOXAMINE FOR EARLY TREATMENT OF COVID -19: A FULLY -REMOTE, RANDOMIZED PLACEBO CONTROLLED TRIAL  
  
 23 deterioration  in both  fluvoxamine  and placebo  groups),  while  in the high -risk group  (baseline  O2 saturation≤96%)  there  
was a treatment  odds  ratio  of 0.4 (i.e.,  12%  deterior ation  in the fluvoxamine  group  vs. 26%  in the placebo  group).  
This is not a power calculation for the moderation per se, but is an example of a moderation effect which could be 
detected. The odds ratios and the standard error of the log odds ratio are base d on the usual formulas, e.g.   
OR = *x11*x22)/(x21*x12)   
SE(log(OR)) = sqrt(1/x11 + 1/x22 + 1/x21 + 1/x12)   
as is a simple Z test of the difference between the odds ratios and its P value.   
 
 
 
9.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
. 
 
9.3.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
• For descriptive statistics, categorical data will be presented as n (percentage), and continuous data will be 
presented  as means with standard deviations,  or median  with interquartile  range.  
• For all inferential tests, p-value will be 0.05 with 95% confide nce intervals reported, all two -tailed.  
• Any covariates will be  specified at the time of conducting analyses, but prior to unblinding . 
• The primary analysis requires no checks for normality; the secondary endpoint analysis will require a check of 
normality a nd corrective procedures  will be applied  (e.g., transformation or nonparametric tests).  
• We will use SAS 9.4 for analyses.  
 
 
9.3.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
The primary analysis is survival analysis of the primary outcome (clinical deteriorati on).  This analysis treats participants 
as censored on the day that they meet the primary outcome, or on the last day that they fill out an outcome 
assessment. It is superior to an exact test of proportions because of the ability to handle missing data (du e to dropout or 
meeting endpoint).  
 
Findings will be reported as the rates of clinical deterioration in groups  (i.e., fluvoxamine vs. placebo ), the absolute 
difference in the endpoint, the logrank chi square, and the respective p -value.  
 
No imputation for missing data will be used.  However, for all participants who do not complete surveys through day 15, 
we will use follow -up phone calls and medical records to ascertain whether they met the endpoint (e.g., were 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410941]).  
 
 
9.3.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
Because of the potential for type 1 error due to multiple comparisons, findings for analyses of secondary endpoint 
(global function at day 15 and 90) should be interpreted as exploratory.  The analyses will proceed regardless of findings 
of primary endpoint . 
 
The measurement is the summary of the [ADDRESS_518207] a normal distribution.  It will be 
examined separately at days 15 and 90 rather than as a repeated measure.  The scale is not measured at baseline, so the 
FLUVOXAMINE FOR EARLY TREATMENT OF COVID -19: A FULLY -REMOTE, RANDOMIZED PLACEBO CONTROLLED TRIAL  
  
 [ADDRESS_518208] or AN COVA (if covariates are used) between intervention and placebo at these time points (day 
15, day 90).  
 
No imputation for missing data will be used.  
 
 
10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 REGULATORY, ETHICA L, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  
 
 
 
10.1.1  FUTURE USE OF STORED SPECIMENS AND DATA  
Data collected for this study will be analyzed and stored at Washington University.   After the study is completed, the de -
identified, archived data will be stored at Washington University  for use by [CONTACT_199813]. Permission to transmit data to other researchers  will be included in the informed consent.  
 
10.1.2  SAFETY OVERSIGHT  
We will appoint DSMB members who are not involved in the study (i.e., as investigators). The board will include 
individuals with expertise important to this trial who will be responsible for overseeing the safety of participants and 
overseeing that the trial’s conduct.  
The DSMB will meet, at intervals determined by [CONTACT_4318], du ring the study (e.g., prior to start of recruitment, various 
times during recruitment phase, and as needed).  They will review study processes such as screening rate, enrollment 
rate, follow -up rate, dropout rate, demographics of enrolled sample, baseline clinical data, and participant safety. The 
primary safety measure will be AE reports.  
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_518209], data collection, documentation and 
completion.   
 
Quality control ( QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data QC checks that will 
be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated to the site(s) for 
clarification/resolut ion. 
 
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, and reports for the 
purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_456], and inspection by [CONTACT_410966].

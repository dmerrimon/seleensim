Rationale
Study  201312 is a study  of subcutaneousl y (SC) administered mepolizumab [ADDRESS_950114] of care (SOC) onl y.
Objectives
Primary  Objective
To provide extended treatment with mepolizumab to subjects with a history of life -
threatening or seriously  debilitating asthma an d a history  of improved disease control 
while receiving mepolizumab as defined by [CONTACT_3181].
Secondary  Objective
To further describe the long -term clinical experience of mepolizumab in a subset of 
subjects who demonstrated significant clinical benefit since receiving mepolizumab 
Stud y Design
This is a multi -center, open -label, long -term study of mepolizumab 100mg administered 
SC, in addition to standard of care (SOC), in subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma. 
Only  subjects who complete the MEA115661 Exit Visit (Visit 14) will be offered the 
opportunity  to consent for this study . Subjects meeting all of the eligibility  criteria will be 
offered the opportunit y to consent for this study of up to 1 72weeks .  
It is expected that the majority  of eligible subjects will enter 201312 within 8 weeks of 
completing the Exit Visit (Visit 14) in MEA115661.  
To reduce the burden of repeated procedures during the ending of MEA115661 and the 
start of 201312, subjects will start the study  according to a specific “sce nario”.  This 
depends on when their Visit 1 occurs in relation to the Visit 14 of the MEA115661 study . 
Scenario 1 is w hen Visit 1 of 201312 is performed on the same day  (or less than or equal 
to 8 weeks) from when Visit 14 of study  MEA115661 is performed.
Scenario 2a is when Visit 1 of 201312 is performed greater than 8 weeks after Visit 14 
of MEA115661 AND when Visit 1 of 201312 is performed on the same day as the 
Follow -up visit (Visit 15) of study  MEA115661. 
2013N1879 87_04 CONFIDENTIA L
201312
12Scenario 2b is when Visit 1 of 201312 is performed greater than 8 weeks after Visit 14 
of MEA115661 AND Visit 1 of 201312 is performed after the Follow -up visit (Visit 15) 
of study  MEA115661 has taken place.
All applicable procedures for scenario 1, and 2a and 2b subjects are listed in Section 6.1. 
Critical Baseline Assessments.  
All eligible subjects should be enrolled into 201312 within 4 weeks of receiving all 
applicable approvals.
After giving informed consent for this study , eligibility  will be asse ssed via multiple 
evaluations, including physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and 
an updated medical history . Subjects whose health status remains appropriate for the 
study  will then be assessed based on the inclusion and exclusion c riteria. Those subjects 
meeting all study  eligibility  requirements will receive their first dose of mepolizumab at 
Visit 1. Mepolizumab will then be administered approximately  every  [ADDRESS_950115] dose at Week 16 8(Visit 43).  Forty  three doses willprovide therapeutic coverage for 
172 weeks ([ADDRESS_950116] dose). Subjects will continue to receive 
mepolizumab 100mg SC injections for up to 172 weeks or until one of the following 
occurs: 
the risk/benefit profile for the subject is no longe r positive in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_699855]
the subject’s ph ysician withdraws the subject or
the subject withdraws consent or
the sponsor discontinues development of mepolizumab or
the sponsor discontinues the study  in the relevant participating co untry  or
mepolizumab becomes commercially  available in the local country .
The study  closure process will begin, on a country by  [CONTACT_619291] ,as mepolizumab
becomes commerciall y available for prescription.  Some subjects will complete the 
original 120 w eek treatment period (as specified in the previous protocol) prior to 
mepolizumab being available for prescription.  To ensure these subjects do not have a 
treatment gap the treatment period will be extended for an additional [ADDRESS_950117] of care asthma therap y throughout the study . Asthma 
medications may  be adjusted at any  time during the study  at the discretion of the 
investigator. All changes in asthma therap y will be captured in the source documents and 
the electronic case report form (eCRF). At each clinic visit, adverse events will be 
assessed and subjects will be questioned regarding the occurrence of an y exacerbations 
since their last clinic visit. The Asthma Control Questionnaire -5 (ACQ -5) will be 
performed every  12 weeks during the study andat the Exit/Early  Withdrawal Visit to 
assist the investigator in monitoring the subject’s asthma status along with spi[INVESTIGATOR_699856]  6 months and at the Exit/Early  Withdrawal Visit. 
2013N1879 87_04 CONFIDENTIA L

13Safety  labs (hematology , chemistry , and liver analy tes) will be drawn at Visit [ADDRESS_950118]’s last dose of mepolizumab. Serum samples for anti -
mepolizu mab antibody  measurements will also be obtained from subjects at baseline 
(Visit 1), Weeks 48, 96, 144 andat the Exit Visit/Earl y Withdrawal Visit. Any serum 
sample testing positive for anti- mepolizumab antibody  will also be tested for neutralizing 
antibo dy. Subjects discontinuing mepolizumab treatment will be monitored for 
exacerbation of their asthma during the subsequent 4weeks after their last dose.

[ADDRESS_950119]  inflammation seen in asthma and are considered a central cause in the 
pathogenesis of asthma [ Wardlaw , 2000]. The expression of interleukin (IL) -5 is elevated 
in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and bronchial biopsies in patients with asthma 
[Hamid, 1991]. Moreover, the level of IL -5 in BAL fluid and the bronchial mucosa 
correlates with disease severity  [Robinson , 1992; Robinson , 1993; Humbert , 1997]. The 
cytokine IL -5 promotes eosinophil differentiation, recruitment, and survival [ Clutterbuck, 
1989; Wang , 1989]. Thus, a therapeutic st rategy  which blocks IL -5, thereby  [CONTACT_699887], may  have therapeutic benefit in asthma.
Currently  available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_699858] y effective at controlling asthma s ymptoms and 
airway  inflammation in the majority of patients [ Bateman , 2004]. 
Severe refractory  
asthma encompasses wide ranges in both clinical symptoms and in natural history . This 
population can be defined on the basis of medication requirements, asthma sy mptoms, 
degree of airflow li mitation, and frequency  of asthma exacerbations. In terms of 
exacerbations, three or more steroid -treated exacerbations have been considered part of 
the ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_699859] [ ATS , 2000].
Inhaled corticosteroids reduce airway  inflammation and sputum eosinophils in most 
asthmatics [ Kips , 2002]. However, a proportion of asthma patients remain uncontrolled 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_699860] c orticosteroids (ICS) or I CS with 
additional controller therapy  [National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) 
Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Asthma [ NHLBI , 2007]; Global I nitiative 
for Asthma guideline s [GINA , 2008] . This severe, uncontrolled, refractory  population 
suffers from persistent s ymptoms and acute exacerbations of their asthma. 
Patients with severe asthma have significant morbidity  and mortality  risk; they contribute 
disproportionately  to health care and societal costs of the disease with particularl y high 
costs occurring in those with frequent exacerbations. I n MEA112997, subjects had 
features of severe, refractory asthma, as described in the American Thor acic Society  
(ATS) workshop on refractory  asthma [ ATS , 2000], and also demonstrated markers of 
eosinophilic inflammation [ Pavord, 2012]. Together, these criteria were useful to iden tify 
a severe eosinophilic asthma population that continued to exacerbate despi[INVESTIGATOR_699861] y with currentl y marketed asthma medications. This severe, eosinophilic 
population is the subset of asthmatics most likely  to benefit from treatment with 
mepoli zumab. 
Subjects who are eligible for participation in [ADDRESS_950120] 12 months.
1.2. Rationale
Study  201312 is a study  of subcutaneousl y (SC) administered mepolizumab 100mg that 
will enroll a subset of subjects from Study  MEA115661 who have demonstrated clear 
benefit from therap y and who w ithout continuation of mepolizumab therapy  are 
individuals at greatest risk of serious deterioration of their health status. In order to target 
individuals at greatest risk for serious deterioration of their health status, only  subjects 
from the MEA115661 study  with a history  of life -threatening or seriousl y debilitating 
asthma, as defined b y this protocol, will be allowed to participate in Study  201312. 
Providing treatment to these subjects offers the opportunity  to extend the collection of 
clinical data f or long -term use and further assess the sustainability  of efficacy  in a 
population likely  to experience significant loss of asthma control and the need for higher 
doses of sy stemic steroids if returned to standard of care (SOC) onl y.
1.3. Benefit:Risk Assessment
Summaries of findings from both clinical and non-clinical studies conducted with 
mepolizumab (SB240563) can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.
Serious adverse events (SAEs) reported from ongoing clinical studies with mepolizumab 
are reviewed dail yby [CONTACT_699888]. Additionally , regular, sy stematic 
reviews of emerging safety  data from all clinical studies are conducted by  [CONTACT_28920] -house 
multi disciplinary  Safet y Review Team (SRT) which provides a central and dedicated 
forum for review of emerging data which could impact subject safet y. The SRT, which 
includes the project Medical Monitor, other ph ysicians assigned to the project, clinical 
scientists and a statistician reviews blinded and unblinded (i.e., from open -label trials) 
safet y data from ongoing clinical studies with mepolizumab on a regular basis and 
conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the safet y data upon completion of each stud y. 
Moreover, an integrated anal ysis of safety  across the program is completed annually  
when additional safety  data are available from completed studies. A reassessment of 
benefit risk and the current Developmental Core Safet y Information (DCSI) is completed 
at each SRT meeting subsequent to review of new data. 
Additionally , an adjudication committee will be utilized during the study to assess 
cardiovascular events. There is also a standard and comprehensive process for the 
reporting and management of Sentinel Events. (A Sentinel Event is an SAE that is not 
necessarily  drug -related, but that has been associ ated historically  with adverse reactions 
for other drugs, and is therefore worthy  of heightened pharmacovigilance. Sentinel 
Events include acquired long QT s yndrome, agranulocy tosis, anaph ylactic and 
anaph ylactoid reactions, hepatotoxicity , renal failure, seizures, and Stevens Johnson 
syndrome/toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_23936].) Subsequent to the reporting of a Sentinel Event, 
the Medical Monitor promptly  notifies the SRT and the [COMPANY_004] Global Safety  Board and 
leads a thorough and comprehensive follow -up of the Senti nel Event with collection of 
all relevant data.

Risk of Immunogenicity Biopharmaceutical products 
may elicit anti -drug antibody 
(ADA) and neutralizing 
antibody (NAB), which have 
the pot ential to modulate 
pharmacokinetic (PK), 
pharmacodynamic (PD) or 
produce adverse reactions. 
However, humanized and fully 
human antibodies are less 
immunogenic than mouse or 
chimeric monoclonal 
antibodies.
Immunogenicity data reported 
to date across the Blood samples are collected in 
clinical studies for detection of 
both ADA and NAB.

Potential risk for adverse 
cardiova scular (CV) effectsMepolizumab binding was 
restricted to human lymphoid 
tissues in an 
immunohistochemistry tissue 
binding study suggesting a 
low likelihood of non-
pharmacologic effects on 
cardiovascular (CV) function. 
No AEs concerning cardiac 
conduction or repolarization 
evident in cynomolgus 
monkeys at doses at least 10 -
fold in excess of humans 
dosed at 10 mg/kg or 750 mg.
No clinically relevant trends 
observed in ECG data in 
humans.
In one study in subjects with 
severe refractory asthma, 
cardiac events were reported 
in similar frequencies across 
treatment groups with a small 
numerical increase observed in 
serious ischemic cardiac 
events in the mepolizumab -
treated groups. However, an 
integrated safety analysis of all 
placebo -controlled multiple 
dose asthma trials showed 
similar frequency of SAEs 
reported overall from the 
cardiac and vascular system 
organ class (SOC). Daily monitoring of SAE by

CV monitoring for study 
includes:
ECG monitoring during

Use of standardized CRFs 
to collect relevant data on 
CV events of interest (i.e., 
myocardial infarction, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_699862],

18Potential Risk of Clinical 
SignificanceData/ Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy
Additionally, similar findings 
were observed in other SOCs 
with thrombotic events (e.g., 
stroke in the Nervous System 
SOC). Data from 2 
subsequently completed 
placebo -controlled severe 
asthma trials did not show an 
increased risk of serious 
ischemic cardiac events; there 
were no new reports in any 
treatment groups including 
placebo.
Potential risk for increase in 
infections – a theoretical 
concern with biologics; 
however, the pharmacological 
properties of mepolizumab 
suggest the risk is low.No evidence of increased 
incidence of infections in any 
preclinical studies.
Murine data demonstrate that 
IL-5 antagonism is unlikely to 
influence cellular or humoral 
immunity, particularly in 
response to parasitic 
infections.  
No mepolizumab -related 
effects on lymphocyte 
Immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_699863], including 
T-cell activation, distribution 
of CD4/CD8 subtypes or 
Th1/Th2 cytokine patterns, B -

An integrated safety analysis 
of all placebo -controlled 
multiple dose asthma trials 
showed SAEs reported in the 
infection and infestation SOC 
were 5/345 (1%) in placebo

1.3.2. Benefit A ssessment
Study  [ADDRESS_950122] one y ear’s treatment with mepolizumab 
(Study  MEA115661) in addition to standard of care asthma treatment. This study  will 
assess the incidence of adverse events and the rate of exacerbations to establish the long -
term safet y and sustained efficacy  of the treatmen t in this population.
Exacerbations are a major concern to asthma patients and lead to a worsening of the 
quality  of life for subjects. I nterventions in at risk populations that can reduce or 
eliminate serious exacerbations will improve a patient’s quality of life and may  reduce 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. Subjects participating in this study will be required to attend visits 
approximately  every  [ADDRESS_950123] asthma care.
1.3.3. Overall Benefit:Ris k Conclusion
Data from mepolizumab preclinical and clinical development demonstrate the ability  of 
mepolizumab to inhibit IL -5 and, consequently , treat inflammatory  conditions linked to 
an eosinophilic signal, such as asthma subjects predisposed to exacerb ations. To date, the 
safet y profile of mepolizumab across other mepolizumab studies has been favorable for 
all the patient populations studied. Adverse events (AEs) reported commonly  have been 
manageable with minimal medical intervention. Furthermore, prec linical data and the 
observed safet y profile to date in over [ADDRESS_950124] one year in this patient population already , has not 
identified a safety  concern that would preclude continued use. Therefore, investigation of 
the long- term safety , efficacy , and tolerability  of mepolizumab is thereby [CONTACT_699889]  201312.

Primary  Objective
To provide extended treatment with mepolizumab to subjects with a history of life -
threat ening or seriously  debilitating asthma and a history  of improved disease control 
while receiving mepolizumab as defined b y this protocol
Secondary  Objective
To further describe the long -term clinical experience of mepolizumab in a subset of 
subjects who de monstrated significant clinical benefit since receiving mepolizumab

3.1. Stud y Design
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed with the exception of immediate safety  
concerns. Therefore, adherence to the stud y design requirements, in cluding those 
specified in the Time and Events Table, are essential and required for stud y conduct. 
This is a multi -center, open -label, long -term study of mepolizumab 100mg administered 
SC, in addition to standard of care (SOC), in subjects with severe eo sinophilic asthma. 
Only  subjects who complete the MEA115661 Exit Visit (Visit 14) will be offered the 
opportunity  to consent for this study . Subjects meeting all of the eligibility  criteria for the 
study  will be offered the opportunity  to consent for this study  of up to 172 weeks in 
length.  
It is expected that the majority  of eligible subjects will enter 201312 within 8 weeks of 
completing the Exit Visit (Visit 14) in MEA115661.  
To reduce the burden of repeated procedures during the ending of MEA115661 and the 
start of 201312, subjects will start the study  according to a specific “scenario”.  This 
depends on when their Visit 1 occurs in relation to the Visit 14 of the MEA115661 study . 
Scenario 1 is w hen Visit 1 of 201312 is performed on the same day  (orless than or equal 
to 8 weeks) from when Visit 14 of study  MEA115661 is performed. 
Scenario 2a is when Visit 1 of 201312 is performed greater than 8 weeks after Visit 14 
of MEA115661 AND when Visit 1 of 201312 is performed on the same day as the 
Follow -up visit (Visit 15) of study  MEA115661. 
Scenario 2b is when Visit 1 of 201312 is performed greater than 8 weeks after Visit 14 
of MEA115661 AND Visit 1 of 201312 is performed after the Follow -up visit (Visit 15) 
of study  MEA115661 has taken place.
All appl icable procedures for scenario 1, and 2a and 2b subjects are listed in Section 6.1. 
Critical Baseline Assessments.  
All eligible subjects should be enrolled into 201312 within 4 weeks of receiving all 
applicabl e approvals.

22After giving informed consent for this study , eligibility  will be assessed via multiple 
evaluations, including physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and 
an updated medical history . Subjects whose health status remains appropriate for the 
study  will then be assessed based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Those subjects 
meeting all of the eligibility  requirements will receive their first dose of mepolizumab at 
Visit 1. Mepolizumab will be administered approximately  every [ADDRESS_950125] 
dose at Week 16 8(Visit 43).  Forty three doses will provide therapeutic coverage for 172
weeks ([ADDRESS_950126] dose). Subjects will then continue to receive 
mepolizumab 100mg SC injections for up to 172 weeks or unti l one of the following 
occurs: 
the risk/benefit profile for the subject is no longer positive in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_699855]
the subject’s ph ysician withdraws the subject or
the subject withdraws consent or
the sponsor discontinues development o f mepolizumab or
the sponsor discontinues the study  in the relevant participating country  or
mepolizumab becomes commercially  available in the local country .
The study  closure process will begin, on a country by  [CONTACT_619291], as mepolizumab 
becomes com merciall y available for prescription.  Some subjects will complete the 
original 120 week treatment period (as specified in the previous protocol) prior to 
mepolizumab being available for prescription.  To ensure these subjects do not have a 
treatment gap t he treatment period will be extended for an additional [ADDRESS_950127] of care asthma therap y throughout the study . Asthma 
medication may  be adjusted at an y time during the study at the discretion of the 
investigator. All changes in asthma therap y will be captured in the source documents and 
the electronic case report form (eCRF). At each clinic visit, adverse events will be 
assessed and subjects will be questioned regarding the occurrence of an y exacerbat ions 
since their last clinic visit. The Asthma Control Questionnaire -5 (ACQ -5) will be 
performed every  12 weeks during the study andat the Exit/Early  Withdrawal Visit to 
assist the investigator in monitoring the subject’s asthma status along with spi[INVESTIGATOR_699864]  6 months and at the Exit/Early  Withdrawal Visit. 
Safety  labs (hematology , chemistry , liver anal ytes) will be drawn at Visit [ADDRESS_950128] dose of mepolizumab. Serum samples for anti -
mepolizumab antibody  measurements will also be obtained from subjects at baseline 
(Visit 1), Weeks 48, 96 144 and at the Exit Visit/Early Withdrawal Visit. Any serum 
sample testing positive for a nti-mepolizumab antibody  will also be tested for neutralizing 
antibody . Subjects discontinuing mepolizumab treatment will be monitored for 
exacerbation of their asthma during the subsequent [ADDRESS_950129] inform ation not mandated to be present in this protocol is 
provided in the accompany ing Study  Procedures Manual (SPM). The SPM will provide 
the site personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does not 
impact subject safet y.
3.2. Discussion of Design
The design for this study  is an open -label continuation of treatment to allow and 
characterize longer -term experience in subjects with severe asthma who completed the 
MEA115661 study  (through Visit 14). Subjects must have a history  of life -threat ening 
asthma and received significant clinical benefit from mepolizumab for one year or more. 
As mepolizumab is administered approximately  every  4 weeks, this design will achieve 
the objectives of the study  by [CONTACT_699890]. 
The dose for Stud y 201312, mepolizumab 100mg SC, will be a continuation of the same 
dose administered in MEA115661. The dose rationale for the mepolizumab 100mg SC 
dose is based on the efficacy  and safet y profile observed in the MEA1129 97 study  and is 
additionally  supported b y a PK/PD model developed for mepolizumab. The MEA112997 
study  investigated a 10 -fold dose range with doses of 75mg, 250mg, and 750mg 
administered intravenously  (IV) every  4 weeks. All three doses resulted in a clini cally  
significant reduction in the frequency  of severe exacerbations when compared to placebo, 
with a reduction of 48% occurring in the 75mg treatment arm. These three doses also 
produced a marked and sustained suppression of blood eosinophils throughout t he dose 
interval with a similar safety  profile across all treatment arms [Clinical I nvestigator’s 
Brochure [CIB], GlaxoSmithKline Document Number CM2003/[ZIP_CODE]/07 ]. 
The mepolizumab PK/PD model, developed from 5 pri or asthma studies and 1 health y 
volunteer study , included 2 studies of mepolizumab administered subcutaneously. This 
model described the relationship between plasma mepolizumab concentrations and 
eosinophil counts (irrespective of the route of administrati on) by  [CONTACT_699891] 50of 226ng/mL 
[CIB, GlaxoSmithKline Document Number CM2003/[ZIP_CODE]/07] . (IC50is the half -
maximal inhibitory  concentration or the concentration at which 50% of the eosinophil 
population is inhibited.) Ba sed on prior PK studies, the bioavilability  of mepolizumab has 
been determined to be approximately  75% and 71% when administered SC into the upper 
arm and thigh, respectively  [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number CM2003/[ZIP_CODE]/07].
Therefore, a dose of 100mg SC is anticipated to provide similar exposure to the 75mg IV 
dose studied in MEA112997. Additionally , this dose will provide plasma concentrations 
of mepolizumab well above the IC 50for the entire dosage interval. 
Further details on the PK/PD model can be in found in the CIB [GlaxoSmithKline 
Document Number CM2003/[ZIP_CODE]/07].

6.2.1. Efficacy  Data Capture/Instruments
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exacerbations
Subjects will be q uestioned at each visit regarding the occurrence of an y exacerbations 
since their last visit. Numerical occurrences will be captured via the eCRF. 
Exacerbations will be defined as worsening of asthma which requires use of sy stemic 
corticosteroids and/or h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_31739]/or Emergency  Department (ED) visits.
For all subjects, use of systemic corticosteroids is defined as IV or oral steroids (e.g., 
prednisone) for at least 3 days or a single intramuscular (IM) CS dose. For subjects on 
maintenance s ystemic corticosteroids, use of s ystemic corticosteroids is defined as at 
least double the existing maintenance dose for at least 3 day s. 
Exacerbations where the courses of s ystemic CS are separated by  <7 day s will be 
considered as one exacerbation for consistenc y across the program.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Asthma Control Questionnaire -5 (ACQ-5)
The ACQ -[ADDRESS_950143]’s asthma control that 
can be quickl y and easil y completed [ Juniper , 2005]. The questions are designed to be 
self-completed b y the subject. The five questions enquire about the frequency and/or 
severit y of s ymptoms (nocturnal awakening on waking in the morning, activity  
limitation, and shortness of breath, wheeze). The response options for all these questions 
consist of a zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/ limitation) scale.
The ACQ -[ADDRESS_950144]’s response. Adequate time 
should be allowed to complete all items on the ACQ-5. The questionnaire will be 
administered every  12 weeks throughout the study .

6.3. Safet y
Incidence of adverse events including sy stemic (i.e., allergic/IgE mediated and n on-
allergic) and local site injection -related reactions reported throughout the treatment 
period.
oSystemic reactions can be allergic or non-allergic in nature and are t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_699871] , generall y develop within several hours of the in jection, 
and are most commonl y associated with a complex of sy mptoms including chills, 
fever, nausea, vomiting, asthenia, headache, skin rash, pruritus, urticaria, 
arthralgia/m yalgia, h ypotension/hy pertension, dizziness, bronchospasm, dy spnea 
or cough.

35Phase III -IV liver chemistry stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] 1- 5 are defined below and are 
presented in a figure in Appendix 4 :
Criterion 1: ALT 3xULN and bilirubin 2xUL N (>35% direct bilirubin) (or ALT 
3xULN and INR>1.5, if INR measured)
NOTE: if serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediately available, 
withdraw study  drug for that subject if ALT  3xULN and bilirubin 
2xULN. Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is 
available. If testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable 
urinary bilirubin on dipstick , indicating direct bilirubin elevations and 
suggesting liver injury .
Criterion 2: ALT 8xULN.
Criterion 3: ALT 5xULN but <[ADDRESS_950145] persists for 2 weeks
Criterion 4: ALT 3xULN if associated with sy mptoms (new or worsening) believed 
to be related to hepatitis (such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, or jaundice) or h ypersensitivity  (such as 
fever, rash or eosinophilia).
Criterion 5: ALT 5xULN but <[ADDRESS_950146] and cannot be monitored weekl y for 2 
weeks
[IP_ADDRESS]. Actions
When any of the liver chemistry st oppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121] 1- 5 is met, do the following:
Immediately withdraw investigational product for that subject
Report the event to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours of learning its occurrence
Complete the liver event CRF and SAE data collection tool if the event also meets
the criteria for an SAE. All events of ALT 3xULN andbilirubin 2xULN (>35% 
direct) (or ALT   3xULN and INR>1.5, if INR measured); INR measurement is not 
required and the threshold value stated will not apply  to patients receiving 
anticoagulants), ter med ‘Hy ’s Law’, must be reported as an SAE (excluding 
studies of hepatic impairment or cirrhosis) . 
NOTE: if serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediately  available, withdraw study  
drug for that subject if ALT    3xULN andbilirubin   2xUL N. Serum bil irubin 
fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, 
record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick , indicating direct 
bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury .
Complete the liver imaging and/or liver biopsy  CRFs if these tests are performed
Perform liver event follow up assessments, and monitor the subject until liver 
chemistries resolve, stabilise, or return to baseline values as described below.

396.3.2. Adverse Events
The investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of an AE
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicin al product.
Note: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  
associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, th is 
also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse.
Events meeting the definition of an AE include:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/ or intensity  of the condition
New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even 
though it may  have been present prior to the start of the study
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction
Signs, sy mptom s, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE) unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -
harming intent. This should be reported regardless of sequelae .
“Lack of efficacy ” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and sy mptoms and/or clinical sequelae 
resulting from lack of efficacy  will be reporte d if they  fulfil the definition of an AE or 
SAE. 
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:
Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscop y, appendectom y); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE
Situations where an untoward medica l occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen
The disease/disorder being studie d, or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s 
condition
2013N1879 87_04 CONFIDENTIA L
201312
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of an SA E
A serious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence that, at any  dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
NOTE: The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which h ypothetically  might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_699873]: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53060] 
(usually  involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_131972]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s 
office or out -patient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17954]. 
If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_699874], the 
event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]” occurred or was 
necessary , the AE should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31782] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an A E.
d.Results in disability /incapacity , or
NOTE: The term disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may  
interfere or prevent everyday  life functions but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
f.Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_699875]. These should also be considered serious. 
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], or development of drug dependency  
or drug abuse.
g.All events of possible drug -induced liver injury  with hy perbilirubinaemia defined as 
ALT 3xULN andbilirubin 2xUL N (>35% direct) (or ALT 3xUL N and 
INR>1.5, if INR measured) termed ‘Hy ’s Law’ events ( INR measurement is not 
required and the threshold value stated will not apply  to patients receiving 
anticoagulants).
NOTE: bilirubin fractionation is performed if testing is available. If testing is 
unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary  bilirubin on dipstick indicating 
2013N1879 87_04 CONFIDENTIA L
[ADDRESS_950149] meets the criterion of total bilirubin 2xULN, then the event is still reported 
as an SAE. If INR is obtained, include values on the SAE form. INR elevations >1.[ADDRESS_950150] severe liver injury .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sentinel Events
A Sentinel Event is a [COMPANY_004]- defined SAE that is not necessaril y drug -related but has been 
associated historicall y with adverse reactions for other drugs and is therefore worth y of 
heightened pharmacovigilance. Medical monitor review of all SAEs for possible Sentinel 
Events is mandated at [COMPANY_004]. The [COMPANY_004] medical monitor may  reques t additional clinical 
information on an urgent basis if a possible Sentinel Event is identified on SAE review. 
The current [COMPANY_004] -defined Sentinel Events are listed below:
Acquired Long QT Sy ndrome
Agranulocy tosis/Severe Neutropenia 
Anaph ylaxis & Anaph ylactoid Reactions 
Hepatotoxicity
Acute Renal Failure
Seizure
Stevens Johnson sy ndrome/Toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_59373]
6.3.3. Laboratory  and Other Safety  Assessment A bnormalities 
Reported as A Es and SA Es
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or 
other safet y assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically  significant in the 
medical and scientific judgement of the investigator are to be rec orded as AEs or SAEs. 
However, an y clinicall y significant safet y assessments that are associated with the 
underly ing disease, unless judged by  [CONTACT_23996]’s condition, are notto be reported as AEs or S AEs.
6.3.4. Cardiovascular Events
Investigators will be required to fill out event specific data collection tools for the 
following AEs and SAEs: 
Myocardial infarction/unstable angina
Congestive heart failure
Arrh ythmias
Valvulopathy
Pulmonary  hypertension
2013N1879 87_04 CONFIDENTIA L
201312
42Cereb rovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack
Peripheral arterial thromboembolism
Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary  embolism
Revascularisation
This information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular eCRF within one week 
of when the AE/SA E(s) is/are first reported.
6.3.5. Death Events
In addition, all deaths will require a specific death data collection tool to be completed. 
The death data collection tool includes questions regarding cardiovascular (including 
sudden cardiac death) and noncardiova scular death.
This information should be recorded in the specific death eCRF within one week of when 
the death is first reported.
6.3.6. Pregnancy
A urine pregnancy  test will be performed for all females of child bearing potential prior 
to enrollment, during each scheduled stud y visit prior to the injection of investigational 
product, and during the Exit/Early  Withdrawal Visit.
Any pregnancy  that occurs during stud y participation must be reported using a clinical 
trial pregnancy  form. To ensure subject safet y, eac h pregnancy  must be reported to [COMPANY_004] 
within [ADDRESS_950151] be followed up to 
determine outcome (including premature termination) and status of mother and child. 
Pregnancy  complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported 
as an AE or SAE. Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an SAE.
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy , brought to the investigator’s 
attention after the subject has completed the stud y and considered b y the investigator as 
possibly  related to the study  treatment, must be promptly  reported to [COMPANY_004].
6.3.7. Time Period and Frequency  of Detecting AEs and SA Es
The investigator or site staff is responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting 
events that meet the defin ition of an AE or SAE.
AEs will be collected from the start of study  treatment and until the follow up contact. 
SAEs will be collected over the same time period as stated above for AEs. However, any  
SAEs assessed as related to study  participation (e.g., s tudy treatment, protocol -mandated 
procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a [COMPANY_004] concomitant 
medication, will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study  
up to and including an y follow up contact . All SAEs will be reported to [COMPANY_004] within [ADDRESS_950152] be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended 
and non- leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrence. Appropriate questions include:
“How are you feeling?” or for paediatric studies, “How does your child seem to feel?”
“Have you had an y (other) medical problems since y our last visit/contact?” or for 
paediatric studies, “Has your child had an y (other) medical problems or seem to act 
differentl y in an y wa y since his/her last visit/contact?”
“Have you taken an y new medicines, other than those provided in this study ,since your 
last visit/contact?” or for paediatric studies, ”Has your child needed to take any 
medicines, other than those provided in this study , since his/her last visit/contact?”
6.3.9. Prompt Reporting of Serious A dverse Events and Other Events 
to [COMPANY_004]
SAEs, pregnancies, medical device incidents, and liver function abnormalities meeting 
pre-defined criteria will be reported promptly  by [CONTACT_699896].
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational product 
and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. A "reasonable possibility " is meant to convey  that 
there are facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a cau sal relationship, rather than a 
conclusion that a relationship to the investigational product cannot be ruled out. The 
investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, 
such as natural history  of the underl ying dise ases, concomitant therap y, other risk factors, 
and the temporal relationship of the event to the investigational product will be 
considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the I nvestigator Brochure 
(IB) to assist in the determination o f his/her assessment.

Females of childbearing potential are defined as females with functioning ovaries (i.e., 
post-menarche, premenopausal women with no documented imp airment of oviductal or 
uterine function that would cause sterility ). This category  includes females with 
oligomenorrhea, females who are peri -menopausal, and y oung females who have begun 
to menstruate (adolescents). The information on the lack of impairme nt of oviductal or 
uterine function that would cause sterility , can come from the site personnel’s:
Review of subject’s medical records
Medical examination of the subject
Interview with the subject on her medical history .
Females of non-childbearing potential are defined as females with functioning ovaries 
and with a documented tubal ligation or h ysterectomy ; or females who are 
postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with an appropriate 
clinical profile, e.g. age appropriate, >45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement 
therap y (HRT).
In questionable cases a blood sample for follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol 
will be obtained and analyzed to confirm childbearing potential.

59Females on hormone replacement therap y (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in 
doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods listed above for females of 
childbearing potential if they wish to continue their HRT during the study . Otherwise, 
they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmat ion of post- menopausal status prior to 
study  enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2- 4 weeks should elapse between the 
cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the t ype and dosage of 
HRT. Following confirmation of their post- menopausal status, they  can resume use of 
HRT during the stud y without use of a contraceptive method.
Based on the absence of an identified reproductive hazard from preclinical studies, 
absence of a genotoxic potential, and very  low levels of mepolizumab that might be 
present in semen, there is no recognized risk for mepolizumab to affect human sperm or 
the fetus if transferred to a female partner via semen. Therefore, the use of condoms or 
other methods of contraception in the male study  subject is not re quired.

Guidelines
1.Drug rest art may  be considered for a subject exhibiting compelling benefit for a 
critical medicine following drug -induced liver injury , if favorable benefit: risk and 
no alternative medicine available. It applies to Phase I -IV studies (excluding healthy  
volunteer studies; example of phase I studies are oncology  studies). 
2.In Phase III -IV, drug restart may  be considered for liver safet y events with a clear 
underly ing cause (e.g. biliary , pancreatic events, hy potension, acute viral hepatitis), 
if not associated with d rug-induced liver injury , alcoholic hepatitis, or 
hypersensitivity  (fever, rash or eosinophilia) and drug not associated with HLA 
genetic marker of liver injury , when liver chemistries have improved to normal or 
are within 1.5x baseline and ALT<3xULN.
Live r Events Possibly Related to IP -Drug Restart/Rechallenge Following Possible 
Drug -induced Liver Injury Challenge Guidelines

It is expected that the majority  of eligible subjects will enter 201312 within 8 weeks of 
completing the Exit Visit (Visit 14)  in MEA115661.  I n this scenario (scenario 1), this

This is a multi -center, open -label, long -term study of mepolizumab 100mg administered 
SC, in addition to standard of care (SOC), in subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma. 
Only  subjects who complete the MEA115661 Exit Visit (Visit 14) will be offered the 
opportunity  to consent for this study . Subjects meeting all of the eligibility  criteria for the

It is expected that the majority  of eligible subjects will enter 201312 w ithin 8 weeks of 
completing the Exit Visit (Visit 14) in MEA115661.  
To reduce the burden of repeated procedures during the ending of MEA115661 and the 
start of 201312, subjects will start the study  according to a specific “scenario”.  This 
depends on whe n their Visit 1 occurs in relation to the Visit 14 of the MEA115661 study . 
Scenario 1 is w hen Visit 1 of 201312 is performed on the same day  (or less than or equal 
to 8 weeks) from when Visit 14 of study  MEA115661 is performed. 
Scenario 2a is when Visit 1 of 201312 is performed greater than 8 weeks after Visit 14 
of MEA115661 AND when Visit 1 of 201312 is performed on the same day as the 
Follow -up visit (Visit 15) of study  MEA115661. 
Scenario 2b is when Visit 1 of 201312 is performed greater than 8 weeks after Visit 14

Protocol changes specified in Amendment No. 03 are sum marised below:
Change No. 1 : Increasing the duration of IP from [ADDRESS_950196] a seamless transition from I P to commerciall y available 
mepolizumab the study  treatment duration is increased to thre e years. 
Change No. 2: Removal of the Follow -up Visit.  This occurs in multiple sections of the 
protocol listed below.  The rationale is that the original reason for the Follow -up visit was 
to collect the final immunogenicity  sample [ADDRESS_950197] has since improved and the immunogenicity  
sample at the Exit visit is now sufficient.

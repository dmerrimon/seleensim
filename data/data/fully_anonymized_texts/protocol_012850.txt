1.0  SCHEMA 
 
Prior to lung resection at three weeks after PTC, the patient will receive a dynamic enhanced (i.e., 
non-contrast, arterial and delayed phase) computed tomography(CT) of the chest.  These 
preoperative studies will be compared with the histologic results from thoracotomy, obtained at 
least 2 days after PTC and no more than 2 months after PTC to assure thorough necrosis.   
Evaluations will include dimensions of the resected pathologic specimen’s necrotic center and it s 
peripheral rim, compared to the CT findings of vessel proximity, central cavitation and associated 
healing rim, noting the enhancement of the rim and overall ablation zone.  The resected ablation 
zone will undergo histologic analyses of the tumor region near vasculature, as well as the anterior, 
posterior, superior, inferior, medial and lateral margins to determine if cancer is present and note 
the characteristics of the healing rim (e.g., inflammatory infiltrates).  If cancer is present in any area, 
this will be compared to the similar ablation margin on CT to assess any differences in 
enhancement or nodularity.  
 
Key Inclusion Criteria  
 
1.  The patient will be a candidate for a thoracotomy  
2.   The patient will have a peripheral lung tumor 3.[ADDRESS_1253785]-guided PTC with the intent to eradicate the entire tumor(s). 
3.  The patient will have CXR at weeks 1 and 2 (+2 days). 
4.  Approximately 3 weeks after PTC, (2- 53 days) chest CT and pulmonary function tests will be 
performed within 7 days of planned resection.  
5.  Approximately 3 weeks after PTC (2- 60 days) the patient will undergo a thoracotomy with 
resection of the treated lung, consisting of lobectomy for primary lung cancer or wedge 
resection with adequate margin for a metastatic lesion. The mediastinal lymph nodes will 
undergo dissection. 
6. The resected ablation zone(s) will be measured and histologic samples taken from all six margins 
and resected lymph nodes.  
7. The pathology results will be compared with the preoperative, post-cryotherapy CTs.

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the histologic result of treating primary lung cancer 
or solitary metastatic lung cancer after PTC.  
 
The secondary objective is to provide a qualitative assessment of the histology from the ablation 
and tumor margins, comparing histologic observations with imaging enhancement patterns by 
[CONTACT_20420] (CT) before and after PTC.  Post-cryotherapy, pre-surgical CT scan 
dimensions and characteristics (e.g., central necrosis and healing rim) will be qualitatively 
compared to similar areas of the surgical specimen.   In addition, histology samples from anterior, 
posterior, superior, inferior, medial and lateral areas of the resected tumor will be compared to 
enhancement zones of the ablation margin for any residual cancer.   
 
A tertiary objective is long term follow up for clinical outcome and overall survival.  
 
A total of ten evaluable patients qualifying in either Cohort A or Cohort B will be included. 
 
Cohort A.   Patients who have been diagnosed with Stage I primary peripheral lung cancer less than 
3.0 cm in average diameter without prior radiation or chemotherapy. 
 
Cohort B.   Patients with metastatic solitary or multiple (≤ 3) peripheral lung lesions less than 3.[ADDRESS_1253786] not been treated with radiation or chemotherapy since the new 
metastatic lesion appeared.  
 
3.0  BACKGROUND 
 
3.1  NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER  
 
Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer related death among both men and women in 
the [LOCATION_002].  Approximately 200,000 new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year, 
representing 15% of new cancer cases. 1,2,3 
 
Nearly 180,000 people died of lung cancer in 2003, comprising 30% of all cancer deaths. At present 
the one-year survival is 40% while the overall five-year survival for all stages of lung cancer remains 
at only 14%. 4,5 
 
Following surgical resection for a Stage I non-small cell lung cancer there is a one-year survival of 
more than 80% and a five-year survival between 60-70%.6,[ADDRESS_1253787] be greater than 2.0 cm from the carina. TI tumors in Stage I are less than 3.0 cm and do 
not involve the visceral pleural while T2 tumors are greater than 3.0 cm or invade the visceral 
pleura. 
 
Presently patients with probable Stage I non-small-cell lung cancers are offered operation if their 
preoperative staging, which usually includes MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)8,9,[ADDRESS_1253788] long-term outcomes for Stage I lung cancer as opposed to radiation

approach does cause morbidity and mortality.  
 
There is a 1- 4%11,12,[ADDRESS_1253789] multiple side effects due to the 
chemotherapeutic agent and the radiation therapy delivered to the underlying organ. In addition, 
they require multiple visits to the radiation suite and the chemotherapy unit.  The cryotherapy 
option is a single treatment option administered as an outpatient, or overnight monitoring.  
 
With the introduction of endobronchial and trans-esophageal ultasound guided biopsy of 
mediastinal lymph nodes, one could envision treating the peripheral tumor with cryotherapy and 
staging the mediastinal nodes in a relatively non-invasive manner.  This would allow accurate 
pathologic staging rather than image based staging and a true comparison of surgery, radiation 
and /or cryotherapy for similar stage lung cancers. 
 
 
3.2  METASTATIC LUNG CANCER 
 
A second cohort of patients who would be candidates for the protocol are those with limited (<3) 
number of metastatic lesions, each less than 3.[ADDRESS_1253790] no alternative treatment available.  
Patients that meet these criteria would be offered the option for percutaneous cryotherapy.

3.3  CRYOTHERAPY 
 
Enthusiasm still exists for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in multiple organs despi[INVESTIGATOR_894746]22-[ADDRESS_1253792] not encountered with cryotherapy in our ongoing human 
trials at our institution.  RFA appears particularly prone to failure for tumor sizes above 3cm and 
abutting adjacent vasculature.   if a tumor abuts a vessel >3mm, RFA appears to produce a 
relatively consistent recurrence rate of ~50% in liver25, kidney26 and lung22-24.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_894747], the relatively low morbidity compared to resection and the improved survival rates27-[ADDRESS_1253793] used in 
the early 1900’s. Percutaneous cryotherapy was initiated when smaller probes were able to be 
accurately placed and monitored using ultrasound guidance for liver and prostate tumors29-31.  
Intraoperative ultrasound was able to monitor the leading edge of the ice ablation zone with 
millimeter accuracy.  The ability to instantaneously initiate and terminate both freeze and thaw 
cycles with Argon gas systems also made cryotherapy more controllable.  Cryotherapy for hepatic 
and prostate lesions has since become well established.  Our center has also become the leading 
site for percutaneous cryotherapy of nearly any organ, including publications for breast, renal and 
lung tumors32-34.                                           
 
Percutaneous cryotherapy is administered with the application of 1.7 or 2.4 mm diameter cryo 
probes.  Ice ball sizes vary between 1.5 and 3.0 cm in diameter, dependant on the vascularity or 
fibrous content of the tissue.  For an example, tumors within the cirrhotic liver, which contains 
significant collagen fibers, or fibrous lesions of the prostate may require more numerous and closely 
spaced cryoprobes (e.g., <1.5cm apart) to adequately achieve cytotoxic temperatures (- 400c).  In 
addition, the high heat low load and/or low conductivity of lung tissue has been recently 
confirmed in an animal model, whereby [CONTACT_894760] 2.0 cm apart did not generate lethal 
temperatures at the midpoint between the probes35. 
 
Lengths of the ice ball are consistent with both probe sizes and are approximately 4.5 cm.  Maximal 
lethal ice dimensions for even multiple probes in high heat load tissue require a 
freeze/thaw/refreeze cycle of at least 15:10:10 minutes respectively.  The general rule is that more 
than one cryotherapy probe is required for each centimeter of tumor diameter.  A 2-3 cm lung 
tumor may thus require 3-4 probes, especially if the tumor abuts a vessel >3mm in diameter.

Cryotherapy has achieved areas of complete necrosis without basic disruption of the underlying 
anatomic architecture since it is relatively sparing of collagen.  In addition, the margins achieved 
with cryotherapy are more regular, thinner and better defined than with RFA.  The radiotherapy 
appears to destroy underlying anatomic architecture or “melts” the tissue. In addition, the patients 
who undergo radiofrequency ablation require significantly more sedation as the burn from 
radiofrequency is quite painful and often results in overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_894748] [ADDRESS_1253796] developed lung cancer or secondary metastatic disease 
are not candidates for lung resection because of inadequate pulmonary function. These patients 
can presently be treated only with radiation or chemotherapy. One benefit of evaluating 
cryotherapy as the initial treatment for primary lung or metastatic disease is that patients previously 
considered unresectable would now be able to achieve a “non -surgical” resection using cryo 
surgery.    
 
3.4  RATIONALE 
 
Many patients with non-small cell lung cancer are not candidates for surgery secondary to 
inadequate pulmonary function for resection or poor cardiopulmonary reserve.  The location of the 
tumor such that resection would require removal of vital structure (ex. superior vena cava, thoracic 
aorta) could also rule out a surgical approach. 
 
In patients with metastatic lung disease, the ability to treat patients without thoracotomy would be 
an advantage since they frequently have recurrences requiring multiple thoracotomies. These 
patients also would benefit from preservation of as much lung tissue as possible, which would be 
maximized with a non-resective localized technique.  Patients with metastatic lung cancer often 
have multiple lesions and are not a candidate for lung resection as they would have inadequate 
pulmonary function after operation.  The impairment of cardiopulmonary reserve could rule out 
their candidacy for surgical resection. 
 
A percutaneous approach, which would have comparable results to resection without its 
attendant morbidity and mortality, would also be attractive. In addition, an outpatient 
percutaneous approach would decrease hospi[INVESTIGATOR_894749]. If similar 
treatment outcomes could be achieved on an outpatient basis with a several-hour treatment 
rather than a five to six day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_894750], this would be 
a major advantage in medical costs.  
 
Recent data has demonstrated that percutaneous cryotherapy can ablate lung tumors withou t 
loss of underlying architecture including blood vessels32.  These techniques have also been 
successful in terms of ablating pain and have been used for patients with intractable discomfort. [ADDRESS_1253797] resort in patients who 
cannot be offered surgical resection because of limited pulmonary status, cardiopulmonary 
reserve, advanced metastatic disease, advanced local disease and with debilitating pain 
syndromes32.

that central necrosis can not be differentiated from healing rim (i.e., <60 days).   This allows greater 
flexibility in the recruitment of patients surrounding their scheduled resection. The resected  
ablation zone will be measured to compare the average diameter in three dimensions with the CT 
scan dimensions. The diameter of the necrotic tumor and the ablated zone will be measured and 
compared with these areas on the CT scan. The ablative zone’s regions of enhancement or 
nodularity (i.e., possible residual cancer) will be compared with regions (anterior, posterior, superior, 
inferior, medial and lateral) from the pathologic analysis of the tumor, including effects upon any 
adjacent bronchi and vasculature.  We expect that all tumor will be eradicated with cryotherapy, 
but would define success as more than 75% of analyzed tissue being negative for cancer.

than 3.[ADDRESS_1253808] scan and PET scan will demonstrate no evidence of other 
metastatic disease and control of the primary tumor.   Patients will then undergo treatment with 
percutaneous cryotherapy to the lesion.  This will be performed on an outpatient basis. 
 
The technique for local anesthesia will be 1% Lidocaine for the initial skin injection with 1% Lidocaine 
with Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:1000) for deeper injections.  This will minimize bleeding and increase the 
duration of the Lidocaine.  A 3.0-4.[ADDRESS_1253809] to the tumor site.  Intercostal 
nerve blocks will be achieved as needed with Lidocaine on each side of the lesions and on both 
sides of the affected rib.  
 
The cryotherapy equipment (Endocare, Inc., Irvine, CA) will utilize application of 1.7 and/or 2.4 mm 
diameter cryoprobes. The ice ball size for these probes will vary between 1.5 – 3.0 cm in diameter 
dep
ending on the vascularity and fibrous content of the underlying tissue and the tumor. The 
length of the ice ball will be consistent with the probe size at approximately 4.5 cm.   Depending on 
the size of the tumor, a cluster of cryoprobes may be required to adequately achieve cytotoxic 
temperature (- 40o C). The individual probes will require a freeze/thaw/refreeze cycle of up to 
15/10/[ADDRESS_1253810] freeze: thaw is of short duration to facilitate further ablation.  The 
general rule is that there is more than one cryotherapy probe for each centimeter of tumor   
diameter as previously noted.  
 
A central guidance needle (20 gage, 15 cm length) is first placed in order to define the ideal 
course and angulation. The cryoprobes are then placed with minimal repositioning and secondary 
tissue disruption.  Saline injections of the overlying skin will prevent ice necrosis from extending into 
the epi[INVESTIGATOR_894751].

pneumothoraces have been reported after cryoablation of the lung32, usually only on large 
masses located centrally. 
 
2. Hemothorax –One of the advantages of cryotherapy is the preservation of the blood vessel 
ar
chitecture.  A hemothorax may be more likely, if a central lesion was being treated.  
Treatment of more peripheral lesions makes this unlikely.  Subsequent chest x-ray or 
complete blood counts may be indicated.  A significant hemothorax would require either 
percutaneous drainage with a catheter or the patient might have his/her thoracotomy 
performed sooner than three weeks after operation. 
 
3. Hemoptysis - This would more likely occur with central lesions rather than with this protocol.  
However, when the probes are used for cryotherapy, a pulmonary vessel could be 
penetrated and hemoptysis might result.   If this developed prior to cryoablation, the therapy 
would not be administered.  If the hemoptysis was self-limited, CBC would be obtained as 
well as chest x-ray and CT scans to primarily ensure that the hemoptysis has not resulted in 
secondary areas of consolidation other than the treated area.  If the hemoptysis is 
significant, the patient would require a bronchoscopy and possibly operation prior to the 
three-week interval after therapy. 
 
4. Nerve Damage - If cryotherapy was in the area of the phrenic nerve, recurrent laryngeal 
nerve or in the area of the brachial plexus, it is possible that nerve damage could result.  
Brachial damage would be demonstrated by [CONTACT_894765], or any 
weakness in the motor strength of the affected extremity.  Phrenic nerve damage would be 
noted by [CONTACT_894766].  Further evaluation of the phrenic injury 
could be performed with fluoroscopy to determine if the diaphragm was able to contract.  
Recurrent laryngeal nerve damage would present as hoarseness but would be unlikely since 
masses in this study would not be near the aorto-pulmonary window. 
 
Any of these adverse events would be reported.  In addition, any event that requires 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], placement of a tube, or any interventions such as bronchoscopy or early operation, 
would then be reported as protocol-specific adverse events.

We propose to correlate the patient’s CT scan before the operation with the final pathology result.   
 
Any changes that are noted on the CT scan in relation to the pathologic specimen may have 
predictive value.  Imaging studies such as chest CT scan, or PET scan will be a requirement to 
ensure that no tumor remains after therapy.  Since future patients who are not operative 
candidates will require imaging studies to determine the presence or absence of tumor following 
therapy, any prediction value of imaging studies will be very important. 
 
The PET scans will be performed and interpreted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Richard Joyrich (313- 966-4397) of Karmanos

FDG(F-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose)- is a radiolabelled glucose used in PET imaging that is transported 
into the cells.  It is accumulated in neoplastic cells at a more rapid rate than normal tissue.  Non-
neoplastic disease such as granulomatous and inflammatory processes could also accumulate 
PDG and give false results, there a histologic analysis of cryotreated tissue (both neoplastic and 
inflammatory processes) needs to be done to evaluate the cryotherapy effect on the neoplasm.   
 
FDG uptake will be measured as Standard Uptake Value (SUV).  Standard Uptake Value is 
calculated by [CONTACT_51632]:  SUV = radioactivity concentration in ROI (Region of 
Interest(µCi/ml) divided by [CONTACT_894767] (µ Ci)/body weight (kg).  The SUV mean will be measured 
over the whole Region of Interest (ROI).  The SUV max will be measured as the uptake in the hottest

8.0   Figure 1: The 1-2 rule for cryoprobe placements according to tumor size (black circles) 
Using a single cryoprobe requires  precise central placement [22] to cover the tumor with ice (darker gray 
around each probe), let alone lethal ice (smaller dashed line ~5 mm inside ice).  Conversely, when more 
probes are used, the sum of the individual ice projections (darker gray circles) synergistically expand, 
extending lethal ice (larger dashed line) ~ 5 mm beyond all tumor margins while visible ice (lighter gray 
circle) projects ~ 10 mm.

Protocol version: 06/26/2008, 04/07/2009, 07/31/2009, 12/07/2009, 03/30/2012 18 9.0  Statistical Considerations 
 
9.1  Primary objective. 
 
The primary objective of th is pi[INVESTIGATOR_894753].    The primary statistical objective is to estimate 
the PTC success rate (p) as defined in Section 3.4, paragraph 6, i.e., that > 75% of the tissue 
analyzed histologically [ADDRESS_1253819]-PTC is negative for cancer.    The pi[INVESTIGATOR_894754]. 
   
9.2  Sample size. 
 
The target sample size for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_9962] 10 evaluable patien ts (defined in Section 7.5) , from 
Cohorts A and B combined.   The [ADDRESS_1253820] (if not all) patients who enroll will be in Cohort A.    
Both point and 80% confidence interval (CI) estimates of p, and of the mean % of tissue which is 
found negative for cancer (TNC) histologically will be calculated.   The precison (i.e, half-width of 
the CI) attainable in the estimate of (p) with N=10 evaluable patients will depend on the point 
estimate of the sample rate (p), in th e following  manner: 
 
Rate  0.10 0.20 0.30  0.40 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.90 
Precision  0.126  0.156  0.175  0.185  0.188  0.185  0.175  0.156 0.126  
 
With 10 evaluable patients, (p) could be estimated to a precision of 0.188 or better (i.e., smaller)  for 
most values of (p), with 80% confidence.   The table values were computed using Wilson 80% 
confidence intervals in the PASS 2011 software p rogram “Confidence Intervals for One Proportion –  
New”.   With 10 evaluable patients, the mean of a continuous endpoint (e.g., the mean % TNC) 
could be estimated to within 0.[ADDRESS_1253821] deviation (SD) units, with 80% confidence.   Those are 
reasonable precision and confidence levels for a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], and should provide sufficiently 
precise estimates for use in planning a subsequent investigation. 
 
9.3 Secondary objectives. 
 
The secondary objectives are:  1) to provide a qualitative assessment of the histology from the 
ablation and tumor margins;  and 2) to perform various correlative studies described in Section 7.0.   
Secondary objective (1) will not likely require statistical assessment.   For secondary objective (2), 
summary statistics will be calculated, including point and interval estimates of either means or 
proportions as appropriate, for:  PET SUVmean, PET SUVmax, (clinical CT) response rate (RR), and 
pathologic response rate (pRR).   As per Section 7 (and its Study Calendar), the post-PTC CT results 
will be obtained at 3 weeks and at 6 months; the post-PTC PET results only at 6 months.  
 
9.4  Toxicity (Adverse Event) and Safety Evaluation. 
   There are various types of adverse events (AEs) listed in Section 6.0.   Any one of them could 
occur as a serious AE (SAE).   Based on our prior clinical experience with cryotherapy, we anticipate 
that up to 20% of patients may have such complications, but that would not be regarded as reason 
to stop the study. 
 
   However, to prevent continuation of this trial in the face of an unacceptably high rate of SAE’s 
(combining all types), we would consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_894755](s) of that.    
KCI Protocol  Page 19 
F. Baciewicz, P. Littrup 
Protocol version: 06/26/2008, 04/07/2009, 07/31/2009, 12/07/2009, 03/30/[ADDRESS_1253822] devised a statistical 
monitoring plan for SAEs.   This  approach uses a 1-sided upper 80% confidence limit (CL) to 
determ
ine the first opportunity at which the observed SAE rate provides evidence that the true 
(and unknown) SAE rate could be > 30%. 
 
  Using this statistical monitoring plan, if [ADDRESS_1253823] an 
SAE, then we can be 80% confident that the true (and unknown) SAE rate is < 30%,  because that is 
the 
smallest sample size for which the 1-sided upper 80% CL (0. 268) i s still < 30%.  
 
  The first statistically-based early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_894756] [ADDRESS_1253824] 8 (or fewer) patients treated, in which case the 1-sided upper 80% confidence 
limit (0.303) just exceeds 0.30.    The second such early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_894757] [ADDRESS_1253825] 10 (or fewer) patients treated, in which case the 1-
si
ded upper 80% confidence limit (0.327) just exceeds 0.30.   Over the full range of the 10 patients 
int
ended for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_894758], we would recommend re-evalution of the study for safety 
reasons according to the statistical monitoring plan for toxicity given in Table 1. 
 
Table 1.    Statistical Monitoring Plan for Toxicity 
We would recommend re-evalution of the study for safety reasons if there were X 
many SAE’s among the first N (or fewer) patients treated: 
X    N   p   UCL 
1    8   0.125    0.303 
2   10   0.200    0.327 
 
   In Table 1, X = the cumulative number of SAE’s observed thus far;  N = the number of cryotherapy 
patients treated thus far;  p = the observed (i.e., sample ) SAE rate, combining SAE’s of any type;  
and UCL = the exact 1-sided upper 80% binomial confidence limit for p. 
 
9.
5   Accrual rate, accrual duration, and study duration. 
 
The expected accrual rate is 2 patients/year, hence it should take [ADDRESS_1253826].   
The co-investigators and biostatistician will attend when available.   Registrations, accrual rate, 
adverse events, toxicity data, treatment received, response assessments, and data completeness 
will be reviewed for all patients on the trial.   Concerns regarding the study, and modifications to 
the protocol, if needed, will be discussed with all investigators.   A monthly report will be submitted 
to the KCI Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).

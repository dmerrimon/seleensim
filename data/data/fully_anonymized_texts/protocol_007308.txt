Research Summary  
  2. Purpose  
 
Minimization of perioperative discomfort and complications, such as increased blood loss and length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_541809] a mutual goal amongst both patients and surgeons alike. To our knowledge , there have been no studies in the US and only one 
small study in Europe comparing the efficacy of tranexamic acid ( TXA) and Ƹ-
aminocaproic acid (EACA or ACA, Amicar ®) in TKA and total hip arthroplasty 
(TH A). A double blind, randomized and placebo controlled trial in Spain involving

currently costs between $100 -200 per each IV dose. A unit of RBC costs between 
$500- [ADDRESS_1124770] increased by $140, the total

surgical procedures, such as the ones used during Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA), have been shown to increase fibrinolysis during deflation, despi[INVESTIGATOR_812322].

bleeding control such as the use of Amicar in thrombocytopenia and TXA in the treatment of uterine bleeding.
9,10 Amicar and TXA are currently approved for non -
surgical settings of excessive bleeding where fibrinolysis is a contributing factor, 
like ocular bleeding, menorrhagia, cirrhosis, and placental abruption. Both of these agents are reversible competitive inhibitors of plasminogen/plasmin and are widely 
used in the fields o f orthopaedics, cardiothoracic surgery, and transplantation to 
reduce blood loss . Amicar was the first agent to be used in hopes of reducing blood 
loss during major surgery, however shift began due to a worldwide shortage of Amicar. Although this shortage has since been corrected, TXA began being used as a 
result and is showing early promising results. TXA is [ADDRESS_1124774] analysis

   4.  Study Design  
 
  This is a randomized prospective trial.  Eligible patients will include those who do  
      not screen positive for any of the exclusion criteria (history of stents, myocardial  
      infarction, cerebrovascular accident or stroke, deep venous thrombus, pu lmonary  
      embolus late onset color blindness, and hypercoagulable state). Subjects will be  
      identified during clinic visits with their provider before their procedure.  After the  
     patient’s agreement to be enrolled in the study and formal consent process during  
     preoperative screening, they will be randomized to either the TXA or the Amicar   
arm.  
 
Primary total hip or knee surgery will be performed as per the standard of care as 
determined by [CONTACT_812328], with the exception of the administration of the type of antifibrinolytic product. There is no consensus as to 
the dosing of either Amicar or TXA in the literature. Previous studies have ranged in 
dosing of TXA from 10 -150 mg/kg administered over different time periods and 
dosed Amicar at 10 mg/kg.

Duke IRB per Adverse Event policy.
 
 The recruitment goal of this study is to enroll 75% of  eligible subjects electing to 
undergo either primary hip or knee arthroplasty performed by [CONTACT_812329] a year time period.

7.      Consent Process  
 
The investigator or his/her authorized designee will inform the subject of all aspects 
pertaining to the subject’s participation in the study during the consent process .  
The process of obtaining informed consent will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements (Federal Register Vol. 48, No. 17, 1982, pp 8951- 2).   
 8.       Subject’s Capacity to Give Legally Effective Consent  
 
Each patient aged 18 years or older will consent for him or herself. If the patient is less than 18 years of age they will not be considered for the study.

 10.     Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 
Potential Benefits : Despi[INVESTIGATOR_812324] -label, TXA and Amicar are already both being 
used across various fields, including orthopaedics, for their benefit in reducing blood loss, the need for transfusion, and a drop in hemoglobin during major surgery and have shown to be safe to use.

Potential risks : Although initially there was a fear that TXA or E ACA would increase 
the risk of death and thromboembolic events, current evidence suggests that this increase is not statistically significant.

 However, s ubjects in the TXA arm  may experience the following adverse effects 
including GI disturbances (nausea, vomiting,  diarrhea), allergic dermatitis, 
giddiness, and hypotension. The FDA also lists the risk of serious rare side effects 
including thromboembolic events (such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal 
artery and vein obstruction), convulsion, chromatopsia, and visual impairment.

   Adverse effects associated with Amicar includ e edema, headach e, malaise, 
hypers ensitivity (anaphylaxis), cardiovascular effects (bradycardia, hypotension, 
peripheral ischemia, thrombosis),  GI disturbances (abdominal pain, diarrhea, 
nausea, vomiting), hematologic effects (agranulocytosis, coagulation disorder, 
leukopenia, thrombocytop enia) , musculoskeletal effects (CPK increase, muscle 
weakness, myalgia, myopathy, myositis, rhabdomylolysis), neurologic complications (confusion, convulsions, delirium, dizziness, hallucinations, intracranial 
hypertension, stroke, and syncope),  respi[INVESTIGATOR_229857] (dyspnea, nasal congestion, 
pulmonary embolism), rash, pruritis, tinnitus, decreased vision, watery eyes, and urogenital effects ( increased BUN and renal failure) .  Amicar is less potent than TXA 
so it may lead to increased blood loss and therefore increased risk of transfusion 
according to one study.

12.     Data Analysis & Statistical Considerations   
 
Subject characteristics and study results including those outlined above (considered  
complications or adverse events) will be recorded. 
1 The primary endpoint for this 
study is the percentage of patients requiring transfusions. The secondary endpoint include total blood loss (recorded as estimated blood loss intraoperatively as 
determined by [CONTACT_280919], and postoperatively recorded by [CONTACT_812330]), change in hemoglobin (preoperative vs. postoperative hemoglobin that is routinely measured before discharge), and the total cost of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_812325] (including pharmacy cost, price each night in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], all other charges incurred during admission). Binary 
variable results will be compared using chi- square and Fisher’s  exact tests (where 
appropriate).  We plan a comparison of continuous variable results using Wilcoxon 
rank sum and t -tests (where appropriate).  We will consider multivariable logistic 
regression in determination of TXA  and Amicar  and their correlation with the above 
listed  complications and adverse events.  Anesthetic techniques will be recorded for 
analysis  and covariate analysis will be performed at the end of the study.  In order to 
perform a cost analysis, t otal cost of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_812326],  
potential transfusion costs, and cost of stay.  Based on the one small European study, sample size for finding the difference between two proportions was calculated using 
a proportion of 0.125 patients given Amicar were transfused (n=32 vs. 0.028 (n=35)  
given TXA. Using an alpha value of .[ADDRESS_1124782] analysis

   would need to be 154 patients in each sample size to find a significant difference in 
independent samples.  Our goal of enrolling 400 patients total (200 in each arm) will 
therefore be appropriate for this study  
 13.   Data & Safety Monitoring  
 
The primary investigator will collect data from the subject’s electronic medical 
record  and will extract necessary study  data  and then transfer this data into a 
limited access electronic Excel  spreadsheet housed on the Duke Orthopaedic share  
drive . We will have an independent safety reviewer in lieu of a formal DSMB 
committee to ensure the safety of subjects. [CONTACT_812333], head of the orthopaedic clinical research unit will be asked to serve in this role. He will review available 
safety data, including thrombotic complications after 100, 200, and [ADDRESS_1124783]’s medical record number. After  
data collection, a case number  will be assigned to the data, and the medical record 
number , name [CONTACT_812332] (the only identifying data 
collected) will be stripped from  the database. The code linking medical record  
number to case number will be kept in an Excel spreadsheet with access limited to 
the primary investigator and his research  team. Electronic research records will b e 
stored on  a DHTS server in the following limited access folder O: \CLINICAL 
RESEARCH DATA\JOINT \[ZIP_CODE] - Bolo TXA vs.  Amicar .  Paper  research documents 
will be stored in the PI’s locked research office in a locked cabinet with keys in 
possession of the CRC.  Paper documents will be housed in  the PI’s locked  research 
office in a locked cabinet with  access limited to his research  team  and keys in 
possession of the CRC.  When the study is complete, the code linking  medical rec ord 
numbers to case numbers will be destroyed. During data collection and  review,  
protected health information will be available only to th e primary investigator  and 
will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity,  except as required by  
[CONTACT_2371], for  authorized oversight of the research study.   
 14.   Privacy, Data Storage & Confidentiality  
 
All data collection will be performed on a secure PIN station protected by [CONTACT_812331]. Only researchers participating in the study will  have access to the data.  
With the exception of medical records numbers, data collection will not contain 
patient identifiers as specified in the HIPPA regulations (45CFR164.514(b)(2)(i)).  
All data will be stored as outlined in the research data security plan (RDSP) included  
with this submission. Subject identity will be made anonymous after completion of the data accrual and prior to statistical analysis to assure confidentiality.  Original 
signed consent forms and collected data will be kept in subject folders in a locked 
secure location .

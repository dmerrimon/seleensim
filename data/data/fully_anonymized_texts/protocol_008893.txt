 SPECIFIC AIMS 
Concisely state the objectives of th e study and the hypothe sis being tested. 
 
Aim 1. Assess the effectiveness of robot-assis ted training on hand f unction and quality of 
life in children with CP. 
 
Aim 2. To study the relationship between musc le synergies and the outcomes of robot-
assisted training. 
 
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE 
Provide a brief paragraph su mmarizing prior experience important for understanding the 
proposed study and procedures. 
 
Pediatric cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders affecting move ment, development and 
posture leading to functional limi tations. CP is the most common motor disorder in children (over 
2 per 1 000 live births1) and the leading cause of  chronic childhood disabilit y. It is attributed to 
non-progressive alterations occurring in the brain during fetal and newborn development2. Clinical 
features of children with CP usually include weakness, spastic ity, and loss of selective motor 
control3. Often, there are deficits in the integrity of neuroanatomical structures and pathways 
required for precision graspi[INVESTIGATOR_584002] l of the fingers4,5. As such, skilled finger 
movements and hand functi on do not develop normally6-8. This leads to severe limitations in 
activities of daily living (ADL)9-11. The severity of impairments observed in children with CP is 
associated with deficits in specific domains of quality of life (QoL) ( i.e. physical well-being, and 
social support and peers)9. Also, overall participation in ADL al so has a significant impact on QoL 
(i.e. physical well-being, moods and emot ions, and social support and peers)9. Therefore, not only 
should therapy focus on improving motor symptoms, it should aim to improve the performance of 
ADL. 
 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_145515]:  June 1, [ADDRESS_767842] demonstrated that intensive, 
repetitive, task-oriented therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (IRTT) can help a paretic limb “relearn” how to perform 
movements that were lost after brain damage12,13. The same principle can be applied to children 
with CP that do not have to relearn given moveme nts but rather learn how to perform them in a 
functionally adequate manner14-16. The mechanism by [CONTACT_584013]17. A motor 
learning study in humans has s hown that [ADDRESS_767843] demonstrated that children with hemiplegia may 
benefit from intensive unimanual practice14,15. One approach that has demonstrated promising 
outcomes in hand rehabilitation in  children with CP is constr aint-induced movement therapy 
(CIMT)22-[ADDRESS_767844] be modifi ed; and the approach can lead to temporary deficits in QoL 
during the prolonged treatment period  (use of a cast). Consequentl y, novel approaches  that enable 
IRTT need to be implemented in children with CP . Robotic devices have become a very important 
area of research because of their capacity to achieve IRTT29,30. While the use of robotic-assisted 
therapy (RAT) to improve graspi[INVESTIGATOR_584003], RAT has been demonstrated as an eff ective intervention in child ren with CP for gait 
rehabilitation
31-[ADDRESS_767845] udy, we will assess the effectiveness of the 
Amadeo®.  The device has been shown to improve manua l dexterity in stroke survivors. The 
computer-controlled device maintains patients’ forearm in a secure position using Velcro straps. 
The patients fingertips are then attached to the robotic device using mild adhesive tape (like a band 
aid). Patients then have to cont rol interactive games displayed on the screen using their fingers. 
 In addition to assessing the efficacy of RAT, the proposed study aims to identify predictors 
of responsiveness to the interventi on. This is of significance in orde r to adequately select children 
that will obtain the best outcome following IRTT as  much variability can be observed in response 
to RAT. Baseline functional impairments have been shown to be important de terminants of overall 
gross motor improvements following RAT of gait ( i.e. more initial impairment → less 
improvements) suggesting that children may need to  attain a certain level of motor function before 
being able to achieve optimal outcomes using RAT. While the current st udy also proposes to 
identify predictors of motor outcome following RAT using clinical outc ome measures, we will 
also utilize a physiological measure (muscle synergies) that we have assessed to be a predictor of 
motor outcome following RAT of gait.  
 
The scientific community widely accepts th at the Central Nervous  System (CNS) adopts 
several strategies to reduce the complexity of the control of movement40-44. Many authors have 
shown that one of these strate gies consists in using a limit ed number of primitive signals 
undergoing the activation of muscles which, when  combined, generate a full collection of 
movements41. 
 
Some studies have shown that the sensitive nature of EMG to represent an aberrant motor 
control in CP45. However, the assessment of muscle syne rgies during grasp has yet to be performed 
in this or any other population.  Nonetheless, the similarity of gait synergies in CP, stroke, and 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_145515]:  June 1, [ADDRESS_767846] control in  early development46.  
 
Whereas clinical measures of impairment in SMC are available47, such measures do not 
provide information that is suita ble to design physical therapy interventions aimed to address 
specific impairments and hence improve clinical outcomes of robot-assisted gait training. 
 
If successful, the proposed approach would be expected to significantly improve clinical 
outcomes of manual dexterity in children with CP. 
 
 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS 
Briefly describe study design and an ticipated enrollment, i.e., number of subjects to be enrolled 
by [CONTACT_17839]-wide and by [CONTACT_584014].  Provide a brief summary of the 
eligibility criteria (for example, age range, gende r, medical condition).  Include any local site 
restrictions, for example, “Enrol lment at Partners will be limited to adults although the sponsor’s 
protocol is open to both children and adults.”
 
A sample of [ADDRESS_767847] size of  0.4, an alpha of 0.05, a beta of 0.80, a correlation 
coefficient between repeated measur es of 0.7, and an attrit ion rate of 20%. A study clinician will 
screen potential subjects. Screen ing will include a standard histor y and physical exam to ensure 
subjects meet all entry requirements after cons ideration of inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Specifically, [CONTACT_584039], the study physician, will as sess all subjects' suita bility for using the 
Amadeo.

Assessments 
 
Once the children are enrolled in the study, they  will undergo a baseline assessment before 
undertaking a 6 weeks/[ADDRESS_767848] in the cerebra l palsy Quality of Life Questionnaire, whic h it will be provide d to the subjects 
and they will be asked to fill it  out and return to us when comp leted by [CONTACT_172932] (note: the 
questionnaire does not include a ny identifiable information). 
	
Clinical tests 
Clinical tests will be  conducted by a study staff before a nd after the intervention. Clinical 
testing should last about  1 hour and will include: 
 
• Physical examination: we will gather measures  of Range of Motion (ROM) and muscular strength 
for the upper extremities. Passi ve and active movements of the shoulder (flexion, extension, 
abduction and adduction), elbow (flexion and ex tension), radioulnar joint (pronation and 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_20810]), wrist (flexion, exte nsion, abduction, and adduction), a nd fingers (flexion, extension, 
abduction, and adduction) will be assessed with a goniometer. 
• Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)48,49: We will assess spasticity  at the shoulder (flexion-
extension); elbow (flexi on-extension); radioulna r (pronation-supi[INVESTIGATOR_20810] ), and wrist (flexion-
extension).  
• Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST): th is standardized test is a validated and reliable 
tool to evaluate movement patterns and hand func tion in children with cerebral palsy. The QUEST 
evaluates quality of upper extr emity function in four domains: dissociated movement, grasp, 
protective extension, an d weight bearing.  
• Box and block test52: this test assesses unilateral gross manual dexterity. Children are seated at a 
table, facing a rectangular box that is divided into two square compartments. The individual is 
instructed to move as many blocks  as possible, one at a time, fr om one compartment to the other 
for a period of 60 seconds. 
• The cerebral palsy Qual ity of Life Questionnaire53: this standardized te st assesses 7 domains 
related to quality of life (soc ial wellbeing and acceptance, feeli ngs about functioning, participation 
and physical health, emotional we llbeing and self-esteem,  access to service, pain and impact of 
disability, and family health) and was specifically developed for children between 4-12 years of age with cerebral palsy. It is design ed for self- and pa rent proxy report. 
• Statistical analyses: We will perform a descriptive analysis of the different outcome measures 
and compare results between  pre and post intervention.   
 
 
 
  
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_145515]:  June 1, 2005    5  Lab-based study 
We propose to analyze the musc le synergies of subjects us ing a method developed by 
[CONTACT_584015]41,54-60 . Subjects will be asked 
to reach and grasp objects of different sizes a nd shapes. Electromyographic (EMG) activity will 
be collected from 16 musc les of the upper-limb ( i.e. Teres Major, Infraspi[INVESTIGATOR_100755], Superior trapezius, 
Deltoid anterior/posterior, clavicul ar head of Pectoralis major, Tr iceps brachii lateral head, Biceps 
brachii (long head), Brachioradia lis, Extensor digitorum communis,  Extensor carpi [INVESTIGATOR_116875], 
Flexor carpi [INVESTIGATOR_4778], Flexor carpi [INVESTIGATOR_4779], Fi rst dorsal interosseous, A bductor pollicis brevis, 
Abductor digiti minimi). This sa me procedure will be replicated  contralaterally. Additionally, 
reflective markers will be placed bilaterally on the subjects’ u pper-limbs (i.e. C7, T10, Manubrium 
sterni, Xiphoid process, Acromion, Lateral epic ondyle, Styloid process of the radius, Styloid 
process of the ulna, distal head of the first/second /third/fourth/fifth metacarpus, distal head of the 
first/second/third/fourth/fifth proximal and distal phalanges,  and distal head of the 
second/third/fourth/fifth middle phalange) in orde r to assess movement kinematics. The entire 
process should last approximately 1.5 hour. 
Extracting Muscle Synergies : Muscle synergies and their activation coefficients will be 
extracted from the EMGs usi ng a nonnegative matrix factoriza tion (NMF) algorithm. The NMF 
models the activity of the muscles as a linear co mbination of several muscle synergies, each 
activated by a time-dependent coefficient. Synerg ies will be extracted separately from the EMGs 
of each limb. A first estimate of  the number of synergies of each limb will be obtained based the 
quality of reconstruction of the original EMG channels.  
Estimating the Number of Muscle Synergies : We will decompose the EMG matrix 
increasing the number of synergies up to the poin t where the reconstructed envelopes, obtained 
multiplying the synergy vectors by [CONTACT_584016], have an average R2 similarity with 
the EMG envelopes above 0.8 and a minimum R2 similarity on the indi vidual channel above 0.6. 
Quantifying Synergy Similarity : Similarity between the synerg ies of each limb will first be 
assessed using the scalar product.  We will further quantify syne rgy similarity by [CONTACT_584017] a threshold.  
Statistical analyses: Results of the number of synergies,  and similarity be tween limbs will 
be compared descriptively.  
Assessing the relationship between muscle synergies and response to therapy : he 
relationship between changes in the Muscle Syne rgies and clinical scores (QUEST and Box and 
Block Test) will be investigated on a case by [CONTACT_584018].  	
We will ask permission to study participants to video record them during the performance 
of the above-described clinical  tests and the lab-based study. 
 
 Training:  
Training will be performed using the Amadeo ®. The computer-controlled device maintains 
patients’ forearm in a secure position using Velcro straps. Th e patients fingertips are then 
Partners Human Subjects Research Application Form   Filename: [CONTACT_145515]:  June 1, 2005    6  attached to the robotic device using mild adhesive  tape (like a band aid). Patients then have to 
control interactive games displayed on the screen using their fingers.  
 
 Each training session will in clude 30 minutes of active moveme nts that can be divided into 
up to 3 bouts of 10 minutes depending on pa tient fatigue. During th e training bouts, 
children will be encouraged to move continuously and as  actively as possible. The 
Amadeo® provides several intera ctive games to faci litate motor lear ning. Between bouts, 
children will be allowed to rest for at least 5 minutes. Adjustments in training intensity will vary according to the children’s ability and en durance. Training will take place up to [ADDRESS_767849] 
approximately 60 minutes (including set up, training, and rest between each bout). 
 
For studies involving treatment or  diagnosis, provide information about standard of care at 
Partners (e.g., BWH, MGH) and indicate how the study procedures differ from standard care.  
Provide information on available alternative treatments, procedur es, or methods of diagnosis.
 
Treatments for children with cerebral palsy to improve manual dexterity can include intensive 
unimanual physical therapy or constraint-induce d movement therapy. The approaches focus on 
having patients use their impai red hand more extensively. Ther apeutic options specific to 
providing a decrease in spastici ty can include physical thera py (constraint-induced movement, 
strength therapy, orthoses, serial casts); oral medications (benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], baclofen, tizanidine, 
dantrolene); botulinum neurotox in injections, phenol or ethyl alcohol perineural injections, 
intrathecal baclofen, selective dorsal rhizotomy or musculoske letal surgical procedures. The 
Amadeo® robot training is an advanced version of intensive unimanual physic al therapy. It is not 
the current standard of care.  
 
Describe how risks to subjects are minimized, for example, by  [CONTACT_584019].
 
 
Risks to participants will be minimized by [CONTACT_584020][INVESTIGATOR_584006]: General Safety Precaution s and Procedures for the Conduct of Human.  
 All laboratory equipment meets or exceeds hospi[INVESTIGATOR_444570]. 
 The robotic device that we propose to use in  the study (i.e. the Am adeo® by [CONTACT_584021]) 
has been developed for adults a nd pediatric populations above 3 year s of age (see device brochure). 
Training sessions will be always  overseen by a study staff trained in the use of r obotic systems for 
upper-limb training.   
 Subjects with CP are at higher than normal risk for falls and injuries from daily activities.  
Subjects will be under constant obs ervation. Trained staff will be n earby [CONTACT_584022]. During training and when standing is  not required, subjects will be seated on a 
comfortable chair.

improvement and/or unacceptable adverse events.  The inclusion of objective drop criteria is 
especially important in studies designed with placebo control groups.
 
Subjects will be screened prior to and during enrollment for the presence of medical conditions 
that may contraindicate their participation.  
 FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS 
Provide a brief description of a ny foreseeable risks and discomfort s to subjects.  Include those 
related to drugs/devices/procedures being stud ied and/or administered/ performed solely for 
research purposes.  In addition, include psychosoc ial risks, and risks re lated to privacy and 
confidentiality.  When applicab le, describe risks to a develo pi[INVESTIGATOR_17779].
 
The robotic device that we propose to use in  the study (i.e. the Am adeo® by [CONTACT_584021]) 
has been developed for adults a nd pediatric populations above 3 year s of age (see device brochure). 
Training sessions will be always  overseen by a study staff trained in the use of r obotic systems for 
upper-limb training.  The risks of using the Amadeo ® include muscle sorene ss and fatigue, but no 
harmful adverse events have been  reported with its use. Trained study staff will stretch the hand 
of the participants to minimize soreness. The Amadeo ® is being used in another approved protocol 
that is taking place within the MAL (2015-P002107). 
 Subjects with CP are at higher than normal risk for falls and injuries from daily activities.  
Some of the proposed testing pro cedures will assess the subject’s pe rformance of activities of daily 
living. In general, subjects will be  at no greater risk for falls or injury than when performing tasks 
in the home and community  setting. Subjects will be under constant observa tion. Trained staff will 
be nearby [CONTACT_584023] e of loss of balance. During training  and when standing is not required, 
subjects will be seated on a comfortable chair. 
 Subjects will be asked prior to  using sensors to collect data if they recall any past 
occurrences of fragile skin, or sensitivity to tape  or latex. The investigators will use hypo-allergic 
tapes and bandages that are unlikely to cause skin irritation. For indi viduals with fragile skin, there 
is a risk of skin irritation from the adhesive tape that secures the reflective markers and EMG 
electrodes to the skin. Th e risk is equivalent to wearing a Ba nd-Aid for a few hours and peeling it 
off.  Alcohol cleansing, shaving, and light sanding needed prior to  positioning sensors might also 
cause mild skin irritation. It is possible that mild  bruising may occur from pressure of the sensors 
against the skin.

during the experiments. 
 
EXPECTED BENEFITS 
Describe both the expected benef its to individual subjects partic ipating in the research and the 
importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be  expected to result fro m the study.  Provide 
a brief, realistic summary of pot ential benefits to s ubjects, for example, “It is hoped that the 
treatment will result in a partial reduction in tumor size in at least 25% of the enrolled subjects.”  
Indicate how the results of the study will benefit future patients with the disease/condition being 
studied and/or society, e.g., through increased knowledge of human phys iology or behavior, 
improved safety, or t echnological advances. 
 
The potential benefits could be improved fi ne and gross manual c ontrol, spasticity, and 
quality of life in children with cerebral pals y. However, our experience with rehabilitation 
interventions has shown that not all subjects re spond in the same way to the intervention thus, 
some subjects may not benefit directly from partic ipating in the study. It is  possible that gaining a 
better understanding of the characteristics of muscle  activation patterns will ev entually lead to the 
development of new rehabilitation protocols or a better selection of patients that will respond to 
the intervention. Hence, the study might  benefit patients in the future.  
 
EQUITABLE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS 
The risks and benefits of the re search must be fairly  distributed among the populations that stand 
to benefit from it.  No group of persons, fo r example, men, women, pr egnant women, children, 
and minorities, should be categorically excluded  from the research without a good scientific or 
ethical reason to do so.  Please provide the basis for concluding that  the study population is 
representative of the populati on that stands to potentiall y benefit from this research.
 
No person meeting the inclusion an d exclusion criteria will be ex cluded from participation in the 
study on the basis of gender, ethnicity or race.  
 
When people who do not speak English are excluded  from participation in the research, provide 
the scientific rationale for doing so.  Individuals who do not speak  English should not be denied 
participation in research simply because it is inconvenient to translate the consent form in 
different languages and to have an interpreter present.
 
Non-English speaking subjects will not be exclud ed from the study. Interpre ter services will be 
obtained as necessary to facili tate the informed consent pr ocess and study participation.

CONSENT PROCEDURES 
Explain in detail how, when, where, and by [CONTACT_584030], and the timing of consent 
(i.e., how long subjects will be given to consider participation).  For most studies involving more 
than minimal risk and all studi es involving investigational dr ugs/devices, a licensed physician 
investigator must obtain informed  consent.  When subjects ar e to be enrolled from among the 
investigators’ own patients,  describe how the potential for coercion will be avoided.
 
Subjects who are interested and wi lling to participate in the st udy will undergo an initial phone 
screening to determine their eligibility. Subject s who qualify will be sent study information and 
will be scheduled to visit the lab an d undergo a final screening in person. 
 At the time of the scheduled te st, the subject will be met by [CONTACT_584031]. Informed consent and assent wi ll be obtained by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigators who have 
completed the Partners Healthcare System’s hum an subject protection e ducational requirements 
(i.e. HIPAA), and the CITI Prog ram in Protection of Human Subjects, in compliance with all 
Federal regulations regarding such  training. The parents/legal guard ian will be given a copy of the 
IRB-approved consent form during the initial interv iew. Subjects will be given a copy of the IRB-
approved assent form at the same time. Study staff will clearl y explain to the subject and their 
parents/legal guardian the nature of the informed  consent and assent processes, study purpose and 
procedures, time commitments, risk s, potential benefits, treatment alternatives, rights as research 
participants, study staff contact [CONTACT_3031], c onfidentiality procedures, and arrangements for 
medical care provided in case of injury during th e study. Subjects and their parents/guardians will 
be able to speak with a physician about any questi ons or concerns if they would like to. The subject 
and his/her parents/guardians w ill be given adequate time to  consider their decision and 
encouraged to ask questions, bot h during the initial in terview and throughout the study. A member 
of the study staff will answer any questions re garding the study at the time consent is given.  
Enrollment will begin when the parents/guardians thoroughly understand and signs the informed 
consent form, and the child thor oughly understands and signs the assent form. The subject and 
parents/guardians will be provide d with a signed copy of the comp leted consent and assent form. 
The subject may pause or terminate his/he r enrollment at any time during the study.

  PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY 
Describe methods used to protect the privacy of  subjects and maintain confidentiality of data 
collected.  This typi[INVESTIGATOR_84688] s such practices as substituting codes for names and/or medical 
record numbers; removing face sheets or other identifiers from completed 
surveys/questionnaires; proper disposal of prin ted computer data; limi ted access to study data; 
use of password-protected comput er databases; training for res earch staff on the importance of 
confidentiality of data, a nd storing research records in a secure location.   
 
NOTE: Additional measures, such as obtaining a Certificate of Confidentiality, should be 
considered and are strongly encouraged when th e research involves the collection of sensitive 
data, such as sexual, cri minal or illegal behaviors.
Patients will be assigned a study number, which w ill be used for all documentation except for a 
master list matching subjects na mes and study numbers, and forms for which subjects’ names must 
be recorded (e.g. intake interview forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_584012] r eceipts etc).  The master list 
and interview forms will be kept in a secure location in locked offices.  No non-study staff will 
have access to any identifiable patient study data  or demographic information.  All subjects' 
parents will be informed of thei r privacy rights and sign a HIP AA-compliant authorization form 
previously approved by [CONTACT_276563]. Study staff in the Motion Analysis Laboratory will 
conduct quarterly audits to ensu re compliance with regulatory st andards for study documentation. 
 Videotapes and photos will be stored securely  in the SRH Motion Analysis Laboratory; only 
investigators listed on the study appl ication will have access to th em.  The videotapes will be 
destroyed after [ADDRESS_767854] video/photo ma terial used for the purpose of  articles and presentations.

This is a clinical investigation to determine the efficacy of rectal versus intravenous 
acetaminophen in patients undergoing a minimally invasive hysterectomy.  All women 
will receive acetaminophen  either rectally or intraven ously immediately postoperative, 
prior to extubation.  Patient's will be randomly assigned to either the rectal 
acetaminophen or the intravenous acetaminophen group.  Patient outcomes will be 
measured th rough a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) from 0 -10 for pain scores, and total 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_783328] (MME) for the first [ADDRESS_1077116] . 
1.2 Background/Rationale  
Patient's undergoing  major gynecologic surgery require effective postoperative pain 
management in order to enhance recovery and ultimately allow  patients  to return to their 
preoperative functional state. Traditionally, acute p ostoperative pain control has been 
achieved largely with the use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007].  Excessive use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_783329] . Side effects include, but are not limited to 
dizziness, sedation, nausea/vomiting, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], euphoria, const ipation, and 
abuse  (1). In addition, opi[INVESTIGATOR_783330] -operative ambulation, 
contribute to prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783331], and 
furthermore, have long -term sequelae for individuals as well as society at whole  (1). 
Over the past decade , a multimodal approach to pain management has been explored in 
attempts to optimally treat acute postoperative pain (1 -3).  This approach is one of the 
keys to improving the recovery process.  
Acetaminophen is a non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] a nalgesic with a well -established safety and tolerability 
profile that is commonly used in multimodal approach to treating surgical pain. It is 
available in oral, rectal and Intravenous (IV) formulation. IV acetaminophen in particular 
is increasingly used f or pain control after surgery as it has demonstrated a significant 
analgesic benefit in a variety of surgery types by [CONTACT_783349][INVESTIGATOR_2441] (3,4). Many studies have evaluated the efficacy of 
acetaminophen based on ro ute of administration. A systematic review demonstrated that 
there is no clear indication for intravenous acetaminophen for patients who can tolerate 
an oral dosage as there was no difference if efficacy outcomes (5). This is valuable 
information as the co st of IV acetaminophen is exponentially more than the oral form. 
Although the oral form of acetaminophen is as efficient as controlling pain when 
compared to IV, and is notably cheaper, it is not the best option for the nauseated patient 
or patients whom a re restricted from oral intake following surgery. Rectal acetaminophen 
is therefore a feasible alternative option in such patients.  
Data on the use of rectal acetaminophen in adults for postoperative pain management is 
limited. Pettersson and colleagues ( 2005) compared oral, rectal and IV paracetamol in 
day surgery patients. Although they demonstrated significantly higher plasma 
paracetamol concentrations in patients who received oral and IV formations at multiple 
 [ADDRESS_1077117] after hysterectomy (7).  
At this time, there has been no study in the gynecologic literature to compare  IV to rectal 
acetaminophen in terms of pain con trol and effect on overall opi[INVESTIGATOR_783332] -
operative period.  
The rationale for this study is to determine the optimal way of managing post -operative 
pain in gynecologic surgery in attempt to improve the overall recovery process. More 
specifically, thi s study will determine if the route of administration of acetaminophen has 
an effect on post -operative pain and use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_783333] a minimally 
invasive hysterectomy . The results of this study may guide post -operative pain 
management after gynecologic surgery, and help limit the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], while 
potentially reducing pharmacological costs for patients and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].   
2.0 OBJECTIVES/STUDY AIMS  
2.1 Primary Objective:  To demonstrate that rectal acetaminophen  is not i nferior to 
intravenous acetaminophen in decreasing subjective acute  postoperative pain after a 
minimally -invasive hysterectomy.  
2.2 Secondary Objective:  To demonstrate that rectal acetaminophen  is not inferior to 
intravenous acetaminophen in decreasing o pi[INVESTIGATOR_783334] .  
3.[ADDRESS_1077118] SELECTION [ELIGIBILITY]  
The study population will consist of all patients undergoing a  minimally -invasive simple 
hysterectomy (total laparoscopic hysterectomy with or without robotic assist) for benign or 
malignant conditions.

• Female patients age ≥ 18 years old  
• Willing to consent  
• Amendable to receive either rectal or intravenous acetaminophen  
• Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783335] 24 hours   
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Patients fulfilling any of the following criteria are not eligible for inclusion in this study:  
• Patients unable to provide informed consent  
• Patients with a  history of regular opi[INVESTIGATOR_783336].  
• Patients who have required regular opi[INVESTIGATOR_783337] 7 days preceding surgery   
• Patients with known hypersensitivity to acetaminophen  
• Patients with a baseline  preoperative liver function enzymes (AST and ALT) that are

• Unable to complete procedure as planned   
 [ADDRESS_1077120] ENROLLMENT  
4.1 Where will recruitment occur?  
Recruitment will occur  prior to the day of surgery. Patient’ s will be screened to ensure 
they are eligible for inclusion based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study will be 
discussed with patients who are eligible, and patients will be given a copy of the consent 
form to take home and review. This encounte r will be documented in the patient’s 
medical record.  
4.2 Where and when will consent be obtained?  
After the patient has had ample time to review the consent form and have all questions 
answered, the consent will be signed. This will be done in the office or in the Same Day 
Surgery Unit at Aultman Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783338], and prior to 
admission of any sedating medications.   
4.3 Who will obtain consent?  
Either [CONTACT_251836] , or [CONTACT_783353] , or any other investigator involved in the study,  will 
obtain consent.  
4.4 What procedures will be used for screening?  
[CONTACT_251836]’s office schedule will be reviewed to identify patients that are scheduled for a 
minimally -invasive simple hysterectomy. Patients will be evaluated during a pre -
operative visi t to determine if they are eligible to participate in the study.   
4.5 What happens with screen failures (including any data gathered during screening)?  
Any patient that does not receive protocol prescribed acetaminophen will not be included 
in the final a nalysis.  
5.0 STUDY DESIGN/PROCEDURES  
5.[ADDRESS_1077121]. Singh’s office schedule will be reviewed to identify patients that are scheduled for a 
minimally -invasive simple hysterectomy. When a potential patient is identified, [CONTACT_721723] and [CONTACT_783353] will be notified and proceed with a more in -depth patient 
interview during a pre -operative visit.  
5.[ADDRESS_1077122] will be assigned to the rectal acetaminophen group or the 
intravenous acetaminophen group. The signed consent form will remain part of the 
patients’ medical record.  
5.[ADDRESS_1077123] prior to extubation and awakening. Patients receiving the rectal aceta minophen will 
receive two 650mg suppositories rectally for a total dose of 1300mg, which has been 
used in prior pharmacokinetic studies (7). Patients receiving intravenous acetaminophen 
will receive one dose of 1000mg. The route of administration will be r ecorded in the 
patient’s medical record. Patients will be blind to their study group. Storage  and 
dispensing of medication will be under the direction of the Aultman Pharmacy 
department pursuant to physician order.  
5.[ADDRESS_1077124]. 
Intravenous Morphine or an appropriate alternative (i.e., Dilaudid) will be available for 
breakthrough pain. Patients will receive opi[INVESTIGATOR_783339] t heir reported pain 
level using a standardized 0 -10 pain scan.  
5.7 In-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783340], all participants will be evaluated regularly by a registered nurse. 
Patients will be asked to report their pain level using a standardized pain  scale from 0 (no 
pain) to 10 (worst pain) every [ADDRESS_1077125]. If needed, the 
investigatory team can alter the frequency and amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_783341]. If pain cannot be controlled with opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007], the investigatory team 
can administer other non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_783342]. However, in cases where 
non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_783343], data from these 
patients will not be included in final analyses.  
 7 5.8 Discharge Medication  
 Patients will be discharged with prescription medication(s) at the request of the attending  
 Physician, which may include a combination of opi[INVESTIGATOR_173671] -opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536].  
 
5.9 Data Collection  
Baseline data to be obtained includes age, height, weight, BMI, indication for surgery 
(benign vs. mal ignant), and medical comorbidities. Comorbidities that will be documented 
include  diabetes mellitus, hypertension, thyroid disease, pulmonary disease, 
anxiety/depression on medication, and obesity as defined as BMI ≥ 30. Procedure -related 
data includes estimated blood loss, operative time . Data collection regarding opi[INVESTIGATOR_783344]. Pain medications administered intraoperative by 
[CONTACT_783350]. Complications 
while in the hospit al, adverse effects to acetaminophen, and the length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_783345]. Morphine milligram equivalents will be calculated from the electronic 
medical record. Data collection will conclude at [ADDRESS_1077126] of patients (name, medical record number) by [CONTACT_783351].  Subject number will 
identify data only.  Once the data has been verified, the patients name [CONTACT_783352].

5.11 Adverse Reactions and Management  
This section should include the following segments:  
5.11.[ADDRESS_1077128] .  The only non -
serious adverse event that will be collected are a dverse reactions related to 
acetaminophen use, whether sever e allergic reactions (hives, anaphylaxis, et c…) 
or significant side effects that requires withholding future use.  
5.11.[ADDRESS_1077129] management (Benadryl, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], etc.)  Whether the patient remains 
on said analgesics , transitioned to different analgesics , or removed from the study 
will be determined by [CONTACT_477800], patient input and investigator 
digression.  Any severe reactions may require consu ltation with Internal 
Medicine and other specialties throughout the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  The Research Facult y 
Advisor will supervise all care.  
             5.12     Safety Management  
                          5.12.1 Data Safety Monitoring  Plan 
The investigator will ask the HRRB/Compliance Office to assign a data safety 
monitor to review adherence to the protocol, occurrence of adverse events, and 
accuracy of the data.  The first review will be conducted after enrolling the first 
patient . The sec ond review will occur after enroll ment of the fifth patient.  Upon 
study completion a final review will occur. Unscheduled random chart audits  
may also be performed to ensure data integrity. Any deficiencies found during 
these reviews will be addressed and reported to the PI, HRRB , and federal 
agencies as indicated.  
 
 
 
 [ADDRESS_1077130] size, alpha level (p value) 0.05 and power of 0.95, a total  sample size of 36 
(18 per study group)  is needed . A total of 40 participants (20 per study group) would be ideal to 
account for patients who drop out or are excluded from the study.  
The mean and median post -operative pain scores between groups across time will be compared. 
The value for the median morph ine milligram equivalents of post -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_783346].  
Differences between the study groups in baseline characteristics and outcome variables will be 
assessed with chi -square tests for normal variables, t tests for normally distributed continuous 
variables, or Mann -Whitney U tests for non -normal continuous variables.  
A statistician will assist in organizing data and conducting analyses.

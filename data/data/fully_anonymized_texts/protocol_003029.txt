Immune Response to Shingles   [3]    v e r s i o n  4 . 0 ,  1 6 - O C T - 1 5  
        1Background 
 
There are two clinical illnesses caused by [CONTACT_240628] (VZV):  chickenpox which typi[INVESTIGATOR_240621], and shin gles (also known as zoster, or  herpes zoster) which typi[INVESTIGATOR_240622].  When an individual has their initial infectio n with VZV they develop chickenpox.  
Then, VZV becomes latent in the neurons on the dorsal root gang lia (DRG) which are collections of 
nerve cell bodies located near the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831].  Shingles occur s when VZV reactivates in the DRG and 
travels back down nerves to the skin.  This can cause a painful  rash on the skin or eye in the area 
supplied by [CONTACT_206848].    
 
Therapy for shingles is possible with oral antiviral medication s sometimes given with corticosteroids; 
these are expensive and can have toxicities.  Even after the sh ingles rash heals, a prolonged pain 
syndrome called post-herpetic neu ralgia (PNH) occurs in a subst antial proportion of persons; the risk 
of PNH increases with chronologic age.   
 The FDA has licensed a live attenuated VZV vaccine to prevent b oth chickenpox and shingles.  The 
vaccine composition is the same for both indications.  The dose  varies: the dose for shingles 
prevention is 14 times higher th an the dose for chickenpox prev ention.  In 1995, universal 
vaccination with Varivax (the bra nd name [CONTACT_240636] ) became universally recommended 
in the US.  In 2005, the results of a landmark randomized contr olled clinical trial in the US, done in 
the Veteran’s administration system, showed that administration  of Zostavax (the brand name [CONTACT_240637]) lead to a moderate reduction in the inci dence of both shingles and PHN when 
given to older adults.  Currently, the Zostavax vaccine is FDA approved for immunocompetent adults 
[ADDRESS_292177] by [CONTACT_240629], gradually wanes over time, and that a delicate equilibrium 
between the latent virus in neurons and the immune system final ly tips in favor of the virus and the 
individual gets clinical shingles.  Zostavax, being a live vacc ine, is thought to be able to stimulate or 
re-stimulate a specific immune response to VZV, include the com ponents of antibodies, T-cells with 
the CD4 marker, and T-cells with the CD8 marker.  Because Zosta vax contains all 70 proteins encoded 
by [CONTACT_240630], it is thought that these immune components a re stimulated quite broadly and 
that the vaccine elicits immune responses to many VZV proteins.  To date, the research on this topic is 
simplistic and minimal. Our lab has developed systems to use be fore and after vaccine blood samples 
to measure in quantitative detail the CD4 and CD8 T cell immune  response to each individual VZV 
protein.

        4Study Procedures 
Screening Visit  
 
Study background and procedures will be explained. Potential pa rticipants will have a chance to 
ask questions and informed consent will be obtained.  A separat e consent form will be used for 
HSV testing. 
 
Demographic, medical, and sexual  history information will be ob tained. Study specific 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated.   We will gathe r medical history specific to VZV 
infection, including history  of chickenpox or shingles.   
 Blood will be drawn for HSV serology unless previous documentat ion is available.  Blood will be 
drawn for laboratory testing of HIV, HepB, HepC, VZV and CMV se rology.  If HIV, HepB and HepC 
testing was performed in the last year and the participant was negative and is low risk, the test(s) 
need not be repeated based on me dical history and clinical judg ment. 
 
If participants have a medical history and/or laboratory confir mation of HIV, Hepatitis C or active 
Hepatitis B infection, they will be referred to an appropriate provider, as needed, and will not be 
eligible for further participation.  Subjects will be eligible regardless of the results of their tests for 
antibodies to HSV-1, HSV-2 and CMV.   
 
Enrollment Visit (Day 0) 
 
Eligible subjects will return for an Enrollment Visit.  A blood  sample (up to 110 ml) will be 
obtained for immunological assays and VZV research serology.  A dditional blood (up to 10 ml) will 
be obtained for HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Aft er the blood sample is obtained , a standard dose of Zostavax will 
be administered.  Participants will be provided with a copy of the CDC Shingles Vaccine 
Information Sheet. 
Follow-up Visits 
Participants will return for fol low-up visits at Day 7-14, 28, and 180.  Blood will be drawn for 
immunological assays and VZV research serology.    
Skin Biopsy 
 
Two 3-mm skin biopsies will be collected from the upper arm (co ntralateral to the vaccine 
injection) at Day 0 and again at Day 28.  The biopsy will be pe rformed prior to vaccination on Day 
0.   
Additional Visits  
 
Immune Response to Shingles   [6]    v e r s i o n  4 . 0 ,  1 6 - O C T - 1 5  
        All participants may be asked to return for additional visits s hould the laboratory require extra 
blood samples for analysis.  Up to 110 ml of blood may be colle cted during a visit for 
immunological assays and VZV research serology.      
5Risks & Benefits 
Potential Risks 
 
Phlebotomy: Blood drawing may cause discomfort and/or bruising.   Rarely an infection may 
develop.  Clinical discretion will be used when drawing blood f rom elderly (65+) participants.  If 
necessary, blood draw volumes will be adjusted (50 ml minimum).  
 
Zostavax vaccination:  Mild reactions include  redness, soreness, swelling, or itching at the site of 
the injection and headache.  Serious adverse reactions include anaphylaxis.  There is no 
documentation of a person getting chickenpox from someone who h as received the shingles 
vaccine.  Some people who get the shingles vaccine will develop  a chickenpox-like rash near the 
place where they were vaccinated. There is a risk of disseminat ed infection in 
immunocompromised persons; therefore, they will be excluded fro m the study. There is a risk of 
transmission of the vaccine virus between vaccines and suscepti ble contacts.  As with any 
vaccination, there may be side effects that are not known at th is time.  
 Biopsy:  The diameter of the biopsy will be equivalent to a ver y small straw.  Anticipation of the 
procedure may cause anxiety.  The biopsy itself may cause pain,  even with the use of an 
anesthetic.  Biopsies may cause a pressure or tugging sensation .  Bleeding may also occur; in the 
case of excessive bleeding, silver nitrate will be applied.  In fection and scarring are rare 
complications of biopsies.  Biop sies will not be performed on f ace or neck.   
 
Lidocaine (injectable, +/- epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]): Lidocaine administrati on is associated with temporary 
pain and burning.  Skin biopsy may cause discomfort even when t he area of the skin is numbed 
using lidocaine.  Allergic reactions to lidocaine may occur, ev en in subjects with no history of 
allergic reactions.  Examples of allergic reactions include whe ezing or difficulty in breathing, 
lightheadedness or fainting, skin rash and itching.  As with an y drug there may be unknown side 
effects. 
 
Potential Benefits 
 
Subjects are not expected to benefit from participation. Societ y may benefit from an increased 
understanding of the cellular immune response and pathogenesis of varicella zoster virus and 
vaccination. 
 
6Clinical Procedures 
Zostavax vaccination 
 
Immune Response to Shingles    [7]    version 4.0, [ADDRESS_292180]-15 
        ZOSTAVAX is a live attenuated virus vaccine indicated for prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) in 
individuals 50 years of age and older.  
6.1.1 Recommended  Dose and Schedule  
 
ZOSTAVAX will be administered as a single 0.65 -mL dose subcutaneously in the deltoid region of 
the upper arm.  
6.1.2 Preparation  for Administration  
 
Use only sterile syringes free of preservatives, antiseptics, and detergents for each injection 
and/or reconstitution of ZOSTAVAX. Preservatives, antiseptics and detergents may inactivate the 
vaccine virus.  
 
ZOSTAVAX is stored frozen and should be reconstituted immediately upon removal from the 
freezer.  
 
When reconstituted, ZOSTAVAX is a semi -hazy to translucent, off -white to pale yellow liquid.  
 
Reconstitution:  
 Use only the diluent supplied.  
 Withdraw the entire co ntents of the diluent into a syringe.  
 To avoid excessive foaming, slowly inject all of the diluent in the syringe into the vial of 
lyophilized vaccine and gently agitate to mix thoroughly.  
 Withdraw the entire contents of reconstituted vaccine into a syri nge and inject the total 
volume subcutaneously.  
 ADMINISTER IMMEDIATELY AFTER RECONSTITUTION to minimize loss of potency. 
Discard reconstituted vaccine if not used within 30 minutes. Do not freeze reconstituted 
vaccine.  
6.1.3 Contraindications  
 
Do not administer ZOSTAVAX to individuals with a history of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction 
to gelatin, neomycin or any other component of the vaccine. Neomycin allergy manifested as 
contact [CONTACT_240632] a contraindication to receiving this vaccine.  
 
ZOSTAVAX is a live, attenuated varicella -zoster vaccine and administration may result in 
disseminated disease in individuals who are immunosuppressed or immunodeficient. Do not 
administer ZOSTAVAX to immunosuppressed or immunodeficient individuals including t hose with 
a history of primary or acquired immunodeficiency states, leukemia, lymphoma or other 
malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, AIDS or other clinical 
manifestations of infection with human immunodeficiency viruses, and t hose on 
immunosuppressive therapy.  
 
Do not administer ZOSTAVAX to pregnant women. It is not known whether ZOSTAVAX can cause 
fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. 
However, naturally occurring VZV infection is  known to sometimes cause fetal harm. Therefore, 
Immune Response to Shingles   [8]    v e r s i o n  4 . 0 ,  1 6 - O C T - 1 5  
        ZOSTAVAX should not be administered to pregnant women, and preg nancy should be avoided for 
3 months following administration of ZOSTAVAX.  
Skin Biopsy 
 
Biopsies will be obtained by [CONTACT_44753].  Biopsies will  obtained from areas of the healed 
shingles rash and areas of normal skin. Biopsies will be perfor med only when participants are willing.  
Participants are free to refuse a biopsy at any visit.  Biopsie s will be performed on the trunk, 
buttocks, arms, or legs.  Biopsies will not be performed on the  face. Pre and post biopsy 
photographs will be taken for each biopsy.   
3 mm punch biopsies will be performed as per the Biopsy SOP. Br iefly, the skin/mucosal surface will 
be prepped with chlorhexidine or betadine. 1-5 cc lidocaine +/-  epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1%) will be used to 
anesthetize the skin. A biopsy w ill be performed and placed int o a 15mm tube with 6 ml of media. A 
supply of 15ml conical vials are kept in the lab refrigerator.  The tube will be shipped with an ice 
pack to the Koelle lab. 
Given the small size of the tissue obtained, sutures are not ne cessary. Pressure will be applied to the 
site for 5 minutes. If excessive bleeding persists, silver nitr ate may be used to stop the bleeding. 
Participants will be advised to take over-the-counter Tylenol o r ibuprofen for pain relief. These will 
be provided to the participants through the clinic free of char ge as needed.

8Safety 
Adverse Events 
 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurr ence in a patient or a clinical 
investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical, which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment. Due to the specific setting in  which this study is performed 
(outpatient research clinic), this study will focus on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240626]. 
Mechanisms of obtaining information on AE will rely primarily o n biweekly visits to the clinic with 
a health care provider. The occurrence and severity of all AEs will be listed and graded according 
Immune Response to Shingles   [9]    v e r s i o n  4 . 0 ,  1 6 - O C T - 1 5  
        to the NCI CTC criteria. For a complete listing, see http://ctep.info.nih .gov/CTC3/ctc.htm . The 
following information will be collected on all AEs experienced during this study: 
 
xName [CONTACT_12581]: If the event is described in the NCI CTC, th e Investigator should use that 
terminology. Otherwise, terminology that clearly describes the pathophysiology of the event 
and body system affect ed should be used. 
xOnset Date 
xDate of resolution 
xSeverity 
oIf an event is not described on the NCI CTC and therefore not g raded, the following 
grading will be used: 
1.Mild, easily tolerated by [CONTACT_102], causing minimal discomfo rt and not 
interfering with everyday activities. 
2.Moderate, sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal e veryday 
activities 
3.Severe, prevents normal everyday activities 
4.Life-threatening, places the patient at immediate risk for deat h 
xRelationship to study procedures/d rug: All AEs will have a caus ality assessment performed 
at the time of reporting the event to document the Investigator ’s perception of causality. 
For the purposes of this study, causality will be assigned usin g the following criteria: 
oRelated: The event cannot be attributed to the patient’s underl ying medical 
condition or other concomitant therapy and there is a compellin g temporal 
association between the onset of the events and study drug admi nistration that 
leads the Investigator to believe that there is reasonable chan ce of a causal 
relationship. 
oRemote: A relationship is not obvious but cannot be ruled out. 
oNot related: The patient’s underlyi ng medical condition or conc omitant therapy can 
easily be identified as the cause of the event and there is no temporal relationship 
between the event and the study drug. 
Serious Adverse Events 
The Investigator is required to determine if each AE was a SAE.  A SAE is any AE occurring at any 
dose of study drug that results in any of the following outcome s: 
xDeath 
xA life-threatening adverse drug experience 
xInpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (hosp italizations for elective medica l/surgical procedures, 
scheduled treatments, or routine check-ups are not SAE by [CONTACT_240633]) 
xA persistent or significant disability / incapacity 
 
Important medical events that ma y not meet any of the above cri teria may be considered a 
serious adverse experience when,  based upon appropriate medical  judgment, it may jeopardize 
the patient or participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. 
Reporting Procedures 
 
Immune Response to Shingles   [10]    v e r s i o n  [ADDRESS_292181], date of resolution of the event, seriousness, and outc ome.  The intensity  of nonserious 
AEs can be assessed by a licensed clinician (i.e., physician, n urse, Nurse Practitioner, Physician 
Assistant).  Causality  of nonserious AEs can be assessed  only by a clinician licensed  to make 
medical diagnoses (ie, physician , Nurse Practitioner, Physician  Assistant).  All AEs occurring while 
on study will be documented appropriately regardless of relatio nship.   
 Any medical condition that is present at screening will be cons idered as baseline and will not be 
reported as an AE.  If the severity of any pre-existing medical  condition increases during the study 
period, then it will be recorded as an AE  
All SAEs will be reported immediately to the Investigator.  
 
SAE Alternate: A clinician from t he Virology Research Clinic is  available at any time by [CONTACT_204523] 
o p e r a t o r  a t  t h e  C h i l d r e n ’ s  H o s p i t a l  a t  2 0 6- 5 9 8 - 0 9 2 4  a n d  a s k i n g  for the Virology Research Clinic 
Clinician on-call.   All SAEs will be: 
xRecorded on the appropri ate SAE report form. 
xFollowed through resolution by a study physician. 
 
Timelines for submission of an SAE form are as follows:   
xAll deaths and life-threatening e vents regardless of relationsh ip, will be recorded on the 
SAE form and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_133203] 24 hr of identifica tion of the SAE. 
 
All SAEs determined to be related to study procedures will be r ep orted t o the  H u man  Su b jects  
Division of the University of Washington within 10-days of beco ming aware of the event. 
 
The SAE report will include the following information (as avail able) 
xPatient ID 
xDescription of SAE (onset date, severity, causal relationship) 
xBasic demographic information 
xOutcomes attributed to the event 
xSummary of relevant test results, laboratory data, and other re levant history 
xThe first and last dates of study drug administration 
xStatement whether study drug was discontinued or schedule modif ied 
xStatement whether the event abated after study drug was discont inued or schedule modified  
xStatement whether the event recurred after reintroduction of th e study drug if it had been 
discontinued. 
Follow-up of Adverse Events 
 
All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution or until consid ered stable. 
 
Immune Response to Shingles   [11]    v e r s i o n  4 . 0 ,  1 6 - O C T - 1 5  
        All SAEs reported to the Virology Research Clinic will be relay ed to the Human Subjects Division 
(HSD) of the University of Washi ngton as required by [CONTACT_240634] .   
 
9Data Analysis Plan 
 
Positive response to VZV proteins in lymphoproliferation assays  will be determined on a per-cell-
line basis surpassing this threshold: at least 2.33 × median ab solute deviation of all negative-
control antigen samples above the median response of those same  samples. This calculation has a 
theoretical false-positive rate of 1.0%. VZV antigen wells will  be scored positive only if both 
replicates exceed the threshold. ORFs synthesized as fragments (eg, ORF22) were scored positive 
once if any fragment was deemed positive.  Antibody titers, T-cell frequencies, and T-cell breadth will be  compared between the different time 
points using the nonparametric Friedman's test for repeated mea sures. If significant, subsequent 
analysis of measures using Dunn' s test identified which time po ints were different from 
prevaccine samples. Correlation analyses will be performed usin g the Spearman's test. 
Nonparametric tests will be used because the data are likely to  be highly left skewed, thus did not 
satisfy assumptions of normality. Two-sided P values <.05 will be considered statistically 
significant. Statistical tests and graphs were generated using Prism (v7 or greater, GraphPad 
Software, La Jolla, [LOCATION_004]). 
 
10Human Subjects Protections 
IRB Approval 
 
Prior to the initiation of the study, the principal investigato r will obtain written approval to conduct 
the study via the University of Washington Human Subjects Revie w Committee.  
Informed Consent 
 
The investigator or study coordinator will explain the purpose and nature of the study, including 
potential benefits and risks to the participant, to each potent ial participant before enrollment in 
the study. The participant must sign an informed consent form a pproved by [CONTACT_240635]. All original informed consent forms must be retained  by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_240627]’s records. The participant will receive a copy of the signed informed consent form.

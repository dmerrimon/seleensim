PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  
 Peanut allergy is an increasingly common and potentially severe problem, and no active 
treatment is currently available. The current standard of care is strict dietary elimination and 
emergency preparedness with an anaphylaxis kit in the event of an accidental reaction. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_318149], accidental reactions are common and can be severe, 
leading to anxiety and impaired quality of life.  Because the disease is life-long in over 80% of 
affected patients , an active form of therapy is needed. Traditional injection immunotherapy (allergy 
shots) with peanut has been studied as a treatment  option. Although effective,  the rate and severity o f 
significant systemic side effects was unacceptably high, and this approach has been abandoned. 
Mucosal immunotherapy (MIT), which takes advantage of the normally suppressive environment of 
the gut, has been used  for the treatment of nasal allergies and food allergy, as well as drugs such as 
antibiotics and biological agents . In recent case reports and uncontrolled studies on oral 
immunotherapy in  patients with milk,  nut, egg, or fish allergy the majority of patients successfully 
completed the treatment regimen , and the mild side effects associated with treatment were generally 
controlled by [CONTACT_318183].  However, many of these studies were simply 
descriptive and did not employ rigorous study design or immunologic investigation, and the long-term effectiveness of such treatments are unknown. Many unanswered questions remain about the possible mechanism(s) and optimal treatment schedule (dose, timing, route, duration) of food allergen immunotherapy,   
 This randomized, double blinded, dose-finding study proposal is designed to find out if we 
can use peanut mucosal immunotherapy (PMIT)  in young subjects allergic to peanuts , and to better 
characterize the appropriate dose of PMIT.  Our hypothesis is that mucosal peanut immunotherapy 
will make subjects who have peanut allergy less allergic and induce changes in their immune system.  
The goal of this proposal is to produce a new treatment that would benefit these subjects by [CONTACT_318184] (desensitization), and changing the peanut-specific immune 
response in subjects who have peanut allergy (tolerance ).  By [CONTACT_318185], we aim to interrupt the allergic immune response to 
peanut prior to the development of life-long immunologic memory. We anticipate being able to make 
these subjects less allergic to peanuts and cause long-term immune changes in their peanut allergic response.  The specific aims for this proposal are to: (1) use PMIT  to treat subjects with peanut 
allergy to lower the risk of anaphylactic reactions and induce tolerance to peanut (2) determine the 
effect that PMIT has on the peanut-specific immune response.

Date: 4/08/[ADDRESS_391567] generated increasing concern in the U.S., with prospective 
studies indicating that 6 -8% of children less than four years of age experience IgE-mediated food 
allergic reactions.  These data were recently confirmed by a Centers for Disease Control report, 
which also documented an 18% increase in food allergies among U.S. children over the past 10 
years. A recent survey in the U.S. found that 1.3% of the total population is allergic to peanuts or tree nuts, and the average age at peanut allergy diagnosis in our local population is [ADDRESS_391568] of anaphylaxis cases seen.  Each 
year in the US, 
food allergy causes an estimated 125  000 emergenc y department visits, with 
anaphylaxis occurring in approximately 15 000 cases, leading to 3100 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. Though 
food-induced anaphylaxis -induced deaths are rare, they do continue to occur, and remain the 
fundamental threat to all families dealing with food allergy. Fatal reactions are caused by [CONTACT_318186] 80% of cases, and not surprisingly peanut allergy causes significant anxiety and impairment in quality of life for patients and their families.  
  
PROJECT DESCRIPTION  
 We expect to develop a treatment that lowers the risk of anaphylactic (allergic) reactions and 
alters peanut-specific immune responses in peanut-allergic children.  This proposal seeks to 
determine the effect that peanut mucosal allergen immunotherapy (PM IT) has on the allergic 
response to peanuts  in young children.  Our ultimate goal is determine whether PMIT will protect the 
allergic child from a potentially fatal reaction (by [CONTACT_318187]) and induce children to outgrow 
their allergy to peanuts (by [CONTACT_318188] ). 
GOALS, HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES  
 The goal of this proposal is to produce a new treatment that would benefit these subje cts by 
[CONTACT_318184] (desensitization), and changing the peanut-specific 
immune response in subjects who have peanut allergy (tolerance ). This project is designed to study 
the innovative idea that PM IT, begun early in life, will desensitize subjects with peanut 
hypersensitivity by [CONTACT_318189]-term tolerance.  
 The present  research plan draws upon our extensive knowledge of the allergens involved in 
peanut hypersensitivit y; it is also based upon evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of peanut oral 
immunotherapy (O IT) in preliminary research studies.  Previous attempts to utilize peanut-specific 
immunotherapy (IT) subcutaneously have failed primarily because of the side effects of therapy.  We 
expect PMIT to have fewer side effects than the non-mucosal systemic desensitization method, and 
this proposal will compare a high dose regimen to a low dose regimen, which may improve the safety 
profile of PMIT. We propose to test the efficacy of PMIT in young peanut-allergic subjects;  we 
believe that early intervention with PMIT, prior to the development of sustained immunologic memory, may offer an optimal treatment for affected subjects.

allergy less allergic and induce changes in their cellular and humoral immune system.  
 The proposed study has two primary objectives : 
Objective #1:  To treat peanut- allergic subjects with PMIT and to determine whether this 
protocol lowers their risk of anaphylactic reactions and causes long-term 
tolerance.  
Objective #2:  To determine the effect that PMIT has on the peanut-specific cellular and 
humoral response in peanut-allergic subjects.  
Objective #1 : To determine whether PMIT reduces peanut induced anaphylactic reactions and 
induces long-term tolerance in peanut-allergic subjects .   
 Purpose and expectations :   
 These studies are designed to test the feasibility and effectiveness of using PMIT to 
desensitize subjects with peanut  allergy, and to optimize the appropriate treatment dose. We expect 
to demonstrate the effectiveness  of PMIT by [CONTACT_318190]-blind placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC) to peanuts followi ng completion of a 
36-month course of PMIT.  We will compare the effects of high -dose PMIT (3000mg) and low-dose 
PMIT (300mg) against untreated controls, and we expect tha t PMIT will induce a significant 
decrease in: (a) wheal (swelling) size from a titrated skin prick test to peanut protein, (b) serum -
specific IgE to peanut , and (c) adverse effects with accidental peanut ingestion.  In this study we will 
test the hypothesis that low -dose PMIT is as successful in tolerance induction as high-dose PMIT in a 
young cohort of newly diagnosed subjects. 
 The studies under Objective #[ADDRESS_391570] avoidance of 
food allergens and ready access to self -injected epi[INVESTIGATOR_318150] “standard of care” for food allergy.  
Unfortunately, this method does not work well for young patients with peanut allergy.  The ubiquity 
of peanut-containing foods, especially in children’s diets, makes the possibility of inadvertent ingestion great; moreover, children are often in circumstances in which epi[INVESTIGATOR_318151].  If, however, we can demonstrate that PMIT  is effective for peanut -
allergic children, the treatment would provide an immediate and feasible preventive option for 
averting potentially life -threatening reactions to accidental peanut exposure (desensitization).  
Additionally, we may be able to cause peanut- allergic children to lose their allergic reactivity to 
peanuts (tolerance). 
Objective #2: To determine the effect that PMIT has on the peanut-specific cellular and humoral 
activity/response in peanut-allergic s ubjects.

  Objective #2 seeks to understand the mechanism(s) of PMIT’s effect on the cellular and 
humoral response to peanut. To do this, we will: (a) analyze the regulatory T-cells (types of white 
blood cells) induced following PMIT, (b) measure the cytokines (chemicals) produced by [CONTACT_318191]-
specific T -cells after PMIT, (c) determine the type and quantity of peanut IgE-specific B cells 
(antibody-producing white blood cells), and (d) examine the peanut -specific IgE, IgG and IgG4 
response (in blood) and secretory IgA response (in stool). We anticipate that the effect of PMIT will 
occur by [CONTACT_318192]: (1) the induction of regulatory T-cells, or (2) a 
shift from a Th 2 (allergic) to Th 1 (non-allergic) lymphocyte response (as evidenced by [CONTACT_318193]-specific IgE and IgG).  The induction of regulatory T-cells would 
modify the subject’s immune response to peanuts by [CONTACT_318194]-specific T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Both CD4+/CD25+ and CD4+/CD25+/CTLA+ T cells have been demonstrated in humans after mucosal antigen delivery, and there is extensive evidence in animals 
that T cells with regulatory properties develop upon repeated exposure to antigen and form the basis 
of low dose tolerance.  The conversion from a Th

inducing allergic symptoms.  
Our expectation is that the balance of immunoglobulin isotype response and the epi[INVESTIGATOR_318152] (IgE, IgG subtypes, and IgA) is reflective of the antigen-specific immune response.  We anticipate that the identification of antigen -specific immunoglobulin responses may 
give better insight into mecha nisms of immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., “blocking” 
antibodies) and mediators of immune tolerance induction (e.g., IL-10 induced IgG4 as a marker of a modified Th2 response).  
STUDY DESIGN, DOSAGE  SCHEDULE, AND ACCIDENTAL REACTIONS  
 We will utilize a modified MIT schedule for this  PMIT study with a randomized, double-
blinded study based on our previous experience with peanut-allergic subjects. Active peanut allergy 
will be confirmed in all interventional subjects with open oral food challenge prior to entry into the study. Control subjects may be offered a confirmatory food challenge if the diagnosis is uncertain. We will enroll 80 children in the intervention group. The active subjects will be randomized into 
either a high dose group (final maintenance dose of peanut 3000mg, N=40) or a low dose group 
(final maintenance dose of peanut 300mg, N=40) (see Figure 1). Forty additional subjects will be followed as control subjects and will not receive any type of study protein. All subjects in the activ e 
group will undergo a one-day peanut desensitization protocol designed to enable the subject to tolerate  a daily dose of peanut  protein (modified rush phase) (Table 3). If the subject has a mild 
reaction to one of the doses, the next dose would be deter mined at the discretion of the investigator. 
The options open to the investigator are to administer the last previously tolerated dose, or wait an additional amount of time between doses, or repeat the current dose. Once this determination of the dosage am ount is made, the desensitization process resumes as outlined. Upon completion of the 
modified rush phase to peanut, the subject is observed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_391572] is discharged home.

consume the study protein at home da ily for a minimum of ten to fourteen days (+7 days).  The 
family receives the study protein doses as a po wder that they give to the child each day by [CONTACT_318195] a previously tolerated food (e.g., applesauce).  Subsequently, subjects will return to the clinical 
research unit every ten to fourteen days to monitor their adherence to the dosage administration and 
increase the dose to the next escalation amount (see Table 4) . The subject’s response to the new dose 
escalation amount will be monitored for a minimum of [ADDRESS_391574]’s response. If the study team feels that a longer observation time is warranted based on the 
prior dosing history of the subject or their current physical status, the subject will be observed for a 
longer period of time. If symptoms occur that do not require treatment, the subject will be 
observed until they resolve.  If symptoms occur that require diphenhydramine or albuterol, the 
subject will be observed a minimum of [ADDRESS_391575] will be transferred to UNC Children’ s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318153]. 
Subjects will then take that dose 
daily for a period of 10 to 14 days (+ 7 days) after which they will return to the clinical research unit 
to have the daily dose increased proportionately at each visit until the maximum daily dose of study 
protein (3000mg) is consumed. All active subjects will build up to 3000mg of study protein. To maintain blinding, the subjects randomized to the 300mg peanut dose will have additional placebo 
flour added to the study protein during buildup by [CONTACT_250989]. Laboratory studies will 
be done at the beginning of the study, when the subject reaches the [ADDRESS_391576] information given to families include the office phone number, pager number, and email 
address of the PI’s, study coordinators, and research nurses in addition to the pager number of

 After completing the escalation schedule ( build up phase to 3000 mg study protein), the 
subjects will continue to receive their maintenance dose of study protein daily for the next 36 months 
of the study (maintenance phase ). Once subjects enter the maintenance phase, assessment of the 
primary endpoint will occur conditionally (i.e., upon achievement of defined immunological 
benchmarks), and/ or at the chronological end of [ADDRESS_391578] conditional scenario, at any point after this measurement, i f

symptoms following PMIT doses or accidental peanut exposure in the previous [ADDRESS_391579] a DBPCFC the next day. 
This cohort of subjects will then stop the daily dosing for the next 4 weeks and then return for a 2nd 
DBPCFC to peanut to assess long term tolerance to peanut. If these food challenges are negative (i.e., 
successfully completed) , they will be followed by [CONTACT_318196].  The open challenge will 
occur in a 1 to 2 hour window after the successful completion of the tolerance challenge , and the 
study will be completed for that participant if the open challenge is successful. If any of the challenges are positive or inconclusive (i.e., not successful), the participant will resume OIT dosing until the next  12 months, or at the end of the 36 month treatment period. In the second (i.e. 
chronological) scenario, all remaining subjects will be assessed for the primary endpoint once they have completed 36 months of maintenance treatment, regardless of their immunologic parameters 
and/or their performance in past challenges, if applicable. If either challenge at the end of 36 months 
are positive or inconclusive (i.e., not successful), the participant will be considered as having

adherence, any accidental ingestion, any symptoms related to daily dosing and any unintended side-
effects of daily dosing, the families will be asked to keep a simple daily diary to record the requested

experiences a serious adverse event as described by [CONTACT_318199] 3 or above as defined by [CONTACT_318200], the trial will be halted and the IRB and FDA will be consulted. If symptoms as noted above occur in 2 or more subjects, the study will be stopped and the situation reviewed.  In addition, the study will not resume until the FDA has been notified 
and given the approv al for the study  to continue. 
 Subjects will come to the UNC Food Allergy  Study Center  (FASC) for a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) at the end of the 36 month maintenance treatment 
period, or sooner if challenge criteria are met. The DBPCFC  may either occur on 1 day or over a 
2 day period. The food challenges will be administered by [CONTACT_318201].  In a double-blind, placebo controlled challenge, two challenges, one containing placebo  (which will be oat flour) and one containing peanut, will be 
performed in the same day Randomization and preparation of the challenge materials will be performed by [CONTACT_318202] a representative from [CONTACT_318224]’ laboratory. Prior to the food challenge, subjects will be asked to restrict the use of antihistamines (short acting, 72 hours: long 
acting, 7 days), beta- agonists (12 hours), theophylline (12 hours), and cromolyn (12 hours).  One 
challenge will consist of six doses of peanut given every 10-[ADDRESS_391582] of placebo 
material given also in six doses.  The cumulative dose of peanut protein given is 5 grams (10 gram weight of peanut flour). Both challenges will start by [CONTACT_318203]’s lip/tongue with a small amount of the test material. The first inge sted dose will be 0.5 grams (5 %), then 
increasing to 1 gram (10%), 2 grams (20%), 2.0 grams (20%), 2 grams (20%), and 2.5 grams 
(25%). During food challenges, vital signs will be performed prior to the challenge, between the 
two parts of the challenge, at  the end of the challenge day , and anytime symptoms occur. Prior to 
each challenge, the patient will have a medical history and physical exam  performed, during 
which emphasis will be placed on active respi[INVESTIGATOR_318156].  The challenge will be administered by a nurse or physician who is blinded to the testing material.  
The supervising investigator will also be blinded to testing material.   
If the subject ingests all of the challenge material without significant symptoms, the 
treatment will be stopped for 4 weeks, and the DBPCFC will be repeated, using the same procedure as described above. At the end of these challenges, all negative challenge results will 
be confirmed by [CONTACT_318204].   Approximately 5 grams of peanut protein will 
be the quantity of peanut given in the open challenge .

Date: 4/08/[ADDRESS_391584] will be recorded on a dosing log and will not be reported separately as adverse events.  Any reaction that meets the criteria for a serious adverse event will be reported both on the dosing log and on an adverse event case report form. 
Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE) or Medical Event  
An adverse event is a new, undesirable medic al event or occurrence or worsening of an 
existing condition (including an abnormal laboratory finding) in a subject that occurs during treatment and throughout the study, whether or not it is considered to be study related.  Adverse events or medical events and toxicities are treatment emergent signs and symptoms.   
Potential adverse reactions seen in subjects treated with peanut OIT and subjects undergoing DBPCFC include the following: skin manifestations such as pruritus, urticaria, or angioedema; respir atory symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, nasal 
congestion/rhinorrhea, cough and hoarseness; and gastrointestinal manifestations such as vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.  Anaphylaxis is a potential risk involving any of the above symptoms plus hypot ension and circulatory collapse.  
Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is defined as any adverse therapy experience occurring at any dose that results
 in the following (21 CFR 312.32):  
1. Death: A death occurring during the study, or which comes to the attention of the 
investigator during the protocol-defined follow-up after the completion of therapy whether or not considered treatment related, must be reported. 
2. Life-threatening: Any a dverse therapy experience that places the subject or subjects, 
in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred 
(i.e., it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death). 
3. In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318161]. 
4. Persistent or significant disability or incapacity.

 5. Congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
6. An event that required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. 
Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event is considered “unexpected” when its nature (specificity) or severity is not 
consistent with applicable product information, such as safety information provided in the protocol or consent. 
TOXICITY GRADING  
Toxicity grades are assigned by [CONTACT_318205] -CTCAE version 3.0.  Toxicity grading for 
allergic reactions including anaphylaxis is modified from the NCI -CTCAE system to be 
more appropriate for this study population, and is displayed in Appendix 2.  The NCI-CTCAE has been reviewed specifically for this protocol and is otherwise appropriate for this study population.  The purpose of using the NCI-CTCAE system is to provide standard language to descri be toxicities and to facilitate tabulation and analysis of the 
data and assessment of the clinical significance of treatment -related toxicities.  
 
Adverse events not included in the CTCAE listing should be recorded and graded 1-5 according to the General Gr ade Definition provided below: 
 
Grade 1 Mild Transient or mild discomforts (< 48 hours), no or minimal  
medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_266772] (non -prescription or single-use prescription 
therapy may be employed to relieve symp toms, e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_318162], acetaminophen for post- surgical pain).  
Grade 2 Moderate  Mild to moderate limitation in activity some assistance may 
be needed; no or minimal intervention/therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841].  
Grade 3 Severe Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually 
required; medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841].  
Grade 4 Life-threatening  Extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance 
required; significant medical/therapy interve ntion required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27595].  
Grade 5 Death Death.

SIZE OF POPULATION ( AGE, GENDER, ETHNICITY, SOURCE OF SUBJECTS, 
RECRUITMENT PROCESS)  
 We will recruit [ADDRESS_391585] EITHER diagnosed 
peanut aller gy, based on (1) the presence of IgE specific to peanuts (a positive skin prick test >3mm 
wheal size) to peanuts or a positive in vitro IgE [CAP -FEIA] > 0.35 kU/L and (2) a convincing

EXPECTED IMPACT  
 The significance of this proposal is several-fold.  First, a treatment for peanut- allergic 
children is badly needed.  A therapeutic option such as PMIT  would greatly benefit subjects both 
immediately, by [CONTACT_318211], and long-term, by [CONTACT_318212].  Second, an understanding of the cellular and humoral dynamics following PMIT  will 
allow us to determine if this is an appropriate initial step in the eventual development of a safe and efficacious vaccine/treatment for peanut -allergic subjects. This proposed study would also generate 
important new pharmacodynamic information about PMIT by [CONTACT_318213]. We believe that the initiation of treatment soon after diagnosis and early in life, as well as the comparison of doses, will generate novel data that are likely to impact t he safety and efficacy of 
future PMIT therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Additionally, targeting young populations with PMIT may also generate useful insights about tolerance that could be applied to implementation of primary prevention strategies before peanut allergy develops. If PMIT  does not induce complete tolerance, it may be 
partially effective and useful in augmenting other types of therapy including antihuman IgE or other peanut-specific vaccines.  Finally, a better understanding of the immunologic process by [CONTACT_318214].

  It is estimated that over 50% of individuals who are allergic to peanuts will have an 
accidental reaction to  peanuts over a two-year period.   Previous studies have examined traditional 
and rush allergen IT in peanut-allergic subjects.   Given the partial rate of response and the high rate 
of adverse reactions in these studies, and considering the frequent occurrence of accidental peanut ingestion, alternative forms of immunotherapy are necessary for this potentially fatal allergy. 
 Novel immunotherapeutic strategies designed to alter the immune system’s response to food 
allergens are being examined as potential treatment modalities for food allergy.  These include cytokine-modulated immunotherapy, immunostimulatory sequence-modulated immunotherapy, plasmid DNA immunotherapy, allergen-peptide immunotherapy, and “engineered” (mutated) 
allergen protein immunotherapy. All of these approaches strive to elicit a Th
1-type response or 
tolerance from the immune system in response to a specific food allergen.  Unfortunately all of these 
therapeutic options are  costly, technically demanding, and several years from becoming available to 
peanut-allergic subjects.  Data from our preliminary studies indicate that PMIT is effective in creating 
a state of desensitization, whereby [CONTACT_318215]. This PMIT -induced change can protect subjects in the event of an accidental peanut 
exposure, which could be potentially dangerous.  The proposed project is designed to develop a 
peanut-specific MIT that could be made immediately and readily available to peanut -allergic infants, 
toddlers, and older children.  
2.  Importance of elucidating cellular and humoral mechanisms in order to develop vaccine/treatment 
 Understanding the cellular and humoral dynamics following PMIT  will allow us to determine 
if this strategy represents an appropria te initial step toward developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a safe and efficacious vaccine 
for peanut allergy.  Even if PMIT  does not induce complete tolerance, it may nonetheless be partially 
effective.  Delineating its specific effects on the immune response will enable us to det ermine its 
utility and define its role in conjunction with other types of therapy,  
 Ultimately, we hope to develop a vaccine that lowers the risk of anaphylactic reactions and down-regulates peanut -specific IgE and peanut -specific T  and B cells in peanut-allergic children.  By 
[CONTACT_318216] -long peanut sensitivity, we intend to develop a 
therapy that permanently desensitizes patients or that induces long-term immune modulation of their allergic response to peanuts.  Beginning PMIT early in life and shortly after diagnosis may promote 
reshapi[INVESTIGATOR_318166]-lasting immune 
memory. Targeting newly diagnosed subjects early may also permit lower dosing which could improve the safety and effectiveness of PMIT.   
3.  Relevance of project results for treatment/prevention of other food allergies 
 If PMIT proves effective, then there is reason to believe that a similar approach could be used 
to treat individuals with allergies to other common food allergens such as milk, egg, tree nuts, fish, 
shellfish, wheat, and soy. Additionally, if PMIT is effective  in infants and toddlers, and if we can 
understand the immune  responses that cause it to be effective, we will be able to design clinical trials 
for young children prior to their development of food allergy, to prevent the emergence of food 
allergy. Mucosal immunotherapy may also modify the systemic responses to non-food allergens and possibly affect the development of new respi[INVESTIGATOR_318167], as has been shown for traditional subcutaneous injection immunotherapy in children with dust mite allergy.

 SPECIFIC LABORATORY PROCEDURES.  
Overview 
 We hypothesize that PMIT  will induce immunologic changes characterized by [CONTACT_318217] (1) 
a conversion from a Th2 to Th1 response or (2) the induction of regulatory T cells, or both. The 
specific laboratory procedures are outlined in the section below. In brief, peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) will be isolated from whole blood drawn at all time points.  PBMCs 
will be cultured with the major peanut allergen Ara h 2, crude peanut extract (CPE), and  the 
positive control Concanavalin  A and assessed for proliferati ve responses to these various stimuli. 
In addition, supernatants fr om these stimulated PBMCs  will be analyzed for the production of 
the cytokines IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, TGF-β and TNF- α. In addition to measuring the 
composite cytokine profile in the circulation, the ELISPOT technique will allow us to follow the cytokine levels of peanut- specific T cells on a per -cell basis over time. Using flow cytometry, we 
will determine the presence of regulatory T cells in a subject’s blood sample from each time point, and we will assess their function with additional coculture techniques.  In the event that a subject’s blood sample from any given time point does not have enough cells to perform all studies outlined, we will prioritize our studies to focus first on the cytokine and initial proliferation studies, then assessing the presence of  T regulatory cells, then functional regulatory 
T cell assays. 
 We expect to find one or both of the two patterns described below.   
Th2 to Th1 conversion: Protective responses to PMIT mediated by a shift  from a Th 2 response to 
a Th1 response would be expected to result in decreased concentrations of Th 2 cytokines IL -4 
and IL-5, and increased concentration of the Th 1 cytokine IFN -γ in cells cultured at later time 
points compared to cells cultured at entry.  However, Th 2 to Th1 conversion will result in no 
significant change in the magnitude of allergen -specific proliferative responses from cells 
isolated at entry compared to cultures of cells from follow -up time points.    
Induction of regulatory T cells:    The pattern from the studies described in the overview section 
that would suggest a role for T regulatory cells would include proliferation data demonstrating hyporesponsiveness of desensitized allergen -specific T cells in conjunction and/or elevated 
levels of regulatory cytokines (IL-10 and/or TGF- β).  If suppression is indeed observed, we will 
concentrate on the role of regulatory T cells by [CONTACT_318218].    
Allergy Skin Tests   
Allergy prick skin testing with standard 1:[ADDRESS_391586]. Skin prick testing to environmental allergens (dust mites, cat, grass mix, tree mix, and weed mix) and pecan will be performed at entry into the study and at the end of the study as well.

 Skin testing is routinely done in the Allergy Clinic for patients with possible allergies . 
Measurement of serum peanut specific IgG and IgE levels  
 Sera will be collected  and stored at –80°C.  Levels of peanut- specific IgE  and IgG will be 
measured by [CONTACT_6428]. Briefly, plates will be coated with CPE incubated overnight at 4oC, and 
then blocked and washed.  Samples (1:10 dilutions for IgE, 1:500 dilutions for IgG ) will be 
added to the plates and incubated overnight at 4oC. For IgE measurement, plates will be washed 
and sheep anti-human IgE will be added and incubated for 1 h. After washing, biotinylated 
donkey anti -sheep IgG will be added for 1 h. After washings, avidin peroxidase will be added for 
an additional 15 min at room temperature. The reactions will be developed and read at 405 nm. For peanut specific IgG measurements, biotinylated rat anti- human IgG
1, and IgG 2 monoclonal 
antibodies (0.25 g/ml) will be used as the detection antibodies. Subsequent steps will be done as same as those in IgE measurement. Equivalent concentrations of PN- specific IgE  and IgG will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_7425] a generated reference curve.
(15) Additionally, a CAP- FEIA 
(Pharmacia) for peanut specific IgE and IgG4 will de done at each time point. 
Stool peanut- specific secretory IgA  
 We will utilize ELISA assays to evaluate host antibody responses to Ara h 2 in stool and serum in samples collected before, during and after completion of PM IT.
 Stool samples will be 
tested at an initial dilution of 1:[ADDRESS_391587] sample dilution that has an ELISA reading (fluorescent relative light units) [ADDRESS_391588] ELISA plates that are not coated with antigen.  Once the antigen -specific 
endpoint titers are calculated, we will quantitate the total concentration (µg/ml) of  IgA in each stool sample and report the antigen- specific responses as a “titer/µg of total antibody”.  
Cytokine Measurements  
Cells will be collected , isolated, and suspended in complete medium containing RPMI 
1640 plus 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/ streptomycin, and 1% glutamine.  Cell suspensions will be cultured in 24- well plates (4 x 10
6 /well/ml) in the presence or absence of Ara h 2, CPE (10 
μg/ml) or Con A (2 μ g/ml).  Culture supernatants will be harvested after 24-, 48- and 96- hrs of 
culture.  Levels of cytokines IFN- γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, TGF-β and TNF- α will be 
determined by [CONTACT_318219] (Becton Dickinson, CA) or ELIS A according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions (R&D systems, Minneapolis for IL-13; PharMingen, San Diego for all others).  All analyses will be performed in duplicate with cytokine concentrations calculated by [CONTACT_318220]. Samples will be analyzed on a Bio -Mek 1000 Automated ELISA Workstation or Luminex multiplex 
analyzer.   
Protection from anaphylaxis mediated by [CONTACT_318221] a Th
2 response to a Th 1 
response would be expected to result in decreased concentrations of the Th2 cytokines IL -4, IL-5, 
and IL-13, and increased measured concentration of the Th 1 cytokine IFN -γ in cells isolated at

involving regulatory cells.  
T cell phenotype and proliferation 
Cells isolated at entry and every 4 months from individual patients will be incubated for 6 
days in triplicate (1 x 106/well in 0.2 ml complete medium) in the pre sence or absence of Ara h 
2, CPE (10 µ g/ml) or Con A (2 µg/ml).  Cells will then be pulsed for 18 h with 1 µ Ci [3H] 
thymidine, harvested, and incorporated radioactivity measured in a β-scintillation counter.  
Results will be expressed as geometric mean cpm +/ - SE with significant proliferation above 
background (p<0.05) determined by a t test.  Protection from anaphylaxis due to Th 2 to Th1 
conversion will result in no significant change in the magnitude of allergen- specific proliferative 
responses from cells isolated at entry compared to cultures in follow up every 4 months.  However, protection mediated by [CONTACT_318188] i nduction will result in diminished proliferation in 
peanut-desensitized patients.  If diminished proliferation is observed, cultures will be setup in the presence of exogenous IL-2 to distinguish whether decreased proliferation is due either to anergy, which should respond to exogenous IL-2, or due to tolerance, which should not.  The presence of CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ regulatory T cells  will be assessed by [CONTACT_4133]. 
Additionally, we will use ELISPOT kits to quantify the number of IL-10+ peanut- specific T cells 
over time to determine if this inducible Tr1 type of regulatory T cell develops in treated subjects.   
PRELIMINARY RESULTS  
 Preliminary data from current trials suggest that oral and mucosal immunotherapy for food 
allergy is safe and effective. 28 su bjects (mean age 4.8 years) were enrolled in an initial study of 
unblinded peanut oral immunotherapy at Duke and the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences 
Center. Comorbid allergic disease was prevalent in this cohort, with 68% having asthma, 64% atopic 
dermatitis, and 61% allergic rhinitis. [ADDRESS_391590] completed the three phase protocol; four subjects 
dropped out of the study for personal reasons, one due to the development of eosinophilic esophagitis, and three remain in the build-up or maintenance phase.    
  The final dose of the initial modified rush desensitization in this study was  50 mg. In this 
study, the risk of experiencing some symptoms during the initial desensitization was 93%, but most were mild. Three subjects were treated with epi[INVESTIGATOR_318168] &/or mild wheeze (Tables 1 & 2). 
None of the subjects had any cardiovascular symptoms such as hypotension or bradycardia . 
Subsequent study designs have capped the top dose on initial desensitization day at 6 mg of peanut to minimize reactions.  
 The risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_318169] 50%, and fewer than 2% required any treatment. Home doses were very well-tolerated, with fewer than 1% of over 10,000 home doses requiring any treatment (Tables 1&2).

 100% (9/9) of the subjects who have undergone follow-up food challenges after maintenance 
OIT treatment have become clinically desensitized. Of these nine subjects, six had IgE levels < 2, 
suggesting they may have become tolerant. 100% (6/6 ) of these subjects passed a follow-up food 
challenge after discontinuing treatment, indicating tolerance to peanut. These subjects now freely consume peanut in their diet without symptoms. Median peanu t IgE of all subjects treated to date has 
significantly decreased over time while median peanut IgG4 has significantly increased, indicating that peanut OIT may actively reshape the immune response to peanut. A double-blinded, placebo-controlled PMIT study is currently underway to better assess the contribution of peanut 
immunotherapy on the immune response, and further mechanistic work is ongoing.

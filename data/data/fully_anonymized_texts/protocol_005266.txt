1. Introduction and Background  
 
In the Children’s multimedia study, we propose to investigate the effects of media multi -tasking on child obesity. 
The modern obesogenic environment is replete with cues to eat.  Environmental  food cues  stimulate  brain  reward  
regions  and lead to excess  consumption  independent  of hunger  levels  (1). This cued  eating  is partially mediated  
by [CONTACT_7650] .  For example , children  who spend more time looking at food  cues  
consume  more  calories  than children  who do not (2). We propose that the  prevalent  practice  of media  multi -
tasking —simultaneously  attending  to multiple  electronic  media  sources —increases  attention  to peripheral  food 
cues and subsequent cued eating  and thereby  [CONTACT_7651] . Neural 
networks are responsible for controlling attention to peripheral cues. The dorsal and ventral ori enting networks 
control the shifting and focusing of attention, and the  frontoparietal  network controls the filtering of peripheral 
cues in the environment (3-5). Media multi -tasking  is known  to increase orienting and decrease t he filtering 
abilities associated with these  network s (6-8). By [CONTACT_7652], we propose that media multi -tasking  increases  
obesity  risk by [CONTACT_7653]. C urrent  efforts  to address  obesity  ignore this 
prevalent risk behavior . Fortunately , it is possible  to improve  the functioning  of the attentional network s through  
attention modificatio n training (9); thus  this research examines the hypothesis that attention modification training 
can decrease the amount of attention  children give to food cues.  
 
Theoretical Model  
 
We propose  that the persistence of 
childhood  obesity (Figure  1) is 
caused , in part, by [CONTACT_7654] -tasking  that alters  attention  to 
peripheral  cues , rendering  some  
children  more  susceptible  to cued 
eating.  We expect that h igh levels  of 
media  multi -tasking  weakens the 
attentional network responsible for 
filtering out distracting environmental 
cues (frontoparietal network) and 
strengthens  the attentional networks 
responsible for shifting and focus ing 
attention to peripheral cues  (ventral 
and dorsal orienting attentional 
networks) (3-5). We theorize that by 
[CONTACT_7655], media multi -tasking renders  children  particularly  susceptible  to food cues , 
thereby [CONTACT_7656]. The functioning of attentional networks can be modified through attentional 
training that improves sustain attention, which we expect can provide a protective effect against overeating by 
[CONTACT_7657].

v. 11/10/[ADDRESS_6906] important public health 
consequences.  
 
Children’s ownership of diverse media devices is increasing. For example , ownership of a cell phone  went  from 
fewer  than 40% of children  in 2004 to 66% by 2009, and the use of iPods /MP3 players  increased  from 18% to 
76% during  that period (14). With this rise in device ownership is a concurrent rise in media multi -tasking; from  
1999 to 2009 children  nearly  doubled  their time spent  media  multi -tasking , from 16% of the time to 29% of the 
time that they were using media  (14). Critically, this trend shows no signs of slowing. From 2011 to 2013, 
children’s access to mobile devices increased from 52% to 75% (15), and alth ough there is  a scarcity on the 
reporting of media multi -tasking in children, our own preliminary data suggests that 60% of children are 
engaging in the practice (C.1.1). Thus  far, the effects  of multi -tasking  on cued eating  have  not been  examined . 
Given that one in three children in the [LOCATION_002] is overweight or obese (16) and that excess weight in 
childhood increases the lifelong risk of many hea lth problems (17-21), understanding why children gain excess 
weight and how to prevent it is essential to the NIH’s mission of improving our nation’s health.  
 
Food  cues  activate  brain  reward  systems  that prompt cravings and eating.   
 
Though complex neural regulatory systems monitor the body’s energy stores and prompt feeding behaviors to 
match energy requirements (22), non -homeostatic (hedonic) mechanisms also drive consumption of highly 
palatable foods (23,24) . The dopaminergic  mesolimbic  pathway  is central to hedonic eating because it detects  
rewarding  food stimuli  and prompts cravings and eating (25). In addition to the sight and smell of actual food, 
neuroimaging studies from our group (1,25)  and others  (26,27)  demonstrate that images of food also stimulate 
this pathway and that food -cue-related activity in this pathway is related to subsequent snack food 
consu mption (28) and weight gain (25). Limiting  non-homeostatic cued eating is essential for healthy weight 
maintenance,  because even modest caloric excesses can accumulate into substantial weight gain over time 
(29,30) . 
 
Media  multi -tasking  may alter neural  attentional networks and thereby [CONTACT_7658].  
 
Attention to peripheral food cues is controlled by a series of attentional networks. The frontoparietal attentional 
network is responsible for filtering distracting environmental cues,  and th e ventral and dorsal orienting 
attentional networks are responsible for shifting and focusing attention to peripheral cues (3-5). Research has 
shown that these networks undergo a critical developmental period during childhood in  which changes that 
occur during this period often track into adulthood (11). Frequent  media  multi -tasking  has been associated  with 
increased  attention to  peripheral cues . This result  was documented by  [CONTACT_7659]’s self -report of light or heavy  usual media multi -tasking related to their performance on well -
established  behavioral  paradigm s of attention (8). Neuroimaging studies have shown that media  multi -tasking  
is associated  with activity in  brain  areas of the  frontoparietal  attentional network (6), and our own pi[INVESTIGATOR_7641]-taskers have greater cue reactivity to extraneous food cues in known brain reward 
areas (C.1.2) . Consistent with these findings, h igh media multi -taskers  are known to have  a greater  spread  of 
attention  to peripheral cues (7). These  studies  are based  on a well-established  attentional  network  theory  of 
attention  (3-5) and provide  converging  behavioral  and neuro imaging  evidence  that high media  multi -taskers  
are particularly  susceptible  to the influence of peripheral cues. The cross -sectional nature of these past studies 
limits inference about the direction of causality between media multi -tasking and attention to peripheral cues. 
We will address this limitation in the literature through our controlled experimental design. In addition, no  
studies  have  considered  the effects  of media multi -tasking  on attention  to food cues and consumption . The 
effect of media multi -tasking on attention to environmental food cues, specifically, is warranted because  some 
evidence suggests that food cues require different attentional demands than less salient cues (31-33). There is 
a potentially large signif icance in understanding how media multi -tasking affects attention to food cues given 
that attention to food cues has been robustly related to consumption in both adults and children  in a number of 
studies that have used a variety of attention paradigms (2,34,35) . 
 
Attentional tra ining reduces attention to peripheral environmental cues.  
 
v. 11/10/2021    3 It is possible  to decrease  the amount  of attention  given  to peripheral food cues  through  attention  modification  
training  (36-38). Research in adults (36) and children (9) support our contention that one -session attention 
modification training can decrease immediate consump tion. In addition, a study of a large sample of 
undergraduates showed that activation of executive control using the Stroop Task reduced the amount of 
attention given to food cues in a subsequent dot -probe paradigm, suggesting that acute manipulations of 
attention can have immediate effects on the amount of attention given to food cues  (39). This is consistent with 
the robust research in the anxiety domain that has shown one -time attention modification training can reduce 
the amount of attention given to threating cues  (40). To date, however, there have been no studies that have 
looked at the effect of attention modification training that improves sustained attention (AMT -S) on the amount 
of attention given to food cues. AMT -S may be particularly effective at reducing attention to peripheral food 
cues in children, because it is based  on a translational  neuroscience  approach  in which the therapeutic action 
directly  targets  the brain’s attentional networks, rather than specific types of cues . For example, research with 
neglect patients showed that AMT -S training produced increased activation in the superior parietal cortex and 
right and left frontal areas and anterior cingulate cortex. These brain r egions have been associated with all 
three attentional networks (41,42) . This generalized attention training may be the most effective given the 
heterogeneity of food cues in our current obesogenic environment. In addition, AMT -S interventions are 
uniquely promising because the mechanisms associated with sustained attention are the opposite of the 
automatic, poorly filtered attention thought to underlie the negative effects of media multi -tasking (43). For 
example, sustained attention is the ability to focus and self -sustain mindful, conscious processing of task -
relevant stimuli that would otherwise lead to habituation and subsequent distraction  to extraneous stimuli (44). 
Consistent with this suggestion, a short -term intervention that has been shown to improve sustained attention 
in undergraduates (45) has also been shown to reduce the maladaptive attentional processing associated with 
media multi -tasking. The study conducted with a large sample of young adults showed that AMT -S improved 
performance on a battery of attention tasks - including filtering and distractibility - in both high - and low -usual 
media multi -taskers, but this effect was greater for  high media multi -taskers (43). 
 
2. Objectives and Hypotheses  
 
Our long-term goal is to understand  the determinants  of children ’s individual  susceptibility  to environmental 
food cues and  cued eating to develop interventions that reduce child hood  obesity. Our overall objective is to 
determine how media multi -tasking affects attention to peripheral food cues and overeating, and whether it is 
possible to intervene on this proposed pathway. W e have two central hypotheses. The first is that engaging in 
media multi -tasking increases attention to peripheral cues and thereby [CONTACT_7660] (e.g., food advertising, sight or smell of food) that lead s to cu ed eating in the absence 
of hunger. The second is that attentional training  that improves sustained attention protects children against 
attention  to peripheral food cues and therefore makes them less susceptible to cued eating.

Describe all  study procedures, materials, and methods of data collection:  
 
We will achieve our aims by [CONTACT_7661]  13-
17-year-olds visit the laboratory  on three  
occasions  to complete  each  of three  
tasks : a media multi -tasking  paradigm , an 
eye-tracking  task that measures  attention  
to food cues , and an EAH paradigm . 
Additionally , children  will complete  a 
questionnaire -based  media  multi -tasking  
scale . Children  will be randomized  to complete  the multi -task, sustained  attention , or control  condition  of the 
media multi -tasking  paradigm  during  their first visit and will complete  the alternate  conditions  during  their second  
and third visits . The experimental flow for individual laboratory visits is shown  in Figure  2.

v. 11/10/2021    4 Participant recruitment and enrollment. We will  recruit 150 children, aged 13-17-years -old using listservs , 
community postings and in -person recruitment in family -centered organizations such as schools , pediatric 
clinics,  and community centers, and postings  on social media platforms such as Facebook . Participants may 
be recruited under study -specific recruitment efforts and/or our general recruitment efforts for all the studies 
our lab is currently running. In addition, we will also recontact [CONTACT_7662] a list of participants who have 
previously  enrolled in studies in our lab. Parents of these children have consented to being contact[CONTACT_7663]. We will periodically send all families in our database e -cards to thank them for their participation in our 
studies and also to let them know t hat we are recruiting participants  for multiple studies . The study will be 
promoted as a study to investigate how children process information from different types of media; specific 
study goals will be concealed from children until the end of the study to  prevent biasing participant behavior. 
However, parents of children will be told the true nature of the study prior to providing consent for their child’s 
participation so that they can make an informed decision. We will ask the parent not to share the tru e purpose 
of the experiment until the study is over.  Exclusion criteria will include  inadequate English proficiency, a vision 
disorder  that is not corrected with corrective lenses , and relevant food allergies. Exclusion criteria will be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_7664]. After initial parental consent is 
obtained verbally via telephone, study staff will schedule three dinnertime or lunchtime  appointments and ask 
that children eat normal meals and snacks the day of the appointment, but refrain from eating within 45 
minutes of their appointment.  At the appointment, staff will obtain informed consent/assent. Following consent, 
children will comp lete the experimental flow in Figure 2.   
 
APPROACH  
Main Study  
We will achieve our aims by [CONTACT_7661]  13-
17-year-olds visit the laboratory  on three  
occasions  to complete  each  of three  
tasks : a media multi -tasking  paradigm , an 
eye-tracking  task that measures  attention  
to food cues , and an EAH paradigm . 
Additionally , children  will complete  a 
questionnaire -based  media  multi -tasking  
scale . Children  will be randomized  to complete  the multi -task, sustained  attention , or control  condition  of the 
media multi -tasking  paradigm  during  their first visit and will complete  the alternate  conditions  during  their second  
and third visits . The experimental flow for individual laboratory visits is shown  in Figure  2.  
 
Preload meal.  In order to control for satiety, children will be fed a standardized palatable dinner  at the 
beginning of the study  using established methods  (48). 
 
Multi -tasking experimental manipulation.  Immediately following dinner, children will complete one of three 
conditions ( attentional training , acute media multitask , or control) in a modified version of the Go/No -go task to 
simulate media -multitasking .   
Attentional training.  A Go/No -go task was us ed to train sustained attention. For the task, a blue or 
yellow dot briefly appeared for between 20 - 1500 msec and then disappeared. Participants were instructed to 
respond to the blue dot by [CONTACT_7665] (Go trials) and w ere told not to respond 
when presented with a yellow dot (No -go trials). At random intervals between 2000 – 5000 msec the messaging 
bot would ding and send participants a text message. The text message included questions about random facts; 
for example, ho w many teeth does an alligator have? Participants were instructed to ignore the messages and 
focus on the Go/No -go task. By [CONTACT_7666] a task 
designed to increase sustained attention, the trainin g condition was designed to reduce acute media multitasking 
and increase sustained attention. Participants completed 100 Go trials and 100 No -go trials randomized on a 
trial-to-trial basis. There was a total of 60 messages sent to participants.  
Acute medi a multitask.  Participants were asked to monitor and engage with two different tasks 
simultaneously. On the left side of the screen, a blue dot would briefly appear and then disappear (between 20 - 
1500 msec) and participants were instructed to press the sp ace bar as quickly as possible whenever the blue dot 
appeared. On the right side of the screen, a  messaging bot would ding and send participants a text message 
randomly every 2000 – 5000 msec. The questions were identical to those from the attentional trai ning task.

v. 11/10/[ADDRESS_6907] children do a practice trial game, and clarify directions if necessary. The food cue is 
chosen at random on a game -to-game basis. To encourage gameplay concentration, children are encouraged 
to complete as many games as possible within 10 minutess . This game has high ecological validity because it 
mimics Internet advergames that are used to  advertise products to children (2). We will use established eye -
tracking metrics to measure attention to food cues . The amount of attention given to peripheral cues while 
playing the video game Tetris will be  calcu lated for each participant after they completed each experimental 
condition. Areas of interest will be created around distractor images, defined as the area of the image, [ADDRESS_6908] 100 milliseconds . Eye-tracking will be recorded using 
the EyeLink 1000 Plus (SR Research, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). The EyeLink is a robust desktop 
configuration that also includes facia l recognition software to monitor head movements. This ability to 
compensate for head movements is particularly useful because it assures that when participants look away 
from the stimulus and then return to it, the system will automatically reacquire the eye. Critically, the video 
used to track the eyes is not saved and the person’s likeness is never recorded.   
 
Eating in the absence of hunger (EAH) measurement.  When the child finishes the memory game , he/she 
will be asked to “wait in the room” for 10 minutes while the experimenter allegedly takes care of tasks  in a 
different room. During this period, the waiting room will contain  pre-weighed snack items and games  to 
measure EAH using established method s (1,58) . The pre - and post -weights of each snack item will be used to 
calculate the number of kCal the child consumed. The EAH phase will take place within 20 minutes of the 
standardized dinner.  
 
Assessing  usual  media multi -tasking . Children will complete the media multi -tasking index (MMI) (8). This 
index asks about  media multitasking with other print and digital  media during four primary activities: 1) 
watching TV or movies, 2) playing video games, 3) reading books or magazines (not assigned for school), and 
4) doing homework. For each activity, participants reported the frequency with which they multitasked by 
[CONTACT_7667] a 5 -point likert scale (i.e.,  0=Never , 1=Rarely, 2=Sometimes, 3=Often, 
4=Always ). A usual media multitasking score was computed by [CONTACT_7668]. The 
score ranges from 0 to 4 with a highe r score indicative of higher self -reported usual media multitasking. on 
cognitive control tasks (8,59,60) . 
 
Potential covariates . We will assess potential covariates for potential inclusion in analyses for Aims 1 -3. 
Given the association between exercise and increased attentional processing in preadolescent children (61), 
we will assess usual physical activity  using the ActiGraph GT3X -BT triaxial accelerometer (ActiGraph LLC, 
Pensacola, FL) for [ADDRESS_6909] and second visit using established  methods (62-64). Relatedly, it is 
important to record physical activity to isolate the effect of media multi -tasking on cued eating, from the effect 
of general sedentary behavior that media multi -tasking is potentially a proxy. Children  will also be asked to self -
assess th eir pubertal maturation  using the Pubertal Development Scale, which has shown strong validity and 
acceptability in our age group (65-67). Before administering this scale, the experimenter will emphasize that 
responses are voluntary, a nd that if the child simply does not understand some questions, his/her parent will 
offer responses. We will have children report on their media exposure  using a questionnaire adapted from the 
Kaiser Foundation (14), and their health  knowledge and attitudes about the provided food (68). Parents 
will report on their child’s sleep duration  using the Adolescent Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110], the Adolescent Sleep -Wake 
Scale, and the Adolescent Sleep Hygie ne Scale  (69), eating behaviors using the child eating behavior 
v. 11/10/2021    6 questionnaire  (CEBQ)  (71), and sociodemographic variables  (i.e., education, household income, race, and 
ethnicity). Height and weight  will be measured using standard methods (72) to calculate age - and sex -specific 
BMI z -scores  (73). These variables will be collected via a parent questionnaire that will be completed by [CONTACT_7669].  
  
 
4. Analysis  
 
Describe  any qualitative tests and measures as well as quantitative methods:  
 
Our primary outcomes of interest will be ∆first fixation duration to peripheral cues , ∆ cumulative fixation to 
peripheral cues , and ∆EAH  and our primary exposures will be the  multi -task vs. control condition and the 
sustained attention task vs. control. We will first assess main effects of the acute tasks by [CONTACT_7670] ∆ attention eye -tracking metrics on  ∆EAH . Cohen’s power calculation for regr ession, and 
setting alpha to P < .05, two -tailed, we calculated 80% power to detect a moderate effect size ( f2 = .15) for main 
effects. To test for moderation , we will then repeat the main effects models stratifying the sample by [CONTACT_7671] -tasking. We will conduct a formal test for interaction by [CONTACT_7672], usual media multi -tasking, and the product of the acute task and usual 
media multi -tasking as the independent variab les of interest. A Wald test on the product term P < 0.[ADDRESS_6910] a significant correlation between each predictor and our outcome using Cohen’s 
method for Pearson’s corre lation coefficient (74). Using 107 participants (assuming a retent ion rate of 85%), 
80% power, and a Type I error rate of 0.05 (two -tailed), we calculated that Aim [ADDRESS_6911] size of |r ≥ 0.27| for either predictor with EAH. Cross referencing this effect size and our power analysis 
parameter s with the empi[INVESTIGATOR_7642] (75), we found that 
that our study is 80% powered to detect if media multi -tasking fully mediates the relationship between attention 
to food cues and EAH.   
 
 
5. Study Progress Monitoring  
 
Note:   appropriate monitoring may include periodic assessment of the following:  
 data quality  
 timelines  
 recruitment  and enrollment   
 
Provide a description of the methods which will be used to determine the progress of the study, 
including periodic assessments of data quality, timelines, recruitment, and enrollment as appropriate:  
 
Data collected via web -based electronic data collection forms will include internal logic and quality control 
checks to ensure data is valid at the point of entry. Data errors will need to be updated by [CONTACT_7673]. A data analyst will assess all data collected for quality and face validity; data that is 
perceived to be inaccurate may be excluded from analyses. Our team will create a study timeline at the sta rt of 
any participant recruitment, and we will review the study’s progress including adhering to the timeline biweekly. 
v. 11/10/2021    7 Team meetings will assess recruitment, enrollment and study completion rates. A log of those rates will be kept 
in real time. Research s taff will report to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7643].  
 
 
6. Risks & Benefits  
 
Note:  Risks may be physical, psychological, social, legal, economic, to reputation, or others.    
a. Describe any potential risks, their likelihood and seriousness:  
 
1. Exposure to Food Allergens: The children will be consuming a standardized meal as well as snack foods. 
Children with food allergies could experience an allergic reaction to food ingredients  
 
2. Loss of confidentiality: We will collect behavioral and so cio-demographic information. Loss of privacy may 
lead to problems with insurability or social stigmatization  
 
 
b. Confirm that risks to subjects have been minimized, by [CONTACT_7674]:  
 
1. Exposure to Food Allergens: We will request information about the child’s food allergy status multiple times. 
We will ask the parent if the child has any food allergies during the initial recruitment telephone cal l and in the 
written consent form. We will additionally ask both the parent and child whether the child has any food allergies 
before the child begins his/her participation in the study. Children with relevant food allergies will be excluded 
from this stud y to avoid the possibility of an adverse allergic response.  
 
2. Confidentiality: Data collection and analysis will be handled in a confidential manner to protect subject 
privacy. All electronic data will be stored in a password -protected and encrypted dat abase on a secure 
Dartmouth server. All paper files will be stored in a locked file cabinet in a secure office. All subject data will be 
de-identified, and only the primary investigator and research team members who directly contact [CONTACT_7675] h ave access to the information necessary to link them to their de -identified data. The 
information collected for this study will be used only for purposes of the research as stated earlier in this form 
and data will be destroyed when it is no longer needed.  
 
 
 
c. Describe why all the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to both anticipated benefits 
and the knowledge expected to be gained from the study:  
 
This study involves minimum risk to participant, and the study findings are to benefit the broader p opulation. 
Any risks to participants associated with the study are thought to be reasonable.  
 
 
7. Unexpected Events or Incidental Findings  
 
Note : It may be important to consider the potential for certain unanticipated events  to occur, for example:  
 finding an anomaly in a MRI  
 discovering child abuse  
 causing distress in interviews of a sensitive nature  
 
Describe potential even ts and provide a plan of action:  
 
We do not anticipate any adverse effects. Should any children or parent experience discomfort during the  
study, he/she will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_7676], [CONTACT_7685] -Diamond at (603) 653 -3362, or the 
Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at Dartmouth College (603) 646 -3053. If any participant 
expresses a desire to learn more about health b ehaviors for their child, the participant will be directed to 
relevant material published by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the USDA.  
 
v. 11/10/2021    8  
 
8. Deception  
 
Does any part of this study involve deception or withholding of information from par ticipants?  
 
☒  Yes  ☐  No 
 
If Yes, provide an explanation which addresses the following:  
 A description of the deception being used  
 Why the deception is necessary  
 A plan for debriefing, or providing subjects with the pertinent information after participation  
 
We will not completely disclose the purpose  of the main study or the purpose of the sub -study to  participants in 
order to avoid bias. This may lead to the participants feeling distressed about being deceived or distrustful of 
scientific research. In order to address the risks associated with not completely disclosing the research aims of 
the study, w e will send a letter to parents that explains the full purpose of the study when the study is 
complete. We will explain that we did not reveal the study purpose because we thought that such knowledge 
might have influenced their children's behavior. We will  provide our contact [CONTACT_7677]/or 
their children can discuss the study further if they desire.  These procedures will also be followed for the sub -
study.  
 
The full debriefing of the main study reveals the objective of the Tetris game, which is to assess how much 
attention participants pay to the peripheral food cues as they play Tetris. However, because the Tetris game is 
used for the same purpose in the sub -study, fully debriefing participants after they finish the main study but 
befor e they complete the sub -study (as is our current protocol) may affect their responses in the Tetris game 
during the sub -study. For this reason, those participants in the main study that choose to participate in the sub -
study will be debriefed of both studi es after they complete the sub -study.  
 
 
9. Equitable Participant Selection  
 
a. Estimated number of participants at Dartmouth CPHS reviewed sites:  
 
[ADDRESS_6912] enough statistical power in this study. It is 
possible that we recruit up to 1 50 child-parent dyads, in the event that we deem necessary to modify study 
procedures or add new measurements . 
 
 
 
c. Define the target population:  
 
Adolescents, aged 13 -17 years.   
 
 
d. Vulnerable populations

10. Recruitment  
 
Describe method(s) of recruitment.  Associated advertisements and other materials to be used for 
recruitment should be uploaded to the ‘Consent Forms and Recruitment Materi als’ page in Rapport.  
 
We will  recruit [ADDRESS_6913] consented to 
being contact[CONTACT_7678].  We will periodically send all families in our database e -cards to thank them 
for their participation in our studies and also to let them know that we are recruiting participants  for multiple 
studies .We will target our recruitment to communities of lower to m iddle socioeconomic status by [CONTACT_7679]/reduced meals in the National School Lunch Program 
within the town’s public elementary schools; those data are publicly available via state -level department s of 
education. By [CONTACT_7680], we 
are confident that we can reach our enrollment target within the study period. Participants for the sub -study will 
be recruited from the group o f participants who successfully complete the main study and who express 
interest.  
 
11. Informed Consent, Assent, and Authorization  
 
All forms discussed in this section should be uploaded to the ‘ Consent Forms and Recruitment 
Materials ’ page in  Rapport  
 
a. Please describe the consent and/or assent process, addressing the following:  
 Who will obtain consent/assent from participants  
 Where the consent/assent process will take place  
 The timeframe for providing information potential participants about a study, having the  consent 
form signed, and beginning study activities  
 Any precautions taken to minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence  
v. 11/10/2021    10  The forms which will be used as well as a ny aids used to simplify scientific or technical 
information  
 How comprehension wi ll be ensured  
 
When a parent first contact s the study to express interest in having his/her child participate in the study, a 
thorough screening interview will be conducted over the phone, at which time the study procedure will be 
described in detail (including financial compensation). When the chi ld (and parent) visit the lab for their study 
appointment, trained research staff will explain the study in plain language and obtain electronic written 
consent from the parent and electronic written  assent from the child , both via REDCap . The study will b e 
promoted to the child as a study to understand how exposure to multi -media types influences children; specific 
study goals will be concealed to prevent biasing participant behavior. It will be emphasized that the child can 
choose to stop participating in  the study at any time.  Parents of children will be told the true nature of the study 
prior to providing consent for their child’s participation so that they can make an informed decision.   
 
 
b. Waiver(s) or alteration(s) may be  requested for research that in volves no more than minimal 
risk.   
Indicate requested  waiver(s) or alteration(s) below .  In addition, complete the corresponding 
section of the Waivers and Alterations Request Form  and upload it to the ‘Consent Forms and 
Recruitment Materials’ page in Rapport.      
☐  For the informed consent process  
☐ For the documentation  of informed consent  
☐  For the HIPAA Authorization to use and/or disclose PHI  
☐ For a waiver of the requirement for medical record documentatio n 
 
 
12. Compensation or Gifts  
 
Please describe any payments, gifts or reimbursements participants will receive for taking part in the 
study:  
 
For the main study, p arent/child dyads will receive increasing compensation for each visit. Specifically, 
participants will receive $ [ADDRESS_6914] appointment, $4 0 for the second visit, and $ [ADDRESS_6915] visit. Participants will also be compensated $10 for each visit when they are driving more than 15 
miles to pa rticipate. In addition, participants will receive $[ADDRESS_6916] -worn accelerometry 
between visits 1 and 2.  Parents of participants will be compensated $10 for completing a short online 
questionnaire. Participants may be compensated in the form of cash or gift cards.  
 
 
13. Privacy of Participants  
 
Note:  Methods used to obtain information about participants may have  an effect  on privacy.  For example:  
 Consent discussions or interviews held in public which concern sensitive subjects or behaviors  
 Observations of behavior, especially illicit behavior, in quasi -public settings  
 
Describe any activities or interactions which could lead to a breach of privacy and provide a plan to 
protect participant p rivacy : 
 
We will collect behavioral and socio -demographic information. Loss of privacy may lead to problems with 
insurability or social stigmatization. Data collection and analysis will be handled in a confidential manner to 
protect subject privacy. All electronic data will be stored in a passwo rd-protected and encrypted database on a 
secure Dartmouth server. All paper files will be stored in a locked file cabinet in a secure office. All subject data 
will be de -identified, and only the primary investigator and research team members who directly c ontact the 
participants will have access to the information necessary to link them to their de -identified data. The 
v. 11/10/2021    11 information collected for this study will be used only for purposes of the research as stated earlier in this form 
and data will be destroye d when it is no longer needed.  
 
 
 
14. Confidentiality of Data  
 
Note: Any person engaged in research collecting information that could cause financial, social or legal harm 
to participants may apply for a Certificate of Confidentiality .  Certificates of Confidentiality are issued by 
[CONTACT_7681] (NIH) to protect identifiable research information from forced disclosure. 
They are intended to allow the investigator and others who have access to research records to refuse to 
disclose identifying information on research participants in any civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or 
other proceeding, whether at the federal, state, or local level.   
 
a. If disclosed, could any of the data collected be considered sensitive, with the potential to 
damage financial standing, employability, insurability, or reputation?  
 
☒  No  ☐  Yes 
 
If Yes, describe the data or information, the rationale for their collec tion, and whether a 
Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained:  
 
 
 
 
b. Describe the safeguards employed to secure, share, and maintain data during the study, 
addressing any of the following which may apply:  
 Administrative, ie. coding of participant data  
 Physical, ie. use of locked file cabinets  
 Technical, ie. encrypted data systems  
 
Data collection and analysis will be handled in a confidential manner to protect participant privacy. After 
enrolment in the st udy, each participant will be assigned a participant identification number that will be used, 
rather than their names, to track data collection. All participant data will be deidentified, and only the primary 
investigator and research team members who dire ctly contact [CONTACT_7682] -identified data. All electronic data will be stored in a password -
protected and encrypted database on a secure Dartmouth server. All paper files will be st ored in a locked file 
cabinet in a secure office. The information collected for this study will be used only for purposes of the 
research.  
 
c. Describe the plan for storage or destruction of data upon study completion:  
 
All information and for the purpose of this research will be destroyed when it is no longer needed.

 Methodology  
Design  
This study is a randomized controlled trial with two treatment groups – the ProtonicsTM 
knee brace group and the sport cord group. Subjects with PFPS were asked to complete a series 
of open -chain hamstring resistance exercises with either apparatus, for which the procedures are 
described below, for four weeks. After the inte rvention, knee joint function and clinical 
symptoms of PFPS were assessed and compared between groups.  
Participant s 
Subjects were recruited based on the following inclusion criteria: male or female18 -45 
years of age; has exhibited patellofemoral pain symptoms for more than [ADDRESS_110358] a pain 
level ≥ 3 on the NPRS; has experienced pain during at least 2  functional  activities, such as 
squatting, ascending/descending stairs, and/or running. Individuals who had experienced traumatic 
injuries to the kn ee joint or lower extremity, displayed signs or symptoms of a meniscus lesion or 
ligamentous -related pathology, had been diagnosed with a neurological disorder, diabetes, 
osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, or rheumatoid arthritis, or reported taking any over -the-counter pain 
medications during the study period were excluded from the study. Screening of subjects was done 
by a licensed physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_100206] (OCS) 
with over [ADDRESS_110359] group using simple randomization  (Figure 1) . All participants were required to  sign an 
informed consent form. This study was approved by [CONTACT_100216]://clinicaltrials.gov (registration number NC T03042559).

 Procedures   
Subjects assigned to the ProtonicsTM knee brace group were asked to perform warm up 
exercises, followed by [CONTACT_100217] 
(PTP)18. The Protonics system  has  been introduced to physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_100207] a potential treatment 
for PFPS. The system includes a brace set to resist knee flexion and a set of specific exercises to 
perform daily. Through resistance to knee flexion, the system is advertised to decrease ret ropatellar 
contact [CONTACT_100218]. Specifically, 
resistance to knee flexion is purported to increase hamstring activity and inhibit the activity of the 
tensor fasciae latae and psoas muscles. The ma nufacturer asserts that prolonged use of the system 
results in greater hamstring activation, which leads to permanent structural changes through 
reciprocal inhibition at the hip and pelvis18. The phases of the intervention are summarized in Table 
1. The warm -up consisted of the subject wearing the ProtonicsTM knee brace set at a moderate 
resistance level and flexing the knees while sitting, standing, and reclining in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_100208]. The exercises, were done in sets of [ADDRESS_110360] s according 
to the following classification scheme: light (pi[INVESTIGATOR_100209]) with resistance 3 (R3), 0 -30 lbs.; medium 
(orange color) with resistance 5 (R5) 0 -50 lbs.; heavy (yellow color) with resistance 7 (R7) [ADDRESS_110361] session, at two weeks, and at 4 weeks.  
Compliance  
Several methods were employed to maximize subjects’ compliance: During the initial visit, 
subjects were provided a thorough educational session on the appropriate use of the sport  cord and 
knee brace and were given the opportunity to ask questions at any p oint of the study. The 
educational session included oral instructions as well as brochures which subjects could refer to 
for complete written instructions and visual depi[INVESTIGATOR_100210].  As the study 
was divided into three phases, subje cts were asked to visit the lab at least three times and to return 
for additional visits if they wished. Additionally, a log sheet was filled out by [CONTACT_100219]

 completion of his/her exercises at home. Finally, text message reminders were sent to  each subject 
throughout the study.  
Outcome Measures  
The primary outcome measures of the study can be divided into two categories: clinical 
outcomes and functional outcomes.  
Clinical Outcome Measures:  
APT  was assessed using a palpation meter (PALM) incli nometer with the subject in the 
standing position; one arm of the caliper was placed on the anterior superior iliac spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (ASIS) 
while the other was positioned on the posterior superior iliac spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (PSIS). This technique was 
shown to be a reliable way of a ssessing sagittal pelvic position 19. As described by [CONTACT_100220], 
subjects wer e required to stand on a [ADDRESS_110362] during palpation 20.  
Hip internal/external rotation active range of motion (ROM) was measured from sitting 
position as follows: the measured hip was placed at 90 degrees flexion, in neutral position between 
adduction and abduction, and knee joint at 90 degrees flexion , as described by [CONTACT_100221] 
21. While the contralateral hip placed on 30 degrees abduction. Using a fluid -filled inclinometer 
placed parallel to the shaft of distal tibia and proximal to medial malleolus. The tibia was vertically  
aligned at starting position and then the inclinometer was calibrated to zero  22.  
Iliotibial band flexibility was measured using a modified version of the Ober’s test in which 
an inclinometer was placed at the distal lateral thigh. In which, zero degree was recorded when 
thigh was horizontal, positive value was recorded if the thigh was abducted, and a negative value 
was recorded if the thi gh was addu cted past horizontal  23,24. 
Functional Outcome Measures  
6 
 Patient satisfaction  was measured using  the GROC scales, which is a commonly used 
method for quantify ing subjects’ self -perceived progress or decline over time. The GROC is scored 
on 15 -point numerical scale from -7 to +7 where  -7 represents “a  very gre at deal worse,” 0 
represents “ about the same” and +7 represents “ a very great deal better”  25. An a priori score of ≥5 
was identified as the cut -off of a successful outcome  25. The validity and reliability of the GROC 
scales has been demonstrated in multiple  studies 26,27.   
 
The Kujala score is a 13 -item self -reported questionnaire, which quantifies subjects’ 
reported pain levels during a wide variety of activities. The scale highest scores are  100 points, 
which indicate lower disability. It has been shown to be  a reliable  and valid method for assessing 
functional outcomes in subjects with knee pain 28,29.  
The NPRS is a self -reported questionnaire with adequate reliability and validity  28. Subjects 
were asked to rate their level of pain at baseline from three different referen ce points: the greatest 
amount of knee pain they had experienced, the least amount of knee pain they had experienced, 
and the level of knee pain that they were currently experiencing. These three values were then 
averaged to create a baseline measure of pa in for each subject. All subsequent questionnaires 
corresponded only to subjects’ present level of knee pain.  
Finally, the lateral step down  test (LSDT) is a  measure of functionality that has been 
demonstrated to be both reliable and valid 30. Subjects were instructed to stand with the test leg on 
a 15-cm step. They were then instructed to lower their body enough to cause the heel of the 
opposite leg to make conta ct with the floor directly in front of the step, and subsequently return 
the knee to the fully extended position. This represented  a single repetition. Subjects completed as 
many repetitions as they could within [ADDRESS_110363] group.  
Data analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics Software version 24.0 (IBM Corp, 
Armonk, NY). Mean + SD was computed for quantitative variables and frequencies (%) for 
categorical variables. Normality of quantitative variables was assessed using Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilk test 
and boxplots. We compared mean age (years), Body Mass Index (kg/m2) (BMI), pain duration, 
and the outcome measures at baseline in both groups at baseline using independent t -test when the 
distribution of the variable was approximately normal and Mann -Whitney test when the 
distribution was not normal. The distribution of qualitative variables (gender, affected leg) by 
[CONTACT_100222]. To examine the effect of the type of intervention 
on outcome measures over time (base line versus immediate versus two weeks versus four weeks), 
a 2x4 mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted while controlling for age at baseline since the mean 
age was significantly different between the two groups. The level of significance was set at p< 
0.05.  
Results  
Subjects’ Demographics  
A total of 43  subjects with mean age of 28.8±5.0 years and body mass index of 25.6±4.7 
kg/m2 participated in the study. One subject was excluded as they had a meniscus lesion that 
prohibited them fr om participating in the study, and an other subject voluntarily left the study du e 
8 
 to personal time constraints, therefore only data from the 41 remaining subjects who completed 
the prescribed intervention was analyzed. Fifty -one percent of the subjects were males (n = 21) 
and the  majority had their right knee affected (56.1%, n=23. Twenty -one subjects (51.2%) were in 
the ProtonicsTM brace group and 20 (48.8%) in the sport  cord group. There was no significant 
difference between the two groups in mean baseline characteristics and ou tcome measures at 
baseline except for age (30.8±5.6 vs. 26.7±3.0, p=0.01) and LSDT score (7.0± 2.8 vs. 9.1±2.7, 
p=0.02, Table 2 ).  
Clinical Outcomes  
Clinical improvement of subjects’ patellofemoral movement impairments  were  assessed 
using  four indicators: APT , hip internal/external rotation, and iliotibial band flexibility. Ba sed on 
the results from all four  indicators, a significant improvement was seen in all cases for bo th study 
groups for four weeks (p<0.001, Tables 3&4). APT , hip internal rotation, hip  external rotation, 
and iliotibial band flexibility were measured at baseline, immediately following the first session, 
at two weeks, and at four weeks. The degree of APT  decreased significantly in brace and sport  
cord groups (59.8% vs. 38.9%, p<0.001; res pectively), however those in the brace group had 
sharper and quicker decrease in APT  (Table 4). Hip internal rotation also increased significantly 
in both groups over the course of the study (p<0.001, Table 4). Similarly, hip external rotation 
significantl y increased for both groups (p<0.001, Table 4). Lastly, iliotibial band flexibility 
increased significantly (p<0.001) for both the brace group and sport cord groups by 87.4% and 
62.5%, respectively, with those in the brace group achieving a lower but non -significant mean 
score (Table 4).  
Functional Outcome s 
[ADDRESS_110364] group at the end of the four -week intervention (p<0.01, Table 3). There were no 
significant differences between the two groups with respect to the other three outcomes. The results 
of the Kujala score indicated that there was a significant improvement in knee function for both 
groups (13.7% vs. 10.3%, p<0.001, Table 3). The mean score for the brace group improved by 
74.6%, while those in the sport cord group had 47.4% improvement. All subjects were able to 
perform significantly better on the lateral step test post -intervent ion ((p<0.001, Table 4). The brace 
group exhibited a 133.3% improvement in their performance, while those in the sport cord group 
demonstrated only an 85.3% improvement. NPRS score decreased significantly for both groups 
after four weeks ((p<0.001, Table 3 ).

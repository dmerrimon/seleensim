3)Objectives*
The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a biologic drug targeting 
the IL-[ADDRESS_1200997] (secukinumab) on brain plasticity and examine whether 
the plastic changes correlate with the improvement of perception of well-
being, itch, and pain in patients with psoriasis. 
4)Background*
Psoriasis is a chronic skin inflammatory disease, affecting 2 % of people in the US. 
Following Interleukin-17 (IL-17) neutralization, patients with psoriasis experience 
rapid changes in their well-being and mood. Though IL-17 neutralization-induced 
improvement in plaques and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score takes 
weeks, patients often state they feel significantly less pain and itch, and note 
improved mood after only one injection (Yosipovitch et al., 2019). It is currently 
unknown how IL-17 neutralization affects the improved perceptions of patients 
with psoriasis so rapi[INVESTIGATOR_861558]–brain barrier. 
Previous drug trials using DMARDS and TNF inhibitors for psoriatic and 
inflammatory joint disease have shown neuroplastic changes in the brain (Baliki et 
al. 2005, Harvey et al. 2012). The potent new generation of biologic drugs targeting 
IL-[ADDRESS_1200998] on psoriasis than the drugs mentioned 
above (Yosipovitch et al., 2019). Therefore, assessing the effect of these drugs on 
brain plasticity and correlating it to the improvement of itch, pain and perception of 
well-being is a timely topic to investigate.
The aim of this study is to elucidate brain mechanisms associated with perceptions 
of well-being and improvements in itch and/or pain after use of a potent effective 
treatment for psoriasis using IL-17 neutralization.
5)Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria*

We will use statistical parametric mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (SPM, https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk) and 
voxel-based morphometry (VBM, http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de) for the MRI data 
analyses. We will compare the whole brain gray matter density (VBM) and baseline brain 
activity (ASL) obtained at the first study visit between psoriasis patients and healthy 
controls to identify brain regions that show significant changes in the gray matter density 
and activity in psoriasis patients. We will investigate compare the gray matter density and 
activity in the identified brain regions alter overtime between the 1st study visit and other 
study visits as well as follow up visit in psoriasis patients. We will conduct the same 
analysis in healthy controls. Statistical significance applied to the MRI data analysis 
(VBM and ASL) will be set at FWE p < 0.05 corrected for the whole brain. For the 
correlation analyses, statistical significance will be set at p < 0.05.

All of the data, including records of subjects, source documents, and informed 
consent will be kept in the study center ([ADDRESS_1201007], RMSB 7097 & 7099, 
Miami FL [ZIP_CODE]) under lock for [ADDRESS_1201008] protected computers of UM approved cloud storage.
12)Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects*
The study team will be responsible for protecting the safety, rights, and 
well-being of study participants. The participants’ vital signs (e.g., 
communication with participants in the MRI scanner) will be monitored. 
Recording and reporting of adverse events that occur during the course of 
the study will help to ensure the continuing safety of participants. Local 
and systemic adverse events will be monitored during the study. 
In case an adverse event does take place, a documentation system will be 
used to record the following information: description of event, time/date 
of onset, duration of reaction, relationship to study proceedures/drug, and 
seriousness/severity (based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events v4). 
Study stoppage will occur if 40 subjects complete the study or if a severe 
adverse event related to the study occurs.

investigators are responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_861561]. 
Safety screening: In Zone II (bathroom and waiting area of the MRI 
environment), research participants will complete a metal screen and 
remove all metal objects. Women must remove their underwire bras. 
Gowns are provided, if desired. After reviewing these forms, the MRI 
technologist will determine if the research participant is eligible to scan. 
The original forms will be kept in a locked file cabinet and filed according 
to date in the MRI facility and a copy will be given to the investigator.
Incidental findings: [CONTACT_861587] (Associate Professor of 
Radiology, Neuroradiology section and Medical Director of the 
Applebaum Diagnostic Imaging Center) will review a baseline structural 
scan from each subject that undergoes an MRI for any incidental findings. 
She will generate a summary report and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_861562]. Also a copy of this MRI 
summary report will be provided to the subject to all them in order to  
communicate the findings with their medical doctor. The subject may also 
request a DVD of their brain images.
13)Withdrawal of Subjects*
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation in this study at any 
time, for any reason, and without prejudice.
Subjects must be withdrawn from the study if:
1) A subject withdraws consent. 
2) The Investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to be 
removed from the study.
3) If the subject experiences greater than a mild adverse event. (Subjects 
that experience a mild adverse event will be asked if they would like to 
continue the study. The occurrence of a severe adverse event will 
trigger the study to stop for safety purposes.)
4)Failed COVID-19 checks, including COVID-19 screening questionnaire and 
temperature check, required by [CONTACT_861584].
The data collected before the withdrawal will still be used in data analysis.

Page 12 of 1914)Risks to Subjects*
1. MRI. 
There are no foreseeable risks to a participant as all measures have been taken to 
ensure their safety. The participant may only run the risk of feeling claustrophobic 
when they are within the MRI scanner. All participants will be given the 
opportunity to experience the scanner in a mock environment. 
Magnetic fields do not cause harmful effects at the levels used in the MRI 
machine. However, the MR scanner uses a very strong magnet that will attract 
some metals and affect some electronic devices. If the participant has a cardiac 
pacemaker or any other biomedical device in or on your body, it is very important 
they you tell the operator/investigator immediately. As metallic objects may 
experience a strong attraction to the magnet, it is also very important that they 
notify the operator of any metal objects (especially surgical clips), devices, or 
implants that are in or on their body before entering the magnet room. All such 
objects must be removed (if possible) before entering the magnet room. In some 
cases, having those devices means you should not have an MRI scan performed.  
In addition, watches and credit cards should also be removed as these could be 
damaged.  The participant will be provided a way to secure these items. If the 
participant has any history of head or eye injury involving metal fragments, if 
they have ever worked in a metal shop, or if they could be pregnant, they should 
notify the operator/investigator.  
There is a possibility the participant will experience a localized twitching 
sensation due to the magnetic field changes during the scan. This is expected and 
should not be painful. Dizziness or nausea may occur if you move your head 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_138380].
IF THE PARTICPANT FEELS DISCOMFORT AT ANY TIME, THEY 
CAN NOTIFY THE OPERATOR AND CAN DISCONTINUE THE EXAM 
AT ANY TIME.
The scans performed in this study are for specific research purposes and are not 
optimized to find medical abnormalities. The investigators for this project may 
not be trained to perform medical diagnosis. The investigators are not responsible 
for failure to find existing abnormalities with these MRI scans. However, on 
occasion the investigator may notice a finding on an MRI scan that seems 
abnormal. When this occurs, a physician will be consulted as to whether the 
findings merit further investigation, in which case the investigator will contact

with further examination or treatment lies solely with you and your physician.  
The investigators, the consulting physician, and the University of Miami are not 
responsible for any examination or treatment that you undertake based on these 
findings. Because the images collected in this study may not comprise a proper 
clinical MRI scan, these images will not be made available for diagnostic 
purposes. 
Women of Childbearing Potential: If any participant is pregnant or currently 
breast-feeding, they may not participate in any of our studies involving MRIs. The 
participant must understand that if they are pregnant or become pregnant, or if they 
are breast-feeding during this study, themselves or their child may be exposed to an 
unknown risk. 
2. Injection of Secukinumab: The injection of Secukinumab may increase the risk 
of infection. Patients may experience nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, and upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092].
3. Protected Health Information (PHI). Protected Health Information 
(PHI) will be collected during the study. Every attempt will be made to 
ensure that this PHI is kept secure. All study data will be kept in a locked 
office and kept under password protection on a computer that is only 
accessible by [CONTACT_3462].

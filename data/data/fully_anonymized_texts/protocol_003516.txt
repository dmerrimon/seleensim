 Background and Introduction  
 
Perinatal depression occurs in 12% –15% of pregnant and postpartum women and is associated 
with adverse outcomes for mother, baby, and family, including preterm birth, low 
birth   weight, and impaired cognitive development of the child (Ko, Rockhill,Tong, Morrow, 
& Farr, 2017; Martin, Hamilton, Osterman, Curtin, & Matthews, 2015; Bonari et al., 2004; Deave, Heron, Evans, & Emond, 2008) Early breastfeeding cessation and reduced ability to parent are also well -documented consequences (Bonari et  al., 2004). Nonpharmacological 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness- based practices 
(MBP), are known to be as effective as antidepressants for mild to moderate depression, and many pregnant and breastfeeding women prefer not to take antidepressants (O'Connor, Rossom, Henninger, Groom, & Burda, 2016; O'Mahen & Flynn, 2008). However, limited access to and availability of mental health professionals are common barriers to services among women living in rural and low- resource communities (Alang, 2015; Bloom, Bullock, & 
Parsons, 2012). Lack of consideration for cultural and ethnic variation also creates an additional barrier for many women (for example, Hispanic) (O'Mahen & Flynn, 2008; Baker-Ericzen et al., 2012; Goodman, Dimidjian, & Williams, 2013, The Health Resources and Service Administration [HRSA], 2012). Recommendations for universal screening for perinatal depression during pregnancy and postpartum have left many women and their providers searching for solutions to the c urrent 
scarcity of resources available to women who screen positive. Telehealth is revolutionizing the delivery of healthcare services and is a promising platform for perinatal mental health care (HRSA, 2012). A telehealth approach will reduce barriers to access and can be tailored to 
deliver effective services regardless of geographic location (HRSA, 2012). Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_283711] a group video conference intervention (VCI) to deliver nonpharmacological services (CBT an d MBP) to women experiencing perinatal 
depressive symptoms (PDS) (Latendresse, Dorn, Ozawa-Kirk, & Allred, in review; Latendresse et al., in review). Our research team incorporated participant feedback into revising the VCI, including the use of a low- cost, easy -to-access Web -based platform and use 
of any electronic device (laptop, tablet, smartphone, or landline) to join facilitated VCI groups of six women. To build on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], we propose to evaluate the effectiveness of the VCI to reduce PDS and an xiety (a highly comorbid condition) by [CONTACT_14664] a randomized 
controlled trial among women experiencing mild to moderate PDS, as measured by [CONTACT_283718] (EPDS).  
 
 
 
Purpose and Objectives  
 
The study will evaluate the effectiveness of a videoconference intervention (VCI) to reduce 
perinatal depression symptoms (PDS) and anxiety (a highly co -morbid condition) by 
[CONTACT_14664] a randomized controlled trial among women experiencing mild to moderate PDS, as measured by [CONTACT_283719] (EPDS). Furthermore, we propose 
to evaluate differences in response to the VCI between subgroups of childbearing women; Hispanic and North European Descent populations, and rural and urban- dwelling.   
Protocol Summary (ERICA)   IRB_00113917 
Page 3 of 13  IRB Approval 11/17/2022 
  
Specific aims of the study include:  
Aim 1: Evaluate the effectiveness of a VCI to reduce PDS and anxiety, as measured by [CONTACT_283720]- 7 Item (GAD -7) scores across pregnancy and the 
postpartum. Methods: Pregnant women of all gestational age up to 6 months postpartum (n = 240) who screen positive for mild to moderate PDS (EPDS scores 9–20) will be randomly assigned to VCI or AC for eight weeks. Both groups will continue with standard care as directed by [CONTACT_283721]/prenatal care providers. The EPDS and GAD- 7 will be administered 
at three time points during pregnancy and at 2, 4, and 6 months postpartum. Hypothesis: Women participating in the VCI will have significantly lower post intervention EPDS and GAD-7 scores across pregnancy and postpartum than women in the AC group. 
Secondary Aim 1: Explore differences in the effectiveness of the VCI to reduce PDS and anxiety across women who enroll at different stages of their pregnancy or postpartum periods. 
Aim 2: Evaluate the interaction of the VCI with specific subgroups: ethnicity (Hispanic, North 
European descent), geographic location (rural, urban), and the outcome of PDS as measured by [CONTACT_283722]-7 scores across pregnancy and postpartum. We will oversample in Hispanic and rural populations to ensure sufficient representation from diverse groups. Hypothesis: Women will demonstrate differences in EPDS and GAD -7 scores across pregnancy and 
postpartum, dependent on their study group membership. 
Secondary Aim 2: Explore an additional subgroup analysis, namely between those who are 
and who are not taking medication at the time of screening.

Study  Procedures  
 
Recruitment/Participant Identification Process : 
VCI/AC Sessions  
Each study clinical site has implemented a universal electronic screening for perinatal 
depression, which ensures that all women receiving services at all study facilities are screened during pregnancy and postpartum. In addition, staff at the collaborating sites inform women about the study by [CONTACT_283723]. No one is involved in consenting participants or in delivering the interventions. Flyers could be handed out to potential participants or would be available at study sites (e.g., on walls with site's approval). Handing out flyers would help patients think about participating in the study for those who cannot make a decision at the study site.  Screening i ncludes the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale 
(EPDS) and is self -completed by [CONTACT_283724] a clinical office visit. Patients 
complete the screening in the clinic using an electronic device (tablet, computer, or their own Smartphone) as soon as possible when they come in. Screening results are integrated into the Electronic Health Record (EHR) and/or electronic database managed by [CONTACT_232355]. Results are immediately available electronically to the patient and her healthcare provider for evaluation, management and/or referral. These electronic screening results are also available to study staff for the purposes of identifying potential study participants, i.e. positive screening results (greater than 9 on EPDS). The electronic screeni ng process 
conveniently includes an item that allows patients to indicate their interest in receiving additional information and/or agreement to be contact[CONTACT_39804] a potential research participant. Those who agree will be contact[CONTACT_283725]. Alternatively, a patient can contact [CONTACT_283726]. Women who screen positive, are determined eligible to participate by [CONTACT_464], and are interested in participating are contact[CONTACT_283727]. Informed consent is completed by [CONTACT_283728]. The consent form is sent to potential participants via REDCap email or the U.S. Postal Service, if there is no email address. Eligibility is confirmed through EHR, particularly for confirming gestational age, maternal age, medication status, mental health diagnoses, etc. All potential participants are screened for suicidal and homicidal ideation, and if either are present the individual is immediately referred to a mental health professional for further evaluation, and to determine appropriateness for participating in the study.

 Social media  (Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook) will also be used to recruit and inform 
potential participants about the study. Short video clips will be played on clinic monitor 
screens with information about the study and small study cards will be available to take home if interested in the study. The study staff will also utilize community events to raise awareness of the study.  
Radio advertisements will be used to recruit participants for the study. This will specifically be relevant for the Latina population, based on feedback from community partners. 
QR code/survey link will be used to recruit participants by [CONTACT_283729]. 
We will coordinate with members of the data science service at the University of Utah to 
identify patients who (1) have agreed to be contac ted regarding research studies and (2) meet 
our inclusion criteria.  Members of the data science service will share a report with the research team that includes patient information, such as: name, age, sex, ethnicity, pregnancy/postpartum status, email, and mobile phone number.  The research team will use this information to send study invitations via email (and printed mail, if needed) to potential participants.  These emails will include information for easy -to-follow steps for opting out of 
the study.  Individuals who elect to opt-out of the study will be removed from future communication and their information will be removed from study data.  Anonymous demographic data from opt-out individuals may be retained for the purposes of describing the demographics of the total population considered for this study.  Individuals who do not elect to opt-out will be contact[CONTACT_49496] (up to three times) by [CONTACT_5051], either via email, 
phone call, text, or print mail. 
Focus Groups 
Participants for the pre- intervention Latina focus groups will be recruited via word of mouth, 
community events, social media, video clips in clinics, and recruitment flyers, utilizing study 
staff's contacts within the Latina community. These same methods will be used to recruit partic ipants for the main study arm. 
Participants for the additional focus groups related to perceptions of mental health and recruitment will be recruited through the Community Collaboration & Engagement Team (CCET) at the University of Utah. An informational r ecruitment flyer will inform potential 
participants of the opportunity to participate. Note: American Indian populations will not be recruited without proper approval from appropriate groups

Enrollment  
Women who have indicated an interest in participating in the study will be contact[CONTACT_426] a 
study team member by [CONTACT_3649], telephone and/or email to discuss the study and complete the 
Protocol Summary (ERICA)   IRB_00113917 
Page 7 of 13  IRB Approval 11/17/2022 
 informed consent process. During that time, eligibility is confirmed through EHR (please see 
the #4b recruitment/participant identification process), particularly for confirming gestational 
age, maternal age, medication status, mental health diagnoses, etc. All potential participants are screened for suicidal and homicidal ideation, and if either are present the individual is immediately referred to a mental health professional for further evaluat ion, and to determine 
appropriateness for participating in the study.  
Latina Focus Groups  
Those enrolled in the pre-intervention focus groups will participate in a 1-hour focus group. Participants will give feedback on how to tailor the intervention and control group content to best serve Latina participants. There will be a total of [ADDRESS_346593] focused on rural 
Hispanic/Latina women, the second focused on the general rural population, and the third on the rural American Indian/Alaska Native population. These women will receive a $[ADDRESS_346594] to Amazon or a local grocery  store electronically or by [CONTACT_2319].  Note: American Indian 
populations will not be recruited or enrolled without proper approval from appropriate groups 
Stratified Randomization Into Study Groups 
After consenting to participate, women will be assigned by [CONTACT_22123] -generated randomization 
by [CONTACT_283735] (Hispanic/NED and Urban/Rural) to one of two study groups: 
Videoconference intervention (VCI) or Attention Control. Both groups will continue with standard of care as directed by [CONTACT_283736]. After randomization, the participant will receive study information pertinent to her specific study group, by [CONTACT_283737]/or emailed electronic document. Enrollment and randomization will continue until the following enrollment goals are met.  
VCI Participants  
A study team member will contact [CONTACT_283738]/or email to determine which group start date works best for her and to schedule a time for technology testing and instruction. 
All Participants: Technology Litera cy 
Prior to the start date of the first VCI or AC session, each participant will meet with study 
staff for the purpose of (1) assessing the participant’s technology literacy, (2) testing the participant’s Internet connection and chosen electronic device, and (3) providing instruction and demonstration for connecting to the videoconference platform (Acano). More than one 
meeting may be required and will include meeting via Acano and troubleshooting directly 
Protocol Summary (ERICA)   IRB_00113917 
Page 8 of 13  IRB Approval 11/17/[ADDRESS_346595] VCI or AC group session, participants will be scheduled for a 30- minute 
Acano or phone meeting with the individual who will be facilitating the participant’s assigned group. The purpose of the meeting is for the facilitator to (1) establish a one-on-one connection with the participant prior to the start of the group, (2) repeat the technology check with the participant, and (3) identify any concerns that would disqualify the woman from study participation (e.g., serious mental health conditions, including severe depression or suicidal ideation that may need immediate referral for more intensive therapy and/or pharmacotherapy).  
Group VCI Sessions 
Using the UTN-supported Acano platform, women will attend weekly, 1-hour videoconference sessions with 4–5 other participants (max imum n = 6), for a total of 10 
sessions: one initial session for getting acquainted with one another and the program, eight sessions for engagement in the VCI intervention, and a follow-up “reunion” 6–[ADDRESS_346596] session. Members of the Latina community will be enrolled in study groups that will include 15 minutes of extra mental health content, based on recommendations from the focus groups done in the community and their needs (actual intervention content will not be altered, just additional me ntal health background will be included). Participants will attend each 
session using their own Internet connection and electronic device (computer, laptop, electronic tablet, smart phone) to connect to Acano. Alternatively, participants can connect via the Internet without video, or as a last resort can simply call in by [CONTACT_283739]. The intervention is a standardized and manualized program called UPLIFT (Using Practice and Learning to Increase Favorable Thoughts), developed and evaluated by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Thompson. UPLIFT is an 8-week group intervention based on CBT and MBP, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_283712]. Originally developed as an online and telephone- based approach, we have adapt ed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_283713] a pregnant population.12,13 Our revised telehealth approach has several advantages over conventional in-person therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including (1) improved accessibility to therapy among working, low-income, and r ural-dwelling mothers, 
and those with time, childcare, and transportation barriers; (2) the ability to develop a supportive community among other mothers of similar risk status and life circumstances; (3) the ability for women to build an effective skill s et for the prevention and treatment of 
depression that can last a lifetime; (4) the addition of nonverbal communication between group participants and the facilitator when videoconferencing is used; and (5) sufficient time to acquire and practice Mindfulne ss-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  skills early in 
pregnancy, prior to baby’s arrival and the postpartum period, when the risk of depression is highest. After the 8-week intervention, a cohort “reunion” will be held approximately 6–[ADDRESS_346597] described was developed based on the strong 
recommendations of participants in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], including the initial pre -UPLIFT meeting

Each participant will also 
receive the UPLIFT manual (print and/or electronic document), which contains details and resources for each sessi on. Sessions will focus on increasing knowledge about depression and 
pregnancy, CBT, and MBP. Participants will learn and practice skills related to CBT and mindfulness, and engage in discussions and group exercises for each session’s main topic. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_283714], identifying distortions in thoughts, self- esteem, 
identification of problems, goal setting, and achieving support. Exercises include relaxation; body scan; progressive muscle relaxation; attention to breath, sights, and sounds; and meditation. Each week, participants will be provided with recommendations for between-session practices, which will be discussed at the beginning of the next class.  
Attention Control (AC) Group 
Women who are randomized into the AC will participate in an 10- week education program 
delivered by [CONTACT_283740]. The education program is manualized and designed to enhance participant knowledge related to pregnancy, childbirth, newborn care, and feeding, or parenting young babies . All participants in the AC group will 
receive a mailed hard copy and/or emailed electronic packet (participant’s choice) that includes topi[INVESTIGATOR_283715], which includes information about perinatal depression and mood disorders (e.g., anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder, postpartum psychosis), interpretation of EPDS scores, common therapi[INVESTIGATOR_283716], local resources for obtaining therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and encouragement to discuss their EPDS scores with their prenatal care provider. This approach provides a control group that reduces bias as much as possible, and most closely reflects an optimal care level that includes screening and patient education for all pregnant and postpartum women. 
Data Collection  
Data collected for this study will come from the following sources: Clinical universal screening records (the EPDS in the electronic health record [EHR]), participant -completed 
study questionnaires, audio-recorded VCI sessions, and participant focus groups. EPDS is a validated survey. 
Clinical Screening Records  
Screening that is completed in the clinical setting as part of their routine clinical care is 
immediately communicated to and addressed by [CONTACT_283741]. EPDS and GAD -7 measurements completed periodically a nd

care) are evaluated and addressed by [CONTACT_283743] 24-48 hours of completion. 
Participants are contact[CONTACT_283744] >[ADDRESS_346600] information. 
Participant -Completed Questionnaires 
Questionnaires will be completed by [CONTACT_38444] a secure, Web -based data management 
system (REDCap). Women in all study groups will receive an emailed link to the questionnaire. Study questionnaires are to be completed at six time points: T1 = enrollment; T2 = after group session 9; T3 = [ADDRESS_346601] session 9 T4 = [ADDRESS_346602] session 9; T5=[ADDRESS_346603] session 9; T6= [ADDRESS_346604]: depressive symptoms, as well as the GAD -7 as a measure of comorbid an xiety (GAD -7 is a 
validated survey). To document the standard of care that all participants receive during study participation, the questionnaire at all six -time points also asks participants to report whether 
they (1) received a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, or other mental health condition; (2) were prescribed or initiated any medication for depression or anxiety; (3) were referred to and/or engaged in mental health services; and/or (4) have engaged in any type of nonpharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_283717]/anxiety during the study. If a participant does not have an email 
address, study staff will assist her to establish and access a free email address. All participants will receive instruction on how to access and complete the study questionnaires. The entire questionnaire takes approximately 15 minutes to complete. Participants receive $[ADDRESS_346605] group session (VCI or AC). The purpose of the focus group is to collect data directly from participants regarding satisfaction with the program, e.g. program content, videoconference platform, development of community, support, suggestions for improvement, etc. Participants receive $[ADDRESS_346606] -protected file system, backed up continuously, and protected

Data Analysis  
We will use multilevel generalized mixed modeling under an intent- to-treat approach to 
compare the outcome measures of EPDS and GAD-7 between group 1 (VCI) and Group 2 (AC) at six -time points during pregnancy and postpartum. This is an appropriate statistical 
approach for the described RCT protocol. Sensitivity analysis was conducted with G- Power 
3.1. We used RMANOVA with [ADDRESS_346608] of Intervention X Time. For 
study aim 1: Using RMANOVA with alpha = 0.5, [ADDRESS_346609] deviation of 5. For study aim 2: For the stratified samples of urban/rural or Hispanic/NED, we have greater than [ADDRESS_346610] Administrator will be expected to update the clinicaltrials.gov listing every 6 months, or as needed during recruitment.  
We also plan to present our findings at conferences and publish the findings.

North European- descent  (NED) = 60 (n = 30 VCI; 30 AC); Rural NED = 60 (n = 30 VCI; 30 
AC), for a total of 240 participants. 
Data Analysis:  
We will compare demographics, partum group, and medications between groups (χ2) to document the results of our randomization process. We will further document and test for differences in frequency and means in groups related to additional study- related variables. 
Examples include dose of participation and birth complications or pre- term deliveries. We will 
explore the addition of these variables in our analytical models. 
We will utilize multilevel generalized mixed modeling (via SPSS and R) under an intent- to-
treat (ITT) approach to compare the outcome measures of EPDS and GAD-7 between Group 1 (VCI) and Group 2 (AC) at up to six time points. To assess whether we will need to nest participants within clusters (Level 3, group- level) given that the intervention/control are 
administered in groups, we will conduct an analysis that adds an additional level (nesting participants within clusters) to our proposed model and calculate the model’s ICC.As an exploratory analysis, for both aims, we will add the fixed effect of baby’s sex to final models 
and report results.

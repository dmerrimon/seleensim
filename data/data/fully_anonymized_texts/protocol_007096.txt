and Hoffman’s reflex testing . The primary investigator is not accepting 
any personal compensation.  
 Objectives  and Hypothesis(es)  
 
The hypothesis we hope to test is if treating individuals with multiple sclerosis 
(MS) at the peripheral nervous system (PNS) level in golgi  tendon organ and 
muscle spi[INVESTIGATOR_754255] a direct current through the NeuBie electrical stimulation 
device can inhibit spasticity and improve functional mobility in clinically 
significant measures. There are two significant structures within the PNS that ha ve 
a significant impact on spasticity level closely monitored by [CONTACT_42897] (CNS). These structures are muscle spi[INVESTIGATOR_754256]. These structures when 
function ing normally within a fully intact neurological system are protective against 
over stretch in muscle, or tendon and bone injury causing reflexive counterforce or 
droppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a weight that is too heavy. In an individual with MS the CNS is over -
protective and c auses the threshold for stretch reflex and muscle tightness to be set 
lower than normal. This inhibits normal movement and causes abnormalities in 
posture, stiffness and at times joint contractures. In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_754257], which creates mechanoreceptor 
inputs and lengthening at the sarcomere level  of muscle and joints in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_754258], to alter the proprioceptive PNS at muscle spi[INVESTIGATOR_754259] a change in CNS over -guarding  during the treatment and after the treatment. If 
we are able to create normalized stretch and muscle tension at the PNS level, it may 
be possible to create temporary or sustained CNS level changes. This would allow 
the amount of stretch and tension at the  PNS level to be normalized and possibly 
reduce spasticity. If this theory is accurate, we may be able to increase access to 
 
 Page 2 of 13   
normalized movement, strength and functional ability in individuals with neuro -
compromise.  
 
Approximately 66%6 to 84%1 of individu als with multiple sclerosis experience 
various levels of debilitating spasticity6 limiting freedom of movement at ankles, 
knees and hips causing deficits in ambulation, weakness from disuse of muscles not 
accessible due to spasticity. Per the North America n Research Committee on 
Multiple Sclerosis1, a survey was conducted on spasticity prevalence and results 
show 84%[ADDRESS_1032343] (RST) fibers and excitatory 
bulbopontine tegmentum. RST neurons receive direct somatic, vestibular, tectal, 
cerebellar and motor excitatory input and are scattered in the ventral and lateral 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_754260]1. The peripheral Golgi 
tendon organ of muscle tendon and muscle spi[INVESTIGATOR_754261] l fibers and heavily influence the degree 
of spasticity and overactive stretch reflexes1,10.  
 
 Those who deal with all levels of spasticity use compensatory movement 
strategies causing altered arthrokinematics and have loss of strength, balance and 
efficient muscle use with postural changes. Spasticity management has been studied 
and treated from a pharmaceutical standpoi nt with some improvements but often 
side effects including fatigue, muscle weakness and cognition limit dosing in oral 
Baclofen, Dantrolene Sodium, Tizanidine and Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]1. Marijuana 
especially in form of cannabinoids shows mixed evidence for spast icity 
improvement and is a growing area of interest. There is a growing CBD interest in 
the MS population due to known reduction of CNS neurodegeneration in animal 
MS studies and no significant negative side effects with possible mild to moderate 
improveme nt in spasticity levels1. Therapy interventions offered include frequent 
stretching especially of muscles that cross two joints including lumbricals, 
hamstrings, gastrocnemius and iliopsoas; light stroking over lower limbs 
demonstrated a 30% decrease in H -reflex amplitude lasting even 30 minutes after 
treatment; muscle cooling was shown to reduce muscle stretch activity and clonus; 
Armutlu et al. Reported sig nificant  reduction in plantar flexor spasticity in 10 
patients with MS using high -frequency (100Hz) TENS for 20min daily for 4 weeks. 
Reduction noted on Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), electrophysiologic 
 
 Page 3 of 13   
measurements and the AI; and serial casting performed over a [ADDRESS_1032344] changes every 3 days demonstrated reduced spasticity levels1.  
  
 
 Back ground /Scientific Rationale and Significance  
 
The NeuFit company offers a NeuBie EMS product with a direct current using high 
fidelity audio equipment to decrease intensity of the treatment noxious stimulus and 
protect skin integrity from burns or intolera ble pain. This system uses an 
exponential wave pattern to mimic the natural pattern neurologically to lengthen 
fibers of the sarcomere and engage force velocity of muscle with minimized 
protective co -contraction of nearby [CONTACT_754273]9. The golgi tendon a nd muscle 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_754262]/tendon stretch with 66% of fibers being 
intrafusal .  Impacting these structures has direct impact on reticulospi[INVESTIGATOR_88735] 
(RST) fibers and proprioceptive central fibers modulation of levels of spasticit y. 
However , finding effective means to impact these areas is difficult.  The NeuBie 
direct current is designed to improve positioning of these stretch receptors.  As 
discussed within the paper hypothesis, the theory is that this  may improve spasticity 
levels as well as agonist strength enough to create long term, significant functional 
improvement.  
 
[CONTACT_754283] who has MS and has stud ied and marketed a protocol for MS 
treatment, promotes this product and has a home unit she uses daily to control her 
own MS symptoms  and gain strength .  Currently there is no research study 
conducted on the effects of  the NeuBie direct current treatment c ombined with  
exercise and ramifications of spasticity in multiple sclerosis.  There have been only a 
few studies conducted with quantitative spasticity measures mostly with FES and 
NMES targeting tibialis anterior and quadriceps to lessen plantar flexor spa sticity10 
in spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] (SCI) and hemiplegia. In the SCI study Mirbagheri et al. 
observed decreases in intrinsic and reflex dynamic stiffness in all [ADDRESS_1032345] current  
passive eccentric input. In order to assess the feasibility of this papers’ hypothesis 
we will perform a pi[INVESTIGATOR_754263] [ADDRESS_1032346]. Julie S eibert will screen all potential participants  for the following inclusion and

 Study Timelines  
• All participants will be referred  through [CONTACT_754285]. We will plan 
to start with only one participant for the first case study to ensure 
all steps completed as planned. Then the second case study is to 
begin as soon as the first one is completed an d on until up to [ADDRESS_1032350]. Ellerbusch will start with one 
participant at a time, then once all steps completed will be open to 
treating to 2 study subjects at a time.  
• Depending on timeline for IRB approval and Centura approval we 
hope to begin  this study in the Spring  of 202 1 and depending on 
 
 Page 7 of 13   
number of subjects and timeliness of finishing one case study and 
starting the next we’d hope to complete the study by [CONTACT_754277]

 Study Endpoints  
 
 The primary study endpoint of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_754269]. The listed subjective a nd objective data points are 
selected to capture this endpoint.  
 Procedures Involved  
 
Study methods:  
1. Treatment portion of study:  
2. The physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_754270]  3 times per week for 6 weeks.  
i) Use of Treatment table with manual activations to underactive, spastic or 
limited in sensory muscles/regions (The PT will consider primary and 
secondary activations to strengthen neural pathways maximally)  
ii) NeuBie Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_754271] e scanning process with electrode placed on 
thoracolumbar space and second sponge electrode scanning for:  
(1) Spots that stimulate movement they couldn’t do before per initial 
assessment  
(2) Spots that allow movement which is a greater range than available before 
per initial assessment  
(3) Spots that lead to decreased spasticity (turn up amplitude and have 
participant work through the threat response then repeat)  
(4) Diminished sensation areas – drive signal to increase sensory nerves and 
become metabolically active. Consi der knee, hip and ankle joints as these 
are neurologically rich.  
iii) Train using physical therapy exercises with Neubie in training mode and Hz 
current adjusted for tolerance, ability to work through or decrease spasticity in 
(500 Hz)  in the following areas (s pasticity, contraction, dead or diminished 
spots and hot spots) as tolerated but remove if participant is displaying signs 
of fatigue  
(1) Spasticity areas – 500Hz – adjust amplitude to 7/[ADDRESS_1032351] from PT as needed . The muscle that 
oppose the spasticity (a gonist ) will be considered for 40Hz current 
adjusted no higher than 7/10 discomfort with movement patterns out of the 
spasticity.  
(2) Contraction areas -500Hz  – adjust amplitude to 7/10 intensity and 
participant  works with contracting muscle without altered kinematics or 
co-contraction . The muscle that oppose the spasticity (a gonist ) will be 
considered for 40Hz current adjusted no higher than 7/10 discomfort with 
movement patterns out of the spasticity.  
 
 Page 8 of 13   
 
(3) Dead/dimi nished areas – establish a baseline amplitude for sensation and 
leave signal on at this amplitude. Over time assess if the amplitude for 
sensation is decreased demo return of sensation.  
(4) Hot spots – assess if the same amplitude over these areas which create s 
high level of discomfort becomes less uncomfortable over time as a sign 
of increased neurological resiliency.  
iv) Continue with electrodes in place and apply with functional training in high 
kneeling, sitting, transfers, standing static, standing dynamic cl osed chain, 
standing dynamic open chain, gait and movements available in LE/core  
v) Progress participant in sitting balance unsupported, sit to stand, standing 
balance static and dynamic and in gait  
vi) If participant tolerates less amp litude  signal next visit whil e working through 
spasticity or contraction, they are in neuro logical fatigue and consider master 
re-set, sensory inputs, stretches and more gentle approach for active recovery  
 
If participant  was not receiving this intervention , they would receive traditi onal 
physical therapy in stretching, therapeutic exercise training open chain and closed 
chain, transfer training, gait training and balance training working within limits 
ofparticipant’s  spasticity levels.  
 
Participants in this study will participate in the listed interventions for 6 
weeks. Outcome measures objective and subjective will be collected at the 
beginning and end of the study.

A.Purpose/Objectives 19 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the control system in reducing 20 
hypoglycemia by [CONTACT_23992], in a randomized study, 24 hour control with USS Virginia 21 
versus sensor augmented pump (SAP) therapy in subjects with type 1 diabetes and 22 
hypoglycemia unawareness and/ or risk for hypoglycemia. We will also evaluate the [ADDRESS_589579]-intervention inpatient assessments of hypoglycemia 26 
counterregulation and symptom awareness. Subjects randomized to USS Virginia will 27 
participate in two training visits at a monitored outpatient setting for the step-wise 28 
deployment of the cell phone based on the Artificial Pancreas (AP) system at home. The [ADDRESS_589580] training visit includes training on the study pump and AP system followed by 1 week 30 
use of AP system at home in Pump mode. The second training visit includes additional 31 
training on USS Virginia+AP system and confirmation of independent use by [CONTACT_423] 32 
followed by 4 week use of AP system at home in Closed Loop mode. Subjects 33 
randomized to sensor-augmented pump therapy will complete 5 weeks of CGM with the 34 
home pump. 35 
36 
This protocol will complement our recently completed protocol (IDE G130143) in which 37 
results demonstrate significantly improved glucose control overnight. Additionally, this 38 
protocol represents a culmination of prior clinical trials in the development of this USS 39 
Virginia system and benefits from the synthesis of those components.  40 
41 
The DiAs platform is now licensed to a local startup company, TypeZero Technologies LLC, 42 
which has further locked down its design features and re-implemented the system under the 43 
name [CONTACT_461178], for increased reliability and clear requirements traceability.  44 
45 
B.Study Design Overview 46 
This is a randomized, controlled trial of Unified Safety System (USS) Virginia closed-loop 47 
versus sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy for hypoglycemia prevention in subjects with 48 
type 1 diabetes and hypoglycemia unawareness and/or risk for hypoglycemia.  49 
Subjects: We will recruit up to [ADDRESS_589581] 6 months to achieve a goal of 44 completed subjects. 52 
Subjects will be recruited at two clinical sites: University of Virginia and Stanford 53 
University.  54 
Procedure:  Figure 1  below presents the overall flow of the study. 55

eligibility (i.e. Average Daily Risk Range [ADRR] >40 or LBGI >2.5 from SMBG data or 60 
LBGI >1.1 from 1 week of CGM data within the prior 3 weeks) and to determine pre-study 61 
CGM use in the prior 4 weeks (active [CGM use ≥5 days/week] or no CGM use). Baseline 62 
HbA1c, hypoglycemia symptom awareness (presence of adrenergic symptoms at BG 60 63 
mg/dL) and hypoglycemia questionnaires (Clarke Hypoglycemia Perception Awareness and 64 
Fear of Hypoglycemia – APPENDIX A-5) will be assessed. Those subjects that qualify will [ADDRESS_589582] 4 times daily. 67 
 68 
Visit 2 : Screening 2 Visit. The blinded CGM will be downloaded and if review of the data 69 
shows that the CGM was functional >80% of the time and the subject has confirmed risk of 70 
hypoglycemia with LBGI >1.1 (#2) (per 1 week of blinded CGM), the subject will be 71 
randomized to USS Virginia AP system experimental treatment or Sensor-Augmented Pump 72 
Therapy control treatment and proceed to Visit 3. The experimental and control groups will 73 
be matched for LBGI and pre-study CGM use. The study glucometer will be downloaded 74 
and assessed for average SMBG/day and randomness of data. Subjects with average SMBG 75 
<3.5/day and/or poor randomness of SMBG testing will be reminded of SMBG requirements 76 
4-6 times daily (pre-meal, bedtime, before driving, before exercise, and as indicated). CGM 77 
data collection period may be repeated.  78 
 79 
Visit 3:  8 hr Inpatient Assessment of Hypoglycemia Counterregulation and Symptom 80 
Awareness.  The subjects will undergo hypoglycemia induction via a previously validated 81 
method (1) using subcutaneous insulin pump therapy with frequently sampled YSI glucose 82 
levels. Hypoglycemia counterregulation and symptoms will be assessed by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_238] 83 
levels and hypoglycemia symptom scoring as the BG is decreased from 100-150 mg/dL to 84 
<60 mg/dL. Subjects will be trained on the Dexcom Share AP CGM and either proceed to 85 
Visit 4 if randomized to the experimental group or 5 weeks of CGM and home pump use if 86 
randomized to the control group. 87

 127 
Visit 6: 8 hr Inpatient Assessment of Hypoglycemia Counterregulation and Symptom 128 
Awareness.  Within approximately one week of completing either USS Virginia or sensor- 129 
augmented pump therapy at home, the subjects will undergo a final hypoglycemia induction 130 
using the home pump therapy with frequently sampled YSI glucose levels. Hypoglycemia 131 
counterregulation and symptoms will be assessed by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_461113] 132 
symptom scoring as the BG is decreased from 100-150 mg/dL to <60 mg/dL. Post- 133 
intervention HbA1c, and hypoglycemia questionnaires, and a DiAs Usability questionnaire 134 
(DiAs users only) will be completed. If a subject completes more than 1 week of either USS 135 
Virginia or sensor-augmented pump therapy and subsequently withdraws from the study 136 
intervention, they will be asked to complete Visit 6 within one week of discontinuing the 137 
intervention. 138

 195 
Forty-four subjects (N=44) with type 1 diabetes mellitus will be needed to complete the 196 
protocol.  197 
 198 
Based on our experience with similar studies and the additional requirement of 199 
hypoglycemia unawareness or risk for hypoglycemia, we estimate an expected ~40% screen 200 
failures, dropouts, or withdrawals, thus we intend to set a recruiting target of 70 subjects.  201 
 202 
Hypothesis:   203 
We hypothesize that in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and a risk for 204 
hypoglycemia, the AP system equipped with USS Virginia compared with CGM-augmented 205 
pump therapy will result in: 206 
1. Reduced risk for hypoglycemia and exposure to hypoglycemia (measured by [CONTACT_941] 207 
Low Blood Glucose Index and by [CONTACT_461159]).   208 
2. Restoration of hypoglycemia counterregulation (as assessed by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_238] 209 
response measured in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]), restoration of hypoglycemia awareness, 210 
and reduced fear of hypoglycemia. 211

in terms of restoration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_461124] ~0.35. Power calculations 243 
assuming =0.05, and power of 80% yield a required sample size of N=36 (using G*Power 244 
3 software [#5 ]). With this sample size, the power for finding significant effects on 245 
frequency and extent of hypoglycemia (Low BG Index [#6]) exceeds 0.9. Assuming a 246 
proportion of noncompliance R=20% for Intention- to-Treat (ITT) analysis (#7), 44 247 
completed subjects will adequately address the specific aims of this study. Per-protocol 248 
analysis will also be performed. In order to achieve 44 completed subjects, up to 70 subjects 249

H. SAFETY MONITORI NG / RISK ANALYSIS 1414  
 Glucose Monitoring Risk:  [ADDRESS_589738] accurate method available during the 1418  
Hypoglycemia Induction procedures. 1419  
 1420  
During outpatient procedures the Accu-Chek Aviva glucometer will be used. It is 1421  
an FDA approved 510K Class II Medical Device (510K number K101299). 1422  
Subjects and diabetes care partners will be trained on the use of the glucometer. 1423  
 1424  
 H yp oglyce mic/Hyp ergly cemic and Ketone Risk:  1425  
 1426  
To decrease the risk of severe hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, the following 1427  
schedule for monitoring blood glucose concentrations during the inpatient 1428  
procedures will be adhered to  1429  
 O nce IV access has been established, blood will be sampled for YSI glucose 1430  
every 5-30 minutes. The frequency of blood draws for YSI sampling is 1431  
dependent on the value of the previous sample, according to the following 1432  
ranges: 1433  
o B G >200: every 30 minutes 1434  
o B G >100-200: every 15 minutes 1435  
o B G ≤100  mg/dL:  every 5 minut es 1436  
 B lood may be sampled for YSI glucose as needed for patient safety or to 1437  
recheck a suspected erroneous value (e.g. dilute sample). 1438  
 In the  event of loss of IV access or loss of a functional YSI and need for [ADDRESS_589739] monitoring, glucose measurements will be made on 1440  
capi[INVESTIGATOR_461136].  1441  
 1442  
The Inpatient Hypoglycemia Treatment and Inpatient Hyperglycemia and Ketone 1443  
Treatment instructions (below) will be followed during the inpatient portions of 1444  
the study at Visit 3 and Visit 6. 1445  
 1446  
Inpatient Hypoglycemia Treatment 1447  
 G lucose <60 mg/dL will be treated orally with fast acting carbohydrate as 1448  
needed until a glucose level of ≥80 mg/dL is achieved.  1449  
 In the  event that there is intravenous access and the subject is at risk for [ADDRESS_589740] will be treated with a ~2-3 mL/kg D10 1451  
intravenous glucose bolus. Risk for severe hypoglycemia is defined as any of 1452  
the following situations: 1453  
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 38 
   
 
o G lucose <50 mg/dL [ADDRESS_589741] experiences symptoms of neuroglycopenia (e.g. lethargy, 1459  
disorientation, confusion [disordered processing of information or 1460  
communication], or inappropriate behavior)  [ADDRESS_589742] experiences symptoms of severe hypoglycemia (i.e. 1462  
hypoglycemic seizure or loss of consciousness)  1463  
 In the  event that there is NO intravenous access and the subject is at risk for 1464  
severe hypoglycemia (as defined above), the subject will be treated with 1 mg 1465  
of glucagon subcutaneously or intramuscularly.  1466  
o T he drug will be reconstituted and administered per package 1467  
insert/instructions.  1468  
o G lucagon may be repeated as needed every 20 minutes to achieve 1469  
glucose level ≥80 mg/dL. Once the subject is able to consume oral [ADDRESS_589743] acting 1471  
carbohydrate as needed until a glucose level of ≥80 mg/dL is 1472  
achieved. Orange juice and milk will be avoided after glucagon 1473  
administration.  1474  
o A ttempts will be made to reestablish intravenous access.  1475  
 T he Hypoglycemia Induction Admission will be stopped if the subject [ADDRESS_589744]’s glucose between 100-300 mg/dL and determine the appropriate [ADDRESS_589745] disposition (i.e. home or medical facility).  1481  
 1482  
Inpatient Hyperglycemia and Ketone Treatment 1483  
 If  the subject’s glucose is >300 mg/dL or β–hydroxybutyrate level is ≥0.6 1484  
mmol/L on admission, the subject will be stabilized per the procedures [ADDRESS_589746] will continue to be monitored until a glucose level 1486  
between 100-300 mg/dL and β–hydroxybutyrate measurement <0.6 mmol/L 1487  
has been achieved (or the subject is discharged to an appropriate medical 1488  
team).  1489  
 S ubsequently, glucose >300 mg/dL fo r > 2 hours or glucose ≥400 mg/dL at 1490  
any time will prompt discontinuation of the Hypoglycemia Induction 1491  
Admission. 1492  
 β –hydroxybutyrate will be assessed hourly while the glucose is ≥250 mg/dl 1493  
IDE CLINICAL PROTOCOL 
Version Date: 09/16/16  Page 39 
   
 
or the β–hydroxybutyrate level is ≥0.6 mmol/L.  1494  
 If  the glucose is >300 mg/dL and β–hydroxybutyrate level is <0.6 mmol/L, [ADDRESS_589747] will be asked to 1497  
bolus with his/her pump an amount of corrective insulin that will bring 1498  
him/her to a target glucose of 120 mg/dL. 1499  
 If  the β–hydroxybutyrate level is ≥0.6 mmol/L, the cause of the elevated 1500  
ketone level will be investigated (e.g. pump or pump site malfunction). [ADDRESS_589748]’s insulin sensitivity factor and a target glucose of 120 mg/dL.   1504  
 If  the β–hydroxybutyrate level is ≥1.5 mmol/L, the Hypoglycemia Induction [ADDRESS_589749]'s insulin dosing. The cause of the elevated ketone level will be 1507  
investigated (e.g. pump or pump site malfunction). If the subject's home 1508  
parameters are not felt to be working adequately due to hyperglycemia, 1509  
ketonemia, or other factors (e.g. intercurrent illness), the study MD or NP 1510  
will administer corrective insulin either via insulin syringe or via a new pump 1511  
site using an ISF determined to be appropriate for the setting and a goal 1512  
glucose of 120 mg/dL. The subject will continue to be monitored until a 1513  
glucose level between 100-300 mg/dL and β–hydroxybutyrate measurement 1514  
<0.6 mmol/L has been achieved (or the subject is discharged to an 1515

monitored outpatient setting for the step-wise deployment of the AP system at home in Pump 1953  
mode followed by 4 weeks using AP at home in Closed Loop mode running USS Virginia . 1954  
Subjects randomized to sensor-augmented pump therapy will complete 5 weeks of CGM 1955

L. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN 1993  
Sample size determination is based on literature data (#3) and on results from our 1994  
previous studies of hypoglycemia unawareness (#4)(#5). We estimate, conservatively, [ADDRESS_589793] size of using the AP system+USS Virginia vs. CGM in terms of 1996  
restoration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_461124] ~0.35. Power calculations assuming 1997  
=0.05, and power of 80% yield a required sample size of N=36 (using G*Power 3 1998  
software [#5]). With this sample size, the power for finding significant effects on 1999  
frequency and extent of hypoglycemia (Low BG Index [#6]) exceeds 0.9. Assuming a 2000  
proportion of noncompliance R=20% for Intention- to-Treat (ITT) analysis (#7), 44 2001  
completed subjects will adequately address the specific aims of this study. Per-protocol 2002  
analysis will also be performed. In order to achieve 44 completed subjects, up to 70 2003

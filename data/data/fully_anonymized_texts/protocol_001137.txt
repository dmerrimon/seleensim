PURPOSE  
The goal of this study  is to evaluate the effects of varenicline versus nicotine replacement versus 
placebo on personal smoking environment (PSE) cue reactivity. In a lab -based model of smoking 
lapse/relapse, we will assess  craving, latency to first cigarette and smoke intake in response to viewing 
PSEs .  The results of this study will inform whether first -line pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_533500] (e.g. nicotine patch, varenicline) alter  reactivity to environment cues. This study  will also 
provide evidence that the efficacy of these treatm ents is due, in part, to effects on environment 
reactivity or will suggest a need for adjunctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_533501].  
  
BACKGROUND  
Encountering an environment in which  smoking has regularly occurred and/or its effects experienced, 
triggers strong craving and may promote lapse  or relapse in smokers who have quit. Clinicians and 
recovery programs have long recognized the powerful  influence of drug -environment associations and 
counsel patients to avoid “people, places, and  things”  associated with prior use. Confirming these 
intuitions, real -world assessment (i.e. ecological momentary  assessment) of smoking suggests that 
relapse most often occurs in environments previously associated with  smoking and that abstaining in 
conte xts associated with smoking decreases the probability of later lapse . 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_533502] a determinant of drug use and relapse, and 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a large and growing preclinical literature, surprisingly little empi[INVESTIGATOR_533503] h as specifically 
addressed questions around drug -environment associations in humans. Laboratory -based studies have 
demonstrated that environments previously unassociated with smoking, when paired with or made 
predictive of smoking, can elicit urges to smoke . More recently, preference for a room paired with a low 
dose of amphetamine has been demonstrated in amphetamine -naïve subjects and has been suggested 
as a human analog of conditioned place preference (CPP ). Collectively, this and other cue -conditioning 
research in humans provides insight into the formation of drug -environment associations but leave 
open questions regarding the influence of real-world environments on subjective experience, behavior 
and brain function among individuals with long drug use hi stories.  
  
DESIGN AND PROCEDURES  
We propose to obtain consent from a total of 400 participants in order to identify 120 who meet all 
inclusion and exclusion criteria  and complete all aspects of the study . During a phone screening 
interview, the study will be described in detail and preliminary participant characteristics (e.g. age, 
number of cigarettes per day) will be assessed. Participants will be made aware of all exclusion criteria.  
Those participants who meet criteria for participation will be invited  to our offices for an informed 
consent and screening visit.   
 
Version Date:  6/12/201 7  Page | 3   
Screening session.   During screening, all aspects of the study will be described to subjects and 
informed consent will be acquired. Breath and saliva sample s will be collected in order to verify 
smoking status  and blood alcohol level (BAL ); and measures including , but not limited to , smoking 
history, nicotine dependence, and mood will be collected.  Vitals such as  heart rate, blood pressure and 
weight/height will also be measured.  Urine samples will be obtained in order to screen for illicit drug 
use. Use of illegal drugs  will be exclusion criteria , except for marijuana . A blood sample will be obtained 
in order to assess pregnancy status and blood chemistry as part of the medical evaluation. The  medical 
evaluation will be conducted by [CONTACT_533514], physical exam, and 
electrocardiogram (ECG).  Participants will also be interview ed regarding their smoking behavior 
including an assessment of contexts (places) in which they smoke and abstain from smoking cigarettes.  
At the end of the screening session , if participants qualify to continue in the study (excluding review of 
lab work)  they will complete [ADDRESS_692925] eye 
tracking data using an eyetracker.

Training session. Participants will be introduced to the digital camera  they w ill use to capture images 
of their personal environments . All information regarding the rec ording of events, the taking of pi[INVESTIGATOR_533506] (e.g. recharging, storage) will be reviewed  with the participant . Any 
questions from participants regarding the use of the camera will be discussed.  Participants will also be 
allowed to take photos with their own personal devices and email them to the study staff.  If participants 
choose to take photos with device (s) other than the camera provided, the device (s) must have a photo 
resolution of at least [ADDRESS_692928] smoking behavior, 
tobacco purchasing information,  and study drug adherence . Participants will be compensated $2 for 
completing the survey by [CONTACT_533515] (up to $ 196).  
 
Camera Turn -in session . Once participants have collecte d at least 32 photographs of personal neutral 
and smoking environments , participants will return to the lab with the  camera . The images  from the 
 
Version Date:  6/12/201 7  Page | 5  camera will be u ploaded , examined , and reviewed with each participant  to ensure enough useable 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_127321] . Participants will be instructed to review and remove any pi[INVESTIGATOR_533507]. After uploading the pi[INVESTIGATOR_499] , if the study staff discover any pi[INVESTIGATOR_533508] e images will be permanently deleted.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_533509] . A 
participant’s pi[INVESTIGATOR_127336], such as a home, will not be shown t o any other research 
participants in this or any other study. Any pi[INVESTIGATOR_127337] (bus stop, restaurant, etc.) may be 
used and shown to participants in future studies.  
 
Randomization  and Medication .  Smokers will be randomized  (stratified accordi ng to gender and 
smoking frequency)  to one of three study drug combinations : placebo  patch and capsule  (PLAC; 
n=40), transdermal nicotine patch /placebo capsule  (NRT ; n=40) or varenicline /placebo patch  (VAR; 
n=40) in  a double blind, double -dummy design.  The ratio of participants assig ned to each group will be 
1:1:1. Once participants have been  randomized they will receive an 8  day supply of study drugs and 
instructions for use. Participants will undergo a 7 day induction phase where those in the VAR grou p 
and NRT group will be titrated up to a full dose of study drug (see description below) and then all 
participants will continue on their study drug for 7 more days while they complete two cue reactivity  
sessions. Following completion of the cue reactivity  sessions, all participants will make a quit attempt. 
Participants in the VAR and NRT groups will continue to receive study drug as usual for the remaining 
10 weeks  of the study . Participants in the PLAC group will switch to wearing a nicotine patch  (21mg if 
≥10 cigarettes/day, 14mg if <10 cigarettes/day)  the morning of their quit day in order to provide them 
with the minimum standard of care.  Figure 1 describes  the study drug  schedule for dispensing patches 
and capsules. Participants wil l be given an extra  3 day supply  of capsules and patches at each visit.  
 
 
Version Date:  6/12/201 7  Page | 6   
 
Varenicline and placebo varenicline capsule s will be ob tained from Central Compounding Center  where 
it will be randomized and blinded. Central Compounding will provide a kit for each participant and it will 
be pi[INVESTIGATOR_140467] a member of the study team. Each kit will contain capsules (prepared in vials) and 
patches (repackaged in material for light sensitive products) for all visits for one participant. The 
medication for each visit will be separated and  labeled by [CONTACT_533516]. Varenicline (VAR) will be 
administered by [CONTACT_533517] a 7 day induction period (.5 mg onc e daily in Days 
1-3; .5 mg twice daily on Days 4-7 and 1 mg twice daily on Days 8-14). Participants will continue on 
1mg twice daily until the end of treatment  (days 15 -84). The main side effects accompanying use of 
varenicline (“Chantix”) are nausea, vomiting, gas, insomnia, and vivid dreams. If troublesome 
symptoms occur, the dose may be reduced to 1 mg dai ly (discontinuing the second dose) or 
discontinued altogether. Rarely, more serious side effects can occur including changes in behavior, 
hostility, agitation, depressed mood, suicidal thoughts and behavior, and attempted suicide. 
Participants will be aske d about these symptoms at each visit and the study physician will be called in 
to evaluate the participant if any are endorsed. At randomization, participants will be given the 
“Medication Guide” that accompanies prescription Chantix. This information will  be reviewed with the 
participant by [CONTACT_533518]. As is standard in our protocols, all participants will have access to the PI’s cell 
phone number and the study physician’s pager number.

Version Date:  6/12/201 7  Page | 7  Nicotine patches ( Nicoderm CQ® ) will also be obtained from Central Compounding Center.  Participants 
will wear 21mg/day patches for days 1 -14. After day 14, participants will continue to wear the 21mg/d 
patches for 6 weeks,  then step down to 14mg/d patches for 2 weeks and finally step down 7mg/d for 
the last 2 weeks  of study protocol . If the participant smokes less than 10 cigarettes/day, we will start 
them on  14mg /day patches  for days 1 -14. After day 14 they will continue on 14mg/day patches for 6

minimized by [CONTACT_127344]. Using 1% hydrocortisone cream on the 
affected area will be recommended to help reduce skin irritation. If a subject develops itching or a rash 
at the patch site, he or she will be advised to use 1% hydrocortisone cream on the affected area. 
Symptoms associated with nicotine toxicity inclu de lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, fainting and 
vomiting. Symptoms considered moderate to severe in nature will be evaluated by [CONTACT_533519], depending upon the level of severity. Upon evaluation, the subject will 
then be given the choice of continuing in the study while discontinuing patch use.  Placebo nicotine 
patches will be obtained from Chemsultants International. Participants assigned to the placebo patch 
condition will also be instructed to wear one patch each  day, applying new patches in the morning.  
Placebo patches will be shipped directly to Central Compounding Center where a ll patches will be 
repackaged before being given to participants so that all patch materials are identical.  
 
Cue-Reactivity  sessions. In the week following the study drug  induction phase there will be [ADDRESS_692930] 8 days (+ 2 day window) after the randomization visit. Both [ADDRESS_692931] be  less than  60% of the 
highest CO measurement obtained from either the screening session or training session.  Subjective 
and behavioral responses will be assessed in two separate laboratory sessions —one involving 
reactivity  to personal sm oking environment cues; the other reactivity  to personal nonsmoking 
environment cues (order randomly assigned and counterbalanced). Following CO assessment, 
participants will be seated in front of a computer monitor. Participants will be video recorded  using a 
handheld recorder  during the session to gather data about their smoking behavior. They will be 
instructed that throughout the session pi[INVESTIGATOR_533511] t hem. The cue-reactivity ( CR) sessions will be computer 
automated: participants will 1) complete on -screen assessments of craving and mood 2) view personal 
smoking or nonsmoking environment cues, and 3) complete assessments a 2nd time. Following 
completion of the 2nd assessment, participants will be instructed to watch the slides and concentrate 
on their content, followed immediately by a screen stating  that “At any time  from this point on , you may 
smoke as much as you like until the end of the session. You do not have to smoke if you choose not 
to.” The environment cues will then be presented for the next [ADDRESS_692932] the option of wearing a physiological sensor for one week following  
the cue -reactivity  2 session. Metria IH1 is a disposable, wearable device that is applied directly to the 
skin of the left upper arm and enables the collectio n of up to seven days of physiological data. The 
Metria IH1 has 4 sensors: 1) 3 -axis accelerometer 2) Skin Temperature 3) Near Body Temperature and 
4) Galvanic Skin Response. The device will be applied to the participant by a member of the study staff 
in order to ensure proper placement and use. Participants can shower and exercise with the device but 
cannot submerse the device in water. After seven days of continuous use, data will then be uploaded to

asked to reschedule .  Participants  testing positive for alcohol on more than one occasion will be 
excluded from the study . 
 
 
Lab Visits: Four lab visits will be conducted durin g the [ADDRESS_692934] quit day.  These visits will be largely identical 
except that instructions and reminders to participants about upcoming events will vary from sessio n to 
session. At each lab visit the following will be collected: vitals (heart rate, blood pressure and weight); 
breath CO and saliva samples for characterizing smoking/nicotine consumption; and measures of 
smoking withdrawal and mood.  Depending on group a nd session, participants will also be provided with 
patches  and medications and instructions for using them. Advice on quitting and minimal support will be 
provided as requested at these visits. Each lab visit will require 20 -30 minutes of participant time.  
6 month Follow -Up phone call .  Participants will be conta cted by [CONTACT_648] 6 months after completing the 
study to complete a brief interview about current smoking status and nicotine dependence.  
DATA ANALYSIS  
 
Reactivity variables (craving, latency to smoke, and smoke intake) will be entered into 3 ( Study drug : 
NRT,  VAR, PLAC) x 2 (Environment: smoking, nonsmoking) x 2(Time ) repeated measures ANOVAs 
with random -effects.  We hypothesize that personal smoking, as compared to nonsmoking 
environments, will be associated with greater reactivity (i.e. increased craving and smoke intake; 
decreased latency to smoke). A Medication x Environment X Time  interaction will be characterized by 
[CONTACT_533520].  
 
RISK/ BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
 
Blood drawing:  Momentary discomfort and/or bruising can occur; infection, excess bleeding, clotting or 
fainting are possible although unlikely.  
 
Needle stick:  There will be mild, momentary pain associated with the needle stick for the needle 
placement.  There is a minimal risk of bruising, bleeding and mild discomfort associated with the needle 
stick. A small risk of infection at the site of the needle stick can also occur.  The use of clean techniques 
should keep this risk low.  
 
Concomitant smo king and NRT . The currently approved package insert for Nicoderm CQ no longer 
warns against concurrent use of the patches and cigarette smoking. Thus, we do not believe there are 
additional health risks associated with the concurrent use of these products above smoking cigarettes 
alone.  
 
Nicotine Patch.  Insomnia and abnormal dreams are common and expected side effects associated with  
 
Version Date:  6/12/201 7  Page | [ADDRESS_692935] complains of disturbed sleep, he or she will be instructed to  
remove the patch at bedt ime and apply a new one the next day at the usual time. Skin irritation may  
occur, although this will be minimized by [CONTACT_127344]. Using 1%  
hydrocortisone cream on the affected area will be recommended to help reduce skin i rritation. If a  
subject develops itching or a rash at the patch site, he or she will be advised to use 1% hydrocortisone  
cream on the affected area. Symptoms associated with nicotine toxicity include, lightheadedness,  
dizziness, nausea, fainting and vomiti ng. Symptoms considered moderate to severe in nature will be  
evaluated by [CONTACT_533521], depending upon the level of severity.  
Upon evaluation, the subject will then be given the choice of continuing in the study while discontinuing  
patch use.  
 
Varenicline.  The main side effects accompanying use of varenicline (Chantix) are nausea, vomiting,  
gas, insomnia, and vivid dreams. If troublesome symptoms occur, the dose may be reduced to 1 mg  
daily (discontinuing the second do se) or discontinued altogether. Rarely, more serious side effects can  
occur including changes in behavior, hostility, agitation, depressed mood, suicidal thoughts and  
behavior, and attempted suicide. Participants will be asked about these symptoms at each visit and the  
study physician will be called in to evaluate the participant if any are endorsed. Until patients know how 
Chantix affects their ability to tolerate alcohol, they should decrease the amount of alcohol they drink. 
Patients who have a seizure w hile taking Chantix should stop the medicine and seek medical attention 
immediately. At randomization,  participants will be given the “Medication Guide” that accompanies 
prescription Chantix. This  information will be reviewed with the participant by [CONTACT_533522]. As is 
standard in our protocols, all  participants will have access to the PI’s cell phone number and the study 
physician’s pager number.  
 
Women of c hildbearing potential:  Pregnant or nursing women will be excluded from the study.  Female 
participants will undergo a serum  pregnancy test at screening. Subjects must also agree to use 
appropriate contraception during the course of the trial.  They will be  encouraged in the consent form to 
notify study staff if they believe a change in their pregnancy status has occurred during the trial.  
 
Management of side effects:  Reports of side effects will be obtained by [CONTACT_533523] , who will determine the most appropriate course of 
action, which may include options for termination of study participation. Participants will be reminded of 
their option to withdraw from the study at any time.  If a partici pant decides to withdraw from the study, 
we will ask them to return for a final visit to return all study materials.  Because all subjects will receive 
either placebo patches or placebo tablets/capsules, in  the event of significant side effects it will be 
necessary to reduce both patch and oral dosing  concomitantly in order to preserve the double blind 
while ensuring a dose reduction in the active  treatment. In response to complaints of insomnia, 
instructions will be given to remove skin patches at  bedtime a nd discontinue the second daily dose of 
oral medication. In the event of other intolerable side  effects, both patch and oral medications will be 
discontinued completely  
PARTICIPANT RECRUITMENT AND  COMPENSATION  
 
We will advertise in local newspapers, the radio, flyers on bulletin boards and on the internet ( including 
but not limited to trianglesmokingstudies .com and craigslist). When we receive calls from potential 
subjects we will return their call and ask information including name, address, age, and smoking 
history . Potential subjects may also  complete an on -line Qualtrics screening survey accessed from our 
website. They will be given a brief description of our studies and will be asked questions to determine 
interest and eligibility. If they do qual ify we will schedule a screening session where we will follow all 
IRB protocols of informed consent.

2. BACKGROUND/INTRODUCTION 
As defined by [CONTACT_824697] (TFOS) International Workshop 
on meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) involving more than 50 clinical and research 
experts, “Meibomian gland dysfunction is a chronic, diffuse abnormality of the 
meibomian glands, commonly characterized by [CONTACT_858731]/or qualitative/quantitative changes in the glandular secretion.  It may result in alteration of the tear film, symptoms of eye irritation, clinically apparent inflammation, and ocular 
surface disease .”

surface staining for all the subjects, and optional  meibomian gland assessment  at 
the investigator’s discretion.  
4) Complete a  bilateral Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_887341] -[ADDRESS_1241972] the treatment reports automatically generated by [CONTACT_887404][INVESTIGATOR_887372]. 
5) Perform a post -treatment slit lamp evaluation and ocular surface staining.  
6) Questionnaire: The Investigator  or designee will complete a questionnaire 
regarding the clinical use of the Activator LFD-2100 (Appendix A ). 
10.3 PROCEDURES  
The procedures in the Pre-treatment v isit include Informed Consent, Screening & 
Enrollment,  and Pre- treatment slit lamp evaluation, non- dilated fundus exam, ocular 
surface staining, and optional meibomian gland assessment  (at the investigator’s 
discretion) .  The procedures in the Treatment Visit include Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_887373] , post-
treatment slit lamp evaluation, ocular surface staining, and completion of the 
Questionnaire.  These procedures must be done in the order shown as below.  
Informed Consent  
The Investigator or designee identifies potential study participants by [CONTACT_887405] .  Potential study participants are scheduled for the study visit.  
At the visit, the Investigator or designee conducts the informed consent discussion and explains the study purpose, procedures, benefits, risks, discomforts, precautions and 
subject responsibilities to the potential study participant.   The Investigator may provide 
written delegation of authority to a trained and qualified study staff member (e.g ., study 
coordinator, technician) to conduct the consent discussion; however, the Investigator 
should be available to answer the potential participant’s questions, as needed.  
Once the Investigator or designee has answered all the potential participant’s questions 
to his/her  satisfaction and the potential study participant has voluntarily agreed to 
participate in the study, written informed consent is obtained using the IRB/IEC -
approved informed consent document.  The subject and the person conducting the consent discussion (Investigator or designee) print their names, sign and date the 
consent.  If the subject is unable to read, the consent document can be read to the subject in front of an impartial witness, who also prints his/her name, signs and dates the consent.

Version 3.0  / Aug/31/2020                                                      12                                                    PR/DRYE -105-ACTS  All subjects enrolled in the study must sign the current IRB/IEC -approved informed 
consent document.  The informed consent must  be signed before any study -specific 
examinations are performed, and this must be documented in the source documents .  
An authorization for use/disclosure of health information form (HIPAA authorization)  or 
similar medical measurement privacy law documentation must also be signed.   
The Investigator maintains the signed informed consent document and the signed 
authorization form as a permanent part of the subject’s medical records and provides a 
signed copy of the consent to the subject.  The Investigator or designee documents in 
the medical records that informed consent was obtained prior to any study -specific 
procedures and a copy of the signed consent was given to the subject.  
As the Informed Consent Form is signed prior to any study -specific procedures, some 
subjects may not qualify after study -specific testing is performed.  Subjects will be 
considered screen -failures i f they do not qualify or if they qualify but decide not to 
proceed with study treatment .  These subjects will be exited from the study.   
Screening & Enrollment  
Following the informed consent process, the Investigator or designee will perform the screening exam procedures and evaluate the subject conditions that affect study eligibility, as listed in Sections 8.  The screening exam may be ended prior to 
completion if the Investigator or designee determines that the subject does not meet one 
or more of the eligibility criteria.  The subject must meet all the study inclusion / 
exclusion criteria based on testing and medical history discussion conducted at the visit.  
The screening exam to be performed for each eye includes:  
MEDICAL AND OCULAR HISTORY  
To determine the presence of any systemic or ophthalmic factors that may affect the subject’s eligibility based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria in Sections 8, the 
Investigator or designee obtain the subject’s medical and ophthalmic history at the visit, including assessment of:   
1) demographic information (age, gender, race/ethnicity);  
2) ophthalmic conditions and medications;  
3) history of ocular surgery, ocular injury, ocular infection, ocular inflammation, ocular allergy, eyelid abnormality, or ocular surface abnormality;  
4) pregnant and breastfeeding conditions, if applicable;  
5) recent participation in another ophthalmic clinical trial;  
6) employment or relationship with any employee at the clinical study site.  
BIOMICROSCOPIC SLIT -LAMP EXAM   
A biomicroscopic slit -lamp exam must be performed at the study visit to determine if the 
subject meets inclusion/exclusion criteria  (see Appendix D ).  The Investigator or 
designee evaluates the eyelids, palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea, anterior

everts the upper eyelid to evaluate the upper palpebral conjunctiva. The Investigator or designee assesses the findings for the presence of any medical findings . 
NON-DILATED FUNDUS EXAM     
A non-dilated fundus exam shall be performed at the study visit to determine the status 
of the ocular media, retina and lens  and to determine if the subject meets 
inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
Potential participants who are approached with the informed consent document will be 
documented on the Subject Accountability  Log.  A subject who does not meet the 
eligibility criteria or who chooses to discontinue study  participation  at any time  is 
documented on the Subject Accountability  Log as a Screen Failure or Exited Subject 
along with the reason. All subjects who sign the informed consent document  are 
assigned a subject identifier.  
MEIBOMIAN GLAND ASSESSMENT ( OPTIONAL ) 
The MGD diagnosis can be based on prior medical records, investigator opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] , or in 
conjunction with an assessment of meibomian glands of the lower eyelid ( see Appendix 
E).  The need for the meibomian gland assessment is at the investigator’s discretion.  
If the Investigator or designee decides to conduct the meibomian gland assessment  to 
evaluate the function of the meibomian glands, the Investigator or designee can assess 
the color and consistency of the secretion characteristics from the gland orifices along 
the lower eyelid in each eye.  The Investigator or designee evaluates the glands using a 
slit-lamp biomicroscope and a handheld instrument, Meibomian Gland Evaluator (MGE) 
(as s hown in Appendix E), to apply gentle pressure along the eyelid margin, which 
simulates a forceful blink in yielding secretions from the glands. This instrument provides a standardized method to apply the same amount of pressure at each visit and for each subject to ensure measurement consistency.  This Class I, 510(k) -exempt device is 
commercially available, and is being used in this study in accordance with the indications in the commercial product labeling.  
There are approximately 20 to 30 meibomian glands along the lower eyelid.  The Investigator or designee assesses and grades glands located temporally, centrally and 
nasally.  The central region of the Meibomian Gland Evaluator should be carefully placed 
in the temporal, central and nasal regions as described in Appendix E to avoid overlap 
in the gland assessment.  
OCULAR SURFACE STAINING  
Ocular surface staining of the cornea and conjunctiva shall be  evaluated.   The 
Investigator or designee assesses the corneal staining after instillation of fluorescein dy e

Capture (EDC) system .  Any deviation made to protect the life or physical wellbeing of a 
subject in an emergency as well as any use of the investigational device without 
obtaining informed consent must be reported to JJSV within 5 working days.   Protocol 
deviations will be monitored by [CONTACT_32496], and if the non- compliance is persistent or 
egregious, JJSV may take action, including but not limited to termination of the 
investigator’s participation in the study.  The investigator is also responsible for informing 
the reviewing IRB of instances of protocol non- compliance in accordance wi th the IRB 
requirements.  
11. ADVERSE EVENTS AND PRODUCT COMPLAINTS  
11.1 DEFINITIONS  
Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is defined (following ISO [ZIP_CODE]) as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory 
findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the study  device.   
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An adverse event is considered serious (following ISO [ZIP_CODE]) if it is an untoward 
occurrence which may or may not be related to use of the study device that  
• is sight - or life -threatening,  
• results in death,  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] (a planned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre- existing condition without a serious deterioration in health is 
not considered a serious adverse event),  
• results in permanent impairment of a body structure or body function,  
• necessitates medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to a body structure or function, or  
• results in fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
Device-Related Adverse Event/Adverse Device Effect (ADE)  
A device -related adverse event is defined as any adverse even that is believed to be 
definitely, probably or possibly related to the study device.  A device- related event is also 
considered an adverse device effect (ADE; following ISO [ZIP_CODE]) resulting from the use of the study device that may result from user error, insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, operation of any malfunction of the device.

The study specific anticipated AEs are listed below and will be classified as AE or SAE 
dependent upon its occurrence and severity during the course of the study : 
• Eyelid/eye pain requiring discontinuation of the treatment procedure;  
• Eyelid irritation or inflammation (e.g. edema, bruising, blood blister, dermatitis, 
hordeolum or chalazion);  
• Ocular surface irritation or inflammation (e.g. corneal abrasion, conjunctival edema or conjunctival injection/hyperemia); and 
• Ocular symptoms (e.g. burning, stinging, tearing, itching, discharge, redness, foreign body sensation, visual disturbance, sensitivity to light).  
Study-Specific Serious Anticipated Adverse Events  
There is no anticipated study -specific serious adverse event  for this study.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (U ADE)/Unanticipated Serious Adverse 
Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE)  
Any UADE ([LOCATION_003] 21CFR 812.3(s)) or [LOCATION_003]DE (ISO [ZIP_CODE]) is defined as any serious 
adverse effect on health or safety or any life- threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in 
nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan (i.e., this protocol), application (including a supplementary plan or application), or risk assessment, or any 
other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, 
safety, or welfare of subjects.   
11.[ADDRESS_1241982] COMPLAINT/DEVICE DEFICIENCY DEFINITION 
A product complaint/device deficiency is defined (21 CFR 820.3(b) and ISO [ZIP_CODE]) as 
any alleged deficiency related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, 
effectiveness, or performance of a device. This may include malfunctions, use error and inadequacies in labeling.  Product complaints can pertain to any marketed JJSV device being used in the study.  The investigator is to assess whether the deficiency could have led to a serious adverse event without suitable action or intervention or under less 
fortunate circumstances.  
11.[ADDRESS_1241983], regardless 
of severity and whether or not attributed to the study device(s), are to be reported to JJSV and recorded on the case report form corresponding to the visit during which 
awareness of the event occurred.  Adverse events are also to be reported to the 
reviewing IRB/IEC as per the IRB/IEC’s reporting requirements.  If required, adverse

Version 3.0  / Aug/31/2020                                                      19                                                    PR/DRYE -105-ACTS  events will be reported to the appropriate regulatory agencies according to all applicable 
laws and regulations.   
Reporting of adverse events shall follow the applicable Regulations.  General guidelines are provided below:  
Adverse Event Reporting  
An adverse event that is not serious or device- related is to be reported to JJSV in a 
timely manner.  Notification of non- serious and non- device related adverse events will 
occur by [CONTACT_32500].  Such adverse events are also to be reported to the reviewing IRB/IEC per their reporting requirements.  
Complaints/Device Deficiency Reporting  
A general product complaint or device deficiency is to be reported to JJSV in a timely 
manner.  Notification of complaints/device deficiencies will occur by [CONTACT_277540] (e.g. operative form) or by a phone call to the Sponsor.  Any device deficiency that could have led to a serious adverse 
event without suitable action or intervention, or under less fortunate circumstances, must 
be reported to the sponsor immediately (no later than 24 hours after detection). Device 
deficiencies that could have led to a serious adverse event should also be reported to 
the investigator’s IRB/IEC per their reporting requirements.  
Serious and/or Device -Related Adverse Event Reporting  
Serious and/or device related events (ADEs) are to be documented using the Serious 
Adverse Event/Adverse Device Effect (SAE/ADE) CRF.  In the event of a serious 
adverse event (SAE), which may or may not be related to use of the study device, JJSV 
must be notified immediately (no later than 24 hours after detection).   Any SAE is to be 
reported by [CONTACT_648] (and/or email) and by [CONTACT_277541]/ADE CRF.  Any 
SAE o r device -related AE should also be reported to the investigator’s IRB/IEC per their 
reporting requirements.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)/Unanticipated Serious Adverse 
Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE) Reporting  
If during the study, a serious adverse event occurs that may reasonably be regarded as device- related and was not previously expected in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence, the investigator is to report the UADE/[LOCATION_003]DE to JJSV within 24 hours , and to 
the investigator’s IRB/IEC as soon as possible (and no later than 10 working days after 
learning of the event for sites in the [LOCATION_003] as required by 21CFR812).  
11.4 CA[LOCATION_003]L RELATIONSHIP  
The investigator should always be alert to adverse events that may be related to the study device or the use of the study device (i.e., the procedure specific to the initial application of the device).  An attempt should be made in every case to determine the 
causality of the event.  The following definitions are to be used as guidelines in determining the relationship between the event and the study device and/or use of the 
device.   
JOHNSON & JOHNSON SURGICAL VISION  CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0  / Aug/31/2020                                                      20                                                    PR/DRYE -105-ACTS   
Definitely related:  If the event is associated with the device and/or the use of the 
device beyond a reasonable doubt, a causal relationship exists between the adverse event and the device and/or the use of the study device.  
Probably related:   There is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the adverse event and the device and/or the use of the study device and/or the adverse event cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_5748].  
Possibly related:   The adverse event has not been determined to be related to the device or the use of the device, but no other cause has been 
identified and the device and/or the use of the study device 
cannot be ruled out as a possible cause.  
Unlikely to be related:  The possibility of a potential causal relationship between 
adverse event and the device and/or the use of the device could 
exist, but the adverse event can be reasonably explained by 
[CONTACT_5748].  
Not related:  There is no possibility of a causal relationship between the adverse event and the device and/or the use of the study device and/or the adverse event can be attributed to another cause.  
If an adverse event is believed to be definitely, probably or possibly related to the study device and/or the use of the device, the event will be considered related to the study device and/or the use of the device.   
11.5 ADVERSE EVENT  FOLLOW -UP 
For every adverse event, appropriate measures should be undertaken to treat and/or 
monitor the subject until resolution occurs.  Obtain and maintain in the subject's files all 
pertinent medical data relating to the event including the subject’s medical records and medical reports and/or judgments from colleagues or outside specialists who assisted in the measurements of the subject. The investigator should keep JJSV closely informed as to the outcome of serious and/or device- related adverse events, thereby [CONTACT_277542].  A SAE/ADE  
Follow- up CRF should be completed each time the subject returns to the investigator  for 
follow- up of serious and/or device- related adverse event until resolution of the event.  
Any subject who is exited from the study due to a serious and/or device- related adverse 
event or prior to resolution of such an event will be followed until the outcome is 
determined.  
12.0 PROTOCOL CHANGES/AMENDMENTS  
If the investigator desires to modify any procedure and/or the design of the study, he or 
she must contact [CONTACT_887406] & JOHNSON SURGICAL VISION  CONFIDENTIAL

investigative product inventory records and logs to ensure Activator accountability 
compliance and complete investigational traceability .   
Site Monitoring Plan  
Prior to performing site initiation, the requirements of the study and reporting 
mechanisms will be explained to each investigator.  When necessary, a pre- study site 
qualification visit may be performed to assess the adequacy of the site to perform the study for sites that have not previously worked with JJSV or have undergone significant changes or have not been visited in the past year.  A study initiation visit may be 
conducted prior to the first treatment.  
Throughout the duration of the study, the compliance to this protocol will be monitored 
remotely or at each investigative site.  During interim site monitoring visits, JJ SV will 
review informed consent documents and subject eligibility, and the data on study case report forms will be verified against subject charts and other source documents to ensure complete and accurate reporting.  The subject files will also be reviewed to assure that all adverse events and any issues encountered with JJSV products have been reported in a timely fashion.  
JJSV will also review source documents to verify that all required items have been documented in the subject medical charts.  Refer to Section 14.1, Source Documents, 
for a list of items that are required for source documentation.   
Training on study -specific procedures may also be conducted during monitoring visits.  
Upon study completion, a final close- out site visit to each site will be made to monitor the 
last of the subject data records and finalize any outstanding study issues.  
A separate Study Monitoring Plan will be established prior to study start that will define 
the type and frequency of monitoring visits and frequency of record monitoring.    
15.3 Safety Monitoring  
The medical monitor will review results throughout the clinical trial as necessary to 
ensure the continued safety of the device and to ensure that no subjects are exposed to unreasonable risk.  The medical monitor will be available to answer all questions 
from investigators.  The medical monitor will review and assess any reports of serious 
and/or device- related adverse events as well as device deficiencies that could have 
led to a serious adverse event and discuss these with the reporting investigator(s) as necessary.  The medical monitor, as well as any other qualified personnel designated by [CONTACT_32496], shall also review any interim progress reports, as applicable.

POTENTIAL RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT  
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH USE OF LIPI[INVESTIGATOR_887386]- significant risk.  No device -related 
serious adverse events are anticipated with the use of the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_887379]. Transient, 
non-serious adverse events which may result from the use of the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_887387], but are not limited to, the onset or increase in the following ocular signs or symptoms that  are either 1) clinically significant as determined by [CONTACT_737], or 2) 
require medical treatment for resolution:  
• Eyelid/eye pain requiring discontinuation of the treatment procedure;  
• Eyelid irritation or inflammation (e.g., edema, bruising, blood blister, dermatitis, 
hordeolum or chalazion);  
• Ocular surface irritation or inflammation (e.g., corneal abrasion, conjunctival edema 
or conjunctival injection/hyperemia); and 
• Ocular symptoms (e.g., burning, stinging, tearing, itching, discharge, redness, foreign body sensation, visual disturbance, sensitivity to light).  
RISK MANAGEMENT  
Subjects will be closely monitored thr oughout  the trial duration. The occurrence of 
adverse events and complaints will be assessed at each study visit and reported to JJSV according to Section 11.0, Adverse Events and Product Complaints.  Additionally, JJSV 
will monitor incoming data following the procedures outlined in Section 15.0, Monitoring.  
The Medical Monitor will ensure subjects are not exposed to additional risks by 
[CONTACT_203193], device- related adverse events, and device-
deficiencies that could have led to serious adverse events (Section 15.3, Safety Monitoring).  
POTENTIAL BENEFITS 
There may not be any direct  benefit  for the subjects participating in the clinical study. 
The study will provide data to confirm the clinical use of the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_887333] -2100 to successfully complete a Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_887357]. 
CONCLUSION 
The hazards/risks associated with the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_887388].  The 
hazards/risks associated with the Activator Model LFD -2100  were mitigated to as low as 
possible, and residual risks were addressed via risk -benefits analysis.  The conclusion of 
the risk -benefits analysis was that the benefit gained from testing the Activator LFD -2100 
in the study outweighs the relatively low risk of harm after all mitigations are implemented when the devices are used as intended.

 There are approximately [ADDRESS_1241991], facilitating a clear view of the meibomian gland orifices.  
5. To facilitate observation of the gland secretions, gently wipe the gland orifices along the eyelid margin clean with a dry cotton swab immediately after applying pressure while 
maintaining the Meibomian Gland Evaluator in position and maintaining pressure.

 APPENDIX F   INSTRUCTIONS FOR OCULAR SURFACE STAINING  
CORNEAL STAINING  
The Investigator or designee assesses the corneal staining after instillation of fluorescein dye in 
the eye using the following method.  
1. Place one drop of commercially available saline on a standard fluorescein strip.  Take care 
to avoid applying the saline to the fluorescein strip holder. Do not shake the strip. Wait ten seconds after application of the saline before proceeding.  
2. Instruct the patient to look down and towards the opposite hand from the eye receiving the stain. It may be helpful to ask the subject to fixate on his/her own thumb. Place the subject’s thumb to rest on the opposite leg to achieve inferior fixation of approximately [ADDRESS_1241992] with the ocular surface. 
Withdraw the strip and release the upper lid.  
NOTE: If the size of the strip prevents application to the desired position on the superior 
temporal bulbar conjunctiva, apply the strip to a location on the bulbar conjunctiva 
as close as possible to the preferred position.   
4. Instruct the subject to close the eyelids completely three times.  Wait 1.5 minutes (90 seconds) before evaluating the ocular surface for staining.  
5. To observe the fluorescein staining, evaluate the subject’s eye under the slit -lamp 
biomicroscope using a cobalt blue filter transmitting 330 to 400 nm and a beam approximately 4 mm wide and l0 mm high.  
6. Examine the entire cornea. Grade the corneal staining observed in the central, inferior, nasal, temporal and superior regions as shown in Figure 4 on a scale of 0 to 3 based on the 
Report of the National Eye Institute/Industry Workshop on Clinical Trials in Dry Eye.  Document the staining grade.

 CONJUNCTIVAL STAINING  
The Investigator or designee assesses the conjunctival staining after instillation of lissamine green 
dye in the eye using the following method.  
1. Place one drop of commercially available saline on a standard lissamine green strip.  Take 
care to avoid applying the saline to the strip holder. Do not shake the strip. Wait ten seconds 
after application of the saline before proceeding.  
2. Instruct the patient to look down and towards the opposite hand from the eye receiving the 
stain. It may be helpful to ask the subject to fixate on his/her own thumb. Place the subject’s 
thumb to rest on the opposite leg to achieve inferior fixation of approximately [ADDRESS_1241993] with the ocular surface. Withdraw the 
strip and release the upper lid.  
NOTE: If the size of the strip prevents application to the desired position on the superior 
temporal bulbar conjunctiva, apply the strip to a location on the bulbar conjunctiva 
as close as possible to the preferred position.   
4. Instruct the subject to close the eyelids completely three times.  Wait 1.5 minutes (90 seconds) before evaluating the ocular surface for staining.  
5. To observe the lissamine green staining, evaluate the subject’s eye under the slit -lamp 
biomicroscope with a beam approximately 4 mm wide and l0 mm high.  
6. Examine the entire bulbar conjunctiva. Grade the conjunctival staining observed in the six regions as shown in Figure 5 on a scale of 0 to 3 based on the Report of the National Eye 
Institute/Industry Workshop on Clinical Trials in Dry Eye. Document the staining grade.

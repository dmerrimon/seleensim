Study Design  
 
 
 
 This study is designed to explore the efficacy of ORMD -0801 
compared to placebo on endogenous glucose production in subjects  
with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Subjects  will undergo an initial 
Screening Visit (Visit 0) to establish their eli gibility to participate in 
the study. At Visit 1 ( 2 week s after the Screening Visit), qualifying 
subjects  will be randomized to either ORMD -0801 (8 mg) or  matching  
placebo , study medication will be dispensed and subjects will dos e 
twice a day, once in the morning prior to breakfast a nd once at night 
prior to bedtime. Doses will occur at 45 minutes  (± 15 minutes) before 
breakfast ) and no later than 10 AM each morning, and at 8 PM (± 120 
minutes) each night, and no sooner than [ADDRESS_972911]  
compliance will be assessed, medication will be dispensed, a blood 
sample will be collected to measure HbA1c  and subjects  will be 
questioned for any adverse events . Subjects  will be scheduled to return 
to the clinic in 2 weeks for morning admission (8 AM ±  120 minutes) 
to the PK unit (Visit 3). Subjects  will be provided with standardized 
meals  and the morning dose in- clinic . A light standardized dinner meal 
will be provided at 6 PM ±  30 minutes . At approximately 8 PM (± 60 
minutes, and no sooner than 1 hour after dinner ), subjects  will be dosed 
with their study medication  and will be started on a 16- hour infusion 
of [6,6-2H2]-glucose tracer . Blood samples will be collected  to measure 
endogenous glucose (tracer attached), plasma glucose , metabolites and 
hormones for the duration of the infusion. Blood samples will be drawn 
at baseline ( pre-infusion), 45, 90, 120 and 150 minutes, and 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 hours . Subjects  will be required to 
remain fasting from the evening of Day 28 until the end of the infusion.  
Water intake will be unrestricted.  On Day 29, blood sample will also 
be collected to meas ure HbA1c. Following completion of the infusion, 
the subjects  will receive a standardized lunch and will be observed for 
an additional 6  hours . Prior to discharge, a physical examination will 
be performed , and blood/urine samples will be collected for safety 
chemistry, hematology and urinalysis, following which subjects  will 
be discharged from the CRU and will exit the study.

CONFIDENTIAL  1 INTRODUCTION 
Endogenous insulin – secreted by [CONTACT_941] ß -cells of the endocrine pancreas – flows to the liver in the 
portal blood before reaching the systemic circulation through the hepatic veins. Following oral 
administration, the insulin in ORMD -0801 is absorbed through the gastrointestinal mucosa into 
the mesenteric veins (mostly, the superior mesenteric vein that drains blood from the jejunum and ileum) and reaches the liver via  the portal vein, thereby [CONTACT_714419]. The main action of insulin in the liver is to suppress glucose production; for this action, sensitivity is higher, and onset and offset time of this action are faster than for insulin stimulation of glucose uptake by [CONTACT_714420]. First -pass extraction of insulin by [CONTACT_714421] 
50-60%; recirculation raises this percentage to ~80%. As a consequence, portal plasma insulin 
concentrations normally are ~3- fold higher than peripheral insulin levels.  
The hypothesis behind ORMD -[ADDRESS_972925] non- invasive approach to measure endogenous glucose 
production (EGP) 
[1].  A tracer (in this protocol, [6,6-2H2]-glucose, a stable isotope of glucose) 
infused intravenously at a constant rate will equilibrate with endogenous glucose across its 
distribution space within ~[ADDRESS_972926], the ratio of the tracer infusion rate to 
the plasma tracer/tracee ratio (as assayed by [CONTACT_134294]) measures EGP. As compared to placebo, 
oral insulin is expected to reduce EGP over the ensuing 13 hours of continued fasting. In patients 
with type 2 diabetes, EGP is known to be abnormally elevated and to contribute the 
hyperglycemia [2]. Oral insulin is therefore addressing a key pathophysiological derangement of 
type 2 diabetes.

CONFIDENTIAL  3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This study is designed to explore the efficacy of ORMD -0801 compared to placebo on 
endogenous glucose production in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Subjects  will undergo 
an initial Screening Visit (Visit 0) to establish their eli gibility to participate in the study. At Visit 1 
(2 week s after the Screening Visit), qualifying subjects  will be randomized to either ORMD -0801 
(8 mg) or matching placebo, study medication will be dispensed and subjects will  dose , twice a 
day, once in the morning prior to breakfast and once at night prior to bedtime. Doses will occur at  
45 minutes (± 15 minutes) before breakfast  and no later than 10 AM each morning, and at  8 PM 
(± 120 minutes) each night, and  no sooner than [ADDRESS_972928]  compliance will be assessed, medication will 
be dispensed, a blood sample will be collected to measure HbA1c  and subjects  will be questioned 
for any adverse events . Subjects  will be scheduled to return to the clinic in 2 weeks for morning 
admission (8 AM ±  120 minutes) to the PK unit (Visit 3). Subjects will be provided with 
standardized meals  and the morning dose in- clinic . A light standardized dinner meal will be 
provided at 6 PM ±  30 minutes . At approximately 8 PM (± 60 min utes, and no sooner than 1 hour 
after dinner ), subjects  will be dosed with their study medication and will be started on a 16- hour 
infusion of [6,6-2H2]-glucose tracer. Blood samples will be collected to measure endogenous 
glucose (tracer attached ), plasma glucose, metabolites and hormones for the duration of the 
infusion. Blood samples will be drawn at baseline ( pre-infusion), 45, 90, 120 and 150 minute s, 
and 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 hours (see Table 2  for blood draw schedule). 
Subjects  will be required to remain fasting from the evening of Day 28 until the end of the 
infusion. Water intake will be unrestricted. On Day 29, blood sample will also be collected to 
measure HbA1c.  Following completion of the infusion, the subjects  will receive a standardized 
lunch and will be observed for an additional 6 hours . Prior to discharge, a physical examination 
will be performed , and blood/urine samples will be collected for safety chemistry, hematology 
and urinalysis, following which subjects  will be discharged from the CRU and will exit the study.  
3.2 Screening/Visit 0 ( Week -3 to -1 , Day -21 to -7 ) 
At the S creening  Visit (Visit 0) , potential subjects will be given a detailed oral presentation 
describing the nature, purpose, risks, and requirements of the study and will receive detailed written information . Subjects will be given ample time to consider participation and ask questions which 
will be adequately addressed by [CONTACT_8786].  
Once the subject is satisfied that he/she is willing to participate in the study, he/she will be a sked to 
sign the study informed consent form (ICF) (refer to Section 11.2.4 for further detail regarding the 
ICF). The investigational site personnel obtaining written consent from the subject will also sign the form to confirm consent has been obtained.  
Once signed, the Investigator will retain the original ICF for the subject’s study records and provide the subject with a signed copy. The i nvestigator will verify that informed consent has been obtained 
from each subject prior to enrollment  into the study and prior to the subject undergoing any study-
related procedures.

included in the safety analyses. Thus, every effort will be  made to contact a ny subject who fail s to 
attend any follow -up appointments/contacts, in order to ensure that he/she is in satisfactory health.  
If a subject  withdraws from the study as a result of meeting discontinuation criteria after the start of 
study treatment administration, reasonable efforts should be made to have the subject  return for the

CONFIDENTIAL  early withdrawal evaluations ( Section 3.6). Any subject withdrawn due to a suspected study 
treatment -related AE should be followed until resolution or stabilization of the event. 
If a subject becomes pregnant, study treatment will be discontinued immediately. The subject will 
be followed until delivery or other termination of pregnancy for outcome. 
The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study, and the Investigator/Investigational Site has the 
right to close the site, at any time, although this should occur only after consultation between involved parties. The Investigator will notify the IRB in writing of a premature termination of a 
study or closure of Investigational Site, and will send a copy of the notification to the Sponsor.   
Events that may trigger premature termination of a study or closure of an Investigational Site 
include, but are not limited to, a new toxicity finding, a request to discontinue the trial from a regulatory authority, non-compliance with the protocol, GCP violations, slow r ecruitment/low 
enrollment, or change in development plans for the study treatment. 
If either of the criteria listed below is met, enrollment of new subjects and dosing of ongoing 
subject s will be temporarily stopped. The Investigator, Sponsor, and the Medical Monitor will 
discuss whether a lower dose or any additional treatment guidelines should be implemented, or if the trial should be permanently stopped. Any proposed changes to the protocol to address such findings will be submitted for review and approval by [CONTACT_344262]- starting the trial.

prohibited therapy is in the best interest of the subject’s  health and well -being, the i nvestigator and 
sponsor will jointly decide to continue or discontinue study treatment for the subject . 
Medications and supplements should be recorded according to the generic name [CONTACT_248484].  
The use of c oncomitant medications and supplements should be limited to those that are medically 
necessary.  Any medication or supplement  used should have an indication recorded, and for 
concomitant medications and supplements, this indication must be represented as either  for the 
treatment of an AE , for the management of a pre -existing condition, or for prophylaxis.  
Dosage increases for any concomitant medication  or supplement  should be noted and the reason for 
the dosage increase recorded as an  AE (assumes worsening condition). The side effects of 
concomitant medications will be recorded as AEs .  
Any subject  whose condition becomes disqualifying during the course of the study may be treated 
for that condition. If the condition is suspected during S creening  (Visit 0) , the subject should not be 
enrolled. Treatment of the condition should be instituted according to the Investigator’s/attending 
physician's judgment.  
Medications that have no treatment intent but rather are part of supportive routine care such as local 
anesthetics, intravenous solutions to maintain fluid balance and keep access open, medications used 
for prophylaxis, and narcotics for postsurgical pain must also be recorded in the subject ’s medical 
record and eCRF .

CONFIDENTIAL  7 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SAFETY REPORTING  
7.1 Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_1125], physical 
examinations, 12- lead ECGs, weight, vital signs (SBP/DBP and heart rate) and clinical safety 
labs (hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis). 
7.2 Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE)  is defined in 21 CFR 312.32(a)  as follows:  
Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or 
not considered drug related. 
 
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign ( e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease during the course of the study, and does not imply any judgment about causality . 
Treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) are defined as any AE that starts  or increases in 
severity after the first  randomized dose of study treatment (active or placebo) .  
7.3 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is defined in 21 CFR 312.32(a) as follows : 
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes : 
• Death; 
• Life-threatening AE;  
• Inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
• Persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions;  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatie nt hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
An AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, its 
occurrence places the subject or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Oramed  Ltd.  Protocol No. ORA -D-[ADDRESS_972954] dose of active treatment o r placebo  (Visit 
1) and will continue through Visit 3. Any subject with a possible study treatment- related AE at the 
end of the study will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the event. Further, any SAE, 
whether or not related to study treatment that occurs within [ADDRESS_972955]'s 
source documentation and in the eCRF. 
Subjects will be instructed to report all AEs experienced during the study, and subjects will be 
assessed  in clinic  for the occurrence of AEs  throughout the study. In order to avoid bias in eliciting 
AEs, subjects will be asked general, non-leading questions such as "How are you feeling?" 
All AEs , including TEAEs, reported by [CONTACT_423], observed or otherwise identified by [CONTACT_3786], or other Investigational Site  personnel will be documented.   
Medical conditions existing at Screening should be recorded as medical history. New or worsening 
pre-existing m edical conditions or diseases are considered AEs if they arise or worsen after the 
Screening visit, and should be recorded as AEs. 
Surgical procedures themselves are not AEs; they are therapeutic measures for conditions that 
require surgery. The condition for which the surgery is required is an AE if it occurs or is detected following the first dose of Study treatment Visit 1. Conditions leading to planned surgical procedures are not AEs if the condition(s) was (were) known before study treatment . In the latter 
case, the condition should be reported as medical history. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_972956]’s source documentation and on the AE page of the eCRF. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_714409] e CRF pages or 
an SAE listing generated based on the eCRF  pages will be submitted to the Sponsor at regularly 
scheduled intervals to allow the Sponsor to meet expedited regulatory reporting requirements under 
21 CFR 312.32 ( see Section 7.4.2  for further detail ) and regular regulatory reporting requirements 
under 21 CFR 312.33.  
For each AE, the following information will be entered in the eCRF:  
• Medical diagnosis of the event in standard medical terminology (if a medical diagnosis 
cannot be determined, a description of each sign or symptom characterizing the event); 
• Date of onset of any new AE or worsening of a previously observed AE. 
• Date of resolution of the event (or confirmation ongoing).; 
• Whether the event is serious (per definition in Section 7.3), and if so, the reason it is 
considered serious; 
• Severity  of AE (per definition in Section 7.6);  
• Assessment of the attributability of the AE to the study treatment [per definition in 
Section  7.4];   
• Whether the event is expected (per definition in Section  7.7);

SAE Forms will be provided by [CONTACT_714431] ( CRO ). If all information is not known at the time of initial reporting, an initial 
report should still be made. In the event there is a question as to whether the experience is serious, the information should be forwarded to the Medical Monitor for review. The  
Investigator is responsible for following up on completion of the SAE Form. For all serious adverse events, the Investigator must to pursue and provide information to the Study Medical Monitor in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified abov e. In general, this will 
include a description of the adverse event in enough detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as conc omitant medications and illnesses, must be provided. In 
the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to the Medical Monitor” . 
 In the event of a medical emergency or an SAE that is unexpected (as defined in Section 7.8)  and 
possibly related to the study treatment (s) (i.e., an adverse reaction or suspected adverse reaction as defined in Section 7.6), in  the opi[INVESTIGATOR_714410], the blind 
will be broken for the subject that experiences the event. If the Investigational Site personnel need to unblind the study treatment they can contact [CONTACT_714432] . 
The initial SAE Form and any subsequent follow -up SAE Forms submitted to provide more 
accurate, corrected, or new information must be signed by [CONTACT_737]. The Investigator and 
Oramed  Ltd.  Protocol No. ORA -D-[ADDRESS_972958] make every reasonable effort to obtain, from other institutions if 
necessary, all supporting medical case records as needed to comply with expedited Investigational New Drug application (IND) safety reporting requirement s.   
If the SAE involves expedited IND safety reporting (as determined by [CONTACT_16015]), all supporting medical records must be submitted to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_972959] also promptly inform the governing IRB of the SAE  in accordance with  the 
governing IRB’s requirements . Any SAE that is determined by [CONTACT_714433] (as defined in 21 CFR 312.32) will be reported to FDA by [CONTACT_344269]. All IND Safety Reports will also be promptly provided to the Investigator for submission to his/her IRB. Similarly, any SAE that is determined by [CONTACT_714434], and will be provided to the Investigator for submission to his/her IRB. 
The Investigator , Medical Monitor , and Sponsor  will review each SAE report and evaluate the 
relationship of the adverse experience to study treatment  and to underlying disease. Based on this  
assessment, a decision will be made concerning the need for further action. The primary 
consideration governing further action is whether new findings affect the safety of subjects participating in the clinical trial. If the discovery of a new adverse exp erience related to the study 
treatment  raises concern over the saf ety of continued administration of study treatment , the Sponsor 
will take immediate steps to notify the regulatory authorities.  
Further action that may be required includes the following:  
1. Alteration of existing research by [CONTACT_124938];  
2. Discontinuation or suspension of the study;  
3. Alteration of the informed consent process by [CONTACT_241805];  
4. Modification of previously identified expected adverse experiences to include adverse expe riences newly identified as s tudy treatment -related.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy Reporting  
If the subject or partner of a subject participating in the study becomes pregnant during the study or within [ADDRESS_972960] or partner should be followed by [CONTACT_42498]. If 
the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator should notify the 
Sponsor. At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the 
pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an

Phase 2b Clinical Study  May 13 , 2020  Page 42 
CONFIDENTIAL  SAE (i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital 
anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
7.4.3  Adverse Events of Hypoglycemia  
Hypoglycemia and associated symptoms (e.g., weakness, dizziness, shakiness, increased sweating, 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], or confusion), have been associated with insulin administration, including ORMD-0801. Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with ORMD-0801. It is not known whether ORMD -[ADDRESS_972961] not been completed to assess whether ORMD- 0801 impairs fertility.  
Due to the specific relevance of hypoglycemia as a limiting factor in insulin therapy, AEs of 
hypoglycemia will be reviewed at every visit. All hypoglycemic events  will be reported on a special 
hypoglycemia AE eCRF page.  This will include the following information: 
• Subject symptoms;  
• Type of symptoms;  
• BG value during the hypoglycemic event and the event severity based on CTCAE 
criteria ; 
• Whether  treatment was required ; 
• Whether  assistance was required for treatment ; 
• What specific treatment , if any, was used . 
 
Instructions will be given to sites to additionally report epi[INVESTIGATOR_714411] (SAE). 
 
Collection of data from the hypoglycemia AE eCRF including epi[INVESTIGATOR_714412] (Seaquist et al, 2013) and according to common cut-off values, such as BG < 70 mg/dL and < 53 mg/dL for example.   
7.4.4  Adverse Events of Hyperglycemia  
Hyperglycemia is the result of inadequate treatment and a pre-condition for enrolment into the 
study, therefore in general hyperglycemia is not considered an AE . However, hyperglycemia may 
occur in participants during the study either due to worsening diabetes or lack of efficacy of study medication. For standardization purposes, hyperglycemia is defined as a blood glucose reading > 300 mg/dL regardless of symptoms. Subject s who have a blood glucose reading > 300 mg/dL will 
have the reading repeated [ADDRESS_972962] ’s glucose remains above 300 mg/dL or for 
persistent symptoms of hyperglycemia, the subject will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_714435] -up.

CONFIDENTIAL  7.5 Causality Assessment of Adverse Events  
For all AEs, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_344253] (active or placebo) . The causality assessment must be recorded in the subject’s 
source documents and on the AE eCRF . Causal relationship will be classified acco rding to the 
following criteria:  
1. Unrelated : The event is clearly  due to causes  other  than  the active study drug.  
2. Unlikely : The event is doubtfully related  to active  study drug. The  event  was most likely  
related  to other  factors  such  as the subject’s  clinical  state,  concomitant  drugs  or other 
therapeutic interventions.  
3. Possible : The event  follows a  reasonable temporal  sequence  from  the time  of active study 
drug administration  but could have been produced by [CONTACT_714436]’s  
clinical  state,  therapeutic interventions  or concomitant  drugs. 
4. Probable : The event  follows a  reasonable temporal  sequence from  the time  of active 
study drug administration  and follows  a known response pattern  to the  drug.  The toxicity  
cannot  be reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_714436]’s  clinical  state,  
therapeutic interventions  or concomitant  drugs.  
5. Definite : The event  follows a  reasonable temporal  sequence  from  the time  of active study 
drug administration,  follows  a known response pattern  to the  drug,  cannot  be reasonably  
explained  by [CONTACT_714437]’s  condition, concomitant  drugs  or 
therapeutic interventions,  AND either occurs  immediately  following active study drug 
administration,  improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_714413], or  reappears  on re -exposure. 
 
7.6 Adverse Event Severity Assessment  
The severity of each AE will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE, version 4.03. The severity of AEs that are not specifically listed in the CTCAE will be categorized according to the general guidelines provided in the CTCAE, and as summarized in the table  below.  
Table 3. General Guidelines for Severity Assessment of Adverse Events  
Grade 1 :  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2 :  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) [preparing meals, 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc.].  
Grade 3 :  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -
care ADL (bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden).  
Grade 4 :  Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5 : Death related to AE.

CONFIDENTIAL  Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe AE is not 
necessarily a SAE. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with subject 's 
usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs, listed above in Section 7.3. 
7.7 Expectedness of Adverse Event  
An unexpected AE is defined in 21 CFR 312.32(a)  as follows : 
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an IB is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investiga tional plan or elsewhere in the 
current application, as amended.  
7.8 Assessment of Adverse Event Outcome 
Outcome of AEs will be defined according to International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH) 
Topic E2B, ICH Guideline. 
• Recovered/Resolved:  The subject has recovered fully from the AE without any 
remaining effects or impairment.  
• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae: The subject has recovered, but with an after effect possibly due to disease or treatment.  
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved:  The condition is still present.  
• Fatal: Fatal should only be used when death is possibly related to the AE.  
• Unknown: The primary outcome is not known at the time of the final assessment. If an outcome for an AE is not available at the time of the initial report, follow -up will proceed 
until an outcome is known or followed up to the Final Study Visit. Any subject with a possible study treatment -related AE at the Final Study Visit will be followed until 
resolution or stabilization of the event. Further, any SAE, whether or not related to Study treatment (active or placebo), that occurs within [ADDRESS_972963] dose of Study treatment will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the  event.  
7.9 Clinical Findings  
Any significant clinical findings at Visit 3 will be followed until the condition returns to pre -
study status, stabilize s, or can be explained as not being study treatment  related. If the clinical 
finding is reported as an AE (per the criteria outlined in Section  7.4), the follow -up procedures 
for AEs defined above will apply.

CONFIDENTIAL  8 STATISTICAL METHODS  
This section describes the statistical methods to be used for the analysis and reporting of data 
collected under Protocol No. ORA -D-018. Additional details will be provided in the statistical 
analysis plan . 
8.1 Study Design  
The primary analysis is a comparison of difference in endogenous glucose production for the ORMD- 0801 treated group and placebo. Let pC be the endogenous glucose production for the 
control (placebo) arm and let pT be the endogenous glucose production for the treatment (ORMD -
0801) arm. The primary analysis is:  
H0 : pC=pT  
H1 : pC ≠pT 
Trial success is defined as having the endogenous glucose production for the placebo group being greater than the endogenous glucose production for the ORMD -0801 treated group.  
8.2 Sample Size  
Sample size determination was not based on statistical considerations.  
8.3 Primary Efficacy Evaluation  
The primary endpoint for this study is the difference in endogenous glucose production between active and placebo as measured by [CONTACT_714438]
(0-16). 
 The primary endpoint will be analyzed using an Analysis of Variance model with treatment as the 
main effect.  
8.4 Secondary Efficacy Evaluation  
8.4.1  16-Hour Tracer Infusion 
A 16 -hour tracer infusion will be performed after 28 days of treatment. The blood draw schedule 
during the tracer infusion is documented in Table 2  in Section 3.7 of the protocol. Based on the 
blood draws the values for the following lab tests will be obtained:  
• Endogenous Glucose Production (glucose that is produced by [CONTACT_714429]),  
• Key metabolites (β -hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, lactate, pyruvate, FFA, glycerol), and  
• Key hormones (insulin, C -peptide, glucagon).  
 For each of the lab tests, the following parameters will be derived (as appropriate):  
• AUC
(0-16), 
• AUC (0-2), AUC (0-4), AUC (0-8), AUC (0-12), 
• AUC (2-16), AUC (4-16), AUC (8-16), AUC (12-16),

CONFIDENTIAL  • Cmax (endogenous glucose production only),  
• Tmax (endogenous glucose production only), and  
• Tlag (endogenous glucose production only). 
 
Each of these parameters for each of the tests will be analyzed using an Analysis of Variance model with treatment as the main effect.  
 
8.4.2  Hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) 
Hemoglobin A1c will be collected prior to dosing and after [ADDRESS_972964] and baseline value as the covariate.  
 
8.4.5  Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (Total Cholesterol, LDL Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol and Triglycerides)  
Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_714408] [ADDRESS_972965] -case attribution will be presented in the summary tables.  
TEAEs  will be listed for individual subjects, along with information regarding onset  and end dates, 
onset time where available, severity, seriousness, relationship t o study treatment , action taken, and 
outcome. A similar listing will be prepared for the pretreatment AEs.   
TEAEs that lead to withdrawal from the study will be separately listed and summarized.   
Descriptive statistics will be generated as appropriate (i.e., frequency for categorical data). Inferential statistical analysis comparing the AE  data between active and placebo  is not planned.  
 
8.5.3  Laboratory Evaluations  
Individual clinical safety lab (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis)  values will be listed by 
[CONTACT_248460] (i.e., mean, median, range, and 
standard deviation for continuous data and frequency for categorical data) . Individual change from 
baseline ( Screening ) in lab oratory  values will be calculated and summarized descriptively.  A 
clinically significant change from baseline  will be recorded as an AE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_3786] . 
 8.5.4  Vital Signs  
Individual vital sign measurements (height, weight, seated SBP/DBP, and heart rate ) will be 
listed by [CONTACT_358917] (i.e., 
mean, median, range, and standard deviation) . Individual change from baseline  in vital sign 
measurements will be calculated and summarized descriptively. A clinically significant change 
from baseline  will be recorded as a  TEAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_737] .

Data from the source documents  will be  entered into the EDC system by [CONTACT_714440] . Data Management staff, using both electronic and manu al checks, will 
systematically check  the data.  Errors or omissions will result in queries  (which can be issued by [CONTACT_714441]) , which will be  presented to the Investigational Site 
within the EDC system. The Investigational Site will resolve the queries within the EDC system.  
The Study Monitor and Data Management staff will review the responses as part of the query resolution process. The EDC system will track the queries with the corresponding responses.  
Medications and supplements entered into the database will be coded in the EDC system using the 
WHO Drug Reference List, which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. AEs  and Medical History will be coded in the EDC system using MedDRA terminology.  
Laboratory samples will be processed by [CONTACT_714428]. Results will be reported to Integrium and imported  into the database . 
9.2 Quality Assurance and Database Lock  
A 100% critical variable review of all key safety and secondary endpoint data in the database will be performed.  Following this review, a data quality control audit or a random sample equal to 10% 
of subjects, with a minimum of 5 subjects will be performed . 
When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, the database will be locked.  Any 
changes to the database after that time can only be made by [CONTACT_324569], the Investigator, Integrium , and the study biostatistician . 
10 AMENDMENTS/MODIFICATIONS OF THIS PROTOCOL 
The Investigator will ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with the procedures and evaluations described in this protocol. As the study progresses it may become necessary to change or modify parts of the protocol. The Sponsor or designee is res ponsible for submitting protocol 
amendments to the appropriate government regulatory authorities. The Investigator is responsible for submitting protocol amendments to the appropriate IRB. Approval by [CONTACT_248468] .

14.1 Guidelines for T RACER Infusion  
 EGP Protocol  
 
Tracer:  [6,6 -2H2]-glucose (from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories 
[https://shop.isotope.com/productdetails.aspx?itemno=DLM -349-PK])  
Constant tracer infusion rate :  0.28 µmol.min-1.kg-1 (= 51 µg.min-1.kg-1) via an indwelling 
catheter in an antecubital vein. Assuming participants have dinner at 18:00pm, the tracer 
infusion can start at 20:00pm and continue until 12 noon the following day, i.e. , for 960 
min.  
Example:  In a T2D subject  weighing 90 kg, the total amount of tracer would be 0.28 x  
960 x  90 = 24,192 µmol (= 4.41 g per study). Rounding this up, on dissolves 4.5 g of [6,6-
2H2]-glucose in 500 mL of saline: this is the mother solution (from which a [ADDRESS_972981] be saved together with the plasma samples) to be given at a rate of 0.5 mL/min to the 
90-kg person for 960 min. 
Blood sampling :  through a cannula in a contralateral antecubital vein, one sample is taken 
prior to starting the tracer infusion, then blood is drawn every hour till the end.

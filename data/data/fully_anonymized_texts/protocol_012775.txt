the trial; 60 subjects were in  the lower gestational age stratum 240-266 wk and 34  
subjects were in the higher  gestational age stratum 270-286 wk. The Ureaplasma 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_668129] 54% in  the lower GA stratum  in contrast 
to 16%  colonization rate in more mature infants in the higher GA stratum.  Using a 2 -
sided α level of 0.05 and  assuming 20% of subjects are twins and 5% drop -out rate,  the 
study will have power of 0.[ADDRESS_902479] a 40% difference in the primary outcome of 
survival with Ureaplasma clearance  with enrollment of 30 Ureaplasma- positive inf ants in 
each group (See Table 6, Section 9.2 , p. 46). The change in eligibility criteria to limit 
enrollment to the lower GA stratum  will reduce the number of total enroll ment from  the 
originally planned  [ADDRESS_902480] been underlined 
in the text. 
 Version Number 5.0 
Version Date 1/302017 
Summary of Revisions Made:  
1. Added Ages and Stage Questionnaire -3 (ASQ -3) as Neurodevelopmental Assessment 
Tool: Since some subjects are unable to return for in -person neurodevelopmental 
assessments (neuromotor exam and BSID -III), the ASQ -[ADDRESS_902481] neurodevelopmental 
impairment in preterm infants <32 weeks gestation at 22 -26 months adjusted age  1

PPRRÉÉCCIISS    
Study Title: A Phase IIb randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma respi[INVESTIGATOR_668130]. respi[INVESTIGATOR_668131] a risk factor for the development of the 
chronic lung disorder bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants 
2,3. 
Preliminary data suggests that Ureaplasma-colonized infants may be at continued 
increased risk for adverse pulmonary outcomes in the first year of life. Trials of antibiotic 
therapy with erythromycin in the first few weeks of life often failed to eradicate 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_668132]-infected infants 4-6. 
There are no current effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_668133]. Our long-term objective is to develop therapi[INVESTIGATOR_668134]-mediated lung 
inflammation, injury, altered developmental signaling, and fibrosis.  
The azalide antibiotic azithromcyin (AZI) has immunomodulatory properties that make it an ideal candidate for therapy to prevent Ureaplasma-mediated lung injury in preterm 
infants. Azithromycin 1) inhibits neutrophil influx and chemoattractant/cytokine release in murine lung injury models 
7-9; 2) exhibits higher potency than erythromycin against 
clinical Ureaplasma isolates in vitro 10; and 3) is preferentially concentrated in alveolar 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_668135] 11,12. In a neonatal murine Ureaplasma infection 
model, AZI, but not erythromycin treatment, improved survival and reduced lung inflammation 
13.  
We hypothesize that intravenous (IV) AZI therapy will prevent BPD in Ureaplasma -
colonized preterm infants by [CONTACT_668217]/or down-
regulating the pulmonary inflammatory response. We conducted a Phase I open-
label, pharmacokinetic (PK) study characterizing the single dose PK, safety, tolerability, 
and biologic effects of 10 and 20 mg/kg IV AZI in mec hanically ventilated 24-[ADDRESS_902495] 
colonization and BPD. Pharmacokinetic data from 25 neonates (12 dosed with 10 mg/kg 
iv and 13 dosed with 20 mg/kg iv)  were analyzed using a population modeling  
approach. A two-compartment structural model with the clearance and volume of 
peripheral compartment (V2) allometrically scaled on body weight best described the 
PK of AZI in preterm neonates. Although both single dose regimens appeared to b e 
safe, the single 10 mg/kg dose was  insufficient to eradicate Ureaplasma or to suppress 
pulmonary inflammatory responses. Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that even 
multiple dose administration of 10 mg/kg AZI would be inadequate to maintain AZI 
plasma concentrations above the Ureaplasma MIC 50. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_668136] 20 mg/kg single dose compared to 43% failure rate in the 10 mg/kg group 
14, simulations suggest that multiple azithromycin 
dose regimens may be needed to mainta in a plasma concentration of azithromycin  
above MIC 50 to clear the organisms.  
We then enrolled 15 subjects from 6 sites in a Phase IIa open-label, pharmacokinetic study characterizing the PK, safety, and biologic effects of 20 mg/kg x 3 days AZI 
regimen. Although there was no difference in physiologic BPD rate s among the three 
azithromycin dose groups, the duration of supplemental oxygen was significantly shorter  
and there was a trend towards shorter duration of mechanical ventilation for the 20 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 14 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  mg/kg multi-dose group. Compared to the single dose groups, the 20 mg/kg mulit -dose 
effectively eradicated the Ureaplasma in all subjects who were colonized pre-dose. The

Aim 1: To determine the safety and microbiological efficacy of a multiple dose course of 
IV AZI to eradicate respi[INVESTIGATOR_668137] a Phase II b multi-center, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial.  
 Primary outcome: To compare the Ureaplasma clearance rate in AZI-treated vs 
placebo-treated infants  
 Secondary Outcomes: To analyze the potential of multiple dose AZI to prevent 
physiologic BPD sufficiently to justify a Phase III clinical  trial 
o To evaluate the relationship of microbiologic eradication of Ureaplasma 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_668138] -treated infants and clinical outcome of physiologic 
BPD at [ADDRESS_902497] of IV AZI on other secondary endpoints including overall 
mortality, number of days of mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplementation, 
exposure to non-study antibiotics, and incidence of co-morbidities of prematurity 
 
Aim 2: To refine the population PK model of the multiple doses of azithromycin in 
preterm infants 24-28 weeks gestation.  
Aim 3: To analyze the potential of multiple dose AZI to improve the pulmonary 
outcomes at 6, 12, and 22-26 months adjusted age assessed as number and duration 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], number of physician a nd emergency visits for respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375], 
frequency of pulmonary medication use, and Infant Lung Health Questionnaire parental report of recurrent wheezing or chronic cough.  
Aim 4: To assess the impact of multiple dose AZI on risk for neurodevelopmental 
impairment at 22-[ADDRESS_902498] the 
efficacy and safety of azithromycin 20 mg/kg x [ADDRESS_902499]-menstrual age (PMA), overall mortality, incidence of co-morbidities of 
prematurity such as intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, 
necrotizing enterocolitis, bacterial and fungal nosocomial infection, pulmonary air leak, 
patent ductus arteriosus, retinopathy of prematurity, number of days of positive 
pressure ventilation, number of days of oxygen supplementation, use of postnatal 
steroids, and use of non-study antibiotics. 
 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study [ADDRESS_902500] 2 hours apart for Ureaplasma culture and PCR and the infant 
randomized to either placebo or azithromycin 20 mg/kg IV x [ADDRESS_902501] dose and at 21d postnatal age (PNA). 
Additional tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_668139]. We have completed collection of 
1-[ADDRESS_902502]-
dose from a sub-group of 30 subjects. Subjects will be followed to discharge for safety. 
Physiologic BPD will be assessed at 36±[ADDRESS_902503].  At 
6, 12, and 22-26 months adjusted age, a pulmonary outcome questionnaire will be administered by [CONTACT_668218].  At 22-26 mont hs adjusted age, 
neurodevelopmental outcomes will be assessed by  1) Bayley Scale of Infant and 
Toddler Development, 3

Gross Motor Function Classification System; and 4) medical record review f or hearing 
impairment with or without amplification and vision impairment (vision <20/200).  For 
infants who are unable to return for an inpatient assessment, the Ages and Stages Questionnaire-3 (ASQ-3) will be administered by [CONTACT_648].  
Sample Size and Population  
We will limit the recruitment after January [ADDRESS_902504] colonization and BPD. All admissions to 
the NICUs of the 7 clinical sites <72 h age with GA 240-266 wk will be screened for 
study eligibility and parental consent of eligible subjects will be obtained.  With a 54% 
colonization rate, a total of [ADDRESS_902505] Ureaplasma infection that might lead to

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was first described over [ADDRESS_902507] immature infants 17, 
occurring in 30% of infants ≤28 wks gestation, but in only 3% of infants >28 weeks 18. 
Compared to the lung histology observed in the ventilated preterm lung during the pre -
exogenous surfactant era, the ‘new’ BPD is characterized by [CONTACT_668220], 
fewer but larger alveoli, and less fulminant, but persistent inflammation 19. Studies of 
human infants and experimental animal models indicate that the central event in BPD pathogenesis is the interruption of normal developmental signaling during early stages 
of lung development by [CONTACT_668221] a subsequent dysregulated inflammatory response 
17. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_668140] ≤[ADDRESS_902508] risk, recently studied therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (post -natal steroids 
20, vitamin A 21, 
caffeine 22,23, inhaled nitric oxide 24,25, and early CPAP 26,27) have had only modest 
impacts on the incidence and severity of BPD. Furthermore, the reduction in early 
pulmonary morbidity may come at the cost of higher neurodevelopmental handicaps 
later in life 28. The effects of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_668141] 29,30. None o f these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_668142]. 
Persistent Ureaplasma  respi[INVESTIGATOR_668143]: Risk factor for BPD: 
Ureaplasma parvum  (serotypes 1, 3, 6, and 14) and U. urealyticum  (serotypes 2, 4, 5, 
7-13) are closely related species of the Mollicutes class that are among the smallest 
free-living, self-replicating cells 2,31,32. All serovars lack cell walls, exhibit limited 
biosynthetic abilities, hydrolyze urea to generate ATP, and adhere to human mucosal surfaces 
2. U. parvum  is the most common species isolated from clinical specimens 2,33. 
Although Ureaplasma spp. are considered commensals in the adult GU tract, they have been implicated in complications of human pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. 
Ureaplasma urogenital tract colonization has been causally linked to infertility 
34,35, early 
pregnancy loss 36, stillbirth 37,38, and preterm birth 39,40. Ureaplasma spp. are the most 
common organisms isolated from amniotic fluid obtained from women who present with 
preterm labor (POL) with intact membranes 41, preterm premature rupture of 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 17 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  membranes 42, and short cervix associated with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity 
43, and from infected placentas 42. Recovery of Ureaplasma from the chorion increased 
with duration of rupture membranes, suggesting an ascending route of infection 39. 
However, Ureaplasma has also been detected in 22% of placentas with duration of 
membrane rupture < 1h, suggesting the possibility of a pre -existing infection. Indeed, 
Ureaplasma species have been detected in amniotic fluid as early as the time of genetic amniocentesis (16-20 weeks) in up to 13% asymptomatic women 
44-47. Placentas with 
the lowest rate of Ureaplasma recovery were from women delivered for pre-eclampsia 
or intrauterine growth restriction 39. 
Vertical transmission is the only known route of infection in the newborn. The rate of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_668144] <1500g birth weight ranges 
from 20-45%, depending on study entry criteria, frequency of sampling and detection methods 
48,49. In a recent cohort of infants <[ADDRESS_902509] week of life in tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_668145] 35% of infants

peripheral blood leukocytosis 51 and early radiographic emphysematous changes of 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) 52,53. These findings may be explained, in part, by 
[CONTACT_668222]. The contribution of Ureaplasma respi[INVESTIGATOR_668147]; 
however, a meta-analysis of [ADDRESS_902510] colonization and 
development of BPD defined as oxygen dependence at 28 to 30 d postnatal age 
48. In a 
meta-analysis of 36 published studies involving ~[ADDRESS_902511] menstrual age (PMA). Studies published since the last meta -analysis support the 
association between Ureaplasma respi[INVESTIGATOR_668148] 54,55, particularly for 
the subset of Ureaplasma-colonized infants exposed to chorioamnionitis and leukocytosis at birth 
55. Some Ureaplasma serovars have been implicated in adverse 
pregnancy outcomes more commonly than others 56-59. Although U. parvum  is more 
commonly isolated from clinical specimens  57,59, there is a higher rate of BPD in U. 
urealyticum  colonized infants 57. Whether there are differences in the in vivo  
response to antibiotic therapy among the serovars or species of Ureaplasma  is 
unknown. 
U. urealyticum modulates the pulmonary immune response : Evidence from studies 
of human preterm infants 60, and intrauterine infection models in mice 61, sheep 62,63, 
and non -human primates 64,65 as well as in vitro studies 66-69 support that Ureaplasma 
infection is pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic and results in a BPD phenotype. In a 
review of lung pathology of archived autopsy specimens from Ureaplasma-infected 
preterm infants, we observed moderate to severe fibrosis and increased elastin fiber accumulation in all Ureaplasma-infected infants compared to non-infected gestational 
controls and infants who died with pneumonia from other causes 
70,71. There were 
increased numbers of myofibroblasts and TNF -alpha and transforming growth factor ß 1 
(TGFß 1)-immunostaining in the lungs of all Ureaplasma-infected infants 70,71. The 
increase in fibrosis and elastin fiber accumulation in the distal lung correlated spatially 
and temporally with the presence of macrophages positive for TGFß 1, suggesting that 
these are closely linked 71. Preterm infants with Ureaplasma respi[INVESTIGATOR_668149]-1ß, TNF -alpha, and m onocyte chemoattractant

Phase IIb AZIP study 18 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  weeks of life compared to non-colonized infants 60,72,73. Experimental murine intrauterine 
U. parvum  exposure stimulated fetal lung cytokine expression and augmented 
hyperoxia-induced lung injury 61. In the 125 d immature baboon model, we observed 
sustained recruitment  of neutrophils and macrophages into the lung, increased 
expression of pro-inflammatory (TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1ß ) and pro-fibrotic 
cytokines (TGFß 1; oncostatin M), extensive fibrosis, and increased myofibroblast 
phenotype in lungs of antenatal Ureaplasma-infected animals compared to gestational 
controls or non-infected ventilated animals 64,74. In a study of rhesus macaques, 
histologic changes in the fet us’ lungs depended on the duration of intrauterine exposure 
to U. parvum  65. Infection exposure duration less than 136 h resulted in neutrophil 
infiltration without epi[INVESTIGATOR_196648]. With progressive duration of exposure there was an influx of neutrophils and macrophages, epi[INVESTIGATOR_668150], and type II cell proliferation.

Ureaplasma acts as a co-inflammatory stimulus by [CONTACT_668223], 
dysregulated inflammatory response to subsequent inflammatory insults such as 
hyperoxia and volutrauma. We propose that Ureaplasma  may contribute to lung 
injury and fibrosis by [CONTACT_668224].  
Potential role of AZI to prevent Ureaplasma -mediated neonatal lung injury : Despi[INVESTIGATOR_668151] [ADDRESS_902513] immunomodulatory effects, including effects on neutrophil 
function (e.g. chemotaxis, cell adhesion, oxidative burst, phagocytosis) and inhibition of 
release of cytokines involved in acute inflammation (e.g., IL -1ß, IL -8, TNF -alpha) 
77-79 
and chronic inflammation (IL-12p40) [ADDRESS_902514] 82. AZI inhibits neutrophil influx 
and chemoattractant/cytokine release in murine lung noninfectious 7,9, as well as 
pneumonia 8,[ADDRESS_902515] pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], AZI 
(10 mg/kg/d x 7d followed by 5 mg/kg/d up to 6 wks) did not reduce the incidence of BPD at 36 wk PMA 
89. In a follow -up larger trial, Ureaplasma clearance and BPD rates 
were similar in the placebo and AZI -treated groups 90. These results underscore the 
importance of performing appropriate PK/pharmacodynamic studies preparatory to phase II/III trials to assess microbiological and clinical efficacy of AZI. 
Safety and Tolerance of AZI in the Pediatric Population: The safety and tolerability 
of oral AZI has been evaluated in 3995 patients aged 2 to 94 91. The overall rate of side 
effects is 12% with gastrointestinal symptoms the most common. Ototoxicity, although 
rare, has been reported with IV AZI in adults and included reversible tinnitus and 
hearing loss 92. A review of 43 open label, randomized pediatric trials performed outside 
the US that included 2655 patients treated with a 3 day course (10 mg/kg once daily) oral AZI for upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_668152] 8.7% subjects, 
primarily gastrointestinal symptoms 
93. In a recent PK study of a single dose of IV AZI in 
[ADDRESS_902516] common treatment related symptom, reported in 25% pa tients.  
Association of AZI with infantile  hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: Although treatment 
with erythromycin in the first few months of life has been associated occasionally with 
the development of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) 93,94, a recent report of 
an analysis of  the association of prescriptions for oral azithromycin, erythromycin, or 
cephalexin during the first 90 days of life and diagnosis of pyloric stenosis (IHPS) in a 
retrospective cohort study of children born [ADDRESS_902517] 14 days of life
95. Of 1,074,236 infants reviewed, 2,466 developed IHPS in the  study period 
(2.29/1000). Of 4,875 infants prescribed oral azithromycin, 8 developed IHPS (1.64 per 1000). All 8 affected infants were male. The median number of days IHPS developed 
after AZI prescription was 29.5 d (9-45 d). The relative risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_668153] 90 days of life: 0.71 (95%CI 0.36 -1.43; P=0.34. The highest rate of 
IHPS occurred when AZI exposure was within the first 14 d of life (3/148 (2%); aOR 8.26; 95%CI 2.62 -26, P<0.01). In all cases, oral AZI was prescribed for treatment for 
Chlamydia conjunctivitis or pneumonia and treatment/prophylaxis against Bordetella pertussiss. Of note, in a separate report analyzing the association of prematurity and 
IHPS in the same cohort, there was an increase in IHPS for preterms 33 -37 weeks 
gestation, but not in preterms ≤[ADDRESS_902518] on intestinal motility in preterm infants <[ADDRESS_902519] intestinal function and risk for IHPS in the very preterm study population.  
Azithromycin and the risk of potentially fatal heart rhythms : Azithromycin is 
proarrhythmic with prior reports of occurrences of QT -interval prolongation, and 
torsades de pointes 98. Recently, a retrospective study of a large Tennessee Medicaid 
cohort detected a small absolute increased risk of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio, 
2.88; 95% CI, 1.79 -4.63) in adults who took a [ADDRESS_902520] among patients with a high baseline risk for cardiovascular disease.  
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 20 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  The FDA independently reviewed the study data and released a Drug Safety 
Communication on 3/12/2013 summarizing their findings and recommendations. The 
FDA noted important limitations of the study including 1) lack of randomization so 
patients who received different drugs might have differed in ways that biased the 
results; 2) study limited to patients treated as outpatients, so patients treated for severe 
or life-threatening infections were likely not included; 3) cardiovascular deaths were 
determined by [CONTACT_668225]; and 4) some 
limitations to the statistical methods. However, the FDA found that the overall finding of 
excess risk of cardiovascular death in the azithromycin treated patients was valid and 
that the excess risk of cardiovascular death, especially of sudden death, is consistent 
with arrhythmias from drug-related QT prolongation. In addition the FDA evaluated the 
results of a clinical QT study conducted by [CONTACT_668226]. In a randomized, placebo -controlled parallel 
trial, 116 healthy subjects received either chloroquine (1000 mg) alone or in combination with azithromycin (500 mg, 1000 mg, and 1500 mg once daily). In 
comparison to chloroquine alone, the maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) 
increases in QTcF were 5 (10) ms, 7 (12) ms and 9 (14) ms with the co-administration 
of 500 mg, 1000 mg, and 1500 mg azithromycin, respectively (see attached Drug label, 
p. 7), indicating that co-administration of azithromycin increases the QTc in a dose- and 
concentration-dependent manner. The FDA identified the following groups at higher risk 
of torsades de pointes and fatal arrhythmia:  
o Patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, a history o f torsades de 
pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, bradyarrhythmias, or uncompensated 
heart failure 
o Patients on drugs known to prolong the QT interval  
o Patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia 
or hypomagnesemia, clinic ally significant bradycardia, and in patients receiving 
Class IA (quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (dofetilide, amiodarone, stalol) antiarrhythmic agents 
 
The implications of this study for azithromycin use in newborns and children are 
unclear. There is a single case report in the literature of cardiac arrest with suspected 
prolonged QT in a 9 month old who inadvertently received 50 mg/kg azithromycin 
intravenously over [ADDRESS_902521] that infants presenting with a QTc<0.5 second 
normalize their QTc over time while infants with a QTc>0.6 second are at risk for severe 
arrhythmias and sudden cardiovascular death. Prolonged QTc  (>0.45 s) was no t 
detected in any of the 171 preterm infants screened for the 10 mg/kg and 20mg/kg single dose studies or any of the 192 infants screened for the  20 mg/kg x 3d multi-dose 
study.  
There are no known interactions of AZI with other drugs. The potential for th ese adverse 
outcomes will be carefully evaluated in our clinical trials of AZI in preterm infants.  
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic of single and multiple doses of AZI in 
preterm infants: 
We have completed a Phase I open-label, pharmacokinetic (PK) study characterizing 
the single dose PK, safety, tolerability, and biologic effects of 10 and 20 mg/kg IV AZI in 
mechanically ventilated 24-[ADDRESS_902522] colonization and BPD. A two-compartment structural 
model with the clearance and volume of peripheral compartment (V2) allometrically 
scaled on body weight best described the PK of AZI in preterm neonates. The single 10 
mg/kg and 20 mg/kg dose regimens were safe, but did not suppress pulmonary 
inflammatory responses. The 10 mg/kg single dose was insufficient to eradicate 
Ureaplasma, but there were no treatment failures in the 20 mg/kg group. 
Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that even mu ltiple dose administration of 10 mg/kg 
AZI would be inadequate to maintain AZI plasma concentrations above the Ureaplasma 
MIC 50, while multiple doses of 20 mg/kg might provide a favorable AUC 24/MIC [ADDRESS_902523] erizing the multiple dose PK, safety, 
and biologic effects of 20 mg/kg x3 days regimen. Fifteen subjects 24-28 wk gestation 
(7 of whom were Ureaplasma-positive pre-dose) were enrolled and received all [ADDRESS_902524] model to describe the PK parameters  of AZI in preterm 
infants based on 40 subjects (10 mg/kg single d ose (N=12); 20 mg/kg single dose 
(N=13); and 20 mg/kg multiple dose (N=15)) is the [ADDRESS_902525] variability is hi gh due to the small number of 
subjects in the multiple dose group.

wk followed by 1 or more negative cultures > 1 wk of age) rate of 25%. It is likely that persistently positive serial cultures represent true infection and/or ineffective immune 
response while transient detection represents colonization. To determine the 
microbiologic efficacy of IV azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma from the preterm 
lung, we will conduct a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled clinical 
trial of azithromycin 20 mg/kg x 3 days. This endpoint is important to plan for a Phase III 
clinical trial to determine if ureaplasmal eradication improves short -term (BPD) and 
long-term pulmonary outcomes.  
From 11/2013 to 12/2016, [ADDRESS_902529] been enrolled  in this Phase IIb trial. Initially,

4.3.1 Randomization procedure:  
There will be separate randomization schedules for each center . Infants will be 
randomized according to a permuted-block design to receive azithromycin or placebo. 
Twins will be randomized together to the same study arm. Randomization schedules 
prepared by [CONTACT_668229] (Seattle, WA) that will establish a web-based randomization 
site available 24 hours/day and seven days a week . Separate randomization schedules 
for each stratum within each clinical site will be prepared. The randomizations on the 
schedules will be in varying block sizes of two, four and six to force approximate 
balance of azithromycin and placebo treatment  assignments at each clinical site. The 
University of Maryland I nvestigational Drug Service (UMB Coordinating Pharmacy) will 
receive the randomization number assignments for each site to prepar e study drug 
shipments. The UMB Coordinating Pharmacy will ship to the study pharmacist at each 
site numbered study drug kits f or active drug and sealed envelopes each labeled with a 
site-specific randomization number and containing a label for “azithromycin” or “placebo”. Each randomization is documented for time of issue on the computer system 
and under whose user ID authority t he allocation is issued (i.e., who requested the 
randomization). Once a randomization number is assigned and study pharmacist is 
notified,  he/she will open the corresponding envelope, prepare  the appr opriate drug or 
placebo, and attach the label from the opened envelope on the drug accountability log . 
For study drug, one vial per dose will be reconstituted with D5W to final concentration of 
2 mg/ml. For placebo, an equivalent volume of D5W will be prepared.  Axio Research 
will cooperate with the UMB Coordinating Pharmacy in kit preparation, labeling and 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_668160]. In the event of 
enrollment of twins, the system will specify two numbers containing the same, blinded 
treatment. Axio Research randomization application will provide unbl inded reports to 
assist UMB Coordinating Pharmacy staff in maintaining appropriate levels of drug kits at each site. A customized web page will allow the unblinded pharmacist to indicate to the 
application which kits have been sent to and received by [CONTACT_145889] (i.e., available 
for dispensing at randomization).  
[ADDRESS_902539] selected a multiple dose for evaluation in this proposal based on the 
population PK model that includes the 10 mg/kg single dose (N=12) and 20 mg/kg 
single (N=13) and multiple dose  (N=15) PK, and the clinical experience in older children 
with respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014]. The PK properties of AZI support short courses of therapy. The drug has a long elimination half -life (>50 h), is concentrated in phagocytic 
cells with good tissue penetration, especially in lung, and persists in tissues for much 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study [ADDRESS_902540] that it is the 
AUC 24(u)/MIC [ADDRESS_902541] predictive of AZI efficacy 104. Increasing the dose is 
more effective than increasing duration of treatment for increasing the AUC 24/MIC [ADDRESS_902542] that increasing the 
dose early in the infectious process will result in clearance of even marginally 
susceptible organisms 105.  
Although optimal AUC 24(u)/MIC 90 ratios for AZI to eradicate other common organisms 
were reported to range from 0.5 to 14.8 h 106, the optimal AUC 24(u)/MIC 90 for AZI to 
effectively eradicate Ureaplasma is still unknown.  Based on our recent clinical study in 
preterm neonates, a dosage regimen of 20 mg/kg/d x 3d IV AZI was deemed safe and 
effective and resulted in an AUC 24(u)/MIC 90  ratio of 5.69 as indicated in Table 2.  
Table 2. AUC 24 and AUC 24/MIC [ADDRESS_902543] that an AUC
24(u)/MIC 90 ratio of > 5.69 h is needed 
in order for AZI dosage regimen to eradicate ureaplasma in preterm 
neonates. 
The data from the 20 mg/kg multiple dose 
Phase IIa study confirmed the simulations 
and Ureaplasma was eradicated from the 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_668161]-dose. The  proposed short course will 
reduce development of drug resistance and limit the risk for increased mortality 
and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) recently reported for preterm infants exposed to a prolonged duration of initial empi[INVESTIGATOR_668162] 
107. The 3 day 20 mg/kg oral 
AZI regimen is well tolerated in older children 93, and is more effective in treating 
recurrent or persistent otitis media than high dose amoxicillin -clavulanate 108 and group 
A streptococcal tonsillopharynigitis than 3 d 10 mg/kg dose oral AZI or [ADDRESS_902544] been obtained, study infants will receive according to randomization assignment, either 
azithromycin administered at a concentration of 2 mg/ml  in D5W or placebo of same 
volume D5W as a single intravenous infusion over 60  ± 5 min using a functioning 
intravenous line within 24 h of enrollment. The dose will be calculated as 20 mg/kg actual body weight. Each subject’s actual body weight at the time of study entry will be 
used for determining the injection volume of study drug.  For study drug, one vial per 
dose will be reconstituted with D5W to final concentration of 2 mg/ml. For placebo, an 
equivalent volume of D5W will be prepared.  A total of 3 doses will be administered at 24

5.1.4 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_668165] : Study drug administration will be delayed or 
discontinued if any subject has evidence of an arrhythmia on the cardiac monitor (they 
will all have continuous cardiopulmonary monitoring) or an ongoing proarrhythmic 
condition such as hypokalemia (serum potass ium < 3.5 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (serum 
potassium >6.5 mEq/L on non-hemolyzed specimen), hypomagnesemia (total serum Magnesium ≤ 1.6 mg/dL), hypocalcemia (ionized calcium < 3.0 mg/dL (<0.75 mmol/L)) 
or hypothermia (core temperature ≤ 35°C) until corrected by [CONTACT_192942].  
Infusion of study drug will be discontinued for any of the following changes in vital signs 
unless it can be remedied by a simple maneuver (e. g., correcting the patency of the 
airway, reestablishment of artificial airway, simple st imulation for apnea of prematurity, 
etc.): Decrease in BP that requires fluid bolus or pharmacologic support, or sustained 
HR less than [ADDRESS_902550] treatment assignment after reviewing the initial report or at the time of the monthly 
summary report.  A summary of cumulative serious adverse events by [CONTACT_668230].  The DSMB will 
meet to review safety data after 50% enrollment. The DSMB recommended that there 
be no pre-specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_17781], but rather agreed to review SAEs as 
they occur. The DSMB chair may call a DSMB meeting to specifically review safety 
concerns. The DSMB recommendations may include study termination, study 
continuation with protocol modifications (e.g.,  change in eligibility criteria), or temporary 
suspension of enrollment until further evaluation is completed. Per DSMB recommendations,  any death that occurs within [ADDRESS_902551] during the study drug infusion, the amount infused 
will be recorded and the remainder of study drug returned to the investigational study pharmacy.

5.2.1 Packaging and Formulation 
Azithromycin will be manufactured and packaged by [CONTACT_668231] (Schaumburg, IL) and shipped using appropriate clinical trial drug distribution 
procedures. Azithromycin for injection will be supplied in lyophilized form under a 
vacuum in a 10 ml vial equivalent to 500 mg of azithromyci n for intravenous 
administration. For study drug, one vial per dose will be reconstituted with D5W to final concentration of 2 mg/ml. An initial solution of 100 mg/ml azithromycin for injection will 
be prepared by [CONTACT_1583] 4.8 ml of sterile water for injecti on to the 500 mg vial and 
shaking the vial until all of the drug is dissolved. To provide the azithromycin in the final 
concentration of 2 mg/ml, 1 ml (100 mg) of the reconstituted drug will be transferred to a 
syringe containing 49 ml dextrose 5% injectio n and the syringe will be inverted several 
times to mix completely. When diluted in this manner, azithromycin for injection is stable for 24 hrs at or below room temperature (30°C or 86°F) or for 7 days, if stored under 
refrigeration (5°C or 41°F). Placebo will be an equal volume of D5W.   
5.2.2 Labeling  
Information presented in the label for study medication will comply with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_668166].  
5.2.3 Storage 
The reconstituted azithromycin will be stored in a refrigerator. The reconstituted drug is 
stable for 7 days if stored under refrigeration (5°C or 41°F). For the study, one vial per 
dose will be prepared. Vials of azithromycin or placebo will not be used if any particulate 
matter or discoloration is observed. Records of the actual storage conditions during the 
period of the study will be maintained.  
5.2.4 Preparation 
The azithromycin will be supplied in lyophilized form under a vacuum in a 10 ml vial equivalent to 500 mg of azithromycin for intravenous administration. Each vial also 
contains sodium hydroxide and citric acid.  To prepare each dose of azithromycin, using 
aseptic technique, 4.8 ml of sterile water for injection will be added to the 500 mg vial 
and mixed by [CONTACT_668232]. Each mL of reconstituted sol-
ution will contain 100 mg azithromycin. This solution is stable for 24 hours when stored below 30°C or 86°F. To provide azithromycin in the final concentration of 2 mg/ml, 1 ml 
of the 100 mg/ml azithromycin solution will  be added to 49 ml dextrose 5% injection ml 
of 5% dextrose in water in a syringe. The patient specific dose of azithromycin 2 mg/ml is drawn up and dispensed as a syringe to be inf used intravenously over 60± [ADDRESS_902552]’s weight is ≤ 0.94 kg, the dose may be ordered to the 1/10 of 1 ml using a 10 
ml syringe for administration with a syringe pump (example 0.94 kg x 10 ml/kg= 9.4 ml of 2 mg/ml azithromycin or equal volume of D5W). For subjects >0.[ADDRESS_902553] ml (example subject weight 1.23 kg x 10 ml/kg=12.3 ml, so 12 ml should be ordered).  For placebo, an equivalent volume of D5W will be administered  IV 
over 60±5 min. 
5.2.5 Supply and Return of Drug  
The University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) Investigational Drug Service will be Pharmacy Coordinating Center for the study. Azithromycin study drug kits will be 
packaged, labeled, and distributed to the study site pharmacies by [CONTACT_668233] [ADDRESS_902554]; 
each kit will have a unique number. At study initiation, and as needed thereafter, 
azithromycin kits will be shipped to a responsible person (e.g. pharmacist) at the 
Investigational Drug Service of each participating center, who will check the amount and 
condition of the study drug and enter this data into a Proof of Receipt form and 
Investigational Product Accountability Record (see next section). The Proof of Receipt 
form should then be faxed to the UMMC Coordinating Pharmacy. The Investigational 
Drug Pharmacy will record the final disposition of all study drug.

    30 Jan 2017  6.2 Description of Evaluations 
6.2.1  Screening Evaluation 
All infants admitted less than 72 h of age with gestational age 240 to 266 weeks gestation (after 
January 2016; 240-286 wk GA January 2016 or earlier) by [CONTACT_668234]. A QTc interval will be calculated from the lead II of the heart rate monitor either before 
consent procedure or after consent is obtained , but before any other study procedures commence. 
If the QTc is >[ADDRESS_902557] (CRF AZIP01) will be completed and entry added to a 
screening log with site-specific numeric patient identification number (PID) and letter code 
(LETCODE). The screening log with patient identifiers is maintained at each site in a secure 
location and is not submitted to the Data Coordinating C enter. 
6.2.2 Consenting Procedure 
If the answer to all inclusion criteria is yes and answer to all exclusion criteria is no, study 
personnel will approach parent(s) to discuss the research study and request informed consent. If a 
potential subject is eligible, but consent is not obtained, a reason (e.g . missed, maternal age <18, 
parent/LAR refused consent, non-English speaking parent/LAR) will be required on the submitted eligibility checklist CRF (AZIP01). If an infant qualifies, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_668167]. An EKG for QTc measurement will be 
obtained after consent if not done previously during the screening process.  If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_668168] a potential subject, he/she will not participate in the consen t 
discussion with the parents to avoid undue pressure on the parents to agree to the study. The 
information provided in the consent will cover the elements listed in the CFR Part 50.[ADDRESS_902558] (IRB). This incl udes the investigational nature and 
objectives of the trial; the procedures and treatments involved and their attendant risks, discomforts, and benefits; and the potential alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], alternative to not participate and 
right to withdraw without penalty will be explained. The study staff personnel will  offer to answer 
any questions.  
In the consent process, banking (storage) of Ureaplasma samples isolated from positive subjects 
will be explained to parents. They can decline banking of their child’s  specimens and still 
participate in this study. They can indicate on the consent form whether they would be willing or 
not to be contact[CONTACT_668235]’s banked specimens. For each question 
(banking vs no banking; future contact [CONTACT_668228] ), the parent will initial their choice.  
 If a parent consents to their child’s participation, the parent will sign and date the consent form. One copy of the signed consent form will be provided to the parents,  another copy will be placed in 
the child’s medical record and the original signed consent form will be kept in a secure file at each site. Written documentation of the consent process will be placed in the medical record. The 
subject will be assigned a study identification number. The study identifi cation number will be 
recorded on all study forms. (See Section 16.1 for model consent form). 
6.2.[ADDRESS_902559] meet all of the inclusion criteria to 
participate in this study. All screened infants meeting any of the exclusion criteria at baseline will 
be excluded from study participation.  
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 32 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  Specific inclusion criteria to be determined:  
 Gestational age 240-266 weeks (after January 2016; 240-286 wk GA January 2016 or earlier) 
by [CONTACT_668236]: Infant must be between [ADDRESS_902560] accurate estimate 
(date of intrauterine insemination > fetal ultrasound before the 14th week; fetal ultrasound at 
14 or more weeks (if no earlier ultrasounds) > last menstr ual period (LMP) without fetal 
ultrasound> gestational age by [CONTACT_668237].  
 Positive pressure ventilation for at least [ADDRESS_902561] 1 continuous hour. The criterion will be met if the hour of positive pressure is by [CONTACT_668238] (mechanical ventilation or nCPAP) or combination (e.g. 
intubation for exogenous sur factant administration followed by [CONTACT_668239]).  
 Presence of indwelling intravenous line for drug administ ration 
Specific exclusion criteria to be determined:  
 Any patient judged to be non-viable or for whom withdrawal of life support is planned . 
Viable, as it pertains to the neonate, means being able, after delivery, to survive (given the 
benefit of available medical therapy) to the point of independently maintaining heartbeat and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_557178] . Neonates for whom death is 
considered imminent or are unresponsive to medical cardio -respi[INVESTIGATOR_668169] (PaO
2<40), hypercarbia (PaCO 2>80) and acidosis (pH< 7.0) for >12 h 
will be considered non-viable for study criteria.  
 Major lethal congenital anomalies : Those anomalies that will likely result in death such as 
renal agenesis, pulmonary hypoplasia, cyanotic congenital heart disease.  
 Triplets or higher order multiples  are excluded 
 Patients delivered for maternal indications . Maternal indications include, but are not limited 
to pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, pulmonary hypertension, trauma, or malignancy.  Patients 
whose mothers have these conditions (e.g. pre -eclampsia, chronic hypertension), but are 
delivered for fetal indications such as pr eterm labor or premature preterm rupture of the 
membranes are eligible.  
 Patients with significant hepatic impairment (Direct Bilirubin >1.5 mg/dL):  A fractionated 
bilirubin should be obtained and documented in medical record prior to enrollment . If a 
fractionated bilirubin is not available during screening prior to consent, then informed parental consent can be obtained first and a fractionated bilirubin obtained prior to 
enrollment and randomization.  
  Exposure to other systemic macrolide: Prior exposure of the infant to systemic erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, other macrolides, or clinically ordered azithromycin is an exclusion criterion. Exposure to ophthalmologic erythromycin ointment is 
not considered a systemic exposure.  
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 33 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017   Participation in other clinical trials involving investigational products . Participation in other 
clinical trials of investigative drugs is an exclusion criterion. Participation in clinical research 
studies not involving investigational product is allowed.  
 EKC QTc ≥ 450 ms . Measure EKG QTc interval (See CRF AZIP 02): 
Calculation of EKG QTc (average 3 measurements):  
0. Print strip of lead II from potential subject monitor (paste copy to page)  
1. May calculate manually or use http://en.ecgpedia.org/wiki/QTc_Calculator  
2. Measure QT interval (duration from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of 
the T wave): count the number of small squares, then multiply by 0.04 seconds(s) x 
1000: ______ms  
3. Measure RR interval (interval from the peak of one R wave to next R wave peak), count the number of small squares, then multiply by 0.04 seconds(s):_______  
4. QTc= QT(ms)/√ RR (s) 
5. Is the Qtc ≥450 ms? ______Yes _______No 
The EKG can be completed during screening or after consent is obtained, but prior to any study procedures.  
6.3 Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization 
6.3.[ADDRESS_902562] dose of study drug should be initiated within 24 h of  obtaining informed 
consent. 
6.3.2 Baseline Assessments 
 Demographics, obstetric history, maternal macrolide exposure, neonatal characteristics including respi[INVESTIGATOR_668170]  
 Morbidities of prematurity:  Morbidities associated with prematurity are protocol-specified 
potential serious adverse events. These are events that are anticipated to occur in the preterm population even in the absence of drug exposure. All morbidities present from the 
time of birth up to the start of Study day 1 (first dose study drug infusion) will be recorded.  
 Clinical laboratory tests:
 Values for electrolytes, total/direct bilirubin, CBC with differen tial 
cell count, and platelets obtained within [ADDRESS_902563] dose will be recorded.  
 Physical examination: The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_668171]1572 form will complete the physical assessment and complete section on CRF AZIP 07.  
 Tracheal and nasopharyneal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026]: For subjects who are intubated at time of 
enrollment, 2 tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026] (first for cyt okine sample and second for Ureaplasma 
culture with separate suction catheters) will be obtained. The first NP sample will be 
obtained for culture at the time of first tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. At least [ADDRESS_902564] dose of study drug 
should be infused no later than 24 h after enrollment.  
6.3.4  Blinding  
The study pharmacists will be unblinded, but will no t reveal treatment assignment to study staff 
administering the study drug. In the (unexpected) event of a clinically ur gent reason for unblinding 
of a subject’s assignment , the clinical site investigator or any other individual will be directed in the 
kit instructions to contact (in order of preference) [CONTACT_299171], [CONTACT_668308], the UMB  Coordinating 
Pharmacy, or Axio Research to document the reasons for unblinding, assure that there is truly compelling cause to unblind, and obtain the treatment information which will be available from all 
four sources. Date and time of any unblinding as well as reasons for unblinding will be documented by [CONTACT_668240]. Because of the nature of azithromycin and the 
restriction of the patient  population to experienced NICUs, we expect that there will be few or no 
unblinding events in this study.  
6.3.5  Follow-up Visits 
A total of 3 doses of study drug will be administered at 24 ± 0.5 h intervals.  Follow -up tracheal/NP 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_668172] [ADDRESS_902565] dose and on postnatal day 21.  Safety and tolerance 
will include vital signs (temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure), frequency of apnea 
(cessation of breathing for > 20 seconds), frequency of bradycardia (heart rate < 80 beats per 
minute for > 10 sec), cardiac rhythm, pulse oximetry, clinical laboratory testing and Adverse Events (AE). Safety assessment for subject vital signs, frequency of apnea and bradycardia epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841],  
pulse oximetry, and cardiac  rhythm will be collected 1 and 4 h after the initiation of azithromycin 
infusion. On study day 3 (±1 d), 7 (± 2 d), 14 (± 2 d) and every 2 wks (± 2 d) until discharge,  
transfer, or [ADDRESS_902566], subjects will be assessed for morbidities 
associated with prematurity, and adverse events. Clinically relevant AEs that will be specifically 
evaluated include: local site reaction including phlebitis, gastrointestinal signs (abdominal 
distension, gastric aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026] , emesis, heme-positive stools), intestinal obstruction including 
radiographic-confirmed pyloric stenosis, culture-proven sepsis with other bacterial or nonbacterial pathogens, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and cardiac arrhythmias.
	We will also specifically 
record adverse events that may signal potential proarrhythmic effects in our study population such 
as sudden death, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and flutter, and seizures . A hearing 
screening test as part of clinical care will be performed before discharge. Electrocardiograms will 
be performed pre-dose in all subjects and post -dose if a cardiac arrhythmia is noted on the patient 
continuous monitor. Clinical laboratory testing (complete blood count with manual differential, 
electrolytes, liver function, and renal function) will be performed during the [ADDRESS_902567] dose, 
and study day 3 (±1 d), and 7 (± 2 d), 14 (± 3 d), and 28 (± 3 d). Blood draws for study only labs

(e.g., smoking) and infectious exposures and detailed interv al respi[INVESTIGATOR_668175]. Recurrent wheezing and chronic cough will be defined as occurring more than twice per week.  
 The ideal times of visits and points of reference for data collection on long term pulmonary outcomes are six months, one year and two years adjusted age. To assure that patient contact [CONTACT_668246], we have established contiguous windows 
for the three follow-up visits. The first of these follow-up visit windows extends from 
five months to nine months adjusted age with an ideal visit date at six months 
adjusted age; the second window from 10 months to 18 months with  an ideal visit 
date at 12 months; and the third from 19 months to 30 months with the ideal  date at 
24 months. Whenever within a data collection window the baby [CONTACT_668247], the information collected about the baby's pulmonary health on that day 
may be used in the data collection window. If a baby [CONTACT_668248] o nce within a data collection window, the data closest to the ideal date are the 
data to be used. For example if a baby [CONTACT_668249] 10 months and at 
13 months, the data on the baby's pulmonary health collected at the 13 -month visit 
are to be used for the 12-month visit. If data were not collected within a specified window but the baby [CONTACT_668250] a subsequent window, the data 
collected that day should be processed for the current window, and inquiry made as 
to the baby's pulmonary health at the ideal time of the window in which data were not 
previously collected. If the baby's family can supply answers in response to the 
inquiry, those data should be entered for baby's pulmonary questionnaire CRF at the 
time of the ideal visit date for which information had been missing previously. For 
example, if the first follow-up contact [INVESTIGATOR_8178] a baby [CONTACT_668251] 11 months adjusted 
age, the pulmonary health information collected about that day may be used for the 
12-month visit, and answers to questions about the baby's pulmonary health at six 
months adjusted age may be used  for late completion of the six-month visit 
information.

The safety and tolerability of oral azithromycin has been evaluated in 3995 patients aged 2 to 94 
91. The overall rate of side effects is 12% with gastrointestinal symptoms the most common. 
Ototoxicity, although rare, has been reported with IV azithromycin in adults and included reversible 
tinnitus  and hearing loss 92. A review of 43 open label, randomized pediatric trials performed 
outside the US that included 2655 patients treated with a 3 day course (10 mg/kg once daily) oral azithromycin for upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_668152] 8.7% subjects, 
primarily gastrointestinal symptoms 
93. In a recent pharmacokinetics study of a single dose of IV 
azithromycin in [ADDRESS_902586] common treatment related symptom, reported in 25% patients. Although 
treatment with erythromycin in the first few months of life has been associated occasionally with 
the development of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) 
94, recent retrospective studies of 
a large cohort suggest that there is an increased risk of IHPS in infants >32 weeks gestation exposed to oral azithromycin or erythromycin 
95,96. There was not an increases risk in preterm 
infants ≤32 weeks gestation.  
The macrolides are associated with prolongation of the Q -T interval that can lead to serious 
ventricular arrhythmias.  Recently, a retrospective study of a large Tennessee Medicaid cohort 
detected a small absolute increased risk of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.79 -
4.63) in adults who took a five day course of azithromycin compared to individuals who took no antibiotics 
98. There were [ADDRESS_902587] with s uspected prolonged QT in a 9 month old 
who inadvertently received 50 mg/kg azithromycin intravenously over [ADDRESS_902588] that infants presenting with a QTc<0.5 
second normalize their QTc over time while infants with a QTc>0.6 second are at risk for severe arrhythmias and sudden cardiovascular death. Prolonged QTc was not detected in any of the 171 
preterm infants we screened for the 10 mg/kg and 20mg/kg single dose studies. However, we will continue careful screening of potential subjects for prolonged QT interval in the current protocol  of 
multi-dose azithromycin. In consideration for safety, we will delay or discontinue study dosing if a ny 
subject has evidence of an arrhythmia on the cardiac monitor (they will all have continuous 
cardiopulmonary monitoring) or an ongoing proarrhythmic condition such as hypokalemia (serum 
potassium < 3.5 mEq/L), hyperkalemia (serum potassium >6.5 mEq/L on non-hemolyzed 
specimen), hypomagnesemia (total serum Magnesium ≤ 1.6 mg/dL), hypocalcemia (ionized

effects in our study population such as sudden death, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and flutter, and seizures.  
There are no known interactions of azithromycin with other drugs. The potential for these adverse outcomes will be carefully evaluated in the Phase IIb trial of azithromycin in preterm infants.  
Adverse events will be recorded on case report forms with spec ific focus on potential events with 
reported (expected) relationship to the drug (e.g. gastrointestinal symptoms, local IV site reactions, 
cardiac arrhythmias). Hearing loss will be assessed by a pre-discharge hearing screen. Clinical 
laboratory tests will be monitored throughout the first 28 d of the study.  On study day 3 (±1 d), 7 (± 
2 d), 14 (± 2 d) and every 2 wks (± 2 d) until discharge or transfer, subjects will be assessed for morbidities associated with prematurity, and adverse events.  Clinical laboratory testing (complete 
blood count with manual differential, electrolytes, liver function, and renal function) will be performed during the [ADDRESS_902589] dose, and study day 3 (±1 d), and 7 (± 2 d), 14 (± 3 d), and 28 (± 3 d).  
Cranial ultrasound and retinopathy of prematurity reports of all subjects will be reviewed for 
completeness and accuracy at the time of site visits  or will be provided to the data coordinating 
center upon request. Independent review of CUS images will be requested if differences are noted 
in these outcomes by [CONTACT_668255].

a. Adverse event : Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation in which a subject is given a pharmaceutical product; does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with such treatment, or  
b. Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal la boratory findings), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product; not necessarily related to the product.  
c. Change-from-baseline AEs can take 2 forms:  
i. Appearance of a new symptom or sign, or  
ii. Increased severity or frequency of an existing symptom or sign 
d. Severity assessment: Severity refers to the intensity of the event and is generally 
indicated as mild (Grade I), moderate (Grade II), severe (Grade III), or life-threatening 
(Grade IV). See appendices E and F, Neonatal Toxicity Tables for severity grading of 
common events and laboratory abnormalities. For events not listed, grading definitions are:  
i. Mild (Grade I): mild transient symptoms, only requiring monitoring or symptomatic treatment, and clinically significant 
ii. Moderate (Grade II): Moderate illness or condition which requires new or significantly altered specific therapy 
iii. Severe (Grade III): Severe illness or condition: unresponsive to medical therapy.

life-threatening metabolic or cardiovascular complications (such as circulatory 
failure, hemorrhage, sepsis); life-threatening physiological consequences; or 
need for intensive care or emergent invasive procedure (e.g. requires maj or 
surgery). 
e. Causality  refers to the likelihood and extent that the investigational agent being 
studied contributed to the development of an AE.  In making determination, consider 
temporal relationship to drug exposure, other possible exposures as etiology,  known 
effects of the investigational agent, anticipated ( expected) side effects derived from 
preclinical studies, and what is known about similar drugs (See drug insert).

    30 Jan 2017  f. Duration of event: Onset of signs and symptoms as well as resolution of the event 
should be recorded, typi[INVESTIGATOR_668178]. Capturing this  
information is also important. Changes in severity such as when an event improves from severe to mild should be recorded as separate events, with separate intensities 
and durations collected.  
g. Adverse reaction: Defined as an adverse event caused by a drug.  Therefore, 
adverse reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there are 
reasons to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
h. Suspected adverse reaction (21 CFR 312.32(a)): Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for whic h there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse event. A suspected adverse reac tion implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
i. Unexpected (21 CFR 312.32(a)): An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in  the investigator brochure (or drug insert) 
or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or 
elsewhere in the protocol. “Unexpected” als o refers to adverse events or suspected 
adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacologic properties of the drug, but 
are not specifically mentioned as occurring wi th the particular drug under 
investigation (e.g. adverse events associated with other macrolides, but not specifically azithromycin such as pyloric stenosis). In addition, adverse events that 
would be anticipated to occur as part of the disease process are  considered 
‘unexpected’ for the purposes of reporting because they would not be listed in the investigator brochure.  
j. Serious (21 CFR 312.32(a)): An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘serious’ if, in the view of either the investiga tor or sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or significant 
incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or import ant medical event that may, 
based on appropriate medical judgment, jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
the definition.  
k. Life-threatening (21 CFR 312.32(a)): An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘life-threatening if, in the view of the investigator or sponsor, its 
occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death . 
l. Morbidities Associated with Prematurity  
The population to be studied in this protocol is at high risk for morbidities associated with 
prematurity. Events listed below will, for the purposes of this clinical trial, be considered events

a. Reporting Procedures for all Adverse Events 
i. For adverse events that are level I or level II severity,  a separate CRF AE form will be 
submitted for each occurrence. All AEs that occur after the initial study drug administration until discharge or transfer will be reported. All submitted AEs will be 
tabulated and submitted to DSMB, FDA annual report, and to  each investigator for 
inclusion in annual reports to local IRBs.  
ii. A separate SAE form will be completed for each serious adverse event 
reported/observed until discharge or transfer. Each site investigator must report immediately (within 5 business days) to the sponsor (Viscardi) all serious adverse 
events, regardless of whether the investigator believes that they are drug related, 
including those events listed in the protocol as anticipated to occur in the preterm 
population independent of drug exposure (e.g. morbidities of prematurity), or in the drug 
insert as predicted to occur with the drug.

treatment assignment from the Data Coordinating Center  at the time of the initial report 
or will review treatment assignment in the monthly s afety reports of cumulative SAEs. 
Reports of deaths will be submitted to the DSMB chair with each occurrence.  
iv. FDA IND Safety Reports: 
a. Sponsor (Rose Viscardi, M.D.) must submit reports to FDA for those instances 
where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug 
and the adverse event  (i.e. adverse reaction of suspect ed adverse reaction). 
b. Reports may be submitted after  
1. a single occurrence because the event is uncommon, but is known to 
be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g. anaphylaxis, Stevens -
Johnson Syndrome) 
2. one or more occurrences: a single occurrence or a small number of 
occurrences of a SAE that is uncommon in the study population, but not 
commonly associated with drug exposure and event(s) occur in 
association with other factors strongly suggesting causation (e.g. strong 
temporal association).  
3. Aggregate analysis of specific events. Morbidities of prematurity are 
examples of protocol-specified serious adverse events. If the frequency 
of a specific SAE occurs in statistically greater frequency in the treatment then placebo arm and the events occur in association with 
other factors strongly suggesting causation (e.g. strong temporal association), a safety report will be submitted.  
c. Serious adverse event reports for any cases of NEC meeting criteria for seriousness (e.g., deaths, infants requiring intestinal r esection) will be reported 
to the FDA regardless of relationship to study drug as an IND safety report  no 
later than 15 days after the sponsor is informed of a NEC case that qualifies 
as serious. Fatal or life-threatening cases of NEC will be reported no later than 
7 days after the sponsor is notified. With these NEC SAE reports, the investigational site where the event occurred and the number of trial 
participants enrolled in the trial will be identified. If  available, the number of 
trial participants enrolled at the site where the SAE occurred will be provided.  
d. An expedited IND safety report will be submitted when any of the following 
criteria are met for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction: 
1. Suspected adverse reaction (reasonable possibilit y that the drug 
caused the adverse event)

We hypothesize that compared to placebo azithromycin 20 mg/kg x 3 days will improve survival 
without persistence of Ureaplasma in preterm infants with Ureaplasma respi[INVESTIGATOR_668180]. 
Primary Efficacy Variable: Survival without persistence of Ureaplasma respi[INVESTIGATOR_668181]: To determine the efficacy of the IV azithromycin to eradicate Ureaplasma respi[INVESTIGATOR_668182], all randomized infants will have follow-up cultures of TAs if still intubated or NP 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_668183] ([ADDRESS_902596] dose and 21 d of age). These 
samples will be frozen and shipped to UAB for analysis by [CONTACT_668259]. The MIC of 
azithromycin will be deter mined for each isolate. This will assess if Ureaplasma isolates develop 
azithromycin resistance over time or resistance varies among centers. Since Ureaplasma is only 
transmitted vertically, neonates who are positive by [CONTACT_668260] l be 
considered a colonized neonate. Although PCR may be more sensitive for detection of all Ureaplasma positive neonates, it does not distinguish between live and killed organisms . 
Therefore, we will define bac terial clearance as [ADDRESS_902597] -therapy.  
Secondary Efficacy Variables : 
Physiologic Test for BPD: Secondary outcomes will include the rate of physiologic defined BPD at 
36 wks PMA in placebo controls (Ureaplasma colonized, and non-colonized) and azithromycin responders (Ureaplasma eradicated) vs non-responders (persistent Ureaplasma). For the BPD 
endpoint, the recently reported physiologic definition of BPD based on oxygen -saturation 
monitoring will be used 
111. 
Additional secondary endpoints will include overall mortality, incidence of co -morbidities of 
prematurity such as intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalaci a, necrotizing 
enterocolitis, bacterial and fungal nosocomial infection, pulmonary air leak, patent ductus 
arteriosus, retinopathy of prematurity, number of days of positive pressure ventilation, number of 
days of oxygen supplementation, use of postnatal s teroids, and use of non-study antibiotics. The 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 48 of 70   Version 5 .0

2 Power if there was no correlation between twins.  
 Sample Size Considerations : We chose our sample size (30 Ureaplasma-colonized subjects  per 
group) in order to have good power to detect an eff ect of treatment on Ureaplasma respi[INVESTIGATOR_668184]. To calculate the power we will have, we simulated thousands of data sets under 
various assumptions about the rates of survival without persistence of Ureaplasma in the control 
and intervention groups. For each simulated data set, we calculated a Mantel -Haenszel Chi 
Square, and determined the proportion of data sets for which the p-value was less than .05.  These 
simulations were based on the assumption that 20% of  the infants were in twin pairs. Since twins 
will be randomized to the same treatment group, and assuming the outcomes in twins are positively correlated, the power of the study regarding the treatment effect is less than what it 
would be had all the infants in the stud y been singletons (independent). To assess the range of 
power, the power was calculated for the two extremes of perfect correlation between twins and no correlation between twins .  The actual correlation is likely to be between 0 and 1, so the actual 
power should be somewhere in between the limits as shown in Table 6. These power calculations also assume that 5% of the children will withdraw from the study before the endpoint is assessed.  
The actual power of  our study will be somewhat higher than in these simulations because  the 
actual analysis will glean information from both members of each twin pair using multiple outputation.   
Power calculations were performed assuming an 80% survival rate,  a 54% Ureaplasma 
colonization rate and a 25% rate of clearance among the placebo group to determine a  sample 
size as shown in Table 6. Assuming that survival and Ureaplasma clearance are independent 
outcomes and 25% of the infected children will spontaneously clear the infection, then the 
expected rate of survival without microbiological persistence of Ureaplasma in the absence of 
antibiotic therapy is 0.2 (0.8 x 0.25). In Table 6, we provide the power we will have to detect 
differences in survival without microbiological persistence of Ureaplasma between azithromycin 
and placebo groups wit h a sample of [ADDRESS_902600] the hypothesis of no difference in survival and 
Ureaplasma eradication between subjects randomly assigned to placebo versus IV azithromycin. 
All primary analyses will be carried out according to the principle of intention -to treat. If the null 
hypothesis is not rejected, 95% confidence intervals will be construct ed about the differences 
observed to demonstrate how large the differences could be in either direction.

completed. The DSMB will review each death occurrence. Cumulative  SAEs for each study arm

Analysis of Primary Outcome:  The primary outcome will be survival to discharge and eradication of 
Ureaplasma respi[INVESTIGATOR_668143]. The null hypothesis will be tested using the Mantel -
 
Phase IIb AZIP study [ADDRESS_902602] died will be counted as having adverse outcomes (i.e., as 
treatment failures) in the primary analysis. Death must be taken into account as an adverse 
outcome to avoid the possibility declar ing an advantage for a treatment that is associated with 
improved Ureaplasma clearance but also with greater mortality. In addition to calculating a p -value, 
we will use a Mantel-Haenszel Odds Ratio to estimate the size of the effect of treatment and 
calculate its variance (and corresponding confidence interval) based on the method of Robins et al. 
117. 
Although an issue not addressed in many neonatal clinical trials  118, one complication to the 
analysis is the fact that some of the children will be in twin sets.  This violates the assumption of 
independence required by [CONTACT_462637] -Haenszel approach.  To handle this complication, we will use 
the approach of “Multiple Outputation” 119. This approach was previously used to address this 
complication in the NO CLD study 24. This approach involves the random selection of one child 
from each twin pair. Then the analysis is performed only using the randomly selected single child 
from each set of twins. These steps (random selection and subsequent analysis) are repeated 
[ADDRESS_902603] for homogeneity of odds 
ratios will be used to assess if there is significant (at alpha = 0.05) evidence of differences in the 
effect of treatment according to stratum or clinical site. The proposed approach to interactions will 
maintain the overall alpha level for the primary outcome analysis at 0.05. If a clinical site interaction 
that is not consistent with an assumption of homogeneity of treatment effect is detected, the clinical 
site's performance and results will be reviewed to determine the nature of the differences in treatment effects. Significant differences in stratum or clinical site treatment effects will be reported.  
Secondary Analyses Including Subgroup Analyses : A similar approach (Mantel-Haenszel tests and 
estimation using multiple outputation) will be used to estimate the effect of the treatment on BPD 
rates. The BPD analysis will be done using all children (with and without Ureaplasma), and then 
separately in strata defined by [CONTACT_668261]. In the unlikely event that there are 
important imbalances between the randomly assigned treatmen ts in clinical or laboratory variables 
recorded (e.g., selected co-morbid states, concomitant medications), secondary analyses will be 
conducted using logistic regression to estimate treatment effects controlling for confounding 
factors. Model assumptions will be examined, and models will be tested for goodness of fit. If the 
assumptions required for a logistic regression model are rejected, alternate models will be explored. Again, the approach of multiple outputation will be used to obtain the final estim ates and 
their variance. 
Additional secondary analyses will assess the treatment effect on other outcome variables. 
Secondary outcomes to be considered include death which will be approached with survival 
analysis (time to event) methods; co-morbid outcomes which will be approached with logistic 
regression; number of days of treatment with positive pressure ventilation and number of days of 
oxygen supplementation which will be approached with rank or normal scores statistics to be able 
to assess outcomes with and without taking deaths into account.  
Pulmonary and Neurodevelopmental Outcomes Analysis : Given the duration of  follow -up required 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study [ADDRESS_902604] to the distribution of 6-month, 12 month , and 22-26 month pulmonary outcomes (number and duration of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], number of physician and emergency visits for respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375], frequency of 
pulmonary medication use, and parental report of recurrent wheezing or chronic cough).  Initially, 
these comparisons will be performed informally using side -by-side box plots and simple tables.  
More formal statistical analyses will be performed using the methods described for  the primary 
outcome.  Specifically, for binary outcomes (e.g., “ever hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]”), we will use Mantel-Haenszel 
methods, stratifying by [CONTACT_384].  If we need to control for confounding variables, we will analyze binary outcomes using logistic regression models including terms for center.  For quantitative 
outcomes we will use multiple regression mo dels including terms for center and potential 
confounders.  To assess whether observed associations with treatment group are mediated by [CONTACT_668262], we will also fit models including a term for persistent infection. 
Final inferential statistics will be based on analyses using multiple outputation methods described 
above to account for correlation within twins.  A similar approach for neurodevelopmental 
impairment at 22-26 months will be used to compare the difference for binary outcome  survival 
free of neurodevelopmental impairment.  
Pharmacokinetic Evaluation: The plasma concentration versus time data from the a) single 10 
mg/kg (N=12), b) single 20 mg/kg (N=13) and c) multiple 20 mg/kg (N=30) will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_668186]-effects modeling software, NONMEM. The first-order 
conditional estimation procedure (FOCE) will be used for the analysis. Open one -, two -, and three- 
compartment structural disposition models with first order elimination, as implemented in the  
PREDPP library of models provided in the NONMEM software, will be evaluated to fit the data. 
Previously, a two-compartment structural model with the clearance and volume of peripheral 
compartment (V2) allometrically scaled on body weight (WT) best describ ed the pharmacokinetics 
of i.v. azithromycin in preterm neonates. This model will be first used for the compi[INVESTIGATOR_668187] d ata 
analysis. The selection of the final base model will be determined by [CONTACT_668263] 
(AIC) and visual inspection of the goodness of fit scatter plots. The additive, proportional and 
exponential pharmaco-statistical models as well as a combination of the additive and proportional 
models will be evaluated to characterize the inter -individual variability and the residual ran dom 
variability. During the covariate model -building process, the stepwise forward inclusion procedure 
will be applied to  build the full model. The likelihood ratio test will be applied to discriminate the 
alternative nested models using the model selectio n criteria with a significance level of 0.05. 
Stepwise backward procedure will be applied to breakdown the full model to the final model with a 
stringent statistical criterion (p<0.01). The improvement in the diagnostic scatter plots (population 
predicted versus observed concentrations, individual predicted versus observed concentrations, 
weighted residuals versus time, weighted residuals ver sus population predicted concen trations and 
ETA plots) as well as the decrease in the inter -individual and residual variances will be used to 
evaluate the goodness of fit throughout the model building process. Potential covariates include 
birth weight, gestational age, gender, race, current weight, length, body surface area, postnatal 
age and post -menstrual age (gestational age plus postnatal age). Consolidating data from 55 
neonates [n=12 (single 10 mg/kg), n=1 3 (single 20 mg/kg) and n=30 (extending N for  multiple 20 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 52 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  mg/kg)] will allow better examination of the influence of these covariates on the PK of azithromycin. 
Any potential drug/drug interactions caused by [CONTACT_668264] 7 days prior to delivery (e.g., antenatal steroids, antibiotics, tocolytics) and to the subject from 
birth until 7 days (within the drug sampling period) post -azithromycin dosing (e.g., caffeine, 
diuretics, indomethacin, postnatal steroids) will also be examined. The final proposed PK model will be internally evaluated using posterior predictive check and simulating the data from which it 
was built. After the final model is developed, Bayesian estimates of the individual patients’ PK 
parameters will be calculated, including plasma clearance, volume of distribution, maximum 
plasma concentration (C 
max), time of C max (Tmax), area under the plasma concentration –time curve 
from zero to infinity (AUC 0-∞), the distribution rate constant, and elimination rate constant.  
Pharmacodynamics evaluation : Microbiological outcome will be classified as eradication or 
persistence of Ureaplasma respi[INVESTIGATOR_668143]. Eradication will be defined as all negative follow -up cultures and failure defined as the presence of one or more follow -up positive respi[INVESTIGATOR_668188]. Pharmacodynamic parameters of AUC
24/MIC 90, Cmax/MIC, and %T>MIC 
will be determined for Ureapalsma culture positive subjects. Classification and regression tree 
(CART) analysis will be applied to determine breakpoints of PD indexes, e.g. AUC/MIC, and their statistical significances will be validated by [CONTACT_3493]’ s exact test. Logistic regression analysis will be 
performed to determine the probability of clinical success or bacterial eradication based on the 
significant predictors, such as AUC/MIC, and T%>MIC, etc.  
10. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
10.1 Data Collection Forms  
Data Capture: Data capture includes all procedures required to incorporate study data into a 
central database. Data capture and management of high quality data are key responsibilities of [CONTACT_668309] and the Data Management Core. The gene ral principles that will be followed are: 1) 
continuous time windows to indicate ideal and permissible dates for follow -up visits; 2) permissible 
minimal and maximal time limits between specified data collection visits; 3) identical follow -up 
schedule for all treatment groups for measurement of variables used to assess outcome to avoid bias inherent in a schedule involving more frequent contact [CONTACT_668265]; 4) tested data collection forms; 5) document contacts of participa nts, record reasons for 
missed visits via use of a missed visit form; 6) trained and certified data collectors; and 7) appropriate audit trails for all changes to data forms. The study coordinators at each site who are 
blinded to study treatment assignment , will be responsible for completing the case report forms. All 
data recorded by [CONTACT_668266] a 
software application called Teleform (Cardiff, San Marcos, CA) that utilizes optical character 
recognition (OCR) and mark-sensitive technologies that allow data to be captured via electronic 
scanning rather than direct -keyed data entry. Teleform offers functions such as database 
validations, user-defined dictionary look ups, numeric range tests, dat a, currency and character-
specific formatting, as well as “Always review” and “Entry required” field designations. Once data 
are processed through the Teleform suite of programs, they are committed directly to the secure 
project database.  
Confidentiality  
Subject confidentiality will be maintained in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. Only the subject number and letter code will be recorded in the 
CRF. Study findings stored on a computer will be stored i n accordance with local data protection 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study [ADDRESS_902605] Access to Source Data/Documents 
The subjects’ parents/guardians will be told that representatives of the NICHD, IRB, or FDA may 
inspect their child’s medical records to veri fy the information collected, and that all personal 
information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in accordance 
with local data protection laws.  
1100..22  DDaattaa  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt    
Clinical site data collection 
Clinical sites will be responsible for accuracy and completeness of CRFs and submission of 
completed forms to the Clinical and Translational Research Informatics Center  within pre-specified 
windows. They will also be responsible for maintaining source documents and retention  of original 
CRFs securely at their site. They will respond to edit checks and submit corrections on CRF 
modification/update/deletion form. Sample case report forms are provided in Appendix F. 
Case Report Forms as Source Documents  
Study personnel trained in the proper completion of case report forms (CRFs) will record study data on the CRFs and all forms will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_668267]. In some instances data for which there is no prior written or electronic record wil l be 
recorded on CRFs and these will be considered source documents . This will be limited to the 
following CRFs: 
1. AZIP06 (Tracheal/NP Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_668189]-dose) 
2. AZIP07 (Physical Exam Study Day 1) 
3. AZIP08 (Drug Administration) (with supplementary attachments)  
4. AZIP09 (Vital Signs) 
5. AZIP13 (Pharmacokinetics Plasma Sample Collection)  
6. AZIP14 (Tracheal/NP Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_668190])  
7. AZIP15 (Adverse Events) (with supplementary attachments) 
8. AZIP16 (Serious Adverse Events) (with supplementary attachments)

15. AZIP23 (CRF Modification/Update/Deletion Request)  
 Clinical and Translational Research Informatics Center  
The CTRIC under the direction of [CONTACT_668310] will provide data management services for the study. They will develop the case report forms, data edit and audits, and prepare monthly 
performance reports.  
 
 
Phase IIb AZIP study 54 of 70   Version 5 .0 
    30 Jan 2017  Data confidentiality, security, and backup : All data collection instruments are designed by [CONTACT_668268].  Participant names 
and other directly identifiable information will not be captu red in the research database.  Each 
participant will be assigned a participant ID (PID) and a randomly generated alpha code at the 
initiation of screening.  These two identifiers will uniquely identify participants on all forms and only 
these identifiers will be used when communicating with clinical sites regarding data edits, data audits, and concerns regarding an individual participant. Study data will be stored in a suitably 
designed relational database housed on a password protected departmental server. A ccess to the 
database will be restricted to authorized personnel and require the user to enter an appropriately complex password that is changed on a regular basis.  Any modifications, updates or deletions will 
be implemented only by [CONTACT_253977], a nd only when the proper documentation has 
been provided by [CONTACT_978].  A record of each change to the database will be maintained in a 
transaction log to allow for recovery of the original data if needed. Incremental backups of the database are performed daily and the database in its entirety is backed up weekly and maintained 
on tapes that are moved to a fire-proof safe off location to guard against catastrophic loss.  These 
tapes are kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_902606] -protected computers.  
Quality assurance: As data are collected, validity and accuracy checks that will be pre -
programmed will be performed.  Post-capture validity checks may also be programmed to identify 
other data quality issues. Reports of missing forms will be produced, and percent of important 
variables missing will be counted.  Queries will be generated for resolution at the data collection 
point level.  There will be a timely flow of reported information so that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_668191].  
Data edits and audits: Edits are run on the database on a regular basis. Edits include checking for unusual or inconsistent values, as well as examining missing values.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_668192], complete 
the necessary Modification/ Update/ Deletion (MUD) Log, and respond regarding resolution of the 
edits. Items previously queried in the data editing process that are legitimate (e.g., missin g data 
from a previous visit that cannot be gathered at this point in time) are removed from future lists of data edits. Approximately 5% of the scanned forms are randomly selected and a list of requested 
forms is sent to the PI. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_668193]-scanning for comparison with 
the records in the existing database.  The forms are also examined for other problems (e.g., 
improper documentation of changes made on the form).  Discrepancies within the database must 
be resolved. 
Performance monitoring: The performance of the clinical sites is monitored via a variety of 
reports that are produced on a regular basis to assist the PI [INVESTIGATOR_668194], including information on what forms have bee n completed for each 
participant at each assessment time point, summaries of data edits and audits, the number of patients screened over time, the number of patients enrolled over time, and the timeliness of 
submitting forms for processing.  Reports will be stratified by [CONTACT_668269]/or important 
covariates as appropriate.  
 
Phase IIb AZIP study [ADDRESS_902607] site initiation visits to all additional sites to review the manual of procedures and sample collection techniques.  
For the neurodevelopmental assessments, a primary neurologic examiner will be identified who will certify annually and certify other examiners at their r espective sites. Training DVDs of neurologic 
exams to include normal neurologic exam, CP, GMFCS ≥ level 2, and neurodevelopmental impairment will be prepared and each primary examiner will score each exam independently and 
their inter-rater agreement with identified Gold Standard examiners will be determin ed. 
10.3.2  Quality Control Committee  
Drs. Viscardi and Terrin will review monthly performance reports for site -specific enrollment, CRF 
completion, data edits (number of error messages), sample collection, and protocol deviations. 
They will contact [CONTACT_668270]. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_902608] and all case report forms will be assessed for completion 
and accuracy. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_668195] 36 weeks PMA.  
10.3.4  Protocol Deviations 
Protocol violations may jeopardize the study by [CONTACT_668271]. Major violations are those that endanger patients, such as 
failure to adhere to appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria or undermine the conduct of the study 
such as failure to obtain blood and respi[INVESTIGATOR_668196]. Minor violat ions 
are those that impede the progress of the study, such as not completing CRFs in a timely fashion. If blood draws or tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_668197], an explanation 
will be documented. The principal investigator, site i nvestigators and coordinators will problem-
solve to limit future protocol violations. Protocol violations will be reported to the IRB and the DSMB.

You are being asked to allow your baby [CONTACT_668277] 
(prematurely). Your baby’s participation in this study is voluntary and you may ask questions at any time . If you are 
consenting for someone else - a child or someone unable to pro vide consent themselves - then the word “you” means 
that person . 
 
PURPOSE OF STUDY 
Approximately 54 % of babie s born very early (before the 27 th week of pregnancy)  have a lung infection with the 
bacteria Ureaplasma  urealyticum . This infection may lead to a chronic lung condition called Bronchopulmonary 
Dysplasia (BPD). There is no known effective treatment for this infection in preterm babies. Azithromycin is an antibiotic approved for use by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) to treat infections caused by [CONTACT_668278] , but has not been approved by [CONTACT_668279] . This research study i s being done as part of the FDA approval process for the use of azithromycin for this 
purpose. Azithromycin  has been shown to be effective against Ureaplasma  in test tube tests. By [CONTACT_668280] [ADDRESS_902633] effective to eliminate the Ureapla sma bacteria from the lungs of babies 
who had the infection. There were no side effects attributed to the antibiotic.  
Babies with and without the Ureaplasma  lung infection may participate in this study to evaluate azithromycin in 
preterm babies.  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether 3 doses of azithromycin 20 mg/kg daily based on body weight will 
effectively eliminate the Ureaplasma  bacteria from the lungs of babies who have the infection and to make sure 
azithromycin is safe in very pr eterm babies. To determine the effectiveness of azithromycin, this study will compare 
the active drug to a placebo. A placebo is an inactive substance made to look like an active medicine. Your child will 
either get the study drug, azithromycin or a placeb o. Researchers use a placebo to see if the study drug works better or 
is safer than not taking anything. In addition, the study will find out how [ADDRESS_902634] 
markers (indicators) of inflammation in the lung in all treated babi es. Finally, the study will find out how [ADDRESS_902635] lung health status at 6 months adjusted age (6 months plus number of weeks born 
early) , 12 months adjusted age (12 months plus number of weeks born early)  by a phone intervi ew and lung health and 
development status at 22 -26 months adjusted age (22- 26 months plus number of weeks born early) during a clinic visit . 
A total of 140 subjects at 7  medical centers will be asked to participate in this study. Your baby [CONTACT_668281] 40 subjects to be asked to participate at this location.  
The research will be conducted at the following location(s): University of Maryland Baltimore, University of Maryland 
Medical System,  and other sites.  
 
PROCEDURES 
This is a double- blind ed study, which means that neither you or the study doctor or the study staff will know which 
treatment you are receiving.  However, in an emergency, study doctor can get this information.  
If you agree to allow your baby [CONTACT_668282]. If you agree for your baby [CONTACT_668283], the following procedures will be performed. 
1) Nose or respi[INVESTIGATOR_668210] : The fluid from the baby's nose or respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] t ube will be tested for the Ureaplasma

Phase IIb AZIP study [ADDRESS_902640] common side effects reported in older childre n and adults treated with azithromycin are gastrointestinal 
symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (about 10%), pain at the injection site (6%), and less often vaginitis 
(vaginal discharge or infection), abdominal (belly) pain, loss of appetite, r ash, and itching. Fewer than [ADDRESS_902641] infection (thrush), headache, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], 
bronchospasm (temporary narrowing of airways into the lungs), and funny taste. In most cases these s ymptoms were 
mild. Rarely, heartbeat abnormalities, allergic reactions, pseudomembranous colitis (inflammatory condition of the large intestine due to imbalance of "good" and "bad" bacteria in the intestine) and reversible hearing loss have been 
reported. Blood tests for liver and kidney function were out of normal range for 6% or less in older children and adults 
treated with azithromycin. Low numbers of white blood cells (cells that fight infection) and platelets (cells that form 
blood clot) have occurred  in less than 1% of treated individuals. Laboratory blood tests went back to normal in other 
clinical trials of azithromcyin. Side effects seen  in infants  with oral (by [CONTACT_1966]) azithromycin and similar antibiotics  
include pyloric stenosis (narrowing of the stomach connection to the small intestine). Pyloric stenosis can lead to stomach blockage requiring s urgery to relieve the blockage.  Since azithromycin is an antibiotic, there is the risk of 
other bacteria that a re resistant to the antibiotic starting a new illness.  
There is a risk to confidentiality. This risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_668300]’s personal and medical information 
collected as part of this study in a secure location (locked file in the PI's of fice) and electronic data will be password

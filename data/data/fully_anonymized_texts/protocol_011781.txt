regulatory  authorit y.
Meningococcal B o
uter membrane v esicle (OMV) vaccines have been created, deve loped 
and used to control outbreaks of meni ngococcal B diseases in New Zealand, Norway  and 
Cuba. 
Studies suggested that OMV vaccines could potentially  protect against gonococcal 
infections in New Zealand and Norway .[ADDRESS_989043] of Bexse ro(4CMenB) on gonococcal infection in 
adolescents and young adults (2 studies in the [LOCATION_002] ( US), 1in Australia and 1in 
Italy). The vaccine coverage differed b y studies (69% in Australia, 33% in men who have sex 
with men ( MSM )living w ith h
uman i mmunodeficien cy virus ( HIV)in Italy  and 1.8% in 
[LOCATION_001] Cit y& Philadelphia. The direct effect of 4CMenB (vaccine effectiven ess) ranged 
from 32 to 74% for 2 full doses and 33 to 71% for at least 1dose.2-5
Abara et al studied the effectiveness of 4CMenB and factor H b
inding protein ( fHbp )
vaccines in 2separate studies using the same methodology  in [LOCATION_001] and Philadelphia 
regions for the period of 2016-2018 (t he first 2 years of meningococcal serogroup B [MenB] 
vaccines use in the US). The vaccine coverage was 7.4% and 1.6% for at least one dose for 
4CMenB and fHbp vaccines r espectively . The effectiveness of 4CMenB was 40% (95% CI 
23; 53) for full dose an d
26% (95% CI 12; 37) for only  1 dose. The effectiveness of fHbp 
vaccine was 3% (95%CI: +19; 21) .66These results were based on data during the period 
where fHbp had extremely  low vaccine coverage (<2%). 
Thevaccin
eeffectiveness for 4CMenB varied highly  according to study  types, age of the 
study  population and the vaccine coverage rate. T he vaccine coverage had increased to 
32% f or any MenB vaccines in 2021 while it was 14% and 17% in [ADDRESS_989044] of 1dose of Trumenba on gonococcal infection in adolescents 
and y oung adults of 15- 30 years in the U
Sat 12 months, 24 months, 36 months and 
48 months following the index vaccination .
9. RESEARCH METHODS 
9.1.Study Design
This is a retrospective cohort study  using health care administrative claims data as described 
in Section 9.4 Data Sources .
Adolescents and young adults approximately 15 to 30 y ears of age at their individual time 
zero (calculated based on birth y ear)
will be identified from administrative claims during 
01January  [ADDRESS_989045] 1 dose of MenACWY (Menactra®, Menveo®, or MenQuadfi®) prior to the 
Trumenba vaccination, between 01 January  2016 and 31 December 2021. The index date 
(zero time) for the exposed cohor tisthe last date of vaccination, and the cohort will be 
followed from 14 day s after vaccination to the end of the study  period (31 December 2022). 
The individuals in the cohort will be censored b y the event of interest , death date (if known), 
plan disenr ollment (if known) or the end of the study period , whichever comes first .

dose of MenACWY vaccine, but no doses 
of Trumemba during the observation period , received between 01January  2016 and 
31December 2021. The MenACWY -only vaccinated cohort is used as a reference cohort 
rather than an unvaccinated cohort in order to help control for theoretical differences in 
health seeking and risk behaviors between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals .The 
index da te (zero time) of the reference cohort is the last dose of MenACWY and these 
individuals will be followed from [ADDRESS_989047] occurrence of the 
following: outcome of interest, death date (if known), plan disenrollment (if known) or 
31December 2022 (end of study  period). 
The outcomes of interest are gonococcal and chlamy dial infections and only the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_724345].

9.4.Data Sources
Thedata for this retrospective secondary  data analy sis is a large third part y payerdatabase, 
the IQVIA PharMetrics Plus ([COMPANY_007] 03 April 2023 version). PharMetrics Plus is a health plan
claims database comprised of fully  adjudicated medical and pharmacy  claims for more than 
210 million unique enrollees since 2006. Data contributors to the database are largely  
commercial health plans. I t is representative of the commerciall y insured US na tional 
population for patients under 65 years of age. It contains a longitudinal view of inpatient and 
outpatient services, prescription and office/outpatient administered drugs, costs, and detailed 
enrollment information. All data are compliant to the Hea lth Insurance Portability  and 
Accountability  Act (HI PAA) to protect patient privacy . The database is used in a variet y of 
life sciences and commercial effectiveness studies. Over [ADDRESS_989051]

Page 18of 229.6.Data Management 
This study will use sec ondar y data collected in the PharM etrics Plus database, which is 
de-identified and HI PAA compliant. The data will be made accessible only  to individuals 
working on the current study . No attempt will be made to identify  individual patients, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], or phy sicians. Analy ses will be conducted using Statistical Analy sis Sy stem ( SAS)
9.4 (SAS I nstitute, Cary , NC). 
The anal ytic files will include p erson -level data, including information on baseline 
demographic and clinical characteristics, s tudy outcomes, and vacci nation information as 
described in the v ariable section above . Data for this study  will be processed and managed by  
[CONTACT_4618], I nc., and all analyses will be performe
dby [CONTACT_4618] .
9.7.Data Analysis 
The zero time is the date of Trumenba vaccination for the exposed group and the date of
MenACWY for the unexposed group . We will assess gonococcal infections that occurred 
between i) 14 day s after zero time and 365 day s ii) 14 day s after zero time and 730 day s, iii) 
14 day s after zero time and 1095 days, and iv) 14 days
after zero time and till end of the 
study  period (31Dec 2022). We will censor the data in the event of interest ,death date (if 
known), plan disenrollment (if known), target end date, or the end of the study period, 
whichever comes first. In descrip tive an alyses, we will fit Kaplan -Meier curves. We will also 
create unadjusted and covariate adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models 
verify ing first that the proportionality  assumption was satisfied for all independent variables. 
Hazard ratios ( HRs) will be estimated b y exponentiation of the coefficient for the vaccine 
variable in these models, with vaccine effectiveness estimated as (1 –HR)×100%. SEs for the 
coefficients will be used to estimate p values and CI s for the HRs. If a covariate does not
satisfy the assumption of proportionality , we will exclude the variable for the multivariable 
model and will perform the stratified analy sis using the covariate. 
Detailed methodology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of data collected in this study  
will 
bedocumented in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be dated, filed and maintained 
by [CONTACT_4618] . The SAP may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; any  major modifications 
of primary  endpoint definitions or their analy ses would be reflect ed in a protocol amendment.
9.8.Quality Control
Only  observed data will be used in measuring study  variables. It is anticipated that 
demographic information will be available for nearly  all individuals in the study  population. 
All other variables will be defined b ased on the presence of specific data (eg, diagnosis, 
procedure, and drug codes) in the anal ytic file; the absence of such data will be assumed to 
indicate the absence of the characteristic/event captured by  [CONTACT_491514].

11.MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS/ADVERSE 
REACTIONS 
This study  involves data that exist as structured data by [CONTACT_724351] y start.
In these data sources, individual patient data are not retrieved or validated, and it is not 
possible to link (ie, identify  a potential association between) a particular product and medical 
event for an y individ ual. Thus, the minimum criteria for reporting an adverse event (AE) 
(ie,identifiable patient, identifiable reporter, a suspect product, and event) cannot be met.
12.PLANS FOR DISSEMINATING AND COMMUNICATING STUDY RESULTS
Formal communication of the results o fthisresearch will be done b y [COMPANY_007] authors through 
peer-reviewed publication s. For all publications relating to the Study ,[COMPANY_007] will comply with 
recognized ethical standards concerning publications and authorship, including Section II -
“Ethical Consi derat ions in the Conduct and Reporting of Research” of the Uniform 
Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, 
http://www.icmje.org/index.html#authorship, established by [CONTACT_26399].
In the even tof any prohibition or restriction imposed (eg, clinical hold) by [CONTACT_220009] y in any area of the world, or if party responsible for collecting data from 
the participant is aware of an y new information which might influence the evalua tion of the 
benefits and risks of a [COMPANY_007] product , [COMPANY_007] should be informed immediately .

[ADDRESS_159440] array of lubricating eyedrops available on the market that can confuse and frustrate consumers. Many consumers view these the various products as “all the same” and often do not base their purchase on science or their doctor’s recommendation, but a variety of other factors including cost, store merchandising, and a potential view that all products are the same.   However, even products that list the same active ingredient can have vastly different inactive ingredients resulting in a potentially different outcome for the patient. For example, Walgreen’s Lubricant Balance eyedrop and Alcon’s Systane Complete Multi-Dose Preservative Free (PF) eyedrop has the same active ingredient (0.6% propylene glycol), however, Walgreen’s Lubricant Balance eyedrop is preserved in benzalkonium chloride (BAK), a known cause of ocular dryness and corneal and conjunctival staining.1 To date, there is little data comparing the clinical outcomes between these two eyedrops.   The purpose of this study is to compare dry eye symptoms as well as corneal and conjunctival staining of Systane Complete Multi-Dose PF, versus the Walgreen’s Lubricant Balance eye drop. 6.  OBJECTIVE(S) To compare dry eye symptoms as well as corneal and conjunctival staining of Systane Complete Multi-Dose PF, versus the Walgreen’s Lubricant Balance eye drop. 7.  SUBJECTS 7.1. Subject Population  Eligible test subjects will be 18-[ADDRESS_159441] mild to moderate symptoms of dry eye as defined by a screening SANDE score of 20 to 55 inclusive (equivalent to OSDI score of 12 to 32).[ADDRESS_159442] meet the inclusion criteria. Prior to enrollment, subjects will be provided information on the study and asked to sign a patient information and consent form to participate. The patient information and consent form will be approved by [CONTACT_140284]. 7.2. Inclusion Criteria Subjects are eligible for the study if they meet the following criteria: Note: Ocular criteria must be met in both eyes. • Subjects who currently have mild to moderate symptoms of dry eye as defined by a screening SANDE score of 20-55 inclusive (equivalent to OSDI score of 12 -32).2 • Subjects between the ages of 18-65. 
Performance of Preservative Free Drops vs Drops with a Preservative Page 7 of 20 v 1.0  6 Dec 2023  • Subjects willing to comply with the prescribed regimen and schedule of eye drops. • Subjects willing to attend all study visits. • Subjects willing to discontinue any current artificial tear use [ADDRESS_159443] should not be enrolled in the study. • Ocular anterior segment infection, inflammation, abnormality, or active disease. • History of herpetic keratitis or ocular surgery. • Recent (within 1 year) thermal meibomian gland expression procedure including Lipi[CONTACT_1603], iLux, or TearCare. • Recent (within 1 year) blepharitis debridement procedure including BlephEx. • Screening SANDE score > 55 (equivalent to OSDI score of >32).2 This is indicative of a severe dry eye. • Screening SANDE score < 20 (equivalent to OSDI score of <12).2 This is indicative of a clinically normal eye. • Screening non-invasive TBUT < 2 seconds, or > 10 seconds.3 • Screening NaFl score < 3 (clinically normal eye) or > 10 (severe dry eye).4 • Pregnant or lactating. • Current use of contact [CONTACT_13276]. • Any change in eye drop regimen, whether OTC or RX in the last [ADDRESS_159444] on the stability of refractions and visual acuity. As such, subjects who become pregnant during the study will not be discontinued but their data may be excluded from analyses of effectiveness. 8.  STUDY DESIGN 8.1. Study Design  Single site, prospective, double-masked, randomized-controlled, two-arm study of the dry eye symptoms as well as corneal and conjunctival staining in subjects using 2 different eyedrops. Subjects will be assessed at a screening visit, and 2 follow-up visits. Clinical evaluations will include patient questionnaire, tear-breakup time, and slit lamp exam.  The primary outcome measure is Dry eye symptom frequency and severity as measured by [CONTACT_140282] 2 weeks of QID use.  Exploratory outcome measures are as follows: 
Performance of Preservative Free Drops vs Drops with a Preservative Page 8 of 20 v 1.0  6 Dec 2023  • Comparing corneal and conjunctival staining before and after 2 weeks of QID use of their assigned drop. • Comparing Non-invasive TBUT times of the subjects in the two arms of the study, before and after 2 weeks of QID use of their assigned drop.  • Dry eye symptom frequency and severity as measured by [CONTACT_140283] 1 week of QID use. 8.2. Methods Used to Minimize Bias  Patient selection will be based on the patient’s interest and the optometrist’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_140279] a suitable candidate for eyedrops. Subjects will be randomized to treatment groups.   All data collection will be completed through provided Case Report Forms (CRFs) or computer files generated by [CONTACT_140285]. All site personnel involved in the study will be trained in regard to conducting study-specific procedures. 8.3. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Arms Subjects will be assigned to Systane Complete Multi-Dose PF or the Walgreen’s Lubricant Balance treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio using the method of randomly permuted blocks.  9.  STUDY PROCEDURE  9.1. Informed Consent / Subject enrollment  No subject will be enrolled into the study who does not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and does not sign the current approved informed consent document. Informed consent will be obtained prior to collecting any data for the study. The original signed documents will be maintained by [CONTACT_1694] a permanent part of the subject's medical records. A signed copy will be provided to the subject.  9.2. Visits and Examinations  Subjects will participate in 3 study visits. Visits will include an uptake visit and 2 follow up visits (Visit numbers 1-3 below).  The visit schedule, complete with window and associated CRF forms, are displayed in Table 9.2-1.  Details of each study visit, including testing to be conducted, are provided below.

Recruitment  At the recruitment visit, subjects will be consented, qualified for the study (compared with inclusion/exclusion criteria), and assigned a study ID/subject number.  Subject numbers will be assigned sequentially at each site in the order of enrollment.   A medical history will be taken and exams will include the tests described below: § slit lamp exam including evaluation of staining, § non-invasive tear breakup time, § SANDE questionnaire. In addition, all site-specific, routine, usual standard of care measures should be undertaken.    Measurements should be made as described in section 9.3 below.   9.2.2. Follow-Up Visit 1  Exams will include the tests described below: § SANDE questionnaire, § compliance check. In addition, all site-specific, routine, usual standard of care measures should be undertaken.    Any adverse events/serious adverse events (AEs/ SAEs) occurring during surgery will be noted at this visit. Any other problems during surgery and comments regarding surgery will be documented.   9.2.3. Follow-Up Visit 2  Exams will include the tests described below: § slit lamp exam including evaluation of staining, § non-invasive tear breakup time, 
Performance of Preservative Free Drops vs Drops with a Preservative Page 10 of 20 v 1.0  6 Dec 2023  § SANDE questionnaire, § compliance check. In addition, all site-specific, routine, usual standard of care measures should be undertaken.    Any adverse events/serious adverse events (AEs/ SAEs) occurring during surgery will be noted at this visit. Any other problems during surgery and comments regarding surgery will be documented.   9.2.4. Exit Procedures In the event of premature exit from the study, all study related examinations should be completed where possible. The Exit CRF should be completed, noting that the subject did not complete the study and the reason for premature study exit.  If no premature exit from the study occurs, the Exit CRF should be completed at the end of Visit 3.   9.3. Study Methods and Measurements All routine testing and basic eye examinations should be carried out at each study visit.  Abnormalities should be recorded in the CRF “Comment” section.  Specific study examination procedures are outlined below.    9.3.1. Non-Invasive Tear Breakup Time Non-invasive TBUT determined using the Topcon CA-800.  Subject will be instructed to blink [ADDRESS_159445] is being performed.  Three (3) consecutive readings will be taken, and the average will be recorded in seconds.  The Topcon CA-800 measuring is not able to be customized via software settings so the factory setting will be used.  Both eyes will be tested, but for the purposes of this study only a single, randomly selected eye will be used for statistical analysis.   9.3.2. Staining Baseline corneal and conjunctival staining with sodium fluorescein and Wratten filter assessed OU using the Academy of Ophthalmology 5 quadrant scheme.  Each quadrant will be graded (0-3) giving a total score of 0-[ADDRESS_159446] an exit visit or who come into the office to be exited prior to the scheduled final study visit. Subjects may be discontinued from the study at any time if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], their continued participation in the study poses a risk to their health. The reasons for discontinuation include: a. Adverse event; b. Lost to follow-up; c. Subject decision unrelated to an adverse event; d. Protocol violation; e. Treatment failure; f. Other. To ensure the safety of all subjects who discontinue prior to Visit 3, investigators should assess each subject and, if necessary, advise them of any therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265]/or medical procedures that might be needed to maintain their health. Any changes in medical health and/or use of concomitant medications should also be captured. 10.  ANALYSIS PLAN 10.1. Analysis Data Sets All subjects who are enrolled in the study will be evaluated for safety.  Efficacy analyses will be performed based on data from those eyes that complete the study.   10.2. Statistical Methodology Analysis will be done on the per protocol population. For monocular outcomes, analysis will be performed on the study eye that was determined by [CONTACT_17628].   Superiority of Systane COMPLETE relative to Walgreens will be established if the mean SANDE score is significantly lower in the Systane COMPLETE group vs. Walgreens group.   Demographics, baseline characteristics, efficacy endpoints, and adverse events will be summarized descriptively. Summaries of these variables will include sample size, as well as the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum.    Primary Endpoint: Dry eye symptom frequency and severity as measured by [CONTACT_140282] 2 weeks of QID use (subject level). Total scores will be compared using a two-sample t-test.  The step-down methodology will be used on the other endpoints in the following order: 
Performance of Preservative Free Drops vs Drops with a Preservative Page 12 of 20 v 1.0  6 Dec 2023  § Comparing corneal and conjunctival staining in the study eye before and after 2 weeks of QID use of their assigned drop (eye level). The corneal and conjunctival staining scores will be totaled from the [ADDRESS_159447]. § Comparing Non-invasive TBUT times of the study eye in the two arms of the study, before and after 2 weeks of QID use of their assigned drop (eye level). Time will be compared using a two-sample t-test. § Dry eye symptom frequency and severity as measured by [CONTACT_140283] 1 week of QID use (subject level). Total scores will be compared using a two-sample t-test. 10.3. General Statistical Considerations The statistical analyses will be performed using R, version 4.2.2 or higher.  Any statistical tests of hypotheses will employ a level of significance of alpha=0.05. 11.  SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION Assuming a difference in means between groups of 7 (SANDE) and a pooled standard deviation of 6, the study would require a sample size of 16 subjects for each group (total sample size of 32 subjects) to achieve a power of 90% and a level significance of 5%. To increase the study power and account for dropout, the sample size is being increased to  70 subjects (35 in each arm) to thoroughly characterize the performance of the drops. 12. CONFIDENTIALITY/PUBLICATION OF THE STUDY The existence of this Study is confidential and should not be discussed with persons outside of the Study. Results will be submitted for publication and presentation at national and/or international meetings. A manuscript will be submitted to peer-review journals for publication but there is no guarantee of acceptance.  All study data will be collected on appropriate Case Report Forms (CRFs). No protected health information will be included on the forms. CRFs will be retained in the patient’s file for a minimum period of [ADDRESS_159448] access to your study records:   •    Study Doctor and staff involved with the study  •    Study Monitor or Auditor  •    Sponsor Company or Research Institution  •    Review boards or accrediting agencies  •    Other State or Federal Regulatory Agencies  
Performance of Preservative Free Drops vs Drops with a Preservative Page [ADDRESS_159449] any adverse event is included on each case report form. 13.1. General Information An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who is administered. a study treatment regardless of whether or not the event has a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the study treatment, whether or not related to the treatment. In clinical studies, an AE can include an untoward medical occurrence occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 13.2. Monitoring for Adverse Events At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention any problems, the Investigator should inquire about AEs by [CONTACT_140286].  13.3. Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs Subsequent to signing an informed consent form, all untoward medical occurrences that occur during the course of the study must be documented on an Adverse Event Form (AEF). A separate AEF must be filled out for each event. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be documented as one comprehensive event. For each recorded event, the AE documentation must include the onset date, outcome, resolution date (if event is resolved), intensity (i.e., severity), any action with study treatment taken as a result of the event, and an assessment of the adverse event’s relationship to the study treatment. Nonserious Adverse Events A nonserious AE is defined as any untoward change in a subject's medical health that does not meet serious criteria noted below (e.g., is not life-threatening, does not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], does not prolong a current hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], is not disabling, etc.). All adverse events must be reported regardless of whether or not they are related to the study treatment.  For nonserious adverse events, an AEF containing all available information will be collected on a routine basis and submitted to the Medical Monitor at the close of the study.   Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any adverse experience that meets any of the following criteria: • Results in death. • Is life-threatening. 
Performance of Preservative Free Drops vs Drops with a Preservative Page 14 of 20 v 1.0  6 Dec 2023  NOTE: Life-threatening means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form. • Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. NOTE: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140280]/or treatment (usually involving an overnight stay) that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or an out-patient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred, the event should be considered serious. • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, or accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. • Is an important medical event. An important medical event is an event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124495], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. All available information on a serious adverse event(s) and any other associated AE, if applicable, must be forwarded to the study coordinator for forwarding to the Medical Monitor immediately (i.e., within one working day of the Investigator’s or site’s knowledge of the event) as follows: o In studies utilizing EDC (electronic data capture), all available information for the SAE and any associated AE(s) must be entered immediately into the EDC system.  o Additional information for any applicable event is to be reported as soon as it becomes available.  In addition to the reporting of serious adverse events to the study Medical Monitor, the SAE must be reported to the IRB / IEC according to their requirements.  The investigator must document all adverse device events (serious and nonserious but related) and all serious adverse events (related and unrelated) on the Adverse Device Effect and Serious Adverse Event Form. Any device quality complaints will also be documented.   
Performance of Preservative Free Drops vs Drops with a Preservative Page 15 of 20 v 1.0  6 Dec 2023  • Both the Quality Complaint Form and the Adverse Device Effect and Serious Adverse Event Form must be e-mailed immediately to the study coordinator. • Additional relevant information is to be reported as soon as it becomes available.    Study coordinator contact [CONTACT_76533].  Table 13.3.-1:  Contact [CONTACT_140287] e-mail 24-hour  Office Phone Leslie Shan [PHONE_3147] [EMAIL_2888] [PHONE_3147]  Further, depending upon the nature of the adverse event (serious or nonserious) or quality complaint being reported, the study sponsor may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_13271]’s medical records.  The investigator must also report all adverse events and quality complaints according to the relevant IRB requirements.  12.3.[ADDRESS_159450] assess the causality as Related or Not Related to the medical device under investigation. An assessment of causality will also be performed by [CONTACT_140288], as shown below:  Causality Related An adverse event or quality complaint classified as related may be either definitely related or possibly related where a direct cause and effect relationship with the medical device has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event or quality complaint was caused by [CONTACT_140289].   Not Related An adverse event or quality complaint classified as not related may either be definitely unrelated or simply unlikely to be related (i.e., there are other more likely causes for the adverse event or quality complaint).  Where appropriate, the investigator must assess the intensity (severity) of the adverse event as mild, moderate, or severe based on medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:   Intensity (Severity) 
Performance of Preservative Free Drops vs Drops with a Preservative Page [ADDRESS_159451]’s usual activities. Severe An adverse event is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the subject’s inability to work or engage in their usual activities.  The investigator must document any action taken (i.e., medication, intervention, or treatment plan) and outcome of the adverse event or quality complaint when applicable. 13.4. Follow-Up of Adverse Events and Quality Complaints The investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow-up procedures are maintained after the study.  Any additional data from these follow-up procedures must be documented and available to the study coordinator who, with the Medical Monitor, will determine when the data need to be documented on the CRFs.  13.5. Safety Analyses The type, severity, duration, and frequency of reported ocular adverse events will be tabulated.  Adverse events will also be summarized for events that were considered treatment-related.   14. GCP, ICH and ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS This study will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), including International Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines, and in general, consistent with the [ADDRESS_159452] regulations.  The investigator will obtain appropriate IRB/ethics committee approval prior to initiating the study.  The study will be registered with clinicaltrials.gov.  14.1 Confidentiality The data collected will be data typi[INVESTIGATOR_140281](s) when performed on eyes outside the study. Any data collected will become part of the patient’s clinical record. The data will be subject to the same privacy and confidentiality as other data in the clinical record.  
Performance of Preservative Free Drops vs Drops with a Preservative Page [ADDRESS_159453] access to the data collected. All data shared outside the practice will be de-identified; patients’ protected health information will not be available and will not be reported in any analyses or publications.

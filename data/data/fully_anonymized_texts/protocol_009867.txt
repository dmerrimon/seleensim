Version One /  Oct 201 7 INTRODUCTION /BACKGROUND : 
Research thus far demonstrates that both etomidate and ketamine are safe and effective for 
rapid sequence intubation  (RSI) in the emergent setting.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_774766], etomidate usage continues to far surpass that of ketamine. Both et omidate and 
ketamine are FDA -approved for induction of anesthesia. They are both ideal drugs for 
intubation due to their pharmacokinetic properties including a quick onset of less than [ADDRESS_1064163] 
of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, resulting in inhibition of excitatory stimuli. Etomidate 
lacks analgesic effects and has been shown to cause adrenal suppression, of which the long 
term significance still remains uncertain. Ketamine is a non -competitive N -methyl -D-aspartate 
(NMDA) antagonist and a weak opi[INVESTIGATOR_774767].  It is also a dissociative anesthetic and can cause profound hal lucinations.  There are 
also historical reports of ketamine causing an elevation of ICP, although newer research has not 
shown that effect.  Due to all of these factors and limited data to support ketamine as an equal 
or superior alternative to etomidate, it has been difficult to clearly recommend one agent over 
the other for RSI.  
 
Previous literature has evaluated the hemodynamic effects of etomidate and ketamine during 
RSI but these studies have been retrospective in nature.    
 
A [ADDRESS_1064164] -RSI with etomidate among the trauma and elderly population.  This study was 
limited by [CONTACT_774776].   
 
A 2017, retrospective study was published with 968 adult  trauma patients undergoing RSI in the 
ED with either etomidate or ketamine and results did not reveal a difference in patient -
centered outcomes between the two drugs including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], ICU -free days, 
ventilator -free days, vasopressor -free days,  and transfusion requirements.   
 
A prospective, randomized trial is needed to determine the superiority of one induction agent 
over another during this life saving measure.

AIM(S) OF STUDY:  
The aim of this study is to investigate the hemodynamic effects of ketamine and etomidate in 
the setting of rapid sequence intubation.  
 
OBJECTIVES:  
The objective of this study is to determine if ketamine or etomidate has a better hemodynamic 
profile in patients undergoing rapid sequence intubation.  
 
HYPOTHESIS:  
Primary Hypothesis:  
Compared to etomidate, k etamine will show an improved hemodynamic profile in patients 
undergoing rapid sequence intubation.  
 
STUDY DESIGN:  
This study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial evaluating the hemodynamic 
response  in adult patients (greater than or equal to 18 years of age) undergoing rapid sequence 
intubation (RSI).   
 
STUDY SETTING:  
This study will be a single -center study to include pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_774768] (NHRMC) emerg ency transport service providers as well as 
emergency medical physicians performing RSI at the NHRMC emergency department located 
on the main hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94685].  
 
STUDY POPULATION:  
Adult patients age [ADDRESS_1064165] 200 patients in 
the ED settings, with 100 having etomidate an d 100 having ketamine.  In the pre hospi[INVESTIGATOR_774769] 100 having etomidate and 100 having ketamine.  
 
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:  
Inclusion Criteria:  
Adult patients age 18 and greater who require RSI for any indication . 
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Children under the age of [ADDRESS_1064166] of 
ketamine or etomidate during RSI.

Version One /  Oct [ADDRESS_1064167] of 
ketamine or etomidate during RSI . 
3. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to ketamine or etomidate will not be 
administered that respective agent and will not be crossed over into the opposite group.  
 
STUDY OUTCOMES:  
Primary Outcomes:  
The primary outcome will be the incidence of post RSI h ypotension between patients 
undergoing RSI with ketamine versus patients undergoing RSI with etomidate.  Post RSI 
hypotension will be defined as a 20% decrease in the systolic blood pressure from a patient’s 
baseline.  
 
Secondary Outcome(s):  
Secondary outco mes will include: incidence of first pass intubation success, incidence of 
supplemental blood pressure agents (e.g. vasopressors) required post -RSI, time to additional 
sedative use  
 
STUDY PROCEDURES:  
Recruitment of participants:  
Patients who require rapid sequence intubation are critically ill and are not capable of making 
medical decisions at the time of the procedure.  During these critical moments, surrogate 
decision makers are rarely, if ever present and this procedure is performed as a life -saving 
meas ure to allow for further medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Informed consent of the patient nor a 
surrogate decision maker is possible at the time of the procedure.  
 
Randomization:  
Randomization will be assigned by [CONTACT_774777], with etomidate being  
administered to all RSI patients on even calendar days and ketamine being administered to all 
RSI patient on odd calendar days.   
 
Study Procedure:  
Etomidate will be dosed at a standard 0.3 mg/kg and ketamine will be dosed at a standard 2 
mg/kg for the pu rposes of this study.  Data will be collected from the pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_774770] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_774771].  Data 
extracted from each record will include ketamine or etomidate dosages and time of delivery, 
sets of vital signs prior to and post -intubation, number of intubation attempts, number of lost 
airways, dose and timing of any additional medications,  requir ement for additional fluid or 
blood product administration,  indication for advanced airway placement, admitting service, lab 
data, past medical history, and standard patient demographics.  The hemodynamic response 
will be measured by [CONTACT_774778] 5 of 6 
Version One /  Oct 201 7 until an additional sedative medication is administered.  (Please separate sheet that will be 
placed in RedCap once  IRB approval has been obtained).  
 
Ketamine and etomidate are immediately availavle for RSI in the pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_774772].  
 
Data Storage : 
All data will be kept in the secure databas e RedCap.  Only study staff will have access to the 
database.  
 
Safety considerations/Patient safety:  
Etomidate and ketamine are both frequently used in the pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_774773].  Etomidate has described adverse 
reactions to include adrenal suppression, pain at the injection site, nausea and vomiting, and 
nystagmus.  Ketamine has described adverse reactions to include confusion/delirium, 
hallucinations, vivid imagery, bradycardia, increased blood  pressure, nausea and vomiting, pain 
at the injection site, laryngospasm and nystagmus.  These adverse reactions have not precluded 
use in routine clinical care.  If a patient has a known hypersensitivity or allergy to either 
medication, they will not be g iven that medication.  
 
 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS:  
Sample size and statistical power:   To maintain 80% power with a probability of 0.05, [ADDRESS_1064168] at 25% difference in SBP (baseline to post drug 
administration effects)  
 
Statistical methods:  
Data will be analyzed using SPSS with a p -value of less than 0.05 being considered significant.  
We will consider a  20% decrease in systolic BP from a patients baseline as significant, and will 
compare the incidence of post RSI hypotension between the two groups.  Several a prior 
subgroups will be evaluated to include patients greater than 70 years of age, trauma patie nts 
requiring RSI, and those patients whose shock index is less than 0.9 versus those whose shock 
index is greater than 0.9.  
 
OUTCOMES AND SIGNIFICANCE:  
The results from this  study will help elucidate a sedative agent that is most appropriate in 
unstable p atients across a sepctrum of clinical scenarios to include cardiac dysfunction, severe 
sepsis with septic shock, trauma and the elderly.

Title of Study:  
A PHASE 1B DOSE -ESCALATION AND PHASE 2A STUDY OF TRC105 IN COMBINATION 
WITH PAZOPANIB IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED SOFT TISSUE SARCOMA 
Study center(s): This study will be performed at approximately 9 US centers (sites to be 
determined).  
Investigators: To be  determined  
Studied period (years):  
Date first patient enrolled: Oc t 2013

1b/2a  
 
Rationale:  
Pazopanib is an oral inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial 
growth factor receptor VEGFR -1, VEGFR -2, and VEGFR -[ADDRESS_55313] from VEGFR.  
TRC105 inhibits angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastases in preclinical models and complements 
the activity of bevacizumab and multi -kinase inhibitors that target the VEGFR.  In a phase 1 study of 
advanced solid tumors, TRC105 therapy caused a global reduction in angiogenic biomarkers and reduced tumor burden at doses that were well -tolerated.  In a phase 1b study, the combination of 
TRC105 and bevacizumab produced radiographic reductions in tumor volume in bevacizumab -
refracto ry patients, and was well tolerated. TRC105 potentiates bevacizumab and VEGFR tyrosine 
kinases (VEGFR TKI) in preclinical models.  By [CONTACT_24096] a non -VEGF pathway  that is upregulated 
following VEGF inhibition, TRC105 has the potential to complement VEGF R TKIs and could 
represent a major advance in cancer therapy.  Together, the use of TRC105 with pazopanib may 
result in more effective angiogenesis inhibition and improved clinical efficacy over that seen with 
pazopanib alone.  In the phase 1b portion of the s tudy, TRC105 at its recommended phase 2 dose of 
10 mg/kg given by [CONTACT_52291] 800 mg 
p.o. once daily .  Interim data from the Phase 1b/[ADDRESS_55314]  patient with cutaneous angiosarcoma treated in the phase 2 portion had a 25% reduction in the 
size of metastatic disease.

Methodology:  
Phase 1 b: 
This is a multicenter, open -label, nonrandomized, phase 1b, dose -finding study of TRC105 in 
combination with standard dose pazopanib in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma.  Escalating 
doses of i.v. TRC105 will be administered weekly or every two weeks beginning with Dose Level 1 
in combination with oral pazopanib given as 800 mg p.o. once daily.  Intermediate TRC105 doses (below the MTD established during the trial) may be explored based upon clinic al, PK , and/or 
biomarker data .

two week dosing MTD has not been exceeded . 
 
In dose levels - 1, 1, 2 and E xpanded C ohort  1, patients will receive 800 mg of pazopanib daily p.o. in 
cycle 1 for two to four weeks prior to the initial dose of TRC105 on cycle  2 day 1 .  Dose reductions 
of pazopanib are allowed during this two to four week period of dosing based on individual patient

 weeks ( i.e., from cycle 2 day 1 through cycle 2 day 28 ).  At least 6 patients will be treated at the 
every two week dosing MTD (or top dose level if a MTD is not determined) . 
Three patients will be initially enrolled and treated at each dose level.  If none of these 3 patients 
experiences a dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) during the 28 -day DLT evaluation period, dose escalation 
will proceed following review of safety data with site staff including the principal investigators at all sites.  
If 1 of 3 patients experiences DLT, the dose level will be expanded to 6 patients.  The maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) will have been exceeded if ≥ 33% of patients experience DLT at a given dose 
level.  DLT will have occurred when a patient has [ADDRESS_55320] possibly rel ated to the combination of pazopanib and TRC105 during the 28 day DLT 
evaluation period.  Patients who exit the study for reasons other than DLT or any TRC105 dose delay 
>2 days in cycle 2 prior to completion of the 28- day DLT evaluation period will be rep laced  to ensure 
an adequate safety assessment in each cohort . Patients who experience DLT who receive less than the 
prescribed dose of TRC105 or pazopanib due to documented toxicity during the DLT evaluation 
period will be considered evaluable for dose esc alation purposes.  A given TRC105 dose level may be 
reenrolled at > 50% of the pazopanib dose intensity upon agreement of study investigators .

Dose modification is allowed  base d on patient tolerability . 
Duration of treatment:  
Patients are eligible for treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of 
consent, or other reasons.  A patient should be withdrawn from study treatment if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15960], it is medically necessary, or if it is the wish of the patient.  In addition, patients will 
be withdrawn from treatment in the case of:  
1. RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_55341] cannot be applied, 
progression should be  based on unequivocal evidence of progressive disease sufficient to 
require a change in therapy.  In the angiosarcoma cohort  1, disease progression for 
withdrawal refers to disease progression while receiving TRC105 plus pazopanib combination therapy.  
2. A need for surgery, radiation, or for other anticancer therapy not specified in the protocol.  
3. Unable to tolerate pazopanib during cycle 1 (phase 1b dose levels -1, 1, 2 and E xpanded 
Cohort 1 only) . 
4. Lost to follow -up or noncompliant.  
5. Any TRC105 dose delay > 2 days between cycle 2 day 1 and cycle 2 day 28 (phase 1b 
only). 
6. Pregnancy.  Pregnant patients should be followed for the duration of the pregnancy and 
the outcome of the pregnancy should be documented.

ischemia/infarction, or peripheral or visceral arterial ischemia) or grade 3 or 4 venous 
thrombosis (including pulmonary embolism).   
8. Missed study drug treatment for > 8 consecutive weeks (i.e., both TRC105 and pazopanib 
dosing held). However, patients who cannot tolerate pazopanib or TRC105 therapy and 
who demonstrate a response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) with the combination and are thought to benefit from continued single agent 
therapy may continue on study on TRC105  or pazopanib  alone.  
Parameters to be assessed:  
Safety :  
Safety assessments will include physical exams, performance status, laboratory results (complete 
blood counts and serum chemistry) and 12 -lead ECG’s, and additional studies as clinically indicated.

 A formally chartered Safety Review Team will review safet y data.  In addition, recurring 
teleconferences will be held with Investigators at all clinical sites.   
Pharmacokinetics : 
Serum TRC105 concentrations will be measured using validated methods at the time  points specified 
in the Schedule of Events.  
Immunoge nicity: 
Anti-product antibodies  will be measured using validated methods at time points specified in the 
Schedule of Events.  
Exploratory Biomarkers:  
Concentrations of a panel of angiogenic protein biomarkers in plasma will be measured at baseline 
and during treatment to explore TRC105 pharmacodynamics. 
Efficacy : 
RECIST 1.1 will be applied to measurable disease to assess response and progression.  Tumor markers will also be evaluated where available.   
Archival Tumor Specimens:  
Endoglin expression on archival tumor specimens will be correlated with effica cy endpoints  (e.g.,

The study population for safety and efficacy includes all patients receiving at least a portion of 1 dose of TRC105.  
The number of patients to be enrolled in this study will depend upon the observed safety profile, 
which will determine the number of patients per dose level and the number of dose escalations.  It is 
anticipated that a total of up to 30 patients will be tr eated in the phase 1b portion and 89 patients will 
be treated in the phase 2 portion.  
Phase 1:  
The probability of escalation to the next higher dose for each underlying true DLT rate is shown in 
the table below.  For example, for a toxicity that occurs in  5% of patients, there is a > 95% probability 
of escalating.  Conversely, for a common toxicity that occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is < 5%.

Phase 2:  
Primary analysis:  
The primary analysis will test the null hypothesis that the median PFS is equal to 4.6 months.  The 
time-to-event distribution for PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and the analysis 
will be based on the two- sided 90% confidence interval for the median (equivalent to the use of a 
one-sided test at the alpha=0.05 level of significance).   
An additional phase 2 cohort  of up to 13 patients with ang iosarcoma will be enrolled  (angiosarcoma  
cohort 1) .  Assuming a 15% response rate by [CONTACT_52294], 5 responders  with 
TRC105 alone will provide >90% confidence that the true response rate is >15% .  
A second  additional phase 2 cohort of up to 13 patients with ang iosarcoma  will be enrolled  
(angiosarcoma cohort 2) .  Assuming a 15% response rate by [CONTACT_52294], 5 
responders  with TRC105 in combination with pazopanib will provide >90% confidence that the true 
response rate is >15% .  
 
Sample size justification:  
Assuming a true median PFS of 4.[ADDRESS_55343] at the alpha=0.05 level of significance, a sample size of 63 
patients will provide 86% power to detect a 50% increase in  the median PFS (i.e., a median of 6.9 
months).  For the angiosarcoma cohort s, the two -sided exact 90% binomial with 5 of 13 responders is 
16.57% and 64.52%.

 2. BACKGROUND  
2.1. Angiogenesis and Cancer   
Angiogenesis is required for the survival and growth of solid cancers [ 2, 3].  It is generally 
accepted that solid cancers have  two phases, an avascular phase and a vascular phase [ 3].  During 
the initial avascular phase, tumors exist as small aggregates of malignant cells supported by 
[CONTACT_28100].  The progressive growth of solid cancers beyond 
clinically occult sizes require s the continuous formation of new blood vessels, a process known 
as tumor angiogenesis.  Tumor growth and metastasis require angiogenesis.  Therefore, 
inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and selective inhibition of the tumor vasculature represent 
potentially effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of solid cancers.   
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_28085].  First, except for female reproduction and wound heal ing, 
angiogenesis in adults is generally part of a pathologic process such as tumor growth or 
choroidal neovascularization.  Second, treatments that interrupt tumor angiogenesis should apply 
broadly to all solid cancers.  Third, angiogenic targets are pres ent in the plasma or on endothelial 
cells themselves.  These targets are readily accessible to antibody treatments, in contrast to 
targets expressed within tumors that are more difficult for antibodies to access.  Fourth, 
angiogenic targets on vascular end othelial cells are less prone to genetic mutation than targets 
expressed by [CONTACT_28162].  As a result, development of resistance may be 
more predictable for agents that target endothelial cell functions than for those targeting cancer  
cells.  
Indeed, agents that target pathways required for tumor angiogenesis have an important role in the therapy of cancer patients.  The monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, which binds to the 
angiogenic cytokine VEGF, significantly prolongs overall survival  for patients with advanced 
colorectal cancer or non -small cell lung cancer when added to standard chemotherapy regimens 
[4, 5].  Bevacizumab is also effective therapy for renal cell cancer  and malignant glioma [ 6-8].  
Orally available small molecule VEGF inhibitors  include sunitinib, sorafenib , pazopanib, and 
axitinib which  have been shown to prolong survival in patients with metastatic renal cell c ancer, 
hepatocellular cancer, colorectal cancer, and sarcoma [ 9-12].    
2.1.1. Angiogenesis and Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma  
Sarcomas are rare tumors that originate from mesenchymal tissues (e.g., bone, cartilage, fat and 
muscle ).  In the [LOCATION_002], the incidence of bone and soft tissue sarcomas is approximately 
13,000 new cases per year, leading to more than 5,000 deaths  annually  [13].  According to the 
WHO classification of 2002, over [ADDRESS_55354] been described [ 14].  
Localized tumors are curable but patients with metastatic disease have a median survival of 
approximately [ADDRESS_55355] systemic chemotherapy regimens are poorly tolerated and of 
limited usefulness with response rates in the range of 10- 40% [15].    
Recently, the VEGFR TKI pazopanib was approved in patients with advanced soft tissue 
sarcoma who have received prior chemother apy.  Pazopanib improved progression free survival 
in chemotherapy refractory patients compared to placebo (PFS of 4.6 months with pazopanib versus 1.6 months with placebo) and was generally well tolerated, with the most common

 adverse events seen at highe r levels than in patients treated with placebo being fatigue,  diarrhea, 
nausea, weight decreased and hypertension.   
The short time to progression following pazopanib treatment emphasizes that s arcoma is a 
disease in need of more effective and well  tolerate d treatment options .  CD105 (endoglin) is a 
membrane receptor expressed by [CONTACT_52295] a suitable target for the treatment of sarcoma.    
CD105 is a marker of mesenchymal stem  cells, the normal cell type from which sarcomas 
originate  [16, 17] .  CD105- expressing sarcomas are relatively frequent and express CD105 at 
higher density than carcinoma cell lines.  In one r eport, high surface expression of CD105 by 
[CONTACT_52296] 7 of 8 sarcoma cell lines and only 4 of 16 carcinoma cell 
lines  [18].  Moreover, the level of CD105 expression correlated with proliferative capacity, and 
the addition of neutralizing anti -CD105 antibodies reversed the increase in proli feration.  
CD105 expression in human sarcoma tumor tissue has been reported by [CONTACT_52297].  Gromova et al found CD105 on 26 of 49 human gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and 
higher expression correlated with more aggressive tumors and high risk di sease [ 19]. They 
concluded that CD105 des erves consideration as a target for therapy of GIST.  CD105 
expression on Ewing’s sarcoma has also been reported, and high expression correlates with poor survival.  Moreover, CD105 knockdown reversed the increased tumor cell plasticity, 
invasiveness, and anchorage independent growth associated with CD105 expression [ 20].  Other 
CD105- expressing sarcomas identified in the literatu re include angiosarcoma, osteosarcoma, 
leiomyosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma  (undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma) , 
Kaposi’s sarcoma, Wilms tumor, and chondrosarcoma  [21-25]. 
In addition to endothelial cells and sarcoma cells, CD105 is found on the surface of benign 
stromal cells present in sarcomatous tumors.  Morozov et al identified a CD105- positive 
sarcoma- derived benign mesenchymal stromal cell (SDBMSC) present in primary sarcoma 
cultures  [23].  These cells express pericyte markers and cooperate with endothelial cells in 
vascular tube formation assays. In coculture experiments, SDBMSCs as well as normal CD105-
positive human pericytes markedly stimulated the growth of sarcoma cell lines.   
2.1.2. CD105 and Angiogenesis  
CD105 (endogli n) is a homodimeric cell membrane glycoprotein that was initially identified as a 
human leukemia -associated antigen [ 26] and later also found on endothelial cells [ 27, 28] .  
CD105 is  a TGF -β coreceptor that is essential for angiogenesis [ 29, 30]  and CD105 is strongly 
expressed on the proliferating vascular endothelium of solid tumors [ 28, 31 ].  All of these 
properties make CD105 an attractive target for the antiangiogenic therapy of cancer [ 32].  
Vascular targeted therapy may more effectively address large established tumors than 
conventional antiangiogenic therapy such as anti -VEGF therapy [ 33].  In animal models, CD105 
targeted therapy has demonstrated both vascular targeting effects and antiangiogenic effects by 
[CONTACT_52298] [ 28, 34- 37]. Therefore, CD105 offers a novel alternative 
target relative to the VEGF inhibitors currently available for antiangiogenesis therapy.   
CD105 acts to modulate signaling of multiple kinase receptor complexes of the TGF -β 
superfamily, including TGF -β receptors, activin receptor -like kinases (ALKs) and activin

 recept ors [38].  In the absence of CD105, activation of TGF -β receptors results in 
phosphorylation of SMAD proteins that inhibit endothelial cell growth.  However, activation of 
CD105 by [CONTACT_4722] -β modulates SMAD prote in phosphorylation.  The end result is release of the 
growth inhibitory effects of TGF -β receptor activation on endotheli um.  Not surprisingly, 
prevention of CD105 activation by [CONTACT_14181] -CD105 antibody acts synergistically with TGF -β to 
inhibit endothelial cell g rowth [ 39].  Similarly, CD105 acts in concert with the bone 
morphogenic protein (BMP) receptor to phosphorylate SMAD 1 and 5 in response to binding 
BMP 9 and 10, t o activ ate endothelium  [40]. 
CD105 expression is required for endothelial cell proliferation , and CD105 is upregulated in the 
setting of  hypoxia through the induction of hypoxia -inducible factor -1-α (HIF -1-α) [41, 42] .  
CD105 has also been shown to protect hypoxic cell s from apoptosis [ 43].  The expression of 
CD105 by [CONTACT_52299].  Targeted inactivation (knockout) of murine CD105 results in defective vascular development.  M ice 
lacking CD105 die in utero from defective vascular dev elopment by [CONTACT_28104] 11 [ 30].   
CD105 is critical for normal human bl ood vessel development [ 44].  CD105 haplotype 
insufficiency causes a well -described syndrome known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 
type 1 (HHT -1 or Osler -Weber -Rendu Syndrome).  HHT -1 is a rare autosomal dominant genetic 
disorder characterized by [CONTACT_28105], buccal, gastrointestinal mucosa and skin microvasculature.  Angiodysplasia also occurs in vessels from internal organs including the lungs, liver and brain [ 45].  The genotype is manifested in utero, but the phenotype 
does not become apparent for many years following birth.  Affected patients commonly present 
with epi[INVESTIGATOR_28055].  The phenotype of this disorder is limited to vascular effects, indicating the specific role of CD105 in the vasculature [ 46].   
CD105 is highly expressed on the proliferating endothelial cells of tumor vessels  including lung, 
breast, colorectal, gastric, liver, endometrial, renal cell , head and neck, and ovarian cancer s.  In 
adults, CD105 expression is limited to vascular endothelial cells and proerythroblasts, a red 
blood cell precursor [ 47].   
CD105 expression is a  prognostic factor in solid tumor patients .  High  microvessel density of 
CD105- positive vessels has been correlated with poor prognosis in clinical studies of  breast 
cancer  [48, 49] , lung cancer  [50], prostate cancer  [51, 52] , colorectal cancer [ 53, 54] , ovarian 
cancer  [55, 56] , gastric cancer [ 57], endometria l cancer [ 58], astrocytic brain tumors [ 59], 
hepatocellular carcinoma [60], esophageal adenocarcinoma [ 61], and head and neck cancer [ 62, 
63].   
Plasma CD105 levels are prognostic in retrospective studies of cancer patients.  In one study, the 
mean plasma CD105 concentration in 76 patients with colorectal cancer was 4 -fold higher  than 
the mean value in  40 healthy subjects without cancer [ 53].  In the study, a positive correlation 
was observed between plasma CD105 concentration and stage of disease.   
Importantly, CD105 expression is upregulated in tumor endotheli al cells  following inhibition of 
the VEGF pathway.  CD105 expression increased more than 2- fold in human pancreatic cancers 
grown in mice treated with an antibody that binds VEGF [ 64].  As well, treatment of human 
bladder cancers grown in mice with an antibody that blocks activation of the VEGF receptor 
increased CD105 expression within the core tumor vasculature [ 65].

 TRC105 is a novel IgG1 that binds CD105 with high avidity.  Recent studies at Duke University 
explored the in vitro  effects of dual angiogenesis inhi bition using bevacizumab and TRC105 in 
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).  Combination therapy was found to be more potent in decreasing HUVEC proliferation, migration, and tubular network formation than bevacizumab or TRC105 treatment alone ( manuscript in preparation).  Furthermore, TRC105 
induced apoptosis in HUVEC, and promotes  SMAD2/3 phosphorylation while  inhibiting 
SMAD1/5/8 signaling, thereby [CONTACT_52300]  [40]. 
Finally, antibody to mouse CD105 potentiates the activity of multitargeted  kinase inhibition that 
targets the VEGFR -2, in mouse bearing cancer grafts (manuscript in preparation).   For these 
reasons, CD105 blockade using TRC105 in combination with VEGF inhibition by [CONTACT_52301].  
2.2. TRC105 Background   
TRC105 is a genetically engineered human/murine chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against human CD105 [ 66], a growth proliferation receptor found on the surface of normal and 
proliferating endothelial cells  [28, 34, 42] .   
The antibody is an IgG1 kappa immunoglobulin containing murine variable region sequences 
and human constant region sequences  [66].  TRC105 has an approximate molecular weight of 
148 kDa. TRC105 has a binding avidity for human CD105 of approximately 5 pM. TRC105 is 
formulated as a phosphate -buffered saline (PBS) solution at a concentration of 7 mg/mL.   
SN6j, t he mu rine parent  antibody of TRC105, binds to human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
(HUVECs) with nea rly identical avidity as TRC105.  SN6j has been shown to bind the tumor 
vasculature of malignant tissues including breast, colon, rectum, kidney and lung  cancers and to 
inhibit the growth of tumor xenografts [ 35].  Reactivity with tumor tissues is  restricted to the 
tumor endothelium, as CD105 is not gene rally expressed on  epi[INVESTIGATOR_28056] [ 34].  TRC105 
induces  ADCC on proliferating HUVECs  at low conentrations and induces apoptosis and growth 
inhibition at higher concentrations .   
2.2.1. Studies with TRC105  
Several studies with TRC105 are underway or have been completed.  An open- label, phase  1, 
multicenter study of TRC105 (Study 105ST101) enrolled f ifty patients , who were treated until 
disease progression with TRC105 at 0.01- 15 mg/kg /q2wk or 10 -15 mg/kg/wk.  Studies of 
TRC105 in prostate, bladder, and ovarian cancer ,phase 1b study of TRC105 in combination with 
bevacizumab  and a phase 1b study of TRC105 in combination with capecitabine in breast cancer 
have also been completed.  Ongoing studies include a phase 1b study of TRC105 in combination 
with sorafenib in liver cancer , a phase 1b /2 study of TRC105 in combination with axitinib in 
renal cell carcinoma,  and phase 2 studie s of TRC105 monotherapy in liver cancer and in 
combination with bevacizumab in glioblastoma multiforme (2 studies) and renal cell carcinoma.

 of the assay (78 ng/mL) in patients receiving doses below 0.3 mg/kg.  TRC105 was measurable 
above the targe t concentration based on preclinical data (200 ng/mL) for 4 hours at 0.3 mg/kg, 1 
day at 1 mg/kg, 5 days at 3 mg/kg, 7 days at 10 mg/kg TRC105 dosed every two weeks.  Serum concentrations expected to saturate CD105 binding sites (≥ 200 ng/mL) were achieved continuously at 15 mg/kg q2wk and 10 mg/kg weekly, and TRC105 accumulated at 15 mg/kg 
weekly ( Figure 1 ).

In Study 105ST101, serum samples for evaluation of TRC105 immunogenicity, including HAMA and HACA, were collected pre- dose on day 1 of each 28 day cycle, at the end of study, 
and then at 4 and 12 weeks after the end of study visit.

 HAMA and HACA data are available from the phase 1 monotherapy TRC105 trial.  Neither 
HAMA nor HACA were detected in patients treated with  CHO- produced TRC105, which will be 
used for all future clinical trials, including this study . 
[IP_ADDRESS].3. 105ST101 Phase 1 Monotherapy Safety  
A total of 50 patients were treated on Study 105ST101 with escalating doses of TRC105 at 0.01, 
0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 15 mg/kg e very two  weeks and then 10 and 15 mg/kg weekly.  Dose 
escalation proceeded stepwise until the top dose was reached.  The maximum tolerated dose was exceeded at 15 mg/kg weekly and the recommended phase 2 dose of TRC105 was therefore determined to be 10 mg/kg weekl y or 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks .  Three of 4 patients at 15 mg/kg 
weekly developed grade 3 hypoproliferative anemia (without leucopenia or thrombocytopenia) in cycle 2, and one of the three progressed to grade 4 in cycle 3.  Anemia was associated with accumulation of TRC105 and characterized by a low reticulocyte production index.  Additional 
laboratory and clinical evaluations excluded common causes of anemia including blood loss, 
hemolysis, plasma volume expansion, inadequate erythropoietin, iron deficiency, and vitamin B -
12 or folate deficiency.  The anemia is believed to result from TRC105- mediated suppression of  
proerythroblasts, the only cells in the bone marrow known to express substantial levels of C D105 
[47].  Anemia was reversible and manageable with dose reduction and standard supportive 
measures including erythropoietin and blood transfusion.   
Infusion reactions, anemia, fatigue, epi[INVESTIGATOR_52274]105.  The majority of treatment- related adverse events 
were grade 1 or 2.  
Infusion reactions, among the mos t common adverse events, were usually with the initial 
TRC105 dose and included one or more of the following signs or symptoms: rigors, bronchospasm, urticaria, hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia or bradycardia.  Infusion 
reactions were in itially repor ted at 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks for patients receiving TRC105 
produced in NS0 cells without premedication.  TRC105 produced in CHO cells was known to 
more potently engage ADCC in vitro  than TRC105 produced in NS0 cells.  Because of this, the 
initial dose level for patients receiving CHO -produced TRC105 was de -escalated to 0.3 mg/kg.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_28057] -escalation, the first two patients at 0.3 mg/kg treated with CHO -produced 
TRC105 experie nced grade [ADDRESS_55356] dose in the absence of 
premedication.  The protocol was therefore amended to require a glucocorticoids  -based 
premedication regimen and extend the initial infusion duration from 1 to 4 hours.   
The amendment mandating premedication and extended initial infusion duration successfully 
reduced the frequency and severity of infusion reactions and allowed dose escalation to continue. 
One additional patient who received CHO -produced TRC105 at 1 mg/kg deve loped a grade [ADDRESS_55357] dose given over 2 hours.  This patient had experienced a grade 2 
infusion reaction when the dose was administered over 4 hours.  In all three patients with grade 3 
infusion reactions, TRC105 was not detectable in serum at the time of dosing, which allowed de novo binding of TRC105 to CD105 expressing endothelium within the vasculature.  Grade 3 
infusion reactions were not observed in patients dosed at 10 or 15 mg/kg who maintained 
TRC105 serum levels known to saturate CD105 binding sites for the full dosing interval.  At dose levels where continuous TRC105 serum levels were achieved, glucocorticoids  were safely 
discontinued and the infusion duration reduced to 1 hour.

 Three patients developed grade 1 cutaneous  telangiectasia on the trunk early in the course of 
therapy, all at dose levels of 10 or 15 mg/kg weekly that resul ted in continuous serum levels of 
TRC105 known to saturate CD105 sites on human endothelium.  Grade 1 or 2 hemorrhage was 
reported, including  intermittent postcoital vaginal bleeding (that also occurred prior to TRC105 
treatment), epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], and superficial gingival bleeding.    
Grade 1 or 2 headaches were observed, mainly in patients treated at doses of TRC105 above 3 mg/kg.  Headaches began t he day following infusion and were generally manageable with 
acetaminophen.  However, grade 2 headache in one patient at 15 mg/kg weekly prompted 
discontinuation prior to completion of the dose -limiting toxicity evaluation period.  Fatigue was 
one of the m ore common adverse event s attributable to TRC105 and was more prevalent at doses 
above 3 mg/kg.   
One patient developed dose -limiting toxicity of grade 4 hemorrhage presenting as melena from a 
gastric ulcer within 5 days of the initial TRC105 infusion at 0.1 mg/kg.  He discontinued 
TRC105 treatment, was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells and the bleeding resolved 
with nonsurgical management by [CONTACT_28107].  Serious bleeding was not 
observed following protocol amendment to exclude patients with a history of peptic ulcer dis ease 
(unless healing was documented) and patients on ulcerogenic medications including non-
steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs.  
Classic toxiciti es associated with VEGF inhibition, including hypertension, proteinuria  and 
thrombosis were not prominent.  One patient with recurrent anal cancer treated at 0.1 mg/kg developed proteinuria considered possibly related to TRC105, but proteinuria was also noted 
prior to TRC105 dosing.  Transient hypertension (156/112) without Q T changes occurred in a 
single patient one day following infusion of 15 mg/kg, and was controlled by a single dose of oral antihypertensive medication. There were no arterial or venous thromboembolic events , nor 
gastrointestinal or other perforations in th ese patients.    
[IP_ADDRESS].4. 105ST101 Phase 1 Monotherapy Efficacy  
In study 105ST101 s table disease ≥ 2 months was  observed in 21 of 45 patients (47%) and stable 
disease ≥ 4 months in 6 of 44 patients (14%).  Decreases in CEA, PSA, or CA -125 were noted in 
7 of 21 patients (33%) and a global decrease in key angiogenic biomarkers was observed with 
treatment.  One patient with castrate -refractory prostate cancer remains  on TRC105 treatment  
after 6 years at a TRC105 dose of 0.01 mg/kg every 2 weeks.  He ha s an ongoing  complete PSA 
response, with resolution of bone pain and bone scan normalization. One patient with metastatic carcinosarcoma,  manifested decreased tumor burden on computerized tomographic scanning and 
maintained stable disease for 20 months on therapy. The latter is especially notable when one considers that this patient had received three prior treatments -- carboplatin + paclitaxel for [ADDRESS_55358] favorable clinical outcome and did so 
as a fourth -line therapy.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Phase 1b 105ST102 Study with Bevacizumab  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. 105ST102 Summary of Safety 
Administration of TRC105 at a dose of 3 mg/kg weekly in combination wit h bevacizumab was 
well tolerated by [CONTACT_28108] (DLT) and 
dose escalation occurred per the protocol to cohort 2 (6 mg/kg TR105 weekly).  However, the 
concurrent administration of 6 mg/kg TRC105 and bevac izumab on day 1 resulted in the 
development of moderate or severe headaches (including two grade 3 headaches) in four of five 
treated patients.  The 6 mg/kg dose of TRC105 was tolerated when the initial TRC105 dose was 
delayed one week following bevacizuma b dosing at 10 mg/kg every two weeks.  Tolerability 
was further improved when the initial dose of TRC105 was given over two days during the first 
week of TRC105 dosing, and dose escalation proceeded to the recommended phase 2 dose of 10 
mg/kg TRC105 weekly .  At the recommended phase 2 dose of both drugs (10 mg/kg), TRC105 
serum concentration were present above target concentration continuously and immunogenicity 
was rarely observed.  
A total of [ADDRESS_55359] adverse events were graded as 1 or 2 and Grade 4 and 5 suspected adverse events were not observed. Grade 3 suspected adverse reactions included 
anemia (the dose limiting toxicity of TRC105 established as a single agent; 9 patients), headache 
(4 patients; three of which occurred prior to adjusting the schedule of TRC105), fatigue (2 
patients), brain abscess (1 patient), infusion reaction (in a patient dosed at 6 mg/kg), and decreased appetite (1 patient). Headache was the most common suspected adverse event and 
occu rred in 31 patients (86.1%); three patients (7.9%) experienced migraine headaches (two of 
grade 1 and one of grade 2 severity). Headaches were treated with triptans and NSAIDs.  
Two patients experienced serious adverse suspected events as described below.  One of the grade 3 headaches (in a patient dosed at 8 mg/kg without splitting the initial TRC105 dose over two days) resulted in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28058].  One patient dosed at 10 mg/kg of 
TRC105 experienced a serious suspected event of grade 3 brain abscess.  Serious adverse events, 
considered unrelated to TRC105 treatment, included: grade [ADDRESS_55360] myocardial infarction during a period of 
hemodynamic instability w hile hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]; grade 3 ileus at the time of symptomatic disease 
progression; grade 5 disease progression; grade 3 left foot cellulitis; grade 3 recurrent pneumothorax; grade 3 small bowel obstruction; grade [ADDRESS_55361] one sign of the triad o f epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], gingival bleeding and telangiectasia, reflecting vascular

study.   
Infusion reactions were, as expected, more notable at lower doses, and were rare at the MTD  of 
TRC105 of 10 mg/kg, when TRC105 serum concentrations were maintained continuously.  Two of nineteen patients (10%) dosed with 10 mg/kg of TRC105 each experienced a single infusion 
reaction of grade 2 severity, both with the initial dose of TRC105, that  required a brief 
interruption of the infusion prior to completion of the scheduled dose.  
Clinically significant anemia was not reported in patients dosed with 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg of TRC105, was reported in three of seven patients (43%; all grade 3) dosed w ith 8 mg/kg of 
TRC105, and was observed in nine of 19 (47%; three of grade 2 and six of grade 3 severity) of 
patients dosed with 10 mg/kg of TRC105.  Anemia prompted transfusion of packed red blood 
cells in 10 patients and growth factors were used in five patients.  
Other, less frequent, suspected adverse reactions included hypothyroidism, periorbital edema 
(which was generally noted prior to splitting the initial dose of TRC105), gingival pain, nausea, 
oral pain, vomiting, edema, decreased appetite, dyspnea , nasal congestion, rash and flushing.  
Other adverse events characteristic of each individual drug were not increased in frequency or 
severity when the two drugs were administered together.  Of note, the concurrent administration 
of bevacizumab and TRC105 did not potentiate the known toxicities of bevacizumab of 
hypertension, hemorrhage (including tumor -associated hemorrhage, and pulmonary hemorrhage 
or hemoptysis), or proteinuria.  Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), 
congestive heart failure, fistulae, gastrointestinal perforation impaired wound healing, and arterial thromboembolic events, were not observed. 
Notably, hypertension and proteinuira, known adverse events of bevacizumab, were rarely 
observed when bevacizumab was given with TRC105.  Mild and transient clinically significant 
hypertension or blood pressure increases were observed in five patients (13%; grade 3 in one case (prior to dosing with study drugs) and grade 2 in four cases) and mild transient proteinuria 
was observed i n two patients (5%; both grade 2).

three patien ts had measurable disease (31 patients) or evaluable disease (2 patients) at baseline 
and received at least one follow up scan and were evaluable for the primary efficacy outcome of ORR by [CONTACT_393] 1.1.  Eighteen patients with measureable disease (58%) had a  best response of

with colorectal cancer who continues on treatment for more than 24 months.  A total of 14 patients (45%) had decreases in overall tumor burden, of whom 10 received prior VEGF inhibitor treatment (usually bevacizumab w ith chemotherapy).  Notably, the duration of 
treatment with TRC105 and bevacizumab of six patients (19% of those with measureable disease) exceeded the duration of treatment of the most recent treatment regimen containing a VEGF inhibitor (i.e., VEGFR TKI or bevacizumab), received prior to study entry.  These six

 This trial is a phase 1 b/2a dose escalation study of pazopanib in combination with TRC105 in 
order to assess the safety and efficacy of CD105 blockade combined with the VEGFR TKI  
pazopanib.  A  standard “3+3” dose - escalation design of patients with advanced soft tissue 
sarcoma will be emp loyed  in the phase 1b portion,  followed by a  phase 2 portion to assess 
progression free survival (PFS) and overall response rate ( ORR), safety, and correlative studies 
of expression of endoglin on tumor tissue and plasma angiogenic biomarkers.   The purpose of 
the dose escalation portion is to determine the maximum tolerated do se (MTD) of TRC105 when 
given in combination with pazopanib and to determine the dose limiting toxicities.  Patients 
included in the study will have advanced soft tissue s arcoma that has progressed following first 
line chemotherapy . The phase [ADDRESS_55366] been the source of gingival bleeding and epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940].  Telangiectasia are also seen in patients with hered itary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a disease of CD105 haplotype 
insufficiency.  Patients with HHT are at risk of hemorrhage from abnormal blood vessels and this could be exacerbated by [CONTACT_28112]105.  Other contraindications to TRC105 therapy include a history of significant hemorrhage or tumors located in the central chest or another 
location where bleeding is associated with high morbidity.  All patients treated with TRC105 
should be monitored for signs of hemorrhage and the risks and benefit s of drug treatment 
reevaluated in any patient with hemorrhage.  
Premedication including the use of glucocorticoid s is required prior to infusion of TRC105 to 
reduce the frequency and severity of infusion reactions.  Infusion reactions following TRC105 dosing generally occur  with the first TRC105 dose and include a grade 4 vasovagal reaction that 
resolved without sequellae.  Signs and symptoms  of TRC105 infusion reactions include 
hypertension, hypotension, dyspnea, bronchospasm, chills/rigors, chills, sweats , fever, nausea, 
tachycardia, bradycardia, EKG changes, flushing, urticaria, pruritus, and headache, generally of 
grade 1 and 2 severity. Potential infusion reactions seen with other therapeutic antibodies include

 angioedema, asthenia, throat irritation, rhinitis, vomiting, joint pain, fatigue and neurologic 
disorders including inflammation of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_20793]/or brain.  
Hypersensitivity reactions with infusions are a potential risk for sensitized patients, and TRC105 should be used with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the drug product.  Host anti -TRC105 antibodies to the murine or human portions of CHO -produced 
TRC105 are rare.  In general, the risk of immunogenicity to therapeutic c himeric antibodies is 
small (<10%) and the clinical significance of immunogenicity is not well defined.  The current trial will collect serial blood samples for anti -product antibody  concentrations to further 
characterize the immunogenicity of TRC105 and potential clinical implications.  
Grade 3 cerebrovascular hemorrhage resulting in hemiparesis occurred in one patient with hepatocellular cancer who was thrombocytopenic (who entered the study with a platelet count of 
60,000/uL) in a study of TRC105 with sor afenib.  Patients must have a platelet count of > 
100,000/uL to enter this study (see inclusion criteria). A grade [ADDRESS_55367] patient with glioblastoma with a history of recurrent meningitis developed recurrent grade 3 bacteri al meningitis while treated with 
bevacizumab and TRC105. 
Grade 3 myocardial infarction (non- Q wave infarct associated with hypertension following an 
infusion reaction) was observed in a patient with hepatocellular cancer following treatment with 
TRC105 tha t resolved without sequellae.  In addition, a Grade 5 myocardial infarction occurred 
in a patient with coronary artery disease who received TRC105 in combination with sorafenib. 
Patients with evidence of active coronary artery disease are excluded from par ticipation in this 
trial (see exclusion criteria).

lung disease has  been added as an adverse drug reaction and warning/precaution to the core 
safety information for pazopanib. Pneumothorax (collapsed lung) has been observed in trial s of 
TRC105 administered with VEGF inhibitors in patients with lung metastases. In addition , 
pnemothorax was observed in one patient, also with lung metastases, receiving single -agent 
TRC105. 
Infections have been observed rarely. Grade 3 infected lipoma/cyst was observed in a Phase [ADDRESS_55368] been observed in fewer

 than 5% of patients and have largely been considered unrelated to treatment with TRC105. 
Reversible grade [ADDRESS_55369] common adverse reactions in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (≥20%) are 
fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, decreased weight, hypertension, decreased appetite, vomiting, tumor pain, hair color changes, musculoskeletal pain, headache, dysgeusia, dyspnea and skin 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371].  
Further details are available in the package insert  [67]. 
Computed Tomography (CT) Scans  
Patients will be exposed to a small amount of radiation as a result of the CT scans required in 
this study.  This degree of exposure has not been associa ted with harmful health effects. In 
addition, the frequency of CT scans performed in this study is similar to the standard of care 
frequency. Patients with a medical contraindication to CT scans or known Iodinated contrast 
allergies may undergo MRI.  There  is minimal risk of  MRI imaging in patients able to undergo 
this type of exam including very rare reports  of gadolinium -induce nephrogenic systemic fibrosis 
in patients with poor renal function. 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):  
MRI is a noninvasive imagin g test used to diagnose and evaluate medical conditions. MRI does 
not use radiation and there are no known harmful side -effects. However, MRI may cause anxiety 
for people due to the loud banging made by [CONTACT_52303].   People with pacemakers, aneurysm clips, artificial heart valves, ear implants, or metal 
implants or foreign objects in their body are not permitted to have an MRI.

 Bone Scans:  
A bone scan is a test that can find cancer that has spread to the bones. A bone scan can often find 
a problem days to months earlier than a regular X -ray test. During a bone scan, a radioactive 
substance called a tracer is injected into a vein in your arm.  The tracer travels through your 
bloodstream and into your bones. Then a special camera takes pi[INVESTIGATOR_52275]. A bone scan poses no greater risk than do conventional X -ray procedures.  The tracers 
used in a bone scan produce very littl e radiation exposure — less than half that of a CT scan.  
Venipuncture  
Patients could also experience side effects from venipuncture for tests that will be done as part of 
this study including pain, tenderness or bruising at the site of collection, and rar ely infection may 
occur at the spot where the needle is inserted.  
Other Risks  
This study treatment may involve risks to unborn children therefore  patients should not become 
pregnant or father a baby [CONTACT_52304].  Patients should not nurse while on 
this study.  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test before taking 
part in this study.  Patients will be asked to practice an effective method of birth control during participation in this study and for three  months after the last treatment. The long term risk of 
infertility is unknown. Ovarian failure has been observed with other antiangiogenic agents.  
2.5.2. Potential Benefits  
TRC105 is an investigational product, and its efficacy has not been established.  It is possible that the administration of TRC105 may result in clinical benefit (i.e., tumor response or 
prolonged stable disease) . 
2.6. Justification of the Dose, Schedule and Route of Administration of 
TRC105  
2.6.1. Phase 1b  Justification  
The dose and schedule of TRC105 (8 mg/kg weekly up to 10 mg/kg weekly , 15 mg/kg every 2 
weeks ) for phase 1b were selected based on safety, pharmacokinetics and early evidence of 
activity in the phase 1 study of TRC105 for patients with solid tumors (Study 105ST101)  and in 
the phase 1b study  of TRC105 with bevacizumab.  In phase 1, a weekly dose of 10 mg/kg  and a 
dose of 15 mg/kg every two weeks were  well tolerated and associated with clinical activity.  
Dose reduction was possible for treatment of anemia.  Doses of 8 and 10 mg/kg TRC105 weekly 
were tolerated in combination with bevacizumab , pazopanib (dose levels 1 and 2 of this study ) 
and axitinib and doses of TRC105 of 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks were tolerated in combination 
with sorafenib.  Notably, while the initial schedule of TRC105 was adj usted to decrease the 
frequency of headaches  observed with the combination of TRC105 and bevacizumab, there was 
no potentiation of life threatening toxicities asso ciated with bevacizumab, nor potentiation of 
common VEGF inhibitor toxicities (e.g., hyperten sion and proteinuria).   
IND 131053                                      105SAR101 Protocol  Amendment #7, July 22, 2016 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Protocol    
 
Page 37 of 111  
 Given the limited experience dosing TRC105 with VEGF inhibitor s, it is possible  that TRC105 
toxicities will potentiate pazopanib toxicities, and vice versa.  Therefore a TRC105 starting dose 
of 8 mg/kg weekly, which is 20% lower than the single -agent TRC105 MTD identified in the 
phase 1 single agent study and phase  1b study with bevacizumab, was selected. I n addition a 6 
mg/kg ( -1) dose level has also been included and will be enrolled should 8 mg/kg of TRC105 in 
combination with pa zopanib exceed the MTD.   As an added precaution, the first dose of TRC105 
will be delayed by 2 to 4 week s following pazopanib dosing  and administered over 2 days.  In 
addition, pazopanib will be introduced at 800 mg and dose reduced based on patient tolera bility 
over a two  to four  week  period prior to the introduction of TRC105. This administration schedule 
will limit immediate C max effects of the combination of two drugs that could result in toxicity.  
In the phase 1b portion of the study, dose levels 1 and 2, TRC105 at its recommended phase 2 dose of 10 mg/kg given by [CONTACT_52305] 800 mg p.o. once daily.  
The phase 1b portion of the study will also evaluate TRC105 administered ever y two weeks at 15 
mg/kg  starting at cycle 2, following initial dosing with 10 mg/kg weekly for the initial 28 day cycle.  TRC105 will be given in combination with pazopanib 800 mg daily. In the phase 1 study of single -agent TRC105 (105ST101), TRC105 15 mg /kg administered every 2 weeks was well 
tolerated  and resulted in continuous serum concentrations known to saturate CD105 binding sites 
on proliferating endothelium .  An alternative dosing schedule of every 2 weeks TRC105 
treatment in combination with pazopanib, if tolerable,  may offer patients more convenience 
without sacrificing safety and efficacy.  
2.6.2. Phase 2  Justification  
The Phase 2 portion of the trial is designed to assess the activity of TRC105 in combination with the approved dose of pazopanib, as com pared to the single agent activity established for 
pazopanib in a prior study.  Activity of the combination will be assessed as PFS (primary endpoint) and also ORR.  Efficacy endpoints will be retrospectively correlated with expression of endoglin on tumor  tissue to determine if direct endoglin expression on sarcoma (in addition to 
the tumor vasculature) may be used as a marker to enrich for responsive sarcoma subtypes in future studies .  
Given that the two drugs were well tolerated together at their single  agent doses, the phase 2 
portion of the study will dose both drugs starting in cycle 1. Dose reductions of pazopanib, based on individual patient tolerability, are permitted starting in cycle 1.  
Five patients with cutaneous angiosarcoma were enrolled in t he phase 1b/ Phase [ADDRESS_55370] ongoing complete responses (at 
15 and 22 months of treatment) including one patient who progressed previously after pazopanib 
and docetaxel. These data were presented at ASCO [ADDRESS_55371]  progressed following prior systemic treatment, will be enrolled to assess the overall 
response rate in this subtype of soft tissue sarcoma.

administered every two week s on days 1 and  15 once it is determined that the every two week dosing MTD has 
not been exceeded. . 
In dose levels - 1, 1, 2 and expanded cohort  1, patients will receive 800 mg of pazopanib daily 
p.o. in cycle 1, which will be  two to four weeks in duration prior to the initial dose of TRC105 
given on cycle 2 day 1.  Cycle 1 will therefore be as short as 14 days or as long as 28 days , based 
on the time needed to determine a tolerable dose of pazopanib in each patient .  Dose reductions 
of pazopanib are allowed during cycle 1  based on i ndividual patient tolerability  (as well as 
following cycle 1) . TRC105 dosing will begin at 8 mg/kg (Dose Level 1)  on cycle [ADDRESS_55380] maintain eligibility criteria 
indicating adequat e organ function, medical status and ECOG performance status (i.e., patients 
must maintain inclusion criterion # 6, 8, 9 and 10 and exclusion criteria #8 -21 to continue into 
cycle 2)  and must be able to tolerate pazopanib.  A  -1 Dose Level has also been included (6 
mg/kg) and will be enrolled if 8 mg/kg  TRC105 dosed with pazopanib exceeds weekly the MTD.  
For dose levels - 1, 1 and 2, the DLT evaluation period, for purposes of dose expansion, will  be 
the initial 28 days of dosing with TRC105 and pazopanib ( from cycle 2 day 1 through cycle 2 
day 28).   Each cycle will be [ADDRESS_55381] 28 days of dosing pazopani b with TRC105 every 
2 weeks (i.e., from cycle 2 day 1 through cycle 2 day 28).  At least 6 patients will be treated at the every two week dosing MTD (or top dose level if a MTD is not determined).  
Three patient s will be initially enrolled and treated  at each dose level. If none of these 3 patient s 
experiences a dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) during the 28- day evaluation period ( extending from 
cycle 2 day 1 until cycle 2 day 28 ), dose escalation will proceed following review of safety data 
with site staf f including  the principal investigator s at all sites.   
If 1 of 3 patient s experiences DLT, the dose level  will be expanded to 6 patient s.  The maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) will have been exceeded if ≥ 33% of patient s experience DLT at  a given 
dose level .  DLT will have occurred when a patient has [ADDRESS_55382] possibly related  to the combination of pazopanib and TR C105 during the 28 
day DLT evaluation period (cycle 2) .  Patient s who exit the study for reasons other than DLT 
prior to completion of the 28- day DLT  evaluation period (cycle 2)  will be replaced  to ensure an 
adequate safety assessment in  each cohort . Patients who experience DLT who receive less than 
the prescribed dose of TRC105 or pazopanib due to documented toxicity during the DLT evaluation period will be considered evaluable for dose escalation purposes.  A given TRC105 
dose level may be reenrolled at 
> 50% of the pazopanib dose intensity upon agreement of study 
investigators .

[IP_ADDRESS]. Trial Period  
Qualifying hematology  (including Fe studies) , blood chemistry  (including TSH testing) , 
coagulation, urinalysis, physical examination , ECG, and pregnancy test do not need to be 
repeated on cycle  [ADDRESS_55390] maintain eligibility criteria indicating adequate organ function, medical status and ECOG 
performance status (i.e., all patients must maintain inclusion criterion #4, 5 and 6 and exclusion 
criteria #8 -21 to continue into cycle 2).  On d ays of dosing, all assessments should be performed 
prior to dosing with TRC105 unless otherwise indicated in the Schedule of Assessments. Patients 
will receive 2 cycles (approximately 6 -8 weeks ) of treatment.  Patients who demonstrate a 
response of CR, PR or SD, will be eligible for additional treatment until progression. For patients 
in the angiosarcoma cohort  1, disease progression  for withdrawal from study therapy  refers to 
disease progression while receiving TRC105 plus pazopanib combination therapy . Patients who 
cannot tolerate pazopanib or TRC105 therapy and who demonstrate a response of complete 
response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) with the combination and are thought 
to benefit from continued single agent therapy may continue on study on TRC105 or pazopanib 
alone .  Each cycle is 28 days  in duration, with the exception of cycle 1 for phase 1b dose levels -
1, 1, 2 and expanded cohort 1 which will be 2 to 4 weeks in duration. The following will be 
performed according to the Schedul e of Assessmen ts (Table 4, Table 5, Table  6 and  Table 7 ). 
• Physical examination including examination of all major body systems, ECOG performance status,  weight  and vital signs  (heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]).  
o Assessment of vital signs during TRC105 i nfusion: Vital signs are to be assessed 
pre-infusion (i.e., within 30 minutes of starting the infusion), every 30 minutes 
during the infusion (+/ - 15 minutes), and at the end of the infusion (i.e., within 30 
minutes after completing the infusion) .  Vital signs should be monitored more 
frequently and/or beyond the completion of the infusion if medically indicated 
(e.g. if the patient exp eriences an infusion reaction that has not yet resolved).  
• Hematology, coagulation (INR) and serum chemistry  (including TSH ) to be performed 
locally . 
• Serum or urine pregnancy test for all females of childbearing potential to be performed locally . 
• Single tr acing 12 -Lead ECG (QT, PR and QRS intervals and heart rate will be captured).

 Schedule of Assessments Footnotes  for Phase 1b Dose Levels 3 , 4 and Expanded Cohort 2  
1. Days of Treatment with TRC105:  All assessments should be performed prior to the TRC105 infusion unless otherwise indicated.  Each cycle is 28 days in 
duration.  
2. Cycle 1 day 1:  Hematology (including iron studies), blood chemistry (including TSH testing), urinalysis, physical examination, ECG and pregnancy test not 
required if acceptable screening assessment is performed within 7 days prior to the start of treatment on cycle 1 day 1.  
3. End of Study:  The end of study visit should generally occur within 14 days (+/ - 1 day) of the last dose of TRC105. Assessments  other than 
pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and protein biomarkers  do not need to be repeated if performed within the previous 2 weeks (previous 8 weeks for 
radiologic tumor assessments). Follow -up visits should occur [ADDRESS_55408] dose of TRC105 study drug as outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments.  
4. Informed Consent: Must be obtained prior to undergoing any study specific procedure and may occur prior to the 28- day screening period.  
5. Medical  and Oncologic History,  Demographics  and Baseline Signs and Symptoms : All information related to  prior anticancer treatment should be 
recorded. Significant medical history and baseline signs and symptoms should be captured from the date of informed consent .  
6. Physical Examination:  Examination of major body systems and ECOG performance status.  
7. Vital Signs:  Heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], weight. Assessment of vital signs during TRC105 Infusions: Vital signs are to be 
assessed pre -infusion (i.e., within 30 minute s of starting the infusion) every 30 minutes during the infusion (+/ - 15 minutes) and at the end of the infusion 
(i.e. within 30 minutes after completing the infusion). Vital signs should be monitored more frequently and/or beyond the completion of the inf usion if 
medically indicated (e.g. if the patient experiences an infusion reaction that has not yet resolved).   
8. Hematology, Chemistry & Coagulation:  Testing to be performed locally.  Thyroid stimulating hormone to be tested at screening, day 1 of each cy cle and 
at the end of study visit.  Cycle 1 day 1 assessments only need to  be performed if screening assessments were performed more than 7 days prior to cycle 1 
day 1.  Iron studies (FE) to be performed according to the schedule of assessments and as clin ically indicated during the study.  Thyroid stimulating hormone 
(TSH ) to be performed according to the schedule of assessments and as clinically indicated during the study .  Lab assessments may be performed within 3 
days prior to TRC105 dosing.  In addition to the assessments scheduled for the clinical trial, patients should undergo assessment as appropriate to ensure safe 
treatment. See Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for specific panel collection requirements.  
9. Pregnancy Test:  Testing to be performed locally. All female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_55409] dose of TRC105.  
10. Urinalysis: To be performed locally. Cycle 1 day 1 urinalysis  only needs to  be performed if screening urinalysis was performed more than 7 days prior to 
cycle 1 day 1.  Microscopic anal ysis and/or urine protein creatinine ratio or 24 -hour urine protein collection should be performed as clinically indicated.  
11. TRC105 Administration:  Intravenous TRC105 diluted in normal saline will be administered every [ADDRESS_55410] week ly TRC105 dose 
will be given on cycle 1  day 1and split into two doses whereby 3 mg/kg is administered on cycle 1  day 1 and the balance is administered on cycle 1  day 4.  
The entire dose of TRC105 (10 mg/kg) is then given on cycle 1  day 8 , cycle 1 day 15 an d cycle 1 day 22. Starting on cycle 2 day 1 and beyond, TRC105 will 
be administered every two weeks on days 1 and 15.  See Section 6.1.6  for specific TRC105 administration guidelines.  
12. Pazopanib Dosing: Oral pazopanib will be dosed once daily at [ADDRESS_55411] or MRI Tumor Imaging:  Images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to be performed at screening, and on -study as outlined in the assessment table.  
Known areas of disease should be consistently followed throughout the study.  Ass essments should be performed whenever disease progression is suspected.  
Allowable window for tumor imaging studies is +/ - 7 days. Brain and bone scans are to be performed if metastases are suspected at screening or during study 
therapy.  Color photography  with caliper or ruler measurements should be used to assess cutaneous tumors (target lesions).

3. End of Study:  The end of study visit should generally occur within 7 days (+/ - 1 day) of the last dose of TRC105. Assessments  other than 
pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and protein biomarkers  do not need to be repeated if performed within the previous 2 weeks (previous 8 weeks for 
radiologic tumor assessments). I f the patient permanently discontinues all study therapy due to AE, patient decision, investigator decision or any other 
reason  the end of study assessments should be completed.  Note that in  this cohort, disease progression refers to disease progression while receiving 
TRC105 plus pazopanib combination therapy . Follow -up visits should occur [ADDRESS_55429] dose of TRC105 study drug as outlined in the 
Schedule of Assessments.  
4. Informed Consent: Must be obtained prior to undergoing any study specific procedure and may occur  prior to the 28- day screening period.  
5. Medical  and Oncologic History,  Demographics  and Baseline Signs and Symptoms : All information related to  prior anticancer treatment should be 
recorded. Significant medical history and baseline signs and symptoms should  be captured from the date of informed consent .  
6. Physical Examination:  Examination of major body systems and ECOG performance status.  
7. Vital Signs:  Heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], weight. Assessment during TRC105 Infusions: Vital  signs are to be assessed pre-
infusion (i.e., within 30 minutes of starting the infusion) every 30 minutes during the infusion (+/ - 15 minutes) and at the end of the infusion (i.e. within 30 
minutes after completing the infusion). Vital signs should be mon itored more frequently and/or beyond the completion of the infusion if medically indicated 
(e.g. if the patient experiences an infusion reaction that has not yet resolved).  If TRC105 administration is switched to every two week dosing, clinic visits 
are required only on days of TRC105 infusion (i.e., days 1 and 15 of each every two week administration cycle).  
8. Hematology, Chemistry & Coagulation:  Testing to be performed locally.  Thyroid stimulating hormone to be tested at screening, day 1 of each cycle an d 
at the end of study visit.  Cycle 1 day 1 assessments only need to  be performed if screening assessments were performed more than 7 days prior to cycle 1 
day 1.  Iron studies (FE) to be performed according to the schedule of assessments and as clinically  indicated during the study.  Lab assessments may be 
performed within 3 days prior to TRC105 dosing . In addition to the assessments scheduled for the clinical trial, patients should undergo assessment as 
appropriate to ensure safe treatment. See Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for specific panel collection requirements.  
9. Pregnancy Test:  Testing to be performed locally. All female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_55430] dose of TRC105.  
10. Urinalysis: To be performed locally. Cycle 1 day 1 urinalysis  only needs to  be performed if screening urinalysis was performed more t han 7 days prior to 
cycle 1 day 1.  Microscopic analysis and/or urine protein creatinine ratio or 24 -hour urine protein collection should be performed as clinically indicated.  
11. TRC105 Administration:  Intravenous TRC105 diluted in normal saline will be admin istered  as outlined in the assessments table .  See Section 6.1.6  for 
specific TRC105 administration guidelines.

 6. TREATMENT OF PATIENTS  
6.1. Description of TRC105 Study Drug  
TRC105 is a genetically engineered human/murine chimeric monoclonal antibody directed 
against human CD105 found on the surface of proliferating endothelial cells.   
6.1.1. Composition of TRC105 
TRC105 is an IgG1, kappa immunoglobulin contai ning murine light - and heavy -chain variable 
region sequences and human constant region sequences.  TRC105 has an approximate molecula r 
weight of 148 kDa .  
6.1.2. TRC105 Dose Level  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Phase 1b  
Each patient  will be dosed with 6 (Dose L evel - 1), 8 (Dose Level 1) or 10 mg/kg  (Dose Level 2),  
or 15 mg/kg  (Dose Level 3) The maximum weight that should be used for purpose of dose 
calculation is 85 kg for women and 100 kg for men. Thus, the maximum dose that should be 
given to a woman at the 10 mg/kg dose is 850 mg and  at the 15 mg/kg dose is 1275 mg, and the 
maximum dose that should be given to a man at the 10 mg/kg dose is 1000 mg  and at the 15 
mg/kg dose is 1,[ADDRESS_55450] 
weekly dose will be split into two doses whereby 3 mg/kg will be  administered on cycle 2 day 1 
and the balance will be  administered on cycle 2 day 4 ).  The entire weekly dose of TRC105 (6, 8 
or 10 mg/kg)  is then  given  on cycle [ADDRESS_55451] weekly dose split into two doses whereby 3 mg/kg is administered on cycle 1 day 1 and 7 
mg/kg is administered on cycle 1 day 4. The entire weekly dose of TRC105 at 10 mg/kg is then given on cycle 1 day 8 and weekly u ntil cycle 2 day 1 when TRC105 is administered at 15 mg/kg 
every two weeks. The DLT evaluation period, for purposes of dose escalation , will be cycle 2 . 
Each cycle will be 28 days in duration.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Phase 2  
Each patient , includi ng patients in the angiosarcoma cohort , will be dosed with 10 mg/kg up to a 
maximum dose of 850 mg of TRC105 for women and 1,000 mg of TRC105 for men (i .e., 85 
kg for women and 100 kg for men is the maximum weight that should be used for purposes 
of dose calculation on this study).  TRC1 05 is distributed according to lean body mass rather 
than overall body weight.  Patients who are overweight would be at risk for high serum levels of TRC105 if the doses were not capped.  85 kg for women and 100 kg for men represent accepted

observed.  M ultiple vials will be required for a single dose.  The following formulae should be 
used to calculate the volume of TRC105 to be added to normal saline:  
• Patient weight (kg) × dose l evel ( mg/kg)  divided by [CONTACT_28117]105 concentration (mg/mL) = 
volume of TRC105 ( mL) to be administered.  
The volume of TRC105 that is to be administered can be rounded up or down to the nearest 1.0

 weight that should be used for dose calculation in this study is 85 kg for women and 100 kg 
for men (note: there is not a weight restriction for enrollment purposes).   If the patient’s 
weight changes by > 10% d uring the study, the dose of TRC105 will be recalculated.  At that 
time a new baseline weight will be established such that subsequent weight changes by >10% 
from the new baseline weight would require further recalculation of the TRC105 dose. The 
calculated volume of TRC105 will be diluted with normal saline.  Appropriate judgment should 
be exercised in withdrawing an adequate amount of saline necessary to permit injection of the appropriate volume of antibody into a normal saline bag in accordance with the  dose needed.  
The final TRC105 concentration must be between 0.6 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL.  The prepared 
TRC105 must be gently inverted several times in order to ensure a homogeneous solution. The diluted infusion solution of TRC105 should be used within 8 hour s of preparation if stored at 
room temperature, or within 24 hours of dilution if stored at 2° to 8°C (36º to 46ºF). The expi[INVESTIGATOR_52277].  If the diluted infusion solution of TRC105 cannot 
be infused within 8 hours  of preparati on (i.e.: the prepared infusion is at room temperature for 
more than 8 hours) , a second bag will be prepared that contains the balance of the planned dose 
that was not already delivered.  The prepared solution should not be frozen. 
6.1.6. TRC105 Administration  
Patients should be encouraged to drink abundant fluid (e.g., two eight ounce glasses of water or 
juice) prior to the first treatment.  Intravenous  hydration prior to and during therapy is left to the 
discretion of the Investigator , but should be considered for patients that may be volume depleted . 
The following TRC105 premedications should be administered 2 hours to 30 minutes  prior to the  
start of each infusion:    
• Acetaminophen 650 mg p.o. x 1  
• Methylprednisolone  100 mg i .v. will be given prior to the cycle 1 day 1 and cycle 1 
day 4 infusions.  In addition, methylprednisolone will be given in the case of a delay 
of > 10 days between any two scheduled weekly  doses or in the case of a delay of >  
17 days between any  two scheduled every other week doses , or if the patient develops 
an infusion reaction >  grade 2 during the immediate prior infusion.  
• Famotidine 20 mg i.v. or p.o. (or similar H2 blocker) x 1 . Famotidine (or similar H2 
blocker) may be discontinued starting with Cycle 2 for weekly dosing  , Cycle 3 for 
every two week dosing, in the absence of infusion reactions with the prior dose. 
• Cetirizine 10  mg i.v. or p.o. x 1 (or similar oral or intravenous antihistamine) .  
Cetirizine (or similar oral or intravenous antihistimine) may be discontinued  starting 
with Cycle 2  for weekly dsoing , Cycle 3 for every two week dosing, in the absence of 
infusion reactions with the prior dose.  
TRC105 infusions will begin 2 hours to 30 minutes following the completion of the TRC105 
premedication , including the met hylprednisolone infusion.     
TRC105 will be administered intravenously utilizing an infusion pump.  TRC105 has been 
demonstrated to be compatible with polyethylene lined, non- DEHP infusion sets and polyvinyl

In cycle 3 and beyond (and beginning in cycle 2 of the phase 2 portion) , TRC105 dose reductions  
are allowed for grade 3 or 4 related adverse events  that resolve to grade 1 or baseline (including 
anemia) .  Treatment dose delays cannot exceed 8 consecutive weeks (i.e., both TRC105 and 
pazopanib dosing held). However, patients who cannot tolerate pazopanib or TRC105 therapy 
and who demonstrate a response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable 
disease (SD) with the combination and are thought to benefit from continued single agent  
therapy may continue on study on TRC105 or pazopanib alone  per Sectio n 5.3 of the protocol .

• The patient has not had a hemorrhagic event of grade 2 or higher while on study.  
• The patient does not have a pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding (e.g., tumor involving major vessels).  
• The patient is benefiting from TRC105 therapy (no evidence of disease progression).  
 
TRC105 and pazopanib should be held for two weeks prior and for two weeks following surgical 
procedures. However, resumption of study treatment can be shorter (but no less than 7 days) or longer than two weeks based on clinical judgement of adequate wound healing and recovery 
from the procedure. For minor procedures  (e.g., port placement), TRC105 (and pazopanib) 
should be held for at least [ADDRESS_55459] 1 week after (or until adequate healing).

6.1.8. Management of TRC105 Infusion Reactions  
If a patient  experiences a  grade 2 or higher  adverse reaction during infusion, the infusion should 
be interrupted and the patient  treated accordingly.  Antipyretic , antihistamine , antiemetic, anti-
inflammatory, or other symptomatic  medications  including epi[INVESTIGATOR_52278].  For grade 2 and certain grade 3 infusion reactions, the infusion may  be restarted at 
half of the previous rate if and when the infusion reaction has resolved, and then increased per patient tolerance to a maximum of 25 mg/min.  For grade 4 infusion reactions, the infusion 
should not be restarted and the patient should disc ontinue  TRC105 treatment.  Infusion reactions 
will be recorded as AEs in the case report form.  Interventions should be documented as 
concomitant medications or concomitant treatments as appropriate .

See p azopanib package insert [ 67].  
6.2.1. Composition of Pazopanib  
See p azopanib package insert [ 67].  
6.2.2. Pazopanib  Dose Level  
Each patient , except for patients in the angiosarcoma cohort,  will be dosed with  800 mg of 
pazopanib on cyc le 1 day 1 and daily  thereafter , in the absence of toxicity, once daily without 
food (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal)  for each day of a  28 day cycle  [67].  Note  
that in phase 1b dose levels 1, 2 and expanded cohort 1 only , cycle 1 will be 14 to 28 days in 
duration during which pazopanib will be dosed alone .  Pazopanib dose reductions are allo wed 
based on individual patient  tolerability, including during the initial 2  to 4 week period  of the 
phase 1b when pazopanib is dosed in the absence of TRC105.  
Patients in the angiosarcoma cohort 1 will start pazopanib dosing at the time of disease 
progression on TRC105 single -agent . The starting pazopanib dose will be 800 mg daily  in 
accordance with the package insert. Pazopanib dose reductions are allowed based on individual 
patient  tolerability .

Page 76 of 111  
 6.2.5. Pazopanib  Dosing  
The recommended starting dose of pazopanib is 800 mg orally once daily without food (at least  1 
hour before or 2 hours after a meal). The dose of pazopanib will not exceed [ADDRESS_55463] 
systemic exposure.  
If a dose is missed, it should not be taken if it is less than 12 hours until the next dose  [67]. 
6.2.6. Pazopanib  Dose Modification  
Dose increase or reduction is recommended based on individual safety and tolerability.  Decrease or 
increase should be in 200 mg steps based on individual tolerability.  The dose of pazopanib will 
not exceed 800 mg. If a d ose is missed, it should not be taken if it is less than 12 hours until the 
next dose.  P atients who cannot tolerate pazopanib or TRC105 therapy and who demonstrate a 
response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) with the  
combination and are thought to benefit from continued single a gent therapy may continue on 
study on TRC105 or pazopanib alone  per Section  5.3 of the protocol . 
Hepatic Impairment: No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, alternatives to pazopanib should be  considered. If 
pazopanib is used in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the dose should be reduced to 
200 mg per day. Pazopanib is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
• Patients with isolated ALT elevations between [ADDRESS_55464] may be continued 
on pazopanib with weekly monitoring of liver function until ALT return to Grade 1 or 
baseline.  
• Patients with isolated ALT elevations of >[ADDRESS_55465] pazopanib interr upted 
until they return to Grade 1 or baseline. If the potential benefit for reinitiating treatment 
with pazopanib is considered to outweigh the risk for hepatotoxicity, then reintroduce 
pazopanib at a reduced dose of no more than 400 mg once daily and mea sure serum liver 
tests weekly for 8 weeks. Following reintroduction of pazopanib, if ALT elevations >[ADDRESS_55466] recur, then pazopanib should be permanently discontinued. 
• If ALT elevations >[ADDRESS_55467] occur concurrently with bilirubin elevations >[ADDRESS_55468] (unconjugated) 
hyperbilirubinemia may occur in patients with Gilbert’s syndrome. Patients with only a 
mild indirect hyperb ilirubinemia, known Gilbert’s syndrome, and elevation in ALT >[ADDRESS_55469] should be managed as per the recommendations outlined for isolated ALT 
elevations.  
Blood pressure should be monitored and managed promptly using a combination of anti -
hypertensive therap y and dose modification of pazopanib (interruption and re -initiation at a 
reduced dose based on clinical judgment) . 
Increased blood pressure should be treated promptly with standard anti -hypertensive therapy and 
dose reduction or interruption of pazopanib as clinically warranted. pazopanib should be discontinued if there is evidence of hypertensive crisis or if hypertension is severe and persistent

for repeat epi[INVESTIGATOR_52280] . 
Institute appropriate anti- infective therapy promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation 
of pazopanib for serious infections.  
Interruption of therapy with pazopanib is recommended in patients undergoing surgical 
procedures  [67]. TRC105 and pazopanib should be held for two weeks prior and for two weeks 
following surgical procedures. For minor procedures  (e.g., port placemen t), TRC105 (and 
pazopanib) should be held for at least [ADDRESS_55470] 1 week after (or until adequate 
healing). 
 
6.2.7. Pazopanib  Drug Accountability  
Patients will be asked to return any unused tablets from the previous cycle for proper drug 
accoun tability and destruction according to institution guidelines . A new prescription will be 
dispensed for the following cycle .  
6.3. Concomitant Medications  
No other approved or investigational anticancer treatment will be permitted during the study period.  No ot her investigational drug may be used during treatment on this protocol, and 
concurrent participation in another clinical trial is not allowed.  
Patients who receive NSAIDs on study should also receive peptic ulcer disease ( PUD ) 
prophylaxis with an H2 or proton pump blocker . 
Narcotic analgesics , nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, and triptans (e.g. sumatriptan)  may be 
offered as needed  for relief of pain or headaches .  Antihistamines and decongestants may be 
offered for the treatment of sinus congestion. 
Packed red blood cell , colony stimulating factors,  and platelet transfusions should be 
admini stered as clinically indicated.   
CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Avoid use of strong inhibitors  (Table 14) ; co-administration of pazopanib 
with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 increases pazopanib concentrations . Patients may not have 
received a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor within 7 days prior to cycle 1 day  1. If co-administration is 
warranted, r educe the dose of pazopanib to 400 mg .  
CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme 
induction potential ; CYP3A4 inducers may decrease plasma pazopanib concentrations. 
Pazop anib should not be used if chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided. 
Patients may not have received a strong CYP3A4 inducer within 12 days prior to cycle 1 day 1.  
CYP Substrates: Concomitant use of pazopanib with agents with narrow therapeut ic windows 
that are metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C8 is not recommended.

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Protocol    
 
Page [ADDRESS_55471] version 1.1 [ 68]. Patients alive at the 
time of analy sis will be censored at the date of last disease assessment.    
The primary efficacy assessment will be best overall response as defined in Section  7.1.2.  The 
determination of antitumor efficacy will be based on objective tumor assessments made by [CONTACT_52309] 1.1 [ 68].  Investigator s will make treatment decisions 
based on these assessments.  All lesions will be classified as t arget or non- target lesions at the 
Screening visit.  Each lesion designation will be maintained through the course of the study.  
The same method and technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported 
lesion at Screening, during the study treatment pe riod, and at the End of Study visit. Imaging -
based evaluation over clinical examination is the required technique when both could be used to 
assess the antitumor effect of the treatment.  Clinical Oncology review of all tumor 
measurements is desired.  
Whene ver possible, clinical evaluation of superficial lesions should not be used as the sole form 
of measurement.  However, when necessary, color photograph with metric caliper is acceptable.  
Tumor evaluation by [CONTACT_28124] (PET) scan or by [CONTACT_52310].  
Radiological tumor assessments will be performed at screening, as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 4,Table  5, Table 6 and  Table 7), and whenever disease progression is 
suspected.  A nother tumor assessment will be performed at the End of Study Visit if an 
assessment has not been performe d within the prior [ADDRESS_55472] 1.1 as described below.  
• Measurable:  Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one  dimension (longest 
diameter to be recorded) as ≥  [ADDRESS_55473] or MRI, can be considered 
measurable lesions if the soft tissue component otherwise meets the definition of measurability previously described.  Blastic bone lesions are non- measurable. Lesions in 
previously irr adiated areas (or areas treated with local therapy) should not be selected as 
target lesions, unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g. skin nodules, 
palpable lymph nodes)  and ≥ [ADDRESS_55474] be measured with calipers.  
• Non-Measurable:   All other lesions, including small lesions and bone lesions  other than 
lytic bone lesions , leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusions , 
lymphangitis of the skin or lung, abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed 
by [CONTACT_15218], previously irradiated lesions  (unless t here has been demonstrated

 progression in the lesion) , and disease documented by [CONTACT_52311] ( e.g. by 
[CONTACT_28127]).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Tumor Measurements  
Measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions representative of all involved organs (with a 
maximum of 2 lesions per organ) should be identified as target lesions and m easured and 
recorded at Screening and at the stipulated intervals during treatment.  Target lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size (lesion with the longest diameters) and their suitability for 
accurate repetitive measurements (either by [CONTACT_52312]).  Target lesions 
may include lymph nodes with a short axis >  [ADDRESS_55475] diameter will be recorded for each target lesion  (with the exception of lymph nodes, 
where the short axis will be used) . The sum of the diameter for all target lesions at Screening will 
be calculated and recorded as the baseline sum diameter to be used as reference to further 
characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease during 
treatment.  All measurements sho uld be performed using a caliper or ruler and should be 
recorded in metric notation in millimeters.  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non- target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as “present”, “stable”, “absent”, “increased” or “decreased”.  
7.1.2. Definitions of Tumor Response  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Target Lesions  
• Complete response (CR)  is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions.  
• Partial response (PR)  is defined as  a ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the dimensions of 
the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum dimensions.  
• Progressive disease (PD)  is defined as a ≥ 20% relative increase and ≥ [ADDRESS_55476] sum of the dimensions recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  
• Stable disease (SD)  is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase t o qualify for PD taking as a reference the smallest sum of the 
dimensions since the treatment started.

confirmation of PR or CR is required.  Per RECIST 1.1, a modest increase in the size of one or 
more non- target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal  progression status.

The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (takin g as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient ’s best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.  
NOTE:  Patient s with a global dete rioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “Need for additional anti -cancer therapy/surgery”.   Every effort should be made to document the 
objective  progression even after discontinuation of treatment.   
In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the res idual lesion be investigated by [CONTACT_14239][INVESTIGATOR_52283].

 8. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
8.1. Safety Parameters  
Safety will be characterized in terms of the incidence, timing, severity (graded by [CONTACT_52314] [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], Version 
4.0), seriousness, and relatedness of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities.  In addition, 
physica l examination, vital signs, and ECOG performance status will be serially monitored.  
Laboratory safety analyses will be based on the local laboratory data, and will include 
hematology, serum chemistry (including liver and kidney function), urinalysis , serum or urine 
pregnancy testing, and coagulation profile. Serum will also be assessed for immunogenicity to 
TRC105 (including anti -product antibody  titers).  In addition, single tracing 12- lead ECGs will 
be performed  at the time -points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 4, Table 5, 
Table 6 and  Table 7) .  QT, PR and QRS  interval s and heart rate will be captured. ECG s will also 
be collected as clinically indicated throughout the study.   
8.1.1. Laboratory Safety Assessments  
Abnormal and  clinically significant laboratory tests should be recorded as adverse events.   To 
meet the definition of clinically significant, the test result generally requires a ch ange in medical 
management (e.g. new medication, unplanned treatment, additional tests, etc.).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology, Serum Chemistry, Coagulation, Pregnancy Test  
Assessments will be performed at the time  points  indicated in the Schedule of Assessments  
(Table 4, Table 5, Tab le 6 and  Table 7) and analyzed at local laboratories.  Investigator s may 
have additional blood tests performed for the purpose of planning treatment administration, or for following adverse events as clinical ly indicated.  
• Hematology: CBC with differential and platelet count. Iron studies (serum iron, ferritin 
and total iron binding capacity) . 
• Coagulation: Interna tional  Normalized Ratio (INR) will be assessed  
• Serum Chemistry: Total bilirubin, alanine transamin ase (ALT), aspartate transaminase 
(AST), alkaline phosphatase, lipase, amylase, total protein, albumin, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, magnesium, thyroid stimulating hormone and glucose  
• Pregn ancy Test: Serum or urine pregnancy tests will be performed locally on all female 
patient s of childbearing potential . Patients must be surgically sterile (i.e.: hysterectomy) 
or be postmenopausal, or must agree to use effective contraception during the study and for [ADDRESS_55477] dose of TRC105.  The definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the Principal Investigat[INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a designated associate.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis  (without microscopic analysis, unless indicated) wil l be performed at time  points  
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 4 , Table 5, Table 6 and Table  7) and analyzed

 by [CONTACT_28130].   Microscopic analysis , urine protein- creatinine ratio (UPCR) , and 24 urine 
collection for protein should be performed as clinically indicated.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Physical Examination  
A physical exam ination including, but not limited to, general appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose, 
throat, neck, heart, chest, abdomen, musculoskeletal, extremities, skin, lymph nodes, 
neurological genitourinary (as appropriate), and rectal (as appropriate) will be assess ed at 
timepoints  indicated within the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 4, Table 5, Table 6 and  Table 7) .  
The physical examination will include examination of known and suspected sites of disease.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Vital S igns  
Heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_52284]  (Table 4, Table 5, Table 6 and  Table 7 ).  
Heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_52285]105 
infusions as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and the footnotes of Table 4, Table 5, Table 6 and  
Table 7( Schedule of Assessments ).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Performance Status   
The ECOG scale will be used to assess performance status at Screening.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. ECG   
A single 12- lead (with a 10 –second rhythm strip) tracing will be used for all ECGs.  It is 
preferable that the machine used has a capacity to calculate standard intervals automatically.  
ECG will be performed at the time -points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 4, 
Table 5, Table 6 and Table 7)  and as clinically indicated throughout the study.   
8.2. Adverse Events  
All observed or volunteered adverse events regardless of suspected causal relationship to TRC105 study drug will be reported as described below.  
8.2.1. Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a trial patient  who is administered a 
drug or biologic (medicinal product); the event may or may not have a causal relationship with 
the medicinal product.  Examples of adverse events include, but are not limited to the following:  
• Clinically significant symptoms and signs including:  
o Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under trial (disease progression without worsening of signs and symptoms  assessed by [CONTACT_52315]).  
o Signs and symptoms resulting from drug overdose, abuse, misuse, withdrawal, 
sensitivity, dependency, interaction or toxicity.

injury or accident (hip fracture from a fall secondary to dizziness), the medical condition (dizziness) and the outcome of the accident (hip fracture  from a fall ) 
should be reported as 2 separate adverse events.   
o Symptoms or signs resulting from exposure in utero. 
• Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination findings that require 
clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat confirmatory test).  
• Laboratory abnormalities that meet any of the following (Note: merely repeating an 
abnormal test, in the absence of any of the below conditions, doe s not constitut e an 
adverse event.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an adverse event.) : 
o Test result that is associated with accompanying symptoms  
o Test result that requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
o Test result that leads to a change in TRC105 study drug  dosing outside of 
protocol -stipulated dose adjustments or discontinuation from the trial, significant 
additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy  
o Test result that is considered to be an adverse event by [CONTACT_52316] 
8.2.2. Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse event that meets one or more of the following criteria/outcomes is classified as serious:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening ( i.e., at immediate risk of death)  
• Requires in  patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Other important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient  or may require medical or surgical interve ntion 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  Examples of such events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependence  
or drug abuse.  
IND 131053                                      105SAR101 Protocol  Amendment #7, July 22, 2016 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Protocol    
 
Page 85 of 111  
 Serious also includes any other event that the Investigator  or sponsor  judges to be serious, or 
which is defined as serious by [CONTACT_28133].   
Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs  and symptoms of progression) 
should not be reported as SAE s unless the outcome is fatal during the trial or within the safety 
reporting period. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52286] s.  If the malig nancy has a fatal outcome during the trial or within the safety 
reporting period, then the event leading to death must be recorded as an adverse eve nt and as an 
SAE  with CTC grade  5.  
The onset date of an SAE is defined as the date on which the event initi ally met serious criteria 
(e.g., the date of admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  The end date is the date on which the event no longer 
met serious criteria (e.g., the date the patient  was discharged from a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28073] -patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , or prolongation of an existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , are considered serious.  Any initial admission, even if the duration is less than 24 
hours is considered serious. In addition, any transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care 
unit is considered serious (e.g., transfer from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor  or transfer 
from a medical floor to a coronary care unit). However, t he following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28074]:  
• Rehabilitation facility admission  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28075]  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]  
• Skilled nursing facility admission  
• Nursing home admission 
• Emergency room visit 
• Outpatient s ame day surgery /procedure  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52287]:  
o Admission for treatment of preexisting condition not associated  with the development of a new adverse event or with a worsening of the preexisting condition  
o Social admission  
o Administrative admission (e.g. for yearly physical ex am) 
o Protocol -specified admission during a clinical trial 
o Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_10244] (e.g. for elective cosmetic surgery)  
o Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures  that are not related to an SAE

• Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures , such as surgery, should 
not be reported as adverse events.  The medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an adverse event (e.g. acute 
appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as an adverse event and the appendectomy should be recorded as a concomitant treatment).  
8.3. Reporting  Adverse Events  
8.3.1. Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
The Investigator  is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events 
spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_52317].  In addition, each 
trial patient  will be questioned about adverse events at each clinic visit following initiation of 
treatment.  The question asked will be, “Since your last clinic visit have you had any health 
problems?”  
8.3.2. Adverse Event Reporting Period  
Safety information for each patient w ill be collected from the date of informed consent.  Adverse 
events occurring prior to the initiation of the study treatment with pazopanib or TRC105 study drug will be considered "baseline -signs and symptoms ”, will be recorded on corresponding case 
report  forms  and will not be retained for patients who fail screening . The adverse event reporting 
period for this trial begins when the patient has received even a portion of the first dose of pazopanib or TRC105 study drug and ends [ADDRESS_55479] event that occurs beyond the adverse event 
reporting period that the Investigator  assesses as possibly related to the investigational 
medication/product should also be reported as an adverse event.  
8.3.3. Reporting Requirement s 
Each adverse event is to be classified by [CONTACT_52318].  This 
classification of the gravity of the event determines the reporting procedures to be followed.  If an SAE  occurs, reporting will follow local and international reg ulations, as appropriate.  
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor of any event that meets one of the criteria for an SAE 
immediately upon learning of the event.  Any subsequent revisions that are made to information 
pertaining to serious suspected TRC105 adverse drug reactions ( e.g.,: change in grade etc.), 
including a change in attribution to TRC105 study drug from “not related” to “suspected adverse 
drug reaction” should also be communicated to TRACON immediately.  This notification should 
be made to:

Following notification, the Investigator will report the SAE via  the AE CRF via the data 
management system.   The initial AE CRF is to be updated with more detailed adverse event 
information within 5 calendar days of the event. In the rare event that the Investigator is  not immediately  aware of an SAE  (for example , if the 
study subject  seeks urgent medical attention  elsewhere), the Investigator  is to notify the Sponsor 
immediately upon learning of it  and document his/her first awareness.  
Each SAE should be followed until resolution, or until such time as the Investigator determines 
its cause or determines that it has become stable.  Information pertaining to follow -up of SAEs 
should also be sent to the TRACON Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
Serious a dverse events that are unexpected and associated with use of the study medication w ill 
be reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and all participating clinical sites by 
[CONTACT_52319].  For events which are fatal or life -threatening, unexpected, and 
associated with use of the investigational product, a 7- Day Ale rt Report will be submitted to the 
FDA within [ADDRESS_55481], a written report will be made no more than 15 calen dar days from the date TRACON learns of the event. 
Participating clinical sites will be notified of these event s in parallel.  
All adverse events , including SAEs, are to be reported on the adverse event CRFs.  
8.3.4. Recording Adverse Events in the Case Report For ms 
The Investigator  is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events 
spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_28138] .  In addition, each trial patient  will be questioned 
about adverse events.  All adverse events that meet the criteria s pecified in Section  8.2.1 are to 
IND 131053                                      105SAR101 Protocol  Amendment #7, July 22, 2016 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Protocol    
 
Page 88 of 111  
 be recorded on patient  source documents and on the CRFs . Adverse events should be reported 
using concise medical t erminology on the CRFs .  
8.3.5. Grading of Adverse Event Severity  
To report adverse events on the CRFs, the Investigator  will use the severity grading as described 
in NCI CTCAE ( Version 4.0) .   
Every effort should be made by [CONTACT_52320]. If the Investigator  is unable to assess severity because the term is not described in NCI 
(Version 4.0) , severity of MILD, MODERATE, SEVERE, LIFE -THREATENING, or FATAL 
may be used to describe the ma ximum intensity of the adverse event. For purposes of 
consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows:  
Table 16:  Adverse Event Grading  
Grade  Non-CTCAE Severity  Definition  
1 Mild  Does not interfere with patient ’s usual function  
2 Moderate  Interferes to some extent with patient ’s usual function  
3 Severe  Interferes significantly with patient ’s usual function  
4 Life-Threatening  Results in immediate risk of patient ’s death  
5 Fatal  Results in patient ’s death 
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event.  A severe 
event is not necessarily a serious event.  For example, a headache may be severe (interferes 
significantly with patient ’s usual function) but would not be c lassified as serious unless it met 
one of the criteria for serious events.     
8.3.6. Relationship to TRC105 Study Drug/ Pazopanib  
In this study, TRC105 study drug is given in combination with Pazopanib.  The relationship of 
an adverse event to  TRC105 study drug a nd/or  Pazopanib should be classified by [CONTACT_52321]: 
• Suspected Adverse Reaction: There is a reasonable possibility that TRC105 caused the adverse event (i.e.: there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between TRC105 
and adverse event).  
• Not Related: There is no reasonable possibility that the adverse event is associated with TRC105 study drug .  
AE’s related to TRC105 study drug or Pazopanib are considered Adverse Drug Reactions 
(ADR).  
8.3.7. Expectedness  
All TRC105 adverse events and adverse drug reactions are considered “unexpected” if it ’s not 
listed in the investigator brochure or not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpect ed (by [CONTACT_52322] 131053                                      105SAR101 Protocol  Amendment #7, July 22, 2016 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Protocol    
 
Page 89 of 111  
 greater severity) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or 
hepatitis.  Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by 
[CONTACT_14214]) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  
"Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated f rom the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned 
as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
All Pazopanib adverse events and adverse drug reactions are considered “unexpected” if it ’s not 
listed in the pack age insert or not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
"Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the package insert as occurring with a class of dru gs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with Pazopanib.  
8.3.8. Exposure i n Utero  
If any trial patient  (or partner of a trial patient) becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study or within 28 days of discontinuing the investigational medication/product, the Investigator  
must report the information to TRACON, or designee  via the Pregnancy Notification Report 
Form .  This must be done irrespective of whether an advers e event has occurred and within 24 
hours of awareness of the pregnancy.  The information submitted should include the anticipated 
date of delivery.   
The Investigator  will follow the patient  (or partner of a trial patient) until completion of the 
pregnancy  or until pregnancy termination (i.e ., induced abortion) and then notify TRACON, or 
its designee,  of the outcome within 5 days or as specified below.  The Investigator  will provide 
this information as a follow -up to the initial report.  The reason(s) for a n induced abortion must 
be specified.  
The Investigator  should follow procedures for reporting an SAE  if pregnancy outcome meets 
criteria for a n SAE  (i.e., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly 
[including that in an aborted fetus]) . 
In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at the time of birth and the Pregnancy Outcome Report Form should be completed (i .e., no minimum follow -up period 
of a presumably normal infant must pass before a Pregnan cy Outcome Report Form can be 
completed).  The “normality” of an aborted fetus can be assessed by [CONTACT_52323] -abortion laboratory findings are suggestive of a congenital anomaly.  
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that a re classified as SAE s follows:  
• “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion. 
• All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_55482] 
to causality, as SAE s.  In addition, any infant death after 1 month t hat the Investigator  
assesses as possibly related to the in utero exposure to the investigational medication 
should also be reported.

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Protocol    
 
Page 90 of 111  
 8.3.9. Follow -up of Unresolved Adverse Events  
All adverse events should be followed until they are resolved or the Investigator  assesses them as 
chronic or stable.  Any increase or decrease in adverse event grade should be recorded as a new 
adverse event.  
All serious and those non -serious events assessed by [CONTACT_52324]/pro duct should continue to be followed even after the patient ’s 
participation in the trial is over.  Such events should be followed until they resolve or until the 
Investigator  assesses them as “chronic” or “stable.”  The event should also be documented on the 
adverse event CRF.  
8.4. Safety Monitoring  
The TRACON Clinical Team will monitor safety throughout the study via the following activities:  
• Surveillance for SAEs according to regulatory guidelines  
• Routine monitoring of non- serious adverse experiences as they are recorded in the case 
report forms and the source documents at study sites  
• A formally chartered TRACON in -house Safety Review Team that includes, among other 
staff, two physicians  
• A formally chartered external Sa fety Review Team that includes t hree physicians  
• Periodic teleconferences with the Principal Investigators  to share experiences and ensure 
communication  
• Toxicity information that may affect the treatment of patients on this study will be 
promptly communicated in writing to all participating clinical sites and institutions participating in this clinical trial.

 10. STATISTICS  
10.1. Statistical Design/Sample Size  
10.1.1. Phase 1b  Statistical Design/Sample Size  
The number of patient s to be enrolled in this study will depend upon the observed safety profile, 
which will determine the number of patient s per dose level and the number of dose escalations.  
It is anticipated that up to 30 patient s will be enrolled in th e phase 1b portion of the  study.  
The probability of escalation to the next higher dose for each underlying true DLT rate is show n 
in Table 17 .  For example, at a dose level with a true DLT  rate of  5%, the re is a greater than 95%  
probability of escalating.  Conversely, for a  dose level with a  true DLT  rate of 70%, the 
probability of escalating is < 5%.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of Analyzed Study Populations  
The following study populations will be considered when reporting study results:  
• The study population for safety includes all patients receiving at least a portion of 1 
dose of TRC105.   
• The study population for PK includes also subjects with adequate data for PK 
modeling of TRC105.

Page 94 of 111  
 • The study population for efficacy will include all safety population patients who have 
baseline and follow -up tumor measurements as required for assessment b y RECIST 
1.1. 
Patients who experience DLT who receive less than the prescribed dose of TRC105 or pazopanib 
due to documented toxicity in c ycle 2 will be considered evaluable for dose escalation purposes.  
Only those patients who are deemed "ineligible" or w ho receive no therapy (i.e. no TRC105 or 
pazopanib) will be eliminated from the analysis.  Ineligible patients who receive therapy will not 
be included in the assessment of efficacy endpoints, but their data will be included in the assessment of all advers e event reporting.  
10.1.2. Phase 2  Statistical Design/Sample Size  
Sixty three patients will be treated in the phase [ADDRESS_55486] at the alpha=0.05 level of significance, a sample 
size of 63 patients will provide 86% power to detect a 50% increase in the median PFS (i.e., a 
median of 6.9 months).  These power estimates are based on the approach of Lawless [ 1]. 
Two additional phase 2 cohort s of up to 13 patients  each  with angiosarcoma will be enrolled  into 
separate cohorts, angiosarcoma cohort 1 and 2.  Angiosarcoma cohort 1: Assuming a 15% 
response rate by [CONTACT_52294], 5 responders with TRC105 alone or in 
combination with pazopanib will provide >90% confidence the true response rate is >15% (two-sided exact 90% binomial with 5 of 13 responders is 16.57 and 64.52%). Angiosarcoma cohort 2: 
Assuming a 15% response rate by [CONTACT_52294], 5 r esponders  with TRC105 in 
combination with pazopanib will provide >90% confidence that the true response rate is >15%.  
For each of the angiosarcoma cohorts, the two- sided exact 90% binomial with 5 of 13 responders 
is 16.57% and 64.52%.

 be included in the assessment of efficacy endpoints, but their data will be included in the 
assessment of all adverse event reporting.  
10.2. Data Analysis 
Descriptive statistic s (such as means, medians, standard deviations and ranges for continuous 
data and percentages for categorical data) will be used to summarize patient  characteristics, 
treatment administration/compliance, immunogenicity ( anti-product antibodies ), efficacy , 
pharmacokinetic parameters , protein biomarkers, and archival tumor tissue .  Data will also be 
displayed graphically, where appropriate.  
10.2.1. Analysis of Primary Objective  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Phase 1 b Analysis of Primary Objective  
For each cohort, DLTs will be summarized by [CONTACT_17203] (hematologic and non -hematologic) and 
by [CONTACT_6213] .  
All AEs with an onset  after initiation of treatment will be considered as treatment- emergent AEs.  
A preexisting condition that worsens during the treatment period will also be consi dered as a 
treatment emergent AE.  All AEs will be coded by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term using NCI CTCAE (MedDRA) version 4.0.  
The number and percentage of patient s with the following types of treatment- emergent AEs will 
be summarized:  comm on and serious AEs, AEs related to study medication, AEs resulting in  
study discontinuation, and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities . Non -treatment -
emergent serious AEs will be described separately.   Deaths will be reported with demographic 
information. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Phase [ADDRESS_55487] the null hypothesis that the median PFS is equal to 4.6 months.  The time -to-event distribution for PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and the 
analysis will be based on the two -sided 90% confidence interval for the median (equivalent to 
the use of a one -sided test at the alpha=0.05 level of significance).   
Additional exploratory analyses of PFS will be conducted in subgroups defined based on number 
of prior ther api[INVESTIGATOR_014] (one  versus  two or more ), histology , and endoglin expression on sarcoma 
tissue .   
For the angiosarcoma cohort s, the overall response rate and median duration of response by 
[CONTACT_393] 1.1 will be calculated and the response rate will include the two- sided 90% confidence 
interval.  
10.2.2. Analysis of Pharmacokinetics   
Peak and trough s erum TRC105 concentrations will be measured using validated ELISA 
methods .   The TRC105 pharmacokinetic data will be assessed for potential correlations with 
response, PFS, survival, adverse events, and baseline characteristics using descriptive statistics 
and models as appropriate.

It is the responsibility of the Investigator to have approval of the trial protocol, protocol 
amendments, informed consent forms, and advertisements from the IRB/IE C before potential 
patients are consented for participation on the trial. All correspondence and other evidence of 
appropriate and timely communications with the IRB/IEC should be retained in the 
Investigator/site files. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_28078]/IEC approvals sho uld also be forwarded to TRACON.  
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients.  In that event, the Investigator must notify t he IRB/IEC and TRACON in writing within [ADDRESS_55493] their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki (see ICH E6, § 2.1).  
13.3. Written Informed Consent  
The informed consent form language must be agree d upon by [CONTACT_28148]/IEC and 
must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements. 
The informed consent information must not be changed without prior approval by [CONTACT_28148]/IEC. The informed consent form  used in this trial, and any changes made during the 
course of the trial, must be approved by [CONTACT_28150]/IEC and TRACON, or designee, before use.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to give each patient full and adequate verbal and written 
information regarding the objective and procedures of the trial and the possible risks involved.  
This information must be provided to the patient prior to undertaking any trial -related procedure.  
Patients must be informed about their right to withdraw from t he trial at any time.  Furthermore, 
it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure all patients are appropriately informed before 
obtaining their signed and dated consent .  Signature s from the investigator conducting the 
informed consent discussion should also be obtained, prior to undertaking any trial -related 
procedure. Consent by a legally authorized representative is not permitted. Should an impartial witness be needed , ICH E6 requirements for impartial witnesses will apply.

 14. DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
14.1. Inspection of Records  
CRF’s are required and should be completed for each patient who receives treatment with 
pazopanib or TRC105.  Screen failure CRF’s will not be collected.    Nevertheless, records of potential patients identified and sc reened shall be retained  on site screening logs .  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole property of TRACON and should not be made available in any form to third parties without written permission from TRACON (except for authorized representatives of the  HRA and in accordance with HIPAA regulations). 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure completion and to review and approve all CRF data.    The investigator will sign off on his/her data per patient.  These signatures serve to attest that the investigator has reviewed and approved the information contained on the case report 
forms and that the information is complete, accurate, and true.  At all times, the Investigator has 
final personal responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all cl inical and laboratory data 
entered on the CRFs.    
The use of electronic CRFs (eCRFs) to capture study data using automated computerized data capture systems does not change the principles and requirements for collecting study data.  The investigator still retains final personal responsibility for eCRF data and any associated data 
pertaining to it (e.g. metadata including any record of change to the originally recorded data).  
The investigator’s signed approval of the eCRF data serves to attest that the ele ctronic data and 
all of its associated metadata (including changes) has been reviewed and accepted as complete, 
accurate, and true for each patient in the study.  
14.2. Retention of Records 
To allow for appropriate evaluations and/or audits by [CONTACT_52326], the 
Investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link records, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed consent 
forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition.  The Investigator should retain these records according to local regulations or as specified in the 
Clinical Trial Agreement, whichever is longer.   
If the Investigator relocates, retires, or for any reaso n withdraws from the study, then TRACON 
should be prospectively notified.  The study records must be transferred to an acceptable designee, such as another Investigator  or another institution.  The Investigator must inform 
TRACON of any such transfer of re sponsibilities and properly identify the person or institution 
assuming the responsibility.  The responsible investigator/institution must obtain TRACON’s 
written permission before disposing of any records.

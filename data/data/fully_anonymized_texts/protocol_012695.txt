Transcranial Continuous and Pulse Near-Infrared Light in Depression: a Placebo-Controlled Study.    1. Study Summary Protocol #: 2016P001490 (MGH)/ XXX (NYUSOM)   Study Purpose: The purpose of this study is: • To assess the antidepressant effect of the Transcranial continuous and pulse near infrared light Therapy in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD). • To assess the safety and tolerability of the Transcranial continuous and pulse near infrared light Therapy in MDD subjects • To pi[INVESTIGATOR_242544] • To pi[INVESTIGATOR_242545]: This study includes two phases of two nearly identical clinical trials, one studying the continuous light intervention and the other studying a pulsed light intervention for the treatment of depression. The two, back-to-back clinical trials differ only for the specific treatment modality of continuous and pulse near-infrared light. Each clinical trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm, sequence parallel design (SPD) study of Transcranial Light Therapy (TLT) - given in addition to current antidepressant treatments for MDD subjects.   This two-site study will randomize in its first part (PART-1) 24 MDD subjects (at 1:2 ratio) into 2 groups: continuous light (c-TLT) and sham. Sham non-responders after 6 weeks will be randomized (at a 1:1 ratio) in to c-TLT and sham. Sham responders after 6 weeks will also be randomized to ensure a chance to optimize outcome and to achieve remission at a ratio 1:1 to c-TLT and sham.   In its second part (PART-2), which will begin following the completion of PART-1– meaning after the first [ADDRESS_294241] completed their trial, the study will randomize 26 MDD subjects (at 1:2 ratio) into 2 groups: pulse light (p-TLT) and sham. Sham non-responders after 6 weeks will be randomized (at a 1:1 ratio)

Sham responders after 6 weeks will also be randomized to ensure a chance to optimize outcome and to achieve remission at a ratio 1:1 to p-TLT and sham.     The TLT groups in PART- 1 and 2 will receive either one of two types of TLT treatments: c-TLT or p-TLT with identical total energy delivered per session. Two sessions per week will be delivered for the duration of each phase.  In both clinical trials part 1 and part 2, the sham group (n=16) will receive 2 sham treatments per week for 6 weeks. At the end of the 6 weeks the sham will be re-randomized to TLT and sham. All subjects and investigators (except the study statistician) will be blind to treatment sequence assignment.    Study Population: Patients eligible for study participation will be diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) by [CONTACT_2681] (MINI) criteria.

Introduction   Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and disabling condition: 16.2 % of the US population has MDD at some point in life (Kessler et al., 2003). In the US, depression is the third leading cause of years lost because of disability or death, after cardiovascular diseases and lung and breast cancers (Michaud et al., 2006). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_242550], MDD frequently remains untreated, with only one fifth of the cases receiving adequate treatment (Kessler et al., 2003). Moreover, diagnostic and treatment rates for depression among Blacks and Hispanics are less than half the observed rates for Whites (Sclar et al., 2008). Hispanics and Blacks have significantly more concerns regarding the quality-of-life effects of medications than Whites (Huang et al., 2009). Among Hispanics stigma associated with receiving antidepressants is a prominent concern (Interian et al., 2007).  Delayed treatment for depression, not only prolongs the associated disability, but might result in lower rates of response to antidepressants (de Diego-Adelino et al., 2009).   Current standard treatments for MDD are antidepressants and psychotherapy. Antidepressants are effective but their efficacy is often limited by [CONTACT_242563] (Lingam and Scott, 2002). Psychosocial interventions are usually preferred in primary care (Backenstrass et al., 2006), especially among minorities (Givens et al., 2007), but they are typi[INVESTIGATOR_242551]-effective due to the higher initial costs of providing psychotherapy (Barrett et al., 2005).  In addition, counseling and psychotherapy are limited in the community by [CONTACT_242564] (e.g. Spanish).   Because of the limitations of medication treatment and talk-therapy in the approach to depression, new treatment approaches are required especially in primary care and in the community, where several minorities are underserved.  We propose a novel treatment approach for depression based on the use of the continuous and pulsed Transcranial Light Therapy (TLT). The treatment consists in exposing bilaterally the frontal brain to the TLT, which may enhance ATP production in depressed subjects.  Major Depressive Disorder has been associated with deficits in brain bioenergetic metabolism. In an experimental model of depression, the mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_35226] (the cellular site for energy production) was found to be inhibited by [CONTACT_35234] (Rezin et al., 2008). Depressed subjects have also significantly lower production of ATP (an energy vector) in their muscle tissue and greater incidence of deletions in their mitochondrial DNA (Gardner et al., 2003). Data from magnetic resonance spectroscopy in subjects with MDD showed that response to the augmentation of a selective serotonin

                             Page 9 of 45                                                    CONFIDENTIAL                                                                          .     reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with triiodothyronine (a thyroid hormone) is associated with restoration of the levels of ATP in the brain (Iosifescu et al., 2008).   The TLT is a non-ionizing electromagnetic wave. The TLT is invisible, penetrates the skin and skull into brain tissue, is non-invasive (Zhang et al., 2000), is minimally dissipated as thermal energy and is mainly absorbed by [CONTACT_35232] (Mochizuki-Oda et al., 2002). The benefits of TLT are wavelength specific. A mitochondrial enzyme, the Cytochrome c oxidase, is the primary chromophore for the TLT with wavelength around 830 nm (Eells et al., 2003). The energy absorbed by [CONTACT_35233] c oxidase leads to increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, through the respi[INVESTIGATOR_35226]. Ultimately, the increased ATP leads to increased energy metabolism for the cell, and it is hypothesized that a signaling cascade is also activated promoting cellular plasticity and cytoprotection (Eells et al., 2003).    These properties of the TLT have led to novel therapeutic applications in neurology. In acute ischemic stroke subjects, acute treatment with the TLT led to significantly better outcome as compared to sham (Lampl et al., 2007). These results were confirmed in a different cohort of stroke patients with mild to moderate severity of illness (Zivin et al., 2009). Both studies on stroke subjects showed no significant difference in rate of adverse events, as well as serious adverse events, between the TLT and sham treated subjects (Lampl et al., 2007; Zivin et al., 2009) [See section 4.17]. The TLT has also been used as a treatment of alopecia (Leavitt et al., 2009) and in animal models for methanol-induced retinal toxicity (Eells et al., 2003). The near-infrared light is already widely used for non-invasive assessment of brain function (replacing fMRI in studies of infants and young adults, under the name [CONTACT_35255]) underscoring the relatively low risk of TLT. The major risk of TLT when using a laser as the light source is associated with accidental retinal exposure, when beams are projected through the lens, with increased risk of macular lesions (Kim et al., 2007). In our study, we will have multiple protections to safeguard against this risk [See section 4.17].  Preliminary uncontrolled studies in [ADDRESS_294246] shown that the TLT is safe, effective and well tolerated (Schiffer et al., 2009; Cassano et al., 2015). Our study offers a larger sample size, a cleaner design with placebo-control (also called Sham treatment), and tests the efficacy and tolerability of repeated sessions of TLT. Because the TLT is a non-ionizing radiation, multiple sessions, likely required for the treatment of depression, are expected to be safe.   The advantage of the TLT treatment approach as compared to pharmacotherapy is that adherence can be easily monitored (since treatment is delivered at the clinic) and the patient is not required to ingest any substance. It is possible that the exposure to TLT might be more acceptable than use of medications among some minorities. As compared to talk-therapy, the TLT therapy has the advantage of not requiring providers with specific cultural expertise or second language proficiency. Our study will contribute to answer the question of whether TLT has an antidepressant effect and whether it is acceptable in minority populations, thus justifying further studies and investments.

ELATED-1 was  a proof of concept study of 3 weeks of TLT (Neurothera - class IV laser, wavelength 808 nm; irradiance 700 mW/cm2; fluence of 84 J/cm2; total energy 2.4 kJ per session for 6 sessions) (Cassano et. al. 2015). All subjects (n=4) were treated with TLT. Baseline mean HAMD-17 scores for depression decreased from 19.8±4.4 (SD) to 13±5.35 (SD) after treatment (p=0.004).    ELATED-2 was a double-blind, randomized, controlled study of 8 weeks of TLT (Omnilux New U - LED, 830 nm; 36.2 mW/cm2; up to 65.2 J/cm2; vs. sham for 16 sessions). At endpoint, the mean HAMD-17 for depression decreased of 11.7±7.5 points (TLT, n=9) vs. 5.3±7.0 points (sham, n=9) (p=0.04); the differences were even more pronounced in the completers sample as HAMD-17 decreased of 15.7±4.4 (TLT, n=6) points vs. 6.1±7.9 points (sham, n=7) (p=0.01).   These findings suggest that TLT could be a novel intervention for patients with MDD. Both the Laser study (ELATED-1) and the LED study (ELATED-2) were conducted by [CONTACT_242565]. ELATED-3 (the present submission) will test for the first time pulse light therapy (p-TLT) in a comparable population of MDD subjects.    The LiteCure® PhotoBioModulation-1000 (TPBM-1000) device to be used in this study does not require FDA approval. In fact, the TPBM-1000device used in this study is considered a non-significant risk device because:  • TPBM -1000 dose does not exceed the Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) for skin – Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH),  21CFR1040.10 and 21CFR1040.11;  • TPBM-1000 is substantially equivalent to the OmniLux New U device (used in ELATED-2 at MGH), which the FDA has already categorized as a non-significant risk device;    • TPBM-1000 differs from the OmniLux New U  only in that it provides an additional site of irradiation – treatment is delivered to EEG sites FP1 and FP2 in addition to F3 and F4 on the forehead; • currently FDA-cleared LED devices are typi[INVESTIGATOR_125984]-the-counter and are considered safe to use without professional supervision.  3.2 Overview of LiteCure Laser System LiteCure® TPBM-1000 is a new device with the flexibility to safely deliver either continuous or pulsed light: c-TLT or p-TLT, or sham.  The TPBM-1000 device is configured for in-office use.

TPBM-1000 delivers NIR light output at 830 +/- 30 nm.  The NIR output is invisible to the naked eye, thus, the device includes visual and/or audible indicators of light emission, and is designed to deliver light to EEG sites: Fp1, Fp2, F3 and F4, covering a total surface active treatment area, of 35.8 cm2[(11.52 cm2x2) + (6.38 cm2x2)]  with an average irradiance of 54.8 mW/cm2 and an average fluence of 65.8 J/cm2.  While the average fluence (energy density) is comparable to the Omnilux New U, the treatment area is significantly less for the TPBM-1000 (Omnilux New 28.7 cm2 x2, which results in less total energy delivered per session of 2.3 kJ (compared to up to 3.7 kJ for the Omnilux New U).    TPBM-1000 devices will be fabricated to deliver either c-TLT, p-TLT, or Sham. In simple terms, in either TLT mode the TPBM-1000 device delivers therapeutic NIR energy; in sham the device will not deliver any light energy. The apparent behavior (i.e. the performance/output of all visible and audible indicators) of the device in any of the three programmed treatment modalities will be identical, ensuring the study is blinded to the operator. In addition, because of the low average irradiances delivered in either c-TLT and p-TLT modes the patients will not experience any heating sensation ensuring the study is double-blind.   The TPBM-1000 devices consists of a source of light, mounted on a cap, attached to a console that controls the light delivery modality: c-TLT, p-TLT, or Sham.   3.3 Overview of Rationale for Cognitive Tasks, and for neuroinflammatory laboratory tests.   Cognitive Tasks The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are uniquely situated to play a critical role in learning, executive functions, attention and inhibition. Studies have shown that DLPFC exhibits significant plasticity during the learning process, in which neuronal activity changes to dynamically encode and recode procedural memories once a sensory motor association has been made. The purpose of this study is to determine whether TLT can be used to change the speed at which subjects learn and perform in cognitive tasks.  TLT applied to prefrontal regions of the brain implicated in visual-motor learning processes can enhance neural plasticity and improve behavioral performance.  Neuro-inflammatory laboratory tests Animal and clinical research suggest that the inflammatory immune system contributes to MDD. Post-mortem gene expression profiling on tissue samples from Brodmann area 10 (BA10 – prefrontal cortex) have shown that MDD is characterized by [CONTACT_242566] (Shelton et al., 2011). In a case-control study, Simon and colleagues (2008) found that antidepressant-naive MDD subjects had significant elevations in the following cytokines and chemokines when compared to healthy controls: MIP-1α, IL-1a, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, Eotaxin, GM-CSF, and IFNγ. 
     PROTOCOL 2016P001490 12/19/2017   
                             Page 12 of 45                                                    CONFIDENTIAL                                                                          .     Although IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine, the results suggested that the elevated levels of this IL-10 were likely induced in response to the overall elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (Simon et al., 2008). In a review of the research on inflammation in MDD, Raison, Capuron, and Miller (2006) proposed that pro-inflammatory cytokines might cause brain abnormalities that are characteristic of MDD. Indeed, animal research has shown that IL-1 mediates chronic depression in mice by [CONTACT_242567] (Raison et al., 2006; Goshen et al., 2007). One pro-inflammatory cytokine that may be of particular relevance to depression is CSF IL-6 (IL6 measured in cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872]). In a recent report, patients with MDD had significantly higher CSF IL-6 levels compared to healthy controls; CSF IL-6 levels were significantly higher than in the serum and there was no significant correlation between CSF and serum IL-6 levels (Sasayama et al., 2013). These findings are consistent with a prior report showing a positive correlation between CSF IL-[ADDRESS_294247] correlation found in violent suicide attempters (Lindqvist et al., 2009). One report in a smaller sample of depressed patients has shown that CSF IL-6 was lower or comparable to healthy controls (Levine et al., 1999).   Near-infrared light and red light (600-1600 nm) decreased synovial IL-6 gene expression (decreased mRNA levels) in a rat model of rheumatoid arthritis (Araki et al., 2011). In another study, NIR (810 nm) used as a treatment for pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis decreased production of the following pro-inflammatory cytokines: TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-8 (Yamaura et al., 2009). Khuman and colleagues (2012) showed that transcranial NIR improved cognitive function and reduced neuroinflammation as measured by [CONTACT_242568]1+ activated microglia in brain sections from mice that had suffered a traumatic brain injury. Finally, NIR (970 nm) has been found to be an effective treatment for inflammatory-type acne (Barolet and Boucher, 2010). In summary, it is reasonable to predict that transcranial NIR treatment would likewise have an anti-inflammatory effect in patients suffering from MDD.  2. Investigational Plan 4.1 Rationale The specific aims of this study are: 1. To assess the antidepressant effect of the continuous and pulse Transcranial Light Therapy in depressed subjects. 2. To assess the safety and tolerability of the continuous and pulse Transcranial Light Therapy in depressed subjects 3. To pi[INVESTIGATOR_242552]-inflammation of the continuous and pulse Transcranial Light Therapy in depressed subjects  Rationale for the use of this device in individuals with MDD: Different devices have been used in the study of near-infrared radiation (NIR) treatment effects in humans. We decided to use a new device, created by [CONTACT_242569] 2016P001490 12/19/2017

This study will include up to 50 subjects randomized at a 1:2 ratio into 2 groups: Transcranial Light Treatment (TLT) and sham.    All subjects will receive 2 TLT/sham treatments per week for [ADDRESS_294248] 6 weeks; during weeks 7-12 subjects in the sham group will be re-randomized to either TLT or to sham. All subjects and investigators (except the study statistician) will be blind to treatment sequence assignment.   Treatment group assignment will be decided by [CONTACT_242570]. Each study site (MGH and NYUSOM) will have one Litecure device, which will recognize the randomization codes generated by [CONTACT_4305]. For each randomized subject a sealed envelope with treatment assignment will be available at the respective study site.  Both subjects and study staff will be blind to the treatment group assignment. The Sham treatment consists in applying all the procedures for the delivery of the TLT, while actually delivering no light. The blinding of the sham will be effective because the radiation is not visible and because the active therapy (continuous or pulsed) will not produce any patient discernable difference from sham, e.g., skin warming. The sham treatment will mimic the TLT procedure. The treatment will be bilateral and applied to the frontal areas with two application sites on the left side and two on the right side [left and right forehead centered on EEG sites on F3, F4, Fp1, Fp2]. Energy is administered with a radiation wavelength of 830 nm. The duration of irradiation is 20 minutes at each application site (the 4 sites are irradiated at the same time which is equivalent to 20 minutes of total time), while the entire session is estimated as lasting 25 minutes or less (Schiffer et al., 2009) (Lampl et al., 2007, Zivin et al., 2009). The additional [ADDRESS_294249] the necessary protections (e.g. goggles), to inspect the subject’s skin, to set the TLT devices and to give time to rest to the subject after the irradiation. TLT treatment will only be administered by [CONTACT_126011] (i.e. MDs) who are on study staff. All staff who deliver treatment must pass training that is approved by [CONTACT_242571]/or NYUSOM Laser Safety Committee. The duration of irradiation will be decreased if clinically indicated, based on tolerability to 15 min as needed. The treatment will follow these specifications: wavelength 830 nm; average irradiance 54.8 mW/cm2; average fluence of 65.8 J/cm2 (consistently with parameters used in the ELATED-2 study at MGH with the device Omnilux New U). 
     PROTOCOL 2016P001490 12/19/[ADDRESS_294250]’s ability to comprehend and communicate is compromised (per the assessment of the Investigator), local regulations pertaining to Informed Consent signatures should be followed.  Subjects will be recruited, via screenings, advertisements and postings. Study participants will also be recruited via internet-based advertisements, e.g., Craigslist, Clinical Trials @ Partners, the study sites websites, RSVP for Health (which will also generate listserv emails to Partners employees, regarding research studies in need of volunteers), etc.    Participants who contact [CONTACT_242572].   4.3.[ADDRESS_294251] consent (without any element of coercion) to use a double-barrier method for birth control (e.g. condoms with spermicide) if sexually active.  A pregnancy test will be performed at the Screening Visit.   4.3.3 Criteria for Enrollment – listed on pages 5-[ADDRESS_294252] numbers 101 through 99 (to account for screen failures and drop-out before randomization). 4.5 Sample Size The ELATED-3 Study is expected to include 50 subjects with analyzable data (at least [ADDRESS_294253] randomization).    
     PROTOCOL 2016P001490 12/19/[ADDRESS_294254]’s participation in this investigation will be considered confidential. The Investigator will need to ensure that all subjects’ anonymity will be maintained on all documentation submitted to Litecure Inc by [CONTACT_126014] (eliminating or “blacking out”) each subject's name [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or other identifying information. The identifying information will be replaced with the subject's study number and initials. The investigational site is not to provide to Litecure Inc information such as subject’s telephone numbers, home address, personal identification numbers such as passport numbers, etc. Care must be taken by [CONTACT_242573] a subject’s identity.  Documents associated with the study that are not intended to be submitted to Litecure Inc (e.g., signed Informed Consent Forms) must be kept in strict confidence by [CONTACT_737].  Only study site personnel, authorized Litecure Inc personnel, and regulatory authority inspectors will have access to these confidential files.  4.7 Study Visits Study visits occur at MGH Depression Clinical and Research Program (DCRP) in [LOCATION_011] and at the NYUSOM Nathan S. Kline Institute (NKI) site in Orangeburg, NY.   The study involves screening, treatment, and a series of follow-up visits.   Screening Visit (Week -1)  The Principal Investigator (PI) at the site or a Sub-investigator will assess patients against the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  If a patient appears to qualify and agrees to participate in the study, then the patient will undergo the informed consent process prior to initiation of any study-specific activities. Screening Case Report Forms (CRFs) will be completed and subjects who qualify to participate in the study will proceed to the first Treatment Visit 1. If the subject does not meet entry criteria, the Investigator will document the subject’s ineligibility for study participation and complete the appropriate CRFs.    Treatment Visits – Visits 1-24 (Weeks 1-12)  There are 2 treatment visits per week for 12 weeks. This visit-schedule applies both to the PART-1 (TLT-c) and PART-2 (TLT-p) phase of the study. Treatment Visit [ADDRESS_294255] of all subjects being randomized to the TLT and Sham groups and undergoing baseline assessments including HAM-D-17, QIDS-C, ASQ and cognitive tasks prior to treatment.    Treatment Visits 1-12 will include various assessments as detailed in Section 4.8 and in Attachment 1.    Follow-Up Visit – Visit 25 
     PROTOCOL 2016P001490 12/19/[ADDRESS_294256] assessments including HAM-D-17, QIDS-C, ASQ, and cognitive tasks at follow-up Visit 25 (Week 13).  4.8 Detailed Study Visits 4.8.1 Screening Visit (Week -1) Purpose The purpose of the Screening Visit will be to determine the eligibility of patients for participation in the ELATED-3 Study.  Procedures At this visit subjects will receive a psychiatric evaluation, will be consented for the study, and will be screened for presence of MDD using the MINI.  The HAM-D-17, QIDS-C, SDQ and CGI will be used to assess severity of depressive symptoms, the ASQ will be used to assess anxiety symptoms, and the C-SSRS will be used to assess suicidality. The ATRQ will be used to assess resistance to treatment. The MoCA will help determining cognitive impairment that would contraindicate study participation.  Routine laboratory tests (including urine collection for Urine Analyses, Urine Tox Screen, and Urine Pregnancy Test) and complete physical exam including vitals and weight will be performed at screen; the tests will be processed by a laboratory at MGH and at NYUSOM.   About 15cc ± 5cc (15 mL) of blood is drawn for laboratory safety tests. To confirm a patient is healthy enough to participate a complete blood test with differentials, thyroid stimulating hormone test, a comprehensive14-metabolic panel test, and a c-reactive high sensitivity protein test are conducted on screening day. An additional 2-[ADDRESS_294257] for all the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Subjects are allowed into the study if they did not fail more than two antidepressants in the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Subjects could decide to continue their antidepressant during the study or to taper it off prior to the baseline visit.     4.8.2 Treatment Visits – Visits 1-24 (Weeks 1-12) The Treatment Sessions will occur twice weekly for twelve weeks at MGH Depression Clinical and Research Program (DCRP) in [LOCATION_011] and at NYUSOM Nathan S.

     PROTOCOL 2016P001490 12/19/[ADDRESS_294258] will comfortably lie down on an exam bed or sit on recliner. The sites of application of TLT (left and right forehead) will be inspected for any possible skin lesions (e.g. laceration or signs of inflammation) which would contraindicate the treatment. During treatment sessions the office will be kept completely dark and a warning sign will be hanged at the office door. The staff will be provided training on basic safety procedures relative to the use of the device.  The trained staff administering the TLT will use utmost care to never shine the light in or near the eyes of the subject safety goggles will be selected based on the TLT biophysical properties, in accordance to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines. The delivery of the TLT is expected to last 20 min total (simultaneous application on the left and right forehead). The subject will be asked to rest for five minutes after the delivery of TLT. The skin at the sites of the application will be inspected again prior to dismissing the subject. A log with the dates of treatment delivery per each study subject will be kept at MGH DCRP ([LOCATION_011]) and at NYUSOM NKI, NY.   [IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Visit 1  During Treatment Visit 1, subjects will be randomized to either TLT or Sham.

At the end of the study, we will refer the subjects to their counselor and /or psychiatrist. If the CGI-S increases more than [ADDRESS_294262] will be counseled to start (or switch if already on) an FDA-approved antidepressant medication. Subjects who are deemed actively suicidal and are in imminent danger will be escorted to the local psychiatric Emergency Department at MGH or NYUSOM for evaluation and subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; they will also be terminated from the study. If the subject is appropriate for outpatient monitoring, the subject will be followed with frequent appointments outside the study.  Each subject will have the Investigator’s contact [CONTACT_35248], if needed.   4.9 Scales & Forms We will offer clinical interviews and study forms in English. All scales will explore the past 7 days except for M.I.N.I (life-time), TSRQ (study duration). • (M.I.N.I) – The M.I.N.I. is a short structured diagnostic interview, developed jointly by [CONTACT_242574], for DSM and ICD psychiatric disorders. With an administration time of approximately 15 minutes, it is designed to meet the need for a short but accurate structured psychiatric interview for clinical trials. According to researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) Division of Clinical and Treatment Research, the M.I.N.I. is a fully validated and more time-efficient alternative to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID) (Sheehan et al., 1998) • Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology- Clinician Rated Scale (QIDS-C) – This is a brief (16-item) clinician-rated inventory of core depressive symptoms such as sleep, depressed mood, appetite, concentration, suicidal ideation, interest, energy, psychomotor retardation or agitation.

The HAM-D aims to quantify the degree of depression in patients who already have a diagnosis of major depression.  Questions focus on neurovegetative and other depressive symptoms experienced over the past [ADDRESS_294263]; they differ only in the number of questions included.  The standard form which is generally used in research studies is the 17-item Hamilton D (HAM-D-17). Answers to questions are rated on a scale of 0-4 or 0-2, with higher scores indicating more severe pathology. Scores on the HAM-D-17 typi[INVESTIGATOR_242554]: a) not depressed = 0-7; b) mildly depressed = 8-13; c) moderately depressed = 14-18; d) severely depressed = 19-22; e) very severely depressed = 23 and over.  • Symptoms of Depression Questionnaire (SDQ) – This is a comprehensive measure of depression that includes the assessment of symptoms in the anxiety–depression spectrum. It assesses irritability, anger attacks, and anxiety symptoms together with the commonly considered symptoms of depression. Analysis of the factor structure of the SDQ identified 5 subscales, including one in the anxiety–depression spectrum, with adequate internal consistency and concurrent validity (Pedrelli et al., 2014).  • Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire (ASQ) – This, is a 17-item self-report questionnaire measuring the frequency and intensity of 17 symptoms of anxiety, including nervousness, worrying, irritability, trouble relaxing, insomnia, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, somatic symptoms, and impairment in functioning due to anxiety.  • Clinical Global Impressions – Severity and Improvement (CGI-S, CGI-I) – These two instruments are scored 1-[ADDRESS_294264]'s overall clinical status. They measure, based on history and scores on other instruments: (a) depressive severity (CGI-S) and (b) clinical improvement (CGI-I). • Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) for suicidal ideation and behaviors: an instrument endorsed by [CONTACT_242576]. This instrument systematically tracks suicidal ideation and behavior (e.g., suicide attempts, wish to die, thoughts of suicide, plan and intent) (Posner et al. 2007). • Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE-SI) – The SAFTEE is a commonly used instrument originally developed by [CONTACT_242577] a self-report instrument. The version of the scale that we plan to use is the same used by [CONTACT_15747]-center, NIMH-sponsored CO-MED trial, and it examines in a systematic fashion all possible treatment-emergent side effects and probes specific adverse symptoms, including suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and self-injurious behavior.  • Adverse Events Form- the Adverse Events Form captures any adverse event (serious or otherwise) specifically related to the application of the TLT. This form will help to determine if the side effects of the TLT are too great for a participant to continue in the study.

It measures perceived difficulties in cognitive abilities (e.g., memory, attention, and decision making) or in the application of such abilities to everyday tasks (e.g., planning, organizing, calculating, remembering and learning). • [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_125991] (MGH-SFI) -This is a patient-rated self-report outcome measure that quantifies sexual dysfunction into 5 functional domains (“interest in sex,” “sexual arousal,” “ability to achieve orgasm,” “ability to maintain erection” [males only], and “sexual satisfaction”).  • The TLT Self-Report Questionnaire (TSRQ) – An open-ended questionnaire focusing on potential inconveniences and discomforts from the TLT. It will be offered after at least two TLT sessions have been delivered. • Concomitant medications form – This form will be completed at every TLT study visit, including the screening visit, as a safety-monitoring tool.  • Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): This is a 10-item rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. This measure will be used to assess entry criteria (Nasreddine et al. 2005). • The Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale (CADSS): This is a 23-item clinician-administered scale for the assessment of dissociative symptoms. The CADSS can measure the amount of change in participants dissociations from the beginning of a study or treatment to the end. The CADSS consists of both subjective and objective questions. For a person in dissociation the experience is subjective, and although, dissociation is an individual’s cognitive process, dissociation is still observable by [CONTACT_39785]. It will be measured for the “past 6 weeks” at baseline, and after 6 and 12 weeks into the study (Bremner, et al., 1998).  • The [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH) Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (ATRQ): a scale used to determine treatment resistance in major depressive disorder (MDD). The ATRQ examines the efficacy (improvement from 0% [not improved at all] to 100% [completely improved]), and adequacy (adequate duration and dose) of any antidepressant treatment in a step-by-step procedure. • The Perceptions of Blinding Questionnaire (PBQ): The Perceptions of Blinding Questionnaire (PBQ): the PBQ is a self-report questionnaire to determine the degree to which the participant believes s/he is receiving the treatment or the sham.  • PEG Assessment: The PEG is a self-report questionnaire with three questions used to assess pain severity and interference with daily life.

Among other relevant  brain regions, the pre-SMA and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex are activated in this 10-[ADDRESS_294265] basis. Briefly, the MSIT presents a string of 3 numbers to subjects, which can be different combinations of 0,1,2,3 in which 2 numbers are the same and one is different (e.g. 100, 323, 221). Subjects are asked to identify what number is different by [CONTACT_242578] 3 buttons available in the response box. Some trials will be congruent (e.g. 100) and some incongruent (010), depending on the position of the number that is different. The test also involves emotional stimuli to enhance the discriminative power of the task. The emotional stimuli are images that have been used in other studies involving patients with MDD at MGH and have been approved by [CONTACT_1201] (i.e. protocol number 2011P002821). Because emotional stimuli are involved in the task, the clinician will provide a verbal warning prior to the task and debrief with the patient immediately following.  Analyzing the brain response to these congruent and incongruent trials has been shown to robustly identify these brain networks and regions involved in executive functions at the individual level in healthy and patient populations (Bush et al., 2006).  Pattern Recognition Task: The pattern separation task is a high throughput behavioral task that captures the input-output transformation function characteristic of pattern separation processes (Stark et al., 2013). For example, if you park your car in the same lot everyday, but not the same space, pattern separation is thought to be involved in the process of you finding your car everyday despi[INVESTIGATOR_242555] a different space; this may be dysfunctional in people with depression. In this task, patients are shown a series of every-day objects (e.g., a car, garden tool, food, etc.) and are asked to identify the objects as being indoor or outdoor objects. Immediately after this, a second part of the task is started in which the patients are shown another series of objects. They are asked to call the objects as “old” if they have seen the objects before in the task, “new,” or “similar.” As previously done by [CONTACT_242579], (2013) a third of the objects in the testing phase are “old”, “similar” and “new”. Identifying a “similar’ object correctly conveys pattern separation, whereas, incorrectly identifying it as “old” conveys pattern completion. By [CONTACT_242580] a function of object similarity, we can generate an input-output transfer curve. This task will serve the purpose of rapid assessment of putative changes in pattern separation.  Voice Pattern Recognition Task: The content and quality of vocal production may be a valuable marker of health information. Vocal production, for example speech, contain rich information in both the content (linguistic) and quality (non-linguistic) characteristics of sound information.   Previous research has used vocal samples to predict important markers of cognitive and affective state. From the non-linguistic information of speech, including but not limited to the 
     PROTOCOL 2016P001490 12/19/[ADDRESS_294266] with high accuracy the cognitive load of an individual at a given moment. For example, vocal quality changes during increases in cognitive load (Le et al. 2011); cognitive load may reflect increasing difficulty of a mental task or suppressing automatic reading response to name [CONTACT_242599] a text instead of the word of the text (MacLeod 1991). Similarly, researchers have used vocal quality to predict negative affect in the context of depression (Cummins et al. 2015). The features used to predict cognition and affect can be extracted from small samples of speech under various conditions, but to apply them for the prediction of health information, the collection of these data must be scalable and easy to use. On a smartphone or tablet at the study site, participants will be administered a series of voice tasks via a mobile application (‘app’). The devices used for the voice tasks are study team devices, i.e. are not the participant’s personal devices. Additionally, no personal identifiers will be collected, shared, or stored through the mobile application. At study visits 1, 7, 13, 19 and 25 (screening, baseline, treatment/sham, and follow-up), participants will be given one or more voice task (see below) to be recorded on the smartphone or tablet. These tasks include:  i. A Stroop task. In the Stroop task, the participant is instructed to read out loud the color of the word presented on the screen. The research study application then presents words in succession. In a low cognitive load condition, the color of the word matches the text of the word (the word "blue" in blue-colored text), and the participant says the color. In a higher cognitive load condition, the color of the word does not match the text of the word (the word "purple" in yellow-colored text), and the participant must inhibit the automatic reading of the text in order to correctly name [CONTACT_242600]. Sometimes the text of the word is also emotionally salient ("happy" or "angry") or will vary in size, shape, color, font, duration on the screen, position on the screen, saturation, brightness, or contrast.  ii. A digit span task (DST). In the DST, participants are shown and read a sequence of numbers, ranging from 1 to 12 digits depending on difficulty condition. They are then sometimes read a brief sentence (eg. "the dog ran through the woods."). They are then asked to speak out loud the digits that were presented earlier and/or the sentence.    iii. A sentence/passage reading. In this portion, participants are shown text and asked to read it out loud. This ranges from holding a single syllable (eg. "ahhhh"), to a diadochokinetic task (repeating syllables like “PA, TA, KA”), to reading a simple sentence (e.g. “the horse trotted around the field at a brisk pace,” or “Okay Google”), to reading a longer passage.   iv. Free response portion. In this portion, participants are given a specific prompt or may select a prompt from a list of options, for example, "how is the weather today?" or "describe your morning." The participants are instructed to freely respond to the prompt for a set period of time ranging from 30 seconds to 3 minutes.   Together, these tasks present a varied set of speech and sound data for each participant.

REDCap is a free, secure, HIPAA compliant web-based application hosted by [CONTACT_242582], Enterprise Research Infrastructure & Services (ERIS) group. Web-based surveys rely on a study-specific data dictionary defined by [CONTACT_242583]/The Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center EDC Support Staff. These support staff will then oversee the automated export of study data from REDCap to a relational study database in Microsoft Access 2000, allowing for systematic data querying and checking.  Self-report measures will be completed by [CONTACT_112503] a computer, directly into REDCap, thus minimizing errors due to data entry.  For clinician-administered measures, all clinicians will enter responses directly in REDCap.  To minimize missing data for self-report forms, we will program missed question warnings in REDCap that will alert participants in real-time if they inadvertently skip a question.  Participants may then go back and answer any missed questions, or, if they intentionally skipped questions, they may ignore the warning message and continue answer the remaining questions.  We will also program real-time range checks in REDCap that generate error messages if a value outside the acceptable range is entered for a given field.  To ensure confidentiality, data will be identified in the database only by [CONTACT_18022], visit number, and date of visit. By [CONTACT_46773], the information can be considered ‘de-identified’ and therefore compliant with the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information (“Privacy Rule”) of the Health Insurance Portability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Any data that is transmitted electronically will be fully encrypted and password protected. Subjects’ names will not be entered into the database; each will be uniquely identified only by [CONTACT_31258]. Consent forms, any hard copy PHI, and any study measures that are completed on paper will be kept and filed in locked office cabinets.   4.12     Data Management The study biostatisticians ([CONTACT_242601]) will oversee management of the study database. The principal investigators, [CONTACT_242602] and [CONTACT_242603], are ultimately responsible for the quality of the data collection and overall conduct of the study, and directly supervise the study coordinators and data management staff at MGH and NYUSOM, respectively. Data management will include clinician and patient rated assessments (see assessments), screening data, fidelity data, visit adherence data and rater reliability data and safety reporting. Weekly reports from REDCap will monitor subject enrollment, completion, attrition, and individual subject progress as well as the completion of critical assessments. Additional reports will be done as needed to monitor baseline characteristics, protocol adherence, and other issues of interest.  All measures that are completed on paper will be entered by [CONTACT_126022], and a two pass verification system will be used to minimize any data entry errors. All records in

The RA initially entering data will save each record entered as Unverified (at which point it will appear as a yellow circle in the Record Status Dashboard). A second RA at each site will then go into each unverified record, compare each entered value against the paper source document, make any corrections, and then re-save the record as Verified (at which point it will appear as a green circle in the Record Status Dashboard). The color coding system built into REDCap readily allows for identification of unverified records. 4.[ADDRESS_294269] undergone specific training to criteria in the use of the study measures. Any new raters will undergo training.  Periodically, all study clinicians will co-rate an audiotape during a staff meeting. These duplicate ratings will be used both to calculate kappa coefficients and for supervision. Differences between raters will be discussed during supervision to identify reasons for disagreement and improve inter-rater reliability. These procedures will help us ensure that study clinicians refine their diagnostic skills and will also establish common guidelines for ongoing use in diagnostic decision-making. Inter-rater agreement will be assessed via evaluation of recordings of diagnostic interviews. Kappa coefficients will be calculated every 12 months. If reliability falls below criteria (ICC ≥ 0.8 for QIDS-C), study clinicians will be retrained. 4.14       Randomization Procedure and Blinding of the Study The study statistician will provide the two study sites (MGH and NYUSOM) randomization codes (block randomization) which will be pre-loaded in the Litecure devices (TPBM-1000). The randomization codes will differ from the study ID assigned at the time of screening. The randomization codes will be two digit only to prevent any confusion. Study ID and randomization code will be matched at the time of the randomization in the subject binder and in a master list of study subjects at each site. In order to administer the treatment the study investigator will enter twice the randomization code in the Litecure instrument. In the event that a medical emergency will necessitate unblinding of a subject’s treatment modality, the site’s Principal Investigator (or Subinvestigator in the event that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_242556]) will be able to retrieve the unblinding information from on-site sealed envelopes with codes paired to corresponding treatment.  Since this is a double-blind, sham-controlled study, measures have been taken to assure that the integrity of the blinding of the treatment modalities remains intact. The two means of assuring that the treatment modalities will not be disclosed to either subjects or site research personnel include automated LED control sensor based on the temperature of the skin. Also,  he introduction of a rating scale for subjects and raters to assess their best guess on treatment assignment.

TPBM-[ADDRESS_294271] of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Adverse Device Effects, including Anticipated Adverse Device Effects and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects.   • Adverse Event is defined as any untoward/undesirable clinical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a subject using a device and/or product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An Adverse Event can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a device product, whether or not considered 
     PROTOCOL 2016P001490 12/19/[ADDRESS_294272]. Only abnormal laboratory values that are deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_242584]. • Serious Adverse Event is defined as any untoward/undesirable adverse experience that results in any of the following outcomes:  1) death; 2) a life-threatening adverse experience; 3) inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 4) a permanent/persistent or significant disability/incapacity or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 5) important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  • Anticipated Adverse Device Effect is defined as any adverse effect related to the device or procedure, which is identified in the protocol. • Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects is defined as any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  4.17.[ADDRESS_294273]’s safety by [CONTACT_242585]’s own comfort during treatment application.

Patients will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_242586][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a member of his staff at any time between visits concerning adverse events or worsening of symptoms. If at any study visit the subjects’ clinical condition is significantly worsened from baseline (operationalized as the clinical global impression severity score, CGI-S, of 6 or higher) or if a subject becomes actively suicidal with intent and/or plan, based on the C-SSRS scale and/or the clinical interview, the subject will be offered to start an antidepressant medication. If the subject were deemed at imminent danger as a result of suicidality, s/he would be discontinued from the study and referred to appropriate clinical treatment (see 4.8.4 Termination).   The two site Principal Investigators (Drs. Cassano and Iosifescu) will have bi-weekly conference calls (which will include study RAs); during these conference calls they will discuss all Adverse Event reports to identify any safety concern, based on such concerns they will be able to decide temporary discontinuation of study enrollment, modifications of the study protocol, or to terminate the study.

This also includes any event that a study investigator or the DSMB judges to impose a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution.  For purposes of this study, all SAEs will be required to be reported to the DSMB, regardless of any judgment of their relatedness to the study device.

The event itself, however, may be of relative minor medical significance.  The intensity of Adverse Events is assessed as mild, moderate or severe according to the following index scale:  Mild The Adverse Event is transient, requires no treatment, and does not interfere with the subject’s daily activity. Moderate The Adverse Event introduces a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and may interfere with daily activities, but is usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212]. Severe The Adverse Event interrupts the subject’s usual daily activity and requires systematic therapy or other treatment.  If the Adverse Event is of such intensity in the Investigator’s judgment that it warrants withdrawal from the study, the subject should be withdrawn from treatment. The subject should be given appropriate care under medical supervision until symptoms resolve.    The relationship of an Adverse Event to the study device or procedure will be graded as follows: None The Adverse Event is not associated with the study device use. Remote The temporal association is such that the study device is not likely to have had an association with the observed Adverse Event. Possible This causal relationship is assigned when the Adverse Event:  a) Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from device use, but  b) Could have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. Probable This causal relationship is assigned when the Adverse Event:  a) Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from device use;  b) Abates upon discontinuation of the treatment;  c) Cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11176]’s clinical state.

All attempts to contact [CONTACT_242589].  4.[ADDRESS_294283] may include but are not limited to the following: The TPBM-1000 emits light with a longer wavelength than the human eye can see. The TPBM-1000 output is less than the maximum permissible exposure (MPE). The staff will be provided training on basic safety procedures relative to the use of the device. The staff administering the TLT will be careful not to operate the TPBM-[ADDRESS_294284]’s skin. Both the subject receiving the TLT and the study clinician present in the TLT delivery room will wear protective eyewear in the form of goggles or eye pads.  The goggles provided with the TPBM-[ADDRESS_294285]’s eye.  Since they are reusable they should not be shared between subjects.  The eye pads are disposable and should be discarded after use.  The eye pads use an adhesive to adhere to the subject’s eyelids so there is potential for an allergic reaction.  Failure of the TPBM-1000, resulting in the cessation of investigative therapy can cause: 1. No adverse event to our knowledge 2. Unforeseeable adverse events  Delivery of the infrared energy to an inappropriate site, such as directly over the open eye, is not recommended and could pose a risk to the subject.  Application of the TPBM-1000 may result in mild thermal sensation of warmth during the use.  The temperature of the skin is well below the level for thermal damage.  Based on human clinical trial experience to date, each adverse event listed below has been reported with TLT: 1. Application Site Erythema 2. Application Site Pain 3. Application Site Discomfort 4.

We will minimize this risk by [CONTACT_35252].  We will also discontinue any subject who develops active suicidal ideation during the course of the study (C-SSRS) and is deemed at imminent danger; we will then arrange for appropriate levels of care and standard antidepressant treatment (see 4.8.4 Termination).  Manic switches are possible adverse events and will be closely monitored during antidepressant treatment as well.  Our tight schedule of clinical study visits will allow early recognition of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation or prodromal hypomanic signs.  Subjects who develop mania or hypomania will be discontinued and provided appropriate level of care.   Answering detailed questionnaires may create a mild degree of inconvenience for the subjects.

This feasibility study is expected to randomized 50 subjects total across two sites, 1/3 of whom will receive 12 weeks of TLT and 2/3 of whom will receive 6 weeks of sham followed by [CONTACT_242590] (50%) or TLT (50%) for [ADDRESS_294289] of the Transcranial continuous or pulse Light Therapy in depressed subjects. Hypothesis 1: We anticipate that TLT will decrease QIDS-C and HAM-D [ADDRESS_294290] size of the antidepressant action of Transcranial continuous and pulse Light Therapy, separately.   B.  To assess the safety and tolerability of the Transcranial continuous / pulse Therapy in depressed subjects Hypothesis 2: We predict that the Transcranial continuous and pulse Light Therapy will be safe and well-tolerated by [CONTACT_242591], as assessed by [CONTACT_242592]: SAFTEE-SI and ADVERSE EVENTS FORM.  We anticipate differences in between TLT and Sham treatment as concerns side-effects.     Secondary Aims include the assessment of neuro-inflammation and cognitive circuitry. We predict that TLT decreases plasma levels of IL6, IL8, TNF-α, IL-1β more than sham. TLT will also improve attention, inhibition and executive functions more than sham.      5.[ADDRESS_294291] 100 subjects to sign informed consent, including screen failures. Assuming that 1/2 will screen fail this will lead to randomization of 50 subjects. In PART-1 (CW), we will have a n=[ADDRESS_294292] randomization 2:1 (sham:NIR), which will result in 16 subjects receiving sham and 8 subjects receiving NIR. We then assume 70% non-response to sham which leads to 11 sham subjects who are non-responders and who will undergo the 2nd randomization (week 6). Assuming a dropout rate of 24% before week 6, we anticipate that 9 subjects from the sham group will be eligible for the 2nd randomization 1:1 (sham:NIR). This 2nd randomization (week 6) will result in approximately 5 subjects receiving sham and 4 subjects receiving NIR. According to the Sequence Parallel Comparison (SPD) design the data from the 1st randomization (week 0 to 6 of the trial) and the data from the 2nd randomization (week 6 to 12 of the trial) can be pooled resulting in a total of 16+5=21 available sham subjects and 8+4=[ADDRESS_294293] estimated >80% power to detect a significant difference (p≤0.05) in depression outcome based

Eligible patients will be randomized to two groups with a 1:2 ratio, to ensure adequate sample in phase 2 (week 6-12). Patients in the first group (TLT) will receive TLT (contionus in PART-1 and pulse in PART-2) at both phases (week 0-12). Patients in the second group (Sham) will receive sham at phase-1 and will undergo a 1:1 ratio randomization to either TLT or sham in phase-2 (week 6-12), respectively. Patient retention rates during phase-1 of the trial are assumed to be 76%, based on our earlier study ELATED-2. The treatment differences from phase-[ADDRESS_294296].   For the primary efficacy analysis, all patients in phase 1 will be compared, together with sham non-responders from phase 2 (sham non-responders are defined as those patients who failed to achieve a 50% decrease in their QIDS-C score at visit 13).   A.  Antidepressant effect of the TLT:  To test the significance of the antidepressant effect of TLT (in both PART-1 and PART-2) we will use a T-test for mean differences of two related measures and will primarily look at QIDS-C and HAM-D 17  total score mean change on TLT and compare it with the QIDS-C and HAM-D 17 total score mean change on Sham, the significance will be set at a p-value ≤0.05. The time-points to estimate the mean differences are baseline and week 6 for all subjects and for subjects non-responders to sham who are re-randomized also week 6 and week 12. Rates of responders according to the CGI-Improvement (score 1 or 2) will be estimated at week 6 and 12 of the study (no statistics planned). Both completer analysis and intent-to-treat analysis will be performed to analyze the severity of depression at endpoint. Patient attrition and dropouts

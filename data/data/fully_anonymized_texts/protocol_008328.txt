Technologically Enhanced Coaching (TEC): A Program for Improving Diabetes Outcomes 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
Protocol 
6/4/12 
Measures and Data Collection 
Overview  
Measurement will occur at baseline, 6 months (at the completion of the intervention), and 12 months 
after enrollment. Variables chosen for measurement are based on our conceptual framework (Section 
3.4.1). At baseline, 6 months, and 12 months, patients (pa rticipants and peer mentors) will complete a 
written survey and assessments of A1c and blood pressure. Patients will receive $[ADDRESS_951788] semi -structured telephone interviews at 6 months of a purposive sample of participants 
and mentors in both study arms (choosing a sample with high rates of contact [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a sample with low rates of contact). Using standard qualitative methods for identifying key themes in participant’s 
experiences with this new program, we will identify central themes from these interviews associated with the success of the peer relationships and in meeting intervention goals. Participants and peer 
mentors in the peer mentor + iDecide arm will be asked about their experiences with iDecide and how 
use of the program affected their subsequent contacts and activities (e.g., setting and meeting ‘action 
plan’ goals, effectively raising questions and concerns with PCPs). Quantitative information about use of the IVR system will be collected via computerized records that the system maintains of all contacts with 
dates and time durations of all contacts as well as of attempted contacts. To assess peer mentors’ 
experiences, we will conduct semi -structured interviews with a purposive sample of peer mentors with 
differing rates of participation (e.g., those who made regular contact [CONTACT_701194]. those who did not).

.2  Description of Measures by [CONTACT_74205] 1: Test the effectiveness of a technology -enhanced peer coaching (TEC) program in improving 
glucose control relative to peer support alone. At baseline, 6 months, and 12 months, a trained staff 
member will measure patients' A1c, using a Bayer DCA 2000+ analyzer, a portable  analyzer producing 
A1c assays in approximately six minutes using finger stick blood samples. These assays have a test 
coefficient of variation (CV, measure of test precision) <5% as required by [CONTACT_701195] A1c l evels.[78] The DCA 2000 is reliable, easy to use, and much less 
burdensome to patients than venous blood draws. Our team has familiarity with the DCA 2000 from our 
prior studies.[40,56] To ensure quality control, venous A1c samples will be drawn from 5% of 
participants and analyzed at the Detroit VA’s lab.  
For our “usual care” observed group, we will use CDW data to measure A1c levels. More than 85% of diabetes patients who meet our eligibility criteria receive A1c testing at recommended intervals, which should ensure adequate numbers of patients with follow -up A1c levels in our control sample. For those 
with missing A1c data, we will use several approaches to examine possible biases (see section 3.7.5).  
Ai
m 2: Assess the impact of the intervention on blood  pressure and medication adherence as well as on 
key patient- centered outcomes, including patients’ satisfaction and involvement with care, perceived 
social support, and diabetes -specific quality of life. These measures will be assessed at baseline, 6 
mont hs, and 12 months. We will measure blood pressure using an Omron® automatic blood pressure

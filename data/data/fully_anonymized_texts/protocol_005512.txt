2PRÉCIS
Background: 
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) presents a clinical challenge because it is aggressive and 
incurable with chemotherapy. Therefore, novel treatment approaches are needed.  
MCL has overexpression of NF-kappa B (NF- B), a transcription factor that affects cell 
growth and survival, and cyclin D1 that affects cell cycle and growth. These proteins 
appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of MCL.  
Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor that inhibits NF-B and cyclin D1, has demonstrated 
activity in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL.  
Dose-adjusted-EPOCH-R has excellent activity in MCL, with a complete response (CR) 
rate of 92%, but patients eventually relapse. 
Objective:
Determine the PFS and OS of DA-EPOCH-RB followed by [CONTACT_151180]:
Diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma
No prior treatment except for local radiation or a short course of steroids for control of 
symptoms, 
Age > 18 years old
Adequate major organ function unless impairment is due to lymphoma.
Study Design: 
To assess the clinical activity and biological effects of bortezomib, patients will initially 
receive one cycle of bortezomib alone with sequential tumor biopsies for microarray 
analysis.  
All patients will then receive Dose-adjusted (DA)-EPOCH-RB for [ADDRESS_174175] a PR, this will be followed by [CONTACT_151181] x 18 months, or to observation, followed by [CONTACT_151182]. 
This study has as a primary goal, to describe progression free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival of early bortezomib maintenance versus observation following induction with 
bortezomib followed by [CONTACT_151183]-EPOCH-RB. Important secondary goals are to assess 
response and toxicity to bortezomib alone or DA-EPOCH-RB, to evaluate time to 
progression after receiving bortezomib following progression on an observation arm, and 
to assess the biological effects of bortezomib on untreated MCL.

1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
Hypothesis: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), an aggressive B-cell neoplasm, has only recently 
been recognized as a distinct biologic entity and compromises approximately 2.5 to 4% of all 
NHL in the U.S. It occurs more commonly in the elderly, has a male predominance and typi[INVESTIGATOR_151150]. The clinical behavior of MCL tends to be aggressive but can vary 
from relatively indolent to very aggressive. Although the disease responds to chemotherapy, it is 
Abbreviated Title:  EPOCH-R-B +/- B Maintenance in MCL
Version Date:   11/08/2021
7usually incurable and responses are of short duration with a median survival of 3 – [ADDRESS_174181] 
demonstrated event-free survivals ranging from 8 to 19 months and disease-free survivals 
ranging from 19 to 25 months, depending on the series (Table 1).

The use of autologous stem cell transplantation and high dose therapy in the treatment of newly 
diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma is controversial. Khouri et al tested an aggressive regimen of 
hyper-CVAD and high-dose methotrexate/cytarabine followed by [CONTACT_151185].8  Among the 25 previously 
untreated patients, the overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) at 3 years were 92% 
and 72% respectively.  In contrast, the EFS at 3 years was 17% in the previously treated patients.  
Although the results are impressive in the untreated group, the results from the previously treated 
group suggest that this combination approach can salvage few if any patients and is therefore 
unlikely to be curative in the untreated group. A recent study published by [CONTACT_151186]. 
prospectively evaluated intensive chemotherapy and high-dose chemotherapy plus rituximab for 
newly diagnosed advanced stage mantle cell lymphoma. Of [ADDRESS_174182] CR/PR following CHOP.  Nineteen (68%) patients relapsed at a 
median of [ADDRESS_174183] CR/PR, 5 had relapsed.  With a median follow-up 
of 24 months, DFS and OS were estimated to be 31% and 62%, respectively, at 4 years, 
indicating that high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell support cures few if any 
patients.  
Thus, with anthracycline based chemotherapy or high dose chemotherapy, MCL is largely 
incurable and therefore new treatment approaches are needed. Dose-adjusted EPOCH in 
combination with rituximab has good activity in mantle cell lymphoma with a CR rate of 92%. 
However, most patients eventually have disease relapse and thus additional approaches to 
treatment of this disease are worth investigating with the hope of improving time to treatment 
failure and curability rates.

8MCL is characterized by t (11; 14) (q13; q32) resulting in over-expression of cyclin D1 which is 
involved in regulation of the cell cycle - it controls G1 progression and G1 – S transition. NF-
B, a transcription factor involved in immune and inflammatory cellular responses affecting both 
cell growth and survival, appears to have an important role in the pathogenesis of aggressive 
lymphoid malignancies including MCL.11 Therefore, therapeutic strategies that target NF-B, 
such as  proteasome inhibition by [CONTACT_151187], possibly in combination with conventional 
chemotherapy, are worthwhile investigating.
In eukaryotic cells, the ubiquitin proteasome pathway plays an essential role in the degradation 
of most intracellular proteins. The 26 S proteasome degrades regulatory proteins involved in cell 
cycle control. Some targets of this degradation are p53, p21, NF-ĸB, IĸB and bcl-2. The NF-
B/Rel transcription factors integrate diverse intracellular signaling pathways that are activated 
during normal cellular differentiation and during immune responses. 12-15 NF-B dependent 
transcriptional activity is mediated by [CONTACT_151188]-B family members (p50/105, p52/100, 
p65/RelA, RelB, or c-Rel), and is regulated by [CONTACT_151189] IB family of inhibitors, 
principally IB, which binds to NF-B dimers and retains them in the cytoplasm. Upon 
phosphorylation by [CONTACT_151190], IB  is targeted for ubiquitination and proteasomal 
degradation, and released NF-B dimers can translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription 
of target genes.13  NF-B target genes encode diverse mediators of immune responses as well as 
regulators of cellular proliferation and apoptosis.  The expression of these target genes varies, in 
part, with the cell type in which NF-B is activated.  NF-B activity is also critical for normal B 
cell development and survival.16 NF-B activation by [CONTACT_151191]-limited, 
but constitutive nuclear NF- B has been found in several types of cancers, raising the possibility 
that NF-B may contribute to malignant transformation or progression11,17.  For example, in cell 
lines and Hodgkin’s disease, mutations of IB  gene result in its functional inactivation and the 
accumulation of p50/RelA heterodimers in the nucleus.17-21  In other types of lymphoid 
malignancies, constitutive NF-B activity can occur occasionally due to translocations involving 
the NF-B2 gene that disrupt its carboxy terminus,22,[ADDRESS_174184] is evidence that NF- B transcriptionally activates bcl-2.
The ability of NF-B to inhibit responses to cancer therapeutic agents  may contribute to the 
poor outcome of MCL, and inhibition of NF- B can synergize with chemotherapy to kill tumor 
cells.[ADDRESS_174185] of 
these,28 it is demonstrated that inactivating NF-B in MCL lines with the  proteasome inhibitor 
Bortezomib or the PIBα inhibitor Bay 11, blocks MCL cell growth leading to tumor cell death. 
The mechanism of blocking cell growth was via cell cycle arrest and induction of cell death, both 
of which involve inhibition of constitutive NF-B activation. This cell cycle arrest was 
associated with inhibition of cyclin D1 expression. A second study 11 looked at  proteasome 
inhibition in MCL lines that closely resembled blastic MCL with deletion of p15 and p16 
(Granta 519) and mutation of P53 (NCEB)). In this study, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were 
accompanied by [CONTACT_151192] p21 in both cell lines.  These results suggest 
Abbreviated Title:  EPOCH-R-B +/- B Maintenance in MCL
Version Date:   11/08/2021
9that inhibition of NF-B, through proteasome inhibition by [CONTACT_151187], may induce tumor cell 
apoptosis or decrease bcl-[ADDRESS_174186] of these,30 the dose of 
Bortezomib was 1.5mg/m2 IV on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 every 21 days. Of 15 evaluable patients, 
8/15 patients responded with 3 CRs and 5 PRs (RR 53%). In the second study,31 using a dose of 
1.3mg/m2 IV twice weekly for 2 out of every 3 weeks, there was a PR rate of 38.5% (5 of 13 
evaluable patients). 
1.2.1 Bortezomib background  
VELCADE® (bortezomib) for Injection is a small molecule proteasome inhibitor developed by 
[CONTACT_24312], Inc., (Millennium) as a novel agent to treat human malignancies.  
Bortezomib is a dipeptidyl boronic acid derived from leucine and phenylalanine, which is a 
potent and reversible inhibitor of the proteasome. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is essential 
for the degradation of most short- and long-lived intracellular proteins in eukaryotic cells. The 
26S proteasome, universally present and abundant in all eukaryotic cells, is an ATP-dependent 
multicatalytic protease that is central to the degradative pathway. The 26S proteasome functions 
not only in a housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_151151] a critical 
regulator of multiple cellular processes by [CONTACT_151193], transcription factor activation, apoptosis, and cell trafficking that are substrates for 
proteasome-mediated degradation. The proteasome is the final degradative enzyme involved in 
an important catabolic pathway for many intracellular regulatory proteins including NF-B, p53, 
and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27.  Notably, Bortezomib induces apoptosis 
in cells that over express bcl-2, a genetic trait that confers unregulated growth and resistance to 
conventional chemotherapeutics.  Targeting the proteasome has emerged as a novel approach to 
cancer therapy. Bortezomib is currently approved by [CONTACT_72563] (US FDA) and it is registered in Europe for the treatment of multiple myeloma 
patients who have received at least one prior therapy and have demonstrated disease progression 
on the last therapy.
1.2.2 Bortezomib Nonclinical Toxicity 
Single-dose IV toxicity studies were conducted with bortezomib in the mouse, rat, dog, and 
monkey to establish the single-dose maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  The MTDs were 0.25 
mg/kg (1.5 mg/m2) and 0.067 mg/kg (0.8 mg/m2) in the [ADDRESS_174187] sensitive species, rat and 
monkey, respectively.  Repeat-dose multi-cycle toxicity studies of 3 and 6 months in the rat and 
9 months in the monkey, each with 8-week recovery periods, were conducted to characterize the 
chronic toxicity of bortezomib when administered by [CONTACT_151194].  The MTD in the 6-month rat study was 0.10 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m2) and the key 
target organs were the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, hematopoietic and lymphoid systems.  The 
MTD in the 9-month monkey study was 0.05 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m2) and the key target organs were 
the GI tract, hematopoietic and lymphoid systems, peripheral nervous system, and kidney.  Full 
or partial reversibility was observed for each of the toxicities described to date.  
In general, the nature of the toxicity of bortezomib is similar across species, and target organs of 
toxicity in animals have been largely predictive of human toxicity.  The toxicity of bortezomib in 
animals is characterized by a steep dose-response with mortality seen at dosages above the MTD.  
The cause of death at acutely lethal dosages is considered to be related to cardiovascular (CV) 
Abbreviated Title:  EPOCH-R-B +/- B Maintenance in MCL
Version Date:   11/08/[ADDRESS_174188] effects on CV function occur only at acutely lethal dosages and are 
abrogated by [CONTACT_91821].  Additional detailed information regarding the nonclinical 
pharmacology and toxicology of bortezomib may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure
1.2.3 Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Bortezomib 
The clinical pharmacology characterization of bortezomib has been determined from phase 1 
studies in subjects with solid tumors and hematological malignancies, and confirmed in phase 2 
studies in subjects with multiple myeloma.  In solid tumor subjects, the mean terminal 
elimination half-life of bortezomib was 9.06 hours.  The mean area under the curve (AUC) (0-24) 
after the first dose (1.3 mg/m2) of bortezomib was 48.2 hr*ng/mL.  The average clearance of 
bortezomib following a single 1.3 mg/m2 dose was 49.0 L/hr.  However, the AUC increased to 
81.0 hr*ng/mL after the third dose in the first cycle as a result of a reduction in systemic 
clearance to 28.2 L/hr with a consequent increase in elimination half-life to 54.[ADDRESS_174189] (inhibition of 20S 
activity) occurred within 1-hour post dose.  At the therapeutic dose of 1.3 mg/m2 in subjects with 
multiple myeloma, the mean proteasome inhibition at 1-hour post dose was approximately 61%.
The time course of proteasome inhibition in subjects is characterized by [CONTACT_151195], followed by [CONTACT_151196] 6 to 24 hours to within 50% of the pretreatment activity.  On the Day 1, 4, 
8, and 11 schedule, variable (10%–30%) levels of proteasome inhibition have been observed at 
next scheduled dosing.  In theory, this advantage allows cells to recover proteasome activity for 
normal cellular housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_91780].
The relationship between bortezomib plasma concentrations and proteasome inhibition can be 
described by a maximum effect (E max) model.  The E max curve is initially very steep, with small 
changes in plasma bortezomib concentration over the range of 0.5 to 2.0 ng/mL relating to large 
increases in the percent inhibition (0–60%).  After that, a plateau occurs where marginal 
increases of proteasome inhibition are observed in spi[INVESTIGATOR_151152].
1.2.[ADDRESS_174190] been treated with 
bortezomib, including patients treated through Millennium-sponsored clinical trials, Investigator-
Initiated Studies, the US NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), and with 
commercially available drug.  Bortezomib has been commercially available since 13 May 2003.
The overall goal of the Millennium phase 1 program was to determine the MTD and dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT) of bortezomib in a number of therapeutic settings involving subjects with 
various advanced malignancies.  In a Phase I trial in patients with refractory hematologic 
malignancies, the MTD for a twice weekly for 4 weeks of a 42-day cycle was 1.04 mg/m2/dose, 
Abbreviated Title:  EPOCH-R-B +/- B Maintenance in MCL
Version Date:   11/08/2021
11with DLTs of thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, fatigue, and malaise (Orlowski et 
al., 2002).  The toxicity was greatest during the third and fourth weeks of therapy. In the 3-week 
schedule of bortezomib monotherapy (4 doses, given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day 
treatment cycle), the DLT occurred at 1.56 mg/m2/dose (3 subjects with Grade 3 diarrhea and 1 
with peripheral sensory neuropathy).  Therefore, the MTD at this schedule was 1.3 mg/m2/dose.  
In a 35-day treatment cycle with 4 weekly doses of bortezomib monotherapy, the MTD was 1.6 
mg/m2/dose and DLT included hypotension, tachycardia, diarrhea, and syncope.  
In phase 1 clinical studies, anti-tumor activity was reported in subjects with NHL, multiple 
myeloma, Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia, squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx, 
bronchoalveolar carcinoma of the lung, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer.  The safety and 
efficacy of bortezomib in subjects with multiple myeloma were investigated in two phase 2 
clinical studies, studies M34100-024 (subjects with first relapse) and M34100-025 (subjects with 
second or greater relapse and refractory to their last prior therapy).  In M34100-025, [ADDRESS_174191] 2 previous treatments 
received bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day treatment cycle. The 
European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) response criteria, as described by 
[CONTACT_149617] (Blade et al., 1998) were utilized to determine disease response.  CRs were observed in 
4% of subjects, with an additional 6% of patients meeting all criteria for CR but having a 
positive immunofixation test.  PR or better was observed in 27% of subjects, and the overall 
response rate (CR, PR and minor response [MR] combined) was 35%.  Seventy percent of 
subjects experienced stable disease or better.  
The phase 3 study (M34101-039), also referred to as the APEX study, was designed to determine 
whether bortezomib provided benefit (time to progression [TTP], response rate, and survival) to 
patients with relapsed or refractory MM relative to treatment with high-dose dexamethasone.  
The study was also designed to determine the safety and tolerability of bortezomib relative to 
high-dose dexamethasone, and whether treatment with bortezomib was associated with superior 
clinical benefit and quality of life relative to high-dose dexamethasone. A total of 669 patients 
were enrolled and 663 patients received study drug (bortezomib: 331; dexamethasone: 332).  
Patients randomized to bortezomib received 1.3 mg/m2 I.V. push twice weekly on days 1, 4, 8, 
and 11 of a 3-week cycle for up to eight treatment cycles as induction therapy, followed by 1.3 
mg/m2 bortezomib weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 5-week cycle for three cycles as 
maintenance therapy. Patients randomized to dexamethasone received oral dexamethasone 40 
mg once daily on days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of a 5-week cycle for up to four treatment 
cycles as induction therapy, followed by [CONTACT_149618] 40 mg once daily on days 1 to 4 
followed of a 4-week cycle for five cycles as maintenance therapy. The European Group for 
Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) response criteria, as described by [CONTACT_149617] (Blade et al., 
1998) were utilized to determine disease response.  There was a 78% increase in TTP for the 
bortezomib arm. Median TTP was 6.2 months for the bortezomib arm and 3.5 months for the 
dexamethasone arm (P<.0001). CR (complete response) + PR (partial response) was 38% with 
bortezomib vs. 18% with dexamethasone (P.0001). CR was 6% with bortezomib vs. 1% with 
dexamethasone (P<.0001). The CR + nCR rate was13% with bortezomib vs. 2% with 
dexamethasone. In patients who had received only one prior line of treatment (bortezomib: 132; 
dexamethasone: 119), CR + PR was 45% with bortezomib vs. 26% with dexamethasone 
(P=.0035). With a median 8.3 months of follow-up, overall survival was significantly longer 
(P=.0013) for patients on the bortezomib arm vs. patients on the dexamethasone arm. The 
probability of survival at one year was 80% for the bortezomib arm vs. 66% for the 
Abbreviated Title:  EPOCH-R-B +/- B Maintenance in MCL
Version Date:   11/08/2021
12dexamethasone arm, which represented a 41% decreased relative risk of death in the first year 
with bortezomib (P=.0005). In patients who had received only one prior line of treatment, the 
probability of survival at one year was 89% for the bortezomib arm vs. 72% for the 
dexamethasone arm, which represented a 61% decreased relative risk of death in the first year 
with bortezomib (P=.0098). (Richardson et al., 2005)
The optimal schedule for bortezomib is unclear. To further investigate the schedule, a study was 
recently presented at the American Society of Hematology in 2005. 
Patients were indolent lymphoma were randomized to bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 
11 of a 21-day cycle (Arm A) or 1.6 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 35-day cycle (Arm B) 
for up to 15 weeks (5 and 3 cycles in arms A and B, respectively). Starting from day 1, rituximab 
375mg/m2 was administered weekly for 4 weeks. In this study, 81 patients were enrolled. At data 
reporting 46 (23 each arm) had received study drug, and 42 (20 Arm A, 22 Arm B) were 
evaluable for response.   The median bortezomib dose received was 15.9 mg/m2 (61% of max. 
expected) in Arm A, and 19.0 mg/m2 (99% of max. expected) in Arm B. Overall response rates

arms with grade [ADDRESS_174192] obscured differences in outcome. 
Because the twice weekly schedule has been shown to be effective in mantle cell lymphoma, it 
will be used in the maintenance arm of this study.   Because this is a maintenance and not 
treatment schedule, patients will receive bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 weekly on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of 
an 8-week treatment cycle.   
1.2.5 DA-EPOCH-bortezomib background 
We recently commenced a study, using bortezomib in combination with DA-EPOCH in patients 
with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell NHL. To reach the optimal dose of Bortezomib 
used in conjunction with DA-EPOCH, there was an accelerated dose escalation of Bortezomib 
with doses of 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 1.7 mg/m2. On the basis of tolerability and feasibility, the 1.5mg/m2 
dose was the dose selected for Phase II evaluation with DA-EPOCH and was administered on 
days [ADDRESS_174193] included 
nausea/vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhea, constipation, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, fever and 
neutropenia and neuropathy.  
Preliminary experience with DA-EPOCH-RB has been obtained in the first [ADDRESS_174194] grade 2 neuropathy.  These results indicate that the acceptable phase II dose of 
bortezomib with DA-EPOCH-R should be reduced to 1.3 mg/m2. The apparent higher toxicity in 
the current study compared to our previous study may in part be due to the administration of Part 
A where patients receive bortezomib 1.5 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, 11 for analysis of translational 
endpoints and response. Because bortezomib neurotoxicity is cumulative, neurotoxicity during 
DA-EPOCH-RB will be higher due to bortezomib exposure on Part A. Hence, to reduce 
neurotoxicity, Part A will administer bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2 for days 1 and 4 only (times 
during which translational endpoints are obtained).  As noted above, maintenance bortezomib

11) but will be repeated at 8-week intervals. 
Toxicity of DA-EPOCH-B from our phase I study are shown in the table below. 
1.2.6 DA-EPOCH-R background 
DA-EPOCH-Rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) is a novel combination of chemotherapy and the CD-
20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab. DA-EPOCH in combination with rituximab has produced a 
92% complete remission rate in patients with newly diagnosed mantle-cell lymphoma.33 
This study sets out to evaluate the combination of EPOCH-Rituximab-Bortezomib induction 
followed by [CONTACT_151197]. We plan to 
accrue 80 patients on this study.  This design will allow an assessment of the efficacy of 
maintenance Bortezomib on time to treatment failure and will provide additional information on 
the efficacy of Bortezomib at the time of relapse, if this were to occur.  In a recent study of 
EPOCH-R followed by [CONTACT_151198] 26 untreated MCL patients, 92% achieved a complete 
remission following EPOCH-R alone.33  Additionally, there was 24-month median response 
duration and 100% survival, indicating that EPOCH-R is a highly effective treatment platform.  
However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_151153], 40% of patients on the study have progressed, suggesting that 
this approach will not be curative in most patients.  Based on the biology of MCL, the addition of 
Bortezomib to EPOCH-R may further increase the cytotoxicity of the regimen.  Additionally, 
given the over-expression of cyclin D1 in MCL, which is believed crucial in driving cells from 
the G1 to the S phase, it is worthwhile targeting this pathway through long-term  proteasome 
inhibition.  Hence, we propose using maintenance Bortezomib for 18 months following induction 
with EPOCH-R-Bortezomib.  Maintenance therapy has previously been shown to be highly Grade2%ToxicityProfiles:DA-EPOCH-Bortezomib*

to cyclic treatment. We plan to incorporate micro-array analysis of tissue from patients with 
MCL and correlate gene expression signatures to other molecular and histological markers and to 
survival and response. This will be achieved by [CONTACT_151200] a “window of opportunity” 
in which all patients will receive a single cycle of Bortezomib before induction with paired 
tumor samples for microarray and CT scan assessment of tumor response. Recent work by [CONTACT_151201]’s group has shown that the proliferation gene expression signature [CONTACT_832] a quantitative 
integrator of oncogenic events that predicts survival in MCL and may provide an important

The genetic aberrancies which characterize lymphoma are manifested functionally by [CONTACT_151202].  The technology to profile these protein pathways has evolved through the 
development of reverse phase protein microarrays (RPPMs)35-37.  This approach allows not only

The small molecule inhibitor of the proteasome, bortezomib, promotes apoptosis; this effect 
appears to be due in part to prevention of NF-B activation, but the precise mechanisms have not 
been fully established38.  Furthermore, the proteasome degrades proteins with a wide variety of 
cellular functions other than regulation of apoptosis (e.g. cell cycle proteins).  While previous 
studies have shown clinical promise of bortezomib in lymphoma, including MCL39, the key 
signaling pathways modulated in responders and non-responders have not been characterized.  
Because bortezomib acts by [CONTACT_151203], its principal effects are expected 
to be observed at the protein level.
In this portion of the study we will profile the activation status of cell signaling pathways in 
MCL before and after bortezomib therapy using RPPMs.  Tissue biopsies will be processed by 
[CONTACT_151204] (approximately 0.5 cm3 for open biopsies or 1 core for needle biopsies) in OCT.  
Tumor lysates will be immobilized in serial dilutions on a solid phase.  Antibodies will be 
applied in solution phase and binding will be detected by [CONTACT_151205].

The goal of these analyses will be (1) to identify protein profiles (including activation status of 
specific signaling pathways) from pre-treatment specimens that correlate with response to 
bortezomib in MCL; and (2) to determine differences between pre- and post-treatment protein 
profiles that correlate to response.  These data will be helpful in:
(1) Development of future clinical trials of individualized therapy, including:
a. Selective use of bortezomib in patients with appropriate pre-treatment protein 
profiles.
b. Selective continuation of bortezomib (vs. change in therapy) based on 
proteomic correlates of response.
(2) Identification of activation of undesirable (e.g. anti-apoptotic) pathways as an 
inadvertent effect of proteasome inhibition, particularly in non-responders.  This 
information could be used to:
a. Suggest targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_151154].
b. Direct development of novel, more selective, proteasome inhibitors.

resulting products amplified using ligation-mediated PCR and hybridized onto a custom-

like p53 and NPM1.  We hypothesize that aberrant epi[INVESTIGATOR_151155]. Integrative genomic approaches combining 
array- based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and gene expression have identified

specifically designed for measuring small amounts of DNA and RNA.

Symptomatic ileus/constipation may occur. Because the severity of constipation is dose related, 
it is usually unnecessary to stop the vincristine altogether. Every effort should be made to not 
unnecessarily reduce vincristine doses.  Ileus/constipation is usually worse on the first cycle, so 
prophylactic bowel care is essential.  If vincristine dose is reduced for this toxicity, it can often 
be increased to full dose on subsequent cycles without recurrence of severe ileus/constipation. If

25C- Biopsies will be obtained in all patients (who agree to the optional biopsy) with safely accessible 
lymph nodes. Snap freeze and store tissue biopsies for translational studies. In patients with 
leukemic MCL treated at the NCI, up to 8 additional blood samples (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] [ADDRESS_174224] dose 2 of bortezomib) of 20-40cc each may be obtained to 
collect lymphocytes for analysis of gene expression on microarray and proteomic analysis. In 
these patients a cbc/diff will be obtained at the time of research blood collection. The amount of 
blood that may be drawn from adult patients for research purposes shall not exceed 10.5 mL/kg 
or [ADDRESS_174225] or second bortezomib dose instead of the timed blood draws. Tissue 
samples are to be stored at -80º C and shipped on dry ice.
D- Clinical PET scans may be performed at other time points throughout this protocol if the 
investigator deems it medically necessary.
E- If research biopsies are obtained, research PET scan will be within 24 hours of the second 
biopsy. If no research biopsies are obtained, the PET scan may be omitted. If a patient has 
evidence of tumor reduction between day 8 and 21, a repeat PET scan may be done at the end 
of Part A cycle.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Microarray and Proteomic analysis 
The pretreatment lymph node biopsy (optional) will be used to perform all standard diagnostic 
tests. In addition we will extract RNA and protein for research studies. The second biopsy 
(optional) obtained during Bortezomib monotherapy will be used for research studies only. In 
cases where there is peripheral blood involvement by [CONTACT_151212], timed blood collections or 
apheresis may be carried out in addition to a lymph node biopsy. Standard diagnostic tests will 
be sent and samples will be taken for microarray analysis as above. Microarray and proteomic 
analysis may be performed on lymph node biopsies, serum, whole blood samples and apheresis 
collected for research. In protein extracts of tumor cells pre and during therapy we aim to 
determine activity of key regulatory proteins such as components of the NF-kappa B signal 
transduction pathway, the levels of cell cycle inhibitors such as p21cip and p27kip-1 and the p53 
stress response. In addition, we may determine serum levels of proteins that play a role in 
lymphocyte function including chemokines and cytokines. Where possible we may initiate 
studies that aim at characterizing changes in protein levels on a global scale
[IP_ADDRESS] Timing of the second biopsy 
The optimal timing for the on-treatment biopsy can only be estimated at this time. Experiments 
in cell lines indicate that after [ADDRESS_174226] response was observed between 48 and 96hours from start of therapy (Rosenwald, 
2004). Thus, the optimal time point to detect changes in response to bortezomib could range 
from [ADDRESS_174227] or second infusion for several reasons: first, the 
relatively long time interval will make it likely that we will be able to detect effects of 
proteasome inhibition on signaling pathways such as the NF-kB pathway that may not be 
immediately interrupted by [CONTACT_151213]; second, we will be better able to detect cumulative 
changes in protein levels and third, scheduling the second biopsy at these time points minimizes 
interference with an orderly treatment cycle. We plan to analyze a first set of biopsies to 
Abbreviated Title:  EPOCH-R-B +/- B Maintenance in MCL
Version Date:   11/08/2021
26determine whether there are any changes in gene expression detectable in these samples. If there 
are no or only minimal changes in gene expression we will move the biopsy time point. From the 
timed blood samples in patients with leukemic MCL we will derive a better understanding of the 
kinetics of molecular changes in the tumor cells on bortezomib therapy. This data will help 
determine the optimal time point for lymph node biopsies.
[IP_ADDRESS] Tissue immunohistochemistry 
Tumor tissue will be analyzed by [CONTACT_9064]. RT-PCR may be performed on 
tumor samples to correlate changes in gene expression.
Tumor tissue may be stored for future research assays which are related to this study and 
do not pose an increase in patient risk.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Genome–wide Methylation Analysis
Genomic DNA (gDNA) will be prepared and digested using HPAII and MSPI [INVESTIGATOR_151158]. Digested DNA products are then amplified 
using ligation mediated PCR and hybridized to a custom high density oligonucleotide 
Microarray.  Methylation array testing will be done in duplicate and analyzed using an extensive 
quality control, primary analysis and normalization pi[INVESTIGATOR_151159] R statistical package 
and developed by [CONTACT_151214]-informaticians of the Einstein Epi[INVESTIGATOR_151160].  
Data from all patients will be analyzed by [CONTACT_151215].  We will confirm results at individual loci by [CONTACT_151216]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Biopsy Procedure
Standard techniques will be used for pre-treatment and post-treatment percutaneous biopsies 
which may include CT and / or ultrasound guided biopsy. In some cases, such biopsies may be 
expedited and facilitated with the use of navigation tools such as an automated laser angle 
selector connected to CT scan, or a standard needle guide connected to a protractor to determine 
which exact angle the biopsy needle will be inserted.
These guiding techniques may occur as maneuvers to facilitate the biopsy, which will take place 
in the usual conventional fashion, with standard, disposable, conventional spring-loaded biopsy 
equipment. Such guiding techniques may add to the reliability of tissue acquisition from specific 
spatial coordinates of a tumor target. Accurate spatial tissue acquisition may lead to more 
reliable, accurate and precise tissue characterization, which in turn should be more reproducible. 
When performing sequential biopsies, the knowledge of sampling location within a tumor may 
actually help avoid multiple needle punctures or repeat procedures, as might occur when samples 
are obtained from necrotic regions or regions without high quality mRNA (cDNA) for 
microarrays or sufficient protein for proteomics analysis. 
Sequential biopsy has been used routinely at the NCI as a research and prognostic tool, as well as 
pathway to surrogate biological markers for tumor response, prognosis, or susceptibility to 
specific targeted agents. Sequential biopsies are usually performed under the assumption that all 
tumor is created equal (mRNA and proteins) at a given time point, which is clearly an 
oversimplification with broad ramifications. Precision biopsy techniques might normalize some 
of the spatial heterogeneity inherent to tumors. Such normalization (as occurs when repeat 
Abbreviated Title:  EPOCH-R-B +/- B Maintenance in MCL
Version Date:   11/08/2021
27biopsies are taken from precisely the same location of tumors) could minimize the added noise 
from the interpretation of already voluminous and noisy data (as in the case of the gene 
microarrays). 
The correlation and anatomic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_151161]. Image fusion 
with CT/PET or image registration with electromagnetic tracking allows for the biopsies to be 
performed with multimodality guidance. This allows PET scans or functional dynamic MRI to 
provide the guidance for biopsy needle placement, such that biopsies may be taken from specific 
areas of tumor that have higher metabolic activity on FDG PET for example. 
We will use precision techniques like automated laser pointers, to facilitate being able to reliably 
sample a tumor from precisely the same region on repeated biopsies. This should maximize our 
chances of detecting significant alterations in tumor biology and protein or gene expression 
signatures (such as the proliferation signature [CONTACT_151246]).

6 CORRELATIVE STUDIES FOR RESEARCH
6.1 PROCEDURES FOR C OLLECTING TUMOR BIOPSIES AND /OR PERIPHERAL BLOOD CELLS
1. Orders for tumor biopsies, research blood samples and lymphapheresis collections should 
be placed in CRIS (Clinical Research Information System, Clinical Research Center, 
NIH, Bethesda, MD) 
2. Tumor biopsies will be submitted in native condition to the Department of Pathology, 
CCR, NIH and handled according to routine procedures. Material released for research 
studies will be documented on form NIH 2803-1. Initial processing of samples for 
research will depend on the size of the tumor biopsy. For core biopsies, the research 
sample will typi[INVESTIGATOR_151165] [ADDRESS_174235], or in an outpatient clinic of the 
CRC, NIH. Samples will be transferred to the research laboratory at room temperature. 
Cells will be separated by [CONTACT_151222], processed, analyzed, and stored. 

Abbreviated Title:  EPOCH-R-B +/- B Maintenance in MCL
Version Date:   11/08/2021
334. Tumor and normal blood cells may be viably frozen, typi[INVESTIGATOR_151166] 20-
100x106/mL in FCS with 10% DMSO using a temperature controlled freezing process to 
optimize sample viability. Samples will be transferred to Nitrogen tanks for long term 
storage. 
5. Tumor and normal blood cells can be further processed. Additional purification may be 
carried out by [CONTACT_151223], 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_151167]19. For analysis cells may be lysed to obtain RNA (using Qiagen 
manufactured kits are similar) or proteins (salt and/or triton containing buffers with 
addition of protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Integrity of RNA is monitored by [CONTACT_151224]. 
6. Research sample inventory and storage. All research samples are assigned a unique 
number and cataloged. Viably frozen cells are stored in a temperature controlled, alarm 
secured Nitrogen tank. Tumor biopsies and processed biologic material (RNA, protein) is 
stored at -80ºC in a temperature controlled, alarm secured -80ºC freezer. 
6.2 BIOSPECIMEN COLLECTION
6.2.1 Molecular and Genomic Studies
Samples will be analyzed to assess the effects of treatment on molecular and genetic changes 
within the cancer genome, and to correlate these with clinical outcomes (e.g., microarray, 
proteomics, and other genetic and/or mutational analyses).  Although direct analysis of germline 
DNA is not planned, normal genome could be analyzed for comparison with other testing or 
inadvertently analyzed within other samples, or as part of future analyses.

6.3 SAMPLE STORAGE, TRACKING AND DISPOSITION
All specimens obtained in the protocol are used as defined in the protocol.  Samples will be 
ordered in CRIS and tracked through a Clinical Trial Data Management system.  Should a CRIS 
screen not be available, the CRIS downtime procedures will be followed.  Samples will not be 
sent outside NIH appropriate approvals and/or agreements, if required.  
6.3.1 Procedures for stored specimens
The Clinical Support Laboratory, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc.-Frederick, processes 
and cryopreserves samples in support of IRB-approved, NCI clinical trials.  All 
laboratory personnel with access to patient information annually complete the NIH online 
course in Protection of Human Subjects.  The laboratory is CLIA certified for anti-IL15 
and certain cytokine measurements, and all laboratory areas operate under a Quality 
Assurance Plan with documented Standard Operating Procedures that are reviewed 
annually.  Laboratory personnel are assessed for competency prior to being permitted to 
work with patient samples.  Efforts to ensure protection of patient information include:
The laboratory is located in a controlled access building and laboratory doors are kept 
locked at all times. Visitors to the laboratory are required to be accompanied by 
[CONTACT_79922].  
Hard copy records or electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_138704].   
An electronic database is used to store information related to patient samples processed 
by [CONTACT_25699].  
The database resides on a dedicated program server that is kept in a central, locked 
computer facility.  
The facility is supported by [CONTACT_138761].  
Program access is limited to specified computers as designated by [CONTACT_151226].  Each of these computers has a password restricted login screen.  
The database sample entry program itself is accessed through a password protected entry 
screen.  
The database program has different levels of access approval to limit unauthorized 
changes to specimen records and the program maintains a sample history.  
Upon specimen receipt each sample is assigned a unique, sequential laboratory accession 
ID number.  All products generated by [CONTACT_138763] a central repository facility are identified by [CONTACT_138764].
Inventory information will be stored at the vial level and each vial will be labeled with 
both a sample ID and a vial sequence number.  
Abbreviated Title:  EPOCH-R-B +/- B Maintenance in MCL
Version Date:   11/08/2021
35Vial labels do not contain any personal identifier information.   
Samples are stored inventoried in locked laboratory freezers and are routinely transferred 
to the NCI-Frederick repository facilities for long term storage.  
Access to stored clinical samples is restricted.  Investigators establish sample collections 
under “Source Codes” and the investigator responsible for the collections, typi[INVESTIGATOR_151169], specifies who has access to the collection.  Specific 
permissions will be required to view, input or withdraw samples from a collection. 
Sample withdrawal requests submitted to approved laboratory staff by [CONTACT_138765].  
The repository facility will also notify the Source Code holder of any submitted requests 
for sample withdrawal.  
It is the responsibility of the Source Code holder (generally the NCI Principal 
Investigator) to ensure that samples requested and approved for withdrawal are being 
used in a manner consistent with IRB approval.  
The Clinical Support Laboratory does perform testing services that may be requested by 
[CONTACT_151227], but not limited to, immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_151170].  
When requests are submitted by [CONTACT_138766] a Material 
Transfer Agreement is in place that covers the specimen transfer.  At a minimum, the lab 
needs confirmation that one has been executed or an exception was granted from an 
office authorized to make such exceptions, e.g. NCI Technical Transfer Center.  The 
laboratory does not provide patient identifier information as part of the transfer process 
but may, at the discretion of the NCI investigator, group samples from individual patients 
when that is critical to the testing process.  
The NCI investigator responsible for the sample collection is responsible for ensuring 
appropriate IRB approvals are in place and that a Material Transfer Agreement has been 
executed prior to requesting the laboratory to ship samples outside of the NIH.

be recorded and used as the cumulative baseline product when restaging post Part A on cycle [ADDRESS_174244] 4 weeks off treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Complete response (CR) 
Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease and 
disappearance of all disease-related symptoms if present before therapy, and normalization of 
those biochemical abnormalities (e.g. LDH) definitely assignable to the lymphoma.  All lymph 
nodes must have regressed to normal size ( 1.[ADDRESS_174245] diameter if > 1.5 cm before 
therapy).  Previously involved nodes that were 1.[ADDRESS_174246] 
decreased to  1 cm or by [CONTACT_726] 75% in the sum of the products of the greatest diameters 
(SPD). Spleen, if considered to be enlarged before therapy, must have regressed in size and not 
be palpable on physical examination.  The bone marrow must show no evidence of disease by

8.4 NIH REQUIRED DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN
8.4.1 Principal Investigator/Research Team
The clinical research team will meet on a regular basis when patients are being actively treated 
on the trial to discuss each patient. Decisions about dose level enrollment and dose escalation if 
applicable will be made based on the toxicity data from prior patients.
All data will be collected in a timely manner and reviewed by [CONTACT_978], the study chairman or a 
lead associate investigator for toxicity.  Events meeting requirements for expedited reporting as 
described in section 8.2.[ADDRESS_174250] or supervise the 
investigation and provide appropriate delegation of responsibilities to other members of the 
research staff. 
8.5 PROCEDURES FOR AE  AND SAE R EPORTING TO MANUFACTURER
AEs may be spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to an open question from 
study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic 
procedures.  Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical 
finding is considered an AE.  When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event.  AEs which are serious must 
be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) from the first dose of bortezomib up 
to and including [ADDRESS_174251] of bortezomib.   Any SAE that 
occurs at any time after completion of bortezomib treatment or after the designated follow-up 
period that the sponsor-investigator and/or sub-investigator considers to be related to any study 
drug must be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee).  Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151171] (e.g., surgery was performed earlier or later than planned).  
All SAEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a 
patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).
Since this is an investigator-initiated study, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wyndham Wilson, also 
referred to as the sponsor-investigator, is responsible for reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) 
to any regulatory agency and to the sponsor- investigator’s EC or IRB.   Regardless of 
expectedness or causality, all SAEs must also be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance or 
designee as soon as possible, but no later than 5 calendar days of the sponsor-investigator’s 
observation or awareness of the event.  See below for contact [CONTACT_151230].
As the study sponsor, [CONTACT_9382] will be the single point of contact [CONTACT_151231].  [CONTACT_9382] will require all local physicians operating under the protocol for all 
patients (i.e., those from the NCI study site) to report SAEs to [CONTACT_9382] immediately. [CONTACT_151249] will be responsible for ensuring that all local physicians are aware of SAE reporting 
requirements and that they send such reports to [CONTACT_9382].

investigator’s determination of both the intensity of the event(s) and the relationship of the 
event(s) to study drug administration.    Relationship to all study drugs for each SAE will be 
determined by [CONTACT_9940]-investigator by [CONTACT_91854]: Is 
there a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with the study drug(s)?
Sponsor-investigator must also provide Millennium Pharmacovigilance with a copy of all 
communications with applicable regulatory authorities related to the study or study drug(s), 
including, but not limited to, telephone conversation logs, as soon as possible but no later than [ADDRESS_174253] Information (North America Reporting)

If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male patient’s participation in 
this study, the sponsor-investigator must also immediately fax a completed Pregnancy Form 
(Section 0) to the Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance or designee (see Section 8.5).  
Every effort should be made to follow the pregnancy for the final pregnancy outcome.

[ADDRESS_174255] a difference in progression free survival with a two-tailed 0.05 alpha level, 
simulations were performed to determine the sample size. The following assumptions were 
made:
Accrual will take place over 24 months. It will be assumed that greater than 90% of patients who 
enter the trial will experience a PR or CR and hence be eligible for randomization. The 
observation arm will be assumed to have a median progression free survival of approximately [ADDRESS_174256] rate throughout. 

Abbreviated Title:  EPOCH-R-B +/- B Maintenance in MCL
Version Date:   11/08/2021
42This was based on results obtained from the single arm trial of EPOCH-R + vaccine in mantle 
cell lymphomas in which the median progression free survival of [ADDRESS_174257]  24 
months (lambda=0.0144), resulting in approximately 71% PFS at 24 months. It will further be 
assumed that the curve will flatten out such that it attains 51% PFS by 48 months 
(lambda=0.0137 from 24 to 48 months) and finally levels out to 50% PFS at 72 months 
(lambda=0.0008 from 48 to 72 months). Under these assumptions, using [ZIP_CODE] simulations with 
nQuery Advisor, with 36 patients per arm (total 72), there is 81% power to detect the differences 
as stated above with a two-tailed 0.[ADDRESS_174258] duration of agents and then observation, it is not expected that there will be 
differences in toxicity between the two arms. Furthermore, the study will not be blinded and is of 
limited size. Thus, there will not be a need for formal DSMB evaluation of this study. The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_151172] a timely fashion to the IRB.
Overall survival (OS) will also be determined for both randomized arms of the trial and 
compared beginning at the date of randomization.  Because this is a relatively indolent disease, 
statistically significant differences in OS will be difficult to observe with only 72 randomized 
subjects. However, the results obtained will be reported, along with appropriate 95% confidence 
intervals.
Secondary evaluations will include, but not be limited to the following:  Clinical response will be 
evaluated on all 80 patients who receive the initial cycle of Bortezomib alone, and a 95% 
confidence interval will be formed about the observed response proportion. Biopsies taken pre-
treatment and post this single cycle of Bortezomib will yield gene expression data and 
microarray data that can be evaluated both to determine if pre-treatment expression levels or 
gene patterns can be found which differ according to degree of clinical response noted (CR vs. 
<CR, or CR+PR vs. SD+PD), or to see if changes in expression levels or changes in microarray 
patterns can be used to predict response to DA-EPOCH-RB. With a total of up to 80 subjects 
having this data available, even with 90% of patients responding and 10% not responding, there 
would be over 80% power to detect a 1.[ADDRESS_174259] individual 
differences at that level may be reduced, but since these analyses will be done with exploratory 
intent, the results obtained will be used to guide future research. Analyses will tend to focus on 
cell cycle regulatory genes to see if changes in their expression levels and patterns are associated 
with clinical response, PFS, and OS.
Abbreviated Title:  EPOCH-R-B +/- B Maintenance in MCL
Version Date:   11/08/2021
43In addition, response and clinical toxicity to DA-EPOCH-RB will be determined and reported 
descriptively, and a 95% confidence interval about the observed fraction of patients who have a 
CR or a CR+PR will be formed. As well, time to progression after progressing on the 
observation arm will be determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. This will be reported 
descriptively, using appropriate 95% confidence intervals. With 24 months to accrue 80 patients, 
in order to yield 72 randomized subjects, approximately 3 patients per month are expected to 
enroll in an average month.

[ADDRESS_174261] SELECTION 
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas affect all races and genders.  However, males are more likely than 
females to be affected and this will be reflected in the gender distribution of our cases.  We have 
selected mantle cell lymphomas for inclusion in this trial because they are considered to be 
incurable with chemotherapy.  Thus, they would potentially benefit from the use of a novel agent 
like Bortezomib combined with a chemotherapy regimen like EPOCH-R.  Additionally, the 
administration of maintenance Bortezomib therapy could result in an improved clinical outcome.  
Patients under the age of 18 are excluded because mantle cell lymphoma is rare in young 
patients, and the inclusion of an occasional younger patient will not provide generalizable 
information that would justify their inclusion on this phase II study. Additionally, patients with 
HIV infection will be excluded due to the severe immunosuppression of this therapy, and 
pregnant or nursing mothers are excluded because of the potential teratogenic effects of therapy.
11.2 PARTICIPATION OF C HILDREN

11.4 EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS 
Patients may or may not obtain direct benefit from treatment with Bortezomib combined with 
EPOCH-R.  Results from a phase I/II study of Bortezomib in combination with EPOCH shows 
the combination to have tolerable side effects.
11.4.[ADDRESS_174263] is given, headache, 
metallic and/ or bitter taste in the mouth and a warm, flushing feeling. Rarely, some people have 
more severe allergic reactions to the contrast which may include skins rashes, shortness of 
breath, wheezing or low blood pressure.
11.4.[ADDRESS_174264] received additional scans during treatment; however, as 
all patients are in long-term follow-up on the study only (as of November 2021), the risks 
described in the protocol and consent will apply to the imaging for follow-up only.  Accordingly:  
patients will receive up to up to one (1) CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and two (2) 
[18F]-FDG PET scans as well undergo up to two (2) CT guided biopsies. 
The total additional radiation dose for research purposes will be approximately 3.9 rem.
11.4.3 Risks from Blood Draws
The possible side effects of drawing blood include pain, bleeding, bruising, dizziness, light-
headedness, fainting, and rarely a local blood clot formation or infection with redness and irritation 
of the vein.
11.4.4 Risks from Bone Marrow Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]/ Biopsy
Bone marrow biopsy is minimally invasive and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a very safe procedure. Usually, the 
hipbone is numbed with anesthesia. Using a needle, the solid and liquid portion of bone marrow 
is taken out. This procedure causes some pain. Very rarely, infection or bleeding may occur at 
the needle site. 
11.4.5 Risks from Tumor Biopsy
The likely side effects include discomfort or pain, redness, swelling, and/or bruising at the site of 
the needle insertion.  Bleeding from the site of the needle insertion is a less likely risk.  Rarely, 
significant infection or bleeding from this procedure, allergic reaction to the anesthetic, or 
formation of a scar at the site of needle entry occurs.

PROCESS AND DOCUMENTATION
The informed consent document will be provided as a physical or electronic document to the 
participant or consent designee(s) as applicable for review prior to consenting.  A designated study 
investigator will carefully explain the procedures and tests involved in this study, and the 
associated risks, discomforts and benefits. In order to minimize potential coercion, as much time 
as is needed to review the document will be given, including an opportunity to discuss it with 
friends, family members and/or other advisors, and to ask questions of any designated study 
investigator. A signed informed consent document will be obtained prior to entry onto the study.
The initial consent process as well as re-consent, when required, may take place in person or 
remotely (e.g., via telephone or other NIH approved remote platforms used in compliance with 
policy, including HRPP Policy 303) per discretion of the designated study investigator and with 
the agreement of the participant/consent designee(s).  Whether in person or remote, the privacy of 
the subject will be maintained. Consenting investigators (and participant/consent designee, when 
in person) will be located in a private area (e.g., clinic consult room). When consent is conducted 
remotely, the participant/consent designee will be informed of the private nature of the discussion 
and will be encouraged to relocate to a more private setting if needed.  
Consent will be documented with required signatures on the physical document (which includes 
the printout of an electronic document sent to participant) or as described below, with a manual 
(non-electronic) signature [CONTACT_62579].  When required, witness signature [CONTACT_62580].

Bortezomib for Injection is a sterile lyophilized powder for reconstitution and is supplied in vials 
containing bortezomib and mannitol at a 1:10 ratio.  For example, vials containing 3.5 mg of 
bortezomib contain 35 mg of mannitol. 
13.1.2 Storage and Stability
Vials containing lyophilized BORTEZOMIB for Injection should be stored according to the label 
requirements.  For the [LOCATION_002], store at USP Controlled Room Temperature which is 25ºC 
(77ºF); storage temperature excursions are permitted from 15 to 30ºC (59 to 86ºF).  For Europe, 
do not store above 30ºC (86ºF).  To date, stability data indicate that the lyophilized drug product 
is stable for at least [ADDRESS_174269] of the study.
13.1.3 Preparation and Administration 
Drug will be administered only to eligible patients under the supervision of the investigator or 
identified subinvestigator(s).  Patients may be treated on an outpatient basis, if possible.
The drug will be prepared under the supervision of a pharmacist, or appropriately qualified and 
trained personnel.  The amount (in mg) of drug to be administered will be determined based on 
body surface area.  Body surface area is to be calculated based on body weight using a standard 
calculation. The dose should be calculated on Day 1 of each cycle; the dose administered should 
remain the same throughout each cycle but should be recalculated at the start of the next cycle.  
If a patient experiences a notable change in weight within a cycle, as determined by [CONTACT_151236], then the patient’s dose should be recalculated at that time based 
on clinical judgment.
The appropriate amount of bortezomib will be drawn from the injection vial and administered as 
an IV push over [ADDRESS_174270] your Millennium 
Clinical Operations representative to arrange for return of study drug procedures.  Any unused or

Version Date:   11/08/2021
5613.2.1 Supply
Commercially available in single-use vials containing 10 mL (100 mg) or 50 mL (500 mg) of 
rituximab solution at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. 
13.2.2 Storage
Rituximab vials should be stored in a secure refrigerator at 2º to 8°C. 
13.2.3 Preparation
Rituximab will be diluted to a final volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride or 5% Dextrose Injection 
to prepare a standard product with concentration of 2 mg/ml.  Caution should be taken during the 
preparation of the drug, as shaking can cause aggregation and precipi[INVESTIGATOR_151176].
13.2.4 Stability
After dilution, rituximab is stable at 2-8 degrees C (36-46 degrees F) for 24 hours and for an 
additional 24 hours at room temperature.
13.2.5 Administration
A peripheral or central intravenous line will be established. During rituximab infusion, a patient's 
vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], temperature) should be monitored according to the 
standard of care. Medications readily available for the emergency management of anaphylactoid 
reactions should include: epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:1000, 1 mg/mL) for subcutaneous injection, 
diphenhydramine hydrochloride for intravenous injection, and resuscitation equipment.
Prophylaxis against hypersensitivity and infusion-related reactions associated with rituximab will 
include acetaminophen [ADDRESS_174279] dose of 
prednisone 60 mg/m2 (or a glucocorticoid equivalent dose of an alternative steroid) at least 
60 minutes before rituximab treatment commences.
Rituximab will be administered as an intravenous infusion at 375 mg/m2 on day 1 of each cycle 
of EPOCH after bortezomib (when both drugs are given on the same day) and before starting 
etoposide + doxorubicin + vincristine administration. Rituximab infusions will be administered 
to patients primarily in an outpatient clinic setting. 
First dose:
The initial dose rate at the time of the first rituximab infusion should be 50mg/hour (25 mL/hr) 
for the first 30  minutes. If no toxicity is seen, the dose rate may be escalated gradually in 50 
mg/hour (25 mL/h) increments at 30 minute intervals) to a maximum of 400 mg/hour (maximum 
rate = 200 mL/h). 
Second and Subsequent Doses (select the appropriate administration timing):
90-minute Administration
If the first dose of rituximab was well tolerated, subsequent doses may be administered over 90 
minutes with 20% of the total dose given in the first 30 minutes, and remaining 80% of the total 
dose administered over the subsequent 60 minutes; e.g.:

2nd portion (30 – 90 minutes)
Special Note: The 90-minute infusion scheme is not recommended for patients with clinically 
significant cardiovascular disease or high circulating lymphocyte counts (≥ 5000/mcL).
Standard Administration for Second & Subsequent Infusions
Patients who tolerate initial treatment without experiencing infusion-related adverse effects but 
for whom the 90-minute infusion scheme during subsequent treatments is considered 
inappropriate, may receive subsequent rituximab doses at the Standard Rate for Subsequent 
Infusions, which is as follows:
Begin at an initial rate of 100 mg/hour (50 mL/h) for 30 minutes. If administration is well 
tolerated, the administration rate may be escalated gradually in 100-mg/hour (50-mL/h) 
increments at 30-minute intervals to a maximum rate of 400 mg/hour (maximum rate = 200 
mL/h).
CAUTION: DO NOT ADMINISTER RITUXIMAB AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR 
BOLUS. 
13.2.6 Toxicities
Common toxicities include fever, chills, nausea, asthenia, headache, angioedema, pruritis and 
rash. Leukopenia occurs in approximately 10% but grade 3 or 4 neutropenia is uncommon. 
Hypotension occurred in 10% of patients during rituximab infusion, and serious bronchospasm 
and urticaria associated with rituximab infusion each occurred in fewer than 10% of patients. 
Less common toxicities include abdominal pain, vomiting, thrombocytopenia, anemia, myalgia, 
arthralgia, dizziness, and rhinitis. Recently, in patients receiving Rituximab, there have been 
reports of hepatitis B virus reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and death in 
some patients with hematological malignancies.

6716 APPENDIX A: PROCEDURE FOR SERUM SEPARATION
This procedure is for use with blood tubes or syringes containing no anticoagulant.  In some cases 
the blood will be received in vacutainer tubes containing a serum separator.  Use of these serum 
separator tubes (SST) simplifies the recovery of serum after centrifugation since the gel separator 
will be found between the cell layer and the serum.
Complete all required data entry.  Prepare transmittal form to accompany sample.  Assign each 
sample a unique Sample Accession Number.  Contact [CONTACT_151245] (301) 846-
5125 to receive one or more Sample Accession Numbers for use. Laboratory staff can also be 
contact[CONTACT_19904]:
To:  Theresa Burks – [EMAIL_3088]
CC:  Helen Rager (Supervisor) – [EMAIL_3089]
CC:  [CONTACT_151250] (Lab Head) – [EMAIL_3090]
The sample should be allowed to clot at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes.  If possible 
the sample should be processed immediately after clotting.  If it is not possible to proceed 
immediately the sample should be refrigerated or placed in a sealed bag on wet ice until processing 
can be performed.  Both the draw time and time when processing was completed should be recorded.
Set the centrifuge temperature to 4C.  Centrifuge the sample for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm (approx. 
1170 x g) in the RC-3B centrifuge with no brake (2300 rpm Sorvall RT6000B).  The centrifugation 
time does not include the time required for the rotor to reach the target speed.  To determine 
centrifugation speed for different centrifuge/rotor combinations see the centrifuge manual or visit the 
following website: 
http://researchlink.labvelocity.com/tools/conversionTools/CentrifugationTool.jhtml
Prior to initiating sample processing or during the centrifugation step label 2 ml Nunc cryovials 
(NUNC 368632 1.8 ml round bottom cryovial or equivalent) with the sample Accession Number.  If 
multiple blood tubes have been received for a single patient/timepoint also label a 15 or 50 ml 
polypropylene tube depending on expected recovery volume.
Carefully remove the serum layer (the translucent first layer of fluid) without disturbing the clot.  Do 
not attempt to recover serum from the side of the retracted clot as doing so will result in 
contamination of the serum.  If it is noted that the serum has not been cleanly removed transfer the 
recovered serum to a 15 ml polypropylene tube and repeat centrifugation.
If only a single tube of blood was received for serum recovery aliquot directly to the labeled Nunc 
cryovials at 1ml per vial (1 10ml tiger top (SST) or red top vacutainer = approximately 4 vials, 2 
tubes = >6 vials).  
If multiple blood tubes are received for a single patient/timepoint, transfer the serum from each tube 
into a single [ADDRESS_174297] 6 times prior to aliquoting.
Transfer filled vials to the -70C freezer.  If the laboratory does not have access to a -70 C freezer (or 
colder storage such as vapor phase LN2) the serum should be frozen solid on dry ice before transfer 
to the -20 C freezer.  If samples are held at temperatures outside the range of –60 to -86 C please 
note the storage temperature on the transmittal form.
Include any comments concerning adequacy of the specimen (e.g., gross hemolysis) on the 
transmittal form.

6817 APPENDIX B: EPOCH ADMIXTURES: PREPARATION AND ADMINISTRATION
Preparation
All 3-in-1 admixtures dispensed from the Pharmacy will contain a 24-hour supply of etoposide, 
doxorubicin, and vincristine, PLUS 40 mL overfill (excess) fluid and a proportional amount of 
drug to compensate for volume lost in parenteral product containers and administration set tubing.
Etoposide Dose Volume of Fluid 
Containing a Daily DoseVolume of Overfill
(fluid + drug)Total Volume in the Product
(including overfill)
≤ 130 mg 528 mL 40 mL 568 mL
> 130 mg 1056 mL 40 mL 1096 mL
Before dispensing 3-in-1 admixtures, Pharmacy staff will:
[1] Purge all air from the drug product container,
[2] Attach an administration set appropriate for use with a portable pump,
[3] The set will be primed close to its distal tip, and
[4] The set will be capped with a Luer-locking cap.
Pre-printed product labeling will identify the ‘Total Volume To Infuse’ and the ‘Volume of 
Overfill (fluid + drug)’.
Bags will be exchanged daily for four consecutive days to complete a 96-hour drug infusion (unless 
treatment is interrupted or discontinued due to un-anticipated events).
Administration
Portable pumps used to administer etoposide + doxorubicin + vincristine admixtures will be 
programmed to deliver one of two fixed volumes at one of two corresponding fixed rates based on 
the amount of etoposide and fluid that is ordered (see the table, below).

Rate
≤ 130 mg 528 mL 40 mL 22 mL/hour
> 130 mg 1056 mL 40 mL 44 mL/hour
*DO NOT attempt to infuse the overfill.
At the end of an infusion, some residual fluid is expected because 
overfill (excess fluid and drug) was added; however, nurses are asked to 
return to the Pharmacy for measurement any drug containers that appear 
to contain a greater amount of residual drug than expected.
Example at right: The amount of fluid remaining in a bag after 
completing a 24-hour infusion (1056 mL delivered).

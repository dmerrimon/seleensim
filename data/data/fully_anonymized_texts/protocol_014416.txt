 1.0  INTRODUCTI ON 
 
 The treatment of patients with high grade gliomas remains a challenge for modern 
therapy. The prognosis for these patients is poor; the median survival time after diagnosis 
and treatment is less than 1 year [1, 2] and may be linked to the completeness of tumor 
removal. [3-6]. A recent study of 416 patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) 
indicates that resection of 89% of the tumor volume is necessary to improve survival and 
a significant survival advantage of 4.2 months was associated with resection of 98% or 
more of the tumor volume, compared with resection of less than 98% [7]. However, the 
highest possible degree of tumor resection is often limited by [CONTACT_11065]’s ability to 
distinguish residual tumor tissue from surrounding brain tissue under conventional white 
light surgical microscope illumination [8]. For these reasons, methods enabling better 
intraoperative discrimination of viable tumor borders may be valuable. 
 
Fluorescence imaging may, potentially, enhance the contrast of viable tumor borders. 
Althoug
h administration of fluorescent markers to enhance contrast of malignant gliomas 
is not new [9 , 10, 11], marking tumors with 5-amino levulinic acid (ALA) is conceptually 
diff
erent from other investigations.  ALA is not itself fluorescent but is metabolized into 
the strongly fluorescent proto-porphyrin IX (PpIX ) b y a number of malignant tumors in 
situ through enzymes of the he me-biosynthesis pathway [12]. This may avoid pi[INVESTIGATOR_817720] a fluorescent marker is administered directly, such as leakage from the tumor into 
surrounding normal brain tissue [13].  
 
ALA-PpIX fluorescence imaging has previously been investigated at St. Michael's 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_817721], Toronto Cancer Institute [Drs. N. Marcon 
and B. Wilson]. These studies examin ed the utility of ALA for detection and 
photodynamic therapy (PDT) of dysplasia in patients with Barrett’s disease of the 
esophagus.  
 
Recently, ALA-PpIX fluorescence imaging was introduced by a German group for 
intraoperative detection and resection of residual malignant glioma [14, 15]. In the latter 
study [15], 52 patients were investigated using an operating room-adapted microscope for 
fluorescence imaging. ALA was administered orally at a dose of 20 mg/kg 3 hours before 
induction of anesthesia. These workers found that leaving “solidly fluorescing” tissue 
unresected had a negative influence on survival, whereas the prognosis of patients with 
residual “vague fluorescence” was not significantly different from that of patients in 
whom all fluorescent tissue was removed completely. Histologically, solidly fluorescing 
tissue was mostly characterized by [CONTACT_817737], whereas vaguely fluorescing 
tissue usually represented infiltrating tumor of intermediate or low cellular density. 
Analysis of tumor biopsy specimens revealed infiltrating tumor also to be present beyond 
vaguely fluorescing tissue portions. Recent data suggest that the sensitivity of this dose 
and administration timing for 5-ALA is 75% while specificity is only 71% [16].  While 
e
ncouraging, this study may be considered subjective as it involved only one 
neurosurgeon and was not quantitative in determining the levels of PpIX fluorescence in 
the 
tumor and normal tissue.  The definitions of “solidly fluorescing…” and “vaguely 
fluorescining are unclear and imprecise.  In addition, all published studies have been 
performed using the 20 mg/kg 5-ALA dose and [ADDRESS_1132406] 2 mg/kg was not detectable (Stummer personal 
communication),_but values between 2 and 20 mg/kg from a clinical trial setting have not 
be
en published. 
 
Our group is developi[INVESTIGATOR_11300]-probe systems for intra-operative quantitative PpIX 
concentration measurement. A 1st generation instrument has been developed and used in 
another clinical trial [16, 17].

2.2 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE 
Primary 
objective : As a first step, we will assess 2 doses of 5-ALA, 10m g/kg and 20 
mg/kg, to determine the optimum ALA dose in terms of both sensitivity and specificity 
for
 residual tumor.  W e will compare residual tumor detection by [CONTACT_817739]. 
2.3  SECONDARY OBJECTIVE 
Se
condary Objective : We will assess the correlatation between the recorded in vivo 
qualitative assessment of fluo rescence signal from the neurosurgeon with the post-
surgical (i.e., ex vivo ) absolute  PpIX concentration detected both intraoperatively and in 
ex vivo tissue biopsies.  
 
2.4  TERTIARY OBJECTIVE 
T
ertiary Objective: To determine the association between the presence of fluorescence in 
the surgical cavity and the post-operative image enhancement on MRI. This includes the 
relationship between  the amount and location of residual tumor detected by [CONTACT_74064] , 
PpIX concentration, and intra-operative frameless stereotaxy following maximal 
resection versus the amount and location of tumor imaged post-operatively via CT and/or 
MR

 3.0 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA 
 
3.1 PATIENT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA  
 
 Patients will be eligible for this study if they meet all of the following criteria: 
 
Table 1: Inclusion Criteria 
Age [ADDRESS_1132408] a different PpIX uptake and thus fluoresce differently 
compared to Grade III gliomas [15] therefore, this study will only focus on Grade IV 
gliomas. However, the grade of the glioma is not certain until surgical resection of the 
glioma at which point biopsies are taken for histopathological determination of the 
glioma grade. As a result some patients with Grade III gliomas may be enrolled in this 
study, but these patients will be excluded from primary analysis. The data obtained from 
patients with Grade III gliomas will be used to explore differences in fluorescence 
between Grade III and Grade IV brain tumors.   W e do not expect that this will result in a 
statistically significant difference, but only that generate hypothesis for future studies. 
 
3.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
  
Patients will be excluded from participation in the study if they meet any of the following 
criteria: 
 
CASE 1305 Protocol Version dated 09.15 .17 Page 9 of 30 
 Table 2: Exclusion Criteria 
Pregnant women or those who are breast feeding  
Individuals with his tory of cutaneous photosensitivity, porphyria, hypersensitivity to 
porphyrins, photodermatosis, exfoliative dermatitis  
Individuals with h istory of liver disease in last [ADDRESS_1132409], ALT, ALP, or bilirubin >2.5x normal upper limit any t ime during the 
previous 2 months  
Individuals with plasma creatinine>180 μmol/L  
Individuals who are un able to comply with photosensitivity precautions

4.0 RESEARCH DESIGN 
 
4.1 SUMMARY OF TRIAL DESIGN 
Summary of Trial Design:  This study will enroll evaluable patients undergoing surgical 
resection of malignant, grade IV gliomas in both of two groups:  those with newly 
diagnosed GBM and those with recurrent GBM.   Patient, in each group (primary vs 
re
current GBM)  will be randomized to one of 2 levels of ALA dose (10 and20 mg/kg) to 
be
 given orally at [ADDRESS_1132410] consented to this protocol will be randomly assigned to one of two 
ALA dose groups (Table 3). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_817740] (i.e. de novo) or recurrent. The data center will prepare sealed, opaque 
envelopes with the randomized assignment to ALA dose and administration time and 
notify the pharmacy of the trial site so that so that the correct ALA dose can be prepared. 
Neurosurgeons and investigators responsible for determining pathologic characteristics, 
for quantifying fluorescence images, for extracting chemical PpIX,  for co-localizing 
fluorescence images with MR images will be blinded to the ALA dose and administration 
time. In case of emergency, such as toxicity or allergic reaction attributable to the drug, 
the research pharmacist on call will break the blind and inform the PI [INVESTIGATOR_817722].  
 
A safety monitoring board ha s been developed at the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center 
at Case Western Reserve University. Also, forms will be filled out by [CONTACT_817741] a daily basis, the patient’s surgeon will report any adverse effects. In 
addition to specific signs and symptoms, liver function tests will be ascertained at [ADDRESS_1132411] (DSMB)

4.4 PRE-OPERATIVE PROCEDURES 
 
4.4.1 PATIENT INFORMED CONSENT 
 
P
atients will enter this study on a voluntary basis. Enrolled patients receive an 
information package that includes an informed consent form. This package will inform 
the patient about the objectives of the study, the procedures that will be used, the 
potential risks involved, and the procedures that they should undertake to avoid possible 
photosensitivity reactions. At the time of obtaining consent for surgery, the attending 
surgeon or their delegate will obtain informed consent for this trial.  
 
 4.4.2 LIGHT SENSITIVITY PRECAUTIONS 
 
Be
fore ALA administration, patients will be given verbal and written instructions for 
protection from sunlight by [CONTACT_817742] (see Section 4 .7.1). It should 
be noted that these patients are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_817723], so that there is in practice 
a very small possibility of their being exposed to bright sunlight outdoors. Nursing staff 
in the recovery room and on the ward will be instructed regarding the need to avoid 
accidental exposure to bright light in the first 24 hours.  
4.4.3 .PATIENT GROUPS AND NUMBERS AND ALA DOSE 
 
This 
clinical trial has ALA dose at 2 levels (10 and 20 mg/kg) and ALA administration 
ti
me at 1 time point (3h). Consenting patients scheduled for surgery will be assigned to 
prima
ry or recurrent arm based on clinical presentation, are then randomly assigned to 
one of two groups (for dose assignment) within   each of the two arms of the study . 
Sample sizes of the 4 patient groups with two ALA dose levels are listed in the table 
be
low:

Recurrent D x 
   
10 mg/kg  30 30 
20 mg/kg  30 30 
For both patients with new and recurrent disease, biopsies will be taken at up to six sites 
identified by [CONTACT_11065]:  in the tumor center, tumor edge, area surrounding the tumor (if 
safe), areas seen to fluoresce intraoperatively and an area with MR enhancement outside 
 
CASE 1305 Protocol Version dated 09.15 .17 Page 12 of 30  
 the tumor region (if this can be accomplished safely). Prior to collecting these biopsies 
readings will be taken at the biopsied location with the PpIX point probe by [CONTACT_11065] . 
For each of the 6 biopsies, they will be divided into 3 parts and distributed for further 
analysis as follows: one portion will be sent to the pathologist for assessment of tumor 
percentage, one portion will be evaluated by [CONTACT_817743]. 
 
4.4 S URGICAL PROCEDURES 
 
4.4.1  PRECAUTIONS FOR PHOTOSENSITIVITY DURING SURGERY  
 
Dur
ing surgery, light-opaque drapes will be used to cover all skin, including the area 
around the surgical site. The patient ’s eye lids will be closed with tape and covered with 
goggles that block the appropriate light wavelengths that might damage the retina.  The 
patient will receive instructions on how to prevent exposure to sunlight and bright indoor 
lighting for a period of [ADDRESS_1132416] surgery (see Appendix I: Section 12).  
4.4.2 S URGICAL TREATMENT 
 
During surgery, the intraoperative fluorescence observations and PpIX concentration 
measurements will be taken by [CONTACT_817744]. The 
surgical site will be illuminated with UV/blue light in the wavelength range of 350-
490nm
 with an irradiance of 20-40 mW cm-2. A fluorescence image will be taken using a 
commercially available operating room microscope. A white-light image will also be 
taken using the same microscope in non-fluorescence mode. Each tissue biopsy will be 
taken at the discretion of the operating surgeon (the biopsy location on the fluorescence 
image will be recorded) and divided in 3 parts that will be analyzed by [CONTACT_26745], 
fluorometry, and fluorescence microscopy. A t e ach site, the position of the biop sy in the 
tumor bed will be determined by [CONTACT_817745] 
(OTS) for correlation with pre- and post-operative CT and/or MRI scans. Biopsies of 
50mg
  or less are taken with biopsy forceps .  
4.4.3 INTRA -OPERATIVE MEASUREMENTS 
 
The procedures for performing fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy during and 
following resection are well established from our prior experience. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  B ULK TUMOR MEASUREMENTS 
 
1. Unde r white light illumination, the surgeon will identify biopsy sites of 
tumor and normal tissue with a probe and corresponding white-light and 
fluorescence images will be taken.  
2. A biopsy will be taken of each of the sites identified under white light 
illumination and under fluorescence imaging. 
 
Additionally, the location of the biopsies will be determined with an Optical Tracking 
System for post-operative correlation with pre- and post-operative CT and/or MR-scans.     
 
 
CASE [ADDRESS_1132417] using a scalpel into 3 parts: [ADDRESS_1132418] histopathological assessment. The other 2 parts 
will be protected from light exposure, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and will be kept at -
80 ºC in a light protected environment until further use, that is analysis by 
[CONTACT_817746] (see below for procedures). 
 
The intra-operative fluorescence imaging information will not be used in this trial to 
modify or extend the surgical resection. 
 
4.[ADDRESS_1132419] operating procedures for each analysis.  . Th e se biopsies will not be 
used as part of patient care.   
 
Note: In case a biopsy is too small to be divided in three parts, the biopsy will be fixed in 
formalin and given to [CONTACT_26021] for histopathological analysis only. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  1ST PART OF BIOPSY: HISTOPATHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 
 
The
 first part of each biopsy will be fixed in formalin and given to [CONTACT_26021] who will 
prepare standard Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) stained sections. This histopathology will 
be assessed by a single experienced neuropathologist, [CONTACT_26021]. Grading and 
a
ssessment of tumor extent will be determined in the usual fashion.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  2ND PART OF BIOPSY: PpIX QUANTIFICATION 
 
The second part of each biopsy will be protected from light exposure, immediately snap-
fr
ozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -[ADDRESS_1132420]. Wilson’s 
laboratory at the University Health Network Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_414395]. The PpIX concentration 
of 
that sample will be determined using a procedure developed by [CONTACT_817747].  [19] which, 
briefly, is as follows: After thawing, the tissue will first be finely chopped with a scalpel 
blade
, and suspended by [CONTACT_817748] (Dupont, [LOCATION_011]) at 50 C in a water 
ba
th and shaken for 1 hour, then mechanically homogenized and re-incubated in Solvable 
for another hour. The fluorescence of aliquots of the suspended sample will then be 
measured in a scanning spectrofluorimeter (PTI, London, ON, Canada). The PpIX 
concentration will then be determined by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_817724]. This procedure is currently used as the standard technique in the same 
 
CASE 1305 Protocol Version dated 09.15 .17 Page 14 of 30  
 investigator-group’s NIH-sponsored, multi-center, Photofrin-mediated PDT brain tumor 
cli
nical trial.  For 100 mg brain tissue samples, it has a lower detection limit of 0.02 g 
PpIX per gram of tissue. The anticipated concentration range in tumor for the lowest 
ALA dose is expected to be 100 times this value. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  3RD PART OF BIOPSY: (CONFOCAL) FLUORESCENCE 
MICROSCOPY 
 
The third part of each biopsy will be protected from light exposure and immediatel y 
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. It will then be light protected and stored at -[ADDRESS_1132421]. 
Wilson’s lab in Toronto. (Confocal) fluorescence microscopy will be used to determine 
the microdistribution of PpIX. This technique is also in routine use in [CONTACT_9382]’s 
laboratory [17]. Briefly, serial 5 m frozen sections of each biopsy will be made. 
Alternate sections will be stained for standard histological comparison with the H&E 
sections above. The quality of H&E sections made in this way is not adequate for clinical 
diagnosis, but does allow direct one- to-one identification of areas of tumor involvement 
when compared with the confocal fluorescence microscopy of the adjacent sections. The 
fluorescence images will be obtained using a UV/visible Zeiss (Thornwood, NY) [ADDRESS_1132422] tumor resection. If abnormal (> 
than Grade 3),  weekly liver function tests will be drawn for 2 weeks. They will then be 
monitored on a monthly basis until they normalize (see Section 4.7.3). Subsequent to 
stud
y completion, patients will have regular surveillance as per the current standard of 
care. 
 
4.[ADDRESS_1132423] 230 patients [14, 15, 20-40] with ALA doses up to 60 mg/kg. No serious adverse 
e
vents or reactions have been reported; however, skin photosensitivity, nausea and 
vomiting, liver function abnormalities and some other events (as outlined below have 
been temporally related to ALA administration). 
 
4.7.1 SKIN PHOTOSENSITIVITY 
 
Since
 ALA-induced PpIX accumulation occurs mostly in cells of epi[INVESTIGATOR_412261], 
accumulation in skin and subsequent cutaneous injury after sun exposure has been 
reported.  Four volunteers, who ingested doses of ALA ranging from 12.5 to 35 mg/kg, 
developed photosensitization of skin (but no sunburns) that persisted for approximately 
24 hours [3 7], and a severe sunburn occurred 8 hours after a 10 mg/kg load in a volunteer 
who was exposed to bright light [38].  The reactions reported in clinical PDT trials (30-60 
 
CASE 1305 Protocol Version dated 09.15 .17 Page 15 of 30  
 mg/kg) were usually mild, consisted mainly of erythema or a “mild photosensitivity 
reaction” and resolved within 24 to 48 hours.  Blister formation and skin necrosis has not

ased on this evidence, the patients in our study will receive written and verbal 
instructions regarding skin exposure to ambient light (see Appendix I).  They will be 
advised to stay indoors for 1 day (24 hours), cover exposed parts of their bodies, and 
prote
ct their eyes from direct sun rays, strong fluorescent or incandescent lighting (e.g. a 
dentist's lamp or examining light) or strong residential direct indoor lighting (e.g. direct 
sunlight through a window for more than for more than a few minutes, direct spotlights, 
floodlights, etc.) for this period.  After [ADDRESS_1132424] been reported.  Nausea was 
seen during the administration of hourly fractionated doses [21,30,31,34] or immediately 
a
fter bolus administration [24,29,37] (i.e., in approximately 2/3 of patients given 60 
mg
/kg and 1/3 of patients given 30 mg/kg).  Vomiting occurred about [ADDRESS_1132425] [2 4,25,26,29,31,35,37].   
I
n two studies up to 2/3 of patients given 60 mg/kg and 1/5 of those given 30 mg/kg had 
elevat ed AST levels [21,30].  This rise was small in most other reports, but in these two 
studies (possibly describing the same series of patients), 3 patients had levels 3 to 5 times 
above normal.  In all studies but one, the abnormalities resolved 72 hours later:  5 of 18 
pa
tients’ transaminases normalized in 10 days and one patient with a history of excessive 
alcohol intake had elevated levels at 30 days [34].  Only nine patients in these studies had 
tra
nsient elevations in bilirubin (less than two times normal).  No study correlated the 
liver function test abnormalities with the occurrence of nausea and vomiting in individual 
pa
tients. Based on this experience, follow-up in our patients will consist of testing of liver 
function tests at [ADDRESS_1132426] tumor resection and, if > than Grade 3, weekly for 2 weeks  
and then at monthly intervals thereafter to resolution.

5.1 ENDPOINTS 
 
Obje
ctives: The endpoints are detection of residual tumor and of normal tissue. The 
primary endpoint will be correspondence between intensity of in vivo fluorescence and 
PpIX concentration and th e pathologist’s quantification of tumor in biopsy specimens, 
e.g. percent tumor present. The measures used in the secondary  objective will be PpIX 
concentration, g/mg and intra-operative fluorescence intensity.  Measures used in the 
third objective  will be the biopsy specimen’s fluorescence intensity and the MR image 
enhancement at the biopsy site’s intraoperative stereotactic coordinates as determined by 
[CONTACT_11065]. 
 
5.2 DATA ANALYSIS 
 
5.2.1 FLUORESCENCE INTENSITY LEVELS VS. HISTOPATHOLOGY 
 
The
 data sets will be collated into the 4 study groups (2 ALA doses and 2 study arms --
i.e., ne
wly diagnosed and recurrent diagnosis) for analysis purposes. 
 
Histopathology of the 1st part of the biopsies, performed by a single experienced 
neuropathologist (i.e., [CONTACT_817758])  will be used as the gold standard. The white-
light,  fluorescence images, and intra-operative PpIX concentration readings will be 
compared to assess the sensitivity and specificity for biopsy-confirmed visible tumor.  
 
5.2.2 Intra-operative vs. Ex Vivo  PpIX EXTRACTION ASSAY 
 
The intra-operatively determined PpIX concentration will be compared to the intra-
operative imaging, ex vivo PpIX concentration, and MR enhancement images. This 
analysis will facilitate an assessment of the utility of lower ALA doses for enhancing 
subj
ective and/or quantitative contrast of tumor versus background fluorescence and/or 
PpIX concentration.

8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
8.1 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN 
Primary objective : We will assess 2 doses of 5-ALA, 10m g/kg and 20m g/k g, to 
determine the optimum ALA dose in terms of both sensitivity and specificity for residual 
tumor.   The endpoint will be correspondence between intensity of in vivo fluorescence 
and PpIX concentration and the pathologist’s quantification of tumor in biopsy 
specimens, e.g. percent tumor present.   Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves 
will
 be calculated for each of the 2 combinations of ALA dose to estimate a level of 
fluor
escence that distinguishes residual tumor from normal tissue with large true positive 
fraction (TPF) and small false positive fraction (FPF). A joint 95% confidence region for 
TPF FPF will be calculated, using α*=1-sqrt(1- α) = 0.975 and univariate confidence 
limits for the individual probabilities. Having chosen the cut-points for each of the 4 
combinations, positive and negative predictive values and diagnostic likelihood ratios 
will be calculated to describe the characteristics of each [18].  
 
To 
compare the test characteristics of each ALA dose and to assess how the test 
characteristics are affected by [CONTACT_44009], disease, and surgical characteristics we will 
 
CASE [ADDRESS_1132433] errors to account for the correlation of samples taken from the same 
individual. 
 
Secondary Objective : We will assess the correlation between the recorded in vivo 
qualitative assessment of flouresence signal from the neurosurgeon with the post-surgical 
(i.e., ex vivo ) absolute  PpIX concentration detected in ex vivo tissue biopsies.  The 
surge
on will subjectively score the intra-operatively observed fluorescence level as 
follows: 0, no fluorescence, 1, low fluorescence, 2, moderate fluorescence, or 3, high 
fluorescence [after 16].   We will first graph fluorescence against each PpIX concentration 
measurement (intraoperative and ex vivo ) to evaluate the shape of the relationship. 
Additionally we will calculate a Spearman’s correlation coefficient with 95% confidence 
interval to assess the correlation between fluorescence against each PpIX concentration 
measurement (intraoperative and ex vivo ).  The sensitivity and specificity of these 
observations will be determined [after 16], where the sensitivity of observable 
intraoperative PpIX fluorescence is the probability of observable intraoperative 
fluorescence given the presence of tumor cells in the tissue and specificity is the 
probability of no observable intraoperative fluorescence given that there are no tumor 
cells in the tissue [16]. We will also explore whether dose, patient, and disease 
characteristics affect the strength of the relationship between these measurements using 
multivariable generalized mixed models.  
  
T
ertiary Objective: To determine the association  between the presence of fluorescence in 
the surgical cavity and the post-operative image enhancement on MRI. This includes the 
relationship between the amount and location of residual tumor detected by [CONTACT_74064] , 
P
pIX concentration, and intra-operative frameless stereotaxy following maximal 
resection versus the amount and location of tumor imaged post-operatively via CT and/or 
MR
I.  Assessment of agreement between fluorescence, intra-operative PpIX 
c
oncentration, and MR intensity will be explored using the radiologist’s assessment of 
MR intensity, measured on an ordinal scale. A multivariable ordinal logistic model will 
be fitted to assess the strength of the relationship and whether dose, patient or disease 
characteristics affect the relationship. 
 
All models for all objectives will be fitted with robust standard errors to account for 
correlation between specimens taken from the same individual. Statistical models will be 
examined for goodness of fit; residual and influence statistics will be computed to ensure 
that outlying values do not have a disproportionate effect on the final models. 
8.2 SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL POWER   
Our 
study is powered appropriately for determination of the primary objective which 
involves the assessment of 2 doses of 5-ALA, 10m g/kg and 20m g/kg, to determine the 
optimum ALA dose in terms of both sensitivity and specificity for residual tumor.  We 
calculate the total sample size for 80% power at the 0.05 significance level, given that the 
sensitivity will decrease by 15% with decreasing ALA dose within patient group (i.e. 
newly diagnosed or recurrent).  Therefore our null hypothesis is that the sensitivity of the 
10mg/kg dose is less than or equal to 15% different from the 20 mg/kg dose and the 
 
CASE 1305 Protocol Version dated 09.15 .17 Page 21 of 30  
 alternative hypothesis is that the sensitivity of the 10mg/kg dose is greater than 15% 
different from the 20 mg/kg dose.  We also take into account having multiple biopsies per 
individual on study.  The total sample size per group per dose is as follows: 
 
The primary objective of this Phase II study is to estimate and compare the combined 
diagnostic accuracy of in-vivo qualitative assessment of fluorescent signal in detecting 
residual tumor when used by [CONTACT_817751]  2 doses of 5-ALA:  10 mg/kg and 
20 mg/kg.   The in-vivo qualitative assessment by [CONTACT_817752] 0 (no signal) to 3 (highest signal), as was done in a simila r 
study reported by [CONTACT_781163] (J Neurosurg 2010 Apr 9, epub ahead of print) using a 
dose of 20 mg/kg in newly diagnosed gliomas. As in Roberts et al, we assume a score of  
1 or higher will be considered positive.   In the study by [CONTACT_781163] (2010) the reported 
sensitivity and specificity were 0.[ADDRESS_1132434].  In this study, because having high sensitivity and specificity 
are both important in terms of avoiding false negatives (which would involve not 
removing residual tissue) and false positives (removing normal tissue), the Youden index, 
defined as Sensitivity + Specificity -1 will be used as an overall  measure of diagnostic 
accuracy.  This study is designed so that if the dose levels of 10 and 20 mg/kg have true 
Youde
n indices that differ by 0.10 or more, then the probability is 80% or higher that the 
observed Youden index will be higher for the group with the higher actual index, i.e., the 
probability of selecting the correct dose level based on observed Youden indices will be 
80% or higher.    
For each patient, samples will be removed from six sites (2 center of tumor, 2 edge of 
tumor, and 2 adjacent normal tissue).  It is assumed that on average, three samples will be 
tumor positive based on pathology, and three will be tumor negative.  Thus, on average, 
ea
ch subject will contribute 3 true positive samples (used in estimating sensitivity), and 3 
true negatives (used in estimating specificity).  If n subjects per stratum (new or 
recurrent) are studied at a given dose, and π and θ are the sensitivity and specificity, we 
assume that the estimated sensitivity and specificity obtained as the proportions of true 
positives and true negatives are approximately normally distributed with means   π and θ 
and respective variances   π(1- π)(1+2 )/3n, and θ (1- θ)(1+2 )/3n, whe re  is the within-
subj
ect correlation of binary responses obtained for tissues on the same subject. This 
formula can be derived for example assuming a beta-binomial model to model extra-
binomial variability. Here the term (1+2 ) is the design effect where the coefficient of  
is m-1, where m is the number of true positive or true negative samples per subject.  
Given specified values of sensitivity and specificity for the two doses reflecting a 
scenario where Youden indices differ between doses, the probability that the better dose 
has the higher observed Youden index can be determined, and the sample size n 
determined such that this probability is high.

probability of correctly identifying the optimal dose, when the Youden indices of the two 
doses differ by 0.10, using a range of plausible values for sensitivity and specificity, for 
intrasubject correlations of  =0.1 and 0.2.  Based on these results it can be seen that 
with sample sizes of 30 glioblastoma multiforme s (GBMs ) there is a 80% or higher

 chance of correctly identifying the optimal dose when Youden indices differ by 0.10 
or more. Assuming sample size n=[ADDRESS_1132436] correlation =0.2, the 95% 
confidence intervals for π=0.75, θ=0.70, and youden index=0.45 are (0.64, 0.86), 
(0.59, 0.81), and (0.23, 0.67), respectively.

However, based on imaging, it is difficult to distinguish Grade IV malignant gliomas 
(GBM s) from  Grade III tumors, otherwise known as anaplastic astrocytomas (AAs) in 
newly diagnosed patients.   Traditionally, AA’s account for 10-15% of all malignant 
gliomas with a rate of 11.1% reported for the US in 2010 (41).   Assuming that 15% of all 
patients with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas have AA rather than GBM, we will 
need to accrue [ADDRESS_1132438] “recurrent GBM” by [CONTACT_559].  Patients carrying a diagnosis of AA who have 
recurrent have degenerated to GBM approximately half the time.   Accordingly, of [ADDRESS_1132439] progressed to GBM.    
 
Thus, in order to accrue 30 patients with newly diagnosed GBM, we will need to accrue 
35 patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma.   In order to accrue 30 patients with 
recurrent GBM, we will need to accrue 33 patients with recurrent malignant glioma. 
 
There are no planned interim analyses for efficacy because this is not a therapeutic trial. 
Monitoring of safety and trial progress will be the responsibility of the Data and Safety 
Toxicity Committee.

12.0 APPENDIX I: SKIN PHOTOSENSITIVITY DUE TO ALA 
 
Patient Information and Instructions 
 
The drug you receive during this study is called ALA (which stands for Aminolevulinic Acid).  It 
collects in all tissues, including the skin.  The amount of ALA that will be used is much less than 
the usual amount given when ALA is used for treatments. However, after receiving the ALA, we 
recommend the following precautions for 24 hours: 
 
 
1.  No direct sun exposure. 
 
During this time, exposure to sunlight may cause a severe sunburn.  This can be prevented by 
[CONTACT_817755], either by [CONTACT_817756].  Sun protection 
creams of any strength are not effective. Sunglasses, facemasks, gloves, long sleeves and pants 
are required during this time if you are out in the sun. Direct sunlight through a window should 
also be avoided. Brief times (one minute or less) in weak sunlight are safe and may help 
desensitize you to sunlight.  
 
2.  No exposure to strong indoor lights. 
 
During this time, exposure to strong indoor lighting may also cause a severe burn.  Examples of 
such lighting are: tanning booths, a dentist’s lamp, a doctor’s examining lamp, an operating room 
lamp, a direct spotlight or floodlight, and strong bathroom vanity lights.  Ordinary room lights 
and reading lamps with shades are safe and will also help to desensitize your skin.  You do not 
need to stay in a completely dark room or to cover your skin and eyes while indoors. In the 
operating room, appropriate precautions will be taken to avoid strong light exposure.  
 
 
At the end of the 24-hour period, we recommend that you expose a small area of skin (like the 
back of your hand) to sunlight for five minutes.  If there is no sunburn by [CONTACT_58079], you 
probably have no more ALA left in your skin. You may then return to normal light exposure. 
 
If at any time a prickly or burning feeling or a skin reddening is experienced after exposure to the 
bright light, please call us at the numbers below and remain in dim light until symptoms have 
disappeared.  
 
If you experience any other unusual reaction please call the numbers below.

APPENDIX II: DESCRIPTION OF THE FLUORESCENCE IMAGING SYSTEM 
 
 
This fluorescence imaging system is 
specifically designed for surgical 
procedures. It consists of a compact 
surgical camera that has 720x480 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_817735] 30 
frames/sec. It is multispectral. i.e. it 
can simultaneously detect 3 
wavelength bands simultaneously 
(400-500nm, 500-600nm, and 600-
700nm). This system is hand-held 
and a standard laparoscope is used 
as entrance optics. The excitation 
light source is a 300W xenon lamp, 
similar to lamps used for 
endoscopy, which has a spi[INVESTIGATOR_817736] 2 different 
wavelength bands are used for 
excitation (440nm,  80nm FWHM 
(150mW) and 470nm, 60nm 
FWHM (240mW)). When the 
illuminated area is [ADDRESS_1132443] (i.e. a fluorescent crystal 
attached to a fiber optic cable) with known fluorescence that 
will be placed in the surgical cavity to serve as a reference.  
The computer and software allow to display and store the 
fluorescence images as well as more quantitative ratio images in real time. In addition, 
these images can be displayed on the monitors available in the OR for surgical guidance.      
 
The system is has electrical approvals by [CONTACT_817757] (CSA) and 
Underwriter Laboratories Inc. (UL) and is currently being used in a clinical trial for 
fluorescence guided detection of residual tumor after prostatectomy using ALA-PpIX at 
University Health Network, Toronto (Dr. J. Trachtenberg and Dr. B.C. Wilson).   
 
This s
ystem will be used in this clinical trial.

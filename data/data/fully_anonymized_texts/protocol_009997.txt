  1. Background and Rationale  
1.1 Biology- Guided Radiotherapy: Core Principle and Clinical Benefit  
The RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System  (RMRS)  is a hybrid imaging -therapy system that is designed 
to enable  delivery of biology -guided radiotherapy (BgRT) , a novel radiotherapy technique  that aims to 
improve the conformality and precision with w hich external beam radiotherapy is delivered to malignant 
lesions, including those that are in motion. This system functions by [CONTACT_408441] ( PET) emissions emanating from a tumor to direct beamlets of external radiotherapy back to 
the lesion with sub -second latency. This core process can be repeated until a desired total dose of external 
radiation is delivered to a CT -defined target volume anchored in space to the PET profile of the tumor. In 
this way, the PET profile of the tumor acts as an endogenous biological fiducial.  
 BgRT is expected to improve radiation delivery for two reasons. Firstly, the use of the lesion’s own PET profile as a fiducial enables increased confidence in lesion localization during therapy, which in turn allows the radiation oncologist to reduce posit ional margins at treatment planning that account for set -up error 
and patient shifts; said differently, BgRT improves the conformality  of radiotherapy dose to the lesion by 
[CONTACT_408442] a static shift at the tim e of treatment. The 
benefit of reduced margins around gross disease extent is that the surrounding normal tissue is exposed 
to less radiation, including at the high ablative dose range, which may result in a lower burden of acute 
toxicity and long- term mor bidity.  
 Secondly, BgRT addresses the challenge of motion management  for mobile tumors by [CONTACT_408443] -second (350 -400 ms) latency. The aggregate 
effect of delivering a series of radiation beamlets  this way is to effectively deliver a tracked dose 
distribution. This is a beneficial departure from current internal target volume (ITV) techniques that 
require ablation of the entire envelope of a tumor’s motion path plus margin in order to ensure tumor coverage at all times
1–3. The fact that ITV approaches require more ablation of normal tissues to ensure 
coverage during tumor motion comes at the cost of clinically -evident patient toxicities arising from those 
injured tissues4–7.  
 In summary, by [CONTACT_2329] a tumor’s own biology as a fiducial signal, BgRT has the potential to improve the therapeutic index of radiotherapy through improved conformality and by [CONTACT_408444][INVESTIGATOR_1516].   
 
1.[ADDRESS_515269] be directed to significant margin s around the target or even the target’s entire path of 
motion in case there is variation in the target’s position or motion at the time of treatment.  BgRT 
improves upon  this technique  by [CONTACT_408445]’s position and 
motion at the time of treatment delivery, which in turn may reduce the amount of normal anatomy that 
must be incidentally subjected to ablative radiotherapy. For achieving this outcome, the BgRT algorithm 
enables a linear accelerator system to capture sub -second PET acquisitions from a target , which are 
RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol   
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential    985- [ZIP_CODE] v5.0 
  10 of 67
  termed limited -time sample (LTS) PET images , and to respond with beamlets of radiotherapy (partial 
fluences). This cycle is then repeated until the full intended  dose of external beam radiotherapy is 
delivered to the target. Importantly, the portion  of the LTS PET images used to guide beamlets is c onfined 
to a  physician -defined  anatomic region, termed the B iology -tracking zone ( see section 1.3.2 ), that 
corresponds  to the motion envelope of the target tumor . This feature prevents radiotherapy beamlets  
from being directed at  PET emissions originating away from the tumor.  
Given the reactive nature of the beam delivery, the BgRT algorithm cannot optimize for machine -
deliverable fluence directly because rigid predeterm ination of machine instructions would not be capable 
of adjusting to a fluctuating LTS PET profile. Instead, the BgRT algorithm optimizes for fluence indirectly  
by [CONTACT_147572] a transfer function, termed the firing matrix, that can translate a target’s PET  profile  into 
the desired fluence. To achieve this, the BgRT algorithm relies on a full PET dataset captured ahead of 
BgRT delivery to calculate an operator, termed a “firing filter” -  that can convert this full PET image into a 
complete radiotherapy fluen ce that meets the physician’s objectives for target coverage and organ -at-risk 
avoidance. This optimization is similar to  intensity -modulated radiotherapy  (IMRT ) algorithms that rely  on 
a standard cost function that can iterate among candidate firing filters until those physician -defined 
objectives are best optimized.  
After  the firing matrix is calculated using a full PET image, it can then  be applied to LTS PET images to 
generate pa rtial fluences. Importantly, adding all the partial fluences generated from a series of 
sequentially obtained LTS images is mathematically expected to sum to the complete fluence goals of the 
physician . This follows from the fact that the firing matrix is confined by [CONTACT_408446] 
a linear, shift -invariant operator, which in turn means that the principle of linear superposition applies to 
the conversion of LTS PET images to partial fluences. This principle  ensures that, just as the sequential LTS 
images sum to a full PET image, the partial fluences will sum to the complete intended fluence. Figure [ADDRESS_515270] as the limited -time sample ( LTS) images, Xt, sum to the 
full PET image X, the derived partial fluences sum to the complete intended fluence.  BTZ: Biology -tracking zone

  Finally, a tumor’s PET profile and, by [CONTACT_66250], its constituent LTS images can vary from one radiotracer 
administration to the next due to a variety of biological, physiological, and logistical factors. Therefore, 
BgRT treatment planning algorithm  genera tes a range of possible radiotherapy dose distributions to 
reflect these possible variations in tumor motion and tumor contrast. As described below, prior to every 
radiotherapy delivery, the system checks that the PET profile on that day (and the resulting  fluence) fall 
within that spectrum, or otherwise the treatment must be aborted. Of note, preliminary evidence suggests that variation s in PET profile  over the course of standard ablative radiotherapy  are expected to 
be modest , at least in the case of FDG

1.3 BgRT Workflow  
The basic workflow for conventional radiotherapy acts as a foundation  for BgRT . In essence, t he BgRT 
workflow includes the typi[INVESTIGATOR_408423]. These  processes include the core 
steps of prescription, simulation, treatment plan ning, and treatment delivery9–12. For context BgRT 
treatment delivery directed at a patient is described in section 1.3.[ADDRESS_515271] ,  but the study investigation replaces this step with emulated delivery, which establishes anatomic 
dose distribution using offline tools , as later described .   
Summary of core  workflow steps used in conventional radiotherapy:  
1. Prescription: The radiation oncologist determines  that a patient requires radiotherapy as part of their 
cancer care. The clinician  then s elects  the target,  radiation dose, fraction size, and schedule for the 
treatment. The p rescription process also includes specifying the tolerance limits for normal tissu es 
near  the target, which are also known as organs -at-risk (OAR).  
2. Simulation: The patient  is placed  in a CT simulator in a desired position along with immobilization 
devices like customized cradles or head -masks to reduce shifts.  CT images  are obtained  in that 
position and used  to plan treatment. In modern radiotherapy, four -dimensional (4D) CT image sets 
are often acquired to capture the differing positions of tumor across natural processes such as the 
inhalation -exhalation respi[INVESTIGATOR_50126].  
3. Treatment Planning: The radiation oncologist o utlin es targets and OARs  on the simulation CT image, 
a process also known as “contouring” .  Contouring is followed by r adiation delivery planning which 
entails in silico modeling of external beam delivery . This modeling includes the selection of differing 
particle types, particle energies, beam angles and beam intensities to achieve desired goals for target 
coverage and OAR avoidance. The approved in silico  plan is then verified independently in a process 
called  “quality assurance ” (QA). During QA , the linear accelerator actually delivers the approved 
treatment plan into a physical phantom that can measure the delivered dose and distribution of 
radiation. The measured dose and distribution is checked to ensure that it is  concordant to an in silico  
model of plan delivery into a digital facsimile of the physical phantom.

  12 of 67
  4. Treatment Delivery: The patient is set- up and immobilized on the linear accelerator couch in the same 
position  as the CT simulation .  Alignment is verified  using external markers and on -board imaging, and 
then the approved radiation plan is delivered  from the linear accelerator. Each such treatment is 
called a frac tion. This step is repeated until all planned fractions of the radiotherapy  course  have been  
delivered. Every five fractions, the radiation oncologist typi[INVESTIGATOR_408424].  
BgRT adds to this conventional workflow by [CONTACT_408447]: The PET 
Imaging -Only Session  during treatment planning and the PET PreScan  and LTS image acquisition  at 
treatment delivery. These BgRT  modifications to the conventional radiotherapy workflow are detailed  
below .  
1.3.1 Prescription  
At the time of the patient’s initial encounter with a radiation oncologist, the patient must be deemed a 
candidate for biology -guided radiotherapy. As with convention al radiotherapy, this requires that the 
radiation oncologist first make a determination that radiotherapy itself is indicated. The radiation 
oncologist also specifies the usual parameters of the prescription: Dose, target volumes, coverage goals, 
and avoid ance parameters for OARs. The next decision point for biology -guided radiotherapy is for the 
clinician to determine whether BgRT might confer therapeutic advantages to the patient via improved 
conformality and motion management compared to conventional radiotherapy. If so, the radiation 
oncologist can review any previously obtained diagnostic PET/CT images to determine qualitatively  
whether the target lesion appears to have adequate FDG activity over background, such that a more rigorous, quantitative  assessment of BgRT candidacy on the RefleXion system itself is warranted.  
General guidance for adequate FDG avidity for BgRT candidacy, as observed on a previously -obtained 
diagnostic PET/CT, is that the maximum tumor SUV  is [ADDRESS_515272] simulation prior to RMRS PET Imaging -Only Session  is necessary because the PET 
Imaging- Only Session requires an overlay of (4D)CT -defined contours, which act to narrow down the 
anatomic location for PET emission collection. Specifically, a Biology -tracking zone (BTZ) defined as the 
motion envelope of the tumor on the (4D)CT image set plus a margin must be delineated ahead of the 
RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol   
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential    985- [ADDRESS_515273]- defined tumor t argets (GTV, CTV, PTV) and nearby [CONTACT_250011] -at-risk (OARs) are also 
contoured based upon the CT simulation images.  
At the PET Imaging -Only Session itself, the patient is injected with FDG and, after an approximate [ADDRESS_515274] simulation are likewise deployed. Next, 
the patient’s alignment is fine- tuned with CT -guidance using RefleXion’s on -board fanbeam  kVCT , and the 
patient is moved on the treatment couch such that the PET detector arcs on the RefleXion system are 
aligned with the region of interest containing the target tumor.  
Next, the PET detector arcs capture PET emission data and generate a PET im age. Of note, the time 
window for imaging relative to the injection must be controlled so that the activity is not  too high , which 
could saturate the detectors,  or too low secondary to  FDG decay, which would result in inadequate PET 
activity for BgRT . Afte r the PET emission data is collected , several steps occur to formally assess for BgRT 
candidacy and, if appropriate, to generate a high quality BgRT treatment plan.  
At the RMRS Device : 
1. The patient’s ( 4D)CT-defined BTZ is overlaid on the RMRS PET  image. This overlay is enabled by [CONTACT_408448], which indexes the CT anatomy obtained in the treatment position on the 
day of the PET Imaging- Only Session to the CT anatomy obtained previously at CT s imulation. Once 
the PET image is formed, the radiation oncologist confirms that the tumor in the PET image can, in 
fact, be visualized and localized to within the BTZ as expected.  
Notably,  the BTZ overlay is a volume based upon (4D)CT images generated on a commercial, third -
party Sim CT device. Therefore, in addition to capturing PET information for the BgRT algorithm, this 
step also acts to verify the location accuracy of the RMRS PET  imag e as compared to an external 
reference standard.  
The patient may leave the department once the RMRS PET  image is acquired and validated by [CONTACT_408449]. Provided that localization/visualization of the tumor PET image within the BTZ is 
confirme d by [CONTACT_280545], the PET data is then transmitted to the treatment planning

2. Specific quantitative parameters of the tumor PET image are  calculated by [CONTACT_408450] a viable option for BgRT planning and treatment delivery.  
These quantitative criteria for BgRT candidacy include:  
a. Activity Concentration: Greater than 5 kBq/ml

RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential    985- [ZIP_CODE] v5.0 
  14 of 67
  b. Tumor signal- to-background ratio as measured by [CONTACT_408451] ( NTS): Greater 
than 2.7  
Notably, these values are indexed to RefleXion’s software and hardware architecture as well as the 
patient’s radiotherapy treatment position. Therefore, they cannot be extrapolated from a third -party 
PET/CT .  
3. The physician also qualitatively assesses the following:  
a. FDG -avid OARs are outside the BTZ  
b. No FDG -avid structures aside from  the tumor are in the BTZ.  
If all of the qualitative and quantitative criteria are met, the PET emission data from within the BTZ can be 
incorporated into the treatment planning software for the BgRT algorithm’s dose calculations. As described in detail in the I nvestigator Brochure (IB) and summarized in section 1.2 , the algorithm acts to 
optimize a firing matrix that converts PET projections to a machine -deliverable fluence such that the 
fluence in turn meets traditional radiotherapy dose objectives, such as coverage goals for the target and  
avoidance metrics for OARs.  
An important feature of a BgRT treatment plan is that it presents the clinician with a bounded dose volume 
histogram (DVH), which is significantly more detailed than a traditional dose volume histogram  used in  
conventional rad iotherapy systems. In a bounded DVH (bDVH) , the nominal plan based on the tumor’s 
PET appearance  on the day of the imaging session is indicated graphically by [CONTACT_408452] s as per the usual 
DVH format . However, the bDVH also includes  bands around these lines , which are calculated in order to 
visualize  how dose and coverage would  change in response to variations  in tumor PET signal or tumor 
motion encountered on the day of treatment.    
To complete treatment planning, the clinician  is recommended to create a back -up conventional SBRT 
plan based only on the CT simulation images, which can be used in scenarios where BgRT is unable to be 
delivered on the day of treatment (as described in the IB).  
As with conventional workflows, both completed treatment plans –  BgRT and back -up SBRT -  are then 
finalized by a dosimetrist and reviewed by a radiation oncologist for final approval. The standard practice 
of reviewing anatomic isodose lines and dose  volume histograms for target coverage and OAR avoidance 
is done with the additional nuance that BgRT requires review of a bounded DVH as described above and 
in the IB.  
Next, standard quality assurance (QA) is performed by a qualified medical physicist, which consists of the 
approved plans undergoing a dry run on the linear accelerator with a physical phantom placed on the 
couch to measure the dose and distribution of actually delivered therapeutic radiation
13. The measured 
dose is compared to in silico modeled delivery of the BgRT plan into a digital scan of the test phantom. 
For BgRT, confirmation that the physical delivery and modeled delivery are concordant is assessed using 
standard gamma index methods. Of note,  the phantom test utilizes the PET info rmation used by [CONTACT_408453] . Once quality assurance is complete , the BgRT plan receives a final 
RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol  
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential   985-[ADDRESS_515275] simulation and the PET Imaging- Only Session. The patient’s alignment is 
fine-tuned using CT guidance with RefleXion’s on -board fanbeam kVCT . As was the case during the imaging 
session, this alignment is made possibl e by [CONTACT_408454] -board CT images to the images acquired at CT 
simulation. The (4D)CT -defined BTZ is also again overlaid on the indexed images.   
Next, a PET PreScan  is obtained, which represents a second new step in troduced by  [CONTACT_408455]. 
The PE T PreScan  image  analysis , termed the PET Evaluation, is a critical safety interlock wherein the 
RefleXion system checks whether the pattern and quantitative characteristics of PET emissions observed 
in the BTZ on the day of treatment are consistent , within a tolerance threshold , to the PET emission profile 
observed during the PET Imaging- Only Session (upon which the BgRT plan is based). As with the PET 
Imaging -Only Session criteria, the checked parameters are calibrated to the RefleXion system hardware 
and software and cannot be meaningfully extrapolated from a different vendor’s system.  
The specifics of the PET PreScan process are as follows . Firstly , the PreS can itself, which is a short -duration 
RMRS PET acquisition, is performed  to gene rate a PET image  of the anatomic region containing the target . 
The user reviews the image set  to visually confirm  that the tumor PET image is localized within the (4D)CT -
defined BTZ. The user can also assess whether FDG -activity from neighboring OAR s remains outside of the  
BTZ. Both of these localization features  need to be  verified  in order to continue with BgRT . In addition to 
the PET image review, CT images from the alignment process can provide  further confirmation of the 
relative position s of targets and OARs  as is done in  conventional radiotherapy .   
Next, t he RefleXion system quantifies characteristics of the PET emission data from the PET PreScan  to 
assure consistency with the PET imaging session. This is a critical safety interlock that occurs prior to activating the linear accelerator for BgRT delivery. These quantitative criteria include: 
1. Confirmation of Activity Concentration greater than 5 kBq/ml  
2. Confirmation that the tumor NTS larger than a threshold of 2, which allows for a value that is 25% 
lower than the NTS observed at PET Imaging -Only Session  
3. Predicted DVH: The RefleXion system calculates a BgRT dose distribution that is anticipated to b e 
delivered based upon the short -duration emission profile of the PET PreScan. Th is Predicted DVH of 
the BTZ and OAR distribution ( DVH
Predicted )is confirmed to be “within the bounds” of the bDVH in the 
approved BgRT plan. This calculation involves confirmi ng that 95% of the points on the DVH Predicted  
for the BTZ and OARs fall within the approved bDVH.  
If, in conjunction with visual localization of the tumor  within the BTZ , all of these quantitative 
requirements for PET emission quality are met, then the user is allowed to proceed with BgRT delivery. 
RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol   
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential    985- [ADDRESS_515276]  LTS PET emission data, and the linear 
accelerator and multi- leaf co llimator (MLC)’s are instructed to direct partial fluences  to the target in 
response to those LTS images in a continuous closed -loop system directed by [CONTACT_408456] .  
If any of the above quantitative parameters are not met, then the user is locked ou t of using BgRT during 
that session and has the choice of either rescheduling therapy or substituting another mode of 
radiotherapy (i.e. SBRT) for that fraction. The reasons for not meeting the parameters may be due to 
intrinsic changes in the PET profile of the tumor or surrounding OARs, but may also be due to process 
issues, examples of which include misadministration of FDG at the time of injection or administration of 
a batch of FDG with poor activity due to manufacturing errors upstream at the FDG vend or 14.

To complete the course of treatment, the patient undergoes as many fractions of biology -guided 
radiotherapy as prescribed by [CONTACT_280545]. The PET PreScan  is required before each fraction 
of therapy. A weekly on -treatment visit is also recommen ded as per standard radiotherapy practice.  
As mentioned previously , this description refers to the envisioned BgRT product  where treatment delivery 
is directed at the patient.  This IDE study does not direct the external radiation at the patient because in 
vivo measurement of dose delivery accuracy is not feasible. Instead, as detailed  in sections [ADDRESS_515277] and measure anatomic dose distribution  using 
offline software tools and phanto ms, an investigation al technique that is termed “ emulated delivery ”.

  1.5 BgRT  Evidence  Landscape: Technical and Clinical Evidence  
In general, radiotherapy device validation evidence can be either Technical or Clinical.  
The technical  evidence includes experiments conducted outside a clinical context, such as dosimetric and 
physics investigations , that validate performance and functioning of the radiotherapy device. This body of 
evidence is essential because it entails measurement of critical quantities that cannot otherwise be 
measured. The most important exam ple is the use of physical phantoms, which enable the measurement 
of the actual dose and distribution of therapeutic radiation delivered by a linear accelerator, metrics that 
cannot be measured directly in vivo . Comparison of the actually delivered dose distribution in a phantom 
to a corresponding model ed dose distribution in a digital facsimile of the same phantom constitutes the 
core methodology for assuring linear accelerator performance.  
For BgRT, technical validation follows this precedent:  The measur ement of actually delivered radiation 
dose and distribution can be evaluated  directly in an FDG- avid physical phantom (“FDG -phantom”) that 
mimics the conditions of an FDG -avid tumor. Furthermore , the accuracy of this  delivery can be confirmed 
via compariso n to modeled delivery in a digital facsimile of the FDG- phantom .  Experiments such as these 
form the foundational base of evidence for assessing the performance of radiotherapy techniques  in 
general, and such technical evidence remains necessary and indisp ensable for BgRT.  
At the same time, this technical evidence can be supplemented by [CONTACT_10070] -conceived clinical evidence 
obtained in a real- world practice setting. To that end, the present investigational device exemption (IDE) 
study aims to clinically validate RefleXion BgRT performance by [CONTACT_408457]-to-end system  functioning 
using human subject data obtained in the context of radiation oncology practice . The study’s first primary 
objective is to test  the PET subsystem and to identify  the Recommende d RefleXion FDG Dose(RRFD) that 
enables the use of BgRT. The second primary objective is to assess end -to-end BgRT performance by 
[CONTACT_408458]. Additional objectives 
are to comprehensively characterize all key features  in the BgRT process  including PET imaging 
performance; BgRT plan creation , approval, and quality assurance ; physical deliverability of BgRT fluence ; 
workflow performance ; and safety  associated with  multiple FDG administrations .  
Importantly , clinical validation of BgRT across the entire scope of radiotherapy indications is not feasible . 
Therefore, i n choosing a study pop ulation, advantageous features are that the population (1) entails a 
degree of homogeneity in clinical characteristics to inform useful conclusions while (2) still being 
reasonably generalizable t o a broad range of malignant conditions, especially when this clinical evidence 
is combined with a strong foundation of technical validation. To that end, the proposed IDE investigation 
focuses on two anatomic locations –  the lung and osseous compartments –  which together are 
representative  of a comprehensive spectrum of scenarios for which biology -guided radiotherapy can be 
utilized . 
Tumors in the lung are an important, representative use case for motion management in radiotherapy because they undergo excursion with respi[INVESTIGATOR_408425]. Furthermore, confo rmality is necessary 
in these tumors because of their close proximity to multiple organs at risk in the thorax and upper 
RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol   
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential    985- [ADDRESS_515279] between FDG -avid tumors and the background tissue  (lung parenchyma ). Given these 
characteristics, lung tumors represent one end of the range  for motion  and PET contrast  against which 
the viability of a radiotherapy modality like BgRT should  be de monstrated.  
In contrast, tumors in the bone are not subject to internal anatomic motion, but instead are subject to 
motion derived from set- up error and patient shifts during treatment. Also, the background tissue  of bon y 
lesions , which consists  of soft tissues and normal bone, has on average more inherent FDG activity than 
lung parenchyma, which reduces the contrast between osseous tumors and their  surrounding tissue. 
Therefore, demonstrating utility of BgRT in bony lesions addresses the opposite end of th e motion 
management and PET contrast  spectrum as lesions in the lung. Conformality remains of great importance 
for bone tumors as radiosensitive normal structures throughout the patient’s anatomy are in proximity to 
the skeleton. Indeed, in modern radiothe rapy, conformality is a desired feature across all anatomic 
geographies and clinical contexts.  
In light of these features,  clinical evidence derived from patients with lung and bone tumors represents a 
versatile set of real- world conditions with respect t o motion and PET environment . In combination with  
technical and benchtop experiments , this IDE seeks to provide robust  evidence for BgRT functioning and 
accuracy that can be applied to the spectrum  of malignant conditions for which radiotherapy is indicated .

4. STUDY  DESIGN  
4.1 Overview and Justification for Study Design 
In light of this new technology (BgRT) and its potential to improve radiotherapy dose distribution, we 
propose a single arm prospective study to optimize FDG dosing, assess the performance of the PET imaging subsystem for BgRT treatment planning and delivery, including its role as an interlock , and to 
validate the dose delivery performance of the end -to-end BgRT workflow.  
As described in section 1.[ADDRESS_515283] may encounter in practice. As described prev iously, patients with lung and bone 
tumors are specifically selected so that diverse omnidirectional motion profiles and different tumor- to-
background PET contrasts can be evaluated in the investigation.  
This is a single -arm, open -label, prospective study . The study will be divided into sequential cohorts of 
patients with one targetable metastatic lesion in either the lungs or bone ( Figure 3 ). Patients with multiple 
metastases can be accrued, but these investigations will focus on only one lesion per patie nt.

4.2 Cohort I: RRFD  Cohort  
This cohort will seek to iden tify the Recommended RefleXion  FDG dose  (RRFD), which is the dose of 
administered FDG  – within a range concordant with the American College of Radiology and Society of 
Pediatric Radiology Practice Parameter for Performing PET/CT in Oncology (ACR -SPR Practice Parameter) 
– that allows for functioning of the  RefleXion system15. Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_408427], this phase of 
the investigation seeks to optimize the balance  between  minimizing patient exposure to the radiotracer 
and achieving  satisfactory  performance of th e RMRS PET  subsystem for BgRT. This cohort will also seek to 
assess RMRS PET  imaging performance in comparison to a third -party diagnostic PET/CT.  
To that end , dose levels of 15 mCi and 20 mCi (if required) will be assessed sequentially in an escalation 
protocol. Patients with at least one known FDG avid tumor (i.e. SUV max≥6 on d iagnostic PET/CT) in the 
bone or lung will be enrolled into this cohort. These patients will undergo a CT simulation in an acceptable 
radiotherapy treatment position an d with immobilization devices as needed. After acquisition of (4D)CT 
images, contours for targets, OARs, and BTZ will be generated by [CONTACT_093]. Next, the patient will undergo back -to-back PET scans  on the RefleXion device and a third -party diagnost ic PET/CT device after 
a single injection of FDG at the studied  FDG dose level  (in the unlikely event that the third -party diagnostic 
PET/CT scan cannot be initiated within 180 minutes  of the FDG injection , the scan  can be completed with 
a separate FDG inj ection 24 to 96  hours after the initial FDG injection ). Quantitative metrics will be 
collected (described below) for each lesion in order to assess the performance of the RMRS PET  subsystem

  at that dose. This sequence of events is reflected in Figure 4. Actual delivery of radiotherapy to the patient 
is not part of this investigation .  
   
Figure 4. Cohort I schematic  
Primary Objective:  
The objective of this cohort study is to determine the lowest dose among candidate doses  of administered 
[18F] -FDG that results in the Activity Concentration necessary for BgRT functioning: 5 kBq/ml or higher. 
An adequate  Activity Concentration is the key parameter necessary for BgRT performance and is also the 
most sensitive quantity to FDG injection. It is  calculated from the BTZ volume and includes activity from 
both the target and the enclosed background.  To determine the RRFD, a modified 3+3 design wil l be 
utilized wherein meeting the Activity Concentration  threshold – not dose -limiting toxicity as is typi[INVESTIGATOR_21997] – will be the relevant criteria for escalating from one dose to the next ( Figure 5 ). 
The first  subjects  will receive 15 mCi [18F]- FDG.   If the Activity Concentration in [ADDRESS_515284] 3 patients is 
<5kBq/ml, accrual to this cohort will stop and the next cohort will receive 20 mCi [18F] -FDG.   If the Activity 
Concentration in [ADDRESS_515285] 3 patients is >5kBq/ml, accrual in  the [ADDRESS_515286] 5 of 6 patients at this cohort is >5kBq/ml, 15 mCi will be considered 
the RRFD.   If the Activity Concentration in two or more subjects at this cohort is <5kBq /ml, the subsequent 
group  will receive 20 mCi [18F] -FDG , and a n identical accrual schema will be followed for this group . Each 
dose -level will aim to have equal numbers of bone and lung tumors once all 6 subjects are accrued.

  The initial FDG injection dose of 15 mCi was selected based on the  internal analysis of prospective trial 
data sponsored by  [CONTACT_408460]8, design specifications, and phantom testing results. This dose 
provides a good margin for handling different patient body sizes and for assessing the validity of PET 
evaluation criteria. In order to facilitate the enrollment of a representative and relevant patient 
population, the inclusion and exclusion criteria will not impose any limitations on BMI and participant 
weight will only be limited by [INVESTIGATOR_16897]’s table weight limits.  
Secondary Objectives : Additional analyses of the RefleXion PET images will be performed to further assess 
the performance of the BgRT PET Imaging -only session, treatment planning and quality assurance at the 
studied dose level. Implied in these secondary objectives is that all other quantitative criteria for BgRT candidacy ( i.e. NTS level) are met, and that the BgRT algorithm is then able to  use the aggregate PET data 
to generate an acceptable BgRT plan that subsequently passes physics quality assurance. In other words, 
these endpoints comprehensively characterize the workflow through the steps that precede BgRT 
treatment delivery.     
These secondary endpoints will include  the following:  
1. Percent of cases where there is agreement between a site investigator and the agreement standard 
for the BgRT PET Imaging -only session localization decision (overall percent agreement). Positive 
percent agreement and negative percent agreement will also be reported.  
2. Percent of cases where there is concordance of a positive “plan proceed” decision between the BgRT 
Imaging -only session PET and a cleared, third -party diagnostic PET/CT (positive percent agreement). 
Overall percent agreement and negative percent agreement will also be reported.  
3. Percent of cases where RefleXion PET data can be used to generate an acceptable BgRT plan such that 
relevant dosimetric parameters for the target and the nearby [CONTACT_408461].  
4. Percent of cases where the intended dose distribution of the BgRT plan is achieved in a physical 
phantom, defined as meeting a standard gamma index for external beam radiotherapy quality 
assurance, i.e. whether 90% of pi[INVESTIGATOR_408426] 3mm/3% deviation standard . 
The first secondary endpoint measures inter -observer agreement for the localization decision made after 
the RMRS PET imaging session. As such, the decision made by [CONTACT_408462] a panel of independent reviewers using the same RMRS PET image with 
overlaid BTZ. The two criteria required for a positive localization decision (tumor signal within BTZ, OAR signal outside BTZ) will be captured and reported for all observers for each case. Overall percent 
agreement will constitute the main analysis, but positive percent agreement and negative percent 
agreement will also be reported. Details of this analysis are described in section 6.2.[ADDRESS_515287] -party diagnostic 
PET/CT device. Importantly, the hardware architecture of the RMRS  PET is not designed to have the same 
level of diagnostic performance as a dedicated, diagnostic PET/CT 
16. This is an expected outcome as the 
RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol  
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential   985-[ZIP_CODE] v5.0 
  24 of 67
  RMRS  PET design utilizes two 90° arcs of detectors as opposed to a full 360° ring; additionally, the RMRS 
PET has a significantly shorter field of view in the patient superior -inferior direction compared to a 
diagnostic PET/CT device. These hardware limitations in the RMRS PET  subsystem may result in a scenario 
where some tumors may not be visible in the RMRS PET  image. However, this scenario does not pose a 
radio therapy health risk to the patient as it would simply result in deciding that the patient is not a 
candidate for BgRT.  
Given these observations, the relevant question is whether a RMRS PET  image that results in a positive 
plan proceed decision – which would result in proceeding on with the BgRT workflow – is concordant with 
a third -party diagnostic PET /CT obtained on the same encounter  (positive percent agreement). Although, 
only cases with positive plan proceed decisions are clinically relevant from a BgR T workflow perspective, 
overall percent agreement  and negative percent agreement will be reported to allow a more 
comprehensive view of plan proceed decision between the BgRT Imaging- only session PET and a cleared, 
third -party diagnostic PET/CT. Details of this analysis are provided in section 6.2.4 .  
Dose Selection : As shown in Figure 5 , the RRFD  will be primarily based upon the lower F DG dose level 
where 0 to 1 failure events in the primary endpoint occur in 6 patients. If 2 or more failure events occur 
at the 15 mCi dose level, then accrual to that dose level will be stopped and subsequent patients will be enrolled at the next dose lev el (20 mCi). In the event that [ADDRESS_515288] to determine if there is a feasible protocol amendment that would allow trial continuation. The 15mCi and 20mCi data will be used to extrapolate the next dose, if necessary.  
Adjudication will be done by [CONTACT_28749] (SMC) after every [ADDRESS_515289] and/or physicist, a RefleXion medical physician, and 
RefleXion technical staff.  Finally, even if the [ADDRESS_515290] the discretion to open Cohort II to accrual.  
4.3 Cohort II: Emulated Delivery  Cohort  
The BgRT product design is such that when used to guide treatment delivery, the hardware instructions for the linear accelerator, gantry, and MLCs are determined during each fraction based upon the dynamic input of PET LTS images on that day. Therefore, ea ch fraction of treatment delivery is expected to utilize 
different hardware instructions than the others. Nonetheless, each of these delivered variations and their 
individual dose volume histograms (DVH
Delivered ) should be reflected in the approved BgRT pl an, which 
represents the spectrum of delivery possibilities (within an allowed threshold of variation) in the bounded 
dose volume histogram (bDVH).  
RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol   
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential    985- [ADDRESS_515291] result 
in an anatomic dose distribution that is consistent with the approved BgRT plan. A secondary objective is 
to extend this analysis by [CONTACT_408463]. Importantly, this investigation comprehensively emulates and assesses 
(without actually d elivering the radiation therapy to the patient) the entire end -to-end BgRT workflow 
from simulation to treatment planning to, finally, dose delivery. This design also provides an opportunity 
to assess imaging, workflow, and the toxicity , if any,  associated  with multiple administrations of FDG.  
To do this, [ADDRESS_515292] and final fractions of their planned course of SBRT ( Figure 6). A single 
comparison third -party diagnostic PET/CT image will also be obtained (utilizing the same FDG injection) 
on the day of the final fraction.   
The two fractional timepoints are selected because they will capture any day to day PET variations as well as potential interference on the tumor PET signal arising from the radiotherapy itself. A PET collection 
prior to the start of the treatment course will not be influenced by [CONTACT_408464], whereas the 
PET collection preceding the final fraction will be subject to the full impact of SBRT  on the tumor PET 
profile.  
In order to emulate BgRT delivery, each of these fractional PET collections will consist of two phases:  
• Short -duration PET collection that corresponds to the duration of a PET PreScan  Evaluation  
• Long- duration PET collection that  corresponds to the duration of an active BgRT delivery fraction  
The long- duration PET collection data mimics RefleXion LTS  PET image acquisition  during live BgRT and 
will be used to determine the hardware instructions that would be transmitted to the Refl eXion delivery 
hardware (linear accelerator, gantry, MLC, etc.) based upon the algorithmic interaction between the incoming LTS images and the approved BgRT treatment plan.

  Primary Objective : The quality  of each specific instance of emulated BgRT dose delivery will be validated 
in two ways. Firstly, the dose distribution resulting from the hardware instructions triggered by [CONTACT_408465] t he patient’s CT anatomy. This radiotherapy dose 
distribution will be checked against the expectations of the approved BgRT plan. As such , the primary 
endpoint is the percent of  radiotherapy  fractions  where the emulated  BgRT  dose distribution  in silico is 
shown to be consistent with  the approved  BgRT  treatment plan (i.e., 95% of  DVH Delivered  points for the BTZ 
and OARs fall within the bounded DVH  of the approved  BgRT  plan).    
Secondary Objectives :  The second test of dose distribution quality is to  confirm that the machine  
instruction -set generated by [CONTACT_408466].  
To that end, the fluence resulting from the hardware instruction set will be delivered into a physical 
phantom in order to emulate delivery during BgRT. The dose and distribution measured in the phantom will be judged against in silico  delivery of the same instruction set to a digital facsimile of the phantom, as 
per standard physics quality assurance methodology.  
As such , the first secondary endpoint will be the following:  
1. Percent of fractions where there is  concordance between the physical and digital phantoms 
of emulated  BgRT  delivery derived from human subject PET emissions. Concordance is defined as a 
standard gamma index with a goal that 90% of pi[INVESTIGATOR_408426] 3mm/3% deviation standard.   
Collectively, these primary and secondary analyses emulate end -to-end BgRT delivery insofar as they 
enable visualization of anatomic dose distributions resulting from varying PET LTS conditions and confirm 
quality assurance and delivery of those dose distributions  by [CONTACT_408467]. In this way, 
these analyses address the known limitation of human subjects research in radiotherapy device validation 
(see section 1.5 ), which is that dose distributions are not directly measurable in vivo .  
These two analyses of emulated delivery are graphically characterized in Figure 7 below:  
 
Figure 7. Physical and Dosimetric Validation of BgRT Plan Delivery Based upon Human- Subject Derived 
PET Data on the RefleXion System  

RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol   
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential    985- [ADDRESS_515293] been delivered in practice. Therefore, a dose distribution is evaluable 
for the primary endpoint if, preceding the long- duration PET collection, (1) an acceptable BgRT plan was 
approved and (2) the PET PreScan  evaluation delivered a “Pass” signal. In order to obtain a total of 16 
evaluable dose distributions for assessing delivery quality in Cohort II, a minimum of 8 subjec ts (4 bone 
tumors and 4 lung tumors) and up to [ADDRESS_515294], if a PET PreScan  
delivers a “Fail” signal prior to long -duration PET collection, then the investigator can choose to repeat 
FDG administration at a subseque nt treatment fraction for that subject (which again reflects clinical 
practice). If a data point is ultimately non-evaluable, then a n additional  patient with the same anatomic 
type of tumor can be accrued. Once a total of [ADDRESS_515295] 
of care for radiotherapy tumor localization: CT -based localization. As such, whether the tumor PET signal 
is within the BTZ – which is a rigid volume defined on and registered to the patient’s CT anatomy –  will 
underpin this determination. The localization decision made by [CONTACT_408468] a panel of independent reviewers using the same RMRS PreScan  
images with the overlaid BTZ:  
2. Percent of cases wher e there is an agreement between a site investigator and the agreement standard 
for the BgRT PET PreScan localization decision (overall percent agreement). Positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement will also be reported.  
The next imaging sec ondary endpoint seeks to validate the qualitative visualization of the tumor and OARs 
on the PreScan against an established reference standard. To establish this concordance , a third -party 
diagnostic  PET/CT scan following the RMRS PET acquisitions  obtained  prior to the last fraction.  
3. Percent of cases where there is concordance of a positive localization decision between the short-duration PET PreScan and a third -party diagnostic PET/CT scan (positive percent agreement). Overall 
percent agreement and negati ve percent agreement will also be reported.  
Details of these two imaging analyses are described in section 6.3.8 and 6.3.9. Of note, these endpoints 
will not be limited to only those cases that are evaluable for the  primary endpoint. Nonetheless, 
interpretation of the results of this analysis should bear in mind that the clinically meaningful localization decisions are the positive ones because they would prompt BgRT external beam delivery; negative 
localization decisions at the RMRS PET PreScan would result in aborting BgRT delivery  in clinical practice .  
A fourth secondary endpoint is to measure toxicity arising from multiple administrations of FDG. As 
described in detail in the IB, the theoretical risk is minimal g iven first principles of radiation exposure and 
reassuring animal and human studies of very high -dose FDG administrations. This secondary endpoint will 
seek to further confirm safety by [CONTACT_408469]:

[CONTACT_393061], urinalysis and AEs specific to bladder and bone marrow determined  by 
[CONTACT_10653] (CTCAE) v5 at 72 ±24 hours after final FDG injection.  
 
Finally, characterization  of the different steps in the workflow and the robustness of the PET Evaluation 
pre-delivery will be assessed to better characterize RefleXion system functioning. This data will be 
collected for all enrolled subjects regardless of the evaluability of their BgRT dose distributions: 
5. Workflow characterization:  
a. Percent of PET imaging sessions at RRFD that meet BTZ activation concentration threshold for 
BgRT (5 kBq/ml)  
b. Percent of PE T imaging sessions that lead to acceptable BgRT plans, with acceptability based upon 
meeting user -defined coverage goals for tumor targets and avoidance goals for OARs  
c. Percent of approved BgRT plans that go on to pass physics quality assurance as defined b y 90% of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_408426] 3mm/3% deviation standard.  
d. Percent of PET PreScan Evaluations on the day of fraction delivery that elicit a “Pass” signal.  
For each of these conversion assessments, the constituent metrics underling the outcomes will be recorded. For example, the underlying measurements for the PET PreScan  Evaluation (i.e., Activity 
Concentration , NTS level, predicted DVH, predicted 3D dose distribution, and calculated agreement 
between the predicted DVH and bounded DVH) will be recorded for each assessment.  
Additional exploratory analysis for Cohort II may include pairwise dosimetric comparison of the BgRT and SBRT plans for each lesion. When additional time -paired third -party images are available, they may be 
compared to RMRS PET  images and a qualitative assessment may be performed.

6.2 Cohort I: RRFD Cohort  
6.2.1 Baseline Visit  
The following baseline data should be collected within two weeks  prior to the Imaging -only PET session 
for all subjects enrolled in Cohort I and documented in the case report form (CRF):  
• Confirmation that all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are met.  
• Demographics , medical history  and physical exam  
• Complete Blood Count (CBC)  
• Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)  
• ECOG performance status  
• Blood glucose  
• Urinalysis  
• Pregnancy test (required for women of child -bearing potential only; within 14 days prior to the 
initiation of study scans .)   
For patients unde rgoing systemic therapy at the time of enrollment, decisions regarding whether to 
continue the systemic therapy or undergo a wash -out will be made by [CONTACT_408476].  
Additionally, a Sim CT should be obtained within two week s prior to the PET Imaging -only session if not 
already planned to be obtained as standard of care.  Any additional institutional guidelines must be 
followed regarding negative pregnancy testing in patients about to undergo radiation therapy.  
 
  
RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol  
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential   985-[ADDRESS_515301] a Sim (4D)CT 
within two week s prior to the PET Imaging -only session and are not planned to undergo a Sim -CT for SBRT 
(e.g. follow -up patients), a Sim (4D)CT obtained as a part of the study protocol within two  week s prior to 
the PET Imaging -only session will be utilized. The images from the Sim -CT will be used to outline structures 
necessary for treatment planning including target volumes, organs -at-risk, and the biology -tracking zone.  
Once the structures have been delineated and imported into the RefleXion treatment planning system, a 
BgRT plan is initiated , and the  patient can return to the  site to undergo passive PET collection on the RMRS 
system (the PET Imaging -only session) . The patient will undergo FDG injection in accordance with standard 
diagnostic PET/CT protocols. Prior to FDG injection, patients should be fasting for 4 -6 hours. A blood 
glucose measurement will be obtained prior to FDG injection to confirm a level less than or equal to 200 
mg/dL. Patients will be rescheduled should the blood glucose value exceed this threshold. After injection 
the patients should be resting in the uptake area for 60 minutes (±15min).   
After the uptake period, patient set-up will include  positioning patients on the RefleXion system couch in 
the treatment position, followed by [CONTACT_408477] (if necessary) and rough alignment  using lasers and 
tattoos. A localization kVCT  scan will be performed for refining anatomical alignment in the regio n of 
interest and to localize the treatment target area. Sim CT images will be registered with the kVCT to propagate contoured volumes . Specifically, t he BTZ will be overlaid digitally on the kVCT images once 
positioning is completed. A RMRS PET Imaging- only session will then be performed over the [ADDRESS_515302] -party 
PET/CT in the same treatment position. A second dose of FDG will not be administered for the scan 
immediately following the RMRS  PET Imaging -only session. Sites will make every effort to minimize the 
time between two scans. To ensure adequate FDG activity, third -party PET scan will be initiated within 
[ADDRESS_515303] -party PET/CT scans will be documented on 
the appropriate CRF and will include the time of FDG injection, start and end times for RMRS PET  and 
third -party diagnostic PET/CT scans. Sites will be provided with instructions for how i mages should be 
collected and submitted to RefleXion Medical within five days of the PET Imaging- only session. AEs will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_408439] (CTCAE) v5 at 72 ±24 hours after the 
end of PET Imaging- only session.  
After the Imaging -only PET dataset is transmitted  to the RefleXion treatment planning workstation, BgRT 
treatment planning can be completed with dose calculation and optimization employing the BgRT 
RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol   
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential    985- [ZIP_CODE] v5.0 
  33 of 67
  algorithm as described in the BgRT User Manual. Scoring o f a successful BgRT plan requires positive 
localization at the RMRS device during the PET Imaging -only session; reaching the necessary quantitative 
thresholds (i .e. Activity Concentration and NTS); and meeting coverage goals for target and avoidance 
goals for OARs. In Cohort I, physician intent, which includes radiotherapy dose and coverage goals, should 
match institutional practice for ablative radiation for the tum or type and anatomic region being targeted. 
Dose constraints are recommended to follow NRG Oncology  guidelines . As in conventional radiotherapy 
planning, dose , fractionation , and volume  modifications are allowed  if such changes are in accordance 
with insti tutional practic e for the clinical scenario . Similarly, changes to the BTZ volume are allowed at the 
time of planning. However, the original BTZ must be utilized for the primary endpoint and secondary imaging endpoints described in section 6.2.3 and 6.2.4 since those endpoints precede treatment planning. 
The BgRT plan is considered to be successfully completed when approved by [CONTACT_408478].  
The BgRT physics quality assurance process verifies that the treatment planning system calculat ed dose 
in a phantom is equal to the measured dose in the phantom.  Once the BgRT plan is ready (optimization and dose calculation are  completed and the plan quality meets desired treatment objectives) a 
Verification Plan is generated in the treatment plan ning system as described in the BgRT User Manual.  As 
is common practice, this QA plan is generated by [CONTACT_408479] a forward dose calculation onto the CT image of an  ArcCHECK  phantom. The QA 
plan is then delivered to the ArcCHECK phantom.  Upon completion of the dose delivery, the accuracy of 
the plan delivery can be assessed by [CONTACT_408480].

6.2.3 Schema for Cohort I Secondary Endpoint #1: RMRS Image Inter -Observer Agreement  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The first read will occur at the clinical study site and will be the localization decision by a site 
Investigator  as part of the planned clinical workflow . This comparison will check the decision 
that is made  after investigator review of  the RMRS PET image against an agreement standard .

[IP_ADDRESS].1  The site investigator (radiation oncologist) will be presented with the RMRS PET 
image obtained at the PET Imaging -only session. The contours of the sim  CT-
defined biology -tracking zone (BTZ) will be presented on the RMRS PET image , 
which was acquired afte r anatomic registration of the sim  CT with the RMRS 
localization kVCT . The site investigator will make a localization decision in 
accordance with the BgRT workflow.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  The localization decision will be “Yes” if (a) the PET tumor signal is fully within the 
BTZ and (b) OAR and non -target PET signal(s) are outside the BTZ. Each of these 
two criteria will be recorded for each case. If either criterion is not met, then the localization decision will be “No”. The site investigator localization decision will 
be logged for comparison to an agreement standard.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The second read will be to create the determination of an Agreement Standard to match 
against the localization decision of a site Investigator. This will be conducted offline at an 
independent center and will be done by a panel of readers.   
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Three radiatio n oncologists will be  selected. All the readers will be trained using 
identical training data set and image review  software programs as detailed in the 
image review charter (IRC). Readers will be blinded to reader evaluations, patient diagnosis and other c linical data.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  The RMRS PET will be transferred to a workstation for image viewing and image registration. Readers will be presented with the RMRS PET image obtained at the 
Imaging -only session. The contours of the biology -tracking zone (BTZ) 
radiotherapy structure will be presented throughout the reading process using 
the same registration process as [IP_ADDRESS].  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Each reader makes a localization decision as “Yes” if (a) the PET tumor signal is 
fully within the Biology Tracking Zone (BTZ) and (b) Organ -at-risk (OAR) and non -
target PET signal(s) are outside the BTZ. Each of these two criteria will be 
recorded. If either criterion is not met, then the localization decision will be “No”.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_515306] reader is required.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_515307].   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Inter -observer agreement between the site investigator (SI) and the agreement standard 
(AS) will be calculated as follows:

1. If both SI and AS localization decisions are “yes” then the rating should be “A”  
2. If SI decides “yes” for localization but AS decides “no” then the rating should be “B”.  
3. If SI decides “no” for localization but AS decides “yes” then the rating should be “C”.  
4. If both SI and AS localizations decisions are “no” then the rating should be “D”.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Based on the rating performed in above section  for inter- observer agreement, an overall, 
positive and negative % agreement will be calculated.   
Percent overall agreement = (A+D)/(A+B+C+D) {main analysis}  
Percent positive agreement = A/(A+C)  
Percent negative agreement = D/(D+B)  
 
6.2.4 Schema for Cohort I Secondary Endpoint #2 -  RMRS PET vs Diagnostic PET /CT Comparison:   
[IP_ADDRESS]  The comparison of the PET image from the RMRS  imaging- only session  and the third- party 
diagnostic PET /CT will be conducted and descriptive statistics including positive and negative 
percent agreement will be provided as outlined below.  
The positive percent agreement analysis seeks confirmation of RMRS findings in clinically 
relevant cases based on an affirmative scoring of two questions which correspond to the plan 
proceed decision . For the two questions, FDG -avid targets or organs are defined qualitatively as 
discrete structures with visually discernable FDG- PET signal above immediate background.  The 
two questions are:  
• Q1 (target avidity): Is there an FDG- avid targe t that correlates to the tumor location on 
the registered CT image?  
• Q2 (confounding non -target signal): Are FDG- avid organs an adequate distance away (≥1 
cm) from the FDG- avid tumor for biology -guided radiotherapy?   
It should be noted that cases that do no t meet these criteria on the RMRS PET  imaging -only 
session do not create a radiotherapy health risk, since the result is that the physician will not 
choose to use BgRT as the treatment modality . Nonetheless , the overall percent agreement and 
negative perce nt agreement will also be reported  to allow for comprehensive imaging 
comparison  with the third -party, diagnostic PET/CT .  
Although c alculation of the agreement endpoint will be based on the qualitative questions 
above (Q1 and Q2), data on target avidity and non -confounding target signal in relationship to 
the CT- defined, overlaid biological tracking zone (BTZ) will also be collected:  
RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol  
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential   985-[ZIP_CODE] v5.0 
  37 of 67
  • Q3: Does the FDG -avid target fall within the BTZ?  
• Q4: Do all FDG- avid OARs fall outside the BTZ?  
[IP_ADDRESS]  As described previ ously , after each PET Imaging -only session on the RMRS PET , the patient 
undergoes sequential PET imaging on a cleared, 3rd party diagnostic PET/CT system.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The RMRS PET , localization kVCT , Sim CT & third -party diagnostic  PET/CT images will be 
transferred to a workstation after the completion of imaging sessions for offline image 
viewing. These images will be reviewed by [CONTACT_408481] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RMRS PET  review:  Three radiation oncologists will assess the RMRS PET images 
independently. All the readers will be trained using an identical training data set and image review software programs as detailed in the image review charter (IRC). Readers will be blinded to patient diagnosis, re ader evaluations, images from the compared device  (i.e. 
third -party diagnostic  PET/CT), but not to the localization kVCT obtained on  the RMRS device 
on the same day, Sim  CT and other clinical data.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Each reader answers the same set of questions for rating whether the patient is suitable for BgRT planning. A positive plan proceed decision requires a “yes” to 
both Question 1 and Question 2 above. A negative decision is any other 
combination of answers to the two questions.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_515308]. A case rating will also be collected based upon agreement of two or of the three read results.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Third- party D iagnostic PET/CT review: Three radiologists and/or nuclear medicine 
physicians with significant PET/CT experience will assess the third -party diagnostic  PET/CT 
images independently. All the readers will be trained using an identical training data set and image review software programs as detailed in the image review charter (IRC). Readers will 
be blinded to patient dia gnosis, reader evaluations, images from the compared device  (i.e. 
RMRS PET  and RMRS  kVCT  for localization ) but not Sim  CT and other clinical data.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Each reader answers the same set of questions for rating whether the patient is 
suitable for BgRT planning. A positive decision requires a “yes” to both Question 
1 and Question 2 above. A negative decision is any other combination of answers 
to the two questions.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Two or more agreeing out of the three read results will be selected as the case 
rating. Individual read results will also be provided.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Based on the decisions performed in the above sections, the following table will be constructed for each RMRS PET reader individually and for the case rating collectively.  Tables 
will be used to provide descriptive statistics for agreement as described below

6.3 Cohort II: Emulated Delivery  Cohort  
The primary objective of this cohort is to  determine whether BgRT dose distributions generated from 
Limited Time Sample (L TS) PET images obtained at the time of treatment delivery are consistent with the 
approved BgRT plan.  To achieve this objective, RMRS PET  scans will be added to the SBRT workflow at 
timepoints representing  some of the  instances when the RMRS  PET subsystem would be utilized during a  
BgRT workflow. Specifically, subjects will undergo RMRS PET collections at the time of planning, and then 
before the first and final fractions of their planned course of SBRT treatment  (Figure 8 ).

• Baseline assessment of bladder and bone marrow with CTCAE grading  
• Pregnancy test (required for women of child -bearing potential only, if applicable within 14 days  
prior to the initiation of the study scans .) 
For patients undergoing systemic therapy at the time of enrollment, decisions regarding whether to 
continue the sy stemic therapy or undergo a wash -out will be made by [CONTACT_408476].  
Additionally, a Sim CT should be obtained within two week s prior to the PET Imaging -only session  if no t 
already planned to be obtained as standard of care.  Any additional institutional guidelines must be 
followed regarding negative pregnancy testing in patients about to undergo radiation therapy.  
6.3.[ADDRESS_515309] been deemed an SBRT candidate by [CONTACT_408482]. 
Physician intent including selection of radiation prescription and t reatment planning for SBRT will be done 
as per institutional practice. To create a parallel Bg RT plan, p atients will also  undergo a n RMRS  PET 
Imaging -only session as described in Section 6.3.4; t his entails a  visit that includes a single FDG injection 
of RRFD ; setting up the patient on the RMRS couch; undergoing one kVCT scan to ensure alignment with 
the patient’s Sim  CT; and then a passive collection of the PET emissions by [CONTACT_408483] . The final step of the 
planning process is physics quality a ssurance of the SBRT and BgRT plans , respectively . This sequence is 
detailed below.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Radiation Therapy Guidelines  
Radiotherapy  will be performed according to best practices. Machine -level quality assurance should 
be performed per its guidelines for any linear accelerator system used in the conduct of this clinical trial. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), when utilized, must be performed on a cleared, 
commercial linear accelerator system.  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Radiation Prescription: Dose and Fractionation  
Radiotherapy do se planned in Cohort II will be in the range delineated below. A minimum of 24 hours is 
required between fractions and 40 hours is recommended.  
Fractions  Recommended Dose  
3 Fractions  15-45 Gy 
5 Fractions  25-50 Gy  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CT Simulation  
RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol   
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential    985- [ADDRESS_515310] include capture of a four -dimensional (4D) image set 
across a full respi[INVESTIGATOR_408428] (MIP) image sets. The use of IV contrast is encouraged when medically feasible and applicable per the investigating physician.   
For bony sites, immobilization should use  a cradle at the site of the lesion. The use of (4D)CT and contrast 
(IV or oral) contrast are encouraged when medically feasible and deemed applicable by [CONTACT_269747]. For example, (4D)CT may be desired in the setting of a rib lesion; oral contrast may be desirable 
for bowel delineation in the setting of treatment for a pelvic osseous lesion.   
The slice thickness for the simulation CT scan used for treatment planning should follow the site’s standard clinical practice for SBRT to the specific treatment location.  Uniform CT slice thicknes s must be used.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Target Delineation  and Treatment Planning  
The treatment volume will generally consist of the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) expanded per the treating 
physician by 3 -10 mm to generate a Planning Target Volume (PTV).  
For lung tumors in the context of BgRT planning, the GTV and PTV contouring should be performed on a 
single phase of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. The GTV is contoured on this single phase and then expanded by [ADDRESS_515311] summed to generate 
an Internal GTV  (IGTV ) and then expanded by [ADDRESS_515312], for SBRT planning, 
GTV contours from all phases of respi[INVESTIGATOR_408429] b y 
3-10 mm  to generate the final prescription volume, called the internal planning treatment volume (IPTV).  
For bone tumors in the context of BgRT planning, the GTV and PTV contouring should be performed on a 
static image set or a single phase of respi[INVESTIGATOR_408430] a (4D)CT set is obtained. Again, a 5 mm expansion of the 
GTV will be used for the PTV. The BTZ will be a 8  to 20 mm expansion of the static GTV or IGTV if (4D)CT 
is used. For SBRT planning, either a static GTV contour or an IGTV, if applicable, will be expanded by 3 -10 
mm to generate the final prescription volume, called the internal planning treatment volume (IPTV).  
SBRT dose calculation and optimization will be done as per institutional practice using validated  treatment 
planning software . The SBRT plan must also be evaluated  with a robust quality assurance protocol as per 
institutional practice with necessary procedures performed and verified by [CONTACT_408478].  Likewise, BgRT dose calculation and quality assurance are  performed as described in section 
6.2.2  with one clarification : In order to be consistent with normal BgRT workflow, if the BTZ is modified 
during treatment planning then the modified BTZ should be used for t imepoints that occur after treatment 
planning (i.e., time points described in 6.3.5, 6.3.6, and 6.3.7)  . 
RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol   
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential    985- [ZIP_CODE] v5.0

  The coverage goal for both BgRT and SBRT plans is for 95% of the prescription volume (PTV or IPTV) to 
receive 95% of the prescription dose. D ose modifications  can be employed in either the SBRT or BgRT plan 
if necessary to meet OAR constraints provided that  the resulting dose remains in accordance  with  
institutional practice . Quality assessment of the treatment plan, both with anatomically correlated 
isodose lines and with DVH  (SBRT) or bDVH  (BgRT) , is mandatory.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  OAR Dose Constraints  
Dose constraints should adhere to NRG guidelines for 3 and 5 fraction SBRT as described in NRG BR002.  
Planning should avoid hot spots (defined as 105% of the prescription dose) in adjacent OARs. These are 
hard constraints, and dose de -escalation is required whenever necessary to meet these constraints. For 
non-adjacent OARs, prudent planning based on the principle of ALARA should be observed.  
6.3.3 Image Guidance Requirement  
At each imaging session or prior to any PET collection on the RMRS PET , the patient’s initial positioning 
based upon external markers must be confirmed and adjusted with the use of the on -board fan -beam 
kVCT capability of the RMRS PET . 
6.3.[ADDRESS_515313] diagnostic PET/CT protocols. Prior to FDG injection, patients should be fasting 
for 4 -6 hours. A blood glucose measurement will be o btained prior to FDG injection to confirm a level less 
than or equal to 200 mg/dL. Patients will be rescheduled should the blood glucose value exceed this 
threshold. After injection the patients should be resting in the uptake area for 60 minutes (±15min).    
After the uptake period, patient set- up will include positioning patients on the RefleXion system couch in 
the treatment position, followed by [CONTACT_408477]  (if necessary) and rough alignment  using lasers and 
tattoos . A localization kVCT  scan will be p erformed for refining anatomical alignment in the region of 
interest and to localize the treatment target. Sim CT images will be registered with the kVCT to propagate 
contoured volumes. Specifically, the BTZ will be overlaid digitally on the kVCT images on ce positioning is 
completed. A RMRS PET imaging session will then be performed over the [ADDRESS_515314] 
then be approved by [CONTACT_408484] .  
Data collected during the RMRS PET  imaging -only session will be documented on the appropriate CRF and 
will include the time of FDG injection and start and end times for RMRS PET  scans. Sites will be provided 
with instructions for how images and image data (e.g. contours) should be collected and submitted to 
RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol   
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential    985- [ADDRESS_515315] Fraction of SBRT: Short -Duration PET PreScan  and Long- Duration PET Collection  
Subjects enrolled in Cohort II will undergo conventional SBRT treatment on a commercial linear 
accelerator system. The investigation seeks to emulate BgRT patient set- up and treatment delivery as this 
course of SBRT is ongoing. The study procedure requires that an approved BgRT plan was generated previously for the relevant lesion.   
Passive collection of PET emission data will be performed prior the first SBRT fraction. On the day of PET data collection, the patient will undergo FDG injection at the RRFD dose in accordance with standard 
diagnostic PET/CT protocols. Prior to FDG inje ction, patients should be fasting for 4 -6 hours. A blood 
glucose measurement will be obtained prior to FDG injection to confirm a level less than or equal to 200 
mg/dL (note: patients can be rescheduled to undergo their PET data collection at the next frac tion should 
the blood glucose value exceed this threshold). After FDG is injected, the patients should be resting in the uptake area for 60 minutes (±15min).   
After the uptake period, patient set- up will include positioning patients on the RefleXion syste m couch in 
the treatment position, followed by [CONTACT_408477]  (if necessary) and rough alignment  using lasers and 
tattoos . A localization kVCT  scan will be performed for refining anatomical alignment in the region of 
interest and to localize the treatment target.  Sim CT images will be  registe red with the kVCT to propagate 
contoured volumes . Specifically,  the BTZ will be overlaid digitally on the kVCT images once positioning is 
completed.  
In the BgRT delivery workflow, a short -duration PET PreScan  is first conducted prior to BgRT delivery to 
confirm consistency (within tolerance thresholds) of the PET emission profile when compared to the 
original PET imaging -session used for planning. For study purposes  in Cohort II, a short -duration PET 
PreScan  will be obtained to emulate this workflow step. The scan will be acquired over the axial extent of 
the planned treatment region over approximately 3 -5 minutes depending on BTZ size. The quantitative  
measures that would guide the  PET PreScan  Evaluation to be considered a  “pass” or “fail” signal as 
described in section 1.[ADDRESS_515316] SBRT fraction; ideally 
this would be done on the same day as the SBRT fraction. Data collected befo re the first fraction of SBRT 
will be documented on the appropriate CRF and will include the time of FDG injection as well as start and 
end times for RMRS PET  scans , and the results of the quantitative calculations based on the short duration 
PET scan .  
6.3.6 Final Fraction of SBRT: Short -Duration PET PreScan , Long -Duration PET Collection and third -
party D iagnostic  PET 
RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol  
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential   985-[ADDRESS_515317] SBRT fraction (section 6.3.5) , with the addition of an scan on a third 
party Diagnostic PET/CT system . As such, steps will include  setting up the patient on the RMRS couch; 
undergoing kVCT scan(s) to ensure alignment with the patient’s Sim CT ; and then a passive collection o f 
the PET emissions by [CONTACT_408483].  
Following  the short -duration PET PreScan and long- duration PET collection, subjects will be imaged again 
with a third -party PET/CT in the same treatment position. A second dose of FDG will not be administered 
for the scan following the RMRS  PET session. Sites will make every effort to minimize the time between 
two scans. To ensure adequate FDG activity, third -party diagnostic  PET/CT scan should be initiated within 
[ADDRESS_515318] -party diagnostic PET/CT scans , and the results of the quantitative calculations based on the short 
duration PET scan . Sites will be provided with instructions for how images should be collected and 
submitted to RefleXion Medical within five  days of the RMRS  PET and third -party diagnostic  PET/CT scans.   
Additionally, the safety of multiple FDG administrations and toxici ty rates of bladder and bone marrow 
will be assessed . Complete blood count , urinalysis  and AEs specific to bladder and bone marrow 
determined  by [CONTACT_10653] (CTCAE) v5 will be collected at 72 ±24 
hours after the final FDG injection . 
6.3.7 Emulated Delivery and Analysis of collected PET Data 
Several of the endpoints require in silico  and phantom  analysis of the collected RMRS PET informatio n and 
resulting BgRT external beam dose distribution that is generated by [CONTACT_408485] . The sponsor will 
set up a workstation at the clinical site and provide validated tools, training and procedures that will allow 
the site staff (most likely the site medical physicist) to perform the required analyses. Depending on the 
complexity, t he sponsor may contract with an independent expert to conduct the analyses at a central 
location. In addition, the collected images and detailed  machine log files  will be provided to the sponsor 
for off- line analysis  after de -identification .  Sites will be provided with instructions for how images should 
be collected and submitted to RefleXion Medical within five  days of the last fraction of SBRT.  
For the in-silico dose distribution analysis, a long -duration PET scan is obtained on the day of a 
radiotherapy treatment. Th is PET scan is subdivided by [CONTACT_408486]. 
The beam station location and number of rotations required for sampli ng these LTS images are 
determined by [CONTACT_408487]. Next, the LTS image set is inputted into the delivery algorithm to calculate the machine instructions for external beam delivery. The machine instructions are used to model 
delivery of their associated fluences  in silico to emulate dose  distribution  in the patient’s CT anatomy in 
the treatment position.  This emulated dose distribution is then checked to ensure that it is concordant 
RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol   
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential    985- [ZIP_CODE] v5.0 
  44 of 67
  with the originally approved BgRT plan, which is established by d emonstrating that 95% of the DVH Delivered  
points for the BTZ and surrounding OARs fall within the BgRT plan’s bounded DVH (see cohort II primary 
endpoint). A 3D visualization of the emulated dose distribution on the patient’s CT anatomy will also be 
genera ted.  
For physical validation,  the emulated fluence (dose) from the primary endpoint analysis  is utilized.  
RefleXion offline tools will convert the machine instructions into a deterministic radiotherapy (RT) plan.  
Deliverability of the plan is confirmed by  [CONTACT_408488], measured in a physical 
phantom, to a  model of plan  delivery in a digital representation (CT image) of the same phantom. A 
standard gamma index will be utilized for this confirmation with a goal that 90% of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_408426] 
3mm/3% deviation standard (see cohort II secondary endpoint 1). The Arc CHECK platform will be utilized 
to perform this assessment.

6.3.8 Schema for Cohort II Secondary Endpoint #2: RMRS PreScan  Image Inter -Observer 
Localization Agreement  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The first read will occur at the clinical study site and will be the localization decision by a site 
Investigator. This comparison will check the decision that is being made by [CONTACT_408489] t standard . 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  The site investigator  (radiation oncologist ) will be presented with the RMRS PET 
PreScan  images. The contours of the sim  CT-defined biology -tracking zone (BTZ) 
will be presented on the RMRS PET image, which was acquired  after anatomic 
registrat ion of the sim  CT with the RMRS localization kVCT . The site investigator 
will make a localization decision in accordance with the BgRT workflow.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  The localization decision will be “Yes” if (a) the PET tumor signal is fully within the 
BTZ, and (b) OAR and n on-target PET signal(s) are outside the BTZ. Each of these 
two criteria will be recorded for each case. If either criterion is not met, then the 
localization decision will be “No”. The site investigator localization decision will 
be logged for comparison t o an agreement standard.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The second read will be to create the determination of an Agreement Standard to match against the localization decision of a site Investigator. This will be conducted at an 
independent center and will be done by a panel of readers.   
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Three radiation oncologists  will be  selected. All the readers will be trained using 
identical training data set and image reviewed software programs as detailed in 
the image review charter (IRC). Readers will be blinded to reader evaluations, 
patient dia gnosis and other clinical data.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  The RMRS PET will be transferred to a workstation for image viewing and image 
registration. Readers will be presented with the RMRS PET PreScan  images. The 
contours of the biology -tracking zone (BTZ) radiotherapy structure will be 
presented throughout the reading process using the same registration process as 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Each reader makes a localization decision as “Yes” if (a) the PET tumor signal is 
fully within the BTZ, and (b) OAR and non -target PET signal(s) are outside  the BTZ. 
Each of these two criteria will be recorded for each case. If either criterion is not 
met, then the localization decision will be “No”. The site investigator localization 
decision will be logged for comparison to an agreement standard.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_515322] reader is required.

  [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_515323].   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Inter -observer agreement between the site investigator (SI) and the agreement standard 
(AS) will be calculated as follows:  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  If both SI and AS localization decisions are “yes ” then the rating should be “A”  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  If SI decides “yes” for localization but AS decides “no” then the rating should be 
“B”.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  If SI decides “no” for localization but AS decides “yes” then the rating should be 
“C”. 
[IP_ADDRESS].4  If both SI and AS localizations decisions are “ no” then the rating should be “D”.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Based on the rating performed in above section for inter- observer agreement, an overall, 
positive and negative % agreement will be calculated.   
Percent overall agreement = (A+D)/(A+B+C+D) {main analysis}  
Percent positive agreement = A/(A+C)  
Percent negative agreement = D/(D+B)  
 
6.3.9 Schema for Cohort II Secondary Endpoint #3: RMRS Short -Duration PreScan  PET vs. 
Diagnostic PET Concordance Agreement  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The comparison of the PET PreScan image after short -duration acquisition  and the third -
party diagnostic PET/CT image will be conducted and descriptive statistics including positive and negative percent agreement will be provided as outlined below.  
The positive percent agreement analysis seeks confirmation of RMRS findings in clinically 
relevant cases based on an affirmative scoring of two questions which qualitatively correspond 
to a positive localization decision, which is necessary in conjunction with passing quantitative 
criteria for a PreScan “Pass” signal.  For the two que stions, FDG -avid targets or organs are 
defined qualitatively as discrete structures with visually discernable FDG- PET signal above 
immediate background.  The two questions are:  
• Q1 (target avidity): Is there an FDG- avid target that correlates to the tumor lo cation on 
the registered CT image?  
• Q2 (confounding non -target signal): Are FDG- avid organs an adequate distance away (≥1 
cm) from the FDG- avid tumor for biology -guided radiotherapy?   
RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol  
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential   985-[ADDRESS_515324] -party, diagnostic PET/CT . 
Although c alculation of the agreement endpoint will be based on the qualitative questions 
above (Q1 and Q2), data on target avidity and non -confounding target signal in relationship to 
the CT- defined, overlaid biological tracking zone (BTZ) will also be collected:  
• Q3: Does the FDG -avid target fall within the BTZ?  
• Q4: Do all FDG- avid OARs fall outside the BTZ?  
[IP_ADDRESS]  As de scribed previously, after the  last-fraction RMRS  scans which include  the PET PreScan, 
the patient undergoes third- party diagnostic PET/CT imaging.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The RMRS short -duration PET image, localization kVCT,  Sim CT, and third -party diagnostic 
PET/CT  images will be transferred to a workstation for image viewing. These images will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_408481] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RMRS Short -Duration PET review:  Three radiation oncologists will assess the RMRS PET  
images independently. All the readers will be trained using an identical training data set and 
image review software programs as detailed in the image review charter (IRC). Readers will 
be blinded to patient diagnosis, reader evaluations, images from the compared device  (i.e. 
third -party diagnostic PET/CT ), but not to the localization kVCT obtained on the RMRS device 
on the same day , Sim CT, and other clinical data.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Each reader answers the same set of questions for rating whether the patient is 
suitable for BgRT planning. A positive localization  decision requires a “yes” to 
both Question 1 a nd Question 2 above. A negative decision is any other 
combination of answers to the two questions.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_515325]. A case rating will also be collected based upon agreement of two or of the three read re sults. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Third- party D iagnostic PET/CT review: Three radiologists and/or nuclear medicine 
physicians with significant PET/CT experience will assess the  third -party diagnostic  PET/CT 
images independently. All the readers will be trained using an identical training data set and 
image review software programs as detailed in the image review charter (IRC). Readers will 
be blinded to patient diagnosis, reader evaluations, images from the compared device  (i.e. 
RMRS short -duration PET  and localization kVCT ) but not Sim  CT, and other clinical data.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Each reader answers the same set of questions for rating whether the patient is 
suitable for BgRT planning. A positive localization decision requires a “yes” to

  both Question 1 and Question 2 above. A negative decision is any other 
combination of answers to the two questions.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Two or more agreeing out of the three read results will be selected as the case 
rating. Individual read results will also be provided.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Based on the decisions performed in the above sections, the following table will be 
constructed for each RMRS PET reader individually and for the case rating collectively.  Tables will be used to provide descriptive statistics for agreement as described be low:

Percent overall agreement = (A+D)/(A+B+C+D)  
 
7. DATA MANAGEMENT 
7.[ADDRESS_515326] data will be collected in a secure electronic data capture (EDC) system via the Internet. All pertinent data will be entered by [CONTACT_408490] (eCRFs).  A unique subject ID number will be assigned to each subject.  Every reasonable effort should be made to 
complete data entry within five days  of data collection. Any data discrepancies may be queried during 
ongoing review of data by [CONTACT_408491], or  may be identified and queried 
during routine monitoring visits.  Data monitoring will be performed to verify data accuracy and ensure queries are resolved. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -investigator must ensure the accuracy and 
completeness of the rec orded data and then provide his/her electronic signature [CONTACT_408513]. 
Changes to data previously submitted to the sponsor will require a new electronic signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_408492]/approve the changes.  
Results from independent r eviewer s will also be entered into the EDC system and will be electronically 
signed by [CONTACT_408493]. Ongoing data review will be performed to 
RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol   
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential    985- [ZIP_CODE] v5.0

  identify possible data discrepancies. Manual and/or automatic queries will be c reated in the EDC system 
and will be issued to responsible parties for appropriate resolution.  
 
8. MONITORING PROCEDURES  
8.1 Monitoring  
Monitoring visits to the clinical sites will be made periodically during the study, to ensure that all aspects 
of the current, approved protocol/amendment(s) are followed. Original source documents will be 
reviewed for verification of data in the electronic database. The Investigator/institution guarantees direct 
access to original source documents by [CONTACT_408494], its designees, and appropriate 
regulatory authorities. In the event that the original medical records cannot be obtained for a subject that 
is seen by a non -study physician at a non -study institution, photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_408431].  
It is important that the Investigator and/or relevant study site personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. In order to perform her or his role 
well, the monitor must be given access to primary subject medical records, which support the data that 
has been entered into the study CRFs. Access to Protected Health Information (PHI) by [CONTACT_408495].  
8.[ADDRESS_515327] be maintained at the study site. Investigational features of the RMRS 
system (BgRT mode) will be available after all essential documents are collect ed, the Site Initiation Visit 
and training of all required study personnel is completed, and the site is approved to enroll. In some 
circumstances, at the discretion of the Clinical Project Manager, the investigational device availability may precede the S ite Initiation Visit, if a site is anticipated to complete all requirements to be eligible to begin 
enrollment during the visit.  
 
Study personnel authorized to operate BgRT mode will be identified on the Delegation of Authority Log. 
The operator will be instructed and trained to utilize BgRT mode only for study subjects. Operator training 
and understanding of study requirements will be documented in the electronic Trial Master File (eTMF) 
per Study Master File Index (SMFI). The system software will ensure via login credentials that BgRT mode 
is only accessible to delegated study personnel. Additionally, the BgRT mode will display an investigational

9.1.1 Relationship of Adverse Event to the Study Device and/or Procedure s 
The investigator must assess the relati onship of the adverse event to the study device using the following 
criteria:  
Unrelated : the adverse event is determined to be due to a concurrent illness or effect of another 
device/drug and is not related to the investigational device.  
Possible : the adverse  event  is determined  to be potentially  related  to the investigational product, and an 
alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the  potential  relationship to investigational  
product.

from sporadic hypersen sitivity reactions
17. Even at multiple administrations,  FDG is not  expected to result 
in meaningful toxicity due to radioactivity exposure as each injection results in a total whole body dose of 
20 mSV (2000 mrem) or less18,19. Therefore, exposur e from multiple administrations  in the BgRT workflow  
is comparable to the annual federal limit for radiation worke rs (50 mSv; 5000 mrem) and is significantly 
below that experienced by [CONTACT_408498] -iodine therapy for thyroid disease (200 mSv; 20,000

  mrem). In fact, the radiation exposure of the multiple FDG injections is considerably less than the 
incident al exposures experienced by [CONTACT_408499] ; for instance, cumulative radiation exposure originating from both daily image -guidance using 
cone beam computed tomography and from scatter dose during high -energy beam delivery meaningfully 
exceed the radiation exposure that can result from multiple FDG administrations. These observations are 
summarized in the following table:  
Table 3: Comparison of effective dose from multiple FDG administrations and  other  incidental radiation 
exposures from currently used procedures in conventional radiotherapy

Scatter Dose from [ADDRESS_515341] at risk from FDG exposure, the bladder, 
receives approximately 6 -12 cGy from each FDG injection (36 -72 cGy in the case of 6 injections). This 
exposure is an order of magnitude below the incidental radiation that the bladder receives from  a course 
of conventional prostate radiation, which can range from approximately [ADDRESS_515342]

their study, three patients were given progressively higher doses of FDG (100 mCi/m2, 150 mCi/m2, and 
200 mCi/m2) with a single injection. With a median follow -up of [ADDRESS_515343]

tumor response during treatment; although toxicity was not a formal endpoint in these imaging studies, nonetheless no unexpected advers e events attributable to multiple administrations of  the tracer were 
reported
21,22. Moadel et al. determined that the dose-limiting organ in human patients treated with high -
dose FDG would be the red marrow using the Medical Internal Radionuclide Dosimetry Formalism, and 
further determined that the tolerance dose that would result in 5% risk of red marrow suppression at 5 
years (TD 5/5) was 4760 mCi23,24. In addition to these human investigations, a number of animal studies 
of very high FDG doses (up to 6 mCi per 20 g mouse) have, to date, not resulted in any observable

and bone marrow. These adverse events may include anemia, thrombocytopenia, bleeding, lymphopenia, 
neutropenia, hematuria, bladder spasms, transient  hypote nsion , hypo - or hyperglycemia and/or had 
transient increases in  alkaline phosphatase . 
Other potential FDG exposure related risks and mitigations include:  
• Overexposure of bladder to FDG , mitigated by [CONTACT_408500] (besides fasting) and 
frequent voiding for at least one hour after completion of the procedure   
• Radiation exposure  to nearby [CONTACT_8335] , mitigated by  [CONTACT_408501]  
• Risk of FDG overdose, mitigated by  [CONTACT_408502], s ubjects  will receive localization (positioning) scans with the RefleXion 
system integrated fan -beam kVCT imaging prior to each PET image collection session. The risks to the 
patient from this imaging procedure are expected to be in accordance with the general ris ks of low -dose 
radiation exposure, including the long- term risk of secondary malignancy.  
 
11. STUDY COMMITTEES  
11.1 Safety Monitoring Committee  
A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) consisting of individuals with pertinent expertise (including but not limited to a non-site radiation oncologist, site radiation oncologist and/or physicist, RefleXion Medical 
physician and RefleXion Medical technical staff) will be formed. Responsibilities of the committee are 
outlined in the SMC charter and  will include oversight of the  overall conduct of the study with regard to 
study progress, ensuring subject safety and overall data quality and integrity. The SMC will be responsible 
for assessing Cohort I data to identify and confirm the RRFD in the context of the primary endpoint  
(achieving  the minimum activity level in the treatment target area [ BTZ]) according to the  modified 3+3 
design outlined in Figure 5. Additionally, the SMC will review Cohort I secondary analyses and has  the 
discretion to consider  the performance of the  studied FDG dose  in the context of  secondary endpoints. If 
at the RRFD,  the performance of emulated BgRT delivery meets statistical parameters for success in the 
primary endpoint and there are no objections arising from the other secondary analyses, then the SMC 
will open Cohort II to accrual. Additionally, the SMC will monitor p atient safety by [CONTACT_408503]., Confidential   985-[ZIP_CODE] v5.0 
  58 of 67
  including AE onset, intensity, action taken, and outcome  on a regular basis for the duration of the study 
for both cohorts.   
11.2  Independent Image Rev iewers  
Independent image reviewers  with pertinent expertise in radiation oncology  and/or radiology will assess 
RMRS PET and thir d-party diagnostic PET/CT images  in order to  determine the agreement standard and 
external image concordance secondary endpoints for Cohort I and Cohort II.  All the readers will be trained 
using identical training data set and image review software programs as detailed in the image review 
charter (IRC).   RMRS PET images will be read by [CONTACT_408504] t hird-party diagnostic  
PET/CT images will be  read by [CONTACT_408505]. Read ers will be blinded to patient diagnosis,  reader 
evaluations, images from the compared device  (i.e. the radiolog ist reviewer s for the diagnostic PET/CT 
would be blinded to the patient’s RMRS PET and RMRS  kVCT  for localization ) but not  the patient’s Sim  CT 
and other clinical data.   Each reader will use the  applicable schema and answer the same set  of questions  
to generate a positive or negative decision  as outlined in Section 6. Image assessments will be directly 
entered by [CONTACT_408506] . 
12. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 Compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP)  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with clinical principles 
and practices originating from the Declaration of Helsinki. The study should be conducted in accordance 
to the Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and applicable local requirements, whichever provides subjects 
greater protection.

  13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Sample Size Calculation  
13.1.1  Cohort I: RRFD Cohort  
This objective of Cohort I is to identify the Recommended RefleXion FDG Dose (RRFD). Dose levels of 15 
and 20 mCi (if necessary) will be assessed sequentially in an escalation protocol. To that end, a modified 
3+[ADDRESS_515348] an Activity Concentration greater than 5 kBq/ml. A s mentioned in section 4.2, dose 
escalation to the second dose level can also be triggered by [CONTACT_408508].  
The modified 3+3 design with 6 patients at the ‘ Recommended RefleXion FDG Dose level’ aims to ensure 
that the observed proportion of patients below activity threshold to be less than 33%. The following table 
shows the probability of observing at most 1 of 6 below activity threshold with various true below activity 
rates:  
Probability of Observations at Most 1 of 6 below Activity Threshold  
True below activity rate  40%  30%  20%  10%  
Probability at most 1 of 
6 patients below activity 
threshold  0.233  0.420  0.655  0.886  
 
As such, either 6 patients will be accrued if 15 mCi FDG meets criteria or 9 or 12 total patients will be 
accrued if escalation to 20 mCi is required.  
Descriptive statistics will be utilized for all secondary endpoints.  
13.1.2  Cohort II: Emulated Delivery  Cohor t  
The purpose of Cohort II is to emulate delivery of BgRT plans based upon clinical PET data obtained on  the 
RefleXion system from human subjects using the RRFD established in Cohort I.  
The primary endpoint is the percent of  radiotherapy  fractions  where the emulated BgRT dose 
distribution  in silico  is shown to be consistent with  the approved BgRT treatment plan (i.e., 95% 
of DVH Delivered  points for the BTZ and OARs fall within  the bounded  DVH  of the approved  BgRT  plan).     
As previously described in Section 4.3, a BgRT dose distribution is conside red evaluable if:  
• The subject has successfully undergone BgRT plan creation, physics quality assurance, and plan 
approval  
RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol   
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential    985- [ZIP_CODE] v5.0 
  61 of 67
  • A “pass” signal is achieved at the PET PreScan  evaluation preceding the long- duration PET emission 
collection  
The sample size was determined a priori to represent a sufficient number of dose distributions for a robust 
sampling of BgRT deliveries under clinical conditions, including both before and aft er start of external 
beam radiotherapy. A sample size of [ADDRESS_515349] 1 inconsistency out of 16 evaluable 
dose distributions when true inconsistency rate is 5%, as shown in below table:  
Cum ulative Probability at most 1 inconsistency out of 16 evaluable distributions : 
True inconsistency rate  40%  30%  20%  10%  5% 
Probability at most 1 non -
concurrence out of 16 assessments  0.003  0.026  0.141  0.515  0.811  
 
Given that no prior data exists for biology -guided radiotherapy, we will report descriptive statistics for 
secondary endpoints, as defined in section 4. The summary s tatistics for BgRT workflow steps will be 
described for all enrolled patients including those with non -evaluable dose distributions.  
13.2 General Consideration  
Data collected will be presented using summary tables, patient data listings, and figures (TLFs). Co ntinuous 
variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics with the mean (standard deviation), median, 
minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_22977]. TLFs 
will be presented separately for each Cohort.  Cohort I will be summarized by [CONTACT_15994], if more than 1, 
and total. Cohorts  I and  II will be summarized by [CONTACT_4622] (bone, lung) and total.  
13.2.1  Patient Disposition  
A summary of patient disposition including patients who enrolled in the study, patients who completed 
the study, terminated study early, and the reasons for early study termination  
13.2.2  Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
The demographic characteristics (e.g., age, race, ethnicity, gender, baseline height, and baseline body weight) and baseline characteristics such as ECOG PS, disease status etc. will be summarized and listed. 
Categorical characteristics (e.g., gender, ethnicity and race, ECOG) will be summarized by [CONTACT_7203].  
13.2.3  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
RefleXion Medical Radiotherapy System   Clinical Study Protocol   
RefleXion Medical Inc., Confidential    985- [ZIP_CODE] v5.0 
  62 of 67
  Each med ication will be coded to a preferred term and an Anatomic Therapeutic Classification (ATC) code 
using WHO Drug dictionary. Prior concomitant medication is defined as any medication ended prior to the 
first day of the FDG administration. The number and perc entage of patients taking each prior or 
concomitant medication will be displayed by [CONTACT_18557], preferred term and treatment group.  
13.2.4  Safety Analyses  
Extent of FDG exposure will be summarized by [CONTACT_408509], cumulative dose, any dose interruption 
and dose reduction. Safety will be assessed through AEs, changes in laboratory parameters, and vital signs. 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA); AE severities will be 
graded using the CTCAE criteria.  
All AE data will be listed. Notably,  actual delivery of BgRT treatment to the patient is not part of this 
investigation . All treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) , defined  as adverse events not present prior to FDG 
exposure  and study procedures ,  will be summarized, as follows:  
• All TEAEs by [CONTACT_408510]  
• All TEAEs related to the study device and/or FDG exposure by [CONTACT_408510]  
• All Grade 3/4/5 TEAEs  
• All Treatment Emergent SAEs by [CONTACT_408510]  
• All Related Treatment Emergent SAEs related to study device and/or FDG exposure by [CONTACT_408511]. Laboratory values outside 
the corresponding normal range s will be flagged in listings.  
Observed and Changes from baseline vital signs and ECOG data will be summarized similarly as laboratory 
values.  
13.2.5  Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
Continuous primary and secondary endpoints will be summarized descriptively using the mean 
(standard deviation), median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical primary and secondary endpoints 
will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_22977].  
For Cohort I secondary imaging endpoints, agreement comparison analysis between diffe rent readers 
will also be performed. The descriptive statistics including overall, positive and negative percent 
agreement will be calculated for each endpoint.  
For categorical endpoints of Cohort II, the primary analysis will use the number of evaluable radiation 
dose distributions (Dose Volume Histograms) instead of number of subjects as the denominator under 
the assumption that all assessments are independent to each other. To evaluate the robustness of the 
primary analysis results, a sensitivity analysis will be carried out taking the within -subject correlation 
into account.

1Baseline Assessments should be completed within 14 days of RMRS PET Imaging- only session  
2Informed consent is not considered a baseline assessment  and has no requirement to be completed within a specific time window from study visits  
3Women of child -bearing potential only; urine or serum, within [ADDRESS_515355] is not done (or planned to be done) as a part of standard of care, a Sim CT will be obtained at baseline  
6AEs to be assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 5. In Cohort II, d irected grading for bladder and bone marrow toxicity will be completed at 
baseline and 72±24 hours after final FDG administration.  
†At the PET I maging -only session  timepoint in Cohort I , if the third -party PET scan cannot be initiated within [ADDRESS_515356] -party diagnostic 
PET/CT scan can be completed with a separate FDG injection 24 to 96  hours  after the initial FDG injection. 
 ‡At the last fraction  of SBRT  timepoint in Cohort II , if the  third -party PET scan cannot be initiated within [ADDRESS_515357] -party diagnostic PET/CT 
scan can be completed with a separate FDG injection 24 to 96 hours after the initial FDG injection.

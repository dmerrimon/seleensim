Title of study:  Comparison of Exacerbation Risk and Health Outcomes in 
Maintenance Treatment Naïve COPD patients using Stiolto vs. 
Trelegy.  
Rationale and 
background:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of 
morbidity and mortality throughout the  world.[ADDRESS_1107234] leading cause of death in the [LOCATION_002] (US). 2,3 
The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)  
2020 report and the American Thoracic Society 2020 report 
recommends dual bronchodilator therapy (DBT) with long -acting 
muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) plus long -acting beta2 -agonists 
(LABAs) for patients with COPD who have persistent symptoms 
and/or exace rbations on LAMA or LABA monotherapy. 4,5 
Consideration of escalation to triple therapy (TT; 
LAMA+LABA+inhaled corticosteroids [ICS]) is recommended in 
case of further exacerbation (≥2 moderate exacerbations or 1 severe 
exacerbation) and after assessing the risks/benefits. An important 
consideration is the trade -off between preventing exacerbations and 
the increased risk of pneumonia associated with addition of ICSs. [ADDRESS_1107235] TT use further, to only patients 
who are likely to respond to ICS (such as ≥2 moderate exacerbations 
or 1 severe exacerbation in the previous year, to those with asthma - 
COPD overlap or elevated blood eosinophils. 7

N/A 
Title of study:  Comparison of Exacerbation Risk and Health Outcomes in 
Maintenance Treatment Naïve COPD patients using Stiolto vs. 
Trelegy.  
Rationale and 
background:  Several trials compared a single -inhaler fixed dose combination 
(FDC) TT with an open combination of TT ( ICS/LABA plus LAMA) 
respectively  and found  a small  degree  of greater  benefit  with FDC  TT. 
8 Several Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) assessing the 
comparison of DBT LAMA -LABA to TT FDC of LAMA -LABA -ICS 
inhalers reported fewer exacerbations over one year with TT  FDC.  
9,10,[ADDRESS_1107237] 40% -70% utilizing ICS before entering the clinical 
trials. 12, 13,14 TT is associated with 53% greater risk of pneumonia 
compared to DBT and is frequently used inappropriately, including 
overuse in certain COPD patients. 15,16,17,18,19 Approximately 13% - 
15% of maintenance treatment naïve patients are prescribed FDC TT 
as first line long -acting maintenance medication (Data on File) 
contradicting guideline recommendations and irrespective of the 
safety concerns. We believe a major reason of that practice pattern is 
just out of convenience as FDC TT are now available in the market. 
and certain pharmaceutical companies are encouraging early 
prescribing of triple therapy, incl uding amongst primary care 
physicians. Any deviation in pharmacological management, 
particularly maintenance treatment initiation of COPD patients that is 
different from GOLD [ADDRESS_1107238] both clini cal and economic 
consequences. 20

N/A 
Title of study:  Comparison of Exacerbation Risk and Health Outcomes in 
Maintenance Treatment Naïve COPD patients using Stiolto vs. 
Trelegy.  
Rationale and 
background:  Given the high -cost side effect associated with long -term use of ICS 
and inconsistent evidence concerning whether there is a clinically 
relevant benefit of ICS combination therapy in terms of COPD disease 
control, it is important to assess differences betw een subsets of COPD 
patients in terms of the effectiveness and cost of FDC TT versus other 
non-ICS options, such as FDC DBT (e.g., Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]+Olodaterol).  
 
In view of all the above findings which represent a limited view of the 
patients who could potential ly use these FDC TT treatments we intend 
to conduct an observational study in a real -world clinical practice 
setting. There is a clear unmet need for better evidence on specific 
patient populations upon which to base FDC TT treatment 
recommendations. We pr opose to assess the effectiveness of Trelegy 
Ellipta, a FDC TT and compare it with Stiolto, a FDC DBT in patients 
who are maintenance treatment naïve and measure the incidence of 
COPD exacerbation, the incidence of community acquired 
pneumonia, health care  resource utilization (HCRU) and associated 
HCRU  costs.  
 
Trelegy Ellipta is a FDC of TT (Fluticasone Furoate + Umeclidinium  
+ Vilanterol, 100/62.5/25 mcg) approved by [CONTACT_109344] 
2017 for once -daily, maintenance treatment of COPD. Stiolto 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_783474] a FDC of DBT (tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1893] + olodaterol, 5/5 
mcg), approved by [CONTACT_802242] 2015 for once -daily, maintenance 
treatme nt of COPD).

Research question 
and objectives:  The goal of this study is to investigate the risk of COPD 
exacerbations, community acquired pneum onia, and health care 
utilization in maintenance treatment naïve patients treated as first line 
therapy with Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) of Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] + 
Olodaterol (Stiolto, 5/5 mcg), in comparison to maintenance treatment 
naïve patients treated with firs t line therapy, FDC of Fluticasone 
Furoate + Umeclidinium + Vilanterol (Trelegy, 100/62.5/25 mcg).  
 
Primary objective:  
▪ To characterize the COPD patient population who are 
maintenance treatment naïve and initiated Trelegy or Stiolto as 
the first line  therapy.  
 
▪ To compare the effectiveness of Stiolto (new treatment 
initiation) with Trelegy (new treatment initiation) for time  to 
the first COPD exacerbation (moderate/severe) in COPD 
patients who are maintenance treatment  naïve.  
 
▪ To compare COPD exacerbations following initiation of 
Stiolto (new treatment initiation) with initiation of Trelegy 
(new treatment initiation)  
 
Seconda ry objectives:  
▪ To compare the effectiveness of Stiolto (new treatment 
initiation) with Trelegy (new treatment initiation) for time to

Study design  This is a non -interventional study with existing data. It will be a 
retrospective, observational, non -interventional, new user design, real 
world study of Commercial Insurance and Medicare beneficiaries, 
using administrative claims data for the period of 15th September 
[ADDRESS_1107242] March 2020.  
Patients initiating Stiolto, or Trelegy will be identified using 
pharmacy claims (  database). The date of the first prescription 
claim (on or after 15th September 2017) will be defined as the index 
date. Patients will be required to have a diagnosis of COPD (ICD -9- 
CM: 491.xx, 492.xx, 496.xx; ICD -10-CM: J41 -J44) on two sepa rate 
medical claims. Patients [ADDRESS_1107243] continuous enrolment for 12 
months prior to the index date. Patients will be excluded if they show 
any use of COPD maintenance medications (ICS , LABA or LAMA in 
any combination), during the baseline period of six months pre -index 
date. This will satisfy the criteria for being considered as treatment 
naive. Patients with two separate medical claims with a diagnosis of 
asthma, lung cancer, intersti tial lung disease, or cystic fibrosis during 
the study period will be excluded. Using propensity score matching 
(PSM) technique, we will develop matched cohorts of patients 
between Stiolto initiators and Trelegy initiators. We will conduct 1:[ADDRESS_1107244] neighbor  matching approach. Exacerbation 
will be defined as a COPD hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (severe exacerbation) or 
Emergency Department (ED) visit (severe exacerbation) with COPD, 
or use of approved respi[INVESTIGATOR_802199] (e.g., Azithromycin) ± Oral 
CorticoSteroids (OCS) medications within ±7 days of the 
office/outpatient visit (moderate exacerbation) as the primary 
diagnosis. Multiple exacerbations occurring within 14 days of each 
other will be considered as a single exacerbation and will be per the 
higher  severity.

7. RATIONALE AND  BACKGROUND  
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality 
throughout the world.[ADDRESS_1107251] leading cause of death in the 
[LOCATION_002] (US). 2,3 The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 
2020 report and the American Thoracic Society 2020 report recommends dual bronchodilator 
therapy (DBT) with long -acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs)  plus long -acting beta2 - 
agonists (LABAs) for patients with COPD who have persistent symptoms and/or 
exacerbations on LAMA or LABA monotherapy. 4,5 Consideration of escalation to triple 
therapy (TT; LAMA+LABA+inhaled corticosteroids [ICS]) is recommended in case of 
further exacerbation (≥2 moderate exacerbations or 1 severe exacerbation) and after assessing 
the risks/benefits. An important consideration is the trade -off between preventing 
exacerb ations and the increased risk of pneumonia associated with addition of ICSs. [ADDRESS_1107252] TT use further, to only patients who are likely to respond to 
ICS (such as ≥2 moderate exacerbations or 1 se vere exacerbation in the previous year, to 
those with asthma -COPD overlap or elevated blood eosinophils. 7

Several trials compared a single -inhaler fixed dose combination (FDC) TT with an open 
combination of TT (ICS/LABA plus LAMA) respectively and found a small degree of 
greater benefit with FDC TT. 8 Several Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) assessing the 
comparison of DBT LAMA -LABA to TT FDC of LAMA -LABA -ICS inhalers reported 
fewer exacerbations over one year with TT FDC. 9,10,[ADDRESS_1107254] 40% -70% 
utilizing ICS before entering the clinical trials. 12,13,14 TT is associated with 53% greater risk 
of pneumonia compared to DBT and is frequently used inappropriately, including overuse in 
certain COPD patients. 15,16,17,18,19 Approximately 13% -15% of maintenance treatment naïve 
patients are prescribed FDC TT as first line long -acting maintenance medication (Data on 
File) contradicting guideline recommendations a nd irrespective of the safety concerns. We 
believe a major reason of that practice pattern is just out of convenience as FDC TT are now 
available in the market. and certain pharmaceutical companies are encouraging early 
prescribing of triple therapy, inclu ding amongst primary care physicians. Any deviation in 
pharmacological management, particularly maintenance treatment initiation of COPD 
patients that is different from GOLD [ADDRESS_1107255] of FDC TT versus other non -ICS 
options, such as FDC DBT (e.g., Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]+Olodaterol).  
 
In view of all the above findings wh ich represent a limited view of the patients who could 
potentially use these FDC TT treatments we intend to conduct an observational study in a  
real-world clinical practice setting. There is a clear unmet need for better evidence on specific 
patient popula tions upon which to base FDC TT treatment recommendations. We propose to 
assess the effectiveness of Trelegy Ellipta, a FDC TT and compare it with Stiolto, a FDC 
DBT in patients who are maintenance treatment naïve and measure the incidence of COPD 
exacerba tion, the incidence of community acquired pneumonia, health care resource 
utilization (HCRU) and associated HCRU costs.  
 
Trelegy Ellipta is a FDC of TT (Fluticasone Furoate + Umeclidinium + Vilanterol, 
100/62.5/25 mcg) approved by [CONTACT_109344] 2017  for once -daily, maintenance 
treatment of COPD. Stiolto Respi[INVESTIGATOR_783474] a FDC of DBT (tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1893] + olodaterol, 5/5

Primary objective:  
▪ To characterize  the COPD  patient  population  who are maintenance  treatment  naïve  and 
initiated Trelegy or Stiolto as the first line  therapy.  
 
▪ To compare the effectiveness of Stiolto (new treatment initiation) with Trelegy (new 
treatment initiation) for time to the first COPD exacerbation (moderate/severe) in  
COPD patients who are maintenance treatment  naïve.  
 
▪ To compare COPD exacerbations following initiation of Stiolto (new treatment 
initiation) with initiation of Trelegy (new treatment initiation)  
 
Secondary objectives:  
▪ To compare the effectiveness of Stiol to (new treatment initiation) with Trelegy (new 
treatment initiation) for time to the first hospi[INVESTIGATOR_802202]ïve.  
 
▪ To assess differences between Stiolto vs Trelegy in, “all -cause” and “COPD and/or

the baseline period of six months pre -index date. This will sati sfy the criteria for being  
considered as treatment naive. Patients with two separate medical claims with a diagnosis of 
asthma, lung cancer, interstitial lung disease, or cystic fibrosis during the study period will be 
excluded. Using propensity score matc hing (PSM) technique, we will develop matched 
cohorts of patients between Stiolto initiators and Trelegy initiators. We will conduct 1:[ADDRESS_1107261] neighbour matching approach with a caliper of 0.2. Exacerbation will 
be defined as a COPD hospit alization (severe exacerbation) or Emergency Department (ED) 
visit (severe exacerbation) with COPD, or use of approved respi[INVESTIGATOR_802199] (e.g., 
Azithromycin) ± Oral CorticoSteroids (OCS) medications within ±7 days of the 
office/outpatient visit (mode rate exacerbation) as the primary diagnosis. Multiple 
exacerbations occurring within 14 days of each other will be considered as a single 
exacerbation and will be per the higher severity. A schematic of the study design is presented 
below in Figure 1 .

9.2.3 Study Visits  
 
9.2.4 Study  Discontinuation  
 
Boehringer Ingelheim reserves the right to discontinue the study overall or at any time for the 
following reasons:  
 
1. In the overall population, Stiolto initiators from September 2017 – March 2020 will be 
matched using Propensity Score Match ing (PSM) with Trelegy initiators from September 
2017 – March [ADDRESS_1107271] of covariates listed in section 10.2.2. to ensure 
that the two cohorts are well balanced (i.e., standardized difference ≤10%) across all 
characteristics. However, for  any baseline characteristics with significant differences 
(Standardized differences (SD) greater than 0.10 (10%)) after PSM matching, these 
characteristics will be included as covariates in the regression models, or we will develop 
interaction terms to ma tch on or discontinue the study if major channeling (SD>10%) is 
observed.  
 
2. Violation of Good Pharmacoepi[INVESTIGATOR_47630] (GPP), the study protocol, or the 
contract by a research collaborator, disturbing the appropriate conduct of the  study  
 
 
The research  collaborator will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in case of 
study termination (except in case of the second reason).  
 
9.3 VARIABLES  
 
The definitions for exacerbations are as below.  
 
▪ A severe exacerbation will be defined as  follows:  
o An inpatient admission or an ER visit with a COPD diagnosis code in the 
primary position;  or 
o An inpatient admission or an ER visit with a diagnosis code for acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_802205] a COPD diagnosis code in any 
position; or  
o An inp atient admission or an ER visit with a diagnosis code for acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_802206] + an inpatient admission or an ER 
visit within ±7 days with a COPD diagnosis code in any  position.  
▪ A moderate exacerbation will be defined as  follows:  
o An ambulatory (office or outpatient) visits with a COPD diagnosis code in any 
position + a pharmacy claim for an oral corticosteroid (OCS) prescription 
within ±7 days of the office/outpatient visit;  or

o An office or outpatient visit with a COPD diagnosis code in any position + a 
pharmacy claim for respi[INVESTIGATOR_802207] ±7 days of the 
office/outpatient visit; or  
o An office or outpatient visit with a COPD diagnosis code in any position + a 
pharmacy claim for an OCS + a pharmacy claim for respi[INVESTIGATOR_802208] ±7 days of the office/outpatient  visit.  
 
▪ Pneumonia diagnosis: Binary indicators will be created to identify patients with a 
diagnosis of 1) pneumonia ( Appendix 1 ). The time to first pneumonia diagnosis, 
and time to first pneumonia, during follow -up will also be  captured.  
▪ Pneu monia -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: Binary indicators will be created to identify 
patients with an acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_802209] 1) pneumonia in any 
position ( Appendix 1 ) The time to first pneumonia -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_802210] -up will also be  captured.  
▪ COPD exacerbation and/or pneumonia diagnosis: Binary indicators will be 
created to identify patients with each of the following composite outcomes: severe 
COPD exacerbation or an acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18506] a diagn osis of pneumonia in 
any position, severe COPD exacerbation or a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18506] a diagnosis of 
pneumonia in any position, any COPD exacerbation or pneumonia diagnosis in 
any position, and any COPD exacerbation or pneumonia diagnosis in any position. 
Time to event variables will be created for each composite outcome during the 
follow -up period.  
 
The following outcomes will be measured in the baseline and follow -up periods. The baseline 
period will include claims occurring on the index date, except for the index medication 
claims, which will be included in the follow -up period.  
 
▪ All-cause health care resource utilization: Indicator variables and counts of physician 
office  visits,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_802211],  ED visits,  “other”  (non-inpatient)  visits,  inpatient 
stays,  and pharmacy  claims  will be created.  Other  medical  visits  are a residual  category 
that includes, but is not limited to, services rendered at independent laboratories, 
assisted living facilities, and by [CONTACT_802244] p roviders. An indicator variable will be 
created  to identify  inpatient  stays  with an acute  stay during  the inpatient  admission.  The 
length of inpatient stays will also be captured. The time to first inpatient stay, the time 
to first inpatient stay with an acute stay, and the time to first ED visit during follow -up 
will be  captured.  
▪ COPD and/or pneumonia -related health care resource utilization: This utilization will 
be calculated analogously to all -cause utilization, but restricted to medical claims with 
a diagnosis for COPD and/or pneumonia, in any position ( Appendix 1 ) and pharmacy 
claims for a COPD -related treatment ( Appendix 2 ), including COPD -guideline 
recommended antibiotics ( Appendix  3).

▪ Pneumonia -related health care resource utilization: This utilization will be calculated 
analogously  to all-cause  utilization  but restricted  to medical  claims  with a diagnosis  for 
pneumonia in any position ( Appendix  1). 
▪ COPD or pneumonia -attributable health care resource utilization: This utilization will 
be calculated analogously to all -cause utilization, but restricted to medical claims with 
a diagnosis for COPD or pneumonia in the primary position or a diagnosis for acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_802212] a diagnosis  for COPD  or pneumonia  in a 
non-primary  position  (Appendix  1) and pharmacy  claims  for a COPD -related  treatment 
(Appendix 2 ), including COPD -guideline recommended antibiotics ( Appendix  3) 
▪ All-cause health care costs (insurer + patient paid amounts): Health care costs will be 
computed from the payer and patient perspective together. This is the actual amount 
paid to the provider by [CONTACT_802245] -pay and/or coinsurance 
amounts, rather than an estim ated cost. Total costs will be calculated and presented as 
the combined pharmacy costs and medical costs. Medical costs will be presented and 
will include sub -categories of physician office costs, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_802213], 
emergency services costs, inpati ent costs, and other  costs.  
o Costs will be adjusted to 2019 dollars using the medical care component of the 
Consumer Price Index (CPI) to reflect inflation between the date of the claim 
and 2019.[ADDRESS_1107274] 
available 2020 mid -year CPI [INVESTIGATOR_802214]. 22 
o Costs from other payers may be important, particularly for studies involving 
older patie nts dually eligible for commercial and Medicare coverage. In 
consultation with  this study will NOT incorporate the amounts estimated 
to be paid by [CONTACT_802246] a total paid or allowable amount. 23 
▪ COPD and/or pneumo nia-related health care costs (insurer + patient paid amounts): 
These costs will be calculated analogously to the all -cause costs, but restricted to 
medical claims with a diagnosis for COPD, pneumonia, or acute 
bronchitis/bronchiolitis  in any position  (Appendix  1) and pharmacy  claims  for a COPD - 
related treatment ( Appendix 2 ), including COPD -guideline recommended antibiotics

Clinical characteristics will be measured in the baseline period. The baseline period will 
include  claims  occurring  on the index  date,  except  for the index  medication  claims,  which 
will be included in the follow -up period.  
▪ Quan -Charlson  comorbidity  score:  A comorbidity  score  will be calculated  based  on the 
presence of diagnosis codes (in any position) on medical claims in the baseline period. 
24,25,26 The score  is calculated  based  on a weighted  sum of 12 comorbid  conditions.  The 
score represents the cumulative likelihood of one -year mortality and serves as a proxy 
for comorbidity  burden.  The Quan -Charlson  comorbidity  score  also will be categorized 
into the following groups: zero, one, two, three, four, and five or  more.  
▪ Oxygen therapy: Evidence of oxygen use will be captured in the baseline period based 
on diagnosis  (ICD -9, ICD-10), procedure  (HCPCS,  CPT,  ICD-9) and revenue  codes  for 
oxygen therapy ( Appendix  1). 
▪ Baseline respi[INVESTIGATOR_802215]: Indicator variables for respi[INVESTIGATOR_802216] (nebulizer treatments may appear in medical 
claims). Medication cla sses will include: LAMAs (alone; overall and separately), 
LABAs (alone), ICS (alone), ICS/LABA single inhaler combination medications, 
SAMAs (alone), SABAs (alone), SAMA/SABA single inhaler combination 
medications, any rescue (SAMA alone, SABA alone, or SA MA/SABA single inhaler 
combination medications), methylxanthines, phosphodiesterase -4 (PDE -4) inhibitors 
and oral corticosteroids (OCS). Baseline medication use variables will exclude claims 
which make up the index therapy assignment. Number of fills by [CONTACT_802247]. Indicator variables will be created to identify patients who are naïve to long - 
acting bronchodilators (free or fixed dose LAMAs or LABAs) and to long -acting 
bronchodilators plus inhaled corticosteroids (free or fixed dose LAMAs,  LABAs, and 
ICSs) at  index.  
▪ Index  provider  specialty:  The specialty  of the provider  on the index  prescription  fill will 
be captured. If no provider specialty is recorded on the index prescription fill, the 
provider  specialty  from  the most  recent  COPD -related visit on or prior  to the index  date 
will be captured. An indicator variable will identify if the provider specialty was 
determined  from  the index  pharmacy  claim.  Provider  specialty  will be classified  as one 
of the following:  pulmonology,  primary  care [family  practice,  general  practice,  and

9.3.1  Exposures  
 
Patients will be assigned to one of the following mutually exclusive study cohorts based on 
the index pharmacy claim: Stiolto Respi[INVESTIGATOR_802219]. Exposure measures will be 
based on pharmacy dispensing of the two medications under study, namely Sti olto Respi[INVESTIGATOR_802220], over a follow -up period, beginning the index date and lasting up to one 
year from index date. Discontinuation for index medication will be defined as a gap in index 
medication of ≥45 days (sensitivity analysis with ≥30 day s can be included) following the 
runout of days’ supply (discontinuation date = runout prior to the gap in therapy). Switch in 
index medication will be defined as a pharmacy fill for ≥30 consecutive days of a non -index 
maintenance medication (switch date =  first date of the new treatment regimen). Switch 
includes any other change in use of index medication by [CONTACT_140423], inclusive of a 
change to a different combination therapy (ICS/LABA FDC, different LAMA/LABA or 
LAMA/LABA/ICS FDC) change from a FDC  to a free form combination therapy with mono 
LAMA plus mono LABA, or mono ICS plus mono LABA, or mono LAMA plus mono 
LABA plus mono ICS or a change to a monotherapy.  
 
Individuals in the study cohort will be followed from the index date until the earliest of the 
date of a switch in treatment, addition of an ICS for the Stiolto Respi[INVESTIGATOR_802221], 
discontinuation of the index COPD maintenance treatment, the end of the study period, or the 
end of continuous health plan eligibility. Main analyses will be further l imited to the first 12 
months after index date, with sensitivity analyses considering all available data.  
 
All patients will be required to be continuously enrolled in the health plan for a minimum of 
12 months. The 12 months prior to and including the ind ex date (index date – 364 through 
index date) will be used to assess baseline characteristics. The period starting the day after the 
index date, up to a maximum of 12 months duration (index date +1 through index date +365) 
will be used to assess exacerbati on, pneumonia, HCRU and cost outcomes. Patients will be 
censored at the earliest of the following: discontinuation of the index medication (Stiolto or 
Trelegy), switch to a non -index medication, disenrollment from the health plan, [ADDRESS_1107279] -23 (2.0) / Saved on: 02 Jul 2020  Boehringer Ingelheim

9.3.2   Outcomes  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary  Outcomes  
 
 
The primary outcome event for effectiveness is time to first COPD exacerbation after cohort 
entry. The event is defined as  follows:  
 
▪ Severe  exacerbation:  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18506] a principal discharge diagnosis of COPD  and/or  
o An emergency department (ED) visit with a discharge diagnosis of  COPD  
o An inpatient admission or an ER visit with a diagnosis code for acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_802205] a COPD diagnosis code in any 
position  
 
▪ Mode rate exacerbation:  
o An antibiotic for a respi[INVESTIGATOR_802222] ± an  OCS  
 
Time to the first COPD exacerbation will be measured from index date until the occurrence 
of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140398] (severe exacerbation) or ED visit for COPD (severe 
exacerbation) or prescription of an antibiotic ± an OCS on the same day (moderate 
exacerbation). Severe and moderate exacerbations were considered as a composite for main 
analyses. Sensitivity analyses will include stratification by [CONTACT_140424].  
 
Exacerbations will be categorized as moderate or severe and a count of any (severe or 
moderate), severe, and moderate will be provided.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Secondary  Outcome(s)  
 
The secondary outcome is time to first hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140400] -acquired pneumonia 
(serious pneumonia). Pneumonia was defined using ICD -9-CM diagnoses 481.x -486.x; 
487.0, 507.x, 507.0, 507.1, 507.8, 510.0, 510.9, 511.0, 513.0, 514.x, 517.1, 519.8, 530.84, 
and ICD -10 diagnosis codes J10.0; J11.0; J12 -J18; J22;  J69; J85.0; J85.1; J86. This  
definition has been previously used in COPD. 27,28 
• COPD and/or pneumonia related HCRU (including acute inpatient stays and their 
length of stay, emergency department visits, ambulatory [Physician office visits, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110563]], and other medical visits)  
• COPD -related  HCRU  
• Pneumonia -related  HCRU  
• COPD -attributable  HCRU

HCRU is defined as total inpatient, emergency department, and outpatient care epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
Estimates will be presented both overall and for COPD and/or pneumonia -related care, 
defined as claims where a diagnosis of COPD or pneumonia is present. Medications used, 
defined as total number of distinct medication subclasses dispensed (e.g., [ADDRESS_1107280] Identifier) and total numb er of dispensing for medications per year. COPD - 
related medication utilization included all COPD medications, OCS, and guideline - 
recommended antibiotics  
 
Annual HCRU costs (including costs paid by [CONTACT_102], health plan, and any third party via 
coordin ation of benefits) will be then calculated as total costs, medical costs, pharmacy costs, 
ambulatory costs, ED costs, inpatient costs, and other costs. Costs were defined as related to 
COPD if the claim has a diagnosis for COPD in any position or is a phar macy claim for a 
medication used to treat COPD. The sum of all costs from all care settings and pharmacy 
dispensing will be assessed overall, for COPD and/or pneumonia -related care.  
 
9.3.3 Covariates  
 
Patient characteristics at  baseline will be assessed for Stiolto and Trelegy users overall and 
stratified by [CONTACT_642868].  
 
The covariates included in the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) will include all the below 
covariates including the ones defined during the 12-month pre -index baseline period and 
chronic comorbid conditions.  
• Gender  
• Age group (years, categorical and a continuous  variable)  
• Calendar year of cohort  entry  
• Region  
• Insurance type (e.g., Commercial,  Medicare)  
• Season of index date (winter, spring, summe r, fall) 
 
Additional characteristics that will be defined during the 12 -month pre -index baseline period:  
• Previous acute COPD exacerbation (measured both overall and in the 30 days prior to 
cohort entry), categorized as 0, 1, or  ≥2. 
o All exacerbations  (Moderate+Severe)  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]  (Severe)  
• Use of other respi[INVESTIGATOR_802223] 12 -month pre -index  period:  
o Short -acting  beta-agonists  
o Short -acting  Anticholinergics  
o Methylxanthines  
o LAMA  
o LABA

9.5 STUDY  SIZE  
 
Considering the study design being non -interventional study with existing data, retrospective, 
new user desi gn and treatments being: Stiolto Respi[INVESTIGATOR_96862] (active treatment) vs. Trelegy Ellipta 
(comparator), primary endpoint of time to first exacerbation (moderate/severe) and COPD 
population being maintenance treatment naïve, we didn’t find any such study that exactl y 
matches these criteria in literature.  
 
We looked at two retrospective, observational, non -interventional studies in the literature. 
Suissa  et al published in Chest (CHEST 2020; 157(4):846 -855) a real -world study of COPD 
treatment, the triple combination of LAMA, LABA, and ICS inhalers and compared its 
effectiveness to combining LAMA and LABA inhalers in preventing COPD exacerbations.23 
Suissa et al had a sample size of ~[ADDRESS_1107282] ratio (HR) of a COPD exacerbation associated with LAMA -LABA -ICS 
initiation compared with LAMA -LABA initiation was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.87 -1.08). For patients 
with blood eosinophil counts > 6%, the HR was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.46 - 0.94). For patients with 
two or more prior exacerbations, it was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70 -0.98). 29 The incidence of severe 
pneumonia requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_802224] -LABA -ICS initiation (HR, 
1.46; 95% CI, 1.03 -2.06). 29 The second study, by [CONTACT_802248] -paid costs, 
COPD exacerbations, and pneumonia diagnoses among patients newly treated with a LAMA  
+ LABA regimen composed of tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] (TIO) + olodaterol (OLO) in  a fixed -dose 
combination inhaler (TIO + OLO) or TT in a U.S. Medicare Advantage Part D insured 
population.24 This study was published in Journal of Managed Care & Specialty  
Pharmacy 2020 26:10, 1363 -1374 and had a sample siz e of ~[ADDRESS_1107283] severe COPD exacerbation (P = 0.020) and first pneumonia 
diagnosis (P = 0.002) for TIO + OLO versus TT and a lower percentage of TIO + OLO 
patients experiencing these events (sever e COPD exacerbation: 9.0% vs. 16.1%; pneumonia: 
14.5% vs. 19.3%).30 
 
Feasibility Assessment: Using  database we identified 15,[ADDRESS_1107284] March 2020. These patients had 12 -months of baseline with both medical and 
pharmacy coverage. After applying the inclusion/ exclusion criteria the sample size is 
reduced to [ADDRESS_1107285] PSM 
our final sample size is 3018 in each group, which gives sufficient power when compared to 
earlier studies (Suissa et al (~2000 patients with LAMA -LABA) and Palli et (~1500 patients 
per cohort) as mentioned above). Based  on these two studies from the literature and the 
feasibility numbers for the current study we are confident that we will have enough patients 
to ensure ≥80%  power.

9.6 DATA  MANAGEMENT  
 
All established security and confidentiality procedures will be observ ed by [CONTACT_802249]/or 
 personnel who are assigned appropriate access to the data. Enrolment 
data, medical claims, and prescription claims will be accessed from the administrative 
claims’ dataset. The analyses will be performed on limited data sets tha t are void of  
 
member protected health information and all results were shared in aggregate form 
only.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1107286] descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, standard 
deviation, median and range for continuous variables; counts and percentages for categorical 
variables). However, for any baseline characteristics with significant differen ces 
(Standardized differences (SD) greater than 0.10 (10%)) after PSM matching, these 
characteristics will be included as covariates in the regression models, or we will develop 
interaction terms to match on or discontinue the study if major channeling  (SD>10%) is 
observed. Basically, a two -step approach: The first step will be to characterize the patients 
after PS matching to see whether balance can be achieved (based on SD) and at least [ADDRESS_1107287] set of covariates considered to be prognostic factors. 
In the event of study discontinuation, partia l results (all analysis leading up to and including 
PSM) will be provided in a final report.  
 
A Cox proportional hazards models will be used on the time to first COPD exacerbation with 
treatment as a covariate. Comparisons will be made between treatment co horts using HR and 
will be presented with associated 95% CI. To account for variable lengths of follow -up 
observation time, population annualized results will be provided (annualized costs [e.g., Sum 
of total costs/Sum of total follow -up patient years for each cohort]). The annualized cost may 
be modelled as dependent variable in a Generalized Linear  Model with treatment cohort as a 
covariate and the follow -up patient years as an offset for each cohort.  
Comparisons will be made between treatment cohorts and  will be presented with associated 
95% CI. Additionally, descriptive techniques that account for the length of observation time 
measure will be used appropriately. Per patient per month calculations will not be performed 
because of bias concerns. Appropria te tests comparing the Stiolto cohort and the Trelegy 
cohort (e.g., standardized differences, McNamara’s tests, paired t -tests, sign tests) will be 
used based on the distribution of the measure. Patients not matched will be excluded from the 
post-match ana lysis.  
 
9.7.1 Main analysis  
 
Analyses will be presented comparing Stiolto vs Trelegy overall after PSM matching and 
stratified as follows if the sample size allows (at least 15% in each strata):  
• Low history of exacerbation: 0 inpatient (i.e., severe exacerbation s) and 0 -1 outpatient 
events (i.e., moderate  exacerbations)

• High history of exacerbation: ≥1 inpatient (i.e., severe exacerbations) or ≥2 outpatient 
events (includes  ED) 
 
We will describe the formation of the study cohort. Patient characteristics at baseline in 
patients treated with Stiolto and patients treated with Trelegy will be assessed separately 
using standard descriptive statistics.  
 
Propensity scores including both pre-specified and data -derived variables will be then 
calculated. Balance of patient characteristics between the cohorts will be described before 
and after propensity score application and compared using standardized differences. For each 
Stiolto patient, a Trelegy patient with the closest available propensity score will be selected. 
Nearest neighbor matching method with a caliper of 0.2 will be utilized. Standardized 
differences greater than 0.10 (10%) will be taken to indicate imbalance, and these variabl es 
will also be included in outcome models, categorized as appropriate.  
 
For the analysis of the primary objective, a Cox proportional hazard regression model will be 
used to perform an as -treated analysis that assesses the effect of first line maintenance  
medication with Stiolto versus the first line maintenance medication with Trelegy on the time 
to first COPD exacerbation. This estimates the HR of a COPD exacerbation associated with 
Stiolto use relative to Trelegy use, along with 95% CI. Based on the day s’ supply post index 
date, allowing a grace period of 45 days following the end of days’ supply to account for 
intermittent use.  
 
Stratified analyses will be using the same approach as the main analysis. Calculation of 
propensity scores will be repeated wi thin the subset of the cohort with available results to 
create weighted populations suitable for these stratified analyses.  
 
The analysis of the secondary objective related to the risk of pneumonia will also be assessed 
using Cox proportional hazard regres sion models with an as -treated approach, like that of the 
primary analysis.  
 
In terms of HCRU, we will be presenting continuous and categorical variables using standard 
descriptive statistics to describe total visits and total costs related to inpatient, o utpatient, and 
emergency care as well as distinct medications used, and pharmacy costs. Utilization and 
costs will be stratified to facilitate comparison between Stiolto and Trelegy and presented by 
[CONTACT_802250] a c omposite. All -cause and COPD and/or 
pneumonia specific cost and utilization characteristics will be described separately.

9.9 LIMITATIONS OF THE RESEARCH  METHODS  
 
As with all studies utilizing claims data, there are certain limitations that should be 
noted. The presence of a claim for a filled prescription or prescription absent a claim 
does not indicate that the medication was consumed or that it was taken as prescribed. 
Medications filled over the counter or provided as samples by [CONTACT_802252]. Patients with commercial health insurance may be 
different from those with non -commercial or without (commercial) health insurance, 
and hence study results may not be generalizable to the overall population. Population 
aged [ADDRESS_1107291] external 
validity in the case of Medicare, Medicare Advantage or Medicaid  patients.  
Socioeconomic data is not available. Smoking status information during the study 
period is not available in this data source. Since unmatched patients will be excluded, 
the results may not be generalizable to all patients. Some study measures and 
outcomes will include missing data and hence reduce the sample size.  
This real -world evidence study lacks controls  available with RCTs. Patient 
misclassification, missing data, objective and reliable measurement of patient 
outcomes, and lack of detailed information regarding subjects’ clinical history or 
clinical status during the study timeframe may undermine the acc uracy of our study 
results. In the absence of randomization, confounding by [CONTACT_140427]. 
Controlling via PSM should limit this bias but can control only for measured 
covariates and may produce estimates that are impacted by [CONTACT_802253]. This 
is of particular importance in the case of lifestyle factors that are less critical to 
insurance billing and thus poorly captured in claims data.  
There is the possibility of information bias due to misclassification of the outcomes or 
exposure or missing data as prescriptions dispensed by a pharmacy but not taken by 
[CONTACT_140432]. Pharmacy dispensing data does 
bring us one step closer to patient use than physician prescribing given that the patient 
has take n the effort to obtain the medication as instructed, however, information such 
as indication can only be inferred based on diagnostic patterns.  
Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility of unmeasured differences in exacerbation 
risk across exposure groups . Data on several relevant confounders (e.g., Body mass  
index, smoking habits, symptom scores), as well as data from spi[INVESTIGATOR_802225]. Although certain bias analysis can be 
planned but they are limited by [CONTACT_941] s trength of the assumptions they rely on. An 
impact of residual confounding caused by [CONTACT_802254]. Further, we cannot exclude the possibility that patients may have gone on to 
develop outcomes later beyond the study period. We will conduct bias analysis as 
appropriate to address these concerns.

1The American Thoracic Society (2017) and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (2020) 
guidelines recommend that antibiotics for acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis be selected based on local 
sensitivity patterns. For more specific recommendations, The Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy (2020) was 
referenced.  
 
 
COPD Exacerbation  Definition  
• Exacerbation  Hierarchy:  Exacerbation  events will be classified  as severe  or moderate 
according to the highest severity contributing  event.  
• Exacerbation  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]:  Exacerbations  occurring  within  [ADDRESS_1107301] 
severity contributing  event.  
• Epi[INVESTIGATOR_802234]: The start date of the exacerbation epi[INVESTIGATOR_802235] (medical encounter or pharmacy fill for an OCS or antibiotic). The end 
date of the exacerbation  epi[INVESTIGATOR_802236] (or discharge date if an inpatient event) + 14  days.

• Single Event Epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]  
• In a single event epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the exacerbation begins with the earliest occurrence of these 
events: COPD exacerbation defined inpatient admission, ER visit, ambulatory visit, or 
corticosteroid or antibiotic dispensing as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. In a singl e event 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the exacerbation ends 14 days from the start of the event, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], 
or following the OCS or antibiotic dispensing, whichever is  later.  
• Epi[INVESTIGATOR_802237] = service date of a qualifying event (inpatient admission, ED visit, 
ambul atory visit, or OCS or antibiotic  dispensing).  
o If the qualifying event is a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the start date is the admission  date.  
o If the qualifying event is an ED visit, the start date is the service  date.  
o If the qualifying  event  is an ambulatory  visit or an OCS  or antibiotic  dispensing, 
the start date is the earliest of the associated medical visit or medication 
dispensing  date.  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_802238]  
o If the qualifying event is a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: discharge date + 14  days 
o If the qualifying event is an ER visit: start date + 14  days 
o If the qualifying  event  is an ambulatory  visit or an OCS  or antibiotic  dispensing: 
Fthe latest of the medical visit or medication dispensing + 14 days 
• If the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_802239] -up, then set an additional  flag 
CENSORED =1. 
• NOTE:  Under  this definition,  it is possible  for the runout  of a medication  to exceed  the 
End Date.  
• MULTIPLE EVENT EPI[INVESTIGATOR_72781]  
• If another qualifying event occurs before the epi[INVESTIGATOR_802238], then the epi[INVESTIGATOR_802240]. The date of the second event is used to reset the End Date per the definition 
above, using information from this second event. The process continues until a 14 -day 
period with no exacerbation qualifying events occur. The End Date is set (as defined 
above).  
• Epi[INVESTIGATOR_802234]: (End date – Start date) +  1

Version	5			4	STATEMENT	OF	COMPLIANCE		The	trial	will	be	conducted	in	accordance	with	International	Conference	on	Harmonisation	Good	Clinical	Practice	(ICH	GCP)	and	the	applicable	United	States	(US)	Code	of	Federal	Regulations	(CFR).	The	Principal	Investigator	[INVESTIGATOR_201561],	or	changes	to	the	protocol	will	take	place	without	prior	agreement	from	the	sponsor	and	documented	approval	from	the	Institutional	Review	Board	(IRB),	except	where	necessary	to	eliminate	an	immediate	hazard(s)	to	the	trial	participants.	All	personnel	involved	in	the	conduct	of	this	study	have	completed	Human	Subjects	Protection	and	ICH	GCP	Training.		The	protocol,	informed	consent	form(s),	recruitment	materials,	and	all	participant	materials	will	be	submitted	to	the	IRB	for	review	and	approval.		Approval	of	both	the	protocol	and	the	consent	form	must	be	obtained	before	any	participant	is	enrolled.		Any	amendment	to	the	protocol	will	require	review	and	approval	by	[CONTACT_237093].		All	changes	to	the	consent	form	will	be	IRB	approved;	a	determination	will	be	made	regarding	whether	a	new	consent	needs	to	be	obtained	from	participants	who	provided	consent,	using	a	previously	approved	consent	form.		1 PROTOCOL	SUMMARY		1.1 SYNOPSIS		Title	of	the	Study:	Endoscopic	Trigger	Finger	Release		Number	of	Subjects:	24		Objective:	The	objective	of	this	study	is	to	compare	recovery,	scar	and	patient	satisfaction	after	retrograde	endoscopic	trigger	finger	release	versus	standard	open	surgical	treatment.		Methodology:	Consecutive	patients	presenting	with	trigger	finger	interested	in	surgical	release	of	the	A1	pulley	will	be	prospectively	treated	with	endoscopic	versus	open	surgical	release	of	the	A1	pulley.	Study	measures	will	include	scar	assessment	based	on	the	Patient	and	Observer	Scar	Assessment	Scale	(POSAS)	administered	at	[ADDRESS_286985]-operatively,	overall	satisfaction	(scale	of	1	to	10),	days	before	return	to	work,	duration	of	post-operative	occupational	therapy,	pain	medication	use,	operative	time,	and	complication	and	recurrence	rates..

Statistical	Methods:		Sample	size	calculation:		Total	POSAS	scores	range	from	12	to	120.	Though	the	POSAS	has	not	been	used	to	assess	scarring	after	trigger	finger	release,	the	tool	is	validated	with	high	internal	consistency	and	reliability.1		A	total	of	24	patients	([ADDRESS_286989]	open	arm)	will	provide	sufficient	information	to	produce	descriptive	summaries	of	study	outcome	endpoints	and	to	perform	exploratory	analyses.

Conditions	that	may	warrant	termination	of	the	study	or	site	include,	but	are	not	limited	to:	• Discovery	of	an	unexpected,	serious,	or	unacceptable	risk	to	subjects	enrolled	in	the	study	• Failure	of	the	Investigator	to	comply	with	pertinent	national	or	state	regulations,	IRB	imposed	conditions,	or	protocol	requirements	• Submission	of	knowingly	false	information	from	the	Investigator	to	IRB,	or	any	regulatory	agency		[ADDRESS_287015]	any	complications	that	may	arise,	though	not	anticipated.

Version	5			20		11.1.1 ADVERSE	EVENT		An	adverse	event	(AE)	is	any	untoward	medical	occurrence	in	a	subject	that	does	not	necessarily	have	a	causal	relationship	with	the	treatment.	An	adverse	event	can	therefore	be	any	unfavorable	and	unintended	sign	(including	an	abnormal	laboratory	finding),	symptom,	or	temporal	disease,	whether	or	not	related	to	the	study	assessment(s)/questionnaire(s).		Pre-existing	disease	or	symptoms	thereof	prior	to	study	enrollment	are	not	considered	AEs	unless	the	condition	recurs	after	the	subject	has	recovered	from	the	pre-existing	condition,	or	the	condition	worsens	in	intensity	or	frequency	during	the	study.	Normal	post-operative	sequelae	will	not	be	recorded	as	adverse	events.	Specifically,	normal	post-operative	pain,	swelling,	tenderness,	loss	of	skin	sensation	and	ecchymosis	within	the	first	two	weeks	postoperative,	requiring	normal	levels	of	medication	will	not	be	recorded;	all	abnormal	intensity	or	duration	will	be	recorded	and	considered	an	adverse	event	as	well	as	following	the	two-week	post-operative	period.		Adverse	events	will	be	monitored	throughout	the	study.	At	each	post-baseline	visit,	the	Investigator	will	begin	querying	for	adverse	events	by	[CONTACT_237100]	a	general,	nondirected	question	such	as	“Have	you	had	any	changes	to	your	condition	since	your	last	visit?”	Previous	adverse	events	and	changes	in	therapy/concomitant	medications	should	be	updated.	Directed	questioning	and	examination	will	then	be	done	as	appropriate.	All	reported	adverse	events	will	be	documented.			11.1.2 SERIOUS	ADVERSE	EVENT		A	serious	adverse	event	(SAE)	is	defined	as	any	untoward	medical	occurrence	that	at	any	dose:		• results	in	death	• is	life-threatening		• requires	inpatient	hospi[INVESTIGATOR_201578]	• results	in	persistent	or	significant	disability/incapacity	• is	a	congenital	anomaly/birth	defect			Important	medical	events	that	may	not	result	in	death,	be	life-threatening,	or	require	hospi[INVESTIGATOR_237090],	based	upon	appropriate	medical	judgment,	they	may	jeopardize	the	subject	or	subject	and	may	require	medical	or	surgical	intervention	to	prevent	one	of	the	outcomes	listed	in	this	definition.

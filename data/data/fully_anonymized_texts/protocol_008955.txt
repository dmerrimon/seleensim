FAMLI Diagnostic Accuracy  Page 5 of 27 Protocol v1.3 | [ADDRESS_1205603] operating procedure UNC   University of North Carolina UNZA   University of Zambia US   Ultrasound UTH   University Teaching Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_864545] 6 of 27 Protocol v1.3 | 25 May 2023 PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background: Most of the world’s obstetrical providers do not have access to the diagnostic benefit of ultrasound because of the historically high cost of equipment and need for trained sonographers. We have developed a machine learning tool (“FAMLI Technology”) that can estimate fetal gestational age from a series of ultrasound blind sweeps collected by [CONTACT_864558] a low-cost, battery-powered device. Objectives:  The overall aim of this study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a machine learning algorithm in estimating gestational age in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The primary study outcome is diagnostic accuracy, measured as the difference in mean absolute error (MAE) of the FAMLI Technology and standard fetal biometry in the primary evaluation window.  Design:  This is a prospective cohort study of women enrolled early in pregnancy, with randomization to determine the timing of three follow-up visits in the second and third trimester. At each of these follow-up visits, we will assess gestational age with the FAMLI technology and compare that estimate to the known gestational age established early in pregnancy. We will also conduct standard ultrasound biometry measurements likewise assessing the accuracy of this approach. Our study design will allow precise characterization of the technology’s accuracy (against the previously established ground truth) and also allow head-to-head comparison of the FAMLI Technology to standard fetal biometry. Population:  [ADDRESS_1205604] a viable, singleton, intrauterine pregnancy.  Study Sites:  This study will be conducted in the antenatal clinics of the University Teaching Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (UTH) and the Kamwala District Health Centre in Lusaka, Zambia and the prenatal clinics of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Duration/Follow up: Participants will be enrolled over approximately one year and followed through delivery. The study is expected to take two years to complete.  Relevance:  Among the most critical benefits of obstetric sonography is its ability to measure anatomical structures within the fetus and from this, make an estimate of fetal gestational age. Obstetric care providers offer a well-established set of screening and preventative activities as pregnancy proceeds, and the timing of many of these relies upon accurate estimation of the GA. Given the importance of GA to guide appropriate clinical care, accurate measurement is critically necessary to improve pregnancy outcomes worldwide.   
 
FAMLI Diagnostic Accuracy  Page 7 of 27 Protocol v1.3 | [ADDRESS_1205605] of the world’s obstetrical providers do not have access to the diagnostic benefit of ultrasound. Without it, they are armed only with centuries-old physical exam techniques that do not provide sufficient diagnostic discrimination to identify and appropriately refer most high-risk cases. In 2018, our team received funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to generate data, engineering, and analytical solutions to contribute to the development of robust, inexpensive, ultrasound technologies that could be deployed in low-resource settings to improve obstetric diagnostics. The first phase of that project – the Fetal Age Machine Learning Initiative (FAMLI) protocol (UNZA BREC Ref 005-08-18, UNC IRB #18-1848) – has enrolled nearly 5,[ADDRESS_1205606] analyzed data from these participants and built a tool that can estimate gestational age (GA) from blindly obtained ultrasound sweeps of the gravid abdomen. This innovation takes advantage of two new technologies. The first is the miniaturization of medical ultrasound technology. Over the last decade, several low-cost, handheld, ultrasound devices have become available – many of which have obtained U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance and CE conformity marking in the European Union.1,2 The second new technology is the application of machine learning (ML) computer vision models for automated medical image interpretation.3,4 This protocol describes a diagnostic accuracy study to assess the performance of our new tool (hereinafter “FAMLI Technology”) in assessing gestational age. We will enroll 400 pregnant volunteers prior to 14 completed gestational weeks and obtain accurate “ground truth” GA dating with standard ultrasound biometry, using the crown-rump length. These participants will then be asked to return for three follow-up visits, which will include a routine sonogram performed by a trained sonographer and the collection of a set of blind sweep cineloop videos using a low-cost, battery-operated device. The research will be conducted in Chapel Hill, North Carolina (at the University of North Carolina Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491]/or sites associated with UNC OBGYN) and in Lusaka, Zambia (at the University Teaching Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_864546]). Approximately equal numbers of participants will be enrolled from each country.  NB: The primary purpose of this research is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the FAMLI Technology, a novel machine learning-based tool for gestational age assessment that can run on a smart phone or tablet. As such, we are not evaluating the performance of any ultrasound device and this protocol will only use ultrasound scanners that are approved for use in the participating countries. 2.[ADDRESS_1205607] all of these deaths occur in low-resource settings.5,6 Approximately 2.7 million neonates die per year,7 and an additional 2.6 million are stillborn.8 Early ascertainment of fetal gestational age is critical to good clinical management, as is detection of clinical obstetric conditions that put both mothers and fetuses at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Ultrasound improves GA estimation and can provide detailed

A notable exception includes in vitro fertilization (IVF), where we know the exact date of fertilization 
 
FAMLI Diagnostic Accuracy  Page 9 of 27 Protocol v1.3 | 25 May 2023 and thus the age of the embryo on the date of transfer to the uterus. Among women who monitor ovulation with luteinizing hormone (LH) test strips, we can estimate the date of conception within 1-[ADDRESS_1205610], which detects human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG) in the urine, typi[INVESTIGATOR_864548] 2 weeks after conception (i.e., 4 weeks GA by [CONTACT_559]).  Gestational age dating in settings where obstetric ultrasound is not routinely available relies primarily upon the LMP. This is typi[INVESTIGATOR_864549]. An estimated date of delivery (EDD) is assigned by [CONTACT_1583] 280 days (40 weeks) to the first day of the recalled LMP (Naegele’s rule).[ADDRESS_1205611] presentation to antenatal care is later in gestation.26 Indeed, data on over 100,000 pregnancies in Lusaka, Zambia indicate a median GA at presentation of 23 weeks.27 Further, data from our research site in Zambia suggests that participant recall is not only imprecise, but also may introduce bias (Figure 2).26 Gestational age can also be estimated by [CONTACT_864560], this approach is used to supplement – and occasionally overrule – estimate made by [CONTACT_228969]. The height of the uterine fundus (“fundal height”) is ascertained with a simple flexible tape measure (Figure 3) and is defined as the distance between the pubic symphysis and the uterine fundus. In the absence of uterine pathology (e.g., large leiomyoma) or fetal conditions that might cause the uterus to be unusually large (e.g., polyhydramnios, multiple gestation), the fundal height (in centimeters) roughly corresponds to the current gestational age (in weeks) once the uterus is palpable above the pubic bone.[ADDRESS_1205612] of care for GA estimation in settings where antenatal ultrasound (US) is available instead uses an algorithm known as the best obstetric estimate (BOE).[ADDRESS_1205613] antenatal visit or soon thereafter. The sonographer measures known fetal structures (“biometry”) which are used to estimate the fetal GA on the day of the ultrasound. The error associated with current biometry formulae (of which there are several29-32) increases with advancing GA.24 The BOE is calculated by [CONTACT_864561]. The reported LMP is used to estimate GA unless the ultrasound measurement 

 
FAMLI Diagnostic Accuracy  Page 10 of 27 Protocol v1.3 | 25 May 2023 differs by a predefined amount (Figure 4), in which case the US estimate is used. For women whose LMP is uncertain or unknown, the ultrasound estimate alone is used. Obstetrical providers generally do not change the estimated due date once it is set by [CONTACT_864562], since a subsequent ultrasound estimate is typi[INVESTIGATOR_864550].

Ultrasound procedures included documentation of fetal viability, pregnancy location, number of fetuses, fetal heart rate, fetal lie, and assessment of amniotic fluid volume. Measurements of gestational age-appropriate structures for fetal biometry (crown-rump length, abdominal circumference, head circumference, bi-parietal diameter, femur length, transcerebellar diameter) were each performed twice.  During the same examination, we also collected a series of blind sweep cineloop videos. These were free-hand sweeps, [ADDRESS_1205615] the maternal right either perpendicular (90 degrees) or angled (15 and 45 degrees) to the line of probe movement. Lateral sweeps were performed with the probe indicator facing superiorly, starting just above the pubis and sweepi[INVESTIGATOR_864551].

We compared the deep learning model estimates to biometry obtained by a trained sonographer on a commercial ultrasound (Figure 5). We also compared

We found that the model and biometry performed similarly: overall model mean absolute error (MAE) 4.9 days (standard error [SE] 0.29) versus biometry MAE 5.4 days (SE 0.28); difference -0.6 days (95% CI: 1.3, 0.1); p=0.11). However, when compared to LMP, the model was clearly superior: model MAE 4.9 days (SE 0.29) versus LMP MAE 17.4 days (SE 1.17); difference -12.7 days (95% CI: -15.0, -10.3); p<0.001). Based on the empi[INVESTIGATOR_864552], the proportion of study scans that were correctly classified within 7 days was substantially higher for the model than for LMP (71.9% vs 40.1%; difference 36.1% [95% CI 28.0%, 44.2%]; p<0.001). The model similarly outperformed LMP using a 14-day classification window (94.8% vs 55.1%; difference 40.5% [95% CI 33.9%, 47.1%]; p<0.001).

In North Carolina, we will advertise the study through flyers, posters, and other electronic or written materials. Study staff will approach potentially eligible women – either in groups or individually – to inform them about the study (including eligibility criteria). Staff will provide interested women with additional information and referrals to the study clinic for eligibility assessment. All protocol-specified ultrasound procedures will occur after 13 completed gestational weeks (i.e., 14 0/7 weeks or greater). To be eligible for study participation, women must have documentation of a baseline scan conducted by a trained sonographer prior to 14 weeks gestation to confirm pregnancy location, viability, and gestational age by [CONTACT_864568]-rump length.  After completing the study informed consent process, study staff will gather targeted information on demographics, health and risk behaviors, medical and obstetrical history, medication use, stress, and nutrition. Participants will undergo blood pressure assessment and anthropometry, including height, weight, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), and fundal height (FH).

For instance, the primary evaluation window comprises the 14-week period between 14 0/7 and 27 6/[ADDRESS_1205622] a 1 in 14 chance of being allocated to a given gestational week within the primary evaluation window (Table 2). A statistician not otherwise associated with the study will design the scheme and pre-generate the visit schedules for each participant prior to study commencement. Women will be allowed to choose their preferred day of participation within the randomized week.  Participants who are randomly allocated to a follow-up visit schedule who do not complete visit 1.0 for any reason (e.g., because they deliver prior to the target window or do not return for the visit) will count as screened but will not count toward the overall enrollment target of 400 participants.

An untrained operator will conduct blind sweep procedures using both a commercial ultrasound machine and an approved portable low-cost device. More than one low-cost device may be used for data collection. Next, the sonographer will perform full standard biometry procedures and additional protocol-related ultrasound sweeps using a commercial ultrasound machine. Finally, the trained sonographer will perform biometry and blind sweeps with the low-cost device. NB: The FAMLI Technology software will not be used to assess gestational age at the time of novice or trained sonographer assessment in an effort to avoid biasing sonographer data collection during biometry. We will also train sonographers not to ask participants their due date or last menstrual period prior to commencing the study scan. All participants will be followed through delivery.

A social harm will be defined as a non-medical untoward consequence of study participation, including: difficulties in personal relationships, stigma, or discrimination from family or community. An AE will be defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant including any abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), 
 
FAMLI Diagnostic Accuracy  Page 16 of 27 Protocol v1.3 | 25 May 2023 symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the individual’s participation in the research, whether considered related to participation in the research or not. In addition to events related to study procedures, which are expected to be very rare, we can expect that this population of pregnant women will experience adverse events unrelated to study procedures, including adverse obstetrical outcomes, infections, side effects from routine medications, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and death. We expect events to be minimal, but all will be documented, assessed for seriousness / severity and relatedness, and carefully monitored. The severity of study-related adverse events and social harms will be graded using the National Institute of Health’s Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events; this is standard of care for all studies conducted at our sites. We will also record information on all serious adverse events (SAEs) occurring in maternal participants whether or not they are related to study participation, including AEs that: 1. Result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] (unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_864554], i.e., for delivery) or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  2. Are immediately life-threatening,  3. Cause significant, persistent, or permanent harm or disability, either physical or psychological,  4. Result in death, including fetal demise after 20 weeks of gestation, or 5. Are congenital anomalies/birth defects. Information on adverse events or social harms that are related to the study and all SAEs will be documented on study data forms and routinely reported to the Principal Investigator (PI) or designee. If the PI, co-investigators, or their designees determine that study-related AEs are occurring at an unexpected rate, they will assess the need for and facilitate staff re-training, protocol amendment, or study cessation. Serious study-related AEs will be reported to all regulatory bodies and the study sponsors within 72 hours of site awareness. Other events will be reported according to each ethics committees’ individual guidelines.  6.5.1 Identification and management of clinical complications of pregnancy When collecting data or performing physical exams, study staff may identify medical or other issues requiring follow-up, treatment, or other clinical care. Similarly, during the course of performing ultrasound procedures on study participants, sonographers may identify medical issues requiring follow-up, treatment, or other clinical care. All team members will be trained on the recognition of adverse events and social harms and what to do if encountered. Safety issues requiring follow-up will be brought to the attention of the senior clinical staff, who will make referrals if the issue is beyond staff knowledge or skills to be able to adequately address.  Potential reasons for clinical referral include, but are not limited to:  - Draining of fluid or concern for ruptured membranes - Vaginal bleeding or concern for threatened abortion or antepartum hemorrhage - Abnormal vaginal discharge - Hypertension - Fetal anomalies - Abnormalities of fetal growth - Oligo- or polyhydramnios - Intrauterine embryonic or fetal demise

Biological samples (i.e., blood and urine) will be used for untargeted metabolomics and other multi-omic analyses to identify metabolites, proteins, transcripts, and host genetic factors associated with fetal maturation, gestational age, parturition timing, and adverse outcomes. Each study site will house its own biological samples and make plans for off-site redundancy in case of power failures or freezer malfunction. Lab testing will be conducted in parallel with the primary analysis and will take advantage of the excellent gestational age dating available for all participants and the even distribution of sample collection across the gestational age spectrum.  Use of stored specimens for testing that is not specifically designated in this protocol as described above will require additional regulatory approval. Separate written informed consent for specimen storage and future use will be specifically obtained during the informed consent process.  6.6.[ADDRESS_1205625] Operating Procedures (SOPs) following manufacturer’s protocols and detailing technical procedures involved (e.g., sample collection, processing, and storage) will be developed and used by [CONTACT_3476]. Site coordinators will complete annual recertification. The certification process is an opportunity to ensure the highest specimen quality and standardize collection techniques. 6.7 Data security and management Research data will be captured in a dedicated study database. Study data management (e.g., data transmission, query resolution, etc.) will follow procedures outlined in study SOPs. Study identification numbers will be used on all forms and communications related to the study. A separate confidential register will link study identification numbers and participants’ names.

FAMLI Diagnostic Accuracy  Page 18 of 27 Protocol v1.3 | 25 May 2023 6.8 Statistical considerations 6.8.1 Study outcomes The primary study outcome is diagnostic accuracy, measured as difference in mean absolute error (MAE) of the index test and clinical reference standard in the primary evaluation window. MAEs will be calculated as the average of the absolute differences between the GA estimated by [CONTACT_864571] (i.e., the FAMLI Technology interpreting blind sweep data generated by [CONTACT_864572] a low-cost probe) or clinical reference standard (i.e., standard fetal biometry performed by a trained sonographer on a commercial ultrasound machine) and previously established ground truth GA.  Secondary study outcomes will be assessed for both the index test and clinical reference standard and include (1) MAE in the secondary evaluation windows; (2) root mean squared error (RMSE) in all three evaluation windows; and (3) proportion of studies correctly classified within [ADDRESS_1205626] a non-inferiority hypothesis, such that if we observe a 95% confidence interval (CI) to be completely contained in the interval (-c, c) then we declare non-inferiority (or equivalence to bound c), with type 1 error 2.5%. We chose a sample size such that the statistical power for the non-inferiority hypothesis test is 95%. One implication of choosing the above type [ADDRESS_1205627] is that, if we observe the 95% CI to not be contained in the interval (-c, c), i.e., the lower end of the observed 95% CI is smaller than -c or the upper end is larger than c, then we may declare superiority, with type 1 error 5%, because the null hypothesis for superiority (i.e., a 0-difference) would be excluded from this observed 95% CI. We used Monte Carlo simulation to find the sample size that yields a statistical power of at least 95% for the non-inferiority test with type 1 error of 2.5%, and non-inferiority bound of c = [ADDRESS_1205628] is based on a difference in mean absolute error (MAE), comparing the FAMLI Technology to standard biometry, with both approaches measured in the primary evaluation window, which is between 14 0/7 and 27 6/7 weeks of gestation, inclusive (Figure 6). We chose this window for our primary evaluation because it corresponds to the second trimester of pregnancy, when most women

Both the FAMLI Technology-estimated GA and standard biometry calculate absolute error with respect to the enrollment “ground truth” estimated GA, which is assigned by [CONTACT_864573], in the case of in vitro fertilization, a known embryo age and transfer date.  We used women enrolled in the ZAPPS cohort with estimated GA < 13 weeks (n = 105) to inform the distribution of enrollment GAs, and another ZAPPS estimated GA measured in the [ADDRESS_1205630] biometry (intergrowth formula) was 74.5 ± 10.[ADDRESS_1205631] biometry (Intergrowth formula), was 155.4 ± 6.1 days, and after adjustment (subtracting the number of days between enrollment and primary evaluation) was 75.6 ± 12.3 days. The observed regression function for the adjusted estimated GA during the primary evaluation window was -7 + 1.1 (enrollment estimated GA) ± 4 days. Estimates below are based on 2000 simulations, which yields simulation error less than 2% for statistical power. We assume the GA estimate produced by [CONTACT_864574] (i.e., intercept and slope) similar to standard biometry, but reduces the random error (τ). In a sensitivity analysis, we assumed the FAMLI Technology estimate also removed bias (i.e., intercept 0, slope 1), which yields a slight increase in power (results not shown). We do not anticipate that the FAMLI Technology will induce bias over the standard approach. We vary the random error τ for the FAMLI Technology from τ = 1 to 5, where τ = 4 days is the superiority null hypothesis of no difference between approaches. Figure 8 shows the statistical power for non-inferiority as a function of the difference in absolute error between approaches (in days) and sample size. A horizontal reference line is drawn at 95% power. Under our assumptions, at a [ADDRESS_1205632] power in excess of 95%.  Figure 9 shows the statistical power for superiority as a function of the difference in absolute error between approaches (in days) and sample size. At the null hypothesis of 0 difference, the statistical power is approximately 5%, regardless of sample size (i.e., this is a valid statistical test). At a -0.5-day difference in absolute error (i.e., the FAMLI Technology estimated GA reduces random error by 1/[ADDRESS_1205633] approach), a sample size of 200 has less than 60% power, while a sample size of 400 has 80% power. Figure 10 shows the expected 95% CI as a function of the difference in absolute error between approaches (in days) and sample size.  8:

Then, for each approach, we will calculate the estimated GA and the difference between this estimate and the reference value. In a primary analysis, we will compare the mean absolute errors for the different approaches. The approach with smaller mean absolute error is preferred. In secondary analyses, we will compare the root mean squared errors for the different approaches.  Because approaches are conducted on all women, comparisons of approaches are naturally controlled for all possible time fixed confounding factors. To account for differential loss to follow up, if loss to follow up exceeds 9%, and possible resultant selection bias, we will employ inverse probability of censoring weights.3 Censoring weights will be estimated using a pooled logistic regression model fit by [CONTACT_54683].4 Continuous covariates will be included using restricted quadratic splines.5 6.9 Dissemination of findings Study findings will be disseminated through appropriate local channels, including academic and public health research symposia. One or more publications will also be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. The study participants’ privacy and confidentiality will be strictly maintained in all results dissemination or publication activities. Sharing of data generated by [CONTACT_864576]. The findings of this study will be made available through appropriate local channels, including academic and public health research symposia. We will make results available to the community of scientists interested in maternal and child health to avoid unintentional duplication of research. Presentations at national scientific meetings. It is expected that several national meeting audiences would be interested in the findings generated by [CONTACT_864577]. We plan to present findings at the annual meeting of the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine, the annual meeting of Pediatric Academic Societies, and the International Conference on Maternal and Child Healthcare.  Access to data. This research will enroll 400 participants, each of whom will attend 3 follow-up visits in pregnancy (i.e., up to 1,200 research ultrasound scans performed). In addition to ultrasound data, the final study dataset will include a limited amount of demographic and behavioral data, medical history, pregnancy outcome, and physical exam findings. We will make de-identified data and associated documentation available to users only under a data-sharing agreement that binds the user to: (1) using the data for research purposes; (2) securing the data with appropriate technology; (3) destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed; (4) making appropriate attribution to data provenance; and (5) ensuring the Gates Foundation Global Access requirements are met.  7.0 Ethical Considerations The protocol, informed consent documents, and any subsequent modifications will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_864578] (FWA) with the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) approval. For this study, relevant ethics committees include the 
 
FAMLI Diagnostic Accuracy  Page 22 of 27 Protocol v1.3 | [ADDRESS_1205636] patient confidentiality. Where possible, a private room will be used to discuss the study and potential participant’s eligibility. If a private room is not available, a designated area far enough away from other participants such that they cannot hear the conversation will be used. Study staff will obtain written informed consent from all participants. The study procedures, risks, and benefits will be discussed, and the responsible staff member will answer all questions prior to obtaining consent. The consent forms will be translated into local languages and back-translated into English to ensure accurate translation. All versions of the consent forms will be approved by [CONTACT_117637]. For illiterate participants, a literate impartial witness will be present during the entire consent process to ensure that all of the relevant information has been provided and the participant voluntarily gives consent.  Eligible women who do not wish to participate in this study will continue to receive antenatal care and treatment according to local clinical standards.   7.[ADDRESS_1205637] not found any dangerous risks.  Physical risks also include the risk of discomfort, bruising or swelling from venipuncture. The risks that are associated with venipuncture are infrequent and minimized with the use of proper technique. Such risks include (1) bleeding, (2) bruising, or (3) rarely infection at the site of needle insertion. Individuals may also rarely become faint, in which case symptoms abate after several minutes in a recumbent position. Blood volumes for the study have been calculated to ensure safety and participants will be reassured that such feelings are transient. Participation in clinical research includes the risks of loss of confidentiality and discomfort with the personal nature of questions, particularly when discussing HIV infection or sexual behaviors. At each step in the study, we will protect participant privacy and confidentiality to reduce these risks (e.g., consenting participants in a private setting, not including names on case report forms, etc.). Although investigators make every effort to protect participant privacy and confidentiality, it is possible that participant involvement in the study could become known to others, and that social harms may result.

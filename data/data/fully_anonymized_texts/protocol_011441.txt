subjects will indicate greater pain tolerance to a heat stimulus  following  a single 20-minute session of 
anodal vs. cathodal tDCS (compared to sham tDCS). This study will also test whether providing one of 
four cognitive pain -managament interventions (conducted during the tDCS session) will result in even 
greater pain tolerance among subjects who also received tDCS  . 
 
B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE_________________________________________________________  
Briefly sketch the background leading to the present application, critically evaluate existing knowledge, and specifically identify the gaps that the project is intended to fill. State concisely the importance and health relevance of the research described in this protocol  by [CONTACT_9372], long-term 
objectives . If the aims of the study  are achieved, state how scientific knowledge or clinical practice will be 
advanced.  
 
Recently, the use of low amplitude direct current stimulation of the human cortex has received attention 
as a possible treatment for pain (Been et al, 2007). This technique (called transcranial direct current  
stimulation or tDCS) involves the placement of two sponge electrodes over separate areas of the scalp. tDCS has been shown to be capable of changing the excitability of the superficial neurons immediately Medical University of South Carolina

Version 11                         Version Date: 7/18/2016  beneath the sponge electrodes. Evidence suggests that anodal stimulation is associated with increased 
cortical excitability and cathodal stimulation is associated with decreased cortical excitability (Been et al, 
2007). The electrodes can therefore be placed on the scalp according to the desired part of t he cortex 
with which to excite.  
Across experimental and clinical studies, investigators have demonstrated the analgesic effects that tDCS can have in the experience of pain (see Fregni et al., 2007 for a review). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is one area of the brain that may be particularly relevant in using tDCS to reduce perceived 
pain and increase pain tolerance. For example, in a study of patients who had undergone ERCP surgery (Borckardt et al., 2011a), there was a significant decrease in  reported pain scores and in medication use 
among the patients who received tDCS. The dlPFC appears to affect emotional aspects of the pain experience and one’s perceived controllability of pain (Boggio et al., 2008; Borckardt et al., 2011b), and this may be one way that tDCS affects changes in pain perceptions when anode currents are directed at 
the dlPFC.  
There is also extensive research to support the use of cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) in the treatment 
of pain conditions (e.g., Chen et al., 2004; McCracken & Turk, 2002; Morley et al., 1999). It is well 
established that CBT is effective in greatly reducing the suffering that patien ts with chronic pain endure. 
There are three main elements to CBT for chronic pain, which include education about how emotions and behaviors can affect one’s experience of pain, training in copi[INVESTIGATOR_589472] (including both behavioral and cognitive strategies), and assistance in the maintenance of those copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262] (Kerns et al., 2011). Providing accurate information about one’s pain experience 
and training individuals to think about their pain experience in a different way is one relevant aspect of 
pain treatment that may relate to activity of the prefrontal cortex.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_589473], many individuals still do 
not benefit from this kind of intervention (Kerns et al., 2011), and it is possible that the use of tDCS over 
the dlPFC may enhance the potential benefit of cognitive interventions in treating pain. The goal of this 
study is to investigate how both tDCS and a brief cognitive intervention affect pain tolerance in an 
experimental setting, and specifically whether the combination of tDCS and a cognitive intervention w ill 
enhance pain tolerance. Ultimately, we hope our results will further support the use of tDCS for 
therapeutic applications in the area of pain management, as well as provide initial evidence of its benefit 
in combination with cognitive -based treatments for pain that are already in use.  
C. PRELIMINARY STUDIES___________________________________________________________________  
Provide an account of the principal investigator’s preliminary studies pertinent to this protocol  and/or any other 
information that will help to establish the experience and competence of the investigator to pursue the proposed 
project.  
 
The investigators have conducted multiple studies using tDCS technology that have already 
demonstrated the benefit of tDCS in increasing pain toleranc e and threshold (see Borckardt et al., 2011a, 
2011b as examples). The proposed study will be the first to combine tDCS and a cognitive intervention 
element, although we expect no complications or safety issues with our use of tDCS or cognitive 
intervention for pain in this study.

Version 11                         Version Date: 7/18/2016   
 
PARTICIPANTS:  
Subjects will be 360 healthy adult volunteers. Subjects will be between the ages of 18  years and 75 years 
recruited from the greater Charleston area via flyers and newspaper adverti sements. Subjects will be paid 
for their participation.  
Laboratory Pain Assessment:  
Participants will undergo quantitative sensory testing to measure pain threshold.  Ten randomly ordered 
warming (5) and cooling (5) sequences will be administered with varia ble (2 -10 sec random) lead times 
and a warm/cool rate of 0.2º C per sec until the subject indicates that a temperature change was 
perceived. THERMAL PAIN THRESHOLD ASSESSMENT: Cutaneous heat and cold stimuli will be delivered via a Contact [CONTACT_589479] -Evoked Potential Stimulator (CHEPS; Medoc, [LOCATION_003]) attached to the volar 
forearm of each subjects left arm. The Method of Limits will be used. The thermode will heat/cool at a rate of 0.5º C per second until the subject indicates that pain was perceived. The procedure w ill be repeated 10 
times (5 hot and 5 cold) and mean values will be used. THERMAL PAIN MAGNITUDE ESTIMATION: Twelve separate 2 -second thermal stimuli (4 stimuli each at 46º, 47.5º, 49º C; randomlized) will be applied to each 
subject’s left volar forearm. The target temperature will be sustained for 2 seconds and the thermode will 
immediately cool to 32º C. After termination of each stimulus, subjects will rate both the intensity and the 
unpleasantness of the stimulus using the computerized VAS. THERMAL WIND -UP PAIN ESTIMATION: The 
CHEPS will be used to deliver 20 very brief noxious thermal stimuli to the left volar forearm of subjects at 
the rate of 1 stimulus (0.75 sec duration) every 1.5 seconds (at 49ºC) thus facilitating C -fiber activation 
and receptive field expansion of the WDR neurons in the dorsal horn. Subjects will continuously indicate 
level of pain intensity using a dynamic computerized VAS. MECHANICAL PAIN THRESHOLD 
ASSESSMENT: The IITC Life Sciences Digital Anesthesiometer will be used to apply pressure to the 
dorsal surface of the distal phalange of the digiti minimi of the left hand. Pressure will be increased at the 
rate of 10 grams per second. Participants will stop the stimulus when pressure reaches the pain 
threshold and the pressure will be recorded in grams.  
 
tDCS:  
A single 20 -minute tDCS session will be conducted with the Phoresor -II Auto (Model PM850, Iomed, Salt 
Lake City Utah, [LOCATION_003]) using 2.0mA current. Electrodes will be 4x4 cm sponge electrodes soaked in sterile 
saline.  The anode will be placed over the left prefrontal cortex (F3 from the EEG 10- 20 system) located 
via the Beam F3 measurement system. The cathode will be attached to the right shoulder. For sham tDCS, 
cathode to anode stimulation will be for the duration of the 20 -minute session. The current density and 
total charge delivered by [CONTACT_589480].  Participants will be given vitamin -E cream to apply to the scalp following 
tDCS to reduce possible skin irritation. 
 
 
STUDY DESIGN  AND PROCEDURES : 
Interested participants will call and be pre-screened on the telephone. If interested participants meet the 
inclusion criteria they will be scheduled for one appointment (lasting approximately 1 hour). U pon coming 
to the Brain Stimulation Laboratory for the appointment, participants will review and sig n the informed 
consent document. Written informed -consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_589481]. Participants will com plete the Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_2557] 10 -item depression 
scale (CESD), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Reiss -Epstein -Gursky A.S.I., and the Brief Pain 
Inventory (BPI).   
 After completing the initial questionnaires they will be  taken to the lab oratory where they will undergo five 
trials of the heat tolerance laboratory pain test. The  tDCS electrodes will then be placed and fastened with 
Velcro straps, and the tDCS session will be started. During the tDCS stimulation, participants will undergo the cognitive or educational component of the study as well as pain tolerance assessment procedures 
every 5 minutes. Patients will randomly receive one of four cognitive behavioral therapy interventions 
administered through headphones so that the research staff can remain blind. The four cognitive behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_589474] -Catastrophizing Cognitive Intervention, Cognitive -Behavioral 
Distraction Intervention, Cognitively -Mediated Relaxation Intervention, Education -Only Control Condition.

Version 11                         Version Date: 7/18/2016  After completion of the tDCS session, participants will again undergo five consecutive trials of the 
quantitative sensory testing.   
 
At the completion of each appointment participants will be assessed for adverse effects of the 
stimulation, and they will be asked if th ey think they received real or fake stimulation and will rate how 
confident they are in their answer using a 0- 10 scale (0= guessing 10= absolutely sure).  Participants will 
also be asked to complete a short supplemental form at the end of the appointment.  Participants will also 
be compensated $40 in cash at that time for their participation in the study.  
 
ANALYSIS:  
 3 variable MANCOVA will be used to investigate whether change scores (from pre- to post - 
stimulation) in pain tolerance ratings (i.e., the temp erature that participants were no longer able to 
tolerate the heat stimulus) are significantly affected by [CONTACT_589482]. Anodal, Cathodal, and Sham 
stimulation will be randomly paired with one of the four cognitive behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Both the stimulation and cognitive behavioral therapy will be run through a randomized computer system so as to 
maintain blinding. A 4X3X2 [CBT group BY [CONTACT_589483] (pre -post)] mixed multiple analysis of 
covariance (MANCOVA) will be conducted with the multipl e QST values as dependent measures and while 
controlling for physiological indices across phases (pre - and post -intervention. Gender, age, and race will 
be controlled in all analyses, although specific demographic variable differences are not expected for the 
present study. Scores on initial tests (i.e., CESD, BAI, and BPI) may also be examined as control variables

5.  SUBJECT SAFETY AND MINIMIZING RISKS (Data and Safety Monitoring Plan)  
 Studies that involve *clinical trials (see description below) must include a description of the plan for subject safety and minimizing risks of the research, including data monitoring and adverse event reporting to ensure the safety of subjects. The complexity of the plan should be determined by [CONTACT_9379]. The plan should 
specify: 1) what will be monitored, 2) how frequently the monitoring will occur, 3) who will be responsible for the 
monitoring, and 4) study endpoints.  
 Participants will be carefully monitored for the entirety of the study. Any adverse events will be recorded and reviewed by [CONTACT_978].  Applicable cases will be reported to the IRB according to the IRB policy.  This data 
will also be used to further establish the safety profile of tDCS in the current research literature.  
 *Clinical Trials  
A clinical trial is a prospective biomedical or behavioral research study of human subjects that is designed to 
answer specific questions about biomedical or behavioral interventions (drugs, treatments, devices, or new ways of using known drugs, treatments, or devices).  
Clinical trials are used to determine whether new biomedical or behavioral interventions are safe, efficacious, and 
effective.  Behavioral human subjects research involving an intervention to modify behavior (diet, physical activity, 
cognitive therapy, etc.) fits these criteria of a clinica l trial.  Human subjects research to develop or evaluate clinical 
laboratory tests (e.g. imaging or molecular diagnostic tests) might be considered to be a clinical trial if the test will 
be used for medical decision- making for the subject or the test itself imposes more than minimal risk for subjects.

 PROSPECTIVE BIOMARKER S OF BONE METABOLISM  IN HEMOPHILIA A 
 
Hypothesis  
Hemophilia is associated with decreased skeletal health. We hypothesize biomarkers of bone disease in 
hemophilia A will normalize with factor  VIII (FVIII) replacement . 
 
Introduction  
The landscape of hemophilia treatment has changed dramatically over the last several decades.  
We are now in an era where safe factor replacement is widely available for preventing and treating 
bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  Rates of HIV and HCV are essentia lly absen t in those less than 28  years of age .  
Furthermore people with hemophilia (PwH)  have a normal life expectancy 1.  The focus of hemophilia 
management must now turn to addressing long -term complications of this condition 1,2.  Unfortunately 
PwH are seldom screened for decreased bone mineral density (BMD ) despi[INVESTIGATOR_900646].   
Decreased BMD  and increased risk for fractures has been identified in PwH .  Studies in adults 
showed 70% of patients have low BMD, over 40% had osteopenia and 27% had osteoporosis 3,4. Several 
studies have  demonstrate d that childre n with hemophilia h ave significantly lower bone density than age 
matched control populations  5-7.  All of t hese studies included patients with HIV and HCV infections and 
patients had v arying deg rees of hemophilic arthropathy; all of which are risk factors for decreased BMD  
5,8, 9.  Thus it has been  generally believed that decreased skeletal health in PwH  is secondary to the risk 
factors of hema rthroses, chronic disease and im mobility.   
 Using a FVIII -deficient mouse model  we have recently demonstrated that decreased skeletal 
health is independent of these risk factors  and that bone disease is  intrinsic to FVIII defici ency10.  As 
shown in Table 1 , 20-week old (the age of peak bone mass) mice have decreased BMD  and 
biomechanical strength compared to wild -type control. In a subsequent  study we demonstrated through 
quantit ative histology ( histomorphometry ) that the difference is caused by [CONTACT_900650]11 (data not shown) .

 We demonstrated no differences in markers of bone formation (osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase) nor 
in a key regulatory pathway  of bone metabolism  (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa -B ligand 
[RANKL ] and osteoprotegerin [OPG ] (figure 1 ) between the FVIII -deficient and wild -type mice .  We did 
however identify differences in cytokine production, with decreased interferon - and interleuki n-1 in 
the FVIII -deficient compared to wild -type 
mice  (data not shown) . 
 Based in part on  these finding s Baxter 
Bioscience funded a retrospective study  
investigating  the bone biomarkers of PwH 
from  the biorepository at the University 
of Colorado.  We evaluate d the bone 
biomarkers of 79 m ales with severe 
Hemophila A, 20 males with severe 
Hemophilia B and 51 healthy male 
controls . The results of the study were 
presented at the American Society of 
Hematology meeting in December 2013  
in poster form (please see the Appendix 
for the full poster).  There were several 
key findings in our study. First, 
biomarkers of bone disease were 
markedly different  in individuals  with 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_480263] (<16 years of age) 
compared to  developed bone (age 1 6+) for both healthy controls and individu als with hemophilia A.  
There was increased CTX -1, a biomarker for increased bone resorption, in individuals with hemophilia A 
and mature bone compar ed to control.  Finally , samples with factor replacement the day prior had

RANK receptor induces the proliferation and 
differentiation of osteoclasts resulting in increased bone 
resorption. OPG competitively inhibits RANKL binding 
to RANK, blocking these osteoclastic effe cts. CTX -[ADDRESS_1263069] marker of bone resorption.

 increased OPG (Figure 2) and normalized CTX -1 (Figure 3) compared to controls. These result s suggest 
that factor replacement ameliorates bone disease in hemophilia A.  Supporting the cl inical significance of 
this study , an additional  study demons trated a correlation between bone biomarkers and BMD in 
individuals with hemop hilia A12. 
Preliminary (unpublished) data  
Since the American Society of Hematology annual meeting additional data has been obtained  
from the biorepository samples .  We found no  difference in osteocalcin (a biomarker for bone formation)  
between the various groups . Several cytokines are known to play a significant role  bone metabolism 
(Table 2).  Using a multiplex system we simultaneously measured the  plasma levels of key  cytokine s 
including: IFN, TNF, MSCF, IL -10, IL6, IL-12, IL-17, IL-1, IL-1. There was significant decrease 
in IL-10, IL -12 and TNF  in the plasma of patients with hemophilia A compared to controls (P < .0 1), 
which normalized  with recent factor infusion .  Since  IL-10 and IL -12 hav e opposing effects on osteoclas t 
function compared to TNF  it is difficult to interpret the  results .   Further evaluation of how cytokines 
vary with factor use and other variables in hemophilia is needed .

demonstrated in the figure, the fracture rate in PwH also increased with age. Subjects with hemophilia A 
and hemophilia B had similar fracture rates (23.[ADDRESS_1263072] years ).  This study 
demonstrates that PwH have an increased risk of fracture comp ared to the general population and that the  
issue of bone health will increase in importance as the PwH population ages.  
 
 
Specific Aim  
1.  Characterize the impact of F VIII replacement on the leve ls of biomarkers of bone metabolism  in 
subjects with severe Hemophilia A . 
2. Correlate the levels of biomarkers of bone metabolism with subject  history , physical examination  and 
bone mineral density .  
 
Study Design  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_900647] u p to 20 
hemophilia A subjects.  Subjects  will be recruited over 1 year for the  5-day protocol.  
 
Following a 72 -hour washout period , factor levels  and bone biomarkers  will be followed before and after 
50 units/kg replacement on Day 1 and 20 units/kg  replacement on Day 3.  Each subject can serve as their  
Figure 4. Fracture rates in PwH compared to historic c ontrols . 
 

Page 5 of 10 / Vers ion: [ADDRESS_1263073] s will also under go two DEXA  scans (spi[INVESTIGATOR_20793] h ip) and answer several survey 
questions about their  history and factor use.    
 
Recruitment Methods  
Subjects who are currently using any factor FVIII replacement therapy will be recruited from the 
Hemophilia Center at Oregon Health & Science University . Subject s will be approached during a 
scheduled clinic visit , via email or over the phone and a research visit will be scheduled.    
 
The age  of bone maturation depends on  what criteria used but generally occur occurs around 16 years of 
age15.  Biomarkers of bone metabolism d isplay a significant difference  during development compared to 
bone that is more mature (Figure 2 -3).  To verify that 16 years is an appropriate cutoff age to compare 
biomarkers in the hemophilia A population subanalysis CTX -1 levels from biorepository data  was 
performed.  CTX -1 showed significant different between plasma samples in subjects > 16 compared to < 
16 (Figure 3).  Furthermore to  prevent potential  confound ing effects of recent factor replacement samples 
from subjects that received factor replacement  the day prior were removed from this analysis. There  was a 
highly significant statistical diffe rence in CTX -1 plasma concentration in the severe hemophilia A 
population comparing 14 -15 to 16 -17 year old subjects ( p = 0.009), while there was no stat istical 
difference in CTX -[ADDRESS_1263074] a 
72-hour wash out.

Blood draws  
As outlined in Table 2, time points for blood draws include: time  0, 0.5, 4, 24,  48, 48.5, 72, and 96 hours. 
At each time point two tubes of citrated blood will be drawn.  One tube will be sent to the clinical 
laboratory to determine FVIII levels. The second tube will be centrifuged to obtain platelet poor plasma, 
divid ed into 400  l aliquots and placed into a -[ADDRESS_1263076] tube will be drawn at time 0  to mea sure Vitamin D and C -reactive protein . FVIII inhibitor assay , von 
Willebrand  Factor  (vWF) antigen, and vWF  activity  will also be performed at the time 0  timepoint . 
 
Bone biomarker a ssays to be run at each timepoint  include : OPG and RANKL  (see Figure 1); CTX -1 and 
TRAP 5b  (markers of bone resorption) ; osteocalcin and  bone -specific alkaline pho sphatase  (markers of 
bone formation); and cytokine multiplex  (see Table 2 and P reliminary D ata). 
 
Factor infusion  
ADV ATE  [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), P lasma/Albumin -Free Method] is an antihemophilic 
factor approved by [CONTACT_53010] & Drug Administration for co ntrol and prevention of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_900648] A.  Subjects who are currently using any factor VIII replacement 
therapy  will be eligible for enrollment in this study.  Subjects will receive ADVATE on Day 1 Hour 0 at a 
dose of 50 units/kg  replacement.  Subjects will subsequently receive ADVATE on Day 3 Hour 0 at a dose 
of 20 units/kg f actor replacement.  The participants in this study are have all seen exogenous factor VIII 
previously and data demonstrates that in this popula tion the risk of these serious side effects, especially in 
a short term study is <1%.”  
 
Two separate factor dosing levels will be used to help determine dose response of biomarkers to factor 
replacement and assess the level of factor replacement needed for  normalization of biomarkers

2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted?
BOTOX was first approved for aesthetic treatment of glabellar lines in 2001, lateral canthal lines (crow's 
feet lines) in 2013, and forehead lines in 2017.  BOTOX is one of the most common nonsurgical 
procedures in aesthetic medicine1.
 the medical literature has described the use of BOTOX to improve the 
appearance of th e lower face and neck .  Numerous publications specifically report the use of BOTOX to 
improve the appearance of the lower face by [CONTACT_471460]. 
The platysma muscle complex is composed of [ADDRESS_604321] over both sides of the neck, crossing over the 
mandibular border and inserting into the ove rlying skin of the neck and lower face.  When relaxed, the 
platysma muscle smoothly drapes the jawline, neck, and clavicle to create a firm, fitted, and uniform 
appearance ( Figure 1).

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013]. 
Allergan sponsored a Phase 2 study (1936 -201-008) designed to evaluate BOTOX for the treatment of 
platysma prominence.  This was a 4 -month, multicenter, ran domized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
dose -ranging study, comparing the efficacy and safety between a single treatment of BOTOX high dose 
 or BOTOX low dose  versus placebo in 171 subjects with moderate to severe 
platysma promi nence.
Subjects were adults ≥[ADDRESS_604322] using 
Allergan's platysma prominence scales.  Subjects were excluded from the study if 
had increased medical risk with exposure to BOTOX.  Subjects received a single treatment at baseline 
(Day 1) and were followed for approximately 120 days.
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, ≥ 1-grad e improvement from baseline in platysma 
prominence severity at Day 14, assessed independently by [CONTACT_368857]
(C-APPS )and Participant Allergan Platysma Prominence Scale (P-APPS ), respectively, were achieved.  
Both high and low dose BOTOX results were statistically significant compared with placebo (p <0.0001).  
Similar results were observed with other study endpoints, which included patient reported outcome 
(PRO) measures , corroborati ng the C -APPS and P -APPS data.  
The safety profile observed was consistent with that reported in the medical literature and with the 
known pharmacological effects of BOTOX.  The most frequently reported AEs related to the study 
procedure were balanced acro ss all treatment groups and included injection site hemorrhage (6/169, 
3.6%) and injection site bruising (11/169, 6.5%).   
 
 
 
While [COMPANY_013] does not consider coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) to be a safety concern for BOTOX 
due to its mechanism of action and route of administration, the sponsor is monitoring COVID -19 events 
durin g the pandemic closely. A recent review of COVID -19 events for the periodic safety update report 
(PSUR)  did not identify any new or significant 
safety findings for the subjects receiving BOTOX treatment. Overall, the clinical course and presentation 
of patients with COVID -19 infection coincident with BOTOX is consistent with what has been described 
for the general population.
Considering the COVID -19 pandemic, based on the limited information to date, no additional risk to 
study participants is anticipated with the use of BOTOX.
For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data in the current 
BOTOX Investigator's Brochure.

3.1 Objectives, Hypotheses , and Estimands
The study objective is to compare the safety and efficacy of BOTOX with placebo for the treatment of 
platysma prominence in adult subjects with moderate to severe platysma prominence at maximum 
contraction.
The clinical hypothesis is that B OTOX is a safe and effective treatment for the temporary improvement 
in the appearance associated with moderate tosevere platysma prominence in adults.
Estimands: Primary Endpoints
The attributes of the estimands corresponding to the primary efficacy endp oints are summarized in

Possible distant spread of toxin (PDSOT) is defined as a possible pharmacologic effect of botulinum toxin 
at sites noncontiguous and distan t from the site of injection.  Utilizing a standardized methodology to 
assess for PDSOT, Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities PTs that may be associated with 
botulinum toxin effects have been prospectively identified  
 
7STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans

analyses will be performed with subjects analyzed by [CONTACT_368860].  The Safety 
Analysis Set will be used for all safety analyses.
7.3 Handling Potential Intercu rrent Events for the Primary and 
Secondary Endpoints
The primary composite endpoint for the FDA and the coprimary endpoint for the EU regulatory agencies 
(defined in Section 3.2) will be analyzed based on the ITT population and the mITT population, 
respectively, and the following methods will be used to address potential intercurrent events:
Subjects who did not receive any dose of study drug but are randomized will still be included in 
the ITT population.  
Subjects who are randomized but prematurely discontinued the study before assessment of the 
primary endpoints will be considered as part of the ITT population.  
 
Subjects who die bef ore assessment of the primary endpoint will count as though they 
hypothetically continued in the study.
Subjects who are lost to follow -up and are missing data for the primary endpoint will count as 
though they hypothetically continued in the study.
Subjec ts who are missing assessments or data due to the COVID -19 pandemic and are missing 
data for the primary composite or coprimary endpoints will count as though they hypothetically 
continued in the study.
Subjects who are missing data for any other reason fo r the primary endpoint will count as 
though they hypothetically continued in the study.
The efficacy analysis of secondary endpoints (defined in Section 3.3) will be analyzed based on the same 
populations as above with similar methods for addressing potential intercurrent events.
Missing values will be imputed per the below.
Missing data will be imputed using the following methods for the efficacy analyses:
Multiple Imputation:  The Multiple Imputation approach will be used as a primary analysis for 
the primary endpoint, as well as for all secondary endpoints.  For the primary endpoint (US: 
compos ite endpoint; EU: coprimary endpoints) and the primary measure through Day 120,

7.8 Sample Size Determination
Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized into the study in a 1:1 ratio yielding approximately 
200 subjects in the BOTOX group and 200 subjects in the placebo group in the treatment period.  
 
For the US FDA primary analysis, an estimated sample size of 360 subjects will give a power of greater 
than 99% to detect a difference in responder rates between the BOTOX and placebo groups, assum ing a 
10% dropout rate by [CONTACT_2006] 14. 
 
 
The primary analysis for EU regulatory agencies only will be perfor med on the mITT population,  
  
a sample size of 180 will 
result in a power of greater than 99% to detect a difference between BOTOX and placebo in the 
proportion of subjects achieving at least a 2 -grade improvement from baseline according to both 
investigator's assessment using C -APPS and subject's self- assessment using P -APPS at maximum 
contraction at Day [ADDRESS_604346] of independent proportions, as implemented in the commercial software nQuery

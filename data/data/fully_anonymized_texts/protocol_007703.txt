6 1. Synopsis Protocol Title: Efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine for Post-exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) to Prevent Severe Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7531] 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection Among Adults Exposed to Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): A blinded, Randomized Study Short Title: Hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 PEP Rationale: Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is defined as taking antimicrobial medication after being exposed or potentially exposed to an infectious agent to prevent becoming infected. PEP is routinely used for prevention of a variety of viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections, including influenza and human immunodeficiency virus. Based on experience with PEP for other infections, therapy should be started as soon as possible after a recent possible exposure. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is currently approved for the suppressive treatment and treatment of acute attacks of malaria due to several Plasmodium strains. It is also indicated for the treatment of discoid and systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. With the first Food and Drug Administration approval in 1955, safety and tolerability of HCQ are well described. In vitro, HCQ displays antiviral activity against coronaviruses, including severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Pharmacologic modeling based on observed drug concentrations and in vitro drug testing suggest that prophylaxis at approved doses could prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or ameliorate viral shedding. Clinical trials of HCQ treatment for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia are underway in China under separate protocol(s). Objectives and Endpoints: Objectives Endpoints Primary • To test the efficacy of HCQ (400 mg orally daily for 3 days then 200 mg orally daily for an additional 11 days, to complete 14 days) to prevent incident SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to ascorbic acid among contacts of persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection • Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (self-collected samples collected daily Day 1 through Day 14)

Overall Design: This is a randomized, multi-center, placebo-equivalent (ascorbic acid) controlled, blinded study of HCQ PEP for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults exposed to the virus. This study will enroll up to 2000 asymptomatic men and women 18 to 80 years of age (inclusive) at baseline who are close contacts of persons with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_297761]. Eligible participants will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to HCQ or ascorbic acid at the level of the household (all eligible participants in 1 household will receive the same intervention). Participants will be counseled about the preliminary in vitro data on HCQ activity against SARS-CoV-2 and equipoise regarding efficacy in humans. Participants may participate in a sub-study where they will be asked to provide a dried blood spot sample for therapy concentration and pharmacokinetics (PK) of HCQ as well as for SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_297762] (DSMB) will be convened for this study with expertise in COVID-19 or respi[INVESTIGATOR_4398], PEP, and emerging epi[INVESTIGATOR_7509]; DSMB will include a biostatistician. The purpose of the DSMB is to monitor the study for operational futility, social harms, and efficacy. If additional data emerge on alternative effective agents for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis and/or data about HCQ as PEP, the protocol could be modified through an amendment to evaluate an alternative therapy as PEP. Alternatively, this platform study could be modified through an adaptive design to test the efficacy of new potential agents for COVID-19 PEP. Number of Participants: Up to 2000 eligible participants will be randomly assigned (at the level of household) 1:1 to study treatment (HCQ or ascorbic acid). Up to 2000 index cases will be enrolled. Treatment Groups and Duration: The duration of study participation will be approximately 28 days. Households will be randomized 1:1 (at the level of household), with close contact [CONTACT_244700][INVESTIGATOR_014]:

11 3. Introduction This is a randomized, multi-center, placebo-equivalent (ascorbic acid) controlled, blinded study of the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for the prevention of severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in adults exposed to the virus. Evaluations include safety and tolerability, SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding, and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) diagnosis. Two study groups (one active and one receiving ascorbic acid [vitamin C], to serve as a placebo-equivalent comparator) will be enrolled to assess a daily dosing regimen administered for 14 days, which appears to be the approximate incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Up to 2000 eligible participants 18 to 80 years of age will be randomized (at the level of household) 1:1 to receive one of the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: • HCQ 400 mg orally daily for 3 days then 200 mg orally daily for an additional 11 days • Ascorbic acid 500 orally daily for 3 days then 250 mg orally daily for 11 days HCQ and ascorbic acid will appear similar, and taste will be partially masked as HCQ can be bitter and ascorbic acid will be sour. During the study participants will perform the following: • Collect mid-nasal swabs for viral detection for the primary trial endpoint • Complete Surveys that will include questions about symptoms from both the drug regimen and virus infection, review of concomitant medications, and other pertinent topi[INVESTIGATOR_244669]: Participants who report respi[INVESTIGATOR_244670]. During the first [ADDRESS_297763] mid-nasal swab to assess symptoms and virus exposure. On Day 28, a final swab is collected and Survey completed. The duration of study participation will be approximately 28 days. Up to 2000 eligible index cases for the COVID-19 PEP study will be invited to participate and asked to provide a baseline mid-nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 testing and complete a questionnaire at baseline and on Day 28 to report the clinical course of their illness. 3.1. Background SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus novel to the human population discovered in December 2019; it is currently the cause of a global pandemic [1,2,3]. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the disease caused by [CONTACT_7544]-CoV-2 COVID-19. As of 08 March 2020, person-to-person transmission has occurred in China, across temperate Asia, Europe, and North America, and with sporadic cases in Africa and the southern hemisphere. Accurate reporting is limited by [CONTACT_46189]. The WHO declared the COVID-19 pandemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 [4], and the [LOCATION_002] declared a national emergency on 13 March 2020 [5]. 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol Hydroxychloroquine for COVID-[ADDRESS_297764] occurred in the elderly or in persons with underlying pulmonary or cardiac comorbidities or diabetes. In healthy adults, including pregnant women, it can cause a febrile, self-limited pneumonia. Infection appears less symptomatic in children and younger adults [6]. Nevertheless, the burden of this pandemic to the global health and economic systems is expected to be substantial. No acquired immunity to this novel viral infection appears to exist in the human population globally, and no effective treatment or preventative agent is licensed at this time. As with many infectious epi[INVESTIGATOR_7509], household contacts, first responders, caregivers, and medical personnel attending persons with COVID-19 are at high risk of infection. The incubation time requires 14 days of quarantine for exposed individuals not wearing personal protective equipment [7], and on 03 March 2020, WHO declared a global shortage of personal protective equipment leaving doctors, nurses, and other frontline workers dangerously ill-equipped to care for COVID-19 patients [8]. Extensive absences from the care network and health system will degrade the ability to care not only for those with COVID-19 but also for routine healthcare issues as well. PEP is defined as taking antimicrobial medication after potential exposure to an infectious agent to prevent becoming infected. PEP should be started as soon as possible after a recent possible exposure to the infectious agent [9]. At this time, there is no known effective prophylaxis for COVID-19 and thus there is equipoise for testing a non-active comparator (e.g., ascorbic acid) against a potentially active drug. 3.2. Study Rationale 3.2.1. COVID-19 and Antiviral Approaches SARS-CoV-2 is a novel betacoronavirus of zoonotic origin, similar to the coronaviruses severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] (MERS). Based on current evidence, case fatality rate for SARS-CoV-2 is about 3%, which is significantly lower than SARS-CoV (10%) and MERS-CoV (40%) [10]. However, SARS-CoV-2 has potentially higher transmissibility (R0: 1.4-5.5) than both SARS-CoV (R0: 2-5) and MERS-CoV (R0: <1) [10]. Our understanding of the viral pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 remains limited. However, it appears that the virus cell entry depends on binding of the viral spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by [CONTACT_244702]. SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, uses the same receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on pulmonary epi[INVESTIGATOR_244671] 2 for S protein priming [11]. The receptor binding domain of lineage B betacoronaviruses is a single, continuous domain that contains all of the structural information necessary to interact with the host receptor. Fusion is mediated at the cell membrane, delivering the viral nucleocapsid inside the cell for subsequent replication. ACE2 expression is found in the lung epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], vascular endothelium, renal tubular epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], and epi[INVESTIGATOR_244672]. Viral shedding has been localized primarily to respi[INVESTIGATOR_244673] [2]. Medications to treat and/or prevent SARS-CoV-2 need to inhibit aspects of the viral life cycle, ultimately blocking replication. Already-approved and available medications are ideal for 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol Hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 PEP, Version 1.2  
13 immediate evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment and prevention. Two potential targets for anti-SARS-CoV-2 medications are viral polymerases and proteases [12]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_244674]-CoV-2 using various repurposed antiviral medicines (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov). Similarities between SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_297765] SARS-CoV and MERS may be promising agents as SARS-CoV-2 PEP [12,13]. 3.2.2. Antiviral Effects of Chloroquine Analogues Against COVID-19 Chloroquine (CQ) was discovered in [ADDRESS_297766] prescribed drugs globally, prior to the emergence of widespread drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum [14]. CQ was found to be effective against rheumatoid tenosynovitis in 1951 [15]. HCQ was licensed in the [LOCATION_002] in 1955 as an antimalarial and as a drug for rheumatoid arthritis, and it was widely marketed for the latter due to a favorable safety profile with chronic use [16]. The mechanisms of action for HCQ for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases are still not fully understood despi[INVESTIGATOR_244675] 60 years [17]. CQ and HCQ have been proposed as potential agents for treatment and prevention against other infectious agents beyond malaria [18,19]. The mechanism of action differs according to the pathogen: against intracellular bacteria and fungi by [CONTACT_244703], restoring the activity of other antibiotics, and against viral replication through alkalization of acidic organelles, namely endosomes, lysosomes, and Golgi vesicles. CQ is effective in vitro against SARS-CoV coronavirus in Vero E6 cells with the EC50 ~8 µM [20] and had shown evidence of prevention activity in vivo [21]. Hence, these re-purposed drugs were obvious hits for testing against SARS-CoV-2. In vitro inhibition in Vero E6 cells against the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been published in recent weeks. Wang et al (2020) showed that the EC50 and EC90 for CQ in Vero E6 cells is 1.13 µM and 6.90 µM, respectively [22]. Yao et al (2020) showed that the EC50 for CQ treatment of infected cells at 48 hours was 5.47 µM, whereas HCQ appeared slightly more potent, with EC50 of 0.72 µM at 48 hours [23]. These levels appear to be within the range of exposures that could be achieved with standard HCQ treatment, and likely prophylaxis, due to concentrations of the drug achieved in the lung tissue [23]. No in vitro data in the lung epi[INVESTIGATOR_244676]. Multiple observational and small Investigator-initiated COVID-19 pneumonia treatment trials using CQ, HCQ, and variety of other medications are ongoing in China (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov). Gao et al reported anecdotal efficacy of CQ as treatment for COVID-19–associated pneumonia [24]. 3.2.3. Rationale for Drug Selection The trial will test a daily regimen of HCQ for 14 days after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (package insert Appendix 4). Daily dosing has the highest likelihood to achieve sustained required drug levels for viral inhibition, as shown in the physiologically based PK (PBPK) modeling 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol Hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 PEP, Version 1.2  
14 (Appendix 5). HCQ is commonly used daily in doses up to 600 mg of HCQ sulfate (465 mg base) per day for rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus initially, with a usual maintenance dose 200 mg (155 mg base) for maintenance therapy. HCQ and CQ are both commonly used in a weekly dosing schedule for malaria chemoprophylaxis. HCQ is associated with a better safety profile for daily and chronic use than CQ, including [ADDRESS_297767] SARS-CoV-2 [23]. As the COVID-[ADDRESS_297768] dose to accelerate achieving steady state drug concentrations [25]. Since the drug will be used in those with a recent high-risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2, it is desirable to achieve adequate drug levels quickly. A PBPK model was built (SIMCYP simulator v.18) using physical and chemical parameters of HCQ obtained from the literature [26]; PK parameters (liver intrinsic clearance, fa, ka) were determined from clinical data [27]. This PBPK model was used to simulate HCQ concentrations in plasma and lung fluid following [ADDRESS_297769] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s ongoing trial of HCQ in China. The combination of in vitro antiviral concentration-effect and predicted drug concentrations in this study were used to propose a loading dose of 400 mg HCQ twice a day on Day 1, followed by [CONTACT_16690] 200 mg twice a day on Day 2 through Day 5. A second study (BY[CONTACT_244704]-DCTC-CPPO-HCQ-PBPKAR) was undertaken to simulate HCQ concentration-time profiles in plasma, whole blood, and lung in Chinese healthy populations. Since elderly patients have reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), simulations were conducted using a healthy Caucasian healthy population with renal injury (GFR 30 to 60 mL/min) and compared to a population with normal renal function to support the study design of prophylactic use of HCQ. In this analysis, 3 dosing regimens were simulated. Modeling suggests a loading dose of 400 mg for 3 days followed by 200 mg daily for 2 weeks should result in a shorter time to PK steady-state (Appendix 5). The 2-week treatment duration represents coverage for the duration of viral incubation time. This protocol will investigate a single dosage of HCQ. Participants will receive a loading dose of [ADDRESS_297770] possible effective dose, and possible alternate dosing schedules (i.e., weekly instead of daily).

15 3.2.5. Rationale for Ascorbic Acid Control as a Comparator In healthy adults, COVID-19 infection is likely to express as a febrile disease with cough and fatigue, but variability in symptomatology (to include oligosymptomatic infection) is a possibility [28]. Study participants will have already been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, likely with quarantine as a result, so randomization is unlikely to affect future risk behavior with respect to SARS-CoV-2. Symptom reporting may vary based on participants’ perception as to whether they are taking HCQ or ascorbic acid [29], but the primary study endpoints of infection and viral shedding are not affected. Therefore, use of a control is acceptable and ethical both for participants’ health and safety as well as ensuring the most rigorous trial design to evaluate PEP for SARS-CoV-2. Participants will be blinded to their allocation to the extent possible, with a comparator of ascorbic acid used to provide a similar taste as HCQ. Specifically, tablets will not be labeled as either HCQ or ascorbic acid, and an ascorbic acid tablet that is comparable in size and shape to HCQ will be used. All participants from the same household will be assigned the same regimen, so that comparisons cannot be made between the medications and to minimize crossover through drug sharing by [CONTACT_244705]. The dose of ascorbic acid (500 mg for 3 days, then 250 mg daily for 11 days) is safe. All participants, regardless of assigned group, will be able to take additional ascorbic acid (e.g., over the counter vitamins, or through food) should they choose, as there is no known maximum daily safe dose of ascorbic acid. Clinical trial evidence has demonstrated that ascorbic acid, alone or in combination with other micronutrients, does not substantially reduce the risk of upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_244677] [30,31]; thus, ascorbic acid is not expected to have a prevention effect for SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_297771] for this study [32]. 3.2.6. Rationale for Enrolling the Index Case for the Index Case Sub-study The quantity of the virus shed by [CONTACT_244706], and thus may relate to the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Index cases will be enrolled, and a nasal swab collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing to ascertain whether the index case was shedding virus and the level of viral shedding. The genotype of the virus shed will be investigated in a subset of participants. Evaluation of the paired samples (index case and contact) will provide evidence on whether the level of shedding is associated with SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_297772] receptor for SARS-CoV-2. A number of ACE2 variants could reduce the association between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the expression of human ACE2 might be important for the susceptibility, symptoms, and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection [33]. The association between plausible genetic markers and SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease will be assessed in this study.

16 3.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment COVID-19 can be unpredictable in its severity, but a 3.4% mortality rate has been observed among clinical pneumonia cases. The elderly (>60 years) and those with medical comorbidities are at highest risk of poor outcomes [1,2,3]. Moreover, transmission in younger persons amplifies infection in communities, putting susceptible persons at risk. There is no proven preventive drug other than transmission avoidance through barrier and droplet precautions, and in those likely exposed, quarantine for 14 days (beyond the viral incubation period) is currently recommended. HCQ has an excellent safety record at the proposed doses for 60 years and potent viral suppression in vitro. There is equipoise as to whether the in vitro efficacy of HCQ, or any other drug, will translate into preventive efficacy from disease or even a reduction in viral shedding. Thus, the potential benefit-to-risk ratio for testing HCQ as PEP is favorable in this population.

19 5. Study Design 5.1. Overall Design The overarching goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness of HCQ PEP on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 detection by [CONTACT_940] (PCR) to inform public health control strategies. This is a randomized, multi-center, placebo-equivalent (ascorbic acid) controlled, blinded study of the efficacy of HCQ PEP for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults exposed to the virus. This study will enroll up to 2000 asymptomatic men and women 18 to 80 years of age (inclusive) at baseline who are close contacts of persons with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_297776]. Eligible participants will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to HCQ or ascorbic acid at the level of the household (all eligible participants in 1 household will receive the same intervention). Participants will be counseled about the preliminary in vitro data on HCQ activity against SARS-CoV-2 and equipoise regarding efficacy in humans. Participants may participate in a sub-study where they will be asked to provide a dried blood spot (DBS) sample for therapy concentration and PK of HCQ as well as for SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_297777] (DSMB) will be convened for this study with expertise in COVID-19 or respi[INVESTIGATOR_4398], PEP, and emerging epi[INVESTIGATOR_7509]; DSMB will include a biostatistician. The purpose of the DSMB is to monitor the study for operational futility, social harms, and efficacy. This multi-center study will be conducted in high COVID-19 incidence areas in the [LOCATION_002]. At the time of the writing of this document, the sites are expected to be western Washington (Snohomish, King, and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_244678]) and [LOCATION_001], NY. As of [ADDRESS_297778] of them in Seattle. As of 13 March 2020, there are 158 cases in [LOCATION_001] City. Both setting are urban areas; Seattle has a population of 3.5 million and [LOCATION_001] has 8.6 million. If additional data emerge on alternative effective agents for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis and/or data about HCQ as PEP, the protocol could be modified through an amendment to alter its sample size and evaluate an alternative therapy as PEP. Alternatively, this platform study could be modified through an adaptive design to test the efficacy of new potential agents for COVID-[ADDRESS_297779] completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the study including the last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities (SoA). This study will be considered completed when sufficient number of participants complete the study to enable appropriate evaluation of the primary endpoint.

CONFIDENTIAL Protocol Hydroxychloroquine for COVID-[ADDRESS_297784] is enrolled in the study 6.2.2. Exclusion Criteria  1. Currently hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] 6.3. Screen Failures Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequently randomly assigned to study treatment. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event (SAE). Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) can be rescreened if there is a change in their eligibility. 6.4. Recruitment Each site will establish local recruitment and screening methods that operationalize protocol-specified requirements for eligibility determination in a manner that is tailored to and most efficient for the local study setting and target study population. Each site will use a variety of recruitment approaches, including direct recruitment at clinics, referrals from other providers and SARS-CoV-2 testing sites and laboratories, and use of online and social networking websites and apps. Recruitment materials will educate participants about COVID-19, transmission within households, epi[INVESTIGATOR_244679], and the in vitro data on HCQ limiting SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Initially, the study will enroll from 2 clinical sites: western Washington and [LOCATION_001], which have established track records of high quality clinical research integrated into clinical care settings; annual retention rates in clinical trials conducted in these sites exceed 80% to 90%. The sites have large COVID-[ADDRESS_297785] participants may be co-enrolled in other research studies, provided that these are observational studies only. Any other exception requires approval of the Co-Principal 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol Hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 PEP, Version 1.2  
23 Investigators. The study team should be consulted for co-enrollment in studies that do not meet this guidance or if there are questions about eligibility for co-enrollment. For any co-enrolled study, combined blood draws should not exceed current Red Cross phlebotomy guidance. Index case participants may enroll at any point in another study. 7. Treatments Study treatment is defined as any investigational treatment(s), marketed product(s), placebo, or medical device(s) intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study protocol. 7.1. Treatments Administered Study Treatment Name [CONTACT_244740] 200 mg (155 mg base) tablets [ADDRESS_297786] the adverse events (AEs) related to HCQ administration. With tens of millions of doses administrated for malaria and autoimmune diseases, the side effect profile of HCQ is well described and the drug is generally well tolerated. With short-term administration (as opposed to chronic/year-long use in rheumatologic disease management), the major AEs are gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea) and transient skin rashes. The gastrointestinal symptoms may vary by [CONTACT_244707] [35] and are best managed by [CONTACT_244708] a glass of milk (Appendix 6). A transient rash, most commonly morbilliform or psoriasiform, can develop in 10% of participants, often with a sustained loading dose, and is often managed by [CONTACT_244709]. To avoid this potential side effect, this protocol is using a short loading dose, not a sustained one. Uncommonly, idiosyncratic leukopenia/thrombocytopenia can occur and the drug 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol Hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 PEP, Version 1.2  
24 should not be given to those with underlying bone marrow disorders. Lastly, hypoglycemia can occur and those taking insulin or glucose-lowering drugs are at risk; blood glucose should be monitored. Minor blurry vision may occur with acute HCQ use, is reversible, dose-related, and is generally not severe. It may also be associated with mild headaches. It is caused by [CONTACT_244710], and is not a predictor of long-term toxicity. Participants experiencing minor blurry vision may adjust to it with counselling and reassurance that it is reversible and not progressive.   More severe rashes, including drug-related eosinophilia with systemic symptoms and Stevens-Johnson syndrome occur rarely.  Long-term manifestations of HCQ, including retinitis, renal and hepatic disease, and cardiomyopathy (Appendix 4), are not likely in this 2-week PEP exposure. 7.2.2. Risks Associated with COVID-[ADDRESS_297787] the public health department’s advice for self-quarantine. That said, quarantine is known to be stressful, especially for healthcare workers. Enrollment may improve morale during public health quarantine. Since there is clinical equipoise regarding HCQ efficacy on viral shedding, participants will be counseled to follow recommendations for self-quarantine. 7.3. Strategies to Minimize Risk 7.3.1. Dose Selection The recommended dose of HCQ for chronic use in lupus erythematosus is 200 mg to 400 mg daily—a dose that is safely taken for years including among elderly patients (≥65 years). The selection of 400 mg for 3 days then 200 mg daily for 11 days is likely to be safe with transient AEs (gastrointestinal symptoms and rashes) that are self-remitting. 7.3.2. Management of Participants to Limit Risks of SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_297788] clinical space free for patients seeking care. Also, to limit exposure in waiting rooms and pharmacies, clinical specimens will be self-collected and medications delivered to homes. 7.4. Dose Modification and Toxicity Management If a study therapy dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible. If it is less than 4 hours before the next dose, the dose should be skipped. Modification for toxicities is discussed below. Only toxicities related to study medications provided through the study will be considered in the toxicity management section. Grade 1 or 2 Participants who develop Grade 1 or 2 toxicity (per division of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [DAIDS] adverse event [AE] Grading Table; see: https://rsc.tech-

To grade AEs, sites should refer to the DAIDS AE Grading Table, corrected Version 2.1, July 2017, which can be found on the DAIDS Regulatory Support Center website at https://rsc.tech-res.com/docs/default-source/safety/division-of-aids-(daids)-table-for-grading-the-severity-of-adult-and-pediatric-adverse-events-corrected-v-2-1.pdf. 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol Hydroxychloroquine for COVID-[ADDRESS_297807] attribution recorded as related or not related to study medication, in the judgment of the site Investigator. 10.2.3. AE and SAE Reporting • SAEs will be reported within 48 hours to the Sponsor.  • Grade 3 and 4 AEs assessed as related to the study medication by [CONTACT_244698] 48 hours.  • Grade 1 and 2 AEs assessed as related to the study medication by [CONTACT_244698] 2 weeks of the participant’s Exit Contact.  10.2.4. Reporting of Use During Pregnancy • Medication exposure during pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor within 2 weeks of the participant’s Exit Contact. 10.2.5. Reporting of Misuse of Drug  • Misuse and abuse of medication outside the protocol will be reported to the Sponsor within 2 weeks of the participant’s Exit Contact. 10.2.6. Treatment of Overdose Overdose of HCQ should be managed according to the labeling information (see Appendix 4). Ascorbic acid exhibits low toxicity; risks from overdose are expected to be minimal. Overdose of study medication should be reported to the Sponsor within 48 hours. 10.2.7. AEs Among Index Case Participants  AEs among the index case participants in the index case sub-study will not be collected or reported as index cases are not receiving study medication or interventions. 10.3. Safety and AE Assessments Safety will be assessed via participant Surveys, as shown in the SoA. Participants will be asked to complete Surveys (Daily Survey and Exit Contact [CONTACT_244701]) that include questions about their health, healthcare seeking, symptoms, illness within their household, contact, and mobility. Qualifying events will be recorded on the eCRF and reported as AEs, as described in Section 10.2. Social harms will be assessed throughout the study, reported using the Social Harms form, and reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_297808]-dose can be random; however, no more than [ADDRESS_297809] dose are also informative to the population PK model development. The basic requirements for PK sampling are as follows: 1. Accurate record of time of the dose prior to the blood sampling (dd:mm:yy; hh:mm) 2. Accurate recording of time of blood sampling (dd:mm:yy; hh:mm) for each blood sampling. 3. Whole blood can be obtained by [CONTACT_244728][INVESTIGATOR_244683] a lancet. 4. Approximately [ADDRESS_297810] is available. 10.5. Genetic Testing 10.5.1. Samples Used for Genetic Testing Dried blood spot and mid-nasal swab samples collected in the study could be used potentially for genetic studies. During the consent process, participants can opt out of genetic testing.  10.5.2. Genetic Testing Procedures  Studies conducted on stored samples will investigate genes that may play a role in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or other respi[INVESTIGATOR_244684]/or severity of COVID-19. The samples 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol Hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 PEP, Version 1.2  
36 will not be used to study genes related to diseases other than SARS-CoV-2 or other respi[INVESTIGATOR_4398]. 10.5.3. Genetic Information That Will Be Obtained Samples will be tested for the presence of genetic markers, which the investigators believe, on the basis of available medical literature, to possibly be rationally associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or the severity of COVID-19. Genome-wide screening (such as “SNP screening”) is not planned.  10.6. Biohazard Containment As the transmission of SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_297811] family members at a 3% to 15% risk of infection after likely exposure [32, 33]. The sample size required to show a 50% protective efficacy of PEP is entirely dependent on that attack rate. Sample size calculations used an estimated 6% attack rate. A sample size will be chosen for each group (HCQ and ascorbic acid) to achieve 80% power with 0.05 two-sided Type 1 error for the endpoint of any laboratory-detected incident SARS-CoV-2, exclusion of participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, an attack rate of 6%, 50% efficacy of HCQ in reducing SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_297812] household member enrolled and subsequent household members to the same intervention. With these assumptions, a cohort of 1498 households (749 in the control and 749 in the intervention for each cohort) will provide at least 80% power to detect a decrease in SARS-CoV-2 incidence from 6% to 3%. As household size increases, power will increase. Household members will be randomized as a unit but analyzed as individuals. The table below estimates power assuming that households are randomized until either 1498 households are randomized or 1498 individuals are randomized. Each row shows the distribution of the numbers of individuals within a household who are randomized. Individual risk is assumed to be independent. Power may be lower depending on correlation in risk within and between households (Table 1).

These power calculations indicate that final power will depend heavily on the population enrolled. To mitigate the potential loss in power from lack of information about cluster size, the final target sample size will be estimated midway through the study based on the observed distribution of the number of household contacts. The procedure for redetermining sample size will be described in an Interim Monitoring Plan approved by [CONTACT_4318]. 11.2. Populations for Analyses For analysis purposes, the following populations are defined: Population Description Intention to Treat All enrolled participants who are contacts Modified Intention to Treat (MITT) Contacts who are SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_297814] 1 interpretable PK sample  DBS: dried blood spot; PK: pharmacokinetic; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; SARS-CoV-2: severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2.  Note: All PCR negative household contacts will be included in the MITT analyses. 11.3. Statistical Analyses The Statistical Analysis Plan will be developed and finalized before database lock and will describe the participant populations to be included in the analyses, and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data. This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints (these are listed in Section 4).

Exploratory PK/pharmacodynamic analyses will be performed as the data allow. 11.3.5. Exploratory Transmission Analyses The index case sub-study will assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the association with the semi-quantitative PCR results. Also, the risk of transmission between close contacts will be assessed by [CONTACT_244730] a genetic match among household members through SARS-CoV-2 sequencing.

The study will review individual participant-level safety data frequently to assess the relation of all reported AEs to study treatment. On a weekly basis, the study team will review by-arm summaries of premature study discontinuations and premature study treatment discontinuations (and reasons) and AEs. Independent Monitor Study conduct will be monitored by [CONTACT_244733]. Monitors will visit participating clinical research sites to review the individual participant records, including consent forms, electronic case report forms, supporting data, laboratory specimen records, and endpoints through laboratory and medical records (physicians’ progress notes, nurses’ notes, individuals’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332]), to ensure protection of study participants, compliance with the protocol, and accuracy and completeness of records. The monitors also will inspect sites’ regulatory files to ensure that regulatory requirements are being followed and sites’ pharmacies to review product storage and management. Data and Safety Monitoring Board An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be convened for this study with expertise in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or respi[INVESTIGATOR_4398], post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and emerging epi[INVESTIGATOR_244693] a biostatistician. The purpose of the DSMB is to monitor the study for operational futility, social harms, and efficacy. The DSMB will evaluate the progress of the project, including periodic assessments of accrual, retention, safety, performance and variation of the project sites, and other factors that can affect project implementation. The target number of households (index cases) and their contacts enrolled into the study will be re-assessed according to the distribution of cluster (household/institution) sizes seen in the study. The DSMB will review and approve modifications to the overall enrollment target. The DSMB will review the study after half to two-thirds of follow-up time with pre-specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_244694] (HCQ) PEP in reducing the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection overall and the ability of the study to meet its objectives. The DSMB will review severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS-CoV-2) endpoints. The DSMB will consider factors external to the project when relevant information becomes available, such as policy changes or scientific developments that may have an impact on project implementation, safety, and integration of COVID-[ADDRESS_297824]-protected closed reports of SARS-CoV-2 endpoints by [CONTACT_63615].

51 Appendix 4: Hydroxychloroquine Label Generic hydroxychloroquine label (current as of June 2018) is available online at https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=b82bbda6-64f2-4426-b4ec-254eeea895ae and provided below. Appendix 5: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling of Hydroxychloroquine Used for Post-exposure Prophylaxis Appendix 6: Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection and Analysis Collection of Blood Skin puncture 1. Before skin puncture, the participant should warm his/her hands. The finger is massaged anterogradely to enrich the blood flow toward the puncture site. 2. Clean the skin of the palmar side of the tip of the distal phalanx of the third or fourth finger of the non-writing hand with a suitable disinfectant, for example, 70% isopropyl alcohol. Puncture the skin by a single-use safety lancet. The finger should be held in such a position that the gravity facilitates the collection of blood from the fingertip. 3. When collection of capi[INVESTIGATOR_244695], place a bandage on the fingertip. Preparation of Blood Spots Preparation from blood collected by [CONTACT_244739] 1. Wipe off the first drop of blood with a gauze pad because it may contain excess tissue fluids. Massage the finger again to increase blood flow at the puncture site. Transfer the following drop to one of the circles of a filter card without touching the surface directly with the fingertip. Allow the blood to be soaked into the texture of the filter by [CONTACT_7092][INVESTIGATOR_244696]. 2. Let the next large drop of capi[INVESTIGATOR_244697]. Continue this procedure until all necessary circles are filled or blood flow stops. 3. Do not squeeze or “milk” the finger excessively if the blood flow is not sufficient to fill all the required circles of the filter card. If blood flow stops, place a bandage on the fingertip. Perform a second skin puncture on another finger if more blood is needed for the examination. 4. For blood obtained by [CONTACT_48571], use syringe to apply approximately 100 µL of blood on the filter paper. Drying of Blood Spots To dry the blood spots, put the filter cards on a clean paper towel and let them dry, preferably overnight (but for at least 4 hours), at room temperature in the absence of any external source of heat. When the drying process is complete, the blood spots have a uniformly dark brownish color and no red areas are visible anymore.

52 Storage and Transportation of Dried Blood Spots (DBS) NOTE: Processing of the blood spots can be interrupted after drying. The filter cards can now be stored. 1. For storage, put the filter paper card in a single, gas-impermeable zipper bag, containing [ADDRESS_297826] the following: 1. Date and time of sample 2. Date and time of last dose Samples that appear to be collected according to the schedule of activities, which have the required amount of blood for a 5- to 6-mm punch and have the minimal required information (1 through 2 above), will be processed for hydroxychloroquine (and metabolite) concentration.

Document date: 02/25/[ADDRESS_868543] injury 
IRB Control #11F.[ADDRESS_868544] injury (SCI) is essential to fracture prevention and the 
associated morbidity of bed rest and further secondary complications. Intravenous (IV) zoledronic acid 
(ZA) has been shown to be more effective than other agents in reducing bone mass resorption and fracture 
of the legs in post-menopausal women, but has not been studied in acute spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828]. Two previous 
studies of ZA in persons with subacute SCI, while promising, were inconclusive. As stated in the long 
range plan of the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR), one goal in the 
area of health and function is to “focus on the onset of new conditions…exacerbation of existing 
conditions, or the development of coexisting conditions” 1.  This study is intended to demonstrate 
reduction in loss of bone mass at the hip and knee regions in acute SCI in a rigorous study of sufficient 
size to determine effectiveness of our intervention.  
Central Hypothesis:  Alteration in levels of osteogenic or osteoclastogenic factors secondary to SCI 
plays a crucial role in bone loss and that this loss can be prevented by a single dose of IV ZA 
administered within three weeks following injury in individuals with complete SCI. This will be a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ZA enrolling 48 subjects over 4 years, randomized 
to ZA or placebo in a 2:1 ratio.  
Primary Outcome: Change in bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by [CONTACT_11323] X-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline, [ADDRESS_868545]-injury.  
This will compare BMD at the hip, distal femur and proximal tibia. 
Secondary Outcome : Collection of blood biomarkers of bone formation and resorption at selected time 
intervals within the first [ADDRESS_868546]-injury.  
This will observe the timing of metabolic indexes of bone formation and resorption, and of pro-
osteoclastogenic factors promoting bone resorption.  
Secondary Outcome : Assessment of the safety and tolerability of ZA in the study population.

 B. Specific Aims 
Specific Aim 1:  To determine the short and long term effects of ZA on BMD values of the hip, distal 
femur and proximal tibia in patients with acute SCI relative to patients receiving placebo.  
Primary hypothesis: S ubjects treated with ZA will have at least a 50% smaller percentage 
decline in BMD values for the hip, distal femur and proximal tibia at [ADDRESS_868547]-injury 
than control subjects .  
Secondary hypothesis 1: S ubjects treated with ZA will maintain original BMD values for the 
hip, distal femur and proximal tibia at 4 months and lose no more than 5% at12 months post-
injury than control subjects.  
Secondary hypothesis 2 (Exploratory): Incidence of fractures in the hip, distal femur, and 
proximal tibia will be at least 50% lower in subjects treated with ZA compared to controls. This 
final hypothesis is exploratory, since we do not expect to have the numbers to achieve statistical 
significance given the relatively low frequency of sub-lesional fractures in SCI. 
Specific Aim 2:  To measure and compare selected blood biomarker levels: 1) pro-osteoclastogenic factor 
IL-1β; 2) bone formation marker P1NP; and 3) bone resorption marker serum C terminal telopeptide of 
type I collagen (s-CTX) in subjects treated with ZA to control subjects.  
Primary hypothesis: Subjects treated with ZA will have lower levels of serum marker of bone 
resorption s-CTX at [ADDRESS_868548] to control subjects whose resorption marker levels will be significantly above 
the reference range at all of the time points.  
Secondary hypothesis:  Levels of serum marker of bone formation P1NP will not be lower than 
control subjects at 4 and 12 months. 
Specific Aim 3:  To determine the safety and tolerability of early administration of intravenous ZA in 
persons with acute SCI. We will test the hypotheses  that compared to controls, subjects treated with ZA 
will: 1) have an increased incidence of myalgias, fever, gastrointestinal disturbances, and flu-like 
symptoms over the three days after infusion of study drug; 2) be less likely to participate in physical and 
occupational therapy during the first week after infusion, 3) be less likely to want the treatment again.  
C. Background and Significance of Bone Loss in SCI 
Increased bone turnover and resultant osteoporosis is a prevalent condition following acute traumatic SCI. 
In the initial weeks following SCI, a process of rapid bone remodeling and bone resorption occurs, with 
resorption exceeding formation, thereby [CONTACT_648325]2.  Radiographic evidence suggests that an 
estimated 25% of bone mineral density (BMD) below the level of injury is lost within the first 4 months 
following acute SCI and progresses to a 33% loss by [ADDRESS_868549] injury3,4, leaving patients at or near 
the fracture threshold3. Additional investigations extending the time from injury to 2 years estimate BMD 
reduction of 30-40% at the femoral neck , 37-43% at the distal femur5, and 50-60% at the proximal tibia6, 
with the majority of this loss occurring during the first [ADDRESS_868550] predictors of future “fragility fractures” or ones that occur under conditions of minimal or low 
impact in the absence of trauma7,8. The most significant risk factor for osteoporosis after SCI is the 
completeness of injury9. This association is particularly strong for regions at and below the knee. A higher

with onset of SCI prior to age 16 when peak bone mass has not yet been achieved5, with increasing 
age9,12, and with female gender13.   
In the patient with SCI, the primary goal of osteoporosis is fracture prevention. Although the annual 
incidence of lower extremity bone fractures has been reported as 2-6% 3,11,[ADDRESS_868552] injury 
centers for evaluation and treatment3. Among those with chronic SCI, 25-49% ultimately experience a 
fragility fracture14,16. The majority of fragility fractures occur in the hip, distal femur and proximal 
tibia5,7,14. Fractures may arise from routine activities such as transfers or low-velocity falls from a 
wheelchair or commode3,7,17. Maintenance of bone mass is essential to fracture prevention given the 
morbidity that can result: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], increased spasticity, autonomic dysreflexia, heterotopic 
ossification, and in select cases, surgical intervention8. In those fractures treated conservatively, pressure 
ulcers may arise from bracing or splints, temporary casts, or bed rest7. The consequences invariably lead 
to reduced level of independence, increased nursing or attendant care, and greater cost to the patient and 
health care system. With the combined effects of an increased life expectancy after SCI and a greater 
number of new cases among persons above age 55, who may have already developed early osteoporosis, 
the cost physically and emotionally to the patient and financially to the health care system will rise in 
coming years7,18. 
Pathophysiology of Osteoporosis: 
Osteoporosis or “porous bone” is a condition of low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of 
bone tissue that together result in increased bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture19. Bone is reduced 
in quantity per area studied but mineralized normally. Bone is comprised of two types of living bone 
cells, the osteoclasts that remove weakened sections of bone and the osteoblasts that initially build and 
continually replace bad bone with new bone throughout the life span. This process leads to thicker and 
stronger bones until approximately the age of 25; after that bone is essentially maintained or slowly lost 
until age 50 when effects of aging and hormone changes occur20. Bone loss can accelerate rapi[INVESTIGATOR_648302]21. The typi[INVESTIGATOR_648303]-
bodied individual beginning around age 25 is illustrated in figure 1 below.

Osteoporosis is traditionally diagnosed with BMD measurements measured by [CONTACT_648327][INVESTIGATOR_648304] a given region viewed by [CONTACT_648328]2. A patient’s results can be interpreted as a standard deviation 
from the mean of sex-matched peak bone mass (T score).[ADDRESS_868553] deviations from the mean of age and sex matched 
bone mass. The Z score is often used for patients below age 25 in which peak bone mass has not been 
achieved, but is a useful measure for all pre-menopausal women and men < 50 years (International 
Society for Clinical Densitometry Official Positions. www.iscd.org . Updated 2007).  A given patient is 
assigned a T or Z score for a given location based on established norms illustrated in Figure 2. 
Figure 2: From ISCD bone densitometry Clinician Course, Lecture 5(2008) accessed at National Osteoporosis 
Foundation website, www.nof.org . 
 
The Z score is an additional means of identifying high risk patients that may not be osteoporotic but are 
below expected bone density for age and thus, should be followed more closely21. While there is no 
specific T score that correlates with fracture threshold, the more negative the T score, the greater the risk. 
In able-bodied post-menopausal females, several prospective studies indicate that half of patients with 
incident fractures had baseline BMD assessed by [CONTACT_648329]25-27. 
O
ur study will calculate both T and Z scores for initial and follow up testing so that results can be 
compared to other studies that use these values rather than absolute BMD. 
Causes of Osteoporosis  
In the general population, development of osteoporosis is due to factors such as age, diet, lifestyle (with 
or without weight-bearing exercise, gender, and ethnicity21. However, certain medications, including ones 
given for secondary conditions related to SCI, also contribute to osteoporosis.  Glucocorticoids decrease 
bone formation by [CONTACT_648330]28. Thiazolidinediones given to persons with diabetes mellitus can lead to osteoporosis 
by [CONTACT_648331]. The “A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial” (ADOPT) 
found that patients randomized to rosiglitazone have a higher risk of fractures than those receiving 
metformin or glyburide29,30. Unfractionated heparin given for > [ADDRESS_868554] injury 
IRB Control #11F.[ADDRESS_868555] been 
associated with decreased BMD due to elevated vitamin D catabolism; elevated parathyroid hormone or 
increased osteoclastic activity32,33.   
Inade
quate stores of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D contribute to low BMD and increased risk of 
fractures34. Low levels of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D occur in substantial numbers of persons with acute 
and chronic SCI35,36. The degree of vitamin D deficiency is also important in development of osteoporosis 
due to upregulation of osteoclast cells in proportion to the degree of low vitamin D. Work done by [CONTACT_514791]35 has demonstrated that only 35% of acute SCI patients injured in summer months and 16% in 
winter months actually have therapeutic levels of vitamin D (>32 ng/ml). The remainder required 
supplementation to achieve therapeutic levels. Findings from this study are summarized in Table 2 
below:

Historical patterns of bone loss following SCI :  
Garland3  compared complete, subacute SCI subjects (average 4 months from SCI, with repeat assessment 
at 16 months) to complete chronic subjects 5 years from injury. Results demonstrated 24% lower BMD of 
the distal femur of SCI subjects 4 months after injury and 34% lower BMD [ADDRESS_868556] year of SCI 
found impressive losses averaging 4% per month for high turnover areas of trabecular bone and 
2%/month for areas of cortical bone. This finding of greater losses in trabecular relative to cortical bone is 
consistent with several previous investigations10,39, particularly in the first [ADDRESS_868557] 40-45% of 
BMD in the pelvis and 25% in the total leg between [ADDRESS_868558] injury.  Moreover, among 
subjects with partial motor recovery, 30% of pelvic bone mineral and 10% of total leg bone mineral 
content was lost between 5 and 50 weeks. In a study of chronic SCI subjects, Biering-Sorenson6  observed 
loss in bone mineral content in the proximal tibia of 40-50% of control subjects and in the femoral neck 
30-40% of controls by [ADDRESS_868559] injury41.  
Bone markers: 
In the early weeks following SCI, the rate of bone resorption greatly exceeds that of bone formation due 
primarily to upregulation of the osteoclast42.  Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, observed in the weeks 
following paralysis, arise in parallel with elevation of resorption indices such as urine and serum N-
telopeptide, hydroxyproline, and urine pyridinoline42-[ADDRESS_868560] injury 
IRB Control #11F.[ADDRESS_868561]’s contralateral knee serving as a control. After 3 months, DXA results in the 
lower extremity demonstrated a 5% higher value in the treated leg, yet no difference was found in DXA 
scores after 6 months and 12 months.  
 
Results using functional electrical stimulation (FES) have been mixed. Needham-Shropshire found no 
improvement in a study of complete paraplegics after 3 months therapy with a microprocessor-controlled 
FES unit known as a “Parastep”51. Leeds and colleagues also found no BMD change using an FES bicycle 
ergometry in seven tetraplegic patients 2-7 years after original injury52.  
However, a similar study of FES-
induced lower extremity exercise found BMD reductions that were smaller than expected and less than 
control subjects53. Belanger et al. had greater benefits in their use of FES, with 30% recovery seen in 
BMD of the distal femur and proximal tibia relative to pre-treatment values54.  But, final BMD values 
remained significantly lower than in able-bodied controls. 
Early investigations of oral and IV bisphosphonates 
Several groups have explored the use of various bisphosphonates for prevention of bone loss in acute and 
chronic SCI.  Two studies examined the use of oral alendronate plus calcium.  Zehnder55 studied 
alendronate plus calcium in 55 motor complete males (AIS A or B) with chronic SCI over a 24 month 
period and compared them to control subjects who received only calcium supplementation.  Vitamin D 
400 IU was given only to those with severe deficiency of serum 25-OH vitamin D <6 ng/ml. The mean

Zoledronic Acid in acute spi[INVESTIGATOR_648301] #11F.[ADDRESS_868562]. The group that 
received oral alendronate 10 mg daily plus 500 mg daily calcium was able to maintain their lower pre-
treatment level of BMD at the total hip, tibial diaphysis and tibial epi[INVESTIGATOR_175364], but BMD continued to 
decline steadily in the calcium only group serving as a control.  The baseline z scores were already in the 
osteopenic range for the hip (-1.83) and tibial diaphysis (-1.75) and in the osteoporotic range (-3.39) and 
the tibial epi[INVESTIGATOR_175364].  In order to prevent the baseline osteoporosis seen in this study, an earlier intervention 
would be needed.  
A double blind, placebo controlled study by [CONTACT_648332]56  examined 31 subjects with neurological levels of 
injury C4-L2 and AIS grades A-D, 10 days from injury. All were between ages 18-55.  Subjects were 
divided equally into an experimental group given alendronate 70 mg weekly for 12 months and a control 
group given placebo. Subjects were not given supplemental calcium. Oral vitamin D of unlisted amount 
was given only to those in the deficient range (<12.5 ng/ml), rather than to all subjects for prevention. 
Alendronate-treated subjects had a decline in BMD of 5.6% in the total leg and 3.3% in the total hip, but 
this degree of bone loss was notably less than the decline observed in the placebo group, who lost 12.7% 
in the total leg and 20.7% in the hip.  However, many of these subjects were incomplete injuries, and 
several patients had regained ambulation, possibly reducing the amount of bone loss in both groups.  
Challenges exist to giving oral alendronate in the setting immediately following SCI. Limitations to 
upright posture include post-operative spi[INVESTIGATOR_648305], delay in brace fitting needed to 
maintain stability in sitting position, autonomic effects of orthostasis, and pain. Erosive esophagitis may 
occur following consumption of oral bisphosphonates, unless patients are able to sit fully upright after 
administration of medications. In the previously described study by [CONTACT_648332]56, authors specifically 
reported no difficulties encountered with GI symptoms. This may have been due to the number of 
subjects with AIS Grades B-D or with thoracolumbar neurological levels of injury. Severe orthostatic 
hypotension is less common in these groups, permitting earlier functional mobility and facilitating upright 
positioning sooner after injury. Because IV formulations can be administered in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], 
investigators have explored the use of IV bisphosphonates in the setting of acute SCI. An early 
investigation by [CONTACT_648333]57 examined the use of IV pamidronate, a relatively weak bisphosphonate, within [ADDRESS_868563] rehabilitation therapy but no drug. Interpretation of results was 
limited by [CONTACT_648334]: some had sensory and motor complete injuries (AIS A), while 
others were AIS D, a subset of whom were ambulatory. Outcomes at 12 months evaluated BMD at the 
hip, distal femur and proximal tibia by [CONTACT_648335]. Only the pamidronate-treated AIS D 
subjects demonstrated an increase in BMD and this rise was observed only in the distal femur. The 
proximal tibia and hip were largely unchanged from subjects’ baseline BMD, but control subjects 
demonstrated BMD losses of .5%, 13.4% and 10.5% respectively. In this study, control subjects with AIS 
grade A injury lost 14.6% of original BMD, while pamidronate-treated subjects lost only 6.5% of their 
original BMD. Neither group was able to maintain their pre-injury bone density. A second investigati on 
by [CONTACT_648336]58 examined the effect of IV pamidronate on sublesional osteoporosis in [ADDRESS_868564] statistically similar amounts of 
BMD below the level of injury: 18 vs. 15% in the pelvis; 28 vs. 17% in the distal femur, and 42 vs. 36% 
in the proximal tibia.   
Zoledronic Acid: Initial trial data and clinical pharmacology  
Zoledronic acid demonstrates superior pharmacodynamic properties for suppression of the primary bone 
resorbing cell, the osteoclast, in comparison to actions of earlier generation oral and IV 
bisphosphonates59. Zoledronic acid has a particularly high affinity for binding to the calcium phosphate 
bone mineral, hydroxyapatite. Binding localizes to regions of high bone turnover, specifically trabecular

Zoledronic Acid in acute spi[INVESTIGATOR_648301] #11F.[ADDRESS_868565] common side effects of 
ZA are an acute phase reaction involving fever (15%), myalgias (8%), flu-like illness (7%), headache 
(6%) and arthralgias (5%)61,62. In rare cases, patients may experience noncardiac chest pain (1/3%). 
Because infusion of IV ZA can cause  an increase in serum creatinine up to [ADDRESS_868566] treatment, the 
drug should be avoided in persons  with creatinine clearance <35 mL/min. An association between atrial 
fibrillation and IV ZA use was observed in a large study of over [ADDRESS_868567] been associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), but further review 
of the data by [CONTACT_648337]-menopausal 
women with osteoporosis but more common in those with monthly infusions for cancer treatment64. This 
group recommended no special treatment beyond routine dental care for those using IV ZA for 
osteoporosis. Finally, several reports of low trauma fractures of the femur have been observed among 
patients primarily over age 60 who are prescribed chronic bisphosphonate treatment (2.5-8 years)61,65.   A 
recent cohort study of over 1.1 million patients by [CONTACT_648338]. found that while duration of use of 
bisphosphonates was correlated with incidence of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_84879], (particularly beyond 5 years of 
use), no correlation with age and duration of use was found.[ADDRESS_868568]-
menopausal females. The HORIZON Pi[INVESTIGATOR_648306]62 examined 7765 subjects with established 
clinical osteoporosis over 3 years. Findings demonstrated 70% and 41% reductions in vertebral and hip 
fractures respectively. Reduction of markers of bone resorption and bone formation were also observed, 
with levels reduced from baseline by 59% for β-CTX, 58% for PI[INVESTIGATOR_680], and 30% for bone specific alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) at [ADDRESS_868569] medical treatment within 3 months (mean 
of 58 days of injury). Neurological levels of participants ranged from C4 to L3 and included [ADDRESS_868570] injury

 (5 experimental, 6 control) and 3 incomplete subjects (2 experimental, 1 control). Differences between 
ZA-treated subjects and controls were 3% for the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (p<.05); 12% for the total hip (p<.05), 5% 
for the femoral neck (NS), and 11% (p<.05) at the greater trochanter [ADDRESS_868571] 10% of the original BMD. In both of the above studies, 
pharmacologic intervention did not occur until 2-[ADDRESS_868572].  Furthermore, neither study evaluated BMD at the distal femur and proximal tibia, 
two high risk areas for sublesional fractures after SCI. 
Areal Bone Mineral Density 
Since marked sub-lesional bone loss after SCI is found consistently5,6, our study will provide new 
information on the effectiveness of ZA in preventing bone loss after SCI because it differs from prior 
studies in the following important aspects: 
1. We will administer ZA within [ADDRESS_868573] of ZA on BMD at the hip, the distal femur, and proximal tibia. 
D. Study Design 
This will be a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a 2:[ADDRESS_868574] Injury Center of the Delaware Valley

treated more than 3,[ADDRESS_868576] injury and provides for multidisciplinary 
coordination of emergency and acute medical/surgical care, rehabilitation at the onset of acute

D.3. Methods 
1. Sample Size Calculations 
The sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome of BMD loss at the proximal tibia at [ADDRESS_868579] 50% reduction in percent BMD loss between treatment and control groups 
is projected. Expected BMD loss is taken from the placebo group of Bauman(58). 
Subjects in this study lost 8% +/- 3% BMD at 3 months and 29% +/- 13%  at [ADDRESS_868580] size (difference in mean percent reduction divided by [CONTACT_157516]) for a 50% 
reduction in BMD loss is 1.3 at 3 months and 1.1 at 12 months. Assuming 2:[ADDRESS_868581], 80% power and two-sided type-I error rate of 5%, we would need a total sample size of [ADDRESS_868582] size of 1.0. We plan to enroll 48 
subjects to allow for potential attrition. With a dropout rate of 18% we would reach a final sample of 39; a 
dropout rate of 30% would result in a final sample of 33. The enrollment of 10 subjects/year (total = 40) 
would still allow an 18% drop out to achieve a final sample of 33. 
2. Randomization Method  
The randomization schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_648340]. Randomization will 
use the method of random permuted blocks. The block size will not be disclosed to the investigators. The 
TJU Division of Biostatistics will prepare a randomization scheme document to be kept by [CONTACT_648341] (IDS).  Once a subject is confirmed to be eligible and the informed consent 
is completed, the IDS will be alerted to assign a randomization and prepare for the subsequent medication 
preparation and delivery. A completed randomization assignment log will be returned to Biostatistics so 
they can monitor randomization and accrual.  
3. Management of Study Drug Infusion  
The TJUH Investigational Drug Service is a well-established service within the Pharmacy Department 
that participates in numerous inpatient and outpatient research protocols. The IDS reviews all inpatient 
investigational drug protocols and assists with patient enrollment (randomization), staff education and 
maintenance of study records, including protocol budgets. The IDS maintains all investigational drug 
records in accordance with FDA regulations as well as with the policies and procedures of the 
Institutional Review Board.  The IDS provides the procurement, storage, dispensing and maintenance of 
records for all investigational drugs.  
4. Study Activities and Assessments 
A. Screening: Post injury days 0 -17 
 Subjects admitted to the RSCIC with suspected complete SCI will be approached for participation 
shortly after admission.  After providing informed consent, subjects will be screened between [ADDRESS_868583] medical/surgical history 
and physical/neurological examination performed according to ISNCSCI guidelines to ensure an 
AIS Grade A SCI is present, or post-menopausal) and social or lifestyle factors that could alter 
ability to participate.  
 A serum pregnancy test (for females of child bearing age). 
 Standard of Care laboratory tests of kidney (TJUH Basic Metabolic Panel) and liver function 
(TJUH Hepatic Panel) will be reviewed to ensure the patient does not have a history of chronic 
liver or kidney failure, unknown to family or subject or not revealed on subject history interview.

Page 12 of 22 
  Serum calcium measurement.  If initial serum calcium is <7.0 mg/dl, the subject will be given 
correctional calcium doses in accordance with standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_648307]. The subject may still be able to participate if the calcium level 
is corrected by [CONTACT_648342].   
 Serum Vitamin D measurement.  Subjects with initial vitamin D levels in the deficient range 
(<13ng/ml) will not be eligible for participation.  If subject’s 25-OH vitamin D is between [ADDRESS_868584] will be supplemented with high potency oral ergocalciferol 50,000 International 
Units (IU) per week until retesting occurs at 4 weeks.  At the time the screening value is returned, 
subjects with 25-OH vitamin D levels between 20 and 32 will be started on 2000 IU vitamin D 
daily and those will levels 32 and higher will be initiated on 1000 IU daily.  Supplemental oral 
calcium of 1200 mg daily will be started on the same day as the vitamin D, except in cases of low 
values as described above.    
 Intact Parathyroid Hormone (iPTH) measurement. 
B. Baseline Assessments: Post-injury days 8-[ADDRESS_868585]-injury, and include the following: 
 Completion of the World Health Organization (WHO) Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX)73. 
The FRAX asks for information about age, date of birth, sex, weight, height, previous fracture 
history, parental fracture history, smoking, steroid use, history of rheumatoid arthritis, presence of 
a medical condition related to osteoporosis, alcohol use, and current hip bone mineral density (see 
data collection forms in Appendix B). All data are then entered into the FRAX website (available 
through the WHO) to obtain the 10 year probability of a fracture. No personal identifiers are used 
and no data is saved on the website. 
 Collection of blood sample for pre-treatment levels of PI[INVESTIGATOR_648308], s-
CTX as marker of bone resorption, IL-1β as a pro-osteoclastogenic factor, CPK (Creatinine 
Phosphokinase) as a marker of muscle tissue and kidney function,  and serum calcium.  
DXA scan, to be obtained as soon as the subject is medically stable for testing off the 
intensive/acute care floor (may be done up to 7 days after the infusion of study drug). 
C. Study drug infusion: Post injury day [ADDRESS_868586] injury, subjects will be administered study drug and assessed as follows: 
 Measurement of serum calcium level to ensure therapeutic levels. 
 A single IV infusion of ZA 5 mg or a placebo drug with the same dilution and duration of 
administration (prepared and dispensed by [CONTACT_648343]).  
 The single IV infusion will be administered over a 2 hour period (2.5 mg per hour) 
 Supplemental hydration as needed to keep urine output > [ADDRESS_868587]-infusion. 
 Acetaminophen [ADDRESS_868588] Drug Infusion 
 After the first day, acetaminophen will continue to be offered as needed every [ADDRESS_868589]-infusion. 
 Supplemental hydration will be continued as needed to keep urine output > [ADDRESS_868590]-infusion 
 Subjects will be assessed daily for [ADDRESS_868591] injury 
IRB Control #11F.612

Page 13 of 22 
  Subjects will be assessed for participation in physical therapy and occupational therapy since 
receiving the study drug, as well as willingness to get study drug again via interview held [ADDRESS_868592]-Drug Infusion 
 Subjects will be assessed weekly for one month after study drug administration for known side 
effects of the drugs, including myalgias, fever, gastrointestinal disturbances, and flu-like 
symptoms. 
 Laboratory values will be drawn for serum calcium, phosphate, and magnesium. 
F.  Month [ADDRESS_868593] Injury (+/-4 days)   
 Subjects will be assessed weekly for one month after study drug administration for known side 
effects of the drugs, including myalgias, fever, gastrointestinal disturbances, and  flu-like 
symptoms. 
 Blood samples* for laboratory values will be drawn for s-CTX, IL-1β, 25-OH vitamin D, serum 
calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, and Serum P1NP. *The total amount of blood drawn for all 
laboratory tests will be < 25 ml at each data collection session.  
G.  Month 2, 6 & [ADDRESS_868594] Injury   
A patient questionnaire will be administered either in-person or by [CONTACT_756]. The questions cover: 
 Any evidence or knowledge of bone fractures since the previous contact.  
 Information about exercises and standing, including use of functional electrical stimulation 
(FES), such as how often and average daily duration.  
 Supply of vitamin D and calcium tablets with reminder to bring pi[INVESTIGATOR_648309]. At these follow up visits, pi[INVESTIGATOR_648310]. 
H.  Months 4 & [ADDRESS_868595] Injury 
 Blood sample will be drawn for s-CTX, 25-OH vitamin D, serum calcium, intact parathyroid 
hormone.  Serum P1NP will also be drawn at 4 months. The total amount of blood drawn for all 
laboratory tests will be < 25 ml at each data collection session. 
 Complete neurological exam (at 12 months only)

 The DSMB will be recruited from Jefferson Medical College (JMC) faculty members and charged with 
monitoring study compliance. They will review screening and enrollment procedures, data collection and 
analysis, reporting of adverse events, and subject safety.  The DSMB members will meet every 6 months 
or more frequently as needed. The study investigators will meet with the DSMB chair every 6 months to 
review recommendations or concerns.  
The DSMB will be composed of the following members: 
John F. Ditunno Jr, MD (Chair)  Professor of Rehabilitation Medicine 
Edward B. Ruby, MD   Assistant Professor of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology 
Edward J. Filippone, MD  Clinical Assistant Professor of M edicine, Division of Nephrology  
E. Data Analysis  
1. Evaluation of Baseline Characteristics 
We will compare the treatment and control groups for baseline characteristics using t-tests and Chi-square 
tests as appropriate. Specifically, we will compare age at injury, baseline FRAX fracture risk, sex and 
injury level (tetraplegia/paraplegia) distribution. The level of significance for all analyses will be 0.05. 
2. Evaluation of Hypotheses 
Specific Aim 1:  To determine the short and long term effects of zoledronic acid on BMD values of the 
hip, distal femur, and proximal tibia in patients with acute SCI relative to patients receiving placebo.  
The primary hypothesis  is that subjects treated with zoledronic acid will have at least a 50% smaller 
percentage decline in BMD values for the hip, distal femur and proximal tibia at [ADDRESS_868602]-
injury than control subjects.    
Analysis: For each of the bone sites to be evaluated, a percent change from baseline ([baseline BMD – 
follow-up BMD]/baseline BMD) will be modeled using mixed effects linear regression. Fixed effects will 
be included for treatment assignment, time, treatment by [CONTACT_6491], and baseline BMD level. A 
random intercept term will be included to account for correlation among repeated measurements from the 
same subject.  Within this regression model, we will estimate the difference between treatment groups at 
[ADDRESS_868603] for significance of this difference. If the outcome of percent change is not 
normally distributed, we will apply an appropriate transformation (e.g., log, logit). If the necessary 
transformation is too complex for interpretation, we will consider using rank-based methods.   
Secondary hypothesis 1  is that subjects treated with zoledronic acid will maintain original BMD values 
for the hip, distal femur and proximal tibia at 4 months and lose no more than 5% at12 months post-
injury.   
Analysis: We will estimate the mean percent change at 4 and 12 months for the active treatment group 
along with associated 95% confidence intervals from the results of the mixed effects regression.  BMD 
values at 4 months will be considered equivalent to those at baseline if the bounds of the confidence 
interval are within +/-2%. At [ADDRESS_868604] the one-sided null hypothesis that the percentage 
decline is greater than 5% vs. the alternative that it is less than or equal to 5%.   
Secondary hypothesis [ADDRESS_868605] 50% 
lower in the ZA group relative to controls over the course of the grant cycle . This final hypothesis is 
exploratory, since we do not expect to have the numbers to achieve statistical significance given the 
relatively low frequency of sublesional fractures in SCI.   
Analysis: The relative risks of all fractures and site-specific fractures will be calculated along with exact 
95% confidence intervals.  Statistical significance will be evaluated using Fisher’s exact test.   
Specific Aim 2:  To measure and compare levels of pro-osteoclastogenic factor IL-1β, bone formation 
marker P1NP, and bone resorption marker serum C terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (s-CTX) in 
   
Christina V. Oleson, MD 
Zoledronic Acid in acute spi[INVESTIGATOR_648301] #11F.[ADDRESS_868606] to control subjects whose resorption marker levels will be significantly above the 
reference range at all of the time points.   
The secondary hypothesis  is that levels of serum marker of bone formation P1NP will not be lower than 
controls at 4 and 12 months.  
Analysis: We will again use mixed effects linear regression to model each marker at 1, [ADDRESS_868607]-specific intercept. At months 4 and 12, we will estimate mean group-specific biomarker 
levels and associated 95% confidence intervals and test for treatment group differences. Since IL-1β will 
only be measured at baseline and one month, we will use analysis of covariance to compare group 
averages at one month adjusted for baseline measures.   
Specific Aim 3:  To determine the safety and tolerability of early administration of intravenous zoledronic 
acid in persons with acute SCI. We expect to see only minor, transient side effects from zoledronic acid.  
To evaluate this we will test the hypotheses  that compared to controls, subjects treated with zoledronic 
acid will have (3a) an increased incidence of myalgias, fever, gastrointestinal disturbances, and flu-like 
symptoms over the three days after infusion of study drug; (3b) be less likely to participate in physical 
and occupational therapy during the first week after infusion, and (3c) be less likely to want the treatment 
again.    
Analysis: For each outcome, we will estimate group-specific rates (proportions) along with exact 
binomial confidence intervals. Comparisons between groups will be performed using Fisher’s exact test.

1. Introduction  
 
1.1 Study Background 
 
1.1.1  Peripheral Artery Disease 
 
Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is the third leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity, following coronary artery disease and stroke 
1,2. PAD occurs with the progression of atherosclerosis in lower extremity arteries. 
Patients with PAD classically present with claudication, but can also present with decreased exercise capacity and progressive functional impairment 
3-6. These symptoms are thought to result from the 
following potential mechanisms: lower extremity atherosclerosis and arterial obstruction leading to skeletal muscle ischemia and impaired cellular metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction leading to the production of reactive oxygen species as well as free radicals, and subsequent endothelial dysfunction leading to impaired vasodilation and decreased hyperemia in the setting of increased metabolic demand 
3-5. 
 The goals of therapy for PAD patients are to maximize their exercise capacity, improve their functional status, and improve their quality of life 
5-9. The standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_905239]-
based exercise therapy and revascularization  if indicated 5-9. The exercise protocol for PAD patients that is 
recommended by [CONTACT_905245]: walk at a constant speed (on a treadmill if possible) until there is mild to moderate 
claudication, rest until the pain has completely ceased, resume walking at the same speed, and increase the 
speed when one can walk [ADDRESS_1270671] the potential to promote behavior changes that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_905240]

 1.2 Study Rationale and Aim  
 
The Effectiveness of D Aily Step-based Exercise Therap Y Using FITness Monitors for Peripheral Artery 
Disease ( EASY FIT ) Trial will be a single -center prospective non -inferiority randomized controlled trial 
comparing the efficacy of a novel [ADDRESS_1270672] 
guideline -recommended symptom- based exercise program, on improving walking ability in patients with 
symptomatic lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) . We will enroll and randomize [ADDRESS_1270673] guideline -recommended  symptom -based exercise program, we hypothesize that a 
daily step -based exercise program using fitness monitors will be non -inferior in improving walking ability 
and quality of life for patients with symptomatic lower extremity PAD. We also hypothesize that a daily step-based exercise program will be safe and feasible.  
 1.3 Study Benefits and Risks  
 1.3.1  Study Benefits  
 
The potential benefits of a daily step -based exercise program include increased walking ability and exercise 
capacity (as demonstrated by [CONTACT_905246]), decreased sedentary time, improved quality of life, improved cardiovascular health, and improved general health.  
 
1.3.2  Study Risks  
 
The potential risks of a daily step -based exercise program and a symptom -based home exercise program are 
exercise- induced events:  physical injury, myocardial infar ction, and sudden cardiac arrest. The risk of a 
myocardial infarction during a cardiac rehabilitation exercise program is approximately 0.[ZIP_CODE]% or [ADDRESS_1270674] during a cardiac rehabilitation 
exercise program is approximately 0.[ZIP_CODE]% or [ADDRESS_1270675] 2016, we were awarded an NC TraCS Pi[INVESTIGATOR_136886] (#2KR821606) for the execution of this study.

4.1 Screening , Enrollment, and Randomization  
 
The study investigators will identify patients with an ABI of < 0.9, screen these patients for eligibility, and 
notify the physician(s) of any eligible patient(s). The physician(s) will inform the eligible patient(s) about 
the study and ask the patient(s) for permission to have the study investigators meet the patient(s) at their 
next clinic visit. The study investigators will meet with these patients; discuss the study objective, process, 
benefits, risks, and alternatives; and obtain written informed consent and HIPAA authorization. Once the patients have provided written informed consent and HIPAA authorization, they will be enrolled into the study and randomized.

• Rest until the pain has completely ceased  
• Resume  walking at the same speed  
• Increase the speed when you can walk 8 minutes without stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_905242]  
• Continue this exercise routine for [ADDRESS_1270683] on health  
26.

• Weeks 5 -12: walk at least 5,000 steps every day.  
 
4.3 Follow -up 
 
The study follow -up period will be 14 weeks. Week 1 will be a baseline assessment period during which 
we obtain baseline data. Weeks 2 through 13 will be the period of the study intervention. Week 14 will be 
the endpoint assessment period during which we obtain endpoint data . 
 
Week 1  
Discussed i n Section 5.1 (Study Assessments, Baseline Assessment  Period)  
 
Weeks 2 to 13  
Every 4 weeks of the 12 -week exercise program:  the study investigators will conduct both chart review 
and phone calls for all enrolled patients to assess for any drop- out criteria and adverse events. In addition, 
the study investigators will instruct patients regarding any concerning symptoms that should be reported to 
the study team or should require emergent medical attention (by [CONTACT_3379] 911). In order to assess compliance 
to the study protocol, all patients will transmit data from their fitness monitors to their online Fitbit accounts every 4 weeks.

these extended periods o f time will be at the patients’ discretion.  
 
At the end of Week 1:  the study investigators will conduct both chart review and phone calls for all enrolled patients to assess for any drop- out criteria and adverse events. In addition, the study investigator s 
will instruct patients regarding any concerning symptoms that should be reported to the study team or should require emergent medical attention (by [CONTACT_3379] 911). Both groups will transmit the data from their 
fitness monitors to their online Fitbit accounts. Finally, both groups will also complete quality of life 
surveys (PAQ and VascuQol).   Prior to starting the Week [ADDRESS_1270685]. The study investigators will 
ask the patients’ treating interventional cardiologist 1 week after the procedure to verify the patients’ 
clearance for full activity, and then call the patients with instructions to start the Week [ADDRESS_1270686] one 
extended period of time on a daily basis. Given that this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] a novel exercise program in PAD patients, the  duration and frequency of these extended periods of time will be at the patients’ discretion.  
 At the end of Week 14:  the study investigators will conduct both chart review and phone calls for all 
enrolled patients to assess for any drop- out criteria and  adverse events. In addition, the study investigators 
will instruct patients regarding any concerning symptoms that should be reported to the study team or 
should require emergent medical attention (by [CONTACT_3379] 911). Both groups will transmit the data from their fitness monitors to their online Fitbit accounts. Finally, both groups will also complete quality of life surveys (PAQ and VascuQol).  
 
 
    
 
     
 
     
 
 
6. Statistical Analysis  
 
The primary endpoint of the mean daily walking distance (in steps) over [ADDRESS_1270687] 
deviation of 161 (VanWormer J, Boucher J, Pronk N, Thoennes J. Lifestyle behavior change and coronary 
artery disease: effectiveness of a telephone- based  counseling program. J Nutr Educ Behav. 2004 Nov -Dec; 
36(6):333 -4.). With a sample size of [ADDRESS_1270688] 90% power to demonstrate 
noninferiority of the intervention group (difference in mean improvement of - 350 steps, which is within the  
margin of noninferiority) . 
 The mean difference in the mean daily walking distance  between the study groups will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_183729], controlling for baseline mean daily walking distances. All outcomes will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_7586]-to- treat.  
   
 
7. Data Management  
 
In order to protect patient confidentiality, we will abide by [CONTACT_905248] . 
 
All paper data will be stored in a study binder that will be stored and locked in a locker. Only the study personnel listed on this IRB protocol will have access to the study binder, and the key to the locker for the study binder.  
 
All electronic data will be stored in an online project database which is a secured web- based application. 
Only the study personnel  listed on this IRB protocol will be authorized users for the project database, and 
will have access to the project database.  
 
We will use online randomization software to generate a random numeric code for each patient. Patient identifying data (specifica lly name, date of birth, medical record number, telephone number, and Fitbit 
serial number) will be stored only as electronic data on a single form in the online project database. The random numeric code for each patient will be documented on this single f orm with the patient identifying 
data. This single form will be the key to the random numeric codes, and will be stored separately from the research data. Only the study personnel listed on this IRB protocol will have access to this key. The rest of the online forms will use the random numeric codes to identify patients. All paper forms will use the random numeric codes to identify patients. All online Fitbit accounts will use the random numeric codes to identify patients.  
 
Only the individuals listed on the IRB protocol  will have access to any study data (the study binder in the 
locker , the online Fitbit accounts, and the study database).  
 At the completion of the data analysis, all online data will be destroyed and all paper data will be disposed in the HIPAA- protected waste bins.  
      
 
 
8. Study Conduct  
 
8.1 Public Availability  
 
Per the NC TraCS  Regulatory Core, the study information for this clinical trial will be posted on the 
publicly available clinical trial database www.ClinicalTrials.gov.  
 
8.2 Ethical Considerations  
 
The study will be conducted in accordance with ICH Good Clinical Practice guidelines and ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki 2008 including:  
 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and approval  
Prior to initiating the study, the investigators w ill obtain approval from the  IRB.  
 
Written informed consent  
Each screened patient will be informed about the study aim, procedures, benefits, risks, and consequences. Each enrolled patient will provide his or her written informed consent which will be stored in the study binder.  
 
Written HIPAA authorization  
Each screened patient will be informed about the study procedures of reviewing his or her medical record throughout the study. Each enrolled patient will provide his or her written HIPAA authorization which will be stored in the study binder.  
 
8.3 Data an d Safety Monitoring  
 
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee will not be necessary for this study because of the small size 
of the study population, the very small probability of adverse risk to the study population, and the very favorable benefit -to-risk profile of the study.  
 
Subjects walking outdoors will be exposed to conditions like steep inclines, hot weather, rainy weather, snowy weather, and ice. These conditions may increase the risk of injury or adverse events. We will advise and strongly recommend patients to avoid walking in any of these these conditions (steep inclines, hot weather, rainy weather, snowy weather, and ice). We will ask patients to seek emergent medical attention by [CONTACT_3379] [ADDRESS_1270689] injury or an adverse event.  
 
8.4 Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_905243] (a daily step- based exercise program) is 
associated with an increased risk of adverse events and/or harm to patients.

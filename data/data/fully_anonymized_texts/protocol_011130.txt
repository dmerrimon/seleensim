Oral Ondansetron versus Transdermal Granisetron (Sancuso)  for  
Women with Cervical , Endometrial  or Vaginal Cancer s Receiving Pelvic Chemoradiation

1.0  OBJECTIVES  
 
 1.1 Primary Objective  
1.1.1  To measure response rates to anti -emetic therapy (no emetic or retching 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_574555]) in the late onset phase (days 4 -7) of 
Granisetron (Sancuso) administered via a transdermal patch compare d to orally 
administered Ondansetron in women with cervical , endometrial or vaginal cancer 
undergoing chemoradiation therapy.  
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
1.2.1  To measure response rates to anti -emetic therapy (no emetic or retching 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_574555]) in the acute (0 -24 hours) phase of 
Granisetron administered via a transdermal patch compared to orally 
administered Ondansetron in women with cer vical, endometrial or vaginal cancer 
undergoing chemoradiation therapy.  
1.2.2  To measure response rates to anti -emetic therapy (no emetic or retching 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_574555]) in the delayed (24 -72 hours) phase of 
Granisetron administered v ia a transdermal patch compared to orally 
administered Ondansetron in women with cervical , endometrial  or vaginal  cancer 
undergoing chemoradiation therapy.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_754110] of nausea/vomiting on quality of life with 
Granisetron administered via a transdermal patch compared to orally 
administered Ondansetron in women with cervical endometrial  or vaginal cancer 
undergoing chemoradiation therapy.  
1.2.5 To determine if Granisetron administered via a transdermal pa tch compared to 
orally administered ondansetron results in less dose reductions of cisplatin in 
women with cervical , endometrial  or vaginal  cancer undergoing chemoradiation 
therapy.  
1.2.6 To measure amount of “rescue medication” for chemotherapy -induced nausea 
and vomiting ( CINV ) during chemoradiotherapy in women with cervical , 
endometrial  or vaginal  cancer undergoing chemoradiation therapy taking 
Granisetron administered via a transdermal patch compared to orally 
administered Ondansetron.  
 
 1.[ADDRESS_754111].  
Therefore, we hypothesize that women undergoing chemoradiation therapy and 
receiving the continuous administration of a 5HT3 blocker via the patch 
(Sancuso) will have less diarrhea than those receiving only 72 hou rs of 
scheduled oral 5HT3 blockers (ondansetron)  
 
2.[ADDRESS_754112] shown that platinum -based chemotherapy given with radiation therapy in the treatment of cervical 
cancer improves disease -free and overall survival when compared with radiotherapy alone (1-3).  As a 
result of these studies, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in [ADDRESS_754113] 12, 2015

in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer (4).  Based on these data showing improved survival 
for patients  with cervical cancer  receiving concurrent cisplatinum with pelvic radiation , most providers 
have begun adding cispltinum to pelvic radiation for patients with vaginal cancer.  AT MD Anderson, we 
frequently prescribe concurrent cisplatinum with pelvic radiation for women with vaginal cancer as part of 
our standard of care. In these women with vaginal  cancer receiving chemoradiation, the cisplatinum 
dosage and schedule as well as the radiation treatment plan are the same as in women with cervical 
cancer.  In addition to chemoradiation therapy as primary or adjuvant therapy for patients  with cervical and 
vaginal cancer s, combination cisplatinum and pelvic radiotherapy are commonly used in the adjuvant 
setting for intermediate and high risk patients with endometrial cancer after hysterectomy and staging.  In 
these women with endometrial c ancer receiving adjuvant chemoradiation, the cisplatinum dosage and 
schedule as well as the radiation treatment plan are also the same as in women with cervical and vaginal 
cancer s. 
Unfortunately, cisplatin, the agent most commonly administered with radiat ion therapy, is a well -known 
emetogenic agent.  In a recent phase II study of cisplatin with radiotherapy in women with cervical or 
endometrial  cancer, 100% reported symptoms of nausea with over two -thirds experiencing grade 2 or 3 
toxicity (5).  The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) lists cisplatin among the “highly 
emetogenic agents” causing chemotherapy induc ed nausea and vomiting (CINV) in over 90% of patients 
who do not receive antiemetic therapy after drug infusion.  The current recommendations from the NCCN 
for women receiving cisplatin is to start an anti -emetic therapy prior to starting chemotherapy and to 
continue for at least [ADDRESS_754114] 4 days.  
 
At MD Anderson Cancer Center  and Lyndon B. Johnson General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (LBJ) , we typi[INVESTIGATOR_574556] a 5HT3 blocker to start with chemotherapy and continue the medication on a 
scheduled “around the clock” regimen for three days after chemotherapy administration  (institutional  
standard of care) . However, up to 27.5% o f women receiving chemotherapy will report nausea or emesis 
on the fourth day after chemotherapy and another 16.5% will report these symptoms on the fifth day after 
administration (6) (late onset nausea/vomiting) when scheduled anti -emetic therapy has been 
discontinued.  In addition, women receiving cisplatin as part of their treatment for cervical , endometrial  or 
vaginal  cancer do so every 7 days which means they are scheduled to take antiemetic treatment for 3 
days out of every week.  This frequent self -administration of anti -emetic medications only adds to the 
treatment burden these women are undergoing.  
 
Recently, a new formulation of granisetron in extende d release patch (Sancuso) has been shown to be 
equivalent to scheduled oral administration of ondansetron (Zofran).  Instead of thrice daily oral 
administration of this 5HT3 blocker, Sancuso provides nausea relief with a single patch that is changed 
every [ADDRESS_754115] less late onset nausea and vomiting (days 4 -7) when given Sancuso when 
compared to oral ondansetron (Zofran) administration.  In addition, we believe that patients will have 
much higher compliance and satisfaction with the once weekly patch formulation of ondansetron when 
compared with the thrice daily oral administration.  
 
Two studies have evaluated transdermal vs oral granisetron.  The first was a randomized phase II study 
of 210 patients with cancer undergoing moderately ematogenic chemotherapy.  There was no difference 
in total and complete control of nausea, severity of nausea and vomiting or number of emetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_574557] (<72 hours after chemotherapy). The  most common side effect was headache (3.4% in 
granisetron patch group, 4.7% in oral granisetron group) and only 1 patient in the granisetron patch group 
had the patch fall off. The second study was a phase III randomized control study of oral vs. transder mal 
granisetron in 641 patients undergoing moderately or highly ematogenic chemotherapy. There was no 
difference between the two groups in the control of nausea and vomiting in the acute phase (i.e. <[ADDRESS_754116] 12, 2015  
4 
 
hours after chemotherapy). Constipation was the more common side effect in the patch group (6.6% of 
patients compared to 3.1% in the oral group.  
 
Chemoradiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin as treatment for cervical or endometrial cancer is an ideal 
model for a phase III trial of an extended release delivery  system of anti -emetic therapy (i.e. Sancuso 
patch) for the following reasons:  
 
1. CINV from cisplatin is severe and lasts up to 7 days after chemotherapy administration.  
2. Cisplatin is administered on a weekly basis making 72 hours of scheduled oral antiemetic  
therapy 3 day s out of every week burdensome.  
3. Cisplatin with external beam radiation therapy is only given for 5 weeks establishing a 
definitive endpoint t o rotate subjects off protocol.  
4. Cervical cancer is a disease that effects women , and female gender in creases risk of 
CINV (7). In addition, the median age at diagnosis is younger than for most other 
cancers.  Young age is also a risk factor for increased CINV (7). 
5. Cervical cancer typi[INVESTIGATOR_574558] -emetic drug regimens may be 
an issue, which could adversely impact delivery of curative therapy.

week of starting chemoradiation therapy . 
 
 3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
3.2.1 Women with cervical endometrial , vaginal cancer  who are receiving 
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for recurrent disease.  
3.2.2  Women with cervical , endometrial  or vaginal cancer who are receiving extended 
field radiation therapy  
3.2.3  Women with cervical , endometrial  or vaginal  cancer who are receiving 
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy in a palliative setting.

4.0 THERAPEUTIC PROGRAM  
 
This phase III study will randomize eligible patients with cervica l, endometrial or vaginal cancer 
undergoing chemoradiation therapy (see above  for eligibility  criteria) to receive either 34.3 mg of 
granisetron formulated in a transdermal patch (Sanc uso) replaced every 7 days (Group  A) OR 8 
mg of ondansetron orally thrice daily starting with cisplatin administration and continued for 72 
hours afte r chemotherapy infusion (Group  B).  Patients may not be enrolled on study if they have 
already started  their chemotherapy  treatment  or have recei ved more than 7 days of radiation prior 
to starting their chemotherapy .   
   
In addition, data on compliance/ease of administration, amount of nausea and vomiting, and 
effect of nausea and vomiting on quality of life will also be collected.  These data will be collected 
weekly via self -administered questionnaires that are estimated to take < [ADDRESS_754119] 12, 2015

Study Drug and Dosage Schedule  
 
Group  A: 34.3 mg of granisetron formulated in a transdermal patch (Sancuso) replaced every [ADDRESS_754120] the transdermal patch placed/replaced prior to the IV infusion of cisplatin.  
At cycle 1, patients will receive IV ondansetron 8 mg prior to IV cisplatin .  Administration of 
transdermal patch will be at the start of IV cisplatin.  For subsequent cycles, replacement of 
transdermal patch will start during the pre medication  period of IV cisplatin.  
Group  B: [ADDRESS_754121] order sets and physician discretion.  
 
 
4.1 Evaluation During Study  
 All treatments will o ccur within one week time frame  +/- 3 days to allow for scheduling.  
The patient will be given pi[INVESTIGATOR_574559]/or Odansetron, rescue 
medications, and anti -diarrheal medications.  Adverse event monitoring and concomitant 
medications will be recorded prior to each c ycle and one week after the last cycle. QOLs 
will be completed prior to each cycle and  one week after the last cycle.   Lab work and 
chemoradiation will be ordered at the discretion of the treating physician.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_754122] 5 cycles or until the patient withdraws (Section 8.0) , whichever comes 
first.  The patient may continue to receive further chemoradiation  after 5 cycles  at the 
discretion of the treating physician;  however, the patient will be taken off treatment  after 5 
cycles.  
 
The transdermal patch and Ondansetron should be continued  as scheduled  even if the IV 
Cisplatin is held.

5.0  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
This is a randomized trial to compare oral Ondansetron  (OO) and Granisetron patch (GP) for 
control of delayed nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemoradiation for the treatment 
of locally advanced cervical , endometrial or vaginal cancer.  The primary outcome is response to 
anti-emetic therapy (no emetic or retching epi[INVESTIGATOR_574555]) in days [ADDRESS_754129] cycle of chemotherapy.  
 
Patients will be randomized between O O and GP using a Bayesian adaptiv e algorithm . (8)  
Technical details of this methodology are given in the “Technical Details” section below.  The first 
[ADDRESS_754130] a treatment failure rate of 
0.2750. (6) With treatment GP we hope to improve the treatment failure rate to 0.1375  (i.e., 
reduce the treatment failure rate by [CONTACT_2016]) .  
 
Beginning with the 76th patient  the trial will be stopped early and a treatment selected as being 
“superior” if the probability is 0.9 25 or more than  one treatment’s failure rate is lower than the 
other treatment’s failure rate.  If all 1 50 patients are enrolled, then a treatment will be selected as 
being  “superior” if the probability is 0.9 15 or more than one treatment’s failure rate is lower than 
the other treatment’s failure rate.  In addition, accrual to a treatment arm will be suspended if the re 
is less than a 0.[ADDRESS_754131] to be able to reach 
this conclusion with an average of 35.4 + 61.9 = 97.[ADDRESS_754132] to be able to reach this conclusion with 
an average of 48.9 + 49.2 = 98.[ADDRESS_754133] cycle of therapy with a 95% credible 
interval.  
 
We will estimate with 95% confidence intervals the treatment failure rates for each treatment  arm 
during the first 24 hours (acute p hase ) and during the 24 -72 hour period  (delayed p hase ) of each  
cycle of therapy.  We will similarly estimate the treatment failure rates during the late onset phase 
for each cycle following cycle [ADDRESS_754134] 12, 2015  
8 
 
We will tabulate the responses to the 4 items of the Morisky Medication Adherence (Compliance) 
measure for each treatment group  by [CONTACT_574562] . We will compare th e [ADDRESS_754135].  We will use 
descriptive statistics to summarize the elements of the Morrow Assessment of Nausea and 
Emesis (MANE Scale) and for pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685]/complianc e for each treatment group  by [CONTACT_574563] . We will also use repeated measures analysis of variance methods to model compliance 
over all cycles of therapy.  
 
We will use descriptive statistics to summarize the total scores for the Osoba Module, used to 
measure the effect of nausea and vomiting on quality of life, for each treatment group  by [CONTACT_574563] . We will compare the treatment groups with respect to the Osoba Module score with a 
Mann -Whitney test. We will also tabulate the responses to each of  the [ADDRESS_754136] of nausea and vomiting on quality of life over all cycles of therapy.  
 
We will use descriptive statistics to summarize the number and amount of dose reductions for 
each treatment group for each cycle of therapy. We will also use repeated measures analysis of 
variance methods to model the number and amount of dose reductions over all cycles of therapy.  
We will sim ilarly analyze the number and doses of rescue medications and the amount of 
diarrhea experienced over the course of therapy.  
 
Technical Details  
We assume a beta ( 1.1, 2.9) prior distribution for the treatment failure rate for each treatment.  
This prior distribution has a mean of 0.[ADDRESS_754137] accrued.  
 
Let FOO and FGP be the treatment failure  rates for treatments “Oral Ondansetron ” (OO) and 
“Granisetron Patch”  (GP) , respectively.  Prior to enrolling the 40th and subsequent patients we will 
calculate the randomization probability as follows. We will first calculate  πGP (data) = Pr(F GP < F OO 
| data) and πOO (data) = 1 –  πGP(data).  The randomization probability for GP will then be defined 
as 𝑟𝐺𝑃=√𝜋𝐺𝑃
√𝜋𝐺𝑃+√𝜋𝑂𝑂  , and the randomization probability for OO will be  𝑟𝑂𝑂=1− 𝑟𝐺𝑃. 
 
Accrual to treatment arm OO will be suspended if Pr(F OO < 0.225 | data) < 0.10. Similarly, accrual 
to treatment arm GP will be suspended if Pr(F GP < 0.225 | data) < 0. 10. If at any point during the 
trial πGP (data) > 0.9 25 (< 0.0 75) the trial will be terminated and treatment “Granisetron Patch” will 
be selected as superior (inferior).  If the maximum number of patients is enrolled in the trial and 
πGP (data) > 0.9 15 (< 0.0 85) treatment “Granisetron Patch” will be selected as superior (inferior).

patient’s source/chart and followed to satisfactory resolution or until the local  Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -Investigator deems the event to be chronic or the patient to b e stable. 
The description of the AE will include the onset date, , date of resolution, severity, 
seriousness, , and the likelihood of relationship of the AE to study treatment.  
 
Severity  of adverse events will be graded using the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0(CTC AE v4.0) ,  
 
If an adverse event occurs which is not contained in the CTC AE v4.0 , the five -point scale 
below will be used:  
 
1. Mild: discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity.  
2. Moderate: discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect daily activity.  
3. Severe: inability to work or perform normal daily activity  
4. Life Threatening: represents an immediate threat to life  
5. Death  
 
7.[ADDRESS_754141] common  adverse events from stu dy treatment include:  
 Constipation  
 Diarrhea  
 Nausea  
 Headache  
 Drowsiness/tiredness  
7.[ADDRESS_754142] value abnormalities will not be reported as AEs, unless there is an 
associated clinical condition for which the patient is given treatment, concomitant 
treatment is altered or the event is considered a serious adverse event.  
 
 7.4  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
An SAE is defined as any event that:  
 Results in death  
 Is immediately life threatening  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require

judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Reporting requirements:  
 
Any AE considered serious or w hich meets the previous criteria must be reported to the 
study chair within one business day from the time that study personnel first become 
aware of the serious adverse event.  
 
All reported SAEs (related or not to the treatment ) will be followed until sat isfactory 
resolution or until the attending physician deems the event to be chronic or the patient to 
be stable. SAEs will be reported till [ADDRESS_754144] treatment. , unless the  AE m eets the criteria as described 
above.  
All AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded as an AE  in the patient’s 
source/chart. Information to be collected includes:  
 Type of event  
 Onset  
 Investigator -specified assessment of severity and relationship to treatment  
 Resolution of the event  
 Grade  
 Any required treatment or evaluations  
 
Adverse events result ing from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, 
reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be 
recorded. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution. Any medical condition that is 
present at the tim e that the patient is screened but does not deteriorate should not be 
reported as an AE. However, if it deteriorates at any time during the study it should be 
recorded as an AE.  
7.[ADDRESS_754145] non -leading question to obtain any 
medicall y related changes in their well -being. In addition to patient or Investigator 
observations, AEs will be documented from any data collected (e.g., laboratory values, 
physical examination findings) , or other documents that are relevant to patient safety.  
7.7 ASSESSMENT OF CA[LOCATION_003]LITY  
The Investigator’s assessment of an AE's relationship to treatment is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in 
the study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event 
should be reported.  
 
The relationship or association  to the AE will be characterized using the following 
classification and criteria:  
 Unrelated:  This relationship suggests that there is no association between the 
treatment and the reported event.  
 Possible:  This relationship suggests that treatment caused or contributed to the AE, 
i.e. the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of treatment 
and/or follows a known response pattern to the treatment , but could also have been 
produced by [CONTACT_1604].  
[ADDRESS_754146] 12, 2015  
12 
 
 Probable:  This relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the 
event with drug administration exists and the likely association of the event with the 
treatment . This will be based upon the known or previously reported complications to 
the treatment , or judgment based on the Investigator’s clinical experience.  
 Definite: This relationship suggests that a definite causal r elationship exists between 
the treatment  and the AE, and other conditions (concurrent illness, 
progression/expression of disease state, or concurrent medication reaction) do not 
appear to explain the event.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_754147] to follow up will also be documented.  
 
Patients will be informed that, should they withdraw from the study, they should remain under the 
care of an appropriately experienced physician until the physician deems further follow -up 
unnecessary.  
 
The following are circumstances for which a patient would be identified as not contin uing her 
participation in the study:  
 Study Completed / Terminated  
 Death  
 Voluntary Withdrawal  
 Unable to Return  
  physician discretion  
 Intolerable toxicity  
 Other  
 
If a patient relocates to another geographic area, which requires a change of physician, 
reasonable attempts will be made to locate and request cooperation from that physician in order 
to complete follow -up.  
 
In many instances patient withdrawal from the study constitutes a cessation of treatment. In these 
cases, permission should be obtained from patients by [CONTACT_574565] (relapse, survival, toxicity etc .) via patient records as this is a crucial component of 
the s tudy for which co nsent was originally obtained.  
  
[ADDRESS_754148] of the trial.  
9.1 CONFIDENTIALITY  
All records will be kept in a secure storage area with limited access. Clinical information 
will not be released without the written permission of the patient or the patient’s guardian, 
except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_12721], or the I RB.  
 
The Investigator and all employees and co -workers involved with this study shall not 
disclose or use for any purpose, other than performance of the study, any data, records 
or other unpublished, confidential information disclosed to those individuals  for the 
purpose of the study.  
9.[ADDRESS_754149] be submitted in writing to the Investigator’s IRB for approval prior to 
patients being enrolled into an amended protocol.  
 
9.3 INFORMED CONSENT  
A written informed consent shall be obtained from each patient prior to the patient’s 
entrance into the study. Before recruitment and enrolment, each prospective patient will 
be given a full explanation of the study and be allowed to read the approved info rmed 
consent form. The Investigator will inform the patient of the purpose of the study, 
randomization of study groups and the follow -up schedule.  The Investigator will discuss 
foreseeable risks involved, as well as potential benefits that result from the  treatment . 
The Investigator will inform the patient that her medical records will be subject to rev iew 
by [CONTACT_574566], and by [CONTACT_1201].  
 
The patients will be informed by [CONTACT_574567] a nd, if they choose to participate, that they may withdraw from the study at

[ADDRESS_241276] hyperbilirubinemia (cholestasis) in late preterm and term infants with major 
gastro -intestinal (GI) surgical disorders such as gastros chisis  omphalocele, volvulus, TE fistula, 
duodenal atresia, j ejunal atresia, ileal atresia, hirschsprung’ s disease, anorectal malformation, intestinal 
obstruction and GI perforations requiring surgery . Infants with major GI surgical disorders  as 
mentioned above  will be randomized to receive 1gm/kg/day or 2gm/kg/day of 20% intralipi[INVESTIGATOR_202193] 72 hours after birth. The study is not open to all surgical infants because infants with other 
surgical problems can be fed enterally within few days after sur gery and usually do not require TPN for 
prolong periods (> 2 weeks). Also infants with major GI surgical disorders have similar clinical course, 
undergo similar type of operative procedures , and have s imilar  complications  thus eliminating  
potential confo unding factors. The primary outcome measure is  the incidence rate of parenteral 
nutrition associated cholestasis (PNAC) . PNAC will be def ined as serum direct bilirubin ≥ 2mg/dl in 
the absence of other known causes of direct hyperbilirubinemia as described under exclusion criteria.  
 
 II. BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION: 
Since its introduction in the late 1960s, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has established itself as 
an effective mode for parenteral hyperalimentation  in patients with acute or chronic intestinal failure. 
Out of the many complications of parenteral nutrition, the most common is the cholestasis often referred to as Parenteral Nutrition Associated Cholestasis (PNAC). PNAC is defined clinically using 
[ADDRESS_241277] hyperbilirubinemia 
(see exclusion criteria).  The reported incidence of PNAC in neonates is as high as 84%. [1, 2]  
 PNAC was first described by [CONTACT_202210] [3] and has l ong been recognized as a 
major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates and infants. [4, 5]  PNAC can be associated with 
liver dysfunction, cirrhosis, and hepatic carcinoma. The proposed mechanisms that could explain 
cholestasis caused by [CONTACT_202211]. The major mechanisms include  
hemodynamic  modifications within the biliary system caused by [CONTACT_202212], 
bile stasis resulting from decreased stimulation of gastrointestinal hormones in the absence of any enteral intake, direct toxic effects of TPN components, premature biliary system, and bacterial 
overgrowth leading to overproduction of deconjugated bile acids. Very few observational studies  done 
earlier have looked at the association of PNAC with various nutritional components of TPN. The 
findings of these studies indicate that PNAC could be associated with increased duration of TPN  [6, 7]  
with almost all  infants develop ing PNAC by 6 weeks on TPN [8,9,10 ],  higher intake of amino acids 
[11], higher intake of dextrose, intake of trace elements like aluminium [12 ], copper and mangane se 
[13], and cumulative amount of intravenous lipid intake [14]. Several preventive trials have been 
conducted in neonates involving the use of different amounts of protein  intake or the use of choleretic 
medications in order to prevent cholestasis. Vileisis and colleagues [11] did not find any difference in 
the incidence of PNAC when they compared amino acid s intake of 2.3gm /kg/day vs. 3.6 gm/kg/day. 
Their findings  were reciprocated by [CONTACT_202213] [15] who found no difference in the incidence 
of PNAC when compar ing amino acids supplementation of 2.5 vs. 3.5gm/kg/day. Similarly, the use of 
both cholecystokinin ( CCK)  [16],  and ursodeoxycholic acid [ 17] failed  to prevent the development of 
PNAC. Majority of these preventive trials performed in  neonates defined PNAC as direct bilirubin 
≥2mg/d L after two weeks on PN [9, 11, 21]. Because these preventive trials failed to identify any 
[ADDRESS_241278] suggested in animal studies 
in 1993 when  La Scala et al. described that the addition of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_202194] [18 ]. Haynes et al. in 2002 published a series of hepatic pathology and described dose dependent 
hepatic changes with prolonged administration of lipid in premature baboons which included steatosis, 
cholestasis, and  proliferation of bile ducts [19]. Since then few observa tional studies in neonates have 
been performed and demonstrated that lipid intake is associated with PNAC. [7, 11] However, a cause and effect relationship between lipid intake and PNAC has not been established using a well -designed 
randomized clinical tri al.  We hypothesize that increased cumulative  amount of lipid intake causes 
PNAC in late preterm and term neonates with major GI surgical disorders. Our objective is to evaluate the effect of cumulative amount of lipid intake on the incidence of PNAC in this vulnerable population.   
 
 
III. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RESEARCH POPULATION 
 1. Number of Subjects:  This is a prospective randomized clinical trial involving 40 neonates with 
major GI surgical disorders requiring surgery .   
 2. Gender, Age, Race, and Ethnicity :  The University of [COMPANY_002]ster Medical Center (URMC) is a 
tertiary care center and consists of a 52 bed Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Annually, ~25 infants with major GI surgical disorders are admitted to the URMC. The NICU population is approximately 52% 
4 
Approved January 10 , 2019  male with a racial distribution of 64% White, 32% African -American, 2% Asian, and 2% other. The 
ethnic distribution is 75% non -Hispanic. The gender, race, and ethnicity distribution of this prospective 
study is expected to follow the distribution of the NICU population. 
 
3.  Inclusion Criteria : All neonates ≥ 34 weeks gestational age with major GI surgical disorders  
(gastroschisis , omphalocele , volvulus, trachea -esophageal  fistula, duodenal atresia, j ejunal atresia, ileal 
atresia, hirschsprung ’s disease, anorectal malformation, intestinal obstruction , and GI perforations ) 
requiring surgery  admitted to our NICU within first 72 hours will be eligible for this study.  
 
4. Exclusion Criteria: Neonates with the following condition will be excluded: 1) If does not 
need TPN by 72 hours; 2) Direct hyperbilirubinemia within the first 72 hours after birth; 3) TORCH 
infections (Toxoplasmosis, CMV, Herpes, Rubella, HIV , etc); 4) Biliary tract disorders leading to direct hyperbilirubinemia; 5) Known metabolic diso rders that may be associated with direct 
hyperbilirubinemia - such as Galactosemia, α-1 antitrypsin deficiency, etc.  
 
IV . METHODS AND PROCEDURES  
a) Study Design : This is a prospective randomized controlled trial s planned in order to  evaluate 
the incidence  rate of PNAC between 1gm/kg/day of 20% intralipid and 2 gm/kg/day of 20% 
intralipid in high- risk neonates ≥ 34 weeks gestational age (GA ). PNAC will be def ined as serum 
direct bilirubin ≥ 2mg/dl in the absence of other known causes of direct hyperbilirubinemia as 
described in the exclusion criteria .  
 b) Screening : All neonates ≥ [ADDRESS_241279] on an ongoing basis and not less 
than 3 times per week. The screening log will include GA, postnatal days, and type of GI surgical disorders, and whether or not the infant was enrolled in the study.  If not enrolled, the reason will be recorded. The number and demographic characteristics of eligible subjects not included will be collected to assess the rep resentation of the sample of subjects included.  
 c) Enrollment and Consent : Families will be approached by [CONTACT_202214].  Parental consent may be obtained any time during the first [ADDRESS_241280] will be assigned a unique study identification number by [CONTACT_202215]. 
d) Pre-randomization : Once the infant is enrolled in the study, one of the investigators will notify 
the Research Pharmacist (RP) by [CONTACT_202216] (8AM- 5PM) for 
registration and randomization. Information on weight of the infant will be provided to the RP for accurate dosing of intravenous lipid on each day.  
e) Registration : A log sheet of subjects registered with their names, study ID numbers, medical 
record number, dates of birth, and dates of randomization will be kept by [CONTACT_202217]  
f) Rando mization  will be to two arms: 1g/kg/day intravenous lipid or 2 g/kg/day for [ADDRESS_241281] bilirubin ≥ 2mg/dl (in the absence of sepsis) or reaches enteral feeds and no longer requires parenteral nutrition. A block randomization with 8 subjects in each block will be performed. Study group assignments will be made by [CONTACT_202218] a randomization scheme provided by [CONTACT_46134]. The assignment will be 1:1 ratio.   
6 
Approved January 10 , 2019  g) Route, Frequency, and Duration : The lipi[INVESTIGATOR_202195] 6 weeks or until reach one of the study end points (reach enteral feeds and 
no longer require parenteral nutrition or has direct bilirubin ≥ 2 mg/dl in the absence of sepsis). All enrolled infants including those randomized to 2 gm/kg/day intravenous lipid will be 
started at 1gm/kg/day of intravenous lipi[INVESTIGATOR_202196] [ADDRESS_241282] procedures. The daily intravenous lipid intake will be increased to 2 gm/kg/day in those randomized to 2gm/kg/day. The amount of proteins and glucose will be ordered as per the unit policy and at the discretion of the attending neonatologist.  
h) Dose Adjustments : Daily assessment of the weight will be performed by [CONTACT_202219]. Each day, the RP will inform the clinical care team of volume of intravenous lipid to be infused over the day. The clinical care team will complete the request in the E -record using the 
information provided by [CONTACT_202220].  
i) Subjects will receive glucose, protein, vitamins, and trace elements at the discretion of the  
attending neonatologist as per the standard of care.  The unit policy regarding nutrition is  to 
gradually increase protein intake to 3 to 4 gm/kg/day and intravenous glucose intake as 
tolerated to provide a caloric intake of 90 – 110 kcal/kg/day. Assuming the average intake of 120ml/kg/day of TPN, the predicted amount of caloric intake from the non-fat portion of the TPN would be ~ 90 kcal/kg/day (assuming protein intake of 3 to 4 gm/kg/day and an average dextrose concentration of 15% via the central line) . The clinical team will assume an average 
lipid intake of 1.5gm/kg/day for each enrolled infant during the period of the study which is equivalent to a caloric intake of  13.5 ± 4.5 kcal/kg/day from lipid intake . Thus the total caloric 
7 
Approved January 10 , 2019  intake for the infants in the study would be 90 + 13.5 ± 4.5 Kcal/kg/day or 103.5 ± 4.5 
Kcal/kg/day.  If the enrolled subject does not gain weight despi[INVESTIGATOR_202197], there will be room for increasing caloric intake by [CONTACT_202221] (either by [CONTACT_202222]). Increasing glucose intake for weight gain is the standard of care in our NICU while 
limiting lipid intake in neonates at risk for cholestasis.  
j) In case of hypertriglyceridemia, the unit protocol of intravenous lipid intake will be used and 
the RP will be notified . According to the unit policy, the Intravenous lipid intake will be halved 
when the serum triglycerides level is between 250 to 350 mg/dl and would be stopped when the serum triglycerides is >350 mg/dl . Once the hypertriglyceridemia has resolved, the assigned 
intravenous lipid intake will be resumed as per the randomization arm. The discontinuation of trace elements and the administration of choleretic medications will be done as per the unit policy. According to the unit policy, the use of trace elements will be discontinued if direct 
bilirubin is ≥ 2 mg/dl. Similarly, the unit policy is to add choleretic medications when direct  
bilirubin level is  ≥ 2 mg/dl. The care team will be requested to adhere to the se unit polic ies 
during the conduct of the study.  
k) 
Primary Outcome Measures: PNAC will be the primary outcome meas ure and will be defined as 
direct b ilirubin ≥ 2mg/dl developi[INVESTIGATOR_202198] 6 week 
randomization period in the absence of other known causes (discussed earlier).  Total serum bilirubin and direct bilirubin concentration will be measured once weekly as part of the standard of care when on paren teral nutrition . The direct bilirubin is usually measured until the 
resolution of direct hyperbilirubinemia as part of the standard of care. If parents have consented, we will collect blood that is leftover from blood draws that are done as part of standar d of care. 
8 
Approved January 10 , 2019  The blood samples will be stored in -80 degree freezer in the PI’s laboratory within the 
Department of Neonatology for possible future research on intravenous nutrition and its effects 
on the liver such as identifying a more sensitive biochemica l marker than direct bilirubin 
concentration of liver injury.  Samples will be stored with a study number only and will only be linked to the data collected for the purposes of this study. Only study team members will have access to the stored blood and wi ll be able to use the samples.  Future research on stored blood 
after completion of this study will only be conducted  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_202199].   
l) 
Secondary Outcome measures:  Secondary outcome measures will include peak direct bilirubin 
concentration s during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], use of choleretic medications and use of Omegavan  during 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_202200] 6 week study period.  
m) Data Safety Monitoring:  There are several reasons why independent data safety monitoring and 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_202201]:   
1) In this study, the outcome measure, direct hyperbilirubinemia >2.0mg/dL, is the potential 
side effect of interest secondary to intravenous lipid intake. A s per the standard of care, the 
intravenous lipid intake of 1-2 gm/kg/day is routinely used in the presence of direct hyperbilirubinemia  of 2 mg/dL to provide essential calories and prevent essential fatty acid 
deficiency . Usually, choleretic medications such as cholecystokinin are used to resolve 
PNAC  at this point.   
2) Our hypothesis is that the development of PNAC is causally related to the cumulative lipid 
intake, however, protein and glucose intake may  modify the association between lipid intake 
and PNAC . In addition, sepsis and prematurity are confounding risk factors. The sample 
size calculated (n=40) to evaluate the outcome measure (or the adverse event) accounts for 
the variable duration of the TPN (cumulative lipid intake) and presence of confounding risk factors . Therefore, meanin gful statistical analysis is not possible with an interim analysis  of 
less than 40 subjects.  
3) As suggested by [CONTACT_202223], a mean cumulative dose of 55 gm/kg (SD 15) of 
intravenous lipid is required before the development of PNAC  in late preterm and term 
9 
Approved January 10 , 2019  infants.  Thus, it is expected that an infant on 1gm/kg/day of intravenous lipid arm will take 
~ [ADDRESS_241283] bilirubin concentration is > 10 mg/dL  and is very rare. The 
randomization of intravenous lipid intake will be stopped long before severe PNAC may be 
seen among enrolled subjects.    
4) Performing interim analyses will require more stringent significance level which will increase the sample size required to perform the study. This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_202202]’s project for which 40 subjects are required for meaningful anal ysis of 
outcome (or adverse event)    
5) This study has been designed as a block randomization with each block having 8 subjects 
with 1:[ADDRESS_241284] 20 subjects (50%) hit the direct bilirubin 
endpoint, interim analysis is unlikely to allow meaningful analysi s of the causation between 
lipid intake and the outcome measure (or adverse event) as provided in the protocol. In other words, it is unlikely to reach adjusted statistical significance  required for interim analyses . 
Thus, since the outcome measure and the a dverse event are the same and the sample size 
required to evaluate the association (or the adverse event) controlling for other factors is  40, 
no interim analysis and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_202203].   F or trial 
management , the investigat ion team will track enrollment and protocol compliance and 
review every 3 months.  
 
V.  DATA COLLECTION :  The baseline data on demographics and clinical factors (antenatal and 
postnatal) before randomization on each subject will be collected. Similarly, data on clinical factors 
will be collected during the [ADDRESS_241285] develops PNAC (direct bilirubin ≥ 2 mg/dl in the absence of 
concurrent infec tion).   
The information on TPN  components, specifically amount of lipid, protein, and glucose intake 
on each day will be prospectively collected using pharmacy and TPN records.  Information on 
cumulative amount  of lipid intake , cumulative  amount of protein intake, and cumulative amount of 
glucose intake will be determined for all enrolled subjects. The additional information that will be collected is  duration (days) of TPN, use of trace elements, duration (days) of NPO, type of enteral feeds 
(maternal brea st milk vs. Formula) duration (days) of antibiotic use, onset and duration of choleretic 
medications, sepsis defined as blood culture positivity or clinical signs and symptoms of sepsis with the 
use of antibiotics for > 3 days, day of life when the infant reaches an enteral intake of 120 ml/kg/day, duration (days) of mechanical ventilation, duration of CPAP, duration of oxygen supplementation, and 
amount of  erythrocyte transfusions during the study period. However, use of chol eretic medications 
and discontinuation of  trace elements from the TPN is not expected during the study period based on 
the unit policy as delineated earlier.  
 
VI. SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION : Assuming a 4 -week median follow- up time and an incidence 
rate of 40% for [ADDRESS_241286] with an overall sample size of 40 
subjects (20 per group) achieves 80.0% power at a 0.[ADDRESS_241287] ratio of 3.6.

Approved January 10 , 2019  Kaplan -Meier (KM) estimates of survival function will be provided and compared between groups. 
Log-rank test will also be used to compare time to endpoint. Cox proportional hazards model will be 
fitted after controlling for covariates which are found to be imbalanced in preliminary analysis. 
Estimate of hazard ratio and associated confidence interval will be obtained.    
VII. DATA ANALYSES AND MONITORING :  
a) Randomization:  Upon successful completion of necessary screening assessments and being 
confirmed to be eligible by [CONTACT_093], subjects will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to two groups: 1) 1 
g/kg/day intravenous lipid  and 2) 2 g/kg/day intravenous lipid.  Each subjec t will be assigned a unique 
sequential subject number for identification throughout the entire course of the study. The subject number will not be reused for any other participant in the study. Subjects who are discontinued or withdrawn from the study prior to randomization will be replaced. In addition, subjects who are identified to have direct hyperbilirubinemia from causes other than parenteral nutrition or did not require parenteral nutrition for more than 2 weeks will be considered screen failure and will also be 
replaced.  We anticipate a total number of 52 subjects to participate in the study to complete the study on 40 subjects. During the study, the treatment assignments will be available only to the RP.    
c) Samples for Analysis:  The “Intent- to-Treat” sample includes all subjects who are randomized into 
the study. Subjects will be grouped according to the treatment to which they are randomized.  
d) Statistical Analyses: 
 General statistical Considerations:   
12 
Approved January 10 , 2019  All statistical analyses will be conducted using Version 10 of the SAS System for Windows 
(Copyright © 2002- 2003 SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003].) by a biostatistician. Descriptive statistics 
will be used to summarize outcomes by [CONTACT_6660].  For continuous variables, descriptive 
statistics will include the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, number of available 
observations, and number of missing observations. For discrete variables, descriptive statistics will include frequencies and percentages, number of available observations and numbers of missing observations.  
We will determine whether there are important baseline differences between the two groups 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_202204] (e.g., gender , race/ethnicity, GA at 
birth , SGA[<10
th percentile]). If any important differences are found, the primary analyses will be 
repeated after statistically adjusting for these differences. If distributional assumptions associated with 
a particular statistical procedure are violated, appropriate transformations will be made or non-parametric alternatives will be used (e.g., Wilcoxon rank sum tests in place of two -sample t -tests).  
Infants enrolled but subsequently found to meet exclusion criteria will be analyze d separately.  
The incidence rate of PNAC will be compared between the 2 groups using Kaplan Meier 
curves. Subjects who reach full enteral feeds before 6 weeks of study period will be censored. Kaplan -
Meier (KM) estimates of survival function will be provided and compared between groups. Log- rank 
test will also be used to compare time to endpoint. Cox proportional hazards model will be fitted after controlling for covariates which are found to be imbalanced in preliminary analysis. Estimate of hazard ratio and associated confidence interval will be obtained . 
The potential confounders are sepsis, use of choleretic medications and trace elements. 
Incidence of nosocomial sepsis has decreased remarkably over the last few years in our unit and with 
13 
Approved January 10 , 2019  randomization we do not anticipate significant group differences in the incidence of sepsis. The use of 
choleretic medications and discontinuation of trace  elements should occur after the development of 
primary outcome as per the unit policy and therefore these factors are unlikely to confound the relationship between the lipid intake and PNAC. 
 
VIII. DATA STORAGE AND CONFIDENTIALITY : We will use unique subj ect identification 
number to ensure confidentiality of data collected. The file  linking the study identification number with 
identifiers will be stored in a locked cabinet accessible only to the investigators. Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_202205] s tored in a locked cabinet. All links to subject identifiers will be decoded to 
protect privacy of subjects. The records will be kept for 5 years after completing the study and publication of the findings.   
IX. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
This prospective study has been designed to minimize the risks to the patients enrolled.  
Intravenous lipid intake in the range of 1- 2 gm/kg/day is commonly used in high-risk neonates  with 
major GI surgical disorders .  PNAC is a common side effect of parenteral nutrition. Although severe 
cholestasis is defined as direct bilirubin > 10 mg/dl [20] but for the purpose of the study to avoid any 
risk, we have defined our primary outcome measure as direct bilirubin ≥ 2 mg/dl. Infants  with direct 
bilirubin ≥ 2 mg/dl (reaching prim ary outcome) will no longer receive randomized lipid intake  and the 
clinical care team will be informed. The lipid intake will then be at the discretion of the attending neonatologist.   To protect privacy of subjects, all links to subject identifiers will  be decoded and 
subject data will be stored in locked cabinets.  
There is a potential  benefit to the study subjects  .The benefits to future babies involve more 
judicious administration of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_202206] l fatty

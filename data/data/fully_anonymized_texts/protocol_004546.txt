The theoretical foundations behind early mobility draws its roots from empi[INVESTIGATOR_163441] 
1950s where the interplay between physiology and psychology was investigated. A line of 
seminal works showed the cognitive processes that are ‘born’ and nurtured when toddlers 
begin to be mobile. The implications of immobility or inefficient mobility in toddlers with physical 
disabilities were particularly drawn to attention by [CONTACT_163457] 1980s when 
modified power wheelchairs (PWC) were trialed on toddlers. Early trials focused on tes ting 
whether toddlers can learn to use PMT, but as it became established that toddlers can indeed 
learn to use them, trials moved to measure changes in the child’s overall development, 
particularly their cognitive functioning and social skills.  
 
Over the p ast [ADDRESS_189739] under the spotlight. For typi[INVESTIGATOR_163442], the 
onset of self -produced locomotion has been recognized to induce positive  changes in their 
developmental processes  (Campos  et al. , 2000) . Toddlers are observed to learn key skills 
through mobile play and exploration, but in the presence of physical impairment, the same 
need for learning these skills through mobility may be hind ered. Conversely, children with 
physical limitations could instead be prone to a condition termed as ‘learned 
helplessness’, (Everland, 1984)  where they learn, instead, to be resigned to accept their 
environment and to no longer seek to influence it.  
 
“Children’s mastery of functional mobility skills has been classified and categorized in several 
ways . Hays (1987) examined current existing diag nostic conditions of children without 
locomotion and divided them into four functional groups ” (Wright -Ott, 2015, p.564) . 
 
1. Children who will never ambulate . 
This category includes children with cerebral palsy with severe involvement and spi[INVESTIGATOR_163443] I and II. Generally, these children have no opportunity for 
independent mobility.   
2. Children with inefficient mobility who ambulate but are unable to do so at a  
reasonable rate of speed or with acceptable endurance . 
This category includes ch ildren with cerebral palsy with less involvement and 
myelomeningoc ele with upper extremity involvement. For these children, assisted 
mobility may provide an efficient means of mobility above that which they are capable 
of producing themselves. Warren  (1990)  uses the term “marginal ambulator” for this 
group.   
3. Children who have lost their independent mobility . 
This category includes victims of trauma and children with progressive neuromuscular 
disorders. The developmental implications may be less critic al than in t he first two 
groups , and the issue is acceptance of assisted mobility as an adaptation to an 
acquired disability,   
4. Children who temporarily require assisted mobility and often progress to independent 
mobility with age . 
This category includes ma ny children with osteogenesis imperfecta and arthrogryposis. 
Functional considerations in this group are both developmental and practical.  
 
Children with mobility impairments, as categorized by [CONTACT_163458] (1987) may benefit from the use 
of a power mobility device for functional mobility (Wright -Ott, 2015, p. 564) Regardless of the 
etiology, pathology or prognosis of the condition that limits mobilit y, children may be able to 
achieve increased functional mobility, even independent mobility if consideration to other 
factors are taken into account. These factors include but are not limited to “purpose and goals 
for the use of the device, environments fo r intended use, child’s physical and psychosocial 
 
Human factors validation test protocol, version [ADDRESS_189740] -
benefit ratio ” (Wright -Ott, 2015, p. 564).  
 
There are significant differences among these groups that may have implications for mobility 
and its integration into the child’s overall concept of disability, as well as for evaluation and 
intervention. Group I children may achieve independent mobility t hrough the use of a support 
walker or power wheelchair. Group II children may be able to independently propel a manual 
wheelchair, ambulate in a support walker indoors, and use a power wheelchair for community 
mobility. Children in group III and IV will us e a variety of mobility methods during the transition 
period. (Wright -Ott, 2015, p.564).  
 
“Introduction of Power Mobility  Devices  (PMD) for some therapi[INVESTIGATOR_163444] -
based criteria while others look to a set of similarly arbitrary skills that indicate readiness. 
Researchers have been exploring how youn g children can begin using PM D. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_163445] [ADDRESS_189741] been successful using a PMD that 
utilized whole body movement rather than a joystick (Larin, Dennis, & Stansfield, 2012). 
Researchers at University of Delaware h ave had success with infants with and without 
disabilities initiating movement using joysticks at 7 months (Lynch et al., 2009), 11months 
(Ragonesi & Galloway, 2012) and 14 months -of-age (Galloway et al., 2008). Case studies 
describe children with age -appropriate cognitive skills using PM D competently as young as 17 
months (Zazula & Foulds, 1983), 20 months (Jones, McEwen, & Hansen, 2003), and 22 
months -of-age (Everard, 1984). Jones et al (2012) showed that 14 -30-month olds who had 
frequent access to a PMD in the home setting learned successful mobility skills in the presence 
of significant disability.” (Rosen, Plummer, Sabet, Lange, & Livingstone, 2018, p.4). Many 
practitioners believe that provision of a PMD  should be considered within the first year of li fe 
(Wright -Ott, 2015, p.563). However, current research suggests that children as young as [ADDRESS_189742] 
to reach to midline and engage in bilateral and unilateral reaching, graspi[INVESTIGATOR_163446]  (such as a joystick). They display adequate head and trunk extension to support 
themselves in an upright seated position (Parh am & Mailloux, 2015, p. 263). “Growing 
evidence indicates that these early motor experiences not only inform children about their own 
actions, but also the action of others” (Woodward, 2009). For an infant unable to be 
independent in self -initiated mobilit y, the opportunity to explore their environment by [CONTACT_163459] 
a midline -oriented device provides an inherently motivating means of control.  
 
PMD  for young children and toddlers has been evolving to provide an efficient option to assist 
mobile play and exploration; however, no PM D has been successfully marketed in large 
volumes before. The testing of the Explorer Mini  is an innovative and unique mo bility device 
that is well suited to provide an opportunity to assess an infant’s readiness to utilize a 
supported seat and midline control device to demonstrate self -initiated mobility.  
 
[ADDRESS_189743] will be performed in a clinical setting including participating children, their 
parents/guardians and physio therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] /occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (PT s/OTs) at three clinical 
sites in the [LOCATION_002] of America , post evaluation and approval from applicable Internal 
Institutional Review Board ( IRB). A clinical setting, while not fully reflective of a home 
 
Human factors validation test protocol, version [ADDRESS_189744]  2018    Page 5 of 10  environment is the typi[INVESTIGATOR_163447] (PTs /OTs ) have access to a variety of devices, and a means of creating a safe 
environment specific to  the child. The clinic is also the place where the child and 
parent/guardian in real world situation would be introduced to and trained on a mobility 
device.  
 
[ADDRESS_189745] participants represent the two populations  of intended users:  
 
Primary users – children with mobility impairments   
Secondary users – care-givers ( parents/guardians and PTs/OTs )  
 
4.1.1  Inclusion criteria  
 
Primary users:  
• Informed consent  signed  by [CONTACT_163460]  
• Aged 6 -36 months  
• Unable to  mobilize independently for exploratory play and peer interaction , as 
cathegorized by [CONTACT_163458] (1 987) 
• Adequate trunk and head control to remain upright in the  device, including regain head 
control  
• Adequate hand/ arm (distal) control to reach for objects in front of them  
 
Evaluation of children has traditionally focused on achievement of developmental milestones. 
However,  underlying impairments cannot fully explain the extent and form of functional 
difficulties seen in children with mobility impairments  (Coster, 1998). Additionally, "the tasks 
most relevant for functional mobility have not been well defined in traditional developmental 
milestone test" ( Wright -Ott, 2015, p. 564 ). In this test, all inclu ded children have a mobility 
impairment but for reasons described above,  no specific diagnosis is set as inclusion criteria 
for the primary user  and t he mobility impairment of the user will  depend on a variety of 
diseases, diagnoses , cognitive or functiona l disorders .  
 
Secondary users:  
• Signed informed consent  
• PT/OT or parent/guardian  of the child included in the test   
 
4.1.2  Exclusion criteria  
 
Primary users:  
• Weigh t >16 kg /35 Ibs  
• Length > 100 cm /39 In  
• Children that lack head control in such a severe manner that they cannot  regain control if 
it is lost  
• Children who do not show awareness of or respond to toys, objects, sounds and/or people 
in their environment  
• Any other reason , if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the individual user is not appropriate, 
or suitable for participation in the test.  
 
  
 
Human factors validation test protocol, version [ADDRESS_189746]  2018    Page 6 of 10  Secondary users:  
• Hearing/vision loss or limited cognitive skills impacting the ability to take instructions and 
perform the tasks of the test  
• Ability to understand oral and written English as product labelling will in this HF validation 
test only be available in English  
• Any other reason , if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the individual user is not appropriate, 
or suitable for participation in the test  
 
4.2 Sampling  
 
Because successful mastery of a power mobility device has been demonstrated with children 
over the age of 17 months, and children as young as 7 months demonstrate early skills 
necessary for power mobility the testing groups will be set at 6 -17 months and 18 -36 months. 
It is anticipated that children with supported trunk (proximal) control w ill have adequate hand/ 
arm (distal) control and inherent motivation and development to operate a midline -oriented  
control.  
 
Enrollment of eligible children  will be conducted to ensure 30 per protocol performed tests , 15 
children per age group.   
 
6 months – 17 months  15 children  
18 months – 36 months  15 children  
 
Along with the 30 children, their 30 parents/guardians will be actively participating in the study 
as well as their PT/OT. 
 
4.[ADDRESS_189747], recruiting 10 ch ildren/parent pairs each. The 
principal investigators will reach out to PTs/OTs , to identi fy children managed by [CONTACT_163461]/exclusion criteria of this test. A recruitment script may be used (see 
attachment 4).  It is expected that there is an established connection between the child and the 
PT/OT  already prior to this tes t.  
 
4.3.[ADDRESS_189748]. In the process of gaining informed consent, the child’s 
parents /guardian  and PT/OT  will receive in formation about the nature and objectives of the 
study, possible risks associated with their participation, their free choice of participating and 
leaving at any time, both in writing and orally. They will also have the  opportunity  to ask 
questions and be able to retain the information long enough to make an effective decision.   
 
[ADDRESS_189749]  
 
This is a descriptive, cross -sectional study to evaluate users’ interactions with and perceptions 
of the device user interface. This will be done in two major steps:  
• Observations of users´ performance of all critical and some non -critical tasks identified 
in the preliminary analyses and evaluations  (observational data)  
• Debriefing interview to collect the users´ perspective  of the device (interview data ) 
 
  
 
Human factors validation test protocol, version [ADDRESS_189750] is 
commercially available, be performed by a  PT/OT. Supplemental instructions will be given in 
the user ’s manual . In order to validate that the device is safe to use also without having 
received any training, the first observational part of the study will be performed in t hree steps.  
 
1. To simulate an initial encounter with the device for a PT/OT  where the device may be 
hand led without any  additiona l instruction s, the child’s PT/OT  will first perform the test 
tasks  untrained. The  PT/OT  will be provided with the User’s manual but may not be 
prompted to use it for written information of the product . 
 
2. In standard of care, after having learned how to use the device, a PT/OT  would show 
the parent/guardian how to operate the device. In step two, t he Principal Investigator  
[INVESTIGATOR_163448]/guardian  and the PT/OT  on the device (standard product training ) 
supported by [CONTACT_163462]’ manual.   
 
3. The parent/guardian performs  the test tasks, supported with the Users’ manual  and 
PT/OT or Principal Investigator .  
 
The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_163449]’s length supervision throughout all steps of the study 
to ensure the safety of all participants.  
 
5.1.1  Screening and enrolment  
 
After having obtained written inform ed consent from the participants  the Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_163450]  
(including weight and length measure) , and complete the upper part of the child test form, 
attachment 3, covering background information on the child .  
 
The enrolment  can, but does not need to , be done on the same day as the actual test.  
 
5.1.[ADDRESS_189751] – Observations  
 
1. The child’s PT/OT i s presented to the device  and it’s labelling  and is asked to:  
• connect the battery charger to the battery charging port,  and disconnect  it. 
• adjust the seat and table height so that they are  appropriate for the child.  
• adjust the speed of the device so that it  is appropriate for the child.  
• place the child into the device.  
• if needed, adjust cushion and/or other support to ensure that the child is placed  properly 
and safely.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_163451], attachment 1. 
 
2. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_163452]  (including user manual)  to the 
parent/guardian  and PT/OT and performs a standard product training of the device.  
 
3. The parent/guardian  is presented to the device and it’s labelling  and is asked to:  
• connect the battery charger to the battery charging port, and release it.  
• adjust the seat and table height so that they are  appropriate for the child.  
• adjust the speed of the device so that it  is appropriate for the child.  
• place the child into the device.  
• if needed, adjust cushion and/or other support to ensure that the child is placed properly 
and safely.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_163453], attachment 1.  
 
Human factors validation test protocol, version [ADDRESS_189752], and are performed by [CONTACT_163463], where the child is needed in order to perform 
them but does not play an active role.  
 
One PT/OT may be the profe ssional care -giver to more than one of the children included in 
the test. Step one above  will only be performed once for an individual PT/OT.  
 
4. As the child is placed in the device by [CONTACT_7071]/guardian, the child is allowed to explore 
the device for [ADDRESS_189753] their hand on the joystick and 
watch how he/she can move it. If the child does not initiate after a verbal prompt the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_163454]’s hand on the joystick. The child test form, 
attac hment 3,  will be used to describe the child’s actions and reactions.  
 
If the child seems interested they may be placed in the device up to two times during the 
visit, with at least five minutes of rest in between . If the child shows signs of distress (such  
as crying) for at least one -minute, then they will be taken out of the device for a five-minute 
rest period. A new attempt will be made to place the child in the device. A maximum of 
three, one -minute attempts will be made to provide an opportunity for the child to use the 
device before this step is ended.  
 
The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_163455], see attachment 1.  
The Principal Investi gator will complete two forms per test:  
1. The child’s PT/OT  (performing the test without training)  
2. The child’s parent/guardian (performing the test with training)  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_52396] a child test form for primary users to document observed 
user problems and user errors during the test as well as the ability to get the device  in motion  
and the child’s actions and reactions.  
 
User errors performed during the tasks will be divided into three severity levels:  
1. User experienced difficu lties in performing the task but did not lead to harm  
2. User performed an error that could have resulted in harm but never did  
3. User performed an error that resulted in harm.   
Details of the risk analysis performed in the preliminary analysis can be found in the Human 
Factor s validation plan  ES1692 . 
 
5.1.[ADDRESS_189754] – Interview s 
 
After the tasks in 5.1.[ADDRESS_189755] been performed, the  Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_163456]’s 
parent/guardian and PT/OT , in order to collect their perspectives of the tasks, to complement 
the task performance observations. A n interview form , attachment 2, will be used .

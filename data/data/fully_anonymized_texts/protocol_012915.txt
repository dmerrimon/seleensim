Version:    [ADDRESS_013] cancer. The development of adjuvant chemotherapy began with the 
demonstration of a survival benefit in no de-positive patients treated with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 
and fluorouracil (CMF)1.  Since then, survival benefits have been demonstrated in additional patient subsets, 
and the incorporation of innovative chemotherapy combinations, novel agents, and  new administration 
schedules has further improved the efficacy of adjuvant therapy. Recently, multiple large trials have 
demonstrated improved efficacy when a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) is added to the adjuvant 
chemotherapy regimen2.  In the [LOCATION_002], one of the most commonly used taxane -containing adjuvant 
regimens consists of 4 cycles of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide, followed by [ADDRESS_014] taxane -containing adjuvant programs to be inv estigated, and was 
proven superior when compared with doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) alone (5 -year disease -free 
survival [DFS] 75% vs. 65%, respectively).  In the PACS01 trial, the sequential addition of 3 cycles of 
docetaxel following 3 cycles of FEC10 0 proved superior to 6 cycles of FEC100 (5 -year DFS 78.3% vs. 
73.2%, hazard ratio:0.83)3.  Subsequent studies have compared the efficacy of various taxane schedules. 
Paclitaxel or docetaxel, given either weekly or every [ADDRESS_015] been shown to benefit disproportionately from 
taxane -containin g regimens. Specifically, the benefit produced in estrogen receptor (ER) -negative patients is 
consistently larger than the benefit of ER -positive patients receiving identical regimens5.  Patients with “triple 
negative” breast cancer (ER, progesterone recep tor [PR], and HER2 negative) benefit from taxane -
containing chemotherapy, but remain a poor prognosis group, with higher relapse rates and shorter survival 
than other subgroups6. Novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], especially those targeting resistance pathway in patients wh o do not 
respond to standard chemotherapy, may be of benefit to TNBC patients who traditionally have poor 
prognosis.  
 
1.2 Introduction to investigational treatment(s) and other study treatment(s)  
Everolimus  is a novel derivative of rapamycin. It has been in cl inical development since 1996 as an 
immunosuppressant in solid organ transplantation. Everolimus  is approved in Europe and other global 
markets (trade name: [CONTACT_117]®) for cardiac and renal transplantation, and in the [LOCATION_002] (trade name: 
[CONTACT_118]®) for the prevention of organ rejection of kidney transplantation.  
Everolimus  was developed in oncology as Afinitor ® and was approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC) in 2009. In 2010, Afinitor ® received Unite d States ( US) approval for patients with s ubependymal giant 
cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis (TS). Everolimus  is also available as Votubia® 
in the European Union ( EU) for patients with SEGA associated with TS. Afinitor ® was approved for 
“progressive pancreatic neuroendocr ine tumor ( PNET ) in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or 
metastatic disease” in 2011 in various countries, including the US and Europe.  In 2012 Afinitor® received 
approval for the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced hormone receptor -positive, HER2 - 
negative breast cancer (advanced HR+ BC) in combination with exemestane, after failure of treatment with 
letrozole or anastrozole. Furthermore  in 2012 , Afinitor®  received approval for the treatment of patients with 
TSC who have renal angio myolipoma not requiring immediate surgery.

The following is a brief summary of the main characteri stics of Everolimus . More complete information can 
be obtained from the Everolimus  Investigator’s Brochure  (IB). 
 
1.2.1 Overview of  Everolimus  
Everolimus  is a deriv ative  of rapamycin which acts as a signal transduction inhibitor ( Table 1 -1, Figure 1 -1). 
Everolimus  selectively inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin),  specifically targeting the mTOR -
raptor signal transduction complex . mTOR is a key serine -threonine kinase in the  PI3K/AKT signaling 
cascad e, which is known to be dysregulated in a wide spectrum of human cancers 7. 
Everolimus  is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act  
 directly on the tumor cells by [CONTACT_069];  
 indirectly by i nhibiting angiogenesis leading to reduced tumor vascularity (via potent inhibition of 
tumor cell VEGF (vascular  endothelial growth factor)  production and VEGF -induced proliferation of 
endothelial cells).

[IP_ADDRESS]  mTOR pathway and cancer  
At the  cellular and molecular level, Everolimus  acts as a signal transduction inhibitor. It selectively inhibits 
mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a key protein kinase which regulates cell growth, proliferation and 
survival. The mTOR kinase is mainly activated via the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI3 -Kinase) pathway 
through AKT/PKB and the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/2). Mutations in these components or in PTEN, 
a negative regula tor of PI3 -kinase, may result in their dysregulation. Abnormal functioning of various 
components of the signaling pathways contributes to the pathophysiology of numerous human cancers. 
Various preclinical models have confirmed the role of this pathway in t umor development 8.

The main known functions of mTOR include the following 9: 
 mTOR functions as a sensor of mitogens, growth factors and energy and nutrient levels;  
 Facilitating cell -cycle progression from G1 -S phase in appropriate growth conditions;  
 The P I3K/mTOR pathway itself is frequently dysregulated in many human cancers, and oncogenic 
transformation may sensitize tumor cells to mTOR inhibitors;  
 PI3-kinase mutations have been reported in the primary tumor in 10 -20% of human colorectal cancers 
10; 
 The loss of PTEN protein, either through gene deletion or functional silencing (promoter 
hypermethylation), is reported in approximately 60% of primary human colorectal cancers 11 
 The mTOR pathway is involved in the production of pro -angiogenic factors (i.e., VEGF) and inhibition of 
endothelial cell growth and proliferation;  
 Through inactivating eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding proteins and activating the 40S ribosomal S6 
kinases (i.e., p70S6K1), mTOR regulates protein translation, including the HIF -1 proteins. Inhibition of 
mTOR is expected to lead to decreased expression of HIF -1. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-clinical experience  
Everolimus inhibits the proliferation of a range of human tumor cell lines in vitro  including lines originating 
from lung, breast, prostate, colon, me lanoma and glioblastoma. IC50s range from sub/low nM to µM. 
Everolimus also inhibits the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECS) in vitro , with 
particular potency against VEGF -induced proliferation suggesting that Everolimus may al so act as an anti -
angiogenic agent. The anti -angiogenic activity of Everolimus was confirmed in vivo . Everolimus selectively 
inhibited VEGF -dependent angiogenic response at well tolerated doses. Mice with primary and metastatic 
tumors treated with Everolim us showed a significant reduction in blood vessel density when compared to 
controls.  
The potential of Everolimus as an anti -cancer agent was shown in rodent models. Everolimus is orally 
bioavailable, residing longer in tumor tissue than in plasma in a subc utaneous mouse xenograft model, and 
demonstrating high tumor penetration in a rat pancreatic tumor model. The pharmacokinetic profile of 
Everolimus indicates sufficient tumor penetration, above that needed to inhibit the proliferation of endothelial 
cells and tumor cell lines deemed sensitive to Everolimus in vitro . 
Everolimus administered orally daily was a potent inhibitor of tumor growth, at well tolerated doses, in 11 
different mouse xenograft models (including pancreatic, colon, epi[INVESTIGATOR_015], lung and me lanoma) and two 
syngeneic models (rat pancreatic, mouse orthotopic melanoma). These models included tumor lines 
considered sensitive and “relatively resistant” in vitro . In general, Everolimus was better tolerated in mouse 
xenograft models than standard cy totoxic agents (i.e., doxorubicin and 5 -fluorouracil), while possessing 
similar anti -tumor activity. Additionally, activity in a VEGF -impregnated subcutaneous implant model of 
angiogenesis and reduced vascularity (vessel density) of Everolimus -treated tumo rs (murine melanoma) 
provided evidence of in vivo  effects of angiogenesis.  
It is not clear which molecular determinants predict responsiveness of tumor cells to Everolimus. Molecular 
analysis has revealed that relative sensitivity to Everolimus in vitro  correlates with the degree of 
phosphorylation (activation) of the AKT/PKB protein kinase and the S6 ribosomal protein; in some cases 
(i.e., glioblastoma) there is also a correlation with PTEN status.  
In vivo  studies investigating the anti -tumor activity of E verolimus in experimental animal tumor models 
showed that Everolimus monotherapy typi[INVESTIGATOR_016]. These effects occurred within the dose range of 2.5 mg to 10 mg/kg, orally once a day.  
In preclinic al models, the administration of Everolimus is associated with reduction of protein phosphorylation 
in target proteins downstream of mTOR, notably phosphorylated S6 (p -S6) and p -4E-BP1, and occasionally 
with an increase in phosphorylated AKT, a protein ups tream of mTOR signaling pathway.

Version:    [ADDRESS_017].   Cisplatin forms irreversible covalent links with DNA, causing cross 
linking of DNA chains as well as breaks in the DNA chain and missense mutations.   The DNA injury triggers 
programmed cell death (apoptosis) and inhibits RNA and protein synthesis, particularly in rapi[INVESTIGATOR_017].   Cisplatin has activity against multiple tumor types and was approved for use by [CONTACT_070] 
1978.   Current indications include testicular, ovarian, bladder, head and neck,  breast, lung and colon cancer.  
[ADDRESS_018] cancer can now be categorized into 
5 groups: luminal A (ER+), luminal B (E R+), HER2 overexpressing, normal breast -like and basal -like13. The 
basal -like breast cancers tend to be clinically aggressive and usually have a poor outcome.  
The phenotype of breast cancer can be reliably identified by a panel of 4 immunohistochemical an tibodies: 
ER (negative), HER2 (negative), EGFR (positive), and cytokeratin 5/6 ( positive)13. Tumors arising in BRCA1 
carriers have many similarities to basal -like sporadic breast tumors, including a characteristic phenotype: 
they tend to be high -grade, ER/ PR-negative, HER2 -negative, and harbor mutant p5314. Basal keratins are 
expressed by [CONTACT_071] -like tumors and tumors with BRCA1 mutations, and both groups cluster 
together by [CONTACT_072]14. Other studies support these data, in which familial -BRCA1 breast 
cancers have shared features with a subset of sporadic tumors, indicating a common or similar etiology. 
Hallmarks of this “BRCAness” include basal -like phenotype (associated with the BRCA1 phenotype but not 
with the BRCA2 phenotype), ER-negativity, EGFR expression, c-MYC amplification, TP53 mutations, loss of 
RAD51 -focus formation, extreme genomic instability and sensitivity to DNA -crosslinking agents15, 16. The

clinical implications of the definition of a group of tumors with a “BRCAn ess” hallmark lies in its potential to 
influence the clinical management of these tumors, allowing for rational trials exploring the role of 
chemotherapy and biologic agents targeted towards DNA repair defects. In support of this hypothesis,

observed pCR was 23% . In another small study, 9/[ADDRESS_020] a very poor prognosis with a recurrence rate up to 65% within the first two years19.  
 
Our recent data in profiling of ~[ADDRESS_021] subpopulations with chemoresis tant disease. We established a 7 -gene prognostic 
signature [CONTACT_120]. In the independent validation cohort, the classifier 
predicted correctly with positive predictive value of 75.0% and negative predictive value (i.e., r elapse -free 
survival [RFS]) of 76.9% at [ADDRESS_022] ratio (HR) of 4.67 (95% CI, 
1.27-17.15) for relapse in 3 years. In extended validation cohort, patients predicted not to relapse exhibited 
3-year RFS of 78.9%, while i n comparison, the 3 -year RFS was 48.5% for patients predicted to relapse (log 
rank P<0.0001), with HR of 2.61 (95% CI, 1.52 -4.49). The subgroup of TNBC patients predicted to have 
relatively favorable prognosis was characterized by [CONTACT_073] “lumin al-like” genes (androgen -
receptor [AR] and GATA3); while the subgroup with worse prognosis was characterized by [CONTACT_074] (WNT11 and MMP28). This group of TNBC with stem cell markers cluster with 
mesenchymal stem like (MSL) and  mesenchymal subgroups of TNBC.

M and MSL subtypes are enriched in gene expression for epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] -mesenchymal transition, 
and growth factor pathways and cell models responded to a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor  (NVP -BEZ235).  
 
Our collaborators at Vanderbilt Univer sity have generated a p73 gene expression signatures in H1299 cells 
(which lack expression of all p53 family members) transfected with TAp73β, an isoform of p73 capable of 
strong transactivation20. A combination of microarray profiling and chromatin immuno precipi[INVESTIGATOR_019] (ChIPSeq) was used to develop a p73 expression signature. Because microarray analyses do 
not allow discrimination between direct or indirect regulation by a transcription factor of interest, they also 
performed whole ge nome ChIP to identify sequences to which p73 is bound (ChIPSeq). Over 4,000 p73 -
bound DNA sequences were isolated, sequenced, and mapped to the mammalian genome. Tags that 
mapped inside or within 10 kb of genes were considered for further analysis. Several  known p73 target 
genes, such as p2127 and MDM228, were identified by [CONTACT_075], thus validating their 
datasets. In addition, known genes ontologies were enriched in their datasets, including genes involved in

          No:  
Version:    [ADDRESS_023] of potential candidate 
targets. Additional information was obtained from fold -change expression levels that were used to create 
rank-ordered lists of candidate target genes from this analysis, they also generated an initial set (1000 
probes) of p73 -regulat ed genes that could be used to query the Connectivity Map. The Connectivity Map is a 
collection of genome -wide transcriptional expression data from human cells treated with bioactive small 
molecules and simple pattern -matching algorithms that together enab le the discovery of decisive functional 
connections between drugs, genes, and diseases through the transitory feature of common gene expression 
changes21. Genes whose transcript levels increased or decreased two -fold after ectopic p73 expression were 
analy zed using the Connectivity Map. Because they were interested in identifying pathways upstream of p73 
rather than just drugs per se , they focused on the well -annotated “pharmaceutical” subset of perturbagens. 
Several of the top perturbagens in their list we re either direct or indirect inhibitors of mammalian Target of 
Rapamycin (mTOR).  More importantly,  profiling by [CONTACT_076] (NGS) for 182 
oncogenes and tumor suppressors (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA) and gene expression profi ling 
(NanoString) of the residual cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was conducted in 102 patients with 
TNBC.  Of the tumors evaluated by [CONTACT_077], 72/81 (89%) demonstrated mutations in TP53, 22 were MCL1 -
amplified (27%), and 17 were MYC -amplified  (21%).  Alterations in the PI3K/mTOR pathway ( AKT1 -3, 
PIK3CA , PIK3R1 , RAPTOR , PTEN, and TSC1 ) were identified in 27 (33%) of TNBC tumors with residual 
disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  
 
In summary, these data strongly support the use of mTOR inhibitors with c isplatin in patients with 
residual disease following standard neo -adjuvant chemotherapy, in whom the majority will have a 
very high chance of relapse within two years.    
Thus, we propose here to evaluate the benefit of mTOR inhibition with everolimus in c ombination with 
cisplatin in triple negative breast cancer patients with residual. We have demonstrated that the driving 
pathway in resistance in TNBC patients with chemotherapy -resistant disease is the mTOR/PI3K pathway.  
Thus, the effect of mTOR inhibitio n will be accentuated in patients with residual disease, rather than in 
patients treated with upfront neo -adjuvant everolismus, as the proportion of tumors will be enriched for MSL 
and M subtypes dependent on mTOR/PI3K pathway.   
              
We hypothesiz e that using everolimus with cisplatin will increase pCR rates in TNBC patients who are 
refractory to standard chemotherapy.  
 
3 Objectives and endpoints  
Primary  
 To evaluate the pathological response rate (pCR) after treatment with everolimus plus cisplatin in 
women with triple -negative breast cancer with documented residual disease after standard neo -
adjuvant treatment.  
Secondary  
 To assess correlative markers  in biopsies . 
Exploratory objectives (if necessary)  
 To assess effect of everolimus  on cancer stem cel ls, DNA damage markers, and other markers. 
(We will correlate pCR with studies exploring changes in the p63/p73 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR 
pathways).

RESIDUAL DISEASE WILL BE CORRELATED WITH PHYSICAL EXAM, ULTRASOUND AND MAMMOGRAM PRIOR STUDY INITIATION
  
We propose to perform a phase II clinic al trial in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients who have 
completed systemic neoadjuvant chemotherapy and have documented clinical/pathological residual disease.  
Biopsies will be obtained from accessible sites at baseline only  (Research procedure ); biopsied tumor must 
measure at least 1cm at any direction; if main tumor is not detected, an abnormal (clinically or radiologically) 
axillary lymph node can be biopsied.  
 
The correlation of specific molecular markers such as Ki67, mitotic index, apopto sis, levels of S6K and 
phospho S6K, p53, p63, and p73 levels as well as p73 and p63 gene signatures with clinical parameters 
such as tumor response and pathological complete response will help define a biomarker signature 
[CONTACT_121] p63/p73 and/or PI3 K/Akt dependence in triple negative breast cancers as well as 
identification of new therapeutic options for this group of patients. We plan to store all the tissue collected 
during the study for future analysis including genomic studies.  
 
As with all drugs , there is always the possibility that there may be unknown or impossible to predict risks/side 
effects. The use of everolimus plus cisplatin as part of the treatment may or may not increase the severity of 
side effects, and all risks associated with this research will be explained in the protocol and consent form. 
Nevertheless, this study may help provide better insight into new therapeutic options for breast cancer. The 
patients involved in this study will have a diagnosis of locally advanced triple negat ive breast cancer and are 
at high risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_020]. The doses proposed for this phase II study 
is the one that is already approved for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) which is 10 mg once daily administer oral 
with or wi thout food over six months.

5 Population  
Female patients ≥18 years of age  
Study Duration :   
The duration of patient participation in the study treatment will be a total of 3 to 4 months, which is counted 
from the start of treatment.  Study Follow -up for all patients will include medical history update ([ADDRESS_026] dose of the study drug)   
Safety Criteria:    
All participants will be assessed by a physician for pre -existing medical conditions and baseline physical 
abnormalities prior to the initiation of investigational therapy. Patients presenting with  any medical history, 
physical exam, or laboratory abnormality that, in the in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021], would put the 
subject’s safety at risk will be excluded. Baseline signs and symptoms are to be recorded and followed 
throughout the trial.   These will be monitored throughout the study and recorded if they increase in severity 
or frequency during treatment or within the follow up period. Participants will be assessed for adverse events 
by a physician or designated midlevel provider prior to each chemotherapy infusion while the patient is on 
study. Vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate and temperature should be performed at each physical 
exam.  Assessments may be performed more frequently if clinically indicated. In addition, hemato logy and 
serum chemistry profiles will be drawn prior to the initiation of treatment and prior to every infusion to 
determine whether the study drug combination affects hematologic values, electrolytes or liver function tests. 
Laboratory assessments will b e performed more frequently if clinically indicated. This clinical and laboratory 
data will be used to determine whether these women in the study with everolimus  plus cisplatin therapy have 
any symptoms or side effects associated with the study medications . Subjects will be followed for adverse 
events for a period of 30 days after the completion of investigational therapy (Six (6) months). Patients with 
abnormal laboratory or clinical findings that are believed to be treatment related will be followed every  four 
weeks until the condition resolves or stabilizes, or until the laboratory values are no longer considered 
clinically significant.  CTC Version 4.0 will be used to grade toxicities.  Laboratory tests may be done more 
frequently if medically indicated.  If CTC Grade 4 hematologic toxicity is seen; CBC + differential + platelets 
should be repeated every 3 - 4 days until recovery.  
At suspected recurrence: CT scans of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and additional directed evaluation as 
appropriate.  Recurrence  should be documented by [CONTACT_078]/or evidence of metastatic disease on 
radiologic studies. Abnormal blood studies alone (e.g., elevated liver function tests, CA 15 -3, CEA, etc.) are 
not sufficient evidence of relapse.

 known or suspected past hepatitis C infection (including patients with past interferon ‘curative’ 
treatment),  
 blood transfusions prior to 1990,  
 current or prior IV drug us ers, 
 current or prior dialysis,  
 household contact [CONTACT_085] C infected patient(s),  
 current or prior high -risk sexual activity,  
 body pi[INVESTIGATOR_025].  
At the discretion of the investigator, additional patients may also be tested for hepatitis C.  
The m anagement guidelines, in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , are provided according to the results of the baseline 
assessment of hepatitis C viral load.

day cycle , for 4 cycles.  
 
6.1.1 Dosing regimen  
The investigator should promote compliance by [CONTACT_086]’s safety and the validity of the study. 
The patient should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_087]/she is unable for any reason to take the 
study drug as prescribed.  
Everolimus  should be administered orally once daily at the same time every day, either cons istently with or 
consistently without food  
Tablets  
The tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water and should not be chewed or crushed.  
If vomiting occurs, no attempt should be made to replace the vomited dose. Patients should be instructed 
that if they miss a dose on one day, they must not take any extra dose the next day, but instead to 
immediately contact [CONTACT_088].

6.2.2 Management of specific toxicities  
Overall, safety data available from completed, controlled and uncontrolled studies indicate that everolimus is 
generally well tolerated at weekly or daily  dose schedules. The safety profile is characterized by [CONTACT_089] (AEs). These AEs are generally reversible and non -cumulative.  
Adverse events most frequently observed with everolimus are rash, stomatitis /oral mucositis, non -infectious 
pneumonitis, fatigue, headache, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and infections. Overall, the most 
frequently observed laboratory abnormalities include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hypercholesterolemia, 
and/or hypertriglyceridemia. The majority of thes e AEs have been of mild to moderate severity (NCI CTC 
grade 1 -2). Recommendations for dose adjustments, should any of these treatment -related adverse events 
occur, are given in Table 3 -2, Table 3 -3 and Table 3 -4, 3-5, and 3 -6 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of infections  
Everolimus  has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral or 
protozoal infections, including  infections with opportunistic pathogens. Localized and systemic infections, 
including pneumonia, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections, such as aspergillosis or 
candidiasis and viral infections including reactivation of hepatitis B virus, have been described in patients 
taking Everolimus  Some of these infections have been severe (e.g. leading to respi[INVESTIGATOR_026] h epatic failure) 
and occasionally have had a fatal outcome.  
Physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with Everolimus  Treat pre -existing 
infections prior to starting treatment with Everolimus . While taking Everolimus , be vig ilant for symptoms and

signs of infection; if a diagnosis of infection is made, institute appropriate treatment promptly and consider 
interruption or discontinuation of Everolimus . 
If a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is made, discontinue Everolimus  and treat with 
appropriate antifungal therapy.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of skin toxicity  
For patients with grade [ADDRESS_043] be 
reported as an AE. Patients with grade 2 or higher toxicity m ay be treated with the following suggested 
supportive measures at the discretion of the investigator: oral minocycline, topi[INVESTIGATOR_027], topi[INVESTIGATOR_028], topi[INVESTIGATOR_029], diphenhydramine, oral prednisolone (short course), topi[INVESTIGATOR_030], or pi[INVESTIGATOR_031].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of stomatitis / oral mucositis / mouth ulcers  
Patients with a clinical history of stomatitis/mucositis/mouth ulcers and those with gastrointestinal morbidity 
associated with mouth/dental infections, irritation of es ophageal mucosa e.g. gastroesophageal reflux 
disease (GERD) and pre -existing stomatitis/mucositis must be monitored even more closely. Patients should 
be instructed to report the first onset of buccal mucosa irritation/reddening to their study physician 
immediately.  
Stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers due to Everolimus  should be treated using local supportive care. 
Please note that investigators in earlier trials have described the o ral toxicities associated with Everolimus  as 
mouth ulcers, rather than m ucositis or stomatitis. If your examination reveals mouth ulcers rather than a 
more general inflammation of the mouth, please classify the adverse event as such. Please follow the 
paradigm below for treatment of stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers:  
1. For mild toxicity (grade 1), use conservative measures such as non -alcoholic mouth wash or salt water 
(0.9%) mouth wash several times a day until resolution.  
2. For more severe toxicity (grade [ADDRESS_044] pain but are able to maintain adequate 
oral alimentation, or grade 3 in which case patients cannot maintain adequate oral alimentation), the 
suggested treatments are topi[INVESTIGATOR_032] (i.e., local anesthetics such as, 
benzocaine, butyl aminobenzoate, tetracaine hydrochloride, me nthol, or phenol) with or without topi[INVESTIGATOR_030], such as triamcinolone oral paste 0.1% (Kenalog in Orabase®). 
3. Agents containing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and thyme derivatives may tend to worsen mouth 
ulcers. It is preferable to avoid t hese agents.  
4. Antifungal agents should be avoided unless a fungal infection is diagnosed. In particular, systemic 
imidazole antifungal agents (ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, etc.) should be avoided in all 
patients due  to their strong inhibition of  Everolimus  metabolis m, therefore leading to higher Everolimus  
exposures. Therefore, topi[INVESTIGATOR_033].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of diarrhea  
Appearance of grade [ADDRESS_045] onset (for example 4 mg orally followed by 2 mg orally every 2 hours 
until resolution of diarrhea).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_034] t ake into account the pre -treatment status and dietary habits of the 
patient. Grade 2 or higher hypercholesterolemia (>300 mg/dL or 7.75 mmol/L) or grade 2 
hypertriglyceridemia or higher (>2.5x upper normal limit) should be treated with a 3 -hydroxy -3-methyl -glutaryl 
(HMG) -CoA reductase inhibitor (e.g. atorvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin) or appropriate triglyceride -lowering 
medication, in addition to diet.  
NOVARTIS, TMHRI&TMHCC                                         Everolimus Clinical Protocol                                                 Page 21

Version:    1                               
Note: Concomitant therapy with fibrates and an HMG -CoA reductase inhibitor is associated with an 
increased risk of a rare but serious skeletal muscle toxicity manifested by [CONTACT_090], markedly 
elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels and myoglobinuria, acute renal failure and sometimes death. 
The risk versus benefit of using this therapy should be determined for individual patients based on their risk 
of cardiovascular complications of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].  
Hyperglycemia has been reported in clinical trials. Monitoring of fasting serum glucose is recommended prior 
to the start of Everolimus  and periodi cally thereafter. Optimal glycemic control should be achieved before 
starting a patient on Everolimus . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of non -infectious pneumonitis  
Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives. Cases of non -infectious pneumonitis 
(including interstitial lung disease) have also been described in patients taking Everolimus. Some of these 
have been severe and on rare occasions, a fatal outcome was observed . 
 A diagnosis of non -infectious pneumonitis should be considered in patients present ing with non -specific 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_036], pleural effusion, cough or dyspnea, and in whom 
infectious, neoplastic and other non -medicinal causes have been excluded by [CONTACT_091]. Patients should be advise d to report promptly any new or worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_037].  
 Patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non -infectious pneumonitis and have few or no 
symptoms may continue Everolimus  therapy without dose alteration.  
Individuals participatin g in this trial will be routinely questioned as to the presence of new or changed 
pulmonary symptoms consistent with lung toxicity. Moreover, potential lung radiological changes can be 
detected by [CONTACT_092]/MRI scans that are performed on all patients e very 4 weeks for tumor assessment 
according to the schedule of events ( Table 7 -1). In addition, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) will be 
conducted, if clinically indicated, to monitor for pneumonitis. If non -infectious pneumonitis develops, the 
guidelines in Table 6-[ADDRESS_046] is recommended for any case 
of pneum onitis that develops during the study .

[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of hepatitis reactivation / flare  
Reactivation  of Hepatitis B (HBV) has been observed in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy 22. 
Sporadic cases of Hepatitis B reactivation have also been seen in this setting with everolimus. U se of 
antivirals during anti -cancer therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of Hepatitis B virus reactivation and 
associated morbidity and mortality 22. A detailed assessment of Hepatitis B/C medical history and risk factors 
must be done for all patients  at screening, with testing performed prior to the first dose of everolimus.

SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS:  
Administer with caution to individuals with pre -existing renal impairment, myelosuppression or hearing 
impairment. 12 
Breastfeeding is not recommended as cisplatin is excreted in human milk.  
Carcinogenicity: found to have a carcinogen ic effect in laboratory animals.   
Contraindicated : in patients who have a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to cisplatin or other platinum -
containing compounds.  
Fertility: Cisplatin therapy is associated with at least temporary infertility in the major ity of patients. Among 
males receiving cisplatin for testicular cancer, almost all became azospermic within the first two cycles of 
therapy, but recovery of normal sperm morphology, motility, and sperm count occurred in 40% within 1.5 -2

with 1 or 2 L of fluid infused 8 -12 hours prior to a cisplatin dose. Hydration with NS, hypertonic saline 
infusion, and mannitol, or furosemide -induced diuresis is u sed to effectively decrease cisplatin -induced 
nephrotoxicity.8 Lower doses of cisplatin are given with less intensive hydration. For example, patients 
receiving doses of 35 mg/m2 have been pre -treated with [ADDRESS_061] -hydration. 
Patients receiving doses of 25 mg/m2 have been pre -treated with vigorous oral hydration (e.g., 600 -900 mL) 
the morning of treatment and 8 glasses (e.g., 2000 mL/day) daily for a few days following treatment. Please 
refer to the “Nephrotoxicity” paragraph, fou nd below the Side Effects table for a suggested hydration 
guideline.  
Inadvertent substitution of cisplatin for carboplatin can result in a potentially fatal overdosage. Precautions 
should be taken to avoid overdosing such as writing the cisplatin dose as a daily dose, not as a total cisplatin 
dose used in one course of therapy. The manufacturer recommends that an alerting mechanism be instituted 
to verify any order for cisplatin >100 mg/m2 per course every 3 -4 weeks. 12

SIDE EFFECTS:  
The table includes adverse events that presented during drug treatment but may not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with the drug. Because clinic al trials are conducted under very specific conditions, the 
adverse event rates observed may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adverse events are 
generally included if they were reported in more than 1% of patients in the product monogra ph or pi[INVESTIGATOR_043], and/or determined to be clinically important. 12

hemolytic anemia.  
Electrolyte disturbances can be serious and mainly includes hypomagnesemia, hyp ocalcemia and 
hypokalemia. Hypophosphatemia and hyponatremia have occurred in some patients receiving cisplatin 
combination regimens. These effects are due to renal tubular damage. Cisplatin greatly increases the urinary 
excretion of magnesium and calcium;  increased excretion of potassium, zinc, copper and amino acids also 
occurs. Hypomagnesemia and or hypocalcemia may become symptomatic, with muscle irritability or cramps, 
clonus, tremor, carpopedal spasm and/or tetany. Children may be at greater risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_045]. 12 
Emetogenic effects are common with cisplatin therapy and may be serotonin -mediated. Acute nausea and 
vomiting may occur within 1 -6 (usually 2 -3) hours after administration of cisplatin. This early period is the 
most severe and  usually lasts [ADDRESS_064] for up to 5 -10 days. Delayed nausea and vomiting can occur 24 hours or longer 
following chemotherapy when complete emetic control had been atta ined on the day of cisplatin therapy. The 
incidence and severity of cisplatin -induced nausea and vomiting appear to be increased in: females, the 
young, high doses, rapid infusion and combinations with other emetogenic drugs. Incidence and severity 
may be decreased in patients with a history of chronic alcohol use. Acute nausea and vomiting can be 
prevented by [CONTACT_094] -treatment with a [ADDRESS_065] (e.g.,  granisetron, ondansetron) plus a corticosteroid; 
this can be continued for the first 24 hours following chemotherapy. Delayed nausea and vomiting should 
not routinely be treated with 5 -HT3 antagonists; although there is anecdotal evidence that some patients can 
benefit from [ADDRESS_066]. Hydration regimens should take into account the following conditions for 
the patient ; adequate renal function, clinically euvolemic prior to administration of cisplatin, no 
contraindication to saline loading (e.g., uncompensa ted cardiac conditions, anasarca), and ability to comply 
with recommended oral hydration protocol, or expectation that volume status can be maintained (e.g., with 
fluids via enteral feeding tube or IV). Below is one suggested hydration regimen for adults. 12

*Volume may include hydration associated with the administration of other drugs (e.g., other chemotherapy 
agents, supportive IV medications). The volumes and durations are minimum administration standards to 
accommodate the wide variation in clinical practice in d elivery of cisplatin. They should be individualized 
based on the clinical situation, which may affect the hydration regimen and addition of electrolytes.  
 
Nervous system effects are usually peripheral neuropathies and sensory in nature (e.g., parethesias of the 
upper and lower extremities). They can also include motor difficulties (especially gait); reduced or absent 
deep -tendon reflexes and leg weakness may also occur. Peripheral neuropathy is cumulative and usually 
reversible, although recovery is often slow. Geriatric patients may be at greater risk for these cisplatin -
induced neuropathies. Muscle cramps have been reported, and usually occurred in patients with 
symptomatic peripheral neuropathy who received relatively high cumulative doses of cisplatin. Lhermitte’s 
sign (a sensation during neck flexion resembling electric shock) often is present with cisplatin -induced 
neuropathy. The occurrence of Lhermitte’s sign may coincide with the onset of peripheral neuropathies, and 
can last for 2 -8 months. When si gns of neuropathy occur, cisplatin should be discontinued. 12 
 
Otic effects include tinnitus, with or without clinical hearing loss, and occasional deafness. Ototoxicity is 
cumulative and irreversible and results from damage to the inner ear. These effects  may be more severe in 
children than in adults. The manufacturer recommends that audiograms be performed prior to initiating 
therapy and prior to each subsequent dose of drug. Initially, there is loss of high frequency acuity (4000 to 
8000 Hz). When acuity  is affected in the range of speech, cisplatin should be discontinued under most 
circumstances and carboplatin substituted where appropriate. Ototoxicity appears to be dose related. Higher 
cumulative doses, higher individual doses and administration by [CONTACT_095], 
corresponding with higher plasma levels of ultrafilterable platinum. Ototoxicity may be enhanced in patients 
with prior or simultaneous cranial irradiation. Vestibular ototoxicity may increase with increasing cumu lative 
dosage and may be more likely to occur in patients with pre -existing vestibular dysfunction. 12 
 
Sensitivity reactions can include anaphylactoid reactions consisting of facial edema, flushing, wheezing or 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_046], tachycardia, and h ypotension. These reactions can occur within a few minutes after IV 
administration of cisplatin; diaphoresis, nasal stuffiness, rhinorrhea, conjunctivitis, generalized erythema, 
apprehension, and sensation of chest constriction may also occur. Cisplatin -induced anaphylactoid reactions 
usually have occurred after multiple cycles of cisplatin (e.g., at least 5 doses), but also can occur after the 
first dose. There is a case report of a patient who experienced an anaphylaxis to cisplatin following nine 
previou s uncomplicated cycles. Some reactions may also be due to the mannitol that is given with cisplatin 
to prevent nephrotoxicity. Occasionally, patients who experienced anaphylactoid reactions have been safely 
retreated with cisplatin following pre -treatment with corticosteroids and/or antihistamines; however, such 
prophylaxis is not uniformly effective in preventing recurrence. 12

Everolimus  is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 in the liver and to some extent in the intestinal wall.  
Therefore , the following are recommended : 
 Co-administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) or P -
glycoprotei n (PgP) inhibitor should be avoided.  
 Co-administration with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole) or PgP inhibitors 
should be used with caution. If a patient requires co -administration of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or 
PgP inhibitors,  reduce the dose of everolimus  . Additional dose reductions to every other day may be 
required to manage toxicities. If the inhibitor is discontinued, the Everolimus  dose should be returned to 
the dose used prior to initiation of the moderate CYP3A4/PgP in hibitor  after a washout period of 2 to 3 
days . 
 Grapefruit or citrus  juices affect P450 and PgP activity. Concomitant use should be avoided.  
 Co-administration with strong inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided. If a patient requires co -
administration of stron g CYP3A4 inducers (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, rifabutin, 
phenobarbital, St. John’s wort), an increase in the dose of Everolimus  up to twice the currently used 
daily dose should be considered, 5mg increments. Enzyme induction usually occurs w ithin 7 -10 days; 
therefore Everolimus  dose should be increased by [CONTACT_098] 7 days after the start of the inducer 
therapy.  If no safety concerns are seen within the next 7 days, the dose can be increased again one 
additional increment up to a maximum of twice the daily dose used prior to initiation of the strong 
CYP3A4 inducer.  
 This dose adjustment of Everolimus  is intended to achieve similar AUC to the range observed without 
inducers. However, there are no clinical data with this dose adjustment in pa tients receiving strong 
CYP3A4 inducers. If the strong inducer is discontinued the Everolimus  dose should be returned to the 
dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4/PgP inducer.

7.2.1 Pregnancy and assessments of fertility  
Pregnancy testing is required at screening or whenever pregnancy is suspected.   Serum pregnancy testing 
should be performed at screening  and at the end of the study. Urine pregnancy testing will be performed at 
each visit (every 4 weeks).  
Women of child -bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, must 
use highly eff ective contraception during the study and for 8 weeks after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056]. Highly effective 
contraception is defined as either:  
 Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. [Periodic 
abstinence (e.g., c alendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not 
acceptable methods of contraception]  
 Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at 
least six weeks before taking  study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the 
reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_104]  
 Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm 
in the ejaculate). [For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male partner should be the sole 
partner for that subject].  
 Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c or b+c):  
a. Use of oral, injected,  implanted or other hormonal method s of contraception  
b. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)  
c. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with 
spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository  
 In case of use o f oral contraception , women should have been stab le on the oral agent  before taking 
study treatment.  
Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and for [ADDRESS_078] also be advised to use one of the following contraception method s: 
Use of (1) oral, inje cted, implanted or other hormonal methods of contraception, or (2) intrauterine device 
(IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or (3) prior male/female sterilization.

factors, refer to Section  
 
7.2.3 Drug levels and pharmacokinetic assessments  N/A 
 
[ADDRESS_080] or other means, will be collected and 
recorded and followed as appropriate.  
 
8.1 Adverse events  
8.1.1 Definitions and reporting  
Adverse events that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded in the Adverse Events CRF. 
Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent should be rec orded in the Medical 
History page of the patient’s CRF. Adverse event monitoring should be continued for at least 30 days (or 5 
half-lives, whichever is longer) following the last dose of study treatment. Adverse events (including lab 
abnormalities that co nstitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than 
individual underlying signs and symptoms. When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or 
symptom should be reported as a separate Adverse Event.  
The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by [CONTACT_105] -directive questioning of the patient at each visit 
during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_106], laboratory test, or other assessments. As far as possible, 
each adverse event should be evaluated to determine:  
1. The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 -4) 
2. Its duration (Start and end dates  or if continuing at the Safety Follow -up Visit ) 
3. Its relationship to the study treatment (Reasonable possibility that AE is related: No, Yes)  
4. Action taken with respect to study or investigational treatment (none, dose adjusted, temporarily 
interrupted, permanently discontinued, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], unknown, not applicable)  
5. Whether medication or therapy was given (no concomitant medication/non -drug therapy, concomitant 
medication/non -drug therapy)  
6. Outcome (not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved  with 
sequalae, fatal, unknown)  
7. Whet her it is serious, where a serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as in Section 8.2.1  
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in study drug 
treatment including  possible interruption or discontinuation, starting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_058], 
changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or any other medically required 
intervention. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be follow ed until its resolution, and assessment 
should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected 
relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.  
Information about com mon side effects already known about the investigational drug can be found in the 
[Investigators’ Brochure] . This information should be included in the patient informed consent and should be 
discussed with the patient during the study as needed.  
Adverse ev ent monitoring should be continued for at least [ADDRESS_081] dose of study treatment

          No:  
Version:    [ADDRESS_082] abnormalities  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an Adverse event in their own right (are considered  clinically 
significant, induce c linical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy or require changes in study 
treatment), should be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF. Whenever possible, a diagnosis, rather than a 
symptom should be provided (e.g. anemia instead of low hemoglobin). L aboratory abnormalities that meet 
the criteria for Adverse Events should be followed until they have returned to normal or an adequate 
explanation of the abnormality is found. When an abnormal laboratory or test result corresponds to a 
sign/symptom of an a lready reported adverse event, it is not necessary to separately record the lab/test 
result as an additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities, that do not meet the definition of an adverse event, should not be reported as 
adverse events. A Grade 3 or 4 even t (severe) as per CTCAE does not automatically indicate a SAE unless 
it meets the definition of serious as defined below and/or as per investigator’s discretion. A dose hold or 
medication for the lab abnormality may be required by [CONTACT_107] , by [CONTACT_108], an adverse 
event.  
  
8.1.[ADDRESS_083] (optional)  
In clinical trials, everolimus has been associated with serious cases of hepatitis B reactivation, including fatal 
outcome. Reactivation of infections is an expected event d uring periods of immunosuppression.  
In clinical trials and post -marketing spontaneous reports, everolimus has been associated with renal failure 
events (including fatal ones) and proteinuria. Renal function will be monitored throughout the study.  In 
clinic al trials Everolimus has been associated with certain adverse events.

8.2 Serious Adverse Events  
8.2.1 Definitions  
A serious adverse even t is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition which:  
 is fatal or life -threatening  
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_061], unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]:  
 routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in 
condition (specify what this includes)  
 elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition tha t is unrelated to the indication under 
study and has not worsened since the start of study drug  
 treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE 
given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
 socia l reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_064]’s general condition  
 is medically significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcome s listed above  
 
8.2.2 Reporting  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_065], IRB, and 
[COMPANY_001] Pharmaceuticals Drug Safety and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_066] (DS&E).  
All events reported to the FDA by [CONTACT_109] 3500A (MedWatch 
Form).  
To ensure patient safety, every SAE, regardless  of suspected causality, occurring  
 after the patient has provided informed consent and until atleast 30 days  after the patient has stopped 
study treatment/participation  
 after protocol -specified procedures begin (e.g., placebo run -in, washout period, double -blind treatment, 
etc.) and 30 days  after the patient has stopped study treatment  
 after the start of any period in which the study protocol interferes with the standard medical treatment 
given to a patient (e.g., treatment withdrawal during washout period,  change in treatment to a fixed dose 
of concomitant medication) and until [ADDRESS_084] be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence  (fax: [PHONE_002]) . This includes 
serious, related, labeled (expected) a nd serious, related, unlabeled (unexpected) adverse experiences. All 
deaths during treatment or within [ADDRESS_085] be kept within the Trial Master File 
at the study site.  
Follow -up information is sent to the same fax number as the original SAE Report Form was sent, using a 
new fax cover sheet, stating that this is a follow -up to the previously reported SAE , and giving the date of the 
original report. Each re -occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as 
a follow -up to that event regardless of when it occurs. The fo llow-up information should describe whether the

event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not (if 
applicable), and whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation.  
If the SAE is not previ ously documented in the Everolimus Investigator Brochure or Package Insert (new 
occurrence) and is thought to be related to the [COMPANY_001] study drug, a DS&E  associate may urgently require 
further information from the investigator for Health Authority report ing. [COMPANY_001] may need to issue an 
Investigator Notification (IN), to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this 
SAE has been reported.  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and 
reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 
2001/20/EC or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries.  
For Comparator Drugs/Secondary Suspects (Concomitant Medications), all serious advers e experiences will 
be forwarded to the comapartor drug company  by [CONTACT_093].  
 
8.3  Emergency unblinding of treatment assignment

8.[ADDRESS_086] be reported 
to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up to determine 
outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, det ails of the birth, and the presence or absence of 
any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. The newborn will be 
followed for at least 12 months.  
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form an d reported by [CONTACT_110][INVESTIGATOR_066] (DS&E). Pregnancy follow -up should be 
recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the study 
treatment and any pre gnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the 
SAE Report Form.  
 
9 Statistical methods  
9.1 Sample Size.  
Demographics and pre -treatment characteristics will be summarized for all patients using descriptive 
statistics.   TNBC patients  will be eligible if they are at high risk of recurrence (residual disease after neo -
adjuvant treatment).  
 
An overall sample size of 32  subjects achieves 81% power, using a one -sided binomial test (alpha=0.05), 
will give us a 5% increase in the pCR rate.   
The study lasts for [ADDRESS_087] tumor assessment.  
The safety profiles of the study will be asse ssed through summaries of adverse events (AEs), serious 
adverse events (SAEs), AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, and treatment -related death. All patients 
who receive at least [ADDRESS_088]

Any change or addition (excluding administrative) to this protocol requires a written protocol amendment that 
must be reviewed by [CONTACT_111]. Amendments si gnificantly 
affecting the safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation or the scientific quality of the study require 
additional approval by [CONTACT_112].  A copy of the written approval of the IRB must be 
provided to [COMPANY_001]. Exampl es of amendments requiring such approval are:  
1. increases in drug dose or duration of exposure of subjects,  
2. significant changes in the study design (e.g. addition or deletion of a control group),  
3. increases in the number of invasive procedures,  
4. addition or de letions of a test procedure required for monitoring of safety.  
These requirements for approval should in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken by [CONTACT_113].  If an 
immediate change to the protocol is felt to be necessary by [CONTACT_114].   Amendments 
affecting only admini strative aspects of the study do not require formal protocol amendments or IRB approval 
but the IRB must be kept informed of such administrative changes. Examples of administrative changes not 
requiring formal protocol amendments and IRB approval include:  
1. changes in the staff used to monitor trials  
2. minor changes in the packaging or labeling of study drug.

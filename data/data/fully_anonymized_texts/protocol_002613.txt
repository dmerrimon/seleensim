 Study Title:  A Feasibility study evaluating Mindfulness -Based Intervention Assessing A  Wearable 
Wellness Brain Sensing Device (Muse -S) in Fibromyalgia Patients.  
 
Protocol date of most recent review and approval :   24 June 2024 
 
Research Question and Aims  
 
Hypothesis :  Patients with fibromyalgia often deal with continual stress, sleep issues, and pain  symptoms .  
We postulate that using the novel muse headband can provi de mindfulness training to benefit the quality 
of life and sleep, and decrease stress and  pain.  
 Aims, purpose, or objectives:  
1. To study the feasibility of a wearable brain sensing wellness device to provide mindfulness  
training to fibromyalgia patients.  
2. To assess the association between duration of active state and calm state as measured by [CONTACT_629654]-
S Headband S ystem , and quality of life (QOL) , subjective stress , sleep, and pain in fibromyalgia 
patients.  
 
The primary  outcome will be  the change in wide pain index ( WPI) and stress over time . 
 
Background:  
Up to 8% of the population has fibromyalgia. These patients often have stress1, poor copi[INVESTIGATOR_629651]2.  Many of these patients also have multiple constitutional symptoms including  irritable 
bowel syndrome3, chronic headaches4, depression and anxiety5,6,7. 
Mind body therapi[INVESTIGATOR_629652] a popular treatment option with practitioners and patients8. Integrative 
medicine interventions including, yoga, Tai Chi, hypnosis, acupuncture, meditation, and other modalities 
have shown to improve physical and emotional well -being9.   Muse -S is a clinical grade, headband -style 
wireless EEG system designed to interact with a mobile device (a smartphone or tablet). In combination 
with the Muse -S app running on iOS or Android smartphones, Muse -S converts EEG signals 
measured over the frontal and temporal cerebral cortices into measures of brain state. Calibrated to an 
individual user, Muse -S distinguishes between active and calm brain states to provide real -time 
performance feedback, and helps users realize the benefits of mindfulne ss practice in an engaging and 
accessible manner .  This has been tested in a prior study with patients undergoing breast cancer surgery10. 
 
Study Design and Methods  
 
Methods:   
All study participants will receive the Muse S™ Headband system  and will be asked to use the program 
daily.

 • CES-D (Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_2557] – depressed Mood Scale):  A validated and frequently 
used self -report measure of depressive symptoms.12 
 
Outcomes:  
• Demographics Form :  This form collected demographic and other lifestyle history of the research 
subject.  
• Linear Analogue Self -Assessment (LASA)13-15:  A six -item measure of quality of life (QOL), in which 
QOL is conceptualized as a multidimensional construct with five domains (physical, functional, 
emotional, spi[INVESTIGATOR_37312], and social).  This data will be collected at screen (prior to any treatment), day 14, day 30, day 60, end of treatment day 90, and at  end of study day 180 ([ADDRESS_839821] treatment).   
• Stress :  Will be evaluated through the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)
16,17. The PSS is a 10 -item Likert 
scale that measures global life stress by [CONTACT_629656]. Scores can range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater perceived stress. Reliability is reported as 0.85, with Cronbach alphas ranging from 0.75- 0.86.  
• Widespread Pain Index (WPI)
18:  defined as a [ADDRESS_839822]  This data will be collected 
at screening, end of treatment day 90, and at the end of study day 180 ([ADDRESS_839823] treatment).  
• Numeric Pain Intensity Scale (NPIS):  0 -10 pain assessment scale.  P articipants rate  their pain on a 
scale of 0 to 10. Zero means “no pain,” and 10 means “the worst possible pain” . 
• Sleep Quality: The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI)27-29 is an effective instrument used to 
measure the quality and patterns of sleep in adults. This is a 9- item, likert scale, validated, scoring 
system.  It differentiates “poor” from “good” sleep quality by [CONTACT_629657] (components): subjective sleep qua lity, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, 
use of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_133527], and daytime dysfunction over the last month. 
• Satisfaction with the program : Was it Worth it Questionnaire (WIWI)
19 This satisfaction survey will be 
administered to the participants after completing intervention  and at the end of the study, probing their 
satisfaction with the research study. These data could be used to assess the feasibility of the intervention by [CONTACT_629658]. 
 Adherence to Intervention:  
• Adherence to the Muse -S will be assessed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328] -identified data available within the cloud , 
provided by [CONTACT_629659].  InteraXon only has information per subject through subject ID only 
(as was provided by [CONTACT_629660]), so when the cloud data is provided to Mayo, it will be linked to each subject through their study ID.   
 Intervention:  
• The Muse -S
 Headband system:  
   The Muse -S Headband system  is a brain sensing headband that measures brain activity by [CONTACT_629661].  The Muse -S Headband system  uses a series of focus 
attention training methods to train the brain.  Each focus attention session takes approximately a minimum of 5  minutes, and has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and improve focus and 
productivity.  The Muse -S Headband system  has seven sensors with four channels of EEG data for 
an accurate, high -quality experi ence.  The battery life is approximately five hours and uses an 
industry- standard micro -USB charger. Forty  Muse -S Headband systems  will be provided by [CONTACT_629662].

 Use of Muse -S Headband systems  will be demonstrated to each participant prior to their first 
mindfulness practice session, which will be completed during the baseline visit with the study 
coordinator.  The study coordinator will present the participant with detailed instructions on how to begin each session.  The frequency of the sessions thereafter will be at the participant’s discretion according to the study’s requirements (daily practice). Mindfulness training will follow the protocol in 
the Muse -S app, which follows a standard breathing exercise with EEG brain state feedback through 
the mobile device, as designed by a panel of experienced mindfulness practitioners. In short the Muse -
S is a FitBit like device for the brain.    
 The study participants can access 3 different types of meditation while using the Muse -S Headband 
system.  They are as follows:  
o Mind Meditation  uses the Muse -S headband to track the user's brain activity during 
meditation and translates the  brain's activity into guiding sounds. 
Users get real time feedback to know when their mind is focused 
and when it's distracted, and are cued to return to a state of focused attention (meditation state). Users also see data fro m 
their brain after the meditation. Real time feedback during Mind 
Meditation is the Muse -S signature [CONTACT_629669] a meditation practice - remaining in a calm 
focused attention state and being able to move your mind away 
from distracting thoughts. 
o Guided Meditations.  Guided meditations are 
narrated  meditations on a range of subjects like stress, focus, 
breath,  and body practices.  
o Go-to-sleep Meditations  use the headband and are guided meditations that can be 
combined with an audio sound scape generated from your biosignals (heart rate, brain, and 
movement). Sleep Journeys are designed to help you fall asleep faster. They are intended to be used in bed while you fall asleep to help calm your body and mind and entrain you into sleep. If you fall asleep with the headband on you can wear it through the night if you wish. Some people find Go- to-sleep journeys deeply relaxing and use them  during the day 
as a relaxation tool as well.   
 
All study participants will have access to The Muse -S Headband system’s  customer service team 
based in Toronto, Canada, by [CONTACT_629663].  
o Server Data:  As the patients complete the 10 minute sessions, the information from these 
sessions will be uploaded to the Muse -S secure cloud servers  hosted by [CONTACT_54834] . 
Individual subject data will be visible to each subject  at the end of each session, and data 
from the previous session stored in the “me” tab in the app. S tudy organizers will have 
ongoing access to each subject’s data to monitor compliance and performance. These data can include   the study- specific identification number, gender, and age of the subject,  the 
time and duration of each session, EEG data, heart rate ( PPG) data, and the performance 
(‘percent calm’) score per session. Interaxon’s privacy policy, which can be found at 
www.choosemuse.com/privacy will apply to Interaxon’s use of the subjects’ data. In order 
to maximize protection of the individual’s privacy, the study organizers will ensure that the subjects are assigned anonymized email address and names for use in the Muse - S
TM 
application and when contact[CONTACT_629664] -STM customer support. To ensure that no health

       Page [ADDRESS_839824] agreed to ensure that no health 
data will be shared with Interaxon.   
o Additionally, the data will be made available for aggregate download by [CONTACT_134638], from a secure server at regular intervals until and shortly after the study’s conclusion. The study coordinator may view the patient’s activity via a web browser . 
The Muse -S steps 
include : 1) Open the Muse -S  App on your phone. 2) select meditation type 3) if 
meditating with the headband, turn on the Muse -S  headband.  It will pair via Bluetooth to the app 4) put 
on headband (if doing a meditation with headband) 5) meditate  for minimum of 5 minutes or longer  6) add 
any journal or mood entry if desired 7) review results .  
o Cleaning the Muse -S:  Each patient will be given a brand new, out -of-the-box Muse -S 
Headband system.  If cleaning must occur, the entire Muse -S including the head set can be 
wiped down with a standard disinfectant wipe.  The band can also be hand -washed gently with 
soap and water. The module on the band is not waterproof but  can be wiped with disinfectant. 
 
Subject Retention:  Participants will not be remunerated for participating in this study , but they will be allowed to keep the 
Muse -S™ Headbands.  
 Resources:  
The data entry screens used will be developed via R EDCap for the online forms.  Clinician investigators 
will provide medical oversight. The Muse -S Headband system s are provided at no cost through the 
manufacturer (InteraXon)  for use during study participation.   
 Check all that apply. If none apply, leave blank:  
  The research involves contact [CONTACT_181917], for example, surveys, questionnaires, 
observation, blood draw.  
 Study Design:  
We will use standardized procedures to ensure uniform instructions and support for all subjects for the recruitment, screening, and study entry.    Recruitment:  
Subjects will be recruited from the Fibromyalgia Clinic .  The provider will inform patients of the study at 
time of the ir clinical appointment, and if the patient indicates interest the research staff will meet with the 
patient  to begin the consent process.   
 Consent and Screen:  
Study coordinator will meet with the potential subject who has expressed an interest in participating in the study.  The study coordinator will begin by [CONTACT_629665], and after determining that the subject has continued interest in study participation, will move on to the study consent.  If the subject chooses to consent, the study coordinator will screen the participant for study entry inclusion/exclusion criteria .  If the study entry criteria are met , the subject will begin their study pa rticipation.  They will be 
asked to complete the study surveys/questionnaires .  
 Please note:  Patients must have access to an iOS or Android capable device in order to take part in this 
study in order to interact with the Muse -S Headband system .

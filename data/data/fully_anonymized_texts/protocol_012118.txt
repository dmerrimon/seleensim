 2 INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 COVID -19 
The pandemic due to Coronavirus disease- 19 (COVID -19) caused by [CONTACT_7544]- CoV-2 has led to 
more than 4.7 million deaths globally and 688,000 deaths in the US as of September 27, [ZIP_CODE]. 
SARS- CoV-2 transmission occurs predominantly through oral and nasal routes leading to high 
viral replication in the oropharynx and nasopharynx.  
 
2.2 Q- GRFT  
Q-GRFT  is derived from Griffithsin  (GRFT)  which  is a non-glycosylated protein  consisting of 121 
amino acids. Q -GRFT contains a single amino acid substitution, M78Q variant, resistant to 
oxidation yet maintains the parent molecule’s pharmacological  profile.  
 
Q-GRFT is obtained from Nicotiana benthamiana plants. It targets mannose residues on the 
surface of viral glycoproteins with nanomolar affinity and neutralizes a broad spectrum of 
coronaviruses. Studies in human bronchial  airway epi[INVESTIGATOR_237226] (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_237227] – AIR-100) 
confirm that Q -GRFT inhibits SARS -CoV-2 infection. Intranasal and inhalation griffithsin (GRFT) 
has shown protection against SARS and MERS respectively in animal models. Over the past [ADDRESS_287455] emerged as serious human 
pathogens. Coronavirus envelope Spi[INVESTIGATOR_237228] (S) are very heavily glycosylated, with each 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_237229] [ADDRESS_287456] SARS - 
CoV-2 via a nasal spray can lead to virus inactivation at the sites of viral entry and replication.  
 
2.4 Safety Data:  Q-GRFT  
Pre-Clin ical Safety  
The safety profile of GRFT and Q -GRFT lectins in PBS, saline enema solution and rectal gel 
formulations was found to be excellent. Various published studies had shown absence of immunotoxicity in vitro and in murine models
2-4. GRFT and Q -GRFT are not mitogenic, do not 
activate T -cells, and induce very little alteration in secretion of inflammatory cytokines in treated 
PBMC from 11 different human donors2,4 (IND 130697 Module 4 Study Report UL -20180925). 
These studies also showed no production of inflammatory cytokines in mucosal secretions of 
rabbits treated with free API [INVESTIGATOR_237230]. 
 
Upon repeated administration GRFT and Q -GRFT induce antibody responses at low titers. 
However,  GRFT  polyclonal  antibodies  raised  in rabbits  do not neutralize GRFT’s  antiviral  activity 
(D. Montefiori  and K.E. Palmer,  unpublished).  More  importantly,  Q-GRFT  was found to elicit a 
PREVENT V. 5.0 11 07JUL 22    
 
 systemic antibody response only in the rabbit model and not in rat after 21 consecutive days of 
once- daily intrarectal administration of Q -GRFT gels (IND 130697 Module 4 Study Reports UL - 
20180126 and UL- 20180416). However, there was no localized or systemic toxicity observed at 
any dose of  drug administered. Hence, Q -GRFT is immunogenic but is not immunotoxic (IND 
130697 Module 4 Study Report M334- 17). Moreover, studies described in IND 130697 Module 2 
Sections  2.6.2  and 2.6.4,  show  that despi[INVESTIGATOR_237231],  effective antiviral concentrations 
of drug remain in situ after intrarectal application of Q -GRFT (gel or saline enema formulations). 
Intranasal  Q-GRFT  delivery  to rabbits  showed ADA in few animals  (M495- 21), but none in the rat 
model (Study 1901- 005). These results further suggest the species difference and the observed 
immunogenicity is likely due to the sensitivity of rabbit  model.  
 
The toxicology  program  for Q-GRFT  for IND 130697 assessed gels at 0.3%,  1.0%  and 3.0%  drug 
concentrations in multi- species studies. No toxicity was observed in any model at any dose of 
drug evaluated. Extrapolating to humans, the 1.0% concentration in a gel (10 mg/mL drug) 
delivered at 4 mL application volume, equates to a 40 mg Q -GRFT dose. This level of drug was 
selected as the clinical  dose as it was flanked by [CONTACT_237264],  none  of which  showed toxicity. The drug formulation for clinical administration  was 
changed during development from a gel to a saline enema due to gel compatibility issues with 
condoms. Hence, the saline enema solution was administered in a Phase 1 clinical study: 
PREVENT HIV consists of 40 mg Q -GRFT in 125 mL final  volume.  
 
Intranasal administration of Q -GRFT nasal spray has  been tested in rats and rabbits in Good 
Laboratory Practice (GLP) -compliant toxicity studies. Additionally, genotoxicity was assessed in 
a mouse micronucleus assay and ocular irritation was assessed in NZW rabbits.  
 
Study 1901- 005  was a 30 -day repeat dose study in CD® rats with a 14 -day recovery period. Q - 
GRFT  (7.5 mg/mL)  was administered  by [CONTACT_237265] (SID)  or twice  daily (BID). 
Control groups included SID and BID vehicle control (formulation without Q GRFT) and negative 
control groups (phosphate- buffered saline only). The dose was 0.3375 mg Q -GRFT per 
administration (0.3375 mg/day  for the SID group;  0.675 mg/day  for the BID group),  corresponding 
to approximately 1X and 2X the planned human dose on an API (mg Q GRFT) per nasal surface 
area basis. The second dose for the BID groups was administered [ADDRESS_287457] dose. Evaluations included mortality, clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, 
clinical pathology parameters (hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis), 
toxicokinetic parameters, anti- drug antibody parameters, organ weights, and macroscopic and 
microscopic  examinations.  Results  show  no Q GRFT  related  effects  on any parameter  examined.  
 
O
nce or twice  daily intranasal  admini stration  of Q-GRFT  for 30 days  at dose levels  of 0 (placebo) 
and 0.3375 mg/dose (0, 0.3375, and 0.675 mg/day) to Sprague -Dawley rats resulted in no test 
article -related findings for evaluated parameters (mortality, clinical signs, or effects on body weight 
or macroscopic findings); as well as a lack of immunogenic response. The No -Observed - 
Adverse- Effect- Level (NOAEL) was considered to be 0.675 mg /day (0.3375 mg/dose BID). On 
Day 30, the mean  Cmax  values  at the NOAEL  were  BLQ and 4.20 ng/mL,  for males  and females 
respectively.  
 
Study M495 -21 is a fifteen -day repeat -dose intranasal and intravenous toxicity study of Q -GRFT 
in New Zealand White Rabbit s with a two -week recovery period. Immunogenicity and 
toxicokinetics assessment was conducted to determine potential toxic effects, identify target organ 
of toxicity, and estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the NOAEL of test article 
following a s ingle -day (Interim Arm, Phase A) or once daily intranasal or intravenous (IV) dose 
administration to New Zealand White rabbits for 15 days followed by a two- week recovery period 
(Main and Recovery Arms, Phase B).  
 
The I
V route of administration was proposed to determine the potential systemic toxicity of the 
test article and allow the highest dose of the test article to be administered. The test articles for 
IV 
PREVENT V. 5.0 12 07JUL 22    
 
 administration was Q -GRFT in Phosphate- buffered Saline (PBS) and corresponding vehicle. IV 
arms included vehicle control Group 2 (IV vehicle, 0 mg API) and Q -GRFT IV treatment Group 5 
(IV, 1.29 mg API, corresponding to approximately  10X the proposed human  intranasal  dose  on a 
weight  basis).  
 
The intranasal route is the proposed route for prevention of SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_287458] 
formulation and corresponding vehicle control. Intranasal dose treatment of vehicle control was 
administered on Day 1 to animals in Group 1 (intranasal vehicle, 0 mg API), and test article Q -
GRFT was administered to Group 3 (intranasal, 1.5 mg API; approximately 1.5X the human intranasal dose on a mg/surface area basis) and Group 4 (intranasal, 3 mg API; 3X the human intranasal dose on a mg/surface  area basis).  Each  intranasal  -dose  volume was administered  in 
0.05 ml treatment increments  alternating  briefly,  pausing  between nares  to deliver  the entire 
volume.  Each  treatment group consisted of a single dose arm (Phase A) and a 15- day multidose 
arm (Phase  B). 
 
The results of the Phase A single dose interim analysis found that there were no toxicologically relevant changes seen in clinical observations, body weights, clinical chemistry, hematology, 
coagulation or urinalysis parameters. There were no macroscopic or microscopic findings 
identified in histology that were considered test article related. The multidose Phase B portion of 
the study showed no test  article -related mortalities or macroscopic findings. No toxicologically 
relevant differences were seen in clinical observations, body weights, clinical chemistry, 
hematology, coagulation, or urinalysis parameters. There were incidences of test -article related 
microscopic findings noted for intranasally treated animals, however, these incidences were scored “minimal” to “mild”. Specifically, intranasally treated rabbits showed increased incidences 
and/or  severity  of mixed  cell inflammation  and increased alveolar  macrophages  in the lung of low 
dose and high dose males and females. A complete recovery was observed in male rabbits and 
partial  recovery  in female rabbits.  Of note,  the same  effects  were  observed  sporadically  in control 
animals, although at lower severity. This effect may be due to dosing material entering the lungs 
and may therefore be an indirect  effect  of the protein  drug substance  in the lungs,  and not a direct 
effect due to Q -GRFT’s mode of action. Some evidence of systemic immunogenicity was seen 
with detectable and/or low yet quantifiable amounts of anti -drug antibodies (ADAs) noted in [ADDRESS_287459] to the lack of ADA observed in the 30- day rat exposure 
study. The results also underpin the sensitivity of the species, with the rabbit model showing 
higher sensitivity than rat for immunological and other toxicological findings. Based on these 
findings, the MTD of Q -GRFT is considered equal to or greater than 3 mg API [INVESTIGATOR_237232] 1.29 mg API [INVESTIGATOR_237233] 15 days. 
The NOAEL was not observed for intranasal dose treatment and is therefore considered to be less than 1.5 mg API [INVESTIGATOR_237234] a day for 15 days.  The NOAEL  for intravenous 
administration was greater than 1.29 mg API [INVESTIGATOR_237235] 15  days.

 as a five day repeat dose eye irritation study Q -GRFT intranasal dose 
formulation  in New Zealand White  Rabbits.  The objective of this study  was to determine the ocular 
irritation potential of Q -GRFT, formulated for intranasal delivery, after once daily single ocular 
(topi[INVESTIGATOR_15416]) treatment at 0.75 or 1.5 mg  administered to the right eye, or twice daily (BID) 
treatment at 1.5 mg to the right eye (total dose of 3 mg/day) administered for 5 consecutive days 
to New Zealand White rabbits. Control Group 1 received twice daily administration of the control 
vehicle to the right eye. The left eye served as the untreated control eye for each animal. Three 
male and female rabbits were assigned to each treatment group. The human dose is 3 mg/ 
intranasal administration and hence the BID animals received the full human clinical dose daily 
for [ADDRESS_287460] -dose 
showed that all animals appeared normal with no adverse findings. No statistically significant  
PREVENT V. 5.0 13 07JUL 22    
 
 changes in group mean body weight was observed compared with controls and all animals 
maintained or gained weight over the course of the study.  
 
No adverse ocular effects were observed following once daily administration of Q GRFT at 0.75 
or 1.5 mg once daily, or twice daily administration of 1.5 mg (3 mg total) for [ADDRESS_287461] 3 mg (1.5 mg twice daily).  
 
Study G529 -[ADDRESS_287462] of Q -GRFT on mouse bone marrow to rule out potential 
genetic toxicity caused by [CONTACT_27178] Q- GRFT API. The objective of this study was to evaluate 
the capacity of Q -GRFT to induce chromosomal or mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_237236],  as indicated by [CONTACT_237266],  RNA - 
containing erythrocytes  (polychromatic  erythrocytes,  PCE).  Male  and female  Swiss  Webster  mice 
(Mus musculus) [ADDRESS_287463] species (5M/5F per group). Doses ranged from 0  
to 20 mg/kg Q- GRFT;  the highest  dose  equated  to 465-times  Human  Equivalent  Dose  (20 mg/kg 
mouse/0.043 mg/kg human) if the 3 mg of clinically administered drug (IN) were to be totally 
absorbed. The animals were administered Q GRFT PBS solution or PBS vehicle control solution 
intravenously on Day 1, or urethane positive control solution by [CONTACT_16759], via a single 
administration of test article on Day 1. Mortality and morbidity were observed twice daily and 
clinical observations  once daily.  Body  weights  were  measured at pre-dose  for the purpose  of dose 
calculation. Necropsies were on Days [ADDRESS_287464] conditions used in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus 
assay. By [CONTACT_237267], Q -GRFT is not  genotoxic.  
 
Clinical Safety  
Q-GRFT has been tested in two clinical studies as part of development for a separate indication 
(prevention of HIV infection). The PREVENT HIV rectal microbicide Phase 1 study was initiated 
in 2019 at the University  of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109].  The study  is entitled:  “A Randomized,  Double- Blind  Phase  
1 Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of Q- Griffithsin Enema Administered Rectally to HIV -1 
Seronegative Adults” ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The purpose of this first in human (FIH) Phase 1 clinical 
study was to assess the safety, tolerability, and acceptability of a single dose of Q -GRFT enema 
in healthy  adult  participants  (aged  18-45 years), practicing  receptive anal intercourse  (RAI).  Study 
participants were topi[INVESTIGATOR_44800] a single rectal dose of study product consisting of either 
40 mg of Q -GRFT in a 125 ml saline enema or a 125 mL saline placebo. The study enrolled 21 
participants, with 15 participants receiving the Q -GRFT enema. To date, the study has reported 
three mild (Grade 2 or lower)  AEs with all lab values  being within  reference  ranges.  Q-GRFT  was 
not detectable in plasma after administration in any participant.  Although preliminary,  the findings 
of this FIH study of mucosally administered Q -GRFT antiviral lectin are reassuring from the 
standpoint of safety and tolerability. 
 
GRFT  has also been  investigated by [CONTACT_237268] (www.popcouncil.org)  as a potential 
HIV prophylactic.  In a FIH study  in 15 female  volunteers,  griffithsin/carrageenan gel administered 
vaginally for up to [ADDRESS_287465] not yet been published but were 
presented at the HIV R4P conference in October  [ZIP_CODE]. 
 
2.5 PK Data : Q-GRFT  
Intranasal administration of Q -GRFT to rats and rabbits indicated low levels of Q -GRFT reach 
systemic circulation with this route of administration. In a rat PK/BA study of Q -GRFT, very low 
levels of systemic exposure were observed after QD and BID intranasal administration, with 
highest plasma level of 14.44 ng/mL, which corresponds to an estimated 0.15% of dose administered In a 30 day multi -dose study, rats with once daily or twice daily intranasal 
administration, low levels of Q -GRFT in plasma (1.02 – 21.6 ng/mL) were detected in some 
animals  up to [ADDRESS_287466]-dose.  Single  day intranasal  administration  of Q-GRFT  nasal  solution 
(same as clinical formulation) to rabbits showed mean apparent Cmax of 17.1 ng/ml (male) at  a 
PREVENT V. 5.0 14 07JUL 22    
 
 dose of 1.5 mg and 137 ng/ml (males) and 63.2 ng/ml (females) at the 3 mg dose. Q -GRFT was 
eliminated with a mean terminal  t1/2 of 15.8 hr (males)  and 18.8 hr (females)  in the 3 mg intranasal 
group. Repeated daily intranasal administration of Q -GRFT nasal solution to rabbits for 15 days 
showed that the mean apparent Cmax on Day 15 was 61.7 ng/ml (female) at a dose of 1.5 mg, 
and 63.3 ng/ml  (males)  and 147 ng/ml  (females)  at a dose  of [ADDRESS_287467] was 1,866 hr*ng/ml in 3 mg dosed females and 
733 hr*ng/ml in 1.5 mg dosed females on Day 15. The bioavailability of intranasal Q -GRFT is 
0.1% in Phase B after repeated administrations, and therefore, accumulation is unlikely to be an 
issue in human studies.  A slight  (~2x single  exposure),  increase  in exposure was seen with repeat 
dose intranasal  (3 mg dose),  however,  this increase was statistically  non-significant  (P>0.05)  and 
observed in only few  animals.  
 
Results of a single- administration PK/BA study showed that the average t1/2 of Q -GRFT DS 
delivered intravenously (IV) in male and female Sprague- Dawley rats is 6 -7 hours (Study B949 - 
17; see IND 130697). Single dose of IV administered Q- GRFT in male and female rabbits also 
showed a similar terminal t1/2 of 7.7- 9.4 h. Whereas, 15- day daily IV administration of Q -GRFT 
had a mean terminal t1/[ADDRESS_287468] on Day 15 (74,825  h*ng/ml  in males  and 96,992 
h*ng/ml in females) was over 5- fold greater than the mean AUC last on Day 1 (13,454 h*ng/ml in 
males and 17,329 h*ng/ml in females) in IV Group 5 (1.29 mg Q -GRFT). The accumulation of Q - 
GRFT on Day 15 in the IV group might be due to a saturation of metabolism and/or elimination 
pathways of the API. Q -GRFT was not bioavailable intrarectally at either the 0.3% (2.5 mg/kg) or 
3.0% (25 mg/kg) Q -GRFT formulations. The amount of Q -GRFT to be applied intranasally is 
significantly less than the rectal dose and Q -GRFT is not expected to be systemically absorbed 
in significant levels from the nasal  application.  
 
Similarly, analyses of rat and rabbit sera from animals administered Q -GRFT carbopol 
formulations  in GLP-compliant  studies  (21-day repeat -dose plus 14-day recovery,  Studies  M333- 
17 and M334 -17) showed no Q -GRFT in any of the samples. These results demonstrated that 
neither  Q-GRFT  DS nor gel-formulated DP are absorbed systemically  when delivered intrarectally 
to rats and rabbits for up to 21 -consecutive days at doses up to 3%  API. 
 
In PREVENT HIV, the Phase 1 study examining safety and tolerability of rectal administration of Q-GRFT, Q -GRFT was not detectable in plasma after administration in any participant.  
 
The length of time that Q -GRFT persists in the nasal mucosa after intranasal administration in 
humans is currently not known and will be examined in this trial. Based on in vivo studies in rats 
and rabbits, intranasal administration of Q -GRFT  may result in low levels of systemic exposure.  
 
2.6 Summary  
Q-GRFT has demonstrated excellent safety in prior in vitro and ex vivo tissue studies, in vivo 
animal studies in three species and preliminarily in human rectal studies. Although there are 
differences  between the rectal  and nasal  mucosae,  there  are also similarities,  and we believe that 
much of the nonclinical information generated for topi[INVESTIGATOR_237237]. Mucosal surface area exposure in the proposed 
Phase 1 study is lower by a factor of 6 -7 than previous studies. These results are sufficient to 
initiate a Phase 1 study for intranasal application of Q -GRFT spray as a prophylactic for SARS -
CoV-2. The successful completion of this study will inform decisions about whether nasal 
administration of Q -GRFT is  safe.

 7 STUDY  PROCEDURES  
This section describes visit -specific study procedures.  
 
7.1 Pre-Screening  
As part of participant outreach and recruitment strategies, study staff may pre- screen potential 
study participants (e.g. via telephone using an IRB approved screening script). During these 
interactions, study staff may explain the study to participants and ascertain elements of 
presumptive eligibility, to be confirmed at an on -site screening visit. If the participant is eligible 
based on a screening script the per son’s name [CONTACT_237288]. 
If the person signs  consent,  the telephone script will then become  part of the research  record.  If the 
person does not sign consent, the form will be de-identified.  
 
7.2 Visit 1: Screening Visit  
At the Screening Visit,  participants  will provide written  informed  consent  prior to study  procedures. 
Study personnel will collect participant locator Information, demographic, and medical history information.  The participants will undergo a physical examination including a visual examination  
of the nose  and throat  using a lighted instrument (otoscope) .  Safety  labs will be obtained,  and for 
female participants of child- bearing potential, a urine  pregnancy  test will be performed. A  
nasopharyngeal  swab  will be collected  for SARS- CoV-2 testing  per local standards.  Participants 
who meet all eligibility criteria will be scheduled for the enrollment visit (Visit 2) within [ADDRESS_287485] at the Screening visit.

• In between screening and enrollment or Visits 3 and 4 if laboratory tests need to be repeated due to out of range values  
PREVENT V. 5.0 25 07JUL 22    
 
 • For administrative reasons, e.g., a participant may have questions for study staff, or may 
need to re -schedule a follow -up visit. 
• In response to AEs. When interim contacts or visits are completed in response to 
participant  reports  of AEs,  study  staff will assess the reported event  clinically  and provide 
or refer the participant t o appropriate medical care.  
• In the event of laboratory processing issues (i.e., lost or inadequate sample)  
• For other reasons at participant  request.  
 
Details of the interim visit will be recorded in the chart notes.

 8 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY AND CLINICAL  MANAGEMENT  
 
8.1 Safety Monitoring  
The study site investigator is responsible for continuous close safety monitoring of all study 
participants, and for alerting the Protocol Chair if unexpected concerns arise.  
 
8.2 Clinical Data Safety  Review  
Appropriate safety monitoring will be contingent upon excellent communication between study 
participants and study staff. Data collected from participants will include changes in medical status, concomitant medications and side effects. All adverse events will be reported as outlined in the study protocol and will be monitored by [CONTACT_5984], investigators, and an Independent 
Safety Monitor on a regular basis. Any immediate safety concerns will be brought to the 
attention of the Principal Investigator. Adverse events will be reported to the IRB as required by 
[CONTACT_31475].  
 
An Independent Safety Monitor who is familiar with the pertinent scientific literature related to intranasal medications and potential side effects will be responsible for safety monitoring. This 
individual will be a physician independent of the study sponsor and the principal investigators 
and will be available to monitor data from this single site. The Independent Safety Monitor  
will evaluate adverse event data on a routine basis to determine whether the study protocol 
should continue as originally designed, should be changed, or should be terminated. Any 
change to the anticipated benefit -to-risk ratio identified will be reported to the IRB. In addition, 
any breaches of confidentiality will be reported for review.  
 
8.3 Adverse Events  Definitions  
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the study  product.  An AE can therefore  be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not  related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product (see the ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions 
and Standards for Expedited Reporting).  
 
SAEs  will be defined by [CONTACT_237272]  (Version 
2.0, January 2010), as AEs occurring at any dose  that: 
• Results in  death  
• Is life -threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Results in persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be immediately life- threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_237247], except for possible life- threatening events, for which 
they will be instructed to seek immediate emergency care. Where feasible and medically 
appropriate, participants will be encouraged to seek evaluation at UPMC Magee -Womens 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], where the study clinicians are based, and to request that a study clinician be contact[CONTACT_18110]. All participants reporting a clinically significant untoward medical occurrence 
will be followed either  in person or by [CONTACT_237273]  (returns  to baseline)  or 
stabilizes over a four -week  period.  
PREVENT V. 5.0 28 07JUL 22    
 
 For each study participant, AE documentation and reporting will be undertaken throughout the 
scheduled duration of follow -up. 
 
The Protocol chair/designee will grade the severity of each AE and the relationship of the AE to 
study product:  
 
AE severity will be graded per the DAIDS Table for Grading Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, 
Version 2.1, July [ADDRESS_287497]  AEs will not be specifically  identified in the DAIDS  toxicity  table  and will 
be graded by [CONTACT_237274].  
 
Table 8: DAIDS toxicity table  
 
 
Relatedness is an assessment made by a study clinician of whether the event is related to the 
study agent. Degrees of relatedness will be categorized according to current DAIDS -approved 
guidelines. Per the Manual for Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events to DAIDS (Version 2.0, 
January 2010), the relationship categories that will be used for this study are:  
• Related: There is a reasonable possibility that the AE may be related to the study  agent(s)  
• Not Related: There is not a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study  agent(s)  
 
All AEs will be captured through REDCap on an AE log form. The form should be reviewed  at each  
study  visit and updated as needed. For any serious AEs (SAEs) that are continuing at a 
participant’s study exit visit, the Protocol chair or designee must establish a clinically appropriate follow- up plan for the AE. At a minimum, the AE must be re- assessed by [CONTACT_237275] 2 
weeks after the participant’s study exit visit; additional evaluations also may take place at t he 
discretion of the PI/designee. The same approach must be taken for any AEs deemed related to study product that are found to have increased in severity at the study exit visit. For those AEs 
requiring re- assessment, if the AE has not resolved or stabil ized at the time of re- assessment, 
study staff will continue to re -assess the participant at least once per month while the study is 
ongoing. After the study  has ended,  all AEs requiring re-assessment  will be re-assessed at least  
once within  the 30- [ADDRESS_287498]  event  or not. 

PREVENT V. 5.0 29 07JUL 22    
 
 Adverse events will be elicited at each follow -up visit. Referral to appropriate care will be offered 
to participants as needed.  
Any Grade 3 AE’s  that are deemed to be related to the study product will be reviewed within [ADDRESS_287499] immediately after 
placement, the site clinician will remove any residual drug with a sterile saline wash and a 
moistened swab if necessary . 
 
8.6 Criteria for Early Termination of Study Participation  
Participants may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. The Site 
PI/designee also may withdraw participants from the study to protect their safety and/or if they are unwilling or unable to comply with required study procedures. Participants also may be withdrawn 
if the study sponsors, government or regulatory authorities, including the Office of Human 
Research Protections (OHRP), or site IRBs/ECs terminate the study prior to its planned end date. Every reasonable effort is made to complete a final evaluation of participants who withdraw or are 
withdrawn from the study prior to completing follow -up. Study staff members will record the 
reason(s) for all withdrawals in participants’ study  records.  
PREVENT V. 5.[ADDRESS_287500] in human multi -day dose  phase 1 randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled 
study to evaluate safety after 14 doses of Q -GRFT prepared in saline. The primary aim of the 
study is to assess the local and systemic safety of nasally administered Q -GRFT in healthy 
adults. The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants who experience a Grade 2 or 
higher related adverse event.  
 
9.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
Accrual of approximately 45 evaluable participants is expected to take 6 months. The expected 
duration of study  participation for each participant  will be approximately  6-8 weeks.  This includes 
the screening period. Participants will be randomized 2:1 (Q -GRFT nasal spray: placebo nasal 
spray)  resulting  in [ADDRESS_287501]. The proposed total sample 
size is N=45  divided into 2 arms  (Q-GRFT  and placebo assigned at a 2:1 ratio). The sample size 
is based on the exact binomial probability of observing at least two Grade 2 or higher related adverse  events  in the Q-GRFT  arm. Table 1 gives  the upper  and lower  bounds  for the 95% exact 
binomial confidence intervals of the true Grade 2 or higher adverse event rate at all possible numbers of observed events in a group of size 30. Note that the results for more than 50% of 
events in each group are not listed, but by [CONTACT_237276] 1- the listed rate and 
95% CI for the number  of non-events.  If none of the 30 participants  experience Grade  2 or higher 
adverse events, the 95% exact 2 -sided upper confidence bound for the Grade 2 adverse event 
rate is 11.6%.  In a Cochrane review  of intranasal  steroids  for rhinosinusitis,  the rate of any adverse 
event  was 5.5%
8. If similar  event  rates  are observed in the proposed study,  we will be able to rule 
out Grade 2 or higher adverse event rates greater than 22.1% in the Q -GRFT study  arm.

are ready for final analysis.  
 
Unblinding may need to be performed on an individual basis for assessment of a serious AE 
and/or for the safety of the participant. Details of emergency unblinding are specified in an SOP.  
 
9.5 Randomization  
The randomization scheme will be generated and maintained by a member of the Data 
Management Center at Magee- Womens Research Institute and supplied to the Pharmacy at 
Magee- Womens  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Participants  will be randomized to the sequence  of the two nasal  spray 
formulations, active or placebo, in a 2:1 ratio using a permuted block design with random block sizes of 3 and 6. To minimize bias in the group assignment, participants will be given study 
randomization numbers. Participants will be randomized using REDCap’s randomization module to obtain the sequence of product  assignment.  When  a participant  is ready  to be randomized,  the 
study  investigator (PI/Co -I) will open the Randomization eCRF  in REDCap  and confirm  that the 
participant  is being enrolled. REDCap will then assign a randomization number which the study 
investigator (PI/Co -I) will print and take to the pharmacy to obtain the study product indicated by 
[CONTACT_237279]. The study  product  will be labeled in order  to mask  the product  
assignment  to the participants  and study staff. The randomization scheme will be created for a 
total of 48 participants.  
 
9.6 Data Monitoring and Analysis  
9.6.1  Data  Monitoring  
PREVENT V. 5.0 32 07JUL 22    
 
 This clinical trial will be conducted  in compliance with the protocol,  GCP  guidelines,  and applicable 
regulatory requirements. All paper research charts are maintained in locked files in a locked room. 
The data management  research staff, under the direction of the primary investigator, will create 
and maintain databases using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) which is a secure, 
validated, web- based application designed for clinical trial data collection . The databases will be 
backed up nightly, weekly, and monthly onto the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]’s server’s back -up 
system. Appropriate firewall and virus scanning software are installed and updated routinely by 
[CONTACT_237280].  
 
This study will utilize electronic data capture. Site staff will enter data as collected directly into a 
data entry system. Study data management staff will review the electronic data elements for completeness and accuracy. If there are any responses that are incomplete, unclear, or 
inconsistent with related data elements, the staff person will communicate with the clinician in 
question as  soon  as possible to resolve  the problem.  If necessary,  the study  staff will make the 
appropriate change in the electronic database which tracks time, date, and by [CONTACT_20898] a change is  
made.  
 
9.6.[ADDRESS_287507] using frequencies and percent. Individual participants will contribute once to the calculation of event rates. Differences in the prevalence of adverse events between the study 
arms will be assessed using Fisher’s exact test.  
 
Descriptive statistics (frequency, medians, range, means, standard deviation) will be used to 
summarize the secondary and exploratory endpoints. Differences in Q -GRFT concentration and 
BSIT  score between the study  arms  will be evaluated using Student’s  t- or Mann Whitney  U tests, 
where appropriate. Fisher’s exact tests will be used to assess differences in the presence of Q- 
GRFT in the gastrointestinal tract and dichotomized acceptability endpoints between the two study 
arms. Spearman’s correlation coefficients Fisher’s exact, and Mann- Whitney U tests may be used 
in exploratory analyses to evaluate the impact of gender, age and race on the pharmacokinetics 
and acceptability of the Q -GRFT nasal  spray.  
 
9.6.3  Analysis Cohort  
The intent -to-treat cohort (ITT) will be defined as those who were enrolled. It will be used for 
analyses of baseline characteristics, protocol deviations and violations, and trial conduct. The evaluable cohort (Eval) is a subset of ITT participants. Evaluable participants will be defined as participants who complete Visit [ADDRESS_287508] obtained IRB approval. The investigators will 
permit audits by [CONTACT_237281].  
 
10.1 Special  Populations  
Study staff will offer screening to people of all ethnic and racial groups. Members of the study staff are not seeking the screening or enrollment people in special or vulnerable populations.  
 
Women and Minorities  
SARS- CoV-2 uninfected women and men of all races and ethnicities represented at the Magee- 
Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_237248]. Men and women who provide written informed consent and meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled. It is anticipated 
that gender  distribution of the 45 study  participants  will be approximately  60% female  (n=27)  and 
approximately 40% male (n=18). While SARS- CoV-2 infects women and men equally, a larger 
proportion of female participants is anticipated based on the recruitment population available at Magee- Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Allegheny county, the location of Magee -Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], has a 
population of approximately 2.2 million and is comprised of 89% white not Hispanic, 13% black or 
African American, 2% Hispanic, 4% Asian, 2% mixed race and 0.2% American Indian. The 
anticipated study population is expected to reflect the distribution of Allegheny County residents, 
except  for Black  or African  Americans  who will be recruited  preferentially  to comprise  at least  20% 
of the study population since blacks and African Americans are disproportionately impacted by

Risk/Benefit Statement  
Risks  
It is not expected that this study will expose healthy participants to unreasonable risk. While this 
is the first in human  multi -day dose assessment of Q-GRFT  administered  intranasally,  Q-GRFT  is 
under evaluation n a Phase I clinical trial as a rectal enema product for HIV prevention at Magee -
Womens Research  Institute  within  an NIAID  U19 funded collaboration between the University  of 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_237249] (U19 AI113182, K. Palmer Program Director). No safety issues have been identified to date in [ADDRESS_287512] received a single dose 
enema containing 10mg/mL of Q -GRFT in phosphate buffered saline.  
 
As with any intranasally administered product, nasal congestion, nasal discharge, nasal burning, 
nasal irritation, increased mucus, nasal dryness, sneezing, coughing, pharyngitis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], 
mucosal  erythema,  nasal  ulceration,  interference with taste  and smell,  tinnitus, and headache are 
potential risks and participants will be closely monitored for these. Hypersensitivity reactions 
(including contact  [CONTACT_237283])  are rare risks with any product.  As the drug is intended to 
work  at the mucosal surface, systemic side eff ects are presumed to be exceptionally unlikely. 
Nonetheless, safety labs including CBC with platelets, AST, ALT, total bilirubin and creatinine will 
be checked pre and post administration. 
 
A rare but potentially life -threatening risk of exposure to nasal spray containing Q GRFT or the 
placebo spray  would  be anaphylaxis.  Risk will be mitigated by [CONTACT_237284] 1  hour 
after application.  
 
Additional Ris ks: 
Nasal  specimen collection  may cause mild discomfort  and/or  nasal  spotting.  Oropharyngeal  swab 
collection  may induce a gag reflex  and cause  mild discomfort.  Nasopharyngeal swabs  may cause 
discomfort, eyes to water, coughing/gagging. Phlebotomy may lead to discomfort, feelings of dizziness or faintness, bruising, swelling and/or infection. Collecting a rectal swab may cause 
discomfort. Testing positive for SARS- CoV-[ADDRESS_287513] a participant’s social and work 
schedule. Testing positive for  pregnancy may cause anxiety.  
 
Potential participants will be screened for SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_287514] result will necessitate that the Allegheny  County  Health  Department be notified;  the potential  participant  will be counselled  about 
this possibility which would likely result in a period of self -quarantine and disruption to his or her 
daily life.  
 
Participation in clinical research includes the risks of loss of confidentiality and discomfort with 
personal nature of questions  
 
Benefits  
Participation in these studies may have no direct benefit to volunteers. All volunteers will receive 
a SARS- CoV-[ADDRESS_287515]  names 
and other protected health information is kept in a secure location. All computer information about 
study  volunteers  is kept on a computer  with log-on passwords.  Laboratory  specimens  are labeled 
with study numbers and date and are delivered by [CONTACT_464]. In addition to the research study 
staff, NCI, study  monitors,  University  of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_237250], and/or the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_237251]’s health information. Each member of the staff has log- on identification and password, logs off before 
leaving a computer screen unattended, and closes their office door when out of the office. All research records will be kept for a minimum of seven years following closure of this study (per University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_237252]).  
 
10.5 Communicable Diseas e Reporting  
Study staff members will comply with all local requirements to report communicable diseases including SARS- CoV-2 identified among study participants to the Allegheny County Health 
Department. Study investigators will include discussion of mandated reporting during the study informed consent process.  
 
10.6 Stud y Pause/ Discontinuation  
NCI or the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_237253]. Ongoing safety monitoring will track the incidence of AEs.  
The study will be paused  if the following should occur:  
• Two or more Grade [ADDRESS_287516]  
• Any Grade [ADDRESS_287517] CONTAINMENT

5 1.0  INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Prostate Cancer: The Concept of Overtreatmen t 
Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non -cutaneous cancer among US men. 
Approximately 192,000 new cases were identified in 2009 (1). Although prostate cancer is 
the second leading cause of cancer death among US men, the probability of dying fro m 
prostate cancer is relatively low. The lifetime risk of prostate cancer diagnosis is 16%, but the lifetime risk of death from prostate cancer is only 3% (1). This discrepancy between prostate cancer incidence and mortality, due in large part to detection of pre -symptomatic 
tumors by [CONTACT_862579] -specific antigen (PSA) assay, is distinct among cancers. As a 
result of widespread PSA testing, 50% of newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients now 
present with localized, lower -risk disease (2).  
Most patients with lower -risk prostate cancer are treated with surgery or radiation (3). 
Although the probability of cure with these modalities is high, both are associated with 
urinary, bowel, and sexual morbidities that significantly diminish quality of life (4, 5). More over, despi[INVESTIGATOR_862547]- free, whether 
the treatments actually reduce prostate cancer -specific or overall mortality in lower -risk 
patients is not known. Many men with localized, higher -risk prostate cancer have 
aggressive disease that warrants aggressive intervention (6); many others, with lower -risk, 
generally indolent prostate cancer, even younger men likely to live 15 years or more from 
diagnosis, derive few, if any, survival benefits from treatment (7 -10). 
Population studies suggest that a substantial proportion of men diagnosed with lower -
risk prostate cancer in the US are over -treated (2 -4). In a recent study of the US SEER 
registry, Miller and colleagues concluded that approximately 50% of men with lower -risk 
prostate cancer received unnecessarily aggressive treatment, surgery or radiation (4). The 
staggering scope of this public health problem that is, unnecessarily aggressive treatment of lower risk prostate cancer, treatment that diminishes quality of lif e for tens of 
thousands of US men each year, challenges us to develop innovative therapeutic and 
diagnostic models to refine treatment paradigms within this patient population.  
1.2 Active Surveillance (AS) for Lower -Risk Prostate Cancer  
The concept that su bstantial proportions of men diagnosed with lower -risk prostate 
cancer are over -treated has fostered growing interest in a management approach known 
as active surveillance (AS). AS entails vigilant monitoring of men with localized, lower -risk 
prostate cancer by [CONTACT_862580], frequent digital rectal examinations, and 
intermittent prostate biopsies. Intervention with surgery, radiation, or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_862548] (9,11 -16). 
Active surveillance protocols for identification of patients with lower -risk disease vary by 
[CONTACT_14189], but are generally similar. Clinical criteria for enrollment in a surveillance 
program typi[INVESTIGATOR_862549] < 10 ng/mL, tumor that is non -palpable, or palpable 
but small on digital rectal examination (clinical stage T1 or T2) and lower -risk tumor 
characteristics on prostate biopsy, namely, low -grade (Gleason sum ≤ 6) and low- volume 
(tumor evident only in a small number and percentage of biopsy cores) disease (9,11 -16). 
Similarly, while there remains no clinical consensus, disease progression while on surveillance is broadly defined as a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_862550] (manifested as decreased PSA doubling time or increased PSA velocity) or worrisome pathology on repeat biopsy  
(Gleason score ≥ 7 or increased tumor volume) (9,11 -16). 
In carefully selected men with lower -risk prostate cancer, AS is a viable and safe 
treatment option. Warlick and colleagues, confirming earlier results (9), observed that patients followed on AS for  up to [ADDRESS_1202431] as likely to be cured of their disease as men who 
underwent surgery immediately after diagnosis (14).  
Approximately 30% of patients on AS will progress based  on current PSA or pathological 
criteria and thus receive intervention with surgery or radiation, typi[INVESTIGATOR_16195] 2 years of 
beginning surveillance (11). The Hopkins data indicate that 31% of patients progress 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE] 
Version Date 09/26/18 Update #10  
6 within 26 months (13, 15). In the Toronto coh ort, 34% progressed after 64 months; 
however, the definition of progression for most of the follow -up period was based on a PSA 
DT of 2 years or pathology progression to Gleason grade 8. Klotz estimated that 20 
percent of patients would progress on the basis of a PSA DT of 3 years, while 5 to 10% would progress on the basis of tumor grade progression. Moreover, up to 12% of men who do not meet objective criteria for progression will opt for intervention (11). Thus, in total, over 40% of men on AS will progr ess or proceed to treatment. Reducing the proportion of 
men who progress or choose treatment while on AS for prostate cancer represents a novel opportunity to minimize treatment- associated morbidity, improve patient quality of life, 
and contain health care  costs.  
1.[ADDRESS_1202432] in the role of diet in the etiology and natural history of prostate cancer (17, 18). Accumulating evidence suggests that diet may alter prostate cancer initiation and progression. Macronutrients and micronutrients associated with decreased prostate cancer risk include retinoids, 
carotenoids (particularly lycopene), cruciferous vegetables, dietary fat, soy products, 
folate, retinol, vitamin D, and omega fatty acids (17- 23). A range of phytochemicals in 
fruits and vegetables could have effects on a metabolically active organ like the prostate, 
and a number of plausible mechanisms have been proposed (24 -39). 
Experimental studies based on cell line and animal models suggest that vegetable intake 
may lessen the risk or retard the progress of prostate cancer. Rats fed tomato powder have decreased prostate- cancer specific mortality compared to controls (24) and, in vitro, 
lycopene inhibits DNA synthesis in prostate epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] (25). Cell line and animal data support the anti -carcinogenic properties of isothiocyanates, which are components of 
cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and cabbage. Isothiocyanates induce expression of cytoprotective phase 2 enzymes in multiple prostate tumor cell lines (26, 31) promote apoptosis of prostate cancer P C-3 cells in vitro, and inhibit growth of PC -3 xenografts in 
nude mice (28). In a prostatectomy model, men fed a tomato intensive diet had distinct 
biological changes potentially associated with suppression of prostate tumors (30).  
Indirect evidence from epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], ecological, case -control and cohort studies in 
humans suggests that altering nutritional intake may provide beneficial effects against 
prostate cancer (18). This evidence suggests a diet that emphasizes vegetable intake and de-emphasizes meat and fat intake may decrease the risk of prostate cancer initiation 
and progression. The most direct evidence for this supposition has been provided by [CONTACT_862581]. Red meat and fat intakes tend to be associated with in creased risk (particularly of aggressive cancer); cruciferous vegetables 
and tomatoes and tomato products tend to be most closely associated with decreased risk 
(20-23, 33).  
Recent observational data also indicate that weight loss may alter the natural hi story of 
prostate cancer: among men in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, weight 
loss >11 lbs over 10 years was associated with a 40% reduction for high -grade cancer risk 
(34). Follow up of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial cohort indicated that a BMI > 30 kg/m
2 was associated with an 18% decreased risk of low -grade prostate cancer and a 
29% increased risk of high -grade prostate cancer (35). Low serum cholesterol was 
associated in this same study with decreased risk of high grade prostate cancer (36).  
To date, human experimental evidence supporting epi[INVESTIGATOR_862551]- clinical findings, 
though intriguing, is limited. Isothiocyanates derived from cruciferous vegetables enter 
the human prostate following oral consumption and may be associate d with anti -
carcinogenic, phase 2 enzyme activity in prostate tissue (29, 31). In a small intervention 
study, patients with recurrent prostate cancer experienced decreased PSA doubling times six months after beginning treatment with diet modification and stress reduction (37). In another small clinical trial of active surveillance patients, randomization to a plant -based 
diet with micronutrient supplements and intensive lifestyle changes resulted in decreased 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date 09/26/18 Update #10  
7 serum PSA concentrations, inhibition of prostate  cancer cell growth, and progression to 
active treatment; (38) another non -randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_862552] a similar intervention 
(plant based whole foods coupled with exercise and stress management) resulted in 
significant changes in prostate gene expression (39).  
These studies provide preliminary clinical evidence that diet change may slow prostate 
cancer progression. Still, they were small studies with only short -term (~ 1 year) follow-
up. Moreover, as it is impossible to isolate the effects of diet from those of exercise, stress management, and group support, these changes in PSA and cancer cell growth cannot with certainty be attributed solely to dietary change. On the other hand, the most likely factor driving these changes is diet. In addition, whether intensive lifestyle modifications such as exercise, yoga, and stress management would be practicable, sustainable behaviors in large groups of patients remain to be seen. An adequately powered trial, focusing on diet as a primary form of intervention, i s needed.  
We previously designed and implemented a telephone- based dietary intervention for 
prostate cancer patients based on well -established principles of social cognitive theory. 
This relatively straightforward intervention, the first to use diet change as a primary 
treatment for low risk prostate cancer, produced robust, beneficial diet changes (i.e. 
significantly increased vegetable intakes) and led to increased plasma levels of potentially 
anti-carcinogenic carotenoids in prostate cancer patients (40 -42). We believe that the next 
step is to determine, in a suitable study sample, whether these diet changes, marked by [CONTACT_862582], will exert a clinically relevant and sustainable effect 
on prostate cancer progression.  
1.4 Dietary In tervention in an Active Surveillance (AS) Population  
Men on AS represent a compelling population for studying diet change and prostate 
cancer for at least [ADDRESS_1202433], approximately 100,000 men are diagnosed with lower -
risk prostate cancer every year in the US. Some 42% of men on AS progress to treatment 
(30% because of disease progression, 12% because of anxiety); reducing this proportion 
represents a realistic and valuable therapeutic and public health goal (8, 9, 11, 13). Second, clinically localize d, lower -risk cancer may potentially be more affected by [CONTACT_862583], aggressive disease. If diet is related to the risk of prostate cancer, it may well exert an impact on the earliest phases of prostate cancer; its impact may best be  tested in an AS population. Third, AS patients are not receiving active 
therapy (i.e. radiation, surgery, or androgen) that would otherwise obscure or modify any beneficial effects of dietary change. Finally, AS patients would likely be receptive to nutritional interventions with proven benefits for cardiovascular and overall health (8, 11, 
43). 
Indeed, because prostate cancer diagnosis is a source of considerable anxiety and 
diminished quality of life for many patients diagnosed with lower -risk disease (44-46), 
dietary change might not only exert therapeutic biological effects on the tumor, but might also encourage men with lower -risk prostate cancer and no signs of progression to remain 
within an AS program. As previously noted, up to 12% of patients wi th no objective PSA 
or pathologic indications of progression nonetheless opt for treatment that may not improve their prognosis (11). Treatment preferences in this situation are generally believed to arise, to a large extent, from patient anxiety and discomfort over not receiving curative therapy. This attitude is likely fostered by [CONTACT_862584] -oriented approach that 
characterizes our current health care system (8). However, prostate cancer -related anxiety 
and its effects on treatment choice have not as yet been prospectively studied in an AS 
population. 
Diet change presents an ideal opportunity for AS patients to alter the perception of their 
disease by [CONTACT_862585]. This approach may dissuade 
otherwise lower -risk men from purs uing unnecessarily aggressive, morbidity- generating 
treatments. Such an approach would promulgate a novel therapeutic paradigm for lower -
risk prostate cancer: medical management, without radical intervention, in a chronic 
disease state.  
CALGB [ZIP_CODE] 
Version Date 09/26/18 Update #[ADDRESS_1202434] documented fear of recurrence to be highly prevalent in a number of different cancer patient populations (47- 50). Cancer surviv ors may experience lingering psychological 
sequelae, including fear of diagnostic tests and fear of recurrence for long periods of time 
after diagnosis and treatment (53).  
Prostate cancer patients are not immune to worry over their disease (5, 44 -46, 52, 5 3). 
However, treatment may also diminish fear of recurrence. Among prostate cancer patients 
undergoing definitive treatment, fear of recurrence peaked prior to treatment, then decreased within 6 months after treatment (52). A possible explanation for this finding is that patients were reassured about their prognosis after having undergone treatment. Providing prostate cancer patients the opportunity to exert control over a change in their 
dietary intake, a diet- based intervention may perhaps help patients o vercome fear of 
recurrence, particularly if the intervention stabilizes PSA.  
Part of the impact of a diet change program may involve social cognitive theory, which 
governs most current attempts to change behavior. A key element of social cognitive theory is self -efficacy. According to social cognitive theory, the interaction of the  
individual with the environment is influenced by [CONTACT_862586], expectation of behavioral outcomes, and evaluation and modification of behavior toward specific goals (54). Components of social cognitive theory include sel f-efficacy 
(confidence in ability to perform a particular behavior to accomplish a specific goal), outcome expectancies (belief that a particular behavior will result in a particular consequence), and self -regulation (adopting personal standards for behavi or, appraising 
behavior against such standards, and creating incentives that motivate and guide behavior). Participating in diet change, as in this study, may increase patient feelings of self-efficacy, defined as their “judgments of their capabilities to organize and execute 
courses of action required to attain designated types of performance (55 -57).” According 
to Bandura (56), mastery experiences are the most reliable source of efficacy information. Applied to this study, feelings of greater self -efficacy will increase patients’ ability to 
control their diet and consequently their health. Identifying and reinforcing patients’ present success is a factor that Bandura (54, 56), and Strecher and colleagues (58) 
suggest clinicians use to improve self -efficacy . Building a sense of self -efficacy is part of 
the MEAL program. Self- efficacy has been incorporated into various interventions: self -
management interventions and educational programs in patients with chronic disease 
(61) and prostate cancer (57). Breast a nd colon cancer patients randomized to either an 
educational or nutritional intervention arm had significantly fewer depressive symptoms and better physical functioning than patients in the control group, primarily accounted for by [CONTACT_6270] -efficacy (60). Canc er patients with greater self -efficacy have been found to be 
better adjusted and have a better overall quality of life (55, 57-59).  
We expect that participating in the MEAL intervention will improve the quality of life for low risk prostate cancer patient s. The literature is largely supportive, indicating that this 
intervention’s focus on self -efficacy will add measurably to quality of life (56 -63). One of 
the implicit messages that participants take from being in this study will be that low risk prostate cancer is a condition to monitor, but neither a death sentence nor a condition 
that requires radical, immediate, life -changing intervention. We will not be able to 
compare trial participants to non -participants. We will, however, be able to compare those 
randomized to the diet change to those randomized to the comparison group.  
Low risk prostate cancer is a substantial public health issue that affects tens of thousands of men each year in the US. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_50123], pre -clinical, and preliminary 
clinical studies  suggest that diet is related to prostate cancer risk, so that changing to a 
high-vegetable diet may decrease prostate cancer progression in lower risk patients. 
Clearly, mature clinical data on use of diet to treat prostate cancer are lacking. We have developed a novel, practical, telephone- based intervention that has been shown to 
increase vegetable intake and serum carotenoid levels in men with prostate cancer. We 
propose to document the impact of this dietary intervention in an extended clinical trial 
using prostate cancer patients under AS; for such patients, the likelihood of treatment 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE] 
Version Date 09/26/18 Update #10  
9 efficacy, even after delay, is relatively high. Patient anxiety is a prominent yet 
understudied complaint among AS patients; diet change may decrease prostate -cancer 
related anxiety among these patients. Further study of diagnosis -related anxiety will yield 
potentially important information for improving the psychological care of prostate cancer 
patients. 
1.6 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_862553]: The Women’s Healthy Eating and Living 
(WHEL) Study for Breast Cancer  
A CALGB pi[INVESTIGATOR_862554]’s Healthy Eating and Living study (WHEL), a multi- center 
trial of diet change for breast c ancer (40 -42,64). Utilizing well- established behavior 
change techniques, this intervention achieved substantial changes in vegetable, fiber and 
fruit consumption, along with a substantial change in fat consumption (64).  
The dietary intervention we developed employs telephone -based communication. The 
conceptual framework of the intervention is derived from Social Cognitive Theory (54), 
which emphasizes strengthening of individual self -regulatory skills, including goal-
setting, self -monitoring and evaluative judgments. We utilize lay coaches to help 
participants frame options for decisions. The coaches focus on self -efficacy, or participant 
belief that they can actually succeed in behavior change (64, 65). The lay coaches also provide a supportive environment for regular discussion of triumphs and failures as 
participants seek to change.  The lay coaches are well versed in basic nutrition, and they are supervised by [CONTACT_862587]; nonetheless, they function 
less as authority figures than as facilitators or guides, and as supporters, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_862555] (66).  
The intervention efforts are timed so that they provide the greatest support and guidance 
when the challenges of change, henc e the threats of failure, are greatest: at the beginning 
(65). We have demonstrated that major changes can be implemented during the first 
month of the intervention (40 -42, 65). The subsequent challenge is to integrate change 
into the participant lifestyle , then to reinforce and maintain the change. The counselors 
during this time watch for signs that participant self -efficacy is waning; declining self -
efficacy may be an indicator that failure is increasingly likely (65). We have shown that 
this approach re sults in substantial dietary change that can be maintained for several 
years (67).  
This telephone -based approach has been shown to result in change that can be seen in 
accepted biomarkers of nutritional practice (40- 42). Carotenoids, which are fat -soluble 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_862556], accumulate in blood. The most common of these, alpha carotene, beta -carotene, lutein, lycopene and crytoxanthin, 
reflecting the intake of a wide range of plants, were used as general biomarkers of  plant 
intake (65). The WHEL study intervention, on which our pi[INVESTIGATOR_862557], caused the diets and blood carotenoids of 1500 experimental subjects and 1500 control subjects to diverge substantially within a year of beginning the intervention; after that, we observed, 
over a period of 3 to 4 years, a slight decline in the difference between the dietary practices of experimental and control subjects (66). Nonetheless, experimental subjects in the WHEL study spent the bulk of their study participation time consuming a diet that was radically different than both their pre- enrollment diet and that of comparison 
subjects.  
A nuance of diet change trials is that subjects are not blinded to their assignment; thus, there is always a possibility that subject beh avior will be changed by [CONTACT_862588]. In particular, experimental subjects may be inclined to exaggerate their compliance with diet goals. Subjects cannot, however, readily exaggerate their blood 
carotenoid levels except by [CONTACT_862589]. These are integrated over an extended 
period, and experimental subjects are unlikely to change these other than by [CONTACT_862590].  
While it is certainly true that any methodology involving prospective dietary change poses 
challenges, the W HEL data, and the to -be discussed MEAL data, indicate that we can

Version Date 09/26/18 Update #[ADDRESS_1202435] cancer events among women without hot flashes who had higher vegetable, fruit and fiber and lower fat intakes (70).  These data tentatively 
support the notion that diet change may alter the natural history of breast cancer in 
select groups of patients.  
1.7 The Men’s Eating and Living (MEAL) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_862558], we designed and implemented a pi[INVESTIGATOR_862559]: the Men’s Eating and Living (MEAL) Study (40 -42). This randomized, controlled clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_369737] [ADDRESS_1202436] the patient, to participate in the diet counseling. The study demonstrated that diet change with telephone -based counseling results in increased vegetable intake and increased plasma 
carotenoid concentrations among men with prostate cancer.  
Dietary changes: vegetables  
Consistent with counseling targets, vegetable intakes in the intervention arm increased significantly at six months, while those in the control arm remained static  (Table 1). Diet 
was measured by a series of three 24 -hour recalls collected interactively via telephone 
interview. In the intervention arm, mean daily intakes of total vegetables, crucifers, tomato products and other vegetables increased by 76%, 143%, 292%, and 55%, respectively. The intervention emphasized vegetable, rather than fruit intake, and white potatoes and lettuce did not count. As a result, fruit, lettuce, and potato intake declined for experimental subjects (40 -42). In the control arm, there we re no significant changes in 
mean intakes of total vegetables, crucifers, tomato products, lettuce and potatoes, or 
other vegetables.

Dietary changes: non- vegetables  
Intakes of whole grains and beans in the intervention group increased, while fat intake 
decreased; mean daily intakes of whole grains and beans increased by 28% and 95%, 
respectively, while fat intake decreased by 12% (p<0.05). In the contr ol arm, whole grain 
and fiber intakes decreased by 33% and 21%, respectively (p<0.05), and there were no 
significant changes in fruit, beans, fiber, or fat intakes (data not shown) (40 -42). 
Plasma carotenoid concentrations  
Consistent with increased vegetable consumption, carotenoid concentrations increased in 
the intervention but not in the control group (Table 2). At baseline, plasma total carotenoid concentrations of intervention and control participants were virtually the same. At six months, however, th ose of intervention and control participants, 
respectively, rose by 26% and 3% (p=0.02). In the intervention group, α-carotene, β-
carotene, lutein, and lycopene concentrations increased significantly, while those in the control group remained static (p<0.05). Cryptoxanthin levels changed in neither group. That the changes observed were qualitatively larger than those observed in such prevention interventions as the Polyp Prevention Trial (69) suggests that this test of dietary intervention might be much more sensitive and powerful than either the Polyp 
Prevention Trial or the Women’s Health Initiative (70).  
Although the MEAL study w as not strictly intended for AS patients, the patients on AS 
(53% of the study sample) experienced dietary change and plasma carotenoid results 
identical to those for the entire group (42).These data support the feasibility of implementing a larger clinical trial of a telephone -based diet intervention in men with 
prostate cancer treated with AS.  
Our data, which include blood -based biomarkers, indicate that experimental subjects 
changed their diets, but that comparison subjects did not. Other data, including  the 
Polyp Prevention Trial (71) and the Women’s Healthy Eating and Living study (66), confirm that comparison subjects in diet intervention trials in general do not change their 
diets to nearly the extent that experimental subjects do.

MEAL: Program satisfaction  
The response to the intervention was almost universally positive. In a very preliminary attempt to document the extent to which the participants experienced this program positively, we administered a limited questionnaire to 33 of the participants. We asked 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date 09/26/18 Update #10  
12 them to describe their satisfaction on a 5 -point scale, with 1 indicating strong 
dissatisfaction and 5 strong satisfaction. The responses were extremely positive; 31 of 33  
rated their counselor a 5 for being prompt and convenient with sessions; 30 of 33 rated 
the counselor a 5 for listening; 32 of 33 rated the counselor a 5 for being easy to talk to; 29 of 33 rated the counselor a 5 for knowledge; [ADDRESS_1202437] the counselo r a 5 for being 
helpful; [ADDRESS_1202438] the counselor a 5 for motivating them; and [ADDRESS_1202439] this practical, diet -
based intervention for prostate cancer in a broader clinical setting. Patients on AS will be 
randomized either to an intervention of centralized, telephone- based dietary counseling 
and structured dietary  education or to a comparison control condition in which they

Efforts will be made to enroll individuals of all races and ethnic backgrounds, with the added goal of recruiting relatively high numbers of individuals of Hispanic origin and of African -American origin . The increased risk of prostate cancer and especially of lethal 
prostate cancer among African Americans makes it imperative that we secure adequate 
representation of African Americans in this study.  
CALGB has a long history of effort to ensure adequate r epresentation of minorities in all 
clinical trials, including prevention trials. The recent experience of the Selenium and 
Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) (80) is instructive: 29% of the CALGB participants were African Americans. In our MEAL pil ot study, 12% of participants were 
non-white. Our goal with the full MEAL trial is for 29% of participants to be members of 
racial minorities, especially African Americans.

therapy is safe and appropriate. Physicians should recognize that the following might increase 
the risk to the patient entering this protocol:  
• Patients with medical conditions which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021], would 
make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient should not be enrolled. Such 
conditions may include uncontrolled chronic diseases (including uncontrolled diabetes 
mellitus, cardiac disease, u lcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease); or psychiatric 
illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements and/or 
prevent the patient from giving informed consent.  
• Intolerance of cruciferous vegetables.  
• Unwillingness to adopt  a vegetable- intense diet.  
4.0 ELIGIBILITY  CRITERIA  
4.1 Preregistration Eligibility  
4.1.1 Histologic Documentation: The initial biopsy showing diagnosis of prostate cancer 
should be used for the purposes of determining eligibility. However, if a subsequent  
biopsy performed before patient enrollment shows that the patient is ineligible, he 
may not be enrolled to the study.  Eligible patients must meet all of the following 
criteria:  
• Biopsy -proven (consisting of ≥  10 tissue cores) adenocarcinoma of the prosta te 
diagnosed within 24 months prior to pre -registration .  
• < 25% of biopsy tissue cores positive for cancer.  
• ≤ 50% of any one biopsy tissue core positive for cancer.  
• Clinical stage ≤  T2a. 
• Patients who have prostate cancer with distant metastases are not eligible.  
NOTE: If a patient undergoes a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostate cancer is diagnosed incidentally from the TURP specimen, eligibility for CALGB [ZIP_CODE] cannot be determined from  the 
TURP specimen. However, if the patient subsequently undergoes a minimum 10 -core 
prostate biopsy within 2 years of prostate cancer diagnosis from the TURP, and 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE] 
Version Date 09/26/18 Update #10  
14 prostate cancer is detected in the biopsy specimen and meets the requirements above, 
the patient is eligible for this study. If prostate cancer is not detected in the biopsy 
specimen, the patient is not eligible.  
4.1.2  Prior Treatment: Patients who have had prior treatment for prostate cancer by 
[CONTACT_44850], irradiation, local ablative (i.e. cryosurgery or high -intensity focused 
ultrasound) or androgen deprivation therapy are not eligible.  
4.1.[ADDRESS_1202442] had a history of non -cutaneous malignancy (other than non-
melanoma skin cancer) in the previous 5 years are not eligible.

4.1.6  Patients who are currently taking vitamin supplements including lycopene and beta-
carotene are eligible.  
4.1.7  Patients receiving treatment with 5 -alpha reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride, 
dutasteride) within 90 days prior to preregistration are not eligible. Treatment with 
these agents during the protocol intervention is not permitted. 
4.1.8  Patients who are currently taking coumadin are not eligible.  
4.1.9  Participants will be men aged 50 to 80 years.  
4.1.10  For men ≤  70 years, biopsy Gleason score ≤ 6; for men > 70 years, biopsy Gleason 
score ≤ (3 + 4) = 7.  
4.1.11  Required Initial Laboratory Values:  
• Serum PSA < 10 ng/mL  
NOTE: Baseline PSA for determination of eligibility must be measured after 
discontinuation of any 5 -alpha reductase inhibitors.  
4.2 Registration Eligibility  
4.2.1  Successful completion of three 24 -hour dietary recalls during the run -in period.  
4.2.2  Patients consuming ≥ 6 servings per day of fruits and vegetables (not including 
juices), as determined by [CONTACT_862591]- in dietary recalls are not eligible.  
5.0 REGISTRATION

6.2.2  Plasma samples (required for all patients)  
Throughout all stages of blood processing, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and handling, it is very 
important to prevent prolonged exposure of samples and separated blood components to light. Work quickly and efficiently. When samples and  sample components must be 
set aside, cover them or put them away from light.  
First prepare the vacutainer tubes for protection from light by [CONTACT_6406][INVESTIGATOR_862561] a red or amber colored specimen 
bag. 
Draw 10 mL of whole blood in a green top (heparin coagulant) tube and gently invert 
it once or twice to mix the additive with the blood. Immediately replace the tube into 
the previously prepared aluminum foil slip or place it into the red or amber colored 
specimen bag.  
Samples should be processed within 30 minutes of collection. If this is not possible, 
the tube(s) should be refrigerated until centrifugation. Before centrifugation, make sure the brake is off, the speed is set between 2,800 – 3,000 rpm, the temperature is 
4° to 8° C and the centrifugation time is set at 10 minutes.  

CALGB [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date 09/26/18 Update #10  
21 After centrifuging for 10 minutes, allow the centrifuge to come to a complete stop 
before opening the cover. Do not use the brake as it may cause the red blood cells to become re-suspended in the plasma. Any tube containing red blood cells in the 
plasma should be re- centrifuged. Immediately return the tubes to the light protection 
device (aluminum foil pouch or red or amber bag).  
The plasma should be aliquotted into cryovials* within [ADDRESS_1202456] the samples in the -70° C freezer as soon as possible after aliquotting. 
Samples must be frozen at least 2 hours before packing them for shipment.  If a -70 ° 
C freezer is not available, the cryovials can be stored in a  -20°C freezer immediately 
after aliquotting, and then transferred to a -70°  C freezer as soon as possible, but for 
no longer than 2 days (over the weekend). Placing the samples on wet ice or dry ice does not sufficiently preserve the sample; at least a -20° C freezer is required.  
Samples may NOT be thawed after freezing. See Section 6.2.4 for packing and 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931].  
* Cryovial Choices: Some examples of acceptable 2.0 ml cryovials are: Nalgene (Cat 
#5012- 0020), Fisher (Cat #05-669- 57), Corning (Cat #430488), VWR (Cat

After centrifuging for 10 minutes, allow the cen trifuge to come to a complete stop 
before opening the cover. Do not use the brake as it may cause the red blood cells to become re -suspended in the serum. Any tube containing red blood cells in the serum 
should be re- centrifuged. Immediately return the tubes to the light protection device 
(aluminum foil pouch or red or amber bag).  
The serum should be aliquotted into cryovials* within [ADDRESS_1202458] the samples in the -70° C freezer as soon as possible after aliquotting. 
Samples must be frozen at least 2 hours before packing them for shipment.  If a -70 ° 
C freezer is not available, the cryovials can be stored in a  -20°C freezer immediately 
after aliqu otting, and then transferred to a -70° C freezer as soon as possible, but for 
no longer than 2 days (over the weekend).  Placing the samples on wet ice or dry ice does not sufficiently preserve the sample; at least a -20°C freezer is required.  
Samples may NOT be thawed after freezing. See Section 6.2.4 for packing and 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931].

Version Date 09/26/18 Update #[ADDRESS_1202462] information and QOL assessments: At preregistration participants will 
complete the C -2010, MEAL Participant Contact [CONTACT_130052]. This form is to be 
faxed by [CONTACT_862601] 24 hours of preregistration.  
All patients will be asked to complete the QOL instruments listed in S ection 7.0. 
These forms should be submitted to the Alliance Statistics and Data Center  after the 
run-in period and within 2 weeks of registration.  
8.1.2  Blood sample collection: In addition, all patients will be asked to provide a 6- hour 
fasting blood sample for carotenoid and ch olesterol analysis. This sample should not 
be submitted until within 2 weeks after registration.  
8.1.3  Clinical assessments  
Urologic assessment:  At initial assessment, participants will be evaluated in a 
urology clinic as per typi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l AS protocols and current standard of care (2 -4, 11, 13). 
Urological evaluations will be conducted by [CONTACT_862602]. The baseline visit will include a DRE to confirm clinical stage. DRE will entail palpation of t he posterior and posterolateral aspects of the entire 
prostate in the standard fashion.  
Height and weight  must be obtained during preregistration. Below are recommended 
guidelines to obtain these measurements in an accurate manner.  
Height:  Measure the participant’s height without shoes, using a stadiometer. Ask 
participant to stand up with heels together and weight equally distributed. Ideally, participants heels, buttocks, shoulders, and head should all touch the vertical board; however, in some cases this may not be possible. In this event, take the measurement 
with buttocks and heels touching the vertical board, or with head and buttocks touching the vertical board. Ask the participant to breath in deeply at which juncture the movable headboard should be placed on the head with only enough pressure to 
slightly compress the hair. Record height to the nearest 0.25 inch, rounding down.  
Weight:  Weigh each participant on a medical balance or electronic scale in light 
clothing without shoes. Each participant should be weighed on the same scale 
throughout the study. Place the scale on a level uncarpeted floor surface. Before each weighing, check the scale to confirm that it reads zero in the absence of a load, and if necessary adjust it to read zero. If the participant’s feet are bare, one may place a disposable paper towel on the scale platform. Ask the participant to stand still on the scale platform, arms down at their sides, and feet centered on the platform with 
weight evenly distributed. Record weight to the nearest pound.  
8.2 Run-In 
Eligible patients will be contact[CONTACT_862603] a week to schedule a series of three 24 -hour dietary recalls which will be completed within 3 weeks.  
8.3 Registration/Randomization  
Upon completion of the run- in, UCSD staf f will notify the site and the study Data 
Coordinator about patient eligibility. Eligible patients who successfully completed the 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date 09/26/18 Update #10  
25 run-in and consumed fewer than 6 servings of fruits and vegetables (not including juices) 
per day will then be randomized.  
After randomization, all patients will participate in a 5-10 minute telephone orientation 
conducted by [CONTACT_862604] -related events. The orientatio n call for intervention 
participants randomized to Arm A will briefly explain the counseling program, the dietary targets, and the scientific rationale supporting these targets. The UCSD study staff will mail all participants (Arm A and Arm B) a copy of the Prostate Cancer Foundation  Booklet 
entitled “Nutrition, Exercise and Prostate Cancer.” In addition, participants randomized to the counseling intervention (Arm A) will also be mailed a copy of the study- specific 
“Lifestyle Intervention Manual” which will be referred to during every  counseling call. The 
manual outlines the dietary targets, offers supporting information on strategies to achieve 
these targets, supplies reference tools to help participants accurately estimate servings of 
target foods, and offers recipes and articles abo ut diet and prostate cancer.  
All counseling will be performed by [CONTACT_862605] a counseling program and infrastructure of personnel developed during the WHEL (68) and MEAL (40, 42) studies. The protocol will follow a s tep-wise, phased approach 
employing strategies adopted from social cognitive theory. Motivational interviewing techniques will be utilized to help patients maintain responsibility for their own behavior 
change.  
Each participant in Arm A will be assigned to  a personal counselor/coach; if the 
participant has a spouse or significant other, the counselor/coach will also seek to enlist 
his or her cooperation and support. Counselors will work morning, afternoon, or evening shifts, and every effort will be made to  assign participants to a counselor working when 
they prefer to receive calls. Call length will range from 20 -40 minutes. Calls will be more 
frequent and of longer duration during the early phases of counseling.  
Educational materials  will be sent to patients on a schedule that supports the 
behavioral intervention goals.  
The Lifestyle Intervention Manual  that patients enrolled to Arm A receive will include 
background material on dietary targets, as well as monitoring forms that patients can use 
to monitor th eir dietary change.  
Newsletters: In order to maintain participant morale, UCSD staff will develop eight 
newsletters for participants on both arms of the study. Each newsletter will be four pages 
and will contain information about diet and healthy lifestyle, as well as diet and cancer. Recipes will also be included in these newsletters. The content of the first three pages of 
the newsletters will be nearly identical. The fourth page of the newsletters, which will 
provide recipes to participants, will vary b y group.  
These newsletters will be distributed to participants by [CONTACT_862606]  (quarterly) . Electronic versions of the newsletters will be made available on the 
Alliance  and the CTSU Web sites. Institutions must receive IRB approval of these 
newsletters prior to their distribution to patients. Care should be taken to ensure that 
patients receive the newsletter tailored to the arm to which they are randomized.

PSA Measures (Every 3 Months)  
Serum PSA levels will be measured at baseline and at every 3 months thereafter. PSADT will be calculated as log2 divided by [CONTACT_704479] (the least squares estimator) of log (PSA) observations over time using the last three PSA measurements (44, 83, 100). An example 
of a PSADT calculator can be found at www.ASU RE.ca.  
History & Physical  (Every 6  Months)  
Participants will be evaluated in a urology clinic at initial assessment and every [ADDRESS_1202465] of care (2- 4, 11, 13). Patients 
must be weighed and their height measured according to the instructions in Section 8.1. 
Urological evaluations will be conducted by [CONTACT_862607] (e.g., medical oncologist, PA, NP) at each site. The baseline visit will include a DRE to 
confirm clinical st age. Since PSA and biopsy changes are much more sensitive for 
detecting clinical progression than changes in prostate examination among patients on AS (11), subsequent DRE will be performed at the discretion of the individual urologist. 
These results will not be used to define progression.  
Prostate Biopsy (24 Months)  
Prostate biopsy will be performed by [CONTACT_862608] [ADDRESS_1202466] the right to secure a biopsy earlier than 24 months. Although DRE is commonly used in oncologic practice, it is not highly quantifiable for men with the ve ry

Six-hour fasting b lood samples will be collected at preregistration, 12 and 24 months and 
will be submitted to the Alliance Biorepository at Ohio State University  (see Section 6.2.1) 
and analyzed for carotenoid and cholesterol concentrations.  
Quality of Life Instruments (Every 6 Months)  
Seven quality of life measures will be used: Personal Habits Questionnaire will be 
completed at pre- registration only, t he Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale-
Prostate (FACT -P); Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (Max -PC); International 
Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS); Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite 26 (EPIC -
26); and the Nutrition Self –Efficacy will be completed at preregistration and every 6 
months. Finally, the MEAL Study Counseling Evaluation Form will be completed at 12 
and 24 months (see Section 9.0).  
8.[ADDRESS_1202467] approximately 20 minutes. 
Patient recalls will be performed on three randomly selected days over a three- week 
period and include two weekdays (Monday through Thursday) and one weekend (Friday through Sunday). Data will be catalogued and analyzed utilizing Minnesota Nutrition 
Data System (NDS) software (Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota).  
8.6 Telephone Counseling Intervention (Arm A Only)  
The counseling intervention will be divided into four phases, with the first three phases 
completed in 7 months. The fourth phase will continue for 17 months. Each counseling 
call will take an average of 30 minutes.  
Phase I: The first phase, composed of six counseling calls, will focus on education and 
the rapid development of self -efficacy skills. During this phase, frequent counseling 
sessions (every 3- 4 days) will focus on short -term goals, emphasizing to participants and 
partners that the study dietary pattern can be compatible with their lifestyle. The 
counselor will monitor self -reported dietary intake interactively using dietary analysis 
software (The Food Processor for Windows, Version 7.8, ESHA Research, Salem, OR) to help the participant evaluate his performance and encourage him to concentrate on the positive aspects of his achievements before setting new sub -goals. Throughout this phase 
(and all other phases), counselors will encourag e participants to report any difficulties in 
adopting the dietary pattern, and dietary targets will be adjusted accordingly to maximize 
chances of success.  
Phase 2:  The second phase, composed of four calls over a 2 -month period, will focus on 
practical an d consistent implementation of the dietary pattern. Counselors will help 
participants make structural changes to their food environments, such as altering the 
type of food available in the house, modifying recipes and patterns of food preparation, and focu sing on portion sizes. Participants will learn to monitor their performance 
regularly, as counselors encourage goal setting and review.  
Phase 3:  The third phase, composed of four calls over a [ADDRESS_1202468] in behavior 
maintenance, even as the level of necessary social guidance declines.  
Phase 4:  The counselors will regularly check on progress (8 calls over a 17 -month 
period), providing positive feedback on achievements in maintain ing the study targets 
while monitoring for warning signs of declining interest or self -efficacy. Ensuring 
participants that they can maintain the change they have implemented will still be 
critical. Intervention contacts will take place once every other mo nth by [CONTACT_862609] A

28 Dietary Targets:  Participants in the intervention arm will be encouraged to achieve a 
challenging but attainable dietary pattern: 7 servings per day of vegetables (2 cruciferous, 
2 tomato products, 3 other vegetables), [ADDRESS_1202469] bioactive nutrients and phytochemicals, intervention participants will be instructed to omit fruit jui ce, iceberg lettuce, and white potatoes from 
their calculations of plant vegetable and fruit servings. Counselor/coaches will emphasize colorful vegetables along with strong -flavored produce (cruciferous vegetables, onions, 
garlic), since strong flavor is an indicator (albeit crude) of phytochemical concentration.  
Within the context of these overall dietary targets, participants will be guided to obtain an 
adequate intake of all essential nutrients.  
8.6.[ADDRESS_1202470] 
coaching session. This training will be overseen by [CONTACT_862610]; the team has been involved in a multitude of behavior change studies.  
We have developed a detailed, relational database that provides counselors with a 
computer -assisted coaching protocol for their participant contacts.  All contacts will be 
recorded in the database, and the database will generate the call schedule for each counselor each day. Calls will then follow a script that includes suggested question 
phrasing and responses to key questions inserted into the databas e in real time; 
these standardize intervention delivery. Automatic range checks will ensure quality in 
the dataset. At the completion of each call, the counselor will be prompted for detailed comments that can be used in the next contact. These comments will be reviewed by [CONTACT_862611] a component of performance review. Each counselor’s performance will be compared to that of his or her peers, in terms of achieving dietary change 
toward study goals and in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_862566].  
The database will provide weekly management reports to focus on key aspects of 
study progress, including delinquent data collection. The database will help us monitor regularly scheduled study operations, to comply with aspects of the protocol. For example, study reports will be generated, as needed, to identify intervention participants who have not been contact[CONTACT_862612]. The reports will be provided to the counselors to help keep them on schedule, and to ensure that participants with lagging performance or possibly lagging interest do not drop out of 
the study.  
To maximize effectiveness of the intervention, we will seek participant permission, in 
advance, to monitor calls. We will then monitor 10% of calls. The calls will be audio -
taped and reviewed by [CONTACT_862613]. Throughout the study period, weekly case -
management sessions will be conducted; supervisors, study investigators and 
counselors will use these to resolve challenging issues that have emerged.  
A registered dietitian will supervise the telephone counseling intervention team. 
Counselors will also attend monthly 2 -hour meetings, which will include updates on

On a quarterly basis, counselors will be provided with an assessment of their 
caseload’s adherence to the dietary targets as a means of maintaining or improving performance. Together, these procedures, have contributed to the success of the 
WHEL (68) and MEAL (40 -42) interventions.  
8.7 Completion of Intervention  
All patients are expected to participate in the diet intervention for 24 months.  
8.7.1  Off Treatment Criteria  
Off-Treatment criteria will include the following: 1) physic ian determination that 
continuation of the diet is medically contraindicated, 2) participant decision to 
withdraw from the dietary intervention, or 3) participant death. If a study participant chooses to withdraw from the study, submit the C -[ADDRESS_1202471] in this prevention trial is disease progression defined by (a) PSA doubling time (PSADT) less than 3 years, (b) PSA above 10 at any time, or (c) Gleason score on repeat biopsy ≥ 7 for men younger than 70 years and ≥ 4+3 = [ADDRESS_1202472] active 
surveillance studies to date, the Toronto cohort (12).  
Participants who do not meet PSA or biopsy criteria for progression are strongly 
encouraged to remain on AS while in the study and not undergo treatment with surgery, radiation, local ablation, or androgen deprivation. The se criteria reflect the 
current standard of care (11,12) and are as follows:  
a) PSA doubling time (PSADT) < 3 years  
b) PSA ≥ 10 ng/mL  
If the treating physician suspects that a single measurement of PSA ≥ 10 ng/mL 
represents a spurious rise unrelated to cancer progression (e.g., clinical prostatitis , asymptomatic prostatitis in association with a viral syndrome,  or 
instrumentation of the urinary/gastrointestinal tracts), a repeat PSA may be drawn up to 2 w eeks later. If the repeat PSA value is less than 10 ng/mL, then 
that repeat PSA value shall be recorded for that visit. If the repeat PSA value ≥ 10 
ng/mL, the first PSA value should be recorded for that visit.  
c) Repeat biopsy  
o ≥ 25% of biopsy tissue cores positive for cancer  
o > 50% of any one biopsy tissue core positive for cancer

at the time they begin treatment.  
8.7.3  Continuation of the Dietary Intervention  
Patients should continue intervention and follow -up for the two -year duration of the  
study regardless of progression or electing to receive therapy.  
9.0 OUTCOMES
 ASSESSMENT/QUALITY  OF LIFE  MEASURES  
Seven quality of life measures will be used: Personal Habits Questionnaire, Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale- Prostate (FACT -P); M emorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate 
Cancer (Max -PC); International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS); Expanded Prostate Cancer 
Index Composite 26 (EPIC -26); Nutrition Self –Efficacy and Satisfaction with the MEAL 
Program.  

CALGB [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date 09/26/18 Update #10  
30 9.1 Personal Habits Questionnaire 
The personal habits questionnaire, used in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHEL) study 
(66), consists of 8 sets of questions that address a number of generic health behavior 
questions: cigarette smoking; alcohol consumption; weight change during adult life; adherence to any kind of special diet (e.g. low -calorie, low -fat, low -cholesterol, low salt, 
high-fiber); recreational physical activity, including mild, moderate and strenuous 
activity; and physical activity at various ages. These questions, which will be us ed mainly 
to make sure randomization produced comparable groups, are as appropriate for men as 
for women.  
9.2 Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale -Prostate [FACT- P] 
The FACT- P [version 4.0], developed by [CONTACT_253106] (44, 51) is a prostate  cancer 
specific quality of life questionnaire which includes a 27 item 'core' quality of life measure 
[FACT -G] grouped into four subscales: physical well -being, social/family well- being, 
emotional well -being, and functional well- being. There are an additional [ADDRESS_1202474] -P subscale items are rated on a 5 item Likert scale, from 0, 'not at all' to 4, 'very 
much'. The FACT -G has been tested on 630 patients w ith mixed cancer diagnoses. The 
internal consistency of the subscales ranges from .65 -.82, with excellent internal 
consistency of the total score: an alpha coefficient of .89. Test -retest reliability is excellent 
within a [ADDRESS_1202475] correlating significantly with other quality of life measures (FLIC, r=.79), and related constructs of psychological distress (e.g. Brief POMS, r=-.68) and the ECOG performance ra ting (r= -.52). The FACT -G has been able to 
distinguish between patients with metastatic and non -metastatic disease. Internal 
consistency of the Prostate- Specific Concerns subscale was of moderate strength (alpha 
coefficients ranging from .65 -.69] when test ed with 130 prostate cancer patients (44). 
Evidence of convergent validity of the Prostate- Specific Concerns subscale was provided 
by [CONTACT_862614] (Inventory to Diagnose Depression, r= -.34, p< .001), and anxiety (S pi[INVESTIGATOR_566034], r= - .33, p< .001). Further, 
significantly greater Prostate -Specific Concerns scores were found for those with more 
advanced disease than those with earlier stage disease. Sensitivity to change over time 
was also demonstrated  by [CONTACT_862615]-being, and Prostate- Specific Concerns subscale scores over a two month period for 
those with worsening Performance Status (44).  
9.3 Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer [MAX -PC] 
The Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer [MAX -PC] is a prostate cancer -specific 
measure to assess patient anxiety due to prostate cancer, PSA tests and fears of 
recurrence (45, 46). It consists of 18 items: [ADDRESS_1202476] of Event Scale, including avoidant and intrusive thoughts about prostate cancer (48); 3 
items specific to PSA tests, and 4 items concerning fear of recurrence. The items are 
grouped into three subscales: Prostate Cancer Anxiety (PCA), PSA Anxiety, and Fear o f 
Recurrence. Fourteen items are rated on a four point Likert scale ranging from 'not at all' 
to 'often' and 4 items are rated on a Likert scale ranging from 'strongly agree' to 'strongly disagree'. Internal consistency for the total score is excellent (al pha coefficient = .89). The 
PCA and Fear of Recurrence also demonstrated strong internal consistency (PCA alpha coefficient = .90; Fear = .85) (45). Test -retest reliability is excellent for the total score and 
three subscales (.74 - .89).  The three factor  model was confirmed in a second study of 
the MAX -PC (46). Total scores correlated significantly with other measures of distress, 
including the HADS (r=.52, p< .0001) and the Distress Thermometer (r =.45, p< .0001). Significant correlations were also found  between changes in the MAX -PC score with 
changes in the HADS total score (r=.30, p< .0001). Further, there was a significant difference among four PSA change groups (i.e. steady, rising, falling and unstable) for the 
MAX-PC (p = .003), PCA (p = .045), and the Fear of Recurrence subscale (p= .0001).

the counseling intervention. Moreover, it is likely that the distribution of printed dietary guidelines and intermittent phone calls to monitor diet intake, would potentially diminish anxiety in the control group because it involves more attention than active surveillance 
patients normally receive as part of clinical care (72).  
9.4 International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)  
This is an [ADDRESS_1202478] symptoms. It includes questions encompassing incomplete bladder emptying, 
frequent urination, urgency, nocturia, intermittency, weak stream, straining, and quality 
of life related to urinary symptoms (73).  
There are robust data to suggest that prostate cancer patients on active surveillance 
experience significantly decreased urinary health relative to men without prostate cancer. In a cohort analysis of 6,000 community dwelling older men, we observed that compared to men without prostate cancer, men with prostate cancer on active surveillance (i.e. those who had not undergone treatment) reported a significantly diminished quality of life due to urinary symptoms (74). In addition, several published studies have noted that high vegetable diets and higher serum carotenoid concentration are associated with decreased 
urinary symptoms (75 -77). 
9.5 Expanded Prostate Cancer Composite Index 26 (EPIC -26) 
This instrument is an  abbreviated version of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Composite 
Index (EPIC). It contains [ADDRESS_1202479] health -related quality of life 
domains relevant to prostate cancer: urinary incontinence, urinary irritation/obstruction, 
bowel, sexual and vitality/hormonal. Each domain has function and other subdomains. All of the domains for EPIC -[ADDRESS_1202480]

32 9.6 Nutrition Self -Efficacy Scale 
The Nutrition Self -Efficacy scale assesses the degree to which individuals are confident 
that that they can control their  nutrition (79). The scale assesses perceived self -efficacy, 
the confidence in one’s ability to meet one’s goals, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_52497] -efficacy, defined as 
optimistic beliefs about one’s capability to deal with barriers that arise in plans. The scale 
consists o f 5 items rated on a 5 point Likert scale, ranging from ‘very confident’ to ‘not 
confident at all’. Internal consistency was excellent (alpha coefficient = .87, n= 1,722).  Evidence of validity was provided by [CONTACT_862616] (r =.34, p< .01) (80). Because quality of life or anxiety has not been formally evaluated in an AS population or in the setting of a randomized clinical trial among AS patients, a battery of scores will be assessed as e xploratory variables, with 
scores at each time point and changes in scores over time assessed between the intervention and control groups using student’s t -test and linear regression modeling.  
9.7 Satisfaction with the MEAL Program  
At 12 and 24 months, tho se in the MEAL arm of the study will be asked to complete a 
series of questions about their satisfaction with the MEAL program  (C-2008, CALGB 
[ZIP_CODE] MEAL Study Counseling Evaluation Form) . All but one question has been used in 
WHEL, (Women’s Healthy Eating and Living, the prior diet study on which this study is based). The MEAL Satisfaction Questionnaire, developed by [CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_862568], includes 26 items with all items rated on Likert scales, with response categories varying by [CONTACT_862617]. The following areas of satisfaction are assessed: satisfaction with 
the nutritional plan, counseling calls, the counselor, the time and frequency of the calls, 
expectations that the diet will help to prevent recurrence and improve their overall health, barriers in attaining the dietary goals, and the difficulty encountered in changing and maintaining their diet. Internal consistency meets acceptable standards for the satisfaction with their food intake for the different types of food (5 questions, alpha coeffic ient = .71), satisfaction with the counselor (9 items, alpha coefficient = .87), and 
near an acceptable standard for the [ADDRESS_1202481] been (alpha coefficient = .69).

associated with decreased prostate cancer risk. An analysis of the Health Professionals Cohort observed a 21% lower prostate cancer incidence among those with the highest compared to the lowest lycopene intakes. Moreover, tho se with the 
highest frequencies of tomato and tomato- based product intake had up to a 35% 
risk reduction compared to those with the lowest intake (20). In a meta -analysis of 
[ADDRESS_1202483] intake (fifth quintile of intake) of raw tomatoes [Relative Risk (RR) 0.89, 95% 
CI 0.8 to 1.0] or cooked tomatoes (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.92) had a modest reduction in prostate cancer risk (10). These investigators also noted that while lycopene consumption was not associated with prostate cancer risk (RR 0.99, 95% 
CI 0.93- 1.06), higher serum lycopene concentrations were associated with decreased 
risk (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75- 0.97) (81).  
Interest in the potential therapeutic benefits of lycopene and/ or tomatoes has led to 
a small number of clinical trials that have produced promising, yet preliminary, results. Stacewicz -Sapuntzakis and Bowen placed 32 patients with prostate cancer 
on tomato paste -rich diet, 3 weeks before their scheduled prostatectomy . The 
patients consumed 26.8 mg of lycopene per day, compared with their usual mean intake of 5 mg/day. These investigators noted significant reductions in serum PSA concentrations and increases in apoptotic index in the intervention group compared with th e controls (82). Similarly, Kucuk and colleagues randomized [ADDRESS_1202484] smaller tumors, less 
involvement of surgical margins, and less diffuse involvement of the prostate by [CONTACT_5019]-grade prostatic intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] (83). Chen and colleagues observed in 
a radical prostatectomy model that men who consumed large amounts of tomato products prior to surgery had less oxidative damage in the prostate (30), while Barber and colleagues noted decreased PSA velocities in men with prostate cancer 
treated with lycopene supplementation (25).  
While these data are compelling, associations of carotenoids with prostate cancer 
remain unclear. In the MEAL pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], there was no significant association of 
plasma lycopene or other carotenoids with plasma PSA over a 6- month period for AS 
patients or patients with PSA -only recurrence following surgery or radiation (40 -42).

Carotenoids: The blood nutrient analysis will take place at UCSD under the 
direction of  The carotenoid analysis will be done at UCSD. Plasma 
carotenoids will be separated and quantified using the HPLC methodology that we 
have used previously (40, 67, 68), with modifications to reduce oxidative loss and improve recovery of compounds during analysis. Standard reference materials from the manufacturer will be used to validate analytical precision of these procedures. At UCSD, samples will be stored at all times at - 70º C or lower temperatures in freezers 
equipped with temperature alarms in the Moores UCSD Cancer Center that are 
under the direct supervision of .  
Cholesterol  is analyzed using the KODAK EKTACHEM DT SLIDE. The slide is a 
multilayered film in a plastic support. It contains all the reagents necessary to 
determine cholesterol level in serum or plasma. A 10 uL drop of specimen is deposited on the slide. The sample spreads evenly and diffuses into the reagent layers.  Cholesterol in the sample undergoes a series of reactions in the slide to 
produce a colored compound. The intensity of the color ids proportional to the amount of cholesterol in the sample and is measur ed by [CONTACT_862618]60 analyzer.  
Principles of the procedure: The spreading layer distributes the sample evenly on the slide and causes the cholesterol to dissociate from lipoprotein carriers. Cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed to free cholesterol which then undergoes a series of reactions beginning with oxidation by [CONTACT_862619], cholesterol oxidase. In the final reaction, a colored dye is produced. By [CONTACT_862620] a fixed incubation period,  the DT60 Analyzer can calculate the 
amount of cholesterol present in the sample.  
10.2 Serum carotenoid analyses (Substudy 151105)  
Carotenoid analysis can be evaluated on plasma or serum. Therefore, in addition to the plasma sample, we will be collecting a nd banking serum for evaluation of carotenoids, if 
needed, as well as for the evaluation of other circulating markers of interest.

10.3.[ADDRESS_1202485] been identified which are linke d to increase risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_862569] (84 -89). There is increasing evidence that genetic 
factors could not only predispose men to prostate cancer in general but specifically for aggressive disease. For example CASP8 and MDM2 contain variants associated with risk of aggressive prostate carcinoma
 (90, 91) . Cheng et al (92) and Beebe -
Dimmer et al (93) demonstrated that at least some 8q24 variants are associated with 
risk of advanced disease. Duggan et al identified rs1571801, located in the  DAB2IP 
gene, as a candidate which was associated with aggressive PCa in both European-Americans (p=0.004) and African -Americans (p=0.02) (94). Mononen et al found that 
5’ untranslated variant in CYP17A1 was associated with an increased risk of high 
grade PCa
 (95).  
Identification of a population of patients at risk for aggressive disease is only useful 
if the disease can be prevented or treated effectively. Dietary manipulation holds promise as a way of preventing or ameliorating the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_862570]. There is a growing body of evidence that dietary factors may modify 
genetic risk. Several genes, such as MnSOD, XRCC1, and GST , may modify the 
association of specific nutrients and foods with prostate cancer risk and groups have called for further research to confirm these initial observations (96). For example, 
evidence from the Physicians Health Study suggests that manganese superoxide 
dismutase ( MnSOD ) polymorphism V16A may interact with selenium levels to modify 
risk of clinically aggressive PCa
 (97). MnSOD  genotype were not associated with 
increased risk of disease. However, when they stratified the cases by [CONTACT_862621] [ZIP_CODE]

and environment could have potential clinical application.  
The MEAL study offers the ideal population to study the interaction between genetic 
risk and diet.  First and foremost, if genetic risk is associated with aggressive disease, 
then patients with the high risk genetic background should be more likely to progress. What is unique about the MEAL study is to determine if dietary 
modification alters that genetic risk. If it does then genetically high risk patients 
could modify their diet at the time of diagnosis or possibly sooner. Alternatively, if diet does not modify risk of progression then more aggressive management could be 
instituted.

10.4 Analysis of diagnostic prostate biopsy sections (Substudy 1511 05) 
10.4.1  Background  
A great deal of information is contained in the prostate tissue in the diagnostic 
biopsy: the Gleason score, which indicates the aggressiveness of the cancer, and the size and location of t he cancer. Higher Gleason score and  larger tumor are associated 
with disease progression. The biopsy tissue can be used to describe the rates at which prostate cells are proliferating and at which prostate cells are undergoing apoptosis. 
Together, these factors provide an indicator of overa ll tumor growth index, which is 
associated with disease progression. The biopsy also can be used to describe the degree to which androgen- signaling proteins, including the androgen receptor, and 
androgen metabolism enzymes, including [ADDRESS_1202488] been linked to prostate cancer risk and 
to treatment outcome, with androgen signaling generally associated with the presence or development of more aggressive disease ( 108-110). Recent advances make possible 
the detection of small noncoding segments of RNA, known as microRNA, which can be extracted from serum and from tissue fragments. MicroRNAs [ADDRESS_1202489] received a great deal of attention as likely predictors of prostate cancer treatment outcome, will be examined in this study ( 111, 112) . These two microRNAs 
have been associated with more aggressive disease and with tumor progression.  
Taking these key indicators into account in analyses may enable better description of the likelihood that the prostate will respond to dietary change. Although randomized assignment should greatly lessen the likelihood of confounding of outcome by [CONTACT_862622] [ZIP_CODE]

Institutions will be asked to provide 10 x 5 um unstained sections that show cancer 
on charged glass slides from the formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded, diagnostic 
prostate biopsy blocks to the Alliance Biorepository at The Ohio State University (see Section 6.2). Only one core should be placed on each slide. Label the slides with CALGB [ZIP_CODE] patient ID number, accession  number, and order of sections.  
The immunohistochemistry will be pe rformed at  Roswell Park Cancer I nstitute, under

microRNAs will be extracted from the serum collected as part of sub -study CALGB 
151105 (see Section  6.2.3). microRNA 141 and 375 expression will be assayed by

study will participate in this correlative study. With n= 334 (=418x0.8) patients, a Cox regression model to regress PFS on a continuous biomarker will have 95% of power to 
detect a log -hazard ratio (or, regression coefficient of the Cox proportional hazards 
model) of 0.[ADDRESS_1202490] with a two -sided alpha level of 5%. This power calculation is based on 
85% of 2 -year PFS for the whole population, the accrua l and follow -up periods 
assumed for the main study and the assumption that each marker is normally 
distributed (possibly after a transformation).

11.0 STATISTI CAL  CONSIDERATIONS   
11.1 Randomization  
Patients will be randomized with equal probability to receive the dietary intervention 
(experimental arm) or dietary information (control arm). A total of 464 patients will be enrolled to this trial, 232 patients per arm. The study will take a total of 5 years: about 3 
years of accrual with an expected accrual rate of 15 patients per month, and 2 years of 
follow -up for each patient.  
Stratification factors: Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (≤  70 years  vs. > 70 years ), 
race (African American vs. Other) and baseline prostate biopsy (0 -12 months prior to 
registration vs. >12 -24 months prior to registration).  
11.[ADDRESS_1202493] in this prevention trial is disease progression defined by (a) PSA doubling time (PSADT) < 3 years, (b) PSA ≥ 10 at any time, or (c) Gleason sum on 
repeat b iopsy ≥ 7 for men younger than 70 years and ≥ 4+3 = [ADDRESS_1202494] active surveillance studies to date, the Toronto cohort (12). Data from this cohort indicate that approximately 20% of patients on active surveillance will progress by [CONTACT_91980]: 14% by [CONTACT_862626] 8%-10% 
by [CONTACT_333777].  
Thus, using the log -rank test with a two -sided α = 5%, a sample size of 418 will provide 
80% power to detect a difference in progression rate (P GR) of 20% in the control and 10% 
in the experimental arm during 24 months of follow -up. Under the exponential 
distributions for the time to progression, the 2- year PGR of 20% vs. 10% corresponds to a 
hazard ratio (HR) of 2.118. Assuming 10% of dropout rate (including patients who are treated before progression), a total of [ADDRESS_1202495] 50 
patients. From an analysis of grading by [CONTACT_862627].  Johns Hopkins pathologists, 
Gleason grading of adenocarcinoma in prostate needle biopsy tissue (106), Gleason score was changed from 3+4 by [CONTACT_862628] 4+3 by [CONTACT_862629] 14% of men and from 6 or below to 7 or above for about 8%  of men. Assuming about 30% 
of men in this study will be >70 years old and these two types of changes occur uniformly 
over the whole range of age, we believe that no more than 10% of men will become 
ineligible for the study by [CONTACT_862630]. We will consider increasing 
the sample size by a maximum of 10% depending on the proportion of men who become 
ineligible by [CONTACT_51723].  
11.3 Analysis  
The proportion of men who become ineligible by [CONTACT_862631]. The primary analysis will be done using data from eligible subjects, 
especially using Gleason scores from central review. However, all statistical analyses will be conducted for the data sets from eligible patients only, as well as all pat ients 
randomized in the sensitivity analysis.  
Progression:  PSADT will be calculated as log2 divided by [CONTACT_704479] (the least squares 
estimator) of log (PSA) observations over time using all available PSA measurements, starting from the time point at which we have three PSA measurements (i.e. the first 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE]  
Version Date 09/26/18 Update #10  
39 PSADT of a patient is calculated at month 6 using the PSA measurements collected at 
months 0, 3 and 6 if there are no missing PSA measurements .” In order to avoid any 
miscalculation, the PSADT will be calculate d at the Alliance Statistics and Data Center,  
not by [CONTACT_194674].  
Time to progression data will be analyzed using the log- rank test for univariable analysis 
and the Cox’s proportional hazards regression for multivariable analysis adjusting for th e 
stratification factors and other prognostic factors. For the patients who proceed to treatment with surgery, radiation, local ablative therapy or hormonal therapy before progression within the 2 -year follow -up period, the progression time will be censored at 
the time of withdrawal for treatment.  
A recent study in a similar cohort of men undergoing active surveillance (102) reported that PSA kinetics was not closely associated with progression on subsequent surveillance biopsies. In order to address this issue, as a secondary analysis, we will also compare time to progression defined only by [CONTACT_862632] ≥ 7 for men younger than 70 years and ≥ 4+3 = [ADDRESS_1202496] enough 
power. For example, if the 2 -year PGR for the control arm is only 10% by [CONTACT_862633], then the log -rank test will have only 50% of power with 418 eligible patients 
with events or full 2 year s of follow -up. 
Time to Treatment:  Probability to proceed to treatment within 2 years (binary 
observation) and time to treatment (censored time to an event observation) will be 
analyzed using the chi -squared test and the log -rank test, respectively. We exp ect that 
the control arm will have more patients receiving treatment and shorter time to treatment 
than the experimental arm because of anxiety.  
QOL:  Quality of life (anxiety and depression, prostate cancer symptom checklist) will be 
compared between the two arms. The time trajectory of QOL will be estimated using the 
generalized estimating equation method based on working independent correlation 
structure (103) and the slope of the time trajectory will be compared between the two arms (104). We will consider taking a log- transformation of QOL observations if it 
improves the linearity of the time trajectory of QOL. The significance of the two arm comparisons will be adjusted for multiple testing among different QOL subscales using 
the methodology of Bang, Ju ng and George (105).  
Dietary Recall: Diets will be evaluated at baseline and at 12 and 24 months by a series 
of three separate 24- hour dietary recalls collected interactively via telephone interview. 
The increase (from baseline) in mean daily intakes of total vegetables, crucifers, tomato 
products, beans/legumes and fat will be compared between arms using a two -sample t-
test at 12 and 24 months. We may consider transforming (e.g. using logarithm) the data to improve normality of the distributions and variance stabilization. Data will be catalogued and analyzed utilizing Minnesota Nutrition Data System (NDS) software 
(Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota).  
Plasma carotenoid analyses:  
(1)  Plasma carotenoid concentrations (PCC) will be compared between the two arms 
using a two -sample t- test. A log -transformation of the PCC observations may be 
considered in order to improve the normality of the distributions and variance 
stabilization.  
 (2) PCC will be correlated with PSADT for the patients. Descriptive analysis using scatter 
plots and regression analysis will be conducted. Intervention and known predictors 
including the stratification factors will be adjusted in multivariable analysis.  
(3) Time to pathological progression (i.e., Gleason sum on repeat biopsy ≥ 7 for men 
younger  than 70 years and ≥ 4+3 = 7 for men 70 years or older ) will be regressed on 
PCC in AS patients using Cox ’s regression method . Intervention and  known 
predictors including the stratification factors will be adjusted in multivariable analysis.

11.4.1  Primary Endpoint  
At each interim analysis, superiority and futility tests on PFS will be conducted as 
follows.  
Superiority:  A superiority test is to test if the experimental arm has a longer PFS 
than the control arm. The first interim analys is for superiority will be conducted when 
[ADDRESS_1202497] (DSMB). The final analysis will be conducted 2 years after the completion of accrual. With the expected study plan, there should be about 4 or  5 interim analyses 
before the final analysis. The superiority testing during the interim analyses will be using one -sided alpha=0.0025. (A one -sided p -value smaller than 0.[ADDRESS_1202498] 
statistic larger than 0 imply the superiority of the experimental arm. ) The final 
analysis will be using one -sided alpha=0.025. Due to the relatively small number of 
interim analyses and the small alpha spending at each interim analysis, the overall type I error rate will not be much larger than the nominal one -sided alpha=0 .025

Futility:  Futility testing will be conducted at the time of each interim analysis

analysis will be conducted when 400 patients are enrolled on the study to check i f the 
specified 20% of 2 -year PGR is accurate or not. At the interim analysis, the 2 -year 
PGR of the control arm will be estimated. If the estimate is smaller than 20%, we will 
recalculate the sample size using the estimated 2 -year PGR for the control arm,  
HR=0.472, two sided alpha=0.05 and a power of 80% and consider increasing the sample size by a maximum of 20% of the current sample size. For example, if the estimated 2 -year PGR for the control arm is 18%, then we need 466 eligible patients 
(about 11% in crease from 418 eligible patients). In case the observed progression rate 
is so low that a maximum of 20% increase in sample size does not guarantee a reasonable power for the primary endpoint, we will consider suspending the study for revision.  
11.4.3  Accrual Monitoring  
The accrual rate will be monitored by [CONTACT_862634]’s Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_862573].  
11.5 Statistical analyses for substudy 151105  
For Objective [IP_ADDRESS], the expression level of Mn SOD, XRCC1 and GST  will be correlated

The Men’s Eating and Living (MEAL) Study: A Randomized Trial of 
Diet to Alter Disease Progression in Prostate Cancer Patients on 
Active Surveillance 
 
This is a clinical trial, a type of research study. Your study doctor will explain the clinical trial to 
you. Clinical trials include only patients who choose to take part. Please take your time to make your 
decision. Discuss it with your friends and family. You can also discuss it with your health care team. 
If you have any questions, you can ask your study doctor for more explanation. 
[Attach NCI booklet “Taking Part in Clinical Trials: What Cancer Patients Need to Know”] You are being asked to take part in this study because you have been diagnosed with prostate cancer 
and are receiving regular follow-up care with your primary physician. 
 
Why is this study being done?  
You are being asked to take part in a research study of men who are undergoing active surveillance 
for their prostate cancer. The purpose of the study is to find out more about how diet may prevent prostate cancer from getting worse. 
 
How many people will take part in this study?  
About 464 men will participate in this study.  
 
What will happen if I take part in this research study?  
Before you begin the study . . .  
You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the study. 
These exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may be done even if you do not 
join the study. If you have had some of them recently, they may not need to be repeated. This will be up to your study doctor. 
• A complete history and physical exam including a digital rectal exam  
• A PSA test  
 After you are enrolled in the study, you will be asked to provide about [ADDRESS_1202513] year, your quality of life, function and anxiety.

49 Run-in: During a two-week period after enrollment (called “Run-in”), study researchers from the 
University of [LOCATION_004] at San Diego (UCSD) will call you on three different days over the 
telephone and ask you questions about your medical history and diet. During  these interviews, called 
“24-hour dietary recalls,” you will be asked to recall everything you ate and drank during the 
previous 24 hours. You may skip any question that makes you uncomfortable. These telephone interviews will take approximately 20 minute s. 
During the study . . .  
If you are able to complete the three 24-hour dietary recall interviews and you choose to participate in the study, you will be "randomized" into one of the study groups described below. Randomization means that you are put into a  group by [CONTACT_3364]. A computer program will place you in one of the 
study groups. Neither you nor your doctor can choose the group you will be in. You will have an equal chance of being placed in either group. 
Group 1 
If you are in Group 1 (often called "Arm  A") you will be assigned to a program providing you with 
telephone counseling to help change your diet. You will be asked to change your diet to increase the 
amounts of fiber-rich plant foods (vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and beans) that you eat. You will 
receive assistance from diet counselors  at UCSD to help you achieve the dietary goals. These 
counseling calls will take an average of [ADDRESS_1202514] two 
weeks, and gradually decrease in frequency (weekly, bi -monthly, monthly). The counseling calls 
may be monitored and audio-taped for quality assurance purposes. After the first six months, your 
telephone counselor will call you periodically throughout the remainder of the study to check on how you are maintaining the study diet. You will receive a total of 22 calls over the 24-month period. A 
diet intervention manual, a booklet, and regularly scheduled newsletters will also be provided to you. 
Group 2 
If you are in Group 2 (often called "Arm B") you will be assigned to a program providing you with information about diet and cancer. You will receive an initial orientation telephone call that will take about 5 to 10 minutes as well as a booklet containing information about nutrition, exercise and prostate cancer. Regularly scheduled newsletters will also be provided to you. 
Tests and Procedures  
Participants in groups 1 and 2 will complete the tests and procedures listed below. They are part of regular cancer care. 
• A PSA test every 3 months 
• A complete h istory and physical exam every 6  months 
• A digital rectal examination every 12 months at the urologists discretion

51 Can I stop being in the study?  
Yes. You can decide to stop at any time. Tell the study doctor or nurse if you are thinking about 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_59917].  
It is important to tell your study doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_862576]. 
The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in 
your best interest; if you do not follow the study rules; or if the study is stopped. 
 
What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study?  
You may have side effects while on the study. Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully for any side effects. However, doctors don't know all the side effects that may happen. You 
should talk to your study doctor about any side effects that you have while taking part in the study. 
Possible risks from changing your diet  
• Your skin, especially on the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet, may become yellow because of a diet high in carotenoids. 
• You may become bloated or have a lot of gas for a short period because you may be eating more vegetables and dietary fiber than usual. You may get diarrhea or become constipated at first, but only until your body can adjust to your new diet. 
Other risks  
• There may be a small risk in the process of drawing blood. You may faint or become dizzy. 
You may feel a little pain or discomfort as the needle goes through the skin. Some bleeding or bruising may occur at the site where blood is drawn. Pressing hard on the spot for 1 or 2 
minutes after the needle is removed will help to prevent this. Very rarely, your arm may swell 
or become infected.  
 
Are there benefits to taking part in the study?  
There will be no direct benefits to you other than those associated with changing your diet. The investigators may learn more about how diet plays a role in changing the way prostate cancer can 
spread in the body. This information could help future prostate cancer patients. 
It is important to remember that while there may be benefits , you should continue to be followed by

RELATED STUDIES 
Please note: The following section of the informed consent form is about additional research 
studies that are being done with people who are taking part in the main study. You may take 
part in these additional studies if you want to. You can still be a part of the main study even if you say “no” to taking part in any of these additional studies.  
The results of these research studies will not be provided to you or your doctor, nor will the results have any effect on your treatment. It is unlikely that what we learn from these studies will have a 
direct benefit to you. However, the information learned from these studies may benefit other patients 
in the future. 
The results from these studies may be published, but individual patients will not be identified in these 
publications. 
There will be no charge to you for participating in these research studies. Your sample and 
information will only be used for research and will not be sold. The research done with your sample 
may help to develop new products in the future. 
The greatest risk to you is the release of information from your health records. We will do our best to 
make sure that your personal information will be kept private. The chance that this information will be given to someone inappropriate is very small. 
In the future, people who do research may need to know more about your health. While the Alliance 
for Clinical Trials in Oncology  may give them reports about your health, it will not give them your 
name, address, phone number, or any other information that will let the researchers know who you 
are.  
If you decide now to participate and then change your mind at any time about participating in these 
studies for any reason, you should contact [CONTACT_862639]. The sample will then no longer be used for resea rch. It will either 
be destroyed or returned to your institution for storage. The sample will also be returned to your institution upon request if needed for any other medical or legal reasons. 
You can say “yes” or “no” to the following study. No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect 
your care.

55 Studies on blood and tissue  (includes genetic studies):  
Blood: Study researchers would like to collect additional samples of your blood. The researchers 
would like to conduct other studies on carotenoid and cholesterol levels in your blood. Also, they 
would like to investigate whether substances in your blood (sometimes called tumor markers) are related to the way that your body responds or doesn't respond to changes in your diet.  
In addition to the studies on carotenoid and cholesterol levels, researchers wish to determine whether there is a relationship between genes and the severity of your disease. In order to study genes, the 
DNA must be removed from your blood sample. DNA is the substance that makes up your genes. 
Genes are the units of inheritance that are passed down from generation to generation. They are responsible for eye color, hair color, blood type, and hundreds of other traits. 
If you agree to these additional studies, about 4 teaspoons of additional blood would be collected at the beginning of the study and then about 2 teaspoons of blood would be colle cted 12 and 24 months 
after you start the study. 
Tissue: A section of the material from the prostate biopsy that was used to diagnose your prostate 
cancer was reviewed by [CONTACT_862640]. Study researchers would also li ke to test additional sections of this tissue from this prostate biopsy to look at tissue 
tumor markers. Investigators want to look at how the tumor is growing, if some hormones were 
present, and to examine genetic activity in your biopsy tissue. No extra prostate biopsies would be 
needed for these extra tissue studies. Tissue would be used from your prostate biopsies already done as part of the main study. 
About genetic studies:  
New scientific tools will now allow researchers to look at your whole DNA, not just one part or one gene. This kind of research can provide information to researchers about the development of cancer 
and response to treatment. It can also provide information about a variety of other conditions and 
diseases, including heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease.  
Because the information gained in these genetic studies can be very useful to the research community, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has requested that these data be placed in a central database housed at the NIH. The goal is to speed up the process for discovery of new 
treatments, prevention and diagnosis of disease. Researchers must get approval from the NIH before 
they can access the r esearch results and health -related information from your specimen. All 
information will be coded with a unique number. Researchers will not have access to your identity; they will only see coded information. 
The greatest risk to you is the release of information from your health records. We will do our best to 
make sure that your personal information will be kept private. The chance that this information will 
be given to someone is very small. Below are some of the steps we have taken to protect your privacy and confidentiality:

56 • Blood and tissue samples will be stored at a n Alliance laboratory. The Alliance Statistics and 
Data Center will perform all analyses of data and store all study results. Your blood and 
tissue samples will not be stored with your name [CONTACT_96179]. Instead, they will be labeled with a 
special Alliance  identification number. The only location where your name [CONTACT_862647] . The 
greatest effort will b e made to see that all personal information that can identify you is kept 
under conditions that protect your privacy. 
• Information about your participation in this study and results of any tests performed on your 
samples will be kept only at the Alliance Statistics and Data  Center. This information will not 
be made available to your doctors or to individual researchers at the Alliance . Test results 
from this study will not be put in your medical records. All study information, including test results, is st ored under conditions that limit access in order to protect the privacy of the 
people participating in the study. 
• The Alliance has received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the federal government, 
which will help us to protect your privacy. More information about the Certificate can be 
found in the paragraph “Will my medical information be kept private?” 
• A federal law (Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act, GINA) will help lower the risk from health insurance or employment discrimination on the basis of genetic information. The 
federal law does not include other types of misuse by [CONTACT_862641], long -term care or 
disability insurance. If you want to learn more about the GINA Law, which went into effect 
in 2009, you can find information about it on the internet or ask the study staff. In addition to 
the federal law, some states have laws that also help protect against genetic discrimination.  
While we believe that the risks to you and your family are very low, we cannot tell you exactly what 
all of the risks are from taking part in genetic research studies. Your privacy and confidentiality will 
be protected to the fullest extent possible.

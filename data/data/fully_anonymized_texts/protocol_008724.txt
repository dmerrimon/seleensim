Study Design  
The study is a group randomized trial with n=28 centers. Philadelphia Parks and Recreation (PPR) and 
Get Healthy Philly (GHP) are partnering to implement the proposed study. All proposed study design and 
materials have been reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_452742].  
Center Eligibility Criteria  
For recreation centers to be eligible to participate in Hydrate Philly they must meet the following 
criteria:  
1. Location in a low -income neighborhood in the City of Philadelphia, defined  by ≥20% of the 
residents in the zip code at or below Federal Poverty Level;  
Updated 8/15/2018  
2. Site includes both summer and after -school programming  
3. Willingness to comply with City of Philadelphia Healthy Vending standards and discourage SSB 
consumption  
4. Water lines appropr iate for installing indoor hydration stations  
5. Willingness to accept randomization  
Center Recruitment : 
Project staff will call potentially eligible recreation center leaders and notify them of the opportunity to 
participate. Project staff will describe the project using an  FAQ and sign a Memorandum of 
Understanding, emphasizing what centers will be requested to do (programming and measures) and 
what support and resources will be provided to them (equipment, measurement tools).  
If more recreation centers are  eligible and interested than slots are available, [ADDRESS_577264] team of any facilities and maintenance concerns before data collection is 
scheduled to begin.  
Informed Consent:  
Prior to the collection of any individual data will be obtained from the [ADDRESS_577265] at the gra nt 
kickoff event in front of center leaders from the enrolled  recreation centers.  
Water Safety Testing  
While there is no reason to believe there are any water safety problems present in the 
recreation centers targeted to receive the water intervention (or  more broadly), all of the partners agree 
that testing the water at the recreation centers for lead, as recommended by [CONTACT_214135], before 
Updated 8/15/[ADDRESS_577266] and beneficial for 
reducing health dispari ties. Due to the size of PPR recreation centers and the required large 2 -inch pi[INVESTIGATOR_27442], 
lead pi[INVESTIGATOR_452735]. PPR has completed water safety testing of all potable water  sources within their recreation 
centers, which showed no lead concerns. For the proposed study, water safety testing for lead will be 
conducted at each proposed source and results will be made available to parents and staff according to 
EPA recommendation s. Following EPA recommended sampling procedures ( 1), all levels will be required 
to be below 10ppb . Lead action levels are consistent with the School District of Philadelphia water 
testing lead action levels and are below the EPA recommended action level of 15ppb for schools and 
child care facilities designated as a public water system  (2). 
Water safety testing occurred after installation of the new hydration station and after at least [ADDRESS_577267] 2 weeks was needed after unit installation to 
allow for “passivation” to occur as recommended by [CONTACT_452743]  (PWD). 
Passivation allows tim e to pass for the new units to have the “new car smell” go away, which can 
sometimes cause slightly elevated levels of some elements that are not harmful but can affect taste. 
PWD  will conduct water safety testing for the pil ot site. The Project Coordinato r will collect samples for 
all intervention sites and send them for testing at the Penn State Agricultural Analytical Services  Lab 
according to the water safety testing protocol ( Appendix A ). 
Procedures  
Three measurement periods, each lasting 2 weeks, will  occur: baseline (July /Aug  2017), mid -
point (March 2018), and post (July /Aug  2018). This timeline allows PPR staff to complete installation of 
hydration stations during the time of year (Sept -Dec) with the greatest staffing flexibility and ensures 
the inte rvention is ready for implementation during PPR’s peak summer season. The study timeline was 
developed to meet requirements of PPR for installation that does not interfere with recreation center 
pools, which requires the same installation team as the propo sed project.  
To minimize staff burden, one staff person per center will be identified to serve as the liaison. 
City employees are prohibited from accepting gifts, inclusive of incentives for participating in additional 
work for a research study. The staff liaison will be allowed to decide what center supplies or equipment 
should be purchased with a $[ADDRESS_577268] at the end of each measurement period to incentivize the 
collection of simple measures. This staff person will respond to text -based surveys each w eekday with 4 
questions (attendance, tally of outside beverages, tally of reusable water bottles, and weight of trash as 
described above) and fill out a [ADDRESS_577269] backups will be recorded ( Appendix B ). A training on how to 
complete measures will be performed and a quick reference guide for data collection was developed 
(Appendix C ). PPR has used this method of requesting their staff to report on PPR pi[INVESTIGATOR_452736].  
Updated 8/15/2018  
Measures  
Center water consumption (primary outcome).  The primary outcome measure will be ea ch 
center’s total gallons of water taken from hydration stations (or existing water fountains in control 
centers) as measured by [CONTACT_452744]. Water flow meters will be 
installed before baseline at all sites for all e xisting operational water fountains, and research staff will 
record water meter readings at the beginning and end of each 2 weeks measurement period. This 
estimate will only include water from hydration stations (in intervention sites) or existing water 
fountains (in control sites) and will not include other non -consumption water use (eg, pools, bathroom 
sinks, etc). However, some non -consumption water use in water fountains will occur (eg, rinsing cups). 
In addition, ounces of water per person will be esti mated by [CONTACT_452745] 2 weeks and dividing by [CONTACT_452746].  
Outside beverages during programs (primary outcome).  Outside beverages for after -school and 
summer programs will be measured by [CONTACT_452747] a SSB from the center’s vending machine. The center liaison will tally the number of children 
who bring in beverages each weekday for 2 weeks. Daily tallies will be summed to create one center -
level es timate of total outside beverages and will be adjusted for attendance.  
Reusable water bottles (secondary outcome/mediator).  The center liaison will record the tally 
of students who brought reusable water bottles to programs following the same approach as outside 
beverages.  
Weight of trash (secondary outcome).  Center policies currently require program staff to 
remove trash dai ly from after -school and summer program rooms after students leave. Daily program 
waste will be measured by [CONTACT_452748] a portable luggage scale before removing each day 
for 2 weeks.  
Staff SSB consumption (secondary outcome/mediator). At the beginning of each 2 -week 
measurement period and prior to beginning student measures, the staff liaison will complete the 
Beverage Intake Questionnaire (BEVQ -15; Appendix D , (3,4). This questionnaire will be used to estimate 
staff SSB and water consumption using ounces of water and total energy intake from beverages.  
Center attendance (secondary outcome).  Attendance will be recorded each weekday by [CONTACT_452749] [ADDRESS_577270] observations of the fountain 
with the flow meter installed (or the new hydration station where th e old fountain with a flow meter 
used to be). Appendices E & F  describe the protocol in detail and the final observation form.  
 Maintenance Tracking . Research staff will complete 3 -5 calls (lasting approximately 5 -10 
minutes) during the study period after  hydration stations were installed to assess any maintenance 
Updated 8/15/2018  
problems (e.g., malfunctioning fountains, vandalism, etc). Surveys will be completed with maintenance 
staff or site leaders. A survey was developed for the current study ( Appendix G ).

 Hydrate Philly Recreation Center Water Testing Protocol  
Background : Hydrate Philly is a Robert Wood Johnson Funded grant project bringing together 
Philadelphia Parks and Recreation and Get Healthy Philly to support access to appealing water 
and discourage sweetened beverages in recreation centers.  In order to address publi c 
perceptions of water quality, which can sometimes be a barrier to drinking Philly’s high quality 
water, PPR and GHP leadership agreed to test water sources for lead contamination as part of 
Hydrate Philly. This protocol outlines the steps of water testin g for lead.  
One Week Prior to Testing  
1. Begin scheduling with center   
2. Review procedures with center :  
a. We are testing before doing a water promotion program to help build trust in 
the water quality.  
b. Testing will o ccur before ANY water has been used at the c enter (no flushed 
toilets, no sinks, no water used since the previous day) . It is important that we 
follow this standard testing practice to ensure that people believe our results  
c. Samples  will have to be sent to a lab , which will take a few weeks  to get results.  
One Day Prior to Testing  
3. Remind staff to confirm scheduled time . 
4. Remind staff that no water can be used prior to testing . 
5. Have staff cover water fountain with plastic bag the night before to prevent use prior to 
testing  (fountain must rema in unused for at least 6 hours prior to testing) . 
Day of Testing  
6. Arrive at testing site  prior to facility opening , if possible , to prevent any water use . 
7. When possible, have leader or other key staff present for testing  
a. Staff presence is required for centers  who expressed  active concerns about  
water  quality  (defined as  responding with  “not very confident ” or “no 
confidence ” from Needs  Assessment question on confidence in water quality ) 
8. Explain process of “revised first draw” sample (clear the water storage tank in order to 
only test water that had been stagnant in pi[INVESTIGATOR_151097])  
a. Have diagram [ADDRESS_577271]  
a. Use gloves to prohibit cross -contamination (relevant fo r any bacteria tests) . 
b. Run fountain to fill a single 1 liter  bottle  (the size of the storage tank inside the 
fountain)  and dump out the water. This allows us to obtain a “revised first draw ” 
sample to by[CONTACT_452750]. It allows us to a ccess the water that has 
been sitting in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_452737] a first draw sample .  
 
 c. Fill the first test bottle, seal and place in cooler   
d. Run fountain over chlorine residual test strip for a bout 10 seconds  
e. Flush the toilets then r un the fountain for 5 minutes  using a timer (to flush water 
from building and bring in fresh  water from street lines ; See Diagram  1) 
f. Fill the second test bottle, seal and place in cooler . 
g. Run fountain over second chlorine residual strip for about [ADDRESS_577272] be mailed 
imm ediately so they are received within 24 hours. Penn State’s 
Agricultural Testing Center does not receive samples on Fridays or 
weekends as there is insufficient time to conduct testing.  
j. Provide expected  timeline  to the center staff  for test results to be completed  (1-
2 weeks)  
After Testing  
Lead a ction levels are consistent with the School District of Philadelphia water testing lead 
action levels and are below the EPA recommended action level of 15ppb for schools and child 
care facilities designated as a pu blic water system. Notification of elevated levels for other tests 
will be determined based on EPA criteria for normal ranges that are reported by [CONTACT_452751].    
   If Results are Less than 10 ppb:  
10. Inform PPR, PDPH, and recreation site leader of results within 48 hours  
   If Results are 10 ppb or greater:  
11. Turn off outlet and tag to prevent turning back on  
12. Notify Cheryl Bettigole, Kathi  Muller, Frank Fabey, and Kathryn Ott Lovell of elevated 
results  within [ADDRESS_577273] staff  
a. Include:  
i. Health: Cheryl Bettigole, Hannah Lawman  
ii. PPR: Kathryn Ott Lovell, Aparna Palantino, Orlando Rendon, Kathi Muller, 
Frank Fabey,  
iii. PWD: Dennis OConnor, Gary Burlingame  
b. Include PDF of all sites’ detailed results and PDFs of all sites’ notification letters

A Quick Guide to Data Collection  
 
Hydrate Philly will text you for data collection at  
3 times  over the next year…  • Summer 2017:   July 24 – August 4  
• Spring 2018:      TBD 
• Summer 2018:   July/August  
 
Every data collection period lasts 10 days . During the period,  we’ll text you at 3:30 PM  every day.  
 
Here’s an example (with made up numbers) of what to expect. Please respond to our texts using 
numbers only. After you respond to the first question, you will receive another text with the second 
question, and so on until you’ve answered all 6 questions:  
 
  
Your responses are NOT monitored as they come in, so if you have questions please contact [CONTACT_452752].  
Common Questions:  
1. When do I weigh trash and check the flow meter?  
• Wait until you receive our text at 3:30 PM every day, so you’re checking the trash and flow meter at the same time 
each day. This can be your normal trash take out routine during the data collection period.  
2. I have more than one trash can. Which trash can do I weigh?  
• Choose the trash can that is most often used for the after school program. The most important thing is to weigh 
the same  trash can for the whole data collection period, even if the kids use a different trash can one day.  
3. What do I do on irregular days, when there are trips or other special events?  
• Keep track of the measures and respond as you normally would. We realize some numbers (for example, weight 
of trash) may be different than usual on these days.

Hydrate Philly Water Fountain Observation Protocol  
 
Overview of Observation Design  
1. All 28 study sites will receive 5 observations (1 each weekday) lasting 30 minutes  each  (see Appendix A for 
schedule) .  
2. Observations  will occur over 2-[ADDRESS_577275] RA 
for inter -rater reliability calculation purposes.   
3. Intervention and control m atched pair sites will be observed at the same time period.   
4. If there are 2 hydration stations or water fountains at the recreation center, observations wi ll occur at the 
location where the flow meter is installed  (see Appendix B for list).  
5. Observations will overlap w ith the post -measurement period (i.e., same time as flow meter readings, 
attendance, and tally of water bottles, reusable bottles, and sugary drinks are being reported by [CONTACT_452753] ). 
6.  
Observation  Protocol  
1. Arrive at least 1 5 minutes before observations are scheduled to begin. It is very important all observations 
start on schedule. Do not begin observing early; begin at the scheduled time -- otherwise it can affect the 
results.  Prior to observations beginning, these pi[INVESTIGATOR_452738]:  
a. # Program Participants on Site  (ask site leader for today’s attendance)  
b. 2 Photos of the fountain  
c. “Before” photo of the flow meter or bottle counter  (immediately before obs. period starts)  
d. # Total Site Visitors (immediately as obs. period starts)  
2. Sit or stand in an area close to the water source. Choose a spot where you can best observe the water flow 
coming from the water source. Do not sit so close as to be an obstruction. If needed, you can walk around a 
little bit to observe the other d rinks that site visitors are consuming.  
3. Complete the observation form. Use one observation form per 30 minute s long  observation. If you are 
paired with another volunteer during your shift, you each should comp lete your own observation form.   
a. Intervention Only : For intervention sites only , complete:  
i. Challenge Game:  Circle Y or N for whether the “Weekly Water Challenge” game poster is 
hanging up somewhere in the center  
ii. Program Bottle Count:  The number of “Hydrate Philly” branded water bottles that were 
seen in possession by  [CONTACT_452754] (not just 
from your observation post) .  
b. Photos: Please take two photos before each observation period – 1) the water source at a distance 
of approximately 10 feet; and 2) water source basin close -up. In the first photo, we would like to see 
if there are any obstructions near the water source. In the second we would like to see if there is 
 
 
Page [ADDRESS_577276] consumption. (If you are p aired with 
another volunteer on your shift, only one of you needs to take and send photos)  
c. Tally of program participants on site: When you arrive, take an initial count of children enrolled in 
the summer program who are onsite during the observation period. Ask the site leader how many 
kids attended the program that day . Do not count other youth at the center if they are not in 
summe r camp (e.g., youth playing basketball on their own) because they will be counted in “other 
site visitors”.   
d. Tally of total site visitors: Just as the observation period starts , take an initial count of all visitors in 
the recreation center  that you can se e from your post. All additional visitors who enter your line of 
sight from your post (within the recreation center ) will also be counted and added to your tally.  Do 
not count visitors that you cannot see from your post (e.g., visitors in other rooms out o f site of the 
hydration station).  Do count visitors that you would be able to see from your post if not for an 
obstruction (e.g. vending machine or people having a conversation that block your line of sight). You 
will likely wind up counting summer program  participants and non -participants in this tally.  
e. Flow meter: Record the number on the flow meter at both the start and end of the observation 
period.  This measurement should occur immediately  before/after observation period.  If the site is a 
control site,  you will need to open the old water fountain cover in order to access the flow meter. Be 
very careful not to move or touch the flow meter if possible. If it’s necessary to move the flow 
meter, move it carefully. Flow meters have been known to break or mal function if handled roughly.  
In addition to recording the flow meter number, take a photo of the flow meter number  (before and 
after observation period).  
f. Time to fill bottle:  Use a stopwatch to time how long it takes  to completely fill 1) your small  cup 
from  the spi[INVESTIGATOR_452739] 2) your 20oz bottle from the bottle filler (intervention sites only).  If two staff 
members are available, t his measurement should be performed with your observation partner such 
that one partner holds the stopwatch and another partner fills the bottle and gives start /stop 
directions to the timer  The measurement should be performed twice with each measurement 
partner swappi[INVESTIGATOR_452740]. The timer will record the measure on their 
observation form (so after the ro les are switched the other person will be able to record their time 
on their own observation form). The measure should be repeated [ADDRESS_577277] water usage (and therefore flow meter reading) during the observation period.  
g. Tally of program participants and other site visitors using water so urces:   
i. Count each time a water source is used as a separate tally. (i.e. if a man approaches a water 
source and drinks directly from the spout and then fills up his water bottle, count him both 
under sips and under bottles.  Or if a girl takes a sip and then return s)  
1. Use a stop watch to time how long  (in seconds) the visitor sips f rom the spi[INVESTIGATOR_28879], or 
how long water flows from the bottle filler into their bottle.  Count only the time in 
which the visitor is actually drinking water or there is water touching his/her lips.  
2. For filled bottles, check ‘R’ if the visitor is using a reusable bottle.  Do not count 
disposable cups or single use bottles.  
 
 
Page [ADDRESS_577278] the 
number of visitors who drank during that measure; e.g. 25.61  sec. (4)  
h. Other Beverages  Observed : Tally a count of other beverages by [CONTACT_452755] n view of 
your observation post. Do not count b everages that are clearly not meant to be consumed (e.g. 
children returning unused milk cartons at the end of lunchtime).  
i. Examples include flavored milks, Capri Sun, Sunny -D, lemonade, Starbucks bottled 
Frappuccino, bottled yogurt drinks (Danimals, Yakult) , fruit punch,  Hugs,  soda and any other 
drink with added sugar. Alcoholic beverages are counted as ‘other sugary drinks’.  
ii. If you don’t know if a drink contains added sugar,  write down the details of the drink from 
the label in your “notes” section, and  look it up on the internet  immediately after your 
observation is complete  (so you don’t forget) . You can start by [CONTACT_452756]: 
https://www.fatsecret.com/ . If there is an opaque bottle or a container with an unknown 
liquid, attempt to ask what’s the person is drinking or, if it is too busy to ask, classify these 
beverages as “unknown”  
iii. Available type categories are:  
1. Water in Reusable Bottle:  Include all water seen in a reusable bottle.  If someone fills  a 
reusable bottle at the fountain, you will tally them here and check the ‘R’ box.  
2. Bottled Water (Single Use) : Include all water in a single use receptacle.   
3. Milk (plain)  
4. Milk (flavored) : strawberry, vanilla, chocolate, etc.  
5. Diet Soda/Diet Tea : count only  diet sodas and teas that are artificially sweetened, not 
sugar sweetened  
6. 100% Juice : count only non -carbonated juice that appears to be 100% juice  
7. Soda : count only sugar -sweetened (not diet/artificially sweetened) sodas. This could 
include fruit flavored sodas (eg, Crush).   
8. Coffee : any type of hot or cold coffee beverage  
9. Other Sugary Beverages : Any other sugary drinks (e.g. lemonade, milkshakes, Sunny -D, 
Capri -Sun, sweetened teas ) 
10. Unknown : count coffee mugs or opaque bottles  
11. Note : We should be able to aggregate these tallies to help us estimate potential 
trashed saved.  
i. Notes:  please describe if anything unusual occurs during your shift that might impact water 
consumption – i.e. a parade, a school field day, a birthday party, construction, rain, a holiday, etc. If 
the fountain is dirty or clogged or broken today, please describ e how (e.g., fountain is clogged with 
sand; trash in the basin). You can use this space to also describe anything else noteworthy (e.g. two 
small children tried to drink from fountain but couldn’t reach; woman washed her hands in fountain; 
children sat/cli mbed on fountain )

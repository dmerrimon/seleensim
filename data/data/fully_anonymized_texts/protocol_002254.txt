I. OBJECTIVES  
Summary.  Through the proposed K99/R00  studies, [CONTACT_201339] will receive direct training in 
communications and tobacco regulatory science, and application of this knowledge to mentored research to 
develop and gain skills necessary to develop anti -tobacco messages that effectively communicate the risks of 
polytobacco use to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender polytobacco users.  Using a conceptual model 
based on the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM)1-[ADDRESS_240035] framework4 we will develop  
and refine anti-tobacco messages targeting young adult polytobacco users ; specifically, lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
and transgender young adults —a polytobacco use disparities population (Aim  1, Phases 1 and 2) .

 Brief Background. Between 21-40% of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) young adults 
(YA)5-8 (vs 12- 21% of non -LGBT YA9,10) report polytobacco use, defined as using more  than  one 
tobacco product  including electronic  nicotine  delivery  systems  (ENDS ). This difference  is alarming as 
polytobacco use is associated with nicotine dependence11 and continued tobacco use12-16 into adulthood, which 
may widen existing tobacco disparities.17 Markedly low tobacco risk perceptions8,18-24 among LGBT YA may 
reinforce polytobacco use.25 National anti-tobacco communications are a successful strategy for increasing 
public knowledge about tobacco health risks and decreasing tobacco use;26-29 however,  they may not engage  
YA LGBT  polytobacco  users  for two reasons:  First,  existing  YA anti-tobacco communications  are not 
framed  to specifically address polytobacco  use risks.  Second,  LGBT  populations report  low 
engagement  with non- targeted anti-tobacco  communications.30,31 The proposed  study  will use 
experimental  methods  to address  these  concerns . This proposal directly supports the FDA’s mandate to 
educate the public about the risks of tobacco32 by [CONTACT_158351] : The study goal is to determine effective communication of polytobacco use risk to 
at-risk LGBT YA . We propose to:   
Aim 1. Identify  absolute  and relative  risk anti-tobacco messages  that effectively  communicate  polytobacco risks 
to LGBT young adults (K99).  Hypothesis:  Messages emphasizing relative (vs absolute) risk of polytobacco use 
will most effectively increase tobacco risk perceptions. Hypothesis:  AR and RR messages emphasizing quit 
efficacy will increase intentions to quit all tobacco while AR and RR messages emphasizing switch efficacy will 
increase intentions to switch to exclusive ENDS use.  
 
Aim 2. Determine the effects of cultural targeting on LGBT young adult polytobacco users’ attention to anti -
tobacco messages and perceived effectiveness (K99).  Hypothesis: Exposure to culturally targeted messages 
will result in greater engagement with and perceived effectiveness of anti -polytobacco messages among LGBT 
YA.  
 
Aim 3. (a) Assess the feasibility  of delivering MMS anti-tobacco messages developed in the K99 to LGBT 
young adults via texting; and (b)  Estimate  effect sizes of exposure to anti-tobacco messages  on risk 
perceptions  and tobacco  use over time (R00). Hypothesis : LGBT young adult polytobacco users exposed to 
any anti-tobacco  messages (vs not exposed) will report greater risk perceptions and reduced tobacco use.  
 
A team of exceptional NIH -funded researchers will provide mentorship for the proposed K99/R00  mentored 
research : Amy Ferketich, a tobacco prevention and control expert, with experience leading health 
communications studies to inform tobacco regulatory policy will provide primary mentorship with collaborative 
support from a team of co- mentors. This team is comprised of Elizabeth Klein and Darren Mays  who are 
experts in leveraging psychophysiological measurement for health communications studies; and Theodore Wagener , Director of the Center for Tobacco Research and expert in lab- based tobacco studies. A Mentoring 
Advisory Committee will provide further mentoring support and include Michael Pennell , biostatistician and 
expert in the statistical analysis of ps ychophysiological data and experimental studies, Michael Slater , health 
communications expert, and Paul Nini, an expert in applied visual communications design.  
II. BACKGROUND and RATIONALE  
This K99/R00  proposal addresses the FDA research priority area of Communications.  The rationale for 
the scientific aims is the following. While tobacco regulation has contributed to steady declines in combustible 
tobacco use, there has been a marked increase in the use of novel tobacco products, including electronic 
nicotine delivery systems (ENDS).6,[ADDRESS_240036]

 including ENDS, is increasing34 and is high in LGBT populations.5,21,35- 37 Between 22- 40% of LGBT young 
adults (YA)5-7 (vs 12 -21% of non -LGBT YA9,10) report past 30- day polytobacco use. This is concerning as many 
polytobacco users progress to exclusively using combustible tobacco.38,39 Both LGBT people8 and polytobacco 
users8,18- 24 are also less likely to perceive tobacco as harmful, which may reinforce tobacco use.25 The Food 
and Drug  Administration  (FDA)  Center  for Tobacco Products  (CTP)  is mandated to educate the public about 
the risks of tobacco products.26-29,[ADDRESS_240037]  specifically addressed polytobacco use. Existing  campaigns 
(e.g., The Real Cost , This Free Life) focused on communicating absolute risks  (AR) of specific tobacco 
products (e.g., “cigarette smoking leads to lung cancer”)  with the goal of preventing uptake in non -users or 
experimental users. YA polytobacco users have established tobacco patterns, so anti -tobacco  campaign goals 
must also aim to: (1) prevent uptake of additional products, and (2) promote total tobacco cessation, or (3) 
harm reduction53 by [CONTACT_158352], like ENDS.54,55 The FDA’s regulatory plan places tobacco 
products on a risk continuum,[ADDRESS_240038] of relative risk  (RR) communications 
(e.g., “cigarettes contain 9 times more cancer -causing chemicals than ENDS) on risk perceptions and tobacco 
use.57-59 Among smokers, RR communications increase intentions to quit smoking58 and switch to ENDS.57,58 
RR messages may also influence quitting and switching behaviors in polytobacco users.  
Targeting  is a broadly  supported communications strategy40 to increase engagement  with anti-tobacco  
communications.  LGBT  adults  engage less with anti-tobacco campaigns  than heterosexuals;30,[ADDRESS_240039] been leveraged in health campaigns targeting LGBT people,66,67 including This Free Life , 
the FDA’s first anti-tobacco campaign for LGBT YA who occasionally smoke.68 The campaign’s  culturally 
targeted smoking prevention messages reached perceived effectiveness ratings similar to prior youth49,[ADDRESS_240040] tested  if LGBT culturally targeted (vs non -targeted) 
messages are more engaging or effective for reducing polytobacco use.[ADDRESS_240041] effectively engage audiences.  If cultural 
targeting does not increase engagement and effectiveness of anti -tobacco messages, then the FDA 
may be able to reach at -risk LGBT people via campaigns targeting YA more generally .

 A conceptual model based on the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM)1-[ADDRESS_240042] 
framework4 will guide the proposed research (Figure 2).  Together they posit that, upon exposure to anti -
tobacco messages, a person proceeds through three steps: attention, reaction, and formation of attitudes and 
intentions. These steps determine whether a person engages in the behavior promoted in the message.75 The 
EPPM includes four key variables: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, response efficacy and self -
efficacy.25,76 The model predicts that messages which cause a high perceived threat and high efficacy will 
result in action (quitting, switching). The effectiveness of high threat58,77,78 messages for behavior change 
is well established; however, less is known about how to effectively frame efficacy messages. Prior anti-tobacco  campaigns have omitted efficacy statements entirely
1 or encouraged tobacco 
avoidance/cessation.28,[ADDRESS_240043] applied combination efficacy messages that emphasize total tobacco cessation, while stating that if smokers are not ready to quit, switching to exclusive ENDS use can 
reduce health risks.
58,80 However, combined quit/switch messages may be confusing for users.81 We will 
investigate optimal framing of threat/efficacy messages to communicate absolute and relative risk of 
polytobacco use.   
Bio-behavioral methods may be used to objectively quantify attention to culturally targeted anti -
tobacco messages.  Studies using self -report after anti -tobacco message exposure have revealed important 
information about behavioral intentions to use tobacco27,82- 84; however, self -report outcomes are subject to 
social desirability bias85 and can be enhanced by [CONTACT_68790]- behavioral methods.86-88 More specifically, 
psychophysiological measures can clarify which messages capture polytobacco users’ attention (eye- tracking) 
and evoke emotional responses (skin conductance) .[ADDRESS_240044] demonstrated effectiveness  for increasing 
cessation in YA smokers95-97 and preliminary  efficacy97 for changing risk perceptions  and behaviors  in YA 
waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_158330].  It is possible that anti-tobacco  mobile  multimedia  messages  (i.e., text plus graphic;  MMS) 
may be similarly  applied to communicate polytobacco use risks and reduce  polytobacco  use in LGBT  YA. Over  
96% of YA own a mobile  device with MMS,98 and 75% use it to seek  health information.99 By [CONTACT_158353]-
tobacco messages  via texting  we can target  content95 to LGBT  YA and, using MMS, mimic real -life exposure to 
anti-tobacco communications that LGBT YA may encounter while seeking health information using their 
device.

B. AIM 1 Phase 1 study  procedures  
(K99 Grant Year 1)  In Aim 1 w e will develop anti -tobacco messages  and assess effectiveness .  
 
In Aim 1 Phase 1,  we will use multi -methods to gain feedback on textual anti -tobacco messages and gain 
insights about visual elements (images, fonts, colors) that are appealing to young adult polytobacco users. 
Phase 1 studies will include the following:  
 
• Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 1 – FOCUS GROUPS  will explore terminology and message themes 
used in absolute and relative risk anti-tobacco  messages and quit/switch efficacy statements  
 
• Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 2 – ONLINE RATING SURVEY  will quantitatively assess how young 
adults rate absolute and relative  polytobacco risk messages and quit/switch efficacy statements 
for perceived effectiveness and reactance  
 
• Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 3 – IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS will explore qualitatively how young adults 
perceive 8 absolute risk and 8 relative  risk anti -tobacco messages.  
Aim 1,  Phase 1:  Study 1 – FOCUS GROUPS:  Focus group participants will be asked to share their opi[INVESTIGATOR_158332] -tobacco messages  (Table 2) . Anti-tobacco risk statements will pe presented in two 
sets; communicating either absolute (e.g., “ tobacco smoke contains 69 cancer -causing chemicals, including 
arsenic and formaldehyde”) or relative risk (e.g., “combustible tobacco products contain 9 times more cancer -
causing chemicals than ENDS) . Messages will address FDA -regulatory topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]106; for example: addiction, toxic

 exposure, and health effects (see supplemental documents  for sample risk statements).  We will then 
present examples of efficacy statements including quit only ( e.g., “Quit all tobacco products to reduce health 
risks.” ), switch only (e.g., “Switch to using e-cigarettes  to reduce health risks.” ), or quit plus switch messages 
(e.g., “Quit all tobacco products to reduce your risk of cancer . If you’re not ready to quit, switch to e -cigarettes  
only.”). Focus group feedback will be used to further develop text for anti -tobacco messages that will be further 
tested in Aim 1, Phase 2.  (see supplemental documents A for sample efficacy statements).  Focus group 
participants will also be asked to provide feedback on the acceptability, appeal, and comprehension of specific 
terms (e.g., “traditional cigarettes” vs. “combustible cigarettes”, “e -cigarettes” vs. “nicotine vapes” vs “vapes”).  
 
To assess graphics that are appealing to using adult 
polytobacco users, we will present examples of existing  
anti-tobacco messages from  FDA and Truth  anti-tobacco 
campaigns  (see samples in supplemental documents) . 
We will ask focus group participants to identify the graphic 
components that are more and less appealing from 
existing anti-tobacco  ads. We will use focus group 
feedback to add visual elements to the textual anti-
tobacco messages that will be further tested in Aim 1, 
Phase 2. Graphics will mirror visual styles of existing 
campaigns107 using bold colors and images of YA108 to 
represent topi[INVESTIGATOR_158333]. Messages and images will be refined based on focus group feedback.  
 
Aim 1, Phase 1:  Study 2 –ONLINE RATING SURVEY : In Phase 1, Study [ADDRESS_240046] an online survey 
to quantitatively examine young adults ’ perceptions of 8 absolute risk and 8 relative  risk anti -tobacco 
messages and quit/switch efficacy statements. To reduce participant burden, each participant will view a 
random sample of messages as follows: n = 5 absolute and relative  risk anti-tobacco messages  (of N = 24) , 
and n = 3 (of N = 12) efficacy messages . They will be asked to rate absolute and relative  risk antitobacco 
messages and quit/switch efficacy statements for perceived message effectiveness, likeability, and reactance.  
 
Aim 1, Phase 1:  Study 3 –IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS:  Interviewees will be asked to share their reactions to  the 
24 textual anti -tobacco messages tested in Study 2. Specifically, interviewees will be asked to rate their top 5   
(of N =12) absolute risk  and top 5  (of N =12) relative  risk antitobacco messages. We will then qualitatively 
explore their rationale for their top 5 selected messages.  
 Aim 1, Phase 2: ONLINE FACTORIAL EXPERIMENT : Using a 2x3 factorial experiment (Table 2) , plus control 
group design we will test the influence of AR and RR message framing on perceived effectiveness, tobacco 
risk perceptions, and behavioral intentions in young adult  ever polytobacco user s. Participants will be 
randomized to one of 8 conditions, including 6 experimental  sets of AR and RR anti -tobacco  messages( Table 
3) and a control set of AR or RR regulatory control messages . We will present 8 messages within each 
experimental and control set.  An expert panel of scientists, selected and invited by [CONTACT_201337], will 
review all messages, which we will further refine based on expert feedback prior to testing in Aim 1, Phase 2.  
B.1 Sample 
Participants for  Aim 1, Phase 1 studies  will be young adults ( age 18- 35 years) who live in the [LOCATION_002].  
and are susceptible to multiple nicotine and tobacco product use (i.e.,  have used combustible tobacco or  e-
cigarettes at least once ).

 In the Aim 1 Phase 1 focus groups and interviews, participants expressed concern that relative risk messages 
comparing combustible cigarette and ENDS use could increase young adult non -users' curiosity and intentions 
to use ENDS. The goal of anti -tobacco m essages being tested in this study is to increase harm perceptions 
and decrease use intentions among susceptible nicotine and tobacco users, However, we also do not want to 
negatively impact nonusers. After conferring with the mentoring committee and scien tific experts, in Phase 2, 
we will address this concern by [CONTACT_62866][INVESTIGATOR_158334]. As such, our sample will include young adults ( age 18- 35 years) who 
live in the [LOCATION_002]. Per the Aim 1, Phase [ADDRESS_240047] use (i.e.,  have used combustible tobacco or  e-cigarettes at 
least once ) and  approximately  half of the s ample will comprise U.S. young adult nonusers.  
For Aim 1 , Phase 1 , Study 1 --FOCUS GROUPS: T he maximum overall sample size will be N = 58. However, 
our analytic sample size  will start with 3 focus groups of size 6 -8 individuals  (N = 18 -24 total participants) . This 
sample size is standard in “usability research,” where existing messages are tested to uncover issues of 
effectiveness, and newly designed prototypes are tested to improve any communication issues. If we do not 
reach thematic saturation, we will conduct additional focus groups until thematic saturation is achieved, up to a 
total analytic sample size of N =  [ADDRESS_240048] inflated the overall sample size to 29 participants for 
each round of focus groups (N = 58) to allow for 20% dropout.    
Recruitment will occur  online via social media,  on OSU’s campus , and in the Columbus community. On 
campus, we will reach out to student groups and we will place flyers in residence halls and other buildings. We have used these methods in the past with success. We will also work with the Office of Minority Health at 
Columbus Public Health to reach a racially, ethnically, and economically diverse group of young men and 
women. Co-investigator Ferketich has  partnered with this office in the past and they have helped successfully 
recruit young people through their community connections. We will also partner with The Equitas Health 
Institute to reach LGBT young adults. Both the PI (Patterson) and Co- I (Ferketich) have relationships with The 
Equitas Health Institute through the College of Publi c Health. Focus groups will be balanced by [CONTACT_158356].  
 
Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 2 –ONLINE RATING SURVEY:  The overall sample size  will be N = 550.  Participants 
will be recruited via Prolific ( https://www.prolific.co/), a platform for online subject recruitment for research, 
which is supported by [CONTACT_158357]. In recent years, Prolific has been extensively 
used in social science research and by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_158335]. Prolific enables researchers to recruit 
participants to perform tasks such as filling out surveys, opi[INVESTIGATOR_158336], cognitive psychological studies, and many others. Researchers advertise their studies on Prolific, and participants choose only those studies that interest them. Participants are paid for completing the studies. In the PI’s prior research using Prolific to rec ruit 
young adults into survey studies, approximately 3% of survey participants had inconsistencies between the 
prescreening questions asked by [CONTACT_158358] (e.g., age range) and demographic questions reported as part of the 
survey (e.g., numerical age). Data f or these participants was not included in analyses, as we could not confirm 
that they met study eligibility criteria. As our analytic sample size  is N = 500 participants; we have inflated our 
overall sample size is inflated by 10% to account for estimated inconsistencies between prescreening and 
survey responses.  
We will monitor enrollment with the goal of recruiting a balance of young adult participants by [CONTACT_654] (younger: 
age 18- 25, older: age 26 -35), gender, and sexual orientation. From current population- based estimates, we 
expect that study participants will be 57% non -Hispanic white, 19% non- Hispanic black, 15% Hispanic, and 6% 
Asian, and the remaining representing other race groups.

expect that study participants will be 57 % non -Hispanic white, 1 9% non -Hispanic black, 15% Hispanic, and 6 % 
Asian, and the remaining representing other race groups.  
 
B.2. Measurement / Instrumentation  
For Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 1 --FOCUS GROUPS:  A focus group guide will be developed and will be used to 
facilitate the research for preliminary work. Participants will be asked about their opi[INVESTIGATOR_158337] a series of 
absolute and relative  risk polytobacco use statements, efficacy statements, and visual elements of anti-tobacco  
communication campaigns . Participants will also be asked their thoughts  on the types of images to pair  with 
anti-tobacco risk statements.  
For Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 2 —ONLINE RATING SURVEY:  Primary outcome measures are presented in Table 
1. Baseline questionnaires will assess EC and combustible tobacco use,[ADDRESS_240051]-viewing 
their randomly assigned messages  participants will be asked to rate each message for perceived message 
effectiveness,70,101  likeability,112 and reactance.104 Finally, sociodemographic questions also include age, 
race/ethnicity, education level, location (state,  zip code, rurality), sexual orientation113 and gender identity.114

 For Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 3 —IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS:  An interview guide will be developed and will be used 
to facilitate the research. Specifically, interviewees will be asked to rate their top 5 (of N =12) absolute risk and 
top 5 (of N =12) relative  risk antitobacco messages. We will then qualitatively explore their rationale for their 
top 5 selected messages.  We will also ask participants to share their opi[INVESTIGATOR_158338] -tobacco risk statements.  
 
For Aim 1, Phase 2 -ONLINE FACTORIAL EXPERIMENT:  Primary outcome measures are presented in Table 
1. These measures were largely selected from the Tobacco Regulatory Research PhenX Toolkit.115,[ADDRESS_240052], and effectiveness of the messages. 
All baseline measures (excluding social media use and prior anti -tobacco message exposure) will be asked 
post-viewing all messages. Finally, sociodemographic questions also include age, race/ethnicity, education 
level, location (state, county, rurality), sexual orientation113 and gender identity.[ADDRESS_240053] strongly influence LGBT

IV. DETAILED STUDY PROCEDURES  
A. Aim 1,  Phase 1:  Study [ADDRESS_240054] all questions answered to their satisfaction. Once the 
eligible participant understands the consent form and process, then and only then will the eligible participant be 
asked to give verbal con sent. Eligible participants that do not consent will be released at this time.  Consenting 
participants will be emailed the informed consent script for their records. A PDF copy of the informed consent script will also be made available for download as part of t he online questionnaire.  
 The research team member will ask eligible and consented participants for an email address for online 
questionnai re distribution and to send information for the future focus group . After the call has concluded, the 
research team member will email participants a link to a short questionnaire distributed via Qualtrics with 
questions about tobacco use, intentions to quit smoking, and demographic characteristics.

anticipated to be about 90 minutes. Audio- recorded data will capture participants’ verbal ratings and reactions 
to polytobacco use risk statements (absolute and relative risk), quit efficacy statements, and visual elements of 
existing  national anti-tobacco campaigns. Specifically, participants will be asked to rate and then describe their 
reactions to anti -tobacco messages, including whether they believe the message effectively communicates 
tobacco risk (absolute or relative ) and whether the message would be effective at preventing polytobacco use 
among young adults. Then, they will be asked to provide their opi[INVESTIGATOR_158340].  They will also be asked about their reactions to self -efficacy statements promoting quitting and, if 
participants are not ready to quit, switching to lower harm products. Finally, participants will be asked to share their reactions to visual elements (images, fonts, colors) used in existing FDA and Truth© anti-tobacco 
campaigns. Participants will receive $[ADDRESS_240058] distributed via email in appreciation of their time.  
 
Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 1- FOCUS GROUP d ata will be used to further develop/refine text and graphics for anti -
tobacco messages that will be further tested in Aim 1, Phase 2.  
 
B. Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 2 —ONLINE RATING SURVEY  Procedures 
Prescreening and consent . Participants will be recruited via Prolific, an online platform open to participants 
who are compensated for completing surveys and online behavioral experiments. Prolific is an efficient online 
recruitment platform, ideal for pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], as it can deliver a high number of participants, per day, at low cost (recommended, minimum $0.175 per minute of survey participation time). Data quality  provided by [CONTACT_158364] .
122  Prolific offers access to 
over 38,000 [LOCATION_002] nationals. Prolific samples are young; approximately 1/3 of the Prolific population 
reports ages < [ADDRESS_240059] for age (18 -35 
years) and currently residing the [LOCATION_002]. It can also help us track gender and sexual orientation in order 
to balance recruitment. We are able to add in a custom pre -screening question to assess for prior history of 
ever nicotine or tobacco use (i.e., use of combustible tobacco or e- cigarette products at least once).  
Participants who meet eligibility criteria will be directed to an online survey administered via Qualtrics. Consent 
will be completed online prior to the Qualtrics survey.

 Qualtrics survey procedures . Following online consent, participants will be directed to complete a survey that 
includes questions assessing tobacco use, including exposure to tobacco related advertising, coupons, and 
discounts; harms perceptions and tobacco -related behavioral intentions (i.e., quit, switch).  It is estimated that  
the survey will take 20 minutes to complete.  
 Participants will answer baseline survey questions before viewing a random sample of 5 messages (of N = 24); 
they will rate each message for perceived effectiveness
70,101,102, likeability,[ADDRESS_240060] -survey and receive $0.175/minute (estimated $3.50 ) via Prolific for 
participating.   
 
As per Prolific procedures, participants are paid via Prolific only when submitted work is approved by [CONTACT_123894]. Participants are redirected back to Prolific at the end of the Qualtrics survey via a Completion URL, which 
proves that they have completed the study. This code is given to the participants who submit a complete and 
valid response to the survey. The study team compares the Qualtrics surveys to the participants redirected back 
to Prolific via the URL. If a survey participant is not matched to a redirect URL, a participant is not paid.  
 
To contextualize data quality, we will include an instructional manipulation check124 at the end of the survey. 
A participant’s answer to this question will not affect payment for survey participation; rather, it will be used 
during data analysis to identify potential problematic survey responses for in- depth data checks. Participants 
will be asked the following:

V. RISKS, BENEFITS, SAFETY PLANS 
A. Risks associated with the study  
Potential risks are minimal for the focus group and survey studies. Some of the questions may upset individuals; 
however, we have used these questions and procedures in many previous studies without upsetting 
participants. A potential  risk is loss of confidentiality  In our screener, we collect participant contact [CONTACT_3031]. 
We have rigid procedures  in place to protect  against  loss of confidentiality.  Participant  identifiers  will be kept in 
password- protected files, stored on secure OSU servers.  
 
B. Benefits associated with the study  
There are no direct  benefits  to be gained  by [CONTACT_4317] . However,  the anticipated  societal  benefit  resulting  
from this  study  is considerable,  given  the increasing prevalence of polytobacco use, including ENDS . 
Societal benefits include increased public health resulting from this study providing evidence that directly 
informs and strengthens FDAs tobacco public education efforts. Few studies have been conducted on 
effectively communicating tobacco risk to polyto bacco users and at the same time, there is mounting 
evidence that LGBT young adult  polytobacco users , a vulnerable population from a tobacco control 
perspective, are largely m isinformed of the risks of combustible tobacco and ENDS  use.

 VI. DATA ANALYSIS  
A. Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 1 —FOCUS GROUPS Data Analysis   
For focus groups,  the goal is  to refine messages and determine which images should be matched to the AR 
and RR anti -tobacco  messages. These images will then move on to Aim 1 Phase 2 of this study. We will 
qualitatively summarize the feedback in response to each focus group question.  
 
Sample size justification:  For Aim 1 Phase 1 : Study 1 —FOCUS GROUPS: A  planned analytic sample 
size of N = [ADDRESS_240068] round of 
focus group, we will enroll up to an additional 24 participants (for a maximum analytic of N = 48).The 
sample size was inflated to 29 participants for each round of focus groups to allow for 20% dropout ; 
resul ting in a maximum overall sample size of N = 58 focus group participants.  
 
B. Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 2-ONLINE RATING SURVEY Data Analysis  
For online rating survey data, we will describe mean and median values of participants’ ratings of perceived  
message effectiveness, likeability, and reactance.  
In exploratory analyses, we will l assess whether there are systematic differences in participants’ ratings by 
[CONTACT_158371] (AR vs RR), gender, LGBT status (vs non -LGBT) , race/ethnicity, age (e.g., 18 -24 vs 25- 35) and 
tobacco user ty pe (e.g., current, former, never polytobacco user). We will test mean differences between 
groups using t -tests or ANOVA. If there are violations of assumptions (e.g., normality) we will test median 
differences between groups using Wilcoxon rank -sum test  (two groups) or Kruskal Wallis test (more than 2 
groups).  
We will also run  exploratory regression models to evaluate the effect of risk message type ( e.g., absolute risk 
vs. relative risk)  and efficacy message type (e.g., quit; switch; combination)  on messages on perceived 
message effectiveness, likeability, and reactance ; controlling for pro - and anti -tobacco marketing exposure, 
baseline risk and efficacy perceptions and behavioral intentions. For models testing the effect of efficacy 
messages, we will conduct overall F- tests to determine if there is an effect of  efficacy message type in each 
model. If so, pairwise t -tests will be conducted, and Holm’s procedure will be used to control Type I error rate.  
 
Sample Size Justification : For Aim 1, Phase 1, Study 2-- ONLINE RATING SURVEY:  An analytic 
sample size  of [ADDRESS_240069] deviation of 1.0 units, the 
study would require a minimum sample size of n =  199 for each group to achieve power  of 80% and 
two-sided significance level of p = .[ADDRESS_240070] a 0.25 unit difference in PME scores with 75% probability 
assuming a significance level of p = 0.1. As multi -group comparisons are exploratory, we believe this a 
prior sample size calculation is appropriate. As our  desired  analytic sample size is N = 5 00 participants 
(n = 2 50 participants per experimental group ; AR vs RR messages ); we have inflated our overall 
sample size is inflated by 10% to account for estimated inconsistencies between prescreening and survey responses, resulting in an overall sample size  of N = 550.

C. Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 3 —IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS :  
For in-depth interviews the goal will be to refine messages and determine which images should be matched to 
the AR and RR anti -tobacco messages. These images will then move on to Aim 1 Phase 2 of this study. We 
will qualitatively summarize the feedback in response to each focus group question using rigorous and 
accelerated data reduction (RADaR)  analytic methods.125 Used in  applied research, RADaR organizes 
transcribed textual data from qualitative interviews into data tables; which are then organized and iteratively 
reduced, coded, and analyzed using team -based coding.  
 
Sample size justification:  For Aim 1, Phase 1: Study 3— IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS o ur planned analytic 
sample size  of N = [ADDRESS_240071] existing messages to improve any communication issues. If we do not reach thematic saturation, we will enroll additional  participants up to a maximum of N = 16.  We have inflated 
the overall sample size to 20  participants to allow for  ~20% dropout.    
 
D. Aim 1, Phase 2 : ONLINE FACTORIAL EXPERIMENT Data Analysis  
We will fit linear regression models to evaluate the effect of condition on perceived effectiveness, risk 
perceptions, and behavioral intentions. Covariates will include exposure to pro - and anti-tobacco  marketing, 
and baseline risk perception and behavioral intention items (per respective models). Baseline and post -viewing 
scores may be transformed if violations of assumptions are detected. We will conduct overall F -tests to 
determine if there is an effect of condition in each model. If so, pairwise t -tests  will be conducted, and Holm’s 
procedure will be used to control Type I error rate. Exploratory analyses will be conducted to determine if there 
is an interactive effect between Condition x Topic. Responses will be examined by [CONTACT_201338] . 
Sample Size Justification : For the Aim 1, Phase 2 : ONLINE FACTORIAL EXPERIMENT  an analytic 
sample size  of [ADDRESS_240072] message in terms of risk 
perception score with 75% probability assuming the mean score in the best group is at least 0.[ADDRESS_240073].  As our analytic sample size  is N = 2800 participants (n = 400 participants per experimental or 
control group); we have inflated our overall sample size is inflated by 5 % to account for estimated 
inconsistencies between prescreening and survey responses, resulting in an overall sample size  of N = 
2940.  
VII. DATA SAFETY and MONITORING PLAN  
The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  will be 
the DSMC of record and, thus, will be responsible for reviewing the study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_879] a summary report 
of the study’s progress, including all subsite activities and data status to the DSMC on an annual basis. All 
adverse events related to the study will be recorded by [CONTACT_473]. The study investigators will evaluate 
adverse events and study data during their weekly meetings and make a determ ination of whether any adverse 
events affect the risk/benefit ratio of the study and whether modifications to the protocol (e.g., Potential risks) or consent procedures are required.

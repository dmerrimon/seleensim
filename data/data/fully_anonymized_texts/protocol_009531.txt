Lower extremity amputations in the Veterans Administration Health Care System are a 
significant cause of morbidity, mortality, loss of function, and reduced quality of life. Ad aptation 
to limb loss is a long -term and complex process. Recent research suggests that patients benefit 
from ongoing partnerships with healthcare providers to help improve overall health and reduce 
disability. One important pi[INVESTIGATOR_892541]-management, which is the process 
where a patient adopts an active role in managing the symptoms, treatment, physical and 
psychosocial consequences, and lifestyle changes that are inherent in living with a chronic 
condition, such as an amputation. The pr imary purpose of this study is to e valuate the 
effectiveness of a 5-week group -based self -management intervention for Veterans with lower 
extremity limb loss (VETPALS). VETPALS is an adaption of an empi[INVESTIGATOR_892542] -
management program,  PALS (Promo ting Amputee Life Skills). The PALS program 
demonstrated improved physical and psychosocial functioning when delivered in community -
based support groups for amputees, but this program has not been adapted for the needs of 
Veterans and implemented in the VA  healthcare system.  
 
This study is a two -arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine the efficacy of 
VETPALS. Study staff will screen and enroll Veterans with recent lower extremity limb loss 
within the last 2 years . Each participant will complete a baseline interview and then is 
sequentially placed into a cohort of 6-10 participants; each cohort will be randomized to the 
VETPALS group based self -management program (intervention)  or an individual education 
support program  (control).  Once participant s complete the randomized arm and follow -up 
assessments, they are free to participate in the other group. This ensures  participants are 
offered both programs and are not deprived of a potentially valuable healthcare service .  
 
All participants will complet e outcome interview assessments at baseline, 6 weeks (coinciding 
with the end of the VETPALS or individual program ) and [ADDRESS_1250142]. This study is one of the only 
prospective randomized controlled trials of a behavioral intervention for individuals with limb 
loss. Up to 750  patients will be enrolled in the study across 5 VA sites. The VA Puget Sound 
Health Care System (Seattle, WA) will oversee this study at five VA sites: Seattle, Houston, 
Cleveland, Tampa , and Minneapolis . Target enrollment between the five VA sites is [ADDRESS_1250143] that results of the study will be used to 
integrate a s elf-management intervention into the VA Amputation System of Care.

 3.0 Introduction  
Scientific Background  
 
Dysvascular lower extremity amputation is a significant health care concern. Lower extremity 
amputations are a significant cause of morbidity, mortality and loss of function.  Every year, over 
150,000 indivi duals undergo amputation related to dysvascular disease or diabetes .
1Over the period of 1988 to 1996, rates of lower limb amputation in the Unites States 
complicated by [CONTACT_892586] 27%,[ADDRESS_1250179] two 
decades, there has b een 
increasing recognition that the 
challenges posed by [CONTACT_892587], and that health 
care delivery should be adapted and tailored to these specific longer -term needs . One 
promine nt example is the Wagner Model of Chronic Illness Care.4 The Wagner Model proposes 
that for individuals with chronic illness, health care resources and practices should be re -aligned 
so as to focus less on discrete, acute intervention and more on sustainab le, long -term 
management.5  The ultimate goal is an ongoing partnership between "informed active patients 
and a prepared proactive team ” (Figure 1) .4, 6-7 Thus, building patients' investment and 
involvement in their own care is an essential component of th is process . The specific 
mechanism for doing this is the promotion and facilitation of self - management . This increased 
emphasis upon patient participation is also highly consistent with the Institute of Medicine's 
charge to the US health care system to be come more patient and family centered.[ADDRESS_1250180] u ndertake to live well with one or more chronic conditions.10 More 
specifically this entails the "ability to manage the symptoms, treatment, physical and 
psychosocial consequences, and lifestyle changes inherent in living with a chronic condition."[ADDRESS_1250181] their health in three domains by 1) impacting their primary disease 
process (e.g., properly managing diabetes, hypertension), 2) managing secondary 

 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 12 of 54 
 complications and symptoms (e.g., skin care, pain management, depression), and 3) proactively 
engaging in activities that may or  may not be directly related to limb loss, but bolster health, 
well-being  and quality of life (e.g., stress management, social supp ort).  
Self-management interventions have been successful in improving outcomes across a broad 
variety of chronic illnesses including arthritis11,12,13,[ADDRESS_1250182] effective over the life of an 
illness, and bring noticeable improvements in quality adjusted life years.26,27,28 
Self-management interventions improve outcomes by [CONTACT_79660] -efficacy, patient activation 
and problem solving . Self-efficacy is " the belief in one’s capabilities to organize and execute the 
courses of action required to manage prospective situations."[ADDRESS_1250183] practice in medical rehabilitation management, rehabilitation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and prosthetic 
componentry.33  With a series of regional centers, network sites, and clinic teams, the 
amputation system of care is charged with providing services that are comprehensive, holistic, 
and "coordinate lifelong rehabilitation… for service members and veterans as they progres s 
from the acute care setting to their home environments."34  One essential component of this 
service is the promotion of a partnership between patients and providers such that new 
amputees receive the knowledge and skills to become active participants in t heir own long -term 
health care.  
 
The VA Amputation System of Care recognizes the value of self -management in long -term 
amputation care and intends to disseminate self -management interventions . Given the 
demonstrated value of self -management programs, the VA Amputation System of Care is in the 
process of actively establishing self -management groups at RAC s (Regional Amputee Centers) 
and PANS (Polytrauma Amputation Network Sites) locations throughout the [LOCATION_002] . 
Based upon the initial data reported by  [CONTACT_892588], the PALS program 
has been selected as the intervention for national V A dissemination . In fact, in 2011 staff 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1250184] to translate the intervention in terms of duration, content, and delivery 
(i.e., partially by [CONTACT_892589] ) to achieve maximum benefit in the VA . The proposed 
project is both well poised and well timed to provide meaningful information to inform the 
development of health care practice and policy for Veterans with amputation .  
Limitations of cur rent data and research  
Initial evidence of the effectivenes s of self -management following limb loss is promising, but 
limited . Only one published trial to date has examined self -management for amputees . The 
Promoting Amputee Life Skills (PALS) project,[ADDRESS_1250185] demonstrated that group -based self -management could 
effectively improve physical and psychosocial functioning following limb loss, and was well 
received by [CONTACT_4317] . The current proposal builds upon previous research that has 
demons trated the efficacy of the PALS self -management intervention, but addresses important 
next questions:  1) Is the PALS self -management intervention appropriate for Veterans, 
specifically considering the very high prevalence of diabetes and vascular disease,  2) Can it be 
housed and delivered within a health care system as opposed to existing community support 
groups 3) Will the intervention be more effective for individuals who are new amputees and 4) 
Will a shorter format that also incorporates an option for  video t eleconferencing  retain the 
efficacy of the original PALS intervention?  
Limitations of the initial PALS trial  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_892545], the applicability of this 
intervention to the VA Health Care System remai ns unknown. Several important questions 
remain unanswered:  
1. The original PALS intervention made use of existing community -based support groups . 
PALS was implemented in a network of established support groups maintained by [CONTACT_892590], a national c onsumer organization . Groups were composed of individuals 
who had already expressed an interest in, and dedication to, support group attendance . 
Although this study design had obvious strengths in terms of its ability to capi[INVESTIGATOR_892546], it also had challenges, as the casual settings and strong emphasis upon 
socialization sometimes undermined the ability to cover formal content . As a part of its 
ongoing quality improvement processes, the Amputee Coalition has recommended that 
PALS be imple mented in a structured medical setting . The efficacy of PALS in such a 
setting has not been established . This is one of the primary goals of this current study.  
2. The original PALS intervention made use of a heterogeneous patient population that is not 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_892547] . Original PALS participants 
reported a range of etiologies of limb loss . Roughly one third (37.1%) reported their 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1250186] reported a traumatic 
ampu tation (39.3%) and the remaining third reported amputation due to cancer, limb 
deficiency, or other cause (23.6%) . In contrast, nearly 98% of amputations within the VA are 
due to dysvascular disease or diabetes.[ADDRESS_1250187] 75% of the scheduled sessions . Within the intervention 
condition receiving PALS, only 64.7% achieved this level of compliance . Based upon the 
experience from this pre vious trial, the proposed VETPALS intervention has altered the 
session structure so that the initial session in which skills are presented is longer, but the 
total nu mber of sessions is reduced to [ADDRESS_1250188], the VA Amputation System of Care is 
specifically mandated to implement and sustain tele -rehabilitation programs "to assure 
consisten cy of amputation rehabilitation across the VA."37  The proposed VETPALS 
intervention allows Veterans to participate via video t eleconferencing . To date there is no 
evidence of the effectiveness of amputation self -management that utilizes telehealth 
technolo gy to facilitate participation .  
6. The original PALS intervention was more effective for individuals endorsing difficulties with 
an outcome the intervention was designed to address . Individuals who reported depression 
or low self -efficacy at baseline were mo re likely to experience improvements in physical 
functioning, depression, and self -efficacy as a result of the intervention . Although this finding 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 15 of 54 
 is not surprising, and i s not a specific limitation of PALS, it raises an important question for 
an intervent ion that is directed globally at Veterans with limb loss, namely "Do the identified 
outcomes of this intervention actually reflect important challenges faced by [CONTACT_68847]?"   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_892548], the applicability of PALS to the VA remains unkn own. 
Specifically, little is known about the efficacy of PALS 1) when implemented in medical 
settings, 2) for Veterans with dysvascular disease and diabetes, 3) who are new amputees, 
4) using a shortened format incorporating video t eleconferencing  to impro ve participation . 
The proposed study, using the adapted intervention, VETPALS, addresses these issues and 
represents the next logical step in research on the application of this clinical program to the 
VA.  
4.0 Objectives  
 
Aim 1: Randomized Controlled Trial – Primary Outcomes  
Determine the impact of a group -based self -management intervention for Veterans with 
limb loss (VETPALS) upon physical and psychosocial functioning  
 
Hypothesis 1a : Individuals randomized to VETPALS will display greater improvements from 
baseline in physical functioning as measured by [CONTACT_892591] (MFA -SF) than Veterans in the individual education support (control)  condition post -
intervention and at 6 -month follow -up. 
 
Hypothesis 1b : Individuals randomi zed to VETPALS will display greater improvements from 
baseline in psychosocial functioning as measured by [CONTACT_892592] (PHQ -9) than Veterans in the individual education support  condition post -
intervention and at 6 -mont h follow -up.  
 
Aim 2: Randomized Controlled Trial – Secondary Outcomes  
Determine the impact of a group -based self -management intervention (VETPALS) upon 
self-efficacy, patient activation, problem solving, quality of life, and positive affect.  
 
Hypothesis 2a-e: Individuals randomized to VETPALS will display greater improvements from 
baseline in self -efficacy, patient activation, problem solving, quality of life and positive affect 
than Veterans in the individual education support  condition post -intervention  and at 6 -month 
follow -up.  
 
Hypothesis 2f : Changes in the intermediate outcomes of self -efficacy, patient activation, and 
problem solving, thought to be core components of effective self -management, will correlate 
strongly with changes in the primary outc omes of physical and psychosocial functioning.  
 
 
Aim 3: Implementation Evaluation  
 
We will evaluate the implementation of the VETPALS intervention into the VA health care 
system by [CONTACT_66567] 1) actual versus planned participation (recruitment, retention, treatment 
engagement, treatment fidelity), 2)  barriers and facilitators to implementation, and 3) participant 
perceptions of the treatment.  
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 16 of 54 
  
Our evaluation is directly informed by, and reflective of, the RE -AIM framework38, which 
proposes dimensions for c onsideration in the translation of research into real -world practice. 
RE-AIM incorporates the following: Reach (participation within intended population and 
characteristics of participants), Efficacy (the impact of an intervention when implemented as 
inten ded), Adoption (the percentage and representativeness of organizations that will adopt the 
intervention), Implementation (intervention integrity, quality, and consistency), and Maintenance 
(the degree to which intervention impacts are maintained at the ind ividual and organizational 
level). Our particular implementation and strategies questions are tailored primarily to provide 
qualitative information about Reach (by [CONTACT_892593] -participants  using focus groups) and Implementation (via fidelity monitoring 
as well as focused interviews to assess qualitative aspects of intervention integrity). Information 
about Efficacy and Maintenance (at an individual level) will be assessed in Aims 1 and 2. O ur 
combined use of survey measures and qualitative, semi -structured interviews is a well -
established methodology in the health services literature ,39-40 and several of our questions were 
modeled after the semi -structured interview items provided in Curran et  al. (2011).  
To assess actual versus planned intervention participation in the VA context, which reflects the 
RE-AIM dimensions of Reach and Implementation, we will measure several aspects of 
participation (proportion of appropriate population who particip ates, characteristics of 
participants and non -participants, retention, treatment engagement/adherence, other therapy 
exposures) and implementation (treatment fidelity, leader perceptions of the intervention) on an 
ongoing basis and at the time of treatment  completion. Study coordinators will maintain detailed 
logs of all potentially eligible participants, so that reach can be assessed. For participants, group 
leaders will maintain a weekly log documenting attendance and modality of participation (in -
person vs. video t eleconference), tardiness or early departures from each session, and whether 
or not homework assignments were completed in the previous week . Additionally, to assess 
overall treatment engagement and adherence, we will have both group leaders com plete the 
Psychosocial Treatment Compliance Scale  (PTCS)41 for each participant upon treatment 
completion. The combination of these two data sources (weekly logs and PTCS) will allow us to 
examine differences in participation by [CONTACT_892594] (in -person  vs. video t eleconference), 
understand retention, and quantify treatment exposure.  
For participants in both the control and intervention conditions we will also administer a brief 
survey at the end of the intervention that measures utilization of supplemen tary project 
resources, including the recommended websites and participation in concurrent 
therapeutic/clinical activities (e.g., therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], locally available programs such as peer visits, 
utilization of  Amputee Coalition  resources) . This brief survey will  also assess several potential 
factors in engagement, including perceived credibility of the treatment and perceived self -
reported engagement in the treatment.   
Treatment fidelity will be computed on an on going basis. The overall  fidelity of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_892549] a percentage of essential treatment elements adhered to out 
of the total number of essential elements (using the checklists) . Treatment fidelity will be 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 17 of 54 
 reported in the final manuscript submitted for publication. Inter -rater reliability for the fidelity 
checks will also be computed and reported .  
To describe and understand barriers and facilitators to implementation in the VA context and to 
further assess Reach and Implementation dimensions, we will assess for any syste matic 
differences in recruitment and retention due to age, gender, ethnicity, geographic distance from 
the medical center, amputation level, or marital status. Additionally, investigator -level study staff 
(Drs. Turner, Williams, Norvell) will conduct struc tured interviews with the site coordinators and 
each of the VETPALS facilitators  in the program at the study conclusion to assess the time 
commitment required to lead each group, the administrative procedures used (i.e., clinic and 
procedure codes, schedul ing strategies), and any local clinical or organizational factors that 
facilitated or hindered recruitment, scheduling, retention, or delivery of the intervention. To 
understand better any barriers and facilitators to implementation from the Veteran’s pers pective, 
we will conduct [ADDRESS_1250189] in -person focus 
groups which may include participants via telehealth.  We will also ask all intervention 
participants to complete a questionnaire via pencil -and-paper to forma lly assess treatment 
satisfaction (the same satisfaction items used in the original PALS study).   
5.0 Resources and Personnel  
Roles and responsibilities   
The Principal Investigator/Study Chair  (Aaron P. Turner, PhD ) and Co-Principal (Joseph M. 
Czerniecki, MD),  will assume responsibility for all aspects of the conduct of this research study 
and supervise all Seattle -based personnel. They, along with the site PIs, will be responsible for 
training research staff, including the VETPALS facilitators, peer facilitato rs, and site study 
coordinators. They will also develop the study protocol, operations manual, monitoring plan and 
have oversight on study monitoring and study steering committee meetings.  
Site Principal Investigators  (Drs. Heckman, Henson, Kelly, Latlief , and Hansen ) are 
responsible for operations, data collection, and data integrity at their sites which involves 
oversight of the site study coordinators and regular meetings to discuss data and operations. 
They are also responsible for training the researc h staff at their site, including the VETPALS 
facilitator, peer facilitator, and site study coordinator. Site PIs, along with VETPALS facilitators, 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1250190] with screening and enrollment as needed at their site.  
Co-Investigators (Rhonda Williams, PhD and Dawn Ehde, PhD ) will oversee VETPALS 
facilitator ratings on an ongoing basis to provide corrective feedback to facilitators in real -time 
along wi th the PI/SC. They will also lead weekly meetings with the study facilitators to provide 
ongoing supervisi on and discuss delivery o f the treatment, including the prevention of facilitator 
drift in the manuals. The Co -Investigators will also assist with tas ks as requested by [CONTACT_978]/SC, 
which include but are not limited to: finalizing the study protocol, overseeing progress at all 
sites, developi[INVESTIGATOR_892550], monitor treatment fidelity by 
[CONTACT_892595], running steerin g committee meetings, and training VETPALS facilitators 
and peer facilitators.  
Co-Investigator Stephen T. Wegener, PhD was a Co -PI [INVESTIGATOR_892551]. He will assist with tasks as requested by [CONTACT_978]/SC and Co -
Investig ators, which include but are not limited to: training VETPALS facilitators and peer 
facilitators, revising the treatment manual/participant workbook , interpretation of statistical 
analysis, and writing manuscripts for publication at the end of the study.  
Co-Investigator and Consultant [CONTACT_892649]  is responsible for all pre -study tasks and 
training of research staff . This includes  oversight of all baseline and follow -up assessments , 
database development for data entry and analysis, and assistance in IRB submiss ion. The VA 
Puget Sound will act as the lead study site and will host an investigators ' meeting , which  study 
site PIs, coordinators and VETPALS facilitators will attend to receive appropriate pre -study 
training . During this training session, the  core investigators will ensure that all study materials 
(surveys, protocol, inclusion/exclusion criteria) are discussed, ensure that the study coordinator 
fully understands the study procedures and SOPs, and that all regulatory documents are 
approved and appropriately filed in regulatory binders . Initial training for V ETPALS group  
facilitators will happen at this time and is described in more detail in the next section.  He will 
also be a consultant on study operations. He will also monitor subject recruitm ent and follow -up 
rates at all sites and will monitor all adverse events.  
[CONTACT_892650] will also oversee the database manager at Spectrum Research and all database 
operations , including but not limited to, d ata queries, data analysis, data export as reques ted by 
[CONTACT_978]/SC. He will have primary responsibility for ensuring the safety and secure storage of all 
electronic study data . [CONTACT_892650] and Spectrum Research will only have access to coded data.  
Site study coordinators  are primarily responsible for day  to day study operations, which 
include recruiting participants and ensuring that all enrolled participants are adhering to the 
study protocol. These tasks include: ensuring all potential participants are identified through 
screening procedures, appropriat ely obtaining informed consent and HIPAA authorization , 
maintaining an updated screening and enrollment log, contact[CONTACT_892596], and collecting baseline and follow -up data through the 
electronic da ta capture  (EDC) system using an eCRF.  The Seattle site study coordinator may 
also conduct study interviews by [CONTACT_892597] a site study coordinator is 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1250191]. Norvell, the PI ([CONTACT_278520]) and Co -PI ([CONTACT_892651]) to assist in 
study troubleshooting with the site PIs and study coordinators as needed. The study project 
coordinator, with oversight from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -PI, is responsible for submitting IRB materials to 
the VA Central IRB, including but not limited to: initial applications, protocol modifications, site 
correspondence, protocol deviations, and SAE reports. The project coordinator, along with [CONTACT_892652], a lso monitors the site study coordinators and communicates with investigators to 
ensure efficient day -to-day study operations. The project coordinator will organize  monthly 
teleconferences with site PIs and study coordinators to discuss progress, operations , and 
answer group operational questions as they arise.  
Additionally, VAPSHCS project staff will conduct periodic site monitoring and quality assurance 
of each site to ensure that informed consent, training requirements, and adverse event 
monitoring are b eing routinely performed in strict accordance with the research protocol, 
requirements of the Central IRB, and local VA R&D committees. During the first [ADDRESS_1250192] coordinator and/or Drs. Turner and Norvell will conduc t a 
virtual internal audit using the regulatory audit template from VAPSHCS . We will encourage 
each site to conduct an internal audit that adheres to their facility audit process to confirm both 
project wide and local facility compliance. We will also work  to request a formal R&D audit 
during year 1, if possible, regardless of the local policy at each site.  
VETPALS facilitators are allied health professionals who are responsible for implementing the 
VETPALS intervention group sessions. VETPALS facilitators  will be trained by [CONTACT_892598] a modified version of PALS which reflects changes in content, delivery 
modalities (e.g. telehealth, video teleconferencing), and participants (Veterans with dysvascular 
disease/diabetes). VETPA LS facilitators will receive training during a two -day group -based 
training that includes didactics, supervised practice, discussion, and home study. Notably, all 
VETPALS facilitators have already received initial training the PALS protocol and have 
advanc ed Department of Defense  (DOD)  training and certification in amputation care.  VETPALS 
facilitators are primarily responsible for contact[CONTACT_892599] a group of 
participants, maintaining an accurate randomi zation log, and conducting the  5 intervention 
sessions per group of 8±[ADDRESS_1250193] 
with screening and enrollme nt at their site.  
VETPALS peer facilitators  are Veterans with limb loss. One peer facilitator at each site will be 
identified and trained by [CONTACT_892600].  Substitute or alternate peer facilitators may 
also receive training as needed at each sit e. The peer facilitator will help co -lead the VETPALS 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 20 of 54 
 sessions  (as in the original PALS program) . The peer mentor will only have study -related 
contact [CONTACT_892601]. The peer will not access the medical record, 
or engage in other research -related activities. Thus, the peer mentor will not have access to any 
information about the participant that is not shared directly by [CONTACT_892602] .  
The biostatistician  (David Yan ez, PhD) will conduct periodic queries of the  database to look for 
any discrepancies or inaccuracies in the data (e.g. missing and nonsensical values) that may 
not have pi[INVESTIGATOR_892552]. The biostatistician will primarily be 
responsible for statistical  analysis as ou tlined in the original grant application and study protocol.

6.[ADDRESS_1250194] established relationships with medical residents, 
fellows, physicians, and staff in various medical specialties (orthopaedics, vascula r, podiatry, 
rehab, wound/skin) who have conta ct with potential participants. These personnel will refer 
patients to the study coordinator for evaluation of eligibility. Coordinators will also screen 
medical records of individuals receiving amputation in t he [ADDRESS_1250195] the screening interview, which includes a series of 
questions to confirm eligibility (screening questions), a description of the study, its importance in 
amputee patient care, the responsibilities of participating in the stud y, and the potential risks 
and benefits of participating. Upon patient agreement, the study coordinator will initiate the 
informed consent process and inform the patient of the timeline for completing the baseline 
questionnaire, and assign the patient a un ique study ID.  
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 21 of 54 
 Once 8±2 participants are enrolled or nearly enrolled at each site, study coordinators will 
schedule appointments to complete the baseline assessment, either in person or by [CONTACT_648]. 
Data are collected via electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF). Individual or groups of participants 
may attend an in -person appointment with the study coordinator either in a private room in the 
Clinical Research Unit or office, or in the VA library or computer lab. Participants will use 
computers to complete the eCRF s and study coordinators are available to help guide 
participants and answer any questions.  
Enrolled participants are assigned on a rolling basis into successive cohorts of 8 ±2 individuals 
at each participating site. Each time 8±2 participants are enrolle d, that cohort will be randomized 
1:1 to receive either the VETPALS intervention or individual education  support program  (control 
condition). We will ensure that participants will not have completed a PALS program prior to 
study participation and will not be part of an existing PALS group during their study participation. 
Randomization will occur through  an email exchange between the study sites (VETPALS 
facilitator or site PI) and the data manager at Spectrum Research. The data manager will 
maintain a rand omization table that is stored locally on a server at Spectrum Research.  When a 
cohort is ready for randomization, the facilitator or site PI [INVESTIGATOR_892553] a group of participants is ready for randomization. The email will also include a list of 
study ID numbers but will not contain any information that could identify participants. Within [ADDRESS_1250196] of study IDs in the database 
to ensure all baseline assessm ents are complete, and then will obtain random assignment by 
[CONTACT_892603]. The data manager will respond via email to the facilitator or 
site PI [CONTACT_4490] a value of 0 or 1 (0=individual education support program, 1=VETPALS). Both 
parties w ill retain a copy of the email for reference. The data manager will record the treatment 
assignment for the group in the randomization table, and the facilitator or site PI [INVESTIGATOR_892554]. This method will ens ure that treatment allocation 
is concealed during the recruitment of each cohort. A balanced number of groups will be 
randomly assigned to each site based on the projected enrollment at that site, which is a 
common randomization schedule used in group -base d interventions. The randomization 
schedule and algorithm will not be shared with local sites to maintain concealment of treatment 
allocation. Additionally, the data manager will record a value of 0 or 1 to each study ID in the 
database which  is linked to the study ID assigned at enrollment. Clinical research staff at each 
location (applicable investigators and VET PALS f acilitators) will receive the treatment allocation 
and randomization ID in order to proceed with the treatment , intervention or control. Si te study 
coordinators who conduct the baseline and follow -up assessments are blind to treatment.  
Additionally, each VA site will partner with another VA site treating Veteran amputee patients. 
Providers at the partner sites (e.g. Seattle partners with Tuc son) will introduce the study to 
potentially eligible patients. Providers will give interested patients a study brochure so that 
patients can contact [CONTACT_892604]. Patients will be screened via telephone script 
and those interested and eli gible in participating will be consented by [CONTACT_645153]. 
Coordinators will mail a research study consent form using a USPS tracking number, establish 
telephone contact [CONTACT_892605], 
and pro vide a postage -paid envelope for the patient to return the consent form. Patients 
participating in this study at partner sites will participate in the study via telephone assessments

group can participate via telehealth (video teleconferencing). Similarly, patients randomized to 
the control group are contact[CONTACT_892606] -amputation education materials 
by [CONTACT_2319]. Providers at the partner sites a ssist with scheduling the  VETPALS classes as usual 
clinical care appointments, but are not involved in interacting with the participant for research 
purposes.   
Cohorts allocated to the intervention will work with the VETPALS facilitator and 5 clinical 
appo intments will be created in the participant’s medical record. Participants may receive 
reminder phone calls prior to each scheduled session. As in the original PALS intervention, 
participants will be encouraged to become members of the Amputee Coalition (f ree of charge) 
which allows access to publications and educational materials. Participants also receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_892555], along with a VETPALS participant 
workbook. The VETPALS workbook is a modified version o f the original PALS workbook. The 
PALS workbook is publicly available by [CONTACT_892607]. The 
VETPALS workbook has been condensed as the original PALS program was 10 weeks, and 
VETPALS is 5 weeks. The VETPALS intervention o ccurs over 5 sessions and is co -led by [CONTACT_892608] (facilitator) and a peer who is an amputee. At all sites, the VETPALS 
facilitator is the Amputation Rehabilitation Coordinator (ARC) of each facility and are licensed 
physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437],  with advanced DOD training and certification in amputation care.  
Additionally, one of the sites has a second facilitator who is a Clinical Health Psychologist with a 
focus in physical medicine and rehabilitation.  Other research staff who are trained in VE TPALS 
(e.g. Site PIs, Co -Is) who are trained in the VETPALS intervention may lead sessions in the 
event of a facilitator absence. Upon completion of the study protocol, all Veterans in the 
VETPALS program will be offered the individual education support pr ogram .

The cohorts assigned to t he individual education support program  (control) will be informed of 
their treatment group by [CONTACT_892609]. Participants will 
have access to all of the medical and rehabilitation services they would typi[INVESTIGATOR_892556] (e.g. post -surgical follow -up, medical stabilization and wound 
healing, rehab for functional independence, prosthetic fit, gait training). This includes other VA 
Amputation System of Care resources such as caregiver  and amputee support group. 
Participants will not receive the VETPALS  or original PALS  intervention during their time in the 
study. To enhance usual care and encourage study participation, participants in the control 
condition will be systematically contac ted by a clinical member of the research team and 
provided with post -amputation education materials . We will use  one or more of the following:  
First Step – A Guide for Adapting to Limb Loss and SideStep – A Guide to Preventing and 
Managing Diabetes and Its  Complications  published by [CONTACT_892610] – The Rehabilitation Journey After Lower Limb Amputation , a VA /DOD publication.  
Participants will receive a subsequent call confirming receipt of the patient education materials, 
and inqui ring about questions associated with the information. Individuals who express an 
interest in additional information will be referred to their amputation care team for appropriate 
follow -up. All contact [CONTACT_892611]. Upon 
completion of the study protocol, all Veterans in the individual education support program  will be 
offered the VETPALS  program .  
Participants will complete follow -up assessments with study coordinators in -person or by 
[CONTACT_1381] [ADDRESS_1250197] until all follow -ups are complete at 
the end of the study  in order remain blind to i ntervention assignment .  
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 24 of 54 
 Additional details of the assessments and a study flow sheet can be found in the protocol 
document. Participants will receive reminders via telephone and mail for upcoming study visits 
from the study coordinator. The baseline asses sment will take up to 60 minutes to complete and 
follow -up assessments will take up to 30 minutes to complete. Study coordinators remain 
blinded to treatment condition  throughout the entire study  and will be trained to ensure 
consistent and optimal adminis tration of the assessments, as well as on strategies to remain 
blinded from treatment (e.g. strategies to remind patients not to reveal treatment).  
Randomization  
As described on page 2 1, this is a two-arm randomized controlled trial . The treatment allocat ion 
will automatically be matched to the study ID in the online randomization system. Clinical 
resear ch staff at each location (site PIs and VETPALS  facilitators) will receive the treatment 
allocation and proceed with study related activities  for both cond itions. Again, site s tudy 
coordinators who conduct the baseline and follow -up assessments are blind to treatment.  
This online randomization system  (maintained by [CONTACT_892612])  will have layers of 
security, including a requirement for a username [CONTACT_892647], as well as the highest level of encryption of user information and 
storage into a secure SQL -based database. The system will maintain a log of all coordinators or 
study personnel (who hav e privileges) who have logged in with a time stamp. Data will be 
maintained in such a way that reports can be produced routinely that allow the investigators to 
review the treatment allocations per site. Each Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_523432] a separate 
randomiza tion log and patient selection log by [CONTACT_40337].

Potential Risk/Benefit Analysis  
Risks to all participants:  This project poses minimal risks to participants. Participants may find 
it inconveni ent to schedule and attend appointments for the baseline, [ADDRESS_1250198] access  to the other program 
once they complete the program that they are randomized to, including the follow -up 
assessments . The questionnaires also ask sensitive questions about physical a nd emotional 
health. Participants may be uncomfortable answering some questions. During the consent 
process and  before each interview, participants are reminded that they can pass on any 
questions they do not comfortable answering. There is a risk of loss of confidentiality; although 
we make every effort to keep research information safe and secure, no system for protecting 
information can be completely secure. Finally, the study may have risks that are currently 
unforeseeable, but we will contact [CONTACT_892613] a risk.  
Additional risks to participants in the intervention condition : Participants may find it 
inconvenient to attend the VETPALS intervention sessions as the first session is 4 hours, and 
remaining sessions 2 -5 are a ll 2 hours in length. Participants may also feel shy and/or Baseline Assessment

 uncomfortable when participating in group discussion and other activities during the intervention 
sessions.  
Risks to participants in the control condition : Participants in the control group may f eel 
some discomfort or sadness about being randomized to the control/ individual education support 
program . Participants may also feel some discomfort, sadness, or anxiety when reading post -
amputation education materials, or when receiving a phone call from  a researcher/clinician to 
confirm receipt of the materials and inquire about further questions. All Veterans in the control 
condition  are offered the VETPALS intervention upon completion of the study protocol. This 
ethically ensures that study participati on does not deprive Veterans of a potentially valuable 
service.  
Anticipated b enefits to society:   
The VETPALS intervention is a potentially valuable health care service. This project is important 
to test the hypothesis that a group -based self -management i ntervention provides benefits above 
and beyond exposure to usual care and supplemental information alone in the five areas of: 
knowledge, problem solving, self -monitoring, behavioral goal setting, and skill acquisition. This 
study represents one of the onl y prospective randomized controlled trials of a behavioral 
intervention for individuals with limb loss. At the completion of the study, it is expected that the 
results will be used to inform the integration of self -management interventions into the VA 
Ampu tation System of Care.  
Anticipated b enefits to participants:  
Previous research showed that the original PALS intervention improved physical and 
psychosocial functioning when delivered in existing community -based support groups for 
amputees. Other benefits  of PALS include decreased isolation, greater optimism, improved 
knowledge of treatment and copi[INVESTIGATOR_892557], perceived copi[INVESTIGATOR_170301], and functional social 
support. The PALS intervention was well tolerated in previous studies as indicated by a 90% or 
great er retention rate. VETPALS is an adaption of this empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675] -supported self -management 
program.  
Activities to minimize risk: Only the IRB -approved research staff will have access to research 
records. Patients screened for the study will be assigned a uniq ue screening ID code, which will 
be link ed to the last initial and full SSN (CPRS medical record). This log will be stored in a 
password -protected Excel file, on a secure VA network drive, in a restricted -access folder, 
behind the VA firewall that only the  research staff has access to.  
With respect to privacy and confidentiality, all enrolled participants will be assigned a unique 
study ID . All research data (which does not contain any PHI) will be stored entirely separate 
from research materials that cont ain PHI, such as a consent form, contact [CONTACT_26500], and consent 
enrollment log. The crosswalk document, which links the study ID to the patient’s identity, will be 
maintained also in a password -protected Excel file, on a secure VA network drive, in a 
restricted -access folder, behind the VA firewall that only the research staff has access to.  
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1250199], it will better accommodate the expected low -base rate of 
problems and allow for the early identification of issues th an would a DSMB that met at an 
arbitrary regular interval.  
5.2 Recruitment Methods  
Up to 750  participants across all sites  (including partner telehealth sites)  will be 
recruited and enrolled in the project. The study has an overall final enrollment goal o f

recruitment plan ensures that we will be able to successfully identify patients in this specialized 
population, and that the on ly excluded patients are those that are clinically ineligible for this 
study.

VA patients who recently had an amputation or are scheduled for an amputation are identified 
on an ongoing basis using compu terized cli nic lists from CPRS . Study coordinators may also 
receive alerts from ICD -[ADDRESS_1250200] following the clinic appointme nt, either in person or by [CONTACT_756]. 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1250201] represent the 
self-management program as it is available to participants in the VetPals study. If the study 
coordinator is unable to attend the clinic appointment, providers can give the patient a brochure 
and a short  recruitment video (e.g. CD, DVD, or link to video) with an overview of the study and 
a telephone number to call if interested or for questions. Additionally, the study coordinator may 
mail an approach letter , and when possible, a short recruitment video to potential participants 
who cannot be approached in clinic . Upon receipt of the approach letter, patients can call to opt -
in or opt -out of the study. As stated in the approach letter, we will call patients who did not 
respond to the approach letter within  approximately one week to determine interest and 
eligibility.  
 
Study coordinators  also screen surgery schedules from orthopaedics, vascular, and podiatry, 
and will screen  medical records of anyone scheduled for an eligible surgical procedure. Study 
coordi nators will then monitor the patient’s progress and look for an upcoming clinic 
appointment to establish initial contact [CONTACT_892615].  
 
Providers from the multi -disciplinary PAVE Program (Prevention of Amputations  in Veterans 
Everywhere) also identify potentially eligible patients through inpatient rounds and outpatient 
clinic appointments. The PAVE team includes providers from many service lines (orthopaedics, 
vascular, podiatry, skin/wound, physical therapy, reha bilitation medicine, prosthetics, 
rehabilitation psychology). Study coordinators screen medical records of patients referred by 
[CONTACT_892616] a clinic appointment to establish initial contact, 
or will send an approach l etter. Patients who previously agreed to be contact[CONTACT_892617].  
 
The study team also uses VA administrative data from the VHA Support Service Center (VSSC) 
to identify Veterans who recently had an  amputation. VSSC data contains names and last [ADDRESS_1250202] for 
provider referrals from partner telehealth sites. Study coordinators use a phone script to 
introduce the study, verify basic criteria, and if eligible, proceed with the formal screening 
questions.  
 
Study coordin ators use a screening case report form (CRF) to verify inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, and obtain basic demographics. The screening CRF also contains the Short Portable 
Mental Status Questionnaire42 (SPMSQ) , a brief test to determine inadequate cognitive or 
language function to consent or participate in the study. The screening CRF may originally be 
completed on a paper CRF, but later entered using an electronic CRF (eCRF), which is linked to 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1250203] is not possible. The study brochure , and when 
possible a short recruitment video , are also used when participants may be interested, but not 
necessarily ready for screening and consent . See Appendix A.  
 
Participant Payments  
Enrolled participants are eligible to receive up to $60 for study participation. Payments for the 
study are submitted by [CONTACT_892618] 10 -1078. Payment slips are routed 
through the fiscal offi ce at each institution in order to issue payment by [CONTACT_9434]/mail. Participants 
can request cash payment if an appointment is scheduled in advance for the coordinator to 
obtain necessary signatures on VA Form 10 -1078. Cash payments require participants to tak e a 
payment slip and photo ID to the agent cashier at each VA Medical Center.  
 
Participants are paid according to the payment schedule below. Payments are submitted (if by 
[CONTACT_9434]/mail) or issued (if cash) following the completion of each study visit. If a participant 
withdraws or misses a study visit, they are compensated only for the visit completed.  
 Baseline: $ 20 
 6 week follow -up: $20  
 6 month follow -up: $ 20  
Participants are informed during the informed consent process that payments will take up to 8 
weeks to receive a check by [CONTACT_2319], and that cash payment on the day of the study is possible but 
may not always be available as it is reliant on advance scheduling and several signatures. 
Study staff will ensure that payments are submitted in a timely manne r (within one week of 
participants completing a study visit).  
 
Participants in the intervention group are eligible to receive travel pay for attending intervention 
sessions in accordance with the amount they receive for usual care clinic visits. Participa nts in 
the intervention group are scheduled to attend five in-person sessions, which are scheduled as 
usual clinical care visits. Participants are compensated travel pay for this usual clinical care visit 
even though the intervention is part of the researc h study. Participants in the control condition 
may also have usual care clinical visits during the time period when they are participating in this 
study. Any clinical visits associated with the control condition are eligible for travel pay in 
accordance wi th the Veteran participant’s usual care travel pay amount. It is the responsibility of 
participants to claim travel pay for these visits, not the responsibility of the study staff.  
5.[ADDRESS_1250204]  a waiver of informed con sent for screening and recruitment purposes so that 
participants can be screened without requiring completion of a full informed consent. The waiver 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1250205] the participant’s privacy. The consent 
form clearly states that participation in this study is voluntary, and potential partic ipants can 
decline participation at any time. Potential participants are also informed their participation is 
voluntary during the recruitment process.  No attempt will be made to persuade patients who 
decline participation. Potential participants will also  be asked if they need some time to consider 
their involvement before providing consent, and they will be given the opportunity to ask any 
and all questions related to the study before consenting. In the event the patient does not have 
an appointment at th e VA, or cannot set up an appointment to come to the VA, the study 
coordinator will initiate the informed consent process by [CONTACT_756]/mail. Coordinators will mail a 
consent form using a USPS tracking number, establish telephone contact [CONTACT_892619], and provide a postage -paid envelope 
for the patient to return the consent form. All study sites are Regional Amputation Centers and 
provide amputation -related care for participants from an expansive ge ographic area. The 
telephone/mail consent process will be used as appropriate to avoid  unnecessary travel or 
inconvenience for patients for the consent process. The telephone/mail consent process will 
also be used in the event a participant is screened in person but requires additional time to 
consider study participation.  
 
The study  coordinators at each site will conduct the informed consent process, rather than the 
study PI/LSI, so that the participants do not feel obligated to participate.  Alternatively , in the 
event the study coordinator is not available to obtain informed consent, another IRB -approved 
investigator designated by [CONTACT_978]/LSI may obtain consent.  Finally, we will tell all potential 
participates that their decision about participation will n ot affect their clinical care in any way. 
See Appendix B.  
 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 31 of 54 
 The PI/SC and LSIs are responsible for training all applicable study staff at participating sites 
how to conduct the informed consent process. The PI/SC will hold pre -study training conference 
calls, which will cover the informed consent process. LSIs are also ensuring that site study 
coordinators receive additional training as necessary. Additionally, study  staff will participate in 
ongoing monthly conference calls to discuss recruitment, enrollme nt, and retention and the 
consent process will be reviewed during these monthly meetings. Prior to the start of 
recruitment, Seattle will host a kick -off meeting for LSIs, VETPALS facilitators, and study 
coordinators. The consent process will be reviewed a nd practiced during this meeting.  
Site coordinators will use the following guidelines for the consent process by [CONTACT_756]/mail. 
This guidance was provided by [CONTACT_892620], 
VAPSHCS.  
1. For studies that allow for con sent to be obtained over the telephone, study staff will mail 
the Veteran, at the last known residential mailing address, a copy of the following 
documents:  
Informed Consent Form  
HIPAA Authorization Form  
VA Form 10 -3203  
Note: Mail the above forms with a  stamped, returned, addressed, VA envelope. It is 
helpful to add stickers or highlighting to indicate where to sign and date.  
2. The study coordinator (SC) will call the Veteran to verify the receipt of the forms.  
3. The SC will determine if there is sufficient  time to explain and review the study details 
and forms received. If not, the SC will make a telephone call appointment to consent the 
Veteran.  
4. The SC consents the Veteran to the study.  
5. The SC will explain the study details to the Veteran and what it mea ns for the Veteran to 
consent to participate in the study.  
6. The SC will ensure the Veteran has plenty of time to consider study participation and a 
chance to talk it over with family and friends, if necessary.  
7. The SC will direct the Veteran to sign and dat e all the forms where indicated.  
8. The SC will advise the Veteran to mail the signed, dated and completed forms back to 
the study team in the VA envelope that was provided.  
9. A member of the study team will call the Veteran to verify receipt of the forms.  
10. The SC will sign and date all the forms.  
11. The SC will mail a copy of all the forms to the Veteran or the Veteran will receive the 
signed copy if he/she has an upcoming appointment.  
5.4 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Inclusion criteria are intended to allow max imum inclusion of the majority of Veterans 
undergoing any new lower extremity amputation within 2 years prior to study enrollment . At the 
same time, it will allow for shared experience of managing the medical comorbidities that 
contributed to limb loss. Al lowing multiple levels of amputation, as well as revisions, creates a 
study population that approximates the case mix of the VA Amputation System of Care and 
improves the generalizability of findings.  
Inclusion criteria:  
1. Ages 18 and older.  
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 32 of 54 
 2. Transfemoral (ab ove-knee), transtibial (below -knee), knee disarticulation (through -knee), 
Syme’s/ankle disarticulation (through -ankle), and transmetatarsal amputation (through -
foot, includes Chopart amputation and Lisfranc amputation) due to dysvascular 
disease/diabetes. Can include a revision of an amputation.  Revision amputation is a soft 
tissue revision with bone shortening at the same or higher level.  
3. Participant has a contact [CONTACT_892621] s/he can be reached during 
the course of the study *. 
4. Enroll ed within 2 years  of amputation.  
5. Speak and comprehend English.  
*We will ask a participant who do not meet eligibility criteria because of inclusion criteria item 3 if s/he will have one in 
the near future, and if yes, permission to contact [CONTACT_892622]. This allows the participant to be included, if 
interested and eligible, at a later date.  
 
Exclusion criteria are intended to screen out a small number of individuals who would likely not 
benefit from participation in a group -based psychosocial inte rvention. Similar criteria are 
routinely used in the course of clinical care outside of the context of research study, and as a 
result are not thought to pose a significant threat to generalizability.  
Exclusion criteria:  
1. Inadequate cognitive or language f unction to consent or participate defined by ≥ 6 errors 
on the SPMSQ  or diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease.  
2. Active substance use disorder identified by [CONTACT_892623]. Note: No 
personnel involved in the study may identify, di rectly or indirectly, any individual patient 
or subject in any report of such research or otherwise disclose patient or subject 
identifies in any manner.  
3. Major uncontrolled psychiatric illness (bipolar disorder, psychosis, severe suicidality) 
identified by  [CONTACT_892624].  
4. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828]  
5.[ADDRESS_1250206] to determine inadequate cogni tive or 
language function to consent or participate in the study. This is a 10 item questionnaire where a 
score of 5/10 or more is require d to participate in the study. The screen also confirms eligibility 
by a series of inclusion/exclusion criteria, colle cts basic demographic information (age, gender, 
race, ethnicity, primary or telehealth site participant, and approximate driving distance from the 
study site), and documents informed consent for eligible patients who deci de to participate in 
the study. Stu dy coordinators may answer record screening answers initially on a paper CRF, 
but all screening CRF data will be transferred to the study database using the eCRF. Study 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1250207] the interview if the patient does not wish to use the 
computer. All data are collected using EDC (no paper baseline CRFs) on VA approved and 
secure laptop and desktop computers. The baseline assessment takes up to one hour to 
complete.  
 
During the clinical interview , the site study coordinator will collect medical information including 
amputation date (translated to time in days since original amputation) , location, type (initial or 
revision), and level (e.g. transmetatarsal, transtibial, transfemoral) . Although this information 
was verified and collected during screening, more detailed information , including time (in days) 
since original date of surgery , is recorded during the baseline assessment.  
 
During the baseline medical record review  we will use the Functional Comorbidity Index (FCI), 
amputation level, previous amputations, and contralateral  limb assessment questions. Data will 
be recorded on eCRFs . A list of the measures used at baseline and follow -up are found in the 
assessment  measures section and in Table 2.  
Randomization  
Participants will be randomized to a treatment group ( group -based p rogram/intervention  vs. 
individual education program/control ) following completion of the baseline assessment (see 5.1 
Study Design). The site study coordinators will be naïve to treatment allocation throughout all of 
the assessments to minimize potential bias of the outcomes.  
Group based self -management program ( VETPALS Intervention)   
Participants randomized to the intervention group will be asked to complete a checklist about 
their use of supplementary class resources, a checklist about their satisfactio n with the classes, 
and selected participants will be invited to participate in a focus group to respond to and discuss 
implementation variables.  The site PIs and VETPALS facilitator have primary responsibility in 
overseeing data collection on paper forms.  Data will be entered into the central study database 
by [CONTACT_892625]/or VETPALS facilitator via eCRF. In the event a participant doesn’t receive 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1250208] (yes/no) patients who elect to p articipate in the 
individual program  and will refer patients to the facilitator who will discuss the other program and 
scheduling in more detail .  
We will use a digital voice recorder  to audio -record the VETPALS sessions. The purpose of 
audio -recording the  VETPALS sessions is to monitor treatment fidelity, assess feedback, and 
ensure protocol adherence. Each participating site will consult with the local R&D office to 
ensure that the digital audio -recorder meets local VA guidelines, and all recorders will u se FIPS 
140-2 validated encryption. Sites will use the device(s) listed in the local site Central IRB 
applications.  
Individual education support program  (Control )  
Participants randomized to the control group will not have any additional assessments or 
evaluations to complete. In the event a participant doesn’t receive any necessary materials 
during the individual education support program, a facilitator will mail materials to the participant 
and will include a return postage -paid addressed envelope if nee ded. Participants in the control 
group are offered the VETPALS intervention classes at the end of their [ADDRESS_1250209] (yes/no) patients who elect to participate in the 
intervention classes  and will refer patie nts to the facilitator who will discuss the other program 
and scheduling in more detail .  
Patients who are randomized but unable to begin VETPALS or the Individual Education 
Support Program  
In the event a participant is randomized but cannot begin partici pating in the assigned 
intervention, the participant will be given several options. There may be unexpected 
circumstances (e.g. personal or family illness, change in job status, personal situation) that may 
prevent a participant from starting the assigned intervention with their cohort as originally 
planned. VETPALS facilitators will discuss options with the participant.   
1. The participant can be included in the same randomized intervention at a later date. The 
facilitator will wait for the next cohort that is assigned the same intervention and will 
contact [CONTACT_892626].  
2. If the participant agrees to be included in the next cohort, the facilitator will notify the 
study coordinator of this change so the  study coordinator can include the  participant in 
all subsequent follow -up assessments.  The facilitator will only share the participant’s 
study ID number so the coordinator remains blinded to treatment.  
3. Participants may be asked to complete a second basel ine assessment with the study 
coordinator. This will be assessed on an individual participant basis and site 
investigators and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_892558] a second baseline 
should be completed. Collecting the baseline data again prior  to starting the intervention 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1250210] current  responses. Participants  who 
complete a second baseline  will receive $[ADDRESS_1250211] a  brief medical  review at scheduled assessments (baseline, 
6 weeks, and 6 months) and at [ADDRESS_1250212] any anticipated adverse events, including 
complications such as stump non -healing, revision amputation,  contralat eral amputation, and 
mortality. For individuals who undergo a revision or new amputation, we will calculate the time in 
days since the qualifying event (original amputation). See 6.[ADDRESS_1250213] review allows study coordinators to also check for any 
UAE or SAEs. All data are collected on an eCRF using the EDC system.  
Complications  and anticipated AEs  include stump non -healing, revision to same or higher level, 
contralateral amputation, and mortality . These will be monitored and collected during the 
subjects' hospi[INVESTIGATOR_892559]’s medical 
record at designated intervals and during formal follow -up interviews at 6 weeks and 6 months.  
Follow -up  
All participants will complete follow -up assessments at approximately 6  weeks after 
randomization (coinciding with the end of the intervention sessions) and at [ADDRESS_1250214] of the measures use d at baseline  and follow -up are found in the 
assessment  measures section and in Table 2.  
Temporary changes: Baseline, periodic medical record review, and follow -up  
In the event a site study coordinator is unavailable (e.g. planned absence)  the site study  
coordinator and/or project coordinator  from the lead site (VA Puget Sound Health Care System, 
Seattle, WA) may conduct baseline, medical record review, and follow -up assessments by 
[CONTACT_756]. Site study staff will inform participants of this temporary cha nge by [CONTACT_892627] a letter that explains the site study coordinator ’s absence. Participant  study ID 
number, name, and phone number will be shared with the Seattle site study coordinator and /or 
project coordinator. Local site staff will cont act Seattle staff by [CONTACT_892628] -encrypted email 
to share this information. All information from other sites will be stored in accordance with this 
study protocol. See section 7.0 Privacy and Confidentiality for more details.  
Participant Assessment Measures  
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 36 of 54 
 All data are collected using EDC. Measures are displayed on a computer screen and site study 
coordinators and/or participants respond using VA approved and secure computers and 
responses are automatically placed in the study database. There are no paper CRFs for 
baseline and follow -up assessments as all questionnaires are displayed on eCRFs. In the event 
of a technical problem, data will be recorded on paper CRFs and transferred to an eCRF. The 
coordinator will use a secure shredding bin to discard the paper CRF the eCRF is complete. A 
description of each measure used is below, followed by [CONTACT_50489] 2, which displays a summary of 
the baseline and follow -up assessments.  
 
Primary Outcomes  
Physical functioning  will be measured using the Musculoskeletal Fun ction Assessment Short 
Form (MFA -SF). The MFA -SF is a [ADDRESS_1250215] range of musculoskeletal disorders . Participants are asked to rate difficulties 
associated with daily activities ranging from " not at all difficult" to "unable to do," as well as the 
frequency of problems, ranging from "none of the time" to "all of the time."   Responses are 
combined into a single physical functioning score . Twelve of the items constitute a separate 
subscale exami ning how much individuals are bothered by [CONTACT_892629] . This scale will also 
be computed, but is not the primary outcome . The MFA -SF has been utilized extensively in 
research,43 and has established validity, reliability.44  
Psychosocial functioning  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_892630]  (PHQ -9). The PHQ -[ADDRESS_1250216] 2 
weeks, ranging from 0 = “not at all” to 3 = “nearly every day” . The PHQ -[ADDRESS_1250217] item on the PHQ asks “Over the last [ADDRESS_1250218] you been bothered by 
[CONTACT_33687]?...Thoughts that you would be better off dead, or of hurting 
yourself in some way?”. Responses range from 0 -3 where 0 (not at all), 1 (several days), 2 
(more tha n half the days), 3 (nearly every day). For participants who respond >0, the study 
coordinator will refer to the  Suicide Risk Reduction Protocol  (Appendix D). This plan reflects the 
importance of activating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_892560].  
Secondary Outcomes  
Quality of Life  will be measured using the brief form of the World Health Organization Quality of 
Life Scale (WHOQOL -BREF) . The WHOQOL -BREF is composed of 26 items examining the 
domains of physical health, psychological health , social relationships, and environment . 
WHOQOL -BREF  has demonstrated  discriminant validity, content validity, internal consistency 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1250219] reliability.48 and has been utilized extensively in medical, rehabilitation and 
general population settings.49  In this study , we will focus on the two global items, "How would 
you rate your quality of life?" with response items ranging from "very poor" to "very good" and 
"How satisfied are you with your health?" with responses ranging from "very dissatisfied" to 
"very satisfied."   
Positive Affect  will be measured using  the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).50  
The PANAS consists of adjectives rated from 1 (very slightly/not at all) to 5 (extremely) that 
measure positive feelings such as joy, pleasure a nd negative feelings such as anxiety or 
sadness . For the current study, only the [ADDRESS_1250220] validity established in large 
normative samples.51  
Intermed iate Outcomes  
Self-Efficacy  for managing limb loss will be measured using the modified Self -Efficacy scale 
(MSES) . The MSES is a 22 -item questionnaire designed to measure patients' perceived self -
efficacy to cope with the consequences of chronic disease wi th 3 subscales: self -efficacy for 
pain management, self -efficacy for copi[INVESTIGATOR_406624], and self -efficacy for physical 
function.52  Each item is presented as a question (e.g. How certain are you that you can keep 
your amputation from interfering with the  things you want to do?).  Respondents rate each belief 
on a [ADDRESS_1250221] been established .  
Patient Activation  will be measured by [CONTACT_33745] (PAM) . The PAM is a 13 -
item survey tool designed to assess a person’s engagement  in care, confidence in the ability to 
understand and act up on health challenges, commitment  to making neede d lifestyle changes, 
and efforts  to sustain those changes over time .53  Resp onse options for the 13 PAM questions 
use a Likert -type agreement scale with 4 response options. The options are strongly disagree 
(1), disagree , agree (3), strongly agree (4), and N/A. The raw score is calculated by [CONTACT_892631] 13 ques tions . The measure has shown good internal consistency and 
validity in both convenience and large national probability samples.54  
Problem Solving  will be measured  using the 10-item version of the Social Problem -Solving 
Inventory -Revised (SPSI -R).55 This sca le assesses two adaptive problem -solving dimensions 
(positive problem orientation and rational problem -solving) and three dysfunctional dimensions 
(negative problem orientation, impulsive/careless style, and avoidance style).55 Items on the 
SPSI -R are rate d on a five -point Likert -type scale (0, not at all true of me, to 4, extremely true of 
me) and summed to produce a single total score from [ADDRESS_1250222] been established in the literature as correlates of one or both of 
our primary outcomes . They will be collected primarily to demonstrate the comparability at 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 38 of 54 
 baseline of the in tervention and control conditions.  In instances where randomization does not 
achieve comparability, outcome analyses will include them as covariates.  
Comorbidit y will be assessed primarily using the Functional Comorbidty Index (FCI).[ADDRESS_1250223] a 
limited number of pre -operative co -morbidity factors and concomitant diseases particularly 
relevant to amputation outcome (e.g., currently on dialysis - yes/no) from patient interview.  
Pain will be measured using questions from the Chro nic Pain Grade (CPG) questionnaire.[ADDRESS_1250224] conforms to established guidelines.59  The 
CPG itself was designed for interview -based studies due to its relatively simple and brief format . 
The instrument has good internal consistency and reliability.58   
Complications  include stump non -healing, revision to same or higher level, contralateral 
amputation, and mortality . These will be monitored and collected during the subjects' hospi[INVESTIGATOR_892561]’s medical record every three 
months as  well as during formal follow -up interview at 6 months.  
Social support  will be assessed using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support 
(MSPSS) ,60 a 12 -item self -report measure of perceived social support from  three specific 
sources: family, fr iends, and significant other. For each item, participants are asked to rate their 
degree of agreement on a [ADDRESS_1250225] stability over two - to three -month i ntervals .60  
Cognitive functioning  will be evaluated using three brief tests from several well esta blished 
neuropsychological instruments  including: (1) The List Learning and List Recall Subscales of the 
Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsycho logical Status (RBANS) ; (2) the 
Controlled Oral Word Associati on Test (COWAT); and (3 ) the Digit Span subtest of the 
Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale – 3rd Edition (WAIS -III). All of the selected instruments have 
sound psychometric properties and extensiv e data are ava ilable on their reliability, validity , and 
population norms .[ADDRESS_1250226] mild to moderate cognitive deficits, 
but also  able to differentiate lower levels of cognitive performance without pronounced floor 
effects . It was specifically designed for use with older adults and for individuals in medical 
settings . The WAIS -III is the industry “gold standard” in telligence test . We propose to use only a 
single subtest, Digit Span, which includes two parts: Digits Forward and Digits Backwards. Both 
are tests of attention and working memory . Finally, the COWAT is a test of phonemic verbal 
fluency. It reflects abilities in a number of  areas, including executive functioning . The norms for 
these neuropsycholo gical tests are based on protocols that are designed to ensure 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1250227] (AUDIT -C). This 
three -item measure queries individuals about the  quantity and frequency of use as well as binge 
drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_892562] a screening tool for identifying use 
disorders in medical  populations .[ADDRESS_1250228] questions addressing quantit y, frequency, 
and recency of smoking established by [CONTACT_892632], Outcomes, and Economic 
Research  (CHQOER)  for the VA administered as part of a large health survey of V eteran health 
behaviors.  
Internal Study Evaluations/ Process Measures  
Treatment engagement and adherence  will be assessed using the Psychosocial Treatment 
Compliance Scale  (PTCS).[ADDRESS_1250229] broader applicability to other populations . 
The scale is comprised of two subscales  (participation and attendance ). Sample items 
(paraphrased) include  “was able to remember the contents /skills taught in previous sessions”, 
“was attentive in treatment” . The scale has  excellent internal consistency and construct 
validity .41  
Actual versus planned intervention participation in the VA context  will be assessed by [CONTACT_892633]. VETPALS facilitators will 
maintain a weekly log documenting attendance and modality of participation (in -person or 
telehealth), tardiness or early departures from each session, and completion of homework 
assignments. These two methods, along with the PTCS, will allow investigators to examine 
differences in participation by [CONTACT_892594], understand retention, and quantify treatment 
exposure.  
Use of supplementary resources  will be assessed for both the i ntervention and control 
conditions by [CONTACT_17801] a brief survey coinciding with the end of the intervention sessions. 
The survey measures the use of supplementary project resources, including the recommended 
websites and participation in concurrent ther apeutic/clinical activities (e.g. therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], locally 
available programs such as peer visits, Amputee Support Group, and Amputee Coalition 
resources). This brief survey also will assess several potential factors in engagement, including 
perceived credibilit y of the treatment and perceived self -reported engagement in the treatment.  
We will formally assess treatment satisfaction  using a pencil and paper satisfaction measure 
used in the original PALS program. The VETPALS facilitator will not directly administer  or collect 
the satisfaction measure. The Veteran peer amputee or another designee will collect all paper 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_892563] a sealed envelope. The facilitator will deliver these to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -PI

To describe and understand barriers and facilitators to i mplementation of VETPALS in the VA , 
Investigator study staff (Drs. Turner, Williams, Norvell) will conduct structured interviews with 
the site study coordinators, VETPALS facilitators, and peer facilitators at the study conclusion. 
These interviews will as sess the time commitment required to lead each group, the 
administrative procedures used, and any local clinical or organizational factors that facilitated or 
hindered recruitment, scheduling, retention, or delivery of the intervention.  
Focus Groups  
To be tter understand any barriers and facilitators to implementation from the Veteran’s 
perspective, we will conduct 2 -4 focus groups in the final year of the study  (additional details in 
3.0 Objectives) . Focus groups will be facilitated by [CONTACT_10670] -level s tudy staff using guided 
questions to ascertain treatment, psychological, and organizational and logistical factors that 
may have affected participation.  
Staff Research Interviews  
To better understand any barriers and facilitators to implementation from t he research staff 
perspective, we will conduct individual interviews with site study coordinators and VET PALS 
facilitators. Investigator -level study staff (Drs. Turner, Williams, and Norvell) will conduct 
structured interviews with these staff to assess ti me commitment required to lead each group, 
administrative procedures used, and any local clinical or organizational factors that facilitated or 
hindered recruitment, scheduling, retention, or delivery of the educational programs.

 5.6 Data Analysis   
Data analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_15282] ([CONTACT_892653]) and consultant 
([CONTACT_892649]) with input from investigator -level study staff (Dr s. Turner, Czerniecki, 
Williams, site PIs). Data analysis will occur at Spectrum  Research, Inc. (Tacoma, WA), the 
University of Washington (Seattle, WA) , and Oregon Health & Science University (Portland, 
OR). Data that is off -site at Spectrum Research , University of Washington , and OHSU  for 
analysis will be coded and will not contain any HIPAA identifiers.  See 7.[ADDRESS_1250231] deviations, medians, minimum and maximum will be computed . 
Missing, extreme, and variable distributions will be explored . Missing values  patterns will be 
analyzed .  
Statistical analysis of the primary aims   
For hypotheses 1a and 1b, we will use Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) linear 
regression to investigate mean change over time in MFA -SF. We will model the mean MFA -SF 
change over time as the outcome, using contrasts  D = MFA -SF[Post Intervention] – MFA -
SF[baseline] and D = MFA -SF[6 months] – MFA -SF[baseline] , versus a treatment indicator, T. 
The treatment indicator assigns patients T=1 if they receive the VETPALS intervent ion and T=0 
if they receive enhanced usual care. The GEE model will account for intra -cohort level 
correlation among patients’ measurements. The GEE model will provide valid statistical 
inference if the correlation or variance structure is mis -specified. I t does not require normality of 
model errors. Since the focus of the investigation is to estimate within -patient changes (over 
time) and the outcome are intra -patient level differences, repeated measures correlation is 
appropriately accounted for in the mo del variance estimates. Similarly, we will model the mean 
PHQ -9 change over time as the outcome, using contrasts  D = PHQ -9[Post Intervention] – PHQ -
9[baseline] and D = PHQ -9[6 months] – PHQ -9[baseline] , versus a treatment indicator, T . The 
primary analysis  will be an as -randomized efficacy assessment comparing the self -management 
intervention and individual education  groups for improvements in depression and physical 
functioning . The follow -up assessments of participants who do not complete all self -
managem ent sessions in the intervention condition will still be included with those who complete 
the expected course of treatment. This type of analysis provides a more conservative and 
ecologically valid estimation of treatment effect because it retains all part icipants and does not 
screen out individuals who do not tolerate the intervention . Effect size estimates will be 
obtained . We will assess the randomization assignment by [CONTACT_763400] -level 
characteristics (e.g., age, gender, and amputation level) by t he treatment indicator and adjust 
our models with appropriate covariates as necessary.  
For hypotheses 2a -e, similar to above, we will fit a GEE model to investigate differences in 
mean changes in each outcome variable (VAR). We will model the mean change o ver time as 
the outcome, using contrasts  = VAR [Post Intervention]  – VAR [baseline] and  = VAR [6 months]  – 
VAR [baseline] , versus a treatment indicator, T. The treatment indicator assigns patients T=1 if 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/2012  Page 43 of 54 
 they receive VETPALS and T=[ADDRESS_1250232] size 
estimates will be obtained . Models will be adjusted for covariates as necessary.  
  
For hypothesis 2f, we will produce mean change scores,  = VAR [6 months]  – VAR [baseline] , for 
each outcome measure . We will utilize Pearson product moment correlations to establish 
associations between changes in our intermediate outcomes and changes in our primary 
outcomes . This series of analyses is both sec ondary and exploratory, and is intended to 
produce preliminary data for a future explanatory model hypothesizing that improvements in 
self-efficacy, patient activation, and problem solving represent causal mechanisms of self -
management intervention that in  turn produce improvements in physical and psychosocial 
outcomes .  
Sample  Size Justification   
Enrollment:  Between our  5sites, we antic ipate enrolling approximately [ADDRESS_1250233] o f enrollment and follow -up in previous amputation studies conducted by [CONTACT_892634] . This is a conservative estimate as the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria for this proposal are more lenient than in  our previous studies examining individuals with 
their first, unilateral amputation . Nonetheless we cautiously project enrollment at 55% of [ADDRESS_1250234] to accrue 472 enrollees .  
Retention:  The or iginal PALS self -management study maintained a greater than 90% retention 
rate. Even assuming a more conservative 75% retention rate for the proposed study, 
118participants per year would be expected to participate and successfully reach their final 
follow -up. Over the course of [ADDRESS_1250235] that actual rates of recruitment and 
retention are likely to be higher.  
Each primary site intends to recruit one additional secondary site to partner with each primary 
site (e. g. Seattle partners with Tucson VA). Enrollment, retention, and power analysis sections 
do not reflect these anticipated partners and do not require them. The purpose of including 
additional sites is to extend the recruitment and generalizability of the pr oject aims to integrate 
VETPALS into the VA Amputation System of Care.  
Statistical Power  
Power estimates are based upon the sample size  projections provided in Table 1 below (also in 
5.2 Recruitment Methods) . Effect size estimates were obtained using the estimates provided in 
the original PALS study . We anticipated an enrollment of N=51 cohorts in total for the study and 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1250236] sizes at the se proposed sample size s and 
correlations , we conducted a s eries of Monte Carlo simulation s based on the analytic framework 
outlined above . Each of the pow er calculations were based on 1 ,000 simulated datasets . Power 
was computed  empi[INVESTIGATOR_892567] (from correlated data regression 
estimates from the simulated data sets) that correctly reject ed the null hypothesis of no effect, at 
a five percent a lpha level (T ype I error rate ). 
The results i ndicate that for the modest effect sizes provided, low levels of intra -cohort 
correlation (ICC) and modest Pearson correlation levels between baseline and six -month 
measurements (rho),  we will have adequate  power to detect differences between the study 
conditions . To provide two examples, given these conditions we will have power of greater than 
.[ADDRESS_1250237] differences in the primary outcome physical functioning (MFA -SF) (and the 
additional outcome self -efficacy (MSES) .  
Anticipated Enrollment  
Table 1  (page 25)  indicates anticipated enrollment across all 5 sites throughout the 4 -year study 
period. Projections assume a group enrollment rate of 8±2 participants and completion rate of 6 
participants per group. We estimate a 50% enrollment rate and expect a 75%  retention rate.

 7.0 Reporting   
 
6.1 Adverse Events  
Definitions  
An Adverse Event ( AE) is defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the 
study intervention, which may or may not be related to the intervention.  AEs include any new 
events not present during the pre -intervention period or events that were present during the pre -
intervention period but have increased in seve rity.  
Anticipated AEs  are those that might reasonably be expect ed to occur in this population with 
significant medical comorbidity and can include, but are not necessarily limited to, re -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], revision amputation, conversion to higher -level amp utation, contralateral limb 
amputation, pain, stroke, myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis, dialysis, superficial or 
deep infection, and death. Each site will maintain a log of all anticipated AEs, including those 
captured on eCRFs through medical  record review.  
An unanticipated adverse event (UAE ) is an adverse event that is not expected to occur in 
this population with significant medical comorbidity .  
Unanticipated problems  (UAP) , also the phrase “unanticipated problems involving risks to 
subje cts or others”, in general, include any incident, experience, our outcome that meets all of 
the following:  
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, su ch as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics 
of the subject population being studied;  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research ( possibly related  means 
there is a reasonable possi bility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social  harm) than was previously known 
or recognized.  
A Serious Adverse Event ( SAE) is defin ed as any untoward medical occurrence that results in 
death, is life -threatening, requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], causes persistent or significant 
disability/incapa city, results in congenital anomalies/birth defects, or, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_193312], represents other significant hazards or potentially serious harm to research 
participants or others.   
 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1250239] reviews at the regular study intervals coinciding with 
assessments (baseline, 6 week, and 6 month). Coordinators also review the medical record 
periodi cally (at 3 weeks,  18 weeks , 1 year ) following the baseline assessment to determine if 
any anticip ated AEs, SAEs, or UAEs occurred. Study staff are also informed to contact [CONTACT_47808] [INVESTIGATOR_892569] a participant AE. The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_892570], if applicable. Directing AE information to the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_514774] t is discovered 
separately from medical record review helps ensure that the study coordinator remains naïve to 
the treatment group (intervention or control). All AE reports are reviewed by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_892571] a report.  
Notably, although the expected occurrence of non -study related anticipated AEs is high, the 
expected occurrence of study -related AEs associated with the intervention (participation in a 
group based self -management program ), control ( individual education supp ort program ), or 
study assessments (self -report questionnaires and cognitive testing) is low.  
The VAPSHCS  will evaluate the implications of AE information according to an identified 
protocol, specifically, the occurrence of [ADDRESS_1250240] be submitted on the template (See Appendix F) to the VA Central IRB 
within 5 business days after the study staff becomes aware of the event. Additio nally, site study 
staff (coordinators and PIs) should receive a copy of the SAE/UAP report.  
All AEs (includes anticipated AEs, UAEs, UAPs, and SAEs) must be followed until resolution or 
a stable endpoint is reached, such as:  
• AE is resolved and has return ed to normal/baseline values or has stabilized.  
• Subject is lost to follow -up or has withdrawn consent.  
• AE is judged by [CONTACT_7880], lead PI/SC, and/or Co -PI [INVESTIGATOR_892572].  
• Participant has completed study required follow -ups (6 mont h visit).  
 
Additionally, t he investigators will monitor all AEs and study activity. Although it is unlikely, the 
following conditions would trigger an immedia te suspension of the research project:  
• There was reason to believe the study procedures (assessmen ts, intervention, control) 
were adversely affecting a participant’s overall health, including mental health, as 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_869415][INVESTIGATOR_892573].  
• The occurrence of 5 or more study -related AEs or 2 or more study -relate d SAEs in 
either condition will trigger a review of the protocols at the time of occurrence. It will 
better accommodate the expected low -base rate of problems and allow  for the early 
identification issues than would a DSMB that met at an arbitrary regular interval.  
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1250241] be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_892636], unless the change is necessary to eliminate apparent 
immediate hazards to human subjects (21 CFR 312.66), or to protect the life or physical well -
being of the participant (21 CFR 812.35(a)(2)). A protocol deviation  is also any other, 
unplanned, instance(s) of protocol non -compliance.  
Reporting Requirements  
Study sites, under the direction of the site PI, are responsible for reporting any protocol 
deviations, violations, or non -compliance to the VA Central IRB within 5 business days after 
being made aware of the deviation  (see Appendix F ). Study sites must report any protocol 
deviations that are likely to substantially adversely affect:  
• The rights, saf ety, or welfare of the research participant;  
• The participant’s willingness to continue participation; or  
• The integrity of the research data, including VA information security requirements.  
 
Additionally, the PI/SC should be informed by [CONTACT_892637] r and/or site PI [INVESTIGATOR_892574] a copy of the report of protocol 
deviations, violations, and/or non -compliance.  
8.0 Privacy and Confidentiality  
The study has a HIPAA Authorization  Form  (Appendix B)  that participants review and 
sign following the informed consent process. This study uses Protected Health 
Information (PHI) related to amputation surgery and post -operative care.  
We will protect participant’s privacy interests by [CONTACT_892638]:  
• Screening and consent will take place in a private clinic room, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39223], room in 
the Clinical Research Unit, another quiet area of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , or by [CONTACT_756]/ma il 
following initial contact [CONTACT_892639] a provider.  
• The EDC system used for data collection stores the information collected in a 
PostrgreSQL database secured by [CONTACT_892640] (Heroku, 
https://heroku.com/policy/security ). A username [CONTACT_892648] l only be supplied after credentials are 
verified with Spectrum Research, Inc. Data collected and stored in the database are 
coded and do not contain protected health information .  
• Site study coordinators maintain an electronic screening and enrollment log . All 
participants who complete the screening process receive a screening ID (e.g. S1001, 
S1002, etc.) where the first digit runs 1 -5 based on the number of VA sites. A 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1250242] initials of 
the participant s, but will contain the screening ID, date of screening, eligibility status, 
and reason for screen failure/refusal, and if enrolled, the enrollment study ID. Access 
to the master screening log is regulated by a secure login ID and password for e ach 
user.  
• Once the participant signs a consent form, the site study coordinator assigns an 
enrollment study ID number (e.g. 1001, 1002, etc.) where 1 -5 designates the VA site. 
The sites maintain a consent enrollment log that links the study ID to the part icipant’s 
name, last [ADDRESS_1250243]. All identifiable  
information, including the crosswalk document (consent enrollment log) is stored 
locally in a password protected file, on a restricted access folder, on the VA network 
and behind the VA firewall. Only IRB -approved researchers have access to this 
document.  These documents will never leave the VA sites, and Spectrum Research 
and The University of Washington never receive information that could identify 
patients.  
• In the event a site study coordinator is unavailable to perform baseline and follow -up 
assessmen ts, the Seattle study coordinator or project coordinator may conduct these 
assessments by [CONTACT_648]. Site study staff will share participant ID number, name, and 
phone number with Seattle staff. This exchange will take place by [CONTACT_892641] -encrypted 
email or telephone . Seattle staff will maintain a crosswalk document that is stored 
locally at the VAPSHCS in a password protected file, on a restricted access folder, 
on the VA network and behind the VA firewall. This log will also include dates the 
assessments occurred by  [CONTACT_892642]. This information 
will only be stored temporarily at VAPSHCS. Once the site study coordinator is 
available, this information will be returned to the site by [CONTACT_892641] -encrypted email or 
telephone and will be removed from t he temporary crosswalk file.  
• Once a group of 8 participants (±2 when necessary) complete the baseline 
assessment, the coordinator alerts the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_892575]. Because the 
coordinator is blind to treatment group, the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_892576] a 
secure web -based randomization scheme also maintained by [CONTACT_892612]. 
The user access the website with a secure log in ID and password and selects  
participant IDs from the electronic master screening log to obtain the treatment 
group. T he group treatment allocation will be automatically matched to the study IDs 
in the system. The randomization technique will allow for a random distribution 
without providing any discernible pattern. Each site PI [INVESTIGATOR_523432] a separate 
randomization  log containing study IDs, name, and randomization group. This log will 
be in a password protected file, in a restricted access folder, on the VA network 
behind the VA firewall. Only the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_892577].  
• Data from each eCRF is stored into a secure database electronically using the web -
application provided by [CONTACT_892612]. Study coordinators will have the ability 
to log into this web -application with their designated log -in credentials. Once the 
coordinator has logged in, the ability to enter participant data into a variety of web -
forms becomes available. The coordinator will not have the ability to edit or view data 
 
 
V13 06.14.2017  VA Central IRB Protocol Template – version 10/26/[ADDRESS_1250244] there is no ability to view/edit any of the study data.  
• Coded research data obtained from the eCRFs will be stored through SSL database 
encryption, behind local and master firewa lls hosted by [CONTACT_892643], and encrypted if 
necessary. Again, data will only be accessible with a valid and confirmed user ID and 
password. Each user ID will be assigned viewing/editing privileges based on the 
needs of that user, allowing or disallowing the vie wing/editing of select data.  
The data, after it has been entered by a verified user, will be transmitted from one of 
the web -application’s data collection forms via SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption 
and stored in a PostgreSQL database using the encrypt ed database connection. 
HTTPS will also be enabled for this website. Ultimately this means that the data will 
be securely transferred from over the Internet via HTTPS, and then stored in the 
database using a SSL encrypted database connection.  
Heroku’s phys ical infrastructure is hosted and managed within Amazon’s secure data 
centers and utilizes Amazon Web Service (AWS) technology. Amazon continually

Data files, which are coded and do not contain any identifiable information  or HIPAA 
identifiers , will be periodically downloaded from database to a physical computer for 
the purpose of analysis and will be password protected and encrypted on these 
devices . These files will only be accessible by [CONTACT_892644].  
• Research records, including eCRFs, will be identified with a unique study ID. The 
crosswalk documents (enrollment log and randomization log) will be stored 
separately from all other study data at ea ch VA site. Again, all of the study files will 
be stored on a VA secure network behind VA firewall with required password 
protections, at each VA site. Only IRB -approved study personnel have access to the 
study records.  
• All paper records for the study (tel ephone scripts, paper screening CRFs, consent 
forms, and other study -related documents) will be secured in locked filing cabinets in 
locked VA offices that only the IRB -approved research personnel have access to.  
• VA-issued laptop computers (with FIPS 140 -2 encryption) and VA -issued desktop 
computers are used to enter all electronic data (screening log, eCRFs) and access 
all study -related files on the VA network.  When not in use, the laptops will be stored 
in locked cabinets inside of locked offices at each site. 
• VA-issued and approved digital voice recorders (with FIPS 140 -2 encryption) are 
used to audio -record the VETPALS and focus group sessions. Voice files from each

voice files to the main study site, VAPSHCS.  Files may be transferred by [CONTACT_290552]: (1) PKI -encrypted email, (2) burned to encrypted CD and mailed 
using a  secure, traceable mail service (e.g. UPS, FedEx), (3) uploaded to a secure 
SharePoint that is only accessible by [CONTACT_1744] -approved research staff.  At the main study 
site, the PI/SC, Co -PI/SC, Co -I, and VETPALS facilitator will also store these files on 
the VA network in a restricted -access folder. Voice files will also be reviewed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Dawn Ehde, PhD from the University of Washington who is a Co -I on this project. 
Files will be reviewed at the VAPSHCS , via secure VPN connection to the VA . When 
not in use, the  digital voice recorders will be stored in locked cabinets inside of 
locked offices at each site.  
• Following the completion of all study -related procedures, the master subject -ID and 
identifier crosswalk from each site will be securely shipped (e.g., via UPS with 
shipment tracking  or transferred electronically using a VA -approved encryption 
method  and will be consolidated and retained in Seattle . Individual, redundant, site 
cross walks will be destroyed . Coded datasets (that do not contain any HIPAA 
identif iers or other identifiable information)  will remain at Spectrum Research , 
University of Washington , and OHSU  for analysis purposes . These datasets will be 
password protected and encrypted on computers located at Spectrum Research, 
Inc., [ADDRESS_1250247]. David Yanez 
(Gaines Hall, Room 155) . Spectrum Research , University of Washington , and OHSU  
do not receive or have access to the key to the code . Data will be returned to VA 
Puget Sound no later than two years following the completion of the last period of 
data analysis.   
9.0 Communication Plan  
General Communications  
The PI/SC and LSIs are responsible for training all applicable staff at participating sites. 
The PI/SC will hold a series of pre -study training conference calls to establish regular 
communication among the site study coordinators and site PIs. Prior to the start of 
recruitment, VAPSHCS in Seattle will host a kick -off meeting for LSIs, VETPALS 
facilitators, and study coordinators. The protocol will be reviewed during this meeting, 
including a plan for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_892578].  
The site PIs and coordi nators will also participate in regular monthly conference calls. 
The purpose of the monthly meetings is to discuss study progress, issues with 
recruitment, enrollment, and retention, and to share strategies to ensure the success of 
the study at each site.  The meeting frequency may adjust throughout the course of the 
study (e.g. meetings occur bi -weekly at the start of the project), but staff will meet 
monthly at a minimum.  
Additionally, the site PIs, VETPALS facilitators, and other investigator -level staff  (e.g. 
Drs. Turner, Czerniecki, Williams, Ehde, Norvell, Wegener, Yanez) will meet monthly to 
discuss any issues related to randomization, intervention delivery or fidelity, AEs, SAEs 
and UAPs, and other necessary topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102].

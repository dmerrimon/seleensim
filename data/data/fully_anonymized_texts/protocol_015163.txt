Primary Aim :  
The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to compare vaginal mesh and 
suture exposure rates in women undergoing robotic total hysterectomy and sacrocolpopexy with 
a light-weight polypropylene mesh (Upsylon™ y-mesh) using either permanent suture 
(polytetrafluoroethylene, Gore-Tex) versus delayed absorbable monofilament suture 
(polydioxanone, PDS) through1-year post surgery. 
 
Secondary Aims : 
1. To compare the 1-year composite success rate ( leading edge of prolapse is at or above 
the hymen and apex has descended less than 1/3 of the vaginal length, no subjective 
feeling of bulge; no retreatment for pelvic organ prolapse (POP); no vaginal mesh/suture 
exposure ) of permanent versus delayed absorbable sutures for mesh graft attachment 
during robotic total hysterectomy and sacrocolpopexy. 
2. To compare postoperative symptoms of pelvic floor disorders, including urinary 
incontinence, voiding dysfunction, pelvic organ prolapse, sexual dysfunction and quality 
of life between the 2 groups at 1 year. 
3.  To evaluate adverse outcomes in each group, classified according to the Clavien-Dindo 
system. 
BACKGROUND 
Symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse is common and 13%1 to 19%2,[ADDRESS_364948] rate of surgical complications,4 has 
a high rate of recurrent prolapse. A recent randomized trial of uterosacral versus sacrospi[INVESTIGATOR_299061] a 30% recurrence rate at 2 years.3  
Abdominal sacrocolpopexy (SCP) is considered to be the most durable operation for advanced 
pelvic organ prolapse with reoperation rates of less than 5%.5-[ADDRESS_364949] 
than abdominal SCP without a demonstrable difference in efficacy.8,9 While traditionally 
reserved for women with vaginal vault prolapse, SCP is increasingly considered as a primary 
surgical option for women who present with uterovaginal prolapse in an attempt to improve 
longer-term surgical outcomes. The optimal management of the uterus and cervix in these 
cases is unclear.  
Rationale for total versus supracervical hysterectomy with concomitant SCP 
While supracervical hysterectomy and concomitant SCP are associated with lower rates of 
mesh exposure,10-12 potential negative consequences of a supracervical hysterectomy include 
morcellation of unanticipated uterine malignancy,13 cervical stump prolapse/elongation, cyclic 
vaginal bleeding, and reduced anterior vaginal support (Myers EM, Matthews et al., in press). 
When conducting a supracervical hysterectomy, power morcellators are the most common 
method used to extract the amputated uterine corpus.  The potential risks of power morcellation 
were recently highlighted by [CONTACT_299074] e fragments of an undiagnosed uterine leiomyosarcoma throughout the abdomen, 
which negatively impacts prognosis   
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm393576.htm ). With these 
Version Date: 2/18/[ADDRESS_364950] specimen through the vagina. 
Vaginal mesh exposure has been a problematic complication with both abdominal SCP and 
minimally invasive SCP. Widely disparate rates of mesh exposure ranging from 0%14 to 27%[ADDRESS_364951] been reported. A systematic review of ASCP outcomes in 2004 reported an overall rate of 
3.4%,6 and a recent meta-analysis of robotic-assisted SCP reported an overall rate of 2%.16 
Some consistent risk factors for mesh exposure are non-Type 1 polypropylene mesh (knitted, 
small-pore mesh materials) and smoking.17,[ADDRESS_364952] identified total hysterectomy 
as a significant risk factor. In an evaluation of patients enrolled in the CARE trial, 6% had 
evidence of mesh exposure at [ADDRESS_364953] a 5-
fold increased risk.18 The rate at 6 years rose to 10.5%. 5 More than 50% of subjects in this trial, 
however, had a non-Type 1 polypropylene mesh. Akyol et al. demonstrated a 2-fold increased 
risk (12%)19 and Bensinger et al. a 7-fold increased risk (8.2%)[ADDRESS_364954], 4 retrospective studies in which Type1 polypropylene mesh was used 
revealed no increased risk of mesh erosion with concomitant total hysterectomy.14,21-23 These 
widely discrepant rates of mesh exposure may be related to surgical technique, graft material 
and/or suture materials used for mesh attachment.  
Rationale for need to study suture material for mesh attachment during SCP 
The effect of suture on mesh exposure may be as significant as concomitant hysterectomy or 
mesh type. At UNC, we reported on mesh exposure using a permanent suture for mesh 
attachment during SCP with and without concomitant total hysterectomy, with rates of 8% at 1 
year.24 There is some evidence that a delayed absorbable suture may reduce the risk of mesh 
or suture erosion.  In a retrospective review comparing braided permanent suture to delayed 
absorbable monofilament suture for SCP mesh attachment, rates of mesh exposure were 
reduced in the absorbable suture group (3.7% vs 0%), with no associat ed POP recurrence.25 
Similarly, in another retrospective review, when delayed absorbable monofilament suture was 
used for SCP mesh attachment in 67 women undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy and 
SCP, no mesh exposures were noted at a median follow up of 27 months.26 The use of 
permanent sutures for vaginal mesh attachment has historically been advocated as a means to 
reduce POP recurrence risk; yet, n o prospective study has definitively answered this question . 
The tradeoff of using a permanent suture may be an increased risk of mesh or suture exposure, 
as a permanent suture that has breached the vaginal epi[INVESTIGATOR_299062] a nidus for 
bacterial seeding , theoretically increasing the risk of mesh exposure. As SCP appears to be a 
more durable procedure for women with advanced uterovaginal prolapse, there is an 
urgent need to identify the ideal method of vaginal mesh attachment that minimizes th e 
risk of mesh-related complications while maintaining effectiveness of the POP repair. 
Choice of mesh material 
Upsylon ™ ([LOCATION_011] Scientific, Natick, MA) is a pre-formed Y-mesh that is light-weight (25 g/m2), 
composed of Type I polypropylene material, with a pore size of 2.[ADDRESS_364955] in SCP. It is lighter in mesh weight than the 
IntePro ™ y-mesh (American Medical Systems, Minneapolis, MN), which we previously used in 
the comparative trial of robotic to abdominal SCP in which our mesh exposure rates were 8%. 
The primary aim of this randomized trial, therefore, is to test the hypothesis that use of 
the Upsylon™ mesh with a delayed absorbable suture for mesh attachment at the time of 
robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy and SCP will reduce the risk of vaginal

 mesh
 and/or suture exposure rates compared to a permanent monofilament suture. 
Secondary aims will include an evaluation of the effect of this light-weight mesh and 
absorbable suture on prolapse and quality of life outcomes and surgical complications at 
1 year after surgery.

tudy Withdrawal 
Participants may withdraw consent at any point during the study. If a participant withdraws or is 
withdrawn, documentation will be made on an End of Study Form, including the reasons for 
withdrawal. There is no risk to participants who choose to withdraw from the study. Withdrawn 
study participants will be included in the Intent- to-Treat analysis and will not be replaced.  
 
Pre-operative/Baseline Visit 
The Pre-operative/Baseline Visit may occur up to [ADDRESS_364957] identification number that consists of a site letter (A-E) and a 
three-digit identification number.  
At this visit participants will complete standardized and validated symptom bother (PFIQ-sf7), 
sexual functioning (PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220]- IR), and QoL questionnaire (PFDI-sf20) to assess baseline 
functioning. Preoperative urodynamic testing, imaging, anorectal manometry and/or 
cystourethroscopy may be completed at the discretion of the physician. Participants who do not 
meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered screen failures. Information on scr een 
failures will be captured within a case report form (CRF) and will include reasons for screen 
failure.  
The Baseline Visit consists of the following: 
 Informed Consent 
 Participant Contact [CONTACT_23094] 
 Inclusion/Exclusion Form 
 Medical & Surgical History Form 
 POP-Q Exam 
 PFIQ-sf7, PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220]- IR, PFDI-sf20 questionnaires  
 Assessment of pain and analgesic use  
Please note that source data collected as part of routine clinical care may be used to complete 
CRFs as long as the window between prior data collection and operative procedures does not 
exceed six months. This includes previously performed POP-Q exams as well as previously 
collected questionnaires.    
Randomization 
Randomization will be assigned using RedCAP in the operating room immediately prior  to mesh 
graft attachment to the vagina. Both types of sutures will be available at each site. Participants 
will be randomized to 2-0 GoreTex/CV4 GoreTex (depending on availability of Stitchkit) versus 
2-0 PDS in blocks with block sizes of 2, 4 and 6 for each of the 5 sites. Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_3725].

 Lap
aroscopic or Robotic Approach 
Prior to sacral colpopexy all participants of the trial will undergo total laparoscopic hysterectomy 
(with or without robotic assistance) with or without bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_299064] (at the 
discretion of the patient and surgeon).  
Laparoscopic sacral colpopexy will be performed with or without robotic assistance. The 
configuration of the incisions is not standardized. 
1. Total laparoscopic hysterectomy (with or without robotic assistance) will be 
performed in standard fashion and the uterus will be delivered through the vagina 
with no power morcellation performed. The vaginal cuff will be closed using an 
absorbable suture in 1 layer (suture type at the discretion of the operating surgeon ). 
Closure of the vaginal cuff through a transvaginal approach is not allowed. 
2. The same ultra-lightweight Type 1 polypropylene mesh (Upsylon, [LOCATION_011] Scientific) 
will be used for all study subjects. 
3. Graft placement on the vagina includes placement on the anterior and posterior 
vaginal walls. The vesicovaginal and rectovaginal spaces will be opened. The 
anterior graft will have an attachment that is at least [ADDRESS_364958] 2 permanent sutures (suture type at the 
discretion of operating surgeon). 
4. Closure of the peritoneum over the mesh may be done at the discretion of the 
operating surgeon. 
5. Diagnostic cystoscopy is required after completion of case to confirm intact 
urothelium and patent ureters .  
Optional Additional Procedures 
Midurethral sling for treatment or prevention of stress incontinence 
1. The surgeon can use any type of full-length mid-urethral, monofilament, 
polypropylene, sling (retropubic or transobturator).   
2. The sling should be done through a separate incision from any other proximal 
anterior vaginal wall incisions, and dissection should not extend distal to the 
urethrovesical junction. 
Posterior colporrhaphy 
1. Posterior repair may be performed at the discretion of the surgeon if the patient has 
posterior wall prolapse following the api[INVESTIGATOR_299065] ≥ - [ADDRESS_364959] directed 
technique. 
Anterior colporrhaphy 
1. 
Anterior colporrhaphy may be performed at the discretion of the surgeon if the 
patient has anterior wall prolapse following the api[INVESTIGATOR_58299], Ba ≥ -1 on 
non-straining exam under anesthesia. Otherwise it is at the discretion of the surgeon.

DATA COLLECTION & MANAGEMENT 
Data collection will occur at each site per the schedule outlined in table 1. All study data will be 
recorded on CRFs by [CONTACT_299083]. CRFs shall be 
derived from source documentation and/or participant self-report. Any discrepancies between 
CRFs and source documentation shall be explained and documented on the CRF. Any changes 
Version Date: 2/18/[ADDRESS_364966] be entered into REDCap within 5 business days.  Any queries to data entered into 
REDCap will be addressed by [CONTACT_157720] 5 business days. It is each site’s responsibility to 
regularly check REDCap for data queries. See REDCap Data Entry Protocol for instructions on 
data entry and query resolution. 
Each site will maintain all essential study documents in original format and source 
documentation that support the data collected on study participants in compliance with 
ICH/GCP guidelines. Documents must be retained until at least [ADDRESS_364967] elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of the clinical investigation. Each site will take measures to ensure that 
these essential documents are not accidentally damaged or destroyed.  
OUTCOME MEASURES  
Primary Outcome Measure 
The primary outcome of this trial is the incidence of vaginal mesh and suture exposure rates 
related to the SCP mesh for both arms of the study throug h 1-year after surgery . Any suture or 
mesh visible in the vagina that is not at the position of a midurethral sling will be considered a 
positive outcome. Some participants may also undergo vaginal placement of a mesh sling for 
stress incontinence in a more distal vaginal location. Exposure of this mesh will not be 
consider ed a positive outcome for the primary outcome. 
Secondary Outcome Measures 
Secondary outcomes that we will measure include a composite of objective and subjective 
measures, self-reported outcomes, and assessment of complications as outlined below: 
1. Assessment of efficacy at 1 year of each type of suture material using the composite 
cure as outlined below in a-d. Participants will be considered a surgical success for this 
composite outcome if each of the following four criteria are met: 
a) Anatomic success : Leading edge of the prolapse is at or above the hymen (POP-
Q point Ba and Bp ≤ 0) and the vaginal apex descends less than 1/3 of the total 
vaginal length (C < - TVL/3) 
b) Subjective success : Patient denies symptoms of vaginal bulging per PFDI- 20 
question 3, answering “No” or “Yes” but “Not at All” bothersome (< 2) 
c) Assessment for re-intervention or re-surgery for recurrence or persistence of 
POP : No need for pessary use or additional surgical treatment for prolapse at 
any time after the initial procedure 
d) No mesh / suture exposure 
 
2. Assessment of participant changes in QoL, symptom bother, and sexual functioning at 1 
year compared to baseline30,31: 
 PFDI 20-Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory 
 PFIQ-7-Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire 
 PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220]- IR-Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Continence Sexual Questionnaire

3. 
Assessment of procedure-related or pelvic floor-related adverse outcomes in each group 
as classified according to the Clavi en-Dindo surgical complication grading scale29. 
Adverse events will be assessed intra-operatively, at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year 
postoperatively. 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Statistical Methods 
Data analyses will include t-tests for continuous data, chi-square or Fisher’s exact for 
categorical data, and multi-variable regression to assess the effects of any bivariate analyses 
found to have a positive relationship. Confidence intervals will be report ed for continuous data 
and will be included in the assessment and reporting of outcomes. When the data are analyzed, 
both chi square and Fisher’s exact analyses are performed and the appropriate test and 
associated p value will be used based on the proportion of samples with input less than 5% of 
the total population. Those with a small output will utilize Fisher’s exact.   
The data will be analyzed as Intent to Treat. Missing data may occur if subjects fail to return for 
follow up, thus we plan to over-recruit in order to account for a 20% drop-out rate. Since study 
participants are undergoing surgery, they are more likely to return for their follow-up visits since 
these are part of their standard post-operative care. This will decrease the rate of drop-outs. 
The fact that this is an RCT will minimize the chance of a differential drop-out rate between the 
groups. 
The rate of reported mesh exposure varies greatly from 0-27%, as discussed in our Background 
section on page 2 of the Investigator Protocol. Based on published data both at our institution 
and elsewhere in the literature, we determined that a 10% and 1% rate of mesh exposure in the 
two groups is both supported by [CONTACT_299084], thus we are estimating a 9% 
difference in mesh erosion rates between the two groups: 1% vs 10%. This is a clinically 
significant difference that would affect a change in clinical practice.  
Sample Size 
The power calculation was performed using the statistical computation software Epi [CONTACT_5628]™ 
[IP_ADDRESS], developed on 3/11/14. It is a trademark of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and uses chi square for its computation of sample size for studies based on 
categorical data comparison such as the current study. 
We are planning a study of independent cases and controls with 1 control(s) per case. Prior 
data indicate that the mesh exposure rate among controls is 10%. If the mesh exposure rate for 
experimental subjects is 1%, we will need to study [ADDRESS_364968] the null hypothesis that the failure rates for experimental and control 
subjects are equal with probability (power) 0.8. The Type I error probability associated with the 
test of this null hypothesis is 0.1. The alpha of 0.1 is based on a one-sided hypothesis, 
estimating that mesh exposure rates will be higher in the study arm using permanent suture 
compared to the study arm using absorbable suture. We will use an uncorrected chi-squared 
statistic to evaluate this null hypothesis. We plan to enroll a total 200 subjects across sites to 
account for up to 20% loss to follow up, thus the use of chi square is appropriate given the 
adequately large sample size. 
We feel the sample size is appropriate based on our sample size calculation, taking into account 
the estimated rates of mesh exposure in the two groups, as well as our clinical judgment of the 
number of procedures that are performed each year at the study sites. In the past year each 
Version Date: 2/18/[ADDRESS_364969]
udy site has performed 50 cases, for a total of 200 cases at all combined sites. Therefore our 
sample size of 100 subjects per study arm is feasible for completion in the time allotted.  
Primary Hypothesis 
Statistical testing will be performed to determine if the incidence of mesh and suture exposure in 
the absorbable suture arm is non-inferior to the permanent suture arm. The null hypothesis is 
that the incidence of mesh and suture exposure in the absorbable suture arm will be equal to 
the incidence of mesh and suture exposure in the permanent suture arm.  
Secondary Hypotheses 
1. Statistical testing will be performed to determine if the composite success rate in the 
absorbable suture arm will be non-inferior to the permanent suture arm. The null 
hypothesis is that the success rate in the absorbable suture arm is less than or equal to 
the success rate in the permanent suture arm. 
2. Statistical testing will be performed to determine if the symptomatic success rate in the 
absorbable suture arm is non-inferior to the permanent suture arm. The null hypothesis 
is that the success rate in the absorbable suture arm is less than or equal to the success 
rate in the permanent suture arm. 
3. Statistical testing will be performed to determine if the AE incidences rate of the 
absorbable suture arm is non-inferior to the permanent suture arm. The null hypothesis 
is that the AE incidences rate in the absorbable suture arm is greater than or equal to 
the rate in the permanent suture arm. 
STUDY MONITORING AND DOCUMENTATION 
The Principle Investigator will monitor the study and assess the need for amendments as the 
study progress es. If a protocol revision is necessary for reasons including but not limited to the 
rights, safety or welfare of participants, or scientific integrity of the data, an amendment is 
required. Appropriate approvals (e.g., IRB) of the revised protocol must be obtained prior to 
implementation at each site. 
 
Site Documentation 
All study documents included in this protocol that will be presented to subjects will be submitted 
to the IRB for approval. Each site will maintain a site study binde r that will include the following: 
 
 Enrollment log of patients who have consented to be in the study (electronic version) 
 Protocol Deviation Log (electronic version) 
 Adverse Event Log (electronic version)

quality, and provide ongoing training and support to ensure compliance.  
 
Semi-annual data verification will be conducted by [CONTACT_299085], and to monitor and assess continued compliance with the 
protocol. Study data will be verified for roughly 25% of each site’s overall data collection efforts. 
Site Investigators and study personnel must guarantee access to copi[INVESTIGATOR_299067]. Requests for de-
identified supporting source documents from each site will be supplied via email within [ADDRESS_364971].   
 
Other monitoring activities include reviewing Informed Consent/Research Authorization Forms, 
assessing protocol compliance, regulatory and GCP compliance, reviewing changes to study 
personnel, verifying efforts made to locate “lost- to-follow-up” patients, and assessing other 
study-related functions that contribute to patient safety and study data integrity.  
 
In the event of a Regulatory Inspection, sites should immediately contact [CONTACT_11604]- CH. The Data 
Coordinating Center will manage the REDCap database, as well as monitor quality assurance 
for data entered by [CONTACT_25733]. Any data queries generated in REDCap by [CONTACT_299086] [ADDRESS_364972] be documented on the Protocol Deviation CRF, logged in each site’s 
Protocol Deviation Log, and entered into RedCAP. This form will be completed for each protocol 
deviation related to any portion of the study timeline. An event number will be assigned by [CONTACT_299087]’s Protocol Deviation Log numbering order. 
 
Deviations will be reviewed and evaluated on an ongoing basis and, as necessary, appropriate 
corrective and preventive actions (including notification, site re-training, or discontinuation) will 
be put into place by [CONTACT_978]. 
 
Site staff must not make any changes or deviate from this protocol, except to protect the life and 
physical well-being of a subject in an emergency. Site staff shall notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_299068]-being of a 
subject in an emergency, and those deviations which affect the scientific integrity of the clinical 
investigation. Such notice shall be given as soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_364973] (DSMB) comprised of 2 external physicians ([CONTACT_299089] 
and [CONTACT_65694]) will review all adverse events (AEs) that occur across sites. A semi-
annual report of all AEs will be generated and sent to the DSMB every 6 months.

The PI (Matthews) will be responsible for ensuring that all sites comply with DSMB requests. 
The DSMB will then provide a written evaluation of each SAE detailing a judgment as to 
whether or not the event was deemed to be study related and a judgment as to whether, based 
on the review of the event, the study can: 
1. Continue unchanged 
2. Continue with recommended changes 
3. Be stopped 
 
The DSMB , PI, and each site will keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_299070].  
 
Criteria for Study Termination 
 
After 50% of all study subjects have presented for the 6-week post-operative check, the overall 
rate of mesh and suture exposure will be calculated. If this rate is >12%, the study will be 
terminated. A second stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_299071] a difference in erosion rates between the two 
groups of >50%.   
Reporting Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be recorded and reported according to criteria and timeline below. Sites will 
also follow local regulatory standards for AE reporting. 
 
All AEs must be recorded on the AE CRF, entered into the site AE log, then entered into 
REDCap. An event number will be assigned by [CONTACT_299088]. Each site investigator will determine the relationship of 
the AE to the operative procedures, the relationship of the AE to the pelvic floor, and the 
severity of each reportable AE .  
 
SAEs must be reported to the DSMB within two business days as outlined above in the Data 
Safety Monitoring Board section.  
 
Reportable AEs include those determined to be related to the operative procedures or pelvic 
floor. AEs not related to the operative procedures or pelvic floor will not be collected. Operative 
procedures include the following: Hysterectomy, sacrocolpopexy, sling, anterior and posterior 
vaginal repairs.

Adverse Event Definitions 
Adverse Event: any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or any 
untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory finding) in subjects, whether or not 
related to the operative procedures 
 
Serious Adverse Event: an adverse event that: 
 Led to death 
 Led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject that either resulted in 
o a life-threatening illness or injury  
o a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function 
o in-subject or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272563] 
o medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function 
 Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
 
Relationship of AE to Operative Procedures 
Unrelated: No evidence that the timing if the AE has a relationship to the operative procedures 
performed.   
 
Possibly Related: The AE has a timely relationship to the operative procedures performed , 
however a potential alternative etiology may be responsible for the AE. 
 
Probably Related: The AE has a timely relationship to the operative procedures performed and 
the causative relationship can clearly be established. No potential alternative etiology is 
apparent. 
 
Relationship to Pelvic Floor  
Unrelated: No evidence that the AE has a relationship to the pelvic floor and supporting tissues 
 
Related : If any of the following are met 
 The AE is determined to be potentially related to the pelvic floor and supporting tissues 
including but not limited to lacerations, avulsions, tears, pelvic organ prolapse 
(cystocele, rectocele, enterocele, uterine, rectal), urinary incontinence (stress, urge), 
urinary voiding dysfunction (retention, obstructed voiding, incomplete emptying), fecal 
incontinence (urgency, irritable bowel syndrome), defecatory dysfunction (constipation, 
obstipation, stool trappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], IBS), pain (dyspareunia, pelvic, perineal), and infection 
(bladder, urinary tract, vaginal)  
 There is a strong relationship to the pelvic floor and supporting tissues, and another 
etiology is unlikely 
 There is no other reasonable medical explanation for the event

 Se
verity 
Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of minor irritant type causing 
no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require therapy or a medical evaluation; 
signs and symptoms are transient.  
 
Moderate: Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant and may 
interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_14212]; 
moderate experiences may cause some interference with functioning.  
 
Severe : Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating.

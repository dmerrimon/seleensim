Version Date: 12/0 6/[ADDRESS_737351] Oral Multimodal Therapy in Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty: A 
Randomized Controlled Double Blind Trial  
 
2. Purpose of the study  
To determine the efficacy of intravenous versus oral acetaminophen in reducing 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_561172] a standardized multimodal protocol for primary total hip arthro plasty.  
 3. Background and Significance  
Multimodal analgesic regimens utilizing a variety of agents have become a 
standard of care for postoperative pain control following a wide variety of surgical 
procedures. With an increasingly greater emphasis on enha nced recovery and 
accelerated return to function, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- sparing effect of t hese agents has  been 
shown to result in improved patient outcomes such as mobilization, bowel recovery, satisfaction and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577].
1,2 Typi[INVESTIGATOR_561173], NSAI Ds/COX -2 inhibitors, 
gabapentinoids, ketamine, and dexamethasone.  
 Many of the agents that are used in these regimens are administered via the oral 
route. However, the oral route  is associ ated with limitations: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_561174] , or unable or unwilling to swallow a large number of 
tablets. In addition, s cheduling of oral medications can be difficult, especially 
when patients are asleep. Most  importantly , bioavailability of orally administered 
agents that rely on absorption from the small intestine (e.g. acetaminophen) in 
the post-operative setting has been shown to be significantly  reduced compared 
to preoperative levels in the same subjects.
[ADDRESS_737352] of opi[INVESTIGATOR_561175]/or volatile anesthetics  on gut motility. In contrast, a similar drug administered 
via the intravenous route has 100% bioavailability.  
 
While many anesthesiologists and surgeons anecdotally believe that intravenous acetaminophen leads to improved patient comfort and satisfaction with reduced opi[INVESTIGATOR_561176], this has not been investigated rigorously . This aim of this study is to compare these two routes over the first [ADDRESS_737353] 20% less opi[INVESTIGATOR_561177].  
 4. Design and Procedures  
 This is a single center, prospective, randomized controlled  study. 90 
subjects will be recruited (see #6 Recruitment and Compensation below). On the 
day o f surgery , subjects will be randomized to receive either the study 
intervention (intravenous acetaminophen and placebo tablets) or the control intervention (intravenous saline  and active acetaminophen tablets).  The 
Investigational Drug Service will prepare each intervention package, which will 
include one intravenous and one oral medication dose. Only one of these routes 
will be active (determined by [CONTACT_17628]). Subjects will receive doses of both an intravenous and oral study drug every 6 hours in order to maintain blinding, 
and will receive a total of 4 doses of each (at 0, 6, 12 and 18 hours) . The dose of 
acetaminophen in all cases will be 1000 mg. The volume of intravenous 
acetaminophen (and saline) will be [ADDRESS_737354] of two ( 2) 
tablets of 500 mg each (or two matching placebo tablets).  
 All subjects will receive a standardized anesthetic regimen for tot al hip 
arthroplasty , as follows:  
A) Preoperative phase  
Subjects will receive the following preoperative multimodal drugs:  
• Pregabalin 75 mg PO  
• Celecoxib 200 mg PO  
• The interventional drugs, both IV and PO  
. The time that these drugs are administered will be recorded as time zero. 
Patients will then receive a spi[INVESTIGATOR_9359] 12.5 mg of isobaric bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  No peripheral nerve blocks will be performed.  
 
B) Intraoperative phase 
All subjects will be receiving  propofol infusion beginning at 50 m cg/kg/min and 
titrated to a Richmond Agitation- Sedation Scale score of - 1 to - 3 (drowsy to 
moderate sedation). Dexamethasone 10 mg IV and ketamine 0.25 mg/kg IV up to 
[ADDRESS_737355] multimodal regimen. If 
required, subjects may receive fentanyl 25 mcg IV as needed to treat discomfort . 
No joint infiltration will be performed by [CONTACT_11065].  
 
C) Postoperative phase 
 In the Post -Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), subjects will have an intravenous 
patient -controlled analgesia (IVPCA) device connected and loading doses of 
hydromorphone administered by [CONTACT_561187] (0.2 mg q 8 min 
NCT0283987 6 
Version Date: 12/0 6/2017  Page 3  
 prn). 
 On th e floor, s ubjects will receive:  
• Pregabalin 75 mg PO BID until discharge  
• Celecoxib 200 mg PO BID until discharge  
• Dexamethasone 10 mg IV x 1 on postoperative day 1 ([ADDRESS_737356] dose)  
• Intravenous patient -controlled analgesia (IVPCA) with hydromorphone (0.2 
mg q 8 min) .  
 The remaining 3 intervention packages (IV and PO) will be administered at 
6, [ADDRESS_737357] dose.  At time point 24 hours (i.e. the fifth  
dose of acetaminophen), all subjects will begin to receive [ADDRESS_737358] 
pain scale out to 30 days postoperatively.  
ii. NRS -11. The 11- point Numeric Rating Scale (0- 10) will be used as a 
secondary outcome measure. Two measures will be taken with each 
assessment, one at rest and o ne with active hip flexion. These will be 
conducted preoperatively, [ADDRESS_737359]. Maximum range of motion will be recorded using a goniometer. (POD 1 and 2)  
v. Heel slide test. This test assesses range of motion. Subjects will be asked 
to bend their knee and hip while sliding their heel along the bed.  
vi. Self-paced walk test . This measure of overall physical performance is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_561178]. Subjects are asked to walk 
quickly and safely without overexerting themselves along a hallway to a 
line marked at [ADDRESS_737360] associated with nursing interventions and drugs to treat 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related adverse events, and overall hospi[INVESTIGATOR_561179]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_561180] . This is defined by [CONTACT_46918] 3 criteria:  a pain score of 3 or less with ambulation, no intravenous 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_561181] 6 hours, and the ability to perform self -care (go 
to the toilet, dress, and show er).

6. Subject recruitment and compensation 
 Potential subjects (see inclusion criteria above) will be identified and 
screened in the Pre-Anesthetic Clinic by a research assistant. Only patients 
scheduled for primary total hip arthroplasty will be eligible for this study.  There 
will be no compensation for subjects for their participation.   
In the event that  a potential subject is not feasible for in- person approach to 
occur, the subject will be introduced to research by a provider. The research staff 
will follow -up with a phone call using the IRB approved phone script. Subjects will 
be asked for permission f or their electronic records to be viewed by [CONTACT_561188]/ exclusion criteria. If the subject qualifies and is interested in participating, research staff will meet the subject at the next visit to Duke for a formal consent. If the patient i s not interested in the study, or does not meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, then information collected from the patient will be 
destroyed.  
 7. Consent process  
Subjects permission to be approached for research will be obtained by [CONTACT_561189].  The consent process will be conducted by [CONTACT_561190]. The consent process will  take 
place in the pre- operative screening or the surgical clinics. Throughout the consent 
process, measures will be taken to maintain privacy, such as by [CONTACT_561191] -to-face 
conversations in private rooms. As much time as necessary will be spent with each 
potential subject to sufficiently explain and answer all questions, and address all concerns 
they may have in regard to the study and/or consent process.   Under HIPAA waiver, the 
study team will identify potential subjects from clinic schedules, OR sc hedules and 
Maestro Care.  
 
8. Subject’s Capacity to Give Legally Effective Consent  
Subjects who do not have the capacity to give legal consent will not be 
approached for participation in this study.  
 
9. Study interventions  
See #4.  
 
10. Risk/benefit assessment  
Risk to the subject  
Risks of the study intervention are minimal. Both IV and PO  acetaminophen are 
FDA approved for treatment of pain in doses up to 4000 mg/day. Acetaminophen is a standard drug used in our multimodal pathway for total joint replacement. 
Subjects will receive an additional 400 ml of fluid (either acetaminophen or 
saline) over the first [ADDRESS_737361] for participation in the study. Subjects will not be compensated for their participation.  
 12. Data analysis and statistical considerations  
We will use descriptive statistics (mean (SD) or frequency (%)) and group comparisons via Wilcoxon rank sum or fisher exact tests to measure differences between groups  in opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], pain scores with rest an d activity, and 
other secondary outcome measures.   
 
Sample Size Justification  
 
Our typi[INVESTIGATOR_561183] 24 hours is approximately 35 morphine equivalents.  To address  the 
primary hypothesis, that the opi[INVESTIGATOR_561184] 20%  compared to the oral group, we would need 27 subjects per 
group ( 80% power and alpha=0.05), or 54 total. To allow for participant drop- out, 
we will enroll a total of 90 subjects.  
 
13. Data & Safety Monitoring  
In accordance with federal regulations the PI [INVESTIGATOR_147427], review, and 
promptly report to the IRB, appropriate institutional officials, sponsor, coordinating center and the appropriate regulatory agenc y head all unanticipated 
problems involving risks to subjects or others that occur in the course of a subject’s participation in a research study (45 CFR 46.103(b)(5)(i) and 21 CFR 
NCT0283987 6 
Version Date: 12/0 6/2017  Page 7  
 56.108(b)(1)), all AE reports will be reported per the DUHS IRB policies. P I will 
be monitoring all AEs and submitting reports to the IRB per DUHS IRB policy.  
 
 Privacy, Data Storage and Confidentiality  
Potential subjects and their families will be approached in private rooms. Any 
guests not involved in the consent process will be asked to leave the room during 
any communications, unless the patient allows them to be present.  Data will be 
collected and stored in Redcap.  Efforts to maintain subject confidentiality will include assignment of following Federal Privacy Regulations which provide safeguards for privacy, security, and authorized access. Except when required by [CONTACT_2371], subjects will not be identified by [CONTACT_2300], social security number, address, 
telephone number, or any other direct personal identifier in study records 
disclosed  outside of Duke University Health System (DUHS).  Subjects will be 
not be revealed in any reports or publicati ons resulting from this study.  For 
records disclosed outside of DUHS, subjects will be assigned a unique code 
number . The paper/ electronic data will be stored as per the RDSP .

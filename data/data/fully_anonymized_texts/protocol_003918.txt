1.0 Protocol Summary  
 
This will be a double- blinded, randomized, crossover  pi[INVESTIGATOR_348205] a continuous oral sip -feeding  of stable isotope tracer method for the evaluation of 
whole- body protein metabolism . This method will be evaluated using t wo different 
amounts of an essential amino acid (EAA) + whey protein supplement  on up to ten 
younger, healthy subjects . Stable isotope preparations will be continuously consumed 
by [CONTACT_348212] [ADDRESS_432573]’s lean mass.  
 
2.0 Background  
 
Stable isotope tracers are routinely used to study protein metabolism  in free- living 
individuals  in the fields of nutrition and exercise (1, 2). Whole -body rates of protein 
synthesis (PS), breakdown (PB), and net balance (NB) in response to nutrition and 
exercise interventi ons are commonly evaluated using a primed- constant infusion of 
essential amino acid (EAA) tracer s, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 2H5-phenylalanine and 2H4-tyrosine  (1). 
This method has many advantages. The primed- constant infusion allows for 
determination of basal protein kinetics,  in addition to  the acute  physiological response to 
an intervention, which allows for each subject to serve as their own control. Although an effective method, administration of the primed -constant infusion requires  involvement 
from multiple trained indivi duals, including research pharmacists and nurses who 
compound and administer the EAA tracer. This limits the ability to apply these methods 
in field -type settings outside of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_348206]. The cost associated with purchase and

[ADDRESS_432574] amino acid tracers  in sip 
fashion to achieve a similar plateau enrichment . Oral bolus ingestion of amino acid 
tracer  has been used to quantify 24- hour whole- body protein metabolism in a variety of 
healthy and clinical populations for over 50 years  (3). This method is  one of the most 
conducive field- methods for determining  whole- body protein metabolism in free- living 
subjects and has minimal participant burden. However, full integration of th e tracer from 
a single bolus ingestion into the entire protein pool takes at least [ADDRESS_432575] as constant infusion.  If shown to be valid, this method 
would significantly reduce the rigor and expense of pharmacy -prepared infusions, and 
more importantly, allow for quantification of acute physiological protein responses within 
the field setting.  
 
3.0 S pecific Aims  
 
SA1: To evaluate the validity of a continuous oral sip- feeding method  of stable isotope 
tracer  for the evaluation of whole- body protein metabolism in response to two different 
doses of an EAA/ whey protein supplement ( Low= 6.3g and High= 12.6g).  We will 
compare kinetic responses  with oral isotope ingestion to those previously determined by 
[CONTACT_348213] (4).

Visit 1: This visit will take place at the UAMS RIOA.

their eligibility will be determined. Eligible subjects  will be randomiz ed and be scheduled 
for Visit 2 . A whole body DXA scan will be performed by [CONTACT_348214]’s 
machine for quantification of lean mass.  
 
Visit 2: This vis it will take place at the UAMS IOA. Subjects will be instructed to fast 
(consuming only water) from 10:[ADDRESS_432578]’s preferred arm. At scheduled intervals, study staff will draw 
a ~2mL blood sample from the IV for research purposes , warming the arm by [CONTACT_3553] 
a heating pad or a heated plastic box . Blood will be transferred into a blood collection 
tube that contains EDTA, cooled on wet ice, centrifuged at ≥ 3000 RPM for ≥ [ADDRESS_432579] the resultant plasma transferred to a labelled cryo tube for freezing at ≤ -80 
degrees Centigrade.  
After the initial blood sample is drawn, subjects will begin ingesting their oral isotope preparations, beginning with a priming dose (per study -specific stable isotope 
calculations ). A timer will start when the priming dose is ingested. At 10- minute 
intervals, subjects will ingest a smaller volume of stable isotope preparations  that will 
continue throughout the duration of the study visit (approximately 7 hours).  
 Approximately three hours after study initiations , subject s will ingest their randomly 
chosen amount of SP . Blood sample collection will continue at specific  intervals 
throughout the remainder of Visit 2.  
At the conclusion of the [ADDRESS_432580] 
the site. Visit 3 is  scheduled.  
 Visit 3: Subjects will come back to the RIOA having fasted overnight as  for Visit 2 . All 
study procedures undertaken during Visit 2 will be repeated at Visit 3, with subjects ingesting the remaining SP amount.

4.8 Study Pr oducts  
SP arrives  packaged in a small tub . It is stored at room temperature. Study staff will 
weigh the doses of SP: 6.3g and 12.6g. Prior to ingestion, SP  is dissolved into 
approximately 120mL of cool water.  This product has been approved and used in 
previously approved studies (IRB# 217658).  It is provided at no cost by [CONTACT_348215], LLC

laboratory, located in a restricted area inside the UAMS R IOA building. Said freezers 
are monitored continuously for proper temperature and working condition. Samples will 
be destroyed only after all data has been anal yzed. All blood samples are coded  using a 
unique identifier . None of a subject’s personal identifiers are  present on any biological 
sample.  
 
5.3 Sample Analysis  
Plasma s amples are analyzed for  amino acid concentrations a nd stable isotope levels  
(enrichment) . The analyses are performed in the CTRAL  by [CONTACT_464].  
 
5.4 Data Analysis & Statistics  
Separate independent sample t -tests will be used to evaluate the difference in average 
whole- body  protein metabolism measured using stable isotope infusion versus oral sip-
feeding method for both the low - and high- dose supplement.  To assess validity of the 
oral met hod compared to the infusion method, total error (TE), standard error of the 
estimate (SEE), and Pearson’s correlation coefficient, in addition to mean difference 
and 95% limits of agreement (LOA), will also be evaluated for PS, PB, and NB.  Data 
using the infusion method was collected on a previous cohort of participants of similar demographics ( n=8; 60% female; Age=21.4 ± 0.5 years; Weight=73.8 ± 4.8 kg; percent 
body fat=21.1 ± 2.2%)  using the same supplement product and dosing  (4).

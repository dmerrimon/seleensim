INTRODUCTION AND RAT IONALE  
Background  
Adipose tissue is a loose type of connective tissue specialized to store lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. The majority of 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_646319].  
It is not uniformly distributed in the body.  The major adipose depot is subcutaneous (about 80% 
of all body fat).1   In men it normally represents 15 -20% of body weight and in women, 20 -25% o f 
body weight.  A certain amount of body fat is necessary for normal female reproduction and 
health. Subcutaneous adipose tissue helps to shape, cushion and insulate the body and provides 
padding to some organs.  
 
Liposuction is a procedure that can help s culpt the body by [CONTACT_509997].2,3,4  The increasing popularity of this procedure is associated with the evolution of 
techniques and equipment for fat removal, body reshapi[INVESTIGATOR_509989]. Besides the 
traditional su ction -assisted lipoplasty, other options include ultrasound -assisted and external

ultrasound -assisted liposuction, power -assisted liposuction, laser lipolysis as well as low -level 
laser -assisted liposculpture.5  
 
The efforts in the search for alternative n on-invasive or minimally invasive techniques and new 
tools aim mainly at reducing downtime, and facilitating treatment for reduction of the localized 
fatty tissue areas.  New minimally invasive technologies include subcutaneous injection of 
phosphatidylcho line. This drug was initially used in emergencies and in the treatment of 
atheroma plaques in cardiac diseases.  Recently, it has also been used in the treatment of 
localized fat deposits, with mixed reviews.6   
 
The UltraShape® Contour I VER 3.1  is a device cleared by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA 
– K133238) and Health Canada (HC).  The UltraShape , the next generation of Contour I VER 3.1 , is 
a commercial device cleared by [CONTACT_46924], Health Canada and by [CONTACT_2165] 
(FDA – K141708 ) which  uses focused ultrasound to produce localized mechanical motion within 
fat tissues and cells for the purpose of producing mechanical cellular membrane disruption. It is 
intended for reduction in abdominal circumference.  
 
The UltraShape Powe r System delivers focused ultrasound energy that can disrupt 
subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) to provide a non -invasive approach to achieve a desired 
aesthetic effect. It is intended for non -invasive reduction in abdominal circumference. This study 
intend s to assess UltraShape Power device utilizing the U -Sculpt Power transducer performance.  
 
Device Descriptions  
Syneron UltraShape Power Device  
General:  Tissue selectivity is achieved by a proprietary knowledge of ultrasound parameters 
ensuring specific destruction of the fat cells only within the target area. All other types of tissue, 
such as blood vessels, muscles and peripheral nerves remain intact. T here are no thermal 
effects. Fat cell destruction is achieved by [CONTACT_2207] -induced mechanical effects during a very 
short exposure time.  
 
The UltraShape Power system comprised of two main parts:  
 The Main console  
 Transducer

Main Console  
The Pulser  
The mai n console contains: the Pulser, Touch Screen, PC, Cooling System, Power supply Module  
and Video Camera. The main console hardware and software enable operation of the  
Transducer Unit.  
The Pulser is responsible for producing high power electrical signals fo r feeding the Transducer  
Unit, with the ability to control operating frequencies, burst length, duty cycle and on -line 
output power. The Pulser has communication interfaces with the PC, the Power Supply Module  
(PSM), the Distributer Board (DSB), the Transd ucer and the cooling system. The Pulser is  
comprised of a CPU unit and Pulse generator. The Pulser uses transducer -unique parameters  
and "Power Level" (high \ medium \ low) selected by [CONTACT_646328].  
Touch Screen and PC  
The operator interfaces with the UltraShape Power system using its Touch Screen.   
The Touch Screen interface allows the user to command and control the system using dedicated  
software. The Touch Screen interfaces with the Pulser, the camera a nd external USB. The Touch  
Screen operates the system's tracking system that uses a video camera in order to monitor the  
position of the transducer over the patient’s body. The System database is managed by [CONTACT_646329].  
Cooling system  
Inside the Trans ducer there is a cooling element (TEC). The cooling system evacuates heat from  
the hot side of the TEC, by [CONTACT_646330]'s radiator.  
Power Supply Module  
The Power Supply Module (PMS) provides the input power to the system sub -units. The  Power  
Supply Module receives external AC voltage and converts it into DC: Low Voltage and High  
Voltage. The PSM is controlled by [CONTACT_646331].  
Video Camera  
The system includes a video camera as a part of its tracking system. The camera captures the 
image of the treatment area, enabling the operator to monitor the procedure and track the  
treated area and transducer position.  
Distributor Board (DSB)  
The Distributor Board is responsible for distribution of DC voltages to the system's sub -units.  
The DSB is controlled by [CONTACT_646332]. The DSB gathers feedback signals from the Cooling system  
and returns it to the Pulser.

Transducer  
The transducers are electro -mechanical devices that convert electrical signals into mechanical  
(acoustical) energy. Funct ionality of the transducer is based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_646320], whose  
characteristics are to change their physical dimensions when electrical voltage is applied. When  
an alternating voltage, with a certain frequency, is applied across the pi[INVESTIGATOR_646321], it  
causes it to oscillate with the same frequency, thus producing ultrasound waves. The spherical  
shape of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_646322], which enables the  
ultrasound waves to be focused into a narrow focal region ( which is actually the target region).  
The UltraShape Power system supports use of the "U -Sculpt Power” (Isppa 660  W/cm2) and the  
“VDF Power” (Isppa 550  W/cm2) Transducers.

Measurements  
Measure the Fat Thickness at the Treated  Area  – Calibrated  Caliper  
The procedure can be performed only in areas where the fat thickness is ≥1.5 cm as measured 
by a skin fold caliper (or ≥3.[ADDRESS_865389] ), and ≥2.5 cm as measured by a 
skin fold caliper  after strappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
Marking Area for Treatment and Sequence of Treatments  
The mark of area to be treated should be copi[INVESTIGATOR_99628] a transparent template (at size of A3 paper) 
to ensure consistent marking of the same area for same patient during the subsequent visits.  
During copying the treatment area to the tr ansparent template, the following signs will be 
marked on transparency ( Figure 3 ) 
a) Margins of area to be treated (A in Figure 3 ) 
b) Subject's identification cod e (B in Figure 3 )

Measure the Fat Thickness at the Treated  Area  – Ultrasound Imaging Device  
Ultrasound Imaging ( USI) provides a valid way for measuring fat thickness using known 
interfaces observed in any individual. USI is relies on the ability to recognize different sub -skin 
interfaces and correctly  identifying them , such as the dermis and the  subcutaneous fat  layer  
interfaces.   
a) Divide the treatment area into 4 sub areas:  
1. Right Upper  
2. Right Lower  
3. Left Upper  
4. Left Lower  
b) Locate each sub area mid -point and measure  
 
Figure 4: Ultrasound Measurements Points  
c) Mark the measurements points on the transparency (made while marking the treatment 
area), to measure the same point in each subsequent visit.  
d) Place the applicator on the skin surface at ang le of 90⁰ (located the applicator under the 
measurement point line for consistency).  
e) Measurement should include all the area between the dermis and end o f the fat tissue 
fascia.  
Marking height of circumference measurement  
The abdominal midsection for circumference  (=Midline)  measurement will be marked at the 
widest region within the defined area for treatment (see Figure 5 ). Patient should stand up 
straight when arms are placed at the rear of neck and head is positioned towards the horizon 
(Figure 6 ). Elbows will be positioned  in front of the body ( Figure 6 ). 
The height for the circumference measurement will be marked at the anterior abdomen, at the 
back and at each lateral side of the body ( Figure 7 ). Additional  measurements will be taken at 2 
cm above midsection  (=2cm above M idline)  measurement and 2 cm below midsection  (=2cm 
below Midline)  measurement.

Measuring Circumference  
Abdominal circumference is measured to quantify the treatment effect. This procedure will be 
performed and recorded every visit at the clinic, immediately following the measur ement of  
height marking.  
In order to achieve reproducible measurement results, t he following requirements should be 
fulfilled:  
1. Patient should be wearing underwear and barefoot during circumference measurement.  
2. Patient should stand up straight when arms are placed at the rear of neck and head is 
positioned towards the horizon. Elbows w ill be positioned in front of the body (see 
Figure 9 A).  
3. The measurement tape (supplied by [CONTACT_510003]) should be in parallel to the floor 
during the measurement (see Figure 9 B).  
4. The circumference measurement tape should be placed under  the marked reference 
points, in order to maintain repetitive height of the measurement.  
5. Midline  measurement should be taken at the level of the widest part  within the defined 
area for treatment ( Figure 5 ) – horizontal  midsection. This height level should be 
recorded for follow up assessments. Additional two measurements at 2 cm above and 2 
cm below the horizontal midsection  (=Midline)  will be taken.  
6. Consecutive measurements should be performed at the same height recorded at 
baseline. In order to assure tha t the measuring tape is parallel to the floor, several 
reference points should be marked around the treatment area and the measuring tape 
should be placed such that it is aligned with them .

Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
For device studies, part 21 CRF 812.3(s)  uses the term unanticipated adverse device effect  which 
is defined as an y serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or 
death caused by, or associated with the  device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigation al plan or 
application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious 
problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.   
Significant device failure may constitute an adverse ev ent if an undesirable experience occurs.  
This definition includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the 
instructions for use or the deployment of the device, or any event that is a result of a user error.  
All unanticipated advers e effects will be graded as follows:  
Mild:  Sign or symptom, usually transient, non -life-threatening requiring no special 
treatment and generally not interfering with usual activities.  
Moderate:  Sign or symptom, non -life-threatening which may be ameliorated by [CONTACT_11884], and may interfere with usual activity.  
Major:  Sign or symptom that is intense or debilitating but non -life-threatening and 
that interferes with usual activities. Recovery is usually aided by [CONTACT_646343].  
Severe:  Any untoward medical occurrence that at any time results in death or life -
threatening illness, resulting in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.   
The relationship of the a dverse effect to the study is defined as follows:  
Probable:  An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to study device, and 
another etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely.  
Possible:  An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the study device, and 
an alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the potential 
relationship to study device.  
Probably not:  An adverse event has little or no temporal relationship t o the study device 
and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
Not related:  An adverse event has no temporal relationship to study device or has a much 
more likely alternative etiology.

 Bullae   Second degree burn  
Over [ADDRESS_865394] some benefit from the treatment procedures as would 
be expected for the commercial device s (UltraShape  Power ). Subject will receive all treatment 
procedures at no cost.  This study will benefit the advancement of medicine by [CONTACT_646344], such as liposuction.  The results of this study will 
help to determine whether th is device is  safe and effective for improvement of localized 
subcutaneous fat.  
Conclusion:  
In light of the potential benefits of non -invasive body contouring relative to its risks, the 
potential benefits associated with the use of the UltraShape Power System  outweigh its risks, 
supporting study initiation.

APPENDIX IV  ‐ PHOTOGRAPHY  
At each of the specified time points; photographs of the treated areas should be taken by 
[CONTACT_510016].  
 Photographs should be taken in  a private room or area of the clinic under controlled 
conditions, including the distance from the camera to the subject, height of the camera, 
background, camera positioning, subject's positioning and lighting in order to achieve 
high -quality before & aft er sets.  
 Consistent lighting - Lighting should be projected from about 45º angle in order to 
emphasize the body appearance.  
 It is important to keep a constant distance between the subject’s feet (use “sticky feet” 
or another way of marking) in order to prop erly present the effect of the treatment. 
The recommended distance between the feet is ~20  cm, but the main point is not to 
make this distance too small, so the thighs touch each other, or too large.  
 The disposable underwear should be used for all photogra phs of all of the anatomical 
areas at all time points.  
 For consistency purposes, the same person should ideally take all study photographs, 
especially per area and subject.  
 The digital files should follow a co nsistent standard naming scheme containing subject 
initials and study ID #, visit or visit date.  
Specific photography details:  
Abdomen:  
Three photographs should be taken at each specified time point  
 Front  
 45º from the right side  
 90º from the right side  
 45º from the left side  
 90º from the left si de 
The subject’s arms should remain out of the way; it  is best to either cross them over each other 
in front of the chest or hold them up at a 90° angle to the body, ensuring that they do not rest 
on the chest or touch the body and that they do not cast a shadow in the photograph.

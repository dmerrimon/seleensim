Study Design This is a Phase 2, randomized, double -blind, placebo -and TEZ/IVA -controlled, 3 -part, 
multicenter study. All parts will be conducted concurrently. Part 1 and Part 2 include a 4 -week 
screening period, 2 dosing periods (a TCdosing period, Period 1, and a VX -659 washout 
period, Period 2), and a 4 -week safety follow -up period. Part 2 also includes a 4 -week Run -in 
Period prior to Period 1. Part 3 is optional and includes a 4 -week screening period , a TC 
dosing period (Period 1),and a 4 -week safety follow -up period . The treatment arms and doses 
of VX -659, TEZ, and IVA or VX-561 to be evaluated are shown below. Subjects may not 
participate in more than 1 part.
To maintain the blind, matching placebo tablets will be administered, a s applicable, so that all 
subjects receive the same number of tablets within a given dosing period.
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_66763] 1. Schematics of the study design are shown below. 
Part 1: Subjects With F/MF Genotypes

Proto col VX16 -659- 101, Version 3.0 Page 6of 74
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential InformationAssessments Safety: AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, ECGs, vital signs, pulse oximetry, physical 
examinations (PEs)
Efficacy: spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], CFQ -R
PD: sweat chloride
PK: VX-659, TEZ, M1 -TEZ, IVA, M1 -IVA, VX-561
Statistical 
AnalysesPrimary Objectives
The safety analysis will be descriptive only.
The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change from baseline through the Day 29 Visit 
for ppFEV 1
All ppFEV 1hypothesis tests will be performed within the mixed -effects model for repeated 
measures (MMRM) framework at a 5% alpha level, with appropriate adjustment for baseline 
covariates. The null within-gr oup hypothesis of no difference in t he mean absolute change 
from baseline through the Day 29 Visit for ppFEV 1in all treatment groups, by [CONTACT_14455], will be 
tested using MMRM. The adjusted means and 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals of the average 
treatment effects through the Day 29 Visit for all within -group and between -group 
comparisons will be estimated within MMRM.
Secondary Objectives
The PD endpoint is the absolute change in sweat chloride f rom baseline through the 
Day 29Visit. In Part 1, the null hypothesis of the lack of a decreasing dose -response trend in 
the mean absolute change from baseline through the Day 29 Visit for sweat chloride between 
the TC dose groups and placebo will be tested using a multiple comparisons procedure based 
on the 1-sided maximum t-statistic. The adjusted means and 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals 
of the average treatment effects through the Day 29 Visit, for all within -group and 
between -group comparisons, will be estimated within MMRM.
Interim 
AnalysesInterim analyses (IAs) may be conducted for any part of the study  after at least 50% of subjects 
in the part have completed the Day 15 Visit. Each IA will only include data for a single part of 
the study .
IDMC Reviews An independent monitoring committee (IDMC) will conduct safety reviews of study data as 
outlined in the IDMC charter.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information5 INTRODUCTION
5.1 Background
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive chronic disease with serious morbidit ies and 
frequent premature mortalit y. At present, there is no cure. CF affects approximately  
70,000 individuals worldwide1(approximately 30,000 in the US1,2and 32,000 in the European 
Unio n3). Based on its prevalence, CF qualifies as an orphan disease.4, 5
CF is caused by [CONTACT_731300]/or function of the CFTR protein due to mutations in the 
CFTR gene. The CFTR protein is an epi[INVESTIGATOR_731262], including 
the lungs, pancreas, and other gastrointestinal organs. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_731263], the predicted median age of survival for a person with CF is 
approximately  [ADDRESS_998899] comm on disease -causing CFTR mutation, F508del , 
accounts for 70% of the ident ified alleles in people with CF, with nearly half o f all peopl e with 
CF are ho mozygous f or F508del .
Based on the understanding of the mo lecular defects caused by [CONTACT_460395], 
2complementary  approaches have been developed to address the decreased quantit y and/or 
funct ion of CFTR in order to enhance chloride transport in pat ients with CF. Correctors facilitate 
the cellular processing and trafficking to increase the quant ity of functional CFTR at the cell 
surface. Potentiator s increase the channel open probabilit y of the CFTR protein delivered to the 
cell surface to enhance i on transport . Depending on the amount of residual CFTR channel 
activit y in the m embrane, and the pathophy siology of  that activit y (reflect ing the CFTR genotype 
of the pati ent and possibly  other factors), both approaches may  be requi red.
The therapeutic act ivity of CFTR correctors and potentiators has been established with products 
that were developed by [CONTACT_155413]: ivacaftor (IVA) 
monotherapy  (Kalydeco®), and l umacaftor (LUM) in combinat ion with IVA (Orkambi®).
Kalydeco and Orkambi are approved to treat CF in patients with specific CFTR genoty pes. 
Tezacaftor (TEZ; VX -661) i s a first -generation CFTR corrector that improves the processing and 
trafficking of the F508del -CFTR protein, result ing in an increase in the quant ity of 
F508del -CFTR protein at the cell surface. IVA increases the open -channel probabilit y of the 
F508del -CFTR protein that has been delivered to the cell surfac e by [CONTACT_460396], thereby [CONTACT_731301]. The combined effect of TEZ and IVA is increased quant ity and funct ion 
of F508del -CFTR at the cell surface.
Proto col VX16 -659-101, Version 3.[ADDRESS_998900] of TEZ. The CFTR 
protein delivered to the cell surface by [CONTACT_94273] -659 al one or in combinat ion with TEZ
(VX-659/TEZ) was potentiated by [CONTACT_312101].10In human bronchi al epi [INVESTIGATOR_018] (HBE) cells studied in 
vitro, the tri ple combinat ion (TC) of VX -659, TEZ, and IVA (VX -659/TEZ/IVA) increased 
CFTR chloride transport more than any o f the dual combinations (VX -659/TEZ, VX -659/IVA, 
and TEZ/IVA) or individual co mponents (VX -659, TEZ, and IVA) under most condit ions 
studi ed.10
VX-561 (also known as CTP-656and C -[ZIP_CODE] ) is a deuterated isotope of IVA wit h a specific 
pattern of [ADDRESS_998901] ion (MF) mutation that is not 
expected to respond to TEZ, IVA, orTEZ/IVA (F/MF genotypes) and ho mozygous f or F508del
(F/F genoty pe).
Data from nonclinical studies of VX -659, TEZ, IVA , and VX -561 and the current unmet medica l 
need for new treatments for CF support clinical development of VX -659 in combinat ion with 
other CFTR modulators for the treatment of CF.

equipment malfunct ion), it is acce ptable to use a sweat chloride value that was obtained 
before previous treatment with IVA, LUM/IVA, or an investigational CFTR modulator.
Part 2: For subjects with a sweat chloride value ≥60 mm ol/L at screening or documented 
in the form of a laboratory  report in the subject ’s medical record, medical mo nitor 
approval  is not required. For subjects with a sweat chloride value <60 mmo l/L at 
screening andno documented histori cal value ≥60 mm ol/L, m edical m onitor approval  is

If screening spi[INVESTIGATOR_731268] m eet acceptabilit y and repeatabilit y criteria as 
specified by [CONTACT_731304] y/European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_731269]13, repeat 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_731270].
Repeat ing individual screening assessment(s) that did not meet eligibilit y criteria is not 
permitted, with the fo llowing except ions that require the approval of the m edical m onitor:
If there is clear evidence of a damaged sample, laboratory  error, or equi pment m alfunct ion, 
collect ion of a repeat sample for the appropriate laboratory  test or assessment may  be 
permitted.
Exclusio nary liver funct ion tests result s, which may be retested once within 14 days o f the 
original  screening date.
Assessments required for eligibilit y that m ay be repeated as described in Sections 8.1
and8.2.
If repeat values of the individual assessment(s) are within the eligibilit y criteria and com pleted 
within the screening wi ndow, then the subject is eligible for the study .
[IP_ADDRESS] Rescreening
Subjects m ay only be rescreened wit h the approval of the medical mo nitor. If a subject is 
rescreened, all screening assessments will be repeated except for CFTR genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], FSH level 
(if serum  FSH level  was ≥40mIU/mL during prior screening), G6PD activit y test, and sweat

A subject m ay have the Screening Peri od window extended by  2weeks, wi thout m edical m onitor 
approval , for the fo llowing reasons:
Repetit ion of Screening Period assessments (Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
Unexpected operational or logist ic delays, or to meet the eligibilit y criteria
To enable a subject ’s eligibilit y for this study  to be determined before the subject 
discontinues previous CFTR modulator treatment (e.g., so that subjects can have screening 
assessments done while they  are continuing to receive CFTR modulator treatment but have a 
washout period of at least [ADDRESS_998912] 4 weeks before the Day  1 Vi sit in

9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to assign subjects to treatment. The

(an index o f disease severi ty) before the start of study  drug dosi ng. Therefore, randomizat ion in 
all parts will be stratified by [CONTACT_731306] 1values , defined as the last ppFEV 1
measurement before treatment with VX -659. For Part s1and 3 , this value is determined at 
screening, except for those subjects who require a Stratificat ion Visit, in which case the value is 
determined at that visit. For Part 2, the pretreatment ppFEV 1value is determined at the Day -14 
Visit during the Run -In Peri od.  
Control  Treatm ents
Part 1 and Part 3: Efficacy has not been demo nstrated for a corrector, potentiator, or any 
corrector/potentiator combinat ion in subjects wi th F/MF genoty pes. A Phase 3 study  of 
TEZ/IVA in subjects with F/MF genoty pes (Study VX14 -661-107) was terminated fo llowing a 
planned interim fut ility analysis, which showed that the combinat ion of TEZ/IVA did not result 
in a prespecified improvement in ppFEV 1. Because there is no effect ive treatment for this 
popul ation, a placebo arm will be included as the control in Part 1 and Part 3.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential InformationPart 2: A Phase 3 study  of TEZ/ IVA (Study  VX14 -661-106) demonstrated a clinically 
meaningful benefit in subjects with the F/F genotype16; therefore, TEZ/IVA is the act ive control.
Run-in Period
Part [ADDRESS_998924] a 4 -week run -in period to establish a reliable on -treatment (TEZ/IVA) baseline 
for com parison to Peri od 1, when subjects will addit ionally  receive VX -[ADDRESS_998925] acebo.
Period 2
Part 1 and Part 2 include a second dosing period (Period 2), during which subjects will be 
administered TEZ/IVA. In Part 1, Period 2 is4 days and is included to enable a more thorough 
evaluat ion of VX -659 exposure -response relationships by  [CONTACT_731307] -659 washout. In Part 2, Period 2 is 4 weeks to enable an assessment of PD and 
efficacy  endpoints after VX-659 i s washed out.
9.3.2 Study Drug Dose and Duration
VX-659 Dosage 
Part 1 will evaluate 3 dose levels of VX -659 in TC with TEZ/IVA in subjects with F/MF 
genoty pes. The high dose of VX -659 to be evaluated as part of the TC is 400 mg qd. In healt hy 
subjects in Study  VX16 -659-001, VX -659 m onotherapy  was shown to be safe and well tolerated 
at multiple doses up to 400 m g qd for 10 days, and VX -659 was safe and well tolerated at 
multiple doses up to 200 mg q12h in TC wit h TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h for 14 days .
The dose levels evaluated in Part 1 are expected to provide clinical benefit (based on in vitro 
data) and will provide a range of exposure for exposure -response analyses of efficacy and safet y. 
The TC -high dose will also be used in Part 2 and Part 3. Dos e-and exposure -response 
inform ation obtained for the TC in Part 1 (subjects with F/MF genoty pes) is expected to be 
applicable to other populations with F508del , including F/F, based on the similar potency  of the 
TC in HBE cells that have 1 copy  or 2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] F508del .10
TEZ Dosage
In all study  parts, the TEZ dosage will be 100 mg qd, which is the same total dosage evaluated in 
Phase 3 studies o f TEZ/IVA.
IVA Dosage
When administered in co mbinat ion with VX-659, the IVA dosage will be 150 mg q12h. A 
dosage of 150 mg q12h is being used in Pha se 3 studi es of  TEZ/IVA and is also the approved 
IVA m onotherapy  dosage for pati ents aged 12 y ears and ol der (150 mg q12h). 
VX-561Dosage
The VX-561 dosage will be 200 mg qd, based on preliminary PK and safet y resul ts for VX-561 
from Study  VX16 -770-018, which evaluated the relat ive bioavailabit y of the 50 -mg tablet of 
VX-561 being used in the current study , and Study VX16 -659-001, which is evaluat ing VX -561

[IP_ADDRESS] Safety and Tolerability
The primary  safety endpo int is the incidence of AEs. Approximately 105 subjects will be 
rando mized in the study with approximately 81 subjects receiving VX-659 in TC. The sample 
size for each treatment group will provide sufficient data for a descript ive analysis o f AEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy
The primary  efficacy  endpoint i s the abso lute change fro m baseline in ppFEV 1through the 
Day [ADDRESS_998971] 90% 
power to detect a mean within -group change of [ADDRESS_998972] for a 
decreasing dose -response trend between placebo and the TC dose groups will be performed 
using a mult iple co mpar isons procedure (MCP). The procedure consists of testing the null 
hypothesis of the lack of a decreasing dose -response trend versus a decreasing tr end using the 
1-sided maximum  t-statistic that controls the type I error at alpha = 5%. The procedure requires a 
family o f candi date dose -response models to be prespecified, that covers the range of plausible 
and diverse dose -response profiles. 
The candid ate m odels that best describe the expected decreasing dose -response profile of the TC 
groups com pared to pl acebo include a linear model, a maximum effect (E max) model, and a 
sigmoid E maxmodel. The contrasts (i.e., linear combinat ions of the treatment grou p means 
through the Day 29 Vi sit) selected to perform  the MCP and that capture the shape of these 
candidate models are described in Table 12-1.

[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Primary Efficacy Variables
The primary  efficacy  variable is the absol ute change from  baseline for ppFEV 1through the 
Day 29 Visi t in all parts. The analysis will be performed using a mixed -effects m odel for 
repeated m easures (MMRM) with change from baseline as the dependent variable. The model 
will include treatment group, visit, and treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects, subject as 
rando m effect, and the continuous baseline ppFEV 1as a covariate. The model will be est imated 
using restri cted m aximum likelihood. Denominator degrees of freedo m for the F test for fixed 
effects will be est imated using the Kenward -Roger approximat ion. An unstructured covariance 
structure will be used to model the within -subject errors to account for repeated measures within 
a subject. If the model est imation does not converge, a compound symmetry covariance structure 
will be used. Condit ional on observe d data and covari ates, missing data due to treatment or study

CONSIDERATIONS
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting
13.1.1 Adverse Events
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of an Adverse Event
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event 
does not necessarily  have a causal  relati onship wi th the treatm ent. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsen ing of a pre -exist ing condit ion (e.g., increase in its severit y or 
frequency ) after the ICF i s signed. 
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definit ion in Sect ion13.1.2.1 . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinically Significant Assessments
Study  assessments including laboratory  tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed to have clinically -significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an 
AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study  assessment will be provided, rather than the 
abnorm al test resul t alone (e.g., urinary tract infectio n, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, 
the abnormal study  assessment i tself will  be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglo bin).
An abnormal study  assessment is considered clinically  significant if the subject has 1 or more of  
the following:
Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study  assessment
Further di agnosti ctesting or m edical/surgical intervent ion
A change in the dose of study  drug or di scontinuat ion fro m the study
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any  of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically sig nificant criteria. The determinat ion of whether the 
study  assessment resul ts are clinically significant will be made by  [CONTACT_3170].
A laboratory  value that i s Grade [ADDRESS_998984] ’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Documentation of Adverse Events
All AEs will be co llected fro m the time ICF is signed until the fo llowing time points:
For subjects who do not enroll: unt il time of screen failure (e.g., screen fai lure, wi thdrawal  of 
consent)
For enrolled subjects who have a Safet y Follow-up Visit: through the Safety  Follow-up Vi sit

o28days after the l ast dose of study  drug, or
othe ETT Visit, if that visit is [ADDRESS_998985] dose of study  drug (see 
Secti on9.1.6 ).
All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questi ons, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study  visit. When possible, a constellat ion of signs and/or symptoms will be ident ified as 
1overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the CRF and 
source document. AEs for s ubjects who are screened but not subsequently enro lled in the study  
will be recorded only in the subject ’s source documents. The fo llowing data will be documented 
for each AE:
Descript ion of the event
Classificat ion of “serious”or “nonseri ous”
Date of first occurrence and date of reso lution (if applicable)
Severit y
Causal relat ionship to study  drug(s) 
Action taken 
Outcom e 
Concomitant medicat ion or other treatment given
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Severity
The invest igator will determine and record the severit y of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Commo n Termino logy Cri teria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03, Cancer Therapy Evaluat ion Program , 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applicat ions/ctc.htm (Accessed 
August 2015 ). AEs of CTCAE Grades 4 and 5 will be documented as “life-threatening. ”In 
considering the severit y of an AE in a pediat ric subject, the invest igator will consider that 
reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory  param eters m ay differ f rom those given in the 
CTCAE. The severit y of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according 
to the definit ionsin Table 13-1.

Classification Definition
Mild (Grade 1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities
Moderate (Grade 2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities
Severe (Grade 3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities
Life-threatening (Grade 4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death

Table 13-[ADDRESS_998986] been ruled out, 
and/o r the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.
Possibly related There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such 
as characteristics of the subject ’s clinical status or underlying disease.
Unlikely related The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug. 
Not related The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential InformationTable 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE
Classification Definition
Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal ”will be used when death is at least possibly 
related to the AE.
Unknown Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g., a subject lost to follow -up)
AE: adverse event
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Given
The invest igator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory  values rel ated to study  drug. In addi tion, the invest igator will 
describe whether any  treatm ent was given for the AE. “Yes”is used if any treatment was given 
in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medicat ions, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
surgery , or physical therapy. “No”indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE.
13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of a Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is any  AE that m eets any  of the f ollowing outcom es:
Fatal  (death, regardl ess of cause, that occurs during participat ion in the study  or occurs after 
participat ion in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicit y due to administration of 
the study  drug)
Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred 
Inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_731292]
Persi stent or si gnificant disabilit y/incapacit y (disabi lity is defined as a substant ial disrupt ion 
of a person ’s abili ty to conduct norm al life f unctions)
Congenital ano maly or bi rth defect
Important m edical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgi cal interventi on to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring int ensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at hom e) 
If a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_731293] (e.g., surgery ) for an event or condit ion tha t 
occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_731294], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_731295], unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_731296]. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_731297] (e.g., social hospi [INVESTIGATOR_731298]) will not be 
considered to indicate an SAE.
Clarificat ion will be made between the terms “serious ”and “severe ”because they  are not 
synonymous. The term “severe ”is often used to describe the intensit y (severi ty) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe my ocardial  infarcti on. The event i tself, howe ver, may  be 
of relatively minor m edical  significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as 
Proto col VX16 -659- 101, Version 3.0 Page 63of 74
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information“serious,”which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually  
associ ated wi th events that pose a threat to a subject ’s life or funct ioning. Seriousness, not 
severit y, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory  reporting obligat ions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Documentation of Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent through the Safet y Follow-up Visi t, 
regardless of causalit y, will be reported by  [CONTACT_731326]. In addit ion, all SAEs 
that occur after the Safet y Follow-up Vi sit and are considered rel ated to study  drug(s) will be 
reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours .
SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safet y Inform ation Co llection Form  (hereafter 
referred to as the “SAE Form ”) using a recogni zed medical term or diagnosis that accurately  
reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by  [CONTACT_17062] f or rel ationship to the invest igational 
study  drug(s) and possible et iologies. On the SAE Form, relat ionship to study  drug(s) will be 
assessed only  as rel ated (incl udes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and 
severit y assessment will not be required. For the purpos es of study  analysis, if the event has not 
resolved at the end of the study  reporti ng period, i t will be documented as ongoing. For purposes 
of regul atory  safety  monitoring, the invest igator is required to fo llow the event to resolut ion and 
report to Verte x the outcome o f the event using the SAE Form.
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious Adverse Events
The invest igator is responsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of i dentifying an SAE, 
regardl ess of the presumed relationship to the investigat ional study  drug. The SAE Form will be 
completed for new/init ial events as well as to report fo llow-up inform ation on previously 
reported events. Invest igators are asked to report follow -up inform ation as soon as it becomes 
available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities.

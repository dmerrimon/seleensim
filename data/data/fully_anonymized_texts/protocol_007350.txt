[CONTACT_334771] t o the following practice parameters:  
• Biopsies will be collected from ambulatory nmDMD  subjects; a subject population that are 
more likely to have greater amounts of intact muscle cells compared with older, non-ambulatory patients with nmDMD.  
• A total of no more than approximately 450 mg of muscle tissue (up to  cores per muscle)  
will be co llected from the  and  . If the  muscle 
is considered by [CONTACT_671684], the  
 muscle may be used . 
• Two validated, highly sensitive assays, ie, ECL and immunohistochemistry, will be used to measure dystrophin protein levels and to evaluate whether the protein localizes correctly to 
the muscle membrane.

Clinical Protocol  
V2.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 12 of 39 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Disease Background  
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare, debilitating, progressive, and ultimately fatal 
childhood disease ( Bushby 2010a , Bushby 2010b). It is an X-linked genetic muscle disorder 
that re sults from a mutation in the dystrophin gene. Dystrophin is a 427 kDa structural 
protein present at the muscle sarcolemma that provides stability to the muscle and is expressed in skeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and cardiac muscle ( Bushby 2010a , Mah 2016, Rae 2016). 
It is also expressed in neurons in specific parts of the brain, such as the hippocampus (Aartsma -Rus 2016).  
Dystrophin acts as a shock absorber during muscle contraction by [CONTACT_671687] (Aartsma -Rus 2016). Consequently, dystrophin bears the mechanical stresses that occur 
during muscle contraction, st abilizing muscle cell membranes, and protecting muscles from 
injury ( Petrof 1993). Dystrophin mutations disrupt the connection with the actin cy toskeleton 
and connective tissue resulting in chronic muscle damage, inflammation, and eventually replacement of muscle fibers by [CONTACT_671688] ( Muntoni 2003). The culmination of muscle function loss 
leads to early death;  the average life expectancy  of DMD patients is about 25 years of age. 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy is noticeable in young children, who typi[INVESTIGATOR_671673] (Bushby 2010a ). Muscle function continues to deteriorate in pre- adolescence resulting in the 
loss of gross motor functions, including the ability to rise from the floor, to climb stairs, and to walk. Complete loss of ambulation typi[INVESTIGATOR_671674]. Loss of functional abilities occur sequentially, with the loss of one function preceding and predicting the loss of subsequent functions. Importantly, the age at loss of ambulation is predictive of the age of  onset of severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_5448] (forced vital capacity [FVC] <1 liter) 
requiring the need for ventilation assistance ( Humbertclaude 2012 ), which in turn is 
predictive of death within 3 years ( Phillips 2001). 
To date, no medications cure or reverse the effects of DMD. The goals of current 
interventions are to help slow or stabilize disease progression, prolong patients’ ability to manage activities of daily living, and delay the onset of subsequent deterioration. Recent clinical guidelines recommend treatment with glucocorticoids, which  address the 
inflammatory component of the disease, and have beneficial effects on prolonging ambulation and muscle and respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806] ( Bushby 2010a , Bushby 2010b). Additional 
treatments are necessary, particularly those that treat the underlying cause of the disease.  
Because of the role of the dystrophin protein, dystrophin restoration therapy would be expected to stabilize or slow disease progression in patients with DMD. 
Approximately 10% to 15% of boys with DMD have the disease due to a nonsense mutation 
in the dystrophin gene ( Aartsma -Rus 2006, Bladen 2015), resulting in a premature stop 
codon in the dystrophin mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid). Consequently, ribosomal 
PTC124- GD-046-DMD  
Clinical Protocol  
V2.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 13 of 39 translation of nonsense codon containing mRNA results in premature ter mination of 
translation before a full -length, functional protein is generated. 
1.2 Ataluren  
Ataluren  is a small molecule being developed for the treatment of nonsense mutation 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (nmDMD). Ataluren promotes ribosomal readthrough of 
premature stop codons enabling the formation of full-length, functional dystrophin protein (Welch 2007 ).   
The efficacy and safety of ataluren for the treatment of nmDMD were assessed in 
2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-- controlled, 48- week trials ( PTC124- GD-007- DMD 
[[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]] [Study 007] and  PTC124- GD-020- DMD [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]] [Study 020]). 
Data from these studies supported conditional marketing authorization of ataluren for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged ≥ 5 years in Europe and subsequently 
extended to ≥2 years of age base d on pharmacokinetic extrapolation from study 
PTC124- GD 030- DMD.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of ataluren is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
1.2.1 Ataluren -associated increased ribosomal readthrough of premature stop 
codons 
The ability of ataluren to promote ribosomal readthrough of premature stop codons has been evaluated in a wide range of in vivo and in vitro preclinical experiments, including differ ent 
organ and animal model systems, as well as cell -free and cell -based systems. In particular, 
preclinical studies in the mdx mouse and the sapje  zebrafish nmDMD models and human 
myotubes consistently demonstrate that ataluren increases dystrophin production across key tissues, including skeletal muscle, heart, and diaphragm.  
Production of dystrophin from ataluren treatment was also investigated in nmDMD patients 
in the Phase 2a PTC124- GD-004-DMD study (Study 004) ( Finkel 2013 ). In this trial, 
38 nmDMD patients received treatme nt with ataluren for 28 days. Results from the proof of 
concept study indicate that ataluren treatment leads to production of full-length dystrophin protein; post-treatment increases in dystrophin were quantified in 61% (23/38) of the patients. The mean change in muscle biopsy dystrophin expression from baseline to Day 28 was 11 % (p=0.008). In addition, immunohistochemistry experiments indicated the protein 
was correctly localized to membranes of muscle cells, suggesting functional activity. Myotubes derived from pre- treatment muscle biopsies were cultured in vitro in the presence 
of ataluren  and 100% of the samples showed increases in dystrophin expression. Dystrophin 
expression was also evaluated in Study 007 in which nmDMD patients were treated with ataluren or placebo. Results from Study 007 we re also supportive of an increase in 
dystrophin levels, consistent with Study 004 results. The increase in dystrophin levels in the two prior clinical studies are limited by [CONTACT_671689] a non-validated immunofluorescence method of detecting dystrophin protein.

Clinical Protocol  
V2.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 14 of 39 1.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Under the current standard of care, nmDMD remains a disease with devastating 
consequences and bleak prognosis. The progressive and irreversible effects of nmDMD underscore the importance of early intervention with treatments that have the potential to slow physical deterioration and delay the natural course of this fatal disease. While treatment with corticosteroids target the inflammatory component of the disease, additional treatments are needed to address the loss of dystrophin, the underlying cause of the disease.  
The mechanism by [CONTACT_671690]. Moreover, the clinical benefit of ataluren has been demonstrated in two large randomized controlled trials Study [ADDRESS_907474] been receiving ataluren for ≥[ADDRESS_907475]. The use of two highly sensitive validated assays to evaluate 
dystrophin protein levels will increase the likelihood that each muscle biopsy sample  will 
yield interpretable results. Hence, the study design and the import ance of establishing the 
association  of ataluren  treatment with dystrophin expression results in a positive risk/benefit.

3.[ADDRESS_907481] of ataluren on promoting the 
production of dystrophin protein in nmDMD subjects. It is known that even  small increases 
in dystrophin levels can result in milder disease phenotype in nmDMD patients. The levels of dystrophin in patients with Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) have been reported to be higher than that observed in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD) 
(Anthony 2014). Consequently, patients with BMD generally have less severe disease 
compared with those with DMD; BMD patients often show a later onset of diseas e and 
slower disease progression ( Muntoni 2003, Aartsma -Rus 2006). 
As described in Section 1.2.1, the ability of ataluren to promote ribosomal readthrough of premature stop codons has been demonstrated in a range of in vivo and in vitro preclinical assays. In addition, ataluren-associated increases in dystrophin protein levels was assessed in a prior clinical study . Of patients treated with ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg, 55% (8/20) had an 
increase in dystrophin expression post- ataluren treatment ( Finkel 2013). The findings from 
this study were consistent with ataluren treatment increasing dystrophin levels and indicated that the protein correctly localized to the muscle cell membranes, suggesting functional activity ( Finkel 2013).  
Assessing dystrophin levels in patients with nmDMD can be challenging due to inherent difficulty in obtaining muscle samples that contain sufficient amounts of intact muscle cells for analysis, as nmDMD muscle, particularly in older patients, are often heterogenous with 
respect to fibrofatty replacement of muscle.  
From prior clinical trial experience, it is anticipated that although levels or dystrophin may increase in nmDMD muscle f rom baseline following ataluren therapy, the amount of 
dystrophin will still be low; hence, sensitive assays with good specificity are necessary to evaluate change in dystrophin levels with treatment.

introduced by [CONTACT_58833] a bilateral muscle sampled from one side of the body before treatment and from the other side after treatment.  
This current study is designed to mitigate some of these difficulties.  
● Biopsies will be collected from ambulatory nmDMD subjects who have grade 1 or 2 of the Brook Upper Extremity Scale ( Brooke 1989, Connolly 2015) to increase 
the chance of collecting less heterogenous muscle tissue. 
● A total of no more than appr oximately 450 mg of muscle tissue (u p to  cores per 
muscle ) will be collected from the  and  . If 
the  muscle is considered by [CONTACT_671693], the  muscle may be used . 
● Two validated, highly sensitive assays will be employed to measure ataluren -
associated increases in dystrophin protein levels and to evaluate whether the protein localizes correctly to the muscle membrane.

6 STUDY INTERVENTION 
6.1 Study Intervention(s) A dministration  
Not applicable as not an interventional study. 6.2 Concomitant Therapy 
Including ataluren, any treatments ( ie, prescription and non-prescription drugs, health foods, 
herbal remedies, self -prescribed drugs, street drug, tobacco products, or alcohol) that are taken 
by a subject for one month prior to study enrollment and during Visit 1 are consi dered 
concomitant medications. Information regarding any concom itant medications will be 
collected and documented in the electronic case report form (e CRF ) and in the source 
documents by [CONTACT_46683].  
To the extent possible, administration of any prescription or over -the-counter drug products 
should be minimized during the study period. Subjects should be discouraged from use of 
“health supplements” (eg, creatine, glutamine, coenzyme Q), herbal remedies, growth hormone, self -prescribed drugs, at any time during clinical studies of ataluren.   
If consider ed necessary for the subject’s well -being, drugs for concomitant medical conditions 
or for symptom management may be given at the discretion of the investigator. The decision to authorize the use of any other drug(s) should consider the subject ’s safety, t he medical need, 
the potential  for drug interactions, the possibility for masking symptoms of a more relevant 
underlying event, and whether use of a concomitant medication will compromise the outcome or integrity of the study.   
Subjects and parents/caregivers or legal guardian should be instructed about the importance 
of the need to inform the clinic staff of the use of any drugs or remedies (whether prescribed, over-the-counter, or illicit) before and during the course of the study.

V2.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 23 of 39 7.2 Safety Assessments and Other Assessments  
Subjects will be monitored closely for AEs and laboratory abnormalities during the study. 
For AEs  and laboratory abnormalities, the investigator should use his/her judgment in 
determining whether the event or abnormality is clinically significant, whether diagnostic 
evaluation is warranted, and whether potential interruption of study drug therapy is appropriate. In general, life- threatening (Grade 4) or severe (Grade 3) AEs  or laboratory 
abnormalities should be considered clinically significant, although recurrent or persistent moderate events (Grade 2) may also be considered clinically significant in certain circumstances. Reference should be made to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.[ADDRESS_907488] 
review of the case with gastroenterology, endocrinology, nephrology consultants or with other experts (either at the site or retained by [CONTACT_314216]).  
7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
7.3.1 Definition of adverse events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease in a study subject who is enrolled  in this study. 
For this protocol, untoward medical occurrences that should be reported as AEs  include the 
following: 
● All AEs  relat ing to the muscle biopsy 
● Apparently unrelated illnesses, including worsening of a preexisting illness 
● Injury or accidents. Note that if a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or accident (a fall secondary to dizziness), the medical condition (dizziness) and the accident (fall) should be reported as 2 separate AEs. The outcome of the accident (hip fracture secondary to the fall) should be recorded in source documents . 
PTC124- GD-046-DMD  
Clinical Protocol  
V2.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 24 of 39 ● Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination findings that 
require clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory] test)  
● Laboratory that require clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory] test) unless they are associated with an already reported clinical event. Laboratory abnormalities associated with a clinical event should be captured in the source documents. Laboratory abnormalities not requiring clinical intervention or further investigation will be captured as part of overall laboratory monitoring and should not be reported as AEs . 
● A preexisting condition (eg, allergic rhinitis) must be noted on the appropriate eCRF for Visit 1 ; however, it should not be reported as an AE unless the condition 
worsens or epi[INVESTIGATOR_245926]. Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as AEs . However, the medical condition for which the 
procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis that occurs during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded in the source documents and eCRF. If a surgical procedure was planned prior to entry into the study, and the surgery is not performed because of a worsening of a baseline condition, this should not be reported as an AE. Note that, as described in Section  7.3.2 any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_671675] a serious adverse event ( SAE). 
Each AE is to be classified as serious or non-serious by [CONTACT_671694].  
7.3.[ADDRESS_907489] associated with the use of a study drug at any dose, regardless of whether it is considered to be related to the study drug, which results in one of the following: 
● Results in death. This includes all deaths that occurred within 30 days of Visit 1 , 
including deaths due to disease progression. Any death occurring later than 30 days following Visit 1 need not be reported as an SAE unless it is a result of an 
event that star ted within the period covered by [CONTACT_21639]-study definition. The 
reported AE should be the event that caused the death. In addition, any AE resulting in death that occurs subsequent to the AE reporting period and that the investigator assesses as possibly rel ated to the muscle  biopsy procedure should 
also be reported as serious. 
● Is life -threatening. This refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death 
at the time of the event. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe for m, hypothetically might have caused death. 
PTC124- GD-046-DMD

V2.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 25 of 39 ● Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (excluding 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314186], procedures required by [CONTACT_4690], or treatment-related diagnostic procedures; other planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]; or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314187]). Treatments in the emergency room for procedures such as hydration that do not require admitting the subject to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_671676] 24 hours do not fall into this category. 
● Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, not related to cancer. 
● Any other medically important event that the investigator or the sponsor judges to be serious or which is defined as serious by [CONTACT_314219]. These are AEs that might not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_331979]. Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an AE is serious based on above definition. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_907490]/parent(s)/legal guardian/legally acceptable representative. In addition, each study subject/parent(s)/legal guardian/legally acceptable representative will be questioned about AEs  at each scheduled clinic visit after study drug administration or during any 
telephone contact [CONTACT_1155]/parent(s)/legal guardian/legally acceptable representative. The type of question asked should be open-ended, for example, “ How have you been 
feeling ?” or a similar type of query. 
7.3.4 Recording Non‑serious A Es and SAEs  
All AEs (both serious and non- serious) which are not related to the muscle biopsy that occur 
in subjects during the AE reporting period must be recorded in the e CRF  of the ataluren 
nmDMD trial in which the subject was recruited from. Those events considered related to the muscle biopsy should be reported to the Study 046. In addition, any known untoward event that occurs subsequent to the AE reporting period that the investigator ass esses as related to 
the muscle biopsy procedure should also be recorded as an AE in Study 046. 
All A Es are to be recorded in the source documents and on the eCRF using concise medical 
terminology; whenever possible, terms contained in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) should be employed. In addition, the following information should be recorded:  
● Indication of whether the event is serious or non- serious (see Section  7.3.2) 
● Relationship to study procedure (see Section  7.3.5)  
PTC124- GD-046-DMD

V2.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 26 of 39 ● Severity of the event (see Section  7.3.6) 
● Onset date  
● Resolution date, or date of death 
● Action taken  
● Outcome of the event  
Classification of the event as serious or non-serious determines the reporting procedures to 
be followed. 
7.3.5 Describing adverse event relationship to muscle biopsy  procedure 
The investigator should provide an assessment of the relationship of the AE to the study 
muscle biopsy, ie, whether there is a reasonable possibil ity that the muscle biopsy procedure 
caused the AE, using the considerations outlined in Table 2 . 
Table 2. Relationship of Study Muscle Biopsy  Procedure to Adverse Event  
 Description  
Probable  A clinical event in which a relationship to the study  muscle  biopsy  procedure seems 
probable because of such factors as consistency with known effects of the muscle 
biopsy  procedure, a clear temporal association with the muscle biopsy  procedure; or 
lack of alternative explanations for the event.  
Possible  A clinical event occurring coincident with the muscle biopsy  procedure and which may 
or may not be explained by [CONTACT_671695].  
Unlikely  A clinical event with a temporal relationship to the study muscle biopsy  procedure that 
does not preclude causality but for which there is a clear alternate cause that is more 
likely to have caused the adverse event than the procedure. Such alternatives in clude 
a concomitantly administered drug, the subject’s disease state, other medical 
conditions, or environmental factors.  
Unrelated  A clinical event, for which a relationship to the study muscle biopsy  procedure seems 
improbable because of factors such as inconsistency with known effects of the muscle 
biopsy  procedure, lack of a temporal association with the muscle biopsy  procedure, 
and/or presence of alternative explanations for the event. Alternative explanations might include a known relationship of the adverse event to a concomitant drug, 
medical history of a similar event, the subject’s disease state, other medical conditions, 
or environmental factors.  
7.3.[ADDRESS_907491], the investigator should use the grade or adjectives: 
Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate ), Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life -threatening), or Grade 5 
(fatal) to describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of consistency with the CTCAE, these severity  grades are defined in  Table [ADDRESS_907492]’s 
overall health and well -being, does not interfere with the subject’s 
usual function, and is not likely to require medical atten tion  
Grade 2  Moderate  Sign or symptom causes interference with usual activity or affects 
clinical status, and may require medical intervention  
Grade 3  Severe  Sign or symptom is incapacitating or significantly affects clinical 
status and likely requ ires medical intervention and/or close follow -up  
Grade 4  Life-threatening  Sign or symptom results in a potential threat to life  
Grade 5  Fatal  Sign or symptom results in death  
7.3.7 Adverse Event Reporting  
Investigator site reporting requirements for AEs  are summarized in  Table 4 and Table 5 .

Abbreviations : AE, adverse event; eCRF, electronic case report form; SAE, serious adverse event  
All AEs  should be followed up by [CONTACT_671696], or the investigator 
assesses them as chronic or stable. The investigator should consider protocol guidelines and 
use his/her discretion in ordering additional tests as necessary to monitor the resolution of such events. In the event of additional investigations, the PTC Therapeutics Pharmacovigilance Department or designee should be informed via e-mail or fax. A subject withdrawn from the study because of an AE must be followed by [CONTACT_671697], or until progression has been stabilized. Follow up may need to continue after the subject has discontinued from the study, and additional investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_671698].  
The first day of AE reporting will coincide with the date of signing of Informed Consent and including a minimum of 30 calendar days after Visit 1 .

Clinical Protocol  
V2.0 PTC Therapeutics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 28 of 39 7.3.8 Serious adverse event reporting  
All SAEs should be reported via the SAE report form to PTC Therapeutics within 24 hours 
of becoming aware of the event(s). In addition, the AE portion of the eCRF must also be completed.  
The SAE report form should be signed by [CONTACT_093]; however, if the investigator is unable to sign at the time of the event or within 24 hours, the form should be signed by [CONTACT_671699] (eg, the study coordinator). The SAE report form must be faxed or e- mailed to the PTC Therapeutics Pharmacovigilance Depar tment or 
designee and to the site IRB/EC (if required by [CONTACT_427]) within 24 hours. 
Follow-up information to the SAE should be clearly documented as “follow-up” in the SAE 
report form and must also be faxed or e- mailed to the same party. All follow -up SAE report 
forms for the event must be signed by [CONTACT_093]. Any source documents (eg, progress notes, nurses’ notes, laboratory and diagnostic test results, discharge summaries) provided to the sponsor should be redacted so that the subject’s name, address, and other personal identity information are obscured. Only the subject’s study number and initials are to be provided (in regions where the provision of such information is permitted). The information in the AE portion of the eCRF and the SAE report form(s) must match or be reconciled. Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE term should be used on both forms. 
In the rare event that the investigator does not become awa re of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately (for example, if a subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is 
to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and to document his/her first awareness of the AE.

CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations 
9.1.1 Informed consent process  
By [CONTACT_12142], the investigator assures that informed consent/assent will be obtained from each parent/legal guardian prior to study entry and that the informed consent/assent will be obtained in accordance with current  regulations. 
The investigator or sub-investigator will give each parent/legal guardian full and adequate verbal and written information regarding the objectives and procedures of the study and the possible risks involved. An informed consent/assent document will be provided to each parent/legal guardian in a language in which the parent/legal guardian is fluent. This information must be provided to the parent/legal guardian prior to undertaking any study related procedure. Adequate time should be provided for the parent/legal guardian to read the informed consent, to understand the risks and benefits of participating in the study, and to ask any questions that the parent/legal guardian may have about the study. The parent/legal guardian should be able to ask additional questions as and when needed during the conduct of the study. Where applicable, the subject will sign an age-appropriate assent form. 
Each parent/legal guardian will be given a copy of the signed consent/assent form. The 
original signed informed consent forms will be retained by [CONTACT_671701].

These same samples will potentially be used to look at biochemical biomarkers that may be 
altered due to increased dystrophin levels  and to generate new hypotheses (eg, identify 
factors involved in disease progression and identify possible new drug targets). No additional genetic testing will be performed  or cell lines created. The results will be communicated to 
PTC Therapeutics.  
The subject/parent/caregiver will provide confirmation to allow any remaining specimens to be used for exploratory research work by [CONTACT_671704]  (ICF) . The ICF will contain a separate authorization for the use of remain ing tissue for 
exploratory research. Subjects/parents/caregivers  will be told that participation in exploratory 
research  is optional and that they can decline participation in this research. 
Subjects/parents/caregivers  may withdraw their consent and request disposal of their stored 
sample s at any time  and for any reason during the storage period. 
No subject-identifying information (eg, initials, date of birth, government identifying number) will be associated wit h any of the biologic samples. All  samples will be single 
coded and the sponsor will take steps to ensure that data are protected accordingly, and confidentiality is maintained to the extent possible.  
Given  the research nature of the analysis, it will not be possible to return individual data to 
subjects. The results that may be generated are not currently anticipated to have clinical 
relevance to the patients or their family members. Therefore, these results will not be disclosed to the patients or their physicians.

periodically inspect all eCRFs, study documents, research facilities, and clinical laboratory facilities associated with this study at mutually convenient times, before, during, and after completion of the study. As required by [CONTACT_5279] (Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators), the monitoring visits provide PTC Therapeutics with the opportunity to evaluate the progress of the study; verify the accuracy and completeness of data in the eCRFs; ensure that all protocol requirements, relevant regulations, and investigator’s obligations are being fulfilled; and resolve any inc onsistencies in the stu dy records. This 
includes inspection of all documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_737], including but not limited to medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) for the subjects in this study. The names and  identities of all research subjects will be kept in strict 
confidence and will not appear on eCRFs or other records provided to or retained by [CONTACT_314216]. The investigator/institution guarantees direct access to source documents by [CONTACT_314247]. 
It is important that the investigator and relevant institutional personnel are available during 
the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.  
9.1.6 Quality ass urance and quality control  
To ensure compliance with GCP  (Good Clinical Practice)  and all applicable regulatory 
requirements, PTC, PTC’s representatives, a regulatory authority or and Institutional Review board may conduct a quality assurance audit. Reason s for quality assurance audit may 
include but are not limited to: random selection, geographic proximity, suspected GCP violation, high enrolling site, recurring protocol deviations, etc. The purpose of a Sponsor audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study- related activities 
and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according  to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines of the International Council for Harmonisation, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_12559] a regulatory agency about an inspection.

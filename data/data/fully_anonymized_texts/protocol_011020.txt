 The Institute of Medicine report, From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivors: Lost in Transition,
[ADDRESS_1269752] serious impediments to providing information and coaching/support 
because of the lack of staff time and insurance reimbursement.23,[ADDRESS_1269753] -paced clinical patient -provider interactions leaves little time for health care providers 
to provide up- to-date information and coaching or support for these women based on their 
cultural attitudes.12–16 All these circumstances necessitat e an innovative and creative delivery 
method of information and coaching/support.  
 
A technology- based approach using computers and mobile devices (smart phones and tablets) 
promises to meet this necessity with high flexibility and accessibility, and minimizes the cost 
of the intervention in busy health care settings.25–[ADDRESS_1269754] cancer is still a stigmatizing experience.28–31, 32 –[ADDRESS_1269755] cancer survivors, 
especially for Asian Americans.36–45  Therefore, based on Preliminary Studies (PSs), the 
research team has developed an d pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -tested a theory -driven technology -based information 
and coaching/support program that: (a) is tailored to Asian American breast cancer survivors 
by [CONTACT_904605]- ethnic groups cultural attitudes from PSs; (b) 
uses mult iple languages; (c) provides both group and individual (real -time and personalized) 
coaching/support by [CONTACT_904606]; (d) incorporates peer support through a social media function; and (e) integrates existing general a nd culture -specific 
evidence -based educational content from scientific authorities. Among over 71 sub- ethnic 
Version date: 6 /3/2020  groups of Asian Americans,46 only three sub- ethnic groups (Chinese, Korean, and Japanese) 
were selected for the program development for the conveni ence of the approach (e.g., 
language). Within Asian Americans, Chinese are the largest sub -ethnic group,47,[ADDRESS_1269756] cancer.1,2,11,49 
 
Goals/Aims  
The purpose of the proposed randomized intervention study is to test the efficacy of the 
technology- based information and coaching/support program for Asian American breast 
cancer survivors (TICAA) in enhancing the women’s breast cancer survivor ship experience.  
 The specific aims  of the study are to:  
 
Aim 1 . Determine whether the intervention group (who uses the TICAA and the information 
on breast cancer by [CONTACT_9422] [ACS]) will show significantly greater improvements than the control group (who uses only the information on breast cancer by [CONTACT_904607]) in primary outcomes  of the TICAA ( needs for help, physical and psychological 
symptoms , and quality of life ) from baseline ( pre-test) to Time Points 1 (post 1- month; 
primary) and 2 (post 3- months; secondary) . 
 
Aim 2 . Identify theory -based variables  (attitudes , self-efficacy , perceived barriers , and social 
influences related to breast cancer survivorship ) that mediate the intervention effects of the 
TICAA on the primary outcomes of the TICAA from baseline to Time Point 1. 
 
Aim 3 (exploratory) . Explor e whether the effects of the TICAA on the primary outcomes are 
moderated  by [CONTACT_904608] . 
 
 
Study Design  
o Organizational structure of the study team:  
 
This is a PI [INVESTIGATOR_548392] R01 research project that is funded by [CONTACT_29630] 
(National Institute of Health).  Due to PI's move from Duke University to Emory University, the study is being transferred from Duke Univ. to Emory University. This is the fourth year of the total 5 year of funding. This IRB approval is needed for the grant transfer.  
 
Version date: 6 /3/[ADDRESS_1269757] the study at School of Nursing, Emory 
University. 
 
  
o Setting and location:  
The settings of the study will include (a) online support groups including social media groups 
and (b) communities/groups for Asian Americans. Over 400,[ADDRESS_1269758] become an important resource 
for researchers investigating cancer survivors residing in different geographic areas, both 
nationally and internationally.60-62 Furtherm ore, potential participants could be easily recruited 
through the recruitment announcement services provided by [CONTACT_114198] (a fee is usually 
required though). For example, through a Facebook announcement, Altshuler et al.63 recruited 
women from multi- ethnic groups (within 3 months) for a study on attitudes toward abortion. 
Yet, PSs also suggested that ethnic minority cancer survivors might not be easily recruited only through online support groups. Thus, communities/groups for Asian Americans (e.g., churc hes, 
organizations, health care centers, and professional groups, all of which are for Asian 
Americans) will also be targeted, which allows to recruit those who do not use online support 
groups or who do not have access to the computers. Ethnic minorities are more successfully recruited in churches and support/social groups with culturally specific memberships.
64 When 
communities/groups for Asian Americans in the U.S. were searched with Google, 1,170,000 
communities/groups were retrieved, each with up to 30,298 members. In addition to these major 
recruitment settings, cancer registries throughout the nation (e.g., [LOCATION_007] and [LOCATION_004]) will be 
contact[CONTACT_904609], which will be used for identifying and reaching out to potential 
participants to send the study announcement and informed consent . 
o Population to be studied:  
The participants will be [ADDRESS_1269759] cancer diagnosis ; can  read and write English, Mandarin Chinese, Korean, or 
Japanese; and have access to the Internet through computers or mobile devices (smart phones and 
tablets). A total of [ADDRESS_1269760] 
complet ed their participation before the PI’s move. A total of [ADDRESS_1269761] a low level of fatigue, those 
with a medium or high levels of fatigue would be more likely to need support through technology-based programs. We excluded those under 21 years old because their cancer experience would be 
different from adults .’ An upper age limit was not set because elderly could be a good target group 
for technology- based programs because technology- based programs do not require physical 
Version date: 6 /3/[ADDRESS_1269762] 
cancer.2 Because using more than four languages is infeasible in a study ([CONTACT_904635], Personal 
Communication), and given the diversity of Asian Americans, only four languages incl uding 
English, Mandarin Chinese, Korean, and Japanese will be used. Mandarin Chinese is a primary 
language in China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong; Korean is the primary language in South Korea; and Japanese is the primary language in Japan.  
 
o Recruitment: 
First, Internet searches will be conducted using multiple search engines including Google, Yahoo!, 
and Bing to identify/verify online support groups and communities/groups for Asian Americans. Then, we will contact [CONTACT_904610] 100 online s upport groups and 90 
communities/groups for Asian Americans (30 for each sub- ethnic group) on the verified lists to 
post the study announcement on their sites or listservs and through instant messaging. We will also make supplementary/additional announceme nts through Web postings, listservs, and regular 
meetings with communities/groups that primarily serve Asian Americans of low SES to have an adequate number of Asian American breast cancer survivors from low SES (they are less likely to 
be recruited than t hose from middle or high SES in PSs). The communities/groups that primarily 
serve Asian American women of low SES will be identified through both Internet searches and 
recommendations by [CONTACT_904611]. All the identified commu nities/groups will be contact[CONTACT_904612]. Further recommendations will be sought from the communities/groups that are contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. Then, the study will be announced in the newly identified communities/groups. If we do not recruit the target number, the study will be announced through an additional 20 online support groups and 30 communities/ groups for Asian Americans (10 per sub- ethnic group) each month. This pr ocess will be continued until the target number is 
recruited. In addition, we will utilize the cancer registries throughout the nation to contact [CONTACT_904613].  
A total of [ADDRESS_1269763] 
(assuming a uniform distribution) using an estimated effect size equal to 1/[ADDRESS_1269764] that 0.5*SD is a statistically meaningful effect size to assume.  
Sample size is based on 80% power, and a type I error rate equal to 0.[ZIP_CODE] to account for eight 
primary outcome measures modeled within the two primary aims (group main effects). Accordingly, group sample sizes of 105 each achieve 80% power to detect a difference of 0.5*SD between group means overall in a single follow -up period. The primary analysis  will be an 
assessment of differences by [CONTACT_904614] 1, or one month post intervention.  A secondary analysis will include similar modeling for sustainability of 
Version date: 6 /3/2020  intervention effects, or for changes from baseli ne to Time Point 2. Assuming an attrition rate of 
35% by [CONTACT_904615] 2, [ADDRESS_1269765] cancer survivors would be an adequate 
number for the study with multiple outcomes. Considering the attrition rates reported in the 
literature66–68 and in P Ss, the assumption of a 35% attrition rate is reasonable. 
At the completion of their participation, the participants will be reimbursed with $50 electronic gift cards for their participation.  The reimbursement will be prorated. The participants will be 
allowed to choose “do not want to respond”, which will NOT be considered missing data. The 
amount was determined based on preliminary studies. 
 
o Description of recruitment materials and their use  
Sample study announcement, sample study announcement in flyer format, and flyer for TICAA 
recruitment will be distributed through and displayed on cancer support groups and communities/groups for Asian Americans . 
o Describe the procedures for data collection  
 
The data are mainly collected through the Internet survey questionnaire. When potential 
participants visit the project Web site (after receiving/reviewing a study announcement), they will be asked to review the informed consent. When participants click I  agree to participate, 
they will have given their consent. Then, after checking them against the inclusion criteria and quota requirements, only those who meet the criteria and requirements will be automatically assigned a serial number, and randomized int o two groups using an automated random number 
generator accessible through the Web site.  
 
Then, the women will be asked to fill out the Internet survey questionnaire (if requested, paper -
and-pencil questionnaires will be provided/used, or research staff w ill assist in administering the 
Internet surveys over the phone.) and sign up the Web site by [CONTACT_904616]. Whenever they visit the Web site, they need to use the ID and passwords to log in the site. If they want, they can change the ir ID and passwords. Then, both groups will be 
provided with an electronic instruction sheet on when they need to come back and fill out additional questionnaires and/or use the program.  
 
Biweekly, the research team will send reminders and thank- you emails. Two weeks before the 
end of the 1st month, both groups will be asked to fill out the next set of the instruments by [CONTACT_2671] 1st month. Then, [ADDRESS_1269766] month. 
  
o Description of research instruments to be used (e.g., questionnaires, surveys, interview or focus group guides, scales)  
Version date: 6 /3/2020  Multiple instruments will be used: the Support Care Needs Survey- 34 Short Form (SCNS -
34SF),50 the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale -Short Form (MSAS -SF),[ADDRESS_1269767] Cancer (FACT -B),52 the modified Questions on 
Attitudes, Self -Efficacy, P erceived Barriers, and Social Influences (QASPS),53 the Cancer 
Behavior Inventory (CBI),54,55,56 the Perceived Isolation Scale (PIS),57,58 the Personal Resource 
Questionnaire (PRQ -2000),[ADDRESS_1269768] been 
established among Asian Americans. Cronbach’s alpha of individual instrument ranged from .76 
to .96 among Asian Americans.  
o Describe any other study -related interactions  or interventions : The Intervention: The 
TICAA  
This study consists of two groups of research participants: (a) [ADDRESS_1269769] cancer 
survivors (55 per sub- ethnic group) who do not use the TICAA, but use the information on breast 
cancer by [CONTACT_904617] (ACS)(a control group); (b) [ADDRESS_1269770] 
cancer survivors (55 per sub- ethnic group) who use the TICAA and the information by [CONTACT_8884] 
(an intervention group). The ACS website includes information on treatment, prevention, genetics, causes, screening, testing, copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], clinical trials, research findings, and statistics related to breast cancer in multiple languages including Mandarin Chinese and Korean. At the completion of the study, both will be allowed to use or continue t o use the TICAA.  
Theoretical Bases, Information Architecture, and Menus. The TICAA was developed based on the findings from PSs using the information mappi[INVESTIGATOR_120229].
69 The TICAA is theoretically 
based on the Bandura’s theory. Based on the Bandura’s theory,70–[ADDRESS_1269771] self -management 
programs include coaching/support  and information  interventions as part of the program 
content.73 Likewise, the TICAA includes group and individual (real -time and personalized) 
coaching/support by [CONTACT_37157], peer coaching/support, and information to change the 
women’s attitudes, self -efficacy, perceived barriers, and social influences. The TICAA uses a 
free-form matrix information architecture74 and includes menus based on the three components 
(see below). Graphic User Interface controls75 (e.g., push buttons, check boxes, drop- down lists) 
are used. Presentation styles (e.g., colors, menus, etc.) are tailored based on PSs.  
Technolog ical Tools .  The Ruby [CONTACT_260177] (ROR) framework (http://ruby[CONTACT_260195].org) and the Xen 
hypervisor ( http://xen.org ) were used to develop the TICAA. ROR is a web application 
framework based on the Model -View -Controller (MVC) archi tecture that can separate software 
logic and data handling from user interface.[ADDRESS_1269772] 
system, called a virtual machine, runs as an independent computer. By [CONTACT_904618], if any of the virtual machines fail, the web service will be still available, which ensures the efficiency of the servers and the safety and security of the data.  
Version date: 6 /3/2020  Components .  The TICAA has three components in four languages  (English, Mandarin Chine se, 
Korean, and Japanese): (a) social media sites; (b) interactive online educational sessions; and (c) 
online resources. To incorporate cultural differences among three different sub- ethnic groups , 
three separate social media sites  are designed for each sub -ethnic group. The sites provide a 
mechanism by [CONTACT_904619], have interactions with and get support from peers , and receive 
coachin g/support from culturally matched peers and health care providers .77 In each site, cultural 
tailoring  will be done through incorporating both general and sub- ethnicity -specific materials to 
discuss and culturally appropriate examples from PSs . The sites wi ll incorporate Asian cultural 
values  related to family (e.g., family as the center of the women’s daily life) and the collectivistic 
values for Asian women as a way to frame discussions and to present content. Each site consists of a social media function (like the timeline of Facebook ), a chat function with a  culturally 
matched bilingual interventionist  and a symptom log function. Interventionists are required to 
have a bachelor’s degree in a health -related field and be bilingual. We will have a registered  
nurse (RN) monitoring or supervising the coaching/support provided by [CONTACT_262416]. The 
RN will provide consultation to the interventionists while consulting with two MD consultants . 
For the intervention period, weekly group and individual coaching/support by [CONTACT_904620]. Group coaching/support through the social media function will not have time limits because it will be based on asynchronous interactions. Yet, real-time and personalized individua l coaching/support will be provided in a specific designated 
time period (each participant sets a specific time period for getting individual coaching/support) by [CONTACT_904621]. In addition, the use of phone calls and mobile chat functions (e.g., Wecha t, 
Line, KaKao Talk, Skype et. al) as supplementary methods for individual coaching/support is permitted for the study- related communications.  Group coaching/support will start once the first 
10 women per sub- ethnic group are enrolled, but individual coaching/support will start as soon 
as a participant is enrolled. Starting the group coaching/support with 10 women is reasonable when considering that 10~[ADDRESS_1269773] 5 group 
messages related to each topic to give group coaching/support, and send at least 1~2 message(s) to each participant for individual coaching/support. Coaching/ support will focus on enhancing breast cancer survivorship by [CONTACT_904622], building self -efficacy, minimizing 
perceived barriers, and enhancing social influences through multiple ways (see Table 1). Messages in other languages will be translated into English, and those in English will be translated into other languages (using both Google translator and daily reviews/corrections by [CONTACT_904623]). The interventionists will minimally interfere the interactions among the p articipants.  
A total of 15 interactive online educational sessions  (users can choose the content and ask 
questions and/or provide feedback by [CONTACT_904624]) provide information about general and sub- ethnicity -specific topi[INVESTIGATOR_904596]. These sessions are 
also available in the four languages (already translated using the standard -back translation 
process
79,80). The content is differently constructed by [CONTACT_26423]- ethnic group based on the cultural 
findings from PSs . For e xample, because Chinese women tended to use Chinese herbal medicine 
for their symptom management in PSs, we have added an education module on Chinese herbal medicine for Chinese participants. These sessions  will provide correct and updated information 
on breast cancer and treatment/management strategies so that stigmatization  could be reduced by 
[CONTACT_633733]: 6 /3/2020  correcting misinformation. Culturally relevant contents  (e.g., Red Ginseng, herbal medicine, 
Acupuncture, etc.) were also incorporated into the sessions. Finally, s ub-ethnicity -specific 
online resources  include [ADDRESS_1269774] cancer survivorship in 
English, Mandarin Chinese, Korean, and/or Japanese from scientific authorities and from general 
and sub- ethnicity -specific health organization s/institutes. General resources will be available to 
all groups, but sub- ethnic -specific resources will be available only for the applicable group. Six 
experts reviewed the TICAA against the criteria for rigor in cross -cultural research.81,82

o Describe processes for translating  
The study announcement, informed consent sheet, the TICAA, and Internet survey 
questionnaires will be available in four languages.  Mandarin Chinese, Korean, and Japanese 
versions have already been prepared using the standard translation and back- translation process 
by [CONTACT_904629]. 
A total of 15 interactive online educational sessions provided to the intervention group are also 
available in the four languages (already translated using the standard- back translation 
process79,80). 
In addition, messages used in the intervention in other languages wil l be translated into English, 
and those in English will be translated into other languages (using both Google translator and daily reviews/corrections by [CONTACT_904623]). The interventionists will minimally interfere the interactions among the participants.  
 
o Informed Consent Process:  
 The participants will be able to consent at any time after reviewing the informed consent sheet on the project website. They are free to go and come back later and consent if needed. Participants 
Version date: 6 /3/[ADDRESS_1269775], previous studies indicated that ethnic minorities including Asian Americans did not wish to sign a written consent for a historical reason: For example, in Korea, data from surveys were once used to identify ta x fraud, and some people’s honest answers on the survey were used to 
assess an additional tax. This Internet -based consent process has been used in all previous studies 
by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_904597]. T he 
previous studies by [CONTACT_978], which compared the paper -and-pencil survey with the Internet survey 
questionnaire, showed that the Internet -based consent process was similar to that of the paper -
and-pencil survey in terms of its ability to explain the study and respond to questions from 
participants. Interestingly, some participants in the previous studies indicated that they preferred Internet communications to ask questions about the study because Internet communications are asynchronous (they could ask questions at any time) and e -mail is a written form of 
communication. 
 
When potential participants visit the project Web site, they will be asked to review the informed consent form that provides general information on the proposed project, including: (a) the purpose of the study, (b) staff on the study, (c) the data collection period, (d) potential physical and psychological risks involving inconvenience, confidentiality, and invasion of privacy, (e) their rights to withdraw, (f) how to maintain complete con fidentiality (using IDs and passwords), 
(g) what they are being asked to contribute to the study, and (h) how their participation will be reimbursed. The consent process will be automatic through the project website; the participants will be asked to click  "I agree to participate" after reviewing the informed consent sheet that is 
loaded on the project website.  
  
o Potential Risks/Discomforts to Study Participants  and measures to prevent occurrence : 
There are no risks of injury or bodily harm . There are no risks to employment/employability, 
reputability, financial standing, and/or criminal/legal status.  However, participation in this study 
may be inconvenient, and some of the questions may make the participants uncomfortable or upset; however, the participants are free to decline to answer any questions if they do not wish to answer and to stop participating in the project at any time. 
The participants' records will be handled as confidentially as possible. The collected data will remain confidential unless a  participant appears at risk of harm. Only the research team will have 
access to the study records, which will be directly saved in a computer file format called ASCII. No individual identities will be used in any reports or publications that will result f rom this 
study. However, as an online participant in this research, the participants will always run the risk 
Version date: 6 /3/2020  that outside agents, such as hackers will try to access the site, and if they do, the participants may 
be identified.  
o Benefits:  
The participant ma y not directly benefit from participation in this study; however, she will gain 
some knowledge and peer support from using the program. Also, she may get some satisfaction from knowing that the information she provides will assist health care providers in developi[INVESTIGATOR_904598] a culturally competent information and coaching/support program for Asian American breast cancer survivors. Further, she may gain additional knowledge by [CONTACT_904630].   
  
o Compensation for time and effort : 
At the completion of their participation, the participants will be compensated with $50 electronic gift cards for their participation. The compensation will be prorated. The amount was determined based on preliminary studies. 
o Data Analysis: Data Management and Monitoring:  
The data will be stored on research dedicated, secure folder, firewall protect ed servers maintained 
by [CONTACT_172115], I T office. Subsequently, the security and safety measures to protect the data 
will just follow those of the Emory University, IT office. All documentation related to the study 
will be stored in a locked cabinet file in a secured office that is only accessib le to approved doctoral 
fellows and faculty.   
 
o Plans for analysis, statistical and/or otherwise:  
Data analysis will be conducted at Emory University, School of Nursing. Data collected through the Internet will remain confidential unless a participant appears at risk of harm. Only the research team will have access to the study records, which will be directly saved in a computer file format called ASCII. No individual identities will be used in any reports or publications that will result fr om this study. 
 
Version date: 6 /3/2020  Preliminary Analysis & Missing Data . Serial ID numbers will be assigned and attached to the 
data. Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize all variables, and distributions of variables 
will be examined for outliers and normality. Then, transformations will be applied as appropriate. Internal consistency reliability estimates for multi- item scales of at least 0.7 will be 
considered acceptable. We will use an intent -to-treat approach; participants will be analyzed in 
their original randomized conditions regardless of the usages of the TICAA or follow -ups 
missed. The mechanism underlying missing data will be evaluated and appropriate imputation methodology will be implemented (e.g., missing at random and multiple imputation by [CONTACT_3006]).[ADDRESS_1269776] one follow -up assessment will be included in 
outcome modeling, and the linear mixed effects modeling will take advantage of all available data. Baseline characteristics will be compared among pat ients with and without complete 
follow -up. To assess potential biases, a comparison of withdrawal rates will be included. 84 If 
the number of participants droppi[INVESTIGATOR_904599] (10%) and the missing observations can be considered random, then the primary hypotheses will be tested using the complete observed data. If missing observations cannot be assumed to be random, more complex approaches (e.g., shared parameter models85) will be considered.  
Aim #1: Effects on Primary Outcomes . Separate intent -to-treat g eneral linear models86 will be 
used to examine differences in continuous outcome measures by [CONTACT_904631], adjusting for baseline outcome and any variables that demonstrate imbalances in preliminary analyses.  Model assumptions wil l be assessed, and modifications will be 
implemented as necessary to improve mode fit. Differences in continuous outcome measures over time will be examined using an intent -to-treat linear mixed -model growth curve analysis 
with SAS Proc Mixed.[ADDRESS_1269777]- fitting longitudinal change pattern.89   
Aim #2: Mediation of Intervention effects . Sequential process random regression growth curve 
modeling90 wi ll be performed to explore the hypotheses that attitudes, self -efficacy, perceived 
barriers, and social influences, separately, mediate the relationship between intervention group and change over time in primary outcomes. Specifically, we will examine whet her the women 
who receive the TICAA show more favorable changes on the mediators at post -intervention and 
the follow -up periods relative to pre -intervention than do those in the control group. Mediational 
analyses will be performed to examine whether there is statistical support for the view that the putative mediator variables actually mediate effects of the TICAA on participants’ needs for 
Version date: 6 /3/2020  help, physical and psychological symptoms, and quality of life. Although various methods are 
appropriate for evaluati ng mediation in this setting, random regression growth curve modeling90 
was chosen as it prospectively and longitudinally tests the three criteria of mediation proposed by [CONTACT_170893]. 91 Modeling will rely on incorporating time varying [mediator] as a  predictor 
of outcome in each sequential assessment.  To test the mediation hypothesis, individual slope and intercept parameters will be estimated for each participant based on intervention, mediator, and outcome. The intercept parameters will be coded to  represent the value of the linear growth 
trajectory for each participant at baseline. The sequential process, or lagged approach, will allow for stronger inference regarding causality. Model assumptions will be assessed, and transformations will be applie d as necessary. A series of four regressions will be used to test 
each of the mediational chains according to the criteria specified by [CONTACT_170893].[ADDRESS_1269778]. 92   
Aim #3: Moderation of Intervention Effects .  The moderating role of background and disease 
factors will be generated for each outcome.  Intention- to-treat mixed -modeling procedures86 as 
described above will be used to test and estimate differences in outcome acros s intervention 
groups and how moderators modify such differences. Accordingly, coefficient estimates for these measures by [CONTACT_904632]. Initial models will include all main ef fects and possible two-  and three -way 
interactions between moderator, intervention group, and time. With respect to random effects, in addition to random intercepts, random slopes for time, moderator variables will be estimated to account for within- indivi dual variability. As before, each model will control for baseline 
outcome values, which will be centered about the grand mean for all patients. Accordingly, intercepts represent the mean baseline outcome score across patients, adjusting for all other value s included in the respective models.  
o Training of study team  
All research team members  will complete CITI training  before engaged in the study.  Also, t o 
eliminate contamination across interventionists and minimize risk of differential treatment delivery am ong different interventionists, the interventionists will be trained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_904600]. The interventionists’ first 5 messages through the social media sites and the chat function will be monitored and evaluated  by [CONTACT_5051], 
and the team’s feedback will be incorporated into their subsequent coaching/support. Also, the interventionists will learn methods of facilitating discussions without influencing participants and helpi[INVESTIGATOR_904601]. Two culturally- matched RAs will be trained 
on the logistics for the participant recruitment, the online survey system, and the delivery of the online questionnaires. Team meetings will be held monthly to address problems, reinforce learning, and monitor progress. Retraining of the interventionists and RAs will be done every 18 months to prevent drift. 
o Plans for Monitoring the Study for Safety  
 
Version date: 6 /3/2020  Since Data and Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMBs) are required only for phase III clinical trials 
(NOT -OD-00-038.html), we do not include a DSMB for this intervention study. For the 
proposed intervention study, we have the following data safety monitoring plan (DSMP). First, 
to manage and protect the data collected, only summary data will be openly accessible t o funding 
agency or will appear in publications. Research participants will be informed that they are free to 
decline to answer any questions they do not wish to answer or to stop participating in the project at any time. When a participant withdraws from participation, the data that they have provided 
will be immediately removed. Also, the data will have no identifying information to link a 
subject to the data. The participants' records will be handled as confidentially as possible. Only the research team will have access to the study records. Only a serial ID number assigned by [CONTACT_260171], and the data will be stored in a locked file cabinet in a 
research office. No identity information, including IP addresses, will be atta ched to any of the 
individual or group data. Therefore, research participants will not be identifiable directly or 
through the identifying information linked to subjects. No individual identities will be used in any reports or publications that will result  from this study. Additionally, as explained above, the 
Web site will be developed and maintained such that it conforms to the HIPAA standards and SANS/FBI recommendations. Finally, data in the servers will be daily monitored by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Chee to ensure its safety and security. All the participants will be asked (before participating in the study) if they have a regular source of health care so that the researcher could refer them if there is an 
adverse event identified during the data collection process. If the participants do not have a 
regular source of health care, then the researcher will get on the web and find a clinic or health care center near the participants’ locations that they can go to for emergency health care, if 
needed. During the data collection process, online records of the TICAA implementation will be monitored daily by a culturally matched RA under the supervision of Drs. Im, Mao, and 
Schapi[INVESTIGATOR_20116], and any potential and actual adverse health problems will be identified through the 
monitoring proce ss. In addition, the research team will meet regularly to monitor the research 
process, monitor the online records, monitor participant adherence, and address any issues that arise and consult as necessary with consultants. 
 
o Confidentiality:  
All e-mail/Int ernet communication between participants and the research team will be kept 
confidential by [CONTACT_260185] e -mails on the study team secure server with restricted access only to 
research team members. All e- mails received or sent by [CONTACT_904633], and they will be on a firewall -protected 
computer to which only the research team can access.   Also, at the completion of the study, the 
saved e- mails will be permanently destroyed to ensure  confidentiality. In addition, as described 
earlier, e- mail addresses will be used only for reminders and participation compensation, and 
will be kept separate from other participant data. Furthermore, their email addresses will be 
accessed only by [CONTACT_526266], and the participants can communicate with other participants 
only through the social media sites (no email address will be disclosed to other participants).

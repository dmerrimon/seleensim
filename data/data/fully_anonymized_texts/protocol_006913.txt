Appendix  I  How To Collect Anterior Nasal Specime n for COVID -[ADDRESS_647080] impacted in the US .2 COVID -19 testing has had technical and diagnostic 
challenges since its inception; however, these challenges are overshadowed by [CONTACT_502378]. First, messaging of testing importance is complicated because of stigma related to subse quent social 
isolation, employment loss and potential illness and death.3,[ADDRESS_647081] as there is nothing that can be 
done (July 2020 C3 FGD, Chicago ). Third, messages about the importance of testing are most often delivered by 
[CONTACT_502379]. These messages (and the messenger) do not resonate with community who often are 
facing significant racism/stigma, lack resources to meet basic needs, a nd structural violence in the form of l aw 
and immigration enforcement.[ADDRESS_647082] in those who are experiencing health disparities10. Within the [LOCATION_002]’ context, the medical 
establishment has a long history of exploiting people of color - specifically black, Latinx, and Indigenous 
individuals - for the sake of purported medical advancement51 . The case of Henrietta Lacks, the Tuskegee 
Studies, and the experiments of James Marion Sims upon Lucy, Betsy, and Anracha are just a few examples of 
the historical medical trauma exerted upon Black and African American individuals living within the Unit ed 
States51A strong predictor of intention to get vaccinated is confidence in vaccine safety and effectiveness49 
Second, there are concerns around vaccine side effects and concerns about getting COVID -[ADDRESS_647083] of public institutions and therefore individuals do not participate in services, resources, and 
benefits.7,8 Disenfranchisement generates, maintains, and propagates vulnerability both directly and 
indirectly.7,9Poverty, limited opportunity for prevention or other health services and racism all contribute to the 
COVID -19 inequities that are similar in magnitude to other socially dete rmined outcomes, such as kidney 
disease, violence and death due to AIDS.10,11Two key disenfranchised populations where significant COVID -19 
transmission occurs is among criminal justice involved (ie. arrest, history of jail/prison, probation/parole) and 
low-income Latinx community members. 6,11,12,13,[ADDRESS_647084] are part of the essential low -wage workforce where transmission is high, and 
frequent outbreaks occur within multi -generational working households.12,16,17 There often can be limited agency 
and self -determination in such contexts (ie. inability to self -isolate) which can be disempowering and thus 
requires interv entions that are self -affirming. Finally both CJI and Latinx communities often have considerable 
distrust in institutions including public health18 and lack access to accurate and contextually/linguistically 
appropriate COVID -[ADDRESS_647085]/jail/ prison, 
community supervision (probation/ parole), mandated drug court attendance and are susceptible to distrust in 
public health institutions. One in five American adults has had justice exposure including arrest, incarceration, 
being on supervision, and/or being subjected to a number of liberty restrictions including the right to vote, right 
to live with family members, and employment limitations.24 CJI populations’ differential experiences with justice 
systems, and other social institutions like child welfare and Medicaid, impact willingness to engage in testing. In 
NIDA’s first JCOIN data product developed by [CONTACT_941] C3 team we used NORC’s AmeriSpeak P anel,[ADDRESS_647086] from COVID (9% to 0.5%) than those without such history. Those respondents with a history 
of CJI are also less likely to be able to follow important preventative health measures recommended for COVID -
19 (e.g., wearing a mas k, social distancing) . Complicating these relationships are that CJI individuals are more 
likely to have higher rates of legal cynicism and perception of procedural misjustice which affect trust in social 
institutions. Legal cynicism often translates into anti -authority attitu des that affect willingness  to engage in 
health or self -care activities, and given the higher rates of substance use, mental health, and infectious diseases 
among CJI populations, 26,[ADDRESS_647087] of justice agencies, and self -efficacy.  
 
Low-income Latinx people (250% at or below FPL) have some of the highest rates of COVID -19 in the US and 
require testing interventions that address unique cultural factors and engage familial support systems. Latinx and 
Hispanic people (hereafter Latinx) i nclude a diverse set of communities and several intersectional factors: 
country of origin, duration of time in US, and documented status. Nearly 25% of Latinx people are employed in 
essential service industries  28 (e.g., food service, factory processing) a nd are exposed to a greater likelihood of 
contracting COVID while working.[ADDRESS_647088] three 
generations reside in a household,31 which requires different approaches to promote public health messages for 
testing and preventing th e spread of COVID -19 within a household. Latinx who are undocumented or who are in 
mixed -status households are more likely to be uninsured and less likely to access and utilize healthcare services32 
including COVID -19 testing. The existence of multi -generational and other mixed -status households are 
examples of the collectivistic culture that places a prominent role on familismo, which is an important protective 
factor for an individual’s well -being.  33,[ADDRESS_647089] marginalized communities in testing  and vaccination .  
 
The Social Network Strategy (SNS) was developed for HIV and is adapted to accelerate COVID -[ADDRESS_647090] at risk. Social network interventions are recognized as highly potent testing interventions 
that move beyond individual -level “r isk”36 which are key to COVID -19 elimination efforts. Network 
mobilization/induction is a Type III intervention strategy that stimulates peer -to-peer interaction to create 
behavioral diffusion through existing social pathways among network members.[ADDRESS_647091] been found to be effective in HIV prevention (i.e., CDC’s 
EBI—Social Network Strategy).  [ADDRESS_647092] similar HIV risk potential.39 SNS identifies HIV  positive individuals and/or 
individuals at risk for acquiring HIV and motivates them to recruit persons from their social network for testing 
and provides modest compensation for referr als. In so doing, the reach of the testing program increases as does 
the volume of people tested. In a recent study conducted by [CONTACT_365564] C3,40 the social network strategy (SNS) 
 
Page [ADDRESS_647093] testing approaches, such as those in health 
care settings (i.e. emergency department) or contact [CONTACT_144842]. These findings are not surprising given that social 
network theory, such as homophil y (i.e. birds of a feather)  [ADDRESS_647094] that subsequent waves of referred network 
members will resemble an index client’s attributes.  
 
STUDY DESIGN  
The scientific premise of C3 is to engage disenfranchised people in COVID -19 testing  and vaccination  referral  
through social network referral combined with theory -driven COVID -19 prevention messaging. Eligible CJI and 
Latinx clients (and the overlap between the two) will be enrolled into C3.  
 
Using a two -arm randomized controlled trial design, participants will be enrolled into the SNS arm (involves 
social networking referrals  only) or the SNS+messaging arm. T he latter includes affirmation/misinformation 
correction messaging  (discussion tools and coaching) . SNS and SNS+ messaging  arms will both include an initial 
group of index study participants who will refer their network members into the study and the process will repeat 
itself one more time for a total of 3 waves.  
 
A total of 2400 participants will be enrolled (estimated n=300 index seeds and n=[ADDRESS_647095] and 2nd degree 
network referrals) across sites in the Central US: Dallas County, TX (n=600); East Baton Rouge, LA (n=200); 
Pulaski County, AR. (n=200); Marion County,  IN (n=200); Porter County, IN (n=200); and Cook County, IL 
(n=800).  
 
AIMS  
This study aims to evaluate the implementation of a combination Social Network testing Strategy (SNS) with 
COVID -19 prevention messages (SNS+) to engage disenfranchised populations such as criminal justice involved 
(CJI) and low -income Hispanic/Latinx (her eafter Hispanic) community members in COVID -19 testing ,  
prevention strategies  and vaccination  across eight sites in the Central [LOCATION_002]. Accordingly, the SNS+ team 
aims to:

METHODS  
 
AIM : Test intervention efficacy (numbers tested  – COVID -[ADDRESS_647101] results will be collected as study data ; 
numbers vaccinated – COVID -19 vaccine records will be collected as part of the study ) and community factors 
that may moderate efficacy. Secondary analysis to compare numbers tested in SNS strategies and COVID -[ADDRESS_647102]  and determine whether COVID -19 status within social networks impacts the referral process . 
 
We hypothesize that participants randomized to receive SNS+ (SNS+COVID -19 messaging) will be more likely 
to have their network members successfully tested  and vaccinated  (study participants will be given COVID -[ADDRESS_647103] information to vaccination sites in their community . Vaccination will depend 
on the network members’ tier/health department eligibility for vaccination) . We also hypothesize that both SNS 
and SNS+ will generate more people tested per index as compared to COVID -[ADDRESS_647104] tracing. Finally, we 
anticipate that there may be differential intervention effects across sites, by [CONTACT_502381], prior COVID -19 testing 
history, race/ethnicity, and network composition, and will formally evaluate the se differences as part of 
analyses.  
 
Recruitment of Index and Network Member study participants.   
We will enroll index seeds (12% of sample) ages 18 and over who are CJI or low -income Latinx across eight 
collaborative sites. Index clients and their social network referrals will be recruited by [CONTACT_5737] R esearch Assistant s 
(RAs)  embedded within community -based agencies and community health care settings that provide a number 
of in person and remote social and care services, including community COVID -19 testing .  
 
Recruitment activities  may include:  
• In-person recruitment may be conducted at the study center (Table 1), during regular drop -in and 
community -based services , and events occurring at the study center and its outreach programs.   This 
may include providing a study flyer or contact [CONTACT_289491] a client can contact [CONTACT_502382].  A sign -up sheet may also be provided, where interested clients can provide their 
contact [CONTACT_502383].  
• Flyers posted at study  centers  
• Social media posting s 
• Contact[CONTACT_502384].  
 
Subjects  will also be recruited through other study participants through compensated referral. Each study 
participant will be given a referral code that will be used for identification purpose. The study participants will 
distribute flyer and the referral code to p eople who are eligible for the study. People who are eligible and 
provide the referral code can be enrolled in the study. Participants will also be recruited from participants in 
other studies who have agreed to be contact[CONTACT_7678].  
 
A two -step referral process will be utilized whereby [CONTACT_502385] [ADDRESS_647105]- and second -degree social 
network members (8 8% of sample).  So indexes will refer network members (1st degree) and then those network 
members will refer one more round (2nd degree).  Index seeds will meet the eligibility for index community 
members  while the first and second -degree network members will meet the social network member eligibility 
(see inclusion and exclusion criteria below ). Based upon previous experiences wi th SNS recruitment, we expect 
on average two social network members  to be referred per study participant.  
 
Each study participant will be given a referral code that will be used for identification purpose s. The study 
partic ipants will distribute  the referral code to their network members who are eligible for the study. People who 
 
Page [ADDRESS_647106]  for each site .

Study Visit Procedures   
All study participants  (index and referral)  will go through the following s tudy procedures  (Figure 4)  include:  
 
Page 10 of 19 Version 2023. 09.25  
 • Informed consent;  
• Day 1  survey;  
• Randomization;  
• Messaging intervention (for SNS+ only);  
• COVID -19 testing  
• Social Network referral   
• Day 21 Follow -up 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Informed Consent. Eligible participants will be asked to participate in written informed consent  using either 
a paper consent or electronic consent . The following consent processes applies to both the study consent 
form and the release of information form.   
 
Paper Consent  in-person : 
A study team will provide the subject with a copy of the study consent. The consent document will be 
reviewed and any questions regarding the study will be answered by [CONTACT_3476]. If the subject agrees 
to participate in the study, they will be instruct ed to sign the consent form. The subject will be provided 
with a final signed copy. A signed copy will be stored by [CONTACT_3476].  
 
Electronic Consent  in-person : 
Consent may be obtained in -person electronically via RedCAP. Study staff can present the consent to the 
subject on the tablet or on paper depending upon subject preference. The consent document will be 
reviewed and any questions regarding the study will be  answered by [CONTACT_3476]. If the subject agrees 
to participate in the study, the subject will be instructed to sign the consent form via RedCAP e -consent 
signature. Staff will also sign the consent form and update the RedCAP link to provide the subject with a 
final, signed version of the consent form via email. The final signed consent document will be stored in 
RedCAP.  
 
Electronic Consent Remote, using RedCAP:  
Remote consent would be conducted via telephone or video call (with preference being video call 
whenever possible) using a link through REDCap.   A link to the to the consent in RedCAP will be sent to 
the subject via text and/oremail. The study staff will discuss the consent form with the subject, and any 
questions regarding the study will be answered by [CONTACT_3476].  The subject's identity wil l be verified 
as described below.  If the subject agrees to participate in the study, he/she will be instructed t o sign the 
consent form via RedCAP e -consent signature. Staff will also sign the consent form and update the 
RedCAP link in order to provide the subject with a final, signed version of the consent form. The final 
signed consent document will be stored in R edCAP.   
 
The study team will do due diligence to verify the subject’s identity before beginning the consent process.  
Traditional means of verifying subject identity may be challenging in this subject population.  Most will 
not be patients with local medical records to reference, some will not have formal state IDs, some may 
not have permanent residence, etc. Strict enforcement of state ID could disenfranchise those who may 
well be the most important group to reach and the very population that needs to  be studied.   Subject 
identity will be verified using the following methods, in the following order of requirement:  
1) Visually display a driver’s license or state ID  Figure 4  
 

 
Page 11 of 19 Version 2023. 09.25  
 2) Visually display an alternative photo ID (employee ID, school ID, etc) in combination with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_502375]’s name.   
3) Visually display an alternative photo ID (employee ID, school ID, etc) alone  
4) Visually display one of the following pi[INVESTIGATOR_289469]’s name [CONTACT_3816]: utility bill, 
cellphone bill, correspondence from the secretary of state or other government organization  
5) Visually displaying any pi[INVESTIGATOR_289470]’s name [CONTACT_3816]  
6) Asking the subject to verbally state their name  
 
2. Day 1 Survey.  Following consent, study participants will complete a n electronic  survey that includes social 
network inventory .  Identifying information of social network members ( first name [CONTACT_502407] /zipcode/neigborhood ) is collected through self -report for the purposes of connecting social networks 
of study subjects.  Day [ADDRESS_647107] difficulty self -
administering the survey.    
 
3. Randomization .  Will occur following the survey, and participants in the SNS+ messaging  arm will receive 
the messaging intervention  (discussion tools and coaching) . Study participants will be randomized to receive 
no messaging (i.e., SNS only) or SNS +messaging with equal probability. Randomization will be performed 
at the participant level, meaning that in general, participants within a recruitment cluster will be assigned to 
different groups. Random assignments will be provided by [CONTACT_502387] a web -based API, 
with the touchpads programmed to retrieve an assignment at the appropriate time and deliver the messaging 
(or not), as appropriate.  
 
Indexes  and first -degree referrals  will be randomized as described above. Second -degree referrals  will also 
be randomized, however, we will not ask for additional SNS referrals  from them if the study sample size has 
been reached.  
 
4. Messaging Intervention . Study staff will be notified of group allocation and provide the in -person message 
reinforcement and will address questions related to messaging.  
a. C3 Study Conditions . Trained community engagement coordinators (CEC) that exist across C3 sites 
will deliver the study conditions. The CECs will have capacity to support multiple participants 
simultaneously in the self -administered portion of the study visit: clarifying any survey items, 
troubleshooting any technology/data collection issues, and transitioning to interviewer administered 
for people with limited literacy. CECs will p rovide the appropriate scripted messaging strategy based 
upon condition assignment (see conditions below) and will follow with describing and motivating the 
SNS network referral process.  
b. SNS Study Condition . Study participants in the SNS condition will receive the SNS intervention  
training which will take about [ADDRESS_647108]: “friend, family, coworker or someone you spend time with on a regular basis”. 
Walkthrough and scenar io play will be strategies to assist with planning regarding: (1) how the 
conversation will be raised, (2) how potential barriers to testing will be addressed, (3) how the 
screening by [CONTACT_502388], (4)  what information about the study will be 
shared. Information from the client providing referrals will be kept confidential. Participants will be 
compensated $[ADDRESS_647109] completed per network member and up to six referrals, 
consistent with our p revious work.42 
c. SNS+Messaging Condition.  The SNS+ condition will include everything described in the SNS 
condition above. In addition, a scripted message  (Appendix C)  in the participant’s preferred language 
 
Page 12 of 19 Version 2023. 09.25  
 will be deployed via the tablet in written or  audio format . Training for this additional messaging will 
take about 15 minutes.  
d. Quality Monitoring - A sample (5%) of the trainings will be recorded (video and/or audio) for quality 
improvement purposes.  These recordings may be shared amongst the respective sites -specific study 
team (not shared outside of the subject’s study site). Subjects will be aske d whether they are willing 
to have the session recorded and can indicate yes or no on the study consent form.  
 
5. COVID -19 Testing.  All s tudy participants , irrespective of symptoms,  will be tested for COVID -19.  Based on 
routine practices of the site, t esting will be e ither administered by a clinical professional or conducted 
through self -administration according to CDC guidelines (Appendix I) .  Testing procedures will follow 
existing SOPs utilized at each site , utilizing FDA -approved tests. COVID testing at these sites  is covered by 
[CONTACT_502389].    
 
Test result provision will be provided by [CONTACT_502390]/clinical team . All subjects will be provided with the 
CDC’s information page “What Your Test Results Mean” (Appendix J).  
 
6. COVID -19 Vaccination :  All subjects will be provided with the link to CDC’s COVID -19 vaccine 
information page “Key Things You Need To Know About  COVID -19 Vaccines” (Appendix K) and a link to 
CDC’s “Vaccines for COVID -19” page available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -
ncov/vaccines/index.html . Access to vaccines will  follow routine practices and will  depend on a participants’ 
tier/health department eligibility to get the vaccine as well as vaccine availability.  Contact [CONTACT_502391].  
 
All participants will  be asked  sign release of information forms for study team members to obtain test results  
and vaccination records . Vaccination records will also be collected through participant self -report 
(participants can show study staff their vaccination card). COVID test results and vaccine records will be 
collected as part of study data and will be needed to determine the effectiveness of the intervention.   
 
7. Social Network Referral  – Network referrals will be conducted as outlined above (See SNS Study 
condi tion).  A study information card  (Appendix D) will be given to all enrolled subjects to share with their 
network referrals. The information card contains information about the study and study team contact 
[CONTACT_3031].   Linkages between study participants are collected through a code/code word process that our 
team has used in previous network referral studies.  
 
8. Day 21 Assessment  - Study participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] 21 days following the initial study visit via phone 
or Zoom, depending upon client preference.   Data will be captured electronically by [CONTACT_502392] a study tablet. This inte rview also includes social network inventory (identifying information : first 
name, last initial, cross streets/zipcode/neighborhood)  for the purposes of connecting social networks of 
study subjects .  Day 21 Interview is found in Appendix E. The 21day follow -up (Day 21 Interview) has two 
purposes:  
(1) administering perceived message effectiveness surveys and post -intervention COVID -19 knowledge 
assessment;  COVID vaccine information  and (2) check -in on network member referra l (Appendix D).  
 
Subject Compensation. Compensation  will be provided for study participation  - $[ADDRESS_647110] visit and 
$20 after the 21-day follow -up. Participants will  be provided a $20 incentive for each network referrals 
initiated (up to six  referrals, up to $120 for referrals ). Payments will be in cash , gift cards  or e-payments such 
as CashApp, P ayPal or Venmo.  
 
 
Page 13 of 19 Version 2023. 09.25  
 C3 Study Conditions.  Trained community engagement coordinators (CEC) that exist across C3 sites will 
deliver the study conditions. The CECs will have capacity to support multiple participants simultaneously in the 
self-administered portion of the study visit: clarifying any s urvey items, troubleshooting any technology/data 
collection issues, and transitioning to interviewer administered for people with limited literacy. CECs will 
provide the appropriate scripted messaging strategy based upon condition assig nment (see conditions above ) 
and will follow with describing and motivating the SNS network referral process.  
 
Primary Outcomes . We focus on two primary outcomes:  
(1) Total number of tests among network members referred for COV ID testing (network tested) - Network 
tested is measured at the participant level by [CONTACT_502393]  
(2) proportion of network members tested (tested proportion).  
(3) Total number of vaccinations among study participants given COVID vaccine information (number 
vaccinated) - Number vaccinated is measured at the participant level by [CONTACT_502394] .  
 
Other Important Variables:  Age, race, ethnicity, gender, sex at birth, and CJI history; as well as COVID -19 
knowledge, testing history, infection history, substance use history, beliefs around mask efficacy, 
treatment/prevention history, vaccine knowledge/attitudes, prior contact b y contact [CONTACT_502395], experiences of 
racism, housing status, food insecurity, employment, experience of violence, workplace resources, PPE 
availability, and known COVID -[ADDRESS_647111] will focus on the likelihood that a participant’s network members are referred for testing. This will be 
modeled using logistic regression, with each network member treated as an observation (tested versus not). A 
three -level hierarchical model w ill be used, with random effects at the level of the study participant (level two) 
and the recruitment cluster (level three, all participants referred by [CONTACT_502396]).43 We shall also 
consider adding site as a fourth level to permit us to es timate between -site variability both in the outcomes and 
in the effectiveness of the interventions.  
 
The second analysis will focus on the total number of individuals referred by a participant for testing, including 
both network members and additional referrals not initially named as part of the participant’s network. The total 
number of referrals will be  modeled using negative binomial regression.[ADDRESS_647112] (i.e., sandwich) variance estimator 
throughout.45  
 
Primary outcome analysis (overall comparison of SNS vs. SNS + messaging ). The primary outcome analysis 
will compare the likelihood of testing among network members and the total number of referrals tested between 
those assigned to SNS and those assigne d to SNS plus messaging . Our initial analysis will not adjust for 
covariates, relying instead on the randomization to justify the comparison. We shall then incorporate 
covariates —measured at both the level of the network member (e.g., member characteristics an d the nature of 
the relationship to the participant) and of the participant —to improve the precision of our estimates and to 
identify demographic and social characteristics associated with differences in referral yield. In addition, we shall 
consider inter actions between intervention group (SNS vs. SNS + messaging) and participant characteristics to 
determine whether messaging is more effective in certain groups than others. Since we shall consider several 
possible interactions, we shall use partial pooling  within a Bayesian estimation framework  46 to avoid bias and 
address the issue of multiple comparisons.  
 
 
Page 14 of 19 Version 2023. 09.25  
 We will compare the probability of participants being vaccinated in the SNS vs. SNS + messaging arm using 
logistic regression with each participant treated as an observation (vaccinated vs. not). This will be modeled 
with a three -level hierarchical model w ith random effects at the level of the recruitment cluster and study site. 
We will also consider adjustments for time trends in vaccine availability and participant eligibility.  
 
Secondary outcome analyses : We shall use negative binomial regression to compare the average number of 
referrals tested per index client between those recruited to C3 and assigned to the SNS condition and a 
comparison group of clients at the same sites receiving standard contact [CONTACT_502397]. This analysis will be 
performed first using only those contact [CONTACT_502398] a day randomized to no C3 
recruitment, since these individuals should, on average, be similar to those recruited i nto the study. A 
subsequent analysis will be performed using a larger set of non -study clients to increase precision; this will use 
covariates capturing demographic and other client characteristics to adjust for potential differences between the 
C3 SNS gro up and the non -study comparison group. Analyses will use generalized linear mixed models similar 
to those de scribed above, as appropriate.  
 
Power calculations : In order  to estimate our power , we performed the following simulation. We assumed that 
index participants generate network members according to a negative binomial distribution with mean 4 and SD 
2.8 (to match the study design, networks larger than 6 were truncated). Each network membe r comes in for 
testing with a probability determined by [CONTACT_502399], and we conservatively assume 
intraclass correlations of 0.46 within a participant’s network and 0.37 within a re cruitment cluster. If we assume 
that the overall likelihood of testing among network members is 0.44 among the SNS group and 0.52 among the 
SNS plus messaging group, then an overall sample size of 2,400 participants will provide approximately 87% 
power to  detect the difference at the 0.05 level (twosided). We shall have approximately 80% power to detect an 
interaction between the intervention and a binary participant characteristic (Groups A and B) such that the 
overall probability of testing for those rece iving SNS only (both A and B) is 0.44, the probability of testing for 
those in Group A receiving SNS plus messaging is 0.50, and the probability of testing for those in Group B 
receiving SNS plus messaging is 0.63 (i.e., messaging is more effective among G roup B).  
 
Attrition and missing data : All participants enrolled in the study will be included in our analyses; since the 
primary outcomes will be measured based on referrals coming in to get tested which does not require additional 
participation by [CONTACT_2299], we anticipate very little missing outcome data (referrals who come in for testing 
and decline to identify the person who referred them will not be counted). Any missing data will be addressed 
using multiple imputation  47 or by [CONTACT_2329] a fully Bayesian approa ch to estimate the mode l48 (in which missing 
data are essentially treated as additional unknown parameters).  
 
POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS TO SUBJECTS  
Study Risks.  Interviewed subjects will be exposed to minimal risk: loss of confidentiality and discomfort from 
the questionnaire.  Subjects will be told they do not need to answer any questions that make them uncomfortable.  
Linkages between study participants are collected through a code/code word process that our team has used in 
previous network referral studies.  All survey data will be collected using a tablet  and linked through the 
subject’s study code instead of name . Tablets will be encrypted and data will be password -protected and HIPAA 
compliant. At all sites, COVID infection control procedures will be in place. These will include a COVID 
symptom screener (Appendix F), temperature checks, mask -wearing requirement and at least six feet apart 
during in -person interactions.  
 
Benefits:  The primary potentia l benefits of this research will accrue to participants of this study and their 
networks. Participants will be linked to COVID -[ADDRESS_647113] and configured and certified by [CONTACT_502400] (e.g., timed log -out, whole -disk encryption, use of BigFix and 
antivirus software, etc.). Data will be entered into two applications: REDCap (web -based application hosted by 
[CONTACT_289506]) and Network Canvas (deve loped at Northwestern University, and running 
locally on the laptop). The social network data, including identifiers for social network members, will be entered 
into Network Canvas, which has been specially design ed for collection of such data. Following an interview, the 
data will be exported from Network Canvas and the network member identifiers will be split off and placed in a 
separate file  which will then be strongly encrypted using RSA via the software GnuPG (an implementation of the 
the OpenPGP stand ard as defined by [CONTACT_502401]4880 ). This operation will be performed programmatically, using a 
custom utility installed on the laptop. After verification of the encrypted file, the unencrypted file will be deleted.  
 
Before any data transfer, the University of Chicago will encrypt the data both at rest and in transit via a Shared 
File Transfer protocol (SFTP) to provide a high level of security of sending and receiving file transfers. The 
encrypted data products will b e securely uploaded to a SFTP server using a cyberinfrastructure service such as 
Globus (https://www.globus.org/) via the Biological Science Division Information Services (BSDIS). Using a 
STFP will ensure high security features that meet authentication and  authorization standards for sensitive data 
containing protected health information. Additionally, data management and transferring services for personally 
identifiable data will be with a High Assurance or HIPAA BAA subscription. If an institution is resp onsible to 
provide data (incoming), they will be responsible for encryption. Thus, the network member identifiers will be 
encrypted both in transit  and at rest . 
 
The identifiers of network members will be firewalled from all other data in two ways. First, they will be 
uploaded and stored in a separate, dedicated fileshare. Second and more importantly, an honest broker within the 
University of Chicago Biostatistics Laboratory will hold the encryption key for the identifiers. Only this 
individual will be able to decrypt the files containing the identifiers (i.e., our protocol achieves end -to-end 
encryption between the laptop in the field and the honest b roker). He or she will monitor the incoming files to 
ensure that the system is working properly, but the files will continue to be stored in encrypted format. The 
honest broker will not be a member of the research team, and will not have access to any of the other data 
collected by [CONTACT_46776].  
 
Finally, the honest broker will provide study subject and network member location  identifiers to one or more 
data analysts who will perform the network matching and geocoding needed to generate files for analysis. This 
analyst (or analysts) will be located at the University of Chicago (e.g., CCHE, the Biostatistics Lab, the Center 
for Spatial Data Science, or Argonne), and his or her only role on the project will be to perform the network 
matching and geocoding. Once this operation has been completed and th e results have undergone QC, the 
original files containing network member identifiers will be destroyed by [CONTACT_502402](s) and the honest 
broker. All network matching and geocoding will take place on a secure compute server maintained by [CONTACT_502403] C omputing Group in the Department of Public Health Sciences. This is the only location where the raw 
files will be decrypted.  
 
After study termination, t he de-identified  study  data may be maintained for up to 10 years  at the University of 
Chicago.  All recordings of study trainings will be destroyed upon study termination.  
 
UAMS will destroy any raw data received from Arkansas Department of Health upon study completion.  
 
The Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) has been chosen by [CONTACT_52993] (NIH) to 
serve as the data coordinating center for all of the RADx -UP study centers.  Coded data for all sites 
participating in our RADx -UP C3 study  will flow from University of Chicago to DCRI for storage and sharing 
 
Page 16 of 19 Version 2023. 09.25  
 purposes for future COVID 19 research as directed  by [CONTACT_18121]  (in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_502376]’s policy) .  All data 
shared in this manner would be deidentified  and could be used indefinitely.

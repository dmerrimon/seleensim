6 months of treatment with COR -003 in the Maintenance Phase  regardless of dose 
increases ;  
• To characterize changes in serum and late night salivary cortisol concentrations 
during the  6 months of treatment with COR -003 in the Maintenance Phase;  
• To assess the effects on Clinical S igns and Symptoms of CS, the quality of life (QoL) 
measures obtained from the Cushing QoL questionnaire and the severity of depression obtained from the Beck’s Depression Inventory II in the Maintenance 
Phase;  
• To evaluate changes in the biomarkers of CS comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, 
hypercholesterolemia and obesity) in the Maintenance Phase;  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of COR -003.

from the Beck’s Depression Inventory II beyond 6 months of treatment  with 
COR -003 ( Extended Evaluation Phase ); 
• To evaluate changes in the biomarkers of CS comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, 
hypercholesterolemia and obesity) beyond 6 months of treatment  with COR -003 
(Extended Evaluation Phase ); 
• To describe the Clinical Benefit  after 6 months of treatment with COR -003 in the 
Maintenance Phase, and after 9 and 12 months  of treatment  (Extended Evaluation 
Phase ), defined as follows:  
o Clinical response as indicated by [CONTACT_395424] ≤ upper limit of normal ( ULN) , and  
o No increase in COR -003 dose  during Maintenance Phase, and  
o A clinically meaningful improvement in any one Baseline  CS co morbidity  
(diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, weight) as defined in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) , and  
o No study drug related treatment -emergent adverse event ( TEAE ) classified as 
severe or worse.  
• To assess changes in anti -diabetic, anti -cholestero l and antihypertensive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_395398] 6 months of treatment with COR -003 in the Maintenance Phase, and after 9 and 
12 months of treatment (Extended Evaluation Phase ); 
• To assess the change in clinical signs of hypercortisolism obtained from standardized 
photographs and rated by [CONTACT_395425] 3 and 6 months of 
treatment with COR -003 in the Maintenance Phase, and after 12 months of treatment 
(Extended Evaluation Phase ). 
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic :  
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of COR -003 in subjects with CS;  
• To explore the dose -response relationship for safety, including dose -response for 
adverse events of special interest (AESI) such as QTc if data allow;  
• To explore the dose -response relat ionship for reduction of UFC levels if data allow.  
Methodology:  This is a single arm, open  label, dose titration study to assess efficacy, safety, 
tolerability, and PK of COR -003 in subjects with endogenous CS as illustrated below.  The 
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- 01 
AMENDMENT 6  Page 15 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 range of effective doses for COR -003 in this CS population will also be established.  
Following an initial screening and washout  period, as applicable, this study will be conducted 
in three  treatment phases as follows:  
• Dose Titration Phase :  approximately 2 to 21 weeks to achieve an effective and 
tolerable maximum dose (the Therapeutic Dose);  
• Maintenance Phase :  6 months of treatment at the Therapeutic Dose following the 
Dose Titration Phase;  
• Extended Evaluation Phase : [ADDRESS_496991] does not meet 
the eligibility requirements, they m ight be eligible to re -screen but only if their underlying 
condition has changed in the interim such that they are now likely to meet study eligibility 
criteria. Such re -screenings will be excep tional circumstances, and all re -screenings require 
prior permission of the study Medical Monitor before they begin. 
After confirmation of eligibility at the Baseline Visit  including confirmation of increased UFC 
levels as per eligibility requirements , subjects will enter into the Dose Titration Phase. Dose 
titration will occur in increments of 150 mg with a starting dose of 150 mg twice daily (BID) over a period of approximately 2 to 21 weeks to achieve an effective and tolerable maxi mum 
dose (the Therapeu tic Dose). Decisions for dose increases will be based on each subject’s 
tolerability, assessment of UFC levels and safety data.   Dose decreases may also occur based 
on subject’s tolerability and safety data.  
Subjects that reach total daily doses of >600 mg /day will be monitored more closely and will 
be asked to return 7 days  (±3 days ) following each dose escalation visit at total daily doses 
>600 mg/day  for an additional safety evaluation. Subjects will be advised to contact [CONTACT_395426][INVESTIGATOR_395399] -specific adverse events (AE) , 
such as adrenal insufficiency or other AEs at any time.  
Once the Therapeutic Dose has been reached and confirmed from the mean of a total of four 
adequately collected 24- hour urine collections for UFC measurements, subjects will enter into 
the Maintenance Phase of the study and will be asked to return to the clinic monthly  [every 
30 days (±7  days) ] for [ADDRESS_496992] of 
the assay unless it is confirmed that a dose increase is deemed medically necessary at the 

Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- 01 
AMENDMENT 6  Page 16 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 discretion o f the Investigator  after discussion with the Medical Monitor . Prior to the End of 
Maintenance Phase Visit , four complete 24- hour urine collections will be obtained and 
subjects may enter the Extended Evaluation Phase.   
In the 6 -month Extended Evaluation P hase, subjects will return to the clinical site every 
90 days (±14 days ) for safety and efficacy evaluations.  
In order to exclude that a treatment effect is due to delayed onset of radiation therapy, 
previously irradiated subjects must stop treatment with  COR -[ADDRESS_496993] 2 weeks after the 
end of the 6- month Maintenance Phase (End of Maintenance Phase Visit) and provide four 
complete 24- hour urine collections for UFC measurements at least [ADDRESS_496994]  may subsequently restart therapy and continue into the Extended Evaluation 
Phase, at the discretion of the Investigator.   They should return for their next in- clinic visit for 
study assessments and resupply of study medication every 3 months [ every 90  days ( ± 14 
days) ] from the End of Maintenance Visit.  
Throughout the study, safety data will be collected at specified times.  Adequate medical 
coverage will be provided at all times during th e course of the study to ensure that prompt 
safety decisions can be made and appropriate medical interventions are provided.  The 
Investigator will provide subjects with instructions on how to access the medical staff 
regardless of day and time in order to  obtain medical care. An independent Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the safety of the drug throughout the study  
After  completion of t reatment in this study , subjects  who do not extend treatment through the 
expanded access program , will have a Follow -Up Visit (a minimum of 2 weeks and no longer 
than 30 days following the completion of treatment).  Once all study assessments have been 
completed, subjects will be promptly referred back to their endocrinologist (if not the 
Investigator) for further management according to the local standard of care, and based on 
their preceding medical history.  [NOTE: The Follow- Up Visit is not required for subjects 
continuing into expanded access treatment.]  
Number of subjects (planned):  A sufficient number of subjects (estimated at approximately 
90) will be enrolled into the Dose Titration Phase of the study to ensure that at least 70 subjects complete the 6 -month Maintenance Phase.   
Inclusion Criteria:  
Subjects will be eligible for the study if all of  the following criteria are met:  
1. Male or female ≥18 years of age 
2. Able to provide written informed consent prior to any study procedures being performed; 
eligible subjects must be able to understand the informed consent form prior to inclusion 
into the study.  
3. Confirmed diagnosis of newly diagnosed, persistent or recurrent Cushing’s d isease ( CD) 
or endogenous CS of other etiology  if subjects are not candidates for surgery or 
radiotherapy  within the 18 months after enrollment . 
Previous medical records will be collected and used to support the diagnosis of CD or endogenous CS of other etiology, including the following etiologies:   
- Ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion, i.e. ACTH not of pi[INVESTIGATOR_269666]  
- Ectopic cor ticotropin- releasing hormone (CRH) secretion 
- Adrenal -dependent CS (i.e. adrenal adenoma (NOT carcinoma), adrenal hyperplasia, 
etc.) 
- Etiology unknown.  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- [ADDRESS_496995] -surgical confirmation of the diagnosis of CD (i.e. 
documented adren al insufficiency post -adenomectomy or hypophysectomy, which will be 
considered diagnostic). The following historical evidence will be considered satisfactory 
to establish the diagnosis of CD:  
Plasma corticotropin  (ACTH) level >20 pg/mL (4.5 pmol/L) or grea ter (Note: ACTH 
≥5 pg/mL (1.1 pmol/L)  and ≤ 20 pg/mL  will generally suffice only if accompanied by 
[CONTACT_5640] a positive CRH stimulation test or D examethasone Suppression Test (DST)  or 
combined CRH -DST) PLUS one of the diagnostic strategies described below base d on 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_303454] (MRI) /computed tomography (CT) findings (Note:

CRH -desmopressin stimulation plus high- dose (8 mg) dexamethasone 
suppression of plasma cortisol, ideally on more than one occasion, performed and interpreted according to internationally recognized standards of diagnosis  
- In the absence of IP SS and the combination of tests described, an individual 
might be eligible if CD was otherwise confirmed via adequate testi ng. Such cases 
must be discussed with and explicitly approved by [CONTACT_1689], and the 
specific diagnostic criteria used to establish the diagnosis of CD must be

 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Disease Background  
Endogenous Cushing´s syndrome (CS) is a rare , serious and potentially lethal endocrine 
disease caused by [CONTACT_395433]. The incidence of 
CS has been estimated to be 2 -3 cases per million per year [ Lindholm 2001 , Steffensen 
2010]. The prevalence of CS  has been reported to be 30- 60 cases per million [ Dalton 
1974, Kreutzer 2009, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_34028] 2005, Sharma 2011]. Patients with incompletely controlled disease are seriously ill and have a 4 to 5- fold higher mortality  rate than age-
and gender matched controls , mainly due to metabolic and cardiovascular complications 
[Lindholm 2001, Mancini 2004, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_34028] 2005].  
Treatment options for CS include surgery, radiation therapy and medical treatment.  Medical treatment is used to sup press excessive cortisol production or activity and 
ameliorate its clinical manifestations , prior to surgery , in patients awaiting the effects of 
radiation therapy [ Nieman 2002] , or in cases when  surgery is delayed, contraindi cated , or 
unsuccessful .  As such, normalization of 24- hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) and normal 
serum or plasma cortisol levels from a low -dose overnight dexamethasone suppression test 
(DST) are considered adequate markers of disease remission [ Bochicchio 1995].  More 
recently, measurement of late night salivary cortisol levels is gaining clinical importance.  Conversely, the persistence of high or only modestly reduced UFC levels argues for treatment failure.  
Ketoconazo le (Nizoral ®, comprised  of two enantiomers : 2S,4R- and 2R,4S -ketoconazole ) 
is an antifungal agent that, at higher dosages, reduces adrenal steroid production via inhibition of multiple steroidogenic enzymes, e.g. 11β -hydroxylase, 17α -hydroxylase and 
aldosterone synthase [ Engelhardt 1991, Sonino 1987, Nizoral 2002]. One publication has 
reported a direct effect on ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion by [CONTACT_253142]. [ Steen 1991]. Because of these properties of ketoconazole, it is a commonly 
used off -label drug for treatment of CS in the US and is approved for the treatment of CS 
in Europe and elsewhere [DeMartin 2006, Daniel 2015, Castinetti [ADDRESS_497017] Insert, Ketoconazole 2014 H RA Assessment Report ]. 
When patients are treated with ketoconazole, adrenal insufficiency is avoided by [CONTACT_395434].  The most frequent adverse effects of ketoconazole are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and pruritus.  Abnormal  liver 
function tests ( LFTs ), primarily of the hepatocellular type, can occur.  Rarely does severe 
hepatotoxicity occur.  Early markers for these side effects are elevations in serum alkaline phosphatase  (AP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
and bilirubin, which are monitored at regular intervals during treatment  [Ketoconazole 
[ADDRESS_497018] Insert , Lake -Bakaar 1987 ; Lewis 
1984] . 
Cortendo AB is developi[INVESTIGATOR_395401] -003, also known as levoketoconazole, the 2S,4R 
enantiomer of ketoconazole, as an investi gational new drug for the treatment of cortisol 
hypersecretion in CS.  It is hypothesized that COR -003 may prove to be both safer and 
more efficacious than ketoconazole.  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- 01 
AMENDMENT 6  Page 31 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 COR -003 has a significantly lower IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) towards  key 
enzymes in cortisol synthesis (11β  -hydroxylase, IC50 = 150 nM; 17 -α-hydroxylase 
[CYP17] , IC50 = 48 nM) than the 2R,4S enantiomer of ketoconazole  (IC50 = 680 nM 
and 1800 nM, respectively, thus potentially allowing a lower dose of drug to achieve the 
same efficacy [ Rotstein 1992, unpublished results from Moulder Center for Drug 
Discovery Research, Temple University School of Pharmacy, 2012]. In rats, COR -[ADDRESS_497019] to reducing corticosterone (the maj or glucocorticoid in 
rodents)  than either  the 2R, 4S -enantiomer or ketoconazole [ Cortendo Report Number 
2002- 02-21]. 
Although elevations in LFTs associated with ketoconazole [ Daneshmend 1988, Kucers 
1997, Whitehouse 1994] are generally modest in nature and reversible following 
cessation of treatment, in rare cases (1 in 10,000 to 15,000 patients) severe hepatotoxicity 
may occur [ Lewis 1984], and in extremely rare cases this adverse reaction may be 
irreversible and life -threatening. Preclinical data suggest that COR -003 may pose les s 
risk to impair hepatic function than ketoconazole . 2S,4R -ketoconazole has 12- fold higher 
IC50 towards  CYP7A (IC50 = 2.4 μM) than does 2R,4S -ketoconazole 
(IC50  = 0.195 μM) [ Rotstein 1992]. CYP7A is the first and rate -limiting enzyme in the 
major (classical) liver pathway for production of bile acids, catalyzing  7α-hydroxylation 
of cholesterol and other oxysterols . Inhibition of this enzyme can lead to functional 
cholestasis and consequent accumulation of potentially toxic me tabolites such as bilirubin 
and xenobiotics such as ketoconazole itself. 
Another  property that suggests potentially improved safety of 2S,4R -ketoconazole  
compared to ketoconazole relates to the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the 2S,4R and 2R,4S 
enantiomers, which have been studied in humans after oral administration of ketoconazole or COR -003 [ Gerber 2003, Schindler 2003, Schwartz 2008]. The 
enantiomers in ketoconaz ole are present in equal amounts , but following ketoconazole 
oral administration blood concentrations of the 2S,4R enantiomer exceed those of the 2R,4S enantiomer by [CONTACT_3450] 3 -fold [ Gerber  2003] , suggesting preferred 
extraction of the 2R,4S enantiomer by [CONTACT_4852]. Reduced hepatic exposure to the 2S,4R enantiomer (COR -003) may be of value in reducing the liver function abnormalities 
observed following administration of racemic ketoconazole. 
COR -003 has been previously administered to healthy volunteers and human subjects 
with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).  Doses of COR -003 over the range of 200 mg to 
600 mg once daily (QD) for up to [ADDRESS_497020] profile 
similar to that of ketoconazole .  Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for a detailed 
description of all prior preclinical  and clinical studies conducted with COR -003. 
1.[ADDRESS_497021] and pi[INVESTIGATOR_395402] -003 in subjects with endogenous CS.  This  is an open label , single  arm study with a 
Screening Phase, a Dose Titration Phase, a 6- month Maintenance Phase, and a 6- month 
Extended Evaluation Phase. An  open label, single  arm design  was chosen , since a 
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- 01 
AMENDMENT 6  Page 32 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 concurrent placebo control as monotherapy was deemed unethical, and a n approved drug 
to serv e as active control (monotherapy)  or as background therapy (adjunctive therapy) 
suitable for an  international study population was unavailable . Pasireotide, which is 
approved in the EU and US, has a different mode of action at the tumor level and 
therefore an indication for Cushing’s disease ( CD) only , and is an injectable with a 
different safety profile, including hyperglycemia , which would preclude  blinding and 
confound evaluation of efficacy and safety signals.  
The chosen  design has considered  the reported experience treating CS patients with 
ketoconazole  [Castinetti 2014 ].  Like ketoconazole, dosing of COR -003 needs to be 
individualized, since therapeutic need varies considerably among patients .  Response  to 
therapy  (i.e. normalization of UFC  and clinical signs and symptoms ) is equally variable 
and results in a wide range of effective doses , each  tailored to an  individual patient.  As 
such, the design of this study includes an initial Dose Titration Phase that will identify a  
tolerable and effective dose for each subject, which will then be administered during the 
subsequent Maintenance Phase of the study , intended to be  without further dose 
increases . The Maintenance Phase was designed  to demonstrate durability  of the 
therapeutic response and, together with the Extended Evaluation Phase, provides  
long-term efficacy and safety data.

4 STUDY D ESIGN  
This is  a single arm, open  label, dose titration  study to assess efficacy, safety, tolerability, 
and PK of COR -003 in subjects with endogenous CS as illustrated in Figure 1.  The range 
of effective doses  for COR -003 in this CS population will also be established .  Following 
an initial screening and wash out period, as applicable, this study will be conducted in 
3 treatment phases as follows:  
• Dose Titration Phase :  approximately 2 to 21 weeks to achieve an effective and 
tolerable maximum dose (the Therapeutic Dose) —see Section 4.2 for details; 
• Maintenance Phase:  6 months of treatment at the Therapeutic Dose following 
the Dose Titration Phase;  
• Extended Evaluation Phase : 6 months of continued treatment after the 
Mainten ance Phase.  
Figure 1  Study Design  
 
 
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_395436] ( Appendix A ). 
Blood samples for PK determination will be collected as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
Note that the times indicated in the Time and Events Table  (Appendix A ) are indicative 
of potential c ollection times and do not apply to each subject. 
Safety data will be collected at the times indicated in the Time and Events Table and as described in Section 6.2.  Adequate medical coverage will be provided by [CONTACT_395437] (including nights, weekends and holidays) to ensure that prompt safety decisions can be made and appropriate medical interventions provided.  The Investigator should provide all subjects with instructions on 

Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- [ADDRESS_497022] (DSMB) will review the safety of 
the drug throughout the study.  At a minimum, the DSMB membership will consist of a n 
endocrinologist  with expertise in the treatment and clinical investigation of CS ; a 
gastroenterologist/hepatologist with expertise in the assessment of abnormal LFTs and 
hepatotoxicity during cli nical study conduct; and an expert in the evaluation of QTc 
interval during clinical study conduct/clinical pharmacologist. The full extent of responsibilities by [CONTACT_395438].  
Subjects completing the 6 -month Maintenance Phase of the study with COR -003 will 
remain in the study for an additional 6 months for extended evaluations of safety and 
efficacy of COR -003 treatment  (Extended Evaluation Phase) .   
At the completion of the 6- month Extended Evaluation Phase, subjects may be eligible to 
enter an expanded access program and receive continued treatment with COR -[ADDRESS_497023] (if not the Investigator) for further management according to the local standard of care, and based on their preceding medical history .  (Note: As subjects  
entering the expanded access program for COR -003 will not be discontinuing treatment 
with COR -003, they will not be required to complete the Follow -Up Visit for this study.)  
4.[ADDRESS_497024] enter a washout period, as applicable (see Section 5) before completing all Screening assessments detailed in the Time and Events Table (Appendix A ).  Baseline measurements will be obtained as part of the Screening 
assessments, after washout and completion of all initial Screening procedures. 
If a subject does not initially meet the eligibility requirements described in Section 5, 
they m ight be eligible to re -screen but only if their underlying condition has changed in 
the interim such that they are now likely  to meet study eligibility criteria.  Such 
re-screenings wil l be exceptional circumstances, and all re- screenings require prior 
permission of the study Medical Monitor before they begin.  
4.[ADDRESS_497025] will return to the investigational site to receive study medication and will begin dosing at dose level 1 (DL1) with an initial dose of 150 mg twice daily (BID), taken as one tablet in the morning and one tablet 
in the evening.  Decisions for subsequent dose increases will be based on an assessment of each subject’s UFC levels and safety data (i.e. tolerabilit y of therapy) and will be made 
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- 01 
AMENDMENT 6  Page 39 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 by [CONTACT_737].  The interval between dose adjustments will be approximately 
18 days ( ±4 days)  
4.2.1 Dose Titration and Adjustment Criteria  
COR -003 will be administered BID according to the titration scheme in Table 1  until one  
of the following criteria has been met:  
• Mean 24 -hour UFC levels ≤ULN as established for the assay being used at a central

except on the day of the in- clinic procedures, when the dose should be administered in the clinic  
(see Section 8.2.1 ). 
All subjects will be asked to collect two adequate 24 -hour urine specimens starting at 
Day 10 ( ±1 day) after the start of each dose level , ideally on two consecutive days .  The 
subjects are asked to bring or ship per courier service their two urine collections to the 
clinic , as soon as possible ( approximately Day 12 ) for measurement of 24 -hour UFC 
levels from each sample.  Urine volume and creatinine will be measured as markers of the adequacy of each collection  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] f or definition).  Subjects will 
continue on their current dose of COR -[ADDRESS_497026] been obtained from 
the central laboratory (within approximately 2 -4 days  of shipment ).  Based on their UFC 
results and tolerability, subjects will be asked to  do one  of the following:   
• Return to the clinic  for scheduled assessments and receive the first dose of drug 
for the next Dose Titration interval ; 
• Have a confirmatory UFC evaluation (e.g. two  additional UFC measurements to 
determine if the Therapeutic Do se of COR -003 has been reached; 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) ; or 
• Enter the Maintenance Phase (if an alternative determination of Therapeutic Dose 
of COR -003 has been made; Section [IP_ADDRESS])  as applicable.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Determination of the Effective and Tolerable Dose of COR-003 
(Therapeutic Dose)  
When a subject achieves normalized UFC results (≤ULN for UFC) from the mean of  the 
first two adequately collected [ADDRESS_497027] will be considered established when mean UFC levels (determined from a t otal of four adequate 24 -hour urine collections) are ≤ULN of the 
assay, or the maximum dose allowed has been reached, or a clinically meaningful partial response and the maximal tolerated dose has been reached.  Once the Therapeutic Dose has been reached t he subject can begin the Maintenance Phase of the study.  
Steps for Determination of Therapeutic Dose  
• If the mean value for the first two  UFC test levels  is ≤ULN  of the assay of two 
adequate [ADDRESS_497028] should be notified immediat ely and 
asked to begin  the next two 24- hour urine collections , for the purpose of confirming a 
biochemical response .  The two additional urine collections should be completed and 
return ed to the clinic , as soon as practical (for example, if samples were provided to 
site on Day [ADDRESS_497029] should ideally  begin collection the following day (Day 16) and return the 
two additional samples to the site immediately upon completion of collection (Day 18).  The next visit  for the subject should be scheduled to coincide with receipt of the 
results  (Day 30 [± 7 days])  and the  mean  of the four UFC  test value s is available  to 
make the determination of whether or not the Therapeutic Dose has been achieved.  
• When confirmatory urine sample collection is required, in order to allow for adequate 
time for urine sample collection and analysis between visits, the subject should return 
no later than 37 days after the prior dose escalation visit for either the next dose 
escalation visit or start of the Maintenance Phase (based on the mean of the four  UFC 
values) [NOTE: Always ensure that the subject has an adequate supply of COR -003 to 
cover the duration between visits.]  
• If the mean value of four adequate 24 -hour urine collections is ≤ULN  of the assay , the 
subject may enter the Maintenance Phase at the current dose level  (i.e. Therapeutic 
Dose level) [ Section 4.3] .  The total duration of the Titration Phase should not be any 
longer than  approximately  21 Weeks; assuming approximately 3 weeks of treatment 
for each dose level.  
• If the mean  value of four a dequate 24 -hour urine collections is  >ULN  of the assay of 
four adequate 24- hour urine collections , the subject should proceed to the next Dose 
Level.  
Alternative Determination of Therapeutic Dose 
• If the subject has reached the highest allowed  dose level an d UFC levels remain 
>ULN of the assay for the mean of two adequate [ADDRESS_497030] may enter the 
Maintenance Phase at that dose level.  
• If the subject has reached th e highest tolerated  dose and UFC levels remain >ULN of 
the assay for the mean of two adequate [ADDRESS_497031] may enter the Maintenance Phase at that dose level at the discretion of the Investigator.  
• If UFC is >ULN and LFTs are elevated , the Investigator may maintain the dose in the 
Dose Titration Phase in consultation with the Medical Monitor before a decision is made to progress to the next dose level or into Maintenance Phase.
  
NOTE:  If UFC levels remain >ULN of the assay for the mean of two adequate [ADDRESS_497032] tolerated dose, discontinuation should be considered. Consultation with the Medical Monitor is encouraged. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Titration to the Therapeutic Dose  
Subjects will continue the process of dose t itration until the Therapeutic Dose has been 
reached  (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) .  
• If UFC levels are >ULN of the assay for the mean of two adequate [ADDRESS_497033] protocol -specified dose has already been reached.  
• If UFC levels are >ULN  of the assay for the mean of two adequate [ADDRESS_497034] should return no later than 22 days ( 18 days ± 4 days) after 
the prior dose escalation visit for the next dose escalation visit.  
Other factors that are to be considered during the Dose Titration Phase:  
• Subjects will have ECG evaluations at Baseline and within approximately 1 to 
2 hours after drug administration (i.e., at ~  Cmax)  during the Dose Titration Phase at 
each dose level), monthly (at the Therapeutic Dose)  during the Maintenance Phase 
and at each visit during the Exten ded Evaluation Phase using the Spaulding ECG 
device for collection of up to 5 minutes of continuous ECG  (Section 6.2.4) .  The dose 
of study medication will be reduced if the confirmed COR -003-related QTc interval 
persistentl y increases to >500 msec or >60 msec from Baseline. Please refer to 
Section 5.3.1 where guidance to the Investigator  on the assessment of the prolonged 
QTc interval is provided in detail.  
• If the subject develops signs and/or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain), based on further 
investigation (see Section 6.3.3) and clinical judgment, the Investigator may temporarily stop dosing of the study medication to allow resolution of these 
symptoms.  In such cases, at the discretion of the Investigator, the dose will be reduced and restarted at a preceding dose level (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  In the event that 
this observation is made at DL1, the subjects may receive a lower dose of 150 mg once daily (DL0)  based on the medical discretion of the Investigator and agreement 
with the Sponsor.  Subjects may resume the Dose Titration scheme after a dose

AMENDMENT 6  Page 42 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 reduction at the discretion of the Investigator and agreement with the Sponsor.  See 
Section 6.3.3 for details on assessment of signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency.  
4.2.2 Dose Titration A bove 600 Mg Total Daily Dose 
COR -003 has only been dosed up to 600 mg/day in diabetic subjects. The safety in 
subjects at doses beyond 600 mg/day is unknown. For this reason, subjects that reach total daily doses of > 600 mg/day (i.e., doses of 750, 900, 1050, and 1200 mg/day) must be monitored more close ly in order to ensure proper evaluation of the safety of doses at 
these levels.  In addition to the assessments that will be carried out during dose escalation 
for doses ≤600 mg/day, for each dose escalation beyond 600 mg/day, subjects will be 
asked to ret urn for one additional safety evaluation  7 days  (±3 days)  after each dose 
escalation to include the following assessments:  AEs, vital signs, routine safety laboratory assessments (including LFTs), ECGs, and morning serum cortisol levels as outlined in Tim e and Events T able (
Appendix A ).  Subjects will be advised to contact [CONTACT_395426][INVESTIGATOR_395403] (see Section  6.3) or other AEs at any time.  
• Return 7 days  (±3 days ) after each dose level escalation visit for DL4 through DL7 for 
additional safety assessment (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) ;  
• Start the collection of two adequate 24 -hour urine samples  10 days  (±1 day)  after the 
dose level escalation visit for DL4 through DL7 -  provide containers to sites as soon as 
possible after completion  (approximately 12 days after dose level escalation) ; 
• If the mean  value for the  first two adequate 24 -hour urine collections  is >ULN  of the 
assay , the subject should r eturn no later than 22 days (1 8 days ± 4 day s) after the prior 
dose escalation visit for next dose escalation visit ;  
• If the mean  value for the first two adequate 24 -hour urine collections  is ≤ULN  of the 
assay and  additional UFC tests are needed to confirm  the mean value of  ≤ULN , the 
subject should be notified to collect an additional two  24-hour urine  samples and 
return them to the site, as soon as possible after completion  (see timing details in  
Section [IP_ADDRESS]) .  
 
The results of relevant assessments should be available promptly in order for the Investigator to make decisions for the safety of the subject.  Reports of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) experienced at these higher doses will be  shared with all Investigators 
regularly during the study.  
4.[ADDRESS_497035] visit during the Maintenance Phase will be called “Month 1” 
and will take place on the first day of Month 1 of the Maintenance Phase. After the Month 1 visit, subjects will be asked to return to the clinic monthly  (every 30 ± 7 days)  
for approximately 6 months f or assessment of efficacy and safety (as outlined in the Time 
and Events Table [ Appendix A ]).   
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- [ADDRESS_497036] UFC samples to provide a total 
of four UFC samples for analysis .  If confirmed  hypercortisolemia is present, the COR -
003 dose may be increased by 150 -mg increments as  medically indicated up to the 
maximally allowed dose of 1200 mg/day, and the subject may stay in the study  through 
completion. 
During the Maintenance Phase the COR -003 dose may also be reduced temporarily or 
permanently for safety reasons , including but not limited to LFT elevation (see 
Section  5.3.2, instructions for re -challenge) , QTc prolongation (Section 5.3.1) and 
adrenal insufficiency (Section 6.3.3) . If medically indicated, the dose should be resumed 
at the individual ’s Therapeutic Dose.  All dose adjustments  during the Maintenance 
Phase  must be documented.   
4.4 Transition from Maintenance Phase to Extended Evaluation Phase 
Prior to  the End of Maintenance Phase Visit , four complete 24- hour urine collections will 
be obtained and subjects may enter the Extended Evaluation Phase  (Section 4.5) .

measurements  collected at least [ADDRESS_497038] may 
subsequently restart thera py and continue into the Extended Evaluation P hase, a t the 
discretion of the Investigator  (Section 4.5) .  [NOTE: S ubjects  restarting therapy should 
initiate therapy as soon as the need is identified and should return for their next in- clinic 
visit (M9) for study assessments and resupply of study medication 90 days  (±14 days ) 
from the End of Maintenance Visit.]  
4.5 Extended Evaluation Phase  
The end of the Maintenance Phase visit will be the start of the Extended Evaluation 
Phase. In the 6- month Extended Evaluation Phase, subjects will return to the clinical site 
every 3 months  (every 90  days  ± 14 days)  for assessments, (i.e., at the end of Months 9 
and 12), and will have safety and efficacy evaluations as indicated in the Time and Events Table ( Appendix A ).

AMENDMENT 6  Page 44 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 After completion of treatment in this study, if subjects do not extend treatment through 
the expanded access program (Section 4.7), they will return for a Follow -Up Visit as 
indicated in the Time and Events Table ( Appendix A ).  The Follow -Up Visit should be  a 
minimum of  2 weeks  (14 days)  and no longer than 30 days following the completion of 
treatment . [NOTE: The Follow -Up Visit is not required for subjects continuing into 
expanded access treatment (see Section 4.7)].  
4.6 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_395404]:  
• Intolerability to the study medication based on the subjects’ signs or symptoms in accordance with the Investigator’s medical judgment  
• Lack of any clinically relevant response at the maximally tolerated dose, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]  
• QTc prolongation as specified in Section 5.3.1 at 150 mg/day  
• LFT abnormalities as specified in Section 5.3.2 
• Adrenal insufficiency at the lowest dose of COR -003 (150 mg daily) —See also 
Section 6.3.3 for more details  
• Any withdrawal criteria specified in Section 5.3.  
 
Subjects who are withdrawn early will complete  the Follow -Up Visit (see Appendix A ) 
and provide two adequate 24- hour urine collections  within approximately [ADDRESS_497039] (if not the Investigator) for further management according to the local standard of care and based on their preceding medical history.   
4.7 Optional Expanded Access Program 
An expanded access program  (COR -2015- EAP)  will be made available, as local 
regulations allow, to  sites participating in this study.  Subject  interest and eligibility for 
participating in the expanded access program will be evaluated at  the M9 visit, including 
the informed consent process.  If eligible, they will begin participation in the COR -2015- EAP program upon completion of the M12 visit.  S ubjects continuing into 
expanded access program  will NOT  be required to complete the Follow -Up Visit for 
COR -2012- 01.  
If a subject completing COR -2012- [ADDRESS_497040] regulatory approval to 
provide access to COR -003 under the expanded access program wishes to continue 
COR -003 treatment after completing this study, Cortendo will make a reasonable effort 
to provide continued access to the medication through another access option that meets all applicable local and national regulatory  requirements.

hyperplasia, etc.)  
• Etiology unknown  
 
In the absence of pathological or pos t-surgical confirmation of the diagnosis of CD 
(i.e. documented adrenal insufficiency post -adenomectomy or hypophysectomy, 
which will be considered diagnostic). The following historical evidence will be considered satisfactory to establish the diagnosis of  CD: 
• Plasma corticotropin  (ACTH) level >20 pg/mL (4.5 pmol/L) or greater 
(Note: ACTH ≥5 pg/mL (1.1 pmol/L) and ≤ 20 pg/mL will generally suffice 
only if accompanied by [CONTACT_5640] a positive CRH stimulation test or DST or 
combined CRH -DST ) PLUS  one of the diagnostic strategies described below 
based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_299446]/computed tomography (CT) findings (Note: pi[INVESTIGATOR_395405] a requirement for eligibility):

occasion, performed and interpreted according to internationally 
recognized standards of diagnosis  
− In the absence of IPPS and the combination of tests described, an individual might be eligible if CD was otherwise confirmed via adequat e 
testing. Such cases must be discussed with and explicitly approved by [CONTACT_5134] , and the specific diagnostic criteria used to establish the 
diagnosis of CD must be documented.  
• For tumors <6 mm  or not visible by [CONTACT_9268]:  
− IPSS with ACTH central:plasma gradient ≥ 2 before CRH or ≥ 3 after CRH

OTE: For subjects with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR as 
determined by [CONTACT_303522]) >40 and <60 mL/min/1.[ADDRESS_497043] results (≥2 measurements) MUST  also demonstrate evidence of CS.  
6. Previously irradiated subjects with CD or endogenous CS of  other etiology will be 
allowed as long as the radiation treatment occurred >[ADDRESS_497044]-surgery ( i.e., no significant post -operative sequelae remain and the risk of such 
sequelae is considered negligible ). 
8. Subjects on treatment for CD or endogenous CS of other etiology for whom treatment has been i nadequate or not well tolerated must agree to the following minimum 
washout periods prior to the Baseline Visit:

Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- [ADDRESS_497053] the right to discontinue participation in the study at an y time. Reasons for 
withdrawal during the study may include, but are not limited, to the following:  
• Withdrawal of informed consent . 
• Safety reasons, as stipulated in Section s 5.3.[ADDRESS_497054]’s request (see also Secti on 4.6, Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_134248]).  
• Protocol violations at the discretion of the Sponsor. 
• Concomitant therapy that could interfere with the results of the s tudy (the 
Investigator will report all such information on the case report forms [ CRFs ] and 
decide, in accordance with the Sponsor, whether the subject is to be withdrawn).  
All premature discontinuations and their causes must be carefully documented by [CONTACT_395439], and, if need be, on the AE page.   
If, for any reason, a subject is withdrawn before completing the study, the reason for termination will be entered in the CRF.  All data gathered on the subject prior to termination will be made  available to the Sponsor.  All withdrawn subjects will be asked 
to report to the clinic for a F ollow -Up Visit at approximately [ADDRESS_497055] dose of the study medication.  All assessments at the F ollow -Up Visit are listed in the 
Time and Events Table ( Appendix A ). All AEs will be followed until resolution or at a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_497056] dose of the study medication.   
5.3.1 Withdrawal due QTc Interval Prolongation  
If a persistent and confirmed COR -003-related QTc interval prolongation >500 msec or a 
change from Baseline of >60 msec  as defined below is identified , an attempt should be 
made to manage such QTc prolongations by [CONTACT_29874]. If a pe rsistent and confirmed 
COR -003-related QTc interval prolongation >500 msec or a change from Baseline of 
>[ADDRESS_497057] COR -003 dose (150 mg/day), a dministration of the 
study drug will cease and the subject will be withdrawn.   
In order to decide whether a QTc prolongation is persistent and confirmed to be related to COR -003, QTc will be evaluated using the Spaulding ECG device  or a local ECG device 
with central reading of the ECG by [CONTACT_119286] . The Investigator should consider 
alternative  possibilities as causative or contributory to QTc prolongation prior to 
discontinuation of COR -003, including  concomitant medications that may result in 
prolongation of the QTc interval either directly or through interference with the metabolism of COR -003, recent food ingestion (temporary QTc elevation), and 
electrolyte abnormalities (particularly serum calcium, magnesium and potassium). Interfering concomitant medications with QT prolongation potential are contraindicated in co -administration with COR -[ADDRESS_497058] be stopped (Section 10.2
). Please also see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for guidance on the assessment of QTc interval prolongation. Regardless 
of seriousness or causality, instances of persistent QTc prolongation should be reported to 
the Sponsor’s designated P harmacovigilance group within 24 hours  from the time the 
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- 01 
AMENDMENT 6  Page 51 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 persistent prolongation has been confirme d, in the same manner as SAEs  (see 
Section  13.2.2) .  
If persistent and confirmed QTc prolongation, as defined above, is observed, an 
additional PK sample should be collected as close to the time of the event as possible , 
ideally within several hours of dosing . 
5.3.2 Withdrawal and/or Re-Challenge due to Liver Function Tests (LFTs)  
The recommendations within the F ood and D rug Administration (FDA)  Guidance on 
Drug -Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation (May 2009) have been 
adopted for use in this protocol to address abnormal LFTs .  LFTs will be measured at 
every study visit. In addition, LFTs will be measured immediately if subjects develop signs and symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (any of the following: nausea, anorexia, fever, fatigue, right upper quadrant discomfort, pruritus, dark urine or acholic stool).  Nausea, anorexia, and fatigue are non -specific symptoms and may be caused 
by [CONTACT_299550]; however, appropriate medical evaluation of such symptoms 
must include assessment of LFTs.   Other  testing including  laboratory assessments to 
assess causality ( such as, hepatitis [A, B, C, E], autoimmunity ), imaging  and consultation 
with a liver specialist should be obtained prior to a planned withdrawal of the subject  due 
to elevated LFTs .  Appropriate medical evaluations and interventions should be 
implemented based on the clinical presentation of the subject, including appropriate 
diagnostic imaging procedures.  All such medical interventions will be recorded in the CRF. While LFTs may be assayed at a local lab for immediate medical intervention, simultaneous samples must be sent to the central laboratory to ensure consistency of 
assay and interpretation.  
Subjects withdrawn due to LFT abnormalities must be followed until LFT normalization  
or until near Baseline values and stable.  Subjects not withdrawn from the study  may  be 
re-challenged  after resolution of LFT abnormalities, at the discretion of the Investigator 
AND with approval by [CONTACT_395440].  
In agreement with FDA Guidance of 2009, discontinuation of therapy should be 
considered if:  
• ALT or AST >8X ULN  
• ALT or AST rises to >5X ULN in <4 weeks or persists for >2 weeks  
• ALT or AST >3X ULN and TBN  >2X ULN or International Normalized Ratio 
(INR) >1.5 not explained by [CONTACT_395441], and without 
evidence of cholestasis  
• ALT or AST >3X ULN with new onset of or worsening of fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, fever, rash or eosinophilia, in the absence of other evident cause  
• Signs and /or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfuncti on (any of the following: 
nausea, anorexia, fever, fatigue, right upper quadrant discomfort, pruritus, dark 
urine or acholic stool) coupled with ALT and/or AST >3X ULN and/or AP >2X ULN, and/or TBN >2X ULN in the absence of evidence for obstruction or Gilbert 
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- [ADDRESS_497059] should be 
conducted to exclude cholestasis as the cause for elevated AP and/or TBN.  
  
Subjects with ALT and/or AST >3X ULN or AP >2X ULN ( in the absence of evidence 
for cholestasis ) or TBN >2X ULN ( in the absence of evidence for cholestasis and except 
for subjects enrolled with presumed Gilbert’s syndrome) at any visit will undergo serial 
repeat LFT and INR evaluations. The first repeat LFT should occur as soon as possible after initial determination to confirm the observation and thereafter at [ADDRESS_497060] will continue to be followed after withdrawal until resolution or normalization of the laboratory abnormality that resulted in the withdrawal.  
If on serial measurements and in the absence of clinical signs or sympt oms, the ALT 
and/or AST continue to rise (but TBN  do not exceed the cut -offs for study drug 
cessation/early termination), subjects will continue on study drug and protocol unless the ALT and/or AST levels are >8X  or are persistently higher than  5X ULN. If the ALT 
and/or AST levels exceed these levels, the subject should stop taking the study 
medication immediately.  
[ADDRESS_497061] timings of each assessment are provided in the Time and Events Table (Appendix A ).  Detailed procedures  are provided in the Study Procedures Manual .  The 
study is being  conducted and reported in accordance with the guidelines presented in 
Appendix D  and Appendix E .  Any changes to the study design are  managed in 
accordance with Appendix F . 
In addition to the protocol -specified procedures, at any time during the study 
appropriate medical evaluations and safety interventions should be implemented, as necessary, based on the clinical presentation of the subject according to standard of care, at the discretion of the Investigator.  Changes to the medical conditions, history and medications and all other medical interventions will be documented in the CRFs  as unsche duled visits . 
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- [ADDRESS_497062] of the following phases with approximate timings: 
• Screening P hase ( up to approximately 12 weeks’  duration, prior to  first dose)  
• Dose Titration P hase (approximately 2 -21 weeks’  duration)  
• Maintenance P hase (6 months’  dura tion) 
• Extended E valuation P hase (6 months’  duration)  
After signing the informed consent, subjects will enter the Screening Phase.  After 
performing the initial Screening assessments, subjects on previous CS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_395407] a washout period, as applicable (see Section 5.1) before completing all Screening 
assessments detailed in the Time and Events Table ( Appendix A ).  Basel ine evaluations 
will be obtained as part of the Screening assessments and  should be conducted AFTER 
completion of all initial Screening procedures and after subjects have undergone a sufficient washout period from previous CS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( see Section 5.1), if applicable. 
Results from the Baseline assessments are necessary in order to determine if the subject remains eligible for participation in the study.  Please see the Study Procedure Manual (SPM ) for details on urine collections.  
All subjects must meet all eligibility criteria prior to the first dosing.   
A screen failure subject is one from whom a signed informed consent is obtained but who has not started on treatment and failed to meet some or all eligibility criteria at Baseline.  
With  approval by [CONTACT_37755], s ubjects may have repeated assessments 
of laboratory values for screening purposes to confirm eligibility if the condition limiting 
their participation has cha nged and is no longer limiting .  Re-screening is allowed for 
subject s with changes in their medical condition that alters th eir potential to meet the 
eligibility criteria.  All re -screenings are considered exceptional and require prior 
permission of the Medical Monitor. 
6.1 Demographic/Medical History Assessments  
The following demographic parameters will be c aptured at  Screening:   
• Date of birth  
• Gender  
• Race and ethnicity  
Medical and medication history will be assessed and collected as related to the Eligibility Criteria in Section 5.1 and will include the following, as available:  
• An effort will be made to collect the following information for documentation of medical history as part of this study:  
 Documentation of diagnosis of CS, including but not limited to evaluations for CS  for the previous 6 months, e.g., levels of UFC, late 
night salivary and/or serum cortisol, DST results, IPSS results and 
diagnostic imaging results  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- 01 
AMENDMENT 6  Page 54 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
  Documentation of associated metabolic complications (e.g., diabetes, 
hypertension, osteoporosis, and reproductive dysfunction)  
 Documentation of  prior management of CS for the previous 3 months, 
including medications (capturing doses, duration of treatment, time of discontinuation and reason for discontinuation of medication) and any surgical or radiation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
• Available clinical laboratory data for the previous 3 months; specifically: LFTs 
(ALT, AST, AP, direct and TBN ), HbA1c, fasting serum glucose, OGTT, serum 
lipid panel (L DL-C, HDL-C, total cholesterol , triglyceride s), CRP, urinary 
albumin/creatinine ratio, testosterone and IGF -1 concentrations  
• Available blood pressure data for the previous 3 months  
• Medication history (all medications, including any non- prescription medications, 
other than those to treat CS specifically) taken within 3 months prior to Screening 
with particular attention to blood pressure, anti -diabetic and cholesterol lowering 
drugs  
• History of drug and alcohol use . 
6.2 Safety and Efficacy Assessments  
6.2.1 Physical Examination and Assessment of Clinical Signs and Symptoms 
of CS  
Full physical e xaminations will be performed by a physician at the times indicated in the 
Time and Events Table ( Appendix A ).  The physical examinations will be inclusive of all 
body s ystems, and should include height (cm) and weight (kg). Abdominal girth will be 
measured in triplicate at the times indicated in the Time and Events T able and as 
described in the SPM.  BMI will be calculated based on data entered into the CRF during 
that visit.   
The examining physician will be asked to complete a questionnaire related to the assessment of Clinical Signs and Symptoms  of CS (see  Appendix M ).  The results will be 
used to quantify changes in Clinical Signs and Symptoms of CS.  Details regarding these assessments will be provided in the SPM.  
6.2.[ADDRESS_497063] photographs will be taken for consenting subjects to document visible signs of 
hypercortisolism at the times indicated in the Time and Events Table ( Appendix A ) as 
described in the COR -2012- 01 Photography Manual .   
6.2.3 Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements will include temperature, sitting SBP, DBP and heart rate (HR) at Baseline and at each visit throughout the s tudy (see Time and Events Table in 
Appendix A ).   
For proper measurement of blood pressure, the following procedures should be followed:  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- 01 
AMENDMENT 6  Page 55 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 • Use of an appropriately sized c uff for the size of the subject’s arm circumference 
should be utilized to minimize inaccurate readings.  The sites may use available 
cuffs on site for these measurements.  
• No smoking or exercise for at least 30 minutes before a blood pressure 
measurement . 
• Subjects should sit in a chair with a back support and the arm supported at heart 
level with feet flat on the floor. The subject should void prior to the measurement.  
• Blood pressure measurements will be measured in triplicate over a minimum of 
approximately  [ADDRESS_497064] be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors occur.  Out of range blood pressure or HR measurements will be repeated at the Investigator’s discretion.  Any confirmed, clinically significant change from Base line 
vital sign measurements must be recorded as AEs.  
Guidelines for classification for blood pressure levels and recommendations for follow -
up are provided in Appendix I . 
6.2.4 12-Lead Electrocardiograms (ECG)  
Male p atients with CS have been reported to have prolongation of the QT interval  
[Giraldi 2011] .  Thus, the inclusion criteria have allowed for this possibility and both 
males and females with QTc prolonga tion will be allowed into the study with Baseline 
QTc ≤470 msec.  
QTc interval is highly variable during the course of a day. Food intake can increase QTc interval s. Nausea, vomiting, upset stomach, and dizziness can also cause prolongation in 
the QTc interval, as well as electrolyte abnormalities (low serum magnesium, calcium and potassium levels).  
Many drugs can prolong the QTc interval directly, or in the case of COR -003, through 
interference with the metabolism of COR -003 causing levels of the drug to increase, thus 
resulting in a prolongation of the QTc.  
In this study, ECG monitoring is being performed at the designated times (as in the Time and Events T able in Appendix A ), ideally  using the Spaulding ECG device continuously 
for a maximum of 5 minutes.   
It will be upon this integrated summary result that QTc prolongation will initially be identified. The integrated summary of the ECG assessments (including arrhythmia analysis) will be done centrally after electronic transmission of the data, along with real -
time results provided to the Investigator.  
NOTE:   ECGs during the Screening Visit (single ECGs) are not required to be performed 
using the Spaulding ECG device. The Spaulding ECG device should be used at the 
Baseline Visit and for all subsequent assessments  during the study .  In the event that the 
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- 01 
AMENDMENT 6  Page 56 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 Spaulding ECG device is not available, a local ECG may be performed (following the 
below guidance) and transmitted to Spaulding  via a paper printout of the recording . 
ECGs will be obtained within approximately 1 to 2 hours after drug administration (i.e., at approximately Cmax of COR -003). ECGs will be obtained after the subject has rested 
in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] [ADDRESS_497065] 2 hours. A small snack will be allowed for diabetic subjects and subjects who are in tolerant of fasting  since food intake can prolong QTc intervals . Food 
intake has to be recorded in the CRF.  The recording from the continuous ECG  
(maximum of 5 minutes)  reading with the Spaulding device will be uploaded 
electronically to a computer and su bsequently transmitted over the internet for centralized 
analysis and archiving.  The system will provide automated measurements of HR, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] ( RR), PR, QRS, QT, QTcF and QTcB and ECG diagnostic statements to 
the investigative site within a short time following the completion and uploading of the recording.  A central reader cardiologist, not involved in the conduct of the study, will subsequently evaluate the ECGs.   It is imperative that the transmission of all ECGs to 
the central reader takes  place as soon as possible after the completion of the test to 
allow for the proper medical evaluation of the subject should QTc prolongations 
occur.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prolongation of QTc I nterval > 500 Msec or > [ADDRESS_497066]  >500 msec or 
>60 msec above Baseline .  
Subjects with prolonged QTc intervals >500 msec or >[ADDRESS_497067] be medically observed until the QTc has returned to a value ≤500 msec or ≤ 60 msec change from Baseline.  
The following need to be considered in cases of QTc prolongation:  
• If the integrated ECG reading de monstrates a QTc prolongation > 60 msec fro m 
Baseline or an absolute QTc >[ADDRESS_497068].  
• The subject should also be questioned about the use of any other medications that 
may have increased QTc interval, either directly because of their direct effect on the 
QTc interval or indirectly as a result of a drug inter action that may have increased the 
concentrations of COR -003. If such a drug is identified, it should be stopped 
immediately.  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- 01 
AMENDMENT 6  Page 57 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 • The subject should be evaluated for symptoms of nause a or recent vomiting prior to 
the ECG assessment, lightheadedness or other symptoms that may influence the QTc 
interval. In such cases , the ECG evaluation should be conducted once the subject's 
symptoms have abated. COR -[ADDRESS_497069] to be withheld if the symptoms 
are protracted and the QTc interval prolongation remains evident. The Investigator should ensure that the symptoms as well as the ECG results are not due to a cardiovascular event, such as a myocardial infarction.  
• If the subject has not eaten, has no confounding medical symptoms/events, does not 
have a concomitant medication that may be increasing the QTc interval, and there are 
no other significant abnormalities on the ECG warranting immediate medical intervention, a repeat ECG evaluation should be undertaken within approximately 30 minutes of the observed ECG prolongation or as soon as it is practical.  
• If the repeat ECG evaluation continues to demonstrate QTc prolongation >60 msec 
above Baseline or an absolute value of >[ADDRESS_497070] for evaluation of electrolyte abnormalities, including  potassium, 
magnesium and calcium concentrations in addition to routine electrolytes and for a 
PK evaluation. If electrolyte abnormalities are identified, these should be corrected before re -evaluation of the ECG. COR -003 may be temporarily withheld until 
electrolytes can be normalized.  
If electroly tes are normal and no other cause can be identified to account for the absolute 
QTc interval >500 msec (or >60 msec above  Baseline ), and the ECG evaluation on repeat 
determination demonstrated persistent QTc prolongation, causal relationship to COR -003 
should be assumed and COR -003 should be withheld. The ECG should be monitored per 
discretion of the Investigator  until resol ution of the QTc prolongation.  In all cases, 
abnormal morphology of the ECG (especially T wave changes), if present, will be recorded in the CRF.  
If the subject is on the lowest possible dose of COR -003 (150 mg/day) and has persistent 
and COR -003-related  QTc interval prolongation >500 msec or a change from Baseline of 
>[ADDRESS_497071] will be 
withdrawn .  
At higher doses, an attempt should be made to manage persistent QTc prolongations that are deemed to be related to COR -003 by [CONTACT_395442] a lower dose after 
resolution of QTc prolongation as described below.  If persistent and confirmed QTc 
prolongation is observed, an additional PK sample should be collected as close to the time of  the event as possible , ideally within several hours of dosing . 
Persistent and confirmed QTc prolongation are defined as follows:  
• Persistence:  The [ADDRESS_497072] 
ECG revealing a QTc prolongation to confirm the persistent reading.  
• Confirmation:  The Investigator should consider alternative possibilities as causative or contributory to the QTc prolongation prior to discontinuation of the 
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- 01 
AMENDMENT 6  Page 58 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 study drug and/or study withdrawal.  Such contributing factors include 
nausea/vomiting, concomitant medications that may result in prolongation of the 
QTc interval either directly or through interference with the metabolism of 
COR -003, recent food ingestion (temporary QTc elevation), and electrolyte 
abnormalities (particularly serum calcium, magnesium and potassium).  
Supplementing potassium to raise serum potassium into the high -normal range 
can shorten the QTc interval in many cases.  Interfering concomitant medications with this potential are contraindicated in co -administration with the s tudy drug 
and must be stopped ( Appendix J). 
Regardless of seriousness or causality , instances of persistent QTc prolongation should be 
reported to the Sponsor’s designated Pharmacovigilance group as an AESI within 24 hours from the time the persistent prolongation has been confirmed, similar to the reporting for SAEs (see Section 13.7).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Resuming Treatment After Resolution of QTc Prolongation  
COR -003 at a lower dose can be restarted after a washout period of 2 days and resolution 
of the QTc prolongation (absolute QTc interval ≤ 500 msec or is ≤ 60 msec above 
Baseline ). After restart, ECG evaluation should occur within 1 to 2 hours of resumption 
of dosing  and be continued according to the visit schedule  for increased safety 
monitoring .   
Abnormal morphology of the ECG (especially T wave changes), if present, will be recorded in the CRF.  If the absolute QTc interval remains ≤ 500 msec, or remains 
≤[ADDRESS_497073] ent QTc prolongation deemed related to COR -003 is observed after 
reintroduction at a lower dose, COR -003 should be  permanently discontinued (see 
Withdrawal criteria in Section 5.3.1), an additional PK sample should be collected as 
close to the time of the event as possible and repeat ECG evaluation should occur until QTc interval remains ≤500 msec, or ≤60 msec below the Baseline value.  
6.2.5 Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Samples for clinical laboratory testing will be collected at the times indicated in the Time and Events Table ( Appendix A ).  A complete list of all the analytes , including an entire 
battery of LFTs, is provided in Appendix B .  In addition to biochemistry , hematology  and 
urinalysis , laboratory parameters will also include the following: serum cortisol, ACTH, 
FSH (women only) , TSH, free T4, serum free and total testosterone, IGF -1, coagulation 
parameters (prothrombin time [PT], partial thromboplastin time [PTT], INR), triglycerides, serum lipid p anel, HbA1c, CRP, and spot urine for albumin/creatinine ratio 
to determine microalbuminuria.  Screening safety laboratory tests will also include the following:  HIV, as well as antibody for hepatitis B and C. All testing will be conducted in a fasting sta te and in the morning unless stated differently in the Time and Events 
Table ( Appendix A ).   
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- [ADDRESS_497074] be measured at Month 1 of the Maintenance Phas e 
(time = 0), every 2 months during the Maintenance Phase and every 3 months during the 
Extended Evaluation Phase. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy  
Regardless of post -menopausal  status, all female participants must have a negative 
pregnancy test at screening and at study visits indicated in the Time and Events Table 
(Appendix A ).  A urine β hCG will be performed at the first S creening visit and all other 
subsequent visits.  Results of the test must be available before dosing can begin.  
Post-menopausal  females will be defined as having amenorrhea for a minimum of

for up to 2 weeks after study completion.  Acceptable methods include the following:  
• Male partner is sterile prior to female subject entry into the study, and 
this male partner is the sole partner for that subject; or  
• Implants of levonorgestr ol inserted for at least [ADDRESS_497076] successive year 
following insertion; or  
• Oral contraceptive (combined or progestogen only) administered for at least one monthly cycle prior to study medication administration; or  
• Double barrier method: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/ vault caps) plus spermicidal agent 
(foam/gel/film/cream/suppository); or  
• An intrauterine device (IUD); or  
• Estrogenic vaginal ring; or  
• Percutaneous contraceptive patches; or  
• If medical contraceptives and barrier methods are not feasible for medical or 
religious reasons, an assurance of abstinence will be deemed an acceptable 
form of contraception for as long as the subject remains abstinent. 
Fertile men must agree to use a double barrier method of contraception (condom plus 
spermicide or diaphragm plus spermicide) while participating in the study and for 
[ADDRESS_497077] 
be surgically sterile (e.g. vasectomy, tubal ligation) or the female partner must be post -
menopausal.  
Reports of pr egnancies in female subjects (or in female partners of male subjects) will be 
collected after the start of dosing and until the F ollow -Up Visit.  Female subjects found to 
be pregnant wil l be withdrawn from the study.

In the event QTc prolongation occurs (as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]), additional safety monitoring is required, including medical observation of the subject  until the QTc has 
returned to a value ≤500 msec or ≤[ADDRESS_497086], as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], will include  the potential requirement for 
additional ECGs, laboratory assessments and PK samples. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adrenal Insuf ficiency  
Subjects with suspected adrenal insufficiency should be assessed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and cortisol levels as described in Section 6.3.3.  Should adrenal insufficiency be deemed present, study drug should be temporarily discontinued for mild symptoms/signs.  For moderate or severe sy mptoms/signs, study drug will be temporarily 
discontinued and rescue glucocorticoids administered as indicated . In addition, an 
additional PK sample should be collected as close to the time of the event as possible , 
ideally within several hours of dosing . 
Study drug at an appropriately lower dose can be restarted once the medical situation is deemed sufficiently resolved  by [CONTACT_737] . Cases of suspected adrenal 
insufficiency should be reported to Cmed P harmacovigilance as AESIs  (Section 13.7) .

[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetic s Sample Collection  
Blood samples (1 mL minimum) for the determination of plasma concentrations of 
COR -003 will be collected at the times indicated in the Time and Events Table 
(Appendix A ). 
The chosen dose level for PK sampling might vary from subject to subject. It is important to collect PK samples from subjects at higher dose levels.  Samples will be collected from different subjects at different dose levels.  
Subjects  will be asked to provide the time of the last dose on the day prior to the PK 
sampling visit and to forego taking their medication on the day of the scheduled visit. All subjects will have a blood sample taken for PK immedia tely pre-dose and between 
1.[ADDRESS_497087] two  different dose 
levels.  
In addition, if persistent and confirmed QTc prolongation is observed, an additional PK sample should be collected as close to the time of the event as possible , ideally within 
several hours of dosing  (see Section  6.2.4).   Additional PK samples may also be collected 
in association with other AESIs as close to the time of the event as possible (Section  13.2.2).  
The actual PK times may vary from the nominal times; the actual dose administered, time of dose administration, and actual times of PK sample collection MUST be recorded. See 
SPM for further details.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetic s Sample Analysis 
Sample analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_303563] (Moscow, Indiana [LOCATION_003]) under the direction of Cortendo AB.  Concentrations of COR -003 (2S,4R -ketoconazole) in 
plasma will be determined using current validated methodology. See SPM for further details.

In addition, subjects will also be asked to carry an emergency kit containing hydrocortisone or another appropriate glucocorticoid, according to local medical practice, that can be administered immediately in case of adrenal insufficiency.  
6.3.2 Considerations for Investigator  
Subjects will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] ( method by [CONTACT_303565]) approximately [ADDRESS_497090] of care:  
• Diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance:  See Appendix H
 for testing 
recommendations.  
• Hypertension :  See Appendix I  for guidelines for classification of blood pressure 
levels and follow -up recommendations.  
• Hypocortisolemia:  See Appendix K  for evaluations of signs and symptoms . 
• Hypominera locorticoidism:  See Appendix K  for evaluations of signs and 
symptoms . 
• Hypogonadism :  See Appendix K  for evaluations of changes in sexual function as 
reported by [CONTACT_423].  
• Acute adrenal crisis:   Acute adrenal crisis is a life -threatening condition that 
often occurs primarily because of mineralocorticoid deficiency  (Appendix K ).  In 
such cases, the major clinical problem is hypotension (low blood pressure or 
shock).  Adrenal crisis  can result in seizures, shock, coma or death.  In patients 
treated for CS , adrenal crisis typi[INVESTIGATOR_303483].  With pi[INVESTIGATOR_299435], glucocorticoid deficiency can 
predominate.  
• Adrenal insufficiency :  See the following section  (Section 6.3.3 ) for assessment of 
signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency  and Appendix K  for evaluation of 
signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency.  
6.3.[ADDRESS_497091] be given sufficient written instructions about potential risks of adrenal 
insufficiency in subjects in this study.  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- 01 
AMENDMENT 6  Page 66 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 It is well recognized that subjects with a good response to treatment for CS resulting in 
decreased, but not low, cortisol concentrations may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency  (non-life threatening) which may not be different than those of 
acute adrenal  crisis , which is a life -threatening event  warranting immediate medical 
intervention. Discrimination between the two may not be evident. Furthermore, subjects may have adrenal insufficiency without abnormal cortisol concentrations, but the concentrations, while within or above the normal range, ar e inappropriately low for the 
degree of physiological stress being experienced by [CONTACT_423]. These symptoms include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, malaise, fatigue, headache, arthralgias/myalgias, gastrointestinal discomfort, dizziness (par ticularly upon standing), 
irritability, depression, sweating, and fever. Subjects may have hypoglycemia as well. Therefore, subjects should be assessed for signs and symptoms AND cortisol levels as follows:  
• Full review of symptoms . 
• Lying and standing blood pressure measurements and pulse to evaluate postural 
changes .  
• Laboratory evidence of hypoadrenalism is defined as morning serum cortisol level < 3 μg/dL (LLN or the lower limit of the assay being used for clinical testing). 
Even if the serum cortisol and/or the UFC are within the normal range, the possibility of adrenal insufficiency should be considered, based on postural (orthostatic) vital sign changes and clinical signs and symptoms. Please see Appendix K  for a list of clinical signs and symptoms.  
• Should adrenal insufficiency be deemed present, COR -003 should be temporarily 
discontinued for mild symptoms/signs. 
• For moderate or severe symptoms/signs, COR -003 will be temporarily 
discontinued and rescue glucocorticoids temporarily administered.  
• COR -003 at an appropriately lower dose can be restarted once the medical 
situation is deemed resolved. If the dose that ca used adrenal insufficiency is 
150 mg/day, COR -[ADDRESS_497092] 
withdrawn from the study.  
All cases of suspected adrenal insufficiency should be reported as AESIs to Cmed 
Pharmacovigilance (Section 13.7) . 
[ADDRESS_497093] follow the following lifestyle and dietary restrictions throughout the study.  
• Consumption of grapefruit, lime juice and Seville oranges and products ( i.e. sour 
orange, bigarade orange, or marmalade orange) should be avoided ; 
• Genuine licorice should be avoided;   
• Consumption of excessive alcohol should be avoided;  
 
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- [ADDRESS_497094] follow the following lifestyle and dietary restrictions for study -specific 
assessments.  
• During the 24- hour urine collection  period, subjects must refrain  from the 
following:  
o Drinking ≥4 L/day of fluids  (which equals a little less than a gallon)  
o Use of medicines or products with glucocorticoids, such as hemorrhoid or 
steroid skin creams   
• On the nights that samples are collected for salivary cortisol test , subjects must 
refrain from the following : 
o Within 2 hours of the collection:  
 Brushing or flossing teeth or doing anything that could induce bleeding of the gums   
 Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_299436] 
o Within 1 hour  of the collection : 
 Eating or drink ing or chew ing anything (including tobacco)  
 Using any creams or lotions  
 Smoking cigarettes , pi[INVESTIGATOR_5836], cigar or any other substance . 
 
Information on subject’s job related to working shift hours will be collected  by [CONTACT_89184] . 
[ADDRESS_497095]  
COR -003 (2S,4R -ketoconazole , also known as levoketoconazole ) will be provided as 
150 mg tablets.  The tabl ets will be 3/8” round, biconvex, and unmarked with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_395409] ( HDPE ) 
bottles.  Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for details of labeling of the investigational 
product. 
8.[ADDRESS_497096] develops signs and/or 
symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain), based on further investigation and clinical judgment, the Investigator may opt to stop dosing of the study medication to allow resolution of these symptoms . 
Similarly, dosage reductions following temporary drug interruption might be used to manage possibly drug -associated toxicities, including  LFT elevations ( Section 5.3.2)  or 
QTC prolongation ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]) .  In such cases, when the study medication is 
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- 01 
AMENDMENT 6  Page 68 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 restarted it should be reduced to the preceding dose level (as described in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  In the event that an observation is made at DL1  necessitating dose 
reduction, the subject may receive a lower dose of 150 mg once daily (DL0) at the discretion of the Investigator and agreement with agreement of the Medical Monitor .  
Subjects may subsequently resume the Dose Titration scheme, if appropriate at the discretion of the Investigator and agreement with the Medical Monitor . 
The [ADDRESS_497097] patients responsive to ketoconazole, doses average approximately 600 to 800 mg/day with the range of 200 to 1800 mg having been utilized to achieve normalization of cortisol levels [Nieman 2002; Pozza 2012] . 
Like ketoconazole,  COR -[ADDRESS_497098] dose of 600 mg BID COR -003 (1200 mg total daily dose) is 
indicated during this trial, because some CS subjects may require higher levels of cortisol suppression to achieve control in this severe disease .  Any titration to a dose of COR -003 
higher than 300 mg BID (600 mg total daily dose and higher) will be guided by [CONTACT_303567] 4.2.2.  It is expected that titration to this highest dose will be the exception rather than the norm, based on the experience with ketoconazole and the potentially higher in vitro potency of COR -003 to 
inhibit key enzymes controlling adrenal cortisol synthesis .  A detailed description of 
preclinical and prior clinical data with COR -003 and rationale for dose selection is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
8.4 Blinding  
This will be an open label s tudy.   However, a study -specific data restriction plan (DRP)  
has been crafted to govern the availability of efficacy data, such that the Sponsor will not be able to discern the emerging efficacy profile of the drug during study conduct, thus reducing  the p ossibility of introduced bias.  
8.[ADDRESS_497099] accountability records throughout the course of the study.  The responsible person(s) will document the amount of investigational product received from and returned to Cortendo (when applicable), the amount supplied and/or administered to and returned by [CONTACT_1766], if applicable.

medication with them to all visits  except for the additional safety visit required in the 
Titration  Phase for  DL4 through DL7 (where e mpty medication bottles and unused 
medication will not be collected and accountability will not be performed ). 
Accountability to determine compliance will be performed at all other visits.  
9.[ADDRESS_497101] Overdose  
There is no known antidote to COR -003.  Subjects should be medically managed 
according to their clinical condition, as appropriate.  Refer to Section 4.2.2 for 
administration of doses  >600 mg/day .   
[ADDRESS_497102] be used in moderation 
and taken ≥[ADDRESS_497103] the Medical Monitor for any questions. 
• Total daily dose of acetaminophen (paracetamol) >3g (increased liver toxicity 
risk);  
• Prescription or over the counter H2 receptor antagonists  or proton- pump 
inhibitors  or sucralfate (inhibit ion of drug  absorption);  
• Statins other than pravastatin, fluvastatin and rosuvastatin; potentially eligible 
subjects should be switched to an allowed statin several weeks prior to the 
Baseline Visit whenever feasible to allow equilibration of blood lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805];  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- 01 
AMENDMENT 6  Page 70 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 • Carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], fenofibrate (assay interference), carbenoxolone;  
• Genuine licorice (mineralocorticoid effects);  
• Steroidogenesis inhibitors or dopamine agonists (interference with drug effect, 
Appendix J , Table 9  and Table 10 ); 
• Megestrol  acetate or medroxyprogesterone acetate and selected other synthetic 
progestins (see Appendix J , Table 11) [ Schindler 2003] ; 
• Any other drug treatments used to lower cortisol in CS that are subject to washout (Section 5.1 and Appendix J, Table 12) are prohibited throughout the study ; 
• Weight loss medications ( either prescription or over  the counter , Appendix J , 
Table 13 ); 
• Drugs whose systemic exposure is potentially increased significantly by [CONTACT_395444] -003 ( Appendix J , Table 15);  
• Medications that are strong  CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP3A4 inducers as they may 
interfere with the metabolism of COR -003. As examples, r ifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], rifabutin, 
isoniazid, nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_395410] -003 
concentrations  via CYP3A4 induction, and ritonavir may increase COR -003 
concentrations  via CYP3A4 inhibition, and are therefore prohibited ( Appendix J , 
Table 16 ); 
• Medications resulting in QTc prolongation as a direct effect or as a result of interaction with COR -003, examples include : cisa pride, dofetilide, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], 
quinidine . (Appendix J , Table 17 ).  However, in selected cases where no 
alternative medications are available, permiss ion from the Medical Monitor may 
be sought ; 
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_299443] (inter ference with drug effect, 
Appendix J , Table 9);  
• The following herbal medicines: St John’s Wort, echinacea, gingko, goldenseal, yohimbe, red rice yeast, danshen, silybum marianum, Asian ginseng, schissandra 
sphenanther, shankhapushi, and Asian herb mixture (Xiao chai hu tang and Salboku- to); 
10.3 Medications to be Used with Caution 
• There are some medications that are often  considered contraindicated when used 
with ketoc onazole, due to an increased risk of AEs ( Appendix J , Table 20) . These 
medications should generally be avoided while the subject is participating in t he 
study. However, they may be used in selected  cases, particularly when they are 
used prior to study entry and when no alternative medications are available. Such usage should follow consultation and explicit permission from the M edical 
Monitor.  
• Medications that are weak or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP3A4 inducers 
or that are metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P450 enzymes (CYPs)  and plasma 
concentration increases moderately in the presence of ketoconazole, potentially 
resulting in increased drug effe ct, should be avoided if alternative therapy is 
available or should be used with caution; in that case, careful monitoring, with possible adjustments in doses, is recommended (see Appendix J , Table 18).  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- [ADDRESS_497104] c ompleted the study and are eligible for 
inclusion into the Extended Evaluation Phase.  
Subjects who complete the Extended Evaluation Phase (M12 Visit) and are not 
progressing into an expanded a ccess program should return approximately 2 weeks after 
completion of treatment with COR -003 for the Follow -Up Visit (see Appendix A ). 
11.[ADDRESS_497105] Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures  
Reasons for premature study withdrawal ( i.e. do not  return for all study visits) , include, 
but are not limited, to the following  (see also Section 5.3) : 
• Safety reasons, either at the discretion of the Investigator or at the subject’s 
request  
• Protocol violations at the discretion of the Sponsor  
• Permanent study medication discontinuation  
• Concomitant therapy that could interfere with the results of the study, (the 
Investigator will report all such information on the CRFs and decide, in accordance with the Sponsor, whether the subject is to be withdrawn).  
All study withdrawals and their causes must be carefully documented by [CONTACT_303572], and, if need be, on the AE form.   
If the subject chooses to withdraw  or is otherwise withdrawn before completing the 
study, the Investigator should make every attempt to have the subject return to the clinic 
to complete all safety and PK assessments as outlined for the Follow -Up Visit in 
Appendix A  (approximately 2  weeks following end of treatment with COR -003). If a 
subject is withdrawn before completing the Maintenance or Extended Evaluation Phases 
of the study, the reason for termination will be recorded.  All data gathered on the subject prior to termination will be made available to the Sponsor.   
12 DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 Population for Analysis 
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population : The ITT population will include all subjects who 
receive at least one dose of COR -003.  This population will be used for the evaluation of 
efficacy and all safety analyses.  
Maintenance (M) Population : The M population will consist of all subjects who enter 
the Maintenance Phase of the study. This population will be us ed for the supportive 
evaluation of all the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints .   
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- 01 
AMENDMENT 6  Page 72 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 Per Protocol (PP) Population : The PP population will consist of all subjects who enter 
the M aintenance P hase of the study and have no major protocol deviations that may 
affect efficacy. This population will be as supportive analysis for the analysis of the 
primary endpoint.   
12.2 Hypothesis  
The primary endpoint for this study will be the proportion of responders  to COR -003 
following 6 months of dosing in the Maintenance Phase without a dose increase during that phase.  Additionally, subjects who previously received radiation therapy and who 
exhibit no rebound increase in mean UFC following withdrawal of COR -003 
immediately after the end of the Maintenance Phase will be considered non -responders.  
The proportion of responders in the ITT population will be estimated along with corresponding two- sided 95% confidence interval (CI).  The null hypothesis to be tested 
is if the proportion of responders  at the end of the M aintenance Phase visit  is at most 20% 
versus the alternative hypothesis that the proportion of responders at  the e nd of the 
Maintenance Phase visit is greater than 20%; COR -[ADDRESS_497106] 90% power and two- sided 5% 
Type I error.  
12.3 Sample Size Determination  
A sufficient number of subjects (estimated at approximately 90) will be enrolled into the Dose Titration Phase of the st udy to ensure that at least 70 subjects complete the 6 -month 
Maintenance Phase.  The 90 subjects to be enrolled in the Dose Titration Phase will constitute the primary analysis population (i.e. the ITT population) .  Table [ADDRESS_497107] a 20% responder rate, given an alternative response of 35% for a two -sided 5% Type I error for the ITT population. 
Results will be evaluated using a two -sided 95% lower confidence bound for the response 
rate at the end of the Maintenance Phase visit.

As an example, if the observed response rate at the end of the Maintenance Phase visit is 
40% with [ADDRESS_497110] s, then the two- sided 95% CI is (30.0%, 50.9%) which would support 
efficacy.

detected for the secondary efficacy endpoints of CS co morbidit ies with 90% power for a 
two-sided 1% Type I error for [ADDRESS_497112] s (the 1% Type I error accounts for testing 
significance for these multiple secondary efficacy endpoints ).  Results will be evaluated

The SAS System, Version 9.1.3 (or higher), will be used for all analyses, unless 
otherwise specified. Continuous variables (e.g., age) will be summarized using the number of observations (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables (e.g., sex, race) will be summarized using the number of observations (n) and percentage in each category.  
All data used in analyses and/or collected during the study will be provided in listings.

SAP. 
12.[ADDRESS_497117] visit 
following c ompletion of the Extended Evaluation P hase (i.e. following at least 
12 months’ treatment at the T herapeutic D ose). Interim analyses of safety are planned to 
coincide with timing for the primary analysis of efficacy (i.e. after the final subject has completed Maintenance Phase) and for any unplanned interim efficacy analyses, in order to assess benefits and risks of treatment simultaneously. In addition, planned and unplanned safety analyses will be performed and reported on a limited basis in order t o 
satisfy requirements of study oversight, for example to Institutional Review Boards and Competent Authorities. These limited analyses (e.g. common adverse reactions summary) will not be accompanied by [CONTACT_395446].  
The DSMB will rev iew all SAEs and AESIs on a rolling basis and assess benefits and 
risk of therapy systematically at approximately 6 -month intervals. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Extent of Exposure  
Study drug exposure will be summarized as the average daily dose, cumulative dose, and total number of days on study drug.  Total number of days on study drug will be calculated for each subject as the treatment stop date minus treatment start date plus on e 
day.   
Study drug compliance between visits and cumulative study drug compliance will be calculated by [CONTACT_299511] (total number dispensed minus total number returned/lost/wasted) by [CONTACT_395447] n and multiplying the result by 100.  
The occurrence and timing of dose discontinuations as well as dose increases will be displayed in a listing.  Reasons for discontinuation and dose increases will also be reported in the lis ting. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events (AEs)  
AEs will be coded using MedDRA  and graded according to the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criter ia for Adverse Events, version 4.0 [ NCI CTCAE , 2009].  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- [ADDRESS_497118] 5% of the ITT population. The number and the percentage of subjects reporting the most common TEAEs will be summarized.  Two -sided 95% CIs will be reported for s uch TEAEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
A laboratory value that is within the normal range will be considered normal. A laboratory value that is outside the testing laboratory’s normal range will be considered an abnormal laboratory value.  The number a nd percentage of subjects with abnormal 
laboratory values will be summarized for each scheduled visit.  Shift tables will be constructed .  
Differences in laboratory values between Baseline and each scheduled laboratory assessment will be calculated for each laboratory test and summarized descriptively. The laboratory test values obtained at Baseline closest  to the start of treatment will be used as 
the Baseline value.   
Further details of the categorical analysis of the laboratory evaluation and on the LFT evaluations will be defined in detail in the SAP . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Signs  
Heart rate and three measurements of SBP and DBP will be taken at each visit. The mean of these measurements will be used as the value for each visit. Baseline will be defined as the mean of the  values fr om the measurement at B aseline just prior to the start of 
treatment .  Change from Baseline for each measurement  will be summarized.  In 
addition, values of clinical importance ( Table 5 ) will be identified in the data listings.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Electrocardiograms (ECGs)  
Summary ECGs, based on the measurement of an ECG over 5 minutes as described in 
Section 6.2.4 will be used for each evaluation.  Quantitative ECG measurements (PR interval, QRS duration, HR, QT interval, QTcB interval, and QTcF interval) and changes from Baseline will be summarized de scriptively.  ECGs results will be available to the

12.5.2  Efficacy Analyses 
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT and M  populations using longitudinal 
models.  For the primary endpoint, i mputation will be applied for subjec ts that were 
prematurely withdrawn from the study  as supportive analysis . In addition, the primary 
endpoint will also be analyzed using the PP population as supportive analysis. Withdrawn subjects prior to the E nd of the Maintenance Phase Visit assessment , as well 
as those requiring a dose increase during the Maintenance Phase, will be considered non-
responders as long as the dose increase was sustained.  Additionally, subjects who previously received radiation therapy and who exhibit no rebound increase in mean UFC following withdrawal of COR -003 immediately after the end of the Maintenance Phase 
will be considered non- responders.  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Primary Efficacy  Analysis 
Clinical Response Rate  
UFC data will be averaged for the E nd of Maintenance Phase Visit and then analyzed for 
response. The treatment estimate of the clinical response rate at the end of the Maintenance Phase and its associated two -sided 95% CI will be obtained from a repeated 
measures GEE  model with a logit link  using SAS PROC GLIMMMIX with LSMEANS  
statement .  The primary analysis will be the ITT population and analysis will be repeated 
in the M population and PP population. The longitudinal model will include visit, the concurrent CS medical conditions (diabetes , hypertension) as Baseline covariates as well 
as age (rounded median split), sex, disease duration, prior CS therapy, and prior radiation therapy , and subject will be included as a random effect .   
Dose level information for the M population and PP popula tion will be summarized.  
If the lower bound of the 95% CI for the LSMEAN proportion of responders in the ITT population is ≥20% in the ITT population, then COR -003 will be considered effective.   
Although the E nd of Maintenance Phase marks the final analysis of primary efficacy, the 
clinical response rate will also be analyzed after each month of treatment in the Maintenance Phase and (secondary endpoint) and after 9 and 12 months in the extension phase (explora tory endpoint).

 [IP_ADDRESS]   Secondary Efficacy  
UFC Analysis  
Clinical Response Rates  
UFC data will be averaged at each nominal visit and then analyzed for response in the 
same manner as for primary endpoint using the longitudinal models described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  The proportion of UFC responders to COR -003 (defined similarly to 
the primary endpoint) along with associated 95% CIs will also be individually estimated  
at Months  1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Maintenance Phase.  The longitudinal model estimates 
and the Nominal Visit estimates will both be presented.   
Complete and Partial Response Rates  The proportion of subjects with complete and partial responses ( ≥ 50% re duction in mean 
UFC  from Baseline at Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the Maintenance Phase ) will be 
calculated and reported along side with its  associated 95% CIs and will be estimated from 
a repeated measurement model with the same covariate as for the primary endpoint 
analysis .  
Change in UFC  
Mean UFC will be calculated from adequate [ADDRESS_497120]-Baseline time  point using the following UFC normality categories: less than LLN, 
normal range, g reater than ULN and less than 2X ULN, 2X  to 5X  ULN, [ADDRESS_497121]. 
CS Comorbidit y Biomarkers  
The changes from Baseline and percentage change from Baseline in individual 
biochemical markers of CS comorbidities ( fasting glucose, HbA1c, SBP , DBP , total  
cholesterol, LDL and HDL  cholesterol,  and body weight ) will be su mmarized at Months 
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- 01 
AMENDMENT 6  Page 79 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the Maintenance Phase .  In addition, shifts from Baseline (with 
regards to laboratory normal range) in individual biochemical markers of CS 
comorbidities will be analyzed using a t -test paired comparison test at each scheduled 
visit.  
Calculations for the CS comorbidity biomarkers will be performed using SAS PROC MIXED to account for all post -Dose Titration Phase outcomes per subject  with changes 
from Baseline and two- sided 99% lower confidence bounds calculated us ing LSMEANS. 
To account for endpoint multiplicity, conservative 99% CIs will be computed instead of 95% CIs.  The longitudinal model will include  visit,  the concurrent CS medical 
conditions (diabetes, hypertension) as Baseline covariates as well as age (ro unded median 
split), sex, disease duration, prior CS therapy, and prior radiation therapy , and subject as 
a random effect .   
Clinical Signs and Symptoms  
Each individual c linical sign and symptom, defined in Appendix M , will be summarized 
at each time point for assessment by [CONTACT_299506] .  
Each sign and symptom present at Baseline will be graded on a 0 to 3 severity scale 
(0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moder ate, 3=severe).  For each subject, the severities will be 
added.  A paired t -test will be used to test if there is a significant reduction in severity at 
each visit.  
In addition, shift tables in individual clinical
 signs and symptoms at each post -Dose 
Titration P hase visit  will be created to demonstrate any improvement gained during the 
course of treatment and analyzed using a McNemar paired comparison test.  
Cushing’s Syndrome Quality of Life Questionnaire   
QoL (Appendix L ) measures and changes from B aseline will be summarized by [CONTACT_395450]  a paired t -test.   
Beck’s Depression Questionnaire 
Changes from B aseline for the Beck’s Depression questionnaire ( Appendix N ) will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_299508] a paired t -test. 
Only subject s recruited under the protocol amendment or subsequent amendment will be 
included in the summary table. All data will be listed.  
Glucose Tolerance Test  
For pre -diabetic subject s as determined by [CONTACT_395451], the number and 
percent of subject s after 3 and 6 months of dosing in the Maintenance Phase will be 
summarized for each of the following categories.  
• Normal: 2 -hour glucose level is <140 mg/dL  
• Impaired glucose tolerance (pre- diabetic): glucos e level ≥140 mg/dL and 
≤200 mg/dL  
• Provisional diagnosis of diabe tes (diabetic): glucose level ≥ 200 mg/mL

ratio and its change from Baseline after [ADDRESS_497123]. 
CRP  
CRP value and its change from Baseline after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 months of dosing in the 
Maintenance Phase will be summarized.  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Exploratory Efficacy  
The analyses described above in Section [IP_ADDRESS] for clinical response rate,  complete and 
partial response rate, changes in UFC, serum and late night salivary cortisol, QoL 
(Cushing’s QoL questionnaire and Beck’s Depression Index), and change in CS comorbidities , OGTT, albumin/creatinine  and CRP will be rep eated for the Extended 
Evaluation period using the same approach as for the Maintenance Period.  
Clinical Benefit
 
The proportion of subjects achieving c linical b enefit at Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 during 
the Maintenance Phase and Months 9 and 12 in the Extended Evaluation Phase will be displayed graphically over time with c linical benefit defined as:  
1. Clinical response as indicated by [CONTACT_395424] ≤ ULN, and 
2. No increase in COR -003 dose  during Maintenance Phase , and  
3. A clinically meaningf ul improvement in any one Baseline CS co morbidity  
(diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, weight) as will be defined in the SAP and  
4. No study drug related TEAE classified as severe or worse.  
Medication Changes  
Changes to concomitant medications (in particular for blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol management) will be listed by [CONTACT_1130].  In addition, the number and percent of subjects with medication changes during the course of the study will be summarized . The 
proportions with dose increases and decreases including new and discontinued medications will be displayed.   
Clinical Signs of Hypercortisolism ( Photographs)  
At Baseline, End of Maintenance Phase Visit, and End of Extended Evaluation Phase Visit,  the adjudication committee, composed of three clinician -investigator experts in CS 
will assess the subjects for changes in visible signs of hypercortisolism ( e.g. moon face, 
plethora, supraclavicular and dorsal fat pads, striae, hirsutism, bruising and overa ll body

obvious visible improvements . Other methods of scoring photos may be included in the 
SAP.  
Relationship B etween QTc Interval and COR- [ADDRESS_497124] s with abnormal QTc, QTcB and QTcF results 
(abnormal categories are defined as > 450 msec, > 480 msec, > 500 msec, > 30 msec increase from Baseline and > 60 msec increase from Baseline) will be summarized for 
each dose level after 1, 2, 3, 4, [ADDRESS_497125]  discontinued prior to ent ering the Maintenance Phase.  
12.5.3  Pharmacokinetics  Analysis 
PK model parameters will include: CL/F,  V/F, Ka with associated between subject 
variability where feasible.  Model parameters will be tabulated with associated precision.  Derived parameters including t½ , AUC and Cmax wil l be reported, if appropriate. 
Because the PK of ketoconazole  are reported to change over time, time  dependent 
changes in CL/F , AUC , and t½ will be investigated and, if identified, changes will be 
described  in the model . Derived parameters will be tabulated with associated summary 
statistics.  
PK data will be evaluated using a population modeling -based approach as implemented 
in NONMEM
® (Version 7 level 2 or higher).  Subjects with at least one adequately 
documented dose and concentration record will be considered for inclusion in the population PK  evaluation.  All evaluations will be conducted based on a pre -specified 
analysis plan. Standard model building and model evaluation procedures will be followed.  Derived parameters will b e calculated from the final model.  
12.5.[ADDRESS_497126] variability will be reported.  Individual 
maximal UFC reduction s achieved will be tabulated and summary statistics (mean, 
median, SD  and percent coefficient of variation) will be presented.  Stochastic 
simulations of the expected response for the preferred dose regimen will be generated to explore the range of UFC reduction.  
PD data (UFC) will be evaluated using a population modeling -based approach as 
implemented in NONMEM
® (Version 7 level 2 or higher).  Subjects included in the 
population analysis with at least one adequately documented dose, PK record and UFC record will be considered for inclusion in the population PD evaluation.  All evaluations 
will be conducted based on a pre -specified analysis plan. Standard model building and 
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- [ADDRESS_497127] 30% of the ITT population. Details

[IP_ADDRESS]  Prior Therapy for Cushing’s Syndrome  
Subgroup displays for the primary endpoint and the CS comorbidities endpoint s will be 
generated for subjects that enter the study as medical treatment -naïve vs. medical 
treatment -experienced and surgery -naïve versus surgery -experienced . Subgroup analyses 
by [CONTACT_303593], time since last surgery, and category of prior medical treatment will also be explored.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prior Radiation Therapy  
Subset  displays for the primary endpoint and the CS comorbidities endpoint  will be 
generated, excluding subjects who previously received radiation therapy.  The total number of previously irradiated subjects will not exceed 10.  
Note: A drug holiday after the last Maintenance Phase visit will be used to determine if UFC normalization during the Maintenance Phase can be attributed to COR -003 or to 
prior radiation therapy (i.e. a loss of normalization during temporary drug interruption will implicate COR -003 as primarily responsible for UFC normalization) . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypertensive Subject s 
Subgroup displays for the primary endpoint and the CS comorbidities endpoint will be generated for subjects who enter the study while being  prescribed anti hypertensive 
medications versus not and subjects who enter the study with a Baseline  SBP 
>130 mmHg or DBP  >90 mmHg  regardless of antihypertensive medication status versus 
those with lower BP recordings . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pre-diabetic/Diabetic Subject s 
Subgroup displays for the primary endpoint and the CS comorbidities secondary efficacy endpoint  will be performed for subjects who enter the study as pre -diabetic ( Baseline 
fasting serum glucose >100 mg/dL but <126 mg/dL  without concomitant use of 
antihypergl ycemic medication ) versus those with normal fasting glucose or diabetic 
(Baseline fasting serum glucose > 126 mg/dL  or lower fasting glucose while being 
prescribed antihyperglycemic medications ) versus those without diabetes . Subgroups 
based on findings from stimulated glucose during the Baseline O GTT will also be 
generated.

 13 ADVERSE EVENTS (AE) AND SERI OUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
The Investigator and study staff are responsible for detecting and recording AEs and 
SAEs during scheduled safety evaluations and whenever such information is brought to their attention. This section of the protocol provides defini tions and detailed procedures 
to be followed.  
During each visit, the Investigator will question the subject about AEs  using an open 
question taking care not to influence the subject’s answers, e.g. "have you noticed any change in your health?”  
13.[ADDRESS_497128].  An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable or unintende d sign, 
including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated), 
whether or not related to the study drug  or study conduct .   
Examples of an AE include:  
• Exacerbation of a pre- existing  condition including either an increase in frequency 
and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration 
even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms of a drug interaction . 
• Signs, symptoms of a suspected overdose of either investigational product or a concurrent medication .  
• A laboratory abnormality worsening or newly occurring after the start of the study 
(i.e., after S creening) that results in subject  withdrawal from the study or medical 
treatment or further follow -up. 
NOTE : Abnormal values that reflect hypercortisolism (UFCs, salivary and serum cortisol) 
will not be recorded as AEs.  AEs may include pre - or post -treatment events that occur as 
a result of protocol -mandated procedures (i.e., invasive procedures, modification of 
subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).  
13.[ADDRESS_497129] medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
(a) results in death ; 
(b) is life -threatening ; 
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- 01 
AMENDMENT 6  Page 84 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 NOTE:  The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
(c) requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285904];  
NOTE :  In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would  not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out -
patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious.  When in doubt  as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the 
AE should be considered serious. 
(d) results in disability/incapacity ; 
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
(e) is a congenital anomaly/birth defect , or 
(f) Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_299444].  These should also be considered serious.  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bron chospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abus e. 
13.2.1  Disease-Related Events 
Although symptoms of CS are quite non- specif ic, all AEs and their attributions will be 
collected and reviewed.  The reduction in cortisol levels, regardless of therapeutic intervention, is known to cause symptoms (e.g., nausea, lethargy, muscle aches), and these too will be  captured as AEs for evaluation.  
13.2.[ADDRESS_497130] (AESI)  
A serious or non- serious event of scientific and medical concern specific to a S ponsor’s 
product or program, for which ongoing  monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_395453] S ponsor can be appropriate. Such an event might warrant further 
investigation in order to characterize and understand it. 
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- 01 
AMENDMENT 6  Page 85 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 AESIs should be reported to the designated safety group as per Section 13.7 
regardless of seriousness or causality .  Upon receipt, these AEs will be captured in the 
safety database, targeted follow -up queries will be sent to sites, and source 
documentation will be sent to the DSMB.  As deemed appropriate, analysis of any 
unscheduled PK samples collected in association with AESIs may be expedited. Once uploaded and reconciled in the clinical database, these results will be forwarded to t he 
DSMB.  
The AESIs for this study are defined as follows:  
 
Persistent QTc prolongation:  Persistent elevation of the QTc interval is defined 
as absolute QTc interval >500 msec (or >60 msec above Baseline), with an ECG evaluation on repeat determination continuing to demonstrate QTc prolongation in the absence of plausible alternative explanations . 
 
 
Potential hepatic events:  Signs of hepatic dysfunction, such as:  
• ALT or AST >8X ULN  
• ALT or AST rises to >5X ULN in <4 weeks or persists for >2 weeks  
• ALT or A ST >3X ULN and TBN  >2X ULN or INR >1.5 not explained by [CONTACT_395454], and without evidence of cholestasis  
• ALT or AST >3X ULN with  new onset of or worsening of fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, fever, rash or eosinophilia, in the absence  of other evident cause  
• Signs and /or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (any of the following: 
nausea, anorexia, fever, fatigue, right upper quadrant discomfort, pruritus, dark 
urine or acholic stool) coupled with ALT and/or AST >3X ULN and/or AP >2X ULN, and/or TBN >2X ULN in the absence of evidence for obstruction or Gilbert syndrome. An ultrasound evaluation of the gallbladder and bile duct should be conducted to exclude cholestasis as the cause for elevated AP and/or TBN.  
 
 
Adrenal insufficiency:  A suspi[INVESTIGATOR_303489], based on 
the considerations laid out in Section 6.3.3. 
13.[ADDRESS_497131] should be asked a non- leading 
question such as: "How do you feel?"  
All AEs occurring after obtaining the informed consent until the end of the final visit 
must be reported.  All AEs must be recorded irrespective of whether they are considered 
drug- related.  
At each visit/assessment in the period defined above, AEs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_303595].  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- [ADDRESS_497132] resolved, this should 
be documented.  Changes in intensity or frequency of AEs should be recorded as separate events (i.e., a new record started).  
The reco rding of AEs and SAEs are described in Section 13.4 (“Recording of AEs and 
SAEs”).  
13.4 Recording of AEs and SAEs  
All clinical events, including either observed or volunteered problems, complaints or symptoms are to be recorded on the Adverse Event s page(s) of the CRF.  The need to 
capture this information is not dependent upon whether the clinical event is associated with study treatment. Adverse clinical events resulting from concurrent illnesses or reactions to concurrent medications are also to be recorded.  In order to avoid vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions, the AE should be recorded in standard medical terminology rather than the subject’s own words.  
Each adverse clinical event is to be evaluated for duration, intensity, and whether the event may be associated with the study drug or other causes.  Start and stop dates, relationship to study drug, medical management, and alternative causality of event must be recorded in the Adverse Events section of the CRF.  AEs believed to be possibly related to study drug must be followed until resolution. 
13.5 Evaluating AEs and SAEs  
13.5.1  Severity Rating  
The severity of  AEs and SAE s will be g raded according to NCI CTCAE , Version 4.0.  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily 
living  
Grade 4  Life-threatening cons equences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5  Death related to AE  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a n SAE.  An event is 
defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -defined outcomes as described in 
Section 13.2 “Definition of a SAE”.  
13.5.2  Relationship to Study Drug  
SAEs  will be classified as “ not related ” or “ related ” (including unknown).  
For AEs , the relationship to study treatment is to be assessed according to the following 
definitions:  
Cortendo AB   Protocol COR -2012- 01 
AMENDMENT 6  Page 87 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  
 Definitely not related:  The AE is definitely not related to the drug.  This 
designation should be reserved for those events which occur prior to study 
treatment or fo r those events which cannot be even remotely related to study 
participation (e.g., injuries sustained in an automobile accident).  
Unlikely:  There is no reasonable association between the study treatment and the 
suspected event and the event could have been produced by [CONTACT_423]'s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
Possibly related:   The suspected event may or may not follow a reasonable 
temporal sequence from study treatment administration but seems to be the type 
of rea ction that cannot be dismissed as unlikely.  The event could have been 
produced or mimicked by [CONTACT_423]'s clinical state or by [CONTACT_395455].  
Probable:  The suspected event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
study treatment administration, abates upon discontinuation of the treatment, and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]'s clinical state.  
Definitely related : This designation should be reserved for those e vents which 
have no uncertainty in their relationship to treatment administration. 
13.6 Follow -Up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator  is required to proactively follow each 
subject .  Further information on SAEs will be provided to the Sponsor’s designated safety 
group on the subject’s condition within 24 hours as described in Section 13.7. 
New or updated information will also be recorded on the “SAE” CRF  within [ADDRESS_497133] 
be reported by [CONTACT_67852]’s designate d safety group  within 24 hours  
even if the SAE does not appear to be drug -related. This should be done by [CONTACT_395456] a copy of the SAE Report form plus other related informat ion to Sponsor’s 
designated safety group.  The SAE may be reported by [CONTACT_756]; however, this should 
be followed up within 24 hours with a copy of the SAE Report form.  Additionally, it may be necessary for the designated safety group to communicate with the Investigator if 
additional information is required.   
Regardless of seriousness or causality, AEs designated as AESI  (instances of persistent 
QTc prolongation, potential hepatic events, and potential adrenal insufficiency) should be reported to the Sponsor’s designated safety group within 24 hours, in the same manner as SAEs (see also Section 13.2.2).

Sec. 2. In Standards of Medi cal Care in Diabetes —2016. Diabetes Care 
2016;39(Suppl. 1):S13–S22. 
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) sta ndards for the diagnosis of pre diabetes 
consider three different categories  of pre diabetes, based on measures fasting glucose, 
HbA1c, or 2- hour postprandial glucose during a 75- gram oral glucose tolerance test 
(GTT ). For purposes of this study, however, the diagnosis of prediabetes  will be limited 
to a single  prediabetes category of imp aired fasting glucose, as follows:  
Prediabetes  is defined by a  fasting glucose of ≥ 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and 
<126 mg/dL  (7.0 mmol/L)  (after no caloric intake for at least 8 hours  and in the absence 
of antihyperglycemic medications ).   
ADA criteria for the  diagnosis of diabetes will be used as follows.  
Diabetes  Is Diagnosed by O ne of the F ollowing Criteria:  
1. A fasting glucose  of ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) after no caloric intake for at least 
8 hours

AMENDMENT 6  Page 104 of 119 CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX J  CONCOMITANT MEDICATI ONS PROHIBITED OR 
TO BE USED ONLY WITH PRIOR PERMISSION  
 
Table 9 through Table 17 provide examples of drugs that are PROHIBITED  for 
concomitant use in COR -2012- 01. Table 18 through Table 20 provide examples of drugs 
that REQUIRE PERMISSION f rom the study Medical Monitor prior to concomitant 
use.  
Drugs listed below are categorized into one drug- interaction category per drug; however, 
some drugs could have been  categorized into multiple drug -interaction categories  (e.g. 
dexamethasone is both a  systemic corticosteroid and a strong CYP3A4 inducer) . In such 
cases, the drug is categorized into the most restricted  concomitant use category as 
applicable.  
Although an attempt was made to provide a comprehensive list of relevant medications 
that are believed to present a potential risk of clinically significant drug interaction  with 
COR -003, the lists intentionally omit some medications that should not be use d 
concomitantly with COR -003, since concomitant  use is not expected  (e.g. some 
chemotherapeutic agents ), and the lists  probably omit others unintentionally. 
Furthermore, these lists will evolve as new drugs come to market and more is learned about the phar macology of COR -003 and other medications.  Therefore, they should be 
regarded as a  minimum set of excluded and precautioned concomitant medications .

Protocol Title  Long- Term Extension Trial of Setmelanotide (RM- 493) for Patients 
Who Have Completed a Trial of Setmelanotide for the Treatment of 
Obesity Associated with Genetic Defects Upstream of the MC4 Receptor in the Leptin- Melanocortin Pathway  
This extension trial applies to patients with rare genetic , syndromic, or 
acquired  diseases of obesity and obesity potentially related to other 
abnormalities in the MC4 receptor pathway.  
Clinical Phase/Trial  
Type  Open -label  active treatment extension trial (Phase 2/3) 
Treatment Indication  Treatment of obesity associated with genetic defects upstream of 
the MC4 receptor (MC4R) in the leptin -melanocortin pathway and 
with obesity related to other abnormalities in the MC4R pathway. 
Objective(s) Primary  
• To characterize safety and tolerability of setmelanotide in 
patients who have completed a previous trial on treatment 
with setmelanotide for obesity associated with genetic 
defects upstream of the MC4 R in the leptin -melanocortin 
pathway and with obesity re lated to other abnormalities in 
the MC4 R pathway. 
Trial  Design  This is a long -term (treatment for up to 7 years) extension trial 
designed to evaluate the sa fety and tolerability of continued 

Protocol  RM-493-[ADDRESS_1174573]. 
Patients who complete treatment in a previous trial (index trial) of 
setmelanotide and wish to continue with setmelanotide treatment will be considered for eligibility to enter this extension trial. Patients (or their legal guardians) will provide informed 
consent /assent  to participate  in this extension trial, and eligibility 
will be confirmed prior to completion of their index trial.  
Visit 1 of this trial will coincide with the final visit of the index 
trial; see Table  1 for details. Generally, there should be no gaps in 
treatment during the transition fro m the index trial to this extension 
trial. A gap in treatment between the index trial and extension trial 
may be allowed for individual patients, with approval by [CONTACT_103]. Patients will begin this extension trial on the same dose of setmelanotide that they were taking when they completed their 
index trial. Patients who received double-blind study drug in a placebo -controlled index trial will start open -label setmelanotide in 
this trial, with the starting dose from the index trial. The  dose 
titration sho uld follow the scheme in the index trial and in 
consultation with the sponsor. 
Patients will be evaluated approximately every 3  months at the trial 
site for adverse events (AEs) , concomitant medications,  
height (in children),  
Additional tests will be completed at longer trial  visit intervals.  
Trial  Population  Male and female patients who have completed all critical trial 
evaluations in a previous setmelanotide trial and would benefit from 
continued setmelanotide treatment.  
Number of Patients & 
Trial  Centers It is anticipated that any patient receiving active therapy from a setmelanotide clinical trial and experiencing improvements in 
weight- related parameters  could be a candidate for enrollment in 
this extension trial. Based on the number of patients currentl y 
enrolled or planned for enrolment in current or future  setmelanotide 
clinical trials , it is anticipated that up to 500 patients may be 
enrolled in this trial
; however, expansion in enrollment may occur if 
additional patients with obesity due to monogenic, syndromic or 
acquired disorders affecting the MC4 R pathway are enrolled in 
Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials  evaluating setmelanotide. It is 
anticipated that up to 100  centers located worldwide will participate 
in this trial. In the event additional patients are to be enrolled, additional sites may be added, as necessary.

Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 21 Confidential  1. INTRODUCTION  
Rhythm (the sponsor) is focusing the development of setmelanotide as a treatment for patients 
with rare genetic , syndromic , or acquired  diseases of obesity due to specific genetic defects that 
impact the functioning of the melanocortin -4 receptor (MC4R) pathway, a highly conserved 
hypothalamic pathway critical for regulation of appetite, energy expenditure, and body weight. 
The MC4R pathway is the key pathway regulating body weight and appetite. Genetic or acquired 
defects i n the MC4R pathway and other abnormalities of the MC4R pathway cause hyperphagia, 
an insatiable hunger, leading to severe and early-onset obesity. 
The focus of setmelanotide development is on hyperphagia and obesity arising from lack of 
activation of MC4Rs and lack of “downstream signaling” due to genetic variants  or other 
impairments  “upstream” of the MC4R. By [CONTACT_525642]4R with setmelanotide (a MC4R 
agonist), signaling occurs in the “ downstream ” portion of the pathway, and thereby 
[CONTACT_845108].  Human genetics studies have identified several diseases that are the result of genetic defects 
affecting the MC4R pathway, for example, syndromes or variants of the following genes: 
• Pro-opi[INVESTIGATOR_356092] (POMC) 
• Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 1 (PCSK1)  
• Leptin receptor (LEPR)/leptin hormone  (LEP)  
• Bardet -Biedl syndrome (BBS) 
• Alström syndrome (AS)  
• Smith -Magenis syndrome (SMS)  
• SH2B Adaptor Protein 1 (SH2B1), including 16p11.2 deletion  
• Nuclear receptor coactivator -1 (NCOA1), also referred to as steroid receptor 
coactivator 1 (SRC1)  
• MC4R  
Central melanocortin signaling is the central element of energy homeostasis ( Holland 2019
). 
Somewhat similar to patients with genetic variants in the MC4R pathway, in  patients with 
hypothalamic lesions, leptin signaling is often disturbed and as a result melanocortin signaling is 
reduced ( Enriori 2016; Roth 1998; Roth 2010; Patel 2002 ; Shaikh 2008 ). Imaging studies in 
humans and rodent models show that lesions of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus 
(VMN) and the region of the arcuate nucleus (ARC), are more often associated with hyperphagia 
and excessive weight gain ( Ahmet 2006; DeVile  1996; Roth 2011; Daousi 2005; Holmer 2010 ; 
Elfers 2011 ). 
Hypothalamic obesity (HO) is a form of severe obesity that arises from mechanical hypothalamic 
lesions/ insults (e .g., tumors, tumor resections, radiotherapy treatment). Lesions of the 
hypothalamus can derive from various types of tumors (craniopharyngiomas, gliomas, pi[INVESTIGATOR_845088], hamartomas) as well as from the surgeries and radiotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_845089]. Patients with HO display a higher degree of hyperlep tinemia and hyperinsulinemia 
Protocol  RM-493-022 V8. 1 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 22 Confidential  when compared to individuals with normal body mass indexes ( BMIs ). Alpha- melanocortin 
stimulating hormone ( α-MSH) can be detectable in blood, and its levels can change depending 
on different energy states (Enriori 2016 ); however, in patients with craniopharyngioma or post-
surgical treatment for it, α -MSH levels are significantly reduced  (Roth 2010; Roth 2011 ). 
Reduced serum α-MSH levels suggest melanocortin pathway deficiency, which might explain 
lower energy expenditure in peripheral tissues due to reduced fat and muscle fatty acid oxidation 
(Roth 2010;  Roth 2011; An 2007 ).  
In a rat model of “combined medial hypothalamic lesion” ( CMHL rat model ) for HO 
(Roth  2011 ), Roth et al found that the characteristic metabolic changes of human HO were 
recapi[INVESTIGATOR_845090]. In this rat model, α- MSH levels are reduced 
(Roth 2011) , similar to patients with craniopharyngioma (Roth 2010 ).  
Additionally, an MC3/[ADDRESS_1174586], me lanotan II (MTII) 1 mg/kg/d ay administered 
intraperitoneally over a period of [ADDRESS_1174587] reduction of weight gain in CMHL rats without rebound/tachyphylaxia (Roth 2012
). Preclinical and clinical findings offer a 
rationale for a novel melanocortin treatment also in patients with HO to compensate for and 
potentiate defective leptin signaling.  
Overall, nonclinical and clinical data demonstrate that setmelanotide restores normal hunger, 
satiety, and energy expenditure regulation, leading to profound reduction of excess weight, in 
essence as a form of “replacement therapy”. Setmelanotide is authorized for marketing in the 
[LOCATION_002] (US), Great Britain (GB), Israel, the European Union (EU) ,and Canada in adult 
and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older  with obesity due to POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR 
(PPL) deficiency (USPI 202 2; EU SmPC 202 2; MHRA SmPC 2021 ; Israel PPI 2022 ; Product  
Monograph 2023). Additionally, setmelanotide is also approved in the US, EU , and Canada to 
treat chronic weight management in adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age or older with monogenic or syndromic obesity due to BBS (USPI 2022, SmPC 2022, Product Monograph 2023).  The clinical testing and regulatory approval of setmelanotide  in certain countries have 
established its therapeutic value. This trial will continue to  explore the long- term safety and 
tolerability of setmelanotide in patients who have successfully completed a prior index trial of 
setmelanotide . Trial participation may continue for up to [ADDRESS_1174588] visit of 
a prior index trial or an index trial extension phase and the initial visit of this long- term extension 
trial occur on the same day, if possible.  
An index trial  is defined as  any setmelanotide trial in which a patient participated prior to 
enrollment in this extension trial.  
1.1. Setmelanotide Background and Clinical Experience 
Setmelanotide is an 8 -amino acid, cyclic peptide that binds with high affinity (inhibitory constant 
[Ki] = 2.1 nM) to the human M C4R and is efficient in activating MC4R (50% effective 
concentration [EC 50] = 0.27 nM). 
Protocol  RM-493-022 V8. 1 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 23 Confidential  1.1.1. Clinical Background and Benefit –Risk Assessment  
Nonclinical and clinical data generated to date with setmelanotide described in the Investigator  
Brochure ( IB) provide meaningful information to support the benefit–risk  assessment for the 
proposed use of setmelanotide in the current trial , a long- term extension trial for clinical 
evaluation of long- term treatment of obesity associated with genetic defects in the leptin -
melanocortin pathway upstream of the MC4R and other abnormalities of the MC4R pathway.  
The current clinical development program for setmelanotide is focused on rare monogenic forms 
of early -onset, severe obesity, including POMC deficiency obesity, LEPR deficiency obesity, 
and other genetic forms of early -onset, severe obesity with involvement of the leptin -MC4R 
pathway in their pathogenesis, including epi[INVESTIGATOR_845091], PPL  heterozygous obesity, and 
potentially other genetic and/or syndromic forms of obesity, and other abnormalities of the MC4R pathway, such as HO.   
Informative clinical data from the initial phases of these trials  in patients with early -onset severe 
obesity due to rare bi-allelic mutations in the POMC  and LEPR genes, as well as BBS , are 
available and were published or presented at scientific meetings. The evolving profile of weight-
related  and hunger symptom reduction demonstrated with chronic setmelanotide treatment is 
important to consider, as these findings inform the overall bene fit–risk consideration of 
setmelanotide.  
In adult patients who tolerate the [ADDRESS_1174589] on  
 is desired in the current trial, a higher QD dose can be administered at the investigator ’s 
discretion and in consultation with the sponsor. The dose can be increased up to 4 mg QD, in patients with an absolute weight of >50 kg, and up to 5 mg QD in adult patients with an absolute 
weight of >[ADDRESS_1174590] been investigated previously in trial RM- 493-026. 
Adult patients exposed to these higher dose levels should be monitored closely via additional 
unscheduled visits or telephone calls to assess safety and tolerability. For patients who escalate 
to 4 or 5 mg QD, the dose level should be reduced to 3 mg and 4 mg if their absolute weight decrea ses to ≤50 kg and ≤60 kg, respectively. The maximum dose of setmelanotide is limited by 
[CONTACT_845109] (kg) in order to maintain exp osure to excipi[INVESTIGATOR_845092] a lower level than those currently approved for other commercially available 
medicinal products (see Section  3.2 for further details).   
Overall, the expected benefit –risk assessment supports continued evaluation of setmelanotide in 
these rare patient populations with high unmet medical needs.  
Refer to the Investigator Brochure for data regarding setmelanotide administration at doses up to 
5 mg. 
2. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
2.1. Trial  Objectives  
2.1.1. Primary  Objective  
• To characterize safety and tolerability of setmelanotide in patients who have 
completed a previous trial on treatment with  setmelanotide for obesity associated with 

Protocol  RM-493-[ADDRESS_1174591] visit of a prior index trial or an index trial  extension phase and the initial 
visit of this lo ng-term extension trial to occur on the same day, if possible .  
Patients will be assessed in the clinic approximately every 3  months for vital signs, AEs , 
concomitant medications,  height (in children),  
Safety laboratory samples will be collected at each visit  and additional assessments will be done 
on a yearly basis. In general assessments will be less frequent and burdensome than was required 
in their index protocol.   
Unscheduled clinic and/ or telephone visits may be added at the discretion of the investigator to 
follow any changes in dose or adverse event, as required. 
3.2. Justification of the Trial  Design 
Setmelanotide may be administered chronically ; therefore , it is important to evaluate its long-
term safety and efficacy . 
Assessments of vital signs, AEs, , height (in children),   
 conducted approximately every [ADDRESS_1174592] is desired on  a dose increase is justified; setmelanotide doses >5 mg are not 
permitted . Patients who participated in  a placebo -controlled index trial will start open -label 
setmelanotide in this trial with the starting dose from the index trial, based on the patient’s age 
and weight. D ose titration should follow the scheme in the index trial and in consultation with 
the sponsor. 
3.2.1. Rationale for Setmelanotide Administration at Doses Up to 5 mg  
While the target dose of setmelanotide is 3 mg QD, nonclinical and clinical data support dose 
escalation up to 5  mg QD in adult patients in this trial. For additional information, see 
Section  5.2.1 and the IB.  

Protocol  RM-493-022 V8. 1 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 28 Confidential  At the conclusion of the other setmelanotide trial, the patient may transition back into this  
extension trial , again with the patient’s written informed consent, at the discretion of the 
investigator and sponsor , if continuation of setmelanotide treatment is considered beneficial and 
the patient continues to be eligible for the extension trial. In such cases, the patient will resume 
the extension trial at the time point/visit at which he or she was at prior to transition  to the other 
trial. Furthermore, after transition back into this extension trial , the patient is to receive 
setmelanotide at the same dose as they had received prior to transition to the other trial, unless 
the dose needs to be reduced due to tolerability reasons or in case a dose increased is required for 
potential additional efficacy needs, at the investigator ’s discretion . If at the time the patient 
completes the other setmelanotide trial, setmela notide becomes commercially available for an 
indication for which th at patient qualifies, the patient will not be eligible to re -enter this 
extension trial . 
If a patient transitions to another setmelanotide clinical trial before completing the ET visit in 
this extension trial, but does not transition back into this  extension trial, the  patient will not 
complete the ET visit or follow -up in the extension trial. 
If feasible, patients are to have no interruption in setmelanotide treatment between this  extension 
trial and the other setmelanotide trial. If an interruption in treatment is necessary due to 
administrative reasons, every effort is to be made to minimize the duration of the interruption 
and interruptions >21 days are not permissible without prior appr oval from the sponsor.  
If a patient in this extension  trial elects to transition to another setmelanotide clinical trial, then 
any screening assessments performed as part of the Screening visit in the other setmelanotide 
clinical trial within 30 days of the Transition Visit in this extension trial need not be repeated.  
4. TRIAL POPULATION  
4.1. Number of Patients 
It is anticipated that any patient participating in a setmelanotide clinical trial could be a candidate 
for enrollment in this extension trial. Based on the number of patients currently enrolled or 
planned for enrolment in  setmelanotide clinical trials , it is anticipated that up to 500 patients may 
be enrolled in this trial ; however, expansion in enrollment may occur if additional patients with 
obesity due to monogenic, syndromic or acquired disorders affecting the MC4 R pathway are 
enrolled in Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials  evaluating setmelanotide. It is anticipated that up to 
100 centers located worldwide will participate in this trial. In the event additional patients are to 
be enrolled, additional sites may be added, as necessary. 
4.2. Patient Selection Criteria  
The specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrolling patients in this trial are presented in the 
section below. As these patients are ultra -rare, any criteria not fulfilled will be reviewed with the 
sponsor. Assuming no severe health concerns, a joint determination will be made regarding the acceptability of enrolling patients not fulfilling all criteria on a case -by-case basis. Any  
exceptions to the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be documented in writing and approved by 
[CONTACT_845110].

Z-score of 0. 2 compared to baseline.  
• Patients over 18  years of age should show reduction of 3% BMI  compared to 
baseline.  
If the patient  participated in a double-blind basis in the previous placebo-controlled 
clinical trial, patient  tolerated  blinded study drug. 
3. Patient  and/or parent or guardian is able to communicate well with the investigator, to 
understand and comply with the requirements of the trial, and to understand and sign the written informed consent/assent . The patient must consent/assent  to participate in the  
trial. 
4. Patient must meet one of the following requirements  regarding contraception: 
• If a f emale of childbearing potential, defined as fertile, following menarche and until 
becoming post- menopausal unless permanently sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpin gectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy), must use a highly effective form of 
contraception as outlined in Section  6.2.1. 
• If a female of non -childbearing potential, defined as permanently sterile (status post 
hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]) or post-menopausal for at least 12  months (and confirmed with a screening follicle -
stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the post -menopausal laboratory range), 
contraception is not required during the trial.  
− Younger female patients who have not reached menarche upon trial entry will be 
assessed for Tanner staging and at first menarche will be required to comp ly with 
contraception requirements and pregnancy testing as outlined in the protocol. 
• If a male with female partner(s) of childbearing potential, must agree to a double 
barrier method if they become sexually active during the trial. Furthermore, male

the trial. 
Protocol  RM-493-022 V8. 1 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 30 Confidential  4.2.2. Exclusion Criteria  
1. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding women. 
2. Significant dermatologic findings relating to melanoma or pre -melanoma skin lesions 
(excluding non-invasive basal or squamous cell lesion ), determined as part of a screening 
comprehensive skin evaluation performed by a qualified dermatologist. Any concerning 
lesions identified during the screening period will be biopsied and results known to be 
benign prior to enrollment. If the pre -treatment biopsy results are of concern, the patient 
may need to be excluded from the trial .  
3. Patient is, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] , not suitable to participate in the trial.  
4. Current, clinically significant disease, if severe enough to interfere with the trial and/or 
would confound the results. Any such patients should be discussed with the sponsor prior 
to enrollment in the trial.  
5. Diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, personality disorder or other Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM -III) disorders that the investigator believes 
will interfere significantly with trial compliance.  
6. A Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ -9) score of ≥15. 
7. Any suicidal ideation of type [ADDRESS_1174594] visit in the index trial. 
Note : Patients who are unable to complete the C -SSRS due to significant neurocognitive 
defects may be enrolled in the trial, as long as in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_845093].  
8. History of significant liver disease or liver injury, or a current liver assessment due to abnormal liver tests (as indicated by [CONTACT_611969], alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, or serum bilirubin >1.5× the 
upper limit of normal [ULN] for any of these tests) for an etiology other than non -
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) . Thus, any underlying etiology besides NAFLD, 
including diagnosed non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), other causes of hepatitis, or 
history of hepatic cirrhosis is exclusionary, but the presence of NAFLD is not 
exclusionary. 
9. Severe renal dysfunction defined by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR)

<15 mL  min/1.73 m2 (see Appendix 11.4 for GFR calculation).  
10. History or close family history (parents or siblings) of skin cancer or melanoma  (not 
including non- invasive/infiltrative basal or squamous cell lesion), or patient history of 
ocular- cutaneous albinism.  
4.3. Patient Identification and Registration  
Patients who complete  treatment in  a previous trial of setmelanoti de (i.e., index trial) and wish to 
continue with setmelanotide treatment will be considered for eligibility to enter this extension  
trial. Patients who are candidates for enrollment into the trial will be evaluated for eligibility by 
[CONTACT_845111]-493-[ADDRESS_1174595] 2 -digits of the current protocol number (RM -493-022), the last 2 -digits of 
the index protocol number (RM -493- XXX) , the 2-digit site number , and a sequential 3 -digit 
patient  number, which will be used to identify patients throughout their participation in the trial. 
Patient numbers will be assigned sequentially starting at 001 (i.e., the first patient enrolled from 
index Protocol RM -493-012 at Site 10 would be assigned N umber  22-12-10-001). Once a patient 
number has been assigned, it cannot be reused. 
Note that patient numbers may be modified to identify those patients who transition from this 
extension trial  into another setmelanotide clinical trial and, as applicable, transition back into the 
extension trial . However, the patient number will enable tracking the patient across both clinical 
trials . 
4.4. Withdrawal of Patients  
Patients will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the  trial at any time for any 
reason, without prejudice to their medical care. Patients withdrawn from the trial should discontinue trial treatment and complete the ET visit assessments as per the SOA  (Table  1). 
Per Section 3.3, the sponsor has elected  to terminate the investigation of the MC4R gene cohort ; 
therefore, patients with MC4R gene variants should be withdrawn from the trial. Exceptions will 
be made to allow patients that have displayed reductions from baseline of their index trial in  
 These patients can continue to receive setmelanotide treatment and participate in trial 
assessments provided they continue to demonstrate this threshold of clinical response at every visit thereafter.  
To be eligible for continued treatment  after one year on setmelanotide, all other patients have to  
display evidence of  meaningful clinical benefit via   treatment effect or other 
assessments. The length of setmelanotide treatment will be calculated by [CONTACT_845112].  
The below c riteria for withdrawal of setmelanotide treatment apply to all patients, with the 
exception of those identified as having meaningful clinical benefit–risk ratio at the investigator ’s 
discretion:  

Protocol  RM-493-[ADDRESS_1174596]
awal Criteria : 
• AEs, which justify treatment or trial  withdrawal. For specific predefined events, 
additional monitoring and guidance for the investigator is provided in  Section  7.5 
and Appendices  11.2 and  11.3. 
• Non-adherence to study drug regimen or protocol requirements. 
• Non-compliance with instructions or failure to return for follow -up. 
• IMCIVREE  is available through authorized use for the patient’s indication . 
• The patient becomes pregnant during the trial. 
The sponsor may choose to discontinue investigation of a particular indication or genetic 
cohort/variants at any time; therefore, continued participation of patients for that indication or 
gene tic cohort/variants will be addressed at that time.  
If a patient is withdrawn or discontinued from the trial, the primary reason for withdrawal or 
discontinuation from the trial is to be recorded in the source documents/case report form (CRF).  
All patients withdrawn prior to completing the treatment period should be strongly encouraged to 
complete the ET  visit as outlined  in the Schedule of Assessments (SOA) (Table  1 in Section  6), 
even if they are no longer receiving study drug. (Refer to Section  3.4 for information regarding 
completion of the Termination Visit for patients who transition into another setmelanotide 
clinical trial.)  
In case of discontinuation, a ll AEs should be followed as described in Section  7.4; any skin AEs 
should continue to be followed, if at all feasible, for up to ~90  days to confirm near, or complete 
resolution (as has been shown in previous trials).   
The sponsor will provide support for patient and caregiver travel, will make available visiting 
home health care professionals, and other necessary logistical support to ease the burden on the patient and to facilitate compliance with the trial procedures .  

Protocol  RM-493-022 V8. 1 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 33 Confidential  4.5. Patients’ Re-entry from Other Trials  
Patients that have left the current trial to enter other setmelanotide trials  might re -enter the 
current trial upon discussion with the sponsor. 
If a patient decides to withdraw consent from another setmelanotide trial, they might not be able 
to re-enter the current trial  unless the reason for ET was due to a tolerability issue with a 
different setmelanotide formulation . All the other circumsta nces will be discussed  with the 
sponsor on a case-by- case basis and supporting documentation justifying re -entry should be 
provided by [CONTACT_093]. 
5. TRIAL TREATMENTS  
5.1. Study Drugs  
All study drugs are for investigational use only and are to be used only within the context of this 
protocol. Setmelanotide  will be supplied by [CONTACT_456]. 
 
  
Setmelanotide is a clear, colorless to slightly opalescent solution essentially free of visible 
particulates . Setmelanotide will be administered as a subcutaneous ( SC) injection once daily.  
All unopened stu dy drug must be kept in a secure, limited -access storage area at a temperature 
between 2°C to 8°C. S etmelanotide  is stable at room temperature for a short time period that will 
allow patients to transport study drug home ; ice packs and cooler bags will be provided for 
patient s and caregiver s who will travel long distances from the clinic . Patients will be 
encouraged to proceed directly home after clinic visits in which study drug is dispensed in order to minimize the amount of time the study drug is exposed  to potentially elevated temperatures. 
Once at home, the unopened study drug must be stored in the patient’s refrigerator. Opened 
study drug may be stored at room temperature for up to 30 days.  
A separate pharmacy manual with specific instructions for the management of study drug will be 
provided to the investigative site. 
5.2. Study Drug Dose and Administration and Dose Adjustments  
Study Drug Dose at Trial Entry:  Patients who received setmelanotide on an open- label basis in 
the index trial will begin this extension trial on the same dose of setmelanotide they were taking 
when they completed their index trial, unless tolerability or safety reasons justify a dose 
decrease. Patients who received double-blind study  drug in a placebo- controlled index trial will 
start open- label setmelanotide in this trial with the starting  dose from the index trial. The dose 
titration should follow the scheme in the index trial and in consultation with the sponsor. 
Study Drug Administration : Trial  patients will receive open- label setmelanotide  by [CONTACT_845113] (administered in the morning). Patients and/or their caregivers  (including home health 
practitioners) will be responsible for all procedures associated with study drug administratio n at 
all times, i.e., drawing up, and self-administering the study drug once daily. Patients should be 

Protocol  RM-493-[ADDRESS_1174597] patient's  last visit.  
Patients may be offered the opportunity to participate in other setmelanotide clinical trials  (see 
Section  3.4).  
5.4.1. Commercial Availability of Setmelanotide  
Patient participation in this long -term extension trial will conclude once setmelanotide receives 
marketing authorization indicated for the patient’s condition and  is available for commercial use 
in the region. The sponsor will notify a clinical site once commercial product is available for any 
applicable patient.  
Once this occurs and the patient has access to authorized setmelanotide, the patient will complete 
an ET visit in person as soon as possible. This will be considered the final trial visit for this 
patient . The  assessments outlined in the SOA for the ET visit should be performed  and the 
patient will return all remaining study drug to the site . A follow -up telephone call may be 
conducted to follow-up on any new or ongoing AEs from this final visit. This telephone call will mark the end of participation in the trial for this patient.  
In the event that a patient has opted to  access commercial setmelanotide  treatment and is due for 
another t rial visit prior to assuring commercial drug access, then the patient should be discussed 
with the sponsor. With sponsor approval, the next planned trial visit may occur as per the SOA to 
minimize gaps in treatment if needed . 
5.5. Assessment of Treatment Compli ance  
In order to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the study drug, it is critical that 
patients receive study drug as directed . All used study drug vials  will be collected to assess 
compliance with the protocol. 
Patients and/or care giver s will record any missed doses in the trial diary .  

Protocol  RM-493-022 V8. 1 
Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 36 Confidential  If a patient does not receive the entire dose of study drug, the amount administered will be 
recorded  in the study diary. In addition, the reason(s) for the altered dose is to be recorded in 
source documents and the CRF.  
5.6. Study Drug Accountability  
The investigator is responsible for study drug accountability, reconciliation, and record 
maintenance (i.e., receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records) at the trial site . The 
investigator will ensure that the study drug is used only in accordance with this protocol. Where allowed, the investigator may choose to assign drug accountability responsibilities to a 
pharmacist or other appropriate individual  at the trial site . Drug accountability records indicating 
the delivery date to the site, inventory at the site, use by [CONTACT_6904], return of all used study 
drug to the trial site , and return to the sponsor (or disposal of the drug, if approved by [CONTACT_103]) will be maintained by [CONTACT_845114]. These records will adequately document that the 
patients were provided the doses as specified in the protocol and should reconcile all study drug 
received at the trial site from the sponsor. Reasons for departure from the expected dispensing 
regimen must also be recorded . Accountability records will include dates, quantities, batch/serial 
numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659] (if applicable), and patient numbers. The sponsor or its designee will 
review drug accountability records at the trial site during monitoring visits.  
All unused and used study drug will be returned by [CONTACT_845115]. All used, unused or expi[INVESTIGATOR_845094], disposed of at the trial site and documented.  
5.7. Prior and Concomitant Treatment 
5.7.1. Prohibited Medication and Substances  
Unless concomitant medications are likely to present a strong potential safety concern, the general goal of this protocol is to allow as many as possib le patients with these ultra -rare 
conditions to participate in the trial without prohibition of concomitant medications. 
Patients who enter this trial from an index trial may continue all current medications as 
prescribed.  
All concomitant medications should be kept at a stable dose throughout the course of the trial, unless a dose change is necessary to treat an AE. If any new medication for  weight loss  or a 
 agonist is started  prior to or during the extension trial, the 
sponsor should be informed . 
5.7.2. Concomitant Procedures  
Concomitant procedures conducted during the trial , including those used to treat AE s, are to be 
reported on the CRF.

6.1. Overview of Schedule of Assessments 
The SOA to be conducted is depi[INVESTIGATOR_419450]  1.  
Any patient withdrawing from the trial will complete the ET visit, if possible .  
Discussion of this trial with the patient should occur prior to completion of their index trial and 
attempts should be made to minimize  gaps/discontinuation of setmelanotide during transition 
from their index trial to this extension trial. Visit [ADDRESS_1174598] visit of the index trial will be used as V1 data in this 
trial as applicable. Patients will begin this extension trial on the same dose of setmelanotide that 
they were taking when they completed their index trial.  
In order to provide flexibility  to the patient and trial staff for the number of clinic visits, the 
actual scheduling of clinic visits can allow flexibility in timing of visits .  
The actual scheduling and timing of clinic visits is flexible to accommodate the patient and trial 
staff. The SOA depi[INVESTIGATOR_845095], multiple visits are to be scheduled within a range of weeks.  
The investigator s will adhere to the site -specific blood volume limits for safety laboratory and 
 analyses to ensure minimal distress to the pediatric patients 
(Appendix 11.5) . Due to the age of the children, it may not be possible to collect blood samples 
for all laboratory tests at every trial visit. After enrollment, if blood sample collection for all 
laboratory tests is not possible, then the samples should be collected in the following descending 
order of priority:  
1. safety  laboratory  tests,  
2. anti-setmelanotide antibodies (ADA),  
3.  
4. glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), 
5. , 
6. 
 
7. laboratory assessments indicative of nutritional status (e.g., albumin). 
If it is not possible to collect the safety lab oratory samples on 2 consecutive vis its, the patient 
should be discussed with the sponsor. Refer to the Laboratory  Manual for the volumes of blood 
to be collected .

pediatric patients through sexual maturation to adulthood, or until bone epi[INVESTIGATOR_845096], as per routine pediatric 
evaluation for growth and bone development in patients with underlying endocr ine disorders.  
 
 
21 Any patient with a positive ADA will be followed ~every 3 months after detection until titers resolve or return to baseline.  Note that in pediatric patients, 
samples for ADA as well as  should be collected as feasible/permissible by [CONTACT_427].  
22 Adverse events will be recorded from the time a patient provides informed consent /assent . AEs occurring after dosing on Day 1 will be considered treatment -
emergent AEs in the current trial. 
23 For pediatric (age 2 -11 years ) patients only, Nutritional Counseling and Monitoring may be performed by [CONTACT_845116] (or 
equivalent) , at the investigator ’s discretion,  to ensure that pediatric patients have adequate nutritional/dietary intake to maintain proper growth and 
development. Additional laboratory assessments indicative of nutritional status may be monitored, as appropriate (e.g., albumin).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
26  In the event that  a patient is completing this trial but continuing treatment with setmelanotide, then this follow -up visit may be converted to a telephone call . 
In that case, the site should document any new AEs and follow -up on any ongoing AEs; remaining study drug  should be returned to site, no other act ivities 
are required (see Section  5.4.1 ).  
27 Investigators may be asked by [CONTACT_845117] a chart review and a detailed analysis and collection of the clinical history of certain patient population s

 6.2. Patient Requirements  
6.2.1. Contraception and Pregnancy Testing  
In animal reproduction trials , setmelanotide was not teratogenic at doses >[ADDRESS_1174599] result at each visit .  
Furthermore, i t is imperative that all trial patient s adhere to the contraception requirements as 
outlined below.  
Wome n of childbearing potential (WOCBP), defined as fertile, following menarche and until 
becoming post- menopausal unless permanently sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], or 
bilateral oophorectomy),  must use a highly effective form of contraception throughout the trial 
and for 90 days following the trial. Highly effective forms of contraception include:  
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal)  
• Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
(oral, injectable, implantable)  
• Intrauterine device (IUD) 
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner (provided that the vasectomized partner is the sole sexual partner of the  WOCBP, and the vasectomized partner has received medical 
assessment of surgical success)  
• Sexual abstinence, only if it is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient 
Women not of c hildbearing potential , defined as permanently sterile (status post hysterectomy, 
bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]) or post -menopausal for at least 12  months 
(and confirmed with a screening FSH level in the post- menopausal range) do not require 
contraception during the trial.  
Younger female patients who are not sexually mature at trial entry will be assessed for Tanner 
staging and required to comply with contraception and pregnancy testing requirements at first menarche.  
Male pa tients  with female partner (s) of childbearing potential must agree to use contraception 
(e.g., if they have not had a vasectomy then should either (a) abstain from reproductive sexual 
intercourse or (b) use a single barrier method in combination with a female partner using a highly 
reliable method (i.e., hormonal or IUD ) if they become sexually active during the trial and for 
[ADDRESS_1174600] not donate sperm for 90 days following their 
participation in the trial.  
Protocol  RM-493-022 V8. 1 
 44 Confidential  If a pregnancy should occur while a male or female patient is on study drug, the pregnancy will 
be followed up on to determine birth and neonatal outcomes.  
6.2.2. Protection from Sun 
Skin hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], or tanning, was observed in the cynomolgus monkey toxicology trials , 
and the human trials . These events were reversible upon cessation of study drug . However, it is 
still uncertain if exposure to sunlight might exacerbate the tanning effects of setmelanotide. 
Therefore, patients are advised to use sunscreen and/or to wear protective clothing to avoid 
excessive exposure of their skin to sunlight and to avoid sun-tanning. 
It is also important that patients do not participate in any activities that will intentionally cause 
their skin to tan (e.g., visit ultraviolet [UV] tanning salons, use spray tanners, self-tanning 
lotions, etc.).

A review of concomitant medications will be conducted at V1  and at every trial visit . Any 
medications taken by [CONTACT_845120].  
6.4.9. Vital Signs  
Vital signs include BP  (mmHg), HR (bpm) , respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]  (RR, in breaths/minute) and body 
temperature  (°C). All vital  signs will be obtained in the sitting position following at least 
[ADDRESS_1174602] each time they are measured  according to the  SOA (Table  1). Vital signs should 
be obtained prior to blood draws whenever possible. All measurements , except body 
temperature,  will be taken in triplicate, approximately 2 minutes apart.  
BP and HR will be performed using the same methodology throughout the trial (manual or 
automated ) and should be taken in the non-dominant arm throughout the trial. Special attention 
should be pa id to ensure the appropriate cuff size is used in this patient population.  
Repeat measures and more frequent monitoring can be implemented for significant increases in BP or HR.  
To allow for a BP reading  at the time of  sampling , the patient should be instructed not 
to take the study drug on trial days when vit al signs are to be measured  in the clinic . 
6.4.10. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
Single 12- lead ECGs will be performed following a period of at least [ADDRESS_1174603] in the

maintain proper growth and development. Ad ditional laboratory assessments indicative of 
nutritional status may be monitored as appropriate (e.g., albumin).  
6.4.19. Adverse Events  
Each patient must be carefully monitored for the development of any AE s throughout the trial 
from V1 through the patient’s last visit. This information should be obtained in the form of non-
leading questions (e.g., “How are you feeling?”), and from signs and symptoms detected during 
each examination, from laboratory evaluation, observations of trial personnel, and spontaneous 
reports from patients.  
All AEs, including injection site reactions and potential systemic reactions will be graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
grading system.  
Complete details on AE monitoring are provided in Section  7. 
6.4.20. Order of Assessments  
When scheduled at the same timepoint , the order of procedures should be as follows: obtain vital 
signs, perform 12-lead ECG, followed by [CONTACT_82726] (at the specified time point , if applicable). 
Adjustments may be made depending upon specific circumstances.  Questionnaires are to be 
completed before the morning meal and study drug administration ; they may be performed 
before or after blood draws and/or 12- lead ECGs.  
7. ADVERSE EVENTS 
Monitoring of adverse events ( AEs) will be conducted throughout the trial. AEs will be recorded 
in the CRFs from V1 through the patient’s last v isit, as indicated in Table  1. AE s that occur after 
the start of study drug administration will be considered treatment -emergent adverse events. Any 
AEs that  are reported as ongoing at the time of the subject’s  final visit in their index trial , will be 
recorded as pre- existing condition on the trial AE logs. Serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be 
recorded through the patient’s last visit . All AEs should be monitored until they are resolved or 
are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent 
illness(es).   
7.1. Definitions, Documentation, and Reporting 
An AE  is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related. An AE  (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can 
Protocol  RM-493-022 V8. 1 
 54 Confidential  arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and 
from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
An AE  or suspected adverse reaction is consid ered serious ( SAE ) if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death.  
• Life-threatening . Life -threatening means that the patient was at immediate risk of 
death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction, which 
hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form. 
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171016]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the trial  period, but 
planned prior to trial entry are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed 
before the patient was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected manner during the tr ial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned). 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical event . An important medical event is an  event that may not result 
in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15977], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient or patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to pr event one of the 
outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs . Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in-patient hosp italization, 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
7.2. Procedures for AE and SAE Reporting 
Each patient must be carefully monitored for the development of any AE s. This information 
should be obtained in the form of non- leading questions (e.g., “ How are you feeling?”) and from 
signs and symptoms detected during each examination, observations of trial personnel, and 
spontaneous reports from patients. 
All AEs (serious and non-serious) spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to an 
open question from trial personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded on the appropriate CRF. Any clinically relevant 
deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical findings is considered an AE  and must 
be recorded on the appropriate CRF. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as [ADDRESS_1174604] also be en tered into the CRFs. Follow-up information on the SAE may be reque sted 
by [CONTACT_3552]. 
Sites will submit all SAE Report Forms within 24  hours via email or fax to the address below: 
 
 
If there are serious, unexpected adverse drug reactions associated with the use of the study drug, 
the sponsor or
 designee will notify the appropriate regulatory agency/agencies and all 
participating investigators on an expedited basis. It is the responsibility of the investigator to 
promptly notify the IRB/IEC where required of the IRB/IEC of all unexpected serious adverse drug reactions involving risk to human patients.  
7.2.1. Assessment of Severity, Relationship to Study Drug, and Expectedness  
For both serious and non- serious AEs, the investigator must determine both the severity of the 
event and the relationship of the event to study drug administration. Only those injection site 
reactions and laboratory abnormalities considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_845124].  Expectedness will be evaluated by [CONTACT_456]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assessment of Severity  
Intensity of AEs including clinically significant treatment -emergent laboratory abnormalities, 
injection site reactions and potential systemic reactions will be graded according to the CTCAE  
Version  4.0. The CTCAE grade refers to the severity of the AE and ranges from Grade  1 (mild 
AE), Grade  2 (moderate AE), Grade 3 (severe AE) , and Grade 4 (life -threatening or disabling 
AE) to Grade  5 (death related to AE).  
Adverse events not listed by [CONTACT_12397], including hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], will be graded as follows : 
• Mild : discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity.  
• Moderate:  discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect daily activity.  
• Severe:  inability to work or perform normal daily activity.  
• Life threatening : represents an immediate threat to life.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assessment of Relationship  
Relationship  to of an AE to study drug administration will be determined by [CONTACT_777106] : 
• None:  No relationship between the event and the administration of study drug. The 
event is related to other etiologies, such as concomitant medications or patient’s clinical state.  
• Unlikely:  The current state of knowledge indicates that a relationship to study drug 
is unlikely or the temporal relationship is such that study drug would not have had 
any reasonable association with the observed event. 

Protocol  RM-493-022 V8. 1 
 56 Confidential  • Possible:   A reaction that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration 
of the study drug and follows a known response pattern to the suspected study drug. 
The reaction might have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or other modes 
of therapy administered to the patient.  
• Probable:   A reaction that follows a plausible temporal se quence from administration 
of the study drug and follows a known response pattern to the suspected study drug. The reaction cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the patient. 
For the purpose of safety analyses, all AEs that are classified as possible or probable will be considered treatment -related events.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assessment of Expectedness 
The reference safety information (RSI) for this trial will be within the current IB. The sponsor 
will be responsible for assessment of expect edness for all AEs to determine regulatory reporting 
requirements. An unexpected AE is one that is not listed within the RSI of the IB.  
7.3. Adverse Events and Risks  
Overall, setmelanotide  has been generally well -tolerated in previous trials . The most common 
adverse reactions have been injection site reactions, skin hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], nausea, headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, back pain, fatigue, vomiting, depression, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4348],  and spontaneous penile erection. The  investigator (or a covering clinician) will be 
available at all times to trial participants in the event of a clinical emergency . This availability 
and how to reach the investigators in an emergency will be clearly communicated orally and in 
writing to trial participants . All trial interventions will be provided free of cost.  
Please refer  to the current IB  for a comprehensive summary of the AEs reported to date .  
7.3.1. Medical Monitoring  
The medical monitoring for the trial may be delegated to a medical monitor supplied by [CONTACT_315125] ( CRO ) managing the operational conduct of this trial. The 
investigator has overall responsibility for the integrity of the trial and participant safety  at their 
site. This information, as well as any other unanticipated problems involving risks to patient s or 
others, will also be reported to the applicable regulatory authorities  in accordance with regulatory 
requirements. 
7.4. Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation  
AEs will be recorded on the CRFs starting from V1 up to and including the patient’s last visit. 
SAE s and deaths will be recorded on the CRFs starting from the time the ICF is signed  and 
continuing through the patient’s last visit. All AEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent 
illness(es).  
Any SAE that occurs at any time after completi on of the trial, which the investigator considers to 
be related to study drug, must be reported to the sponsor or designee.  
Protocol  RM-493-022 V8. 1 
 57 Confidential  7.5. Guidelines for Additional Monitoring and Suspension of Dosing for a 
Patient 
Patients will be monitored carefully during the treatment period during onsite clinic visits as well 
as periodic telephone calls made to the patients by [CONTACT_49740] . In the event a patient is 
withdrawn from treatment due to an AE, the patient should be encouraged to complete the ET 
Visit in order to monitor the event to resolution and obtain additional protocol defined safety 
assessments.  
Specific guidelines for dermatological events  and peni le erections are provided in the 
Appendices ( Section  11, Appendix 11.2, and Appendix 11.3) . At all times, this guidance is 
subject to the clinical judgment of the investigator and trial consultants (if applicable).  
The investigator will  notify the Medical Monitor in the event any trial participant fulfills any of 
the criteria defined in the appendices noted above, or undergoes additional monitoring for any of 
the events defined herein.  
Male and female sexual function and hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_845101].  
7.5.1. Depression or Suicidality  
A patient should be referred to a mental health provider ( MHP ) if he/she has:  
 
• Any suicidal behavior. 
 
A referral to an MHP should also be made if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_845102] . Any event necessitating referral to an  MHP is to be reported as an AE. 
If a patient’s psychiatric disorder can be adequately treated with psychotherapy  and/or 
pharmacotherapy, then the patient, at the discretion of the MHP, should be continued in the trial. 
Any elevation in  should be evaluated to determine whether it meets 
the criteria for reporting as an AE. 
8. STATISTICAL PROCEDURES 
This section describes the plans for analysis. Details of the statistical analysis will be described 
in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) a nd the final clinical trial r eport.  
8.1. Sample Size Estimation  
The primary objective of this trial  is to evaluate long- term safety and tolerability in patients with 
various rare genetic, syndromic, or acquired forms of obesity impacting the MC4R pathway after completing planned setmelanotide  treatment in a previously completed index protocol. All 
patients who complete an index protocol and meet eligibility criteria can enroll in this trial. Thus, sample size estimation and power  analyses are not relevant.  

Protocol  RM-493-[ADDRESS_1174605], estimated power 
for exploratory endpoints such as expected  
will not be provided, and efficacy will be only summarized.  
8.2. Hypotheses 
Setmelanotide continues to be safe and well tolerated throughout this extension protocol. 
Setmelanotide leads to a clinically relevant reduction of body  endpoints and long-
term maintenance of weight- related improv ements  in each population of patients with rare 
genetic, syndromic, or acquired dis eases of obesity (each population analyzed separately).  
8.3. Definition of Population(s) for Analysis  
This prot ocol includes a variety of patient populations who are included as a matter of 
administrative convenience (each population is so rare this protocol anticipates a small number 
of patients in each population). Each sub-population may be analyzed separately as ≥[ADDRESS_1174606] current version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) and summarized by [CONTACT_845125], the number of patients reporting each AE, and the number of 
patients with any AE. 
Analyses of AEs will be performed for those events that are c onsidered treatment -emergent, 
where treatment -emergent is defined as any AE with onset after the administration of study drug 
through the end of the trial, specifically, [ADDRESS_1174607]- dose values will be summarized 
for vital signs and clinical laboratory results . Frequency of patients with abnormal safety 
laboratory result s will be tabulated . 

Protocol  RM-493-022 V8. 1 
 60 Confidential  The patient or his/her guardian or legal representative must provide written informed 
consent/assent any time th e informed consent form/assent form is updated during the course of 
the trial. Patients must be informed of and provide consent/assent to the most current version of the informed consent form(s) (ICFs) during their participation in the trial, and a copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the patient or their legally authorized representative.  
9.4. Patient Confidentiality  
In order to maintain patient privacy, all source documents/CRFs, study drug accountability records, trial reports and communications will identify the patient by [CONTACT_845126]. The investigator will grant monitor(s) and auditor(s) from the sponsor or its designee 
and regulatory authority /authorities  access to the patient’s original medical records for 
verification of data gathered on  the source documents/CRFs and to audit the data collection 
process. The patient’s confidentiality will be maintained and will not be made publicly available to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_4913]. 
9.5. Protocol Compliance 
The investigat or will conduct the trial in compliance with the protocol provided by [CONTACT_456], 
and given approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1686] /IEC  and the appropriate regulatory 
authority/authori ties. Modifications to the protocol should not be made without agreement of 
both the investigator and the sponsor. Changes to the protocol will require written IRB/IEC  
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_51703], except when the modification is needed to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to patients . The IRB/IEC  may provide, if applicable regulatory 
authority/authorities permit, expedited review and approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_51704](s) in ongoing trials  that have the approval /favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/IEC . The 
sponsor or designee will submit all protocol modifications to the regulatory authority/authorities  
in accordance with the governing regulations.  
When immediate deviation from the protocol is required to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to 
patients, the investigator will contact [CONTACT_456] , if circumstances permit, to discuss the planned 
course of action . Any departures from the protocol must be fully documented in the source 
documents/CRF. 
9.6. Trial  Conduct During the COVID -19 (Coronavirus) Pandemic 
The worldwide Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may impact the conduct of clinical trials  due to the challenges from quarantines, site closures,  travel limitations, and other 
considerations if site personnel or trial participants become potentially exposed to or infected 
with COVID-19. To assure the safety of trial participants, maintain compliance with GCP, and 
minimize risks to trial integrity, if necessary, in consultation with the sponsor, the method of 
assessment may be changed (e.g., paper assessments replaced by [CONTACT_709813]) . In 
addition, site visits may be replaced with telephone, internet-based video‑conferencing applications, o r home visits by [CONTACT_532327]. Normal procedures, as 
detailed in this protocol, will be resumed as soon as possible thereafter.  
More detailed guidance on trial conduct during the COVID- 19 pandemic is provided in 
Appendix 11.6.

 61 Confidential  9.7. Data Management 
9.7.1. Data Handling  
Data will be recorded at the site on source documents and reviewed by [CONTACT_58139] (CRA) duri ng monitoring visits . The CRA will verify data recorded in the electronic 
CRF (eCRF ) system with source documents. All corrections or changes made to any trial data 
must be appropriately tracked in an audit trail in the eCRF system. Electronic CRFs will be  
considered complete when all missing, incorrect, and/or inconsistent data have been accounted 
for. 
9.7.2. Computer Systems  
Data will be processed using a validated computer system conforming to regulatory 
requirements.  
9.7.3. Data Entry  
Data must be recorded using the eCRF system as the trial is in progress . All trial site personnel 
must log into the system using their secure user name [CONTACT_183132], review, or correct trial data. These procedures must comply with Title 21 of the Code of Federal 
Regulat ions (21 CFR Part  11). All passwords will be strictly confidential.  
9.7.4. Medical Information Coding  
For medical information , the following thesauri will be used:  
• MedDRA for AE s 
• WHO Drug for concomitant medications 
9.7.5. Data Validation 
Validation checks programmed within the eCRF system, as well as supplemental validation 
performed via review of the downloaded data, will be applied to the data in order to ensure 
accurate, consistent, and reliable data. Data identified as erroneous, or data that are missin g, will 
be referred to the investigative site for resolution through data queries. 
Electronic CRFs must be reviewed and electronically signed by [CONTACT_845127]. 
9.8. Direct Access to Source Data 
The trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_3552] . Monitoring will be perfo rmed by a 
representative of the sponsor (site monitor) and will include review of the source 
documents/CRFs for completeness and clarity, cross-checking with source documents, and 
clarification of administrative matters will be performed . The review of medical records will be 
performed in a manner to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.  
The site monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to protocol design and regulatory require ments by [CONTACT_54665] (letter, telephone, and fax). 
Protocol  RM-493-022 V8. 1 
 62 Confidential  All unused study drug and other trial materials are to be returned to the sponsor or designee after 
the clinical phase of the trial has been completed (see Section  5.6).  
Regulatory authorities, the IRB /IEC , and/or the sponsor ’s clinical quality assurance group or 
designee may request access to all source documents, CRFs, and other trial documentation for 
on-site audit or inspection. Direct access to these documents must be guaranteed by [CONTACT_1275], who must provide support at all times for these activities.  
9.9. Source Document/Case Report Form Completion  
Source documents/CRFs will be completed for each trial patient . It is the investigator ’s 
responsibility to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported  in the 
patient’s source document/CRF . The source document/CRFs should indicate the patient’s 
participation in the trial and should document the dates and details of trial procedures, AE s, and 
patient status.  
The investigator, or designated representative, should complete the source document/CRFs as 
soon as possible after information is collected, preferably on the same day that a trial patient is 
seen for an examination, treatment, or any other trial procedure. Any outstanding entries must be 
completed immediately after the final examination . An explanation should be given for all 
missing data. 
The investigator must sign and date the investigator’s Statement at the end of the source 
document/CRFs to endorse the recorded data.  
9.10. Record Retention 
The investigator will maintain all trial  records according to ICH -GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirement(s) . Records will be retained for at least [ADDRESS_1174608] or according to applicable regulatory requirement(s) . If the investigator withdraws from 
the responsibility of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_124688], custody must be transferred to a person willing to 
accept the responsibility . The sponsor must be notified in writing if a custodial change occurs. 
9.11. Liability Insurance  
The sponsor has subscribed to an insurance policy covering, in its terms and provisions, its legal 
liability for injuries caused to participating persons and arising out of this research performed strictly in accordance with the scientific protocol as well as with applicable law and professional 
standards.  
9.12. Publication of Trial  Findings and Use of Information  
All information regarding setmelanotide supplied by [CONTACT_845128] . The investigator agrees to use this information to accomplish the 
trial and will not use it for other purposes without consent from the sponsor. It is understood that 
there is an obligation to provide the sponsor with complete data obtained during the trial. The 
information obtained from the clinical trial will be used towards the d evelopment of 
setmelanotide and may be disclosed to regulatory authority/authorit ies, other investigators, 
corporate partners, or consultants as required. 
Protocol  RM-493-022 V8. 1 
 63 Confidential  It is the intention of the sponsor and the academic investigators to publish the results of this tria l 
in a peer-reviewed journal upon completion. For this purpose, a publication committee of the key 
investigator s will likely be identified and initiated during the course of this trial.

 67 Confidential  11.2. Guidance for Monitoring Potential Treatment- Related 
Dermatological Changes and Suggested Criteria for Discontinuation 
of Dosing  
In clinical trials  conducted with setmelanotide, skin hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (tanning), primarily 
noted on sun exposed areas, was reported  during the first 7-14 days of treatment at clinical doses . 
In Phase 1/[ADDRESS_1174610] dermatological photographs do not robustly capture changes in skin color or hue 
(which require very care fully controlled standard conditions and lighting), sites that may have 
such equipment should discuss this with the sponsor to determine if their equipment meets the rigorous standards for following patients over time. If the sponsor and investigator both agree 
that such testing can be performed, sites are encouraged to do so with the careful monitoring by 
[CONTACT_456]. It is expected that few sites (and patients) will have the necessary facilities.  
The dermatologist will also serve as a consultant for the investigative s ite in the event a patient 
reports changes to their skin, including skin tanning, or darkening of existing, or the appearance 
of new, pi[INVESTIGATOR_845105] . These events are expected, and were observed in other 
setmelanoti de clinical studie s, but may require dermatological evaluation outside of the SOA. 
In the event of skin tanning, the patient should generally remain on treatment, with continued monitoring, or at more frequent intervals as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_845129]/or 
dermatologist.  
In the event of darkening skin lesions, or the presence of a new pi[INVESTIGATOR_845106], the 
investigator can refer the patient to the dermatologist for an evaluation . If clinically indicated, the 
lesion may be biopsied, otherwi se careful monitoring is recommended and the patient should 
remain on study drug.  
Any biopsies must be evaluated by a trained dermatopathologist, and biopsy reports must be part 
of the trial information for each patient.  
Protocol  RM-493-[ADDRESS_1174611] 
until progress towards resolution of the event (up to ~60-[ADDRESS_1174612] dosing, if needed).  
  
Protocol  RM-493-[ADDRESS_1174613] been reported in setmelanotide clinical studies, however, in the 
event one is reported, study drug injection is to be stopped immediately and an examination of 
the patient performed by [CONTACT_093] ; alternatively, the patient should be instructed to seek 
emergent medical care.  
11.4. Assessment of Renal Function 
11.4.1. Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Equation 
In patients, ≥18 years of age, the Modification  of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)  Equation 
should be used as follows: 
GFR = 175 x (cr eatinine in mg/dL )-1.154 x (age  in years )-0.203 x (0.742 if female) x (1.210 if 
African American)  
11.4.2. Bedside Schwartz Equati on 
In patients, <18 years of age, the Bedside Schwartz Equation should be used as follows:  
GFR (mL/min/1.73  m²) = (0.41 × height in centimeters) / creatinine in mg/dL  
11.5. Considerations for Reducing Pain and Distress in the Pediatric 
Population 
Although the study procedures and assessments required per protocol are classified as “No or 
Minimal Risk” (with the exception of DXA, which is classified as “Minor Increase over Minimal 
Risk”) according to the 2008 Guidance Document “Ethical Consideration s for Clinical Trials on 
Medicinal Products Conducted with the Paediatric Population”, considerations for reducing pain in distress in participants younger than 18 years of age are suggested below. 
• The clinical trial may only be conducted if it subjects th e person concerned to as little 
burden and other foreseeable risks as possible . 
Protocol  RM-493-022 V8. 1 
 70 Confidential  • Physical and emotional pain should be prevented as much as possible, and effectively 
treated when unavoidable. 
• In order to minimize pain, distress, and fear, facilities should be appropriate to 
childcare, and the personnel should be trained to look after children and supervised by [CONTACT_845130]. Staff should be trained to communicate with 
both parents (or legal representative) and children . Generally, this would assume non-
adult patients are being studied at experienced pediatric centers.  
• For most procedures, the child should always be accompanied by a trial- related staff 
member who could provide reassurance. At the sign of distress and/or dissent the procedure should be stopped; a short pause to allow the child to feel in control, further explanation and an assessment of the situation may be needed to reassure the 
child, or to decide to definitely abandon the procedure at the discretion of the 
investigator. 
• In all situations, investigations/interventions should be limited to the minimum 
required for obtaining valid data and performed using size- /age-appropriate material 
and devices, including limiting in advance the number of attempts for sampling. 
• Study drug injections should only be performed by [CONTACT_3654] (or home health care professionals), unless the child is of suitable age and competency, and desires the 
ability to do so. 
• Although almost all study procedures are classified as low risk (with the exceptio n of 
DXA, which is classified as “minor increase over minimal risk”), risk should be 
continuously monitored and assessed by [CONTACT_318454].  
• For assessments in which there is a psychological component measures should be 
taken to minimize distress . For example, Tanner Staging assessments could utilize a 
diagram for the child to point to and indicate what stage they currently are, vs. having 
to have an exam ination  without clothes. 
A comment on benefit–risk:  risk is very low, from procedures and/or kno wn safety profile of the 
drug (both clinically and toxicologically, where large margins and preliminary data from juvenile tox studies have not identified any new or concerning safety concerns), and based on treatment 
experience in several forms of rare genetic , syndromic, or acquired dis eases of obesity impacting 
the MC4 R pathway, there is the possibility of major benefit.   
Protocol  RM-493-[ADDRESS_1174614] During the COVID -19 (Coronavirus) 
Pandemic 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could impact the conduct of this clinical study for several 
reasons, including: self -isolation/quarantine by [CONTACT_845131]- site personnel; travel 
restrictions/limited access to public places, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]; and reassignment of  site 
personnel to critical tasks.  
In accordance with recent health authority guidance, the sponsor is providing temporary 
considerations for study conduct in the event of disruption of the study. This guidance does not 
supersede any local or government requirements or the clinical judgment of the investigator. If at 
any time a patient ’s safety is considered to be at risk, study intervention will be discontinued, and 
study follow-up will be conducted. 
If COVID restrictions are imposed on or by [CONTACT_845132], the following measures are recommended on a temporary basis during the COVID- 19 pandemic :  
• Where possible, every effort should be made to complete all protocol-required assessments. In place of a required site visit, a qualified healthcare provider could 
perform study -related procedures as per the SOA (Table  1) via a home visit, including 
but not limited to collection of body weight, vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), recording of adverse events (AEs), collection of blood and urine samples. Most efficacy assessments could potentially be done off site. 
investigators should use their clinical judgment to determine whether a patient can continue study treatment in the absence of on -site clinic visits, or consider 
alternatives such as temporary treatment interruption or s tudy discontinuation. 
• All protocol -required assessments missed due to COVID restrictions should be 
documented in detail within the patients’ source documents and should be clearly designated as “COVID -19 RELATED” . It must be documented if a site visit is 
instead conducted remotely. Source documentation should detail how each assessment was collected (e.g., remote vs. on -site, central vs. local laboratory, vital 
signs taken at home by [CONTACT_845133]. delegated in-home nursing). 
• If applicable, discontinuations of study interventions and withdrawal from the study due to disruption of study conduct by [CONTACT_709820] “COVID -19 RELATED” in the case report form (CRF).  
COVID-19 Infection in Study Patients : 
There is currently no avail able data suggesting that patients treated with setmelanotide should 
have treatment interrupted during the COVID-[ADDRESS_1174615] this recorded as an AE, and if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], 
this should be reported as a serious adverse event (SAE ).

1 Background and Significance  
Inadequate management o f preoperative mental health disorders often contributes to poor 
postoperative outcomes  [1], including increased rates of readmission, delirium, falls, and mortality  
[2-5]. However,  very little work has been done to improve perioperative mental health. In particular, 
there ha s been limited systematic efforts that identify evidence -based behavioral  and pharmacological  
strategies  that were originally developed for depression and anxiety in otherwise medically well 
psychiatric patients .  A mental health intervention bundle, composed  of behavioral and 
pharmacological strategies, can mitigate anxiety and depression symptoms during the perioperative 
period  [6]. However, we currently lack conclusive evidence on effectiveness of  such an intervention 
bundle focused on the delivery of perioperative mental health care in older surgical patients. Towards 
this end, we will develop and test  an intervention bundle that encompasses:  (1) behavioral activation, 
and (2) medication optimization  (see more details on the intervention bundle in section 4.2).  
 
2 Objective s 
 
 
    
 
Page 2 of 18 
 The study will address the following objectives: (1) demonstrate the feasibility  of our study 
procedures including patient recruitment, screening and outcome measures, and feasibility of 
adapting our intervention bundle and its intervention delivery process  within  three older surgical 
patient  populations (i.e., orthopedic, oncologic, and cardiac) ; (2) empi[INVESTIGATOR_804905]/or anxiety ; and lastly (3) identify implementation strategies  to ensure acceptability, 
feasibility, and adoption of our intervention bundle by [CONTACT_804925] . Insights 
gained from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_804906] t hat are planned to start in 
Jan 2023. This project is led by [CONTACT_804926]://perioperativewellness.wustl.edu/ that strives to  improv e 
perioperative mental health and well -being  for older adults .  
 
[ADDRESS_1111175] to recruit and enroll up to  70 participants 
total in this study : up to 45 patients, up to 12- 15 in each of 3 surgical cohorts; up to 25 caregiver 
participants.  
 3.1 Patient Participants  
3.1.1 Inclusion criteria  
Patients will be included if they meet all of the following eligibility criteria:  
1. Age ≥60 years on the day of surgery;   
2. Scheduled major orthopedic surgery, or major surgical resection of a thoracic or 
abdominal malignancy, or majo r cardiac procedure;  
3. Clinically significant depression or anxiety symptoms screened by [CONTACT_127659] -ADS 
(Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale) ≥ 10 [7].  
3.1.2 Exclusion criter ia 
Patients will be excluded f rom the study if they meet any  of the following:  
1. Estimated life expectancy < 12 months ;  
2. Unable to read, speak, and understand English;   
3. Current alcohol or other substance abuse ;   
4. Severe cognitive impairment screened by [CONTACT_804927] (Short Blessed Test)  >10;   
5. Acutely suicidal ( see instruments in Appendix A) .  
Data related to patient inclusion and exclusion will be gathered either via EHR chart review, and/or 
clinical PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106], and/or self-reported by [CONTACT_804928].  Eligible 
patients  will be offered the opportunity to participate in the study regardless of gender or minority 
status. Thus, the sample composition will reflect the composition of community -living older adults in 
the St. Louis area. All  of our studies actively encourage the participation of minorities in the research.  
 
3.2 Caregiver participants  
 
 
    
 
Page 3 of 18 
 Caregivers offer a unique perspective on a patient’s mood and health status, and can be in a position 
to help effect change, engagement in activities and potentially our intervention bundle. Patient 
caregivers will be identified by [CONTACT_804929] a family member or friend who cares for the patien t as 
needed to support health and safety, and often have add itional c are-related responsibilities in the 
perioperative period.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1111176] 6 0 years of age with an eligible surgery scheduled at BJH/WUSM. For the WUSM 
Orthopedic Surgery clinics, patients complete a PROMIS questionnaire as standard routine practice at appointment check -in. Given that  the PROMIS scores are available for the ortho pedic surgical 
patients , the EHR report will be further customized as needed based on PROMIS  scores . 
 
Initial contact [CONTACT_804930], or in -person if the patient is on 
campus for a clinical visit in one of the collaborating departments.  We will use a n information sheet 
or phone script ( see Appendix A) to introduce the goals of the center and the study. Additionally,  
recruitment flyers ( see Appendix B) will be utilized to invite interested patients to contact [CONTACT_804931].  The IRB -approved f lyers will be distributed to the waiting rooms and clinical offices 
of the clinicians seeing our target population, as well as the CPAP which many surgical patients visit prior to scheduled surgery . Lastly, patients can also  be referred to the study by [CONTACT_137021], either 
by [CONTACT_14659] a recruitment flyer to any patients who meet our inclusion criteria, or by [CONTACT_804932]. Clinica l teams may refer patients to the study team for screening, some 
by [CONTACT_648], or email to study team members, or email to [EMAIL_15304]
. Some prospecti ve 
participants may have clinic  visits at the included Departments’ satellite sites, and some orthopedic 
procedures scheduled through Washington University take place at Barnes -Jewish West County 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], where those patients ma y also be enrolled and  have study visits.  However, the majority of 
consenting and  study procedures will take place within  the WUSM and BJH Medical Center Campus.   
  
3.3.2 Patient screening  
We will then screen the patients who are interested to proceed in  the study  and provide a verbal 
consent . (Appendix A) The screening checklist (also in Appendix A) will be based on our eligibility 
criteria (see criteria above). To avoid burdening patients with the full PHQ -ADS at the time of 
screening, patients will first be asked to complete the brief PHQ-4 (i.e., first 4 questions of PHQ -
ADS related to anxiety and depression) Patients who score >3 w ill continue with the remaini ng 
questions in the PHQ- ADS . Patients with a total score  of PHQ-AD S ≥10, and a SBT  (Short Blessed 
Test)  score of < 9 will be invited to consent  to participate in the stud y (Table 1) . This will be 
completed at the time of recruitment by a trained member of the research team , and  the screener can 
be collected by [CONTACT_804933].

3.3.3 Caregiver recruitment   
Patients may refer their caregivers (e.g., spouse, partner, children, friend) to contact [CONTACT_804934], or if they prefer to share the caregiver’s phone number, the stud y team contact [CONTACT_804935].  With the patients’ consent, patients’ caregivers are also  invited to participate by 
[CONTACT_648], or mail. They will participate in a brief REDCap survey to report  any changes related to 
confusion or delirium in the patient once before  surgery, and once per week for 4 weeks  after surgery 
(FAM -CAM  attached ). Additionally, some patients’ care givers  (up to 25) will be invited to participate 
in a semi-structured interview  (see Appendix J) after the patient’s participation in the intervention has 
been completed .  
  
3.[ADDRESS_1111177] about study 
participation with a study team member, and then complete the Informed Consent Form (Appendix 
C). The informed consent will be a vailable  either via a paper collected by [CONTACT_109715], or by 
[CONTACT_804936] e -consent, as per patient preferen ce. Patients who meet all eligibility criteria 
in 3.1 and provide consent may be enrolled into the study  per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106] . Some patients who meet 
the eligibility criteria but who may require additional clinical input  before enrolling them into the 
study, will be discussed with the study team clinicians and the PI.  
 
3.4.2 Caregiver consen t 
Caregivers will be invited to participate in semi- structured interviews about the intervention bundle 
that can be conducted via Zoom/Phone or in -person depending on part icipant convenience and 
choice. Hence, they will be consented verbally or with a written consent  depending on their 
participation .  If they consent  to a semi -structured interview (Appendix J) . The interviews with 
study patient caregivers, will provide valuable feedba ck on the intervention bundle. Caregivers may 
also consent verbally to participate in the FAM -CAM confusion and delirium assessment via 
phone, mail, or email link to REDCap survey.

Page 5 of 18 
 quantitative data collected, qualitative methods will be employed to evaluate acceptability, 
implementation and practicality  of the intervention .   
            4.1 Assessments  
At enrollment, a research coordinator will administer  a battery of baseline assessments (see Appendix 
D) to characterize patient participants. Patient p articipants will complete these  baseline assessments 
after consent :    
• Demographics survey  
• Medical History of Comorbidities  
• Brief Pain survey  
• BADS (Behavioral Activation Depression Scale)  
• Brief survey of P atient Reported Falls past 3mo  
• VR-12 Quality of Life survey 
• SDM -4 (Shared Decision Making)  
• PHQ- ADS (Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale, 
collected at screening in Appendix A ) 
• SBT ( Short Blessed Test , collected at screening in Appendix A )    
• Review of Medication list  (at initial intervention visit)    Ultra Brief Confusion 
Assessment Method (and 3D -CAM if UB -CAM is positive) or FAM -CAM , 
and/or  delirium may be assessed by [CONTACT_804937] -DEL  [23] 
method (Appendix M) .   
Anxiety and depression assessment will use the PHQ -ADS, as described above.  The use of this tool 
for this population is supported by a recent meta -analysis suggesting that the PHQ9 (on which this 
tool is based) has good sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of depression  in older adults  [9]. 
Quality of Life  (QoL) will be assessed using the Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey (VR -12) 
[10]. The questions in this patient -reported survey correspond to the QoL domains of general health 
perceptions, physical functioning, role limitations due to physical and emotional problems, bodily 
pain, energy/fatigue levels, social functioning and mental healt h. Cognitive function assessment will 
be performed using the  Short Blessed Test  (SBT)  as described above. The SBT  is a reliable test  for 
characterizing cognitive functioning in this setting  [22] . Falls data will be collected by [CONTACT_804938] -Reported Falls Questionnaire, which will be collected  
by [CONTACT_804939] a REDCap survey which can  be emailed to participants one 
time per month asking about any falls over the last month.  
 
4.2 Perioperative Mental Health Intervention Bundle  
Our intervention bundle will  be initiated prior to surgery  and continue postoperatively,  and will span 
for approximately 3 to 4 months across the perioperative period (including pre - and [ADDRESS_1111179]-
operative periods) . The personalized intervention bundle is comprised  of behavioral activation and 
medication optimization , both facilitated by [CONTACT_804940].  
  
4.2.[ADDRESS_1111180] of behavioral activation (BA) , the basic premise of which is 
to help people with mental health problems to engage in activities that are reinforcing or meaningful 
and guided by [CONTACT_804941]  [13]. The interventionists in this component of the interve ntion 
bundle , Perioperative Wellness Partners, are qualified social workers and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_804907] , in addition to specific training to implement this intervention .  Patients will 
be asked to check with their physicians if there is any question about the safety of any physical activities that are included in the behavioral activation plan.  Behavioral activation as the core 
intervention allows for uniformity across participants from each cohort, yet enough flexibility for the actual components of behavioral activation to be individually adapted based on patient preferences.  
In a recent meta- analysis, behavioral activation programs improved depression and anxiety  [14], as 
well as disability in older adults  [15]. In addition, BA  delivered by [CONTACT_804942] -
effectiv e and lowered health care utilization costs over 1 year  [16]. In addition to the core 
intervention of behavioral activation, study participants will be able to adapt the intervention by 
[CONTACT_804943], per their preference, with demonstrated benefit in improving depression and  
anxiety symptoms in older adults  [17, 18] . BA will span across approximately 3 months 
postoperatively and will  begin pre -operatively, with sessions approximately weekly  or biweekly, 
depending on patient preference and health condition . For example, participants with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_127100] 
>1 week , behavioral intervention may  continue weekly in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339347] , if the patient chooses . 
Finally, after discharge  during the postoperative period, the behavioral intervention will continue  for 
the remaining months/sessions . The timing, format and frequency of the behavioral activation 
sessions will b e adapted and tailored based on patient preferences and needs. T he behavioral  
activation  process will be guided by [CONTACT_804944], (Appendix F)  which will be 
adapted and calibrated as needed  throughout th is feasibility study,  along with the  adaptations to the 
BA patient worksheet s (see Appendix H) which the patient and perioperative wellness partners  may 
use to guide  these intervention sessions and activities . We will track all adaptations to BA conduct 
and content during this study  for our future intervention study.  
 
4.2.[ADDRESS_1111181] developed and refined a process for this review 
and medication optimization, including adjusting suboptimal dosing for anti -depressant s and 
discontinuing medications that are harmful for brain health (such as anticholinergics  [19] ). 
Medication optimizati on consists of a simple set of principles: reconcile patient’s medications, 
identify the patient’s likely need for, and interest in, a medication adjustment, make the adjustment, and assess the response to that adjustment. B enzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651],  non-benzodiazepi [INVESTIGATOR_666855],  strong 
centrally acting anticholinergics , and antihistamines  may be deprescribed as they increase the risk for 
falls and delirium. We will follow the principles of shared decision -making with patients for 
medication changes , identifying DEMS (deprescribing eligible medications) which worsen functional 
recovery, impair cognitive function, and increase medical risks like falls, delirium, and bleeding   
With the patients’ consent, we will initiate communication with t he prescribing provider regarding 
any changes to medications (DEMs in particular) which they have prescribed.  While the participant 
is in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , the interventionist’s role will include coordinating with the hospi [INVESTIGATOR_804908] -house and that no new 
inappropriate medications are initiated. We will give voice to patient and family concerns by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_804909] 7 of 18 
 them communicate with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (and subsequent transitional) provider t eam. After discharge, 
and up to approximately [ADDRESS_1111182] will ensure that medication 
changes are reconciled during transitions of care. The interventionists will ensure the agreed -upon 
changes are implemented, or an alternative course of action is justified.  The internal study team 
manual for medication optimization  will be updated as needed in the feasibility study . Please see 
Medication Optimization SOP in Appendix F.   
 
4.3 Evaluation Measures and Outcomes  
Preoperative assessments along with preoperative and postoperative surveys  (assessments described 
in 4.1 above)  regarding quality of life, depression, and anxiety will be obtained from all study 
participants. Study participants will be followed for  approximately  3 months after their scheduled 
procedure. They will complete follow -up surveys  at approximate ly 1 month and approximately 3 
months after surgery by [CONTACT_804945]- based survey, mail, or via a telephone interview  (or in person if 
the visit coincides with a clinic visit). Collection of falls data will occur approximately monthly for 3 
months by [CONTACT_804946], or REDCap,  or in person.  The results of follow -up surveys  
will be obtained via secure R EDCap e-mail link, mail, or telephone survey. Rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_804910] -report  and/or EHR at the end of study follow -up. Please see Table [ADDRESS_1111183] using the 
research data core (RDC). Post -operative data including post -operative acute diagnoses (e.g., 
complications), additional procedures, postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], pain scores will also be retrieved.

In addit ion to these outcomes, we will also be assessing fidelity of our intervention bundle which will 
assess the extent to which an intervention bundle is carried out by [CONTACT_804950], 
as intended and consistently across different settings, and patients.  To track this, we will observe and 
take notes on  the patient and the perioperative wellness partner  during the  behavioral intervention and 
medication optimization sessions with the patient and clinician. Observations will  involve a member 
of the research  team  observing the wellness partner over a period of time or number of  intervention  
sessions . We will  capture data on patient  interactions with the wellness partner, their delivery of the 
intervention bundle , any observed barriers and facilitators to the intervention adherence, acceptance 
and fit within the perioperative workflow.  These observation sessions of patients and their wellness 
 
 
    
 
Page 12 of 18 
 partners will be selected based on a convenience sample.   If the patient agrees to audio/video 
recording, th e intervention sessions will be audio recorded (or audio/video if the patient prefers to 
meet by [CONTACT_804951]).  The observations may be made by a member of the research team 
reviewing the recorded sessions.   
Lastly, we will also obtain various stakeholder perspectives on the intervention bundle after the 
intervention period  has been completed  using semi -structured interviews. We will conduct interviews 
with patients,  and caregivers, and the topi[INVESTIGATOR_804919] (Consolidated Framework of Implementation  Research) . The 
interviews will explore the participants’ perceptions, attitudes, experiences with  the intervention  
bundle, intervention bundle acceptability and detailed accounts of participants' experiences after the 
intervention has been stopped with regards to intervention sustainability and maintenance. These 
insights will inform whether the intervention bundle needs to be changed or ad apted before our  future

6 Patient Participant Retention  
Participant  retention strategies wil l include flexibili ty in sche duling follow-up visit s and coo rdination 
of research (both data collection and intervention)  visits with the clinical visits. Remuneration for 
each data collection study visit will be provided after the final follow -up visit to  encourage retention 
as well.  For patients who are difficult to reach by [CONTACT_648], we may utilize a reminder,  the Attempting to 
Reach You Letter (Appendix N) to remind them to contact [CONTACT_804952] a study session.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_1111198] research.  
All members of the study team are IRB -approved and trained in Good Clinical Practice and Human 
Subjects Research education.   
 8 Data Management  for Participant  Privacy  
A unique patient number (UPN) will be assigned at enrollment and used wherever possible on the case report forms (CRF) to identify data, minimizing use of patients’ names or personal identifiers in 
data.

 All paper data will be stored under lock and key ( two locked doors, e .g., office, file cabinet) and all 
electronic data will be hosted on a password -protected, firewall -secured server that is only accessible 
to the research team through password -protected departmental computers. Surveys  that are completed 
electronically will be administered via the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) server. All 
REDCap email correspondence will be sent using secure survey links. Similarly, interview data from 
caregivers will follow the same security and storage policies.  
 8.[ADDRESS_1111199] of Protected Health Information c ollected for study 
For Patient and Caregiver Participants , the HIPAA -protected identifiers that will be collected for 
this study include:  
• Name  
• Date of bi rth 
• Contact [CONTACT_3031]  
• Mailing address  
• Phone number  
• Electronic mail address  
• SSN for the purpose of remuneration   
For Patient Participants only , these additional HIPAA -protected identifiers will also be collected 
for study:  
• Dates of services (surgical procedure, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  
• Medical record number  
 
9 Potential Risks  
This study involves minimal risk to subjects. Unlikely but potential risks include error s in medication 
recommendations or medication withdrawal symptoms, an d breach of confidentiality. The risk of 
medication withdrawal (i.e., from benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]) is mitigated by [CONTACT_804953][INVESTIGATOR_804920]. Patients who are identified as being acu tely suicidal will be excluded 
from the study. Nevertheless, since the rate of completed suicide in the [LOCATION_003] remains high (i.e., about twice the rate of homicide) and most Americans who commit suicide suffer from depression, all 
participants eligible to par ticipate in this study are statistically at a relatively higher risk for suicide 
than the general population. However, the participants’ absolute risk for completing suicide during this brief study remains very low (i.e., about 1 in 3,000 to 10,000) and pa rticipation in the study does 
not create or increase the risk of completed suicide; rather, most experts believe that one of the most efficient ways to decrease suicidal risk in older depressed individuals is to treat their depression. 
Furthermore, all par ticipants will be formally assessed frequently throughout the study. If the study 
personnel identify that a participant has become acutely suicidal, this participant will be referred to a mental health professional for further evaluation and treatment (see  section: Procedures to Minimize 
Risks). This may lead to a clinical intervention that is lifesaving and may not have occurred had the participant not been participating in the study.  
 
[ADDRESS_1111200], and a behavioral 
intervention,  adverse events are exceedingly unlikely. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_804921].  
If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_281517] a reportable adverse event, the event will be reported 
to HRPO according to institutional guidelines.   
 
11 Procedures to Minimize Potential Risks  
[CONTACT_804957] , MD  (PI [INVESTIGATOR_804922]; Co -I on this stu dy) will 
manage the  oversight  of the intervention s making medication optimization recommendations to 
reduce the risk of medication error or medication withdrawal symptoms. Algorithms for tapering medications that  should not be abruptly discontinued will be employed. We have carried out this 
deprescribing protocol in several large RCTs and have not seen any problems occur.  
 
Suicide R isk Management:  As discussed above, at each assessment point, the research staff will 
assess for passive death wish, and suicidal ideation, intent or plan when they administer the PHQ -
ADS. If a participant endorses suicidal ideation, intent, or plan, the rater will be trained to follow an 
operationalized protocol ( Appendix E) that has been developed to manage high -risk participants in 
other studies of depressed participants potentially at risk for suicide. This protocol has already been used successfully by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Lenze’s team to manage acutely suicidal patients. Brief ly, the protocol 
entails a specific determination of the suicidal risk and prescribes a set of actions. If a participant is 
determined to be at high and immediate risks, the rater is instructed to stay w ith the participant until 
he or she has contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] a study psychiatrist ([CONTACT_155371]) to discuss the situation and to devise a plan. In case of extreme emergency, raters are instructed to call their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_804923] 911 for 
immediate help and to initiate commitment proceedings.  
 Patients will be encouraged to check with their physician if there is any question about the safety of 
any physical activities that are included in the behavioral activation plan. It is possible that the 
participant may feel uncomfortable completing the su rveys or participating in the study sessions.  The 
study sessions and interview can be discontinued at any time, and the patient may refuse to answer any questions that s/he does not wish to answer.  
To minimize the risk of breach of confidential ity, we wil l ensure that protected health information 
will only be shared with members of the research team. Only data necessary to complete the study 
will be collected. Data will be coded with UPN wherever possible, and the master list linking names 
to UPNs will be secur ely accessible only to the PI, C o-Investigators, data analyst , and primary 
research coordinator.  Electronic data will be stored as detailed in section 8.    
 
[ADDRESS_1111201] the participant by [CONTACT_756]. If any further referrals are deemed necessary 
(i.e., social work or psychiatry), these referrals will be made in collaboration with the patient’s 
primary medical team.  
 There is also a risk of breach of confidentiality. All reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that 
patient privacy is maintained. Hard copy data (i.e. signed informed consent forms) will be maintained 
in a locked office within a locked suite. Electronic data will be stored on a Washington University password -protected server and never stored on a portable hard drive or laptop computer. Patient data 
will be identified b y a study ID only, with a master key linking patient names with study IDs kept in a 
separate file accessible only to the Primary Investigator and Research Study Assistant.  
 The only interventions outside the standard of care for management of the patient’s  diagnosed 
condition in this study are the administration of questionnaires, a cognitive test,  and medication 
optimization. We expect that the occurrence of a serious adverse event as it relates to these study 
interventions to be extremely rare. If a breach of confidentiality were to occur, it would be reported to 
QASMC and HRPO within [ADDRESS_1111202] the patient anything to participate in the study, and with the flex ible design allowing 
for phone visits, they will not be required to make any extra study visits to the medical center (some 
visits may be concurrent with a clinic or procedure appointment).  Patients will receive remuneration 
by [CONTACT_804954] $[ADDRESS_1111203] -EOS data collection surveys , and semi -structured interview, up to $125 after completion of 
their participation .

1.1. Synopsis  
Protocol Title:  Escalating Dose and Randomized, Controlled Study of Nusinersen 
(BIIB058) in Participants With Spi[INVESTIGATOR_101965]:  232SM203  
Version Number:  7 
Name [CONTACT_102176]:  Research Name:  [CONTACT_102177]058  
Generic Name:  [CONTACT_102178]:   Spi[INVESTIGATOR_101966]:  2/3 
Study Indication:  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_11902] (SMA)  
Study Rationale:  Efficacy and safety results across the nusinersen clinical development 
program have demonstrated an overall positive benefit -risk profile of 
nusinersen across a broad range of SMA phenotypes and patient 
populations. Nusinersen is approved in the United Sta tes, Europe, 
and other countries and regions for the treatment of SMA in pediatric 
and adult patients at a recommended dosage of [ADDRESS_112928] dose, and maintenance doses every 4 months 
thereafter. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) 
analyses indicate that nusinersen drug exposure higher than that 
achieved with 12  mg in patients with SMA may produce an even 
greater benefit in motor function. Additionally, PK modeling and 
simulations identified dosing regimens that achieve higher drug 
exposure more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. Therefore, this study is being conducted to 
investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability,  of a 50/28 -mg 
dose of nusinersen (50 -mg loading dose; 28 -mg maintenance dose) 
and a dosing regimen targeted to achieve higher drug exposure more 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. This study will be conducted in participants with genetically 
confirmed SMA.  
Rationale for Dose 
and Schedule 
Selection:  The clinical PK, safety, and efficacy of nusinersen have been 
evaluated in a number of patient populations (infantile -onset [SMA 
symptom onset ≤  6 months (≤  180 days) of age], later -onset [SMA 
symptom onset >  6 months (>  180 days) of age], and 
presymptomatic). The approved dosing regimen of nusinersen is 
12 mg administered in 4 loading doses during a 2 -month period

11 followed by [CONTACT_102048] 4 months thereafter. In the 
original development program, 2  different dosing regimens 
(4 loading doses followed by [CONTACT_102048] 4 months and 
3 loading doses followed by [CONTACT_102048] 6  months) 
were evaluated in sham -controlled studies. Results from these 
studies, the population PK and exposure -response modeling, and the 
nonhuman primate safety studies were used as the basis for selecting 
dosing regimens in this study.  
An exploratory exposure -response analysis performed in participants 
with infantile -onset SMA (Study CS3A, n = 20, age 38  days to 
8 months) showed a statistically significant positive correlation 
between nusinersen cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) exposure and motor 
function (e.g., Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101967] [CHOP -INTEND] scores).  
Previous PK modeling predicted that the median concentration of 
nusinersen within the CSF immediately prior to the administration of 
the subsequent maintenance dose (i.e., trough concentration [Ctrough]) 
would be approximately 10 ng/mL at steady state with the 
label -approved maintenance dosing regimen (i.e., 12 mg 
administered every 4  months) and approximately 20 ng/mL at steady 
state with the proposed maintenance dosing regimen for Study 
232SM203 (i.e., 28 mg administered every 4  months). This model 
was su bsequently updated to include additional data from 
Studies  232SM201 and CS11 not previously modeled, resulting in an 
adjustment of CSF C trough predictions in all patient populations, which 
are still consistent with the prior predictions. As a consequence, 
population PK modeling now predicts that with increasing the 
maintenance dose from 12 to 28 mg administered every 4 months, 
CSF C trough should increase from 5 to 12  ng/mL at steady state. The 
exposure -response (PK/PD) relationship between steady -state CSF 
Ctrough and CHOP -INTEND response continuously increases as a 
function of PK and is on an upward trajectory at concentrations 
consistent with the 12 mg maintenance dose (i.e., 5  ng/mL). It is 
predicted that additional clinical benefit (i.e., a 5 -point increase in 
CHOP -INTEND score) could be achieved by [CONTACT_102049] 12 ng/mL. Therefore, administration of this higher dose 
of nusinersen may lead to meaningful clinical benefit to patients. At 
this time, no dose -limiting toxicity has been identifie d with 
nusinersen. The PK modeling therefore suggests that it is unlikely 
that the higher doses of nusinersen would have a less favorable 
risk-benefit profile compared with standard dose nusinersen.  
The PK/PD relationship has thus far been demonstrated primarily in 
the infantile -onset SMA population. However, the same positive

12 PK/PD relationship is expected across SMA types and patient age 
groups because they share the same disease mechanism. This is 
supported by [CONTACT_102050]  232SM202, which showed a positive relationship between CSF 
Ctrough and total motor milestones scores in patients with infantile - 
and later -onset SMA who received 12  mg of nusinersen as 4  loading 
doses followed by [CONTACT_102048] 4 months.  
Using 12  ng/mL as the clinical CSF C trough target concentration and 
the predicted CSF PK profiles from 28  mg of nusinersen 
(maintenance doses every 4 months) as the reference dosing regimen, 
simulations were performed to evaluate additional dosing scenarios 
with higher doses and reduced loading -dose frequency. Additional 
evaluation of the maintenance dosing fr equency was not performed 
because previous modeling showed that a dosing frequency of every 
[ADDRESS_112929] maintained the CSF concentration achieved at  steady 
state.  
The assumption of PK linearity is supported by [CONTACT_102051], which showed nearly 
dose-proportional PK in the plasma and central nervous system 
tissues (target site of action) up to 15 mg (human equivalent dose of 
150 mg). Assuming PK linearity, PK simulations were performed in 
both infantile - and later -onset SMA populations after 2  years of 
treatment using a population PK model developed from patients 
across the age range of ≤  [ADDRESS_112930] 
recent PK modeling performed, relative to the approved 12 -mg label 
regimen (CSF C trough of approximately 5 ng/mL), 28  mg administered 
as 3 loading doses (biweekly) or 50  mg administered as 2 loading 
doses (biweekly), each followed by [CONTACT_102052] 28  mg 
every 4  months, were identified to achieve the desired CSF C trough 
(approximately 12  ng/mL) more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_101968]. Nusinersen 28  mg administered as 3  loading doses 
(biweekly) had a comparable predicted CSF maximum conc entration 
(Cmax) to the reference dosing regimen, whereas the 50 -mg dosing 
regimen surpassed the predicted C max from the reference dosing 
regimen. Moreover, the 28 -mg maintenance dosing regimen 
adequately maintained the higher CSF C trough target (approximately 
12 ng/mL) during the maintenance dose period. Toxicology studies in 
nonhuman primates evaluating the nonhuman primate equivalent of 
the [ADDRESS_112931] been conducted and support the safety 
of these doses in a clinical study  (see Section  3.3). Therefore, the 
28-mg dose (administered as 3  loading doses at biweekly intervals), 
50-mg dose (administered as 2  loading doses at biweekly intervals),

13 and 28 -mg maintenance dose were recommended for additional 
clinical evaluation.  
The single bolus dose in Part C is supported by [CONTACT_102053] a titration dosing regimen of a single loading dose 
(50 mg) followed by [CONTACT_102052] 28  mg every 4  months 
thereafter achieved and maintained the higher CSF C trough target 
concentration (approximately 12  ng/mL) in the representative 
populations for later -onset and infantile -onset SMA, respectively. 
The predicted exposures of the proposed titration dosing regimens are 
covered by [CONTACT_102054] p rimates.

18 Study Design:  This is a 3 -part (Parts A, B, and C) study in which participants will 
be followed for approximately [ADDRESS_112935] to enroll in a separate  long-term extension 
study (232SM302), pending study approval by [CONTACT_102056]. In regard to participants rolling 
over from Part  B, this will be done without unblinding the 
participant’s treatment group.  
Part A is an open -label safety evaluation. Six participants with 
later-onset SMA who are 2  to ≤ [ADDRESS_112936] completed the loading period (i.e.,  when the 
last participant has available safety data through the Day  64 visit), an 
independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will review the 
available safety data to recommend whether Part B can be initiated. If 
deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1034], additional participants may be 
enrolled in Part A to ensure sufficient data a re available for the safety 
evaluation prior to enrollment of participants in Part B. Details 
regarding the IDMC review of dat a may be found in the IDMC 
charter. Meanwhile, participants in Part  A will proceed to 
maintenance dosing without interruption. Note that the IDMC can 
recommend to stop the study based on the safety findings.  
Part B will consist of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], double -blind, active -controlled 
treatment period with either 2 or 4  loading doses of nusinersen (for 
the 50/28 -mg and Control Groups, respectively) administered 
intrathecally followed by [CONTACT_102057] 
4 months thereafter. Approximately 99  participants with infantile - or

Number of Planned 
Participants:  Including all 3  parts (A, B, and C), approximately 145  participants 
may be enrolled.  
Treatment Groups:  • Part A: Six participants with later -onset SMA will receive 
3 loading doses of 28  mg of nusinersen administered 
intrathecally on Days 1, 15, and 29. Maintenance doses of 
28 mg of nusinersen will be administered on Days  149 
and 269.  
• Part B:  
− Control Group: A total of 33 participants (25 with 
infantile -onset SMA and 8 with later -onset SMA) will 
receive 4 loading doses of 12  mg of nusinersen 
administered intrathecally (Days  1, 15, 29, and 64), 
followed by [CONTACT_102052] 12  mg on Days  183 
and 279 (and a sham procedure on Day  135).  
− 50/28 -mg Group: A total of 66 participants (50  with 
infantile -onset SMA and 16 with later -onset SMA) 
will receive 2  loading doses of 50  mg of nusinersen 
administered intrathecally (Days 1 and 15) and 2  sham 
procedures on Days 29 and 64, followed by 
[CONTACT_102052] 28  mg on Days  135 and 279 
(and a sham procedure on Day  183).  
• Part C: Up to approximately 40 participants (i.e., up to 
approximately 20 participants each in Cohorts 1 and 2) 
who have already been receiving treatment with 
nusinersen for at least 1  year prior to entry in this study

22 Sample Size 
Determination:  A total sample size of approximately 145  participants is planned for 
this study ( Table  9). The justification for the sample size for the 
infantile -onset SMA population in Part B is detailed below. The 
sample sizes for the remaining groups are not based on statistical 
considerations.  
A minimum of 6 participants with later -onset SMA will be enrolled 
in Part  A to characterize the safety, tolerability,  of a 
28/28  mg dose of nusinersen (28 -mg loading dose; 28 -mg 
maintenance dose). A total of 24 participants with later -onset SMA 
will be randomized to the Control Group and 50/28 -mg Group in 
Part B in a ratio of 1:2; this will allow the exploration of the safety, 
tolerability, , and efficacy of a 50/28 mg dose of 
nusinersen in this population. A total of up to approxim ately 
40 participants will be enrolled in Part  C (i.e., up to approximately 20 
participants each in Cohorts  1 and 2) to characterize the safety, 
tolerability,  of a 50/28 -mg dose of nusinersen in 
participants transitioning from maintenance dosing at the currently 
approved dose of 12  mg of nusinersen.  
For the infantile -onset SMA population in Part  B, a sample size of 
approximately 50  participants in the 50/28 -mg Group and a minimum 
of N=[ADDRESS_112948] approximately 99% 
power for the primary endpoint to detect an improvement of 
24 points on CHOP -INTEND and 23% survival rate benefit 
(compared to that observed in Study  CS3B participants receiving 
sham control) at Day  [ADDRESS_112949] at a 2 -sided 
significance level of 0.05. This power calculation is based on 
simul ations using data generated from a joint model of survival and 
functional change. The model used a difference of 24  points for the 
Day 183 change from baseline in CHOP -INTEND total score (50/28 -
mg Group – Study  CS3B Sham Control Group) and a population 
standard deviation of 8.8 for change from baseline.  
For Part B, the randomization will be stratified as follows:  
• For participants with infantile -onset SMA by [CONTACT_102058]: ≤  12 weeks and >  12 weeks (time from age at 
symptom onset to age at informed consent)  
• For participants with later -onset SMA by [CONTACT_102059]: <  6 years and ≥  6 years

23 Visit Schedule:  Participants will have up to 10 visits during the study. The number of 
visits for each part is as follows:  
• Part A: 8 to 9 visits  
• Part B: 9 to 10 visits  
• Part C: 5 to 6 visits  
Visits during Days 1, 15, and 29 of the loading periods of Parts  A and 
B, and Day 1 of the loading period of Part C should be performed ± 1 
day from the nominal visit day. Visits during Day  64 of the loading 
period of Parts A and B and the maintenance period of Parts  A, B, 
and C should be performed ± [ADDRESS_112950] to Day 1 (the date of first dose).  
Study assessments conducted at each visit are listed in the  Schedule 
of Activities ( Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, and Table  4). 
Duration of Study 
Participation:  Study duration for each participant will be as follows:

• Follow -up: 61 to 120 days  
Benefit -Risk Analysis:  Nusinersen (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_101969]) 12 mg has a positive benefit -risk profile, with 
more than 4  years of postmarketing experience and more than 
11,000  patients treated. The safety profile to date does not preclude 
study of higher doses in any population.  
Detailed information about the known and expected benefits and 
risks, reasonably expected AEs, and nonclinical toxicology studies 
supporting investigation of higher doses of nusinersen in the clinic 
are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure and informed consent 
form. A high -level summary of the benefits  and risks known during 
study design is provided here.  
Anticipating a potential enhancement of benefit with the dosing 
regimens proposed for Study 232SM203, substantiated by [CONTACT_31577]/PD 
modeling described in Section  3.1.2 , the safety of the loading period 
for Study 232SM203 is supported by a nonclinical study conducted 
in monkeys (Study  P058 -17-03). In this study, the 
no-observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL) was 15  mg (human 
equivalent dose of 150  mg). As such, dosing for Study 232SM203 
has a safety margin of at least 4.5 -fold for cumulative doses during 
the loading period and a 3 -fold margin for a single loading dose of 50 
mg.  
The safety of long -term exposure during the Study  232SM203 
maintenance period is supported by a 53 -week monkey study 
(Study  396443 -AS06). Monkeys received a cumulative dose of 3.9, 
13, and 52 mg at each dose level (0.3, 1, and 4 mg per dose, 
respectively) during the 52 -week treatment duration. The overall 
NOAEL was determined to be 4 mg. Tissue concentrations measured 
in monkey s from the 53 -week toxicology study at the NOAEL (4  mg) 
were compared to the estimated tissue concentrations in patients with 
SMA. T he exposure -based safety margin is at least 1.[ADDRESS_112951] (safety margins are higher for other 
tissues).

period may be extended for up to 10 days for individuals who cannot complete the Day 1 visit within 21 days of signing the IC F, as long as they continue to 
meet other eligibility criteria.  
2 Participants who meet the criteria for contraception use (see Section  11.5) will have a Day [ADDRESS_112954] 
result.  
4 A blood sample will be collected at Screening for SMN2  copy number for those participants without acceptable historical genetic documentation of SMN2  copy 
number. For all other participants, a blood sample will be collected during the study (preferably before or on Day 149) for a nalysis of both SMN1  copy number 
and deletion/mutation and SMN2  copy number by [CONTACT_2237].  
5 Eligibility based on scoliosis severity at Screening will be determined by [CONTACT_102060] X -ray results. The results of the central X -ray read will be 
documented and used for subsequent data analyses. For sites with local regulation on use of X -ray (e.g.,  [LOCATION_013]), the Investigator may assess scoliosis based 
on physical examination without imaging.  
6 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_101971], fluoroscopy, or similar techniques may be used for the LP procedure, if deemed necessary, but are not requ ired. Anesthesia (local or general) 
and/or sedation may be used for the LP procedure, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or  study center.  
7 Vital signs will include temperature, pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and pulse oximetry .  
8 Vital signs will be collected at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours ( ± 15 minutes) postdose and 24  hours ( ± 2 hours) postdose.  
9 These assessments may be performed up to 7  days prior to dosing/study visit.  
10 Videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_101972].  
11 On dosing visits, a neurological examination will be performed predose, at 3 and 6 hours (± 15 minutes) postdose, and at 24  hours ( ± 2 hours) postdose, or 
when anesthesia/sedation (if used) has worn off. Predose neurological examinations should be repeated when the assessment fal ls outside the protocol -specified 
window because of a delay in dosing.  
12 ECGs will be performed predose, at 5 hours (± 1 hour) postdose, and at 24 hours (± 2 hours) postdose on Days 1, 15, and 29; a t the Day 64 visit; at 5 hours (± 
1 hour) postdose on Days 149 and 269; and at Day 302/ET. Predose ECGs should be repeated when the assessment falls outside the protocol -specified window 
because of a delay in dosing. If a postdose ECG result is abnormal and clinically significant, a repeat E CG should be performed within 2  hours.  
13 Blood chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis samples will be analyzed by a central laboratory. These assessments may be perfor med up to 7 days prior to 
dosing/study visit, if necessary. Urine total protein will be analyzed by [CONTACT_12117]; however, if local analysis is not possible without a 24 -hour urine 
collection, then samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_12115] ( Appendix  B). Predose clinical safety laboratory assessments should be repeated when the 
assessment falls outside the protocol -specified window because of a delay in dosing.  
14 Coagulation testing will be conducted locally at Screening and predose (within 7  days prior to dosing) at each dosing visit; results must be reviewed prior to 
dosing. Predose coagulation parameters should be repeated when the assessment falls outside the protocol -specified window because of a delay in dosing.  
15 A safety follow -up telephone call will be made 2  weeks (± 3  days) after the Day  [ADDRESS_112955] be conducted during the Screening period . The second assessment 
may be conducted either during the Screening period or at Day 1 predose. If both baseline assessments are conducted during the Screening period, the 
assessments do not need to be repeated on Day 1.  
21 During the loading period, the efficacy assessments will be performed on Day 29 predose only. The Day 29 efficacy assessments  may be performed up to 
3 days prior to dosing, if necessary.  
22 CGIC will be collected on Days 29, 64, and 149 (predose), and Day  302. 
23 Assessments will be performed on Day  1, Day 149, and at Day 302/ET.  
24 Ventilator use will be collected at every study visit (see Section  9.1.14 ).

Protocol 232SM203, Version [ADDRESS_112957] visit on Day 302. Participants who meet the criteria for contraception use (see 
Section  11.5) will have a Day [ADDRESS_112958] 120  days after  the final dose. For 
participants who meet the criteria for contraception use and enroll into the long -term extension study (232SM302) at the Day [ADDRESS_112959] 
result.  
4 For all participants, a blood sample will be collected during the study to evaluate SMN1 status (copy number, deletion, and mutation where necessary to 
confirm 5q SMA) and SMN2  copy number by [CONTACT_2237]. For participants without acceptable documentation of these genetic testing results bef ore 
Screening, a blood sample must be collected during the Screening period to determine eligibility (preferably for analysis by [CONTACT_102061], if needed). For participants with documentation of these genetic testing resu lts before Screening or whose 
sample was analyzed locally during the Screening period (with documentation of these genetic testing results), a blood sample  will be collected (preferably at 
Screening or by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_112960] be collected by [CONTACT_48657] 135 visit) for confirm atory testing through the central laboratory.  
5 Eligibility based on scoliosis severity at Screening will be determined by [CONTACT_102060] X -ray results. Results of the central X -ray read will be 
documented and used for subsequent data analyses. For sites with local regulation on use of X -ray (e.g ., [LOCATION_013]), the Investigator may assess scoliosis based 
on physical examination without imaging.  
6 LP opening pressure will only be evaluated for participants with later -onset SMA. Only measure LP opening pressure and assess CSF local laboratory sample 
on Days  1, 15, and 279 to avoid potential unblinding.  
7 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_101971], fluoroscopy, or similar techniques may be used for the LP procedure, if deemed necessary, but are not requ ired. Local anesthesia and/or 
sedation may be used for the LP procedure in participants with infantile -onset SMA, and anesthesia (l ocal or general) and/or sedation may be used for the LP 
procedure in participants with later -onset SMA, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or study center. If anesthesia and/or sedation is used for the LP 
procedure for an individual participant, in order to maintain the blind, that participant will receive equivalent anesthesia and/or sedation (according to 
institutional procedures) for all of the sham procedures and LP injections. For participants with infantile -onset SMA, LP injections/sham procedu res may not 
occur within [ADDRESS_112961] 24 hours after study treatment administration on Days 1 and 15; inpatient  stays at other visits may occur based 
on the Investigator’s discretion. If the primary reason for the inpatient stay is due to an AE or SAE, reporting requirements per Section  11.[ADDRESS_112962] be followed.  
9 Vital signs will include temperature, pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and pulse oximetry .  
10 On Days 1 and 15, postdose v ital signs will be collected at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours (± 15 minutes) postdose and at 24 hours (± 2 hours) postdose. On Days  29, 64, 
135, 183, and 279, postdose vital signs will be collected at 1 hour (± 30 minutes) and 6 hours (± 1 hour) postdose.  
[ADDRESS_112963], and arm circumference will be measured in participants with infantile -onset SMA, and height or body length (for participants who are 
not able to stand independently) and ulnar length will be measured in participations with later -onset SMA. The same measurement (height or body length) 
should be evaluated at all study visits wherever possible.  
12 These assessments may be performed up to 7  days prior to dosing.  
13 Videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_101972].  
14 HINE Sections  1 and 3 will be administered to participants with infantile -onset SMA, and a neurological examination will be performed in participants with 
later-onset SMA. A neurological examination will be performed at Screening; predose, at 3 and 6 hours (± 15 minutes ) postdose, and at 24  hours (± 2  hours)

and 279; and at Day 302/ET. Predose neurological examinations should be repeated when the assessmen t falls outside the protocol -specified window because 
of a delay in dosing.  
15 ECGs will be performed predose, at 5 hours (± 1 hour) postdose, and at 24 hours (± 2 hours) postdose on Days 1 and 15; predos e and at 5 hours (± 1 hour) 
postdose on Days 29 and 64; at 5 hours (± 1 hour) postdose on Days 135, 183, and 279; and at Day 302/ET . Predose ECGs should be repeated when the 
assessment falls outside the protocol -specified window because of a delay in dosing. If a postdose ECG result is abnormal and clinically significant, a repeat 
ECG should be performed within 2 hours later.  
16 Blood chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis samples will be analyzed by a central laboratory. For the Screening visit only, a  local laboratory may be used 
instead for analysis, if needed, for the timely treatment of the participant at the discretion of the  Investigator. If a local laboratory is used for the Screening visit, 
the samples should be collected on Day 1 for central laboratory evaluation (even if within 7 days of Screening). These assess ments may be performed up to 7 
days prior to dosing/study vis it, if necessary. Urine total protein will be analyzed by [CONTACT_12117] ; however, if local analysis is not possible without a 24 -
hour urine collection, then samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_12115].  (Appendix  B). Predose clinical safety laboratory assessments should be repeated 
when the assessment falls outside the protocol -specified window because of a delay in dosing. When the safety laboratory sample analysis is at risk due to 
logistical difficulties or issue s with access to the central laboratory (e.g., due to COVID -19–related disruptions or humanitarian emergencies), these samples 
may be analyzed by [CONTACT_12082]. Any use of a local laboratory under these circumstances must be approved by [CONTACT_102062].  
17 Coagulation testing will be conducted locally at Screening and predose (within 7  days prior to dosing) at each dosing visit; results should be reviewed prior to 
dosing. Predose coagulation parameters should be repeated when the assessment falls outside the protocol -specified window because of a delay in dosing.

second assessment may be conducted either during the Screening period or at Day 1 predose. If both baseline as sessments are conducted during the Screening 
period, they should be completed on different days and the assessments do not need to be repeated on Day 1.  
23 During the loading period, the efficacy assessments will be performed on Days  29 and 64 predose only. The Day 29 efficacy assessments may be performed up 
to 3 days prior to dosing, if necessary. The Day 64 efficacy assessments may be performed up to 7 days prior to dosing, if ne cessary.  
 
 
 
  
25 CGIC will be assessed on Days 29, 64, and 183 (predose), and Day  302. 
26 PedsQL and ACEND will be assessed only in participants with later -onset SMA. Assessments will be performed on Day  1, Day 183, and at Day 302/ET.  
27 PASA will be assessed only on Days 64 and 183.  
28 Ventilator use will be collected at every study visit (see Section  9.1.14 ).

visit in Study 232SM203.  
3 Day 1 should be 4 months ± 14 days after the participant’s most recent nusinersen maintenance dose of [ADDRESS_112974] 
result.  
5 For all participants, a blood sample will be collected to evaluate SMN1  status  (copy number, deletion, and mutation where necessary to confirm 5q SMA) and 
SMN2  copy number by [CONTACT_2237]. For participants without acceptable documentation of these genetic testing results bef ore Screening, a blood 
sample must be collected during the Screening period to determine eligibility (preferably for analysis by t he central laboratory but may be determined by [CONTACT_102063], if needed). For participants with documentation of genetic testing results before Screening or w hose sample was analyzed locally 
during the Screening period (with documentation of these genetic testing results), a blood sample will be collected (preferab ly at Screening but must be 
collected by [CONTACT_48657] 121 visit) for confirmatory testing through the c entral laboratory.  
6 Eligibility based on scoliosis severity at Screening will be determined by [CONTACT_102060] X -ray results. Results of the central X -ray read will be 
documented and used for subsequent data analyses. For sites with local regulation on use of X -ray (e. g., [LOCATION_013]), the Investigator may assess scoliosis based 
on physical examination without imaging.  
7 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_101971], fluoroscopy, or similar techniques may be used for the LP procedure, if deemed necessary, but is not requi red. Local anesthesia and/or 
sedation may be used for the LP procedure in participants < 2 years of age, and anesthesia (local or general) and/or sedation may be used for the LP procedure 
in participants ≥ 2 years of age, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or study center. LP injections may not occur within 72  hours after an immunization.  
8 Vital signs will include temperature, pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and pulse oximetry .  
9 On Day 1, postdose v ital signs will be collected at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours (± 15  minutes) postdose and at 24  hours (± 2  hours) postdose. On Days 121 and 241, 
postdose vital signs will be collected at 1 hour (± 30 minutes) and 6 hours (± 1 hour) postdose.  
[ADDRESS_112975], and arm circumference will be measured in participants with infantile -onset SMA, and height or body length (for participants who are 
not able to stand independently) and ulnar length will be measured in participants with later -onset SMA. The same measurement (height or body length) should 
be evaluated at all study visits whenever possible.  
11 These assessments may be performed up to 7  days prior to dosing.  
12 Videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_101972].  
13 A neurological examination will be performed at Screening; predose, at 3  and 6  hours (±  15 minutes) postdose, and at 24  hours (± 2  hours) postdose or when 
anesthesia/sedation (if used) has worn off on Day 1; predose and at 1 and 3 hours ( ± 30 minutes) postdose on Days 121 and 241; and at Day 302/ET. Predose 
neurological examinations should be repeated when the assessment falls outside the protocol -specified window because of a delay in dosing.  
14 ECGs will be performed predose, at 5 hours (± 1 hour) postdose, and at 24 hours (± 2 hours) postdose on Day 1; at 5 hours (± 1 hour) postdose on Days 121 
and 241; and at Day 302/ET. Predose ECGs should be repeated when the assessment falls outside the prot ocol-specified window because of a delay in dosing. 
If a postdose ECG result is abnormal and clinically significant, a repeat ECG should be performed within 2 hours.  
15 Blood chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis samples will be analyzed by a central laboratory. For the Screening visit only, a local laboratory may be used 
instead for analysis if needed for the timely treatment of the participant at the discretion of the Investigator. If a local laboratory is used for the Screening visit, 
the samples sh ould be collected on Day 1 for central laboratory evaluation (even if within 7 days of Screening). These assessments may be p erformed up to 7 
days prior to dosing/study visit, if necessary. Urine total protein will be analyzed by [CONTACT_102065]; how ever, if local analysis is not possible without a 
24-hour urine collection, then samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_12115] ( Appendix  B). Predose clinical safety laboratory assessments should be repeated 
when the assessment falls outside the protocol -specified window because of a delay in dosing.  
16 Coagulation testing will be conducted locally at Screening and predose (within 7  days prior to dosing) at each dosing visit; results should be reviewed prior to 
dosing. Predose coagulation parameters should be repeated when the assessment falls outside the protocol -specified window because of a delay in dosing.

51 3. INTRODUCTION  
Nusinersen is an ASO administered intrathecally via LP; it increases SMN expression and 
significantly improves motor function in patients with SMA. Nusinersen was approved for the 
treatment of SMA under the tradename [CONTACT_84899][INVESTIGATOR_101969] ™ in the US, EU, and [ADDRESS_112979] dose, and maintenance doses every  4 months thereafter. PK and PD 
analyses indicate that nusinersen drug exposure higher than that achieved with 12  mg in patients 
with SMA may produce an even greater benefit in motor function. Additionally, PK modeling 
and simulations identified dosing regimens that achieve higher drug exposure more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. 
Therefore, this study is being conducted to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and  of 
a 50/28 -mg dose of nusinersen (50 -mg loading dose/28 -mg maintenance dose) and a dosing 
regimen targe ted to achieve higher drug exposure more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. This study will be conducted in 
participants with genetically confirmed SMA.  
Part A of the study will evaluate the safety of a higher loading dose and maintenance dosing 
regimen (28 -mg loading/28 -mg maintenance) than the approved regimen (12 -mg loading/12 -mg 
maintenance) prior to exposing participants to the target higher dosing re gimen (50 -mg 
loading/28 -mg maintenance) in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_101977].  
In Part B, in order to  evaluate the proposed higher dosing regimen, an active -controlled design is 
being used, with participants randomized either to the investigational dosing regimen (50 -mg 
loading/28 -mg maintenance) or to the currently approved dosing regimen (12 -mg loading/ 12-mg 
maintenance). In order to supplement the number of participants available for the analysis in 
Part B of this study, historical data from the existing data set for Study  CS3B, a Phase  3 efficacy 
and safety study of nusinersen in participants with infa ntile-onset SMA, may be borrowed to 
augment the control arm (see Section  12.4 for details). Enrollment in Part  B will begin after 
[ADDRESS_112980] completed the loading period (i.e., when the last participant reaches 
the Day  64 visit) and after an IDMC has reviewed the available safety data to recommend 
whether Part  B can be initiated. If deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1034], additional participants may 
be enrolled in Part A to ensure sufficient data are available for the safety evaluation prior to 
enrollment of participants in Part B. Details regarding the IDMC review of data may be found in 
the IDMC charter. Note that the IDM C can recommend to stop the study based on the safety 
findings.  
Part C of the study will allow safety evaluation of transitioning participants who are on the 
currently approved dose of nusinersen ([ADDRESS_112981] 1  year after the initiation 
of treatment) to the proposed higher dosing regimen via the administration of a single bolus dose

52 of 50  mg of nusinersen (which should be administered 4  months  ± [ADDRESS_112982] recent 
maintenance dose of 12  mg), with maintenance dosing at [ADDRESS_112983] participants will be enrolled in Part  C. Note that the IDMC can recommend to 
stop the study based on the safety fi ndings.  
3.1.1.  Rationale for Study Population  
Part A will be conducted in participants with later -onset SMA who are 2 to ≤  15 years of age, 
inclusive, for the purpose of evaluating AEs.  
Part B will include participants with both infantile -onset SMA (≤  7 months of age) and 
later-onset SMA (2 to <  10 years of age). The infantile -onset SMA population was selected as 
the main population to evaluate efficacy based on the following considerations:  
• The results of  modeling and simulations showed that an improvement in 
CHOP -INTEND, which is administered in participants with infantile -onset SMA, 
may be possible with a higher dose.  
• Data from Studies  CS3B and CS4 show that improvement in efficacy occurs more 
quickly in younger participants with shorter disease duration.  
Therefore, the infantile -onset SMA population may be more sensitive to a higher dose, and thus 
efficacy in Part  B can be assessed at an earlier timepoint compared to participants with 
later-onset SMA. In addition, the choice of the infantile -onset SMA population allows the 
opportunity to leverage data from Study  CS3B, which used the approved dose of [ADDRESS_112984] 1  year prior to entry in this study across participants of all ages (Cohort 1) and participants 
≥ 18 years of age (Cohort 2). Participants should be receiving nusinersen as per local label and 
have no missed doses in the last year prior to Screening. This part is designed to evaluate the 
safety of transitioning participants from the currently approved dos ing regimen to the higher 
dosing regimen in a representa tive patient population.  
3.1.2.  Rationale for Dosing Regimen  
The clinical PK, safety, and efficacy of nusinersen have been evaluated in a number of patient 
populations (infantile -onset [SMA symptom onset ≤  6 months (≤  180 days) of age], later -onset 
[SMA symptom onset >  6 months (>  180 days) of age], and presymptomatic). The approved 
dosing regimen of nusinersen is [ADDRESS_112985] dose, and maintenance doses every 4  months 
thereafter . In the original development program, 2  differe nt dosing regimens (4  loading doses 
followed by [CONTACT_102048] 4  months and 3  loading doses followed by [CONTACT_102066] 6 months) were evaluated in sham -controlled studies. Results from these studies,

53 population PK and exposure -response modeling, and nonhuman primate safety studies were used 
as the basis for selecting dosing regimens in this study.  
An exploratory exposure -response analysis performed in participants with infantile -onset SMA 
(Study CS3A, n = 20, age 38  days to 8  months) showed a statistically significant positive 
correlation between nusinersen CSF exposure and motor function (e.g.,  CHOP -INTEND scores).  
Previous PK modeling predicted that the median concentration of nusinersen within the CSF 
immediately prior to the administration of the subsequent maintenance dose (i.e., C trough) would 
be approximately 10 ng/mL at steady state with the label -approved maintenance dosing regimen 
(i.e., 12 mg administered every 4 months) and approximately 20 ng/mL at steady state with the 
proposed maintenance dosing regimen for Study 232SM203 (i.e.,  28 mg administered every 
4 months). This model was subsequently updated to i nclude additional data from 
Studies  232SM201 and CS11 not previously modeled, resulting in an adjustment of CSF C trough 
predictions in all patient populations, which are still consistent with the prior predictions. As a 
consequence, population PK modeling now predicts that with increasing the maintenance dose 
from 12 to 28 mg administered every 4 months, CSF C trough should increase from 5 to 12  ng/mL 
at steady state. The exposure -response (PK/PD) relationship between steady -state CSF C trough 
and CHOP -INTEND  response continuously increases as a function of PK and is on an upward 
trajectory at concentrations consistent with the 12 mg maintenance dose (i.e., 5  ng/mL). It is 
predicted that additional clinical benefit (i.e., a 5 -point increase in CHOP -INTEND score) could 
be achieved by [CONTACT_102067] 12 ng/mL. Therefore, administration of this higher 
dose of nusinersen may lead to meaningful clinical benefit to patients. At this time, no 
dose-limiting toxicity has been identified with nusinersen. The PK modeling therefore suggests 
that it is unlikely that the higher doses of nusinersen would have a less favorable risk -benefit 
profile compared with standard dose nusinersen.  
The PK/PD relationship has thus far been demonstrated primarily in the infantile -onset SMA 
population. However, the same positive PK/PD relationship is expected across SMA types and 
patient age groups because they share the same disease mechanism. This is supported by [CONTACT_102068] 232SM202, which showed a positive relationship 
between CSF C trough and total motor milestones scores in participants with infantile - and 
later-onset SMA who received 12  mg of nusinersen as 4 load ing doses followed by [CONTACT_102066] 4  months.  
Using 12  ng/mL as the clinical CSF C trough target concentration and the predicted CSF PK 
profiles from 28  mg of nusinersen (maintenance doses every 4  months) as the reference dosing 
regimen, simulations were performed to evaluate additional dosing scenarios with higher doses 
and reduced loading -dose frequency. Additional evaluation of the maintenance dosing frequency 
was not performed because previous modeling showed that a dosing frequency of every 
[ADDRESS_112986] maintained the CSF concentration achieved at  steady state.  
The assumption of PK linearity is supported by [CONTACT_102069], which showed nearly dose -proportional PK in the plasma and CNS tissues (target site 
of action) up to 15 mg (human equivalent dose of 150 mg). Assuming PK linearity, PK 
simulations were performed in both infantile - and later -onset SMA populations after 2  years of

54 treatment using a population PK model developed from patients across the age range of 
≤ [ADDRESS_112987] recent PK modeling performed, relative to the 
approved 12 -mg label  regimen (CSF C trough of approximately 5 ng/mL), 28  mg administered as 
3 loading doses (biweekly) or 50  mg administered as 2  loading doses (biweekly), each followed 
by [CONTACT_102052] 28  mg every 4  months, were identified to achieve the desired CSF 
Ctrough (approximately 12  ng/mL) more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_101978]. Nusinersen 
28 mg administered as 3  loading doses (biweekly) had a comparable predicted CSF C max to the 
reference dosing regimen, whereas the 50 -mg dosing regimen surpassed the predicted C max from 
the reference dosing regimen. Moreover, the 28 -mg maintenance dosing regimen adequately 
maintained the higher CSF C trough target (approximately 12 ng/mL) during the maintenance dose 
period. Toxicology studies in nonhuman primates evaluating the nonhuman primate equivalent 
of the [ADDRESS_112988] been conducted and support the safety of these doses in a 
clinical study (see Section  3.3). Therefore, the 28 -mg dose (administered as 3  loading doses at 
biweekly intervals), 50 -mg dose (administered as 2  loading doses at biweekly intervals), and 
28-mg maintenance dose were recommended for additional clinical evaluation.  
The single bolus dose in Part C is supported by [CONTACT_102070] a titration dosing 
regimen of a single loading dose (50  mg) followed by [CONTACT_102052] 28  mg every 
4 months thereafter achieved and maintained the higher CSF C trough target concentration 
(approximately 12  ng/mL) in the representative populations for later -onset and infantile -onset 
SMA, respectively. The predicted exposures of the proposed titration dosing regimens are 
covered by [CONTACT_102054] p rimates.  
3.2. Background  
3.2.1.  Overview of SMA  
SMA is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disease characterized by [CONTACT_102071][INVESTIGATOR_1831], resulting in atrophy of the voluntary 
muscles of the limbs and trunk. With an incidence of 8.[ADDRESS_112989] common monogenetic cause of infant mortality and a major cause of childhood morbidity 
due to weakness in the US [Arkblad 2009 ; Jedrzejowska 2010 ]. Historically, the natural history 
of SMA includes [ADDRESS_112990] few months of life; 
these children are never able to sit or w alk and usually die from respi[INVESTIGATOR_101979] [ADDRESS_112991] a variable copy number of the SMN2  (0 to 8  copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) [Wirth 2006 ]. The number of 
SMN2  copi[INVESTIGATOR_101980] -length SMN expressed in patients with SMA (10% 
to 40% of normal SMN levels) correlate with SMA disease severity; thus, SMN2  is a key 
modifier of disease phenotype [Coovert 1997 ; Feldkötter 2002 ; Lefebvre 1997 ; Prior 2004 ].

is limited to supportive care, focused on respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], nutritional support, and 
management of resulting musculotendinous contractures and neuromuscular scoliosis through 
bracing, physical therapy, and surgery, with specific guidelines according to age of SMA onset 
[Finkel 2017 ; Mercuri 2018 ]. 
A gene transfer agent, Zolgensma®, an adeno -associated virus vector expressing a SMN1  
delivered intravenously, was approved in the US in 2019 and Japan in 2020 for the treatment of 
SMA Type 1 in patients younger than 2  years of age, and in the EU in May 2020 for the 
treatment of patients with 5q SMA with dosing guidance for body weight up to 21 kg. Risdiplam 
(Evrysdi™, formerly RG7916) is an oral SMN2 -directed splicing modifier indicated for the 
treatment of SMA in patients ≥ [ADDRESS_112992] 5 other markets.  
3.2.3.  Profile of Previous Experience With Nusinersen  
Nusinersen is an ASO administered intrathecally via LP and increases SMN expression and 
significantly improves motor function in patients with SMA.  
The primary support for the efficacy of nusinersen in the treatment of SMA derives from 
sham -controlled studies in participants with infantile -onset SMA (primarily Type I SMA) and 
later-onset SMA (may include Type II and Type III SMA). Results from uncontr olled studies in 
genetically diagnosed, presymptomatic infants, participants with infantile -onset SMA, and 
participants with later -onset SMA are highly supportive of the results of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_101983] -controlled efficacy studies and provide evidence of long -term benefit. Nusinersen has been 
administered to [ADDRESS_112993] approved for the treatment of SMA under the tradename [CONTACT_84899][INVESTIGATOR_101969] ™ in the 
US on 23 December 2016 (New Drug Application 209531). Subsequently, it was approved in the 
EU (5q SMA) [May 2017] and other major markets (5q SMA, infantile SMA, and all other 
SMAs).  
As of December 2020, more than 11,[ADDRESS_112994] been treated with nusinersen 
worldwide, in the postmarketing setting, expanded access programs, and clinical trials.

56 3.3. Benefit -Risk Assessment  
Nusinersen (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_101969]) 12 mg has a positive benefit -risk profile, with more than 4  years of 
postmarketing experience and more than 11,000  patients treated. The safety profile to date does 
not preclude study of higher doses in any population.  
Detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks, reasonably expected AEs, 
and nonclinical toxicology studies supporting investigation of higher doses of nusinersen in the 
clinic are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure and ICF. A hi gh-level summary of the benefits 
and risks known during study design is provided here.  
Anticipating a potential enhancement of benefit with the dosing regimens proposed for 
Study  232SM203, substantiated by [CONTACT_31577]/PD modeling described in Section  3.1.2 , the safety of the 
loading period for Study 232SM203 is supported by a nonclinical study conducted in monkeys 
(Study  P058 -17-03). In this study, the NOAEL was 15  mg (human equivalent dose of 150  mg). 
As such, dosing for Study 232SM203 has a safety margin of at least 4.5 -fold for cumulative 
doses during the loading period and a 3 -fold margin for a single loading dose of 50 mg.  
The safety of long -term exposure during the Study 232SM203 maintenance period is supported 
by a 53 -week monkey study (Study  396443 -AS06). Monkeys received a cumulative dose of 3.9, 
13, and 52 mg at each dose level (0.3, 1, and 4 mg per dose, respectively) during the 52 -week 
treatment duration. The overall NOAEL was determined to be 4 mg. Tissue concentrations 
measured in monkey s from the 53 -week toxicology study at the NOAEL (4  mg) were compared 
to the estimated tissue concentrations in patients with SMA. T he exposure -based safety margin is 
at least 1.[ADDRESS_112995] (safety margins are higher for other tissues).

separate long -term extension study (232SM302), pending study approval by [CONTACT_102072]. In regard to p articipants rolling over from Part  B, this 
will be done without unblinding t he participant’s treatment group.  
Participants will be followed for approximately 323 to 420  days in Parts  A, B, and C.  
The study consists of an open -label safety evaluation of a regimen consisting of nusinersen 
administered intrathecally at loading doses of 28  mg followed by [CONTACT_102073] 28  mg 
(Part A); a pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], double -blind, active -controlled portion (Part B) in which participants will be 
randomized to 1 of 2 regimens (loading doses of nusinersen at 50  mg followed by [CONTACT_102074] 28  mg [50/28 -mg regimen] or loading and maintenance dosing at 12  mg [control 
dosing regimen]); and a third open -label portion  (Part C) in which participants who have already 
been treated with nusinersen for at least 1  year prior to entry in this study will receive a single 
50-mg bolus of nusinersen followed by [CONTACT_102073] 28  mg.  
Part A will enroll a minimum of 6 participants with later -onset SMA, from 2 to ≤  15 years of 
age, inclusive, at the signing of informed consent. Participants will receive 3 loading doses of 
28 mg (Days  1, 15, and 29) followed by 2 maintenance doses of 28  mg (Days 149 and 269). 
Participants will remain at the clinic for at least [ADDRESS_112998] completed the loading period (i.e., when the last participant has 
available safety data through the Day 64 visit), an IDMC will review the available safety data to 
recommend whether Part B can be initiated. If deemed necessary by [CONTACT_19457], additional 
participants may be enrolled in Part A to ensure sufficient data are available for the IDMC 
review prior to enrollment of participants in Part B. Details regarding the IDMC review of data 
may be found in the IDMC charter. Meanwhile,  participants in Part  A will proceed to 
maintenance dosing without interruption. Note that the IDMC can recommend to stop the study 
based on the safety findings.  
Part B will consist of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], double -blind, active -controlled treatment period with either 2 or 
4 loading doses of nusinersen (for the 50/28 -mg Group and Control Group, respectively)

in a 1:2  ratio to receive either the currently approved dosing regimen of 4 loading doses of 12  mg 
of nusinersen administered intrathecally (Days  1, 15, 29, and 64) followed by 2  maintenance 
doses of 12  mg on Days  183 and 279 (Control Group) or 2 loading doses of 50  mg of nusinersen 
administered intrathecally (Days 1 and 15) followed by 2  maintenance doses of 28  mg on 
Days  135 and 279 (50/28 -mg Group). In order t o maintain blinding, 1  sham procedure will be 
administered in the Control Group on Day  135 and 3 sham procedures will be administered in 
the 50/[ADDRESS_112999] 24 hours after study treatment 
administration on Days 1 and 15; inpatient stays at other visits may occur based on the 
Invest igator’s discretion. If the primary reason for the inpatient stay is due to an AE or SAE, 
reporting requirements per Section  11.[ADDRESS_113000] be followed.  
Randomization in Part  B will be performed using IRT. For Part  B, the randomization will be 
stratified as follows:  
• For participants with infantile -onset SMA by [CONTACT_102075]: ≤  12 weeks and 
> 12 weeks (time from age at symptom onset to age at informed consent)  
• For participants with later -onset SMA by [CONTACT_102076]: <  6 years and

• For participants with a Cobb’s angle between 33.0° and 40.0°, inclusive, discussion 
with the Medical Monitor must occur before determining eligibility.  
6.3. Screening, Retesting, and Screen Failures  
6.3.1.  Screening  
Once informed consent is obtained, screening assessments can occur. At this time, a unique 
identification number is assigned that will be used on study -related documents pertaining to the 
participant. Any identification numbers that are assigned will not b e reused even if the 
Protocol 232SM203, Version [ADDRESS_113020] an out -of-range result may be retested 1  time 
only at the discretion of the Investigator within the Screening process, without the need for a 
repeat full Screening. The Screening period may be extended for up to 10  days for individuals 
who cannot complete the Day  1 Visit within 21  days of signing the ICF, as long as they continue 
to meet other eligibility criteria.  
Participants who fail Screening (see Section  6.3.3 ) may be rescreened once at the discretion of 
the Investigator. Participants who are rescreened will be assigned a new identification number.  
6.3.3.  Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as participants who sign the ICF but are not subsequently dosed or 
randomized . If a participant is considered a screen failure, the reasons for exclusion must be 
documented in the participant’s source documents and on the screening log. A minimal set of 
screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure 
participants to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials publishing requirements and 
to respond to queries from regulatory authori ties. Minimal information includes demography, 
screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any SAEs.

80 administered 4  months ±  [ADDRESS_113022] recent maintenance dose of 12  mg), 
followed by 2  maintenance doses of 28  mg of nusinersen on Days  121 and 241.  
If a loading dose is delayed or missed (as per the Schedule of Activities), a protocol deviation 
should be recorded and nusinersen should be administered as soon as possible, with at least 
[ADDRESS_113023] or appropriately qualified staff. Study 
treatment is to be dispensed only to participants enrolled in this study. Once study treatment is 
prepared for a participant, it can be administered only to that  participant. Study treatment is for 
1-time use only; do not use any study treatment remaining in the vial for another participant.  
7.3.1.  Nusinersen  
Nusinersen will be supplied as specified in the DHA. The study treatment is supplied as a 
formulation that contains nusinersen, sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, sodium phosphate 
dibasic anhydrous, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride dihydrate, and 
magnesium chloride hexahydrate in wat er for injection, adjusted, if necessary, to a target pH of 
7.2 with hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide during compounding. Further details on drug 
preparation and administration may be found in the D HA. 
The contents of the nusinersen label will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory 
requirements. At a minimum, the label will include a study reference code, study treatment 
identifier, quantity of dosage units, lot number, and other pertinent infor mation in accordance 
with local law. The expi[INVESTIGATOR_101990] -by [CONTACT_102083], and printable assignment 
reports are available to site staff. Study treatment should not be used after the expi[INVESTIGATOR_101990] -by 
[CONTACT_568].

CONFIDENTIAL  
The information contained herein may not be used, disclosed, or published without the written consent of 
Biogen  MA Inc.  
81 [IP_ADDRESS].  Preparation  
The individual preparing nusinersen should carefully review the instructions provided in the 
DHA.  
If the packaging is damaged, or if there is anything unusual about the appearance or attributes of 
the vial(s) or study treatment, do not use the study treatment. The vial(s) in question should be 
saved at the study site and the problem immediately reporte d to the Sponsor (or designee).  
Contact [CONTACT_102084] a problem is provided in the Study Reference Guide.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Storage  
Study treatment must be stored in a secure location.  
Nusinersen is to be protected from light and is to be stored at 2 C to 8C, in a locked refrigerator 
with limited access. For the most up-to-date storage requirements, follow the instructions 
provided in the DHA.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Handling and Disposal  
The Investigator must return all used and unused vials of nusinersen as instructed by [CONTACT_1034] 
(or designee) unless approved for onsite destruction.  
If any used nusinersen supplies are to be destroyed at the study site, the institution or appropriate 
site staff must obtain prior approval from the Sponsor (or designee), by [CONTACT_1541], in writing, the 
destruction policy or details of the method of destruc tion. After such destruction, the Sponsor (or 
designee) must be notified, in writing, of the details of the study treatment destroyed (e.g., lot or 
kit numbers, quantities), the date of destruction, and proof of destruction.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Accountability  
Accountability for study treatment is the responsibility of the Investigator. The study site must 
maintain accurate records demonstrating dates and amount of study treatment received, to whom 
dispensed (participant -by-participant accounting), and accounts of any study treatment 
accidentally or deliberately destroyed or lost.  
Unless otherwise notified, all vials, both used and unused, must be saved for study treatment 
accountability. Ongoing reconciliation must be made between the amount of nusinersen and, if 
applicable, diluent (artificial CSF), supplied, dispensed, and subseq uently destroyed or returned 
to the Sponsor (or designee). A written explanation must be provided for any discrepancies.  
Please refer to the DHA for additional details and instructions.  
7.4. Blinding Procedures  
Part B is the only study part that will be blinded; Parts  A and C will be open -label.  
Protocol 232SM203, Version 7 
Escalating Dose and Randomized, Controlled Study of Nusinersen in SMA  
CONFIDENTIAL  
The information contained herein may not be used, disclosed, or published without the written consent of 
Biogen  MA Inc.  
82 To maintain the study blind in Part  B, the procedure will be performed in a dedicated room by 
[CONTACT_102085]; this will not include any of 
the key study site personnel (i.e., the Investigator, Study Coordinator, or Outcomes Assessors). 
The key study site personnel and the parent/guardians (if applicable) will not be present during 
the procedure to ensure blinding.  
The sham procedure will consist of a small needle prick on the lower back at the location where 
the LP injection is normally made. The needle will break the skin, but no LP injection or needle 
insertion will occur. The site of the needle prick will be cove red in the same manner as that of 
the LP injection, thus simulating the appearance of an LP injection. If anesthesia and/or sedation 
is used for the LP procedure for an individual participant, in order to maintain the blind, that 
participant will receive e quivalent anesthesia and/or sedation (according to institutional 
procedures) for all of the sham procedures and LP injections. Participants who receive the sham 
procedure will be kept in the procedure room for the same amount of time as that for participan ts 
who were administered study treatment, thus simulating the time period of a study treatment 
administration procedure.  
Study treatment and sham kits will be packaged in a blinded fashion. Blinded kits for sham 
procedures will contain artificial CSF that will not be injected but will be used to simulate CSF 
samples for a participant who has undergone sham procedure at a spe cific visit,  as described in 
the DHA . 
At the end of the study, if unblinding of Part  B will not jeopardize the results of ongoing related 
studies, the Sponsor will provide the randomization codes to Investigators, who then can inform 
their participants about the treatment received.  
In the event of a medical emergency that requires unblinding of a participant’s treatment 
assignment, refer to Section  11.4.3 . 
7.5. Compliance  
Study treatment will be administered by [CONTACT_7893].  
7.6. Concomitant Therapy and Procedures  
7.6.1.  Concomitant Therapy  
A concomitant therapy is any drug or substance administered between Screening and the final 
study visit/telephone call.  
Participants should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_102086], including nonprescription drugs and herbal preparations.

CONFIDENTIAL  
The information contained herein may not be used, disclosed, or published without the written consent of 
Biogen  MA Inc.  
83 [IP_ADDRESS].  Allowed Concomitant Therapy  
Throughout the study, Investigators or designated licensed physicians involved in the study may 
prescribe concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101991].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Disallowed Concomitant Therapy  
Participants are prohibited from receiving other experimental or approved agents for the 
treatment of SMA, including gene therapy, SMN2 -splicing modifier, biological agent, or device, 
during the study. This includes marketed agents at experimental doses that are being tested for 
the treatment of SMA (oral albuterol/salbutamol, riluzole, carnitine, sodium phenylbutyrate, 
valproate, hydroxy urea, etc.). In addition, participants will not be allowed to enroll in other 
interventional studies during Study 232SM20 3. 
7.6.2.  Concomitant Procedures  
A concomitant procedure is any therapeutic intervention (e.g., surgery/biopsy, physical therapy) 
or diagnostic assessment (e.g., blood gas measurement, bacterial cultures) performed between 
Screening and the final study visit/telephone call.  
7.7. Continuation of Treatment  
Following completion of this study, all eligible participants may elect to enroll in a separate 
long-term extension study (232SM302), pending study approval by [CONTACT_102087]. In regard to participants rolling over from Part  B, this will be 
done without unblinding the participant’s treatment group.  
Protocol 232SM203, Version [ADDRESS_113024]  permanently discontinue study treatment for any of the following reasons:  
• The participant becomes pregnant. Study treatment must be discontinued 
immediately. Report the pregnancy according to the instructions in Section  11.4.1 . 
• The participant or the participant’s parent(s)/legal guardian(s) withdraws consent to 
continue study treatment.  
• The participant experiences an AE that necessitates permanent discontinuation of 
study treatment.  
• The participant is not tolerating a given dose.  
• The participant experiences a medical emergency that necessitates permanent 
discontinuation of study treatment (or unblinding of the participant’s treatment 
assignment in Part  B). 
• At the discretion of the Investigator for medical reasons.  
• At the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor for noncompliance.  
The primary reason for discontinuation of study treatment must be recorded in the participant’s 
CRF.  
Participants in Part B who discontinue treatment may remain in the study to continue the 
protocol -required tests and assessments described in Table  5 (unless the reason for 
discontinuation is to initiate treatment with a disallowed concomitant therapy per 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). Participants should return to the clinic according to the original visit schedule 
per Table  [ADDRESS_113025] be taken if a participant fails to return to the study site for a required 
study visit:  
• The study site staff must attempt to contact [CONTACT_102088] 232SM203, Version 7 
Escalating Dose and Randomized, Controlled Study of Nusinersen in SMA  
CONFIDENTIAL  
The information contained herein may not be used, disclosed, or published without the written consent of 
Biogen  MA Inc.  
85 the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether the participant wishes to and/or 
should continue in the study.  
• In cases in which the participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator or 
designee must make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635]. These contact 
[CONTACT_13140]’s medical record.  
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, that participant will be considered 
to have withdrawn from the study with the primary reason of “lost to follow -up.” 
8.3. Withdrawal of Participants From the Study  
Participants must be withdrawn from the study for any one of the following reasons:  
• The participant or the participant’s parent(s)/legal guardian(s) withdraws consent for 
participation in the study.  
• The participant enrolls into another interventional clinical study in which an 
investigational treatment or approved therapy for investigational use is administered 
or initiates treatment with a disallowed concomitant therapy as described in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
• The participant is unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.  
The primary reason for the participant’s withdrawal from the study must be recorded in the 
participant’s CRF.  
Participants should undergo an ET visit unless withdrawal is due to death or withdrawal of 
consent.  
Participants who withdraw from the study may not be replaced.

PHARMACODYNAMIC ASSESSMENTS  
See Section  1.3 for the timing of all assessments.  
Tests and evaluations affecting primary endpoints and/or analyses may need to be repeated if the 
original results are lost or damaged. In these cases, participants will be asked to return to the 
study site to have the evaluations repeated.  
9.1. Clinical Efficacy Assessments  
The following clinical assessments will be performed to evaluate the efficacy of nusinersen in all 
study participants.  
All Participants  
• Number of serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343]

9.1.1.  Motor Milestones  
The assessments to be performed will depend on the participant’s age at enrollment and current 
motor abilities. Videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_101993]/or HINE motor milestone assessments will be 
optional.  
Motor milestones will be assessed using the WHO motor milestone criteria [WHO Multicentre 
Growth Reference Study Group 2006 ; Wijnhoven 2004 ] and/or Section 2 of the HINE, as per the 
Schedule of Activities ( Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, and Table  4). Section  2 of the HINE is 
composed of the following 8  motor milestone categories: voluntary grasp, ability to kick in 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, and walking. Within each 
motor milestone category, [ADDRESS_113028] column 
(no grasp, no kicking, unable to maintain head upright, and so on) has not achieved any motor 
milestone. Motor milestone achiev ement is depi[INVESTIGATOR_101994]  7 
to the right side of the table, as denoted by [CONTACT_102092] 
[Haataja 1999 ]. 
WHO motor milestones will be assessed by [CONTACT_102093]. Adult 
participants who do not require a caregiver during the study visit may self -report WHO motor 
milestone achievement.  
Whenever possible, for each participant, motor milestone assessments across all study visits 
should be conducted consistently by [CONTACT_102094].

1 Values for healthy infants in [De Sanctis 2016 ; Haataja 1999 ] 
The definition of a motor milestone responder is based on the motor milestones categories in 
Section  2 of the HINE, with the exclusion of voluntary grasp, as follows:  
• Participant demonstrates at least a 2 -point increase in the category of ability to kick or 
increase to the maximal score on that category (touching toes) or a [ADDRESS_113029] anding, or 
walking AND

Escalating Dose and Randomized, Controlled Study of Nusinersen in SMA  
CONFIDENTIAL  
The information contained herein may not be used, disclosed, or published without the written consent of 
Biogen  MA Inc.  
91 • Among the 7  motor milestone categories (with the exclusion of voluntary grasp), the 
participant demonstrates improvement in more categories than worsening.  
Note: For the category of ability to kick, similar to the definition of improvement in (1), 
worsening is defined as at least a [ADDRESS_113030] a 1 -point decrease.  
Participants who die or withdraw from the study will be counted as nonresponders and will be 
included in the denominator for the calculation of the proportion.  
9.1.2.  Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_101998] -INTEND will be assessed in participants in Part B with infantile -onset SMA. Participants 
in Part C will have CHOP -INTEND assessed as described in Section  9.1. 
The CHOP -INTEND test was specifically designed to evaluate the motor skills of infants with 
significant motor weakness, including infants with SMA [Glanzman 2010 ]. The CHOP -INTEND 
test captures neck, trunk, and proximal and distal limb strength in 14 elicited and 2  observational 
items. CHOP -INTEND has been established as a safe and reliable infant motor measure in 
infantile -onset SMA and has been validated [Glanzman 2011 ]. 
Whenever possible, for each participant, CHOP -INTEND assessments across all study visits 
should be conducted consistently by [CONTACT_102094].  
9.1.3.  Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded  
The HFMSE is a reliable and validated tool used to assess motor function in children with SMA. 
The scale was originally developed with 20 scored activities and was devised for use in children 
with Type II and Type III SMA with limited ambulation to give ob jective information on motor 
ability and clinical progression [Main 2003 ]. The expanded scale includes an additional module 
of 13 items developed to allow for the evaluation of ambulatory patients with SMA [O'Hagen 
2007 ]. The HFMSE has been shown to be highly correlated with other clinical assessments and 
has shown good test -retest reliability.  
Whenever possible, for each participant, HFSME assessments across all study visits should be 
conducted consistently by [CONTACT_102094].  
9.1.4.  Revised Upper Limb Module  
Participants with later -onset SMA will be evaluated using the RULM  [Mazzone 2016 ]. The 
RULM will continue to be performed should participants subsequently become ambulatory.  
The RULM is an outcome measure developed to assess upper limb functional abilities in patients 
with SMA, including young children, and patients with severe contractures in the lower limbs in 
whom the possibility of detecting functional changes, such as rol ling or long sitting, is limited. 
This test consists of upper limb performance items that are reflective of activities of daily living 
(i.e., raise a can to the mouth as if drinking, take a coin and place it in a box, and remove the lid

92 of a container). The RULM is quickly administered and has been evaluated in patients with SMA 
2 to 52 years of age [Mazzone 2016 ]. 
The purpose of an upper limb scale for use in SMA is to assess the change that occurs in the 
motor performance of the upper limb over time. Motor performance in SMA is defined as a 
demonstrated ability to perform a skill under certain test conditions. This  performance changes 
with disease progression and/or intervention (including surgery) and is based on the observed 
response on the day of the assessment. Motor performance will be impacted by [CONTACT_102095], 
contractures, and maturational development (e.g ., puberty), and the RULM aims to incorporate 
the performance of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand.  
Whenever possible, for each participant, RULM assessments across all study visits should be 
conducted consistently by [CONTACT_102094].

The CGIC rating scale was developed as a brief standalone assessment of the clinician’s view of 
the patient’s global functioning after initiating a study medication [Guy 1976 ]. The CGIC 
provides an overall clinician -determined summary measure that takes into account all available 
information, including knowledge of the patient’s history, psychosocial circumstances, 
symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the patie nt’s ability to function. The 
CGIC is administered by [CONTACT_102096]. The clinician makes a judgment about the total pi[INVESTIGATOR_101999]: the se verity of the illness, the patient’s level of distress and other aspects 
of impairment, and the impact of the illness on functioning. The CGIC is rated without regard to 
the clinician’s belief that any clinical changes are or are not due to medication and without 
consideration of the etiology of the symptoms.  
The CGIC is a 7 -point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient’s illness 
has changed relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention and is rated as 
follows: 1,  very much improved; 2,  much improved; 3,  minimally improved; 4,  no change; 
5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse.  
CGIC should be assessed consistently by [CONTACT_102097]. A separate 
CGIC assessment will be performed by [CONTACT_737] (Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_102000]) and caregiver. Adult participants who do not require a caregiver  during the 
study visits will only have the CGIC assessment assessed by [CONTACT_737].  
9.1.9.  Parent Assessment of Swallowing Ability  
Dysphagia will be assessed in Parts  A and B at the timepoints specified in the  Schedule of 
Activities ( Table  1 and Table  2) using the PASA questionnaire. Caregivers will be asked a series 
of questions regarding the mealtime behavior of the participant.  
The PASA questionnaire was developed by a Biogen team in order to assess the signs and 
symptoms of dysphagia. This questionnaire consists of [ADDRESS_113031] 3 of these domains are generally assessed with 5  levels of response (Never, Rarely, 
Sometimes, Often, and Always), although 2  items are assessed with a simple “Yes”/“No” 
answer. In the final domain, the assessment of swallowing concerns has 4  levels of response: 
Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree, and Strongly Disagree. In answering each item, the caregiver is 
directed to consider the previous 7  days.  
9.1.10.  Quality -of-Life Questionnaires  
QoL questionnaires include the PedsQL, ACEND, . QoL questionnaires will 
be collected on the days specified in Table  1, Table  2, Table  3, and Table  4. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (Generic Core Scales and Neuromuscular 
Module)  
Participants with later -onset SMA will be evaluated using the age -appropriate modules of the 
PedsQL Measurement 4.0 Generic Core Scales and 3.0 Neuromuscular Module [Varni 1999 ], 
which include age 2 to 4 years, 5 to 7 years, 8 to 12 years, 13 to 18 years, 18 to 25 years, and 
≥ 26 years. This assessment has been validated by [CONTACT_102098][INVESTIGATOR_102001] [Iannaccone 2009 ]. 
The PedsQL Measurement Model is a modular approach to measuring HRQOL in children, 
adolescents, and adults. The PedsQL consists of brief, practical, generic core scales, as well as 
condition -specific modules for use in designated clinical populations. The PedsQL 4.0 Generic 
Core Scales include an assessment of physical functioning, emotional functioning, social 
functioning, and school functioning and will be assessed for participants 2 to ≥  26 years of age. 
The PedsQL 3.0 Neuromuscular Module was designed t o measure HRQOL dimensions specific 
to patients with neuromuscular disorders, including SMA, and will be assessed in participants 2 
to 25 years of age. Patient self -report will be measured in participants starting at 5 years of age, 
while parent proxy -report of HRQOL will be measured for participants starting at 2 years of age.  
In Parts A and B, all participants with later -onset SMA will be evaluated using the PedsQL. In 
Part C Cohort 1, the PedsQL (in addition to ACEND) will be evaluated in participants who are 
≥ 2 years of age at Screening. The PedsQL will not be evaluated for participants in Part C 
Cohort  2. 
If a participant is assessed on PedsQL at baseline, then the age range of the scale used at 
Screening for that participant will continue to be used up to Day  302, regardless of changes in 
the participant’s age.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of Caregiver Experience With Neuromuscular Disease  
Parents/caregivers of participants will complete the ACEND questionnaire. The ACEND 
questionnaire will not be collected for adult participants who do not require a caregiver. This 
assessment instrument has been designed to quantify the caregiver impact exp erienced by 
[CONTACT_3654]/caregivers of children affected with severe neuromuscular diseases, including children

[IP_ADDRESS].  All Participants  
The participant’s ventilator use will be collected at every study visit. If ventilation is used daily, 
the average number of hours per day for the past 7 days will be recorded (except for participants 
with infantile -onset SMA enrolled in Part B; see Sectio n [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Participants With Infantile -Onset SMA in Part B  
The participant’s ventilator use (number of hours/day) will be recorded daily by [CONTACT_102099] a daily ventilator use diary for the duration of the study, regardless of whether or not a 
ventilator is being utilized. This information will be obtained by [CONTACT_102100].  
9.1.15.  Standard of Care  
All participants are expected to follow standard of care as referenced in Section  6.[ADDRESS_113032] of care information for Part 
B participants at Screening and Day 302.  
  
  
9.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
The PD properties of nusinersen will be assessed (where data are available) by [CONTACT_102101] -L to explore its role as a potential biomarker of treatment response 
in SMA.  
  
 
 
9.5. Pharmacogenetic and Genetic Assessments  
All participants will undergo genetic testing through a central laboratory to confirm SMN1 status 
(copy number, deletion, and mutation where necessary to confirm 5q SMA) and SMN2  copy 
number. For the purpose of determining study eligibility, historical genetic testing results may be 
acceptable with appropriate documentation or analysis may be performed at a local laboratory if 
needed, but confirmatory testing through a central lab oratory will also be performed. 
Deoxyribonucleic acid is to be collected from all participants to assess sequence variations at the 
SMN1  and SMN2  loci that might affect SMN1  and SMN2  activity or the binding of nusinersen.

98 10. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
See Section  1.3 for the timing of all safety assessments.  
Tests and evaluations affecting primary endpoints and/or analyses may need to be repeated if the 
original results are lost or damaged. In these cases, participants will be asked to return to the 
study site to have the evaluations repeated.  
10.1. Clinical Safety Assessments  
The following clinical assessments will be performed to evaluate the safety profile of nusinersen:  
• AE and SAE recording  
• Medical (including SMA) history.  
• Vital sign measurements: temperature, pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and pulse oximetry  
• Growth parameters: body length/height (for all participants; body length will be 
measured for participants who are not able to stand independently), head, chest, and 
arm circumference (for participants with infantile -onset SMA), and ulnar length (for 
participants with later -onset SMA) will be measured. Additional parameters of 
weight -for-age, weight -for-length, and head -to-chest circumference ratio will be 
calculated.  
• Neurological examinations: HINE Sections  1 and 3 will be administered to 
participants in Part B with infantile -onset SMA, and participants in Part C <  2 years 
of age at the time of informed consent. A neurological examination will be performed 
in participants in Parts A and B with later -onset SMA and participants in Part C 
≥ 2 years of age at the time of informed consent.  
• Physical examinations (videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_101972])  
• ECGs  
• LP opening pressure: Details available in the DHA. LP opening pressure will be 
evaluated for all participants in Parts A and C, but only for participants with 
later-onset SMA in Part B.  
• Concomitant therapy and procedure recording

99 10.2. Laboratory Safety Assessments  
Samples will be analyzed using Good Laboratory Practice -validated assays.  
The following laboratory assessments will be performed to evaluate the safety profile of 
nusinersen:  
• Hematology: complete blood cell count, with differential and platelet count, and 
absolute neutrophil count  
• Coagulation parameters (by [CONTACT_12117]): aPTT, PT, and INR  
• Blood chemistry: total protein, albumin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, bilirubin 
(total and direct), alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, gamma -glutamyl transferase, glucose, calcium, phosphorus, 
bicarbonate, chlor ide, sodium, potassium, cystatin  C, creatine phosphokinase, and 
creatine kinase  
• Urinalysis: urine total protein (by [CONTACT_102102] a 24 -hour urine collection, in which case  samples will be analyzed 
by a central laboratory); specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, 
blood, red blood cells, white blood cells, epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], bacteria, casts, and crystals  
• CSF local laboratory sample: cell count, total protein, and glucose  
The laboratory analytes to be measured are shown in Appendix  B. 
When the safety laboratory sample analysis is at risk due to logistical difficulties or issues with 
access to the central laboratory (e.g., due to COVID -19–related disruptions or humanitarian 
emergencies), these samples may be analyzed by [CONTACT_12082]. Any use of a local 
laboratory under these circumstances must be approved by [CONTACT_102103].  
10.3. Telephone Assessments  
For all study parts, from 2 to 14  days after each maintenance dose, participants will be contact[CONTACT_102104] a telephone call to capture any clinical changes, such as new AEs, ventilator use/status 
updates, and changes in concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Telephone calls will also be made in Part  A 
2 weeks (± 3  days) after the Day  29 dose, in Part B 2  weeks (± 3  days) after the Day  [ADDRESS_113033] 20  participants, and in Part C 2  weeks (± 3  days) after the Day  [ADDRESS_113034] concern should be for the safety of the participant. If necessary, 
appropriate medical intervention should be provided.  
At the signing of the ICF, each participant and/or his/her legally authorized representative and/or 
main caregiver must be given the names and telephone numbers of site staff for reporting SAEs, 
pregnancies, overdoses, and medical emergencies. Throughout t he protocol, the Sponsor is 
named, but reporting may be done through a CRO.  
11.1. Definitions  
11.1.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
(participant) administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable  and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal assessment such as an abnormal laboratory value), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not 
related to the medicinal (investigational) product . 
Determination of whether an abnormal assessment (e.g., laboratory value, vital sign, and ECG) 
result meets the definition of an AE will be made by [CONTACT_737]. Abnormal results are not 
considered AEs unless one or more of the following criteria are me t: 
• The result meets the criteria for an SAE.  
• The result requires the participant to receive specific corrective therapy.  
• The result is considered by [CONTACT_16426].  
11.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death.  
• In the view of the Investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a 
life-threatening event); however, this does not include an event that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.

The information contained herein may not be used, disclosed, or published without the written consent of 
Biogen  MA Inc.  
101 • Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is a medically important event.  
A medically important event is an AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], may jeopardize the 
participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above. (Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require 
an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)  
11.1.3.  Prescheduled or Elective Procedures or Routinely Scheduled Treatments  
A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered 
an SAE, even if the participant is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. The study site must document all of the 
following:  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was 
scheduled (or was on a waiting list to be scheduled)  prior to obtaining the 
participant’s consent to be in the study.  
• The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684], between the participant’s consent to be in the study and the time of the 
procedure or treatment.  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment is the sole 
reason for the intervention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  
− If a participant is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102002], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102003] 11.1.[ADDRESS_113035] be assessed to determine the following:  
• If the event meets the criteria for an SAE as defined in Section  11.1.2  
• The relationship of the event to study treatment as defined in Section  11.2.2  
• The severity of the event as defined in Section  11.2.[ADDRESS_113036] study 
visit/telephone contact [CONTACT_102105], regardless of the severity of the event or its 
relationship to study treatment. At each study visit, the I nvestigator will assess the participant for 
AEs and will record any new AEs or updates to previously reported AEs on the CRF.  
AEs that are ongoing when the participant completes or discontinues the study will be followed 
by [CONTACT_102106]. AE outcome will be recorded 
on the CRF, as applicable.  
11.3.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAE experienced by [CONTACT_102107]/telephone contact [CONTACT_102108], regardless of the severity of the 
event or its relationship to study treatment. SAEs must be repo rted to the Sponsor within 
[ADDRESS_113037] study visit/telephone contact. Thereafter, 
the event should be reported to the Sponsor only if the Investigator considers the SAE to be 
related to study treatment.  
Any SAE that is ongoing when the participant completes or discontinues the study will be 
followed by [CONTACT_71390], stabilized, or returned to baseline 
status.  
11.3.3.  Immediate Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
In order to  adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting an SAE, the study site must 
formally notify the Sponsor within 24  hours of the site staff becoming aware of the SAE or 
according to national law. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the SAE reporting 
information and procedures are used and followed appropriately.  
Protocol 232SM203, Version [ADDRESS_113038] dose of study treatment.  
11.4.2.  Overdose  
An overdose is any dose of study treatment administered to a participant or taken by a participant 
that exceeds the dose assigned to the participant according to the protocol. Overdoses are not 
considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE on the CRF;  however, all overdoses must 
be recorded on an Overdose form and faxed or emailed to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_113039] of care. The Investigator (or designee) should contact 
[CONTACT_1758]’s Medical Director. Refer to the Study Reference Gu ide’s Official Study Contact [CONTACT_102109].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Unblinding for Medical Emergency  
Part B is the only part of the study that is blinded. In a medical emergency when knowledge of 
the participant’s treatment assignment may influence the participant’s clinical care, the 
Investigator may access the participant’s treatment assignment by [CONTACT_12067]. The I nvestigator must 
document the reasons for unblinding in the participant’s source documents. The Investigator is 
strongly advised not to divulge the participant’s treatment assignment to any individual who is 
not directly involved in managing the medic al emergency or to personnel involved with the 
analysis and conduct of the study. The Investigator can contact [CONTACT_102110].  
11.5. Contraception Requirements  
All female participants of childbearing potential and all male participants of reproductive age 
must ensure that effective contraception is used for the duration of the study. In addition, 
participants should not donate sperm or eggs for the duration of the study.  
For the purposes of this study, females of childbearing potential are defined as all females 
physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless  they meet one of the following conditions:

106 • Postmenopausal  
− 52 continuous weeks of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea without an alternative 
medical cause and a serum follicle -stimulating hormone level >  40 mIU/mL  
− 6 weeks after surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy  
• Posthysterectomy  
For the purposes of the study, effective contraception is defined as the use of one  of the 
following:  
For females:  
• Female surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal ligation), where applicable, 
according to local guidelines.  
• Established use of oral, intravaginal, or transdermal combined (estrogen and 
progestogen containing) hormonal methods of contraception associated with the 
inhibition of ovulation  
• Established use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception  
• Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
• Barrier methods of contraception, where applicable according to local guidelines  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Sex with a male who has undergone surgical sterilization (with the appropriate 
postvasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate)  
For males:  
• Vasectomy with negative semen analysis at follow -up. If documentation is not 
available, the participant must use contraception.  
• Condoms with spermicide, where applicable according to local guidelines  
• Sex with a woman who uses the methods described for females if she is of 
childbearing potential  
True abstinence, when this is consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant, 
can be considered an acceptable method of contraception based on the evaluation of the 
Investigator who should also take into consideration the duration of the clinical study. Periodic 
abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are 
not considered acceptable methods of contraception.

11.6. Safety Responsibilities  
11.6.1.  The Investigator  
The Investigator’s responsibilities include the following:  
• Monitor and record all AEs, including SAEs, on the CRF regardless of the severity or 
relationship to study treatment.  
• Determine the seriousness, relationship, and severity of each event.  
• Determine the onset and resolution dates of each event.  
• Monitor and record all pregnancies in female participants and follow up on the 
outcome of all pregnancies.  
• Complete an SAE form for each SAE and fax or email it to the Sponsor within 
24 hours of the site staff becoming aware of the event or according to national law.  
• Pursue SAE follow -up information actively and persistently. Follow -up information 
must be reported to the Sponsor within 24  hours of the site staff becoming aware of 
new information or according to national law.  
• Ensure all AE and SAE reports are supported by [CONTACT_102111]’ 
medical records.

stable. Record AE follow -up information, including resolution, on the CRF, as 
applicable.  
• Report SAEs to local ethics committees, as required by [CONTACT_1769].  
11.6.2.  The Sponsor  
The Sponsor’s responsibilities include the following:  
• Before a site can enroll any participants, the Medical Monitor is responsible for 
reviewing with site staff the definitions of AE and SAE, as well as the instructions for 
monitoring, recording, and reporting AEs and SAEs.  
• The Sponsor is to notify all appropriate regulatory authorities, central ethics 
committees, and Investigators of SAEs, as required by [CONTACT_1769], within required time 
frames.

108 12. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF 
SAMPLE SIZE  
12.1. General Considerations  
The objectives of the study, the endpoints to be analyzed, and the statistical hypotheses are listed 
in Section  4.  
In Part  B, the primary endpoint and a subset of the secondary endpoints will compare the 50/28 -
mg Group to participants who received sham control in Study  CS3B; these analyses will be 
performed using the 50/[ADDRESS_113040] a group of participants who are 
similar to the 232SM203 higher dose group. The remaining secondary endpoints will compare 
the arms within Study 232SM203 Part B (50/28 mg Group ve rsus 12 mg Group). This is detailed 
further in the following sections.  
12.2. Analysis Sets  
The ITT Set is defined as all participants who are randomized (or enrolled, as in Parts  A and C) 
and receive nusinersen; participants will be analyzed in the treatment group to which they are 
randomized.  
The Safety Set is defined as all participants who receive nusinersen; participants will be analyzed 
in the treatment group based on what they actually received.  
 
The ITT, Safety,  Sets will be defined separately for each of the following populations: 
Part A, Part B infantile -onset, Part B later -onset, and Part C.  
A Per -Protocol Set will be defined for the Part B infantile -onset SMA population and will 
include the subset of the ITT Set who complete at least the initial 4  doses of drug/sham 
procedure, have a baseline assessment and at least a Day  [ADDRESS_113041] efficacy assessments.  
The Matched Sham Set will be defined for the analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints 
comparing to sham. This will comprise of sham participants identified by [CONTACT_102112] 50/[ADDRESS_113042] dose of study treatment. The baseline for CHOP -INTEND is defined 
as the average of the assessments taken during the Screening/Baseline perio d.

109 12.4. Methods of Analysis for Efficacy Endpoints  
Within Part  B to control the overall Type  1 error at a 2 sided alpha level of 0.05, a sequential 
testing procedure ranked in the order of the primary and secondary endpoints will be utilized. In 
this procedure, the primary endpoint of change in CHOP -INTEND total score from baseline to 
Day 183 for the Study  CS3B Sham Control Group compared to the 50/[ADDRESS_113043] secondary endpoint of the proportion of 
motor milestone responders at Day  183 fo r the Study  CS3B Sham Control Group compared to 
the 50/[ADDRESS_113044] number of participants and if unsuccessful, smaller 
pools will be selected and the minimum matched will be 20 participants .   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
The main analysis for the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints comparing nusinersen 
50/28 mg to sham will be performed using the 50/[ADDRESS_113045] 20 sham participants selected via the matching algorithm.  
The main analyses for secondary endpoints comparing 50/28 mg to 12 mg will be performed 
using the ITT Set.   
 
 
12.4.1.  Analysis of the Primary Endpoint in Part B  
CHOP -INTEND  
The primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline to Day  183 in CHOP -INTEND total 
score will be analyzed using the joint -rank methodology to account for mortality [Berry 2013 ]. 
This joint -ranking procedure allows for a statistical test of the treatment effect on the 
CHOP -INTEND total score while accounting for loss of data due to deaths. In this analysis, a 
participant’s Combined Assessment of Function and Survival score will b e calculated by 
[CONTACT_102113], resulting in a score of +1 if the

110 outcome was better than the participant being compared, -1 if worse, and 0 if the same. The 
participant’s score will then be calculated by [CONTACT_102114]. For example, if [ADDRESS_113046] and adjusted for baseline CHOP -INTEND total score and disease duration.  
The trimmed -means method [Permutt and Li 2017 ] will be performed as a supplementary 
analysis. The analysis will be performed treating all dropouts and deaths as bad outcomes and 
trimming them out with other observed bad outcomes to form balanced comparison groups. In 
the trimmed mean approach, respons e scores are ranked from best to worst, and participants who 
died are considered as having worse outcomes than those who survived and completed the study. 
All response scores in the treatment group with high mortality/dropout rate will be retained. In 
the treatment group with the higher survival/completion rate, only the same proportion (as the 
survival rate in the high -mortality group) of the top response scores will be retained. The 
trimmed -mean difference can be interpreted as the difference between the top fraction of 
responses between the [ADDRESS_113047] statistic will be calculated using a reference distribution generated by a 
rerandomization procedure.  
12.4.2.  Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints in Part B  
HINE Motor Milestone Responders  
The difference in the proportion of responders between treatment groups will be compared using 
logistic regression with the number of motor milestones at Baseline, age at symptom onset, and 
disease duration at Screening as covariates. Should the number of responders be less than 5  in 
either group, Fisher’s exact test will be used instead. If Fisher’s exact test is used, the 
unconditional confidence interval for the difference in response rates will be provided [Santner 
and Snell 1980 ]. 
The proportion of HINE Section 2 motor milestone responders will be assessed at Day 183 for 
50/28 mg versus sham.

Values that are BLQ will be set to half of the diluted LLOQ.  
Change in plasma NF -L from (ratio to) baseline to Day 183 will be analyzed for 50/28 mg versus 
sham, and change in plasma NF -L from baseline to Day 29 will be analyzed for 50/28 mg versus 
12 mg using the same method as for the primary endpoint.  
CHOP -INTEND  
Change in CHOP -INTEND from baseline to Day 302 will be analyzed for 50/28 mg versus 12 
mg using the same methodology as described for the primary endpoint.  
Time to Death or Permanent Ventilation  
Permanent ventilation is defined as tracheostomy or ≥  16 hours of ventilation/day continuously 
for >  21 days in the absence of an acute reversible event ( Appendix  A). 
An independent EAC will determine, in a blinded fashion, the date at which a participant is 
considered to have met the definition of an event. The procedures for reviewing and adjudicating 
events will be described in a charter.  
The time to death or permanent ventilation (tracheostomy or ≥  16 hours of ventilation/day 
continuously for >  21 days in the absence of an acute reversible event) and time to death (overall 
survival) will be analyzed using the log -rank test stratified by [CONTACT_102115]. The 
null hypothesis is that the comparison groups (ie., sham and 50/28 mg dose) hav e the same 
“survival” function. Participants who do not meet the endpoint definition will be censored at the 
last occasion the participant was s een (either in -person visit or by [CONTACT_24646]), irrespective 
of whether the participant has completed the full course of treatment and whether the participant 
has completed the study or permanently withdrawn. The exception is time to death or permane nt 
ventilation in cases in which a participant has begun a ventilator diary, in which case the latest 
entry in the diary will be used as the date of censoring. The proportion of participants meeting an 
event at timepoints of interest will be estimated usin g the Kaplan -Meier method.  
The analysis will also be perfomed for the comparison of sham versus 50/28 mg doses and the 
comparison of 12 mg versus 50/[ADDRESS_113049] as time to death or permanent ventilation.

Sampling for this analysis will be approved at the discretion of each site’s ethics committee. If a 
site’s ethics committee does not approve the sampling for the analysis, this section will not be 
applicable to that site.  
12.8. Methods of Analysis for Safety Endpoints  
The analysis of safety will be performed separately for the Safety Set for Part  A, Part  B 
infantile -onset, Part  B later -onset, and Part  C. In addition, the Part  B participants will be 
presented by [CONTACT_1570]. The duration of treatment and the amount of study treatment will 
be summarized.  
12.8.1.  Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities.  
The incidence of treatment -emergent AEs and SAEs will be presented for Parts  A, B, and C. All 
AEs will be analyzed based on the principle of treatment emergence. An AE will be regarded as 
treatment -emergent if it was present prior to receiving the first dose of nusinersen and 
subsequently worsened in severity or was not present pri or to receiving the first dose of 
nusinersen but subsequently appeared.  
The number and percentage of participants who experienced SAEs, AEs, and discontinuation 
from nusinersen due to an AE will be summarized. Additionally, AEs will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_102116].  
A participant having the same AE more than once will be counted only once in the incidence for 
that event. The occurrence of the AE with the greatest severity will be used in the calculation of 
incidence by [CONTACT_926]; the occurrence of the AE with the stron gest relationship to nusinersen will 
be used in the calculation of incidence by [CONTACT_102117].  
AEs will be further tabulated by [CONTACT_6496] (e.g., age, race, sex, administration status of 
nusinersen [90 -day intervals], and SMA history).  
12.8.2.  Clinical Laboratory Results  
Clinical laboratory evaluations, including coagulation, hematology, blood chemistry, and 
urinalysis parameters, will be summarized using shift tables, presenting changes relative to each 
parameter’s normal range. Summary statistics for actual values and ch anges from baseline will 
also be presented.  

Protocol 232SM203, Version [ADDRESS_113051] had the opportunity to reach the Day 183 visit.  
Full details of the analyses and controlled access to the unblinded data will be documented in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan, the unblinding plan, and the IDMC charter.  
12.11.  Sample Size Considerations  
A total sample size of approximately 145 participants is planned for this study ( Table  9). The 
justification for the sample size for the infantile -onset SMA population in Part  B is detailed as 
follows. The sample sizes for the remaining groups are not based on statistical considerations.  
A minimum of 6  participants with later -onset SMA will be enrolled in Part  A to characterize the 
safety, tolerability, and  of a 28/28 -mg dose of nusinersen (28 -mg loading dose; 28mg 
maintenance dose). A total of 24  participants with later -onset SMA will be randomized to the 
Control Group and 50/28 -mg Group in Part  B in a ratio of 1:2; this will allow the exploration of 
the safety, tolerability, , and efficacy of the 50/28 mg dose of nusinersen in this 
population. A total of up to approxi mately 40  participants will be enrolled in Part  C (i.e., up to 
approximately 20  participants each in Cohorts 1 and 2) to characterize the safety, tolerability, 
and  of a 50/28 mg dose of nusinersen in participants transitioning from maintenance 
dosing at the currently approved dose of 12  mg of nusinersen.

1 The sample size is an estimate that may be up to approximately the stated number.  
For the infantile -onset SMA population in Part  B, a sample size of approximately 50  participants 
in the 50/[ADDRESS_113052] N= [ADDRESS_113053] 
approximately 99% power for the primary endpoint to detect an improvement of 24  points on 
CHOP -INTEND and 23% survival rate benefit (compared to that observed in Study  CS3B 
participants receiving sham control) at Day  [ADDRESS_113054] at a 2 -sided 
significance level of 0.05. This power calculation is based on simulations using data generated 
from a joint model of survival and functional change. The model used a difference of 24  points 
for the Day  183 change from baseline in CHOP -INTEND total score (50/28 -mg Group  – 
Study  CS3B Sham Control Group) and a population standard deviation of 8.8 for change from 
baseline.  
A secondary endpoint for this study is that the efficacy in the 50/28 mg Group compared to the 
12 mg Control Group will be different based on the change from baseline to Day 302 in CHOP -
INTEND.  
For Part  B, the randomization will be stratified as follows:  
• For participants with infantile -onset SMA by [CONTACT_102075]: ≤  12 weeks and 
> 12 weeks (time from age at symptom onset to age at informed consent)  
• For participants with later -onset SMA by [CONTACT_102076]: <  6 years and 
≥ [ADDRESS_113055] 8 but no more than 
12 participants ≥  18 years of age (participants ≥  [ADDRESS_113056] be ambulatory). For 
Cohort  [ADDRESS_113057] be ≥ [ADDRESS_113058] to a participant. In this case, the appropriate regulatory authorities will be notified 
subsequent to the modification.  
In the event of a protocol modification, the ICF may require similar modifications (see 
Section  13.4). 
13.4. Informed Consent  
Prior to performing any study -related activities under this protocol, including screening tests and 
assessments, informed consent with the approved ICF must be obtained.  
The background of the proposed study, the procedures, the benefits and risks of the study, and 
that study participation is voluntary for the participant must be explained to the participant and/or 
the participant’s legally authorized representative. The pa rticipant and/or the participant’s legally 
authorized representative must be given sufficient time to consider whether to participate in the 
study.  
In addition, participants who have the capacity should provide their assent to participate in the 
study. The level of information provided to participants should match their level of 
understanding, as determined by [CONTACT_102119] a pplicable regulations 
and guidelines.  
A copy of the signed and dated ICF and assent must be given to the participant and/or the 
participant’s legally authorized representative. The original signed and dated ICF will be retained 
with the study records. Local regulations must be complied with re garding the final disposition 
of the original and copi[INVESTIGATOR_71323].  
Confirmation of informed consent and assent must also be documented in the participant’s 
medical record.  
When additional information that may affect participants’ willingness to continue in the study 
becomes available, the Investigators will be notified in a timely manner, according to all local 
and applicable law. An updated ICF may be required.  
Protocol 232SM203, Version [ADDRESS_113059] also provide all authorizations required by [CONTACT_102120] 
(e.g., Protected Health Information authorization in North Am erica).  
During the study, participants’ race, ethnicity, and full date of birth will be collected. These data 
will be used in the analysis of the safety and/or  of the study treatment. SMA is caused 
by [CONTACT_102121] a homozygous deletion or muta tion or a compound heterozygous 
mutation in the SMN1  on chromosome 5q11 -q13. Thus, patients with SMA are completely 
dependent on the amount of SMN produced by [CONTACT_102122]2 . Genetic modifiers, such as the number 
of copi[INVESTIGATOR_102005]2 , are known to impact the ev entual phenotype of SMA. The incidence and 
prevalence of SMA and its subtypes have been reported to vary based on country. One 
hypothesis for these variances is a difference in the frequency of certain genetic mutations that 
may be associated with differen t racial and ethnic groups within each country. Therefore, the 
race/ethnicity of participants will be collected as part of the medical history, where local 
regulations allow. The full date of birth is needed in order to be able to precisely calculate the 
age at achievement of motor milestones and the weight -for-age percentiles.  
Study reports will be used for research purposes only. The participant will not be identified by 
[CONTACT_102123], study -related forms, study reports, or any related publications. The Sponsor, its 
partners and designees, ethics committees, and various governme nt health agencies may inspect 
the records of this study. Every effort will be made to keep the participant’s personal medical 
data confidential.  
13.6. Compensation for Injury  
The Sponsor maintains appropriate insurance coverage for clinical studies and will follow 
applicable local compensation laws.  
13.7. Conflict of Interest  
The Investigators should address any potential conflicts of interest (e.g., financial interest in the 
Sponsor) with the participant before the participant makes a decision to participate in the study.  
13.8. Study Report Signatory  
The Sponsor will designate one or more of the participating Investigators as a signatory for the 
study report. This determination will be made by [CONTACT_71411], including but not limited to, the 
Investigator’s experience and reputation in the studied ind ication; the Investigator’s contribution 
to the study in terms of design, management, and/or participant  enrollment; or other factors 
determined to be relevant by [CONTACT_1034].  

Protocol 232SM203, Version [ADDRESS_113060] Research Organization  
A CRO will be responsible for the administrative aspects of the study, including but not limited 
to study initiation, management of SAE reports, monitoring, and data management.  
14.1.2.  Interactive Response Technology  
IRT will be used in this study. Before participants are screened or enrolled, the IRT vendor will 
provide each study site with the necessary training, a user manual, and access rights to the 
system.  
14.1.3.  Electronic Data Capture  
Participant information will be captured and managed by [CONTACT_102124] a 
web-based electronic data capture tool configured by [CONTACT_102125].  
14.1.4.  Central Laboratories for Laboratory Assessments  
A central laboratory will be selected by [CONTACT_102126], blood chemistry, 
urinalysis, and CSF samples (except for local analysis of CSF total protein, cell count, and 
glucose) collected for this study. Analysis of urine total protein wil l be conducted by [CONTACT_102127]; however, if local analysis is not possible without a 24 -hour urine collection, then 
samples will be analyzed by a central laboratory. Analysis of coagulation, pregnancy tests, and 
CSF total protein/cell count/glucose w ill be conducted by [CONTACT_28130]. , 
, and NF -L samples will be analyzed at a laboratory selected by [CONTACT_1034] 
(Appendix  B). 
When the safety laboratory sample analysis is at risk due to logistical difficulties or issues with 
access to the central laboratory (e.g., due to COVID -19–related disruptions or humanitarian 
emergencies), these samples may be analyzed by [CONTACT_102128]. Any use of a local 
laboratory under these circumstances must be approved by [CONTACT_102103].  
For all participants, a blood sample will be collected during the study to evaluate SMN1  status 
(copy number, deletion, and mutation where necessary to confirm 5q SMA) and SMN2  copy 
number by [CONTACT_2237]. For participants without acceptable documentation of these 
genetic testing results before Screening, a blood sample must be collected during the Screening 
period to determine eligibility (preferably for analysis by [CONTACT_102129],  if needed). For participants with documentation of 
these genetic testing results before Screening or whose sample was analyzed locally during the

122 Screening period (with documentation of these genetic testing results), a blood sample will be 
collected (preferably at Screening but must be collected by [CONTACT_102130]) for 
confirmatory testing through the central laboratory.  
Sample analysis for participants from China will be performed within China.  
14.2. Study Committees  
14.2.1.  Endpoint Adjudication Committee  
Time to death or permanent ventilation will be determined in a blinded fashion by a central, 
independent EAC. Procedures for reviewing and adjudicating events are described in the charter 
that governs the operation of the EAC.  
14.2.2.  Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An IDMC will be formed to review ongoing safety and tolerability data. An IDMC review of 
participant data through Day [ADDRESS_113061] 15 participants in Part B (Section  5.1) 
will occur prior to dosing of the remaining participants in Part B and dosing in Part C of the 
study. Note that the IDMC can recommend to stop the study based on the safety findings.  
An IDMC charter will provide full guidance on the function and practices to be followed by [CONTACT_102131].  
Protocol 232SM203, Version [ADDRESS_113062] been processed correctly. Data anomalies will be communicated to the 
sites for clarification and resolution, as appropriate. The Investigator is responsible for endorsing 
all CRF data prior to any interim or final database lock.  
During and/or after completion of the study, quality assurance officers named by [CONTACT_102132]. The Investigator will 
be expected to cooperate with any audit or inspection and to provide assistance and 
documentation (including source data) as requested.  
15.3. Monitoring of the Study  
The Investigator must permit study -related monitoring by [CONTACT_102133]’ medical histories. Source data must be attributable, legible, 
contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete. Changes to source data  must be traceable, 
not obscure the original entry, and be explained if necessary (e.g., with an audit trail). The 
Investigator should maintain a record of the location(s) of essential documents.  
The Site Monitor will visit the study site at regular intervals during the study and after the study 
has completed, as appropriate, or may perform monitoring activities remotely (where permitted 
by [CONTACT_427]) only during the COVID -19 pandemic where  on-site monitoring is not 
allowed per local/regional restrictions. A clinical site monitoring plan will detail who performs 
the monitoring, how often, and the extent of the review. It also will provide the monitoring 
strategy, with emphasis on participant  safety, data integrity, and critical data and processes.  
CRFs, supporting documentation, and essential documentation related to the study will be 
reviewed, and any discrepancies or omissions will be resolved. Documentation of results will be 
provided to the Sponsor in a timely fashion to allow follow -up and verification of compliance 
with the monitoring plan. Remote evaluation of data may also be conducted and reported as 
defined in the monitoring pla n. 
Monitoring must be conducted according to the applicable ICH and GCP guidelines to ensure the 
protection of participants’ rights and well -being, protocol adherence, quality of data (accurate, 
complete, and verifiable), study treatment accountability, compl iance with regulatory 
requirements, and continued adequacy of the investigational site and its facilities.  
Protocol 232SM203, Version [ADDRESS_113063] review the study travel policy prior to screening any study participants. Consultation 
and/or approval may be required from the Medical Monitor depending on the study participant’s 
place of residence and travel distance to the site. Please refer  to the Study Travel Policy for 
specific details and guidelines.

130 APPENDIX  A. PERMANENT VENTILATION DEFINITION CRITERIA: 
ACUTE REVERSIBLE EVENT  
Purpose : Acute, intercurrent events may result in transient utilization of increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_102012] (SMA) in this study. Such events may not 
reflect irreversible SMA disease progression and may complicate the abi lity to detect the effects 
of nusinersen on SMA disease progression.  
A secondary endpoint is defined as the time to death or permanent ventilation (tracheostomy or 
≥ 16 hours of ventilation/day continuously for >  21 days in the absence of an acute reversible 
event ). 
The purpose of this appendix is to define an acute reversible event and to indicate how this 
prespecified definition will be used in this study.  
Any one of the following that occur between 7 days before and 7  days after  the onset of 
threshold -level respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] (≥  16 hours/day) meet the definition of an acute reversible 
event:  
1. Fever ≥  102°F/38.9°C (tympanic, rectal, axillary, skin, sublingual)  
2. Infection  
• Blood, sputum, throat, or cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) culture positive ×  2 for virus, 
bacteria, or fungus  
• Blood, throat, sputum, or CSF viral polymerase chain reaction positive  
• Blood, throat, sputum, or CSF for infectious antigen diagnostic (e.g., streptococcus+ 
or hepatitis  B surface antigen positive)  
• Blood, throat, sputum, or CSF positive for direct microscopic visualization 
(e.g.,  bronchoalveolar lavage or Gram stain revealing the presence of bacteria by 
[CONTACT_102135])  
3. Surgical procedure  
• Operation (i.e., gastrostomy/jejunostomy tube or an orthopedic procedure)  
• Any procedure in which regional or general anesthesia is administered  
If any of the above is verified by [CONTACT_102136] (e.g., emergency room visit 
summary, outpatient clinic note, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102013], operative report, etc.), the endpoint 
is NOT  met until the participant requires threshold -level ventilation (≥  16 hours/day) 
continuously for >  21 days beginning 14  days after the acute reversible event. The rationale is 
that, in the context of an acute reversible event, the SMA participant is given a “grace period” of

visit only, a local laboratory may be used instead for analysis if needed for the timely treatment of the participant 
at the discretion of the Investigator. When the safety laboratory sample analysis is at risk due to logistical 
difficulties or issues with access to the central laboratory (e.g., due to COVID -19–related disruptions or 
humanitarian emergencies), these samples may be analyzed by [CONTACT_102137]. Any use of a local laboratory 
under these circumstances must be approved by [CONTACT_102138].

Rationale:   
CS3B Matched Sham Control Group:  
For analy sis of  the primary and secondary endpoints comparing nusinersen 50/[ADDRESS_113077] analysis in the 
context of well -characterized natural history of untreated SMA. Analysis of the remaining 
secondary endpoints comparing nusinersen 50/28 mg versus 12 mg will utilize only the 
participants within 232SM203 Part  B. 
Comparison s of nusinersen 50/28 mg versus 12 mg:  
Given the clinical importance of understanding the relative benefit of the  higher dose (50/28 mg) 
versus standard dose (12 mg) nusinersen  regimens, formal comparisons between these regimens 
 to secondary analyses. The methods of analysis in the protocol 
describe the updated sequential testing order and comparison populations of the efficacy 
endpoints for participants with infantile -onset SMA in Part B. The primary and secondary 
endpoints will be tested sequentially with a 2-sided alpha of 0.05. Statistical significance needs 
to be declared for an endpoint before testing the next endpoint in the sequence.  
Neurofilament  biomarker : 
Neurofilaments are a nonspecific marker of axonal injury and neurodegeneration. Across  
neurodegenerative diseases, including SMA, higher  levels of NF have been found to be 
prognostic for faster disease progression. As such, a treatment -driven  reduction in NF levels 
provides objective evidence  of a slowing of the neurodegenerative process  that is central to the 
underlying pathophysiology of SMA. As such, NF levels will be measured as a secondary 
measure of treatment response in  participants with infantile -onset SMA and later -onset SMA . 
The NF biomarker was changed from  to NF -L due to recent technical issues with the 
. Internally, assays for  NF-L have been fully qualified for 
SMA research , and samples collected from other Biogen studies on nusinersen have been 
analyzed for both NF proteins.  
Proportion of HINE  Section 2 responders (higher dose vs . sham):  
The secondary endpoint of proportion of HINE  Section 2 responders (higher dose vs . sham) was 
changed  to the same timepoint as the primary endpoint (Day 183) to allow use of the same set of 
matched sham participants/data for the primary endpoint and to increase the likelihood of closest 
match given the greater sample size of CS3B sham participants  from which to match. Follow -up 
to Day 183 is considered sufficient to see a clear separation for higher dose versus sham control.  
CHOP -INTEND (higher dose vs . 12 mg):  
The endpoint of change from baseline in CHOP -INTEND (higher dose vs . 12 mg),  
 to a secondary endpoint, was changed to a timepoint of

12 SUMMARY OF MAJOR CHANGES TO THE PROTOCOL  
Changes to the protocol are presented chronologically. New text is shown in bold type; deleted 
text is shown with a strikethrough . 
Section 1.1, Synopsis  
The synopsis was revised to reflect changes made throughout the protocol.  
 
Section 9.1.15, Standard of Care  
Change: A standard of care assessment was added to the clinical efficacy assessments.  
Now reads:  
All participants are expected to follow standard of care as referenced in Section  6.[ADDRESS_113079] of care 
information for Part B participants at Screening and Day 302.  
Rationale:  A new section was added for a standard of care assessment to reflect the 
implementation of a Standard of Care CRF. The CRF was added to further understand access to 
health  care specialists in the many countries that enrolled.  
This change also affects Section 1.3, Schedule of Activities.  
 
Section 10.2, Laboratory Safety Assessments  
Change:  Text was added to clarify whether urine total protein analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_102140].  
Now reads:  
… 
• Urinalysis: urine total protein (by [CONTACT_102141] a 24 -hour urine collection, in which case  samples will be 
analyzed by a central laboratory ); specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, 
bilirubin, blood, red blood cells, white blood cells, epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], bacteria, casts, and 
crystals

CONFIDENTIAL  
The information contained herein may not be used, disclosed, or published without the written consent of 
Biogen  MA Inc.  
13 Rationale:  As some sites (e.g., sites in China) are unable to perform local urine total protein 
analysis without collecting urine over a [ADDRESS_113080] been set up for 
central laboratory analysis for these affected sites only.  
This change also affects Section 1.3, Schedule of Activities; Section 14.1.4, Central Laboratories 
for Laboratory Assessments; and Appendix B, Laboratory Analytes.  
 
Section 16, Public Health or Humanitarian Emergencies  
Change: Section 16, Public Health or Humanitarian Emergencies was removed from the 
protocol.  
Now reads:  
In the event of public health or humanitarian emergencies that result in site closure, travel 
restrictions, and/or clinical research activities being deprioritized at the site such that clinic 
visit(s) cannot occur, a protocol deviation would be incurred f or any deviation from the 
protocol specified visits and assessments, with additional notation that this protocol deviation is 
due to the public health or humanitarian emergency. If a protocol specified clinical visit cannot 
occur due to a public health or humanitarian emergency, the following mitigating options should 
be pursued: 1) transfer to another active study site that is open and 2) local laboratory visit. 
These mitigating options only apply in the setting of a public health or humanitarian emergency  
in which a protocol specified clinic visit cannot occur and should not be pursued solely due to 
the participant’s preference. If the participant does not participate in one of these options, a 
safety telephone call must be conducted within [ADDRESS_113081] dosing visit.  
If any participants with later onset SMA enrolled in Part B are unable to comply with study visits 
in areas affected by [CONTACT_102142] (prior to the Day 183 dose and assessments), up to 4 ad ditional participants may be 
enrolled at the Sponsor’s discretion.  
Rationale:  Section 16 was previously removed as a country -specific protocol amendment for 
[LOCATION_013] (dated 07 November 2022) to comply with local regulations. After review, text 
elsewhere in the protocol sufficiently captures key mitigation activities related to 
COVID ‑19‑related disruptions or humanitarian emergencies . Therefore , this section was 
removed f rom the global protocol.  
This change also affects Section 1.1, Synopsis; and Section 12.11, Sample Size Considerations.

3 PRIMARY REASON FOR AMENDMENT  
The primary reason for this amendment to Protocol 232SM203 is to reduce the sample size for 
Part B infantile onset participants to 75.  As a result, the total sample size for the study was 
adjusted to 145 participants.  
 
New text is shown in bold type; deleted text is shown with a strikethrough . 
 
Section 12.11, Sample Size Considerations  
Now reads:  
A total sample size of up to  approximately 172 145 participants is planned for this study , with a 
possibility of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_102021] B based on the 
interim analysis  (Table 10). The justification for the sample size for the infantile -onset SMA 
population in Part B is detailed as follows. The sample sizes for the remaining groups are not 
based on statistical considerations.  
…

Total    172 1451 
1 The sample size is an estimate that may be up to approximately the stated number.  
For the infantile -onset SMA population in Part B, a sample size of up to 68  approximately  
50 participants in the 50/[ADDRESS_113086] approximately 99% power for the 
primary endpoint  to detect an improvement of 24  points on CHOP - INTEND and 23% survival 
rate benefit (compared to that observed in Study  CS3B participants receiving sham control) at 
Amendment Summary for Protocol 232SM203, Version [ADDRESS_113087] at a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05. This power 
calculation is based on simulations using data generated from a joint model of survival and 
functional change. The model used a difference of 24 points for the Day 183 change from 
baseline in CHOP - INTEND total score (50/28 -mg Group – Study CS3B Sham Control Group) 
and a population standard deviation of 8.8 for change from baseline.  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
… 
Rationale:  Part B of the DEVOTE study design includes primary and secondary hypotheses that 
compare the high -dose nusinersen arm from DEVOTE to the historical sham -control arm from 
Study CS3B (ENDEAR).  
 
 
With [ADDRESS_113088] a power of ≥ 95%, as shown in the table below. 
Enrolling an additional 27  participants (as planned in the original design based on initial  
determination of borrowing) does not meaningfully increase the power for the primary and 
secondary hypothesis testing, since these are already high.

6 SUMMARY OF MAJOR CHANGES TO THE PROTOCOL  
Changes to the protocol are presented chronologically. New text is shown in bold type; deleted 
text is shown with a strikethrough . 
Section 1.1, Synopsis  
The Synopsis was revised to reflect changes made throughout the protocol.  
 
Section 3.1.2, Rationale for Dosing Regimen  
Change : Additional details regarding the revision of the target CSF C trough and the clinical 
relevance of this change were included.  
Now reads:  
Previous PK modeling predicted that the median concentration of nusinersen within the 
CSF immediately prior to the administration of the subsequent maintenance dose (i.e., 
Ctrough ) would be approximately 10 ng/mL at steady  state with the label -approved 
maintenance dosing regimen (i.e., 12 mg administered every 4 months) and approximately 
20 ng/mL at steady  state with the proposed maintenance dosing regimen for 
Study  232SM203 (i.e., 28 mg administered every 4  months). This model was subsequently 
updated to include additional data from Studies  232SM201 and CS11 not previously 
modeled, resulting in an adjustment of CSF C trough  predictions in all patient populations, 
which are still consistent with the prior predictions. As a consequence,  Ppopulation PK 
modeling now predicts that with increasing the maintenance dose from 12 to 28 mg administered 
every 4 months, CSF C trough should increase from 5 to 12  ng/mL at steady state. The 
exposure -response (PK/PD) relationship between steady -state CSF Ctrough and CHOP - INTEND 
response continuously increases as a function of PK , and is on an upward trajectory at 
concentrations consistent with the 12 mg maintenance dose  (i.e., 5  ng/mL) . It is therefore 
predicted that additional clinical benefit (i.e., a 5 -point increase in CHOP - INTEND score) could 
be achieved by [CONTACT_102067] 12 ng/mL. This assumption is supported by 
[CONTACT_102144], which showed nearly dose proportional 
PK in the plasma and CNS tissues (target site of action) up to 15  mg (human equivalent dose of 
150 mg). Therefore, administration of this higher dose of nusinersen may lead to  
meaningful clinical benefit to patients. At this time, no dose -limiting toxicity has been 
identified with nusinersen. The PK modeling therefore suggests that it is unlikely that the 
higher doses of nusinersen would have a less favorable risk -benefit profile compared with 
standard dose nusinersen.

7 The assumption of PK linearity is supported by [CONTACT_102145], which showed nearly dose -proportional PK in the plasma and CNS 
tissues (target site of action) up to 15 mg (human equivalent dose of 150 mg).  Assuming PK 
linearity, PK simulations were performed in both infantile - and later onset SMA populations 
after 2 years of treatment using a population PK model developed from patients across the age 
range of ≤ [ADDRESS_113090] recent PK modeling performed, relative 
to the approved 12 -mg label regimen (CSF C trough of approximately 5 ng/mL), 28 mg 
administered as 3 loading doses (biweekly) or 50 mg administered as 2 loading doses (biweekly), 
each followed by [CONTACT_102052] 28 mg every 4 months, were identified to achieve the 
desired CSF C trough (approximately 12 ng/mL) more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_101978]. 
Nusinersen 28 mg administered as 3 loading doses (biweekly) had a comparable predicted CSF 
Cmax to the reference dosing regimen, whereas the 50 -mg dosing regimen surpassed the predicted 
Cmax from the reference dosing regimen. Moreover, the 28 -mg maintenance dosing regimen 
adequately maintained the higher CSF C trough target (approximately 12 ng/mL) during the 
maintenance dose period. Toxicology studies in nonhuman primates evaluating the nonhuman 
primate equivalent of the [ADDRESS_113091] been conducted and support the safety of 
these doses in a clinical study (see Section 3.3). Therefore, the 28 -mg dose (administered as 
3 loading doses at biweekly intervals), 50 -mg dose (administered as 2  loading doses at biweekly 
intervals), and 28 -mg maintenance dose were recommended for additional clinical evaluation.  
Rationale:  Since the development of the original protocol for Study 232SM203, more recent PK 
modeling data have become available. These data have impacted the predicted steady -state CSF 
Ctrough values for the different nusinersen dosing regimens used in this study. Additional 
information describing the change in CSF C trough predictions was added to this protocol 
amendment for clarity and to further explain why the target CSF C trough has changed. In addition, 
text was added to show that the potential predicted clinical benefit (in the form of an increase in 
CHOP -INTEND score) is also greater now based on the new PK modeling data available.  
This change also affects Section 1.1, Synopsis.  
 
Section 5.1, Study Overview

Part B were added to the protocol.  
Now reads:  
… 
Once the fifteenth participant in Part B has been enrolled and administered the first dose of study 
treatment, no new participants will be dosed in Part B until after an IDMC review. The IDMC 
will review unblinded data from the first [ADDRESS_113092] completed the 
Day 29 visit (in order to achieve [ADDRESS_113093] received 50 mg in the 
50/[ADDRESS_113094] of the study team). This review will

8 include safety data through the Day 29 visit at a minimum and all available individual CSF and 
plasma nusinersen concentration data for these participants, including the Day 15 samples at a 
minimum. Dosing of the remaining participants in Part B and dosing in Part C will occur only 
after this review has completed, provided that no safety concerns are identified. Note that the 
IDMC can recommend to stop the study based on the safety findings. By [CONTACT_102146] 6, the IDMC reviewed these data and recommended 
that the study may continue with dosing of the remaining participants in Part B and 
initiating dosing in Part C without any modifications to the study.  
Rationale:  The prespecified IDMC review of the first 15 participants enrolled in Part B has now 
occurred. As such, a statement was added to the protocol to acknowledge that this review has 
been completed and that no study design changes were required as a result. This enabled dosing 
to continue in Part B and for participants to begin enrolling in Part C of the study . 
This change also affects Section 1.1, Synopsis.  
 
Section 6.2, Exclusion Criteria

Module)  
Change:  The PedsQL Measurement 4.0 Generic Core Scales and 3.0 Neuromuscular Module for 
participants ≥  26 years of age were  added.  
Now reads:  
Participants with later -onset SMA will be evaluated using the age-appropriate modules of the  
PedsQL Measurement 4.0 Generic Core Scales and 3.0 Neuromuscular Module [Varni 1999] , 
which include age 2 to 4 years, 5 to 7 years, 8 to 12 years, 13 to 18 years, 18 to 25 years, and 
≥ 26 years . This assessment has been validated by [CONTACT_102098][INVESTIGATOR_102001] [Iannaccone 2009] . 
The PedsQL Measurement Model is a modular approach to measuring HRQOL in children , and 
adolescents , and adults . The PedsQL consists of brief, practical, generic core scales, as well as 
condition -specific modules for use in designated clinical populations.  Patient self report is 
measured in children and adolescents  5 to 25 years of age, and parent proxy report  of child 
HRQOL is measured for children and adolescents  2 to 25 years of age.  Patient self report and 
parent proxy report are available for participants who are ≥ 26 years of age for the Generic Core 
Scale.  The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales include an assessment of physical functioning, 
emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning  and will be assessed for 
participants 2 to ≥  26 years of age . The PedsQL 3.0 Neuromuscular Module was designed to 
measure HRQOL dimensions specific to  children 2 to 18  years of age  patient s with 
neuromuscular disorders, including SMA , and will be assessed in participants 2 to 25  years of 
age. Patient self -report will be  measured in  participants starting at  5 years of age, while  
parent proxy -report of  HRQOL will be  measured for  participants starting at  2 years of age.  
Rationale:  Details regarding the available modules by [CONTACT_102147] 
4.0 Generic Core Scales and 3.0  Neuromuscular Module were included for completeness. In 
addition, assessment requirements by [CONTACT_102148] 25 and ≥  26 years of age, which is applicable for participants in

The laboratory analytes to be measured are shown in Appendix B.  
When the safety laboratory sample analysis is at risk due to logistical difficulties or issues 
with access  to the central laboratory (e.g., due to COVID -19–related disruptions  or 
humanitarian emergencies ), these samples may be analyzed by [CONTACT_12082]. Any 
use of a local laboratory under these circumstances must be approved by [CONTACT_102149].  
Rationale:  For various clinical sites globally (e.g., Saudi Arabia  and Russia ), transporting safety  
laboratory samples to the central laboratory could take longer than usual  and result in the 
samples arriving outside the stability period . Allowing these samples to be sent to the local 
laboratory offers the flexibility to have the samples processed and evaluated in a timely manner , 
ensuring the safety of trial participants and analysis of these important study data .

Section 16, Public Health or Humanitarian Emergencies  
Change:  This section was added to address contingencies in areas affected by [CONTACT_102150].  
Now reads:  
In the event of public health or humanitarian emergencies that result in site closure, travel 
restrictions, and/or clinical research activities  being deprioritized at the site such that clinic 
visit(s) cannot occur, a protocol deviation would be incurred for any deviation from the 
protocol -specified visits and assessments, with additional notation that this protocol 
deviation is due to the public health or humanitarian emergency. If a protocol -specified 
clinical visit cannot occur due to a public health or humanitarian emergency, the following 
mitigating options should be pursued: 1) transfer to another active study site that is open 
and 2) local laboratory visit. These mitigating options only apply in the setting of a public 
health or humanitarian emergency in which a protocol -specified clinic visit cannot occur 
and should not be pursued solely due to the participant’s preference. If the participant does 
not participate in one of these options, a safety telephone call must be conducted within 
[ADDRESS_113095] dosing visit.  
If any participants with later -onset SMA enrolled in Part B are unable  to comply with 
study visits in areas affected by [CONTACT_102151] n early  from the study  (prior to the Day 183 dose and assessments) , up to 
4 additional  participants may be enrolled at the Sponsor’s discretion.  
Rationale:  This section was added to provide guidance in the event of public health or 
humanitarian emergencies.  In case any such emergency impacts the Sponsor’s ability to collect 
data from a significant portion of the later -onset participants  enrolled in Part B, conditional 
language has been added to allow enrollment of additional later -onset participants for effective 
data analyses.

2 PRIMARY REASON FOR AMENDMENT  
The primary reason for this amendment to Protocol 232SM203 is to increase the sample size for 
Part C by [CONTACT_1583] a second cohort consisting of up to approximately 20 adult participants.  
New text is shown in bold type; deleted text is shown with a strikethrough . 
 
Section 5.1, Study Overview  
Now reads:  
 
In Part C, up to  approximately [ADDRESS_113099] 1 year prior to entry in this study will be 
enrolled in Part C. The initial cohort in Part C (i.e., Cohort 1) consists of approximately [ADDRESS_113100] 8 but no more than 12 participants ≥  18 years of age (participants in Cohort 1 
≥ [ADDRESS_113101] be ambulatory). Up to 5 participants with severe scoliosis and/or severe 
contractures may be enrolled in Cohort 1 of Part C after consultation with the Medical Monitor. 
An additional cohort (i.e., Cohort 2) consisting of  up to  approximately 20 adult participants 
(≥ 18 years of age) was subsequently added to Part C in Protocol Version 5  in order to 
enable collection of data in adults transitioning from the currently approved nusinersen 
dosing regimen to a higher dose . Participants in Cohort 2 can be either ambulatory or 
nonambulatory.  
All Pparticipants in Part C will receive a single bolus dose of 50  mg (which should be 
administered 4  months  ± [ADDRESS_113102] recent maintenance dose of 12  mg) followed by 
[ADDRESS_113103] (bolus) dose for the purpose of completing study 
assessments.  
Rationale:  Increasing the sample size by [CONTACT_102152] 
[ADDRESS_113104] been modified or added as appropriate for this 
cohort. The assessment includes safety, tolerability,  and efficacy assessments, consistent 
with Part C objectives.

The synopsis was revised to reflect changes made throughout the protocol.  
 
Section 1.3 , Table 2: Schedule of Activities for Part B ; Table 3: Schedule of Activities for Part C 
Cohort 1  
Change:  The timepoints for collection of vital signs, neurological examinations, and ECGs and 
the collection windows for  were updated for Parts B and C. The impacted 
footnotes for Tables 2 and 3 are presented below.  
Now reads:  
Table 2:  Schedule of Activities for Part B910 On Days 1 and 15, postdose Vvital signs will 
be collected at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours (±  15 minutes) postdose and at 24  hours (± 2 hours)  
postdose. On Days 29, 64, 135, 183, and 279, postdose vital signs will be collected at 1 hour 
(± 30 minutes) and 6 hours (± 1 hour) postdose.  
… 
1314 HINE Sections  1 and 3 will be administered to participants with infantile -onset SMA, and a 
neurological examination will be performed in participants with later -onset SMA. On dosing 
visits, a A neurological examination will be performed at Screening;  predose, at 3 and 6 hours 
(± 15 minutes) postdose, and at 24  hours (± 2  hours) postdose , or when anesthesia/sedation (if 
used) has worn off on Days 1 and 15; predose and at 1 and 3 hours (± 30 minutes) postdose 
on Days 29, 64, 135, 183, and 279; and at Day 302/ET . Predose neurological examinations 
should be repeated when the assessment falls outside the protocol -specified window because of a 
delay in dosing.  
1415 ECGs will be performed predose, at 5 hours (±  1 hour) postdose, and at 24 hours (±  2 hours) 
postdose on Days 1 , and 15; predose and at 5 hours (± 1 hour ) postdose on Days , 29, and 64; 
at 5 hours (±  1 hour ) postdose  on Days 135, 183, and 279; and at Day 302/ET. Predose ECGs 
should be repeated when the assessment falls outside the protocol -specified window because of a 
delay in dosing. If a postdose ECG result is abnormal and clinically significant, a repeat ECG 
should be performed within 2 hours later.

9 On Day 1, postdose  Vvital signs will be collected at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours (±  15 minutes) 
postdose and at 24  hours (±  2 hours) postdose.  On Days 121 and 241, postdose vital signs will 
be collected at 1 hour (± 30 minutes) and 6 hours (± 1 hour) postdose.  
… 
13 HINE Sections 1 and 3 will be administered to participants < 2 years of age at the time of 
informed consent, and a neurological examination will be performed in participants ≥ 2 years of 
age at the time of informed consent. On dosing visits, a A neurological examination will be 
performed  at Screening;  predose, at 3 and 6  hours (±  15 minutes) postdose, and at 24  hours 
(± 2 hours) postdose , or when anesthesia/sedation (if used) has worn off  on Day 1 ; predose and 
at 1 and 3 hours (± 30 minutes) postdose on Days 121 and 241; and at Day 302/ET . Predose 
neurological examinations should be repeated when the assessment falls outside the protocol -
specified window because of a delay in dosing.

Rationale:  Postdose timepoints for vital signs, neurological exam ination s, and ECGs were 
revised to align with the change in the requirements for the [ADDRESS_113105] 2 dosing visits (i.e., Days 
1 and 15) with this protocol amendment, timepoints for these assessments at the subsequent 
study visits were reduced. Similarly, the footnotes in the Part C Schedule of Activities tables 
regarding timepoints for postdose  vital signs and neurological examinations were corrected to 
align with the 24 -hour inpatient stay occurring at the Day 1 study visit  only. In addition, 
 
 
This change also affects Table 4, Schedule of Activities for Part C Cohort 2.

6 Section 1.3 , Table 4: Schedule of Activities for Part C Cohort 2  
Change:  A schedule of activities table specifically for Part C Cohort 2 (Table 4) was added, 
given that this is exclusively focused on a different popul ation and therefore some assessments 
are different. Consequently, Table 3 was revised to correspond specifically to Cohort 1 of Part C. 
Table 4 is presented below. Major relevant changes affecting Tables 2, 3, and/or 4  include  the 
following : 
• Assessment s for vital signs, weight, growth parameters, and physical examination at 
Screening were  added to Part C (Cohorts 1 and 2) to align with the baseline data 
collected for Parts A and B.  
•  
 
 
• Flexibility to perform assessments up to 7 days prior to dosing at the maintenance 
dose visits was added for the following assessments:  PASA (Part 
B only) ; ACEND and PedsQL ( Part B and Part C Cohort 1 only );

5 For all participants, a blood sample will be collected to evaluate SMN1  gene status  (copy number, deletion, and mutation where necessary to confirm 
5q SMA) and SMN2  copy number by [CONTACT_2237]. For participants without acceptable documentation of these genetic testing results bef ore 
Screening, a blood sample must be collected during the Screening period to determine eligibility (preferably for analysis by [CONTACT_2237], but 
may be determined by [CONTACT_102153]). For participants with documentation of genetic testing results bef ore Screening or whose 
sample was analyzed locally during the Screening period (with documentation of these genetic testing results), a blood sample  will be collected 
(preferably at Screening, but must be collected by [CONTACT_48657] 121 visit) for confirmatory testing through the central laboratory . 
6 Eligibility based on scoliosis severity at Screening will be determined by [CONTACT_102060] X -ray results. Results of the central X -ray read will be

15 Blood chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis samples will be analyzed by a central laboratory. For the Screening visit only, a  local laboratory may be 
used for analysis instead if needed for timely treatment of the participant at the discretion of the Investigator. If a local  laboratory is used for the 
Screening visit, the samples should be collected on Day 1 for central laboratory evaluation (even if within 7 days of Screeni ng). These assessments may 
be performed up to 7 days prior to dosing/study visit, if necessary. Urine total protein will be analyzed by [CONTACT_102154] (Appendix B). Predose

15 Rationale:  This new schedule of activities table provides Investigators and other site personnel 
with guidelines for which samples and assessments need to be collected and performed for any 
participants in Part B of the study who discontinue study treatment but agree to return to the 
clinic for regular follow -up visits. These guidelines are intended to  streamline operation at the 
sites as well as ensure consistency in the data collected and reported. This change also affects 
Section 8.1, Discontinuation of Study Treatment.  
 
Section 3.1.2, Rationale for Dosing Regimen  
Change:  Language on steady -state exposures for the 12 mg dose (~5 ng/mL) vs. the higher dose 
(~12 ng/mL) of nusinersen was updated based on the most recent PK modeling data available.  
Now reads:   
An exploratory exposure -response analysis performed in participants with infantile -onset SMA 
(Study CS3A, n = 20, age 38  days to 8  months) showed a statistically significant positive 
correlation between nusinersen cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) exposure and motor function 
(e.g.,  CHOP  INTEND scores). Additional analyses in the same patient population from 
Studies  CS3A and CS3B (n = 80, age 30  days to 8  months) showed that the near steady state 
CSF exposure (approximately 10  ng/mL) closely approximated the model predicted 
concentration at 50% of the maximum observed biological effect (EC 50) using CHOP  INTEND 
(change from baseline) as the primary efficacy endpoint. These results suggest that additional 
clinical efficacy may be possible with increased nusinersen central nervous system (CNS) 
exposure. Und er the assumption of PK linearity, increasing the nusinersen dose to 24  mg, with a 
dosing frequency of 4 loading doses followed by [CONTACT_102155] 
4 months, should effectively increase the CSF trough concentration (C trough) at steady state to 
approximately 20  ng/mL.  This concentration  is comparable to the predicted concentration at 90%  
of the maximum observed biological effect (EC 90) from the infantile onset SMA population.  
Population PK modeling predicts that with increasing the nusinersen maintenance dose 
from 12 to 28 mg administered every 4 months, CSF C trough  should increase from 5 to 
12 ng/mL at steady state.  The exposure -response (PK/PD) relationship between steady -
state CSF trough concentrations and CHOP INTEND response  continuously increases as a 
function of PK , and is on an upward trajectory at concentrations consistent with the 12 mg 
maintenance dose. It is therefore predicted that additional clinical benefit (i.e., a 5 -point 
increase in CHOP INTEND score) could be achieved by [CONTACT_102156] 
12 ng/mL . This assumption is supported by [CONTACT_102069], which showed nearly dose -proportional PK in the plasma and CNS tissues (target site 
of action) up to 15  mg (human equivalent dose of 150  mg). It is important to highlight that the 
maximum response from the existing clinical data is limited because [ADDRESS_113113] dose 
administered in humans, and the majority of the dataset are within the CSF C trough range of 5 to 
15 ng/mL; therefore, extrapolation of the efficacy response above 20  ng/mL is not 
recommended. The PK/PD relationship has thus far been demonstrated primarily in the 
infantile -onset SMA population. However, the same positive PK/PD relationship is expected

16 across SMA types and patient age groups because they share the same disease mechanism. This 
is supported by [CONTACT_102157] 232SM202, which showed a 
positive relationship between CSF C trough and total motor milestones scores in participants with 
infantile - and later -onset SMA who received 12  mg of nusinersen as 4 loading doses followed by 
[CONTACT_102048] 4  months.  
Using 2012 ng/mL as the clinical CSF C trough target concentration and the predicted CSF PK 
profiles from 2428 mg of nusinersen ( 4 loading doses followed by [CONTACT_102048] 
4 months) as the reference dosing regimen, simulations were performed to evaluate additional 
dosing scenarios with higher doses and reduced loading -dose frequency. Additional evaluation of 
the maintenance dosing frequency was not performed because previous modeling showed that a 
dosing frequency of every [ADDRESS_113114] maintained the CSF concentration achieved at steady 
state.  
Assuming PK linearity, PK simulations were performed in both infantile - and later -onset SMA 
populations after 2 years of treatment using a population PK model developed from patients 
across the age range of ≤  [ADDRESS_113115] recent PK modeling performed, relative to the approved 12 -mg label 
regimen (CSF C trough  of approximately 5 ng/mL) , both 28 mg administered as 3 loading doses 
(biweekly) and or 50 mg administered as 2  loading doses (biweekly), each followed by 
[CONTACT_102052] 28  mg every 4  months, were identified to achieve the desired CSF C trough 
(approximately 2012 ng/mL) more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_101978] . Nusinersen 
28 mg administered as 3  loading doses (biweekly) had a comparable predicted CSF maximum 
concentration (C max) to the reference dosing regimen, whereas the 50-mg dosing regimen 
surpassed the predicted C max from the reference dosing regimen. Moreover, the 28 -mg 
maintenance dosing regimen adequately maintained the higher CSF C trough target 
(approximately 12 ng/mL) during the maintenance dose period. Toxicology studies in 
nonhuman primates evaluating the nonhuman primate equivalent of the [ADDRESS_113116] been conducted and support the safety of these doses in a clinical study  (see Section 3.3) . 
Therefore, the 28 -mg dose (administered as 3  loading doses at biweekly intervals), 50 -mg dose 
(administered as 2  loading doses at biweekly intervals), and 28 -mg maintenance dose were 
recommended for additional clinical evaluation.  
The single bolus dose in Part C is supported by [CONTACT_102070] a titration dosing 
regimen of a single loading dose (50  mg) followed by [CONTACT_102052] 28  mg every 
4 months thereafter achieved and maintained the higher CSF C trough target concentration 
(approximately 2012 ng/mL) in the representative populations for later -onset and infantile -onset 
SMA, respectively. The predicted exposures of the proposed titration dosing regimens are 
covered by [CONTACT_102158].  
Rationale:  Recent PK modeling data have revealed updated predicted steady -state exposures 
with the [ADDRESS_113117] version of the Investigator’s Brochure (V ersion 14). Importantly, the

17 PK/PD modeling continues to support that  higher dose s of nusinersen may lead to a clinically 
meaningful increase in efficacy. This change also affects Section 1.1, Synopsis.  
 
Section 3.3, Benefit -Risk Assessment  
Change:  The summary of the  toxicology studies of nusinersen in monkeys (Studies P058 -17-03 
and 396443 -AS06) was streamlined and updated  to include recent findings and interpretations of 
the results.  
Now reads:   
Nusinersen (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_101969]) 12 mg has a positive benefit -risk profile, with more than 34 years of 
postmarketing experience and more than 10,000 11,000  patients treated. The safety profile to date 
does not preclude study of higher doses in any population.  
Detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks, reasonably 
expected AEs, and nonclinical toxicology studies supporting investigation of higher doses of 
nusinersen in the clinic are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure and informed consent 
form (ICF). A high -level summary of the benefits and risks known during study design is 
provided here.  
Anticipating a potential enhancement of benefit with the dosing regimens proposed for 
Study  232SM203, substantiated by [CONTACT_31577]/PD modeling described in Secti on 3.1.2,  the safety of the 
loading period for Study 232SM203 is supported by a nonclinical study conducted in monkeys 
(Study  P058 -17-0503), with the dosing regimen matching with the most rigorous loading in 
Study  232SM203 (3 loading doses administered at 2 week intervals) . In this study, Tthe 
no-observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL) for Study  P058 1705 was determined to be 15 mg 
(human equivalent dose of 150  mg)., the high dose of the study, supported by [CONTACT_102159]/transient neurological clinical signs and 
histopathological findings in the brain and lymph node s. This NOAEL provides  As such, dosing 
for Study 232SM203 has a safety margin of at least 4.5 -fold for the loading doses (based on 
cumulative doses during the loading period ) and a 3 -fold margin for a single loading dose of 
50 mg . 
The safety of long -term exposure during the Study 232SM203 maintenance period is supported 
by a 53 -week monkey study (Study  396443 -AS06). This study implemented a more frequent 
dosing regimen than what is planned for Study 232SM203, [ADDRESS_113118] 29 days, followed by [CONTACT_102160] 8  doses given once every 6 weeks. Based on the 3 dose levels (0.3, 1, and 4  mg per 
dose) used in the study, for a duration of 53 weeks, the monkeys received a cumulative 
nusinersen dose of 3.9, 13, and 52  mg, respectively, at each dose level.  Monkeys received a 
cumulative dose of 3.9, 13, and 52 mg at each dose level (0.3, 1, and 4 mg per dose, 
respectively) during the 52 -week treatment duration . Factoring in a CSF volume scale of 
10 between humans and monkeys, the annual cumulative doses in monkeys from this study 
ranged from 3.0  to 7.2 fold (loading doses) and 6.2  to 14.4 fold (maintenance doses) higher 
Amendment Summary for Protocol 232SM203, Version [ADDRESS_113119] doses (1 and 4  mg). The overall no observed -effect 
level (NOEL) for the study was 0.3  mg, driven by [CONTACT_102161], while no 
effects in any other tissues were observed up to the high dose (4  mg) on a comprehensive 
histopathology evaluation.  The overall NOAEL was determined to be 4 mg.  PK scaling was 
used to estimate the nusinersen tissue concentration in patients with SMA during maintenance 
treatment at 28  mg from tissue concentrations measured in patients with SMA treated with 
12 mg of nusinersen (scaled from the tissue concentrations measured during autopsy of 
participants from Study CS3A).  Tissue concentrations measured in monkeys from the 53 -week 
toxicology study at the  NOEL  NOAEL (0.3 mg for the hippocampus and 4 mg for all other 
tissues evaluated ) were compared to the estimated tissue concentrations in patients with SMA. 
Based on these data, t  The exposure -based safety margin is at least 1.1fold1.4-fold based on 
exposure in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] (safety margins are higher for other tissues) . 
The potential risks related to participation in this study are justified by [CONTACT_102162].  
Detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected 
AEs of nusinersen is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure and informed consent form (ICF). 
A high level summary of the benefits and risks known during study design is provided here.  
Rationale:  These changes were made t o present the most recent data available on benefit -risk 
assessment relevant for this study and to align with the current version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure (V ersion 14).This change also affects Sections 1.1, Synopsis.  
 
Section 5.1, Study Overview  
Change:  The r equirement for inpatient stays for participants enrolled in Part B was limited to 
Day 1 and Day 15 only, with the option for inpatient stays at other visits based on the 
Investigator’s discretion.  
Now reads:   
Participants will remain at the clinic for at least 24 hours after each study treatment 
administration or sham procedure on Days 1 and 15; inpatient stays at other visits may occur 
based on the Investigator’s discretion. If the primary reason for the inpatient stay is due to 
an AE or SAE, reporting requirements per Section 11.[ADDRESS_113120] be followed . 
Rationale:  Inpatient stays may be burdensome to study participants and their families. The 
current safety data available support removal of the required inpatient stays after the loading 
period for the higher dose (i.e., 50 mg administered on Days 1 and 15). Investigators are still able 
to use their clinical judgment on a case -by-case basis to determine whether an inpatient stay may 
be beneficial for participants following the Day 15 study visit. If an Investigator decides to keep 
a participant at the clinic for follow -up beyond what is required per protocol, it is important that

19 the site personnel continue to report AEs or SAEs that occur during that time period as required 
by [CONTACT_4690]. This change also affects Section 1.1, Synopsis; Section 1.3, Schedule of 
Activities  (Table 2) . 
 
Section 6.1, Inclusion Criteria  
Change:  The inclusion criteri on for Part B regarding  gestational age was revised to allow for 
additional flexibility  if there are no complications due to prematurity and with approval by [CONTACT_5134]. The inclusion criteria for Part C were updated to specify the age and functional 
status requirements for enrollment into Cohort 2 of Part C.  
Now reads:  
Part B  
Participants with SMA symptom onset ≤  6 months (≤  180 days) of age (infantile onset)  
… 
13. Gestational age of 37 to 42 weeks for singleton births and 34 to 42 weeks for twins.  Infants  
with a lower gestational age may be considered for enrollment if there are no complications 
due to prematurity and approval by [CONTACT_102078].  
… 
Part C  
All Participants  
1. Signed informed consent of parent or guardian and signed informed assent of the participant, 
if indicated per participant’s age and institutional guidelines  
2. Males and females of any age (individuals ≥ [ADDRESS_113121] be ambulatory)  
3.2. Currently on nusinersen treatment at the time of Screening, with the first dose being at least 
1 year prior to Screening

nonambulatory)  
12. HFMSE total score ≥ 4 points at Screening  
13. RULM entry item A score ≥ 3 points at Screening  
Rationale:  The gestational age requirements for participants in Part B were revised to enroll 
children without complications due to prematurity because  some children with lower gestational 
age may still be eligible for the study . This is consistent with participants  who were  enrolled in 
Study CS3B , which may be used in some of the prespecified analyses to evaluate the higher 
dose.  
The age and functional status requirements at Screening for Cohort [ADDRESS_113123] 3 will enrich Cohort 2 with participants whose motor function abilities 
may enable greater potential to measure changes in efficacy with the higher dose.  
Section 6.2, Exclusion Criteria  
Change:  The exclusion criteria for Part B were revised as follows : 1) to add a criterion related to 
history of systemic hypersensitivity reaction to the  excipi[INVESTIGATOR_102025]; 2) to clarify that 
treatment with an investigational drug not specific for SMA is also exclusionary; and 3) to 
change the definition of “hypoxemia” for high -altitude study sites.  
The exclusion criteria for Part C were revised as follows : 1) to add a criterion related to history 
of systemic hypersensitivity reaction to nusinersen, the  excipi[INVESTIGATOR_102026], 
or to any diagnostic agents to be administered during the study; and 2) to exclude participants 
with severe scoliosis from Cohort 2.

without imaging.  
• Cobb’s angle >  40.0°: exclusionary for severe scoliosis  
• Cobb’s angle <  33.0°: not exclusionary for severe scoliosis

22 • For participants with a Cobb’s angle between 33.0° and 40.0°, inclusive, 
discussion with the Medical Monitor must occur before determining eligibility.  
Rationale:  Exclusion criteria were added to Parts B and C to exclude participants who may have 
a history of systemic hypersensitivity to nusinersen (Part C only), to the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_102027], or to any diagnostic agents that may be used as part of the 
study treatment administration procedure. Since Part B explicitly excludes prior exposure to 
nusinersen, it is impossible to identify a history of systemic hypersensitivity in those candidates.  
The criterion in Part B that excludes participants who received treatment with an investigational 
drug for the treatment of SMA within 30 days or 5 half -lives of the agent was broadened to 
include other investigational drugs not given for the treatment of SMA as well. This aligns with 
changes made to Section [IP_ADDRESS], Disallowed Concomitant Therapy.  
Lower oxygen levels at high -altitude study sites will drive down basal oxygen levels, so the 
original definition of hypoxemia in the protocol was not appropriate for high -altitude sites. The 
protocol was therefore updated to specify different definitions of hypoxemia based on altitude 
for participants with infantile onset SMA being screened for Part B of the study.  
The exclusion criterion for severe scoliosis for participants in Cohort 2 of Part C was added to 
align with Parts A and B of the study.  
This change also affects Section 1.3, Schedule of Activities  (Table 4). 
 
Section 6.3.2, Retesting and Rescreening  
Change:  The protocol was revised to a llow a full rescreening of participants who originally 
failed Screening, at the discretion of the Investigator.  
Now reads:   
During the Screening period, participants who have an out -of-range result that is not clinically 
significant can  may be retested 1  time only at the discretion of the Investigator within the 
Screening process, without the need for a repeat full Screening . The Screening period may be 
extended for up to 10  days for individuals who cannot complete the Day  1 Visit within 21  days 
of signing the ICF, as long as they continue to meet other eligibility criteria.  
Participants who fail Screening (see Section 6.3.3) may be rescreened once at the discretion 
of the Investigator. Participants who are rescreened will be assigned a new identification 
number.  
Rationale:  Potentially eligible study participants may have an acute ongoing medical condition 
that could lead to screen failure in the short -term, but after resolution could allow that participant 
to pass all Screening criteria. Protocol Version 4 does not specifically address  rescreening; it 
only addresses retesting. The protocol has been updated to allow retesting of an out -of-range

23 result  without repeating the full screening and  has been revised to clarify that each candidate 
may be rescreened once at the discretion of the Investigator. It was also clarified that any 
participant who is rescreened will need to be assigned a new identification number.  
Section 7.3.1, Nusinersen  
Change:  The study drug formulation language was revised to align with upcoming formulations 
that will be available for Study 232SM203.  
Now reads:   
Nusinersen will be supplied as specified in the DHA. The proposed new  study treatment is 
supplied as a formulation that contains 12 mg/mL  nusinersen, 0.034  mg/mL  sodium dihydrogen 
phosphate dihydrate, 0.111  mg/mL  sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous, 7.96 mg/mL  sodium 
chloride, 0.224  mg/mL  potassium chloride, 0.206  mg/mL  calcium chloride dihydrate, and 
0.163  mg/mL  magnesium chloride hexahydrate in water for injection, adjusted, if necessary, to a 
target pH of 7.[ADDRESS_113124] will be diluted at the clinical site with supplied artificial CSF diluent to enable ascending 
doses in the proposed clinical study, as described in the DHA.  Further details on drug 
preparation and administration may be found in the DHA.  
Rationale:  New formulations (i.e., ready -to-use kits) will be available and may be used at 
clinical sites for Study 232SM203. The language in Protocol Version [ADDRESS_113125] Investigator’s Brochure template update by [CONTACT_1034].  
Section [IP_ADDRESS], Disallowed Concomitant Therapy  
Change:  The protocol was revised to prohibit participation in any other interventional clinical 
studies (including those for non -SMA treatments) while enrolled in Study 232SM203.  
Now reads: Participants are prohibited from receiving other experimental or approved agents for 
the treatment of SMA, including gene therapy, SMN2 -splicing modifier,  biological agent, or 
device, during the study. This includes marketed agents at experimental doses that are being 
tested for the treatment of SMA (oral albuterol/salbutamol, riluzole, carnitine, sodium 
phenylbutyrate, valproate, hydroxyurea, etc.). In addition, participants will not be allowed to 
enroll in other interventional studies during Study 232SM203.

Participants with later -onset SMA will be evaluated using the PedsQL Measurement 4.0 Generic 
Core Scales and 3.0 Neuromuscular Module [Varni 1999]. This assessment has been validated 
by [CONTACT_102098][INVESTIGATOR_102028] [Iannaccone 2009].  
The PedsQL Measurement Model is a modular approach to measuring health -related quality of 
life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents. The PedsQL consists of brief, practical, generic core 
scales, as well as condition -specific modules for use in designated clinical populations. Pediatric  
Patient  self-report is measured in children and adolescents 5 to 18 25 years of age, and parent 
proxy -report of child HRQOL is measured for children and adolescents 2 to 18 25 years of age. 
Patient self -report and parent proxy -report are available for participants who are ≥ 26 
years of age for the Generic Core Scale.  The PedsQL  4.0 Generic Core Scales include an 
assessment of physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school 
functioning. The PedsQL 3.0 Neuromuscular Module was designed to measure HRQOL 
dimensions specific to children 2 to 18  years of age with neuromuscular disorders, including 
SMA.

Rationale:   
 
 
 
The description of the PedsQL was updated to clarify that the adults in Cohort 1 of Part C will be 
assessed with this scale and to provide more details regarding the scales available for participants 
up to age 25 and aged 26 years or older. The text clarifies  that participants in Cohort 2 of Part C 
will not be evaluated with the PedsQL.

Section 10.1, Clinical Safety Assessments  
Change:  Growth parameters were updated to allow for measurement of length for participants 
with later -onset SMA who are not able to have height measured. In addition, the requirements 
for measuring LP opening pressure were revised.  
Now reads: The following clinical assessments will be performed to evaluate the safety profile of 
nusinersen:  
• AE and SAE recording  
• Medical (including SMA) history.  
• Vital sign measurements: temperature, pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and pulse oximetry  
• Growth parameters: body length/height (for all participants ; body length will be 
measured for participants who are not able to stand independently ), head, chest, 
and arm circumference (for participants with infantile -onset SMA), and ulnar length 
(for participants with later -onset SMA) will be measured. Additional parameters of 
weight -for-age, weight -for-length, and head -to-chest circumference ratio will be 
calculated.  
• Neurological examinations: HINE Sections  1 and 3 will be administered to 
participants in Part B with infantile -onset SMA, and participants in Part C <  2 years 
of age at the time of informed consent. A neurological examination will be performed 
in participants in Parts A and B with later -onset SMA and participants in Part C 
≥ 2 years of age at the time of informed consent.  
• Physical examinations (videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_101972])

28 • Electrocardiograms (ECGs)  
• LP opening pressure: dDetails available in the DHA . LP opening pressure will be 
evaluated  for all participants in Parts A and C, but only for participants with 
later -onset SMA in Part B.  
• Concomitant therapy and procedure recording  
Rationale:  Protocol Version [ADDRESS_113127] height measured. Therefore, measurement of length is being 
offered as an alternative to height for these participants.  
The requirement to evaluate  LP opening pressure for the infantile -onset SMA population in Part 
B was removed . Measuring an accurate value for LP opening pressure is difficult in infants 
because the pressure can be elevated due to crying (increased intra -thoracic pressure increase) 
and posturing (intra -abdominal pressure increase) during the assessment. LP opening pressure 
values  in this patient population  would be varied and inconsistent. Furthermore, although 
sedation of infants could enable a  more accurate reading of LP opening pressure, infants are not 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_102029] (either in clinical practice or the clinical study). Requiring 
sedation purely for this purpose does not justify the risks introduced.  Therefore, the protocol has 
been revised to remove this assessment for the infantile -onset SMA participants in Part B, while 
retaining this assessment for all other participants in  the study . This is aligned with the PSUR 05 
PRAC recommendation and commitment to measure LP opening pressure in a clinical study 
with nusinersen to help further assess the important identified risk of hydrocephalus.  
This change also affects Section 1.3, Schedule of Activities  (Tables 2, 3, and 4 ). 
 
Section 14.1.4, Central Laboratories for Laboratory Assessments  
Change:  The requirements for SMA genetic testing were clarified , noting that all lab oratory  
samples collected from participants in China will be analyzed within China.  
Now reads:   
A central laboratory will be selected by [CONTACT_72888], blood chemistry, 
urinalysis, and CSF samples (except for local analysis of CSF protein, cell count, and glucose) 
collected for this study. Analysis of urine total protein, coagulation, pregnancy tests, and 
CSF protein/cell count/glucose will be conducted by [CONTACT_28130] .  
 will be analyzed at a laboratory selected by [CONTACT_1034] 
(Appendix B) . 
A blood sample will be collected at Screening for SMN2  copy number for those participants 
without acceptable historical genetic documentation of SMN2  copy number.  For all other  
participants, a blood sample will be collected during the study (preferably before or on the first

29 maintenance dosing visit) for the analysis of both  to evaluate SMN1  gene status ( copy number , 
and deletion /, and mutation where necessary to confirm 5q SMA) and SMN2  copy number by 
[CONTACT_2237].  For participants without acceptable documentation of these genetic 
testing results before Screening, a blood sample must be collected during the Screening 
period to determine eligibility (preferably for analysis by [CONTACT_2237], but may 
be determined by [CONTACT_102153]). For participants with documentation 
of these genetic testing results before Screening or whose sample was analyzed locally 
during the Screening period  (with documentation of these genetic testing results) , a blood 
sample will be collected (preferably at Screening, but must be collected by [CONTACT_102163]) for confirmatory testing through the central laboratory.  
Sample analysis for participants from China will be performed within China.  
Rationale:  The SMA genetic testing language was revised to further clarify for site personnel 
which samples need to be collected at specific times, as well as to further describ e the different 
methods of determining study eligibility (i.e., through acceptable historical genetic 
documentation prior to Screening for Study 232SM203 or through collection and analysis of a 
blood sample at Screening). In addition, in order to simplify analysis of the samples collected in 
China, the protocol was updated so that those samples could be analyzed within China , removing 
the need to export genetic material out of the country.  
This change also affects Section 1.3, Schedule of Activities  (Tables 2, 3, and 4) ;

Changes to the protocol are presented chronologically. New text is shown in bold type; deleted 
text is shown with a strikethrough.
Section 15.3, Monitoring of the Study
Change:  Language was added to the protocol regarding remote monitoring of study  sites during 
the global COVID -19 pandemic.
Now reads:  
The Site Monitor will visit the study  site at regular intervals during the study  and afte r the study  
has completed, as appropriate, or may  perform monitoring activities remotely  (where permitted 
by [CONTACT_427]) only during the COVID- 19 pandemic where on -site monitoring is not  
allowed per local/regional restrictions . A clinical site moni toring plan will detail who performs 
the monitoring, how often, and the extent of the review. I t also will provide the monitoring 
strategy , with emphasis on participant safety , data integrit y, and critical data and processes.
Rationale: This change was ma de to clarify  that remote monitoring may  be implemented only 
in the event that the COVID- 19 pandemic precludes on- site monitoring.

lab sample can onl y be measured and collected on Day s 1, 15, and 279 in Part B of 
Study 232SM203.
Now reads:
Table 2:       Schedule of Activities for Part B
Footnote 6: Only measure LP opening pressure and assess CSF local lab sample on Days 1, 
15, and 279 to avoid potential unblinding .
Rationale: In Part B, the Control Group (12/12 mg) will receive 4 loading doses of nusinersen 
on Day s 1, 15, 29, and 64 followed by  2 maintenance doses of nusinersen on Day s 183 and 279. 
The 50/28 -mg Group will receive 2 loading doses of nusinersen on Day s 1 and 15 followed by  
2maintenance doses of nusine rsen on Day s 135 and 279. I n order to maintain the blinding in 
Part B of the stud y, both the L P opening pressure and the local CSF analy sis will only be 
assessed at those visits where both groups are administered a dose of stud y treatment.
Section 1.3, Sc hedule of Activities
Change: The footnotes regarding stud y treatment injection in Tables 1, 2, and 3 were revised to 
clarify  the potential anesthesia and/or sedation options that may  be used for the L P procedure 
and to ensure that all participants in Part B would receive equivalent levels of anesthesia and/or 
sedation to maintain the blind.
Now reads:
Table 1:       Schedule of Activities for Part A
Footnote 46: Spi[INVESTIGATOR_101971], fluoroscopy, or similar techniques may  be used for the LP 
procedure, if deeme d necessary , but are not required. Anesthesia (local or general) and/or 
sedation may be used for the L P procedure, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or study  
center.
Table 2:       Schedule of Activities for Part B
Footnote 47: Spi[INVESTIGATOR_101971], f luoroscop y, or similar techniques may  be used for the LP 
procedure, if deemed necessary , but are not required. Local anesthesia and/or sedation may be 
used for the LP procedure in participants with infantile -onset SMA, and Aanesthesia (local 
or general) an d/or sedation may be used for the LP procedure in participants with later -onset 
SMA , at the discretion of the I nvestigator and/or study  center. If anesthesia and/ or sedation is 
used for the LP procedure for an individual participant with later onset SMA, i n order to 
maintain the blind, that participant will receive equivalent anesthesia and/ or sedation (according

5to institutional procedures) for all of the sham procedures and LP injections. Participants with 
infantile onset SMA will receive minimal sedation (i.e., a low dose of an anxioly tic) for the sham 
procedure, according to institutional procedures. For participants with infantile -onset SMA, L P 
injections/sham procedures may  not occur wi thin 72 hours after an immunization.
Table 3:       Schedule of Activities for Part C
Footnote 47: Spi[INVESTIGATOR_101971], fluoroscopy, or similar techniques may  be used for the LP 
procedure, if deemed necessary , but is not required. Local anesthesia and/or sed ation may be 
used for the LP procedure in participants < 2 years of age, and Aanesthesia (local or general) 
and/or sedation may be used for the LP procedure in participants ≥ 2 years of age , at the 
discretion of the Investigator and/or stud y center. For pa rticipants with infantile onset SMA, LP 
injections may not occur within 72 hours after an immunization.
Rationale: Although the benefit /risk ratio of general anesthesia in young participants does not 
justify  use in this study , some forms of sedation to reduce anxiety  may  be indicated and the 
protocol was clarified to allow sites to use these methods at their discretion throughout the stud y 
as long as it is consistently used in an individual participant for all visits in Part B to maintain 
blinding to dosing regimen.
This change also affects Section 7.4, Blinding Procedures.
Section 1.3, Schedule of Activities
Change: The footnotes regarding ECG monitoring in Tables 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_113134] 
the postdose ECG timing and address abnormal ECG results.
Now reads:
Table 1:       Schedule of Activities for Part A
Footnote 1012: ECG swill be performed predose, at 25 hours (± 15minutes1 hour ) postdose , and 
at 24 hours (±2 hours) postdose on Day s1, 15, and 29; at the Day 64 visit; , at 45 hours (± 30 
minutes1 hour ) postdose on Day s 15 and [ZIP_CODE] and 269; , at 24 hours (±2 hours) postdose at all 
dosing visits, and at EOS Day 302/ET . Predose ECGs should be repeated when the assessment 
falls outside the protocol -specified window because of a delay  in dosing. If a postdose ECG 
result is abnormal and clinically significant, a repeat ECG should be performed within 
2hours.

Footnote 1114: ECG swill be performed predose, at 25hours (± 15minutes1 hour ) postdose , and 
at 24 hours (±2 hours) postdose on Day  1,; at 5 hours (±1 hour) postdose on Days 121 and 
241; and at Day 302/ET and at 24 hours (±2 hours) after the Day 121 and 241 doses . Predose 
ECGs should be repeated when the assessment falls outside the protocol -specified window 
because of a delay  in dosing. If a postdose ECG result is abnormal and clinically significant, 
a repeat ECG should be performed within 2 hours.
Rationale: The ECG monitoring schedule in the footnote was clarified to align with the content 
presented in the Schedule of Activities table. The postdose ECG assessments after each dosing 
visit were modified to align with the expected  (i.e., 4 to 6 hours postdose). 
Additional details were added to clarify  that a clinically  significant finding on a postdose ECG 
should prompt a repeat assessment within 2 hours of the initial abnormal finding.
Section 1.3, Schedule of Activities
Change: Additional text was added to allow the participants to complete the Safet y Laboratory  
Tests prior to the dosing visit for Parts A, B, and C.
Now reads:
Table 1:       Schedule of Activities for Part A
Footnote 1113: … These assessments may be performed up to 7 days prior to dosing/study

10Rationale: The requirement to assess efficacy  twice prior to the fir st dose of study  treatment was 
added to establish a more stable baseline and to be consistent with historical studies for 
nusinersen.
Section 1.3, Table 1: Schedule of Activities for Part A
Change: A footnote was added to Table 1 in order to specify  that efficacy  assessments are not 
required to be performed on Days 1 and 15 for Part A , except in cases whe nthe Day  1 efficacy  
assessment is required for the second baseline measurement for HFSME and RU LM.
Now reads:

Footnote 21: During the loading period, the efficacy assessments will be performed on 
Day 29 predose only…
Rationale: A Day  1 predose motor assessment is unnecessary  in cases where the baseline has 
been established during Screening. The schedule for capturing efficacy  data during Part A of the 
study  was modified to reduce participant burden by  [CONTACT_102166] 15.
Section 1.3, Schedule of Activities
Change: A footnote was added to Table 1 and an existing footnote was modified in Table 2 in 
order to add windows for the predose efficacy  assessments required at the loading dose visits

18. Medical necessity for a gastric feeding tube, where the majority of feeds are given by 
[CONTACT_102168], as assessed by [CONTACT_102169]: The exclusion criteria related to the need for respi[INVESTIGATOR_102038] -onset SMA. Previous 
data from nusinersen treatment in patients with early -onset SMA suggest that participants who 
need these supportive measures may  still benefit from nusinersen treatment and are appropriate 
for inclusion in this trial. These criteria are consistent with the previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_102039] -onset participants (CS3B, ENDEAR).
Section 6.2, Exclusion Criter ia
Change: The participant’s position for the Screening X -ray in Part B was changed from supi[INVESTIGATOR_102040]/supported sitting for participants with later- onset SMA. Phy sical assessment of 
scoliosis was added for regions where X- ray use is regulated.
Now reads:

11.5.       Contraception Requirements
All female participants of childbearing potential and all male participants of reproductive age 
must ensure that highl yeffective contraception is used for the duration of the study . In addition, 
participants should not donate sperm or eggs for the duration of the stud yand for at least [ADDRESS_113142] dose of study  treatment.

For the purposes of the study , highl yeffective contraception is defined as the use of one of the 
following:
For females:
Female surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal ligation), where applicable, 
according to local guidelines.
…
Established use of oral, injected, or implanted progesto genonly hormonal methods of 
contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation
…
Rationale: Current safety  data on nusinersen do not suggest a risk to the fetus ;however, there 
are no data in humans. Because of the long half -life of nusinersen, a l onger requirement for 
contraception, equivalent to 5 half -lives of nusinersen, was included in the study by [CONTACT_102173].

Rationale:   These changes were made to clarify  that the primary  objective for Part B is to 
examine efficacy , as measured by  [CONTACT_102174]. The 
remaining assessments that will be used to evaluate the clinical efficacy  of nusinersen for
participants in Part B are secondary  endpoints related to a secondary objective , which also has 
been clarified . A separate table containing the objectives and endpoints for Parts A and C of the 
study  is added to emphasize the differences between Part B and Parts A and C,and to clarify  that 
safet y is the primary objective for Parts A and C.
This change also affects Section 12, Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size ;and 
Appendix A, Permanent Ventilation Definition Criteria: Acute Reversible Event.

9SUMMARY OF MAJOR CHA NGES TO THE PROTOCOL
Changes to the protocol are presented chronologically. New text is shown in bold type; deleted 
text is shown with a strikethrough.
Section 1.1, Sy nopsis
The sy nopsis was revised to reflect changes made throughout the protocol.
Section 5, Study  Design
Change:   Text regarding the I ndependent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) review of Part B 
safet y data was revised.
Now reads:  
Continued enrollment into Part B and Eenrollment into Part C will begin occur after a safety
review b y the IDMC of [ADDRESS_113148] available safet y and  data through 
Day 29 (in order to achieve [ADDRESS_113149] received 50 mg in the 50/28 -mg Group, 
while maintaining the blind), provided that no safety concerns are identified.
Rationale:   While it was originally intended that the IDMC review of the first 15 participants in 
Part B with Day  29 safety  and  data would determine whether enrollment in this part of the 
study  could continue, this has now been clarified in the protocol.
This change also affects Section 14.2.2, Independent Data Monitoring Committee.

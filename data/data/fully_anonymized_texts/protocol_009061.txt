1. Abstract  
a. Provide no more than a one page research abstract briefly stati ng the problem, the research 
hypothesis, and the importance of the research.  
The benefits of sport and recrea tional activities for the disab led are well recognized f rom the standpoint of 
health and quality of life.  Yet t here remains a lack of option s for most disabled pe ople, especially the young. 
Sailing is an attractive sport th at can be pursued at recreatio nal and competitive leve ls. We outline a pi[INVESTIGATOR_222583]-Access Sailing Simu lator system. This program is a good fit with 
our current Activity Based Restorative therapy practices, and w e expect that findi ngs will add to our 
understanding of recovery from sp inal cord injury and how to pr omote it. Participatio n in sailing by [CONTACT_222608], particularly in small sailboats, is widely r egarded as having positive outcomes on self-esteem 
and general health for the partic ipants.  However, a major hurd le for people with no exper ience of sailing, even 
those without disabilities, is the perception that sailing is e litist, expensive and dange rous. Real time “ride on” 
sailing simulators have the pot ential to bridge the gap between  dry land and on water sa iling. They provide a 
realistic, safe and easily supe rvised medium, in which non-sail ors can easily and syste matically learn the 
required skills before venturing on the water. The task of sail ing on a simulator can tak e place under specified 
conditions (eg wind strength) a nd be taught as individual compo nents (e.g. steering, sail tr imming) in a way that 
is not possible on the water where there is a large number of i nteracting variables. The individual components 
can then be brought together so that the novice sailor rapi[INVESTIGATOR_222584] a degree of competence that would take 
much longer on the water. The aim of this project is to establi sh protocols for effective use of a simulator by 
[CONTACT_222609] t hen to conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_56542] t est two hypotheses: (1) Tha t the use of the sailing 
simulator technology enables peopl e with spi[INVESTIGATOR_222585] a 
safe, non-threatening environmen t;  (2) Teaching patients with SCI to sail using simulator technology will 
provide them with a safe, effec tive introduction to a healthy, environmentally-friendly, lifelong sport and 
recreation that will ha ve measurable impr ovements on their phys ical health and psyc hological well-being, 
including their confidence (self- esteem), morale, and optimism about the future. In this  pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] [ADDRESS_267572] sailing maneuvers and navi gate competently a triangula r racecourse on the simulator’s display in [ADDRESS_267573] the opportunity to sail on 
the water with the assistance of the Downtown Sailing Club (DSC ), Baltimore; however, t his is not part of the 
formal pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], which is aimed primarily at determining the  optimum use of a sailin g simulator for training 
purposes.  The information from t his pi[INVESTIGATOR_222586] t o formulate a future more comprehensive study, 
which will include a major on wat er component in collaboration with the Downtown Sailing Club.

[INVESTIGATOR_222582]:   [ADDRESS_267574] two hypotheses: 
 
Hypothesis 1: That the use of the sailing sim ulator technology enables people  with spi[INVESTIGATOR_222587] t he water in a saf e, non-threate ning environment. 
Hypothesis 2: That learning to sail by [CONTACT_222610][INVESTIGATOR_222588] a stage where they are competent to 
begin to sail on the water in mod erate conditions (wind strengt h up to 12 knots) show s measurable 
improvements on their physical health, quality of life, morale,  self-esteem, and s elf confidence. 
 
Specific Aims:  
Aim 1: To use novel technology in the form of a real-time physical sai ling simulator to enhance the 
effectiveness of a spi[INVESTIGATOR_222589]. 
Aim 2: To investigate what positive outco mes in terms of physical and psychological well-being are 
demonstrable when a person i s using the simulator. 
Aim 3: To investigate a person’s percep tion of their point of readines s to transition to the water from sailing 
simulation and how this compares w ith the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s assessmen t of a person’s point of readiness. 
 
Deliverables  
1: A detailed protocol for the use of sailing simulators to prepar e people with disabilities to start sailing on the 
water. 2: A structured protocol for use  by [CONTACT_222611] p eople with disabilities who enter sailing by 
[CONTACT_222612],  rather than via initial sail ing simulator experience. 
 
2. Background  
a. Briefly describe pre-clinical and clinical data, current exp erience with procedur es, drug or device,  
and any other relevant information to justify the research.  
Participation in sailing by [CONTACT_222613] e with disabilities, particula rly in small sailboats is wi dely regarded as having 
positive outcomes on the self-est eem and general health of the participants. There is evidence that there are 
psychological benefits  of virtual reality s ystems for patients in rehabilitation thera py (Chen et al, 2009). In 
addition, sailing is a family r ecreational activity; learning t o sail will improve family relations and reintegration 
into the community.  For the com petitively minded, the worldwid e organization Sailability World, Inc. 
(www.sailability.org ) promotes sailing for the disabled. With suitably equipped sai lboats, the disa bled are able 
to compete on equal terms with the able-bodied. 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_222590] N ew Zealand have successfully use d this simulation tec hnology to introduce people 
with severe disabilities to s ailing on dry land, with successfu l transfer to on water com petitive and recreational 
sailing.  One patient competed in a World Champi[INVESTIGATOR_222591] [ADDRESS_267575] Injury’s 
therapy staff are sailors and als o volunteer at the program.  S ome of our patients have a lready participated in on- 
water sailing at that venue.  We will include Kennedy Krieger s taff coaching sessions given by [CONTACT_222614] 01

in the sport. 
 
 
3. Study Procedures  
a. Study design, includi ng the sequence and timing of study procedures 
(distinguish research procedures from those that are part of routine care).  
This is a within subject pi[INVESTIGATOR_222592] 20 ch ronic (more than 6 months) SCI patients as per 
recruitment matrix in Table  1.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_222593] p reliminary evidence w ith respect to both 
Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2 (s ee above).  Organization of a l arger trial is planned, the detail design of which 
will depend upon the outcomes fr om this study, and subjects wil l be recruited from individuals already 
undergoing rehabilitative interve ntions at the International Ce nter for Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35406] I njury (ICSCI) at the 
Kennedy Krieger Institute and near by [CONTACT_222615] ( Walter Reed, Baltimore VA). In addition to 
their already prescribed rehab ilitation regimen, the eligible s ubjects will engage in a virtual reality sailing 
program (VSail) once a week, 1h/session for 12 weeks.  The subj ects will be assessed using a battery of 
physical and neurological indicators before starting the traini ng (baseline), after 6 w eeks and 12 weeks of 
training, and at 6 and 12 months f ollowing the completion of th e training. During each training visit outcomes 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_222616] .  The study timeline is found i n Figure 1.

All activities will be conducted at Kennedy Krieger Institute a nd are supervised by [CONTACT_941] P rincipal Investigator. 
 
(1) Study Intervention:  
All activities will be conducted at Kennedy Krieger Institute b y a VSail trainer. 
 
While undergoing the virtual sai ling training, the subjects wil l use a VSail-Access simulator (Virtual Sailing, 
Melbourne, Australia).  The VSa il simulator will be set in the Access Dinghy mode. The VSail sailing 
parameters will be set to the subjects skill set and progressio n in the training pr ogram: wind speed from 
minimum (8 knots) to moderate s trength (14 knots), pneumatic ra ms (simulating the heeling of the hull) on or 
off. 
 
The subjects will be transferred t o the VSail cockpit and secur ed. Following the traine r’s instruction, the 
subject will sail the simulator around virtual courses displaye d on a computer screen, u sing a joystick to control 
the rudder angle and a mainsheet t o control the set of the sail . 
 
Training will be interrupted f or fatigue (17 or over on the Rat e of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale), signs and 
symptoms of Autonomic Dysreflex ia (headache, sweating, facial f lushing, goose bumps/pi[INVESTIGATOR_2657], 
irritability, crying, sudden and p rofuse sweating above injury level, intense head/neck t ingling), symptomatic 
orthostatic hypotension (dizzine ss, light headedness, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_26593], sudden vision loss, p rofuse sweating). 
Session will resume whe n symptoms resolve. 
 
All subjects will continue the ir already prescribed rehabilitat ion regimen as per clinical plan and indications.

4. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  
a. The rationale for choosing the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be used.  
The VSail-Access simulator (V irtual Sailing, Melbourne, Austral ia) is the first sailing simulator available for 
people with disabilities. 
 
The VSail simulator is a generic sailboat cockpit powered by a pneumatic ram and custom designed software. 
The sailor sails the simulator around virtual courses displayed  on a computer screen or  overhead display in the 
same way as a real sailboat on w ater (a tiller to control the r udder angle, a mainsheet to control the set of the sail 
and body position to control heeling of the hull). Electronic s ensors provide real time feedback to match the 
movements of the virtual sail boat displayed on the screen with those of the simulator. Sailors can select wind 
strength and conditions to suit th eir ability. The VSail-Access  simulator is a variatio n on the VSail where the 
cockpit is fitted with a seat based on the design used for Acce ss dinghies ( http://accessdinghy.org ). 
 
b. Justification and safety information if FDA approved drugs will be administered for non-FDA  
approved indications or if doses or routes of administration or participant populations are changed.

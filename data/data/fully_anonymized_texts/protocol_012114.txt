1.0 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
Barrett's Esophagus (BE) is a premalignant lesion which can lead to esophageal adenocarcinoma. This particular 
cancer is one of the most rapi[INVESTIGATOR_742131].1  Patients with BE are up to 
40 times more at risk of adenocarcinoma than in dividuals without BE.2    
 
Once diagnosed with BE, a patient enters a life -long surveillance program in which upper endoscopy 
(Esophagogastroduodenoscopy or EGD) with biopsy are performed to survey the progression of the Barrett's tissue 
to cancer.  For mo re than [ADDRESS_1014488] been evaluated for ablation of BE.  Elimination of BE 
and restoration of squamous esophageal lining has been demonstrated through ablation; however, no ablation 
technology currently provides the necessary attributes  for wide -spread adoption  into a community setting.  Current 
BE technologies  such as R adio Frequency A blation  (RFA)  suffer from 'usability' drawbacks such as the need for 
precise sizing, multiple deployment steps, intensive training for the physician  and l arge controller units. Even with 
these limitations, the market for these technologies is growing at a rate of 60% annually and has become the 
standard of care for certain BE patients.  
 
Similarly, patients with dysplasia developi[INVESTIGATOR_742132] -lined eso phagus are at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_742133] (SCC). In the West, these patients often have a history of smoking, alcohol, 
or rare associated risk factors. In the East, SCC is more common than adenocarcinoma arising in BE. Hence, the  
potential worldwide clinical impact of a safe and effective esophageal ablation system for precancerous neoplasia is 
an important consideration for further testing and development of this novel therapy.  
 
Cryoablation has been shown to cause cell death thr ough two distinct mechanisms.  The first is ice formation in the 
extracellular fluid matrix. This causes cells in that matrix to eject pure water which raises the salinity content of the 
cell which provides protection against intracellular ice formation by  [CONTACT_742157].  This 
action will induce apoptosis in some percentage of the cells is due to dehydration of the cell.  Generally, apoptosis 
(i.e., programmed) occurs at freezing temperatures warmer than −15˚C under controlled co oling rates.  The second 
mechanism is ice formation within a c ell.  This will typi[INVESTIGATOR_742134].  
 
Apoptosis is the typi[INVESTIGATOR_742135].  Apoptotic cell death does not induce a systemic healing 
response as the content s of the cell are coated with a membrane and are absorbed locally.  Necrosis of the cell 
occurs when the cell wall is ruptured.  The body interprets this as injury and acts appropriately to repair the area.i  
Because of the body’s response the cell necrosi s and the desire for replacement of normal esophageal tissue, C2 
believes this is the appropriate mechanism to ablate Barrett’s Esophagus.  
 
The CryoBalloon Focal Ablation System  (CbFAS ) is designed to address many of the limitations of ablation 
technologie s that have been listed .  The System has t hree main components – the delivery catheter with  balloon 
probe, a handle , and a small cylinder  containing the cryogenic fluid.   There is no capi[INVESTIGATOR_742136]  – the 
system is completely single -patient use.   The system utilizes one balloon  probe  for all sizes of esophagi.  Access 
for treatment is simplified as the system utilizes the working channel of the endoscope.  
 
The simplicity of the System allows for many potential benefits to the patient, the physici an, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Some of 
the benefits may include a shorter and safer procedure, an easier deployment minimizing the need for 
anesthesiology, and smaller inventory requirements and no capi[INVESTIGATOR_742137]:  Pleas e refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for more extensive background information and literature search

The System  has undergone ac ute and chronic animal testing. The testing was conducted to study the safety, 
deliverability and performance characteristics of the System.  The studies were conducted for the evaluation of the 
device in a normal pig esophagus at dimensions very similar to a human esophagus.  General follow -up time 
frames were either 4 days or 28 days . A summary of prior pre -clinical testing performed on the System is provided 
in the Investigator’s Brochure. A summary of the animal data is also included in the Appendix below.  
 
A clinical trial has been conducted to study the safety and performance char acteristics of a full-circumferential  
version of the CryoBalloon Ablation System.   The Investigator’s Brochure highlights the differences between the 
two devices with the major difference being that the Focal System ablates a far smaller area.  Data ha s been 
presented at the DDW 2012.  The abstract for the study is included in the Investigator’s Brochure with final result s 
not yet published .  Preliminary results show the full -circumferential system is safe and has good efficacy on the 
ablation of esophageal  mucosa.   
 
The CbFAS  device has been cleared by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration under K101825 . The device will be 
used in accordance with the manufacturer’s labeling under this protocol.   
 
The international single arm CbFAS trial conducted under the  original protocol for this study has been completed 
and the manuscript submitted to Endoscopy journal for publication.  See more detail on the preliminary results in 
separate attachment submitted.  In this multi center, prospective non -randomized trial [ADDRESS_1014489] -
cryoablation. Follow -up endoscopy was performed after 6 -8 weeks to assess the ablation response. Outcome 
parameters were incid ence of adverse events, pain, esophageal stricture formation, and ablation response by 
[CONTACT_742158]. Results: 56 ablations (10 with 6 -sec, 28 with 8 -sec, 18 with 10 -sec) were performed. Six ablations 
failed due to device malfunction (n=3) or other reasons ( n=3). Median (IQR) procedure time was 7 min (4 -10) min. 
No major adverse events occurred; six patients had a minor mucosal laceration requiring no intervention. Mild pain 
was reported in 27% of patients immediately after cryoablation and in 14% after 2 day s. After 6 -8 weeks no 
strictures had developed. Full squamous regeneration was seen in 6 [60%] of 6s -areas; 23 [82%] of 8s -areas,   
100% of 10s -areas).  These study results suggest that focal cryoablation of BE with the newly developed CbFAS is 
feasible, sa fe, and results in squamous regeneration in the majority of patients.  These results were recently 
published (Scholvinck et al, Endoscopy July 2015 – paper uploaded into eIRB separately)  
 
Furthermore, [CONTACT_742194] has treated  41 BE patients and 10 patients wi th esophageal squamous low grade and high 
grade dysplasia (neoplasia) within this study and more treated within the clinical cryotherapy program at Johns 
Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) with successful ablation in [ADDRESS_1014490]. Marcia Canto plans to continue this single center (industry sponsored) study to continue the evaluation of 
safety, effectiveness and [ADDRESS_1014491] -of-care at Johns Hopkins 
as well as elsewhere in the [LOCATION_002] and Europe (more references can be provided) .  More clinical trials are 
underway with expanded indications, including resistant Barrett’s esophagus (separate IRB submitted)..Copi[INVESTIGATOR_742138].

2.0 SUMMMARY DEVICE DESCRIPTION  AND USE  
The System has t hree main components – the delivery catheter with  balloon probe, a handle , and a small cylinder  
containing the cryogenic fluid.   Deployed through the working channel of an endoscope, the operation of the  
System  is very similar to the deployment of dilatation balloons.   The balloon is made of a conformable material.  
Once d eployed, the balloon is simultaneously inflated and cooled with cryogenic fluid delivered from the handle.  
Due to the conformability of the balloon material, no sizing procedure is required.  Additionally, one balloon can 
ablate a full range of esophagi ( approximately 20mm to 32mm in diameter).  Esophageal cells are ablated as the 
balloon comes into contact [CONTACT_742159] 15 seconds.  After ablation, the System is repositioned 
for additional ablation or withdrawn.  
 
Cryoballoon ablation system includes  
• CryoBalloon Focal Ablation Catheter (FG -1009) - Sterile single -patient use with a balloon at end of 
Catheter  
• CryoBalloon Focal Ablation Handle (FG -1012) - Single -patient use and battery -powered  
• CryoBalloon Ablation Cartridge (FG -1010) - Nitro us oxide, single -patient use  
• Sidecar External Working Channel (FG -1011)- Single -patient use  
Proposed System Benefits include the following:  
• Completely Disposable System  
o No investment in equipment  
o No service, maintenance or set -up of equipment  
o No special storage requirements  
 
• One-sized fits all balloon catheter  
o Minimize disposable devices necessary for procedure  
o Lower inventory costs  
 
• Minimal steps of operation  
o Shorter procedure times  
o Improve resource utilization  
 
• Working channel access of system  
o Less disc omfort to patients  
Potential move from than general or heavy sedation to conscious sedation  
 
Latest device improvements:  
Principle of pre -inflation and self -sizing  
The balloon pre -inflates and contacts the esophagus wall prior to the actual ablation. Pre -inflating the balloon 
against the esophagus creates an intimate contact [CONTACT_742160].  
 
The self -sizing feature of the balloon allows inflation to a ran ge of esophageal diameters without applying pressures 
beyond ~6 psi.  Concurrently, the inflation does not exceed beyond the esophagus inner diameter.  The self -sizing 
balloon concept is also similar to the Barrx™ Halo 360 Sizing Balloon, where it uses a 3 3.7mm non -compliant 
balloon and inflates it to over 4 psi in the esophagus to estimate the esophagus diameter.

prior written authoriza tion from C2 Therapeutics, Inc.  Description of change  
The system is composed of a catheter, a handle, and nitrous oxide cartridges – nitrous oxide is the cryogenic fluid 
used to  ablate unwanted tissue. The design of the catheter and the cartridge remain the same. The handle design 
has been improved to reduce the pre -inflation pressure within the balloon from ~6 psi to ~3 psi for a 50% decrease.  
Pressures during ablation are   ~[ADDRESS_1014492] gas has been modified from a mechanical 
valve to an electro -mechanical valve (solenoid).  Due to the solenoid valve change, balloon pressure during pre -
inflation and ablation can be more accurately controlled and decreased by [CONTACT_742161] 50%.  
Purpose of Change  
The principle of operation of the C2 ablation system is to inflate the ablation balloon against the esophagus wall.  
The self -sizing capability of the system is enabled by [CONTACT_3433] e low operating pressure within the balloon.  The pre -
inflation pressure may reach ~6psi, while the pressure during ablation is ~3psi; therefore, it is desirable to lower the 
pre-inflation balloon pressure be similar to the ablation pressure, which also mi nimizes potential damage to the 
esophagus. A pressure reduction of approximately 50% is benefitted by [CONTACT_742162].  An operating 
pressure of ~3 psi during pre -inflation and ablation is also lower than the 4+ psi, or approximately 25% lower tha n 
the Barrx™ Halo [ADDRESS_1014493] institutional practice.  The physician  will perform an upper endoscop y using an endoscope  
with a therapeutic channel to accommodate the CbFAS balloon and  to verify the treatment zone in the esophagus.  
Alternatively, a commercially available 510k -FDA approved accessory tube called the “sidecar”, can be attached to 
a standar d non -therapeutic channel upper endoscope (more commonly available in endoscopy units compared to a 
therapeutic endoscope) and the cryoballoon advanced through the “sidecar” as shown in the images below.

3.5 Informed Consen t, Screening , Enrollment , Treatment, and Follow -up 
3.5.1  Stage 1) Patient Informed Consent  
Written i nformed consent will be obtained prior to any study  driven tests or procedures.  
 
A member of the research team will approach the patient to obtain informed consen t. The background of 
the proposed study, the procedure, the follow -up schedule and all potential benefits and risks will be 
carefully explained to the patient.  The person obtaining consent  shall:  
 
• Avoid any coercion of or undue influence of subjects to pa rticipate . 
• Not waive or appear to waive subject’s legal rights . 
• Use language that is non -technical and understandable to the subject or his / her legal 
representative . 
• Provide ample time for the subject to consider participation . 
• Include dated signatures o f the subject or the subject’s legal representative and of the clinical 
investigator . 
• Ask whether the subject has any questions about the study.  
• Copy signed ICF and provide to patient.  
 
NOTE:  The process of obtaining  ICF will be documented.  
 
The subject  or his/her legal  representative must sign the ICF approved by [CONTACT_3452]’s IRB/EC prior 
to enrollment. If the investigational procedure is to be filmed for educational purposes, this must also be 
carefully explained to the patient.  An example  ICF is in cluded as Attachment C . 
 
During the initial screening phase, the Investigator will perform an initial evaluation of potential study 
subjects for study eligibility.  This initial screening phase may include review of existing patient 
information (review of medical history, medication,  etc.). 
For those patients that agree to participate in the study by [CONTACT_10109]/EC Approved  ICF, a baseline 
evaluation will be performed (see Table 2  for a schedule of assessments).  If the baseline evaluation 
requirements listed in Table 2  are available as part of the patient’s routine examinations and medical 
history, they may not need to be repeated after the patient’s IFC is obtained.  
Subjects must undergo the investigational procedure within the timeframes indicated bel ow:  
- Review of Medical History (within 7 days)  
- Review of medications taken (within 7 days)  
 
Since final eligibility cannot be determined until the time of the procedure, it is expected that some study 
subjects may not undergo the cryoablation procedure (e. g. narrowing  of the esophagus such that the 
endoscope cannot be advanced).   
Subjects are considered enrolled at the time of introduction of the CryoBalloon Focal Ablation device.  
   
3.5.2  Stage 2) The Treatment  
 
The treatment stage  begins at the time of the ab lation (endoscopy) procedure. Actual trea tment 
time will vary by [CONTACT_742164].   The treatment stage  will be as follows:  
CryoBalloon Focal Ablation System  Study   C2 Therapeutics, Inc.  
PROTOCOL# CP-0007/ Version:  [ADDRESS_1014501] is evaluated for the presence of strictures  (if present, the stenosis should not 
prevent advancement of a  therapeutic endoscope  or non -therapeutic endoscope with sidecar 
external channel ).  Locate and record the gastroesophageal  junction (top of gastric folds) by 
[CONTACT_742165].   
 
2. For Barrett’s esophagus patients:   
3. Locate, measure, and record t he depth of endoscope insertion at the most proximal 
circumferential extent of suspected columnar metaplasia.  Locate, measure, and record the 
depth of endoscope insertion at the maximum extent of suspected columnar metaplasia.  
Document the number, and lo calization (insertion depth of the endoscope and orientation in 
the endoscopic field) of  all BE islands.  Document the level of the diaphragmatic pi[INVESTIGATOR_742143] (length) of the hiatal/paraesophageal hernia.   
 
4. Provide photo documentation of the ent ire Barre tt's segment by [CONTACT_742166]’s epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]. Endoscopic enhancements such as narrow band imaging 
should be performed to improve BE mappi[INVESTIGATOR_742144].  
 
5. For esophageal squamous dysplasia patients:  
6. Locate, measure, and record the depth of endoscope insertion at the most proximal 
metaplasia.   Document the number, size (maximum  and minimum diameter) and localization 
(insertion depth of the endoscope and orientation in the endoscopic field) of  all squamous 
dysplasia le sions . Document the level of the diaphragmatic pi[INVESTIGATOR_742145] (length) of the 
hiatal/paraesophageal hernia.  
 
7. Provide digital videorecording and photo documentation of the entire esophagus (performed  
part of standard procedure documentation on EndoPro softw are, Pentax Medical Corporation)  
involved by [CONTACT_742167] . When possible, high definition videoendoscopes 
should be used for treatment and follow -up procedures. Endoscopic enhancements such as 
narrow band imaging  and Lugol’s chromoendoscopy (standard image enhancement 
techniques) should be performed to im prove mappi[INVESTIGATOR_742146]. 
When Lugol’s chromoendoscopy is performed, the endoscope channel must be flushed with 
60 cc of water before passage of the cryoballoon to minimize staining of the balloon with dye.  
 
For all Subjects:  
 
8.  The cryoablation will be performed to potentially treat all BE  and squamous dysplasia , 
preferentially  treating distal to proximal in a circumferential fashion . The goal would be to treat 
the entire BE area with 24 ablations or less during outpatient endoscopic treatment session.  
 
9.   All cryoablations will be preferentially performed with 10 seconds per si te, but dosing can be 
adjusted to 5, 6, 8, 10 or 12  seconds according to the physician’s judgement based upon 
degree of overlap with other ablations.  
 
For BE patients: Additional “touch -up” [ADDRESS_1014502] cryotherapy 
immediate tissue effects (erythema corresponding to vascular congestion/thrombosis).  
 
For esophageal squamous dysplasia patients, the unstained esophageal mucosa after Lugol’s 
chromoendoscopy (“Lugo l’s voiding lesions or LGLs”, which correspond to dysplastic mucosa 
not taking up the dye) will be targeted.  
 
 
10. The Cryoballoon Ablation Catheter is introduced inside either the accessory channel of the 
therapeutic endoscope , or the external working channel .  The catheter is positioned and the

prior written authoriza tion from C2 Therapeutics, Inc.  ablation performed inside the identified area of BE.  The use of CryoBalloon Focal Ablation 
System is in conformance to the IFU.   
 
11. Document the location of the top and bottom of the ablation zone  (insertion depth of t he 
endoscope and orientation in the endoscopic field) . This is done by [CONTACT_742168], photo 
documentation and /or by [CONTACT_742169] ( of the ablated area). Placing a tattoo at 
the top of the ablation zone  is optional to further identify the exac t location of the ablation 
zone.   Document the location of the tattoo (insertion depth of the endoscope and orientation 
in the endoscopic field) .   
 
12.  Up to 5 outpatient ablation endoscopic procedures can be performed 8 -12 weeks apart per 
patient (up to 2 4 per procedure) to achieve complete ablation of dysplasia. This treatment 
schedule is comparable to that for other standard endoscopic ablative techniques, such as 
radiofrequency ablation and carbon dioxide cryotherapy  
 
3.5.3  Stage 3) Patient Follow -up 
 
 The fol low-up period b egins immediately post -procedure.  T he patient will undergo a follow -up 
assessment immediately post -procedure / prior to discharge. The patient will undergo a safety 
phone contact [INVESTIGATOR_136] 1 days (±1 days) , 8 (±1 days) days, and [ADDRESS_1014503] trea tment.  Assessment of 
pain score (0 -10 Likert scale), dysphagia score (0 -4), odynophagia, diet, medications (including 
narcotic analgesics) will be performed using a standardized questionnaire.  
  
 
3.5.4  Stage 4) Follow -up Endoscopy ( 8 to 12 weeks ) 
A high definiti on diagnostic scope can be used during the Follow -up Endoscopy stage unless 
warranted by [CONTACT_76404].  If there is endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_742147] -up procedure, this visit will become a treatment visit a nd cryoablation can 
be performed.  
 
The Follow -up Endoscopy stage  will be as follows:  
 
1. Locate and record the gastroesophageal junction  (top of gastric folds)  by [CONTACT_742170] .  Locate, measure, and record the depth of endoscope insertion at the most proximal 
circumferential extent of suspected columnar metaplasia.  Locate, measure, and record the 
depth of endoscope insertion at the maximum extent of suspected columnar metaplasia  or 
squamous dysplasia . Document t he number, localization (insert ion depth of the endoscope 
and orientation in the endoscopic fiel d) of all BE islands.  
 
2. Document the location of the top and bottom of the ablation zone (insertion depth of the 
endoscope and orientation in the endoscopic field). This is done by [CONTACT_742171] (of the ablated area).  
 
3. Evaluate the presence of stenosis  at the treatment zone .4 
 
4.  A biopsy (ies) will be performed  according to standard of care, with targeted biopsies 
sampled from visible m ucosal lesions and 4 -quadrant random biopsies obtained from the 1 
cm distal to the GEJ, the GEJ and every 1 cm proximal to the Z line, or the extent of the 
original BE or squamous dysplasia . The sample(s) will be collected and submitted as standard 
of care  to Johns Hopkins pathology Thereafter, a representative photo of the biopsy site is 
taken.  
 
4 Stricture formation is defined as none, mild (non -circumferential stenosis allowing easy passage of diagnostic endoscope), moderate (circular 
stenosis allowing passage of diagno stic endoscope), and severe (any stenosis preventing the passage of a diagnostic scope).

3.6.7  Device Malfunction or Failure  
A Risk Analysis was performed by C2 prior to the start of this study .  Potential risks were identified and measures taken to reduce the chances 
for occurrence of each.   
 
Additio nally, P erforma nce Testing of the System  was conducted in accordance with C2 ’s standardized  testing procedures to demonstrate 
adequate device perfo rmance. The combination of the Risk Analysis and the Performance Testing allowed for risks to be identified, performance 
of the device confirmed, and potential device malfunctions minimized.  Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure  Attachment A  for additional details.  
 
NOTE:  All A dverse Events (AEs)  will be followed to resolution.  A patient may not be exited from t he study until all AEs are resolved or stabilized 
and an outcome determined.    
 
3.7 Study Withdrawal  
Subjects may be terminated or withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:  
 
• Subject death . 
• Voluntary withdrawal – meaning that subject voluntarily choos es not to further participate in the study . 
• Loss to follow -up – meaning that the subject is  or does not return for further follow up .

Do not copy, distribute, or share wi th others without prior written authoriza tion from C2 Therapeutics, Inc.  NOTE: For those patients considered lost to follow -up (meaning at least [ADDRESS_1014510] the patient are documented  and are unsuccessful), the 
site will, at a minimum, make a concerted effort to confirm that the patient is not deceased (e.g., active search of death in dices will be performed to 
ensure the patient remains alive).   
 
Any study subject who does not partici pate in a scheduled follow up assessment should be contact[CONTACT_742177] p ersonnel to determine the reason .  The 
reason should be determined and documented in the patients stu dy records.  If the missed assessment  was due to an adverse event (AE), an AE Case 
Report Form (CRF) must be completed and any reporting requirement met.  
All subjects enrolled (including those withdrawn or lost to follow -up) shall be accounted for and documented.  
4.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse events (AEs) may occur during the procedure  or during the follow -up phase.  AEs occurring prior to the procedure will be documented in the 
patient’s medical record but will not count as related to the investigational device or procedure.   See the Reporting of AEs section for reporting 
timelines.   
Each AE will be recorded in the corresponding patient’s Case Report ( CRF).  Each AE will be judged by [CONTACT_742178]/or investigational procedure.  In addition, the Investigator will identify the date of onset, severity and duration.  
All AE will be monitored until they are adequately resolved or explained.   
 
5.0 RISK – BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
Upper endoscopy is standard of care for the evaluation of patients who present with foregut symptoms . The risk of participation in this study is similar to that 
which would be expected from these procedures were the patient not in the study. The most common risks are associated with th e introduction of the 
endoscope and tissue sampling  include sore throa t, less commonly prolonged bleeding from the sampling site and very rarely injury to the esophagus or 
stomach that would require surgical repair.  The risks associated with the sedation used during endoscopy include local bruising or pain at the IV site,  allergic 
reaction to the medications and over sedation requiring sedation reversal medications and longer post -procedure observation . All patients undergoing 
endoscopy are monitored with continuous pulse oximetry and vital signs assessment during the procedu re. Medications used for conscious sedation are 
careful ly titrated and monitored based on the patients' arousal levels and vital signs.   
 
Anticipated observations and complications are outlined  in 5.2.

5.3 Minimization of Anticipated Risks  
All effort s will be made to minimize these risks by [CONTACT_742179], selecting investigators who are experienced and skilled in endoscopic procedures , 
clearly defining eligibility criteria to ensure that only the appropri ate patients are enrolled and by [CONTACT_742180] -up of the patient 
are consistent with current medical practice.  
 
Risks are further minimized due to:  
• The use of medical grade materials that have a long history of use and have been ch aracterized and tested to assure biocompatibility.   
• Biocompatibility testing has been performed and the results were determined ac ceptable.  
• Pre-clinical evaluation including bench testing, analytical testing and animal studies.

9.0 DEFINITIONS AND AC RONYMS  
Adverse Events  
 
Adverse Event  (AE) - any untoward medical occurrence in a subject (ISO [ZIP_CODE] )   
 
NOTE:  This definition does not imply that there is a relationship between the adverse event and the device under investigati on. 
 
Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  - an adverse event that (ISO [ZIP_CODE]):  
• led to a death,  
• led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject,  
• resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury,  
• resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function,  
• required h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to body structure or function,  
• Or led to fetal distress, fetal death, a congenital abnormality, or birth defect.  
 
Adve rse Device Effect  (ADE) - any untoward and unintended response to a medical device ( ISO [ZIP_CODE] ). 
 
NOTE: This includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for use or the deployment of  the device.  This 
definition also  includes any event that is a result of user error.  
 
Serious Adverse Device Effect  (SADE) - an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse 
event or that might have led to any of these consequences if suitable action had not been taken or intervention had not been made or if 
circumstances had been less opportune (ISO [ZIP_CODE]) . 
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  (UADE)  - any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or  death caused by, 
or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or  application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any o ther unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects (21CFR812.3.s) and (ISO [ZIP_CODE] ). 
 
NOTE: The occurrence of a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a pre -existing condition, unless  the condition becomes more severe or 
increases in frequency, would not be considered procedure or device -related.

Do not copy, distribute, or share wi th others without prior written authoriza tion from C2 Therapeutics, Inc.  The safety and effectiveness of the System used to deliver superficial freezing to the esophageal mucosal tissue was evaluated in  a domestic 
swine (n=15, # of ablations = 47 for FG -1000 and n=10, # of ablations = 54 for FG -1003).  The normal swine esophagus is  very similar in 
dimensions to a human esophagus.   The swine were treated with the System by [CONTACT_742190] (3 -15 seconds) of 
cryogen refrigerant (liquid nitrous oxide or  N 2O) through the wall of the System balloon probe at lo w balloon pressure The N 2O is completely 
contained within the System balloon probe.  
 
Additionally, C2 conducted animal experiments to study the safety, deliverability and performance characteristics of the Syst em.  The non -
clinical studies were conducted using general animal facility protocols for the evaluation of devices in a normal pig esophagus at dimensions 
very similar to a human esophagus.

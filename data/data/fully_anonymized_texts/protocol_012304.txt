Study duration  1) For each subject, study duration will be approximately 30 days, including study 
follow -up.   
2) Anticipated start date:  July 2016 ; Anticipated  stop date :  September 2016.   
Investigational product  Venus Viva ™ SR system is intended for dermatological procedures requiring 
ablation and resurfacing of the skin.  
SCR Complex™  contains human growth factors and cytokines derived through 
laboratory culture of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.  It is 
indicated f or use immediately following and for the first few days of the acute 
healing phase after treatment with the Venus V iva™  device.  
Bio Cel™  is a botanical lipid -based gel occlusive . It is indicated for use as an 
occlusive barrier following ablative and semi -ablative  skin treatments, regardless 
of modality.  
Planned number of 
participants  A total of up to 100 evaluable male or female subjects (Fitzpatrick Skin types I – 
VI) will be enrolled . Subjects will present with acne scars, general skin texture 
irregularities and/ or rhytides.  
Study objectives  Clinical evaluation of the tolerability of using a post -treatment topi[INVESTIGATOR_847118] ™ 
SR system.  
Key Inclusion Criteria   Male or non -pregnant, non -nursing female at least 21 years of age and less 
than 75 years of age.  
 Undergoing a dermatological procedure requiring ablation and resurfacing of 
the facial skin utilizing the Venus Viva™ SR system.  
Key Exclusion Criteria    Superficial metal or other implants in the treatment area.

before complete healing.  
Primary endpoint  The primary end point will be the tolerability of the application of the stem cell 
recovery complex (SCR Complex™) and a botanical lipid based occlusive (Bio 
Cel™) as compared w ith standard of care immediately following fractional RF 
treatments.    
Secondary endpoints  The secondary outcomes will be the subject’s degree of discomfort and/or pain as 
measured by [CONTACT_847148] (VAS), the incidence of  spontaneous 
adverse event s (AEs) and the investigator’s assessment of improvement using 
the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis Scale scores before and after treatment as 
well as the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) for each subject . 
Statistical M ethodology  All subjects who received any amount of treatment will be included in the report.  
The primary outcome measure is the subject’s overall tolerability of the adjuvant 
combination treatment as compared to the standard of care post fractional RF 
treatment. The  self-assessment will be based on a [ADDRESS_1177937] 
Tolerability Scale (Appendix A). Summary statistics will be generated for subject 
tolerability immediately after treatment, 24 hours and 72 hours following 
treatment as per the terms:  Very  tolerable, tolerable, having no opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], 
intolerable and very intolerable.  
Summary statistics will also be generated to present the  degree of discomfort

Radiofrequency (RF) devices  are safe and effective.  The RF energy is delivered to the skin in a 
chromophore non -specific manner, heating the underlying dermal tissue at different levels. This heat 
results in a wide range of mechanisms from stimulation to ablation. The RF Scan deliv ers RF energy 
in a non -homogenous fractional form, selectively heating the dermis while protecting the overlying

cells that accelerate and promote the healing process.  
SCR Complex™ : The cells of our bodie s communicate with one another  using a complex bio -
molecular language.  Growth factors and cytokines are the "words"  that control embryogenesis, 
growth, immunologic defenses, and  tissue healing.   Of the more than [ADDRESS_1177938] as commander -in-chief of healing in all 
tissues, including skin. These cells are mobile, migrating from the bone marrow into the blood stream 
where they gain access to all parts of the body.   When they encounter  injury,  they serve as  smart 
local "drugstores", secreting pro -healing anti -inflammatory bio -signals. The  number of these cells 
plummets with age, accounting in large measure for the less robust healing of later decades.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_847121].  
Because aging skin is injured skin, some benefit ha s been seen with  the topi[INVESTIGATOR_847122] -signal products in  anti-aging formulations. Improvement  has also been seen 
when used with  dermal needling, and with fractional CO2 laser resurfacing in which "downtime" has

A boron -based molecule (hydrogen orthoborate) adds analgesic, anti -inflammatory, and 
bacteriostatic benefit.  Tocopherol acetate (vitamin E) helps reduce ery thema, edema, and acts as

4. PURPOSE  
The purpose of the study is to compare  the tolerability of the application of a combination of a serum 
containing human bone marrow stem cell derived growth factor and cytokines (SCR COMPLEX™) 
and a botanical lipid -based occlusive (Bio Cel™) immediately following fractional RF treatment using 
the Venus Viva™ v ersus standard of care.

dry off completely  between each use . 
10.2 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_847128] ™ contains human growth factors and cytokines derived through laboratory culture of 
human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Science recognizes these cells as "commander in 
chief" of healing in all tissues. These are migratory cells that "patrol" all tissues via the blood stream. 
In culture they produce patterns of growth factors and cytokines that are pro -healing and anti -
inflammatory. Their numbers plummet with age so that by [CONTACT_654] 50 only 4% of the relative number at 
birth remains . Additional recombinant technology derived growth factors help promote fetus -like, non -
fibrotic, anti -inflammatory healing.

 Test spot  
Test Spot  
In order to assess tolerability to treatment, up to three test spots will be performed on the area 
adjacent to the ear on the side of the neck close to the back (so as it is not visible).  Test spots should 
be based on skin type and desired outcome as per the chart below.  The test spots will be used to 
determine the optimal parameters / setting combinations prior to the first treatment and later, the 
second treatment.   
o Following the test spot, wait to ensure that the chosen parameters indeed lead to the 
appropriate immediate response.  
 
  
  
Version 5.0  October 18 , 2016  Confidential  – CS0116  Page 11 of 28 o If slight erythema and edema and no adverse events occurred, treatment should be continued 
using the same setting or increase by [CONTACT_847152] ~10% parameters for each session.  
o If no results are observed, the treatment par ameters should be increased.  
o If the patient has experienced adverse events along with improvement, the treatment 
parameters should be decreased.  
o Fine-tuning of the parameters can be done before proceeding to treat the entire sub -area with 
the chosen parame ters. Modification of parameters per treated area within a treatment 
session should only be carried out if required due to safety concerns.  
 
Assessment of the test spot will be performed following at least [ADDRESS_1177943] spot and treatment parameter chart

side of the neck close to the back (so it is not visible). Test sports should be based 
on skin type and desired outcome as per the chart above.  A test spot should be 
performed at the energy settings recommended in the chart above.  
It is recommended that each subsequent treatment you increase the total % of energy 
no higher than 10% for each session.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_1177945] will be enrolled and scheduled for two treatments, three weeks 
apart and return for a follow -up visit three days after the seco nd treatment for evaluation of the 
treatment area.   
The following procedures and assessments are required at the treatment visits:  
Pre-treatment  
 Confirm continued eligibility regarding inclusion/exclusion criteria  
 Review any changes in medication, health status or AE from last visit  
 Assessment of adverse events including a photograph of the affected treatment area if an 
adverse event occurred  
 Assessment of concomitant medications  
 Assign randomiz ed treatment  (after 1st treatment visit only)  
 Apply a topi[INVESTIGATOR_847134], if required.  (If used, record in 
the CRF.)  
 
Treatment  
No lotion, gel or coupling medium is to be used in this treatment.  The distal part of the applicator 
should be clean and dry before fitting it with a ne w 160 pi[INVESTIGATOR_847135]. The skin in the treated area should 
also be cleaned well (for removal of any lotions, make -up residues, topi[INVESTIGATOR_63767] , etc.) 
and patted dry. Hairs that exist in the areas should be shaved off.  
 Treatment should be performed while  the subject is lying down comfortably; the operator should 
have easy access to the subject’s treatment area.  
 Areas of dental crowns, caps, braces, or other metal dental implants may be more sensitive to 
treatment and the clinician may use dental rolls, ga uze or a tongue depressor to isolate the area 
and make the treatment more comfortable (if the face is treated).  
 Treatment of subjects in hair -bearing areas may result in some damage to the follicles and 
subsequent loss of hair. Avoid the beard area (if face is treated) and other hair growing zones if 
the patient doesn’t  wish to have reduction of the hair growth.  This treatment may also result in in -
grown hairs.  
 The applicator should be held perpendicular to and in close contact [CONTACT_8124].  
 Pressing the trigger will release the RF energy to the skin, creating a stamped imprint in a shape 
and intensity depending on energies.  
 
  
  
Version 5.0  October 18 , 2016  Confidential  – CS0116  Page 13 of 28  The immediate responses, indicative of the desired effect, are erythema and edema in the 
immediate area of the stamp and possibly al so around it. The edema usually appears [ADDRESS_1177946]-treatment and reaches its peak (of up to moderate edema) within [ADDRESS_1177947] in these subjects.  
 Treatment consists of a single pass over the designated area.  
 Unless otherwise instructed, the energy parameters can be modified between  the treatment visits, 
as per the Investigator’s discretion.  
 It is recommended that throughout the study, that one staff member administer the treatments 
and another staff member perform the evaluations of the treatment area.  
 
Post Fractional RF Treatment  
 Subject Discomfort Assessment  recorded on a 100mm visual analogue scale ( VAS) immediately 
post treatment.  
 Subject Tolerability Scale  immediately post treatment.  
 Subjects will receive either the adjuvant combination treatment ( SCR Complex™  followed by [CONTACT_847153]™ occlusive gel applied to the treatment area ) or SOC ( no topi[INVESTIGATOR_847136] [ADDRESS_1177948] fractional RF treatment).  
 Subjects will be asked to complete the Subject Home Tolerability Scale at [ADDRESS_1177949]-treatment  
 Subjects will be provided with the Subject Home Instruction She et (Appendix B).  
 A follow -up telephone call will be made to the subject [ADDRESS_1177950] to report on the treatment 
using the Self-Report Adverse Event Questionnaire (Appendix C) and remind  the subject to 
complete and return to the clinic with their completed Subject Home  Tolerability  Scale  at each 
visit.   
 
11.3 Follow -up/Termination Visit  
Subjects will be scheduled for a follow -up/termination visit 72 hours after the second treatment.  
The following procedures will be performed:  
 
 The subject will be asked to report on the comfort(s)/discomfort(s) associated with the second 
treatment as per the Self -Report Adverse Event Questionnaire.  
 Wrinkle evaluation (Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis Scale)  
 Global Aesthetic Improvement (GAI) Scale (Appendix D) as evaluated by [CONTACT_093].  
 Subject Tolerability Scale [ADDRESS_1177951] second treatment  
 Assessment of concomitant medicat ions

reason for early termination will be recorded in the CRF.  Subjects will also be asked to return to the 
clinic to complete follow -up/termination vis it procedures.  
 
  
  
Version 5.0  October 18 , 2016  Confidential  – CS0116  Page 14 of 28 12.  SAFETY ASSESSMENT  
Adverse Events Definitions  
In this study, an Adverse Event (AE) is any undesirable clinical occurrence (sign, symptom, illness, 
or other medical event), that appears or worsens during the clinical study, or requires me dical 
treatment or intervention to a subject, whether it is considered to be device related or not.  If an 
adverse event occurs, the first concern will be the safety and welfare of the subject. Appropriate 
medical intervention will be made.  
 
Any AE or complication reported by [CONTACT_847154]’s medical record or source document 
and on the Adverse Event Case Report Form. The investigato r will determine if the AEs are device 
related or procedure related. This assessment shall include the onset date, resolution date, severity, 
seriousness, frequency, treatment and outcome.   
 
Each AE should be assessed according to the following criteria:  
Severity  
Each AE should be assessed for its severity, or the intensity of an event experienced by [CONTACT_423].  
Mild: Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the subject’s activity or is transient 
resolved without treatment and has no se quelae.  
Moderate : May interfere with the subject’s usual activity and require additional intervention and/or 
treatment, and may have additional sequelae.  
Severe : Significant discomfort to the subject and/or interferes with the subject’s activity. Additiona l 
intervention and or treatment are necessary. Additional sequelae occur. Severe is used to describe 
the intensity of an event experienced by [CONTACT_423].  
Adverse Device Effect (ADE)  
Each AE should be assessed for its relationship to the device or procedu re as identified as follows:  
Device : This category should be restricted to adverse events directly attributable to the effect of the 
device.  
Procedure: A procedure is any activity that supports the usage of the device.  
Use the following categories for ass igning the certainty of the relatedness:  
Related:  The AE is known to occur with the study agent, there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study agent caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study agent and event. 
Reasonable possibi lity means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
study agent and the AE.  
Not Related : There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study agent caused 
the event, there is no temporal relationship between  the study agent and event onset, or an alternate 
etiology has been established.  
 
  
  
Version 5.0  October 18 , 2016  Confidential  – CS0116  Page 15 of 28 Pre-existing Conditions  
A pre -existing condition should not be reported as an adverse event unless there has been a 
substantial increase in severity or frequency of problems, which has not been attributed to natural 
history.  
 
Diagnosis of Adverse Event  
There should be an attempt to report a “diagnosis” rather than the individual signs, symptoms and 
abnormal laboratory values associated with the diagnosis. However, a diagnosis s hould be reported 
only if, in the Investigator’s judgment, it is relatively certain (i.e., definite or possible). Otherwise 
individual signs, symptoms and abnormal laboratory values should be reported as the adverse 
events.  
 
Anticipated Outcome Related Adverse Events  
Anticipated adverse events in this study may include: temporary minor skin irritation, redness or 
swelling which may last from a few minutes to a few hours, minor swelling in the treated area for up 
to a week or slight heat discomfort during  treatment.  Very rarely, there may be possible bruising, 
burns, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (skin turns darker) or hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (skin turns lighter).  
Any anticipated AE that occurs at any time during or after the use of the study device must be reported 
by [CONTACT_847155]. If the anticipated AE, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_847137], is likely to affect the safety of the subjects or the conduct of the study, the Research 
Ethics Board (REB)/Institutional Research Board (IRB) will b e notified of the event within [ADDRESS_1177952] receives notice of it.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  (UADE)  
An unanticipated adverse device effect as defined by [CONTACT_290459] [21 CFR 812.3(s)] as 
“any serious adv erse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, 
or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or app lication (including a supplementary 
plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates 
to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.” From a practical perspective, an unanticipated adverse 
device effect means a serious adverse event that is not listed in the device labeling, or the frequency 
or severity is greater than reported in the device labeling.  
 
In the event of a serious (or unanticipated) adverse event, the Investigator will immediately notify the  
Venus Concept monitor by [CONTACT_756]. If such an adverse event is being reported after normal working 
hours, the Investigator will leave a voice message with an accompanying report of the AE. If the 
unanticipated AE, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_847138] I nvestigator, is likely to affect the safety of 
the subjects or the conduct of the study, the IRB/ Helsinki/ other ethic committee will be notified of 
the effect within [ADDRESS_1177953] receives notice of it.  
 
Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
NOTE: The term serious is not synonymous with severity, which may be used to describe the intensity 
of an event experienced by [CONTACT_423].  An AE that does not meet any of the below criteria will be 
classified as non -serious.  
A serious AE is any eve nt that:

 Results in permanent impairment of body structure or function, or in persistent or si gnificant 
disability/incapacity;  
 Results in an injury that requires medical intervention to prevent permanent impairment of 
body structure or function;  
 Is a device malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of the device 
that r esults in death or serious deterioration in health;  
 Is a device malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of the device 
that, if it were to occur again, could result in death or serious deterioration in health;  
 Results in a con genital anomaly or birth defect;  
 Is any medically significant injury, event or experience that requires medical/surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above;  
 Results in end -organ toxicity, including hematological, renal, cardiovascular, hepatic, 
gastrointestinal, and central nervous system events.

14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
  
Statistical Design   
This study is a randomized, open -label, multi -centre study.   
 
Sample Size  
Enrollment will continue until up to [ADDRESS_1177954]’s overall tolerability of the adjuvant combination treatment as 
compared to the standard of care post fractional RF treatment. The self -assessment will be based 
on a [ADDRESS_1177955] Tolerability  Scale  (Appendix A) . Summary statistics will be 
generated for subject tolerability immediately after treatment,  24 hours and 72 hours following 
 
  
  
Version 5.0  October 18 , 2016  Confidential  – CS0116  Page 18 of 28 treatment as per the terms:  Very tolerable, tolerable, having no opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], intolerable and very 
intolerable.  
 
The secondary outcomes measures are the subject’s degree of discomfort and/or pain as measured 
by [CONTACT_847156] (VAS), the incidence of  spontaneous adverse event s (AEs) and the 
investigator’s assessment of improvement using the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis Scale scores 
before and after treatment as well as Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) f or each subject .  
VAS scores from the treated group will be compared with the VAS scores of the standard of care 
group.   The investigator’s assessment of improvement using the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis 
Scale from the treatment group will be compare d with that of the standard of care group.  The GAIS 
scores for both groups will also be compared.   
Summary statistics will also be generated for all treatment emergent adverse events (TEAs).  The 
following types will be reported:  
 Overall TEAEs  
 Severe TEAEs  
 TEAEs related to treatment  
 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
 SAEs related to treatment  
 TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation

will identify each sub ject only by [CONTACT_423]’s initials and by [CONTACT_423]’s study number.   
 
Source Documents  
Source documents are the initial documents whereon subject data are recorded. This includes, but 
is not limited to, original subject files, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], and or iginal recordings/tracings from 
automated instruments (e.g., ECG, Blood tests, etc.), X -ray films, and laboratory notes. The 
information contained within the source documents is used to complete the CRF worksheets.  
 
All information captured on the CRF worksheets should be accurately supported by [CONTACT_847158]® and written so in a certification document 
 
  
  
Version 5.0  October 18 , 2016  Confidential  – CS0116  Page 19 of 28 filed in the site and study folders. (e.g., Subject questionnaires will be cleared to be included as  part 
of the CRF worksheets and considered as source documents).   
 
Study Records/Source Document Inspection  
The investigator will allow representatives of Venus Concept®, its monitoring team, the Health 
Authority or other governmental regulatory agencies  to audit all study records, worksheets, and 
corresponding portions of the subject’s office and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_847140]. These inspections are conducted to verify adherence to the protocol, integrity 
of the dat a being captured on the worksheets and compliance with applicable regulations. Venus 
Concept® agrees that subjects’ medical records will be maintained in a confidential manner. Study 
reports will not identify subjects by [CONTACT_2300].  
 
Any additional information relevant to the study should be included in the subject’s source 
documents. In particular, any deviations from the study protocol or procedures should be recorded in 
the source documents.  
 
For example, if study required procedures or visits are not completed or are completed outside the 
time frame specified in the protocol, the reasons for the departure should be explained in the source 
documents. The investigator must maintain all study doc umentation at least [ADDRESS_1177956]. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if 
required by [CONTACT_1214] (in Israel for 15 years) or by [CONTACT_435221]. The sponsor should inform the investigator in writing when t he trial -related records are 
no longer needed.   
 
Data Collection Method  
Data from the subject’s permanent medical records (see source documentation section) will be 
recorded on worksheets supplied by [CONTACT_847159]. These 
worksheets (comprising the CRF's) will be used to transmit the information collected in the 
performance of this study to the clinical database either manually or by [CONTACT_847160] (a third party 
vendor may be used for this).  CRF’s should be filled no longe r than [ADDRESS_1177957] be typewritten or filled out in black ink, accurately and promptly following each 
examination or procedure . No questions will be left blank. Corrections will be made only by [CONTACT_5945] 
(single line) inco rrect data and writing in the revisions. All corrections must be initialed and dated by 
[CONTACT_5946]/recording the correction. If the reason for the change is not obvious, an 
explanation for the change will be recorded. Blacking out or using c orrection fluid or an eraser will 
not be used to eliminate data. The investigator must review the worksheets for completeness and 
accuracy and must sign/date the forms where indicated. Signature [CONTACT_847167]. The investigator wi ll retain originals of all source documents, subject consent forms, and 
study data as a permanent record. Each set of original worksheets should be reviewed for accuracy 
and completion (signatures, dates, adverse events, serious adverse events, protocol de partures) and 
maintained in the investigator’s study files.

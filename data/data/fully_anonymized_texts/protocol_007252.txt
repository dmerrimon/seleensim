1. STUDY  OBJECTIVE  
 
To evaluate, in a 52-week  randomized, double -blind , placebo -controlled  trial, the efficacy of 
lorcaserin  (10 mg BID)  in maintaining a loss of 5% or more of initial weight, achieved during a 
prior 14-week  group lifestyle modification program . 
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 The  Problem of Obesity  
 
Obesity, defined by a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m², is the most common nutritional disease in the U nited 
States, affecting about 36 % of adults age 20 years and over. An additional 33 % of American 
adults are overweight, as judged by a BMI of  25.0-29.9 kg/m² . Obesity is associated with a 
number of co -morbidities including type 2 diabetes (70% of people with type 2 diabetes are 
obese) and cardiovascular disease. Losing as little as 5% of initial weight improves co -morbid 
conditions including in sulin resistance, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and hypertension.  
 
A program of diet, physical activity  and behavioral therapy  is the first line treatment for obesity. 
This approach produce s significant weight loss  (≥5%) but is often followed by [CONTACT_163389]. 
Patients reg ain about 35% of the ir initial weight loss  in the first year  and 50% or more have 
2 
Version 8.0 January 25, 2016  returned t o their baseline weight by 5 yr . It is therefore, highly desirable to identify effective 
interventions, which would improve  long-term maintenance of prior weight lo ss. 
 
 
 
 
2.2 Benefits of Weight loss  
 
A 5–10% reduction in body weight in obese individuals improves several risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) including blood pressure, triglyceride levels, low -density -
lipoprotein cholesterol,  blood glucose, and sleep apnea .1-3 The Diabetes Prevention Program 
(DPP) revealed that a 7% reduction in initial weight, combined with 150 minutes of activity, 
reduced the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_36746] 2 diabetes by 58%, compared with placebo, in at -risk 
overweight/obese individuals at an  avera ge of 2.8 years follow -up.4  Losses >10% are associated 
with grea ter improvements in CVD risk factors5 and are more consistent with obese individ uals’ 
desired weight loss goals . [ADDRESS_1248655] obese individuals, as 
recommended by [CONTACT_15792]’s Clinical Guidelines on the Identification, Evaluation, and 
Treatment of Overweight a nd Obesity in Adults.7 In trials conducted in academic medical 
centers, persons treated by a 1200 -1500 kcal/d diet, combined with regular exercise and a 
comprehensive program of group or individual li festyle modification, lose approximately 7 -10% 
of initial weight in 20 -26 weeks.4,7,8 Lifestyle modification has been incorporated in popular 
commercial programs such as Weight Watchers,9,10 which was found in a randomized trial to 
induce a loss of 5.3% of initial weight in the first 26 weeks (and 3.3% at year 2).[ADDRESS_1248656] effective program which 
induced a loss of 5.5% of initial weight in 6 months.12 The reduced efficacy of lifestyle modification in 
these two cases, as compared with w hen delivered at academic medical centers, is probably attributable 
to the use of large group sessions (50 or more people) which limit individual attention (i.e., Weight 
Watchers) and to the lack of frequent, personalized feedback from a trained interventi onist (i.e., Internet 
programs). The use of telephone -delivered lifestyle counseling produces weight losses that are roughly 
equal to those achieved in face -to-face meetings,13-15 suggesting the promise of the former approach.   
 
 
2.4 Improving the Non-Surgical Treatment of Obesity  
 
2.4.1 Increasing initial weight losses   
 
Investigators currently are examining methods to increase initial weight losses and, thus, achieve 
greater improvements in CVD risk factors.  The use of portion -controlled servings of 
conventional foods,16 as well as liquid meal replacements,3,17 is effective in increasing initial 
weight losses by [CONTACT_3450] 3  to 5 percentage points , as compared with the prescription of a 
self-selected di et of conventional foods with the same calorie goal. Portion -controlled servings, 
by [CONTACT_891769] -determined quantity and energy content, reduce obese individuals’ 
3 
Version 8.0 January 25, 2016  tendency to underestimate their calorie intake, which has been found to be as grea t as 4 0% when 
a self -selected diet of conventional foods is consumed.18,19 The use of liquid meal replacements 
and snack bars contributed to the 8.6% reduction in initial weight achieved in the first year of the 
Look AHEAD study.[ADDRESS_1248657] program of lif estyle modification (e.g., one or two  
visits with a n interventionist )21 or a comprehensive program (i.e., weekly group meetings).22,23 Current 
medications approved by [CONTACT_213435] c hronic weight management include orlistat (a gastric and 
pancreatic lipase inhibitor),24,25 lorcaserin (a selective serotonin agonist),26 and the combination 
of phentermine and topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] (a serotonin and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, combined with a 
medication for epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]/seizure).21,[ADDRESS_1248658] weight  
 
Weight regain remains the Achilles ’ heel of behavioral treatment.8,[ADDRESS_1248659] revealed significantly better weight -loss maintenance at 1 or more years in individuals who 
were randomly assigned, following initial weight  loss, to receive weight -loss medication versus 
placebo.24,26,30-32 FDA -approved weight loss medications are an option for individuals  with a 
BMI ≥ 30 kg/m ² or persons with a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m ² with a weight -related co -morbidity (e.g., type 
2 diabetes, hypertension, etc.).  
 
2.4.3 Lorcaserin  
 
Lorcaserin (BelviqTM) is a selective serotonin 2C receptor agonist that  improves the management 
of obesity. A randomized, controlled trial compared two doses of lorcaserin (10 mg BID vs 10 
mg QD) with placebo, all of which were combined with moderate intensity lifestyle 
counseling.[ADDRESS_1248660] >5% of 
initial weight than with placebo (47.2%, 40.2, and 25.0%, respectively). A second trial that 
compared locas erin (10 mg BID) and placebo (both with lifestyle counseling) observed 1 -year 
mean (SEM) weight losses of 5.8 +0.2% and 2.2 +0.1% of initial weight, respectively.[ADDRESS_1248661] 5% or more of  initial 
weight (47.5%  vs 20.3%), as well as 10% or more (22.6% vs 7.7%).[ADDRESS_1248662] weight, by [CONTACT_891770]. Studies of both sibutramine (10 -15 mg/d)30 and liraglutide (3.0 mg/d)34 showed 
that follo wing the loss of approximately 6% -7% of initial weight, achieved with lifestyle 
modification (i.e., diet run -in), the subsequent addition of medication increased weight loss by [CONTACT_102160] 5% -6% over 12 months. With both medications, long -term weight l oss was superior in 
patients who received medication (plus lifestyle intervention) than placebo (with lifestyle 
4 
Version 8.0 January 25, 2016  intervention). Sibutramine is no longer available for the treatment of obesity (because of its 
association with cardiovascular disease) and liragl utide 3.[ADDRESS_1248663] 5% or more of initial 
weight at 1 year, were more likely to maintain the 5% loss at year 2 if they had been re -
randomized to lorcaseri n rather than to placebo at the end of year 1. Sixty -eight percent of 
participants who remained on lorcaserin for the second year maintained the 5% loss, compared 
with 50% of those who were randomized after 1 year to placebo.  26 The goal of the present study 
is to mainta in larger long -term weight losses by [CONTACT_891771].  
 
3. SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
3.1 Primary Objective  
 
The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of lorcaserin (with lifestyle intervention), 
compar ed with placebo (with lifestyle intervention) in facilitating the maintenance of prior 
weight loss  achieved during a 14-week  group lifestyle modification program. The efficacy of 
lorcaserin will be measured by [CONTACT_131931] (kg) from randomization to week 52 . The co -
primary outcome will compare the percentage of participants assigned to lorcaserin vs placebo 
who maintained the loss of 5% or more of initial weight, achieved during the 14-week dietary 
run-in period.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1248664] randomization the group assigned  to lorcaserin will 
achieve significantly better maintenance of the prior 5% weight loss than wi ll the placebo -treated  
group.  
 
3.3 Primary End Point  
 
The primary end point is the m aintenance of weight loss (pre viously achieved during  the 14-
week  lifestyle modification program), as defined by [CONTACT_131931] (kg) from randomization  to 
week 52 . The co -primary end -point is the percentage  of participa nts in each group that maintain 
the full 5% weight loss, achieved  in the 14-week  prior group lifestyle modification p rogram.  
 
3.4 Secondary Endpoints  
 
 Secondary endpoints include p ercentage change in body weight from randomization to week 52 , 
as well the portion of participants in the two groups who achieve an additional loss >5% of body 
weight, as measured from randomization. The two groups also will be compared on changes 
(from randomization to week 52 ) in cardiometabolic risk factors (incl uding waist circumference, 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride values, LDL and HDL cholesterol, glucose, 
5 
Version 8.0 January 25, 2016  insulin, and high sensitivity C -reactive protein), quality of life (as measured by [CONTACT_891772]  [SF-36] and the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life -Lite [IWQOL ]),  appetite 
control (as measured by [CONTACT_891773], visual analogue scales, the Eating Disorder 
Examination -Questionnaire,and  the Yale Food Addiction Scale), frequency  with which certain 
foods are eaten  (as m easured by [CONTACT_891774] , and p hysical activity 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_891775] . 
The proportion of participants who maintain losses >10% and >15% of initial weight, as 
measured from the  start of the 14-week  group lifestyle modification p rogram , also will be 
compared.  
 
4. STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1 General Design  
 
This is a 52 week , double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group design trial that will enroll 
overweight/obese participants who achieved a  >5% weight loss in a prior 14-week  group 
lifestyle modification program . The total duration of the study will be 70 weeks  (which includes 
a final medical visit at [ADDRESS_1248665] -randomization to assess participants’ health [ADDRESS_1248666] been stopped ). 
 
A total of 182 obese men and women (body mass index [BMI] >33 and <55 kg/m2or BMI >30 
kg/m2 with an obesity -related comorbidity) will be enrolled in a 14-week  group l ifestyle  
modification program  (offered at the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Weight and Eating 
Disorders), of whom ≥136 ( 75%) are expected to lose >5% of initial weight and will be eligible 
for randomization to lorcaserin (with lifestyle intervention; N=68) or placebo (with li festyle 
intervention; N=68).   (Note: A portion of the lifestyle intervention program will be provided 
remotely  by [CONTACT_891776] )  
 
Other Therapy:  
 
Participants will be expected to use medications (prescribed by [CONTACT_235935])  to 
control traditional cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g., hypertension, , hypercholesterolemia, etc) 
and other co -morbid conditions, with the exception of medic ations listed below  under 
“exclusions.” In all cases, the subjects’ primary care provider  (PCP) will be asked at the study’s 
outset to keep medication does constant throughout the study, whenever possible. Participants 
will be expected to have been on thei r medication regimen (including  the dose) for [ADDRESS_1248667] Recruitment  
 
Participants will be recruited from  advertisements in local media outlets (newspapers, radio), as well 
as flyers posted at the University.  We also will advertise the study to health care providers who work 
in Penn’s Clinical Care Associate practices, with whom we have collaborated previous ly.35

6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
6.1 Screening Procedures  
 
All applicants will be screened by [CONTACT_891778]. We will obtain a waiver of written documentatio n of consent for the telephone screen. 
Those who remain interested in the trial will be scheduled for an in -person interview . The 
Weight and Lifestyle Inventory (WALI),36 a paper -and-pencil inventory that assesses general 
eating and lifestyle behaviors and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)  will be mailed to eligible 
participants following the phone screen and completed by [CONTACT_30408]/informed 
consent visit. (All patients  and subjects  at our C enter complete the WALI  and BDI  to facilitate 
their initial interview.)  The in -person interview will be conducted by a psychologist,  who will 
obtain  informed consent  and evaluate participants’ behavioral eligibility (i.e., willingness and 
appropriateness to part icipate). This will include our assessment of the applicant’s mood (as 
measured by [CONTACT_235939]) and suicidality (including history of suicidal ideation and 
behavior, as assessed at screening by [CONTACT_545681] -Suicide Severity Rating Scale) .  
 
Participants who remain interested and pass this portion of the assessment will proceed to meet 
with the study’s nurse practitioner or physician, who will obtain a medical history and conduct a 
physical examination to determine medical eligibility . Persons who continue to remain eligible 
will proceed to have an electrocardiogram (EKG) and fasting blood test to determine that final 
eligibility criteria are met.   Safety screening labs will include a complete blood count (CBC), 
comprehensive metabolic  panel (CMP), lipid panel, hemoglobin A1c,  insulin, high sensitivity C-
reactive protein (hs -CRP),  a thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH) for subjects with a history  of 
thyroid disorder, and a urine pregnancy test (for females of child -bearing age).  
 
6.2 Study Visits  
8 
Version 8.0 January 25, 2016   
Screening visit. The following procedures  will be completed at the screening visit  as discussed 
above : informed consent, medical history, weight, height, waist circumference measurement, 
blood draw, urinalysis, review of medication, full phys ical exam, electrocardiogram, sitting 
blood pressure and pulse rate, and meeting with psychologist  whose assessment will be used as a 
part of determining the subject’s eligibility for the study.  
 
Phase 1: 14-Week Group Lifestyle Modification Program . All participants will complete an 
initial 14-week  group lifestyle modification program , designed to induce a loss >5% of initial 
weight.  They will attend weekly group weight los s sessions (of 9 0 minutes, with 10 to 12 
participants), led by [CONTACT_891779] (RDs) or behavioral psychologists. At week 1, they will 
be instructed to consume their usual diet and to record their food intake (i.e., all foods and 
beverages consumed ). From weeks 2 to 13, they will be instructed to consume a 1000 -1200 
kcal/d d iet that provides four servings daily of a liquid shake (Health Management Resources – 
HMR; 160 kcal per shake), an evening meal comprised of a frozen food entrée (250 -300 kcal), 
with a serving of fruit and a salad. Another serving of fruit will be permitt ed after dinner, 
providing a diet of approximately 1000 -1200 kcal/day.  All HMR products will be provided free 
of charge . Participants will be responsible for purchasing frozen food entrees and other foods.   
Beginning at week 6, participants will be encoura ged to gradually increase their physical activity 
from a minimum of 30  minutes/week (at week 5) to 175  minutes/week at week 14. From weeks 
12-14, participants will be prescribed a re -feeding diet that gradually replaces the consumption of 
shakes with conventional foods, so that they use of shakes will be terminated by [CONTACT_5875] 1 4. 
Participants will be scheduled for their randomization visit (following a last group session) to 
determine that they have lost 5% or more of initial weight and meet BMI and other  study criteria 
for randomization (as determined by  a follow up  physical  examination and other tests). For 
candidates with an obesity -related co -morbidity (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, sleep 
apnea, osteoarthritis, etc.), participants will be i nformed that they will not be able to participate 
in the randomized controlled trial, if they fall below a BMI of 27 kg/m2 during the prior group 
lifestyle modification  program. They will be informed when they have reached a BMI of 27.5 
kg/m ² and encourage d to slow their rate of weight loss so that that they do not reduce below a 
BMI of 27 kg/m ². Falling below a BMI of 27 kg/m ² will make them ineligible to participate in 
the randomized controlled trial of lorcaserin. Participants will be informed that they may resume 
active weight loss once the randomized controlled trial has begun. Similar steps will be taken 
with individuals who are free of obesity -related co -morbidities and reach a BMI of 30.5 kg/m ² 
during the group behavioral weight loss program.  Persons  who do not have an obesity -related co -
morbidity must have a BMI > 30 kg/m2 to receive prescription weight loss medication. Persons 
who fail to meet appropriate BMI criteria at the outset of the randomized controlled trial will not 
be permitted to particip ate. 
 
All group sessions during the Phase I group lifestyle modification program  will be conducted at 
the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Weight and Eating Disorders, following a protocol 
adapted from the Look AHEAD study (developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wadden and colleagues).    
 
Phase [ADDRESS_1248671] will also be performed. Results of these tests will be reviewed by [CONTACT_7357]/nurse practitioner to determine whether  the participant has  any contraindications to 
weight loss or to the use of lorcaserin. These contraindications incl ude but are not limited to: any 
major active kidney, liver, cardiovascular, or cerebrovascular disease; blood pressure ≥ 160/100 
mm Hg; or the use of any medications that significantly affect weight (weight loss or weight 
gain).  
 
Ongoing medical v isits and safety m easures . During the 14-week  group lifestyle modification 
program,  vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) will be measured at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, [ADDRESS_1248672]  a brief medical visit (10 minutes) with the study 
physician/nurse practitioner to check for possible complica tions of ear ly weight loss. M ood will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_891780] 14-week  program. Participants who report significant 
depression or emotional distre ss will be referred to their primary care provider  for fu rther 
evaluation .  
 
Phase 2: 52-Week  Weight Lo ss Maintenance Program . Following randomization to 
medication conditions, all participants will attend group lifestyle sessions, designed to facilitate 
the maintenance of the 5% or greater weight loss achieved during the run -in period. Group 
sessions (10 -12 participants) will last [ADDRESS_1248673] two group session s 
(week s 2 and 4 ) will be held in person (on site) , after which sessions will alternate between on -
site visits and conference calls.  Telephone delivered lifestyle counseling has been shown to be 
as effective as on -site counseling and is more convenient to participants. All participants will 
have an individual visit with their inter ventionist at their randomization visit. All treatment 
sessions for the 52 -week weight loss maintenance program will be delivered following a 
modified version of the Look AHEAD study.  
 
All participants will be instructed to consume a self -selected diet of conventional foods, 
consistent with their food preferences. Those who weigh < 250 lb will be prescribed 1500 -1700 
kcal/day, while those >250 lb will be prescribed 1800 -2000 kcal/day. These calorie values are 
consistent with those reported by [CONTACT_4317] i n the National Weight Control Registry. These 
calorie targets are lower than those that would be achieved by [CONTACT_18647] 500 -600 kcal from 
patients’ estimate d energy requirements and are designed to compensate for obese individuals ’ 
underestimation of  intake by [CONTACT_3450] 40% (as judged by [CONTACT_891781]).  Participants will be counseled on how to consume a well -balanced diet and will use a 
calorie counter (provided to them) to meet their calorie targets.  
 
Participants will be instruct ed in a program of behavioral skills designed to prevent wei ght regain 
(as delivered by [CONTACT_891782] ). This will include encouraging participants to increase 
their physical activity to >200 minutes per week (principally through walking or other aer obic 
activity).   
 
10 
Version 8.0 January 25, 2016  Phase 2 Medical Monitoring  
 
Following the 14-week  group lifestyle modification program  and immediately prior to 
randomization (to lorcaserin  or placebo), participants will complete a second brief history and 
physical examination and undergo another EKG. The study physician/ nurse practitioner will 
again confirm that the participant does not have any  contraindications to weight loss or to the use 
of lorcaserin.  A blood test (w hich will i nclude a CBC, CMP, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] , insulin, hs -CRP  and 
hemoglobin A 1c) and urine pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential) will be repeated 
at this time.  
 
Following randomization (to lorcaserin or placebo) , vital  signs (blood pressure and pu lse) will be 
measured at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 24, 28, 36, 44, and 52. A blood test (which will include a 
CBC, CMP, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], insulin, hs -CRP and hemoglobin A 1c) and urine pregnancy test (for women 
of childbearing potential) will be repeated at weeks 12, 24, 36 and 52.  Participants  will attend 
brief medical visits (10 minutes) with the study physician/nurse practitioner at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 
24, 36, and 52, with a final  visit at week 56 for health assessment  after terminating medication at 
week 52. At each m edical visit, participant’s response  to the medication will be assessed.  Study 
subjects  will be asked whether th ere has been any change in their health or medications. They 
also will be asked about their mood or any thoughts of harming themselves  through 
administration of the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ). In the event of mental 
health events, participants will be referred to the study’s psychologist or psychiatrist for further 
evaluation , if required . For all n on-study -relate d medical events, participants  will be referred to 
their own primary care provider  
 
 
6.3 Outcome Measures  
 
Primary outcome measure: body weight .  Two co -primary endpoints will be tested at week 52 : 
1) change in body weight (in kg) as measured from randomization to week 52 ; and 2) the 
percentage of participants in the two groups that (at week 52 ) maintained the ≥ 5% reduction in 
body weight achieved during the 14-week  group lifestyle modification program .  
 
Body weight  will be measured at all clinic visits. However, f or purposes of the primary outcome, 
weight will be assessed: at screening ( week  -14, prior to the group lifestyle modification 
program ); at randomization; and at weeks 2 4 and 52. Weight will be measured on a digital scale 
(to the nearest 0.1 kg) with participants dressed in light clothing, without shoes. Two 
measurements will be taken on each occasion.  
 
Cardiometabolic risk factors  will be assessed at screening ( week  -14, prior to group l ifestyle 
modification program ); randomization; and weeks 2 4 and 52.  Fasting blood samples (i.e., 
following an overnight fast) will be drawn on each occasi on and assayed for CMP ,CBC, lipid 
panel, , insulin , hs-CRP and hemoglobin A 1c. (Samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_393914].) 
Blood pressure and pulse will be measured on each occasion using an automated monitor 
(Dinamap, model 9300). Two readings will be taken on each occasion (at 1 -minute intervals), 
after participants have been sea ted for at least [ADDRESS_1248674] circumference  (measured 
horizontally halfway between the lowest rib and the top of the hipbone ) to the nearest 0.[ADDRESS_1248675] measurements will be obtained at each assessment 
visit.  
 
Mood, quality of life,  weight bias,  eating behavior,  sleep, stress/fatigue,  and physical 
activity . Mood will be assessed on the same schedule as the primary outcome using the PHQ -9 
and at each medical visit using the C-SSRS . Quality of life will be asses sed on the same schedule 
as the primary outcome using SF -36 and IWQOL -Lite. The experience of weight bias will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_891783],  the Experiences of Weight Bias questions,  
the Stigmatizing Situations Inventory, the Causa l Attributes for Obesity scale , and the Everyday 
Discrimination Scale . Cognitive restraint, disinhibition, and hunger will be evaluated at the same 
time, using the Eating Inventory (EI ) and visual analogue scales . Binge eating will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_891784] g Disorder Examination -Questionnaire (EDE -Q). Food addiction will be measured 
using the Yale Food Addiction Scale , food cravings by [CONTACT_891785], and stress -
related eating by [CONTACT_891786]. 
Mind fulness while eating will be assessed by [CONTACT_891787]. Stress will be assessed by [CONTACT_891788], fatigue by [CONTACT_891789] -Short Form, and sleep by [CONTACT_76017][INVESTIGATOR_891765]. Physical activity will be assessed by [CONTACT_891790].  The third cohort of participants will have the option of completing the 
Experiences of Weight Bias questions, Weight Bias Internalization Scale, and Causal 
Attributions for Obesity Scale a second  time [ADDRESS_1248676] reliability  of these measures . 
 
Safety Measures:  
 
Phase 1  Risks  
The risk of adverse medical or psychiatric events should be minimized by [CONTACT_891791]. The principal risks during the group lifestyle modification program 
include:  
 
Hypoglycemia.  Hypoglycemia may occur during periods o f calorie restriction and weight loss. 
Participants  will  be instructed what to do if they experience symptoms of hypoglycemia.  
 
 
Risk of gallstones.  Rapid weight loss may increase the risk of gallstones. The risk of gallbladder 
disease will be reduced by [CONTACT_30413] [ADDRESS_1248677] experienced any changes in their health. 
The principal risks associated with lorcaserin include:  
 
[ADDRESS_1248678] experiences symptoms of serotonin syndrome , such as 
mental status changes , autonomic instability (e.g., tachycar dia, labile blood  pressure,  
hyperthermia), and/or neuromuscular aberrations (e.g. ,hyperreflexia, incoordination) .  
 
  
Blood count changes.  Blood test abnormalities that have been reported with the use of 
lorcaserin  include decreases in lymphocyte counts and in hemoglobin. In clinical trials of at least 
1-year duration, lymphocyte counts were below the lower limit of normal in 12.2% of patients 
taking the drug, compared with 9.0% of placebo patients. Hemoglobin was below the lower limit 
of normal in 10.4% of patients taking the drug, compared with 9.3% of placebo patients. Durin g 
this study, participant will have regular CB C checks  to monitor for any changes. The study 
physician will make a clinical decision as to the whether lorcaserin should be discontinu ed in any 
subjects who experience blood test abnormalities.  
 
Prolactin elevation.  Prolactin levels w ere found to be higher in lorcaserin than placebo patients. 
Lorcaserin moderately elevates prolactin levels. In a subset of placebo  controlled  clinical trials of 
at least one year in duration, elevations of  prolactin greater than the upper limit of normal, two 
times the upper limit  of normal, and five times the upper limit of normal, measured both before  
and 2 hours after dosing, occurred in 6.7%, 1.7%, a nd 0.1% of lorcaserin -treated  patients and 
4.8%, 0.8%, and 0.0% of placebo -treated patients,  respectively . Participants will be advised to 
contact [CONTACT_891792] (breast enlargement and tenderness 
or milk discharge from  the breast ). The study physician /nurse practitioner  will make a clinical 
decision as to whether lorcaserin should be discontinued in any subjects who experience 
symptoms of prolactin elevation.  
 
Psychiatric disorders.  Some drugs that target the central nervous system, including lorcaserin , 
have been associated with depression or thoughts of suicide. Events of euphoria, hallucination, 
and dissociation were seen with lorcaserin  at supratherapeutic doses in short -term studies. In  
clinical trials of at least 1 -year in duration, 6 patients (0.2%) treated with lorcaserin  developed 
euphoria, as compared with 1 patient (<0.1%) treated with placebo. Doses of lorcaserin  should 
not exceed [ADDRESS_1248679] one year in duration, 
impairments in attention  and memory were reported adverse reactions associated with 1.9% of  
patien ts treated with lorcaserin  and 0.5% of patients treated with placebo,  and led to 
discontinuation in 0.3% and 0.1% of these patients, respectively.  Other reported adverse 
reactions associated with lorcaserin in clinical trials  included confusion, somnolence , and fatigue  
Participants will be advised to  use caution when operating mach inery, including cars, until they  
are certain that the  medication is not affecting them  adversely.  If subjects experience cognitive 
13 
Version 8.0 January 25, 2016  impairment that does not improve and/or is sev ere, the study physician will evaluate whether the 
subject should be discontinued from lorcaserin.  
 
Valvular heart disease.  The use  of lorcaserin  may be associated with valvular heart disease, In 
clinical trials of 1 -year duration, 2. 4% of patients receiv ing lorcaserin and 2% of patients 
receiving placebo developed valvular regurgitation at [ADDRESS_1248680] valvular heart disease after starting lorcaserin will be discontinued from 
the drug.  
  
Priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801].  Priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801] (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) is a potential  
effect of 5 -HT2C receptor agonism.  In clinical trials, priapi[INVESTIGATOR_891766] 0.1% in subjects taking 
lorcaserin compared to 0.1% in placebo -treated subjects. There is limited  experience with the 
combination of lorcaserin and medication indicated for  erectile dysfunction (ED) . In this study, 
men taking medications for ED will be excluded. Subjects  who have an erection lasting longer 
than 4 hours, whether painful or not, will be advised to  immediately seek emergency medical 
attention  and to discontinue lorcaserin.  
 
Reproductive risks.  The use of lorcaserin may pose risks to preg nancy and/or an unborn baby. 
Therefore , participants are advised  not to get pregnant while  in the study.  And women of child  
bearing potential will  be required to follow a study -approved method of birth control while 
participating in the study. Adequate birth control in this study is the use of double barrier 
methods (condom with spermicide or diaphragm with spermicide), stable hormonal 
contraception , intrauterine device, abstinence, or tubal ligation. In addition, the study medication 
may have unknown risks to breast -fed babies. The refore, study participants are instructed no t to 
breastfeed while  taking the study  drug.  Should a female subject become pregnant while in the 
study, she will be discontinued from  lorcaserin and the weight loss intervention . The subject will 
be asked to report the outcome of the pregnancy to the study staff ( e.g. termination, birth 
outcome).  
 
Unforeseen risks.  Such risks in clude  allergic reactions to medications. In addition, t here may be 
other risks associated with lorcaserin  that have not been  identified. If additional risks are  
identified du ring the study, study participants  will be informed  about these risks by [CONTACT_123894].   
 
 
7. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
Power analysis.  There are two primary intention -to-treat (ITT) contrasts based on a longitudinal 
data analysis design (weight measurements at 0, 24, and 52 weeks ). The primary endpoint is 
change in body weight (in kg), as measured from randomization to week 5 2. The co -primary 
endpoint is the percentage of participants in the two groups that, at week 5 2, maintained the ≥ 5% 
reduction in body weight achieved during the 14-week  group lifestyle modification program . 
    
We predict a difference in weight change between the two groups (from randomization to month 
12) of 3 kg (SD=5.0, ICC=0.80).  We anticipate mean weight changes at week 5 2 of "0” kg for 
lorcaserin and "+3" kg for placebo.  (This is a conservative predict ion; we believe that lorc aserin 
[ADDRESS_1248681] used similar run -in designs.)  Furthermore, we predict that 
80% of the lorcaserin participants will have maintained the ≥ 5% reduction in body weight from 
randomization through the 52 week  assessment, as compared  to only 50% of the placebo group.  
Based on the Holm’s procedure that adj usts for multiple comparisons ,[ADDRESS_1248682] will be evaluated at 0.05. Consistent with this form of 
Type I error control, our primary approach for estimating s tudy power is “the probability of at 
least one significant contrast .” 
 
Using a sample size equation for longitudinal clustered samples ,38 a randomization  sample size 
of 68 participants in placebo and 68 participants in the lorcaseri n treatment group (total sample: 
136) provides over 80% power to detect the two primary  contrasts to be statistically significant 
at the Holm’s adjusted alpha levels noted above. This estimate allows for 20% attrition during 
the 52-week  randomized trial, resulting in approximately 54 treatment completers in arm.  The 
ITT longitudinal statistical design will further improve power by [CONTACT_891793] -completer s and the adjustment of possible variance reducing baseline 
covariat es.   All secondary analyses will be considered exploratory and evaluated at the alpha = 
0.05 level. The power analys is was conducted using PASS 11.39  
 
Statistical plan: preliminary analyses .  All data will first be assessed by [CONTACT_891794], for missing data and out -of-range values with basic statistical procedures such as univariate 
statistics (i.e., means, standard deviations, ranges, frequencies, proportions, percentiles) and 
graphs, such as histograms, box and whisker plots, scatter plots and Q -Q plots. In addition, plots 
will be produced of individual and average trajectories of all repeated measures over time 
according to assigned treatment.   All questions of data quality a nd integrity will be investigated 
before any statistical modeling is conducted.  
 
Next, a preliminary analysis of all outcome and baseline demographic variables will be 
performed to test for differences in baseline measures between the randomized groups. T he test 
of the adequacy of randomization will consist of tests of differences between the treatment 
conditions to see if the baseline variables are equally distributed between them. These baseline 
comparisons will be based on: t -tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables, 
depending on the symmetry of the distributions; on Chi -square, Fisher’s Exact or logistic 
regression for binary or ordinal variables; and on Poisson log -linear regression for count data. If 
imbalances are found at baseline, then the relevant variables will be treated as confounders in the 
post study analyses.  
 
Primary analysis .  To test the principal hypothesis that patients randomized to lorcaserin (with 
lifestyle intervention) will achieve significantly better maintenance o f lost weight than those 
assigned to placebo (with lifestyle intervention, as measured by [CONTACT_891795] (in kg) from 
randomization to week 52 , a nested (cluster) mixed model will be fit utilizing the mixed 
procedure in the statistical software package SAS,  version 9.3.  An intention -to-treat (ITT) 
[ADDRESS_1248683] of the repeated measures data 
clustered with the individual participant.  In addition, these models will contain the following 
fixed effects: main effe ct for change from baseline to each follow -up visit ( weeks  24 and 52), 
group (2 conditions assuming intent -to-treat analyses), and interaction between the visit and 
group indicator variables. Tests of these interactions will correspond to tests of ITT diff erences 
among the treatment conditions.  Estimates and confidence intervals for these group differences 
will be derived from interaction and main effects parameters of the models.  The primary focus 
with be on the 52 week  comparison. For the co -primary com parison of the percentage of 
participants in the two groups that, at week 5 2, maintained the ≥ 5% reduction in body weight 
achieved during the 14-week  group lifestyle modification program , we will use generalized 
estimating equations (GEE) within the GENMOD  procedure in SAS (2011) to fit population -
averaged logistic models assuming the binomial distribution. As noted previously, we will use 
the Holm’s procedure to control the overall alpha for the two sets of comparisons (for the 
continuous and dichotomous o utcomes).     
 
 All randomized participants will be included in the primary intention -to-treat (ITT) analysis. A 
modified ITT analysis also will be conducted which includes only those participants who receive 
at least one dose of medication and provide at least one post -randomization measurement of 
body weight. A per protocol analysis will be conducted that includes only those participants who 
provide a measurement of body weight at week 52  (with a window of +4 weeks ). All randomized 
participants will be in cluded in the safety analysis. No interim analyses are planned (in order to 
maintain full power for the end -of-study comparisons).  
 
Secondary analyses . Similar analytic strategies will be employed for all other continuous 
secondary efficacy endpoints, as w ell as for binary (dichotomous outcomes; i.e., percentage of 
participants who achieve different criterion weight losses).  
For the logistic model, differences will be presented as odds ratios with confidence intervals; for 
linear model, the least squares m eans and standard errors will be presented with confidence 
intervals.  
 
Missing data. All analyses will be conducted using the ITT principle, in which all available data 
on all randomized patients are included.  This approach minimizes bias if participants drop out of 
the intervention for different reasons. Assuming adequate fit of the mixed effects models to the 
data, the proposed nested random effects models are the most robust to missing data assumptions 
among standard longitudinal models that analyze all  subjects regardless of how many post -
randomization visits are missed. The following missing or unbalanced data scenarios can be 
accommodated by [CONTACT_545689]: attrition (drop out), missed interim visits, and missing covariate 
data where a subject is intervi ewed but data are missing on covariates of interest.  All three types 
of missing data are handled by [CONTACT_891796] (MAR).  Therefore, we will explore the potential 
bias of missing data by [CONTACT_545691] -completers to see if they differ 
systematically on values of non -missing variables. There are many ways to assess the assumption 
of MAR. We will consider imputing missing endpoint data using multiple imputa tion techniques, 
fitting selection models (e.g. MNAR), and fitting pattern mixture models . 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1248684] with participants,  the study personnel  will seek information on adverse events by 
[CONTACT_5147], as approp riate, by  [CONTACT_30417]. Information on all adverse 
events will recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse 
event module of the case report form (CRF). All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal 
diagnostic  procedures results will be recorded in the source document, though should be grouped 
under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded. The clinical course of 
each event will be followed until resolution, stabiliz ation, or until it has been determined that the 
study treatment or participation is not the cause. Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at 
the end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious 
adverse event t hat occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the 
study treatment or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately. All serious 
adverse events will be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_1248685] of 1996 (HIPAA).  
Those regulations require a signed subject auth orization informing the subject of the following:  
 
 Protected health information (PHI) collected from subjects in this study  
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of research participants  to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI  
 View of PHI will be limited to individuals at the University of Pennsylvania directly 
involved in the study. The company donating the study product will not have access to 
PHI.  
 
In the event that a participant  revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization. For participants  who have revoked authorization to collect or u se PHI, attempts 
will be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at 
the end of their scheduled study period.  
 
11. STUDY MONITORING, AUDITING, AND INSPECTING  
 
The investigator will permit study -related mon itoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB, 
government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all 
study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection 
instruments, study data , etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of 
applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 
17 
Version 8.0 January 25, 2016  Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by 
[CONTACT_891797].

Page 5 of 231.0 Objectives/Specific Aims
Primary Aim: Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a multi-component intervention for 
sexual function. 
Hypothesis: At least 80% of randomized participants will complete the study without differential 
withdraws from the VVA control group. 
Exploratory Aims:
Aim 2: Determine which measure (FSFI, ITS or PROMIS SexF) should be the primary outcome 
for this multi-component intervention for a larger, well powered randomized trial.
Aim 3: Determine the effect size to be able to adequately power a larger randomized trial. 
This study is related to an NCI Moonshot priority (F) to minimize the debilitating side effects of 
cancer treatment. Completion of these aims will provide a critical foundation for NCI Cancer 
Prevention and Control Clinical Trials Grant Program R01 submission to implement a phase II 
or III randomized trial to implement in the NCORP network.

changes in sexual functioning and negative self-image.2-[ADDRESS_771200] treatment, as the need to “get back to normal” is prevalent. Difficulties 
with self-image, mental health, and satisfaction or pleasure often accompany treatment effects 
creating emotional/psychological stressors.9-[ADDRESS_771201] a couple communicates and connects with each other as well as how each 
other’s needs are met.14,[ADDRESS_771202] trouble 
reconnecting once treatment is completed and life’s routines are trying to return to “normal.” 
There is little debate that sexual health concerns and symptoms resulting from the cancer 
experience have complex etiologies that require education, support and overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_586147].16 Two recent editorials addressing two clinical trials evaluating pharmacologic 
interventions for libido (transdermal testosterone and oral bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]) highlight the importance of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_586148].17,18
To summarize, unlike chemotherapy related side effects like nausea which are transient, the 
physical effects to a woman’s body, due to hormonal deprivation can be chronic and worsen 
over time without intervention and have the potential to negatively impact a woman’s emotional 
adjustment and recovery from cancer. The profound interplay between these physical and 
emotional concerns/ symptoms necessitates interventions to be designed to address multiple 
factors simultaneously. Our team has developed a 4-pronged approach to promote sexual 
health targeting vulvovaginal tissue quality and symptoms, self-image, libido, and partner 
communication. In this study, we are testing two interventions that together address three of the 
aforementioned important concerns.
3.0 Preliminary Data
In this section, we will review the existing data for treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), 
libido, and body image. These three components are the focus of this proof-of-concept study. 
Vulvovaginal symptoms are consistently identified as predictors of sexual health concerns in 
female cancer patients and surviviors.8,19-[ADDRESS_771203] in sexual intimacy.22 
IRB NUMBER: UTK IRB-22-[ZIP_CODE]-XP
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/07/[ADDRESS_771204]/current treatment
The initial treatment for VVA symptoms focuses on non-hormonal treatments to improve tissue 
quality. Vaginal moisturizers, involving bases such as polycarbophil, hyaluronic acid (HLA), 
gums or gelatins, may be used on a regular basis for hydrating vaginal tissue. Moisturizers have 
been shown to stabilize vaginal pH in limited studies and demonstrated efficacy against VVA 
symptoms.23 Ospemifene, a Food and Drug Administration-approved selective estrogen 
receptor modifier (SERM) for dyspareunia, is associated with potential adverse effects including 
hot flashes and venous thromboembolic events,[ADDRESS_771205] dose possible (eg: 7.5 micrograms [mcg] 
suppository) is used to provide symptom relief while minimizing systemic effects. 24,25 Although 
very low dose vaginal estrogen may not result in systemic concentrations outside of the 
menopausal range, research has shown significant changes in lipi[INVESTIGATOR_586149], 
suggesting systemic effects related to estrogen may indeed occur.26,27 
Vaginal estrogens given to women on aromatase inhibitors (AIs) may be absorbed through the 
vaginal mucosa, resulting in significantly increased circulating levels and systemic effects.[ADDRESS_771206] resort, reserved for when nothing else has been helpful. 
In summary, data demonstrates that moisturizers applied to the vagina and vulva can be helpful 
over time if used frequently enough. A study done by [CONTACT_586157]. evaluated vaginal DHEA 
compared to a bioadhesive moisturizer over 12 weeks which found that daily use of a simple 
moisturizer improved symptoms over 12 weeks with considerable improvement demonstrated 
by [CONTACT_5875] 4.23 A study comparing an HLA (non-hormonal) moisturizer to Premarin cream 
demonstrated significant improvement in both groups by 8 weeks with no difference between 
the two arms.29 Therefore, we will use a non-hormonal moisturizer to improve the symptoms of 
vulvovaginal atrophy in this study. 
Libido - Energy
There is a lot of controversy in the literature about what constitutes female sexual desire, often 
called libido.30,31 It is clear that sexual desire/libido in women is multifactorial and more complex 
in comparison to men which appears to be more of a linear relationship between arousal and 
desire. In women, the relationship is not linear, and is confounded by [CONTACT_586158], 
relationships and self-image.32 It is also likely true that sexual desire may be more challenging in 
women with a cancer history compared to those without cancer. Specifically, the cancer 
literature supports that energy (perhaps fatigue) plays an important role in sexual health and 
declines as a result of a cancer diagnosis and treatment.33 Data from our recent vaginal 
Dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_2119] (DHEA) study demonstrate that at baseline, vitality explained 13% of 
overall sexual function (unpublished data). In addition, at baseline, women in our vaginal DHEA 
study reported vigor/energy levels right around the 50% point (53 out of 100 with higher 
numbers being better) on the vitality subscale of the Medical Outcomes Scale Short Form-36. 
Further, linear regression modeling of overall sexual function at baseline found vitality to be a 
significant predictor (p=.001) in addition to the variables of relationship, severity and bother of 
vaginal symptoms, and chemically induced menopause (unpublished data).

unattractive, feeling a loss of femininity, increased anxiety, increased depression, and changes 
in one’s sense of sexual self are noted.19 A meta-synthesis of 30 qualitative studies 
representing 795 women supports the concept of “redefining self” in terms of body image and 
womanhood/femaleness as a pervasive, critical issue in the sexual health and functioning of 
women with breast cancer.11 Estimates of the prevalence of body image concerns range from 31 
to 67%, and the prevalence of those reporting arousal or interest issues is 46 to 56%, 
respectively.11,12,[ADDRESS_771208] effects on body/self-image in women with a 
history of breast cancer. In more sophisticated designs, body/self-image has been supported as 
a predictor of sexual interest and sexual health in general.10

is to provide women with an improved sense of well-being, health, and positive self-image. In 
addition, suggestions are given around increasing ones’ sense of control and the ability to 
manage physical and mental tension that have resulted in fatigue and apathy regarding sexual 
activity.[ADDRESS_771210] women in attaining, or re-attaining, a positive view of

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/07/[ADDRESS_771211] developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a well powered randomized 
clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a two-component intervention on three critical predictive 
variables of sexual function. This study intends to demonstrate a proof of concept that we can 
implement a two-step approach to address three areas of sexual function after cancer diagnosis 
and treatment: VVA, body image changes, and sexual desire/energy. All women will receive the 
same treatment for their VVA, and then be randomized to either arm 1: receiving hypnosis for 
body image and sexual desire after two weeks of VVA treatment or arm 2: VVA control group. 
The VVA control group will have the option to receive the hypnosis intervention after completion 
of eight weeks of the VVA treatment.  
The potential for a comprehensive approach to sexual health improvement
This program of research builds upon work done by [CONTACT_586159]. 4,5,9 They designed a 
comprehensive menopausal assessment intervention to address three symptoms (hot flashes, 
vaginal dryness, and urinary incontinence). Advanced practice nurses assessed each woman’s 
needs and developed a tailored intervention including pharmacologic and behavioral 
interventions for these three main issues. At the time of this study, there was a paucity of 
effective interventions for these problems. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], the investigators report significant 
improvements in sexual health as measured by [CONTACT_586160] (CARES) in comparison to the usual care control group. The 
improvements were sustained at the two month follow up.[ADDRESS_771212]. Barton has had a rigorous 
program of research in the area of sexual health in cancer survivors. She has developed and 
implemented two clinical trials for libido (transdermal testosterone34 and bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]35 and one for 
vulvovaginal atrophy23 in the NCORP setting, involving multiple sites and hundreds of 
participants. [CONTACT_586175] will retire December 31, 2024.

4.1 Design
This will be a randomized two arm trial to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability 
(attrition), and effect size of a bio-behavioral, two-component intervention to improve 
vulvovaginal atrophy and self-image and libido. We will also evaluate the sensitivity and 
effect size of the chosen outcome measures to determine the best primary outcome for a 
larger, well powered randomized clinical trial.
4.[ADDRESS_771215] Recruitment
Recruitment and screening: Potential participants from the community will be identified 
in three ways: (1) physician referrals; (2) ResearchMatch.org; and (3) study 
advertisements including social media campaign, radio ads, flyers/brochures and a study 
website. Flyers may be posted in the greater Knoxville area. Locations such as 
churches, gyms, and cancer support groups. Brochures and flyers may be provided to 
physicians, providers, and organizations to distribute. IRB-approved recruitment 
materials may be posted on social media or in University of Tennessee/non-University of 
Tennessee newspapers, newsletters or websites, or read over WUOT. Participant 
eligibility will be determined using the Screening Eligibility Check List created from the 
criteria listed in 4.3. 
Baseline visit: If a woman is screened eligible using the screening eligibility checklist, 
she will be mailed or emailed the consent form and scheduled for a virtual baseline visit. 
Baseline visits will be conducted using a HIPAA compliant platform (video or phone). 
The purpose of the baseline visit is to ensure that participants understand the study 
requirements, have their questions answered, be consented, complete baseline 
questionnaires, and are randomized. After confirming eligibility and reviewing the 
consent, eligible women will sign the consent using an IRB approved e-consent platform. 
After consent is attained, participants will be given a study number. Then baseline 
questionnaires will be completed, women will be randomized to vulvovaginal treatment 
with hypnosis starting in two weeks or vulvovaginal treatment control. Randomization will 
be done at the time of consent using a random number generator with “1” being the 
intervention group and “2” being the control group. They will then be educated about 
treatment with a vaginal moisturizer (see intervention details below). This treatment will 
begin within two weeks of completing the baseline visit (to allow for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_586150]) and will be verified with the study coordinator. The start of vulvovaginal 
treatment will be confirmed by [CONTACT_586161]. After confirmation of the start of vaginal moisturizer 
treatment, behavior education visit (Intervention) or follow up phone call (Control) will be 
planned for two weeks (+/- 3 days) for both groups.
Behavioral education visit: After treatment for vulvovaginal dryness has been 
underway for two weeks for the intervention group and VVA control group, a second 
remote visit will be conducted to assess how the vaginal treatment is progressing and to 
answer any questions about use of the moisturizer and assess for any adverse events. 
Also, during this second remote visit, the intervention group will be educated about the 
hypnotic induction intervention (see intervention information below). The rationale for 
splitting this education into a second visit is two-fold. First, doing it during the baseline 
visit would make that visit too long and too complex. It is likely participants would be 
overwhelmed with all of the information. Secondly, since the treatment for vulvovaginal

Phone follow up calls: Participants in both groups will have follow-up calls every two 
weeks (+/- 3 days) during the intervention except the week of the behavioral education 
visit to assess for adverse events, problem solve any lack of adherence, ensure 
completion of data collection and enhance study engagement. 
A Screening and Enrollment Log will be maintained to document eligibility/ineligibility, 
screen dates, consent dates, and referral source of each individual screened.

treating only vulvovaginal dryness and then adding treatment for body image and libido 
for an additional six weeks while continuing to treat the vulvovaginal atrophy.  
Vaginal Moisturizer
Vulvovaginal dryness will be treated with a daily moisturizer for two weeks, then every 
other day for the remaining six weeks. Vaginal moisturizer will be applied at night, before 
sleep and after all sexual activity. Several moisturizers are available, including vaginal 
DHEA (IntraRosa®). Due to the need for reproducibility, we have decided to use one 
non-hormonal vaginal moisturizer, Replens™ moisture, which is a vaginal moisturizer 
consisting primarily of a purified water, glycerin, and mineral oil. Other ingredients 
included in the formulation are polycarbophyl, carbomer, homopolymer type B, 
hydrogenated palm oil glyceride, sorbic acid, sodium hydroxide. The moisturizing gel 
was determined to be a medical device for marketing by [CONTACT_34033] 2010. It has been 
studied in limited populations50,[ADDRESS_771221] efficacy in treating vulvovaginal 
atrophy. It is non-hormonal (unlike vaginal DHEA) and therefore will be more likely to be 
acceptable by a broader range of oncology providers. 
Hypnotic Relaxation Intervention: a behavioral treatment for body image and 
libido
The hypnotic relaxation intervention consists of three different audio files. Each audio file 
will be used [ADDRESS_771222] hypnotic 
induction audio focuses on sexual desire, passion, and energy. 
Audio I: Hypnotic relaxation for deepening relaxation and a sense of well 
being
Perform a hypnotic induction to address self-love and enhance relationship to self; 
experience deep relaxation and suggestions for a sense of wellbeing. Used during 
study weeks 3 and 4.
Goals:
Experience an increased sense of relaxation
Experience improved feelings about their body
Experience feelings of comfort and well being
Audio II: Hypnotic Relaxation for Improving Self Image Awareness 
Perform a hypnotic induction to focus on improving body-image; suggestions for 
visualizing a body as strong, healthy, and beautiful. Used during study weeks 5 
and 6.
Goals:

increased energy and sense of wellbeing. Used during study weeks 7 and 8.
Goals:
Increase relaxation
Build upon improved feelings about your body
Build upon improved feelings about your sexuality
Improve sexual desire and energy
VVA Control 
The VVA control group will get the eight weeks of vaginal moisturizer exactly as 
described above for the intervention group. After completion of the eight weeks of the 
study, the women assigned to the VVA control will be offered the Hypnotic Relaxation 
Intervention to complete on their own off study. 
Accrual: Our research team has successfully recruited cancer survivors into clinical 
trials with an average of 4-6 per month. Weekly and monthly accrual goals will be set 
and achieved through a multipronged recruitment approach.

Feasibility: We will keep spreadsheets of the numbers of women who receive a full eligibility 
screen and how many of those are found eligible versus not eligible, and of those eligible, how 
many consent to participate versus decline participation. The analysis and definition of what is 
considered feasible is in the statistical analysis section. 
Acceptability: We will keep records of the number of women who complete the protocol, 
including the questionnaires at all data points versus those who do not complete either the 
protocol treatment, the questionnaires, and/or both. The analysis and definition of what is 
considered feasible is in the statistical analysis section. 
Adherence: We will keep the following data to determine adherence to various aspects of the 
study: a) Number of missing questions within questionnaires; b) number and type of missing 
questionnaires; c) number of women who use the moisturizer exactly per protocol; d) number of 
women who use the moisturizer at least 80% of the time described by [CONTACT_760]; e) number of 
women who use the moisturizer less than half of the time described by [CONTACT_760]; f) number 
of women in each arm who listen to each audio sessions at least once in the assigned two week 
period; g) number of women in each arm who listen to each audio session at least once per 
week; h) number of women in each arm who listen to each audio session more than once per 
week. 
Demographic Information Form: a brief medical history that obtains age, gender, sexual 
orientation, race/ethnicity, education level, marital status, cancer diagnosis, and similar 
demographic information. In addition, any other medical conditions that would exclude possible 
participants will be captured with this form.
Hypnosis Practice Log: Frequency of home practice is thought to be one of the moderators of 
the efficacy of hypnosis interventions.52 Participants in the hypnosis group will be given a log to 
be completed weekly. The log will provide space to put the date, whether or not the participant 
listened to their audio recording, the number of times they practiced, and provide a space for 
comments about any interruptions or barriers to listening to the recordings.
Current topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (e.g. lidocaine or vaginal moisturizer) products will ask which products (if 
any) participants used vaginally within the last 2 weeks.
Female Sexual Function Index is a relatively brief measure (19 items) that has been 
developed and validated to be used across the age range of women, including postmenopausal 
women.[ADDRESS_771224] recent Cronbach alpha’s being over 0.9 for internal reliability. 
A score of 26.55 (from a range of 2 to 36) was found to be the cut point to distinguish women 
with and without sexual dysfunction (lower scores indicating sexual dysfunction). The FSFI was

activities, symptoms, functioning, and evaluation of sexual experiences.[ADDRESS_771226] been demonstrated in multiple studies. In the validation study, 
Cronbach’s alpha scores ranged from 0.85 to 0.98.55 This measure has been used in other 
studies of dyadic sexual health interventions with similar reliability and validity.56
6.0 Procedures
6.1 Data Management
The baseline and outcome-related questionnaires will be administered online via an 
HIPAA compliant platform such as Qualtrics or RedCap and/or via a paper collections 
process. 
All materials collected are for research purposes only, and data will be kept in strict 
confidence. No information will be given to anyone without permission from the 
participant. The consent form includes the informed consent statement required by [CONTACT_586163]. This statement 
guarantees confidentiality and identifies the subject as the owner of the information 
received. Identifying information will be kept separated from study outcome data 
provided by [CONTACT_586164]. Any identifying information that is collected on paper will be kept in a secure 
location within a locked file cabinet separate from the participant data charts.
Analyses will be de-identified and include only summaries of data.
6.2 Vaginal Moisturizer Distribution
Study staff will send Replens™ vaginal moisturizer to all participants. Receipt of 
Replens™ will be confirmed by [CONTACT_586165] 1 start date. The distribution of Replens™will be tracked with a 
log detailing participant study ID, date product was sent to participant, date product was 
delivered to participant according to tracking number and date participant confirms 
receipt of Replens™ moisturizer.
7.0 Data Analysis
IRB NUMBER: UTK IRB-22-[ZIP_CODE]-XP
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/07/2025
Page 17  of 23The data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, 
percentage, and frequency). The demographic and clinical characteristics including FSFI, BITS, 
PROMIS SexF V2, and adverse events will be descriptively analyzed with effect size 
calculations done for the validated quantitative measures. All statistical analyses will be 
completed using either SPSS or Stata.
7.1 Analysis Plan
Aim 1: Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a two-component intervention 
for sexual function.  
Feasibility  will be evaluated through determining the accrual rate and screen failures. 
Acceptability will be determined by [CONTACT_586166]. 
Accrual rates will be calculated by [CONTACT_586167].  
For purposes of this study, screen failures will be calculated as the number of women for 
whom full eligibility criteria are evaluated using an eligibility checklist and initial screening 
call and who are determined to be ineligible through that call. 
Retention will be calculated as the number of women who complete all eight weeks of 
the study and complete the FSFI at baseline and eight weeks divided by [CONTACT_586168].
Conversely, attrition rates will be calculated by [CONTACT_586169]. Attrition rates of 25% or less will be considered 
feasible. Withdrawal reasons will be captured and reported by [CONTACT_17203].
Adherence: Adherence will be determined by [CONTACT_586170] 80% compliance with study treatment related 
to the vaginal moisturizer and behavioral education materials.
This study will be determined to be feasible and acceptable if we have at least a 60% 
accrual rate; 80% retention rate and an 80% adherence rate (d+h under adherence). 
Aim 2: Determine which measure (FSFI, ITS or PROMISE SexF) should be the 
primary outcome for this multi-component intervention for a larger, well 
powered randomized trial.
   For all of the patient reported outcome measures, we will calculate missing data rates, 
change from baseline to each data point, and look at how variable measures are over 
time. This information, along with effect size data discussed in Aim 3, will be considered 
in determining the optimal measure to use for the primary outcome in a larger trial.  
  Criteria we will be looking for in a “winning” measure includes: a lack of missing data on 
any items; smaller “placebo” response, evidence of a better linear trend over time, and 
sensitivity to change.

Page 18  of 23Aim 3: Determine the effect size to be able to adequately power a larger 
randomized trial. 
Effect sizes, Cohen’s d or f,  will be calculated for from baseline to week 8. Effect sizes 
will be calculated for both study arms for the PROMIS, FSFI total score; FSFI lubrication, 
pain, and desire subscales and the Impact of Treatment Scale. Means, variance, and 
95% confidence intervals will also be calculated to better estimate what sample size is 
needed for a larger trial with at least 80% power to detect at least a medium effect size.

information. All data are collected for research purposes only, as part of the proposed 
study. All data will be kept completely confidential and referenced only in terms of a 
coded research assigned number. Data will be entered into a statistical database (SAS, 
Stata or SPSS) that is password protected and accessed on a hard drive protected by a 
fire wall. A unique study number will be given to each participant. This will ensure the 
confidentiality of the participants.
8.2 Potential Risks
Study visits and forms: Participants may be inconvenienced by [CONTACT_586171], 
phone calls, and virtual study visits. We will make every attempt to work around the 
schedules of participants and to minimize burden on patients with respect to forms and 
follow up phone calls.
This study presents minimal potential risks to participants. Participants may choose to 
not participate in any part of this voluntary study. Potential risks include agitation and 
anxiety which we will try to minimize by [CONTACT_586172]. 
Participant may have discomfort during completion of study questionnaires, frustration 
with the intervention due to lack of perceived benefit, which we will try to minimize 
through participant education on the purpose of the study. Further, with the vaginal 
moisturizer, participants may develop a vulvar rash or irritation; they may experience 
burning or itching; or they may experience a vaginal infection.  
Risks associated with this trial will be kept to a minimum and all participants will be 
monitored carefully. Patients will be reminded that they can discontinue study 
participation at any time they choose or if their primary doctor feels it is in their best 
IRB NUMBER: UTK IRB-22-[ZIP_CODE]-XP
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/07/[ADDRESS_771228] to stop. Participation in this research study is strictly voluntary. The participant 
may opt to withdraw consent at any time for any reason. The investigator will notify the 
participant of any new information related to risk, toxicity, or efficacy that could influence 
the decision by [CONTACT_466674].
Confidentiality: Any information about the participant obtained from this research will be 
kept confidential. Participants will not be identified by [CONTACT_586173]. A code will be assigned to each participant that will 
allow for tracing the identity of each study participant. The IRB and Data Safety and 
Monitoring Committee will assess confidentiality and safety throughout the study period. 
Participant data will be stored using UTK encrypted servers and/or in locked files. Only 
IRB approved research staff will have access to participant files. All data will be de-
identified and coded with study numbers.
Research team members are trained in the intervention and work directly under the 
supervision of [CONTACT_586176] and Barton. Measures will be taken to ensure each participant 
understands their right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. 
Participants will be gently coached using behavioral change theory to implement their 
assigned study treatment as designed but at no time will participant be made to feel 
guilty about or pressured to implement the study procedures in any way. If the research 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_586152] a 
participant, they will address this issue and again assure the participant of their right to 
withdraw.
Participants will be notified of any potential breach of personal information, should it 
occur.
All study records will be retained per institution policy.
8.3 Compensation for Participants
Participants will be compensated individually for their participation in this research study 
and may receive up to a total of $80 compensation. Compensation will be prorated at 
$[ADDRESS_771229] on sexual function and satisfaction from 
addressing more than one element of decreased sexual function. These data will add to 
IRB NUMBER: UTK IRB-22-[ZIP_CODE]-XP
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 01/07/2025
Page 20  of 23the science that will likely increase the development of other intervention studies trying 
to address this critical issue.
9.0 Data and Safety Monitoring
The study team will meet every six months or more frequently depending on the activity of the 
protocol. The discussion will include matters related to the safety of study participants 
(SAE/UaP reporting), validity and integrity of the data, enrollment rate relative to expectations, 
characteristics of participants, retention of participants, adherence to the protocol (potential or 
real protocol deviations), and data completeness. These regular meetings will be documented 
and result in a  Data and Safety Monitoring Report form that will be completed and signed by 
[CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_271842]-investigators. These reports will be filed with the 
IRB during the scheduled continuing review.
10.0 Adverse Event Reporting
Oversight of the progress and safety of the trial will be provided by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-I. This study 
presents minimal risk to subjects. Adverse events (AEs) are not anticipated; however, study 
staff will assess AEs during follow up phone calls. Any occurring AEs will be documented using 
the CTCAE version 5 and reported to the IRB per institutional guidelines.

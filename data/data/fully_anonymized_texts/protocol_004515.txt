Title of Study:   
A Phase 2, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Clinical Study Investigating the Effects of 
Obeticholic Acid and Atorvastatin Treatment on Lipopr otein Metabolism in Subjects with Nonalcoholic 
Steatohepatitis  
Study Center(s):  
Approximately 30 investigational sites in the [LOCATION_002]  
Study Period:  
Duration of individual subject participation:  up to 5 weeks in Screening (depending 
on current statin use) and 16  weeks during the double -blind treatment phase, 
followed by [CONTACT_185591] -label long -term safety extension (LTSE) expected to 
last approximately 2  years.  Phase of Development:  
Phase 2  
 
Objectives:  
Primary Objective  
• To evaluate the effect of OCA on low -density lipoprotein (LDL) metabolism in subjects with 
biopsy-confirmed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and to assess the ability of atorvastatin to 
modulate this effect  
Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of OCA alone and in combination with atorvastatin therapy in 
subjects with biopsy -confirmed NASH  
• To evaluate the effect of OCA , with and without atorvastatin therapy , on  
− High-density lipoprotein (HDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), triglycerides  (TGs), total 
cholesterol, and apolipoprotein concentrations  
− Components of the reverse cholesterol transport  pathway 
Exploratory Objectives  
• To evaluate the effect of OCA on  
− Liver biochemistry, inflammation, and apoptosis  
− Markers of glucose metabolism including C -peptide, insulin, fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin -
specific A1c fraction (HbA1c), homeostatic model assessment –beta-cell function (HOMA -β) and 
homeosta tic model assessment  – insulin resistance (HOMA -IR) 
− Anthropometric measures  including height (measured at Screening Visit 1 only), weight, and waist 
and hip circumference measurements; and body mass index (BMI) , and waist-to-hip ratio calculations  
− Cardiovascular risk scores (eg, Framingham Risk Score [FRS] and Reynolds score)  
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of OCA and its conjugates  
• To evaluate the bioanalytical concentrations of atorvastatin and its metabolite s 
• To evaluate improvement in noninvasive -radiological assessment of fibrosis via transient 
elastography  (TE; at sites where available)

Confidential and Proprietary  Methodology:  
This Phase  2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, with an open- label LTSE, will 
evaluate the effect of OCA, and the subsequent addition of statin therapy, on lipoprotein metabolism in subjects 
with NASH with fibrosis stage 1  to 4, but no evidence of hepatic decompensation.   Approximately 80 subjects 
with histological evidence of definite or probable NASH, who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion 
criteria will be enrolled.  The histological evidence of definite or probable NASH will be based on the central 
reading of a liver biopsy obtained no more than 1 year prior to randomization and a nonalcoholic  fatty liver 
disease activity score (NAS) of 4 or greater.  Subjects not using statin therapy (ie, statin -free) and statin -treated 
subjects may be enrolled in the study.  Statin -treated subjects will be required to stop statin treatment (after 
signing informed consent)  for up to 5 weeks, including a 4 -week washout period, prior to R andomization /Day 1.   
Screening Period : 
Subjects will have a screening period of up to 5 weeks prior to Randomization/Day  1.   
Subjects using statins within 30 days of the initial Screening visit (Screening Visit 1) are required to stop statin 
therapy immediately following this initial visit and must undergo a [ADDRESS_755546] a pre- randomization visit for assessment of 
their fasting LDL cholesterol levels.  Subjects with fasting LDL cholesterol values >200  mg/dL at Screening 
Visit [ADDRESS_755547] of care.  
Subjects who are not using statin therapy at Screening Visit 1 are required to provide a fasting blood sample at 
Screening Visit  2, which can occur at any time prior to randomization but after signing of the ICF .  Statin-free 
subjects with fasting LDL choles terol values  >200 mg/dL at either Screening Visit will be excluded from the 
study and should be managed according to standard of care.  
Double-Blind Phase : 
At the Randomization ( Day 1) Visit, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive OCA 5  mg, 
OCA 10 mg, OCA 25  mg or placebo, orally once daily, for 16 weeks.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_575763] ( fasting serum LDL cholesterol at Screening Visit  2; ≤125 mg/dL or >125 mg/dL)  and baseline 
fibrosis stage (stage 1, 2 or stage 3,  4). 
At the Week  4 Visit, all subjects will initiate treatment with atorvastatin at a dose of 10  mg once daily.  At the 
Week 8 Visit, atorvastatin will be increased to 20  mg once daily  (if 10 mg daily is tolerated) , and continued for 
an additional 4  weeks.  After 4 weeks of treatment at 20 mg, the atorvastatin dose may be titrated (up or down) 
as clinically indicated.  The final visit during the double -blind phase will occur at Week  16, after which subjects 
may continue into the open -label LTSE phase.  
Subjects who discontinue investigational product or atorvastatin during the double -blind phase are still expected 
to attend scheduled study visits and  are to be followed through the Week 16 Visit.  
Subjects who discontinue atorvastatin during the double-blind pha se are eligible to continue OCA during the 
double-blind phase and enroll into the LTSE at the discretion of the Investigator , provided they continue to meet 
the LDLc cutoff of exclusion criteria #4 ( ie, LDLc <200 mg/dL).    
LTSE Phase:  
During the LTSE phase, all subjects will be treated with open-label OCA 10 mg or OCA 25 mg .  Subjects 
randomized to placebo or OCA 5  mg during the double -blind phase will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
OCA 10 mg or OCA 25 mg  upon entry into and throughout the LTSE phase.  Subjects randomized to OCA 
10 mg or OCA 25 mg during the double -blind phase will continue on the same dose throughout  the LTSE.   
During the LTSE, subjects may continue with atorvastatin therapy as clinically indicated.

(end of the double-blind phase) compared to Baseline will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
Analyses of observed LDL values will be carried out using an analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) model at each 
visit with change from baseline as the dependent variable, including treatment group and randomization 
stratification factor as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate.  The same analysis will be car ried out using 
percentage change from baseline as the dependent variable.  
Descriptive statistics of the values will be summarized by [CONTACT_6982].  The results, change from baseline, and percentage change from baseline values as well as estimates of least -square (LS) means, standard 
errors, and 95%  confidence intervals ( CIs) will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].   
The comparison of LDL change from baseline and percentage change from baseline values between each active treatment group and placebo group will be performed as exploratory analysis.  Estimates of the LS mean difference between each active treatment group and placebo group, the standard error of the difference, and 95% CI of the difference will be presented.  
The secondary parameters will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary efficacy variables.   Descriptive 
statistics will be generated  and will include  change from baseline, percentage change from baseline, and 
estimates of LS means, standard errors, and 95%  CIs presented by [CONTACT_1570].  
The secondary parameters related to lipoprotein metabolism include HDL cholesterol concentration, particle size and particle concentration; VLDL cholesterol concentration, particle size and particle concentration ; TG 
and total cholesterol conc entrations; and apolipoprotein (Apo)A1, ApoB, ApoE, ApoCII, ApoCIII and Lp(a) 
concentrations . 
The secondary parameters related to reverse cholesterol metabolism include pre- β1 HDL concentration, 
macrophage cholesterol efflux; lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity; and cholesterol ester 
transfer protein (CETP) activity.  
The baseline value for efficacy analyses is defined as the last value prior to administration of investigational 
product on Day 1 (predose).

Confidential and Proprietary  The following exploratory parameters will be analyzed in the same manner as the secondary efficacy variable :  
markers of liver biochemistry, liver function, liver inflammation, apoptosis, liver fibrosis, glycemic control, and 
bile acids.  Additionally, descriptive statistics will be generated  and will include change from baseline, 
percentage change from baseline, and estimates of  LS means, standard errors, and 95% CIs presented by 
[CONTACT_1570].  Changes from baseline will be summarized for anthropometric measures .  PK analysis will be 
done using non -compartmental methods.  The values will be summarized by [CONTACT_575765].  Only samples that have a confirmed fasting of approximately 8 hours or more before their 
visit will be incl uded in the PK analysis.  Further details regarding specific parameters and methods will be 
described in the Statistical Analysis Plan . 
Safety Analyses : 
All safety analyses will be based on the Safety Population.  The incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) and serious AEs ( SAEs) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_575766], and similarly by [CONTACT_22056].  The incidence of pre- treatment AEs and 
pre-treatment SAEs occurring  after informed consent form signoff and before the first dosing of investigational 
product (OCA or placebo) will be tabulated in the same manner as above for all subjects participating in the 
washout period.  
Laboratory parameters, physical examinations i ncluding vital signs, and ECGs will be summarized by [CONTACT_575767] -Baseline visit.  The absolute change 
from baseline will also be summarized.  
LTSE Analyses: 
Similar analyses to that which are described above will be conducted for the LTSE using the double -blind 
baseline value.  Analyses based on the double -blind baseline will be performed using randomized treatment 
groups (placebo, OCA 5 mg, OCA 10 mg, or OCA 25 mg).   Sensitivity analyses may be conducted using the 
last value prior to first dose in the LTSE for all subjects.   
Sample Size Justification: 
It is the intent of this study to characterize the components of LDL metabolism (cholesterol concentration, 
particle size, particle concentration ) in subjects with NASH before and after treatment with OCA and to assess 
the changes induced by [CONTACT_575768] A reductase inhibitor (atorvastatin) therapy.  Assuming  a 22 mg/dL 
increase from baseline with a standard deviation of 24 in LDL in the OCA 25 mg group  without atorvastatin 
therapy after 16 weeks of treatment based on data from FLINT , a sample size of 2 0 subjects per group will 
provide greater than 97.3% power to demonstrate the statistically  significant difference of LDL increase from  
baseline with a 2-sided type I error of 0.05.

Confidential and Proprietary  5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Overview of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis and Obeticholic Acid  
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered to be the hepatic manifestation of 
metabolic syndrome, a cluster of closely related clinical features linked to visceral obesity and 
characterized by [CONTACT_30361], dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and hypertension ( Chalasani 2012, 
Angulo 2011).  NAFLD is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the western 
hemisphere, and as the prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome rises, a parallel rise of 
NAFLD across  the world is generally expected.  NAFLD is thought to be represented by a 
spectrum of histological disease, which progresses from pure fatty liver (simple steatosis) to 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).  While NAFLD itself is considered a relatively be nign and 
reversible condition, up to one-third of patients in the spectrum of NAFLD develop NASH, a chronic, serious, life- threatening, inflammatory liver disease characterized by [CONTACT_575769], inflammation, and progressive fibrosis.  As opposed t o simple steatosis, NASH is 
associated with significant morbidity and progression that, if left untreated, can progress to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver-related death (Vernon 2011). 
Of all the histologic features of NASH, fibrosis is considered the strongest predictor of adverse clinical outcomes, including liver -related death (Younossi 2011, Ekstedt 2014) .  Patients with 
NASH develop progressive fibrosis over a period of 4 to 6 years ( Pagadala 2012) and 21% to 
26% of these patients develop cirrhosis in 8.2 years ( Loomba 2013).  In patients with NASH who 
have progressed to cirrhosis, it is estimated 38% to 45% have liver failure after 7 years to 10 years, and 2% to 5% of this population will develop HCC per year ( Organisation 2012).  
Accumulating evidence suggests that  patients with NASH can progress to HCC, even in the 
absence of apparent cirrhosis (Williams 2013 , Ertle 2011).  
There are currently no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_575544].  The therapeutic options for NASH are largely limited to lifestyle modifications and 
treatment of concurrent conditions such as diabetes ( Chalasani 2012, Neuschwander-Tetri 2003, 
Sanyal 2010, Belfort 2006), although practice guidelines from the American Association for the 
Study of Liver Diseases recommend the use of vitamin E as first line therapy for patients with NASH without diabetes. 
In view of the serious nature of the disease, the increasing prevalence, the complications that 
arise from the disease, and the clear unmet medical need, evaluation of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_575545].  
Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a modified bile acid and farnesoid  X receptor (FXR) agonist that is 
derived from the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA).  CDCA is the natural ligand 
for FXR, which is a nuclear receptor expressed at high levels in the liver, intestine, kidney, and adrenal glands.  In the liver, FXR is expressed in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and endothelial 
cells, and at a low level in hepatic stellate cells.  Nuclear receptors constitute a family of 
ligand-activated transcription factors that can either  activate or repress a variety of target genes.  
OCA is [ADDRESS_755579] CDCA, which makes OCA an 
attractive novel therapeutic agent for NAFLD and NASH due to its multiple FXR- mediated 
effects, including an increase in in sulin sensitivity, glucose and lipid metabolism; hepatocyte 
Page 26 of 364
Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  [ADDRESS_755580] bile acid -induced cytotoxicity; anti- inflammatory effects in liver and 
vasculature; and prevention and reversal of liver fibrosis ( Mudaliar 2013, Adorini 2012).  Thus, 
there is strong rationale to advance OCA for the treatment of NASH based on its FXR -mediated 
hepatoprotective properties, and results that indicate OCA improves glycemia by [CONTACT_575770], enhances glucose -stimulated insulin secretion, and inhibits hepatic 
lipid synthesis and content while inducing lipid uptake by [CONTACT_575771]. 
5.2. NASH, Lipoprotein Metabolism, and Statins  
NAFLD is the most common cause of incidental abnormal serum liver enzymes and is associated 
with dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_575546] -risk of cardiovascular events.  Statins have been shown to reduce the 
risk of major coronary and vascular events in NAFLD ( Pastori 2015).  There has been some 
concern that patients with underlying liver disease are at an increased risk of hepatotoxicity because the statins are hepatically cleared and can cause elevations in liver enzymes.   However, 
there have also been studies that have shown that elevated serum transaminases secondary to comorbid conditions like NAFLD or NASH may be improved by [CONTACT_575772] ( Athyros 2010, 
Pastori 2015).  Atherogenic hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], which is defined by [CONTACT_575773]  (TGs), 
decreased high-density lipoprotein ( HDL), and the presence of small, dense low-density 
lipoprotein ( LDL), is frequently associated with NAFLD, thus the treatment of dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_575547] a critical role in the overall management of NAFLD and NASH. 
In the Farnesoid X Receptor Ligand Obeticholic Acid in NASH Treatment (FLINT) Trial 
conducted by [CONTACT_575774] (CRN) at the National Institute of Diabetes 
and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, subjects with non- cirrhotic NASH were randomized to  
either placebo or 25-mg OCA for 72 weeks ( Neuschwander-Tetri 2014).  Subjects in this study 
were representative of the NASH population with baseline total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol 
(LDLc) levels at the high end of normal, HDLc levels within the normal range, and TG levels 
borderline high.  Approximately 50% of subjects were receiving antilipi[INVESTIGATOR_575548].  
Increases in total cholesterol, LDL c, and TG were observed in both treatment groups with 
OCA-treatment being associated with a somewhat greater percentage of subjects exhibiting 
increased concentrations of total cholesterol and LDLc.  Similarly, decreases in HDL cholesterol 
(HDLc) were observed in both treatment groups with a higher percentage of OCA- treated 
subjects compared with placebo.   While the OCA- related changes in lipi[INVESTIGATOR_575549] c trended back towards baseline values with 
continued treatment, it is important to characterize the mechanism of OCA treatment on lipi[INVESTIGATOR_575550].  
Using nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR) lipid profiling, it will be possible to characterize the 
effect of OCA on the actual concentration  and sizes of the particles within each lipoprotein class.  
While a standard lipid panel measures the cholesterol or TG content of lipoproteins, it does not 
measure the actual particle concentration .  The cholesterol and TG content of LDL, HDL, and 
very low-density lipoprotein ( VLDL) particles is not constant, but varies widely among 
individuals and over time.  Even within a given lipoprotein class, the sizes of the particles are not uniform as the relative amounts of cholesterol and TG carried in the core of a lipoprotein particle 
varies across individuals.  Compositional differences also relate to plasma TG levels with LDL and HDL particles becoming more cholesterol -depleted and TG -rich as plasma TG levels 
increase.  Thus, presentation of the same measured  concentration of LDL in 2 patients may

Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  19 Dec 2016   
Page 28 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  represent significantly different numbers of LDL particles and, therefore, a different risk for 
cardiovascular disease (Jeyarajah 2006, Otvos 2006).  The patient with the higher number of 
small, atherogenic LDL particles would be considered to be at higher cardiovascular risk.  Thus, 
NMR lipid profiling, which allows differentiation of particle size and number, will provide a 
better understa nding of the mechanistic impact of OCA treatment on lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].  
Recent evidence also suggests that HDL -mediated atheroprotection is largely governed through 
regulation of reverse cholesterol transport from macrophages within atherosclerotic plaques to HDL acceptor particles for ultimate return to the liver and biliary excretion (Rohatgi 2014).  
Thus, this study will also assess macrophage efflux and candidate components of this pathway to 
further elucid ate the mechanism of OCA and atorvastatin treatment on lipi[INVESTIGATOR_575551]. 
5.3. Mechanism of Action of Obeticholic Acid  
CDCA is the principal natural ligand of FXR in humans.  When cellular levels are high, the negative feedback pathway inhibits the further synthesis of bile.  OCA is structurally related to CDCA and differs by [CONTACT_1121] a single ethyl group ( the chemical name [CONTACT_22167] 
3α 7α-dihydroxy-6α- ethyl-5βcholan-24- oic acid.  It is also referred to as 
6α-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid, or (6- ECDCA) and as an agonist it is approximately 100-fold 
more potent than CDCA in vitro ( Pellicciari 2002 ).  OCA is also highly selective for FXR and 
does not bind other nuclear receptors, and with the exception of weakly activating the dedicated bile acid receptor TGR5, it does not activate any G -protein coupled receptors ( CEREP 2008).  
OCA is an attractive novel therapeutic agent for NAFLD and NASH due to its multiple 
FXR-mediated effects including an increase in insulin sensitivity, hepatocyte protection against 
bile acid-induced cytotoxicity, anti-inflammatory effects in liver and vasculature, and prevention 
and reversal of liver fibrosis (Adorini 2012, Mudaliar 2013) .  Specifically:  
• FXR and other identified bile acid receptors, such as TGR5, play a role in regulating key aspects of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism; thus, serving as important 
mediators of energy expenditure and metabolic homeostasis. 
• FXR agonists have been shown to suppress hepatic fatty acid and TG synthesis 
through down-regulation of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1c) and increase hepatic fatty acid  oxidation through up-regulation of pyruvate 
dehydrogenase kinase 4 ( Lefebvre 2009). 
• FXR activation has insulin -sensitizing effects.  In mice fed a high-fat diet, treatment 
with recombinant fibroblast growth factor-19 ( FGF-19) improves indices of 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hepatic steatosis, hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia, and insulin 
sensitivity, while reducing body weight and adiposity ( Fu 2004).  Studies in FXR 
knockout mice show that FXR is involved in the regulation of insulin signaling 
pathways and the receptor appears to have a beneficial role in decreasing insulin 
resistance (both hepatic and in skeletal muscle) and gluconeogenesis, as well as in 
regulating TG, free fatty acid, and lipid levels.

Confidential and Proprietary  • Treatment of OCA at doses of 25 mg and 50 mg for 6  weeks resulted in increased 
insulin sensitivity and reduced markers of liver inflammation and fibrosis in subjects 
with NAFLD a nd type 2 diabetes mellitus  (Mudaliar 2013). 
• Treatment with OCA at a dose of 25 mg for 72 weeks was superior to placebo in 
improving not only the key histologic features important in the underlying 
pathophysiology of the disease (inflammation, ballooning, steatosis), but notably that OCA was superior to placebo in improving fibrosis, a strong predictor of liver- related 
death (Neuschwander -Tetri 2014). 
The FXR-SHP cascade is postulated to mediate the links between lipid and glucose metabolism 
(Zhang 2008, Cariou 2006, Rizzo 2006, Ma 2006, Shulman 2005). 
OCA induces lipid uptake by [CONTACT_575775] (3T3-L1) and primary human adipocytes, which correlate with reduced hepatic and circulating lipid levels, together with increased insulin sensitivity (Rizzo 2009, Rizzo 2006).  Moreover, OCA significantly enhances adiponectin and 
leptin secretion by [CONTACT_575776], which can enhance insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.  Pancreatic beta cells express FXR messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein, and OCA significantly enhances insulin secretion by [CONTACT_38383] β- TC6 cells and human 
pancreatic islets (Rizzo 2009) .  
Collectively, these results indicate that OCA improves glycemia by [CONTACT_575777], enhancing glucose- stimulated insulin secretion, and inhibiting hepatic lipid synthesis and 
content while inducing lipid uptake by [CONTACT_575771] ( Adorini 2012, Mudaliar 2013). 
5.4. Nonclinical Experience with Obeticholic Acid  
Nonclinical studies have shown several potentially beneficial properties of FXR agonism in NASH, including 
Effects of OCA on g lycemic, metabolic, and cardiovascular properties  
• FXR plays a role in bile acid homeostasis, metabolism, and clearance (Zhang 2008, 
Ma 2006, Cariou 2006). 
• FXR controls glucose metabolism through regulation of gluconeogenesis and 
glycogenolysis in the liver, as well as regulation of peripheral insulin sensitivity in 
striated muscle and adipose tissue (Mudaliar 2013,  Zhang 2006). 
• In nonclinical models, FXR agonism is associated with beneficial effects on body 
weight and composition ( Xu 2009, Fu 2004). 
• The absence of endogenous intact FXR signaling results in dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_83281] a hepatic 
phenotype similar to NASH patients (Zhang 2008 ).  Conversely, FXR agonists lower 
plasma TGs by [CONTACT_575778]  1-c 
(Watanabe 2004) and increased hepatic fatty acid oxidation (Savkur 2005). 
• In addition, OCA and other FXR agonists are anti- atherogenic and cardioprotective in 
animal models (Hartman 2009, Miyazaki -Anzai 2010).

Confidential and Proprietary  Anti-inflammatory and a nti-fibrotic effects of OCA  
• OCA exerts direct effects on serum -starved LX2 cells (an immortalized hepatic 
stellate cell line) to reduce the expression of key fibrotic genes (collagen I, alpha 
smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor β- 1 and matrix metalloproteinases; 
(Albanis 2005).  
• In primary and cultured hepatocytes treated with pro -inflammatory mediators, OCA 
exerted direct effects to inhibit pro-inflammatory gene expression (eg, tumor necrosis 
factor-α [TNF-α], cyclooxygenase-2 [ COX-2], and inducible nitric oxide synthase 
[iNOS]; (Wang 2008, Li 2007).  
• FXR activation (with WAY -362450) reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and 
hepatic fibrosis in a mouse model of NASH ( Zhang 2009). 
• OCA improved portal hypertension in cirrhosis models ( Mookerjee 2014). 
• OCA inhibited gastrointestinal inflammation and pre serves intestinal barrier function 
in models of inflammatory bowel diseases (Gadaleta 2011).   
Effects of OCA on diabetic nephropathy 
• OCA ameliorates TG accumulation by [CONTACT_575779] a murine model of diet-induced obesity ( Wang 2009) 
• In the same murine model of diet-induced obesity, OCA improves proteinuria, prevents podocyte loss, mesangial expansion, accumulation of extracellular matrix 
proteins, and increased expression of pro -fibrotic growth factors and fibrosis markers, 
and reduces inflammation and oxidative stress ( Wang 2009 ) 
• In a murine model of diabetes, OCA improves renal injury by [CONTACT_575780], 
glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and modulating renal lipid 
metabolism, macrophage infiltration, renal expression of SREBPs, pro-fibrotic growth factors, and oxidative stress enzymes (Wang 2010 ) 
In summary, there is strong rationale to advance OCA for the treatment of NASH based on its FXR-mediated hepatoprotective properties and results indicating that OCA imp roves glycemia 
by [CONTACT_575777], enhances glucose -stimulated insulin secretion, and 
inhibits hepatic lipid synthesis and content while inducing lipid uptake by [CONTACT_575771]. 
5.5. Clinical Experience with Obeticholic Acid  
OCA is under investigation for the treatment of multiple chronic liver diseases, including the treatment of NASH, primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC, also known as primary biliary cholangitis  
[Beuers 2015a , Beuers 2015b, Beuers 2015c ]), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and biliary 
atresia.  The clinical development program for OCA includes the following 3 studies conducted 
using subjects with  NAFLD or NASH:  
• Study 747-203:  A proof-of-concept, Phase 2 study in subjects with type 2 diabetes and 
NAFLD to evaluate the effects of OCA on insulin sensitivity ( Mudaliar 2013)

Confidential and Proprietary  • FXR Ligand OCA in N ASH Treatment (FLINT):  A Phase 2 study conducte d by [CONTACT_575781] 
(Neuschwander- Tetri 2014) 
• Study D8602001:  A Phase 2 study conducted by [CONTACT_575782]’s Asian development partner 
(Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of [ADDRESS_755581] and supporting the potential of 
OCA to treat NAFLD and/or NASH.  With the exception of weight loss, OCA [ADDRESS_755582] as effective as OCA 50 mg for the majority of endpoints evaluated.   
The FLINT study demonstrated that OCA was superior to placebo in improving not only the key 
histologic features important in the underlying pathophysiology of the disease (inflammation, 
ballooning, steatosis), but notably that OCA was superior to placebo in improving fibrosis, a 
strong predictor of liver- related death.  OCA treatment was also associated with improvement in 
markers of hepatocellular injury and some cardiometabolic features including weight and 
systolic blood pressure.  Salutary effects on weight and blood pressure are important 
considerations since patients with NASH present with higher cardiovascular risk given the comorbidities of obesity and diabetes.  
On average, LDL cholesterol demonstrated a significant increase in subjects treated with OCA 
compared to placebo; however, this increase was reversed and LDL cholesterol returned to below baseline levels in subjects who initiated statin therapy.   The change in lipid profile, which 
was attenuated with continued treatment and reversed post-treatment, needs to be further 
investigated mechanistically and with respect to clinical management with standard of care statin therapy.  With the exception of pruritus, which occurred more frequently in the OCA- treated 
subjects (23% OCA versus 6% placebo) and led to 1 discontinuation, the gene ral adverse event 
(AE) profile was similar across both groups.  There were 2 deaths in the FLINT study, both in 
OCA treatment groups (one from sepsis and congestive heart failure, and the other from cardiac 
ischemia or infarction  (Neuschwander -Tetri 2014) .  The event of cardiac ischemia or infarction 
was assessed by [CONTACT_575783]  (Data on File) . 
Study D8602001 demonstrated a dose- dependent increase i n the percentage of OCA- treated 
subjects compared to placebo subjects who achieved the primary endpoint (p = 0.053, not significant).  The 40 mg OCA dose group achieved statistical significance for the primary 
endpoint compared to placebo (p = 0.0496).  Dose -dependent trends not reaching statistical 
significance were also observed for several other pre-specified histologic endpoints, including 
the proportion of subjects with steatosis and inflammation improvement, ballooning resolution, 
and NASH resolution.  In the completer analysis, similar dose -dependent effects were observed, 
with 51% of patients in the 40 mg dose group compared to 22% in the placebo group meeting the 
primary endpoint (p = 0.0061).  With the exception of dose-dependent pruritus, OCA appe ared to 
be generally safe and well tolerated.  The number of pruritus-associated discontinuations were 0, 0, 2, and 5 subjects in the placebo, 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg OCA groups, respectively.  Changes in lipid parameters were directionally similar to thos e observed in the FLINT study.  
Page 31 of 364
Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  [ADDRESS_755583] of treatment with OCA, it is important to characterize the changes observed in circulating cholesterol associated with OCA treatment and the potential for management of those changes.  
FXR has been shown to play an important role in lipid homeostasis and atherosclerosis with  the 
potential to modulate circulating levels of both LDL and HDL cholesterol, which are 
components of cardiovascular prognosis in rodents ( Gautier 2013, Zhang 2010 , Nissen 2007).  
Similarly, the FLINT study demonstrated OCA -related changes in LDL and HDL cholesterol 
(Neuschwander-Tetri 2014).  While the observed changes in LDL cholesterol in both rodents and 
humans run counter to changes that have been typi[INVESTIGATOR_575552], animal data have consistently shown FXR agonism to be associated with reductions in 
atherosclerotic plaque formation.  Rodent studies have shown that this anti- atherogenic effect 
with FXR agonism is possibly due to an increase in the hepatic clearance of excess cholesterol 
(Mencarelli 2009, Hartman 2009, Zhang 2010).  It should be noted that the relevance of these 
findings to humans needs further evaluation due to differences in human and rodent lipid 
physiology.   
In addition to cholesterol concentration, lipoprotein particle concentr ation and sizes have 
emerged as important factors in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk ( Jeyarajah 2006) .  A recent 
Veterans Affairs study assessing LDL  and HDL cholesterol concentrations, as well as particle 
size and numbers, in subjects treated with gemfibrozil demonstrated that these factors were 
stronger predictors of cardiovascular risk or benefit, respectively, than cholesterol concentrations (Otvos 2006).  Consistently, examination of LDL and HDL cholesterol concentrations and 
particle concentration  from the Framingham Offspring cohort (n = 3066), showed that LDL 
particle concentration  was more predictive of cardiovascular risk (Cromwell 2007). 
Given the complex role of FXR in lipid homeostasis, the observations of OCA on HDL and LDL 
concentrations in NAFLD and NASH, and the importance of evaluating the underlying function 
and composition of apolipoproteins, it is essential to evaluate the effect of OCA on these lipid-driven mechanisms of cardiovascular risk/benefit when considering OCA as a potential 
treatment for NASH. As such, this study, 747-209, will evaluate the effect of OCA on lipid

Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  [ADDRESS_755584] analysis of 
efficacy and safety data.  As the intent of the present study is to assess the effects of multiple 
doses of OCA and the subsequent addition of atorvastatin on cholesterol metabolism as well as the safety and tolerability of OCA in subjects with NASH, it is important to include a placebo 
control group to understand the relationship to OCA of any changes observed.  In addition, the combination of OCA and atorvastatin (or any other statin) has not been previously evaluated in clinical studies; thus, the placebo control group, which will be treated with atorvastatin, will 
provide comparative information regarding the safety and tolerability of the OCA and 
atorvastatin combination compared to atorvastatin alone.  
5.6.3. Rationale for OCA Doses 
The selection of OCA doses for the present study (5 mg, 10 mg, and 25 mg) was guided by [CONTACT_575784], double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 
and Phase 3 studies in subjects with NAFLD, NASH, and  PBC as described in Section  5.5 
above. 
In Study 747-203, subjects with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD were treated with placebo, OCA 
25 mg, or OCA 50 mg for 6  weeks.  Although both doses were similarly efficacious, there were 
clinically significant increases in the LDL c levels in both OCA dose groups, with a significant 
reduction in HDL observed in the OCA 50  mg treatment group.  Similarly, OCA was efficacious 
and well-tolerated in the subsequent, Phase 2, randomized, double- blind FLINT study, which 
evaluated OCA 25 mg and placebo in subjects with NASH over a period of72 weeks.  In this 
study, small but statistically significant changes in the levels of total cholesterol and LDL c levels 
(increase from Baseline), and HDL levels (decrease from Baseline) were observed with OCA 
treatment.  Due to the similarity in efficacy and the observed lipoprotein changes in the two 
Phase [ADDRESS_755585] of OCA on pruritus and serum lipid levels, both 5 mg and 10 mg daily will be 
evaluated in the proposed NASH study in addition to the 25-mg dose.

Confidential and Proprietary  5.6.4. Rationale for the Use of Atorvastatin 
Subsequent to diet and lifestyle modification, statin therapy is recommended for the management 
of cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular risk globally ( Perk 2012, NICE 2014, Stone 2014).  
Atorvastatin is one of the most commonly used statins worldwide ( Jackevicius 2012).  
Historically, statin therapy has been contraindicated  in subjects with elevations in liver 
aminotransferases .  However, several studies have evaluated statin use in chronic liver diseases 
where cardiovascular risk is a sig nificant concern and the consensus findings ha ve not shown an 
increased risk  of hepatotoxicity in subjects with elevated liver  aminotransferases.  Calderon et al 
reported that statin treatment is safe and can improve both liver aminotransferase levels and 
reduce cardiovascular morbidity ( Calderon 2010, Tikkanen 2013, Athyros 2010). 
The increase in L DL cholesterol levels in the OCA -treated NASH population observed in 
clinical studies may predispose these subjects to  increased cardiovascular risk.   Atorvasta tin is 
one of the most widely prescribed statins for dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_575553] (Jackevicius 2012, 
Jackevicius 2013).  The atorvastatin prescribing information suggests a starting dose of 10 mg, 
with dose adjustments every 2 to 4 weeks.  In line with this recommendation, all subjects will be 
started at an atorvastatin dose of 10 mg at Week 4 , titrating to 20  mg atorvastatin at Week 8  (if 
10 mg daily is tolerated) , and allowing for further dose adjustments at Week [ADDRESS_755586] indicated dose (10 mg once daily), subjects with excessive ( >300 U/L) elevations in 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), pre-existing cardiovascular dise ase, and those with elevated 
cardiovascular risk (eg , unstable hypertension) will be e xcluded.  Finally, liver function, 
cholesterol levels, and vital signs will be monitored at all visits in this study, and investigational 
product will be withdrawn or its dosing interrupted in subjects who develop elevated levels of 
liver enzymes per protocol discontinuation criteria (see Section  8.4.1).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for Statin Withdrawal  
The intent of this study is to assess the increase in LDL cholesterol with OCA and then to 
determine the extent to which this can be mitigated with appropriate use of statin therapy.  
Therefore, participating subjects need to either be statin-free or have washed off of their current 
statin therapy.  Given the clear role of statins in reducing cardiovascular risk, it is imperative to minimize the potential risk associated with withdrawing statin therapy.  These steps include 
minimizing  the duration of statin withdrawal and exclusion of subjects for whom removal of 
statin therapy is of significant concern.  
Duration of stat in withdrawal  
A statin withdrawal period of 5  weeks was selected and is similar to other recent studies in 
statin-using patients where a 4 -week washout period was employed ( Teramoto 2012, 
Teramoto  2014).  The extra week in the present study allows for the assessment of LDL levels 
after 4 weeks of washout, and based on prior studies, assumes levels of LDL to be stable after 
4 weeks, and enables the stratification of subjects at randomization on Day 1 by [CONTACT_500099].   
Following randomization, subjects will be treated with OCA or placebo for 4 weeks prior to the 
introduction of atorvastatin.  Based on data in healthy subjects, PBC, and NAFLD, 4 weeks is 
Page 34 of 364
Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  [ADDRESS_755587] 
subjects.   
Overall, statin therapy will be withheld from subjects for a maximum of 9  weeks:  5 weeks prior 
to randomization on Day 1 and 4 weeks following randomization.  This duration of statin 
withdrawal is less than the combined withdrawa l period used in the Teramoto et al study, which 
included a group of subjects who had statin therapy withheld for a total of 16 weeks (4 week 
washout period followed by 12 weeks of placebo treatment) ( Teramoto 2014).  There was no 
appreciable difference in the safety profile of these pati ents compared to those who had statin 
therapy reintroduced after the washout period.  Further support for the minimal impact of short-term discontinuation of statins is seen in follow -up analyses of the Treating to New Target 
study which showed that even i n patients with stable coronary artery disease, that a [ADDRESS_755588] cardiac events ( McGowan 2004). 
Exclusion of subjects at elevated risk 
Subjects where the removal of a statin would be considered to be clinically concerning are 
excluded from participation in this study.  At risk subjects include subjects with existing cardiovascular disease (including but not limited to stable or unstable angina, previous 
myocardial infarction or stroke or a previous peripheral or  coronary revascularization procedure), 
significant dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (as defined by [CONTACT_575785] ≥190 mg/dL) despi[INVESTIGATOR_575554], 
unstable hypertension, and familial hypercholesterolemia.  
Safety monitoring during the off-statin period 
All subjects will have frequent safety assessments prior to and following the reintroduction of 
statin therapy.  Following Screening  Visit 1, subjects will hav e 4 visits to the study site over the 
9-week period prior to initiation of atorvastatin:  Screening Visit  2/Week -1, 
Randomization/Day 1, Week  [ADDRESS_755589] of sustained 
treatment with  OCA; all subjects will then initiate atorvastatin therapy, in addition to their 
blinded treatment, and the effect on lipoprotein metabolism will be evaluated over an additional 
[ADDRESS_755590] of atorvastatin on the OCA  treatment -induced alterations in the 
lipoprotein profile of statin-naïve and stat in-washed out NASH subjects. 
Following the double-blind phase, subjects may volunteer to continue in a 2 -year open -label 
long-term safety extension ( LTSE) during which all subjects will receive OCA.  During the 
LTSE, LDL cholesterol will be managed as clinically indicated.  The LTSE will evaluate the 
long-term safety of OCA and atorvastatin  treatment and the effect of OCA and atorvastatin on 
histological markers of NASH.

As Study 747-209 is  a randomized, double-blind study, the double-blind data will not be

subjects continuing in the LTSE, Investigators, and the Sponsor will remain blinded to subjects’

An increase in liver enzymes and hepatic AEs, including jaundice, were observed in subjects 
with liver disease at OCA doses between 10  mg and 50 mg .  Elevated liver enzymes were 
observed in healthy subjects who were treated at doses ≥100 mg in Phase 1, multiple -dose 
studies; however, these elevations were only considered to be of clinical concern at the maximum dose of [ADDRESS_755592] baseline values with continued 
treatment through to 72 weeks.

potential risks with the investigational product.  
5.8. Summary of Known Potential R isks with Atorvastatin  
Muscle complaints are the most frequent adverse reports among patients treated with statins with 
the most severe side effects including myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.  The Statin Muscle Safety 
Task Force ( Rosenson 2014) has provided a classification of the spectrum of statin- associated 
muscle AEs that may be seen in clinical practice and can be used in characterizing reports of 
muscle-related events.  
a. Myalgia – unexplained muscle discomfort often described as “flu -like” symptoms  
− Muscle aches  
− Muscle soreness  
− Muscle stiffness  
− Muscle tenderness  
− Muscle cramps with or shortly after exercise (not nocturnal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) 
Page 36 of 364

Page 37 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  b. Myopathy – muscle weakness (not attributed to pain and not necessarily associated 
with elevated CPK)  
c. Myositis – muscle inflammation  
d. Myonecrosis – muscle enzyme elevations or hyperCPKemia 
− Mild >3x baseline or ULN 
− Moderate ≥10x baseline or ULN 
− Severe ≥50x baseline or ULN 
e. Clinical Rhabdomyol ysis - Myonecrosis with myoglobinuria or acute renal failure 
(increase in serum creatinine ≥0.5 mg/dL  
There is no evidence that these muscle- related AEs are a continuum beginning with myalgia and 
progressing to more severe manifestations of myopathy; rather events occur independent of each 
other.  Myalgia events, with frequencies ranging from 1 % to 5% in clinical trials to 11% to 29% 
in observational cohorts, typi[INVESTIGATOR_380618] 1 month of statin initiation and resolve within 
2 weeks of stati n cessation ( Rosenson 2014).   Retrospective analyses have suggested that 
patients who discontinue statins due to intolerance are able to tolerate statins long- term following 
re-challenge ( Zhang 2013, Mampuya 2013).    
Historically, statins have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function, but 
available data suggest that increases in liver transaminases associated with statins are asymptomatic and generally reversible ( Desai 2014 ).  In the absence of liver disease, US 
guidelines ( Stone 2013) recommend that baseline transaminase levels should be checked before 
initiating statin therapy and subsequent testing should only be done in the presence of symptoms suggestive of hepatic disease.   As this study is being conducted in subjects with conf irmed 
NASH, liver enzymes will be frequently monitored and Section  [IP_ADDRESS], Section  [IP_ADDRESS], and 
Appendix B  provide detailed guidance for handling elevated liver biochemistry values.  
Statins modestly increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in individuals with risk factors for 
diabetes.  Individuals receiving statin therapy should be evaluated for new- onset diabetes 
according to the current diabetes screening guidelines ( American Diabetes Association 2013).  
Confusion and memory loss have been reported with statins, but medical evidence supporting a 
causal effect is weak or nonexistent ( Simic 2015).   However, any reports of cognitive events 
should be appropriately evaluated, particularly in individuals whose symptoms persist despi[INVESTIGATOR_575555]. 
In this study, any AE s (including signs and symptoms described above) regardless of relationship 
to investigational product or s tudy medication, must be documented appropr iately 
(see Section  12). 
If treatment with statins is initiated, women of childbearing potential must be informed that statin 
use is contraindicated  during pregnancy.  Methods of contraception should be reviewed and 
modified, if necessary, to ensure highly effective methods with failure rates <1% per year, such 
as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices, sexual 
abstinence, or history of vasectomy of partner are used.

(ie, statin-free) and statin -treated subjects may be enrolled.  Statin- treated subjects will be 
required to stop statin treatment (after signing informed consent) for up to 5 weeks , including 
a 4-week statin washout period, prior to Randomization/Day  1. 
Screening Period:  
Subjects will have a screening period of up to 5 week s prior to Randomization/Day 1.     
Subjects using statins within 30 days of the initial Screening Visit (Screening Visit 1) are 
required to stop statin therapy immediately following this initial visit and must undergo a [ADDRESS_755594] a 
pre-randomization visit for assessment of their fasting LDL cholesterol levels.  Subjects with 
fasting LDL cholesterol values >200 mg/dL at Screening Visit [ADDRESS_755595] of care.  
Subjects who are not using statin therapy at Screening Visit 1 are required to provide a fasting 
blood sample at Screening Visit 2, which can occur at any time prior to randomization but after 
signing of the ICF.  Statin free subjects with fasting LDL cholesterol values >200 mg/dL at either Screening Visit will be excluded from the study and should be managed according to 
standard of c are. 
Double-Blind Phase:  
At the Randomization (Day 1) Visit, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive 
OCA 5 mg , OCA 10 mg , OCA 25 mg , or placebo, orally, once daily, for 16 weeks.  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_7416] -randomization fasted serum LDL cholesterol 
concentration (≤125 mg/dL or >125 mg/dL) and baseline fibrosis stage (stage 1, 2 or stage 3, 4). 
At the Week  4 Visit, all subjects will initiate treatment with atorvastatin at a dose of 10  mg once 
daily.  At the Week  8 Visit, atorvastatin will be increased to 20  mg once daily (if 10 mg daily is 
tolerated) , and continued for an additional 4 weeks .  After 4 weeks of treatment at 20 mg, the 
atorvastatin dose may be titrated (up or down) as clinically indicated.  The final visit during the 
double-blind phase will occur at Week  16, after which subjects may continue into the open- label 
LTSE.  
Subjects who discontinue investigational product or atorvastatin during the double-blind phase 
are still expected to attend scheduled study visits and are to be followed through the Week 16 
Visit.

Confidential and Proprietary  7.1.3. Study Duration  
The overall study duration is up to 125 weeks including a Screening period of up to 5 weeks 
(depending on current statin use), a 16-week double-blind treatment phase, and a 2- year, 
open-label LTSE.   The LTSE may be terminated earlier by [CONTACT_575788], or for other reasons as described in Section 8.4.3. 
7.2. Number of Subjects  
Approximately 80 subjects who meet the eligibility criteria , including biopsy-confirmed NASH 
and evidence of liver fibrosis, but no hepatic decompensation, will be included in this study .  A 
maximum of 30% of subjects will have stage 4 fibrosis. 
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
Eligible subjects will be randomized into 4 groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive OCA 5 mg, 
OCA 10 mg, OCA 25  mg, or placebo during the double-blind phase of the study.  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_575789] ( fasting serum LDL cholesterol at  
Screening Visit 2; ≤125 mg/dL or >125 mg/ dL) and baseline fibrosis stage (stage 1, 2 or stage 3, 
4).  All subjects will also receive atorvastatin starting at We ek 4 at 10 mg daily, escalating to 
20 mg at Week  8 (if 10 mg daily is tolerated) , with further dose adjustments to be performed as 
clinically indicated at Week  12, and throughout the LTSE phase.  Subjects will receive 
open-label OCA 10 mg or OCA 25 mg  during the LTSE  depending on their double-blind 
randomized dose (see Section 7.1 ).  The study design schematic is shown in Figure  1.  
7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria 
7.4.1. Investigational Product Dose Adjustments 
Dose adjustments of investigational product are not permitted during the double-blind phase.  
Please refer to Section 8.4.[ADDRESS_755600] is discontinued. 
During the LTSE phase, al l subjects will be treated with open-label OCA 10 mg or 25 mg.  
Subjects randomized to placebo or OCA 5 mg during the double-blind phase will be 
re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio  through IWRS to OCA 10 mg or OCA 25 mg upon entry into and 
throughout the LTSE phase.  Subjects randomized to OCA 10 mg will continue to receive OCA 
10 mg throughout the LTSE.  Subjects randomized to OCA 25 mg will continue to receive OCA 
25 mg throughout the LTSE.  Subjects may continue with atorvastatin t herapy as clinically 
indicated.  
7.4.2. Atorvastatin D ose Adjustments  
For all subjects, atorvastatin therapy will be initiated at a dose of 10  mg at Week  4.  At Week  8 
the dose will be increased to 20 mg  (if 10 mg daily is tolerated), and following the Week 12 
Visit, the dose can be adjusted to manage cholesterol as clinically indicated ( Section 9 and 
Appendix A ).  During the LTSE, subjects may continue with atorvastatin therapy as clinically 
indicated.

Confidential and Proprietary  If at any time during the double-blind or LTSE phases, serum chemistry results indicate  
LDLc<40 mg /dL, the subject should be brought back to the site within [ADDRESS_755601] 
result is obtained for an unscheduled (repeat) laboratory assessment.  If LDLc<40 mg/dL is 
obtained on [ADDRESS_755602] may discontinue or reduce the dose of atorvastatin.  
Subjects may also interrupt or discontinue atorvastatin due to tolerability issues  including 
muscle-related symptoms ( Section 5.8) and abnormal liver biochemistry.  Any muscle- related 
complaints should be assessed per the ACC/AHA Guidelines ( Appendix A ) and statin dose 
adjusted accordingly:   
• To avoid unnecessary discontinuation of statins, obtain a history of prior or current 
muscle symptoms to establish a baseline prior to initiation of statin therapy . 
• If mild to moderate muscle symptoms develop during statin therapy:  
− Discontinue the statin until symptoms can be evaluated . 
− Evaluate the patient for other conditions that might increase the risk for muscle symptoms . 
− If muscle symptoms resolve , and if no contraindication exists, re- challenge the 
subject with the same or a reduced dose of atorvastatin to establish a causal 
relationship between the muscle symptoms and statin therapy . 
− Once a low dose statin is tolerated, the dose may be gradually increased as 
tolerated and clinically indicated . 
− If after 2 months without statin treatment, muscle symptoms or elevated C PK 
levels do not completely resolve, consider other causes of muscle symptoms. 
− If persistent muscle symptoms are determined to arise f rom a condition unrelated 
to statin therapy, or if the predisposing condition has been treated, resume statin 
therapy at the original dose . 
• If unexplained severe muscle symptoms or fatigue develop during statin therapy, 
discontinue the statin and address the possibility of rhabdomyolysis by [CONTACT_575790] K 
and serum creatinine, and performing urinalysis for myoglobinuria. 
Elevations in liver biochemistry should be monitored per protocol subject withdrawal criteria 
(Section 8.4 and Appendix B ). 
Subjects who discontinue atorvastatin may continue on investigational product through the 
double-blind and LTSE phases, as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_24318], 
and provided they continue to meet exclusion criteria #4 (LDLc <200 mg/dL). 
7.4.3. Safety Criteria for Adjustment or Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_575556] C ommittee (DMC) will review safety data from this study as well as other 
ongoing OCA studies on a periodic basis ( Section 13.8).  Adjustments to or discontinuation of 
treatment may be considered based on DMC evaluation of OCA safety and tolerability.  The criteria for study termination are described in Section 7.5.

The Investigator and/or the Sponsor (or designee) must notify the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) of discontinuation of a site or the study and the 
reason(s) for doing so. 
Investigators will be informed by [CONTACT_575792], 
and should then schedule all subjects for the End of Study (EOS) or E arly Termination (ET) 
Visit.

8.4.1. Reasons for Mandatory Discontinuation of Investigational Product  or 
Atorvastatin 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events ≥Grade [ADDRESS_755610] experiences an AE that is ≥Grade 3 in severity ( Section 12.1.4) that is considered 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to investigational product, the investigational product 
must be discontinued. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy  
Whenever the site is notified of a possible pregnancy, the subject should be asked to come in for 
an unscheduled visit to perform a serum pregnancy test.  If a female subject becomes pregnant, 
she must discontinue treatment with  investigational product and  atorvastatin immediately , but 
should continue with the study visit schedule and must be followed by [CONTACT_22108].  The mother (and infant) will be followed as considered appropriate by [CONTACT_512235].  As described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], pregnancy is not 
considered an AE for reporting purposes. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severe Drug -Induced Liver Injury  
If a subject develops  signs and symptoms of a severe drug-induced liver injury, regardless of 
causality, investigational product and atorvastatin  should be interrupted until the event has 
resolved or returned to baseline, but the subject should continue with the study visit schedule.  
Subjects who develop significant drug-induced liver injury, which is considered to be causally 
Page 52 of 364
Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  [ADDRESS_755611] be followed until the AE has resolved, stabilized, or is not of clinical concern.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Myonecrosis  
Moderate myonecrosis as defined by [CONTACT_575795] ≥10x the untreated baseline levels or ULN.  
Muscle-related symptoms that do not necessitate mandatory discontinuation of investigational 
product or atorvastatin  are detailed in Section 5.8. 
8.4.2. Reasons for Mandatory Interruption of Investigational Product 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events ≥Grade [ADDRESS_755612] experiences an AE categorized as ≥Grade [ADDRESS_755613] is required. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Suspected Mild or Modera te Drug-Induced Liver Injury  
Because transient fluctuations of ALT or AST are common, and progression to severe drug-
induced liver injury or acute liver failure is uncommon, automatic discontinuation of investigational product with an elevation of ALT or AST that is >3x ULN/baseline/nadir or total 
bilirubin >2x ULN/baseline/nadir, as described in Appendix B , may be unnecessary.  If a subject 
develops signs of a mild or moderate event of drug-induced liver injury, regardless of causality, investigational product should be interrupted until the event has resolved or returned to baseline, 
but the subject should continue with the study visit schedule.  The subject may restart treatment 
after resolution of the event or return to baseline.  Follow-up procedures, including laboratory evaluations and physical examinations, must be performed after a maximum of [ADDRESS_755614] 
will be allowed to continue treatment. 
Page 53 of 364
Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  [ADDRESS_755615] be made to determine the reason(s) why a subject fails to return for 
his/her final visit or is discontinued from the study.  This information and date must be recorded 
on the appropriate electronic case report form ( eCRF).  The following events are considered 
appropriate reasons for a subject to discontinue from the study: 
• The subject decides that it is in his/her best interest.  It is fully understood that all subjects volunteer for the study and that they may withdraw their consent to continue 
in the study at any time  
• The Investigator or Sponsor considers that it is advisable or in the best interest of the subject  
• There is a major violation of the clinical study protocol 
• Noncompliance of the subject  
• An inability to provide plasma or urine samples  
8.4.4. Subject Discontinuation Notification  
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as possible if any subject prematurely 
discontinues from the study.  The date when the subject is withdrawn and the reason for discontinuation must be recorded in the eCRF; additional information may be requested by [CONTACT_575796] a discontinuation narrative.  Subjects will be considered “lost to follow-up” 
only after reasonable, documented attempts to reach the subject prove unsuccessful.  In all cases, 
a reasonable effort must be made to determine the reason(s) that a subject fails to return for 
required study visits or discontinues from the study.  This information must be documented in 
the eCRF.  
If a subject is withdrawn from the study early (regardless of the cause), all of the ET evaluations, 
with the exception of PK procedures, should be performed at the time of withdrawal, to the 
extent possible. 
9. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
9.1. Investigational Product  and Atorvastatin  Treatment Regimen  
While placebo, OCA , and atorvastatin are all study medications provided by [CONTACT_1034], for the 
purposes of this protocol , investigational product refers to  OCA or placebo , and study 
medication, where used, refers to atorvastatin.  
Four treatment groups will be evaluated:  placebo, OCA 5 mg, OCA 10  mg, and OCA 25 mg.  
Each dose will be made up of 1 tablet (ie, 1 placebo tablet, 1 OCA 5 -mg tablet, 1 OCA 10 -mg 
tablet, or 1 OCA 25 -mg tablet).  The list of excipi[INVESTIGATOR_575558]. 
Investigational product will be taken orally with water, once daily for the duration of the study.  
Subjects will be instructed to begin dosing on Day [ADDRESS_755616] at 
Page 54 of 364
Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  [ADDRESS_755617] ructed to swallow the tablets whole 
with water; they must not chew, divide, or crush the tablets. 
9.1.1. Double-Blind Period  
Subjects enrolled in the study will be randomized to receive one of the following treatments: 
OCA 5 mg , OCA 10 mg , OCA 25 mg , or placebo, starting on Day 1. 
At the Week  4 Visit, all subjects will also initiate treatment with atorvastatin at a dose of 10  mg 
once daily.  At the Week  8 Visit, atorvastatin will be increased to 20 mg once daily  (if 10 mg 
daily is tolerated) , and continued for an additional 4 weeks.  A fter 4 weeks of treatment at 20 mg, 
the atorvastatin dose may be titrated (up or down) at the Week 12 Visit as clinically indicated 
using the atorvastatin prescribing information and the guidance for lipid management (see Appendix A ).  Blinded treatment with investigational product and open- label atorvastatin will 
continue through the Week [ADDRESS_755618] will be dispensed in bottles of 
30 tablets.  
9.1.2. LTSE 
Subjects who complete the Week  16 Visit of the double-blind phase will be able to participate in 
an open-label LTSE.  The Week  16 Visit of the double-blind phase will be Day 1 of the LTSE 
phase of the study. 
Following completion of Week 16 Visit procedures , all subjects will be treated with open-label 
OCA 10 mg or OCA 25 mg.  S ubjects randomized to placebo or OCA 5 mg during the 
double-blind phase will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_755619] during the LTSE period will be dispensed in bottles of 30 or 100 tablets, 
and subjects will be instructed to take one or more tablets per day per his/her OCA dose 
assignment.  During the LTSE phase, the dose of atorvastatin may remain the same as during the 
double-blind phase or may be modified as clinically indicated per atorvastatin prescribing 
information and lipid management guidelines ( Appendix A ). 
9.2. Concomitant Medications  
Relevant information about all concomitant medications (including prescribed, over- the-counter, 
or herbal preparations) taken prior to (ie, within 12  months of Day 1) and during the study must 
be recorded in the source documents and eCRF, as well as any dose or dose regimen changes that occur during the study. 
9.2.1. Medications with Potential NASH- Modifying Properties  
Doses of TZDs and Vitamin E should be stable 6 months before Day 1 through Week 16.  
Ideally, subjects should generally remain on baseline TZDs and/ or Vitamin  E throughout both 
the double-blind and LTSE phases of the study unless the baseline therapy is no longer 
considered clinically appropriate by [CONTACT_3433] e Investigator.

All diabetes -specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_575559] a stable dose for ≥[ADDRESS_755620] be at a stable dose for ≥6  months prior to Day 1 through 
Week 16.  Ideally, subjects s hould remain on B aseline diabetes -specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_575560], but will be allowed to make changes if the B aseline therapy is no longer 
considered clinically appropriate by [CONTACT_737].  
9.2.3. Management of Changes in Cholesterol 
During the double-blind phase of the study, the dose of atorvastatin administration should be as 
described in this protocol through Week 12 unless tolerability issues develop as referenced in 
Section 7.4.2.  At the Week  12 Visit, I nvestigators may increase or decrease the dose of 
atorvastatin as clinically indicated.  
During the LTSE, I nvestigators may add or change the management of treatment as clinically 
appropriate.  Appendix A  provides a general guidance for cholesterol managem ent including 
monitoring, triggers for intervention, and treatment goals. 
9.2.4. Prohibited Medications  
The medications prohibited per the study enrollment exclusion criteria  and or during the study 
are listed below and summarized in Table 3: 
• Prohibited 30 days  prior to Day 1:

Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  [ADDRESS_755622] of Care and Other Concomitant Medications  
With the exception of Vitamin E,  TZDs and other diabetes -specific therapy, allowed concomitant 
medications should be at a stable dose 30 days before Day  1.  Concomitant medications will be 
used at the discretion of the usual care provider (or Investigator if also the usual care provider).  
Relevant information about all concomitant medications taken before (ie, within 12 months of 
Day 1; Table 3) and during the study must be recorded in the source documents and e CRF, as 
well as any dose or dose regimen changes that occur during the study. 
Subjects taking BAS (including cholestyramine and its derivatives, colestipol, colesevelam, or 
other sequestr ants) or aluminum hydroxide- or smectite -containing antacids should be instructed 
to stagger their dosing of investigational product, ensuring at least 4 hours between doses of the 
BAS and/or antacids and the investigational product (ie, BAS should be admi nistered [ADDRESS_755623] administration).  
Taken concomitantly, OCA and warfarin may decrease INR, thus INR should be monitored and the dosage of warfarin adjusted, as needed, to maintain the target INR range.  
The effect of OCA on drug metabolizing enzymes has been evaluated in both in vitro and clinical 
studies.  The PK profile of caffeine, a sensitive CYP1A2 substrate, showed weak effect of OCA on CYP1A2.  Based on these results, OCA may increase the exposure of narrow therapeutic 
index drugs that are substrates for CYP1A2, such as theophylline and tizanidine. 
9.3. Treatment Compliance  
The Investigator should assess the subject’s compliance with dosing of investigational product 
and open-label atorvastatin on an ongoing basis throughout the study and confirm by [CONTACT_22088] (ie, count of returned tablets) during subjects’ onsite visits.  
Subjects should be instructed to retain all bottles of investigational product and atorvastatin , even 
if empty, and to return them to the Investigator at the subsequent visit (refer to Table 1 and Table 2).  The Investigator or designee should perform drug accountability and, if applicable, 
follow up with the subject to retrieve any investigational product and atorvastatin  bottles that 
have not been returned.  
If the Investigator has concerns about a subject’s dosing compliance s/he should discuss this with 
the subject, assess the reasons for noncompliance and the likelihood that the subject will remain 
noncompliant, and notify the Sponsor accordingly.  Continued study eligibility should be assessed based on the subject’s compliance with investigational product and atorvastatin  dosing 
and clinic visits.  
9.4. Randomization and Blinding  
The initial phase of the study will be conducted in a double-blind, placebo -controlled manner.  
Enrolled subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 4 treatment groups (OCA 5 mg, 
OCA 10 mg, OCA 25  mg, or placebo) based on a predefined randomization code (generated by 
[CONTACT_35886]) using an IWRS.  The IW RS will serve as the investigational product 
inventory and management system and may be integrated with the study database.  
Page 60 of 364
Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  [ADDRESS_755624] (OCA or 
placebo) dispensing information will be provided (eg, bottle numbers allocated) while 
maintaining the study blind.  The subjects, Investigator, and study site staff will be blinded to the 
subjects’ treatment allocation in the double-blind phase of the study until all subjects have 
completed the double-blind phase of the study and the database is locked. 
In the LTSE phase, all subjects will be treated with open -label OCA 10 mg or OCA 25 mg: 
subjects randomized to placebo or OCA 5 mg during the double-blind phase will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_755625] treatment response are ran domized in 
equal proportions to the different treatment groups, subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_575797] (Screening Visit 2 LDL cholesterol value for statin washout subjects or Screening LDL cholesterol value for statin -free subjects).  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_195226]-randomization fasted serum LDL cholesterol concentration (≤125 mg/dl or >125 mg/dL) and 
baseline fibrosis stage (stage 1,  2 or stage 3, 4). 
9.4.2. Emergency Unblinding Procedures  
Randomization codes and corresponding t reatment assignment s will be made available to the 
Investigator and the Medical Monitor for emergency use only through the IWRS system.  When possible, the Medical Monitor should be consulted in the event that a medical emergency necessitates unblinding (ie, in situations where knowledge of the blinded treatment is necessary 
for further medical management of the subject).  If it is not reasonable to inform the Medical 
Monitor in advance of unblinding, the Investigator must promptly document the case in the 
subject’s source record.  Subsequently, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_575798] ( eg, accidental unblinding or 
unblinding due to a serious AE  [SAE]).  Procedures for unblinding a subjec t’s treatment will be 
provided separately to the Investigator.  The  Medical Monitor will document within study 
correspondence the rationale, circumstances, and the person (s) being informed about the 
unblinding.   
The DMC  (refer to Section 13.8) will have access to the IWRS and will be able to unblind 
individual subjects.  The DMC will review aggregate data during closed sessions.  The DMC 
will document details about any subject who was unblinded in the closed session DMC minutes, 
which will be made available to the Sponsor only after the double-blind database is locked and 
unblinded.  
Access to randomization  codes and corresponding treatment assignments will also be made 
available through the IWRS system to the appropriate, named individual(s) responsible for 
reporting SAEs and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to the regulatory 
authorities.

and all subsequent study visits , as all analytes will be assayed in fast ing blood, serum, or plasma 
samples (Table 1 and Table  2).  Water is permitted during the fasting period.  
If the subject reports having eaten within [ADDRESS_755627] 8 -hour fasting 
is required prior to all study visits, but water is permitted.  The blood sample will still be 
collected during the visit with the exception of Screening Visit 2, which will require rescheduling of the visit. 
9.6.2. Grapefruit and Grapefruit Juice  
Grapefruit and grapefruit juice consumption should be discouraged following initiation of 
atorvastatin  due to possible increases in plasma concentration of atorvastatin (please refer to 
atorvastatin prescribing information [ Appendix E ]). 
9.6.3. Diet and Exercise  
Consistent with the exclusion criteria ( Section 8.3), subjects should not make significant changes 
to their diet and exercise habits during the double-blind phase.  This is not intended to override physician advice for lifestyle modification , and inclusion in the study should preferably be after 
lifestyle modifications have been made and are stable.  
9.7. Visit Procedures 
9.7.1. Visit Windows  
All Screening assessments should occur ≤35 days prior to the Randomization/ Day 1 Visit.  
Subjects who are taking statins at the time of screening or within 30 days of Screening Visit 1 are 
required to stop statin therapy for 4  weeks (28 (±1) days) , and provide a fasting blood sample at 
Screening Visit  [ADDRESS_755628] not taken statins within 30 days of 
Screening Visit  1 are not required to enter into the washout period and m ay proceed to Screening

11.3. Anthropometric Assessments  
Anthropometric measures include height (measured at Screening Visit 1 only), weight, and waist 
and hip circumference measurements.  Waist -to-hip ratio will be calculated by [CONTACT_575804] (EDC) system and will be calculated as ( [Waist Circumference in Centimeters ] / [Hip 
Circumfere nce in Centimeters ]).  Height will also be collected at Screening  Visit 1.  
Anthropometric measures will be performed during the visits indicated in  Table 1 and Table 2.  
11.3.1. BMI 
BMI will be calculated as (Weight in Kilograms / [Height in Meters × Height in Meters ]).   
Instructions for measuring body weight and waist and hip circumference are described below.  All three measures are to be obtained after the subject has fasted for at least [ADDRESS_755668] decimal point (eg, 97.1 kg) by [CONTACT_464].  
11.3.3. Waist and Hip C ircumference:   
The subject should be wearing little clothing and standing upright during the measurements, with 
arms relaxed at the side, feet close together , and body weight evenly distribut ed.  Waist 
circumference should be measured at the end of several consecutive natural breaths, midpoint 
between the top of the iliac crest and the lower margin of the last palpable rib in the mid -axillary 
line.  Hip circumference should be measured at the largest circumference of the buttocks.  Both measurements should be made with a Sponsor-provided measuring tape that is wrapped snugly around the subject, but not to the point that the tape is constricting.  The tape must be level and 
parallel to the floor  at the point of measurement.  Each measurement should be repeated twice; if

Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  19 Dec 2016   
Page 89 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  the measurements are within 1 cm of one another, the average should be calculated.  If the 
difference between the 2 measurements exceeds 1 cm, the 2 measurements should be repeated.  
12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
Safety will be monitored and assessed by [CONTACT_2695]/SAEs, medical history, physical examination, 
vital signs measurements, ECG results, and clinical laboratory assessments.  Refer to Section 17.1 for AE reporting procedures.  
12.1. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
12.1.1. Definition s 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of the investigational product in humans, whether or not considered related to investigational product.  
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with any use of the investigational product, without 
any judgment about causality and irrespective of route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  For this study, investigational product refers to OCA or placebo, and 
study medication refers to  atorvastatin.  
AEs inclu de, but are not limited to: (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, or frequency of 
condition(s) present at the start of the study; (2) subject deterioration due to primary illness; (3) intercurrent illness; and (4)  drug interaction. 
Subjects should be questioned in a general way, without leading the subject or asking about the 
occurrence of any specific symptom.  The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of 
the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  The diagnosis and not the 
individual signs/symptoms should be documented as the AE.  For example, if the underlying disease process is a stroke, it would not be appropriate to record the AE by [CONTACT_22103] “sudden numbness, dizziness, and difficulty s peaking.”  The AE medical term of 
“stroke or cerebrovascular accident” should be recorded as it more accurately describes the AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Treatment -Emergent Adverse Event  
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is any event not present before the initiation of the 
investigational product or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency 
following exposure to the investigational product. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event  
An AE is considered ‘serious’ if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor , it results in 
any of the following outcomes: 
• Death 
• Is immediately life threatening  
Page 89 of 364
Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  19 Dec 2016   
Page 90 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  • Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]: 
• Routine monitoring of the studied indication and not associated with any deterioration in condition or AE ; 
• Elective treatment for a pre-existing condition that did not worsen; 
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_22017].  
12.1.2. Relationship to Investigational Product or Study Medication 
The Investigator will document her/his opi[INVESTIGATOR_575565]  (atorvastatin ) using the criteria outlined in  Table 6.  
Each AE will be assessed for relationship to investigational product and atorvastatin independently.  An AE for which there is a “reasonable possibility” that either investigational 
product or atorvastatin caused the AE is otherwise referred to as a suspected adverse reactions 
(SARs).  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the investigational product and/or atorvastatin and the AE.   
If the relationship between a SAE and the investigational product is determined to be “ definite,” 
“probable,” or “possible ,” the event will be considered to be related to the investigational product 
for the purpose of assessing expedited regulatory reporting. 
If the relationship between an SAE and the atorvastatin is determined to be “definite,” 
“probable,” or “possible,” the event will be considered to be related to atorvastatin for the 
purpose of assessing expedited safety  reporting and reporting to the manufacturer.

12.1.4. Recording Adverse Event Severity  
AEs must be graded for severity (ie, intensity) using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCE) Version 4.03 ( Appendix C ).  A severity category of mild, moderate, severe, 
life-threatening, or death as defined in Table 8, must be entered on the AE eCRF.  It should be 
noted that the term “severe” used to grade intensity is not synonymous with the term “serious.”  The assessment of severity is made regardless o f investigational product relationship or of the 
seriousness of the AE.  When reporting AEs, reference should be made to the CTCAE manual 
for guidance on appropriate grading.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity of Pruritus (as an AE)  
Pruritus was the most common AE seen in the Phase  2 PBC studies of OCA and thus may occur 
in this study.  
To ensure consistency in reporting, the following guidelines for assessing severity of pruritus 
should be used for AE reporting.  As pruritus is a subjective symptom, clinical judgment should 
be used to determine its severity and management (Table 9).  
Table 9: Severity of Pruritus  
Pruritus Grade  Clinical Description of Severity for Pruritus and Medical Intervention  
1 = Mild Generally localized; causing no limitation of usual activities or minimal sleep disturbance; 
the subject may experience slight discomfort.   
Medicinal intervention is not indicated.  
2 = Moderate  Intense or widespread; causing some limitation of usual acti vities or sleep disturbance; the 
subject may experience annoying discomfort.   
Medicinal intervention may be indicated.  
3 = Severe Intense or widespread and interfering with activities of daily living, ie, causing inability to 
carry out usual activities, or severe sleep disturbance; the subject may experience 
intolerable discomfort.  
Medicinal intervention is typi[INVESTIGATOR_575569].  
Since pruritus is a subjective symptom and the occurrence and magnitude of which are not 
readily measured by [CONTACT_575805], clinical judgment needs to be applied in the management of 
each subject.  Managing OCA -related pruritus may help improve tolerance in those subjects who 
experience problematic pruritus and may otherwise discontinue from the study prematurely.  
General guidance for the management of subjects experiencing significant pruritus includes:

Confidential and Proprietary  • Drug holiday:  A drug holiday is defined as an Investigator ‘prescribed’ complete 
interruption of dosing for 1 or more consecutive days (ie, non-daily dosing does not 
constitute  a drug holiday).  Details of drug holidays and/or nondaily dosing regimens 
should be recorded in the CRF.   Per Section [IP_ADDRESS], subjects with pruritus ≥Grade [ADDRESS_755669].     
• Prescribe BAS.  Subjects taking BAS (including colestyramine and its derivatives, 
colestipol, colesevelam, or other sequestrants) should be instructed to stagger their 
dosing of investigational product, ensuring at least [ADDRESS_755670].   
• Other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_22023].  
• Less frequent dosing of investigational product (eg, on alternate days) may be tried, 
after which subjects may return to their original daily dose as soon as tolerated.   
12.1.5. Reporting of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting of Adverse Events  
AE data will be collected from the time that signed informed consent is obtained until the subject 
fully completes her/his study participation.  
All AEs, whether believed by [CONTACT_575806], must be documented in the subject’s medical records, in accordance with the 
Investigator’s normal clinical practice and  in the eCRF in the EDC system .  Each AE is to be 
evaluated for duration, intensity, frequency, seriousness, outcome, other actions taken, and 
relationship to the investigational product or study medication . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
In agreeing to the provisions of this protocol, the Investigator accepts all legal responsibilities for 
immediate reporting of SAEs to the Sponsor.  Immediate  reporting implies within [ADDRESS_755671] be reported to the Sponsor .  SAEs are reported by [CONTACT_22104].  Entering the SAE data into the EDC system will automatically 
notify the Sponsor of the event.  In the event that the EDC system is inaccessible, an SAE may be reported by: 
• E-mail to the SAE email address:  [EMAIL_380]  
• Fax using a paper SAE report form:  +[PHONE_352] 
• Telephone:  +[PHONE_11933]  
If an SAE is reported by [CONTACT_12221], an SAE Report form must also be completed in the EDC system as soon as the EDC system is accessible.  At a minimum, the following information should be provided at the time of the initial report:

Confidential and Proprietary  • Subject numbe r  
• Event term  
• At least 1 criterion classifying the event as serious  
• Name [CONTACT_22168]  
• Causal relationship to the investigational product or study medication  
The Investigator will assess whether the event is causally related to t he investigational product or 
study medication .  The Sponsor will also assess whether the event is causally related to the 
investigational product, in addition to assessing the overall safety profile of the investigational 
product.  The Sponsor will notify the appropriate regulatory agencies as well as all participating 
Investigators of investigational new drug (IND) Safety Reports/Expedited Safety Reports  that 
occur during the study within the time frames required by [CONTACT_22105].  
Following the initial report, any additional information obtained by [CONTACT_575807].  Any supporting source documentation should be faxed to +[PHONE_352] or emailed to [EMAIL_380] as soon as possible.  
The Investigator is responsible for submitting information on IND S afety Reports/Expedited 
Safety Reports received from the Sponsor to her/ his local IRB/IEC , as directed by [CONTACT_575808] . 
Documentation of the submissions to IRBs/IECs must be retained in the appropriate study file(s).  As instructed by [CONTACT_1034], IND Safety Reports/Expedited Safety Reports should be retained 
in the appropriate investigative site study files , or with the IB.  
12.1.6. Additional Investigator Responsibilities for SAEs 
The safety data recorded in the EDC represent the official record of all AEs and SAEs reported 
in the study.  The Investigator should comply with requests by [CONTACT_575809]’s AE eCRF in the EDC.  Other supporting 
documents such as radiology reports, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], and autopsy reports should also be provided, when appropriate.  Additionally, upon request by [CONTACT_1034], the Investigator should provide input into the SAE narrative and provide timely information to ensure prompt 
follow-up and closure of the SAE report. 
The Investigator and supporting personnel responsible for subject care should discuss with the 
Medical Monitor any need for supplemental investigations of SAEs.  The results of these 
additional assessments must be reported to the Medical Monitor.   
12.1.7. Notification of Post- Study SAEs  
If an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE that may be attributable to the investigational 
product at any time after the end of the study, the Sponsor should be notified immediately 
(ie, within 24 hours). 
Page 94 of 364
Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  [ADDRESS_755672] be reported to the Sponsor within 
24 hours by [CONTACT_575810]  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
12.1.8. Follow-Up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs must be followed during the course of the study until the AE resolves, is no longer of clinical concern, has stabilized or is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. 
AEs ongoing at the final visit that are deemed to be “possibly, probably, or definitely” related or 
of other clinical significance must be followed for as long as necessary to adequately evaluate 
the safety of the subject or until the event stabilizes, resolves, or is no longer of clinical concern.  
If resolved, a resolution date for the AE should be documented in the EDC.  The Investigator 
must ensure that follow-up includes any supplemental investigations indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE.  This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, 
or consultation with other healthcare professionals, as considered clinically appropriate by [CONTACT_737]. 
All subjects sh owing possible drug-induced liver injury should be followed until all 
abnormalities return to normal or to the baseline state.  Drug-induced liver injury may develop or 
progress even after the causative drug has been stopped.  Results should be recorded in the CRF.  
Note that longer follow- up can sometimes reveal an off -drug repetition of what had appeared to 
be drug-induced liver injury, indicating that liver injury was related to underlying liver disease. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy and Follow- Up  
Pregnancies are not consi dered AEs in and of themselves; however, if a female study participant 
becomes pregnant while she is enrolled in the clinical study, she must discontinue treatment with 
investigational product and atorvastatin immediately (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and the Sponsor must 
be notified within 24 hours of the Investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy by [CONTACT_575811].  The Pregnancy Report Form must be emailed to [EMAIL_380]  or faxed to 
+[PHONE_11934].  The subject and neonate must be followed for outcome information and/or as 
considered appropriate by [CONTACT_2725]. 
Women who discontinue the study due to pregnancy may not re-enroll in the study at any point, 
but should continue with the study visit schedule and must be followed by [CONTACT_575812].  Similarly, if a subject’s pregnancy is terminated early (planned or 
unplanned), the subject will also be removed from the study. 
Completing the Pregnancy Report Form is not a substitute for reporting an AE/SAE if an 
AE/SAE has occurred  related to or concurrent  with the pregnancy.  In the situation when an 
AE/SAE has occurred, the AE/SAE reporting procedures described in Section  17.[ADDRESS_755673] also be 
followed.

body temperature, sitting heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697].   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Electrocardiograms   
The ECG data analysis will b e conducted based on methodology recommended in the 
International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH) E14 guideline, The Clinical Evaluation of 
QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Nonantiarrhythmic Drugs.   
Baseline is defined as the  mean of all available evaluations prior to treatment.  Descriptive 
statistics of ECG parameters (time between 2 consecutive R waves [RR], PR, QRS, QT, and QT 
interval corrected by [CONTACT_6550]’s formula [QTcF]) at baseline and at each post -baseline timepoint 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]; absolute changes from baseline will also be 
summarized.   
A categorical summary of abnormal QTcF values will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  The 
number of patients with values of >450 msec, >480 msec, and >500 msec will be presented, and the number of patients with change from baseline values of >30 msec and >60 msec will also be 
presented.   
Overall interpretatio n results for ECGs and the I nvestigator interpretation results are collected as 
normal, abnormal not clinically significant, and abnormal clinically significant.  Subjects whose 
interpretation shifts from normal to abnormal will be listed separately including description of 
the abnormality and any associated comments.  
13.7.5. Adjudicated Cardiovascular Events 
Adjudicated cardiovascular events include core major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE; 
cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke) and expanded MACE (unstable angina requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], transient ischemic attack, peripheral or coronary revascularization procedures, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_126042]).  Othe r events 
potentially related to adverse cardiovascular outcomes are defined in Appendix D  and will be 
included in the Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee  (CAC) Charter for adjudication .  
Undetermined cause of death will be classified as a cardiovascular death by [CONTACT_575826]. 
Summaries of adjudicated cardiovascular events will include the incidence of TEAEs and the 
incidence of serious TEAEs.  All summaries of incidence will include the associated exact binomial 95% CI.  
13.8. Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent DMC that includes hepat ologists, pharmaceutical physicians, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_623]/cardiology expert(s), and statistician(s) not involved in the study as Investigators, or consultants.  The DMC will have oversight over the study conduct as defined by [CONTACT_575827].  All members will hav e considerable experience with clinical study conduct and DMCs.  
Any candidate found to have a conflict of interest or whose name [CONTACT_576375] 105 of 364
Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  [ADDRESS_755685] treatment information; 
however, the DMC will have access to the database and may unblind individual subject data as 
appropriate.  Summary tables reviewed by [CONTACT_575828], ie, the actual treatment groups are used, but are not identified.  Data reviewed 
during the meetings will include, at a minimum, disposition, demographics, exposure, clinical 
laboratory results, MedDRA coded AEs, and AEs leading to early withdrawal of investigational product.  At each meeting, detailed narratives of interval SAEs (including events resulting in 
death) are reviewed by [CONTACT_277842] a cumulative list of all SAEs.  
The DMC may agree to adjust meeting frequency based upon actual and projected safety and 
efficacy data availability.  
All Investigators and responsible IRBs/IECs will be informed of any decisions made by [CONTACT_575829].  The Investigators will inform the subjects of such actions and the 
protocol, patient information sheet, and ICF will be revised, as appropriate. 
13.9. Adjudication Committees  
All suspected MACE, and drug-related hepatic injury events that occur after administration of 
the first dose of investigational product will be reviewed by [CONTACT_575830], depending on event type, before inclusion in any anal ysis.  The 2 committees and 
event types they are responsible for adjudicating are as follows: 
• Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee (C AC):  Adjudicates all suspected MACE  
(Appendix D ), including all deaths 
• Hepatic Safety Committee:  Adjudicates all suspected drug -related hepatic injury events  
Each adjudication committee will have a charter that documents the reporting of events by [CONTACT_3452] ; definition of the suspected events to be adjudicated; supply of source documentation 
to the committee ; and the entire data flow and process from committee membership, review of 
the events by [CONTACT_942], reporting of the final assessment, and the working procedures of the committee.   
The adjudication committee members will include experts with relevant adjudication experience; they will not be involved in the study as Investigators, DMC members, or consultants.  Any candidate found to have a conflict or whos e name [CONTACT_576376] 106 of 364
Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  [ADDRESS_755686] they will be replaced.  
The adjudication of suspected events will be based on available source documentation, including 
but not limited to individual clinical study data, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], histology, discharge summaries, 
and/or death certificates.  The adjudication committees will not receive any individual subject 
treatment or site -specific information.  The assessment of events will be conducted in 
compliance with study -specific procedures, manuals, GCP, and all other applicable regulatory 
requirements, including the archiving of essential documents.    
14. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
14.1. Study Monitoring  
Study records at each site will be monitored at regular intervals by a representative of the Sponsor, the CRA.  The role of the CRA is to aid the Investigator in the maintenance and documentation of complete, accurate, legibl e, well organized and easily retrievable data.  In 
addition, the CRA will ensure the Investigator's understanding of all applicable regulations concerning the clinical evaluation of the investigational product and will ensure an understanding of the protocol, reporting responsibilities and the validity of the data.  This will include ensuring 
that full and appropriate essential documentation is available. 
In order to perform this role, the CRA must perform source data verification and as such, must 
be given access to the subject’s primary source documentation (eg, paper or electronic medical 
records such as consent to participate in the study, visit dates, screening and randomization numbers, demographic information, medical history, disease history, physica l examination, vital 
signs, laboratory assessments [copy of laboratory reports], AEs, concomitant medications, dates 
of dispensing investigational product, ECGs, etc) that support data entries in the eCRF.  The 
eCRF must be completed promptly after each visit to allow the progress and results of the study 
to be closely followed by [CONTACT_1689]. 
The Investigator may exercise judgment in allowing the CRA access to particular sections of the 
subject's medical records if these are deemed irrelevant to the performance, observations or 
conduct of this study. 
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
The Investigator should understand that it may be necessary for the Sponsor, the IRB /IEC and/or 
a regulatory agency to conduct one or more site audits during or after the study and agrees to allow access to all study -related documentation and information and be available for discussion 
about the study.   
15. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Logic and consistency checks will be performed on all data entered into the e CRF or ultimately 
transferred into the database to ensure accuracy and completeness.   
Training sessions, regular monitoring of the study at the study site by [CONTACT_22121] (eg, CRA), instruction manuals, data verification, cross-checking and dat a audits will 
Page 107 of 364
Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  19 Dec 2016   
Page 108 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  be performed to ensure quality of all study data.  Investigators’ meetings and/or onsite study 
initiations will be performed to prepare Investigators and other study site personnel for 
appropriate collection of study data. 
To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, the Sponsor may 
conduct a quality assurance audit.  
16. ETHICS 
16.1. Ethics Review  
The final study protocol, including the final version of the ICF and/or other subject information, 
must be approved or given a favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_3952] /IEC as appropriate.  The 
Investigator must submit written IRB/IEC approval to the Sponsor before he or she can enroll 
any subject into the study.  The Investigator is responsible for providing the IB and any other 
available safety information and information about payments and compensation available to 
study subjects to the ethics committee for review.  
The Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/IEC of any amendment to the protocol in accordance with local requ irements.  A favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_575570], unless the amendment is necessary to reduce immediate risk to 
study participants.  In addition, the IRB/IEC must approve all advertising used to recruit subj ects 
for the study.  The protocol must be reapproved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC upon receipt of amendments and 
annually, as local regulations require. 
The Investigator is also responsible for providing the IRB/IEC with reports of any reportable 
serious adverse drug reactions from any other study conducted with the investigational product.  The Sponsor will provide this information to the Investigator. 
Progress reports and notifications of SARs will be provided to the IRB/IEC according to local 
regulations and guidelines.  Investigators or the Sponsor or its designee will provide reports to the IRB/IEC as requested, as a minimum annually, and after the study is complete.  
16.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that h ave their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/GCP, applicable regulatory requirements, and the Sponsor’s policies. 
16.3. Written Informed Consent  
The Investigator(s) at each center will ensure that the subject is given full and adequate oral and 
written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study.  Subjects 
must also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time.  The subject should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information 
provided. 
The subject’s signed and dated ICF must be obtained before conducting any study procedures. 
Page 108 of 364
Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  19 Dec 2016   
Page 109 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  The Investigator(s) must maintain the original, signed ICF.  A copy of the ICF must be given to 
the subject. 
16.4. Subject Confidentiality and Data Protection  
All information obtained during the conduct of the study with respect to the subject will be 
regarded as confidential and confidentiality of all subjects will be maintained.  Monitors (eg, CRA, Medical Monitor), auditors and inspectors will require access to a subject’s medical notes 
for the purpose of source document verification but the subject’s confidentiality will be 
maintained at all times.  An agreement for disclosure of any such information will be ob tained in 
writing and is included in the statement of informed consent.  The study data shall not be 
disclosed to a third party (with the exception of auditors and/or regulatory authorities) without 
the written consent of the Sponsor.  All reports and comm unications relating to subjects in this 
study that are disclosed to an authorized third party will identify subjects only by [CONTACT_575831] a secure manner.  All data shall be secured against 
unauthorized access. 
The Investigator will maintain a list of subject names and identifying information (eg, subjects’ 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42871], unique subject numbers).  This list will not be collected by [CONTACT_1034]. The written information sheet will explain that study data will be stored  in a computer database, 
maintaining confidentiality in accordance with national data protection legislation.  All data 
computer processed by [CONTACT_575832]/randomization code/site number, only.   
When personal subject data are stored or processed by [CONTACT_22123], the data must be protected to 
prevent their disclosure to unauthorized third parties.  The pertinent sections of the data 
protection laws in which the country is being conducted will be complied with in full. 
The written information sheet and ICF will explain that, for data verification purposes, 
authorized representatives of the Sponsor, a regulatory authority, or an IRB/IEC may require 
direct access to parts of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_575571], including subject medical history.  
17. INVESTIGATOR OBLIGAT IONS 
The Investigator or a medically trained designee will be responsible for obtaining written 
informed consent and for the care of the subjects for the duration of the study .  If the Investigator 
is not present at the study site during the assessment, he or she will leave instructions for the 
study site staff and a telephone number where he or she can be reached.  
Named physician(s) will be responsible for the medical follow -up of subjects, as applicable. 
17.1. AE Reporting 
The Investigator is responsible for recording AEs reported by [CONTACT_575833].  In agreeing to the provisions of this protocol, the Investigator 
accepts all legal responsib ilities for immediate reporting of SAEs to the Sponsor. 
Page 109 of 364
Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  [ADDRESS_755687] without 
proper notification to the Sponsor (or designee).  Only the Sponsor may amend the protocol.  
Any change in study conduct considered necessary by [CONTACT_22125], who will then issue a formal protocol amendment to implement 
the change and obtain regulatory approval.  The only exception is when the Investigator 
considers a subject’s safety to be compromised if immediate action is not taken. 
17.3. Regulatory Documentation  
The following regulatory documentation must be completed or provided, and maintained: 
• Approved Patient Information Sheets and ICF (all versions) 
• IRB/IEC approvals (of protocol/amendments, subject questionnaires, etc.) 
• Form FDA 1572  
• Current medical license of Principal Investigator s 
• Curriculum vitae  of Principal Investigator s 
• Laboratory certification and reference ranges  
• Financial disclosure forms 
17.4. Ethics Review  
Please see Section 16.1 for the I nvestigator’s responsibilities regarding ethics review.  
17.5. Archiving and Record Retention  
The Investigator should retain all correspondence relating to this study in the Investigator Site 
File (ISF).  Any study documents stored elsewhere should have their location referenced in the ISF. 
All documents relating to the study inclu ding the ISF itself, source documents and subject 
medical files, completed study subject log and confidential subject identification list will be retained by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator in accordance with regulations.  US Federal regulations require that 
records of d rug disposition, eCRFs, source documents, and all reports of this investig ation shall 
be retained by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator for a minimum of [ADDRESS_755688] been notified of the study's termination, or [ADDRESS_755689] be notified of the individual who will be 
assuming this responsibility.  In the e vent that storage of records becomes a problem at any time 
during this period, the Sponsor should be consulted for assistance.  At the end of the minimum 
period, the Investigator should obtain written authorization from the Sponsor prior to the 
destruction of any records.  The I nvestigator will notify the Sponsor if ownership of documents 
or responsibility for the study site is transfe rred.  The Sponsor will inform Investigators should it 
become aware of any changes in storage requirements.

Confidential and Proprietary  18. PUBLICATION POLI CY 
The Sponsor intends to publish the results of all of the clinical studies that it Sponsors consistent 
with the Declaration of Helsinki ( 64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, 
October 2013).  Consistent with the recommendations of the editors of s everal leading medical 
journals, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), authorship of publications resulting from Intercept sponsored studies should fairly recognize the activities of 
those that have made a significant contribution to the study (http://www.icmje.org).  Thus, it is 
anticipated that authorship will reflect the contribution made by [CONTACT_22127], the Investigators and others involved, such as statisticians. 
In recent years, issues about conflicts of interest and accuracy of the study data have been raised 
in the medical press.  Accordingly, the Sponsor has developed publication guidelines for clinical studies that are appropriate for this study.  Key issues include the following: 
• Clinical Study Registries (eg, clinicaltrials.gov):  A description of the study and 
relevant design elements (eg, basic design, objectives and endpoints, sample size, 
study population, and key inclusion/exclusion criteria) and results (when available) will be published online in a manner consistent with applicable regulatory guidelines. 
• Overview:  Investigators, reviewers , and editors will have the right to audit the data to 
verify its accuracy.  
• Responsibility:  Each Investigator is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of 
all data from her/his site.  The Sponsor (or its representatives) is responsible for the 
accuracy of the data entered into the study databases and the analyses conducted.  
• Data Management:  The Sponsor will establish data management and the SAP.  The 
Investigators will have the opportunity to provide input into the plans.  The 
Investigators will have the right to review the audit reports and data resolution 
decisions before the establishment of a clean file.  The Investigators will have the 
right to appoint appropriately qualified auditors, with GCP experience, to audit the Sponsor’s data before the establishment of a clean file.  The Investigators must 
provide adequate notice (at least 2 months) to the Sponsor of their intention to audit a 
study.  The audit should be conducted in a timely manner to allow the resolution of discrepancies before a clean file is established.  The Investigators will bear all the 
costs for the conduct of audits that they initiate, except those related to the resolution 
of data queries which the Sponsor will bear.  Such audits must be conducted in such a manner as to minimize the time to create the clean file.  
• Authorship:  The Sponsor, in collaboration with the Investigators, will establish the 
appropriate authorship and responsibility for drafting study documents in accordance 
with the principles of the ICMJE.  All manuscripts will be reviewed and agreed upon before submission for publication by [CONTACT_15064]. 
• Single Center Publication and Additional Publications:  This is a multicenter study  
and is designed to be published with complete data from all the study sites.  Single 
center publications are therefore not considered appropriate.  Any such publications 
should clearly state that the data are “extracted” from a multicenter study and that the 
Page 111 of 364
Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  19 Dec 2016   
Page 112 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  study was not intended, or statistically powered, for data presentation by a single 
study site.  
• Intercept Review of External Manuscripts:  Consistent with this, Investigators must submit any drafts of any publications or presentations that may arise from this study 
to the Sponsor for review and approval and to ensure consistency with the policy in this protocol at least [ADDRESS_755690] facts and to 
represent its, or the Publication Committee’s, opi[INVESTIGATOR_575572]. 
• Confidentiality:  Investigators will conduct all interactions with the company and 
with third parties consistent with the executed confidentiality agreements.  While 
publication, by [CONTACT_7586], presents the critical scientific data in a public forum, some information (such as future plans, results of preclinical studies, or chemical formulae) 
may still need to remain confidential.  
• Medical Jo urnal Review:  Upon request, all pertinent study data and information will 
be made available as supplemental information for journal editors and reviewers to 
evaluate and audit  (eg, protocol and amendments, data tabulations, etc).  
Arrangements will be mad e to maintain the confidentiality of such supplemental 
information.  Arrangements will also be made to maintain the confidentiality of the identity of journal reviewers.  Records will be maintained of which documents and datasets were reviewed .

Preamble and Transition to ACC/AHA
Guidelines to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk
The goals of the American College of Cardiology (ACC)
and the American Heart Association (AHA) are to prevent
cardiovascular diseases; improve the management of peoplewho have these diseases through professional educationand research; and develop guidelines, standards, and pol-icies that promote optimal patient care and cardiovascular
health. Toward these objectives, the ACC and AHA have
collaborated with the National Heart, Lung, and BloodInstitute (NHLBI) and stakeholder and professional or-ganizations to develop clinical practice guidelines forassessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle modi ﬁcations to
reduce cardiovascular risk, management of blood choles-terol in adults, and management of overweight and obesityin adults.
In 2008, the NHLBI initiated these guidelines by
[CONTACT_575842]-tions (CQs), interpret the evidence, and craft recommen-dations. In response to the 2011 report from the Instituteof Medicine on the development of trustworthy clinicalguidelines (1), the NHLBI Advisory Council recom-mended that the NHLBI focus speci ﬁcally on reviewing
the highest-quality evidence and partner with other orga-nizations to develop recommendations (2,3). Accordingly,in June [ADDRESS_755699] possible constituency.Recognizing that the Expert Panels/Work Groups did notStone et al. JACC Vol. 63, No. 25, 2014

consider evidence beyond 2011 (except as speci ﬁed in the
methodology), the ACC, AHA, and collaborating societies
plan to begin updating these guidelines starting in 2014.
The joint ACC/AHA Task Force on Practice Guide-
lines (Task Force) appointed a subcommittee to shepherdthis transition, communicate the rationale and expectationsto the writing panels and partnering organizations, andexpeditiously publish the documents. The ACC/AHA andpartner organizations recruited a limited number of expert
reviewers for ﬁduciary examination of content, recognizing
that each document had undergone extensive peer review
by [CONTACT_575843], keyfederal agencies, and scienti ﬁc experts. Each writing panel
responded to comments from these reviewers. Clari ﬁca-
tions were incorporated where appropriate, but there wereno substantive changes because the bulk of the content wasundisputed.
Although the Task Force led the ﬁnal development of
these prevention guidelines, they differ from other ACC/AHA guidelines. First, as opposed to an extensive com-pendium of clinical information, these documents aresigniﬁcantly more limited in scope and focus on selected
CQs on each topic, based on the highest-quality evidenceavailable. Recommendations were derived from randomizedtrials, meta-analyses, and observational studies evaluated for
quality and were not formulated when suf ﬁcient evidence
was not available. Second, the text accompanying each
recommendation is succinct, summarizing the evidence foreach question. The Full Panel/Work Group Reports includemore detailed information about the evidence statementsthat serve as the basis for recommendations. Third, theformat of the recommendations differs from other ACC/AHA guidelines. Each recommendation has been mapped
from the NHLBI grading format to the ACC/AHA Clas-
siﬁcation of Recommendation/Level of Evidence (COR/
LOE) construct ( Table 1 ) and is expressed in both formats.
Because of the inherent differences in grading systems andthe clinical questions driving the recommendations, align-ment between the NHLBI and ACC/AHA formats is insome cases imperfect. Explanations of these variations arenoted in the recommendation tables, where applicable.
In consultation with NHLBI, the policies adopted by
[CONTACT_575844] (RWI) are outlined in themethods section of each panel report. These policies werein effect when this effort began in 2008 and throughoutthe writing process and voting on recommendations, untilthe process was transferred to ACC/AHA in 2013. In theinterest of transparency, the ACC/AHA requested that
panel authors resubmit RWI disclosures as of July 2013.
Relationships relevant to this guideline are disclosed inAppendix 1 . None of the ACC/AHA expert reviewers had
relevant RWI ( Appendix 2 ). See Appendix [ADDRESS_755700] of
abbreviations used in the guideline.
Systematic evidence reports and accompanying sum-
mary tables were developed by [CONTACT_575845]. The guideline was reviewed by [CONTACT_197006]/
AHA Task Force and approved by [CONTACT_575846], and the AHA Science Advisory and Coor-dinating Committee. In addition, ACC/AHA soughtendorsement from other stakeholders, including profes-sional organizations. It is the hope of the writing panels,stakeholders, professional organizations, NHLBI, andTask Force that the guidelines will garner the widestpossible readership for the bene ﬁt of patients, providers,
and the public health.
These guidelines are meant to deﬁ ne practices that
meet the needs of patients in most circumstances andare not a replacement for clinical judgment. The ulti-mate decision about care of a particular patient must bemade by [CONTACT_575847]. As a result,situations might arise in which deviations from these
guidelines may be appropriate. These considerations
notwithstanding, in caring for most patients, clinicianscan employ the recommendations con ﬁdently to reduce
the risks of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease(ASCVD) events.
SeeTables 1a and1bfor an explanation of the NHLBI
recommendation grading methodology.
1. Introduction
1.1. Organization of the Panel
The Blood Cholesterol Expert Panel (Expert Panel) was
originally convened as the Expert Panel on Detection,Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterolin Adults (Adult Treatment Panel IV) appointed by[CONTACT_15792]. The Expert Panel was composed of 13members and [ADDRESS_755701] information to the full panel in
advance of the deliberations; members with con ﬂicts were
asked to recuse themselves from voting on any aspectof the guideline for which a con ﬂict might exist. All 16
members of the NHLBI Adult Treatment Panel IV Panel
transitioned to the ACC/AHA guideline Expert Panel.

1.3. Scope of Guideline
This guideline is based on the Full Panel Report, which
is provided as an online-only data supplement to theguideline.

Table 2 provides an overview to facilitate understanding
what is new in the present guideline.
The Expert Panel was charged with using data from
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviewsand meta-analyses of RCTs to update the clinical practicerecommendations for the treatment of blood cholesterollevels to reduce ASCVD risk. For this guideline, ASCVDincludes coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and pe-ripheral arterial disease, all of presumed atheroscleroticorigin. These recommendations are intended to provide aTable 1. Applying Classi ﬁcation of Recommendation and Level of Evidence
A recommendation with Level of Evidence B or C does not imply that the recommendation is weak. Many important clinical questions addressed in the guidelines do not lend themselves to clinical trials.
Even when randomized trials are unavailable, there may be a very clear clinical consensus that a particular test or therapy is useful or effective.

failure, and prior aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34308].yFor comparative-effectiveness recommendations (Class I and IIa; Level of Evidence A and B only), studies that support the use of comparator verbs should involve direct comparisons of the treatments

to bene ﬁtfrom cholesterol-lowering statin therapy, the
recommendations will be of value to primary care cliniciansas well as specialists concerned with ASCVD prevention.Importantly, the recommendations were designed to beeasy to use in the clinical setting, facilitating the imple-mentation of a strategy of risk assessment and treatmentfocused on the prevention of ASCVD. The presentguideline is intended to address treatment of adults ( /C2121
years of age) to complement the NHLBI cardiovascular
health risk-reduction guideline for children and adoles-
cents (4).
The members of the Expert Panel acknowledge the
important contributions arising from decades of geneticand biochemical studies, observational epi[INVESTIGATOR_575578], and in vitro and animal experi-ments that associated higher low-density lipoproteincholesterol (LDL-C) levels with greater ASCVD risk.These studies provided the rationale for RCTs, which inturn demonstrated that lowering cholesterol levels reducedASCVD events and thereby [CONTACT_123817] a central, causalrole of atherogenic cholesterol-containing lipoproteinparticles, particularly LDL, in the genesis of CHD andASCVD.
Other strategies for using drug therapy to reduce
ASCVD events have been advocated, including treat-to-cholesterol target, lowest-is-best, and risk-based treat-ment approaches. However, only 1 approach has beenevaluated in multiple RCTs dthe use of ﬁxed doses of
cholesterol-lowering drugs to reduce ASCVD risk. Becausethe overwhelming body of evidence came from statinTable 1a. NHLBI Grading of the Strength of

patient presenting with possible MI). Those situations should be limited and the rationale

odology team.

RCTs, the Expert Panel appropriately focused on these
statin RCTs to develop evidence-based guidelines for thereduction of ASCVD risk. We recognize that this repre-sents a signi ﬁcant departure from current strategies. This
should not come as a surprise to clinicians. The recent
guideline on heart failure has changed long-standing para-
digms on the basis of the evidence, and this guideline doesas well (5). Future RCTs will be needed to determine the
optimal treatment strategy to provide the greatest reductionin ASCVD events with best margin of safety.
The Expert Panel acknowledges that our process did not
provide for a comprehensive approach to the detection,evaluation, and treatment of lipid disorders as was done in
the prior Adult Treatment Panel III Report (6). However,
the present guideline was never intended to be a compre-hensive approach to lipid management for purposes otherthan ASCVD risk reduction. A limited number of expertopi[INVESTIGATOR_575580] a thorough consider-ation of what the Expert Panel had learned from theRCTs. For the many questions about complex lipid dis-
orders that are beyond the scope of our systematic evidence
review, or for which little or no RCT data are available, itis anticipated that clinicians with lipid expertise cancontribute to their management.
1.4. Methodology and Evidence Review
Although the Expert Panel was convened before the
Institute of Medicine reports on practice guidelines, ourevidence-based process followed most of the standardsfrom the Institute of Medicine report, “Clinical Practice
Guidelines We Can Trust ”(1). The systematic review was
limited to RCTs with ASCVD outcomes and systematic
reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs with ASCVD out-
comes. Observational studies and those with <18 months
(CQ1 and CQ2) or <12 months (CQ3) of follow-up were
excluded. Support was provided by a methodology con-tractor and a systematic review and general support con-tractor and included the following steps:
/C15The Expert Panel constructed CQs relevant toclinical practice.
/C15The Expert Panel identi ﬁed (a priori) inclusion/
exclusion criteria for each CQ.
/C15An independent contractor developed a literature
search strategy, based on inclusion/exclusion criteria,
for each CQ.
/C15An independent contractor executed a systematicelectronic search of the published literature fromrelevant bibliographic databases for each CQ. Thedate range for the overall literature search wasJanuary 1, 1995, through December 1, 2009. How-ever, RCTs with hard ASCVD outcomes of myo-
cardial infarction (MI), stroke, and cardiovascular
death published after that date range were eligiblefor consideration until the Expert Panel began de-liberations on relevant recommendations.
/C15RCTs that met the inclusion criteria and wereindependently graded as fair or good quality wereincluded in the evidence tables for the considerationof the Expert Panel. RCTs that were graded as poor
quality were excluded.
/C15With the assistance of independent methodologists,
this evidence base was used to develop a series ofevidence statements graded on the level of the evi-dence (high, medium, or low).
/C15The Expert Panel then synthesized the evidence state-ments into treatment recommendations/summariesTable 2. What ’s New in the Guideline? *
1 Focus on ASCVD Risk Reduction: 4 Statin Bene ﬁt Groups
1. This guideline is based on a comprehensive set of data from RCTs
from which 4 statin bene ﬁt groups were identi ﬁed that focus efforts
to reduce ASCVD events in secondary and primary prevention.
2. This guideline identi ﬁes high-intensity and moderate-intensity
statin therapy for use in secondary and primary prevention.
2 A New Perspective on LDL-C and/or Non –HDL-C Treatment Goals
1. The Expert Panel was unable to ﬁnd RCT evidence to support
continued use of speci ﬁc LDL-C or non –HDL-C treatment targets.
2. The appropriate intensity of statin therapy should be used to
reduce ASCVD risk in those most likely to bene ﬁt.
3. Nonstatin therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], as compared with statin therapy,
do not provide acceptable ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁts relative
to their potential for adverse effects in the routine prevention
of ASCVD.
[ADDRESS_755703] data, those high-risk groups
that might not bene ﬁt.
4. This guideline recommends a discussion between clinicians
and patients before initiation of statin therapy.
4 Safety Recommendations
1. This guideline used RCTs to identify important safety
considerations in individuals receiving treatment of blood
cholesterol to reduce ASCVD risk.
2. Using RCTs to determine statin adverse effects facilitates
understanding of the net bene ﬁt from statin therapy.
3. This guideline provides expert guidance on management of
statin-associated adverse effects, including muscle symptoms.
5 Role of Biomarkers and Noninvasive Tests
1. Treatment decisions in selected individuals who are not included
in the 4 statin bene ﬁt groups may be informed by [CONTACT_575853].
6 Future Updates to the Blood Cholesterol Guideline
1. This is a comprehensive guideline for the evidence-based treatment
of blood cholesterol to reduce ASCVD risk.
2. Future updates will build on this foundation to provide expert
guidance on the management of complex lipid disorders andincorporate re ﬁnements in risk strati ﬁcation based on critical
review of emerging data.
3. RCTs comparing alternative treatment strategies are needed in
order to inform future evidence-based guidelines for the optimumASCVD risk-reduction approach.

determining ACC/AHA grading of the NHLBI expert-level recommendations.
2. Overview of the Guideline
The RCTs identi ﬁed in the systematic evidence review
indicated a consistent reduction in ASCVD events from3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhib-itor (statin) therapy in secondary- and primary-preventionpopulations, with the exception of no ASCVD eventreduction when statin therapy was initiated in those with
[LOCATION_001] Heart Association class II to IV heart failure or
those receiving maintenance hemodialysis. The RCTseither compared ﬁxed doses of statins with placebo or
untreated controls, or compared ﬁxed doses of higher-
intensity statins with moderate-intensity statins. Thesetrials were not designed to evaluate the effect of titrated(dose-adjusted) statin treatment to achieve prespeci ﬁed
LDL-C or non –HDL-C goals.Therefore, the Expert Panel was unable to ﬁnd RCT
evidence to support titrating cholesterol-lowering drugtherapy to achieve target LDL-C or non –HDL-C levels,
as recommended by [CONTACT_278317] (6 –8).
Notably, the Expert Panel did ﬁnd RCT evidence that use
of therapy (e.g., niacin) to additionally lower non –HDL-C,
once an LDL-C target was achieved, did not furtherreduce ASCVD outcomes (9). The Expert Panel also
found extensive RCT evidence that the appropriate in-
tensity of statin therapy should be used to reduce
ASCVD risk in those most likely to bene ﬁt. The work of
the Expert Panel was informed by [CONTACT_575855] (10) and Risk Assessment Work
Groups (11) (Figure 1 ). A summary of the major rec-
ommendations for the treatment of cholesterol to reduceASCVD risk is provided in Table [ADDRESS_755704] be emphasized that lifestyle modiﬁ cation (i.e.,
adhering to a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise habits,
avoidance of tobacco products, and maintenance of ahealthy weight) remains a crucial component of healthpromotion and ASCVD risk reduction, both prior to and in
concert with the use of cholesterol-lowering drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Healthy diet or lifestyle modiﬁ cations were recommended
as background therapy for the RCTs of cholesterol-lowering drug therapy. See the “2013 AHA/ACC Guide-
line on Lifestyle Management to Reduce CardiovascularRisk ”(10) for lifestyle recommendations for healthy adults.
Drug therapy for lifestyle-related risk factors such as hy-pertension is often needed and smoking should be avoided.

2.2. Initiation of Statin Therapy
The Expert Panel found extensive and consistent evidence
supporting the use of statins for the prevention of ASCVD
in many higher-risk primary- and all secondary-preventionindividuals without [LOCATION_001] Heart Association classII–IV heart failure who were not receiving hemodialysis.
In the RCTs reviewed, initiation of moderate-intensitytherapy (lowering LDL-C by [CONTACT_3450] 30%to<50%) or high-intensity statin therapy (lowering LDL-C
by [CONTACT_3450] /C2150%) is a critical factor in reducing
ASCVD events. Moreover, statin therapy reduces ASCVDevents across the spectrum of baseline LDL-Clevels /C2170 mg/dL. In addition, the relative reduction
in ASCVD risk is consistent for primary and secondaryprevention and for various patient subgroups. Of note,the absolute reduction in ASCVD events is proportionalto baseline absolute ASCVD risk. Therefore, statin
therapy is recommended for individuals at increased
ASCVD risk who are most likely to experience a netbeneﬁt in terms of the potential for ASCVD risk
reduction and the potential for adverse effects ( Table 3;
Figure 2 ).
On the basis of this large and consistent body of evi-
dence, 4 major statin bene ﬁt groups were identi ﬁed for
whom the ASCVD risk reduction clearly outweighs the
risk of adverse events based on a strong body of evidence.
These are 1) secondary prevention in individuals withclinical ASCVD, 2) primary prevention in individuals with
primary elevations of LDL-C /C21190 mg/dL, 3) primary
prevention in individuals with diabetes [ADDRESS_755707] LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL, and 4) primaryprevention in individuals without diabetes and with esti-mated 10-year ASCVD risk /C217.5%, [ADDRESS_755708] LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL. Moderate evidencesupports the use of statins for primary prevention in in-dividuals with 5% to <7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk, 40 to
75 years of age with LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL. Selectedindividuals with <5% 10-year ASCVD risk, or <40 or
>75 years of age may also bene ﬁt from statin therapy.
Clinicians and patients should engage in a discussion of thepotential for ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁts, adverse ef-
fects, drug –drug interactions, and consider patient prefer-
ences for treatment. This discussion also provides theopportunity to re-emphasize healthy-lifestyle habits andaddress other risk factors.
Clinical ASCVD is deﬁ ned by [CONTACT_575857]-prevention statin RCTs (acute coronarys y n d r o m e s ,ah i s t o r yo fM I ,s t a b l eo ru n s t a b l ea n g i n a ,coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, tran-
sient ischemic attack, or peripheral arterial disease pre-
sumed to be of atherosclerotic origin). For primaryprevention in individuals without clinical ASCVD ordiabetes who have an LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL, theestimated absolute 10-year risk of ASCVD (de ﬁned as
nonfatal MI, CHD death, or nonfatal and fatal stroke)should be used to guide the initiation of statin therapy.
The 10-year ASCVD risk should be estimated with the
Pooled Cohort Equations ( Section 4.7 ). For the primary
prevention of ASCVD in individuals with diabetes(diabetes mellitus type 1 an dt y p e2 ) ,e s t i m a t e d1 0 - y e a r
ASCVD risk can also be used to guide the intensity ofstatin therapy. For those with clinical ASCVD or with
LDL-C /C21190 mg/dL who are already in a statin bene ﬁt
group, it is not appropriate to estimate 10-year ASCVD
risk. In primary prevention, additional factors may in-
ﬂuence ASCVD risk in those for whom a risk-based
decision is unclear. These include a primary LDL-C/C21160 mg/dL or other evidence of genetic hyperlip-
idemias, family history of premature ASCVD withonset<[ADDRESS_755709]-degree male relative
or<[ADDRESS_755710]-degree female relative, high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein /C212 mg/L, coronary artery
calcium score /C21300 Agatston units or /C2175th percentile
f o ra g e ,s e x ,a n de t h n i c i t y( f o ra d d i t i o n a li n f o r m a t i o n ,seehttp://www.mesa-nhlbi.o rg/CACReference.aspx .), ankle-
brachial index <0.9, and elevated lifetime risk of
ASCVD.
Theﬁndings support the use of statins to prevent both
nonfatal and fatal ASCVD events. Such an approach canreduce the large burden of disability from nonfatal stroke
(for which women are at higher risk than men) and
nonfatal CHD events. Primary and secondary preventionof ASCVD with statins can positively impact risinghealthcare costs. In addition, a high level of evidence wasfound that statins reduce total mortality in individuals witha history of prior ASCVD events (e.g., secondary-prevention settings). In individuals with no prior historyof ASCVD events (e.g., primary-prevention settings),
there is moderate evidence that statins reduce total mor-
tality in individuals at increased ASCVD risk. It should benoted that 2 meta-analyses published after the completionof the Expert Panel’s systematic review provide strongevidence that statins reduce total mortality in primaryprevention (12,13).
3. Critical Questions and Conclusions
3.1. Identi ﬁcation of CQs
Although limited to [ADDRESS_755711] important to answer in order to identifywhom to treat and with what treatment(s) and to considerhow intensively the treatments should be used. The ﬁrst 2
CQs evaluated the evidence for LDL-C and non –HDL-C
goals for the secondary and primary prevention of ASCVDwith cholesterol-lowering drug therapy. Titration to spe-
ciﬁc LDL-C goals has been considered a fundamental

Colors correspond to the Classes of Recommendation in Table 1 . Assessment of the potential for bene ﬁt and risk from statin therapy for ASCVD prevention provides the
framework for clinical decision making incorporating patient preferences.
*Percent reduction in LDL-C can be used as an indication of response and adherence to therapy, but is not in itself a treatment goal.
yThe Pooled Cohort Equations can be used to estimate 10-year ASCVD risk in individuals with and without diabetes. The estimator within this application should be used to
inform decision making in primary prevention patients not on a statin.
zConsider moderate-intensity statin as more appropriate in low-risk individuals.
xFor those in whom a risk assessment is uncertain, consider factors such as primary LDL-C /C21160 mg/dL or other evidence of genetic hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_125270], family history of
premature ASCVD with onset <[ADDRESS_755712]-degree male relative or <[ADDRESS_755713]-degree female relative, hs-CRP /C212 mg/L, CAC score /C21300 Agatston
units, or /C2175th percentile for age, sex, and ethnicity (for additional information, see http://www.mesa-nhlbi.org/CACReference.aspx), ABI <0.9, or lifetime risk of ASCVD.
Additional factors that may aid in individual risk assessment may be identi ﬁed in the future.
kPotential ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁts. The absolute reduction in ASCVD events from moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy can be approximated by [CONTACT_575858]
10-year ASCVD risk by [CONTACT_575859]-risk reduction from the intensity of statin initiated ( w30% for moderate-intensity statin or w45% for high-intensity statin therapy).
The net ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁt is estimated from the number of potential ASCVD events prevented with a statin, compared to the number of potential excess adverse effects.
{Potential adverse effects. The excess risk of diabetes is the main consideration in w0.1 excess cases per 100 individuals treated with a moderate-intensity statin for
1 year and w0.3 excess cases per 100 individuals treated with a high-intensity statin for 1 year. In RCTs, both statin-treated and placebo-treated participants experienced the
same rate of muscle symptoms. The actual rate of statin-related muscle symptoms in the clinical population is unclear. Muscle symptoms attributed to statin therapy should
be evaluated (see Table 8 , Safety Recommendation 8).

3.1.1. CQ1: LDL-C and Non –HDL-C Goals
in Secondary Prevention
CQ1: What is the evidence for LDL-C and non –HDL-C
goals for the secondary prevention of ASCVD?
The Expert Panel reviewed 19 RCTs to answer CQ1.
Although CQ1 is supported conceptually by [CONTACT_575860]-
lation of observational studies and observational data fromR C T s ,n od a t aw e r ei d e n t i ﬁed for treatment or titration
to a speci ﬁc LDL-C goal in adults with clinical ASCVD.
The majority of studies con ﬁrming the efﬁ cacy of
cholesterol reduction in improving clinical outcomes inpatients with clinical ASCVD used a single ﬁxed-dose
statin to lower LDL-C levels. In the 4S trial, 37% had
the dose of simvastatin raised from 20 mg/d to 40 mg/d to
achieve a total cholesterol level <200 mg/dL (16). The
Expert Panel was unable to ﬁnd any RCTs that evaluated
titration of all individuals in a treatment group to speciﬁcLDL-C targets <100 mg/dL or <70 mg/dL, nor were any
RCTs comparing 2 LDL-C treatment targets identi ﬁed.
No statin RCTs reporting on-treatment non –HDL-C
levels were identi ﬁed. (In CQ3, statin-nonstatin combina-
tion therapy was evaluated.)

goals for the primary prevention of ASCVD?The Expert Panel reviewed 6 RCTs. The 4 studies con-
ﬁrming the ef ﬁcacy of cholesterol reduction in improving
clinical outcomes in patients without ASCVD used ﬁxed-
dose statin therapy to lower LDL-C levels. In theAFCAPS-TEXCAPS (Air Force/[LOCATION_007] CoronaryAtherosclerosis Prevention Study) trial (17), in 50% ofparticipants, the lovastatin dose was raised from 20 mg to40 mg to achieve an LDL-C level <110 mg/dL. In the
MEGA (Management of Elevated Cholesterol in thePrimary Prevention Group of Adult Japanese) trial (18),
the dose of pravastatin could be uptitrated from 10 mg to
20 mg to achieve a total cholesterol level <220 mg/dL.
The Expert Panel did not ﬁnd any RCTs that evaluated
titration of all individuals in a treatment group to speci ﬁc
LDL-C targets<100 mg/dL or <70 mg/dL, nor were any
RCTs comparing 2 LDL-C treatment targets identi ﬁed.
No trials reported on-treatment non –HDL-C levels.3.1.3. CQ3: Ef ﬁcacy and Safety of
Cholesterol-Lowering Medications
CQ3: For primary and secondary prevention, what is
the impact on lipid levels, effectiveness, and safety of
speciﬁc cholesterol-modifying drugs used for lipid
management in general and in selected subgroups?
The populations examined included primary-prevention
adult patients who could not have a diagnosis of CHD
or cardiovascular disease. Interventions included pharma-
cotherapy with single-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_575583]-drugtherapi[INVESTIGATOR_575584], including statins, ﬁbrates (feno ﬁbrate, gem ﬁ-
brozil), nicotinic acid (niacin in immediate-, slow-, orextended-release form), bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe,omega-3 fatty acids (also called marine fatty acids, in-cluding eicosapentaenoic acid alone, docosahexanoic acid
alone, eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexanoic acid, and
alpha-linolenic acid). There were no ASCVD outcomesidenti ﬁed for plant sterols, sterol esters, stanols, or stanol
esters. A single ASCVD outcomes trial (19) used Xuez-hikang, an extract from red yeast Chinese rice, which wasnot available in the [LOCATION_002] during the timeframefor evidence review, so no recommendations were maderegarding its use.
The recommendations synthesize the evidence retrieved
for answering CQ3, along with the evidence from the trialsincluded in CQ1 and CQ2, to guide the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs for secondary or primary prevention ofASCVD.

zIndividuals with secondary causes of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_293759]. A triglyceride level /C21500 mg/dL was an exclusion criterion for almost all RCTs. Therefore, ruling out secondary
causes is necessary to avoid inappropriate statin therapy.
xNo RCTs included only individuals with LDL-C /C21190 mg/dL. However, many trials did include individuals with LDL-C /C21190 mg/dL, and all of these trials consistently demonstrated a reduction in ASCVD
events. In addition, the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists meta-analyses have shown that each 39-mg/dL reduction in LDL-C with statin therapy reduced ASCVD events by 22%, and the relative reductions in
ASCVD events were consistent across the range of LDL-C levels. Therefore, individuals with primary LDL-C /C21190 mg/dL should be treated with statin therapy.

LDL-C or non –HDL-C levels because the clinical trials
were essentially ﬁxed-dose trials (CQ1 and CQ2). Dosage
increases did occur in a few RCTs with the intent of
maximizing statin therapy. Therefore, these were not trulytests of de ﬁning optimal goals for LDL-C in primary and
secondary prevention because not all individuals in thestatin treatment groups received drug therapy titratedto achieve a speciﬁ c LDL-C or non –HDL-C goal, nor
were speci ﬁc treatment targets compared. One RCT in
CQ3 was identi ﬁed that showed no additional ASCVD
event reduction from the addition of nonstatin therapy tofurther lower non –HDL-C levels once an LDL-C goal
had been reached. In AIM-HIGH (AtherothrombosisIntervention in Metabolic Syndrome With Low HDL/High Triglycerides and Impact on Global Health Out-comes), the additional reduction in non –HDL-C levels
(as well as further reductions in apolipoprotein B, lipo-protein[a], and triglycerides in addition to HDL-Cincreases) with niacin therapy did not further reduceASCVD risk in individuals treated to LDL-C levels of 40to 80 mg/dL (9).
Therefore, given the absence of data on titration of drug
therapy to speciﬁ c goals, no recommendations are made for
or against speciﬁ c LDL-C or non –HDL-C goals for the
primary or secondary prevention of ASCVD.
4.3. Secondary Prevention
Women and men with clinical ASCVD (de ﬁned from the
RCT inclusion criteria as acute coronary syndromes; historyof MI, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterialrevascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or pe-ripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic
origin) arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic
attack, or peripheral arterial disease presumed to be ofatherosclerotic origin are at increased risk for recurrentASCVD and ASCVD death. An extensive body of evi-dence demonstrates that high-intensity statin therapy re-duces ASCVD events more than moderate-intensity statintherapy ( Table 4 ) in individuals with clinical ASCVD.High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated for
adults /C2075 years of age with clinical ASCVD who are not
receiving statin therapy, or the intensity should be increasedin those receiving a low- or moderate-intensity statin, un-less they have a history of intolerance to high-intensitystatin therapy or other characteristics that could inﬂ uence
safety (Section 5). This is consistent with RCT data. In
2 trials, patients were previously treated with a moderately
intensive statin (46,47), and in 2 trials, 75% to 97% of
patients had not received prior statin therapy (48,78). Thehigh-intensity statins atorvastatin 80 mg and rosuvastatin20 mg daily reduce LDL-C /C2150% on average and have
been shown to reduce ASCVD events in RCTs.
Although atorvastatin 40 mg reduces LDL-C by [CONTACT_97458]-
roximately /C2150%, this dose was used in only [ADDRESS_755718] if the
participant was unable to tolerate atorvastatin 80 mg/dL.
Whether an individual receiving atorvastatin 40 mg should
be uptitrated to atorvastatin 80 mg should be based on thepotential for an ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁt and the
potential for adverse effects, drug –drug interactions, and
consider patient preferences.
In individuals with clinical ASCVD in whom high-
intensity statin therapy would otherwise be used, eitherwhen high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or when
characteristics predisposing to statin-associated adverse ef-
fects are present, moderate-intensity statin should be used asthe second option, if tolerated ( Section 5 ). In the relatively
few individuals >[ADDRESS_755719], individuals >75 years of age did experience a
reduction in ASCVD events in the trials of mostly moderate-intensity statin therapy, as compared with control. Therefore,moderate-intensity statin therapy should be considered forindividuals >75 years of age with clinical ASCVD. However,
in acknowledgment that older participants in RCTs werelikely tobehealthier than many older individualsin the generalpopulation, the use of statin therapy should be individualizedTable 5. High-, Moderate-, and Low-Intensity Statin Therapy (Used in the RCTs Reviewed by [CONTACT_293810]) *

4.4. Primary Prevention in Individuals
‡21 Years of Age With LDL-C ‡190 mg/dL
This guideline recognizes that individuals /C2121 years of age
with primary, severe elevations of LDL-C ( /C21190 mg/dL)
have a high lifetime risk for ASCVD events. This is due to
their lifetime exposure to markedly elevated LDL-Clevels arising from genetic causes. Thus, at age 21, theseindividuals should receive statin therapy if they havenot already been diagnosed and treated before this

x1) Potential ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁts. The absolute reduction in ASCVD events from moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy can be approximated by [CONTACT_575868] 10-year ASCVD risk by [CONTACT_575859]-risk reduction from the intensity of statin initiated ( w30% for moderate-intensity statin or w45% for high-intensity statin
therapy). The net ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁt is estimated from the number of potential ASCVD events prevented with a statin, compared to the number of potential excess
adverse effects. 2) Potential adverse effects. The excess risk of diabetes is the main consideration in w0.1 excess cases per 100 individuals treated with a moderate-intensity
statin for 1 year and w0.3 excess cases per 100 individuals treated with a high-intensity statin for 1 year. In RCTs, both statin-treated and placebo-treated participants expe-
rienced the same rate of muscle symptoms. The actual rate of statin-related muscle symptoms in the clinical population is unclear. Muscle symptoms attributed to statin therapyshould be evaluated (see Table 8 , Safety Recommendation 8).

dividuals with primary severe elevations of LDL-C. Inaddition to a maximally tolerated dose of statin, nonstatincholesterol-lowering medications are often needed to lowerLDL-C to acceptable levels in these individuals. Because
the hypercholesterolemia in these high-risk individuals is
often genetically determined, family screening is especiallyimportant in this group to identify additional family mem-bers who would bene ﬁt from assessment and early treatment.

addressed in an AHA statement (45).

4.5. Primary Prevention in
Individuals With Diabetes
A high level of evidence supports the use of moderate-
intensity statin therapy in persons with diabetes who are
40 to 75 years of age. The only trial of high-intensity statin
therapy in primary prevention was performed in a popu-
lation without diabetes. However, a high level of evidenceexisted for event reduction with statin therapy in in-dividuals with a /C217.5% estimated 10-year ASCVD risk
(Section 4.6) who did not have diabetes to recommend
high-intensity statin therapy preferentially for individualswith diabetes and a /C217.5% estimated 10-year ASCVD risk
(Section 4.7 ). This consideration for those with diabetes
who are 40 to 75 years of age recognizes that these in-dividuals are at substantially increased lifetime risk forASCVD events and death. Moreover, individuals withdiabetes experience greater morbidity and worse survivalafter the onset of clinical ASCVD. In persons with dia-betes who are <40 years of age or >75 years of age, or
whose LDL-C is <70 mg/dL, statin therapy should be
individualized on the basis of considerations of ASCVD
risk-reduction bene ﬁts, the potential for adverse effects and
drug– drug interactions, and patient preferences (Figure 4).
4.6. Primary Prevention in Individuals Without
Diabetes and With LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL
In individuals 40 to 75 years of age with LDL-C 70 to
189 mg/dL who do not have clinical ASCVD or diabetes,Table 7. Rationale for the Expert Panel Approach to
Primary-Prevention Guidelines
1. Cholesterol-lowering medications, particularly statins, are ef ﬁcacious and
effective for reducing risk of initial cardiovascular events.
2. Statins are associated with similar relative risk reductions for cardiovas-
cular events across the majority of primary-prevention patient groups
studied.*
3. The extent of relative risk reduction for ASCVD is proportional to the degree
of LDL-C lowering observed on statin therapy. Therefore, more intensivestatin therapy could reduce risk more than moderate- or lower-intensitystatin therapy.
4. According to consistent ﬁndings, the absolute bene ﬁt in ASCVD risk
reduction is proportional to the baseline risk of the patient group or indi-vidual and to the intensity of statin therapy.
5. Patients or groups at higher baseline absolute risk, therefore, will derive
greater absolute bene ﬁt from initiation of statin therapy over a period of
5 to 10 years.
6. The absolute risk for adverse outcomes, including a small excess in cases
of newly diagnosed diabetes, also appears to be proportional to the in-tensity of statin therapy. However, the adverse outcome of incident (orearlier diagnosis of) diabetes must be weighed in the context of thepotentially fatal or debilitating occurrence of MI or stroke that could beprevented by [CONTACT_275084].
7. The Expert Panel emphasizes that the occurrence of a major ASCVD event
(MI or stroke) represents a much greater harm to health status than doesan increase in blood glucose leading to a diagnosis of diabetes. The net
absolute bene ﬁtof statin therapy can be considered as a comparison of the
absolute risk reduction for ASCVD with the absolute excess risks, including
that for diabetes. Bene ﬁt also could be understood as a comparison of the
number of statin-treated patients that would result in the prevention of 1case of major ASCVD (NNT) with the number of statin-treated patients thatwould result in 1 excess case of diabetes (NNH).
8. Because the absolute bene ﬁt in terms of ASCVD risk reduction depends on
the baseline absolute risk for ASCVD, the absolute bene ﬁtfrom initiation of
statin therapy is lower and would approach the risk for adverse effects inpatients with lower baseline levels of predicted ASCVD risk.
9. Available RCT evidence indicates a clear net absolute beneﬁ t of initiation of
moderate-to-intensive statin therapy at a baseline estimated 10-yearASCVD risk of /C217.5%.
10.Available RCT evidence indicates that when baseline ASCVD risk is 5.0%
to<7.5%, there is still net absolute bene ﬁt with moderate-intensity statin
therapy. However, the tradeoffs between the ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁt
and adverse effects are less clear. Thus, a clinician-patient discussion iseven more important for individuals with this range of ASCVD risk. The netbene ﬁt of high-intensity statin therapy may be marginal in such individuals.
Conclusion
On the basis of the above tenets and its review of the evidence, thisguideline recommends initiation of moderate or intensive statin therapy forpatients who are eligible for primary ASCVD prevention and have apredicted 10-year “hard ”ASCVD risk of /C217.5%. This guideline recommends
that initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy be considered forpatients with predicted 10-year “hard ”ASCVD risk of 5.0% to <7.5%.

initiation of statin therapy based on estimated 10-year
ASCVD risk is recommended, regardless of sex, race, or
ethnicity (Section 4.7). Point estimates of statin-associatedreductions in the relative risk of ASCVD in primary pre-vention are similar for both women and men. There also isno evidence that the ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁto r
adverse-effect pro ﬁles differ by [CONTACT_545].
To better identify those individuals without ASCVD
who would most bene ﬁt from statin therapy to reduce
ASCVD risk, data were used from the 3 exclusivelyprimary-prevention RCTs that included individuals withLDL-C levels <190 mg/dL, almost all of whom had
LDL-C levels /C2170 mg/dL (17,18,49). From these trials,
an estimate of the expected 10-year ASCVD event rateswas derived from the placebo groups. The rates of excessadverse events in the statin treatment groups were obtainedfrom meta-analyses of statin RCTs. A high level of evi-
dence for an ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁt from initia-
tion of moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy in
individuals 40 to 75 years of age with /C217.5% estimated 10-
year ASCVD risk was found (Section 4.7). The reductionin ASCVD risk clearly outweighs the potential for adverseeffects ( Table 7 ). Thus, it is recommended that individuals
40 to 75 years of age, who are not already candidates forstatin therapy on the basis of the presence of clinical
ASCVD, diabetes, or LDL-C /C21190 mg/dL, receive statin
therapy if they have a /C217.5% estimated 10-year risk for
ASCVD and LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL. Although only [ADDRESS_755726] included individualswith LDL-C 70 to <100 mg/dL, the Cholesterol Treat-
ment Trialists 2010 meta-analysis found a relative reduc-tion in ASCVD events of similar magnitude across thespectrum of LDL-C levels /C2170 mg/dL (20). Given that
the relative risk reduction is similar across the range ofLDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL, the absolute bene ﬁt of statin
therapy in primary prevention is determined by [CONTACT_575869]ﬂected in the estimated 10-year ASCVD risk.
A conservative estimate of adverse events includes excess
cases of new-onset diabetes and rare cases of myopathyand hemorrhagic stroke. The rate of excess diabetes varies
by [CONTACT_575870]. For moderate-intensity statins, approxi-
mately 0.1 excess case of diabetes per 100 statin-treatedindividuals per year has been observed, and for high-intensity statins, approximately 0.3 excess case of diabetesper 100 statin-treated individuals per year has been observed(52,81). The long-term adverse effects of statin-associated
cases of diabetes over a 10-year period are unclear and areunlikely to be equivalent to an MI, stroke, or ASCVD
death. Myopathy ( w0.01 excess case per 100) and hemor-
rhagic stroke ( w0.01 excess case per 100) make minimal
contributions to excess risk from statin therapy (13).
Although a similar level of evidence of a reduction in
ASCVD events from moderate- and high-intensity statin
therapy is present for those with a 5% to <7.5% estimated
10-year ASCVD risk, the potential for adverse effects mayoutweigh the potential for ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁt
when high-intensity statin therapy is used in this risk group.However, for moderate-intensity statin therapy, the ASCVDrisk reduction clearly exceeds the potential for adverse effects.
Before initiating statin therapy for the primary preven-
tion of ASCVD in adults with /C217.5% or 5% to <7.5%
estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, it is reasonable for clini-cians and patients to engage in a discussion of the proposedtherapy. This discussion should include the potential for
ASCVD bene ﬁt, the potential for adverse effects and
drug –drug interactions, and consideration of patient pref-
erences for treatment.
No primary-prevention RCT data were available for
individuals 21 to 39 years of age, and few data were
available for individuals >75 years of age. Additionally, in
individuals 40 to 75 years of age with <5% estimated 10-
year ASCVD risk, the net bene ﬁt from statin therapy over
a 10-year period may be small. Therefore, in adults withLDL-C <190 mg/dL who are not otherwise identi ﬁed in
a statin bene ﬁt group or for whom a risk-based treatment
decision is uncertain after quantitative risk assessment,clinician knowledge, experience, and skill ( “the art of
medicine ”) and patient preferences all contribute to the
decision to initiate statin therapy (82). Before initiation ofstatin therapy, the clinician-patient discussion should
include consideration of the potential for ASCVD risk-
reduction bene ﬁts, adverse effects, and drug– drug in-
teractions. Additional factors may also be considered toinform treatment decision making in selected individuals.Factors that can contribute to assessment of ASCVD riskinclude primary LDL-C /C21160 mg/dL or other evidence of
genetic hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_125270]; family history of prematureASCVD with onset <[ADDRESS_755727]-degree male
relative or <[ADDRESS_755728]-degree female relative;
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein /C212 mg/L, coronary
artery calcium score /C21300 Agatston units or /C2175th
percentile for age, sex, and ethnicity (for additional infor-mation, see http://www.mesa-nhlbi.org/CACReference.aspx);
ankle-brachial index <0.9; or elevated lifetime risk of
ASCVD. Additional factors that might aid in individualrisk assessment could be identi ﬁed in the future.
For an individual <40 years of age, the 10-year horizon
might not be optimal for predicting lifetime risk ofASCVD (see 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on theAssessment of Cardiovascular Risk) (11). Future RCTswill be needed to determine the optimal age at which toinitiate statin therapy to reduce ASCVD risk, as well as todetermine the optimum duration of statin therapy.
4.7. Risk Assessment in Primary Prevention
To estimate more closely the total burden of ASCVD, this
guideline recommends a comprehensive assessment of theestimated 10-year risk for an ASCVD event that includesboth CHD and stroke. This is in contrast to the use of anestimated 10-year risk for hard CHD (de ﬁned as nonfatal
MI and CHD death) (83).Stone et al. JACC Vol. 63, No. 25, 2014
2013 ACC/AHA Blood Cholesterol Guideline July 1, 2014:2889 –9342906
Page 134 of 356Page 136 of 364
This guideline recommends using the new Pooled
Cohort Risk Assessment Equations developed by [CONTACT_575871] 10-year ASCVDrisk (de ﬁned as ﬁrst-occurrence nonfatal and fatal MI and
nonfatal and fatal stroke) for the identi ﬁcation of candi-
dates for statin therapy (see http://my.americanheart.org/cvriskcalculator and http://www.cardiosource.org/en/
Science-And-Quality/Practice-Guidelines-and-Quality-Standards/2013-Prevention-Guideline-Tools.aspx for risk
calculator). These equations should be used to predict
stroke as well as CHD events in non-Hispanic, Caucasian,and African-American women and men [ADDRESS_755729] LDL-C levels 70 to189 mg/dL and are not receiving statin therapy. A morecomplete discussion of risk assessment is provided in theFull Panel Report Supplement.
This guideline does not require speci ﬁc risk factor
counting for risk assessment or the use of RCT risk factorinclusion criteria to determine statin eligibility. Rather, aglobal ASCVD risk assessment to guide initiation of statintherapy was chosen for several important reasons (seerationale in Table 7 and further discussion in Section 7.3 of
the Full Panel Report Supplement): 1) The CholesterolTreatment Trialists individual-level meta-analyses wereused to evaluate the effect of statins in various important
patient subgroups, including risk factor cutpoints used for
RCT eligibility. The Expert Panel found that statin ther-apy reduces ASCVD events regardless of risk factorcharacteristics in both primary and secondary prevention.Therefore, the rationale for using ﬁxed cutpoints to
determine whether statin therapy should be used is refutedby a consideration of the total body of evidence. 2) Use ofabsolute ASCVD risk facilitates a quantitative assessment
of the potential for an ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁta s
compared with the potential for adverse effects. 3) Use of
an RCT eligibility criteria –based approach results in failure
to identify a substantial proportion of higher-risk in-dividuals who could bene ﬁt from statin therapy and over-
identi ﬁcation of very-low-risk individuals who might not
experience a net bene ﬁt from statin therapy over a 10-year
period.
4.8. Heart Failure and Hemodialysis
No recommendation was made with regard to the initia-
tion or continuation of statin therapy in 2 speci ﬁc groups:
1) individuals with [LOCATION_001] Heart Association class II –
IV heart failure, and 2) individuals undergoing mainte-nance hemodialysis. In the 4 RCTs reviewed that specif-ically addressed statin treatment in these groups, there
were individuals with and without heart disease (84 –87).
Although statin therapy did not reduce ASCVD events in
2 RCTs for each condition (84 –87), there was insuf ﬁcient
information on which to base recommendations for oragainst statin treatment. Future research may identifysubgroups of patients with these conditions that maybeneﬁt from statin therapy. In individuals with theseconditions, the potential for ASCVD risk-reduction ben-
eﬁts, adverse effects, and drug –drug interactions, along
with other cautions and contraindications to statin therapy
and choice of statin dose, must also be considered by [CONTACT_575872].
5. Safety: Recommendations
See safety recommendations for statins ( Table 8 ) and
nonstatin drugs ( Table 9).
RCT data were also used to examine the safety of lipid
medications. From the statin RCTs and meta-analyses,patient characteristics and monitoring strategies wereidenti ﬁed that should enhance the safe use of high- and
moderate-intensity statin therapy. Patient characteristicsthat may inﬂuence statin safety include but are not limited
to: multiple or serious comorbidities, including impaired
renal or hepatic function; a history of previous statinintolerance or muscle disorders; concomitant use of drugsaffecting statin metabolism; a history of hemorrhagicstroke; and age >[ADDRESS_755730] routine measure-
ment of creatine kinase in individuals receiving statin
therapy. This measurement should be reserved for those
with muscle symptoms. However, measurement of a base-line creatine kinase may be useful in those at increased riskof adverse muscle events. Such individuals include thosewith a personal or family history of statin intolerance ormuscle disease, clinical presentation, or concomitant drugtherapy that might increase the likelihood of myopathy.
Expert recommendations are also provided for managing
muscle symptoms while a patient is on statin therapy.These useful management suggestions were derived fromother clinical trial data and clinical experience to enhancethe safety and tolerability of statin therapy. Consistent withthe protocols of the RCTs, patients should be asked at eachvisit, both before and after initiation of statin therapy,about muscle symptoms such as muscle weakness or fa-tigue, aching, pain, tenderness, cramps, or stiffness. The
recommended approach for management of muscle
symptoms is described in Table 8, Recommendation 8.
This guideline recommends that baseline measurement
of transaminase (alanine transaminase; ALT) levels shouldbe performed before initiation of statin therapy. Thisapproach was taken in the RCTs reviewed for this report.There is no recommendation to monitor transaminase(ALT) levels because ALT monitoring was performed in
the RCTs, and there was no signi ﬁcant difference between
placebo groups and statin treatment groups in the rates of
ALT elevations. In addition, the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration has indicated that if the baseline hepatictransaminases are normal, further hepatic monitoring isnot needed. During statin therapy, it is reasonable tomeasure hepatic function if symptoms suggestingJACC Vol. 63, No. 25, 2014 Stone et al.

of appetite, abdominal pain, dark-colored urine, or yel-

Decreasing the statin dose may be considered when
2 consecutive values of LDL-C are <40 mg/dL. This
recommendation was based on the approach taken in [ADDRESS_755731]-risk
individuals ( Section 4.5 ). All individuals receiving statins
should be counseled on healthy-lifestyle habits. In-dividuals receiving statin therapy should be evaluated fornew-onset diabetes according to the current diabetesscreening guidelines (91). Those who develop diabetesTable 8. Statin Safety Recommendations

–Evaluate the patient for other conditions that might increase the risk formuscle symptoms (e.g., hypothyroidism, reduced renal or hepatic func-tion, rheumatologic disorders such as polymyalgia rheumatica, steroidmyopathy, vitamin D de ﬁciency, or primary muscle diseases).
–If muscle symptoms resolve, and if no contraindication exists, give thepatient the original or a lower dose of the same statin to establish acausal relationship between the muscle symptoms and statin therapy.
–If a causal relationship exists, discontinue the original statin. Oncemuscle symptoms resolve, use a low dose of a different statin.
–Once a low dose of a statin is tolerated, gradually increase the dose astolerated.
–If, after 2 months without statin treatment, muscle symptoms orelevated CK levels do not resolve completely, consider other causes ofmuscle symptoms listed above.

zStatin use is associated with a very modest excess risk of new-onset diabetes in RCTs and meta-analyses of RCTs (i.e., w0.1 excess cases per 100 individuals treated for 1 year with moderate-intensity
statin therapy and w0.3 excess cases per 100 individuals treated for 1 year with high-intensity statin therapy. The increased risk of new-onset diabetes appears to be con ﬁned to those with risk factors
for diabetes. These individuals are also at higher risk of ASCVD because of these risk factors. Therefore, if a statin-treated individual develops diabetes as detected by [CONTACT_575874], he or she should be counseled to adhere to a heart-healthy dietary pattern, engage in physical activity, achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, cease tobacco use, and continue statintherapy to reduce the risk of ASCVD events.

6. Managing Statin Therapy:
Recommendations
See Table [ADDRESS_755734] evidence supports the use of an
initial fasting lipid panel (total cholesterol, triglycerides,
HDL-C, and calculated LDL -C), followed by a second
lipid panel 4 to 12 weeks after in itiation of statin therapy,
to determine a patient ’s adherence. Thereafter, assess-
ments should be performed every 3 to 12 months asclinically indicated. Adherence to both medication andlifestyle regimens are required for ASCVD risk reduc-tion. After statin therapy has been initiated, someTable 10. Recommendations for Monitoring, Optimizing, and Addressing Insuf ﬁcient Response to Statin Therapy

Statements ACC/AHA COR ACC/AHA LOE
Monitoring Statin Therapy
1. Adherence to medication and lifestyle, therapeutic response to statin
therapy, and safety should be regularly assessed. This should also
include a fasting lipid panel performed within 4 –12 weeks after initiation
or dose adjustment, and every 3 –12 months thereafter. Other safety
measurements should be measured as clinically indicated.A (Strong) 45 IA
Optimizing Statin Therapy
1. The maximum tolerated intensity of statin should be used in individuals for
whom a high- or moderate-intensity statin is recommended but not tolerated.B (Moderate) 25,26,27,45 I* B
Insuf ﬁcient Response to Statin Therapy
1. In individuals who have a less-than-anticipated therapeutic response or are
intolerant of the recommended intensity of statin therapy, the following shouldbe performed:
/C15Reinforce medication adherence.
/C15Reinforce adherence to intensive lifestyle changes.
/C15Exclude secondary causes of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].A (Strong) 45 IA
2. It is reasonable to use the following as indicators of anticipated therapeutic
response to the recommended intensity of statin therapy. Focus is on theintensity of the statin therapy. As an aid to monitoring:
/C15High-intensity statin therapy ygenerally results in an average LDL-C
reduction of /C2150% from the untreated baseline.
/C15Moderate-intensity statin therapy generally results in an averageLDL-C reduction of 30% to <50% from the untreated baseline.
/C15LDL-C levels and percents reduction are to be used only to assessresponse to therapy and adherence. They are not to be used asperformance standards.E (Expert Opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]) d IIa B
(46 –48,78,
106,107)
3. In individuals at higher ASCVD risk receiving the maximum tolerated
intensity of statin therapy who continue to have a less-than-anticipatedtherapeutic response, addition of nonstatin cholesterol-lowering drug(s) maybe considered if the ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁts outweigh the potential for
adverse effects.Higher-risk individuals include:
/C15Individuals with clinical ASCVD z<75 years of age.
/C15Individuals with baseline LDL-C /C21190 mg/dL.
/C15Individuals 40 –75 years of age with diabetes.
Preference should be given to nonstatin cholesterol-lowering drugs shown to
reduce ASCVD events in RCTs.E (Expert Opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]) d IIb C
(9,14,108 –110)
4. In individuals who are candidates for statin treatment but are completely
statin intolerant, it is reasonable to use nonstatin cholesterol-lowering drugsthat have been shown to reduce ASCVD events in RCTs if the ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁts outweigh the potential for adverse effects.E (Expert Opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]) d IIa B
(88,101,111– 116)
*Several RCTs found that low-intensity and low-moderate –intensity statin therapy reduced ASCVD events. In addition, the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists meta-analyses found that each 39-mg/dL
reduction in LDL-C reduces ASCVD risk by 22%. Therefore, the Panel considered that submaximal statin therapy should be used to reduce ASCVD risk in those unable to tolerate moderate- or high-
intensity statin therapy.
yIn those already on a statin, in whom baseline LDL-C is unknown, an LDL-C level <100 mg/dL was observed in most individuals receiving high-intensity statin therapy.
zClinical ASCVD includes acute coronary syndromes, or a history of myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or
peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin.

*Fasting lipid panel preferred. In a nonfasting individual, a non– HDL-C level /C21220 mg/dL may indicate genetic hypercholesterolemia that requires further evaluation or a secondary
etiology. If nonfasting triglycerides are /C21500 mg/dL, a fasting lipid panel is required.
yIn those already on a statin, in whom baseline LDL-C is unknown, an LDL-C <100 mg/dL was observed in most individuals receiving high-intensity statin therapy in RCTs.

In those already on a statin, in whom the baseline LDL-
C is unknown, an LDL-C <100 mg/dL was observed in
most individuals receiving high-intensity statin therapy in
RCTs.
However, there are many limitations of using LDL-C
<100 mg/dL as a ﬁxed target. If a moderate- or low-intensity
statin results in an LDL-C level <100 mg/dL in a patient
with ASCVD, the evidence suggests that a high-intensitystatin, if tolerated, provides a greater reduction in ASCVD
events. Conversely, in those with LDL-C levels slightly
>100 mg/dL on a high-intensity statin, some options such as
niacin might require down-titration of the statin intensity inan effort to improve safety. This would result in a suboptimalintensity of evidence-based statin therapy. Additional limi-tations to using LDL-C treatment targets are discussed in theFull Panel Report Supplement.
No evidence was found that titration or combination-
drug therapy to achieve speci ﬁc LDL-C or non –HDL-C
levels or percent reductions improved ASCVD outcomes.Therefore, this guideline does not recommend their use asperformance measures.
The percent LDL-C reduction may not only indicate
adherence, but also may re ﬂect biological variability in
the response to statin therapy. This acknowledges that someindividuals may have less than an average response. Attention
to adherence of statin and lifestyle therapy and evaluation
and treatment of secondary causes ( Table 6 ) that might el-
evate LDL-C, may address less-than-anticipated responsesto a speci ﬁc statin dosage. Whether the dose of statin therapy
should be increased on the basis of a less-than-anticipatedaverage response should be left to clinical judgment.
6.3.2. Nonstatins Added to Statins or
in Statin-Intolerant Individuals
Adherence to lifestyle changes and to statin therapy should
be reemphasized before the addition of a nonstatin drug isconsidered ( Figure 5 ). RCTs evaluating the ASCVD event
reductions from nonstatins used as monotherapy werereviewed, as were RCTs evaluating the additional reduc-tion in ASCVD events from nonstatin therapy added tostatin therapy. The Expert Panel could ﬁnd no data sup-
porting the routine use of nonstatin drugs combined withstatin therapy to further reduce ASCVD events. In addi-tion, no RCTs that assessed ASCVD outcomes in statin-intolerant patients were found.
Clinicians treating high-risk patients who have a less-
than-anticipated response to statins, who are unable totolerate a less-than-recommended intensity of a statin, orwho are completely statin intolerant, may consider the
addition of a nonstatin cholesterol-lowering therapy.
High-risk individuals include those with ASCVD, thosewith LDL-C /C21190 mg/dL, and those with diabetes
40–[ADDRESS_755737] been shown in RCTs to provide ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁts that outweigh the potential for adverseeffects and drug –drug interactions, and consider patient
preferences.
7. Selected Clinical and
Population Subgroups
7.1. Sex and Racial and Ethnic Subgroups
Because the RCT evidence shows that the absolute bene ﬁt
of statin treatment is proportional to baseline ASCVD
risk, treatment decisions for women and racial and ethnicsubgroups should be based on the level of ASCVD risk.This conclusion is a departure from previous approachesthat focused on LDL-C levels to guide treatment de-cisions. Statin treatment based on estimated 10-yearASCVD risk avoids the overtreatment of lower-riskgroups, such as younger, non-Hispanic white women
who, despi[INVESTIGATOR_575589]-C, are typi[INVESTIGATOR_575590] ﬁcantly increased risk for ASCVD in the next
[ADDRESS_755738] likely to provide ASCVD risk reduction
on the basis of the estimated 10-year risk of ASCVD.
7.2. Individuals >75 Years of Age
Fewer people >[ADDRESS_755739] evidence does support the contin-uation of statins beyond 75 years of age in persons who arealready taking and tolerating these drugs. A larger amount
of data supports the use of moderate-intensity statin
therapy for secondary prevention in individuals with clin-ical ASCVD who are >75 years of age. However, the
limited information available did not clearly supportinitiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondaryprevention in individuals >75 years of age.
Few data were available to indicate an ASCVD event
reduction bene ﬁt in primary prevention among individuals
>[ADDRESS_755740] clinical ASCVD.
Therefore, initiation of statins for primary prevention ofASCVD in individuals >75 years of age requires consid-
eration of additional factors, including increasing comor-bidities, safety considerations, and priorities of care. ThePooled Cohort Equations can also provide information onexpected 10-year ASCVD risk for those 76 to 79 years ofage that may inform the treatment decision. These factors
may in ﬂuence decisions about cholesterol-lowering drug
therapy, especially in the primary-prevention setting.
Accordingly, a discussion of the potential ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁts, risk of adverse effects, drug– drug in-
teractions, and consideration of patient preferences shouldprecede the initiation of statin therapy for primary pre-vention in older individuals.JACC Vol. 63, No. 25, 2014 Stone et al.

8. Limitations
The evidence-based recommendations in this guideline
focus on patient groups who are well represented in RCTs
and/or are highly likely to have high-risk genetic condi-
tions, so the recommendations are designed to informrather than replace clinical judgment. However, there areother patient groups for which a robust evidence base islacking but that may nevertheless include some persons forwhom statin treatment should be considered (after takingpatient preferences into account) on the basis of the po-tential for ASCVD bene ﬁts to exceed the risk of adverse
events and drug –drug interactions. Clinician judgment is
especially important for several patient groups for whichthe RCT evidence is insuf ﬁcient for guiding clinical rec-
ommendations. These patient groups include youngeradults ( <40 years of age) who have a low estimated 10-year
ASCVD risk but a high lifetime ASCVD risk basedon single strong factors or multiple risk factors. Othergroups include those with serious comorbidities and
increased ASCVD risk (e.g., individuals with HIV or
rheumatologic or inﬂ ammatory diseases, or who have un-
dergone a solid organ transplantation). This guidelineencourages clinicians to use clinical judgment in thesesituations, weighing potential bene ﬁts, adverse effects,
drug– drug interactions, and consider patient preferences.
Previous guidelines have taken less rigorous approaches
to identifying the evidence to support their recommen-
dations. In contrast, to minimize various sources of bias,
the present recommendations are based on data availablefrom RCTs and systematic reviews and meta-analyses ofRCTs that were graded as fair to good quality by [CONTACT_575875], with the assistance of an independent methodolo-gist. To avoid biases, evidence from post-hoc analyses ofincluded RCTs, from poor-quality RCTs, and from
observational studies was not considered. This approach
resulted in a comprehensive set of evidence-based clinicalrecommendations for the treatment of blood cholesterol toreduce ASCVD risk.
9. Evidence Gaps and
Future Research Needs
After a systematic review of the literature, several research
priorities are suggested that address existing evidence gaps
and offer the greatest potential to inform and inﬂ uence
clinical practice and reduce ASCVD morbidity and mor-tality. High-priority research areas are:
1. Outcomes of RCTs to evaluate statins for the pri-
mary prevention of ASCVD in adults >75 years of
age.
2. Outcomes of RCTs to evaluate alternative treatment
strategies for ASCVD risk reduction. These RCTsmay compare titration to speci ﬁc cholesterol or
apolipoprotein goals versus ﬁxed-dose statin therapy
in high-risk patients.
3. RCTs to determine whether submaximal statin
doses, combined with nonstatin therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], reduceASCVD risk in statin-intolerant patients.
4. Evaluation of the incidence, pathophysiology, clin-
ical course, and clinical outcomes of new-onsetdiabetes associated with statin therapy.
5. Outcomes of RCTs of new lipid-modifying agents to
determine the incremental ASCVD event-reductionbeneﬁts when added to evidence-based statin therapy.
Additional research recommendations are included in
the Full Panel Report Supplement.
10. Conclusions
These recommendations arose from careful consideration
of an extensive body of higher-quality evidence derivedfrom RCTs and systematic reviews and meta-analyses ofRCTs. Rather than LDL-C or non –HDL-C targets, this
guideline used the intensity of statin therapy as the goal oftreatment. Through a rigorous process, [ADDRESS_755741] evidence demonstrated a reduction in ASCVD
events with a good margin of safety from moderate- orhigh-intensity statin therapy:
Four Statin Bene ﬁt Groups:
1. Individuals with clinical ASCVD2. Individuals with primary elevations of LDL-C /C21190
mg/dL
3. Individuals 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes and
LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL without clinical ASCVD
4. Individuals without clinical ASCVD or diabetes
who are [ADDRESS_755742] LDL-C 70 to
189 mg/dL and an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of
/C217.5%. This requires a clinician-patient discussion.
Individuals in the last group can be identi ﬁed by [CONTACT_575876]. Lifestylecounseling should occur at the initial and follow-up visitsas the foundation for statin therapy and may improve theoverall risk factor pro ﬁle.
Most importantly, our focus is on those individuals most
likely to bene ﬁt from evidence-based statin therapy to
reduce ASCVD risk. Implementation of these ASCVD
risk-reduction guidelines will help to substantially address
the large burden of fatal and nonfatal ASCVD in the[LOCATION_002]. We realize that these guidelines represent achange from previous guidelines, but clinicians have becomeaccustomed to change when that change is consistent withthe current evidence. Continued accumulation of qualitytrial data will inform future cholesterol treatment guidelines.Stone et al. JACC Vol. 63, No. 25, 2014

This table re ﬂects the relevant healthcare-related relationships of authors with industry and other entities provided by [CONTACT_575879] (2008 –2012). Both
compensated and uncompensated relationships are reported. These relationships were reviewed and updated in conjunction with all meetings and conference calls of the Expert Panel during the
document development process. Authors with relevant relationships during the document development process recused themselves from voting on recommendations relevant to their relationships. In
the spi[INVESTIGATOR_575599], the ACC and AHA asked Expert Panel members to provide updates and approve the ﬁnal version of this table, which includes current relevant relationships (2013). To review
the NHLBI and ACC/AHA ’s current comprehensive policies for managing relationships with industry and other entities, please refer to http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cvd_adult/coi-rwi_policy.htm
and http://www.cardiosource.org/Science-And-Quality/Practice-Guidelines-and-Quality-Standards/Relationships-With-Industry-Policy.aspx. Per ACC/AHA policy: A person is deemed to have a signiﬁ cant
interest in a business if the interest represents ownership of /C215% of the voting stock or share of the business entity, or ownership of /C21$10,000 of the fair market value of the business entity; or if funds
received by [CONTACT_575880] 5% of the person ’s gross income for the previous year. Relationships that exist with no ﬁnancial bene ﬁt are also included for the purpose of
transparency. Relationships in this table are modest unless otherwise noted.

intensive statin therapy or statin therapy with placebo/control, the
relative CVD risk reduction was similar for those <65 years, 65 to /C2075,
or>75 years of age. There is less information to estimate the
magnitude of bene ﬁt in those under age 45 or over age 75 years,
because fewer participants in these age groups were enrolled in clinical
trials. More intensive statin therapy did not appear to reduce CVD risk,
compared with less intensive statin therapy, in those with ASCVD and
age>75 years. Statin therapy, compared with control (most RCTs
evaluated moderate-intensity statin therapy), had a similar magnitude
of RR reduction in those >75 as in those /C2075 years of age with and
without ASCVD.

Appendix 5. Expanded Discussion of What ’s New in the Guideline
Focus on ASCVD Risk Reduction: 4 Statin Bene ﬁt Groups
/C15The 2013 guideline focuses on treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce ASCVD risk. Each Expert Panel was limited in the number of CQs it could choose. When
the CQs from the Risk Assessment and Lifestyle Work Groups were combined with the 3 Cholesterol Panel CQs, there were 8 CQs in total that were systematically
reviewed. All 3 CQs of the Cholesterol Panel evaluated evidence from RCTs with ASCVD outcomes. CQ1 and CQ2 evaluated the evidence for LDL-C and non– HDL-C
goals in secondary and primary prevention. CQ3 was a comprehensive evaluation of the reduction in ASCVD events and safety for each of the cholesterol-loweringdrugs available in the [LOCATION_002].
/C15The systematic review of evidence from the highest-quality RCTs with ASCVD outcomes identi ﬁed strong evidence to indicate who
should get which therapy at what
intensity .
/C15The statin RCTs provided the most extensive evidence for the greatest magnitude of ASCVD event reduction, with the best margin of safety.
/C15Four statin bene ﬁt groups were identi ﬁed, in which the potential for an ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁt clearly exceeds the potential for adverse effects in:
1. Individuals with clinical ASCVD2. Individuals with primary elevations of LDL-C /C21190 mg/dL
3. Individuals 40 –75 years of age with diabetes but without clinical ASCVD and LDL-C 70 –189 mg/dL
4. Individuals 40 –75 years of age without diabetes or clinical ASCVD with LDL-C 70 –189 mg/dL and an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of 7.5% or higher.
This requires a clinician-patient discussion.
/C15Because few trials have been performed with nonstatin cholesterol-lowering drugs in the statin era, and those that have been performed were unable to
demonstrate signi ﬁcant additional ASCVD event reductions in the RCT populations studied, there was less evidence to support the use of nonstatin drugs for
ASCVD prevention.
/C15It is dif ﬁcult to determine how observational data could override the conclusions from the extensive body of evidence from the statin RCTs and the paucity of
evidence from nonstatin RCTs. Inherent biases of observational data are well understood and include biases in the decisions on whom to treat and who is adherent
to therapy, as well as multiple measurement biases, including veri ﬁcation of statin use, type and dose of statin used, consistency of use over time, and outcome
ascertainment. All of these problems are addressed in intent-to-treat analyses of RCTs, which is why the FDA requires well-designed RCTs to determine drug ef ﬁcacy
for ASCVD event reduction and common adverse effects.
/C15Other approaches to treatment of blood cholesterol have been advocated, including:
A. Treat to target dThis strategy has been the most widely used in the past [ADDRESS_755750], this strategy does not take into account potential adverse effects from statin monotherapy or from multidrug therapy that might be neededto achieve a speci ﬁc goal. Thus, in the absence of these data, this approach is less useful than it appears ( Section 3 ). It is possible that future clinical trials may
provide information warranting reconsideration of this strategy.
B. Lowest is best dThis approach was not taken because it does not consider the potential adverse effects of multidrug therapy with an unknown magnitude of
ASCVD event reduction. Ongoing RCTs of new LDL-C –lowering drugs in the setting of maximal statin therapy may address this question.
C. Treat level of ASCVD risk dA modiﬁ ed version of this approach was taken, which considers both the ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁts and the adverse effects of
statin treatment on the basis of an extensive body of RCT evidence to determine the [ADDRESS_755751] strategies. There are also important exceptions for routine initiation of statin treatment for
individuals requiring hemodialysis or with NYHA class II to IV heart failure.
D. Lifetime risk dTreatment strategies based on lifetime ASCVD risk are problematic because of the lack of data on the long-term follow-up of RCTs >15 years, the
safety and ASCVD event reduction when statins are used for periods >10 years, and treatment of individuals <40 years of age.
A New Perspective on LDL-C and/or Non –HDL-C Goals
/C15The dif ﬁculty of giving up the treat-to-goal paradigm was deliberated extensively over a 3-year period. Many clinicians use targets such as LDL-C <70 mg/dL and
LDL-C<100 mg/dL for secondary and primary ASCVD prevention (non –HDL-C targets are 30 mg/dL higher). However, the RCT evidence clearly shows that ASCVD
events are reduced by [CONTACT_575885]-tolerated statin intensity in those groups shown to bene ﬁt. After a comprehensive review, no RCTs were identiﬁ ed that
titrated drug therapy to speci ﬁc LDL-C or non –HDL-C goals to improve ASCVD outcomes. However, one RCT was identiﬁ ed that showed no additional ASCVD event
reduction from the addition of nonstatin therapy to further treat non –HDL-C levels once an LDL-C goal was reached. In AIM-HIGH (9), the additional reduction in non –
HDL-C levels [as well as additional reductions in Apo B, Lp(a), and triglycerides in addition to HDL-C increases] with niacin therapy DID NOT further reduce ASCVD risk
in individuals treated to LDL-C levels of 40 –80 mg/dL.
/C15Use of LDL-C targets may result in under treatment with evidence-based statin therapy or overtreatment with nonstatin drugs that have not been shown to reduce
ASCVD events in RCTs (even though the drug may additionally lower LDL-C and/or non –HDL-C). Implications of treating to an LDL-C goal may mean that a
suboptimal intensity of statin is used because the goal has been achieved, or that adding a nonstatin therapy to achieve a speci ﬁc target results in down-titration of
the evidence-based intensity of statin for safety reasons. However, when RCT evidence is available that a nonstatin therapy further reduces ASCVD events whenadded to statin therapy, the nonstatin therapy may be considered.
/C15Some examples comparing a strategy based on the 4 statin bene ﬁt groups to a strategy using LDL-C/non –HDL-C targets:
A. Secondary prevention dEvidence supports high-intensity statin therapy for this group to maximally lower LDL-C. It does not support the use of an LDL-C target.
For example, if a secondary-prevention patient achieves an LDL-C of 78 mg/dL on a dose of 80 mg of atorvastatin, he/she is receiving evidence-based therapy.As of yet, there are no data to show that adding nonstatin drug(s) to high-intensity statin therapy will provide incremental ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁt with an
acceptable margin of safety. Indeed, AIM-HIGH (9) demonstrated the futility of adding niacin in individuals with low HDL-C and high triglycerides, and ACCORD
(14) demonstrated the futility of adding fenoﬁ brate in persons with diabetes. Although an ACCORD subgroup analysis of those with high triglycerides and low
HDL-C levels suggested that feno ﬁbrate may reduce ASCVD events in patients with diabetes, this is hypothesis generating and needs further testing in
comparison to the evidence-based use of a high-intensity statin. In addition, not having a goal of <70 mg/dL for LDL-C means that the patient who is adhering to
optimal lifestyle management and receiving a high-intensity statin avoids additional, non –evidence-based therapy just because his/her LDL-C is higher than an
arbitrary cutpoint. Indeed, the LDL-C goal approach can make this patient unnecessarily feel like a failure.

Appendix 5. Continued
B. Familial hypercholesterolemia with LDL-C /C21190 mg/dL dIn many cases, individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia are unable to achieve an LDL-C
goal<100 mg/dL. For example, an individual with familial hypercholesterolemia may achieve an LDL-C of only 120 mg/dL despi[INVESTIGATOR_449567] [ADDRESS_755752] fallen short of the 100-mg/dL goal, he/she has decreased his/her LDL-C by >50% (starting from an untreated
LDL-C level of w325 –400 mg/dL). These patients are not treatment failures, as observational data has shown signi ﬁcant reductions in ASCVD events without
achieving speciﬁ c LDL-C targets. This is an area where observational data supports the recommended approach.
C. Type 2 diabetesd For those 40 –[ADDRESS_755753] lower LDL-C levels than those without diabetes, “goal ”-directed therapy often encourages use of a lower statin dose than is
supported by [CONTACT_575886], and nonstatin drugs may be added to address low HDL-C or high triglycerides, for which RCT evidence of an ASCVD event reduction is
lacking. Giving a maximally tolerated statin intensity should receive primary emphasis because it most accurately re ﬂects the data that statins reduce the
relative risk of ASCVD events similarly in individuals with and without diabetes, and in primary and secondary prevention in those with diabetes, along withevidence that high-intensity statins reduce ASCVD events more than moderate-intensity statins.
D. Estimated 10-year ASCVD risk ‡7.5%dData have shown that statins used for primary prevention have substantial ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁts across the
range of LDL-C levels of 70 –189 mg/dL. Moreover, the Cochrane meta-analysis (15), as well as a meta-analysis by [CONTACT_575887] (13),
conﬁrms that primary prevention with statins reduces total mortality as well as nonfatal ASCVD events.
/C15RCTs are used to identify those who are unlikely to bene ﬁt from initiation of statin therapy despi[INVESTIGATOR_575603], such as those with higher NYHA classes
of heart failure or those on hemodialysis.
Global Risk Assessment for Primary Prevention
/C15Use of the new Pooled Cohort Equations is recommended to estimate 10-year ASCVD risk in both white and black men and women who do not have clinical ASCVD.
/C15By [CONTACT_575888]-risk individuals for statin therapy, the guideline focuses statin therapy on those most likely to bene ﬁt.
/C15It also indicates, on the basis of RCT data, those high-risk groups that might not bene ﬁt. The Expert Panel emphasizes that the guideline is “patient centered ”in
primary prevention. It is recommended that the potential for an ASCVD risk-reduction bene ﬁts, adverse effects, and drug– drug interactions, along with patient
preferences, must be considered before statins are initiated for the primary prevention of ASCVD. Other factors such as LDL-C /C21160 mg/dL may also be considered.
This gives clinicians and patients the opportunity for input into treatment decisions rather than a simplistic “one-treatment- ﬁts-all ”approach to drug therapy.
/C15These guidelines are not a replacement for clinical judgment; they are meant to guide and inform decision making.
/C15Some worry that a person 70 years of age without other risk factors will receive statin treatment on the basis of age alone. The estimated 10-year risk is still /C217.5%,
a risk threshold for which a reduction in ASCVD risk events has been demonstrated in RCTs. Most ASCVD events occur after age 70 years, giving individuals /C2170
years of age the greatest potential for absolute risk reduction.
/C15Some have proposed using selected inclusion criteria from RCTs to determine the threshold for statin initiation. However, the Cholesterol Treatment Trialistsindividual-level meta-analysis showed that statin therapy reduces ASCVD events regardless of categorical risk factors in both primary and secondary prevention.Therefore, the rationale for using ﬁxed cutpoints to determine whether statin therapy should be initiated is refuted by a consideration of the total body of evidence
from RCTs.
/C15In addition, a trial-based strategy identi ﬁes those at increased ASCVD risk less accurately than does a strategy based on an assessment of global ASCVD risk. This
selective use of inclusion criteria excludes well-established risk factors, such as smoking and advancing age (the strongest risk factor because it representscumulative risk factor exposure).
/C15The poor discrimination of RCT inclusion criteria for identifying those at increased 10-year ASCVD risk is shown by a calculation performed by [CONTACT_575889]. Use of the RCT inclusion criteria (from RCTs that found a reduction in ASCVD events to guideinitiation of statin therapy) would result in the treatment of 16% of individuals with <2.5% estimated 10-year ASCVD risk and 45% of those with 2.5% to <5%
estimated 10-year ASCVD risk (many would say inappropriately), whereas 38% of those with /C217.5% 10-year ASCVD risk would not have been identi ﬁed as
candidates for statin therapy.
Safety
/C15RCTs are used to identify important safety considerations in individuals receiving treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce ASCVD risk and to determine statinadverse effects to facilitate understanding of the net bene ﬁt from statin therapy.
/C15Safety issues that are uncommon or unlikely to be seen in the populations studied in RCTs require more than analyses of single RCTs. This limitation was overcome,in part, by [CONTACT_575890]-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses of statin RCTs.
/C15Expert guidance is provided on management of statin-associated adverse effects, including muscle symptoms.
/C15This guideline emphasizes the importance of using additional sources of information on safety, including FDA reports, manufacturers ’prescribing information, and
pharmacists, to aid in the safe use of cholesterol-lowering drug therapy.
Role of Biomarkers and Noninvasive Tests
/C15There is a concern about other factors that may indicate elevated ASCVD risk but were not included in the Pooled Cohort Equations for predicting 10-year ASCVDrisk.
/C15The Risk Assessment Work Group has performed an updated systematic review of nontraditional risk factors, such as CAC, and has included recommendations toconsider their use to the extent that the evidence allows.
/C15In selected individuals who are not in 1 of the 4 statin bene ﬁt groups, and for whom a decision to initiate statin therapy is otherwise unclear, additional factors may
be considered to inform treatment decision making.
/C15These factors include primary LDL-C /C21160 mg/dL or other evidence of genetic hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_125270]; family history of premature ASCVD with onset <[ADDRESS_755754]-degree male relative or <[ADDRESS_755755]-degree female relative; high-sensitivity C-reactive protein /C212 mg/L; CAC score /C21300 Agatston units or /C2175th
percentile for age, sex, and ethnicity; ankle-brachial index <0.9; and elevated lifetime risk of ASCVD. Additional factors may be identi ﬁed in the future.

Future Updates to the Blood Cholesterol Guideline
/C15This guideline focuses on treatments proven to reduce ASCVD events. It is not and was never intended to be a comprehensive approach to lipid management.
/C15Using RCT evidence assessed for quality provides a strong foundation for treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce ASCVD risk that can be used now. There are many
clinical questions for which there is an absence of RCT data available to develop high-quality, evidence-based recommendations. For these questions, expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_575604].
/C15CQs for future guidelines could examine:
1. the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia;2. the use of non –HDL-C in treatment decision making;

Confidential and Proprietary  APPENDIX B.  GUIDANCE FOR ELEVATE D LIVER BIOCHEMISTRY  
VALUES  
For subjects who progress to cirrhosis and decompensation while participating in the study, 
elevation in liver biochemistry and development of other laboratory and clinical abnormalities 
may be expected.  Clinical adverse events  (AEs) should be reported and recorded as described in 
Section 12.1.[ADDRESS_755756] use and 
study participation as des cribed in Section 8.4. 
However, if these abnormalities are not consistent with the pattern of change attributable to 
disease progression (as assessed  by [CONTACT_737]) and no other cause is readily apparent 
(eg, acute biliary obstruction caused by [CONTACT_575891]), further actions are 
appropriate as outlined below.  The Sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_575892]. 
Per guidance from the FDA ( FDA 2009) , subjects with normal ALT/AST a nd bilirubin at 
baseline, an increase in ALT/AST to >3× ULN or total bilirubin >2× ULN should be followed by 
[CONTACT_94525] [ADDRESS_755757] or repeat testing shows ALT/AST >3× ULN or total bilirubin >2× ULN, subjects should be closely monitored.  In 
subjects with abnormal ALT/AST or bilirubin at baseline, fold increase should be assessed against baseline levels instead of ULN as follows:  3× baseline ALT/AST, or total bilirubin 
>2× baseline (and >2 mg/dL).  In subjects with abnormal values at baseline who develop a nadir 
value during the study, the reference points noted above should be changed from baseline to the 
nadir value for subsequent assessments. 
In subjects who are far from their study site, it may be difficult for the subjects to return to the 
site promptly.  In this case, the subjects should be retested locally, but normal laboratory ranges should be recorded, results should be made available to the Investigator immediately, and the 
data should be included in the case reports.  If symptoms persist or repeat testing shows 
persistent abnormality as described above, it is appropriate to initiate close observation (defined below) to determine whether the abnormalities are improving or worsening.  
If close observation is not possible, investigational product should be interrupted until further 
investigation can be performed. 
Close observation may include:  
• Repeating liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests [ADDRESS_755758] is asymptomatic.  
• Obtaining a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  
• Obtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications 
and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, 
and special diets.  
• Ruling out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic 
hepatitis; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and other biliary tract disease.  
Page 165 of 364
Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  19 Dec 2016   
Page 166 
 
Confidential and Proprietary  • Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
• Obtaining additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (eg, INR, direct 
bilirubin).  
Discontinuation of treat ment should be considered if the following abnormality or group of 
abnormalities occur (in subjects with baseline values within the normal range):  
• ALT or AST >8 × ULN  
• ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks  
• ALT or AST >3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN or INR >1.5)  
• ALT or AST >3 × ULN with the appearance of new onset fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%)  
In subjects with abnormal baseline values, the reference point should be changed from ULN to 
baseline.  In subjects with abnormal values at baseline who develop a nadir value during the 
study, the reference points noted above should be changed from ULN or baseline to the nadir 
value for subsequent assessments.  Baseline is defined as t he average of all on -study, predose 
values (including Screening Visit and Day 1).  A nadir value is defined as the average of at least 
[ADDRESS_755759] value, regardless of when it occurs 
(ie, on or off treatment).  Repeat and unscheduled visits will be included in the determination of the nadir value.  A new nadir value may develop over the course of the study if liver biochemistries improve over time.

† CTCAE v4.0 incorporates certain elements of the MedDRA terminology. For further details on MedDRA refer to the MedDRA MSSO Web site ( http://www.meddramsso.com ). Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE) 
Publish Date: May 28, 2009
Quick Reference  
The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events is a descriptive terminology which 
can be utilized for Adverse Event (AE) reporting.  
A grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE 
term. 
Components and Organization  
SOC 
System Organ Class, the highest level of the 
MedDRA hierarchy, is identified by [CONTACT_575893], etiology, or purpose (e.g., 
SOC Investigations for laboratory test results).  
CTCAE terms are grouped by [CONTACT_575894]. Within each SOC, AEs are listed and 
accompanied by [CONTACT_75494] (Grade). 
CTCAE Terms  
An Adverse Event (AE) is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medical 
treatment or procedure that may or may not be 
considered related to the medical treatment or 
procedure.  An AE is a term that is a unique 
representation of a specific event used for 
medical documentation and scientific analyses.  
Each CTCAE v4.0 term is a MedDRA LLT (Lowest 
Level Term). 
 Definitions 
A brief definition is provided to clarify the 
meaning of each AE term. 
Grades 
Grade refers to the severity of the AE.  The CTCAE 
displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical 
descriptions of severity for each AE based on this 
general guideline: 
 Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild 
symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not 
indicated. 
 Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or 
noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age-appropriate 
instrumental ADL*. 
 Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but 
not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24599]; disabling; 
limiting self care ADL**. 
 Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; 
urgent intervention indicated. 
 Grade 5 Death related to AE. 
A Semi-colon indicates ‘or’ within the description 
of the grade. 
A single dash (-) indicates a grade is not available. Not all Grades are appropriate for all AEs. 
Therefore, some AEs are listed with fewer than 
five options for Grade selection. 
Grade 5 
Grade 5 (Death) is not appropriate for some AEs 
and therefore is not an option. 
Activities of Daily Living (ADL) 
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the 
telephone, managing money, etc. 
**Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden. Page 169 of 364

Event Definitions  
Cardiovascular (CV) Death:  
Death due to Acute MI  Death due to Acute MI refers to a death by [CONTACT_576320] (eg, arrhythmia, sudden death, HF, stroke, 
pulmonary embolus, peripheral arterial disease) ≤30 daysa after a MI related to the immediate consequences of 
the MI, such as progressive HF or recalcitrant arrhythmia.  There may be assessable mechanisms of CV death 
during this time period, but for simplicity, if the CV death occurs ≤30 days of the MI, it will be considered a 
death due to MI.  
Acute MI should be verified to the extent possible by [CONTACT_576321] (Clinical Data 
Interchange Standards Consortium [CDISC], Chapter 4) or by [CONTACT_576322].  
Death resulting from a procedure to treat a MI (percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery by[CONTACT_10956] [CABG]), or to treat a complication resulting from MI, should also be considered death due 
to acute MI.  
Death resulting from an elective coronary procedure to treat myocardial ischemia (ie, chronic stable angina) or death due to a MI that occurs as  a direct consequence of a CV investigation/procedure/operation should be 
considered as a death due to a CV procedure.

Confidential and Proprietary  Event Definitions  
Sudden Cardiac Death  Sudden Cardiac Death refers to a death that occurs unexpectedly, not following an acute MI, and includes the 
following deaths:  
a. Death witnessed  and occurring  without new or worsening  symptoms  
b. Death witnessed  within [ADDRESS_755825] acute MI 
c. Death witnessed  and attributed  to an identified  arrhythmia  (eg, captured on an electrocardiographic 
(ECG) recording,  witnessed  on a monitor, or unwitnessed  but found on implantable  cardioverter -
defibrillator  review) 
d. Death after unsuccessful  resuscitation  from cardiac arrest (eg, implantable  cardioverter  defibrillator  
(ICD) unresponsive  sudden cardiac death, pulseless electrical activity arrest) 
e. Death after successful  resuscitation  from cardiac arrest and without identification  of a specific cardiac or 
non-cardiac etiology 
f. Unwitnessed  death in a subject seen alive and clinically stable ≤24 hours prior to being found  dead 
without any evidence supporting  a specific non-CV cause of death (information  regarding the subject’s 
clinical status preceding  death should be provided,  if available). 
Unless additional information suggests an alternate specific cause of death (eg, death due to Other CV Causes), 
if a subject is seen alive ≤ 24 hours of being found dead, sudden cardiac death (criterion f above) should be recorded.  For subjects who were not observed alive within 24 hours of death, undetermined cause of death 
should be recorded (eg, a subject found dead in bed, but who had not been seen by [CONTACT_576323]).  
Death due to HF  Death due to HF refers to a death in association with clinically worsening s ymptoms and/or signs of HF 
regardless of HF etiology (CDISC, Chapter 7).  Deaths due to HF can have various etiologies, including single 
or recurrent MIs, ischemic or non -ischemic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, or valvular disease.  
Death due to Stroke  Death due to Stroke refers to death after a stroke (hemorrhagic, ischemic, or undetermined) that is either a direct 
consequence of the stroke or a complication of the stroke.  Acute stroke should be verified to the extent possible 
by [CONTACT_576324] (CDISC, Chapter 6).  
Death due to CV Procedures  Death due to CV Procedures refers to death caused by [CONTACT_576325] a cardiac procedure.  
Death due to CV Hemorrhage  Death due to CV Hemorrhage refers to death related to hemorrhage such as a non -stroke intracranial 
hemorrhage (CDISC, Chapter 6), non -procedural or non -traumatic vascular rupture (eg, aortic aneurysm), or 
hemorrhage causing cardiac tamponade.  
Death due to Other CV Causes  Death due to Other CV Causes refers to a CV death not included in the above categories but with a specific, known cause (eg, pulmonary embolism or peripheral arterial disease).

Undetermined Cause of Death:  
Undetermined Cause of Death (will 
be classified as a CV death)  Undetermined cause of death refers to a death not attributable to one of the above categories of CV death or is 
due to a non -CV cause.  Inability to classify the cause of death may be due to lack of information (eg, the only 
available information is “subject died”) or there is insufficient supporting information or detail to assign the 
cause of death.  In general, most deaths should be classifiable as CV or non -CV, and the use of this category of 
death, therefore, should be discouraged and should apply to f ew subjects in well -run clinical trials.    
Cardiovascular Events:  
Myocardial Infarctionb a) Clinical Presentation  
The clinical presentation should be consistent with diagnosis of myocardial ischemia and infarction.  Other 
findings that might support the diagnosis of MI should be taken into account because a number of conditions are 
associated with elevations in cardiac biomarkers (eg, trauma, surgery, pacing, ablation, HF, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, severe pulmonary hypertension, str oke or subarachnoid hemorrhage, 
infiltrative and inflammatory disorders of cardiac muscle, drug toxicity, burns, critical illness, extreme exertion, and chronic kidney disease).  
Supporting information can also be considered from myocardial imaging and coronary imaging.  The totality of the data may help differentiate acute MI from the background disease process.  
b) Biomarker Elevations  
For cardiac biomarkers, laboratories should report an upper reference limit (URL).  If the ninety -ninth percentile 
of the URL from the respective laboratory performing the assay is not available, then the URL for myocardial 
necrosis from the laboratory should be used.  If the ninety -ninth percentile of the URL or the URL for 
myocardial necrosis is not available, the MI decision limit for the particular laboratory should be used as the URL.  Laboratories can also report both the ninety -ninth percentile of the upper reference limit and the MI 
decision limit.  Reference limits from the laboratory performing the assay are preferred over the manufacturer’s 
listed reference limits in an assay’s instructions for use.  In general, troponins are preferred.  Creatine kinase -
myocardial band (CK -MB) should be used if troponins are not available, and total creatine kinase (CK) may be 
used in the absence of CK -MB and troponin.  
For MI subtypes, different biomarker elevations for CK, CK -MB, or troponin will be required.  The specific 
criteria will be referenced to the URL.  
Since it is not practical to stipulate the use of a single biomarker or assa y, the locally available results are to be 
used as the basis for adjudication.  However, if possible, using the same cardiac biomarker assay and preferably, 
a core laboratory, for all measurements reduces inter -assay variability.  
Since the prognostic signi ficance of different types of MIs (eg, periprocedural MI versus spontaneous MI) may 
be different, outcomes for these subsets of subjects may be evaluated separately.

Confidential and Proprietary  Event Definitions  
c) ECG Changes  
Electrocardiographic changes can be used to support or confirm a MI. Supporting evidence may be ischemic 
changes and confirmatory information may be new Q waves.  
ECG manifestations of acute myocardial ischemia (in absence of left ventricular hypertrophy [LVH] and left 
bundle branch block [LBBB]) include:  
• ST elevation: New S T elevation at the J point in two contiguous leads with the cut -points: ≥0.1 mV in 
all leads other than leads V2 -V3 where the following cut -points apply: ≥0.2 mV in men ≥40 years 
(≥0.25 mV in men <40 years) or ≥0.15 mV in women 
• ST depression and T -wave cha nges: New horizontal or down -slopi[INVESTIGATOR_345482] ≥0.05  mV in two 
contiguous leads and/or new T inversion ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_755826] or R/S ratio >1.  
The above ECG criteria illustrate patterns consistent with myocardial ischemia.  In subjects with abnormal 
biomarkers, it is recognized that lesser ECG abnormalities may represent an ischemic response and may be 
accepted under the category of abnormal ECG findings.  
• Criteria for pathological Q -wave 
− Any Q-wave in leads V2 -V3 ≥0.02 seconds or QS complex in leads V2 and V3 
− Q-wave ≥0.03 seconds and ≥0.1 mV deep or QS complex in leads I, II, aVL, aVF, or V4 -V6 in 
any two leads of a contiguous lead groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (I, aVL; V1- V6; II, III, and aVF)c 
• ECG changes associated with prior MI  
− Pathologi cal Q-waves, as defined above 
− R-wave ≥0.04 seconds in V1 -V2 and R/S ≥[ADDRESS_755827]  
• Criteria for prior MI:  Any one of the following criteria meets the diagnosis for prior MI: 
− Pathological Q waves with or without symptoms in the absence of non -ischemic causes  
− Imaging evidence of a region of loss of viable myocardium that is thinned and fails to contract, in 
the absence of a non -ischemic cause

Stroke Disability:  Disability should be measured by a reliable and valid scale in all cases, typi[INVESTIGATOR_256818] 90 days after the event.  For example, the modified Rankin Scale may be used to address this requirement:  
Scale Disability  
0 No symptoms  at all 
1 No significant  disability despi[INVESTIGATOR_5119];  able to carry out all usual duties and activities  
2 Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities,  but able to look after own  affairs 
without assistance  
3 Moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance  
4 Moderately  severe disability; unable to walk without assistance  and unable to attend to 
own bodily needs without assistance  
5 Severe disability;  bedridden,  incontinent  and requiring constant nursing care and attention

Interventional Cardiology:  Clinical Definitions  
Clinically -Driven Target Lesion 
Revascularization:  Revascularization is clinically -driven if the target lesion diameter stenosis is >50% by [CONTACT_576326] (QCA) and the subject has clinical or functional ischemia which cannot be explained by [CONTACT_576327]. Clinical or functional ischemia includes any  of the following:  
a. A history of angina pectoris, presumably related to the target  vessel 
b. Objective signs of ischemia at rest (electrocardiographic changes) or during exercise test (or equivalent), presumably related to the target vessel  
c. Abnormal results of  any invasive functional diagnostic test [e.g., coronary  flow reserve (CFR) or 
fractional flow reserve (FFR)]  
Comment :  Target lesion revascularization of a >70% diameter stenosis by [CONTACT_576328]-driven. 
Comment :  In the absence of QCA data or if a ≤50% stenosis is present, TLR may  be considered clinically -
driven by [CONTACT_350952] (AC) if severe ischemic signs and symptoms attributed to the target lesion are present.  
Non-Target Lesion and Non -Target 
Lesion Revascularization:  A lesion for which revascularization is not attempted or one in which revascularization is performed using a non-study device, respectively. 
Non-Target Vessel and Non -Target 
Vessel Revascularization:  A vessel for which revascularization is not attempted or one in which revascularization is performed using a 
non-study device, respectively. 
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) Status: a. Elective: The procedure can be performed on an outpatient basis or durin g a subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_575718].  For stable inpatients, the procedure is being performed during this hospi[INVESTIGATOR_575719]'s clinical situation 
demands the  procedure prior to discharge.  
b. Urgent: The procedure should be performed on an inpatient basis and prior  to discharge because of 
significant concerns that there is risk of myocardial ischemia, MI, and/or death.  Subjects who are 
outpatients or in the emergency department at the time that the cardiac catheterization is requested would 
warrant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_575720].  
c. Emergency:  The procedure should be performed as soon as possible because of substantial concerns that 
ongoing myocardial ischemia and/or MI could lead to death.  "As soon as possible" refers to a subject who 
is of sufficient acuity that one would cancel a scheduled case to perform this procedure immediately in the next available room during business hours, or  one would activate the on -call team were this to occur 
during off -hours.

d. Salvage:  The procedure is a last resort. The subject is in cardiogenic shock when the PCI begins (ie, the 
time at which the first guide wire or intracoronary device is introduced in to a coronary artery or by[CONTACT_576329]) OR within the last ten minutes prior to the start of 
the case or during the diagnostic portion of the case, the subject has also received chest compressions or 
has been o n unanticipated circulatory support (eg, intra -aortic balloon pump, extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation, or cardiopulmonary support).  
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI): Placement of an angioplasty guide wire, balloon, or other device (e.g., stent, atherectomy catheter, 
brachytherapy delivery device, or thrombectomy catheter) into a native coronary artery or coronary artery by[CONTACT_576330].  In the assessment of the severity of coronary lesions wi th the use of intravascular ultrasound, coronary flow reserve (CFR), or fractional flow 
reserve (FFR), insertion of a guide wire will NOT be considered PCI.  
Procedural Success:  Achievement of <30 % residual diameter stenosis of the target lesion assessed by [CONTACT_576331]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_478125] (MACE, a composite of death, MI, or repeat coronary 
revascularization of the target lesion).  Ideally, the assessment of the residual stenosis at the end of the procedure should be  performed by [CONTACT_256911].  
Comment: For some device interventions (eg, balloon angioplasty), achievement of <50% diameter stenosis 
by [CONTACT_576332].  
Target Lesion:  Any lesion treated or attempted to be treated during the PCI with the study device.  The target lesion includes 
the arterial segment treated with the study device (stent, in most cases) plus 5 mm proximal and 5 mm distal to the treatment site.  
Target Lesion Failure (TLF):  The composite of ischemia -driven revascularization of the target lesion, MI related to the target vessel, or 
cardiac death related to the target vessel.  If it cannot be determined with certainty whether the MI or death was related to the tar get vessel, it is considered a TLF. 
Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR): Any repeat percutaneous intervention of the target lesion (including 5 mm proximal and 5 mm distal to the target lesion) or surgical by[CONTACT_576333].  In the assessment of TLR, angiograms should be assessed by [CONTACT_256911] 
(if designated) and made available to the AC for review upon request.  
Target Vessel:  A major native coronary artery (eg, left main coronary artery, left anterior descending coronary artery, left circumflex coronary artery, or right coronary artery) or by[CONTACT_256914].  A native coronary artery target vessel includes the arterial segments upstream and downstream to the target lesion plus major side branches. 
Target Vessel Failure (TVF):  The composite of ischemia -driven revascularization of the target vessel, MI related to the target vessel, or 
cardiac death related to the target vessel.  If it cannot be determined with certainty whether the MI or death was 
related to the target vessel, it is considered a TVF.

Vascular Complications : • Access site hematoma :  Development of a new, localized collection of blood at a vascular access site 
sufficient to produ ce a palpable mass within 72  hours of a procedure.  
• Arteriovenous fistula: Development of a new, unintended communication between an artery and a vein occurring at a vascular access site within 72  hours of a procedure.  
• Peripheral ischemia:  Development of new arterial insufficiency sufficient to produce clinical signs or 
symptoms of ischemia (pallor, pain, paresthesia) distal to a vascular access site within 72 hours of a procedure. 
• Peripheral nerve injury:  Development of new sensory or motor loss of periph eral nerve function 
from external nerve compression (e.g., as a result of positioning during a procedure), or internal 
compression or direct nerve damage from the procedure, occurring within 72 hours of a procedure.  
• Pseudoaneurysm:  Development of a new lo calized collection of blood with a persistent 
communication (neck) originating at a vascular access site and occurring within 72h of a procedure.  
• Retroperitoneal hemorrhage:  Development of new bleeding into the retroperitoneal space 
originating at a vascular access site and occurring within 72 hours of a procedure.  
Interventional Cardiology:  Angiographic Definitions  
Abrupt Closure : New intra -procedural severely reduced flow (TIMI grade 0 -1) within the target vessel that persists and requires 
intervention by [CONTACT_13774], or results in MI or death. Abrupt closure requires an association with a vascular dissection, thrombus, or severe spasm at the treatment site or within the instrumented vessel.

Confidential and Proprietary  Event Definitions  
Late Loss:  Minimum lumen diameter (MLD) assessed at follow -up angiography minus the MLD assessed immediately 
after the index procedure.  MLDs are measured by [CONTACT_13775].  
Minimum Lumen Diameter (MLD):  The mean minimum lumen diameter (typi[INVESTIGATOR_575721] -lesion, in-stent, and in-segment) derived from two 
orthogonal views by [CONTACT_13775].  
No Reflow:  An acute reduction in coronary flow (TIMI grade 0 -1) in the absence of dissection, thrombus, spasm, or high -
grade residual stenosis at the original target lesion.  
Percent Diameter Sten osis (% DS):  The value calculated as 100 x (1 – MLD/RVD) using the mean values determined by [CONTACT_576334] (when possible).  
Reference Vessel Diameter (RVD): Defined as the average of normal segments within 10 mm proximal and 10 mm distal t o the target lesion from 
two orthogonal views using QCA.  
Restenosis:  Re-narrowing of the vessel following the treatment of a prior stenosis  
• Binary restenosis: A diameter stenosis of > 50% at the previously treated lesion site, including the 
originally treated site plus the adjacent vascular segments 5 mm proximal and 5 mm distal to the site.  
• In-stent restenosis (ISR): A previously stented lesion with a > 50% diameter  stenosis. 
Thrombus (Angiographic):  A discrete, mobile, intraluminal filling defect wit h defined borders with or without associated contrast staining.  
TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial 
Infarction) Flow Grades:  • Grade 0 (no perfusion): There is no antegrade flow beyond the point of occlusion.  
• Grade 1 (penetration without perfusion): The contra st material passes beyond the area of 
obstruction but “hangs up” and fails to opacify the entire coronary bed distal to the obstruction for the duration of the cineangiographic filming sequence.  
• Grade 2 (partial perfusion): The contrast material passes across the obstruction and opacifies the 
coronary bed distal to the obstruction. However, the rate of entry of contrast material into the vessel distal to the obstruction or its rate of clearance from the distal bed (or both) is perceptibly slower than its entry into or clearance from comparable areas not perfused by [CONTACT_256917] (eg, 
the opposite coronary artery or the coronary bed proximal to the obstruction).  
• Grade 3 (complete perfusion): Antegrade flow into the bed distal to the obstruction occurs as 
promptly as antegrade flow into the bed proximal to the obstruction and clearance of contrast material from the involved bed is as rapid as from an uninvolved bed in the same vessel or the opposite artery.  
Vessels • Left main coronary artery (LMCA)

Peripheral Vascular Intervention  
Peripheral Vascular Intervention 
(PVI): Peripheral vascular interventiond is a catheter based or open surgical procedure designed to improve arterial or 
venous blood flow or otherwise modify or revise vascular conduits. Procedures may include, but are not limited to, percutaneous transluminal balloon angio plasty, stent placement, thrombectomy, embolectomy, atherectomy, 
dissection repair, aneurysm exclusion, treatment of dialysis conduits, placement of various devices, intravascular thrombolysis or other pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and open surgical by[CONTACT_576335].  
In general, the intention to perform percutaneous peripheral vascular intervention is denoted by [CONTACT_434338] 
a guide wire into a peripheral artery or vein.  
The target vessel(s) and the type of revascularization procedure (e.g., surgical by[CONTACT_6476], thr ombectomy, 
endarterectomy, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, stent placement, thromboembolectomy, and thrombolysis) should be specified and recorded. For the sake of simplicity, this definition applies to the extracranial carotid artery and other non -cardiac arteries and veins and excludes the intracranial vessels and 
lymphatics.  
Procedural Success:  In the case of percutaneous intervention for obstructive lesions, procedural success is defined as the achievement of a satisfactory final residual diameter stenosis by [CONTACT_576336] (and without flow limiting dissection or hemodynamically significant translesional pressure gradient). The specific parameter for final percent residual stenosis is typi[INVESTIGATOR_32270] <30% and <50%; selection of the appropriate percentage may vary depending upon the specific intervention applied, the vascular territory, and anticipated or desired therapeutic response.  Procedural success also implies absence of in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_575722] (eg, 
death, stroke, myocardial infarction, acute onset of limb ischemia, need for urgent/emergent vascular surgery, 
and other procedure -specific major adverse events).  The balloon inflation, stent placement, or other therapeutic 
intervention may be preceded by [CONTACT_576337] (eg, percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy, directional or rotational atherectomy, laser, and chronic total occlusion crossing device), as predefined in the protocol.

Confidential and Proprietary  Event Definitions  
Procedural Status: Non- Elective and 
Elective: e. Non-Elective: Non -elective procedures include emergent and urgent procedures.  A non elective 
procedure is a procedure that is performed without delay, because there is clinical consensus that the 
procedure should occur imminently. Non- elective procedures imply a degree of instability of the subject, 
urgency of the medical condition, or instability of the threatening lesion.  
− Emergent: A procedure that is performed immediately because of the acute nature of the 
medical condition (e.g., acute limb ischemia, acute aortic dissection), and the increased morbidity or mortality associated with a temporal delay in treatment.  
− Urgent: An urgent procedure is one that is not an emergency but is required to be performed on a timely basis (≤24 hrs) (e.g., a subject who has been stabilized following initial treatment 
of acute limb ischemia, and there is clinical consensus that a definitive procedure should 
occur within the next 24 hours).  
f. Elective: An elective procedure is one that is scheduled and is performed on a subject with s table 
disease, or in whom there is no urgency and/or increased morbidity or mortality associated with a planned procedure.  
Target Lesion:  A target lesion is any vascular segment treated or attempted to be treated during the trial procedure with the 
index device. The target lesion is the treated segment starting 10 mm proximal and ending 10  mm distal to the 
index device or therapy (stent, balloon, atherectomy catheter, or aortic stent -graft). 
Target Vessel : A target vessel is any vessel (eg, non -cardiac or non-intracranial) that contains the target lesion treated with the 
study device. The target vessel includes the target lesion as well as the entire length of native vessel upstream 
and downstream from the target lesion, including side branches. For the arteries of the leg, the vasculature is divided into 3 vessel “levels:” aorto -iliac, femoral -popliteal, and tibial- crural. 
Non-Target Lesion and Non -Target 
Lesion Revascularization:  A lesion for which revascularization is not attempted or one in which reva scularization is performed using a 
non-study device, respectively. 
Non-Target Vessel and Non -Target 
Vessel Revascularization : A vessel for which revascularization is not attempted or one in which revascularization is performed using a 
non-study device, respectively.  
Target Vessel, Non -Target Lesion 
and Target Vessel, Non -Target 
Lesion Revascularization:  Any lesion or revascularization of a lesion in the target vessel other than the target lesion, respectively.  
Target Lesion Revascularization 
(TLR): Target lesion revascularization is any repeat intervention of the target lesion (including 10 mm proximal and 
10 mm distal to the index device, as target lesion is defined above) or surgical intervention/by[CONTACT_576338]. In the assessment of TLR, 
angiograms should be assessed by [CONTACT_256911] (if designated).  Angiograms (and core 
laboratory assessment thereof) and other source documentation should be made available to the CEC for 
review upon request.

(TVR): Target vessel revascularization is any repeat intervention or surgical by[CONTACT_256915]. In the assessment of TVR, angiograms should be assessed  by [CONTACT_256911] (if designated).  
Angiograms (and core laboratory assessment thereof) and other source documentation should be made 
available to the CEC for review upon request.  
Clinically -Driven Target Lesion 
Revascularization:  Clinically -driven target lesion revascularization is defined as target lesion revascularization performed due to 
target lesion diameter stenosis >50% AND either evidence of clinical or functional ischemia (eg, 
recurrent/progressive intermittent claudication, cri tical limb ischemia) OR recurrence of the clinical syndrome 
for which the initial procedure was performed.  Clinically -driven target lesion revascularization occurs in the 
absence of protocol -directed surveillance ultrasound or angiography.  
Vessel Patency : Vessel patency at a given time point will be determined by [CONTACT_576339] -driven target lesion 
revascularization and/or absence of recurrent target lesion diameter stenosis >50% by [CONTACT_9661] (eg, invasive angiography or most commonly, duplex ult rasonography). If patency data are incorporated within the primary 
endpoint of a clinical trial, the angiographic images or duplex ultrasonographic images should be assessed by 
[CONTACT_576340]. 
Restenosis:  Re-narrowing of the artery following the treatment of a prior stenosis  
• Binary restenosis: A diameter stenosis of >50% at the previously treated lesion site, including the 
originally treated site plus the adjacent vascular segments 10 mm proximal and 10 mm distal to the site 
(or as otherwise defined by [CONTACT_760], as noted above).  
• In-stent restenosis (ISR): A previously stented lesion that has >50% diameter stenosis.

Stent Thrombosis Categories  1. Definite Stent Thrombosis  
 Definite stent thrombosis is considered to have occurred by [CONTACT_576341]: 
a. Angiographic confirmation  of stent thrombosise 
• The presence of a thrombusf that originates in the stent or in the segment [ADDRESS_755842] 1 of the following criteria within a 48 -hour time window:  
− Acute onset of ischemic symptoms at rest 
− New ischemic ECG changes that suggest acute ischemia  
− Typi[INVESTIGATOR_196543] (refer to definition of spontaneous MI) 
− Nonocclusive thrombus:  Intracoronary thrombus is defined as a (spheric, ovoid, or irregular) 
noncalcified filling  defect or lucency surrounded by [CONTACT_13800] (on 3 sides or within a 
coronary stenosis) seen in multiple projections, or persistence of contrast material within the lumen, or a visible embolization of intraluminal material downstream  
− Occlusive thromb us:  TIMI [ADDRESS_755843] 
adjacent proximal side branch or main branch (if originates from the side branch).

Confidential and Proprietary  Event Definitions  
b. Pathological Confirmation of Stent Thrombosis:  Evidence of recent thrombus within the stent 
determined at autopsy or via examination of tissue retrieved following thrombectomy.  
2. Probable Stent Thrombosis:  Clinical definition of probable stent thrombosis is considered to have 
occurred after intracoronary stenting in the following cases:  
a.Any unexplained death within the first 30 daysg 
b. Irrespective of the time after the index procedure, any MI that is related to documented acute 
ischemia in the territory of the implanted stent without angiographic confirmation of stent thrombosis and in the absence of any other obvious cause  
3. Possible Stent Thrombosis:  Clinical definition of possible stent thrombosis is considered to have 
occurred with any unexplained death from [ADDRESS_755844] lead groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
d Peripheral vascular disease includes veins, arteries, an d lymphatics. However, for simplicity, this definition focuses on peripheral artery and venous 
interventions.  
e The incidental angiographic documentation of stent occlusion in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms is not considered a  confirmed stent th rombosis 
(silent occlusion).  
f Intracoronary thrombus.  
g  For studies with ST -elevation MI population, one may consider the exclusion of unexplained death within 30 days as evidence of probable stent 
thrombosis.

HIGHLIGHTS OF PRESCRIBING INFORMATION
These highlights do not include all the information needed to use atorvastatin calcium tablets safely and effectively. See full prescribing information for atorvastatin calcium tablets.
 Atorvastatin Calcium Tablets for oral administration
 Initial U.S. Approval: 1996
INDICATIONS AND [LOCATION_003]GE
Atorvastatin calcium is an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (statin) indicated as an adjunct therapy to diet to:
Reduce the risk of MI, stroke, revascularization procedures, and angina in patients without CHD, but with multiple risk factors (1.1).
Reduce the risk of MI and stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes without CHD, but with multiple risk factors ( 1.1).
Reduce the risk of non-fatal MI, fatal and non-fatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_245045], and angina in patients with CHD ( 1.1).
Reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG levels and increase HDL-C in adult patients with primary hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (1.2).
Reduce elevated TG in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and primary dysbetalipoproteinemia ( 1.2).
Reduce total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) ( 1.2).
Reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia after failing an adequate trial of diet therapy ( 1.2).
Limitations of UseAtorvastatin calcium tablets have not been studied in Fredrickson
 Types I and V dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_125270].
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Dose range: 10 to 80 mg once daily ( 2.1).
Recommended start dose: 10 or 20 mg once daily ( 2.1).
Patients requiring large LDL-C reduction (>45%) may start at 40 mg once daily ( 2.1).
Pediatric starting dose: 10 mg once daily; maximum recommended dose: 20 mg once daily ( 2.2).
DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS
10, 20, 40, and 80 mg tablets ( 3).
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Active liver disease, which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels ( 4.1).
Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant ( 4.3).
Nursing mothers (4.4).Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication ( 4.2).
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis): Risks increase when higher doses are used concomitantly with cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole,
Page 276 of 356Page 278 of 364
http://labeling.greenstonellc.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=983[10/8/2015 12:57:02 PM] HIV protease inhibitors). Predisposing factors include advanced age
 (> 65), uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Rare
 cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. Advise patients to promptly report to their physician unexplained and/or persistent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. Atorvastatin therapy should be discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected ( 5.1, 8.5).
Liver enzyme abnormalities: Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter ( 5.2).
A higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in patients without CHD but with stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months in the atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg group vs. placebo ( 5.5).
ADVERSE REACTIONS
The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 2%) in
 patients treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets in placebo-controlled trials regardless of causality were: nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, diarrhea, pain in extremity, and urinary tract infection (6.1).
To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact
 [CONTACT_576342] [PHONE_183] or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.
DRUG INTERACTIONS
Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of
 Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis ( 2.6, 5.1, 7, 12.3)
Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations
Cyclosporine, HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir)Avoid atorvastatin
HIV protease inhibitor (lopi[INVESTIGATOR_245049])Use with caution and lowest dose necessary
Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir )Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily
HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir)Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir)Do not exceed 40 mg atorvastatin daily
Other Lipid-Lowering Medications: Use with fibrate products or lipid-modifying doses ( ≥1 g/day) of niacin increases the risk of
 adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with atorvastatin calcium tablets ( 7).
Digoxin: Patients should be monitored appropriately ( 7.8).
Oral Contraceptives: Values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol may be increased ( 7.9).
Rifampin should be simultaneously co-administered with atorvastatin calcium tablets ( 7.7).
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
Hepatic impairment: Plasma concentrations markedly increased in
 patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease ( 12.3).

http://labeling.greenstonellc.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=983[10/8/2015 12:57:02 PM]2.1 Hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (Fredrickson Types IIa
 and IIb)
The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large
 reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of atorvastatin calcium tablets is 10 to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin calcium tablets can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of atorvastatin calcium tablets should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP
 Guidelines). After initiation and/or upon titration of atorvastatin calcium tablets, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.
2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10–17 years of age)
The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets is 10 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20
 mg/day (doses greater than [ADDRESS_755852] not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy [see current  NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines , Clinical
 Pharmacology (12), and Indications and Usage (1.2)
]. Adjustments should be made at intervals of [ADDRESS_755853] to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable.
2.4 Concomitant Lipid-Lowering Therapy
Atorvastatin calcium tablets may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors
 (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution [see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) ,
 Drug Interactions (7)].
2.[ADDRESS_755854] the plasma concentrations nor LDL-C reduction of atorvastatin calcium tablets; thus,
 dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary [see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal
 Muscle (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ].
2.6 Dosage in Patients Taking Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, or Certain Protease Inhibitors
In patients taking cyclosporine or the HIV protease inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir) or the hepatitis C protease
 inhibitor (telaprevir), therapy with atorvastatin calcium tablets should be avoided. In patients with HIV taking lopi[INVESTIGATOR_245049], caution should be used when prescribing atorvastatin calcium tablets and the lowest dose necessary employed. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, therapy with atorvastatin calcium tablets should be limited to [ADDRESS_755855] dose necessary of atorvastatin calcium tablets is employed [see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) , Drug Interactions
 (7)].
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS
Page 281 of 356Page 283 of 364

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of atorvastatin calcium tablets use during pregnancy; however in rare reports, congenital anomalies were observed following intrauterine exposure to statins. In rat and rabbit animal reproduction studies, atorvastatin revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM TABLETS SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE ONLY WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, atorvastatin calcium tablets should be discontinued immediately and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ].
4.4 Nursing mothers
It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted into human milk; however a small amount of another drug in this
 class does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require atorvastatin calcium tablets treatment should not breastfeed their infants [see Use in Specific
 Populations (8.3)].
[ADDRESS_755857] been reported with
 atorvastatin calcium tablets and with other drugs in this class. A history of renal impairment may be a risk factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Such patients merit closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects.
Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in
 conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values >[ADDRESS_755858]. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis.
There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy,
 associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by: [CONTACT_576343],
Page 282 of 356Page 284 of 364
http://labeling.greenstonellc.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=983[10/8/2015 12:57:02 PM] which persist despi[INVESTIGATOR_575744]; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without
 significant inflammation; improvement with immunosuppressive agents.
Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked
 elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by [CONTACT_245160]. Atorvastatin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.
The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of
 cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, including saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_245049], tipranavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, niacin, or azole antifungals. Physicians considering combined therapy with atorvastatin and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, clarithromycin, a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_245049], darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, azole antifungals, or lipid-modifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Lower starting and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs (see Drug Interactions (7)). Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy.
Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 [see also Dosage and Administration
 (2.6), Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].
Table 1. Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of
 Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis
Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations
*Cyclosporine, HIV protease
 inhibitors (tipranavir plus ritonavir), hepatitis C protease inhibitor (telaprevir)Avoid atorvastatin
HIV protease inhibitor (lopi[INVESTIGATOR_245049])Use with caution and lowest dose necessary
Clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (saquinavir plus ritonavir , darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir)Do not exceed 20 mg atorvastatin daily
HIV protease inhibitor (nelfinavir)Hepatitis C protease inhibitor (boceprevir)Do not exceed [ADDRESS_755859] been reported with atorvastatin co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing atorvastatin with colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7.11)].
Atorvastatin therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures).
Use with caution and with the lowest dose necessary ( 12.3)*

 function. Persistent elevations (>3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin calcium tablets in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively.
One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not
 associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of [ADDRESS_755861] been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with atorvastatin calcium tablets, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart atorvastatin calcium tablets.
Atorvastatin calcium tablets should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol
 and/or have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of atorvastatin calcium tablets [see Contraindications (4.1) ].
5.[ADDRESS_755862] been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors,
 including atorvastatin calcium tablets.
Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal and/or gonadal steroid production.
 Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if a statin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407], and cimetidine.
5.4 CNS Toxicity
Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated for 3 months at 120 mg/kg/day. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve
 vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mg/kg/day. The 120 mg/kg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma area-under-the-curve (AUC, 0–24 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mg/day. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mg/kg/day and one at 120 mg/kg/day) in a 2-year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day or in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (0–24) based on the maximum recommended human dose of 80 mg/day.
CNS vascular lesions, characterized by [CONTACT_245161], edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of
 perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of this class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dose-dependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about [ADDRESS_755863]-hoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by [CONTACT_245162] (SPARCL) study

 calcium tablets 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3% atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4% placebo; HR: 1.68, 95% CI:
 1.09, 2.59; p=0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6%) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7%). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ].
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS
The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:Rhabdomyolysis and myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]

6.[ADDRESS_755864] the rates observed in clinical practice.
In the atorvastatin calcium tablets placebo-controlled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8755 atorvastatin
 calcium tablets vs. 7311 placebo; age range 10–93 years, 39% women, 91% Caucasians, 3% Blacks, 2% Asians, 4% other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 9.7% of patients on atorvastatin calcium tablets and 9.5% of the patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were: myalgia (0.7%), diarrhea (0.5%), nausea (0.4%), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4%), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4%).
The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 2% and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, in
 patients treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets in placebo controlled trials (n=8755) were: nasopharyngitis (8.3%),
 arthralgia (6.9%), diarrhea (6.8%), pain in extremity (6.0%), and urinary tract infection (5.7%).

Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT)In ASCOT [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] involving 10,305 participants (age range 40–80 years, 19% women; 94.6%
 Caucasians, 2.6% Africans, 1.5% South Asians, 1.3% mixed/other) treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 mg
 daily (n=5,168) or placebo (n=5,137), the safety and tolerability profile of the group treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets was comparable to that of the group treated with placebo during a median of 3.3 years of follow-up.
Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS)
In CARDS [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] involving 2,838 subjects (age range 39–77 years, 32% women; 94.3%
 Caucasians, 2.4% South Asians, 2.3% Afro-Caribbean, 1.0% other) with type 2 diabetes treated with atorvastatin
 calcium tablets 10 mg daily (n=1,428) or placebo (n=1,410), there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median follow-up of 3.9 years. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported.
Treating to New Targets Study (TNT)
In TNT [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] involving 10,001 subjects (age range 29–78 years, 19% women; 94.1%
 Caucasians, 2.9% Blacks, 1.0% Asians, 2.0% other) with clinically evident CHD treated with atorvastatin calcium
 tablets 10 mg daily (n=5006) or atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg daily (n=4995), there were more serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the high-dose atorvastatin group (92, 1.8%; 497, 9.9%, respectively) as compared to the low-dose group (69, 1.4%; 404, 8.1%, respectively) during a median follow-up of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations ( ≥3 × ULN twice within 4–10 days) occurred in 62 (1.3%) individuals
 with atorvastatin 80 mg and in nine (0.2%) individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK ( ≥ 10 × ULN) were
 low overall, but were higher in the high-dose atorvastatin treatment group (13, 0.3%) compared to the low-dose atorvastatin group (6, 0.1%).

 rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1%) compared to placebo (0.0%). Diabetes was reported as an
 adverse reaction in 144 subjects (6.1%) in the atorvastatin group and 89 subjects (3.8%) in the placebo group [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].
In a post-hoc analysis, atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (218/2365, 9.2%
 vs. 274/2366, 11.6%) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (55/2365, 2.3% vs. 33/2366, 1.4%) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 atorvastatin calcium tablets vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke [7 (16%) atorvastatin calcium tablets vs. 2 (4%) placebo].
There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for all-cause mortality: 216 (9.1%) in the
 atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg/day group vs. 211 (8.9%) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg group (3.3%) than in the placebo group (4.1%). The proportions of subjects who experienced non-cardiovascular death were numerically larger in the atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg group (5.0%) than in the placebo group (4.0%).
6.[ADDRESS_755866] been identified during postapproval use of atorvastatin calcium tablets. Because
 these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
Adverse reactions associated with atorvastatin therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above,
 regardless of causality assessment, include the following: anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194]), rhabdomyolysis, myositis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure, dizziness, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis.
There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use [see Warnings and
 Precautions (5.1)].There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia,
 memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks).
6.3 Pediatric Patients (ages 10–17 years)
In a 26-week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls (n=140, 31% female; 92% Caucasians, 1.6% Blacks,
 1.6% Asians, 4.8% other), the safety and tolerability profile of atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.6)  and 
Use in Special Populations, Pediatric Use (8.4) ].
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS
The risk of myopathy during treatment with statins is increased with concurrent administration of fibric acid
 derivatives, lipid-modifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine, or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, and itraconazole) [see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1)  and Clinical
 Pharmacology (12.3)].
7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A4
Page 287 of 356Page 289 of 364
http://labeling.greenstonellc.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=983[10/8/2015 12:57:02 PM]Atorvastatin is metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P450 3A4. Concomitant administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets
 with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of
 interaction and potentiation of effects depend on the variability of effect on CYP 3A4.
 Clarithromycin: Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin
 calcium tablets 80 mg with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) compared to that of atorvastatin calcium tablets alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Therefore, in patients taking clarithromycin, caution should be used when
 the atorvastatin dose exceeds 20 mg [see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1)  and Dosage and
 Administration (2.6) ].
Combination of Protease Inhibitors: Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets with several combinations of HIV protease inhibitors, as well as with the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, compared to that of atorvastatin calcium tablets alone [see Clinical
 Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, in patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir, or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor telaprevir, concomitant use of atorvastatin calcium tablets should be avoided. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor lopi[INVESTIGATOR_245049], caution should be used when prescribing atorvastatin calcium tablets and the lowest dose necessary should be used. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitors saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, or fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, the dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets should not exceed 20 mg and should be used with caution [see Warnings and
 Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1)  and Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. In patients taking the HIV protease
 inhibitor nelfinavir or the hepatitis C protease inhibitor boceprevir, the dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets should not exceed 40 mg and close clinical monitoring is recommended.
Itraconazole: Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin calcium
 tablets 40 mg and itraconazole 200 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Therefore, in patients taking
 itraconazole, caution should be used when the atorvastatin dose exceeds 20 mg [see Warnings and Precautions,
 Skeletal Muscle (5.1)  and Dosage and Administration (2.6)].
7.2 Grapefruit Juice
Contains one or more components that inhibit CYP 3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin,
 especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (>1.2 liters per day).
7.3 Cyclosporine
Atorvastatin and atorvastatin-metabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1
 (e.g., cyclosporine) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin AUC was significantly increased with concomitant administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 mg and cyclosporine 5.2 mg/kg/day compared to that of atorvastatin calcium tablets alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The co-administration of atorvastatin
 calcium tablets with cyclosporine should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) ].
7.4 Gemfibrozil
Due to an increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are co-administered with
 gemfibrozil, concomitant administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets with gemfibrozil should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
7.5 Other Fibrates
Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with
 concurrent administration of other fibrates, atorvastatin calcium tablets should be administered with caution when
Page 288 of 356Page 290 of 364
http://labeling.greenstonellc.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=983[10/8/2015 12:57:02 PM] used concomitantly with other fibrates [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
7.6 Niacin
The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when atorvastatin calcium tablets are used in combination with
 niacin; a reduction in atorvastatin calcium tablets dosage should be considered in this setting [see Warnings and
 Precautions (5.1)].
7.7 Rifampin or other Inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4
Concomitant administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., efavirenz,
 rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, simultaneous co-administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of atorvastatin after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations.
7.8 Digoxin
When multiple doses of atorvastatin calcium tablets and digoxin were coadministered, steady state plasma digoxin
 concentrations increased by [CONTACT_3450] 20%. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately.
7.9 Oral Contraceptives
Co-administration of atorvastatin calcium tablets and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone
 and ethinyl estradiol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. These increases should be considered when selecting an
 oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.

 pregnancies in women exposed to other statins, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and
 fetal deaths/stillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population. However, this study was only able to exclude a three-to-four-fold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence. In 89% of these cases, drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified.
Atorvastatin crosses the rat placenta and reaches a level in fetal liver equivalent to that of maternal plasma.
 Atorvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day or in rabbits at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. These doses resulted in multiples of about 30 times (rat) or 20 times (rabbit) the human exposure based on surface area (mg/m ) [see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3) ].
In a study in rats given 20, 100, or 225 mg/kg/day, from gestation day 7 through to lactation day 21 (weaning), there was decreased pup survival at birth, neonate, weaning, and maturity in pups of mothers dosed with 225 mg/kg/day. Body weight was decreased on days 4 and 21 in pups of mothers dosed at 100 mg/kg/day; pup body weight was decreased at birth and at days 4, 21, and 91 at 225 mg/kg/day. Pup development was delayed (rotorod performance at 100 mg/kg/day and acoustic startle at 225 mg/kg/day; pi[INVESTIGATOR_575745]-opening at 225 mg/kg/day). These doses correspond to 6 times (100 mg/kg) and 22 times (225 mg/kg) the human AUC at 80 mg/day.
Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Atorvastatin calcium tablets should be
 administered to women of childbearing potential only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking atorvastatin, it should be discontinued immediately and the patient advised again as to the potential hazards to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.

Animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels. Because another drug in this class passes into human milk and because statins have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women requiring atorvastatin treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants [see Contraindications (4) ].

Safety and effectiveness in patients 10–[ADDRESS_755869] been
 evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 6 months' duration in adolescent boys and postmenarchal girls. Patients treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse experiences observed in both groups, regardless of causality assessment, were infections. Doses greater than [ADDRESS_755870] on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls [see Clinical Studies (14.6) ; Adverse Reactions, Pediatric Patients (ages 10–17 years) (6.3) ; and Dosage and

 Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on atorvastatin therapy [see Contraindications, Pregnancy (4.3)  and Use in Specific Populations, Pregnancy (8.1) ]. Atorvastatin calcium
 tablets have not been studied in controlled clinical trials involving pre-pubertal patients or patients younger than 10 years of age.

8.5 Geriatric Use
Of the 39,828 patients who received atorvastatin calcium tablets in clinical studies, 15,813 (40%) were ≥65 years old2
Page 290 of 356Page 292 of 364
http://labeling.greenstonellc.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=983[10/8/2015 12:57:02 PM] and 2,800 (7%) were ≥75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these
 subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses
 between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older adults cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age ( ≥65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, atorvastatin should be prescribed with caution in the
 elderly.
8.6 Hepatic Impairment
Atorvastatin calcium tablets are contraindicated in patients with active liver disease which may include unexplained
 persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels [see Contraindications (4)  and Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ].
10 OVERDOSAGE
There is no specific treatment for atorvastatin overdosage. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be treated
 symptomatically, and supportive measures instituted as required. Due to extensive drug binding to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance atorvastatin clearance.
11 DESCRIPTION
Atorvastatin calcium is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent. Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-
coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early and rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.
Atorvastatin calcium is [R-(R*, R*)]-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-ß, δ
-dihydroxy-5-(1-methylethyl)-3-phenyl-4-
[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-1H-pyrrole-1-heptanoic acid, calcium salt (2:1) trihydrate. The empi[INVESTIGATOR_575746] (C H FN
O ) Ca•3H O and its molecular weight is 1209.42. Its structural formula is:
Atorvastatin calcium is a white to off-white crystalline powder that is insoluble in aqueous solutions of pH 4 and below. Atorvastatin calcium is very slightly soluble in distilled water, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, and acetonitrile; slightly soluble in ethanol; and freely soluble in methanol.
Atorvastatin calcium tablets for oral administration contain 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg atorvastatin and the following
 inactive ingredients: calcium carbonate, USP; candelilla wax, FCC; croscarmellose sodium, NF; hydroxypropyl cellulose, NF; lactose monohydrate, NF; magnesium stearate, NF; microcrystalline cellulose, NF; Opadry White YS-1-7040 (hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, titanium dioxide); polysorbate 80, NF; simethicone emulsion.
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
12.1 Mechanism of Action
Atorvastatin calcium is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that33 34 2 5 2 2
Page 291 of 356Page 293 of 364
http://labeling.greenstonellc.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=983[10/8/2015 12:57:02 PM] converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol.
 Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation,
 these complexes separate into HDL (high-density lipoprotein), IDL (intermediate-density lipoprotein), LDL (low-density lipoprotein), and VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the high-affinity LDL receptor. Clinical and pathologic studies show that elevated plasma levels of total cholesterol (total-C), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) promote human atherosclerosis and are risk factors for developi[INVESTIGATOR_245055], while increased levels of HDL-C are associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk.
In animal models, atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by [CONTACT_245163]-CoA reductase
 and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by [CONTACT_576344]; atorvastatin also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. Atorvastatin reduces LDL-C in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a population that rarely responds to other lipid-lowering medication(s).
A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of total-C, LDL-C, and apo B (a membrane
 complex for LDL-C) promote human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDL-C (and its transport complex, apo A) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_575747]-C and LDL-C, and inversely with the level of HDL-C.
Atorvastatin reduces total-C, LDL-C, and apo B in patients with homozygous and heterozygous FH, nonfamilial
 forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. Atorvastatin also reduces VLDL-C and TG and produces variable increases in HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-1. Atorvastatin reduces total-C, LDL-C, VLDL-C, apo B, TG, and non-HDL-C, and increases HDL-C in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia. Atorvastatin reduces intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDL-C) in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia.
Like LDL, cholesterol-enriched triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, including VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein
 (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a triad with low HDL-C levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with non-lipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such, total plasma TG has not consistently been shown to be an independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.
12.2 Pharmacodynamics
Atorvastatin calcium, as well as some of its metabolites, is pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the
 primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDL-C reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response [see  Dosage and Administration (2)].
12.3 Pharmacokinetics
Absorption: 
Atorvastatin calcium tablets are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_89385]; maximum plasma
 concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to atorvastatin calcium dose.
 The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa and/or hepatic first-pass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by [CONTACT_3450] 25% and 9%, respectively, as assessed by [CONTACT_64072], LDL-C reduction is similar whether atorvastatin calcium tablets are given with or without food. Plasma atorvastatin concentrations are lower (approximately 30% for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDL-C reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

http://labeling.greenstonellc.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=983[10/8/2015 12:57:02 PM]Distribution: Mean volume of distribution of atorvastatin is approximately 381 liters. Atorvastatin is ≥98% bound to
 plasma proteins. A blood/plasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells.
 Based on observations in rats, atorvastatin is likely to be secreted in human milk [see Contraindications, Nursing
 Mothers (4.4) and Use in Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3) ].
Metabolism: Atorvastatin is extensively metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives and various beta-oxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by [CONTACT_245166]- and parahydroxylated metabolites is
 equivalent to that of atorvastatin. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of atorvastatin metabolism by [CONTACT_9058]
 P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of atorvastatin in humans following co-administration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. In animals, the ortho-hydroxy
 metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation.
Excretion: Atorvastatin and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extra-hepatic
 metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination half-life of atorvastatin in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the half-life of inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2% of a dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets is recovered in urine following oral administration.
Specific PopulationsGeriatric: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin are higher (approximately 40% for Cmax and 30% for AUC) in
 healthy elderly subjects (age ≥65 years) than in young adults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDL-lowering
 at any dose of drug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults [see Use in Specific Populations,
 Geriatric Use (8.5)].Pediatric: Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available.
Gender: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin in women differ from those in men (approximately 20% higher for
 Cmax and 10% lower for AUC); however, there is no clinically significant difference in LDL-C reduction with atorvastatin between men and women.
Renal Impairment: Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of atorvastatin;
 thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary [see  Dosage and Administration, Dosage in
 Patients with Renal Impairment (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions, Skeletal Muscle (5.1) ].
Hemodialysis: While studies have not been conducted in patients with end-stage renal disease, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of atorvastatin since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins.
Hepatic Impairment: In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin are
 markedly increased. Cmax and AUC are each 4-fold greater in patients with Childs-Pugh A disease. Cmax and AUC are approximately 16-fold and 11-fold increased, respectively, in patients with Childs-Pugh B disease [see Contraindications (4.1) ].

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, 2 rare tumors were found in
 muscle in high-dose females: in one, there was a rhabdomyosarcoma and, in another, there was a fibrosarcoma. This dose represents a plasma AUC (0–24) value of approximately 16 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose.
A 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice given 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg/day resulted in a significant increase in liver
 adenomas in high-dose males and liver carcinomas in high-dose females. These findings occurred at plasma AUC (0–24) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose.
In vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation:
 the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium  and Escherichia coli,  the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese
 hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test.
Studies in rats performed at doses up to 175 mg/kg (15 times the human exposure) produced no changes in fertility. There was aplasia and aspermia in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_245057] 2 of 10 rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day of atorvastatin for 3 months (16 times the human AUC at the 80 mg dose); testis weights were significantly lower at 30 and 100 mg/kg and epi[INVESTIGATOR_245058] 100 mg/kg. Male rats given 100 mg/kg/day for 11 weeks prior to mating had decreased sperm motility, spermatid head concentration, and increased abnormal sperm. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on semen parameters, or reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40, or 120 mg/kg for two years.
14 CLINICAL STUDIES
14.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease
In the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the effect of atorvastatin on fatal and non-fatalSee Section 7 for clinical significance.*
Page 295 of 356Page 297 of 364
http://labeling.greenstonellc.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=983[10/8/2015 12:57:02 PM] coronary heart disease was assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 40–80 years of age (mean of 63 years), without a
 previous myocardial infarction and with TC levels ≤251 mg/dL (6.5 mmol/L). Additionally, all patients had at least 3
 of the following cardiovascular risk factors: male gender (81.1%), age >55 years (84.5%), smoking (33.2%), diabetes
 (24.3%), history of CHD in a first-degree relative (26%), TC:HDL >6 (14.3%), peripheral vascular disease (5.1%), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4%), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8%), specific ECG abnormality (14.3%), proteinuria/albuminuria (62.4%). In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were treated with anti-hypertensive therapy (Goal BP <140/90 mm Hg for non-diabetic patients; <130/80 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 mg daily (n=5168) or placebo (n=5137), using a covariate adaptive method which took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.[ADDRESS_755875] of 10 mg/day of atorvastatin calcium tablets on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical
 trials.
Atorvastatin significantly reduced the rate of coronary events [either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the
 placebo group vs. 40 events in the atorvastatin calcium tablets group) or non-fatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the atorvastatin calcium tablets group)] with a relative risk reduction of 36% [(based on incidences of 1.9% for atorvastatin calcium tablets vs. 3.0% for placebo), p=0.0005 (see  Figure 1)]. The risk
 reduction was consistent regardless of age, smoking status, obesity, or presence of renal dysfunction. The effect of atorvastatin was seen regardless of baseline LDL levels. Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive.
Figure 1: Effect of Atorvastatin 10 mg/day on Cumulative Incidence of Non-Fatal Myocardial Infarction or
 Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOT-LLA)
Atorvastatin also significantly decreased the relative risk for revascularization procedures by 42%. Although the reduction of fatal and non-fatal strokes did not reach a pre-defined significance level (p=0.01), a favorable trend was observed with a 26% relative risk reduction (incidences of 1.7% for atorvastatin calcium tablets and 2.3% for placebo). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for death due to cardiovascular causes (p=0.51) or noncardiovascular causes (p=0.17).
In the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of atorvastatin on cardiovascular disease
 (CVD) endpoints was assessed in 2838 subjects (94% white, 68% male), ages 40–75 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL ≤ 160 mg/dL and TG ≤ 600 mg/dL. In
 addition to diabetes, subjects had 1 or more of the following risk factors: current smoking (23%), hypertension (80%), retinopathy (30%), or microalbuminuria (9%) or macroalbuminuria (3%). No subjects on hemodialysis were

 allocated to either atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 1:1 ratio and were followed
 for a median duration of 3.9 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of any of the major cardiovascular events: myocardial infarction, acute CHD death, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke. The primary analysis was the time to first occurrence of the primary endpoint.
Baseline characteristics of subjects were: mean age of 62 years, mean HbA  7.7%; median LDL-C 120 mg/dL;
 median TC 207 mg/dL; median TG 151 mg/dL; median HDL-C 52 mg/dL.
The effect of atorvastatin 10 mg/day on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials.Atorvastatin significantly reduced the rate of major cardiovascular events (primary endpoint events) (83 events in the
 atorvastatin calcium tablets group vs. 127 events in the placebo group) with a relative risk reduction of 37%, HR 0.63, 95% CI (0.48, 0.83) (p=0.001) (see Figure 2). An effect of atorvastatin calcium tablets was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels.
Atorvastatin significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48% (21 events in the atorvastatin calcium tablets group vs. 39
 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95% CI (0.31, 0.89) (p=0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42% (38 events in the atorvastatin calcium tablets group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1% CI (0.39, 0.86) (p=0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death.
There were 61 deaths in the atorvastatin calcium tablets group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p=0.059). Figure 2: Effect of Atorvastatin 10 mg/day on Time to Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Event

 <130 mg/dL after completing an 8-week, open-label, run-in period with atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 mg/day. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 10 mg/day or 80 mg/day of atorvastatin calcium tablets and followed for a median duration of 4.[ADDRESS_755876] occurrence of any of the following major cardiovascular events (MCVE): death due to CHD, non-fatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal and non-fatal stroke. The mean LDL-C, TC, TG, non-HDL, and HDL cholesterol levels at 12 weeks were 73, 145, 128, 98, and 47 mg/dL during treatment with 80 mg of atorvastatin calcium tablets and 99, 177, 152, 129, and 48 mg/dL during treatment with 10 mg of atorvastatin calcium tablets.
Treatment with atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg/day significantly reduced the rate of MCVE (434 events in the 80
 mg/day group vs. 548 events in the 10 mg/day group) with a relative risk reduction of 22%, HR 0.78, 95% CI (0.69,1c

Of the events that comprised the primary efficacy endpoint, treatment with atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg/day
 significantly reduced the rate of non-fatal, non-procedure related MI and fatal and non-fatal stroke, but not CHD death or resuscitated cardiac arrest (Table 5). Of the predefined secondary endpoints, treatment with atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg/day significantly reduced the rate of coronary revascularization, angina, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19934], but not peripheral vascular disease. The reduction in the rate of CHF with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_245059] 8% of patients with a prior history of CHF.
There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for all-cause mortality (Table 5). The proportions of
 subjects who experienced cardiovascular death, including the components of CHD death and fatal stroke, were numerically smaller in the atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg group than in the atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 mg treatment group. The proportions of subjects who experienced noncardiovascular death were numerically larger in the atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg group than in the atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 mg treatment group.
In the Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL), treatment with
 atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg/day was compared to treatment with simvastatin 20–40 mg/day in 8,888 subjects up to 80 years of age with a history of CHD to assess whether reduction in CV risk could be achieved. Patients were mainly male (81%), white (99%) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDL-C of 121.5 mg/dL at randomization; 76% were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no run-in period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years. The mean LDL-C, TC, TG, HDL, and non-HDL cholesterol levels at Week 12 were 78, 145, 115, 45, and 100 mg/dL during treatment with 80 mg of atorvastatin calcium tablets and 105, 179, 142, 47, and 132 mg/dL during treatment with 20–[ADDRESS_755877] major
 coronary event (fatal CHD, non-fatal MI, and resuscitated cardiac arrest): 411 (9.3%) in the atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg/day group vs. 463 (10.4%) in the simvastatin 20–40 mg/day group, HR 0.89, 95% CI ( 0.78, 1.01), p=0.07.
There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for all-cause mortality: 366 (8.2%) in the
 atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg/day group vs. 374 (8.4%) in the simvastatin 20–40 mg/day group. The proportions of subjects who experienced CV or non-CV death were similar for the atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg group and the simvastatin 20–40 mg group.
14.2 Hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] ( Fredrickson Types IIa
 and IIb)
Atorvastatin reduces total-C, LDL-C, VLDL-C, apo B, and TG, and increases HDL-C in patients with hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_575748]. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy.
Atorvastatin calcium tablets are effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], with and
 without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly.
In two multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose-response studies in patients with hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], atorvastatin calcium
 tablets given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG. (Pooled results are provided in Table 6.)Atorvastatin 80 mg: atorvastatin 10 mg

In three multicenter, double-blind studies in patients with hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], atorvastatin was compared to other statins.
 After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 7).

In a study without a concurrent control group, 29 patients ages 6 to 37 years with homozygous FH received maximum
 daily doses of 20 to 80 mg of atorvastatin calcium tablets. The mean LDL-C reduction in this study was 18%. Twenty-five patients with a reduction in LDL-C had a mean response of 20% (range of 7% to 53%, median of 24%); the remaining 4 patients had 7% to 24% increases in LDL-C. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDL-receptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDL-C. The remaining 3 receptor-negative patients had a mean LDL-C reduction of 22%.

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study followed by [CONTACT_3440]-label phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 10–17
 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia, were randomized to atorvastatin calcium tablets (n=140) or placebo (n=47) for 26 weeks and then all received atorvastatin calcium tablets for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDL-C level ≥ 190 mg/dL or 2) a baseline LDL-C level ≥ 160 mg/dL and positive family history of FH or documented premature
 cardiovascular disease in a first or second-degree relative. The mean baseline LDL-C value was 218.6 mg/dL (range: 138.5–385.0 mg/dL) in the atorvastatin calcium tablets group compared to 230.0 mg/dL (range: 160.0–324.5 mg/dL) in the placebo group. The dosage of atorvastatin calcium tablets (once daily) was [ADDRESS_755879] 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDL-C level was > 130 mg/dL. The number of atorvastatin calcium tablets-treated patients who required uptitration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the double-blind phase was 78 (55.7%).
Atorvastatin significantly decreased plasma levels of total-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B during the
 26-week double-blind phase (see  Table 10 ).

LAB-0644-3.[ADDRESS_755883].What Are Atorvastatin Calcium Tablets?Atorvastatin calcium is a prescription medicine that lowers cholesterol in your blood. It lowers the LDL-C ("bad"
 cholesterol) and triglycerides in your blood. It can raise your HDL-C ("good" cholesterol) as well. Atorvastatin calcium tablets are for adults and children over [ADDRESS_755884] heart disease or risk factors for heart disease such as:
age, smoking, high blood pressure, low HDL-C, heart disease in the family.
Atorvastatin calcium tablets can lower the risk for heart attack or stroke in patients with diabetes and risk factors such as:
eye problems, kidney problems, smoking, or high blood pressure.
Atorvastatin calcium tablets start to work in about 2 weeks.
What is Cholesterol?Cholesterol and triglycerides are fats that are made in your body. They are also found in foods. You need some
 cholesterol for good health, but too much is not good for you. Cholesterol and triglycerides can clog your blood vessels. It is especially important to lower your cholesterol if you have heart disease, smoke, have diabetes or high blood pressure, are older, or if heart disease starts early in your family.
Who Should Not Take Atorvastatin Calcium Tablets?Do not take atorvastatin calcium tablets if you:
are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, or are planning to become pregnant. Atorvastatin calcium tablets may
 harm your unborn baby. If you get pregnant, stop taking atorvastatin calcium tablets and call your doctor right away.

size, particle concentration) in subjects with NASH before and after treatment with OCA and t o assess the changes 
induced by [CONTACT_575768] A reductase inhibitor (atorvastatin) therapy.  Assuming a 22 U/L  increase from 
baseline with a standard deviation of 20  in LDL in the 
OCA 25 mg group, a sample size of 20 subjects per group will provide greater than 99.9% power to demonstrate the 
statistically significant difference of LDL increase from baseline with a 2 -sided type I error of 0.05 It is the intent of this study to characterize the components of 
LDL metabolism (cholesterol concentration, particle size,

Section 5.8. Summary of 
Known Potential 
Risks with Atorvastatin  (Section 5.8 added to Version 2) Muscle complaints are the most frequent adverse reports among patients treated with statins , with the most severe 
side effects including myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.  The  
Statin Muscle Safety Task Force (Rosenson 2014) has provided a classification of the spectrum of statin -
associated muscle AEs that may be seen in clinical 
practice and can be used in characterizing reports of 
muscle-related events.  
a. Myalgia – unexplained muscle discomfort 
often described as “flu -like” symptoms  
− Muscle aches  
− Muscle soreness  
− Muscle stiffness  
− Muscle tenderness  
− Muscle cramps with or shortly after exercise (not nocturnal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007])  
b. Myopathy – muscle weakness (not attributed 
to pain and not necessarily associated with 
elevated CPK)  
c. Myositis – muscle inflammation  
d. Myonecrosis – muscle enzyme elevations or 
hyperCPKemia  
− Mild >3x baseline or ULN  
− Moderate ≥10x baseline or ULN 
− Severe ≥50x baseline or ULN

e. Clinical Rhabdomyolysis - Myonecrosis with 
myoglobinuria or acute renal failure (increase 
in serum creatinine ≥0.5 mg/dL  
There is no evidence that these muscle- related AEs are a 
continuum beginning with myalgia and progressing to 
more severe manifestations of myopathy; rather events 
occur independen t of each other.  Myalgia events, with 
frequencies ranging from 1 % to 5% in clinical trial s to 
11% to 29% in observational cohorts, typi[INVESTIGATOR_575750] 1 month of statin initiation and resolve within 2 
weeks of statin cessation (Rosenson 2014).  Retrospective 
analyses have suggested that patients who discontinue 
statins due to intolerance are able to tolerate statins long -
term following re -challenge (Zhang 2013, Mampuya 
2013).   
Historically, statins have been associated with biochemical 
abnormali ties of liver function, but available data suggest 
that increases in liver transaminases associated with 
statins are asymptomatic and generally reversible (Desai 
2014).  In the absence of liver disease, US guidelines 
(Stone 2013) recommend that baseline tr ansaminase levels 
should be checked before initiating statin therapy and subsequent testing should only be done in the presence of symptoms suggestive of hepatic disease.  As this study is 
being conducted in subjects with confirmed NASH, liver 
enzymes will  be frequently monitored and Section [IP_ADDRESS], 
Section [IP_ADDRESS], and Appendix B provide detailed guidance for handling elevated liver biochemistry values.  
Statins modestly increase the risk of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus in individuals with risk factors for di abetes.  
Individuals receiving statin therapy should be evaluated 
for new-onset diabetes according to the current diabetes 
screening guidelines (American Diabetes Association 2013).

Confusion and memory loss have been reported with 
statins, but medical evi dence supporting a causal effect is 
weak or nonexistent (Simic 2015).  However, any reports 
of cognitive events should be appropriately evaluated, 
particularly in individuals whose symptoms persist 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_575751].  
In this study, any AEs (including signs and symptoms 
described above) regardless of relationship to investigational p roduct or study medication, must be 
documented appropriately (See Section 12 )

o Evaluate the patient for other conditions 
that might increase the risk for muscle 
symptoms. 
o If muscle symptoms resolve, and if no contraindication exists, re -challenge the 
subject with the same or a reduced dose of 
atorvastatin to establish a causal 
relationship between the muscle symptoms and statin therapy . 
o Once a low dose stat in is tolerated, the 
dose may be gradually increased as tolerated and clinically indicated . 
o If after 2 months without statin treatment, muscle symptoms or elevated CPK levels do not completely resolve, consider other 
causes of muscle symptoms. 
o If persisten t muscle symptoms are 
determined to arise from a condition unrelated to statin therapy, or if the 
predisposing condition has been treated, resume statin therapy at the original dose.

(new text shown in the right column) . 
 
Development of the following clinical laborator y values 
during the course of the double-blind and LTSE phases of 
the study mandates investigational product 
discontinuation: 
•An aminotransferase (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] 
or ALT) elevation that is > 3x ULN/baseline/nadir, or 
•Total bilirubin >1 .5 mg/dL (25.7 μmol/L) AND >2x the 
predose value (average of all pretreatment values), or  
•When myopathy is diagnosed or suspected (confirm with 
CPK prior to permanent discontinuation; discontinue if 
CPK >10x ULN)  
Note:  The mean of all Screening and Base line values 
constitute the predose values.  
If a subject is required to discontinue investigational 
product due to an increase in aminotransferase or bilirubin, 
the subject must be followed at appropriate intervals until 
these parameters have returned to within the normal range 
or prestudy values, and/or are stable, or there is no ongoing 
clinical concern.   
 
 
Because transient fluctuations of ALT or AST are 
common, and progression to severe drug- induced liver 
injury or acute liver failure is uncommon, automatic 
discontinuation of investigational product with an 
elevation of ALT or AST that is >3x ULN/baseline/n adir 
or total bilirubin >2x ULN/baseline/nadir, as described in 
Appendix  B, may be unnecessary.  If a subject develops 
signs of a mild or moderate event of drug -induced liver 
injury, regardless of causality, investigational product 
should be interrupted un til the event has resolved or 
returned to baseline, but the subject should continue with 
the study visit schedule.  The subject may restart 
treatment after resolution of the event or return to 
baseline.  Follow -up procedures, including laboratory 
evaluations and physical examinations, must be 
performed after a maximum of [ADDRESS_755906] will be allowed to continue treatment.

Adjudication 
Committees   All suspected major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACE), and drug -related hepatic injury events that 
occur after administration of the first dose of 
investigational product will be reviewed by [CONTACT_576356], depending on event  
type, before inclusion in any analysis.  The 2 committees and event types they are responsible for adjudicating are 
as follows:  
•Cardiovascular Events Committee (CEC):  Adjudicates 
all suspected MACE (Appendix D)  
•Hepatic Safety Committee:  Adjudicates all suspected 
drug-related hepatic injury events  
Each adjudication committee will have a charter that documents the reporting of events by [CONTACT_3452] ; 
definition of the suspected events to be adjudicated ; 
supply of source documentation to the committee ; and the 
entire data flow and process from committee membership, review of the events by [CONTACT_942], reporting of the final assessment, and the working procedures of the 
committee.   
The adjudication committee members will include experts with relevant  adjudication experience; they will not be 
involved in the study as Investigators, DMC members, or 
consultants.  Any candidate found to have a conflict or 
whose name [CONTACT_576377].  Conflicts of interest are assessed 
regularly, and if members are found to have a new 
conflict of interest they will be replaced.  
The adjudication of suspected events will be based on 
available source documentation, including but not limited 
to individual clinical study data, h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
histology, discharge summaries, and/or death certificates.

5.5 Clinical 
Experience with 
Obeticholic Acid  OCA is under investigation for the treatment of multiple chronic 
liver diseases, including the treatment of NASH, primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and biliary 
atresia.  The clinical development program for OCA includes the following 3 studies conducted using subjects with NAFLD or 
NASH: “ 
“ 
• Study D8602001:  A n ongoing Phase 2 study being 
conducted by [CONTACT_575782]’s development partner (Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3 doses of OCA versus placebo in NASH.  
Study D8602001 is ongoing and remains blinded. OCA is under investigation for the treatment of multiple chronic liver diseases, including the treatment of NASH, primary biliary 
cholangitis (PBC, also called primary biliary cholangitis ( PBC, 
also known as  primary biliary cirrhosis [Beuers 2015a, 
Beuers 2015b, Beuers 2015c ]), primary sclerosing cholangitis 
(PSC), and biliary atresia.  The clinical development program for 
OCA includes the following 3 studies conducted using subjects 
with NAFLD or NASH:  
• Study D860200 1:  A Phase 2 study conducted by 
[CONTACT_575782]’s Asian  development partner (Sumitomo 
Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd) to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of 3 doses of OCA versus placebo in NASH  
Study D8602001 demonstrated a dose -dependent increase in 
the percentage of OCA-treated subjects compared to placebo 
subjects who achieved the primary endpoint (p = 0.053, not significant).   The 40 mg OCA dose group achieved statistical significance for the primary endpoint compared to placebo (p = 0.0496).  Dose -dependent trends not reaching statistical 
significance were also observed for several other pre-
specified histologic endpoints, including the proportion of 
subjects with steatosis and inflammation improvement, ballooning resolution, and NASH resolution.  In the completer analysis, similar dose -dependent effects were 
observed, with 51% of patients in the 40 mg dose group compared to 22% in the placebo group meeting the primary 
endpoint (p = 0.0061).  With the exception of dose -dependent 
pruritus, OCA appeared to be gene rally safe and well 
tolerated.  The number of pruritus -associated 
discontinuations were 0, 0, 2, and 5 subjects in the placebo, 
10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg OCA groups, respectively.  
Changes in lipid parameters were directionally similar to 
those observed in the FLINT study.  No other meaningful differences in the rate of AEs between the OCA and placebo groups were noted .

5.6.6 Rationale 
for Timing of 
Unblinding 
Process and Implications in LTSE 
 For those subjects continuing into the LTSE :  Following 
completion of all study procedures associated with the double-
blind period, subjects will be unblinded via the interactive web 
response system (IWRS) to determine the open -label OCA dose to 
be initiated in the LTSE.  This will allow double -blind, placebo-
treated subjects to initiate OCA at an appropriate dose, and OCA -
treated subjects to maintain or increase their dose based on 
therapeutic response and tolerability rather than forcing fixed 
dosing to maintain the blind.   As Study 747 -209 is a randomized, do uble-blind study, the 
double-blind data will not be unblinded until all double -
blind data are final and the database is locked.  Accordingly, 
all subjects continuing in the LTSE, investigators, and the Sponsor will remain blinded to subjects’ DB treatment regimen.  Subjects who were receiving placebo or [ADDRESS_755927] be informed that statin use is contraindicated during pregnancy.  Methods of contraception should be reviewed and modified, if necessary, to ensure highly 
effective methods with failure rates <1% per year, such as 
implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices, sexual abstinence, or history of vasectomy of partner are used.

receive atorvastatin starting at Week  4 at 10 mg daily, escalating 
to 20 mg at Week  8 (if 10 mg daily is tolerated), with further dose 
adjustments to be performed as clinically indicated at Week  12, 
and throughout the LTSE phase.  Subjects randomized to placebo 
or OCA 5  mg will receive OCA 10  mg during the LTSE; subjects 
randomized to OCA 10 mg or OCA 25 mg will receive OCA 
25 mg during the LTSE.  The study design schematic is shown in 
Figure 1.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_575789] (fasting 
serum LDL cholesterol at Screening Visit  2; ≤125 mg/dL or 
>125 mg/dL) and baseline fibrosis stage (stage 1, 2 or stage 3, 
4).  All subjects will also receive atorvastatin starting at Week  4 
at 10 mg daily, escalatin g to 20 mg at Week  8 (if 10 mg daily is 
tolerated), with further dose adjustments to be performed as clinically indicated at Week  12, and throughout the LTSE phase.  
Subjects will receive open-label OCA 10 mg or OCA 25  mg 
during the LTSE depending on their  double-blind randomized 
dose (see Section 7.1) .  The study design schematic is shown in 
Figre 1.  
7.4.[ADDRESS_755934] Dose Adjustments  During the LTSE phase, all subjects will be treated with OCA.  Subjects randomized to placebo or OCA 5  mg during the double -
blind phase will receive OCA 10  mg upon entry into and 
throughout the LTSE phase.  Subjects randomized to OCA 10  mg 
with no tolerability concerns  will titrate to OCA 25  mg.  Subjects 
randomized to OCA 25 mg will continue to receive this dose 
throughout the LTSE.  Subjects may continue with atorvastatin therapy as clinically indicated.  During the LTSE phase, all subjects will be treated with OCA.  Subjects randomized to placebo or OCA 5  mg during the 
double-blind phase will be re-randomized i n a 1:1 ratio 
through IWRS to OCA 10 mg or OCA 25 mg upon entry into 
and throughout the LTSE phase.  Subjects randomized to OCA 10 mg will continue to receive OCA 10 mg throughout the 
LTSE.  Subjects randomized to OCA 25 mg will continue to 
receive OCA 25 mg throughout the LTSE.  Subjects may 
continue with atorvastatin therapy as clinically indicated.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Severe Drug-Induced 
Liver Injury Subjects who develop significant drug -induced liver injury, which 
is considered to be causally related to the inves tigational product, 
should be discontinued from investigational product and should not be rechallenged.  Significant injury as described in  
Appendix  B, or evidence of functional hepatic impairment as 
indicated by [CONTACT_310177].  Natural progression of the underlying condition and other causal factors such as a common 
bile duct stone or development of other concurrent liver disease 
should be considered before the investigational product is permanently discontinued.    
Severe drug induced -liver injur y that is not considered related to 
investigational product must be discussed with the Sponsor before resuming treatment .  Subjects who discontinue due to significant 
drug-induced liver injury must be followed until the AE has 
resolved, stabilized, or is n ot of clinical concern.  If a subject develops signs and symptoms of a severe drug -
induced liver injury, regardless of causality, investigational 
product and atorvastatin should be interrupted until the 
event has resolved or returned to baseline, but the su bject 
should continue with the study visit schedule.  Subjects who 
develop significant drug- induced liver injury, which is 
considered to be causally related to the investigational product 
or atorvastatin , should be discontinued from investigational 
product or atorvastatin, as appropriate and should not be 
rechallenged.  Significant injury as described in  Appendix B , 
and includes  evidence of functional hepatic impairment as 
indicated by [CONTACT_310274].  Natural progression of the 
underlying condition and other causal factors such as a common bile duct stone or development of other concurrent liver disease 
should be considered before the investigational product is permanently discontinued.

Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  [ADDRESS_755935] refers to OCA or placebo , 
and study medication, where used, refers to atorvastatin.  
9.1.2 LTSE  Following completion of Week  16 Visit procedures, subjects who 
are participating in the LTSE will be unblinded via the IWRS .  
Subjects who were receiving OCA  during the double -blind phase 
will continue to receive either OCA 10  mg or OCA 25 mg once 
daily during the LTSE.  Subjects randomized to placebo or 5 mg 
OCA during the double -blind phase will initiate dosing at OCA 
10 mg in the LTSE.  Subjects randomized to OCA 10 mg during 
the double -blind phase will titrate to OCA 25  mg on Day 1 of the 
LTSE.  Subjects randomized to OCA 25 mg during the double -
blind phase will continue to receive OCA 25  mg. Following completion of Week  16 Visit procedures, all subjects 
will be treated with open -label OCA 10 mg or OCA 25 mg.  
Subjects randomized to placebo or OCA 5 mg during the 
double-blind phase will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_755936] 4  hours between doses of 
the BAS and/or antacids and the investigational product (ie, BAS should be administered [ADDRESS_755937] administration).  Subjects taking BAS (including cholestyramine and its 
derivatives, colestipol, colesevelam, or other sequestrants)  or 
aluminum hydroxide - or smectite -containing antacids should be 
instructed to stagger their dosing of investigational produ ct, 
ensuring at least 4  hours between doses of the BAS and/or 
antacids and the investigational product (ie, BAS should be 
Page 345 of 364
Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  [ADDRESS_755938] administration).  
Taken concomitantly, OCA and warfarin may decrease INR, 
thus INR should be monitored and the dosage of warfarin 
adjusted, as needed, to maintain the target INR range.  
The effect of OCA on drug metabolizing enzymes has been evaluated in both in vitro and clinical studies.  The PK 
profile of caffein e, a sensitive CYP1A2 substrate, showed 
weak effect of OCA on CYP1A2.  Based on these results, 
OCA may increase the exposure of narrow therapeutic index drugs that are substrates for CYP1A2, such as theophylline and tizanidine.  
9.[ADDRESS_755939] (OCA or placebo) dispensing information 
will be provided (eg, bottle numbers allocated) while maintaining the study blind.  The subjects, Investigator, and study site staff will be blinded to the subject’s treatment allocation during the  
subject’s participation in the double -blind phase of the study.  
 The Investigator or designee will be required to register the subject in the IWRS and may be prompted to provide patient data necessary to properly randomize and allocate the subject to 
treatment.  A randomization number will be assigned and 
investigational product  (OCA or placebo) dispensing 
information will be provided (eg, bottle numbers allocated) 
while maintaining the study blind.  The subjects, Investigator, and study site staff will be  blinded to the subject’s treatment 
allocation in the double -blind phase of the study until all 
subjects have completed the double -blind phase of the study 
and the database locked. 
In the LTSE phase, all subjects will be treated with open-
label OCA 10 mg or OCA 25 mg: subjects randomized to placebo or OCA 5 mg during the double -blind phase will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive OCA 10 mg or OCA 25 mg upon entry into and throughout the LTSE phase and subjects randomized to OCA 10 mg or OCA 25 mg during the double -blind phase will continue on the same dose 
throughout the LTSE.   
9.4.2 Emergency Unblinding 
Procedures  Randomization codes and corresponding treatment assignments 
will be made available to the Investigator for emergency use only 
through the I WRS system.  When possible, the Medical Monitor Randomization codes and  corresponding treatment assignments 
will be made available to the Investigator  and the Medical 
Monitor for emergency use only through the IWRS system.

should be consulted in the event that a medical emergency 
necessitates unblinding (ie, in situations where knowledge of the 
blinded treatment is necessary for further medical management of 
the subject).  If i t is not reasonable to inform the Medical Monitor 
in advance of unblinding, the Investigator must promptly document the case in the subject’s source record.  Subsequently, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_576361] (eg, accidental 
unblinding or unblinding due to a serious AE [SAE]).  Procedures 
for unblinding a subject’s treatment will be provided separately to the Investigator.  Similarly, if the Medical Monitor breaks the 
blind for the p urpose of evaluating an emergent safety issue or for 
regulatory reporting purposes, the  Medical Monitor will document 
within study correspondence the rationale, circumstances, and the person(s) being informed about the unblinding.   When possible, the Medical Monitor should be consulted in the 
event that a medical emergency necessitat es unblinding (ie, in 
situations where knowledge of the blinded treatment is necessary for further medical management of the subject).  If it is not reasonable to inform the Medical Monitor in advance of unblinding, the Investigator must promptly document the case in 
the subject’s source record.  Subsequently, the Investigator 
should contact [CONTACT_576362] (eg, accidental unblinding or unblinding due to a serious AE [SAE]).  Procedures for unblinding a subject’s treatment will be provided separately to 
the Investigator.  The Medical Monitor will document within 
study correspondence the rationale, circumstances, and the

[IP_ADDRESS] Severity 
of Pruritus (as 
and AE)  
Since pruritus is a subjective symptom and the occurrence 
and magnitude of which are not readily measured by 
[CONTACT_575805], clinical judgment needs to be applied in the 
management of each subject.  Managing OCA -related 
pruritus may help improve tolerance in those subjects who experience problematic pruritus and may otherwise 
discontinue from the study prematurely.  General guidance 
for the management of subjects experiencing significant pruritus includes:  
• Drug holiday:  A drug holiday is defined as an Investigator ‘prescribed’ complete interruption of dosing for 1 or more consecutive days (ie, non -daily 
dosing does not constitut e a drug holiday).  For 
subjects with severe pruritus, instruct the subject to stop taking investigational product until the pruritus subsides to an acceptable level, at which time it should be restarted.  Details of drug holidays and/or nondaily dosing regimens should be recorded 
in the CRF.     
• Prescribe BAS.  Subjects taking BAS (including 
colestyramine and its derivatives, colestipol, 
colesevelam, or other sequestrants) should be 
Page 354 of 364
Protocol 747 -209  Version 4:  [ADDRESS_755959].   
• Other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_575758].  
• Less frequent dosing of investigational product (eg, on alternate days) may be tried, after which subjects 
may return to their original daily dose as soon as 
tolerated.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy and Follow-Up Pregnancies are not considered AEs in and of themse lves; 
however, if a female study participant becomes pregnant while she is enrolled in the clinical study, she must discontinue treatment with investigational product and atorvastatin immediately (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and the Sponsor must be notified withi n 24 hours 
of the Investigator’s learning of the pregnancy by [CONTACT_576364] .  Entering the 
pregnancy report into the EDC system will automatically notify 
the Sponsor of the pregnancy.  The subject and neonate must b e 
followed for outcome information and/or as considered appropriate by [CONTACT_2725].  
Women who discontinue the study due to pregnancy may not re -
enroll in the study at any point, but should continue with the study visit schedule and must be followed by [CONTACT_22108].  Similarly, if a subject’s pregnancy is terminated early (planned or unplanned), the subject will also be removed from the study.  
Completing the Pregnancy Report in the EDC  is not a substitute 
for reporting an AE/SAE when an AE/SAE has occurred.  In the 
situation when an AE/SAE has occurred, the AE/SAE reporting procedures described in Section 17.[ADDRESS_755960] also be followed.  Pregnancies are not considered AEs in and of themselves; however, if a female study participant becomes pregnant while 
she is enrolled in the clinical study, she must discontinue treatment with investigational product and atorvastatin immediately (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and the Sponsor must be 
notified within 24  hours of the Investigator’s awareness  of the 
pregnancy by [CONTACT_576365] .  The Pregnancy Report Form must be emailed 
to [EMAIL_380]  or faxed to +1- [PHONE_11937].  
The subject and neonate must be followed for outcome 
information and/or as considered appropriate by [CONTACT_332500].  
Women who discontinue the study due to pregnancy may not re -
enroll in the study at any point, but should continue with the study visit  schedule and must be followed by [CONTACT_575812].  Similarly, if a subject’s pregnancy 
is terminated early (planned or unplanned), the subject will also 
be removed from the study.  
Completing the Pregnancy Report Form is not a su bstitute for 
reporting an AE/SAE if an AE/SAE has occurred related to or 
concurrent with the pregnancy .  In the situation when an 
AE/SAE has occurred, the AE/SAE reporting procedures 
described in  Section 1.7.[ADDRESS_755961] also be followed.

Objectives  Insertion • To evaluate the bioanalytical concentrations of 
atorvastatin and its metabolites     New exploratory objective for the determinations of the concentrations of atorvastatin 
and its metabolites.  
Synopsis 
Number of Subjects (Planned)  
 Approximately 80 subjects with biopsy -confirmed 
NASH and evidence of liver fibrosis, but no hepatic 
decompensation, who meet eligibility criteria, will be 
randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 4 treatment 
groups.  A maximum of 20% of subjects will have 
stage 4 fibrosis.  Approximately 80 subjects with biopsy -confirmed 
NASH and evidence of liver fibrosis, but no hepatic decompensation, who meet eligibility criteria, will be 
randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 4 treatment 
groups.  A maximum of 30% of subject s will have 
stage 4 fibrosis.  The rapid rate of enrollment of subjects with stage 4 fibrosis allowed patients already in 
screening to be enrolled after 
the initial maximum of 20% was met (the overall number of 
subjects remains at ~ 80).

evidence of liver fibrosis, but no hepatic decompensation, will be included in this study.  A 
maximum of 20% of subjects will have stage 4 f ibrosis. Approximately 80 subjects who meet the eligibility 
criteria, including biopsy -confirmed NASH and 
evidence of liver fibrosis, but no hepatic decompensation, will be included in this study.  A 
maximum of 30% of subjects will have stage 4 
fibrosis. The rapid rate of enrollment of 
subjects with stage 4 fibrosis 
allowed patients already in screening to be enrolled after

 Main Study:  
This is a Phase 3b, randomized, open -label, pragmatic, multicenter study to evaluate 
efficacy  and safety of the fixed -dose combination tablets of  glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_636753]5A -inhibitor plus sofosbuvir  ± RBV -experienced, chronic 
HCV GT1 -infected subjects.  Up to  225 subjects at approximately 35  sites will be 
enrolled into four study arms A,  B, C and D.  Up to 150 non-cirrhotic  subjects will be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Arms A  and B, and  up to 75 subjects w ith compensated 
cirrhosis will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Arms C and D.  Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_545764] 1 subtype (1b or non -1b). 
 Subjects without cirrhosis will be randomized 2:1 to:  
Arm A:  G/P 300 mg /120 mg QD for 12 weeks  
Arm B:  G/P 300 mg/120  mg QD for 16 weeks  
Subjects with compensated cirrhosis will be randomized 1:1 to:  
Arm C:  G/P 300 mg/120  mg QD + weight -based RBV BID (1000  mg or 1200  
mg total daily dose) for 12 weeks  
Arm D:  G/P 300 mg/[ADDRESS_851308] the option to

Page 8 of 123  Resistance : 
The following information will be tabulated and summarized:  1) for all subjects with 
available samples, the polymorphisms in NS3 and NS5A (and NS5B for those subjects  
enrolled in the Ret reatment s ub-study who experience virologic failure) at baseline at 
resistance -associated amino acid positions relative to the appropriate prototypic 
reference sequence , and the impact of baseline polymorphisms on SVR 12; and 2) for 
subjects who do not achieve SVR 12, all post -baseline substitutions in the NS3 and 
NS5A (and N S5B for tho se subjects enrolled in the Ret reatment s ub-study) relative to 
baseline.  
Safety:   
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_12902], physical 
examinations, clinical laboratory tests, and vital signs.  
Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
Page 9 of 123  Statistical Methods : 
The mITT population for the Main Study will be all subjects enrolled in the Main 
Study receiving at least one dose of study drug categorized according to the treatment 
arm in which they were actually treated , and the Evaluable Patient  Population f or the 
Retreatment sub-study ( EP-RS) will  be all subjects who receive at least one dose of 
G/P and of SOF in the Retreatment sub-study.  
Efficacy :   
The primary  efficacy  endpoints for the mITT population are  the difference in SVR 12 
(HCV  RNA  < LLOQ  [ADDRESS_851310] actual  dose of study  drug) rates between 
Arm A and Arm B in non -cirrhotic subjects, and difference in SVR 12 rates between 
Arm C and Arm D in cirrhotic subjects.   
The difference in SVR 12 rates will be summarized with a two-sided 95% confidence 
interval for the comparison between Arm A and Arm B in non -cirrhotic subjects, and 
for the comparison between Arm C and Arm D in cirrhotic subjects. The number and 
percentage of subject s achieving SVR 12 by [CONTACT_636793] t o final treatment 
arm assignment of subjects will also be summarized with a two -sided 95% confidence 
interval. The confidence interval for the difference in SVR  12 rates will be calculated 
using Wilson’s score method. The confidence interval for the SVR12  rates by 
[CONTACT_636794]12  is at least 5. If the 
number of subjects who failed to achieve SVR12  is less than 5, Wilson’s score method 
will be used instead.  
The secondary efficacy variables are:  
1. The difference in SVR12 rates between G/P given for 12 weeks (Arm A and C 
combined) and G/P given for 16 weeks (Arm B and D combined) ;  
2. The percentage of subjects with on-treatment virologic failure;  
3. The percentage of subjects with post -treatment relapse.  
For the Main study, t he differences in the percentages  of subjects  with on-treatment  
virologic  failure or post -treatment relapse for non -cirrhotic subjects (Arm A vs Arm 
B) and subjects with compensated cirrhosis (Arm C vs Arm D) will be summarized 
along with 95% Wilson score intervals.  Additional efficacy endpoints and efficacy  
subgroup analyses w ill be performed.  
As an additional efficacy endpoint , the percentage of retreated subjects achieving 
SVR 12 will be analysed  on the EP-RS population overall  for the Retreatment sub-
study. 
 
Protocol

Page 10 of 123  DAA Resistance : 
For all subjects receiving study drugs and with available samples, the polymorphisms 
at resistance -associated amino acid positions in the NS3 and NS5A (and NS5B for 
those subjects en rolled in the Retreatment sub-study who experience virologic failure ) 
proteins at baseline identified by [CONTACT_636795]-generation  sequencing 
(NGS) and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence will be 
analyzed.  The impact of baseline polymorphisms on SVR [ADDRESS_851311] -baseline sample with HCV 
RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL:  1) the amino acid substitutions  in NS3 and NS5A  (and NS5B fo r 
those subjects enrolled in the Re treatment s ub-study who experience virologic failure ) 
in available post -baseline samples identified by [CONTACT_636796], 2) the amino acid substitutions in NS3 and 
NS5A (and NS5B for tho se subjects enrolled in the Ret reatment s ub-study who 
experience virologic failure ) in available post -baseline samples at resistance -
associated posit ions identified by [CONTACT_636797], and 3) the persistence of viral 
substitutions by [CONTACT_636798] .

Page 11 of 123  Safety :   
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drugs will be included in the safety 
analyses.  Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA)  and will be summarized by [CONTACT_1130]’s final treatment arm 
assignment .  Safety summaries will be provided by [CONTACT_636799]-study.  The number and percentage of subjects 
with treatment -emergent adverse events (i.e., any event that begins or worsens in 
severity after initiation of study drug) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_636800] (SOC).  The tabulation of the number of subjects with treatment -emergent 
adverse events also will be provided by [CONTACT_187799].  Change 
from baseline in laboratory tests to each time point of c ollection will be summarized  
by [CONTACT_1130]’s final treatment arm  assignment . Laboratory  values that show an increase 
in CTCAE grade will be summarized.

Approximately 170 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus 
(HCV), including approximately 4 -5 million in the [LOCATION_002].1-4  The majority of individuals 
infected progress to chronic hepatitis, which can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC).[ADDRESS_851326] acting anti -

  Overview of G/P Registration Program and Supportive Studies  
The G/P registration program included a broad subject population including subjects with 
compensated liver disease and subjects with severe renal insufficiency across all 6 major 
genotypes using a sin gle dose of 300 mg/120 mg QD.  Supportive Phase 2 studies used the Phase 
2 formulation of separate GLE and PIB tablets, with each tablet containing 100 mg and 40 mg, 
respectively.  Treatment arms from these supportive Phase 2 studies using the regimen selected 
for reg istration studies (GLE 300 mg plus PIB 120 mg) were pooled with arms from the 
registration studies for analyses of efficacy and safety.  Treatment -naïve (TN) and TE subjects to 
any combination of pegylated IFN (pegIFN), RBV, sofosbuvir (SOF), NS5A inhibito rs, or PIs 
were allowed in the program.  In addition, the program included subjects with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection (Study M13 -590), subjects with chronic kidney 
disease [CKD] Stages 4 – 5, including those on hemodialysis (Study M15 -462), subjects with 
compensated cirrhosis (Studies M14 -172, M15 -462, and M14 -868), and subjects with or without 
cirrhosis who failed a previous regimen containing an NS5A inhibitor and/or an NS3/4A PI 
(Study M15 -410).  
 
A total of 2,376 subjects were randomize d or enrolled in the registration studies or supportive 
Phase 2 studies to receive G/P 300 mg QD /[ADDRESS_851329] 
1 dose of G/P 300 mg QD/120 mg QD (Table  1).

Protocol  
B16-[ADDRESS_851332] of Baseline Polymorphisms on Treatment Outcome  
 
The association between baseline polymorphisms and treatment outcome in TN and TE -PRS 
subjects who received G /P 300 mg /120 mg QD in the registration or supportive Phase  2 studies 
was evaluated by [CONTACT_308131].  Next -generation 
sequencing (NGS) was conducted on all baseline samples  at 15% detection threshold at key 
amino acid positions 155, 156, and 168 in NS3, and 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, and 93 in NS5A.  
 
In subjects who were TN or TE -PRS, baseline polymorphisms in NS3 were detected in 1.1% 
(9/845), 0.8% (3/398), 1.6% (10/613), 1.2 % (2/164), 41.9% (13/31), and 2.9% (1/34) of subjects 
with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 infection, respectively.  Baseline polymorphisms in NS5A 
were detected in 26.8% (225/841), 79.8% (331/415), 22.1% (136/615), 49.7% (80/161), 12.9% 
(4/31), and 54.1%  (20/37) of subjects with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 infection, 
respectively.  
 
The presence of baseline polymorphisms in NS3 and/or NS5A did not have an impact on SVR [ADDRESS_851333] on treatment outcome.  
3.1.3  Amino Acid Substitutions in Subjects Experiencing Virologic Failure  
 
Among TN and TE -PRS subjects with or  without cirrhosis treated for 8, 12, or 16  weeks, 23 
subjects experienced virologic failure (2 with GT1, 2  with GT2, and 19 with GT3).  One GT3 -
infected subject experiencing virologic failure was determined to have been re -infected with 
GT3a virus distinc t from the one present at baseline.  Therefore, baseline polymorphisms and 
treatment -emergent substitutions were analyzed for 22  subjects experiencing virologic failure.  
 
Among the 2 GT1 -infected subjects, 1 had treatment -emergent substitutions A156V in N S3 and 
Q30R/L31M/H58D in NS5A, and 1 had treatment -emergent Q30R/H58D (while Y93N was 
present at baseline and post -treatment) in NS5A.  
Among the 2 GT2 -infected subjects, no treatment -emergent substitutions were observed in NS3 
Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
Page 26 of 123  or NS5A; the prevalent M31 po lymorphism in NS5A was present at baseline and post -treatment 
in both subjects.  
 
Among the 18 GT3 -infected subjects, the majority of subjects had treatment -emergent variants at 
the time of failure in NS3 (61.1%, 11/18) and NS5A (88.9%, 16/18).  Treatment -emergent NS3 
substitutions Y56H/N, Q80K/R, A156G, and Q168L/R were observed in [ADDRESS_851334] -treatment in 5  subjects.  Treatment -emergent 
NS5A substitutions M28G, A30G/K, L31F, P58T, or Y93H  were observed in 16 subjects, and 13 
subjects had A30K (n = 9) or Y93H (n = 5) at both baseline and post -treatment.  
3.1.4  Integrated Safety Results  
 
A summary of treatment -emergent adverse events (AEs) from pooled analyses of the registration 
studies and  supportive Phase 2 studies are presented in Table  3.  The severity of the underlying 
renal disease and its associated comorbidities in patients with CKD Stages 4 and 5, the frequency 
and severity of the AEs in subjects enrolled Study  M15 -462 w ere expected to be higher than in 
subjects enrolled in the other registration studies.  Therefore, the summary of adverse events 
reported in Table  3 does not include the results of Study M15 -462. 
 
As shown in Table  3, the AEs occurring with a frequency ≥ 5% are headache, fatigue, nausea and 
diarrhea .  The majority of subjects experienced an AE, which were mostly considered to be mild 
in severity by [CONTACT_093] (Grade 1).  Rates of AEs that were serious, led to premature study 
drug discontinuation or had a severity Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_851335] dose of study drug.

Adverse events in subjects without cirrhosis (n = 1,977) were similar in type, frequency, and 
severity compared with subjects with cirrhosis (n = 288).  The safety profile  in subjects with 
HCV/HIV -1 co-infection (n = 33) was similar to that in HCV mono -infected subjects.  Overall, the 
safety profile of G/P in the elderly population (≥ 65 years old, n = 328) was comparable to the 
safety profile in the non -elderly population (n = 2,041).  
The frequency and severity of hepatic -related AEs as well as liver chemistry abnormalities 
evaluating potential hepatotoxicity were low across the Phase 2 and 3 studies.  Liver -related safety 
results indicated that:  
• Four subjects had post -nadir Grade 3 ALT abnormalities or Grade 2 ALT with total 
bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN.  None of these subjects prematurely discontinued study drug due to 
an ALT or bilirubin increase.  
• ALT abnormalities in 3 of these 4 subjects were not clinically significant  
Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
Page 28 of 123  • One subject experienced concurrent ALT > 3 × ULN (increased from nadir grade) and 
total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN in the context of multiple gallstones and was not considered  to 
have drug -induced liver injury  
• Based on exposure -response analyses, no exposure -depe ndent ALT increases were 
observed in subjects with ALT abnormalities  
• Grade 3 increases in bilirubin were infrequent (0.4%) and without bilirubin -related AEs; 
none were associated with liver disease progression  
• No subjects experienced drug -related hepatic decompensation.  One  subject with cirrhosis 
(Study  M14 -172) who had known esophageal varices experienced an epi[INVESTIGATOR_636758].  Treatment 
was continued without clinical or laboratory sign s of liver disease progression.   
• A total of 6 (0.3%) subjects experienced a de novo event of HCC.  In all [ADDRESS_851336]'s medical history of underlying liver disease and 
not to G/P.   
 
In summary, G/P demonstrated a favorable safety profile simi lar across durations of 8, 12, and [ADDRESS_851337] and diverse population of subjects, 
including subjects with cirrhosis, HIV co -infection, and CKD Stage  4 or 5.  
Common study drug -related AEs occurring in ≥ 5% of su bjects were headache, fatigue, nausea and 
were mostly Grade 1 (mild) in severity.  Serious AEs and AEs leading to premature study drug 
discontinuation were rare.  There were no hematological or blood chemistry findings of concern or 
considered likely relat ed to treatment.  Unlike other protease inhibitors, no liver -related toxicities 
and no cases consistent with drug -induced liver injury were identified.  
 
G/P+SOF+ /-RBV for G /P treatment  failures  
[COMPANY_013] has recently evaluated the safety and efficacy of G/P+S OF+/-RBV in combination in 
patients who had virologic failure following G/P treatment in [COMPANY_013]’s registration program.  The 
MAGELLAN -3 study (M15 -942) is ongoing and reported  to date on a total of 23 subjects  
including 7 G T1-infected  patients treated for 16 weeks with G/P+SOF+RBV ; 6/7 achieved an 
SVR 12 (86%) .  The patient who experienced virologic failure  relapsed, had GT1a infection ,

study MAGELLA N-1 (M15 -410), where the patient  experienced on -treatment failure.  Overall, t he 
7 GT1-infected  patients enrolled in MAGELLAN -3 had a median of 9 months (min: 6.7/max: 14) 
from time of G/P failure in the [COMPANY_013] parent study to start of retreatment in MAGEL LAN -3 and 
all had persistent NS5 A RAS s at baseline prior  to retreatment with G/P+SOF+RBV.  Retreatment 
with G/P+SOF+RBV was well tolerated.  There have been no serious adverse events attributed to 
the retreatment regimen  and no Grade [ADDRESS_851338] common adverse events in >10% 
of subjects were  headache, pruritus, dizziness, irritability, fatigue, insomnia and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_19629].  There was one grade [ADDRESS_851339]  with an SAE of chole lithiasis 
that was consistent with biliary obstruction.24   
 
 
3.2  Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir  (LDV/ SOF)  
 
LDV/SOF  is a single tablet combining LDV, an NS5A inhibitor, with SOF a nucleotide analog 
HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor, that was the first fixed dose combi nation of an all oral  DAA  
regimen approved in the US for genotype 1 patients. In the registration clinical trials with 
LDV/SOF, the treatment combination resulted in high SVR rates (≥ 94%) following 8 -24 weeks of 
treatment in treatment -naïve and pegIFN and RBV  treatment -experience d subjects, irrespective of 
cirrhosis, yet still some patients fail this therapy.14  Subjects with HCV genotype 1 that failed eight 
or twelve weeks of LDV/SOF -containing regimens that were retreated with 24 weeks of LDV/SOF 
had an SVR12 rate of 71% and in this population, the presence of baseline NS5A RAVs was 
associated with virologic failure15.  Post-baseline NS5A and NS5B deep nucleotide sequence 
analysis data (assay sensitivity of 1%) from the 29 genotype 1a LDV/SOF virologic failure subjects 
from Phase  3 showed that 55% (16/29) of subjects had virus with emergent NS5A resistance -
associated substitutions (RAS) K24R, M28T/V, Q30R/H/K/L, L31M, or Y93H/N at failure.  Five 
of these 16 subjects’ viruses also had baseline NS5A polymorphisms at resistance -assoc iated amino 
acid positions. The most common substitutions detected at failure were Q30R, Y93H or N, and 
L31M. Of the 8 genotype 1b virologic failure subjects, 88% (7/8) had virus with emergent NS5A 
resistance -associated substitutions L31V/M/I or Y93H at fa ilure. Virus from three of these [ADDRESS_851340] 
common substitution detected at failure was Y93H.14  
 
In the HCV -TARGET observational cohort , treatment failure occurred in 3 -5% o f 2,099 patients 
treated with LDV/SOF17. Treatment failure was more likely in those with cirrhosis, more advanced 
disease (low albumin and higher bilirubin), and those on concurrent proton pump inhibitors. It can 
be expected that as more patients are treat ed with DAA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], particularly with the widespread 
use of LDV/SOF, the need for retreatment options for patients who fail will increase.  
 
3.3  PRIORITIZE Study and HCV -TARGET  
 
The PRIORITIZE study and HCV -TARGET represent real -world cohorts to provide well -
characterized patients for a DAA failure clinical trial. In the PRIORITIZE Study approximately 
1250 GT1 patients without a history of decompensated cirrhosis will be randomized to receive 
LDV/SOF, and have virologic, clinical, disease progress ion, and  QOL/PRO data collected for a [ADDRESS_851341] a 
sample collected for re sistance testing. Assuming a 5% treatment failure rate, PRIORITIZE will 
generate approximately 65 LDV/SOF treatment failures. HCV -TARGET is an observational cohort 
of patients undergoing DAA therapy. To date, approximately 7,[ADDRESS_851342] been enrolled into HCV -TARGET.  Among HCV -TARGET centers, there are more 
than 450 G1 therapy failures, 300 of which failed therapy with an NS5a -I+SOF and represent 
another cohort of DAA failures. Between these two studies, well -characterized NS5a-I/SOF 
failures will be identified to form a unique cohort to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_636759].  
 
3.4  Study Rationale   
 
The FDA approved label duration for NS5A -experienced, PI -naïve subjects with or without 
compensated cirrhosis  and HCV GT1 chronic infection  is G/P 300 mg/120 mg for 16 weeks.23 
However, the G/P regimen may be further refined  based on additional efficacy results in subsets of 
Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
Page 31 of 123  NS5A inhibitor experienced , PI-naïve HCV GT1 infected subjects . The goals of this study are to 
increas e the confidence in real world DAA failure patients who are receiving the recommended 
G/P regimen , to explore a shorter 12-week duration of the G/P regimen in non -cirrhotic subjects , 
and ribavirin-intensification of a shorter 12 -week duration of the G/P re gimen  in subjects with 
compensated cirrho sis. 
 
 
High SVR12 rates were achieved with G/P 300 mg/120 mg when given for 12 and 16 weeks in 
GT1-infected subjects who were NS5A -experienced  and PI-naive (SVR12 90.0% 18/20 and 94% 
17/18, respectively, MAGELLAN -1, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [COMPANY_013], data on file). The majority of 
subjects with prior NS5A inhibitor -experience in MAGELLAN -1 Part 1 & 2 combined were 
subjects who failed prior LDV/SOF (Harvoni) treat ment: GLE/PIB 300 mg/ 120 mg for 12 weeks 
(n=12, 11 achieved SVR12, 91.7%), GLE/PIB 300 mg/ 120 mg for 16 weeks (n=10, 9 achieved 
SVR12, 90.0%), and G/P 300 mg/ 120 mg plus 800 mg once daily RBV for 12 weeks (n=4, all 4 
achieved SVR12). Among the 42 NS5A -experienced and PI -naïve failures enrolled in 
MAGELLAN -1, 30/31 (96.8%) subjects without cirrhosis and 9/11 (81.8%) of subjects with 
compensated cirrhosis achieved an SVR12.  
 
In MAGELLAN -1, NS5A  inhibitor -experienced, PI -naïve subjects without cirrhosis wh o received 
G/P 300 mg/120 mg for 12 and 16 weeks achieved SVR12 rates of 92.3% (12/13) and 100% 
(14/14), respectively.  As the difference in SVR12 between these two durations was based on a 
single subject that did not achieve SVR, it is hypothesized that 1 2 weeks treatment duration with 
G/P may provide an effective retreatment option.  Therefore, the present study will evaluate G/P 
for 12 and 16 weeks in a larger patient population to determine if treatment duration may be 
decreased from 16 to 12 weeks in N S5A inhibitor -experienced, PI -naïve subjects without cirrhosis . 
 
MAGELLAN -1 enrolled a total of 11 NS5A  inhibitor -experienced, PI -naïve subjects with 
compensated cirrhosis; 85.7% (6/7) and 75.5% (3/4) subjects achieved SVR12 with G/P 300 
mg/120 mg for 12 or 16 weeks, respectively.  The two subjects that did not achieve SVR12 
experienced on -treatment virologic failure and may benefit from the addition of RBV which has 
Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
Page 32 of 123  been shown to decrease the risk of both on -treatment failure and relapse.16 Therefore, the  present 
study will evaluate G/P for 16 weeks and G/P + RBV for 12 weeks in NS5A  inhibitor -experienced, 
PI-naïve subjects with compensated cirrhosis.  
 
The objective of this study is therefore to obtain additional data with G/P in NS5A  
inhibitor –experience d, PI -naïve GT1 -infected subjects that will help to optimize the G/P regimen 
for this population.  The initial study design did  not exclude patients with historical PI [INVESTIGATOR_636760]5A -inbitor exposure as PI [INVESTIGATOR_636761] s, 
but did exclude only those who received a PI [INVESTIGATOR_184803] a  NS5a.  Since the initial study 
launch, G/P has been approved by [CONTACT_636801] a label for NS5A experienced, PI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve 
patients  only; with  [ADDRESS_851343] their treat ment extended to 16 weeks  duration . 
 
In addition to LDV/SOF -treatment experienced subjects , velpatasvir  (VEL) /sofosbuvir  (VEL/SOF) 
and daclatasvir  (DCV)/sofosbuvir -experienced subjects  will be included.  While there is clinical 
evidence that G/P retreatment of LDV/SOF failures can achieve high SVR rates (see above), there 
is no clinical data for G/P in VEL /SOF - or DC V/SOF -experienced subjects. NS5A substitution 
Y93H has been observed in GT1 and GT3 treatment failures with SOF/VEL and confers greater 
than 100 -fold reduction in velpatasvir in -vitro susceptibility.19  In GT1a -infected  subjects who 
failed a DCV/SOF   regimen NS5A resistance -associated sub stitutions (including pre -existing 
amino acid polymorphisms or treatment -emergent substitutions): M28T, Q30H/K/R, L31M/V, 
H54R, H58D/P, or Y93C/N were observed. In GT1b failure s the P32 -deletion was observed. 
Among HCV genotype 1a -infected  virologic failur e subjects, the most common NS5A amino acid 
substitutions occurred at position Q30 (Q30H/K/R; 73% [8/11], all treatment -emergent) .  
Phenotypic analysis of genotype 1a replicons expressing single NS5A M28T, Q30E, Q30H, Q30R, 
L31V, Y93C, Y93H, and Y93N subst itutions exhibited 500 - [ZIP_CODE] -, 1083 -, 900 -, 2500 -, 1367 -, 
8500 -, and [ZIP_CODE] -fold reduced susceptibility to DCV , respectively. For genotype 1b, L31V and 
Y93H single substitutions and L31M/Y93H and L31V/Y93H combinations exhibited 33 -, 30-, 
Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
Page 33 of 123  [ZIP_CODE] -, and [ZIP_CODE] -fold reduced susceptibility to DCV , respectively. The P32-deletion in genotype 
1b reduced DCV susceptibility by >1,000,000 -fold.20  None of the  studied single NS5A 
substitutions in GT1 at positions 28, 30, 31, and 93 reduced susceptibility to  PIB by [CONTACT_726] 6 -7 
fold22, and there was no single NS5A baseline polymorphism that was associated with a reduced 
SVR12 rate in GT1 -infected  subjects in the G/P Phase 3 trials  (Section 3.1.2) .  Furthermore, and 
given the different mechanism of action of GLE when  compared to SOF and no  cross -resistance 
between SOF and GLE , and GLE with  any NS5A inhibitor, the G/P regimen ± RBV should 
provide high SVR rates for VEL /SOF or DCV /SOF-experienced subjects.  
 
In this study, prior GT1 -infected NS5A  inhibitor  + SOF -experien ced subjects without cirrhosis will 
be randomized 2:1 to receive G/P for 12 or 16 weeks.  Prior GT1 -infected NS5A  inhibitor  + SOF -
experienced  subjects with compensated cirrhosis will be randomized 1:1 to receive 12 weeks of 
G/P with RBV or 16 weeks of G/P.   
 
In the first several years of HCV DAA therapy, more than 50% of patients undergoing treatment 
had evidence of cirrhosis.  With rapid upta ke of HCV treatment in this cirrhotic patient population, 
the prevalence of cirrhosis among untreated persons with HCV has decreased substantially to only 
15 to 20%.  This shift in the characteristics of patients  presenting for HCV treatment in the US is 
reflected in several other studies including the PRIORITIZE Study mentioned previously (16% 
cirrhosis in over 1200 patients enrolled) and the HCV -TARGET observational registry (15% 
cirrhosis currently with 40% cirrhosis historically). Similar trends in the types of patients treated 
using pharmacy databases (such as TRIO) are evident.  Among  the first 130 patients screened for 
this study, 65% have been non -cirrhotic , reflecting the current real -world treatment population in 
DAA failure patients.   Thus, t he pa tient randomization targets have been adjusted and nearly 70% 
non-cirrhotic patients are expected to enroll in this study , thereby [CONTACT_636802].    
 
In the main  study, patients without cirrhosis will be treated with G/P f or either 16 or 12 weeks.  
Patients with compensated cirrhosis will be treated for 16 weeks with G/P or 12 weeks with G/P + 
ribavirin.  Ribavirin is an FDA approved drug that is used in combination with other HCV 
Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
Page 34 of 123  treatments. The approved G/P treatment dura tion for prior GT1 -infected NS5A inhibitor failures 
that are NS3/4A inhibitor naïve and are non -cirrhotic or have compensated cirrhosis is 16 weeks. In 
addition to the approved G/P treatment duration of 16 weeks, a 12 -week duration of G/P without 
and with ribavirin is tested for non -cirrhotic and compensated cirrhotic patients, respectively. These 
later treatment arms are considered experimental.  
 
3.4.1 Rationale for Retreatment of G/P Failures in this Study  
 
Combining drugs with different mechanisms of action can increase the probability of achieving a 
sustained virologic response in HCV -infected patients who have failed one or more prior DAA 
therapy.  Data from GT1 -infected  patients in the M AGELLAN -3 study wh o failed prior G/P 
therapy support the use of the combination of G/P+SOF ±RBV as a viable , well -tolerated 
retreatment option.  
 
3.5  Rationale for Pragmatic Design in Phase 3b Study using HCV -TARGET 
Network and Methods  
 
The Medicare National Coverage Decisio n for Clinical Trials provides for a national coverage 
policy covering the routine costs for items and services given to a patient as part of a clinical trial 
(see Appendix B ) setting the stage to implement clinical  research studies under standard of care 
practice.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], trials designed for regulatory approval are highly controlled and restrictive in 
the patients studied.  By [CONTACT_636803] 3b drug development, drug safety and efficacy are 
established fr om earlier trials yet drugs arrive in the post -marketing environment lacking 
information needed by [CONTACT_447] -regulatory decision -makers (providers, patients, payers) to guide 
treatment and coverage decisions (no established “real -world” effectiveness).   In 200 9, the 
Center for Medical Technology Policy (CMTP) convened a large meeting of experts and 
stakeholders, including the US FDA, to seek input to develop a guidance document to develop 
and implement informative, pragmatic phase 3/3b pharmaceutical trials tha t satisfy the regulatory 
requirements of the FDA (Effectiveness Guidance Document - Pragmatic Phase 3 
Pharmaceutical Trials:  Recommendations for the design of clinical trials that are more 
Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
Page 35 of 123  informative for patients, clinicians and payers ).  The FDA has issu ed guidance related to Real 
World Evidence (RWE) use in regulatory decision -making and have stated that “It is important 
that FDA consider the possibilities of using so -called “real world” data as an important tool in 
evaluating not only the safety of medi cations but also their effectiveness.” The advantage of 
RWE is to produce information needed by [CONTACT_7620] -regulatory decision makers, which avoids 
delays in coverage decisions and speeds access to beneficial new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_24305] a broad range of 
patients. Domai ns that are most necessary for making post -regulatory decisions that are often 
missing from traditional regulatory trials include generalizability of patient population and 
consistently measured, relevant outcomes.  
 
The HCV -TARGET cohort study has grown in to extensive partnership between its academic & 
community centers, the pharmaceutical industry, an HCV community advocate and the FDA.   
The registry has enrolled over 10,[ADDRESS_851344] this 
study. With the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) residing at the University of [LOCATION_012] (PI: 
[CONTACT_30294]) and Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel H ill 
(PI: [INVESTIGATOR_636762]), HCV -TARGET developed standardized, centralized chart data abstraction methods 
along with data monitoring to increase the efficiency and quality of an observational registry 
while also minimizing costs typi[INVESTIGATOR_636763] p ost-marketing clinical 
research.  The network hosts databases that are CFR 21 Part 11 compliant and includes MEDRA 
adverse event and WHO drug dictionary coding standardization.  It also has a CDISC compliant 
database allowing the data to be shared directly  with the FDA for analyses around safety and 
efficacy as part of a formal MOU (# 225-13-0012 ) executed in [ADDRESS_851345] as an Investigator Coordinating Organization (ICO) to implement 
this unique approach to non -IND clinical trials using unlabelled  combinations of approved drugs 
and post marketing commitment studies as well as Treatment IND Protocols for Large Population 
Expanded Access Programs (EAP) and late 3b pragmatic clinical trials related to HCV the rapy.

3.6  Benefits and Risks  
 
Main Study  
Potential  benefits  of treatment  with G/P in a NS5A -inhibitor +SOF treatment failure population 
include:   
1. Potential for high SVR in a population with limited treatment options (high unmet need)  
based on results from MAGELLAN -[ADDRESS_851346] generation  protease  and NS5A  inhibitors,  
and the convenience  of a once daily  regimen.  
3. The benefit of shortened therap y for some subjects  
4. The benefit of evaluating a RBV -intensified DAA regimen  
 
The safety of G/P has been  established in a diverse population of patients with and without 
compensated cirrhosis in Phase II an d III clinical trials ( Section 3.1.4 ) and the ov erall AE profile 
supports a safe regimen. The most common AEs  in greater than 10% of subjects include  
headache  and fatigue.   Additional Safety data for G/P and G/P plus RBV are detailed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure  (applicable to Main Study Only)  and Prescribing Information . The safety 
profile of Ribavirin is well established. RBV is a teratogen (pregnancy category X) and the 
primary  toxicity in subjects is reversible hemolytic anemia21. In addition, subjects may 
experience inconvenience or discomfort related to the study visits or study procedures.  
Risks  associated  with the combination of  G/P±RBV , including  the risks  of toxicity,  virologic  failure  
and development  of resistan ce-associated  substitutions  (Section  3.1.3 ), appear  to be limited  and 
manageable  based  upon  the available  data.  Given  the potential  for high rates of SVR  in this 
population  of HCV  GT 1-infected  subjects  with limited current treatment options , the risk-benefit  
assessment  is favorable.  
 
Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
Page 37 of 123  Re-treatment  sub-study  
Data from the MAGELLAN -3 study support the addition of SOF to G/P ±RBV as a retreatment 
option for G/P failures that was well tolerated.24 The risk s for treatment with  the combination of 
G/P+SOF ±RBV include the potential for toxicity, virologic failure and development of additional  
RASs. However, these risks appear to be limited based on available data . Given the potential for 
high rate of S VR in this difficult to treat population of HCV GT [ADDRESS_851347]  regarding  retreatment  options , the risk -benefit ratio is favorable.  
4.0 Study  Objective  
4.1 Primary  Objective  
 
The primary objectives of this study  are to :  
1. Compare the efficacy (SVR12) of G/P given for 12 weeks  to non-cirrhotic GT1-infected

Subjects in both the Main Study and the Retreatment sub-study will be consented and enrolled 
prospectively at participating sites . Subjects in the Main Study will be treated with open -label 
G/P +/ - RBV according to their randomization while subjects in the Retreatment Sub -Study will 
receive open -label G/P +/ - RBV + SO F.  As a pragmatic, phase 3b study  both Main and 
Retreatment Sub -Study subjects will be  managed clinically  per standard of care guidelines (based 
on AASLD/ISDA Guidelines f or HCV treatment8) for disease monitoring and HCV treatment .   
To standardize some processes  across all subjects , there is  protocol required lab safety and 
efficacy monitoring  along with required drug dispensing/drug reconciliation  intervals outside of 
standard of care . Source data is the original medical record collected as part of standard of care 
HCV treatment except for documentation of protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria, blood sample 
collection, drug dispensing/reconciliation and SAE reporting. All original clinic notes, telephone 
notes, safety and efficacy labs/evaluations collected during standard of care treatment and in the 
post treatment observation period are redacted and submitted according to a contract -defined 
schedule to a central data repo sitory at the University of [LOCATION_012] (UF).  Pertinent data from 
submitted source medical records is abstracted and entered into the database according to uniform 
guidelines by [CONTACT_636804].  In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_636764], e fficacy  and safety  outcomes  assessments  are recommended  as part of the subjects’

5.2.3  Guidance for Determination of Cirrhosis  
 
All patients will be evaluated for the presence of cirrhosis  and the final assessment will be 
made by [CONTACT_7880]  [INVESTIGATOR_636769] .  The presence of cirrhosis is defined at screening by 
[CONTACT_636809]/or a combination of clinical, laboratory, elastography, and imaging criteria 
established a priori .  For post -transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], cirrhosis determination will be made based 
on medical records post allograft.  
Patients w ill be determined to have cirrhosis if they have:  
 
1) evidence of stage 4 (Metavir) fibrosis by [CONTACT_636810] ;   
 
2) evidence of stage 3 (Metavir) fibrosis by [CONTACT_636811]  (for post -transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], biopsy staging must be from the 
allograft);   
• platelet count < 140x 109/L, 
• presence of esophageal varices on esophagogastroduodenoscopy  at any time  
     prior to screening,  
• evidence of cirrhosis and/or port al hypertension by [CONTACT_636812],  
• FibroTest®  >0.75 ,  
• Vibration -Controlled Transient Elastography (VCTE)  >12.5 kPa , or equivalent magnetic 
resonance elastography ( MRE ) compatible with stage 4 fibrosis

Page 53 of 123  3) in the absence of liver biopsy, any TWO  of the following criteria:  
•  platelet count < 140x 109/L during screening ,  
• presence of esophageal varices on esophagogastroduodenoscopy  at any time prior to 
screening ,  
• evidence of cirrhosis and/or portal hypertension by [CONTACT_636813] , 
•  FibroTest®  >0.75 ,  
•  AST:platelet ratio index (APRI) >2 during screening  
• Vibration -Controlled Transient Elastography (VCTE)  >12.5 kPa , or equivalent MRE 
compatible with stage 4 fibrosis  
 
If subjects do not meet any of the above definitions of cirrhosis, they will be considered non -
cirrhotic.  
5.2.4  Prior  and Concomitant  Therapy  
 
Any medication  or vaccine  (including  over-the-counter  or prescription  medicines,  vitamins  and/or  
herbal  supplements)  that the subject  is receiving  from  the time of signing  the consent , through  the 
Treatment  Period , and [ADDRESS_851376] medical care.  Where the reason for use 
of a concomitant medication  or the start/stop date  is missing from the submitted medical records, 
the site will be queried.  For the Main study , the investigator/designee  should  review  all 
concomitant  medications  for any potential  interactions with G/P  via the DDI tool and the 
MAVYRETTM Prescribing Information23.  For the Retreatme nt sub-study, the 
investigator/designee should review all concomitant medications for any potential interactions 
with G/P via the DDI tool and the MAVYRETTM Prescribing Information23, and also should 
review all concomitant medications for any potential interactions with sofosbuvir utilizing the 
SovaldiTM Prescrib ing Information.[ADDRESS_851377] dose of study  drugs.  Only  medications  taken  for 
SAEs  and for treatment  of HCV  will be recorded  thereafter.  
 
The medical monitor  should  be contact[CONTACT_636814][INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Subjects with HIV -1/HCV co -infection must be on  a stable, qualifying HIV -[ADDRESS_851378] one of the ARV agents as per Inclusion Criterion 9 (Section  5.2.1 ). 
Subjects will maintain the same dose and dosing interval of their HIV -[ADDRESS_851379] be discussed with the medical monitor prior to the change, unless the 
change is being made to address an immediate safety concern.  
 
Subjects receiving any other HIV -1 ART in addition to those listed in Inclusion  Criterion 9 
(Section 5.2.1 ) would not be eligible for enrollment in the study.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prior  HCV  Therapy  
 
Subjects must  be HCV  treatment -experienced with an NS5 A-inhibitor +SOF with or without 
RBV.  The subject may also have had  an additional past treatment  with any HCV regimen that 
did not include administration of a protease inhibitor .  
 
For subjects  who had multiple  HCV  treatment  courses,  the categorization  of previous  response  
category  will be based  on the NS5A inhibitor +SOF treatment.  
 
 
 
 
Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
Page 55 of 123   [IP_ADDRESS]  Concomitant  Therapy  
 
Subjects  should  be on stable  doses  of concomitant  medications  for at least 2 weeks  prior  to the 
initiation  of study  drugs.  The investigator  should  confirm  that a concomitant  
medication/supplement  can be safely  administered  with study  drugs.  Some  concomitant  
medications  may require  dose adjustments  due to the potential  for drug-drug interactions.  
 
During  the Post-Treatment  Period,  investigators  should  reassess  concomitant  
medications/supplements,  and subjects  may resume  previously  prohibited  
medications/supplements  or revert  to pre-study  doses  2 weeks  following  discontinuation  of study  
drugs  as applicable.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prohibited  Therapy  
 
Subjects  must  be able to safely  discontinue  any prohibited  medications  or supplements  listed  in 
Table [ADDRESS_851380] 2 weeks  or 10 half-lives (whichever  is longer)  prior  to the first  dose of any study

[IP_ADDRESS]  Study  Procedures  
 
Informed  Consent  
 
 Signed  study -specific  informed  consent  will be obtained  from  the subject  before  any study  
procedures  are performed.  Subjects who failed treatment in the Main study and elect 
participation in the Retreatment sub -study require additional informed consent before any 
procedure of the Retreatment sub -study is performed.  
 Medical  History , Physical Examinations, Vital Signs and Weight , Clinical  
Assessment  of Hepatic  Decompensation  
 
 All original clinic notes, telephone notes, locally available safety labs/evaluations and/or

points  from  Day 1 through  12 weeks  after completion  of treatment  in both the Main s tudy 
and the Retreatment sub -study . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary  Variable  
 
The primary  efficacy  variable  is SVR 12 (HCV  RNA  < LLOQ  [ADDRESS_851400] actual  
dose of study  drug).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary  Variable  
 
The secondary  efficacy  variables  are on-treatment  virologic  failure  and post-treatment  
relapse.  
5.3.3  Resistance  Variables  
 
For all subjects  receiving  G/P, the substitutions  at resistance -associated  amino  acid positions  
in NS3 and NS5A  at baseline  identified  by [CONTACT_636821] g or NGS  and comparison  
to the appropriate  prototypic  reference  sequence  will be analysed, along with the impact of 
baseline substitutions  on SVR12.  
 
For subjects enrolled in the Re treatment sub-study, the  substitutions  at resistance -associated  
amino  acid positions in NS3 and NS5A  (and NS5B for those subjects en rolled in the 
Retreatment sub -study who experience virologic failure)  at baseline  will be identified  by 
[CONTACT_636822] , compar ed to the appropriate  prototypic  reference  sequence , 
along with an analysis of  impact of baseline substitutions  on SVR12.    
 
The following  resistance  information  will be analyzed  for subjects  receiving  G/P who do not 
achieve  SVR [ADDRESS_851401]-baseline  sample  with HCV  RNA  ≥ 1000  IU/mL:  1) the 
amino  acid substitutions  in NS3 and NS5A  in available  post-baseline  samples  identified  by 
[CONTACT_636823],  2) the amino  acid 
[ADDRESS_851402]-baseline  samples  at resistance -associated  
positions  identified  by [CONTACT_636824],  and 3) the persistence  of viral resistance  by [CONTACT_636825] . 
 
For subjects enrolled in the Re treatment sub-study receiving G/P+SOF ±RBV  who 
experience virologic failure  and who have a post-baseline  sample  with HCV  RNA  ≥ 1000  
IU/mL the following  resistance  information  will be analyzed : 1) the amino  acid 
substitutions  in NS3, NS5A, and NS5B  in available  post-baseline  samples i dentified  by 
[CONTACT_636826],  2) the amino  acid 
substitutions in NS3, NS5A, and NS5B in available post -baseline samples  at resistance -
associated positions identified by [CONTACT_636827], and 3) the persistence of viral resistanc e by 
[CONTACT_636822].  
 
5.3.4  Safety  Variables  
 
The following  safety  evaluations  will be performed  during  the Main study  and the

Treatment Arm Efficacy Adjustment Criteria  
Based on interim virologic data , the following adjustments will be made to individual 
treatment arms  within the Main Study.  Treatment Arm Efficacy Adjustment Criteria do 
not apply to the Re treatment sub-study: 
1. If more than [ADDRESS_851408] 20 non -cirrhotic subjects with available HCV viral load data across Arms A 
and B , the virologic failures will be examined to determine if all new enrollment 
into the arms  should stop and if weight -based twice daily RBV (1000 mg <75 kg or 
1200 mg ≥75 kg body weight total daily dose)  should be added to the regimen for  
all future and current subjects in Arm A  and Arm B , or a subset of subjects in Arms 
A and B .   Similar analy ses will continue every two weeks  until all subjects in Arm s 
A and B  reach the end of treatment.  
2. If more than [ADDRESS_851409] 20 subjects across Arms A, B and D, the virologic failures will be examined to 
determine if weight -based twice daily RBV (1000  mg <75 kg or 1200  mg ≥75 kg 
body weight total daily dose) should  be added for all current and future patients in 
Arm D or a subset of subjects in Arm  D. Similar ana lyses will continue every two 
weeks  until all subjects in Arm s A, B and D reach the end of treatment.  
 
Treatment failures due to non -compliance with study drugs, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_636775], or other reasons for study drug interruptions will not count 
towards virologic failures.

PM). The maximal dose of RBV will not exceed 1200  mg per day for 16 weeks.   
*** RBV dosage form to be determined by  [CONTACT_636832] . 
 
Study drug dosing will be initiated at the Day 1 Visit  in the Main study and the 
Retreatment sub-study if applicable .  Study drug initiation does not need to be witnessed 
at the Day 1 visit. Based on Treatment Arm Efficacy Adjustment criteria in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS], if v irologic futility criteria are met, RBV dosing may be added to already ongoing 
or new initiation of G /P dosing in Arms A , B, or D.  
 
 
5.5.6  Blinding  
 
Both the Main  study  and Re treatment sub-study will be  open -label . 
 
5.5.7  Treatment  Compliance  
 
The investigator  or his/her  designated  and qualified  representatives  will administer/  
dispense  study  drug only to subjects  enrolled  in the study  in accordance  with the protocol.  
The study  drug must  not be used for reasons  other  than that described  in the protocol.  
 
At the start of the study,  each subject  should  receive  counselling  regarding  the importance  
of dosing  compliance  with the treatment  regimen  with regard  to virologic  response  and 
potential  development  of resistance  due to poor compliance.  
 
At each study  drug dispensing visit during  the Treatment  Period  denoted  in Table  5, 
subjects  will be instructed  to bring  all study  drug (full,  partial  or empty)  for assessment  of 
treatment  compliance.  Subjects will be instructed to dose from each bottle of study 
medication until the bottle  is empty . At post-baseline  dispensing  visits  denoted  in Table 
[ADDRESS_851415]  number  of remaining  
tablets *** of G/P and/or RBV  in the source.  Treatment  compliance  will be based  on the 
number  of tablets *** dispensed,  as recorded  in source  and the number  of remaining  
tablets ***.  
***RBV Dosage form to be determined by [CONTACT_636832].  
 
Dosing compliance will also be assessed for patients receiving treatment in the 
Retreatment sub-study.  In addition to G/P and RBV, accounting of SOF dosing will be 
completed and recorded in the study source.  
 
 
5.5.8 Drug  Accountability  & Destruction  
 
The investigator /designee will verify  that study  drug supplies  are received  intact  and in the 
correct  amounts.  A current  (running)  and accurate  inventory  of study  drug will be kept by 
[CONTACT_093] /designee and will include  lot number,  kit number, number  of tablets *** 
dispensed,  subject  number,  initials  of person  who dispensed  study  drug and date dispensed  
for each subject.  An overall  accountability  of the study  drug will be performed  and 
verified  by [CONTACT_10184].  Final  accountability  will be verified  by [CONTACT_636833] . 
 
Study  drug start dates  for each drug and the last dose of the regimen  will be documented  
in the subject's  source  documents.   
 
Upon  completion  of or discontinuation  from  the Treatment  Period,  all original  study  
drug  bottles  (containing  unused  study  drugs)  will be destroyed  at the study site or 
returned to [COMPANY_013]  (or its designee) . All unused study drugs can only be destroyed 
after being inspected and reconciled by [CONTACT_39613].  The number  of tablets *** of 
each type of study  drug returned  will be noted  in a drug accountability  log.  
79 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
 On-site destruction is preferred,  provided the following minimal standards are met:  
• On-site disposal practices must not expose humans to risks from the drug.  
• On-site disposal practices and procedures are in agreement with applicable laws and 
regulations, including any special requirements for controlled or hazardous 
substances.  
• Written procedures for on -site disposal are available and followed. The procedure s 
must be filed with the site’s SOPs and a copy provided to HCV -TARGET . 
• Records are maintained that allow for traceability of each container, including the 
date disposed of, quantity disposed, and identification of the person disposing the 
containers. Th e method of disposal, i.e., incinerator, licensed sanitary landfill, or 
licensed waste disposal vendor must be documented.  
• Accountability and disposal records are complete, up -to-date, and available for the 
monitor to review throughout the clinical trial  period.  
 
If conditions for destruction cannot be met , the responsible monitor will make 
arrangements for return of all unused and/or partially used study drug  to [COMPANY_013]  (or its 
designee) . 
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to arrange for di sposal of  all empty containers, 
provided that procedures for proper disposal hav e been established according to 
applicable federal, state, local, and institutional guidelines and procedures, and provided 
that appropriate records of disposal are kept .  Empty contain ers can only be destroyed on -
site or returned to [COMPANY_013] (or its designee)  after being inspected and reconciled by [CONTACT_636834] .  
***RBV Dosage Forms to be determined by [CONTACT_636832].

B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Risk  of Development  of Resistance -Associated Substitutions  
During  Combination  DAA  Trials  
 
In subjects treated with a DAA, variants with amino acid substitution(s) in the targeted 
protein conferring resistance to the DAA can be selected. For example, in [COMPANY_013]  HCV 
Phase 3 studies in which patients with GT1 infection were treated with the NS3/4A 
protease inhibitor paritaprevir and NS5A inhibitor ombitasvir, variants that conferred 
resistance to paritaprevir or ombitasvir were detected in patients experiencing virologic 
failure. While data from patients treated with the combination of G/P are limit ed, it is 
expected that PIB, will be able to suppress the appearance of virus containing resistance -
associated variants in NS3 that confer resistance to GLE , because there should not be any 
cross -resistance in variants resistant to DAAs targeting different  proteins. The converse is 
expected to be true as well – GLE  should be able to suppress the appearance of virus 
containing NS5A substitutions conferring resistance to PIB. In addition, in vitro resistant 
colony selection studies in HCV replicon cells conta ining GT1 – 6 NS5A demonstrated 
that PIB had a high genetic barrier to resistance – very few colonies were selected, and 
those that were selected contained NS5A substitutions that conferred only modest levels 
of resistance to  PIB. Based on accumulated clin ical and in vitro data to date, the risk of 
development of resistant variants to G/P is reduced when compared to treatment with first 
generation protease and NS5A inhibitors. Among the  2258 TN and TE -PRS subjects  
infected with GT1 -6 treated with GLE/PIB 30 0/120 mg included in the integrated 
resistance analysis from the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, only 22 (0.97%) experienced 
virologic failure.  Among these 22 subjects, treatment -emergent substitutions were 
detected in NS3 in 54.5% (12/22) and in NS5A in 81.8% (18/22) . Subjects frequently had 
multiple substitutions in NS5A at the time of failure indicating that , in contrast to first 
generation NS5A inhibitors,  single  substitutions in NS5A do not confer sufficient 
resistance to allow the virus to overcome PIB d rug pressure . These results support the 
prediction  that the risk of development of resistance -associated variants with GLE  and 
PIB combination treatment is low.  
For subjects enrolled in the Retreatment sub -study, exposure to SOF is not expected to 
result in development of resistant  viral variants, due to the high resistance barrier for 
SOF. In clinical studies  with LDV/SOF and SOF/VEL , only a small proportion of 
patients who experienced virologic failure had RASs that conferred resistance to SOF at 
[ADDRESS_851416] -treatment resistance from patients in 
phase II/II I clinical trials with LDV/SOF25 or SOF/VEL26, among 51/2144 (2.4%) and 
20/1778 (1.1%) patients  who experienced virologic failure , respectively, only [ADDRESS_851417]  be 
reported  to the Sponsor  (Section 6.2.2 ). For adverse  events,  please  refer to Section  6.1. 
For product  complaints,  please  refer to Section  6.2. 
6.[ADDRESS_851418] medical 
practice and  the AASLD HCV treatment guidelines.  The adverse events and actions 
taken (concomitant therapy, etc.) identified centrally in the submitted medical records 
generated as part of clinical care will be abstracted into the study database.  The HCV -
TARGET Abst raction Conventions manual will be used to assign adverse event start 
dates for any event abstracted from the medical record without a specific start date noted .  
 
6.1.1  Definitions  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse  Event  
 
An adverse  event  (AE)  is defined  as any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a patient  or 
clinical  investigation  subject  administered  a pharmaceutical  product  and which  does not 
necessarily  have  a causal  relationship  with this treatment.  An adverse  event  can therefore  
82 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
 be any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (including  an abnormal  laboratory  finding),  
symptom,  or disease  temporally  associated  with the use of a medicinal  (investigational)  
product,  whether  or not the event  is considered  causally  related  to the use of the treatment 
regimen . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious  Adverse  Events  
 
If an adverse  event  meets  any of the following  criteria,  it is to be reported  to the sponsor  as 
a SAE  within  24 hours  of the site being  made  aware  of the serious  adverse  event:  
Death of Subject   An event  that results  in the death  of a subject.  
Life-Threatening   An event  that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1072],  would  
have  resulted  in immediate  fatality  if medical  intervention  
had not been  taken.  This does not include  an event  that 
would  have  been fatal if it had occurred  in a more  severe  
form . 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_636776]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. 
This does not include an emergency room visit or 
admission to an outpatient facility.  
Congenital Anomaly   An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that  
results in fetal loss.  
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/Incapacity  
  An event  that results  in a condition  that substantially  
interferes  with the activities  of daily  living  of a study  
subject.  Disability  is not intended  to include  experiences  
of relatively  minor  medical  significance  such as headache,  
nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  influenza,  and accidental  
trauma  (e.g.,  sprained  ankle).  
Important  Medical  
Event  Requiring  
Medical  or Surgical  
Intervention  to 
Prevent  Serious  
Outcome  
  An important  medical  event  that may not be immediately  
life-threatening  or result  in death  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  but 
based  on medical  judgment  may jeopardize  the subject  and 
may require  medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  any 
of the outcomes  listed  above  (i.e., death  of subject,  life-
threatening,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  prolongation  of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  congenital  anomaly,  or persistent  or 
significant  disability/incapacity). Additionally,  any elective  
or spontaneous  abortion  or stillbirth  is                                                 
considered  an important  medical  event.  Examples  of such  
events  include  allergic  bronchospasm  requiring  intensive  
[ADDRESS_851419] be responded to within 24  hrs of receipt of the query.  
 
Minimum s upporting records required  for all SAE reports : 
1. Admit and Discharge note  
2. Daily consult with VS/PE  
3. All labs  
4. Imaging/procedure reports  
5. Medication Administration Record ( MAR ) 
 
For serious  adverse  events  with the outcome  of death,  the date and cause  of death  (if known)  
will be recorded  on the appropriate  case report  form.  The site will make all reasonable 
efforts to obtain a death or autopsy certificate, if available.  
 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8609]:  
• a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admis sion (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening 
event)  
• elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent  
• admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
• routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trendi ng of health status 
(e.g., routine colonoscopy)  
• medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to 
entry into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases  
• admission encountered for another life circumstance t hat carries no bearing on 
health  status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, 
economic inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative 
reason).  
 
84 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
 6.1.2  Adverse  Event  Severity  
 
For the purposes of this study, adverse events will be defined and coded centrally based 
on the following definitions:  
 
1. MILD:  Adverse events and/or symptoms recorded in the medical record where no 
therapy was given to treat the event or where an over -the-counter 
medication/interve ntion ONLY was given to treat the event.   
 
2. MODERATE : Adverse events and/or symptoms recorded in the medical record 
requiring prescription medication treatment or any dose reduction in study drug 
ribavirin.  
 
3. SEVERE:  Adverse events and/or symptoms requiring  any study drug  
discontinuation will be defined and coded as severe.  ANEMIA events requiring 
blood transfusion will be coded as severe.  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_851420]  to both G/P and/or RBV  in the Main 
study and both G/P + SOF and/or RBV in the Retreatment sub-study . The 
investigator /clinician designee  will use the following  definitions  to assess  the relationship  
of the adverse  event  to the use of study  drug(s): 
Reasonable  
Possibility  
 An adverse  event  where  there  is evidence  to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the study  drug and the adverse  event.  
No Reasonable  
Possibility  
 An adverse  event  where  there  is no evidence  to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the study  drug and the adverse  event.  
 
For causality  assessments,  events  assessed  as having  a reasonable  possibility  of being  
related  to the study  drug will be considered  "associated."  Events  assessed  as having  no 
reasonable  possibility  of being  related  to study  drug will be considered  "not associated."  In 
85 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
 addition,  when  the investigator  has not reported  a causality  or deemed  it not assessable,  the 
sponsor will consider  the event  associated.  
 
For serious  adverse  events,  if an investigator's  opi[INVESTIGATOR_636777] "no reasonable  
possibility  of being  related  to study  drug"  an "Other"  cause  of event  must  be provided  by 
[CONTACT_093] /clinician designee . 
 
After adverse event data is abstracted from the submitted records, the site i nvestigator/ 
clinician designee  will be provided an adverse event listing to assess  relationship  of the 
adverse  event  to study  drug(s).  Site will be queried to provide adverse event stop 
dates/continuation for any adverse events for which no end date is evident in the 
submitted medical records during the Treatment Period and up to [ADDRESS_851421]-Treatment  Period,  only spontaneously  reported  
SAEs  will be collected  (non-serious  AEs will not be collected).  
 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the Main study  and the 
Retreatment sub -study (as applicable) , all SAEs, whether related or not related to study 
drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol -
specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period 
and through the final study visit . 
 
86 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
 If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new 
information  becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be submitted within 24 
hours using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.  
 
All SAEs sho uld be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
6.1.5 Serious Adverse  Event  Reporting  
 
In the event  of a serious  adverse  event,  whether  associated  with study  drug or not, the 
Investigator /designee  will notify  the Medical Monitor  within  24 hours  of the site being  
made  aware  of the serious  adverse  event  by [CONTACT_636835]:  
 
    HCV -TARGET REPORTING CONTACT [CONTACT_636836] (preferred method):   
FAX to:  
 
  For safety  concerns,  contact  [CONTACT_26281] : 
Primary HCV -TARGET Designated Physician:   MD  
Office:  
Email:   
The HCV -TARGET designated Physician must also report any serious adverse event to 
[COMPANY_013]  within 24 hours after receipt of the serious adverse event information from the 
study site.  
6.1.6 Pregnancy  
 
Female s ubjects  randomized or assigned to non -RBV containi ng regimen in Main study or 
Retreatment sub -study should  avoid  pregnancy  starting  with screening  and through  30 days 
after completion  of study  drug.  Female subjects randomized or assigned to RBV 
containing regimen in Main study or Retreatment sub -study should  avoid  pregnancy  
starting  with Screening  and through  6 months after  completion  of study  drug (or as per 

87 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
 local RBV label). Male subjects randomized to G/P in Main study or receiving G/P plus 
SOF in Retreatment sub -study and their partners should  avoid pregnancy starting with 
screening and through 30 days after completion of study drug.  Male subjects randomized 
or assigned to RBV containing regimen  in Main study or Retreatment sub -study  and their 
partners should avoid pregnancy starting with Scre ening and through 7 months after 
completion of study drug (or as per local RBV label).  
 
Pregnancy  in a study  subject  must  be reported  to the sponsor  within  1 working  day of the 
site becoming  aware  of the pregnancy  and should be reported to the Ribavirin Pregnancy 
Registry , as applicable . Administration  of G/P in Main study or G/P plus SOF in 
Retreatment sub-study may be continued  at the investigator's  discretion  after discussion  
with the subject,  if the benefit  of continuing  therapy  is felt to outweigh  the risk (Section  
5.4.1 ). If a subject  is discontinued,  the subject  will be monitored  for SVR  in the Post-
Treatment  Period  as described  in Section  5.1.[ADDRESS_851422]  and the outcome  of the 
pregnancy  will be collected  for pregnancies  occurring  up to 30 days after the end of 
treatment  for subjects receiving  a non-RBV containing regimen  or up to 6 months (female 
subjects) or 7 months (male subjects) after the end of treatment  for subjects r eceiving  a RBV 
containing regimen.  
 
Pregnancy  in a study  subject  is not considered  an adverse  event.  However,  the medical  
outcome  of an elective  or spontaneous  abortion,  stillbirth  or congenital  anomaly  is 
considered  a serious  adverse  event  and must  be reported  to the sponsor  within  [ADDRESS_851423]  be evaluated  by [CONTACT_941] 
88 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
 investigator /clinician designee . All adverse  events  and laboratory  abnormalities  will be 
managed  and followed  to a satisfactory  clinical  resolution.   
 
To facilitate this process in a pragmatic study, after adverse event data is abstracted from the 
submitted records, the site investigator/clinician designee  will be provide d an adverse event 
listing to assess  relationship  of the adverse  event  to study  drug(s). The site will also upload 
signed central lab reports where the investigator /clinician designee  completed the 
evaluation of clinical significance of abnormal results.  Actions taken for clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory results  and/or adverse events  will be recorded in the site 
medical record or source and uploaded for centralized abstracti on. 
 
6.2. Product  Complaint  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_851424]  Complaint  is any Complaint  (see Section  6.0 for the definition)  related  to the 
study  drug product(s).  
 
For a product  this may include,  but is not limited  to, damaged/broken  product  or 
packaging,  product  appearance  whose  color/markings  do not match  the labelling , labelling  
discrepancies/inadequacies  in the labelling /instructions  (example:  printing  illegible),  
missing  components/product,  or packaging  issues.   Any product complaints identified 
centrally in the submitted medical records will be abstracted into the study database.  
 
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_851425]  with the alleged  complaint  
condition.  In instances  where  a return  is requested,  every  effort  should  be made  by [CONTACT_1275] /site to return  the product  within  30 days.  If returns  cannot  be accommodated  
within  30 days,  the site will need to provide  justification  and an estimated  date of return.  
 
The description  of the complaint  is important  for [COMPANY_013]  in order  to enable  [COMPANY_013]  to 
investigate  and determine  if any corrective  actions  are required.  
7.0 Protocol Deviations  
 
The investigator  should  not implement  any deviation  from  the protocol  without  prior  
review  and agreement  by [CONTACT_636837]  (IEC)/Independent  Review  Board  (IRB)  and local  regulations,  except  when  
necessary  to eliminate  an immediate  hazard  to study  subjects.  When  a deviation  from  the 
protocol  is deemed  necessary  for an individual  subject,  the investigator  must  contact  [CONTACT_636838]:

implementation.  
 

[ADDRESS_851426] completed the 
PT Week 12 Visit or prematurely discontinued study. The data for subjects treated in the 
Main study will be locked after data cleaning. Data from the Re treatment sub-study will 
be analyz ed separately as described below  and be included in the end -of study analysis . 
 
The data analysis will be generated using SAS/STAT software, version 9.4 or higher of 
the SAS system for Windows. Copyright © [2001 -2012] SAS Institute Inc. SAS and all 
other SAS Institute Inc. product or service names are registered trademarks or trademar ks 
of SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]. All statistical tests (if applicable) and confidence 
intervals will be two -sided with an alpha level of 0.05. Descriptive statistics will be 
provided, such as the number of observations (N), mean, and standard devia tion (SD) for 
continuous variables and counts and percentages for discrete variables.  
 
The primary efficacy a nalyses in the Main study will be performed on the intention to 
treat population summarized according to the treatment arm in which the subject actually 
received treatment .  This primary efficacy analysis dataset will be referred to as the 
modified ITT (mITT) population  and defined as all enrolled subjects who receive at least 
one dose of study drug  according to each subject’s final treatm ent arm assignment (Arm 
A, Arm B, Arm C  or Arm D ). Analyses in the Retreatment sub-study will be performed 
overall on the Evaluable Patient population for that sub -study ( EP-RS) defined as all 
subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug in the Retreatment sub-study.  
 
The traditional ITT population, which includes all subjects who received at least one dose 
of study drug categorized by  [CONTACT_13935]’ randomized treatmen t arm, along with other 
modified ITT populations will be employed  in the sensitivity analyses . Specifically, 
sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint of the Main Study will be performed on the 
following modified ITT populations:  
91 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
 1) Modified ITT -Genotype ( mITT -GT) Population  
-includes the mITT population (or “as treated”) but excludes subjects with 
genotype other than GT1 infection.  
  
2)  Modified ITT - Genotype and Virologic Failure (mITT - GT-VF) Population  
- includes the mITT -GT population but exclude s subjects who did not achieve 
SVR12 for reasons other than virologic failure (mITT -GT-VF), when 
applicable.  
Similarly , for the Retreatment sub-study, sensitivity  analyses  of the SVR 12 endpoint will 
be performed on the EP-RS population modified to exclude subjects other than GT1 ( EP-
RS-GT) and further modified to exclude subjects who did not achieve SVR 12 for reasons 
other than virologic failure ( EP-RS-GT-VF). 
No data will be imputed  for any efficacy  or safety  analysis  except  for analyses  of SVR  
endpoints  (HCV  RNA  data).  HCV  RNA  values  will be selected  for the analyses  of all 
SVR  endpoints  (e.g.,  SVR 4 and SVR 12) based  on defined  visit windows.  A backward  
imputation  method  will be used to impute  missing  responses  for SVR  analyses.  
Additional details of analyses to be performed are specified in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan.  
8.1.1  Demographics  
 
Demographics  and baseline  characteristics  will be summarized  for all treated  subjects  by 
[CONTACT_636841]-RS population . 
Demographics  include  age, weight,  height,  BMI,  gender,  race,  and ethnicity.  Baseline  
characteristics  will be summarized  as continuous  variables  (where  appropriate)  and as 
categorical  variables,  including  HCV  genotype  subtype,  most recent HCV  treatment  
history,  baseline  HCV  RNA  level,  and fibrosis  stage . 
 
Summary  statistics  (N, mean,  median,  SD, and range)  will be generated  by [CONTACT_636842]  (e.g.,  age and BMI),  and the number  and percentage  of subjects  
will be presented  for categorical  variables  (e.g.,  sex and race).  
92 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
  
Study  drug exposure  and compliance  will be summarized  by [CONTACT_636843]-RS population . Treatment  compliance  to study  drug will be calculated  
based  on the percentage  of tablets *** taken  relative  to the total tablets *** expected  to be 
taken  for each tablet *** type G/P, RBV, SOF tablets as applicable . A subject  is 
considered  to be compliant  if the percentage  is between  80% and 120%  for each tablet 
type. Compliance  will be calculated  for each subject  and summarized  with the mean,  
median,  standard  deviation,  minimum,  and maximum.  The percentage  of compliant  
subjects  will be summarized.  
   ***RBV Dosage Form to be determined by [CONTACT_636832].  
8.1.2  Efficacy  
 
All efficacy  analyses  will be performed  on the mITT and EP-RS population s, unless  
otherwise  specified.   Plasma  HCV  RNA  levels  will be determined  for each sample  
collected  by [CONTACT_636844]® AmpliPrep/COBAS® 
TaqMan® HCV  Quantitative  Test,  v2.0.  The notation  "HCV  RNA  < LLOQ"  is used to 
represent  all HCV  RNA  values  < 15 IU/mL  that are HCV  RNA  detected  or HCV  RNA  not 
detected.  HCV  RNA  ≥ LLOQ  are all quantifiable  values.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary  Efficacy  Endpoints  
 
The primary  efficacy  endpoint s for the mITT population  are the difference in SVR 12 (HCV  
RNA  < LLOQ  [ADDRESS_851427] actual  dose of study  drug)  rates between Arm A and 
Arm B in non -cirrhotic subjects, and difference in SVR 12 rates between Arm C and Arm D 
in cirrhotic subjects .  
 
The difference in SVR 12 rates will be summarized with a two -sided 95% confidence 
interval for the comparison between Arm A and Arm B in non -cirrhotic subjects, and for 
the comparison between Arm C and Arm D in cirrhotic subjects. The number and 
percentage of subject achieving SVR 12 by [CONTACT_636845] a 
two-sided 95% confidence interval. The confidence interval for the difference in SVR  12 
93 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
 rates will be calculated using Wilson's  score  method.  The confidence interval for the 
SVR [ADDRESS_851428] 5. 
If the number of subjects who failed to achieve SVR  12 is less than 5, Wilson’s score 
method will be used in stead.  
 
A summary  of reason s for SVR 12 non-response  (e.g.,  on-treatment  virologic  failure,  
relapse,  other)  will be provided.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary  Efficacy  Endpoints  
 
The secondary  efficacy  endpoints  for the mITT population  in the Main Study are: 
 
o the difference in SVR12 rates between G/P given for 12 weeks (Arm A and C 
combined) and G/P given for 16 weeks (Arm B and D combined) ; 
o the difference in the percentage of subjects with on -treatment virologic failure  
(confirmed increase of > 1 log 10 IU/mL above nadir during treatment, confirmed HCV  
RNA  ≥ 100 IU/mL  after HCV  RNA  < LLOQ  during  treatment,  or HCV  RNA  ≥ LLOQ  at 
the end of treatment  with at least 6 weeks  of treatment) between Arm A and Arm B in 
non-cirrhotic subjects, and between Arm C and Arm D in cirrhotic subjects;  
o the difference in the percentage  of subjects  with post-treatment  relapse  (defined  as 
confirmed  HCV  RNA  ≥ LLOQ  between  end of treatment  and [ADDRESS_851429] dose  
of study  drug among  subjects  who completed  treatment  as planned  with HCV  RNA  < 
LLOQ  at the end of treatment , excluding subjects  with reinfection ) between Arm A and 
Arm B in non -cirrhotic subjects, and between Arm C and Arm D in cirrhotic subjects . 
 
For the analysis  of relapse,  completion  of treatment  is defined  as any subject  with study  
drug duration  of 77 days or greater  for 12-week arms (Arms A and C), or 105 days or 
greater for 16 -week arm (Arm B and D ). 
 
The difference in SVR12 rates between 12 week (Arms A+ C) and 16 week (Arms B+D) 
94 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
 treatment durations will be summarized calculated along with a two -sided 95% 
confidence int erval using Wilson’s score method. The difference in the  percentage  of 
subjects  with on-treatment  virologic  failure  and post-treatment  relapse  will be summarized  
with two-sided  95% Wilson  score  intervals , as will the  percentage  of subjects  with on-
treatment  virologic  failure  and post-treatment  relapse in each treatment a rm. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sensitivity  Analysis  
 
As sensitivity  analyses,  the difference in the percentage  of subjects  in the mITT-GT and 
mITT -GT-VF populations  achieving  SVR 12 between Arm A and Arm B in non -cirrhotic 
subjects, and between Arm C and Arm D in cirrhotic subjects , as applicable,  will be 
summarized.  The SVR 12 rates in the EP-RS-GT and EP-RS-GT-VF populations overall 
will be calculated.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subgroup  Analysis  
 
In the mITT population for the Main study, association of the proportions of subjects with 
SVR12 with each of the following subgroups will be compared across treatment arms 
(Arms A and B, and Arm C and D separately) using Zelen’s exact tests.  In  addition, two -

The difference in SVR12 rates between G/P given for 12 weeks (Arm A and C combined) 
and G /P given for 16 weeks (Arm B and D combined) will also be examined within the 
combined arms by [CONTACT_636846] -genotype (1b vs. non -1b). 
 
  Further  details  about  subgroup  analyses  will be described  in the Statistical  Analysis  Plan. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Additional  Efficacy  Endpoints  
 
The following  additional  efficacy  endpoints  will be summarized  for each treatment arm  in 
the mITT population and overall in the EP-RS population , as specified below : 
 
o The percentage  of mITT subjects  with HCV  RNA  < LLOQ  at each post-baseline  visit 
in the Treatment  Period  (using  data as observed);  
o The percentage  of mITT subjects  with SVR 4;

96 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
  
In the above  analyses  for SVR,  the percentage  of subjects  and a two-sided  95% Wilson  
score  interval  will be summarized.  A summary  of reasons  for SVR  non-response  will also be 
provided  for subjects in the EP-RS populations who do not achieve SVR12 . 
 
 
8.1.3  Resistance  Analyses  
 
The following  analyses  will be performed  for all subjects  in the mITT population and the 
EP-RS populations separately. In the EP-RS population, baseline polymorphisms in NS3 
and NS5A will be reassessed prior to treatment with G/P + SOF ± RBV.   
 
The HCV  NS3 and NS5A amino  acid sequence s from baseline samples  as determined  by 
[CONTACT_636847].  A listing  by [CONTACT_636848]  
(NS3 and  NS5A).  
 
The following  analyses  will be performed  for subjects  who do not achieve  SVR  [ADDRESS_851430] -baseline resistance data available:  
 
(1) The HCV  NS3 and NS5A amino  acid sequence s from  the sample  closest  in time after 
virologic  failure  or treatment  discontinuation  with an HCV  RNA  level  of ≥ 1000  IU/mL  as 
determined  by [CONTACT_636849] . 
A listing  by [CONTACT_636850]-baseline  substitutions  at signature  [CONTACT_636875]  (NS3  
and NS5A).  
 
(2) The HCV  NS3 and NS5A amino  acid sequences  from  the sample  closest  in time after 
virologic  failure  or treatment  discontinuation  with an HCV  RNA  level  of ≥ 1000  IU/mL  
will be compared  to the appropriate  prototypic  reference  sequence.  Alisting by [CONTACT_636851] 
[ADDRESS_851431]-baseline  substitutions at signature  [CONTACT_636876]  (NS3  and 
NS5A).  
(3) The persistence  of post-baseline  substitutions  at signature  [CONTACT_636877]  (NS3  and NS5A)  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_636852]-
Treatment  Week  12. Alisting by [CONTACT_636853]  (NS3  and NS5A).  
 
For subjects who experience virologic failure in the Retreatment sub-study,  the NS3 , 
NS5A , and NS5B  sequences  from the baseline sample and from the sample closest in 
time after virologic failure with an HCV RNA level of ≥ 1000 IU/mL will be evaluated as 
descri bed in analyses (1) and (2) above . 
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_851432] one dose of study drug will be included in the safety 
analyses.  Safety analyses will be conducted separately for the Main study and the 
Retreatment sub-study.  
 
Adverse  events  will be coded  using  the Medical  Dictionary  for Regu latory  Activities  
(MedDRA).  The number  and percentage  of subjects  with treatment -emergent  adverse  
events  (i.e., any event  that begins  or worsens  in severity  after initiation  of study  drug  
through  [ADDRESS_851433]-study  drug dosing)  will be tabulated  by [CONTACT_636854]  (SOC)  and preferred  term (PT) for each treatment arm . The tabulation  of the 
number  of subjects  with treatment -emergent  adverse  events  by [CONTACT_636855].  Subjects  reporting  more  than one adverse  
event  for a given  MedDRA  preferred  term will be counted  only once for that term using  
the most  severe  grade  for the severity  grade  table  and the most  related  for the relationship  
to study  drug  table.  Subjects  reporting  more  than one type of event  within  a SOC  will be 
[ADDRESS_851434]-baseline  laboratory  values  
showing increase in  CTCAE  toxicity  grade  during  treatment  will be summarized  by 
[CONTACT_636856] -study . 
 
8.2 Determination  of Sample  Size 
 
Based on actual  real-world pragmatic enrol lment observed in the ongoing study, more 
non-cirrhotics and less compensated cirrh otic subjects are enroll ing than was previousl y 
projected. This will improve precision for the point estimated SVR12 rates of  the non -
cirrhotic patient and decrease precision for the point estimated SVR12 rates in 
compensated cirrhotic subjects . For the comparison between Arm A and A rm B in non -
cirrhotic subjects, if the observed SVR12 rate in Arm B is 92% -96%, with  100 subjects in 
Arm A and 50 subjects in Arm B , the half widths of 95% confidence interval of the 
difference between SVR12 rates are displayed in the table below:  
SVR12 i n Arm B  92%  93%  94%  95%  96%  
Half width (SVR12 in Arm A = SVR12 in Arm 
B) 0.092  0.087  0.081  0.074  0.067  
Half width (SVR12 in Arm A = SVR12 in Arm B 
– 1%) 0.094  0.088  0.083  0.076  0.069  
Half width (SVR12 in Arm A = SVR12 in Arm B 
– 2%) 0.095  0.090  0.085  0.078  0.072  
99 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
 For the comparison between Arm C and Arm D in cirrhotic subjects, if the observed 
SVR12 rate in Arm D is 94% -98%, with 40 subjects in Arm C and 40 subjects in Arm D , 
the half widths of the 95% confidence interval of  the difference between SVR12 rates are 
displayed in the table below:  
SVR12 in Arm D  94%  95%  96%  97%  98%  
Half width (SVR12 in Arm C = SVR12 in Arm D)  0.104  0.096  0.086  0.075  0.061  
Half width (SVR12 in Arm C= SVR12 in Arm D – 1%) 0.108  0.100  0.091  0.081  0.068  
Half width (SVR12 in Arm C = SVR12 in Arm D – 2%) 0.112  0.104  0.095  0.086  0.075  
 
In Study M15 -410, subjects with prior NS5A inhibitor experience only (ie. PI [INVESTIGATOR_28947]ïve) had 
an SVR12 rate of 94.4% for 16 weeks treatment duration.  This SVR12 rate would give 
half widths of 95% confidence intervals of ≤ 1 1% in most cases where Arm A or Arm C 
are no more that 1% worse than Arm B or Arm D , respectively . 
8.3 Randomization  Methods  
 
The Main  study  is randomized.  In it, e ligible subjects without cirrhosis will be 
randomized  2:1 into Arms A and B. Subjects with compensated cirrhosis will be 
randomized  1:1 into Arms  C and D.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_545764] 1 
subtype (1b or non -1b) and ci rrhosis status . 
The Retreatment sub-study is not randomized; all subjects who experience virologic 
failure in the Main study and consent to the Retreatment sub-study will receive G/P + 
SOF ± RBV  for 16 weeks . 
 
 
9.0 Ethics  
9.1 Independent  Ethics  Committee  (IEC)  or Institutional  Review  
Board  (IRB)  
 
Good  Clinical  Practice  (GCP)  requires  that the clinical  protocol,  any protocol  
amendments,  the Investigator's  Brochure  (applicable to Main Study only ), the informed  
consent  and all other  forms  of subject  information  related  to the study  (e.g.,  advertisements  
used to recruit  subjects)  and any other  necessary  documents  be reviewed  by [CONTACT_18369]/IRB.  
The IEC/IRB  will review  the ethical,  scientific  and medical  appropriateness  of the study  
100 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
 before  it is conducted.  IEC/IRB  approval  of the protocol,  informed  consent  and subject  
information  and/or  advertising,  as relevant,  will be obtained  prior  to the authorization  of 
drug shipment  to a study  site. 
 
Any amendments  to the protocol  will require  IEC/IRB  approval  prior  to implementation  of 
any changes  made  to the study  design.  The investigator  will be required  to submit,  
maintain  and archive  study  essential  documents  according  to ICH GCP.  
 
Any serious  adverse  events  that meet  the reporting  criteria,  as dictated  by [CONTACT_56819],  
will be reported  to both responsible  Ethics  Committees  and Regulatory  Agencies,  as 
required  by [CONTACT_56819].  During  the conduct  of the study,  the investigator  should  
promptly  provide  written  reports  (e.g.,  ICH Expedited  Reports,  and any additional  reports  
required  by [CONTACT_56819])  to the IEC/IRB  of any changes  that affect  the conduct  of the 
study  and/or  increase  the risk to subjects.  Written  documentation  of the submission  to the 
IEC/IRB  should  also be provided  to the sponsor . 
 
 
9.[ADDRESS_851435]  of the Study  
 
The study  will be conducted  in accordance  with the protocol,  International  Conference  on 
Harmonization  (ICH)  guidelines,  applicable  regulations  and guidelines  governing  clinical  
study  conduct  and the ethical  principles  that have their origin  in the Declaration  of 
Helsinki.  Responsibilities  of the clinical  investigator  are specified  in Appendix  A. 
 
9.[ADDRESS_851436]  Information  and Consent  
 
The investigator  or his/her  representative  will explain  the nature  of the study  to the 
subject,  and answer  all questions  regarding  this study.  Prior  to any study  -related  
screening  procedures  being  performed  on the subject,  the informed  consent  statement  will 
be reviewed  and signed  and dated by [CONTACT_423],  the person  who administered  the 
informed  consent,  and any other  signatories  according  to local  requirements.  A signed 
[ADDRESS_851437]'s  medical  record.  An entry  must  also be made  in the subject's  dated  
source  documents  to confirm  that informed  consent  was obtained  prior  to any study-
related  procedures  and that the subject  received  a signed  copy.  
 
 
 
 
 
10.0 Source  Documents  and Case  Report  
Form  Completion  
10.1 Source  Documents  
 
All original clinic notes, telephone notes, locally available safety labs/evaluations 
and/or diagnostic tests or health screenings collected prior to, during and post HCV 
treatment period will be submitted for chart data abstraction to identify and abstract 
medical history, vital  signs,  weight (and height historically) HCV treatment, dosing, adverse 
events, clinical management and physical examinations  that were co llected as part of 
standard of care practice.  Additionally,  sites will be provided standardized source 
worksheets to manage drug supply, drug accountability and various other study related 
activities that are not routinely covered under clinical care or r ecorded in the patient 
medical record  along with the records associated with central laboratory test collection 
and results .  These documents  comprise the study source and will be submitted for 
centralized data abstraction (Section 10.3). 
 
The source documentation for this pragmatic study is largely the medical record 
generated in the clinical management of the subjects.  The Investigator is responsible 
for ensuring that the source data are accurate, legible, contem poraneous, original and 
attributable, whether the data are hand -written on paper or entered electronically. If 
source data are created (first entered), modified, maintained, archived, retrieved, or 
transmitted electronically via computerized systems (and/o r any other kind of electronic 
102 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
 devices) as part of regulated clinical trial activities, such systems must be compliant 
with all applicable laws and regulations governing use of electronic records and/or 
electronic signatures. Such systems may include, but are not limited to, electronic 
medical/health records (EMRs/EHRs), adverse event tracking/reporting, protocol -
required assessments, and/or drug accoun tability records . 
 
When paper records from such systems are used in place of electronic format to 
perform  regulated activities, such paper records should be certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. A certified 
copy consists of a copy of original information that has been verified, as indicated by a 
dated signature, as an exact copy having all of the same attributes and information a s 
the original.  
 
 
10.2 Case  Report  Forms  
 
Case report  forms  (CRF) are completed for each subject by [CONTACT_636857].  Site staff is responsible to upload redacted 
records into th e applicable case book for each respective patient according to the Study 
Activities Schedule ( Table  5). These  forms  will be used to transmit  information  collected  
during  the study  to [COMPANY_013]  and regulatory  authorities,  as applicable.  The CRF  data for 
this study  are being  collected with  an electronic  data capture (EDC)  system  called  
REDC ap. REDCap has been used in over 15,360 projects with over 23,000 end users 
across 6 continents.  REDCap is designed for interactive web -based data entry with real -
time field validation.  A dedicated instance  of the web -based Research Electronic Data 
Capture (REDCap) data management software package, which is utilized extensively 
throughout the national CTSA program and beyond, is implemented and supported by [CONTACT_636858]  –Chapel Hill for the HCV -TARGET registry program. This 
secure server environment housing the database hardware is located within a hardened 
data center on the UNC campus and is governed by [CONTACT_636859] . 
103 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
  
The “FDA regulation 21 CFR Part 11” details recommendations for electronic records 
and electronic signatures.  According to this regulation, systems generating electronic 
records which are to be considered equivalent to paper records, should be validated, 
produce a time -stamped audit trail of data modifications, require electronic signatures and 
restrict access to authorized users.  The REDCap based data management system 
implemented for the HCV -TARGET registry has been adapted to the specified FDA 
recommen dations, and annual internal audits are performed to ensure compliance with 
Title 21 CFR Part 11 is achieved.  
 
10.3 Centralized Data Abstraction  
 
In order to reduce chart data abstraction errors and inconsistencies and improve data 
quality, the HCV -TARGET Network operations utilizes a specially trained Centralized 
Chart Data Abstraction Service  (CDAS)  team at the CCC/respective country Abstraction 
Core (CDAS) as the method for chart abstraction. Participating sites upload redacted 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_636778]. This data includes ALL clinic notes, nursing/staff telephone notes, 
evaluations and lab results generated in standard care to monitor the HCV baseline 
condition, on -treatment saf ety and efficacy, concomitant therapy, actions taken in 
treatment management as well as outcomes. The CDAS will abstract and enter the data 
from those provided participant medical records into the database and query as needed to 
fill data gaps not addresse d by [CONTACT_636860].  
 
10.4 Submitting Records for Abstraction  
 
Before submitting records for abstraction, site staff redacts all elements of PHI (see 
Section 10.6) defined by [CONTACT_636861].  Sites will add 
a study -coded identifier to the submitted records to help maintain subject 
[ADDRESS_851438] the protocol -defined data into the study 
database.  Those records will be maintained by [CONTACT_636862].  
 
The abstracted data is transmitted to the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) via a 
distributed web -based data entry system, REDCap, which  is [ADDRESS_851439] confidentiality. All study staff will identify  patients by [CONTACT_636863]. The investigator(s)/institution(s) will 
permit study -related monitoring, audits, IEC/IRB review and regulatory inspection(s), 
providing direct access to source data documents.  [COMPANY_013]  (or their representative) will 
105 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
 also be allowed access to all source documents pertinent to the study in order to verify 
EDC entries. Participants grant permission to share research data with these entities in 
the consent document. Federal regulations gover n the protection of patient’s rights 
relative to data confidentiality and use of research data.   
 
Consent procedures and forms, and the communication, transmission and storage of 
patient data will comply with individual site IRB and federal requirements f or 
compliance with HIPPA.  
10.[ADDRESS_851440] to 
establish a national set of standards for the protection of certain health information.

digits of a zip code for all such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people is 
changed to 000.  
3. All elements of dates (except year) for dates directly related to an individual, 
including birth date, admission date, discharge date, d ate of death; and all ages over 89 
and all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age, except that such ages 
and elements may be aggregated into a single category of age [ADDRESS_851441] numbers  
9. Health plan beneficiary numbers  
10.  Account numbers  
11.  Certificate/license numbers

17.  Full face photographic images and any comparable images  
18. Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code (note thi s does not 
mean the unique code assigned by [CONTACT_636865])  
 
Records submitted for Centralized Abstraction and through RED -I are redacted for 
these PHI identifiers except for dates of service /activities .  In instances where a PHI 
identif ier other than a date of service is present on a redacted record delegated CCC 
personnel will redact that information . 
 
11.0  Monitoring  
 
The study monitor will review data centrally  (remote monitoring)  to identify potential 
issues to determine a  schedule of on -site visits for targeted review of study records.   
 
The study monitor must be allowed to visit all study site locations periodically to ass ess 
the data quality and study integrity. On -site they will review study records , the 
Investigator Site File, and study medication; discuss the conduct of the study w ith the

116 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
 Appendix  B. Medicare National Coverage Decision for Clinical Trials  
 
This national coverage policy is based upon the authority found in §1862(a)(1)(E) of the 
Social Security Act (Act). It is binding on all Medicare carriers, fiscal intermediaries, Peer 
Review Organiza tions, Health Maintenance Organizations, Competitive Medical Plans, 
Health Care Prepayment Plans, and Medicare+Choice organizations (§1852(a)(1)(A) of the 
Act). In addition, an administrative law judge may not disregard, set aside, or otherwise 
review a na tional coverage decision issued under §1862(a)(1) of the Act. 42 C.F.R. §405.860.  
Clinical Trials  
 
Effective for items and services furnished on or after September 19, 2000, Medicare covers 
the routine costs of qualifying clinical trials, as such costs are  defined below, as well as 
reasonable and necessary items and services used to diagnose and treat complications arising 
from participation in all clinical trials. All other Medicare rules apply.  
 
Routine costs of a clinical trial include all items and serv ices that are otherwise generally 
available to Medicare beneficiaries (i.e., there exists a benefit category, it is not statutorily 
excluded, and there is not a national noncoverage decision) that are provided in either the 
experimental or the control arms  of a clinical trial except:  
• the investigational item or service, itself,  
• items and services provided solely to satisfy data collection and analysis needs and 
that are not used in the direct clinical management of the patient (e.g., monthly CT scans fo r 
a condition usually requiring only a single scan); and  
• items and services customarily provided by [CONTACT_636868].  
 
 
 
117 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
 Routine costs in clinical trials include:  
 
• Items or services that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_636784] a clinical trial (e.g., conventional 
care);  
• Items or services required solely for the provision of the investigational item or 
service (e.g., administration of a noncovered chemotherapeutic agent), the clinically 
appropriate mon itoring of the effects of the item or service, or the prevention of 
complications; and  
• Items or services needed for reasonable and necessary care arising from the provision 
of an investigational item or service --in particular, for the diagnosis or treatm ent of 
complications.  
  
This policy does not withdraw Medicare coverage for items and services that may be covered 
according to local medical review policies or the regulations on category B investigational 
device exemptions (IDE) found in 42 C.F.R. §405.2 01-405.215 and  
§411.15 and §411.406. For information about LMRPs, refer to www.lmrp.net, a searchable 
database of Medicare contractors' local policies.  
 
For noncovered items and services, including items and services for which Medicare payment 
is statutorily prohibited, Medicare only covers the treatment of complications arising from the 
delivery of the noncovered item or service and unrelated reasonable and necessary care. 
(Refer to MCM 2300.1 and MIM 3101.) However, if the item or service is not covered by 
[CONTACT_57216] a national noncoverage policy in the Coverage Issues Manual and is the focus of a 
qualifying clinical trial, the routine costs of the clinical trial (as defined above) will be 
covered by [CONTACT_636869], its elf, will not.  
  
 
 
[ADDRESS_851452] meet the following three 
requirements:  
 
1. The subject or purpose of the trial must be the evaluation of an item or  service that 
falls within a Medicare benefit category (e.g., physicians' service, durable medical 
equipment, diagnostic test) and is not statutorily excluded from coverage (e.g., 
cosmetic surgery, hearing aids).  
2. The trial must not be designed exclusively to test toxicity or disease pathophysiology. 
It must have therapeutic intent.  
3. Trials of therapeutic interventions must enroll patients with diagnosed disease rather 
than healthy volunteers. Trials of diagnostic interventions may enroll healt hy patients 
in order to have a proper control group.  
 
The three requirements above are insufficient by [CONTACT_636870] a clinical trial for 
Medicare coverage of routine costs. Clinical trials also should have the following desirable 
characteristics; however, some trials, as described below, are presumed to meet these 
characteristics and are automatically qualified to receive Medicare coverage:  
 
1. The principal purpose of the trial is to test whether the intervention potentially 
improves the participa nts' health outcomes;  
2. The trial is well -supported by [CONTACT_636871];  
3. The trial does not unjustifiably duplicat e existing studies;  
4. The trial design is appropriate to answer the research question being asked in the trial;  
5. The trial is sponsored by a credible organization or individual capable of executing 
119 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
 the proposed trial successfully;  
6. The trial is in co mpliance with Federal regulations relating to the protection of human 
subjects; and  
7. All aspects of the trial are conducted according to the appropriate standards of 
scientific integrity.  
Qualification Process for Clinical Trials  
 
Using the authority fou nd in §[ADDRESS_851453] (cross -referenced in §1862(a)(1)(E) of the 
Act), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) will convene a multi - agency 
Federal panel (the "panel") composed of representatives of the Department of Health and 
Human Service s research agencies (National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), AHRQ, and the 
Office of Human Research Protection), and the research arms of the Department of Defense 
(DOD)  and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to develop qualifying criteria that will 
indicate a strong probability that a trial exhibits the desirable characteristics listed above. 
These criteria will be easily verifiable, and where possible, dichotomous.  Trials that meet 
these qualifying criteria will receive Medicare coverage of their associated routine costs. This 
panel is not reviewing or approving individual trials. The multi -agency panel will meet 
periodically to review and evaluate the program and r ecommend any necessary refinements 
to CMS.  
 
Clinical trials that meet the qualifying criteria will receive Medicare coverage of routine costs 
after the trial's lead principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_636785]. This 
process will requi re the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_636786] a Medicare clinical trials 
registry, currently under development.  
 
Some clinical trials are automatically qualified to receive Medicare coverage of their routine 
costs because they have been deemed by [CONTACT_636872], in consultation with the other agencies 
[ADDRESS_851454] 
enroll the trials in the Medicare clinical trials registry for administrative purposes, once the 
registry is established.  
 
Effective September 19, 2000, clinical trials that are deemed t o be automatically qualified 
are: 
 
1. Trials funded by [CONTACT_4289], CDC, AHRQ, CMS, DOD, and VA;  
2. Trials supported by [CONTACT_636873], CDC, 
AHRQ, CMS, DOD and VA;  
3. Trials conducted under an investigational new drug application (IND) reviewed by [CONTACT_1556]; and  
4. Drug trials that are exempt from having an IND under 21 CFR 312.2(b)(1) will be 
deemed automatically qualified until the qualifying criteria are developed and the 
certification process is in place. At that time the principal investigators of these trials must 
certify that the trials meet the qualifying criteria in order to maintain  Medicare coverage of 
routine costs. This certification process will only affect the future status of the trial and will 
not be used to retroactively change the earlier deemed status.  
 
Medicare will cover the routine costs of qualifying trials that either have been deemed to be 
automatically qualified or have certified that they meet the qualifying criteria un less CMS's 
Chief Clinical Officer subsequently finds that a clinical trial does not meet the qualifying 
criteria or jeopardizes the safety or welfare of Medicare beneficiaries.  
 
Should CMS find that a trial's principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_636787], Medicare 
121 Protocol  
B16-439   November 20, 2018  
 
 coverage of the routine costs would be denied under §1862(a)(1)(E) of the Act. In the case of 
such a denial, the Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in th e trial would not be held liable (i.e., 
would be held harmless from collection) for the costs consistent with the provisions of §1879, 
§1842(l), or §1834(j)(4) of the Act, as applicable. Where appropriate, the billing providers 
would be held liable for the  costs and fraud investigations of the billing providers and the 
trial's principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_636788].  
 
Medicare regulations require Medicare+Choice (M+C) organizations to follow CMS's 
national coverage decisions. This NCD raises special issues th at require some modification of 
most M+C organizations' rules governing provision of items and services in and out of 
network. The items and services covered under this NCD are inextricably linked to the 
clinical trials with which they are associated and c annot be covered outside of the context of 
those clinical trials. M+C organizations therefore must cover these services regardless of 
whether they are available through in -network providers. M+C organizations may have 
reporting requirements when enrollees participate in clinical trials, in order to track and 
coordinate their members' care, but cannot require prior authorization or approval. For the 
initial implementation, Medicare contractors will pay providers directly on a fee for service 
basis for covere d clinical trial services for beneficiaries enrolled in M+C plans.

 1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA 
 
The primary purpose of this single -arm study is to assess the relapse- free survival (RFS) 
of adjuvant crizotinib in patients with uveal melanoma who are at high -risk of recurrence 
following definitive therapy with surgery or radiotherapy.  Patients with class 2 tumors as defined by [CONTACT_25071] (GEP; DecisionDx -UM, Castle Biosciences Inc, 
Friendswood, TX) who have undergone definitive therapy, who do not have evidence of metastatic disease, and who have adequate renal, hepatic, and hematologic function will be eligible for study participation.  
 The study will be conducted in 3 phases:   
1. Active Therapy :  During the active therapy phase of the study, patients will receive 
48 weeks (12 four -week cycles) of crizotinib [ADDRESS_220924] scan (with or 
without contrast) and an abdominal/pelvic MRI with contrast, will be performed at baseline and every 12 weeks. 
 
2. Follow- Up:  During the follow -up phase of the study, patients will be seen on an every 
[ADDRESS_220925] scan (with or without contrast) and an abdominal/pelvic MRI with contrast, will be performed every 12 weeks unti l the time 
of distant disease recurrence, withdrawal of patient consent, or study closure. 
 
3. Survival Phase : Patients who have distant disease recurrence during follow -up will 
then be contact[CONTACT_457] 3 months (+/ - 2 weeks) to obtain vital status for at leas t [ADDRESS_220926] a median time to recurrence of 32 months (personal communication, J. William Harbour, MD, Bascom Palmer Eye Institute) and represent an ideal patient population for a clinical 
trial testing the efficacy of an adjuvant therapy in this disease.  We hypothesize that the addition of crizotinib will increase the 32 month RFS by 25%.  Thus, a 32 month RFS of 50% would be considered not promising and a 32 month RFS of 75% or greater would be 
considered promising.  A single stage design based on a binomial probability estimate will be utilized with an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_220927] 20 out of 30 patients are relapse -free at or after 32 months, 
this adjuvant treatment with crizotinib will be considered worthy of further study.  For the purposes of this study, distant disease relapse is defined as the development of tumor growth or recurrence at a site distant from the affected eye. Patients who develop recurrent metastatic disease at any site will be considered treatment failures.

3. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 3.[ADDRESS_220928] common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, and arises from melanocytes within the choroid plexus of the eye.
1  Melanomas of the ocular and 
adnexal structures comprise approximately 5% of all melanomas and are biologically and prognostically distinct from cutaneous melanoma.
2  In the [LOCATION_002], an estimated 2000 
patients are diagnosed with this disease each year.  Approximately 85% of ocular melanomas are uveal (iris, ciliary body, and choroid) in origin, with primary conjunctival and orbital melanomas being less common.
2,3  Cases are nearly equally distributed between 
male and female subjects, with a medi an age at diagnosis of 62 years.4  The majority 
(97.8%) of cases of uveal melanoma occurs in the white population, with a white:black incidence ratio of 196:1.   The development of metastasis in this disease is common and occurs in approximately 50% of patients with posterior uveal melanoma within 15 years after the initial diagnosis and treatment.
5  Uveal melanoma is thought to be particularly resistant to systemic treatment, 
and no systemic therapy has yet been demonstrated to improve survival.6  Drugs commonly 
used to treat advanced cutaneous melanoma rarely achieve durable responses in patients with uveal melanoma.  Nathan et al compared the outcome between 139 patients with non-uveal melanoma and 16 patients with uveal melanoma who were treated with DTIC, BCNU, cisplatin, and tamoxifen (Dartmouth regimen).
7  The response rates wer e 33% and 
6% respectively.  In a review of the MD Anderson Cancer Center experience of [ADDRESS_220929] of these trials accruing only 48 patients and none demonstrating significant efficacy in terms of response rate, overall survival or progression- free survival (see table 1 
below).  
Table 1. Published phase II trials in uveal melanoma.  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_186979], our increasing understanding of the underlying biology of uveal melanoma has led to the identification of a number of novel and promising therapeutic strategies that warrant investigation.   
 
3.2 Prognostic Features Identify Uveal Melanoma Patients at High Risk for Recurrence  
 
Clinical factors that relate to prognosis include location (primary melanomas of the iris connote a better prognosis than those arising from the choroid, and choroidal melanomas 
fare better than ciliary body melanomas),
21,22 configuration of the tumor (diffuse 
configuration suggests poor prognosis),23 and size.24  Histopathologic features of 
importance include tumor cell type (spi[INVESTIGATOR_186980] a better prognosis than mixed morphology, and mixed morphology fares better than epi[INVESTIGATOR_186981]),
25,26 
extent of mitotic activity,27 vascular network (absent better than present),28 tumor-
infiltrating lymphocytes (absent better than present),29 and the presence of extrascleral 
extension (absent better than present).[ADDRESS_220930] been identified as poor prognostic indicat ors.31,33  Other prognostic 
factors include high expression of HLA class I,34 c-myc,35 cyclin D1, p53 MDM2,36 and 
IGF-IR.37

metastasis (class 1 tumors) and those that are more aggressive and are associated with a higher risk of metastatic death (class 2 tumors).
39  The GEP assay was performed on a 
sample collected directly from the primary tumor, usually at the time of treatment.  In a recent study of 459 cases, the GEP assay was successful in rendering a classification in 446 of 459 cases (97.2%).
40  Among the 13 samples that failed to yield a GEP result, 5 did not 
adhere to study protocol (improper buffer, handling, or shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]). Of the 446 cases, 276 (61.9%) were class 1 and 170 (38.1%) were class 2. Median follow -up was 17.4 months 
(mean, 18.0 months). Metastasis was detected in 3 patients (1.1%) with class 1 tumors and 44 patients (25.9%) with class 2 tumors (log rank, P<0.0001).  
 GEP class 2 tumors showed a significant association with other known prognostic factors, 
including increased patient age, greater tumor diameter and thickness, ciliary body involvement, and mixed/epi[INVESTIGATOR_186982].  By [CONTACT_5263]–Meier analysis, GEP class 2 was more strongly associated with metastasis than any of the other prognostic factors that were analyzed, including chromosome 3 status (see Figure 1  below).  By [CONTACT_187006], factors associated with metastasis included advanced patient age (P = 0.02), ciliary body involvement (P = 0.03), tumor diameter (P = 0.0003), tumor thickness (P = 0.006), tumor cell type (P = 0.04), chromosome 3 status (P = 0.0002), and GEP class (P<10−7).  This analysis was performed on all cases with values reported for a given factor, and there was no significant impact on the results when the analysis was restricted to those cases with complete data for all factors.  By [CONTACT_187007], GEP class (P = 0.006) was the only variable that contributed independent prognostic information. Chromosome 3 status did not contribute additional prognostic information that was independent of GEP (P = 0.2).  
 Thus, the use of GEP which is now commercially available, provides a powerful tool to 
identify those patients at highest ris k of disease recurrence.  Patients with tumors of 12mm 
basal diameter or greater and a class [ADDRESS_220933] a median time to recurrence of 32 months (personal communication, J. William Harbour, MD, Bascom Palmer Eye Institute) and represent an ideal pati ent population for a clinical trial testing the efficacy of an adjuvant

3.3 The HGF/c -MET Pathway Plays an Essential Role in the Pathophysiology of 
Uveal Melanoma.  
 
Uveal melanomas overexpress c- MET, or HGF receptor, in 60% - 86% of cases;41,[ADDRESS_220935] mechanism.  c -MET overexpression appears 
to signify more aggressive disease and activation of the HGF/c -MET pathway in uveal 
melanoma is associated with greater cell migration capacity and inferior clinical outcomes.  Indeed, in a series of [ADDRESS_220936] reported in 1998 the expression of c -MET by [CONTACT_941] m ore 
invasive interconverted phenotype of uveal melanoma cell lines, and subsequently showed a mitogenic response to HGF by c -Met expressing cells, but not by [CONTACT_187009]

Version - 25 JAN 2023 
 
    express c- Met.44  Cell migration capacity appears to be enhanced by [CONTACT_187010]- AKT and the downregulation of the cell adhesion molecules e -cadherin and beta -
catenin in a dose -dependent fashion.45  Both c -MET inhibition and AKT inhibition 
independently inhibited the downregulation of adhesion molecules by [CONTACT_187011], suggesting that activation of p- AKT 
via the HGF/c-MET axis is involved in HCF-induced uveal melanoma cell migration.
45,46   
Our group evaluated the expression of cMet and its basal phosphorylation status in 6 UM 
cell lines ( Figure 2A ).47 All cell lines expressed cMet and pMet, however, expression was 
greater in cell lines with GNAQ or GNA11 mutations (92.1, Omm1.3, and Omm1). We also investigated the ability of uveal me lanoma cells to secrete HGF, the ligand for cMet, 
by [CONTACT_6428] ( Figure 2B ) and observed that cell lines with GNAQ or GNA11 mutations 
secreted more HGF than the wild -type cell lines, suggesting that UM cell lines with such 
mutations may be activating cMet through an autocrine signaling mechanism.
  
 
 
    Interestingly, HGF and its receptor tyrosine kinase c -Met play essential roles in the 
processes of liver embryogenesis and in hepatic regeneration following injury in the adult 
state, emphasizing their role as both morphogen and mitogen for this organ.

3.4 Crizotinib  
 
Preclinical Studies . Crizotinib (PF -02341066) is a selective ATP competitive small 
molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of c -MET/hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR) 
and ALK tyrosine kinases.  In pre -clinical studies, crizotinib inhibited cell growth of cell 
lines with either MET amplification or ALK gene rearrangement.[ADDRESS_220938] (MSKCC protocol 07- 157).  The maximum tolerated dose was established 
at 250mg orally given twice daily given continuously.  The EML4- ALK oncogene was 
subsequently identified in NSCLC, and upon retrospective molecular typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], two patients with dramatic partial responses were discovered to have the ALK gene rearrangement.  An expanded cohort of 82 patients with ALK+ NSCLC was given crizotinib, and had an overall response rate of 56%, with an additional 33% with stable disease.
52  A recent update 
reported a median progression free survival of 9.2 months on crizotinib.53  Interim results 
of a phase II trial of 136 patients with advanced ALK+ NSCLC revealed that 90% of evaluable patients showed target lesion shrinkage.
[ADDRESS_220939] patients, were grade 
1 in severity and were reversible upon discontinuation of crizotinib. The MTD was established at 250mg orally twice daily.  
 
3.5 c-MET Inhibition Impedes Uveal Melanoma Cell Migration .  
 We tested the effects of downregulation of cMet, ALK and ROS1, targets inhibited by 
[CONTACT_187012], on cell proliferation and migration of UM cell lines.
47 Western blot confirmed 
decreased cMet in all the cell lines transfected with cMet siRNA ( Figure 3A ), with 
suppression of ALK and ROS1 observed in cell lines with positive basal expression. While cell viability assays demonstrated no suppression of growth by [CONTACT_187013] (data not shown),22 cMet siRNA significantly inhibited cell migration (p<0.05; Figure 3B ), with 
statistically non -significant inhibition of migration observed with ALK and ROS1 siRNA.

[ADDRESS_220940] on cell growth. After 72 hrs of treatment, all UM cell lines sho wed a dose -dependent 
decrease in viability in response to crizotinib at doses >1,000 nmol/L ( Figure 2C ). cMet 
phosphorylation was inhibited by [CONTACT_187014] 25 nmol/L, whereas neither ALK nor ROS1 was inhibited at any of the concentrations tested with 24 hours of drug exposure (data not shown). When UM cells were treated with 25 nmol/L of crizotinib in a [ADDRESS_220941] was observed such that only the migration of 
GNAQ and GNA11 mutant cells lines and not wild -type cell lines (C918 and Mel290), was 
decreased ( Figure 2D). However, when treated with 250 nmol/L crizotinib for 24 hrs 
(conditions under which cell proliferation was still not affected), the migration of all cell lines was inhibited irrespective of mutatio nal status (data not shown), suggesting that 
GNAQ and GNA11 mutant cells with higher basal activity of cMet are sensitive to lower concentrations of crizotinib. 
 
 
   
Figure 3 . Effects of cMet Inhibition on Cell Migration. A, cells were transfected with con trol, 
cMet, ALK, or ROS1 siRNA. Western blot analysis of the lysates verified that all target genes 
were knocked down by [CONTACT_187015]. B, transfected cells were seeded on Matrigel chambers in triplicates and allowed to migrate for 24 hours into RPMI media containing 10% serum. Migrated cells were then quantitated. Only cMet siRNA knockdown significantly inhibits 
cell migration. C, UM cells were plated and treated in triplicates with increasing doses of 
crizotinib for 72 hours in 96 -well plates then cell viability was measured as the percentage of 
untreated controls. Crizotinib inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-
dependent manner 
regardless of genotype only at higher concentrations. The IC50 range is from 750 to 2,000 nmol/L. D, UM cells were seeded on a Matrigel chamber with 0.1% FBS in RPMI and either DMSO or 25 nmol/L crizotinib. Cells were then allowed to migrate for 24 hours into media 
containing 10% FBS and 50 ng/mL HGF. The migration of GNAQ -mutant UM cells was 
significantly inhibited with 25 nmol/L crizotinib but not the migration of wild- type cell lines.

3.6 Crizotinib Inhibits the Development and Establishment of Metastases in a Murine Model of Uveal Melanoma  
 
We developed a metastatic model of UM where retro -orbital injection of 10 million 
OMM1.3 cells labeled with GFP/luciferase results in the development of hepatic metastasis within 6 weeks.
47 Using this model, we treated mice with 50 mg/kg of crizotinib (5 
days/week) 1 week after tumor implantation for a total of 8 weeks. Imaging performed at week 11 demonstrated significant suppression of metastatic spread with treatment compared to control m ice ( Figures 4A and 4B) confirmed by [CONTACT_187016] 11 
(Figure 4C ). Importantly, UM tumor growth in the eye of the mice was not inhibited by 
[CONTACT_187012], which mirrors that lack of efficacy in 2 xenograft models of established UM tumors (data not shown).

[ADDRESS_220942] demonstrated that inhibition of cMET by [CONTACT_187017] -
migratory activity in UM cell lines, and that crizotinib impedes the development of distant metastatic disease to the liver and other sites in a UM mouse model. Given the biological 
relevance of th e HGF/cMET axis in UM combined with the preclinical data supporting the 
anti-migratory and anti -tumor activity of cMET targeting in this disease, we propose a 
phase II clinical trial to investigate our hypothesis that cMET inhibition with crizotinib with p revent the establishment and development of metastases in patients with high- risk 
primary uveal melanoma.

A, bioluminescence imaging at 7 weeks after injection of cells compared 
progression of metastasis in control - (n=10) and crizotinib- treated (n=12) mice. 
Control mice have metastasis in the abdominal region, while crizotinib inhibited metastasis. B, bioluminescence intensity was quantified for each mouse and the 
mean calculated for each cohort. Luciferase activity in metastatic sites was 
significantly decreased in crizotinib- treated mice compared with the vehicle 
control ( p=0.03). C, necropsy showed macrometastases in the liver and lungs of 
the controls, whereas none were seen in the crizotinib-
treated mice.

    that the addition of crizotinib will increase the 32 month RFS by 25%.  Thus, a 32 month 
RFS of 50% would be considered not promising and a 32 month RFS of 75% or greater would be considered promising.  A single stage design based on a binomial probability estimate will be utilized, with an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_220944] evidence of metastatic

5. THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
 Crizotinib will be taken twice daily at a dose of [ADDRESS_220946] to meals.  If the patient forgets a dose, 
they should take it as soon as they remember unless it is less than six hours before the next dose.  In that case, they should be instructed to take the next dose. They should not take two doses at the same time to make up for a missed dose.  Medication will be dispensed at the beginning of each treatment cycle (28 days) and a pi[INVESTIGATOR_186983].  While every effort will be made to encourage medication adherence, missed doses will not be treated as protocol violations unless the number of missed doses is greater than 25% of the total scheduled number of doses. Investigators should reference the current approved prescribing information.     Crizotinib will be provided as capsules containing 200 or 250 mg of study medication for oral administration.

7. RECRUITMENT PLAN 
 A member of the patient’s treatment team, the protocol investigator or research team at Columbia University Medical Center  or Memorial Sloan Kettering will identify potential 
research participants.  If the investigator is a part of the treatment team, s/he  will screen the 
patient as to eligibility, and will discuss the study and the possibility of enrollment in the research study with the patient.  The preliminary screen of eligibility will be confirmation of the diagnosis of uveal melanoma and ascertaining the exact stage of the disease.  
Potential subjects that meet these basic criteria will be referred by [CONTACT_187020]/research staff of the study, whether in ophthalmology or medical oncology.  The patient will be approached for enrollment on the screening portion of the trial, which will determine risk -stratification by [CONTACT_187021].

9. TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN  
 All patients will receive oral crizotinib 250 mg PO BID during the active therapy phase of the study. Dose modifications due to toxicity are described further in Section 11.0.  The schedule of evaluations and interventions is described in Section 10.0  The study will be conducted in 3 phases:  
 
1. Active Therapy Phase:   During the active therapy phase of the study, patients will 
receive 48 weeks (12 four -week cycles) of crizotinib [ADDRESS_220952] scan (with or without contrast) and an abdominal/pelvic MRI with contrast, will be performed at baseline and every 12 weeks. 
 
2. Follow- Up Phase :  During the follow -up phase of the study, patients will be seen on 
an every [ADDRESS_220953] scan (with or 
without contrast) and an abdominal/pelvic MRI with contrast, will be performed every 12 weeks ± 1 week until distant disease recurrence, withdrawal of patient consent, or study closure.  
 
3. Survival Phase : Patients who have distant disease recurrence during follow -up will 
then be contact[CONTACT_457] 3 months (+/ -2 weeks) to obtain vital status for at least 32 
months from the start of active therapy. 
 
10. EVALUATION DURING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
Columbia University Medical Center  
Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center  
 
17 
Version - 25 JAN 2023 
 
    Evaluations will occur at each clinic visit, which are every 4 weeks (+/ - 1 week) for 48 
weeks, and every 3 months (+/- 2 weeks) subsequently.  Surveillance imaging studies will be performed at baseline and every 12 weeks subsequently (+/ - 1 week window).  All 
evaluations and assessments may be performed with a +/ - 1 week window unless specified 
above.  The evaluations are delineated further in the study calendar (Table 4)  Quality of life (QoL) will be measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy 
- Melanoma (FACT -M) Version 4 (see Appendix D) to explore potential effect of 
treatment.  The FACT -M consists of 27 items that form four general health subscales: 
Physi cal Well -being (PWB), Social Well -being (SWB), Emotional Well -being (EWB), and 
Functional Well -being. In addition, the FACT -M contains 16 questions which comprise 
the Melanoma Score (MS).  The eight questions from the FACT -M related directly to the 
melanom a surgery site are excluded for this study since these questions will not be 
applicable for the patient sample.   
 In this study, the QoL questionnaire will be administered at baseline, after 4 to 8 weeks of crizotinib therapy, and at the end of the 48 weeks of active treatment.  To preclude bias of patient responses by [CONTACT_187026], every effort should be made to administer the QoL questionnaire to patients at their scheduled visits prior to any other assessments, treatment administration, physician/investigator consultation, and prior to being informed of his/her disease status.  Upon completion, the investigator, research nurse, or study coordinator should immediately review the questionnaire.  This should be  done to ensure that every question has been answered and 
that there is only one response for each question.  If omissions or double responses occur, they should be brought to the attention of the patient.

d: A single [ADDRESS_220957] treatment -phase EKG does not need to be conducted if the baseline EKG 
was conducted within 28 days of treatment start date.  Additional EKGs will be performed as clinically indicated.  
Patients with a baseline QT interval corre cted for heart rate using the Bazett’s formula QTcB ≥ 480 msec are 
excluded from this trial.   
e: Adverse event evaluation should be performed during the active therapy phase and up to 30 days following 
completion of crizotinib administration.  No subsequent adverse event evaluation is required.  
f:   Surveillance imaging studies will be performed at baseline and every 12 weeks (+/ - 1 week window for 
imaging studies).  Every attempt should be made to perform a CT of the chest (with or without contrast) as well 
as an MRI of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast; however, alternative imaging modalities may be performed upon discussion with the Principal Investigator.  
g: The FACT -M questionnaire will be administered at baseline, after 4 to 8 weeks of crizotinib therapy, at the 
end of active treatment.   
h: High -risk (class 2) uveal melanoma as determined by [CONTACT_25071] (GEP; DecisionDx- UM, 
Castle Biosciences Inc, Friendswood, TX) may have been performed at any time prior to study initiation.

top tubes  (approximately 8 mL/tube) only at baseline, and 1 Streck blood collection tube (BCT) (approximately 
8 mL/tube) at baseline , at w eeks 4, 8,  and 12, and then every [ADDRESS_220958] sodium heparin or K3- EDTA tubes can substitute for CPTs or Streck BCTs if necessary.  
j:     Patients will be evaluated every 3 months (+/- 2 weeks) for follow up assessment until distant disease 
recurrence, withdrawal of patient consent, or study closure.  
k: Patients who do not withdraw consent will have a recurrence visit within 30 days of distant disease 
recurrence.  
l:      Patients will be contact[CONTACT_457] 3 months (+/ -2 weeks) for at least [ADDRESS_220959] of care.  Tumor FNAs and/or enucleation 
samples performed prior to screening consent (e.g. at an outside institution) may be used for correlative analysis if patients have consented to Castle Bioscience’s bios pecimen 
repository.  Should sufficient additional sample be available  at Castle Biosciences , RNA expression

 If any fresh frozen, paraffin embedded and/ or cells from tumor tissues is available in 
excess of that required for pathological diagnosis or for the analysis described above, it 
may be obtained for additional correlative studies  to be performed at each of the 
participating sites .  Tumor FNAs and/or enucleation samples performed prior to screening 
consent (e.g. at an outside institution) may be used for correlative analysis if patients have consented to other appropriate protocols (e.g the Ohio State Univers ity Uveal Melanoma  
genetics study [IRB#[ZIP_CODE]]).  10.1.2 Correlative Studies on Blood  
 
Patient serum and/or plasma for research purposes will be obtained at baseline before treatment on Day 1, at each on- treatment and follow -up visit, and at the off-study visit.  
 Four cell preparation tubes with sodium heparin or ACD yellow top tubes  (~8 mL /tube) 
and 1 Streck blood collection tube (BCT) or equivalent (~8 mL) will be obtained at baseline.  
 While on study, [ADDRESS_220961] sodium heparin -containing and/or K3- EDTA tubes can substitute for CPTs and Streck BCT if 
necessary.  These samples  will be banked for circulating tumor DNA and companion 
normal gene expression profiling studies.   Samples  will be spun and separated into plasma and cellular components and circulating 
cell-free (tumor) DNA and cell -associated DNA  extracted .  At OSU, this will be performed  
at [CONTACT_187053] -Rahman’s laboratory or the Human Genetics Sample Bank core facility , and

additional correlative studies  may be performed at each of the participating sites .  
 10.1.[ADDRESS_220962] 3 cores and up to 5 cores from the patient’s biopsy specimen will be flash frozen and banked for research purposes. RNA expression levels of the same genes noted above (cMET, HGF, ROS, ALK , MYC 
etc) will be assessed from these specimens. Follow -up validation studies of these target 
genes (e.g. protein expression, immunohistochemistry, etc.) will be performed as required from analysis of GEP data. If a total of 5 cores may be safely obtained, 2 fresh cores  may 
also be utilized to establish cell lines, organoids,  and/or patient derived xenografts in 
immunocompromised mice  as described below  under section 10.2.3.  Inflammatory 
marker immunohistochemistry studies for all patients will be perfo rmed at OSU.  
Additional correlative studies  may be performed at each of the participating sites .

10.2.2 Blood for PBMC Isolation  
 PBMC isolation will be performed at baseline only.  Please ensure an absolute 
lymphocyte count and an absolute monocyte count are collected when  PBMCs are 
obtained so that PBMCs can be quantified.  
 Invert tubes 8- 10 times and store upright at ambient temperature until collection. 
Label the tubes appropriately. Isolation and freezing should be completed under sterile technique, preferably a biosafety cabinet, and completed within 6 hours of blood collection.  Centrifuge for 20 minutes at 1700 x g. If after centrifugation the upper phase above the gel is not clear of RBCs, the tube should be centrifuged for an additional 15 minutes. After centrifugation, the PBMCs will be found in a diffuse, whitish layer

supernatant) 1- 2 more times. While waiting for the 2nd (or 3rd) wash, fill an 
insulated ice pan with ice. After the 2nd (or 3rd) wash is complete, remove a small 
aliquot to record the cell count and viability, then place tube on ice.   For each timepoint, collect the following parameters:  
i. Cell viability (%) before freezing  
ii. Total yield of PBMC s (x 106 cells/mL/vial) isolated prior to 
freezing  
 
Prepare a freezing container (e.g. Nalgene cat #5100- 0001 or equivalent) Remove 
the high- density polyethylene vial holder and foam insert from the Nalgene 
Freezing Container. Do not discard the foam insert. Container must be at room temperature prior to use. Do not pre -chill. Add approximately 250 mL of 100% 
isopropyl alcohol to the fill line on the Freezing Container. Do not overfill. Carefully replace the foam insert and vial holder in the Freezing Container.  To freeze the PBMCs: Important to Note: PBMC Freezing media contains DMSO, which is toxic to the cells if they are not frozen immediately after suspension in freezing media. Flick 15mL centrifuge tube containing the PBMC pellet to resuspend cel ls. Using a transfer pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462], quickly resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of 
COLD Freezing Medium.

 Crizotinib has been studied in multiple phase I to III trials.  Side effects of crizotinib that are commonly seen including nausea, vomiting, and visual changes, including floaters, flashes of light, double vision and blurred vision.  More uncommon side effects of crizotinib include fatigue, constipation, altered taste, edema, elevated transaminases, dizziness, and anorexia.  Rare, but serious side effects include neutropenia, anemia, renal dysfunction, arrhythmias, hypotension, hyponatremia, and pneumonitis.  Patients will be monitored closely for toxicity and the dose of crizotinib may be adjusted as suggested in the tables below.  Up to 2 dose reductions may be performed.  Should further intolerable toxicity occur despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] 2 dose reductions, then treatment will be discontinued.  Investigators should reference the current approved prescribing information for additional dose modifications.

pharmacovigilance study titled “A Descriptive Study of Potential Sight Threatening/Severe 
Visual Loss Following Exposure to XALKORI” (Study A8081062). The objective of this study is to evaluate risk factors for, and outcomes of, PST or SVL adverse events among patients with cancer being treated with crizotinib. The study is due to commence on March 31, 2016 and end on March 31, 2021.  In all crizotinib -treated patients, Grade ≥[ADDRESS_220970] (except for Visual fi eld defect, for which 
Grade ≥[ADDRESS_220971]) or SVL should be treated as Serious Adverse Events, regardless of relatedness to study drug.

12. CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
Imaging studies will be conducted to evaluate tumor recurrence as outlined in the study 
calendar.  Additional imaging studies may be performed at the discretion of the investigator .  The same method(s) of tumor assessment and the same technique(s) should 
be used at each radiologic evaluation to confirm that there are no new lesions or to identify and follow any new lesions.  At the time of a patient’s enrollment in this study, there  should 
be no current radiological evidence of disease.  Any clinical or radiographic evidence of recurrence is considered evidence of progression.   When there is radiologic evidence of recurrence, pathologic confirmation should be obtained whenever possible.  Other imaging studies may be used in conjunction with the study mandated imaging to help the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_186990], although these scans should not replace CT imaging in terms 
of disease follow -up for this study.  If biopsy is not possible and there are indeterminate 
radiographic findings, repeat imaging studies at a [ADDRESS_220975] dose of the study drugs for a follow -up 
evaluation.  Any assessments listed f or the final visit in the study calendar will be 
performed at that time.  
 Other reasons for study discontinuation include, but are not limited to:  
• Non-compliance with the defined treatment plan  
• Investigator’s decision based on patient’s best interest  
• Withdrawal of consent 
• Severe, unexpected toxicities/side effects  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Completion of study requirements after being followed for at least 32 months for survival

    14. BIOSTATISTICS  
 
We anticipate a total accrual period of 1 to 2 years (accr ual rate of 1 to 2 patients per month 
on the treatment portion of the study) and additional follow -up after the accrual interval of 
32 months.  Prior data indicate that 40% of all uveal melanoma patients have Class II, high risk tumors. The median relapse free survival of this group of high- risk patients is 
approximately 32 months .  We hypothesize that the addition of crizotinib will increase the 
32-month RFS by 25%.  Thus, a 32 month relapse free rate of 50%  would be considered 
not promising and a 32 month relapse free rate of 75% or greater would be considered promising.  A single stage design based on a binomial probability estimate will be utilized with an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_220976] 20 out of 30 patients are 
free of distant relapse at 32 months, this adjuvant treatment with crizotinib will be considered worthy of further study. This design yields a 90% probability of a positive result if the relapse free rate at [ADDRESS_220977] 75% and a 95% probability of a negative result if the true relapse free rate is 50% at 32 months. In order to account for an estimated 5% dropout rate, [ADDRESS_220978] been followed for 30 months will be included in the analysis.   The median, 1- year, 2 -year, and 3 -year RFS rates will be assessed.  RFS rate will be defined 
as the percentage of patients who do not experience any new tumor growth at any site on the body distant from the primary site or death from any cause from the time of primary 
therapy of the uveal melanoma (date of enucleation or day of removal of the radioactive plaque) to the end of the relevant time  point. All patients who do not withdraw consent will 
be contact[CONTACT_5365] a minimum of three years from start of study treatment for survival data.  Overall survival (OS) will be defined as the time from treatment start to date  of death or 
last followup and estimated using Kaplan- Meier methodology.  Disease -specific survival 
(DSS) is defined as the time from treatment start to death due to disease or last followup. Patients who die from other causes will be censored.  
 The safety  and tolerability of crizotinib will be determined by [CONTACT_187031], physical 
examinations, and laboratory tests. Frequencies of toxicities by [CONTACT_187032].  
 The FACT -M total score will be computed as sum of all 27 item score s.  Four subscale 
scores will be derived from the 27 items:  
 
• Physical Well -being (PWB) 
• Social Well -being (SWB) 
• Emotional Well-being (EWB) 
• Functional Well-being (FWB) 
From the additional [ADDRESS_220979] -M questionnaire, a total  Melanoma Subscale 
(MS) score will be derived in the following manner: MS = (sum of non- missing item 
Columbia University Medical Center  
Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center

Version - 25 JAN 2023 
 
    scores) multiplied by (16 divided by [CONTACT_154562]- missing items).  The total and 
domain score will be summarized using descriptive statistics (e.g., N, mean, SE, median, 
minimum, maximum) for each assessment time.  
 If this clinical trial meets its efficacy endpoint, ≤10 patients will experience disease 
recurrent by 32 months.  Conservatively assuming that 20% of patients will have 
insufficient material for testing, we will have 8 matched primary/metastatic sample sets for comparison. More samples will be available if the recurrence rate is greater.   Given the 
potentially limited number of matched samples available, this analysis will be hypothesis 
generating for the development of future studies with larger sample sizes.  We will analyze 
each matched pair for differential gene expression and expression of each gene of interest in all primar y and metastatic specimens will be summarized as means +/ - standard errors 
of the means, with statistically significant differences between control and tumor samples assessed by [CONTACT_54959] t -test.

16. DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUES  
 
16.1 DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event lists, guidelines, and instructions for AE reporting can be found in Section 
18.0 (Adverse Events: List and Reporting Requirements).  The Data Safety Monitoring 
Plan is described in Section 16.1.3. 
 
16.1.1 Data Collection  The Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center has an electronic clinical trials 
and data management system (CTMS) that will be used for data collection. CRFs for the study will be built into the CTMS for data entry. The system has full auditing capabilities which is web -based and housed on a server in a fully HIPAA compliant 
server room with restricted access and video camera monitoring.  All users must login with their own application username [CONTACT_2383].  Users off campus must first access the Virtual Private Network with their assigned campus username [CONTACT_141846].  Users are only able to see study information if they are indicated as study personnel in our electronic IRB system. Users are limited to access based on the role ass igned in their corresponding 
protocol.  Subject data is entered directly into the system, which (in the case of Columbia subjects) confirms the correct identity of patients via an interface with the electronic medical patient index.  Staff with the appropr iate IRB defined roles 
can run reports within the system for reporting purposes.  16.1.[ADDRESS_220981] enrolled into the clinical study through the CTMS. It is the investigator’s responsibility for ens uring that all 
clinical and laboratory data entered on the corresponding CRFs are complete, accurate and authentic.  
 16.1.3 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
 The NCI -approved Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) of the Herbert 
Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC) will monitor every subject who receives treatment on this protocol for toxicity. This protocol will adhere to the policies of the currently approved HICCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP), which is in accordance with NCI and CUMC-IRB policy and guidelines.  The committee is chair is appointed by [CONTACT_187035]. The committee

DSMC’s review of the cumulative toxicities reported from all participating sites without specific disclosure by [CONTACT_2939].  It will also inform site investigators of the study the DSMC’s conclusion with respect to progress or need for 
modification of the protocol.    16.1.[ADDRESS_220983] charts, and data elements to be monitored. The Compliance Coordinator will review the study status and summarize enrollment, toxicities, SAEs/UPs, dose escalation, statistical endpoints (e.g., stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] s), 
etc. for the full DSMC membership at the regularly scheduled meetings.    16.1.4 Internal On -site Monitoring:  
 • Initial, recurrent, and close -out on- site monitoring visits will also be 
conducted at remote clinical sites, as appropriate/feasible. Other  sites will have 
monitoring performed remotely (see below for further details).

      • The Compliance Coordinator will communicate with the site coordinator/Site Principle Investigator to schedule the monitoring visit and arrange for access to study material s and documentation. 
 • The assigned Compliance Coordinator will monitor IIT trials within [ADDRESS_220984] is enrolled and throughout the life of the study to ensure that the study is being conducted in accordance with the protocol, GCP, ap plicable federal and local regulations, and per all applicable SOPs. 
The Compliance Coordinator is responsible to notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_141769]/CRN/CRC of upcoming monitor visits and convey what information and documentation will be required for the visit(s).  The Compliance Coordinator is responsible for verifying that informed consent is properly obtained, eligibility is met (via the central registration process), and all study procedures are conducted according to the study protocol. The Compliance Coordinator will also verify that the data reported in the CRF’s 
accurately reflect source documents, that all toxicities have been reported to date, and that all SAE’s/UPs/deviations/violations have been reported according to local IRB and HICCC DSMC requirements. The Compliance Coordinator will issue queries and ensure resolution in a timely and efficient manner.  The Compliance Coordinator will also monitor for applicable regulatory compliance and research pharmacy compliance (if applicable) and communicate any defi ciencies as appropriate.  
 16.1.[ADDRESS_220985] (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:   • What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study 
• Who will have access to that information and why • Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (e.g., that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.

Adverse  events  
 
Investigational Agent :  Include a comprehensive list of all reported adverse events and any 
potential risks (such as the toxicities seen with another agent of the same class or risks seen in animals administered this agent) as provided by [CONTACT_3455]. 
 
Adverse Event List(s) for Other Agent(s):  For each commercial agent, please provide a 
list of those adverse events most likely to occur on this study, and refer the reader to the 
Columbia University Medical Center

37 
Version - 25 JAN 2023 
 
    package insert(s) for the comprehensive list of adverse events.  
 17.1 Definitions  
 
Adverse Event:  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including abnormal sign, symptom or disease, temporally associated with  the subject’s participation in research, whether or not considered 
related to the subject’s participation in the research. Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal 
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests 
• is considered by [CONTACT_187037]:  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious.  A serious adverse event is any AE that is:  
 
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186992], unless:  
o routine treatment  or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condiction (procedures such as central line placements, paracentesis, pain control)  
o elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug 
o treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of an SAE given above/below and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186993]  
o social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_064]’s general condiction 
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• an important medical event 
 Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, 
but are clearly of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted 
above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in-

Version - 25 JAN 2023 
 
    patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186994].   All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious events should be regarded as non -serious adverse events.   
 
Unanticipated Problem:  
An unanticipated problem is any incident, experience or outcome involving risks to subjects or others in any human subjects research that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the IRB -approval protocol and informed consent 
document, and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; 
• Related or possibly related to participation in such research (e.g., there  is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_187038]); and  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures (e.g., after the first dose of study treatment) to the end of the study treatment (e.g., last dose of study treatment) and/or follow-up.   
 
Baseline/Preexisti ng Condition 
A baseline/preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study. A preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or if the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
 
Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is 
otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.

Version - 25 JAN 2023 
 
    Abnormal Laboratory Values 
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the following conditions is met:   
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity 
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management (e.g., change of dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, 
further diagnostic investigation, etc.). 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186995] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event.   
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be 
reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5111].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186996], unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844]. 
 
Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact [CONTACT_1155], the investigator must seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it 
has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occur s 
after the study period and is considered to be possibly
 related to the study treatment 
or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.

17.2.1     IRB Notification by [CONTACT_2728]- Investigator  
 
Reports of all events (including follow -up information) that meet the definition of an 
unanticipated problem posing risk to subjects or others must be submitted to the IRB within one week (5 business days) following the occurrence of the unanticipated problem or the principal investigator’s acquiring knowledge of the unanticipated problem  in accordance 
with IRB policy. Additionally, the sponsor -investigator will submit a summary of all 
Unanticipated problems that occurred since the beginning of the study at the ti me of 
continuing review. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_186997].  
 
17.2.2 DSMC Reporting by [CONTACT_187039] t o be reported to the 
HICCC DSMC. Reporting should occur within 24 hours of knowledge of the SAE 
occurring at our institution or affiliate sites.  
 17.2.3 Reporting to Drug Manufacturer by [CONTACT_2728]-Investigator 
 
The Sponsor -Investigator will report to investigational agent manufacturer any serious 
adverse events within 24 hours of becoming aware of it on the [COMPANY_007] Investigator -Initiated 
Research Serious Adverse Event (IIR SAE) Form/HICCC DSMC SAE Form and 
submitting with the [COMPANY_007] -provided Reportable Events Fax Cover Sheet , 
so that these 
reports can be evaluated and included in the Investigator’s Brochure and for IND 
safety submissions per regulations. Reporting will occur by [CONTACT_187040].
 
 
If the SAE is fatal or life -threatening (i.e., causes an immediate risk of death) - regardless 
of the extent of the available information, the SAE must be reported immediately upon awareness.  
 
SAEs will be  reported to [COMPANY_007] from the time the subject receives the first dose of study 
drug through and including [ADDRESS_220988] (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the

The Affiliate site MUST submit a prospective deviation request to the CUMC lead PI [INVESTIGATOR_186998]. Approvals must be obtained from all entities prior to implementation at the Affiliate site.  If a prospective protocol deviation request is submitted for review (from an Affiliate site), the PI/site memo(s), HICCC DSMC approval(s) and correspondence and CUMC IRB eligibility deviation approval letter(s) should be forwarded to the Affiliate site for documentation. The Affiliate site is also required to obtain prospective local IRB approval as per institutional policies/procedures prior to implementing the proposed deviation and registering/enrolling the subject via CUMC Central Registration. All documents and determinations must be clearly documented in the study subject’s medical record, research chart and regulatory binder, as described. 
 
7. Guidelines for Affiliate Site Monitoring  
 
On-Site MCT Monitoring:  
 1. Initial, recurrent, and close -out on- site monitoring visits will also be conducted at 
Affiliate sites, as appropriate/feasible. Other sites will have monitoring performed remotely (see below for further details).  
 
a. The study Monitoring Visit Log will be completed and signed by [CONTACT_187046]/CRNP/CRN and/or CRC and will be filed in the regulatory binder.  
2. The Compliance Coordinator will communicate with the Affiliate site coordinator/Site Principle Investigator to schedule the monitoring visit and arrange for access to study materials and documentation.  
3. The Compliance Coordinator will monitor IIT trials within [ADDRESS_220995] is enrolled at the Affiliate site and throughout the life of the study to ensure that the study is being conducted in accordance with the protocol, GCP, applicable federal and local regulations, and per all applicable SOPs. The Compliance Coordinator is

version 3/31/16 
    responsible to notify the participating site PI [INVESTIGATOR_141769]/CRN/CRC of upcoming 
monitor visits and convey what information and documentation will be required for the visit(s).  The Compliance Coordinator is responsible for verifying that informed consent is properly obtained, eligibility is met (via the central registration process), and all study procedures are conducted according to the study protocol. The Compliance Coordinator will also verify that the data reported in the CRF’s accurately reflect source documents, that all toxicities have been reported to date, and that all SAE’s/UPs /deviations/violations have been reported according to Coordinating Center, 
local IRB and HICCC DSMC requirements. The Compliance Coordinator will issue queries and ensure resolution in a timely and efficient manner.  The Compliance Coordinator will also monitor for applicable regulatory compliance and research pharmacy compliance (if applicable) and communicate any deficiencies as appropriate.  
 
4. An SIV (or) teleconference will be scheduled and conducted prior to study drug being made available (if applicabl e) and before any subjects are enrolled on a study at the 
Affiliate site.  
 
MCT Remote Monitoring:  
 
1. When necessary (due to logistical constraints), Affiliate sites will be monitored remotely by a designated Compliance Coordinator. Sites will be informed of  this 
remote monitoring process on a site by [CONTACT_141832].  
2. Affiliate sites will be monitored by [CONTACT_141833] a regulatory level, as well as a clinical data/source documentation review level.  
 
3. Redacted source documents (applicable to supporting the protocol specific CRF data requirements) will be sent to the designated Compliance Coordinator via fax or secure email for all subjects enrolled at Affiliate sites. Timelines for submission procedures  
will be defined on a case by [CONTACT_413].   
 
4. The Compliance Coordinator will review all submitted redacted source documents against the data entered on the protocol specific CRFs. The Compliance Coordinator will issue queries when/if necessary.  
 
5. The Affiliate site research staff will respond to queries within 30 days. If queries remain outstanding, the Compliance Coordinator will send a delinquent query reminder for the outstanding items.  
6. The remote monitoring procedures will include review of applicable r edacted source 
documentation and supporting applicable documents to determine compliance regarding:  
a. Informed consent procedures 
b. Eligibility criteria  
c. Protocol specific treatment compliance

e. Protocol specific schedule of events (e.g., baseline visits, pre -treatment, on 
study, follow-up) 
f. Participating site IRB documents (e.g., IRB amendment approvals, annual 
renewals, SAE/UP submissions, violation/deviation submissions, INDSR submissions, etc). 
g. Requir ed specimen submissions (e.g., tissue specimens, research blood 
specimens, etc.)  
h. Pharmacy accountability records 
i. Adherence to the CRF submission timeframes to CUMC (within the protocol specified timeframes)  
 
7. Affiliate site remote monitoring reports will be  sent to the lead PI, HICCC DSMC, and 
Affiliate sites after each remote monitoring review. Reports will include information regarding data submission timeliness/accuracy, protocol adherence items, query resolution status, regulatory status, and overall Aff iliate site performance. These 
reports will be generated by [CONTACT_187047]. 
 
8. Dose Level Determinations:  
 
The sponsor -investigator will review enrollment for each dose level cohort during the 
regularly scheduled conference call with the affiliate sites.  
 The dose level for newly enrolled subjects will be determined by [CONTACT_187048] a subject has signed informed consent to participate in the study. The 
assigned dose level for any subject to begin study treatment will be communicated to the affiliate site along with the determination by [CONTACT_187049].   If a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is identified in a subject, the affiliate site must notify the sponsor -investigator via email at the study specific email address within 1 business day 
of identification. The lead site will communicate that a DLT has been experienced within 
1 business day.  
 
9. Adverse event reporting  
Sponsor reporting: Notifying participating investigators at affiliate sites of adverse events  
 It is the responsibility of the study sponsor to notify all aff iliate sites, in a written IND 
safety report, of any adverse event associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected, as well as any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a significant risk for human subjects.  Additionally, sponsors are also required to identify in IND safety reports all previous reports concerning similar adverse events and to analyze the significance of the current event in light of the previous reports.

    Monitoring Committee:  
 
All Unanticipated Problems (UPs) will be reported to the CUMC IRB. SAEs not 
constituting UPs will reported to the HICCC DSMC.   
 Each affiliate site will be responsible for saf ety reporting to their local IRB.  Investigators 
are responsible for complying with their local IRB’s reporting requirements, though must submit the required reports to their IRB no later than 7 calendar days following the occurrence of the UP or the Principal’s Investigator’s acquiring knowledge of the UP.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_187000].  Expected AEs must be reported at the time of continuing review of a protocol.  Guideli nes for Processing IND Safety Reports  
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations require sponsors of clinical studies to notify the FDA and all participating investigators of any serious and unexpected adverse experiences that are possibly related to the investigational agent. The CUMC 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_187001]. The Affiliate Institution investigator s are to review, send a copy to their IRB according to their 
local IRB’s policies and procedures, and file a copy with their regulatory documents. All Affiliate site INDSR submissions, along with IRB acknowledgment (per local policies and procedures) are t o be forwarded to CUMC for placement within the trial master file.  
 Reporting to Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_187002] s will r eport to their local  Risk Managem ent Office any subjec t 
safety  reports  or sentinel events  that require reporting according to institutional policy.  
 
10.  Confidentiality  
Each affiliate site will be assigned a site number. Each subject that signs consent should be assigned a unique code number consisting of site number followed by a number with each new subject being assigned the next sequential number (e.g., 04- 10). All si tes will be 
required to enter their data in the Velos eResearch, the Clinical Trial Management System used for all Cancer -related clinical research at CUMC. All users must login with their own 
application username [CONTACT_2383].  Users off campus must first  access the Virtual Private 
Network with their assigned campus username [CONTACT_141846].   
 Subject confidentiality must be maintained according to HIPAA regulations and GCP recommendations.   Except when required by [CONTACT_2371], study information shared with persons and organizations

version 3/31/[ADDRESS_221000] are published or presented at a scientific or medical 
meeting, the patient not be identified. Otherwise, all results will be kept confidential and will not be divulged (except as required by [CONTACT_2371]) without permission.  
 
11. Data Reporting Plan 
Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) is deeply committed to research integrity 
and strong credibility when it comes to the discovery of new treatment concepts, implementation of new clinical research techniques, and acceptance of its researcher's findings by [CONTACT_187050]. In accord with these ethics, CUMC encourages and supports its investigators in the sharing of final research data and/or details of newly developed clinical treatments.  
 CUMC's policies that pertain to patient data sharing conform to CUMC IRB rules, local and state laws, and HIPAA privacy regulations. The primary reason for this is to protect the privacy of patients who participate in clinical trials. The data can be made available for continuing review by [CONTACT_187051], Statistician, Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMC), and, in other instances, the CUMC IRB.  Data collected during the course of this clinical trial will primarily be shared with other investigators and University staff, the IRB, FDA, and other reporting agencies, and/or transferred to other collaborators.  Prior to transfer, the data collected must comply with, and must be limited by, the CUMC's guidelines for Protecting the Rights and Privacy of Human Subjects.    
12. Data Acquisition and Submission  
Informed consent, including HIPPA authorization, must be obtained on all subjects prior to their participation. Always keep the original signed and dated consent form, with the redacted source documents and eligibility checklist. Velos eResearch will be used as the electronic clinical trials and data management system. Affiliate sites will enter data directly into Velos eResearch via customized case report forms for th e study. The research staff 
will generate reports from Velos eResearch to ensure timely submission of data by [CONTACT_141839]. This resource allows for the timely analysis of particular data sets for safety analysis.  
 
13. Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_187003] n

    individual administered the investigational drug or employed as a control in the 
investigation. Case histories include the case report forms and supporting data including, 
for example, signed and dated consent forms and medical records including, for example, progress notes of the physician, the individual's hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3853](s), and the nurses' notes. The 
case history for each individual shall document that informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study.  Study documentation includes all CRFs, data correction forms or queries, source documents, Sponsor -Investigator correspondence, monitoring logs/letters, and regulatory 
documents (e.g., protocol and amendments, CHR correspondence and approval, signed patient consent forms).  Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities and all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical research study.  In accordance with FDA regulations, the investigator shall retain records for a period of 2 years following the date a marketing application is approved for the drug for the indication for which it is being investigated; or, if no application is to be filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and FDA is notified.

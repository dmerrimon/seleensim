 3 1.0 Background  
 
It is well established that exercise tolerance is strongly dependent on and limited by [CONTACT_876290].  Thus, it is often inferred that the reduced 
exercise tolerance commonly seen in extreme environments, including altitude, is a 
result of a frank limitation in skeletal muscle oxygen delivery.  At altitude, the mechanism 
behind r educed oxygen delivery to exercising muscle is traditionally believed to be a 
reduced blood content of oxygen (Chapman and Levine, 1999) .  The primary barrier to 
adequately oxygenating the arterial blood is the alveolar – capi[INVESTIGATOR_876281], 
where oxygen must diffuse across the alveolar wall, through the interstitial space, across 
the pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_876282], and ult imately bind with hemoglobin (Dempsey and 
Wagner, 1999) .  Any thickening of these tissues or fluid spaces will slow oxygen 
diffus ion and ultimately impair blood oxygenation.   
 
During heavy exercise in many trained individuals, a rise in histamine release from mast 
cells in the airways is commonly seen, due to the natural irritation of the airways fro m 
high levels of ventilation (Yo uness and Kivinen, 1984)  (Figure 1).  This causes an 
inflammatory response in the alveolar wall, increasing the diffusion distance oxygen 
must travel from t he alveoli to arterial blood (Anselme et al., 1994) .  While during 
exercise at sea level, a reduced rate of pulmonary oxygen diffusion may not be a limiting 
factor, at altitude, diffusion of oxygen is already slowed substantially (West, 2012) .  
Therefore, any intervention which could minimize a histamine -mediated inflammatory 
response could help to maxim ize arterial blood oxygenation at altitude and defend 
exercise performance.  Cetirizine (Zyrtec®) is a selective H1 receptor antagonist, which 
blocks histamine binding, thereby [CONTACT_876291] 
(Togias, 2003) .  Unlike oth er selective H1 receptor antagonists, like Diphenhydramine 
(Benadryl®), Cetirizine does not cross the blood -brain barrier as readily, and therefore 
has minimal side effects (e.g. drowsiness) which could negatively affect exercise 
performance.  
 
Whether a si mple, single intervention of Cetirizine / Zyrtec® use can improve exercise 
performance of active individuals  when acutely exposed to altitude is completely 
unknown.   
  
 
2.0 Rationale and Specific Aims  
 
Specific Aim  #1 – Determine the effect of Cetirizine (Zyrtec®) on exercise 
performance and arterial oxygenation with acute exposure to a simulated altitude  
 
For this project, healthy subjects will perform steady state and progressive work rate 
exercise, endurance performance time trials, and repeated sprint performance time trials 
in the laboratory at a simulated altitude of 30 00m (9900ft) after dosing with 1 0 mg of 
Cetirizine or a placebo in a repeated measures design.  Non -invasive techniques (pulse 
oximetry, near -infrared spectroscopy [NIRS]) will be utili zed to measure changes in 
arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation and skeletal muscle oxygenation at the level of the 
microvasculature during exercise.  
   
It is expected that after Cetirizine, blood and muscle microvascular oxygenation during 
heavy exercise will improve compared to placebo, ultimately improving exercise 
performance at altitude.

5.0 Study Procedures  
 
Study design:  Subjects will be asked to report to the laboratory on a three occasions, 
separated by a minimum of [ADDRESS_1224056] session of testing includes:  informed consent completion, completion of a 
general questionnaire, completion of a standard medical questionnaire, measures of 
height and weight, measures of body composition, resting pulmonary function testing , 
completion of a maximal oxygen uptake test on a cycle ergometer  (in normoxia) with 
measures of respi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] -volume characteristics, and familiarization with the 5km 
cycle ergometry time trial (TT)  in hypoxia  (14.3 % O 2, simulating 3000m) .  This session is 
expected to take approximately [ADDRESS_1224057] sessions will include Cetirizine (10 mg) or placebo ingestion , [ADDRESS_1224058] (time required to reach peak Cetirizine plasma levels ), a blood draw to measure 
plasma histamine levels, a brief warm -up, two [ADDRESS_1224059] -exercise 
blood draw to measure plas ma histamine levels .  These sessions are expected to take 
approximately 120 minutes each.  
 
During the hour between Cetirizine / placebo  ingestion and the beginning of the testing 
trial, subjects will be allowed to rest comfortably in the lab.  Sessions 2 a nd 3 will be 
randomized and counterbalanced.

Study procedures :  (Session 1) after completion of informed consent documents and 
questionnaires, height and weight will be measured.  Body composition will be measured 
by [CONTACT_88248].  Resting pulmonary function will then be performed as 
described by [CONTACT_876293] (specific procedures and measurements 
are detailed under “ Resting Pulmonary Function Testing ” below).  Following these 
measurements, subjects will be allowed to warm up on the cycle ergometer at a self -
selected speed for [ADDRESS_1224061]'s forehead to non -invasively measure arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation .  
Optodes from a near -infrared  spectroscopy device will be placed on the subject’s thigh 
and secured with a Velcro strap, in order to non -invasively measure oxygenated and 
deoxygenated heme -O2 carriers in the skeletal muscle.   
 
The maximal oxygen uptake test will begin with s ubjects p edaling at [ADDRESS_1224062] 
period, subjects will be asked to complete a familiarization 5km time trial on the cycle 
ergometer breathing a hypoxic inspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] (14.3 % O 2, simulating 3000m) in as short of a 
time as possible  (most subjects require between 8 and 12 minutes) .  Subjects will be 
able to self -select cadence and resistance on the ergometer.  
 
(Session 2 and 3)  Upon arrival at the lab, subject will be given either 10 mg of Cetirizine 
in pi[INVESTIGATOR_625347] a placebo ( 10 mg  of gelatin in capsule form).  Subjects will be allowed to sit 
comfortably or lie down for [ADDRESS_1224063] strap heart rate monitor, an oro -nasal face mask , a 
pulse oximeter sensor , and near -infrared spectroscopy optodes.   Subjects will then be 
asked t o complete two 5-minute cycling bouts at a constant, moderate intensity (as will 
be determined individually according to each  subject’s maximal oxygen uptake test 
performed on Session 1 , details below ).  Subjects will be allowed 5 minutes of passive 
recove ry after each of the 5 -minute cycling bouts.  Following the second recovery period, 
subjects will be asked to ride 5km, completing the distance in as short of a time as 
possible.  Subjects will be allowed to shift gears on the bike at will and pedal at any  RPM 
desired.  Feedback on distance completed will be shown on a video monitor and verbally 
announced every 1km.  During the TT, respi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] -volume measures will be 
completed by [CONTACT_876294][INVESTIGATOR_14008] (IC) maneuvers near  
the end of each kilometer of the TT.   Immediately following the TT, approximately 5 ml of 
blood will be drawn from an antecubital vein.  
 
Demographic and screening variables :  Age, height, weight, sex, body mass index, body 
composition (estimated percent l ean body mass and fat mass), pulmonary function 
measures (total lung capacity, vital capacity, forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_31737], 
lung diffusing capacity, and maximal voluntary ventilation).  
 
Dependent variables : exercise metabolic measures (VO 2, VCO 2, ventilation, heart rate), 
dyspnea an d rating of perceived exertion  during the 5km TT, time to completion of the 
5km TT, powe r output during the 5km TT, muscle oxygenation , plasma histamine levels . 
 
 
Specific Measures : 
 
Height and weight :  Height will be measured using a standard wall mounted, sliding 
height measuring board (stadiometer).  Weight will be measured by [CONTACT_792147].   
 
Body composition :  Subject stands in bare feet on an electrode imbedded scale (Tanita) 
and holds on to electrode imbedded handles.  An unnoticeable electrical current is 
passed through the subject for 2 seconds, from which resistance to electrical flow is 
measured and body composition is estimated.  
 
Resting Pulmonary Function Testing :  Subjects will be a sked to sit in a comfortable chair 
for approximately [ADDRESS_1224064].  Tests of breathing function are performed as 
described by [CONTACT_21629].  These tests include the measurement of 
total lung capacity (the volume of air the lungs can hold), vital capacity (the volume of air 
that can pushed out with one maximal breath ), FEV1 (the volume of air that can be 
forcefully breathed out in one second), maximal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_876284] 
(used to generate maximal flow -volume loops), l ung diffusing capacity and maximal 
voluntary ventilation (MVV; the maximal volume of air that  can breathed in 12 seconds).  
For all of these procedures, the subject will then be fitted with a rubber mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_876285].   
 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] -volume measu res:  At a number of time points during the exercise trials 
subjects will be asked to complete two inspi[INVESTIGATOR_14008] (IC) maneuvers by [CONTACT_82917][INVESTIGATOR_876286].  For the maximal oxygen 
uptake test the IC maneuver will be performed near the end of each minute of exercise, 
and for the TT near the end of every 1km.   
 8  
Near -infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measures : Near -infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS):  
Frequency domain NIRS will be used in vivo to non -invasively determine the volume of 
heme -O2 carriers in the exercising muscle microcirculation.  During the constant -load 
and 5km TT, the device probe will be placed on the surface of the right vastus lateralis .  
The device probe will be secured with a Velcro strap and wrapped with a cloth bandage 
to prevent movement and light leakage.  Position of the device probe will be marked with 
indelible marker and photographed to match placement between trials . 
 
Rating of perceived effort : At the completion  of each km during the 5km TT s ubject will 
be shown a chart and asked to point to a rating of perceived breathlessness (dyspnea) 
on a scale of 0 -10 (modified Borg scale).  Subjects will be familiarized with this scale 
prior to the TT and will be t old that 0 implies no “noticeable breathing effort above what 
occurs at rest” and 10 indicates “maximal ventilatory effort”.  Additionally, at the end of 
each km, subjects  will be asked to point to a chart to indicate their overall rating of 
perceived exertion (RPE ; 0-10 modified Borg scale  where 0 in implies “no effort” and 10 
indicates “maximal effort” ). 
 
Cetirizine  and placebo . 
Upon arrival at the laboratory for Sessions [ADDRESS_1224065] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_624405] 1 0mg of Cetirizine or a gelatin p lacebo.  Black colored (e.g. non -opaque) size 
[ADDRESS_1224066] -prandial, will not be delayed by [CONTACT_876295].   
 
Maximal oxygen uptake :  The subject will be asked to warm up on the cycle ergometer 
for 10 minutes at a comfortable, self -selected pace.  Subjects will be fitted with a) an oro -
nasal face mask which covers the nose and mouth, b) a chest strap heart rate monitor, 
and c) a pulse oximeter sensor will also be placed on the subject's  forehead to non -
invasively measure arterial oxygen content.  The subject will then be asked to pedal at a 
cadence between 80  and 110 rpm at a workload of 50 W.  The workload will be 
increased by 25W every minute until volitional exhaustion or until RPMs fa ll below 70 for 
3 seconds.  Expi[INVESTIGATOR_876287] a tube for the determination of 
oxygen content, CO 2 content, and expi[INVESTIGATOR_876288].  
 
Constant -load cycling : In sessions #2 and #3, subjects will be asked to complete five 
minutes of cycling at submaximal  workload s equal to 60% and 7 5% of VO 2max, as 
determine d in session #1.  Subjects will have five minutes of passive rest after each 5 - 
minute exercise bout.  
 
5km cycle performance trial : Subject will be asked to complete 5k m on the cycle 
ergometer in as sho rt a time as possible (fit individuals  typi[INVESTIGATOR_818675] 8 and 12 
minutes).  Subjects will be free to shift gears on the cycle and pedal at any cadence 
desire d.  Subjects will be given visual  feedback on distance travelled and verbal 
feedback every 1km.  
 
 9 Hypoxic inspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] :  Altitude will be simulated by [CONTACT_675853] a hypoxic inspi[INVESTIGATOR_337].  A 
commercially available, portable nitrogen generator (Colorado Altitude Training 
Systems)  will be  used to generate nitrogen rich air, in order to decrease the O 2 content 
to the specified level.  The nitrogen generator will be set to produce an outflow of 14.3% 
O2, equivalent to an altitude of 3000m / 9900 ft .  Note that t he mechanical design limits 
of the nitroge n generator only allows for a minimal O 2 level of 14. 3%.  Additionally , our 
laboratory O [ADDRESS_1224067] inspi[INVESTIGATOR_124856].   
Hypoxic gas from the generator will be collected in two large meteorological balloons, to 
serve a s the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_876289].   
 
Blood sampling :  In each of Sessions 2 and 3, subjects will be asked to give two blood 
samples of ~ 2-5 ml each:  one prior to beginning cycle exercise, and one after 
completing the 5km time trial.  Blood will be taken via routine venipuncture procedure 
from an antecubital vein using a 22g or smaller needle and a sodium EDTA treated 
(lavender top) vacutain er.  Standard precautions will be used, and an experienced 
investigator will perform the venipuncture.  Subjects will be free to choose the arm used 
for each venipuncture.   
 
 
 
6.[ADDRESS_1224068] number.  Thus, analysis of data will be done without any identifying features to 
individuals.  Statistical software will be u sed to analyze data for significance.  Results will 
be reported through traditional scientific outlets such as journals and presentations.  
Communication with the IRB regarding safety will be reported directly by [CONTACT_125137].   
 
 
7.0 Study Withdraw al/Discontinuation  
 
Subjects can voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time by [CONTACT_768537] (personal contact, email, phone, etc .).  
If a researcher on the project wishes to withdraw a subject from the study, they will 
 [ADDRESS_1224069] directly (personal contact, phone, email, etc .).  Possible indications 
for withdrawal by a researcher include:  concern that a subject  could injure himself 
performing one of the exercise tasks in the study (per haps due to poor coordination), 
results that do not meet the criteria for inclusion in the study, an abnormal response to 
exercise or hypoxic exposure , an abnormal response to Cetirizine, an inability to 
complete the exercise tests, inability of a subject to complete a task properly to obtain 
valid measures, etc . 
 
 
8.[ADDRESS_1224070] dependent variables  (e.g. mass, percent fat) .  A 2 x 2 (condition by [CONTACT_5586]) 
repeated measures ANOVA will be used to determine pre- vs. post -test differences 
across conditions with select dependent variables (e.g. plasma histamine).  A 2 x 5 
(condition by [CONTACT_5586]) repeated measures ANOVA with a priori simpl e main effects and a 
Bonfe rroni correction for multiple pairwise comparisons will be used to determine 
differences between condition s for select dependent variables (e.g. ventilation, VO 2, 
SpO 2) obtained at each km of the 5km time trials.   
 
A power analysis was completed using previous literature ( Prefaut  et al. , Med Sci Sports 
Exerc , 1997 ).  Their data examined the change in arterial PO [ADDRESS_1224071] (Cohen’s d) 
of 0.61.  Using a one tailed test to match our direct ional hypothesis, a power analysis 
with that treatment effect indicates that approximately 9 subjects will provide adequate 
statistical power (i.e. 1 – β > 0.80) to show significant differences at the p < 0.05 level  
(experiment -wise error rate) .  With the potential for drop -outs and non -qualifiers after the 
initial VO 2max screening, we anticipate testing a total of 15  subjects.  
 
 
9.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 
Data will be coded to help preserve confidentiality.  Data will be stored on computers in 
locked rooms or in password protected files.  Paper will be stored in locked rooms.  
Informed consent will be obtained and the testing procedures will be completed in  a 
closed, private laboratory setting at the School of Public Health, with only the subjects 
and investigators present.  
 
 
10.[ADDRESS_1224072] Retention  
 
The intention is to maintain the data indefinitely.  Once data are  to be deleted, paper will 
be shred ded and data permanently deleted from computers and portable storage 
mediums.

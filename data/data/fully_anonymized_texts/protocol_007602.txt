EMPA -TROPI[INVESTIGATOR_401289]: Are the "cardiac benefits" of Empagliflozin independent of its hypoglycemic activity?

Application Initiated By   
[CONTACT_401316]. A recent trial has 
shown significant reductions in adverse events. Cardiovascular mortality and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_401291] -of-care therapy in diabetics.  Some investigators have suggested that 
these benefits are independent of its glucose lowering effect and thus, Empagliflozin could be considered a 
"cardiac" drug.  
 
Our overall hypothesis is that the benefits attained  from empagliflozin were at least in part, mediated by a 
glucose - independent mechanism. Thus, we are proposing to conduct a study to investigate the postulated 
benefits of  empagliflozin vs placebo involving non -diabetic patients with heart failure.  
 
[ADDRESS_506043] in part, mediated by 
a glucose -independent mechanism. Thus, to demonstrate the existence of pleiot ropic (non -glucose dependent) 
effects associated with empagliflozin administration, we are proposing to conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_47669], double 
blind, placebo - control, single -center study to investigate the postulated "cardiovascular" benefits of 
empagliflozin  10mg/day vs placebo involving non -diabetic HF patients with reduced ejection fraction.  
 
Background  
Empagliflozin is the first glucose -lowering agent that not only improves glycemic control but also has 
cardiovascular benefits. The recent EMPA -OUTCOME tria l has shown significant reductions in major adverse 
cardiac events (MACE), cardiovascular mortality, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85060] (HF) with empagliflozin 
given on top of standard -of-care therapy for T2DM patients with cardiovascular  disease (CVD). Some 
investigators have suggested that these benefits may be independent of its hypoglycemic activity and thus, 
Empagliflozin could be considered a "cardiac" drug. This hypothesis has emanated from the data of the EMPA 
OUTCOME clinical tria l. 
 
Empagliflozin treatment did not have any effects on the rate of the traditional atherothrombotic events. The 
dramatic change driving the superiority of the primary composite outcome (major adverse CV events) was a 
significantly lower CV death rate (38%  relative risk reduction). In addition, there were also an impressive 35% 
and 38% relative risk reductions in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19934] (HF) and death from any cause. Of the major 
interest is that  these benefits occurred in the absence of any major  differences in glycemic, lipid, or blood 
pressure (BP) control.  Management of concomitant HF in T2DM is particularly challenging, as some glucose -
lowering agents, such as TZDs, are  contraindicated in patients with HF. Until recently, there was an unmet 
need for an oral agent that  improved glycemia as well as provided CV benefits, including decreasing HF in 
patients with, or at risk of, CVD.  
 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common chronic health conditions in the [LOCATION_002]; it 
affects  approximately 10% of adults with up to one -quarter being undiagnosed. T2DM is associated with 
substantial cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. Heart failure (HF) is a frequent co -morbid condition 
associated with poor prognosis in diabetes, particu larly among older patients. HF accounts for more than [ADDRESS_506044] on the urinary excretion of glucose 
without interfering with the physiologic response to hypoglycemia , and the other is their "positive" 
cardiovascular effects such as lowering blood pressure, arterial stiffness, urinary microalbuminuria and  
triglycerides while increasing HDL -cholesterol levels. The recent EMPA -OUTCOME trial showed significant 
reductions in major adverse cardiac events (MACE), CV mortality,  and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_401292] -of-care th erapy for T2DM and CVD.  Therefore, the combination of the  above -
mentioned observations led to some investigators to suggest that these benefits may be, at least in part, 
independent of its hypoglycemic activity and thus, Empagliflozin could be considered a  "cardiac" drug.  
 
Our overall hypothesis is that the benefits attained in the EMPA -OUTCOME were at least in part, mediated by 
a glucose -independent mechanism. Thus, to demonstrate the existence of pleiotropic (non -glucose dependent) 
 
[ADDRESS_506045] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_47669], double 
blind, placebo - control, single -center study to investigate the postulated "cardiovascular" benefits of 
empagliflozin 10mg/day vs placebo involving non -diabetic HF patien ts with reduced ejection fraction.  
 
Primary Endpoints  
The primary end -point will be to determine whether empagliflozin mitigates changes in LV end systolic volume 
(ESV) or LV end diastolic volume (EDV) in HF patients without diabetes when compared to place bo. We have 
chosen LV volume because it is the strongest predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes even after 
adjusting for LVEF and MI size (White HD Circulation. 1987;76:44 –51 and Migrino RQ Circulation. 
1997;96:116 –121).  
 
Secondary End-points  
1. To dete rmine changes in LV mass, LV -EF and remodeling index (LV mass/LV -EDV) with empagliflozin 
compared with placebo.  
2. To determine if there is a change in left atrial volume (an accurate indicator of chronic increase in LV filling 
pressures) with empagliflozin c ompared with placebo.  
3. To determine if there is a change in right ventricular (RV) EDV, RV -ESV and, RV -EF with empagliflozin 
compared with placebo.  
4. To determine if there is a change in cardiac interstitial fibrosis as assessed by T1 mappi[INVESTIGATOR_401293].  
5. To determine if there is a change in VO2 Oxygen consumption with empagliflozin compared with placebo.  
6. To determine if there is a change in Visceral and epi[INVESTIGATOR_401294].  
7. To determine if there is a change in arterial stiffness measured by [CONTACT_401317].  
8. To determine if there is a change in body composition analysis (BCA anthropromorphic measurements) 
with empagliflozin compared with  placebo.  
9. Effect of the treatment on several cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers with empagliflozin 
compared with placebo.  
10. To determine if there is a change in exercise tolerance by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_506046] infections, bone fractures, diabetic  
ketoacidosis and thromboembolic during the follow -up period. We will also assess survival, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_401295] (more visits, increase in prescription of diuretics, etc).

would take place if receiving payments that equal $[ADDRESS_506054] signed this form, 
you will be asked some questions and will undergo some tests at the screening visit to see if you qualify and if 
it is safe for you to join the study.  
All the procedures done during the study are solely for research purposes. The total volume blood collected  
during the 6 -months of the study duration will be 75 mls. (5 table spoons). Th is amount is much less than one 
blood donation and, therefore, should not affect your health.  
The procedures included in each one of the visits are described below:  
 
Visit 1 Scr eening : This visit with last approx. [ADDRESS_506055] at the 6th Floor of the Atran Building 
at the MSMC. We will ask you some questions about your medical history (about your health) and perform a 
physical exam that includes your weight, heig ht, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, and one EKG 
(checks the electrical activity of the heart). In addition, we will collect one sample of blood (1 table spoon) and 
urine to check for routine lab tests, hepatitis B and C, use of recreational d rugs use (amphetamines, 
barbiturates, cocaine, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], cannabinoids, etc.) and HIV test. The results of the drug testing will NOT be 
placed in your medical record.  
If you qualify and are willing to participate in the study, we will ask you to return for t he 2nd visit within the next 
30 days. In case you do not qualify, your participation will end in this visit.  
 
Visit 2 Randomization : This visit will be approx. 4 hours long. You will be asked to report to the 6th Floor, 
Room 20 of the Atran Building at the  MSMC in fasting state. This visit will serve to perform all the baseline 
(pre-treatment) procedures. The procedures to be performed during this visit will be:  
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging to study cardiac parameters of your cardiac function. You will be int roduced 
inside of a magnet where you should stay as quiet as possible for about [ADDRESS_506056] one blood sample (15ml 1 stable spoon) to study some blood parameters  
Following baseline testing procedures, you will be randomized to one of two possible treatment groups 
(Empagliflozin or Placebo). Randomization is a process used in clinical studies to make sure that the observed 
effects of study treatment are real. The st udy treatment you get will be chosen by [CONTACT_3364], like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin. 
 
[ADDRESS_506057] an equal chance of 
being assigned to either study treatment group. One group will receive a pi[INVESTIGATOR_401300] (10mg/day) while 
the other (placebo -control) group will receive a sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_401301]. The study pi[INVESTIGATOR_401302]. The study pi[INVESTIGATOR_401303]. You will be provided detailed instructions on how to take your study pi[INVESTIGATOR_401304].  
The treatments in this study will be 'blinded', meaning neither you nor the study investigators will know which 
study tre atment you are getting. This information could be obtained in an emergency however, you will not be 
told which study treatment you are getting, but your study doctor will know.  
At the end of this visit, we will provide you with a supply of the assigned pil ls and you will be allowed to go 
home. We will schedule your next visit within 1 -2 weeks of visit 2.  
 
Visit 3 Safety : This visit will last approx. [ADDRESS_506058] your vital signs (weight, height, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse) and 
collect one blood  sample (15mls or 1 table spoon) for routine lab test (lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], glucose, liver enzymes, etc.). We 
will ask you questions  about your health since your last visit. Thereafter, we will provide you w ith a supply of 
the assigned pi[INVESTIGATOR_401305].  
 
Visit 4 Maintenance : This visit will last approx.1 hour. Within 12 -14 weeks of the previous visit, you will be 
asked to report to the 6th  Floor of the MSMC in a fasting state. The reason for this visit is to continue 
monitoring the safety and efficacy of the medicine that you are taking. We will repeat the procedures done 
during your previous visit (i.e. record your vital signs and collect one blood sample for routine lab test) and ask 
you questions about your health status since your last visit.  Thereafter, we will provide you with a supply of the 
assigned pi[INVESTIGATOR_401305].  
 
Visit 5 Final : This will be the last visit and will h ave an approx. duration of approx. 4 hours. You will be asked to 
report to the 6th Floor of the Atran Building at the MSMC in a fasting state. During this visit, we will repeat the 
procedures performed during visit 2. The procedures will be:  Magnetic reson ance imaging, Oxygen 
consumption, [ADDRESS_506059] one blood sample (15 mls or 1 table 
spoon). We will  record your vital signs (body weight, height, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse) and 
EKG to check your h ealth status. The comparison of the results obtained during visit 2 and visit 5 will allow us 
to delineate the effects of the study drug. At the end of this visit, your participation in the study will end.  
 
Description of Procedures Being Performed  
Cardiac  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR) : CMR studies will be performed at the Cardiac Imaging Facilities 
of the Mount Sinai Heart under the direction of [CONTACT_401334] (Investigator of the proposal). Images will be 
acquired with a 3.0 Tesla magnet (Achieva, Phi lips Medical Systems, Netherlands). Steady -state free 
precession  short axis images (TR 3.6 ms, TE 1.6 ms, flip angle 45º, field of view 250 x 250 mm, SENSE factor 
3, voxel size  1 x 1 x 5 mm, no gap, number of averages 3, bandwidth 1286 Hz, 12 lines per seg ment) from the 
LV base  through LV apex will be used for the quantification of LV volumes, ejection fraction and mass. Late 
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) will be performed 15 minutes after the administration of gadolinium 
(Magnevist, 0.2 mmol/kg) using an in version - recovery fast gradient echo sequence (TR 9 ms, TE 5.4 ms, TI 
optimized to null normal myocardium, gating factor 3, field -of-view 250 x 250 mm, pi[INVESTIGATOR_206021] 1 x 1 x 5 mm, 
SENSE factor 3, number  of averages 3, bandwidth 232 Hz, TFE factor 16). A Look -Locker sequence will be 
performed before and 10 minutes after gadolinium administration to evaluate interstitial myocardial fibrosis 
using the T1 mappi[INVESTIGATOR_77145]. All CMR images will be blindly analyzed  using commercially available 
software (Extended MR Workspace, Philips Medical Systems, Netherlands). Epi[INVESTIGATOR_401306]

Power Analysis/Data Analysis Plan (Including Any Statistical Procedures)  
At the end of the study, the data analysis  will performed. All data will be presented as mean±SD. For statistical 
comparison, data will be initially tested for Normality by [CONTACT_401327] -Smirnov's test. In case the data 
follow a normal distribution, they will be compared between groups using a S tudent -t test. If the data do not 
follow a normal distribution, data will  be presented  as median ±  interquartilic range.  Medians will be  compared 
between  groups with the nonparametric Mann -Whitney's U (as 2  groups will be compared); when variances 
look different (ratio >2), the Welch t test will be used instead. Two -way repeated -measures ANOVA will be 
used to compare values between  2 groups at different time -points. All statistical calculations will be perfo rmed 
with SPSS 18.0. Differences will be considered statistically significant at values of P<0.05.  
 
 
  
 
[ADDRESS_506067].  Safety and tolerability  of the treatments is the major reason for visits

monitored at [ADDRESS_506069] for safety at study termination.  
 
Grading System to Evaluate Adverse Events  
The intensity of clinical AEs will be graded on a 3 -point scale (mild, moderate, severe) and will be reported on 
specific  AE pages of the CRF.  The three categories of intensity are defined as follows:  
 Mild. - The event may be noticeable to the subject. It does not usually influence daily activities, and 
normally does not require intervention.  
 Moderate. - The event may make t he subject uncomfortable. Performance of daily activities may be 
influenced, and intervention may be needed.  
 Severe. - The event may cause noticeable discomfort, and usually interferes with daily activities. The 
subject may not be able to continue in the s tudy, and treatment or intervention is usually needed.  
A mild, moderate, or severe AE may or may not be serious. These terms are used to describe the intensity of a

relationship to the study treatment, and reported as either rel ated or unrelated. The determination of the 
likelihood that the study treatment caused the AE will be provided by [CONTACT_093] . 
 
Procedures to Assure Data Accuracy  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_401311] (IoR). He will appoint a senior member of h is clinical research staff 
to serve as Study Coordinator, who will work closely with the Regulatory Manager of the Mount Sinai Heart, to 
monitor case report forms (CRFs) on a weekly basis, and the SMC will meet every [ADDRESS_506071] source documents. Source 
documents can include any of the following: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], research records, laboratory values, subject 
diaries, che cklists, pharmacy records, data recorded from automated instruments (such as ECG), medical 
transcriptions, magnetic media images, and x -rays.  
The Study Coordinator will work closely with the Mount Sinai Heart Regulatory Manager to compare the 
procedures de fined in the protocol as well as regulatory requirements to ensure data integrity. Internal auditing 
includes the review of all the regulatory documents; (IRB, regulatory agency correspondence) and clinical 
records.  The IoR and the Study Coordinator will e nsure the following regulatory requirements are met:  
- Verify investigator qualifications.  
- Review PI [INVESTIGATOR_9814] -investigator CV's and registrations and verify documentation was current at time of study 
visit. 
- Verify current certifications and lab normal ranges protocol -required procedures.  
- Verify equipment not covered under CLIA or CAP certifications are adequately maintained and review 
certifications.  
- Verify facilities remain adequate throughout the trial.  
- Ensure drug dispensation and storage complies with regu latory requirements.  
- Verify documentation in the master file of receipt of disposition/use and return of product.  
- Verify the master file contains guidelines for handling product.  
- Verify the site maintains records that indicate product has been supplied  only to eligible subjects at protocol 
specified doses.  
- The investigator's records for study drug shippi[INVESTIGATOR_401312] (if applicable).  
- Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_401313] (if applicable).  
- Review of dispensing logs including the  subject initials, number, dose or quantity and person dispensing.  
- Temperature log.  
- Return receipts.

- Documentation of the informed consent process or enrollment note. The staff member should evaluate for 
documentation of the informed consent discussion, a question and answer period, the subject had adequate 
time to reflect, make an informed decision, signed the informed consent prior to the initiatio n of any study 
procedures and received a copy of the signed informed consent.  
- Verify correct version of IRB -approved consent form was used.  
- Verify the subject completed a HIPAA form prior to enrollment.  
- Verify staff has adequate training and responsibiliti es have not been delegated to unauthorized individuals.

Amendment 1 (August 2017)
Amendment R ationale : 
This Amendment is to provide minor adjustments and clarifications to the protocol.
Changes to the protocol : 
Section 3.6.1: I n the protocol, it is defined “Approximately  [ADDRESS_561710] as 
part of the stud y.”   However, inconsistencies were discovered showing that the total 
blood volume adds up ~560 mL  based on the blood log (defined in the Site Operations 
Manual) . This was due to the collection of banking s amples for future use, if warranted b y 
study  results. The collection of banking samples are now removed (
108mL) , consequently, 
the total blood volume adds up to ~450 mL as originally  defined in the protocol. 
Section 3.1, Section 6.1.1, and Section 8 (Table 8 - 1, footnote 13) :The1 gram tablet 
formulation of calcium carbonate was changed to liquid formulation (4 mL) due to 
difficulty  in sourcing the tablet form ulation.
 
Section 5.2:  To ensure consistenc y, changes w eremade in the Prohibited Treatment : “a 
stable regimen for approximately  6 weeks prior to randomization ” to “a stable regimen for 
approximately  12 weeks prior to randomization” .
Section 8: T o be consistent with the protocol language , the time point s(2 and 4 hours) 
where VAS will be conducted is clarified in the Assessment schedule .
 
 
 
Minor corrections and updates were made as needed throughout the document.
Changes to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version of the 
protocol using strike through red font for deletions and red underlined for insertions.
A copy of this amended protocol will be sent to the Institutional Review Board 
(IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committee ( IECs) and Health Authorities .
The changes described in this amended protocol may require IRB/ IEC approval prior to 
implementation.

Clinical Trial Phase[COMPANY_001]
Phase II
Intervention type Investigational drug
Study type Interventional 
Purpose and 
rationaleThe purpose of this study  is to 1) to assess whether or not a meal containing 
low carbohydrate in the form of glucose and galactose is associated with less 
diarrhea compared to a high carbohydrate meal; 2) to assess the potential 
effects of supplem ents such as psyllium or calcium carbonate on alleviating 
diarrhea. 
Primary 
Objective(s)To assess the effects of meals with different carbohydrate content on 
diarrhea 
To assess the effects of supplements (psyllium and calcium carbonate) on 
diarrhea 
Secondary
ObjectivesTo assess the effects of LIK066 and carbohydrate in meal on fecal parameters
Study design This randomized, open -label, two-part, three -period cross -over design will 
enroll approximately 24 overweight or obese subjects in each part (A and B) 
for a total of approximately 48 subjects over the course of the 25 day study. 
Part A will assess the effects of % carbohydrate (50%, 25% and 0%) in the 
breakfast meals on diarrhea when LIK066 is administered immediately before 
the breakfast.  Part B of the study will assess the effects of a concomitant 
treatment with a supplement (calcium carbonate or psyllium) on diarrhea when 
LIK066 is administered immediately before a breakfast meal with 50% 
carbohydrate. 
The study will consist of an up to 24 day screenin g period, a 3 day 
baseline/run in period, three periods of treatment of [ADDRESS_561711] dose of LIK066.  The baseline, treatment, and washout 
perio ds will be conducted with subjects being domiciled (25 days 
consecutively). 
Diarrhea will be captured based on both reduced consistency (stools with 
Bristol Stool Chart (BSC) score of 6 or 7) and increased frequenc y (total 
number of bowel movements, total number of stools with BSC of 6 or 7).  
Symptoms such as urgency, bloating, flatus and abdominal pain will also be 
recorded for each bowel movement. The stool assessments include recording 
of the timing, weight, pH, consistency of stool using BSC according to the 
Assessment schedule . 
Population Overweight and obese subjects will be enrolled in this study.

1 Introduction
1.1 Background
Obesity  has become a major global health problem that contributes causall y to and 
exacerbates many serious co-morbidities including hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and 
importantly  type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In contrast to the numerous medicines that are available 
to treat these obesity -related diseases, relativel y few agents are available for the treatment of 
obesity  itself that are effective, safe or scalable to the size of the affected population 
(Morgen andSorensen 2014 ). A novel mechanism to lower body  weight is via inhibition of 
the sodium glucose co-transporters 1 and 2 (SGLTs) resulting in inhibition of the glucose 
absorption in the gut and reabsorption in the kidney  (Chao and Henry  2010). Inhealthy 
subjects, virtually  all of the filtered glucose is reabsorbed into the circulation and no glucose 
is detected in the urine. SGL T2 located in the segments 1 and 2 of the proximal tubule 
contributes to ~90% of reabsorption of the filtered glucose (Abdul -Ghani et al 2015). SGLT1 
is located in the more distal part of the proximal tubule, segment 3, and contributes to the 
remaining ~10% of filtered glucose. However, when SGLT2 is inhibited 
with empagliflozin 
(a SGL T2 inhibitor), SGTL 1 compensates for the reabsorption of filtered glucose and SGL T1 
is capable of reabsorbing >40% of filtered glucose load in a mouse model 
(Abdul -Ghani et al 2015; Macha et al 2014). In addition to expression in the kidney , SGLT1 
is also expressed in the small intestine, where it is require d for glucose and galactose 
absorption. Inhibition of enteric SGLT1 results in glucose and galactose malabsorption 
(Turk et
al1991), which results in calorie wasting and other potential endocrine -based weight 
loss mechanisms.
LIK066 is a potent dual inhibitor of SGLT1/2, which has been studied in healthy  subjects, 
patients with T2DM, and obese patients with elevated BMI.  LIK066 is generall y safe and 
well tolerated in the clinical studies being completed to date. LIK066 has a favorable 
pharmacokinetic profile (T1/2 10-16 hours), which allows once daily dosing.  LIK066 at 
150mg daily dose (as qd, bid or tid) results in a significant weig ht loss in obese patients and 
~6% of bod y weight loss was demonstrated after [ADDRESS_561712] frequent adverse event observed in a 12 
week study  in obese patients 
(LIK066X2201) associated with LIK066 was diarrhea. The observed diarrhea adverse event is 
likely  to be related to the complete inhibition of SGL T1 in the gut(Pfister et al 2011).  It is 
known that diarrhea observed in patients with SGL T1 inactivating mutation can be managed 
with elimination of glucose and galactose from the diet. Therefore, the observed 
LIK0 66-induced diarr hea may be managed by [CONTACT_442137] a low carbohy drate (especiall y 
glucose and galactose) diet when LIK066 is administered. This study  is designed to assess the 
effects of meals with different carboh ydrate content and supplements on the incidence of 
diarrhe a associated with LIK066 treatment, and to assess the potential effects of 
LIK06 6 on 
incretin hormones (GL P-1andPYY) in overweight or obese subjects.

healthy  subjects and patients with T2DM, a mechanistic study  in patients with T2DM, and a 
proof -of-concept study  in obese patients with normogl ycemia or dysglycemia in the US, and 
an ethnic sensitivity  study  in healthy  Japanese subjects. 
1.3.1 Human safety  and tolerabi lity data
LIK066 was administered to 72 health y subjects in the US, 36 health y subjects in Japan and 
41 patients with T2DM and 127 obese patients in the US. Overall, single doses of up to 
350mg and repeated doses of up to 300 mg for 14 days in health y subjects were generall y 
safe and tolerated. Treatment with LIK066 at 150 mg qd for 12 weeks was also shown to be 
safe and tolerated. AEs were predominantl y diarrhea and related GI AEs after single doses or 
multiple doses in the higher daily  dose groups (≥150 mg as qd, bid or tid). No SAEs, 
withdrawals from treatment for AEs or significant clinical, laboratory , or ECG abnormalities 
were related to LIK066 administration.
With the exception of a small increase in urinary  specific gravity , BUN and expected 
glucosu ria, there were no consistent differences between LIK066 and placebo treated subjects 
in the prevalence of any specific laboratory  abnormality , the number of subjects observed to 
have an abnormalit y, or in the magnitude of specific laboratory  abnormalities. In the most 
recently  completed clinical trial (CLIK066X2201) in obese patients, 12 week treatment with 
LIK066 at 150 mg qd appeared to lead to a minor increase in subjects with urine ketones 
(urine dipstick) and anion gap, although there were no epi[INVESTIGATOR_442121].

1.3.[ADDRESS_561714]. In obese patients with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2, treatment with LIK066 
150 mg qd for 12 weeks led to significant efficacy on lowering body  weight 
(5.70% reduction). Two weeks of treatment with 75 mg bid or 50 mg tid led to similar effects 
on body  weight loss (2.39 % and 2.38%, respectively ). In healthy  volunteers, administration 
of LIK066 dose dependently  increased urinary  glucose excretion (UGE) to a maximal level of

Inpatients with T2DM, administration of LIK066 (multiple daily  doses of 15 mg and single 
doses of 30, 300 mg) also increased urinary  glucose excretion, leading to a placebo -adjusted 
UGE 24of 90-100 g over 24-hours. A single dose administration of LIK066 at 15, 30 and 
300mg was associated with 30%, 31% and 48% reduction in the postprandial glucose levels 
during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), respectivel y. In addition, two week average 
blood glucose levels measured using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) decreased by 
41mg/dL following treatment with LIK066 [ADDRESS_561715] frequent adverse event observed in a 12 week study  in obese patients 
(LIK066X2201) associated with LIK066 was diarrhea. This diarrhea is likely  to be related to 
complete SGL T1 inhibition.  It is known that diarrhea related to SGLT1 inactivating mutation 
can be managed with elimination of glucose and galactose from the diet (Martin et al 1996). 
Therefore, the observed LIK066 -induced diarrhea may be managed by [CONTACT_442137] a low 
carboh ydrate diet when taking LIK066. The purpose of this study  is to assess the effects of 
meals with different carbohy drate content and supplements 
on the incidence of diarrhea 
associated with LIK066 treatment,  
 in overweight or obese subjects.
2 Study  objectives and endpoints
The objectives of this study  are: 1) to assess whether or not a meal containing low 
carboh ydrate in the form of glucose and galactose is associated with less diarrhea compared to 
a high carboh ydrate meal; 2) to assess the potential effects of supplements such as psy llium or 
calcium carbonate on alleviating diarrhea.

Part A of the study  will assess the effects of % carboh ydrate (50%, 25% and 0%) in the 
breakfast meals on diarrhea when LIK066 is administered immediately  before the breakfast.  
Part B of the study  will assess the effects of a concomitant treatment with a supplement 
(calcium carbonate or psy llium) on diarrhea when LIK066 is administered immediately  before 
a breakfast meal with 50% carboh ydrate. 
The primary  endpoint of this study  is the diarrhea events. Diarrhea is usually  defined by 
[CONTACT_442138]/or increased frequency of stools. Normal stool frequency  ranges 
from 3 per week to 2 per day. Bristol Stool Chart (BSC) is frequentl y used as a measure of 
consistency , and a score of 6 or 7 (pourable or watery  stool) isconsidered abnormal.  
Diarrhea even ts will be captured based on both reduced consistency  (stools with BSC score of 
6 or 7) and increased frequency  (total number of bowel movements, total number of stools 
with BSC of 6 or 7).  Symptoms such as urgency, bloating, flatus, and abdominal pain will 
also be recorded for each bowel movement.
The study  will consist of an up to 24 day  screening period, a 3 day  baseline/run in period, and 
three periods of treatment of [ADDRESS_561717] dose of LIK066.  
Thebaseline, treatment and washout periods will be conducted with subjects being domiciled 
for approximately  25 days (see Figure 3 -1and Figure 3-2). 
Screening (Day -28 to Day  -4)
Potential study  subjects will present to the clinical site for a screening visit where eligibility 
for the stud y will be evaluated.
Baseline/Run In (Day -3 to Day  -1)
Subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria at screening will be admitted to the clinical 
site on Day -3. A survey for food preference of each subject will be conducted so that meal 
menus can be provided to accommodate the usual diet habits of each individual. Asdiet 
changes may impact on the bowel movement habits, subjects participating in this study  will 
be encouraged to follow their usual dietary  habit whenever possible.  
During the baseline period, a standardized breakfast meal (600 calories with 
50% carboh ydrate, 15% protein and 35% fat) will be served; for lunch and dinner, menu 
options will be offered so that each subject can follow their usual diet following the standard 
nutritional guidance .

3.[ADDRESS_561732] meal on the LIK066 -induced diarrhea and potential treatments with a supplement in 
overweight or obese subjects. The study  will use a randomiz ed, open -label, two-part, 
three -period, cross- over design in each part of the study .
An open label design is considered appropriate because all the primary  and secondary  
endpoints assessed in this stud y are objective measures in nature. A crossover design is 
ideal as comparisons among treatment groups are based on within- subject differences 
which are associated with less variability  than between- subject differences. The main 
objective is to assess wheth er or not the diarrhea adverse event can be alleviated by  
[CONTACT_442139], therefore, placebo control is not needed.
The design of two parts (Par t A and Part B) with [ADDRESS_561733] statistically  efficient design for 
addressing the clinical questions.
A five day  washout period is considered sufficient base d on the fact that limited diarrhea 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_442122] 50 mg q d (one out of
40patients showed diarrhea on day  15 after 14 day  dosing in LIK066X2201).
A standardized breakfast meal (together with menu options for lunch and dinner) enables 
each subject to choose the diets following their usual eating habits during the run -in will 
normalize the bowel movement habit of each subject under similar meal conditions for the 
purpose of comparison during the treatment periods.
The overweight or obese subjects in this study  will closely  represent the patient population 
for LIK066, which is being developed as a pharmacotherap y for obesity.
Therefore, the study  design is considered adequate and appropriate to address the primary 
objectives, the stool consistency  and incidence of diarrhea associated with LIK066 treatment, 
which are endpoints that can be measured objectively .

3.5 Purpose and timing of interim analy ses/design adaptations
An interim analy sis is not planned, but may be conducted before all subjects complete the 
study  if deemed necessary . Depending on the progress of the trial, the analysis may be 
conducted to support decision making concerning the current clinical study , thesponsor’s 
clinical development strategy  in general, or in case of any  safet y concerns. 
3.6 Risks and benefits
There is no anticipated therapeutic benefit expected for subjects participating in this study . 
The risk to participants in this trial will be minimi zed by [CONTACT_275416]/exclusion 
criteria, close clinical monitoring during the treatment periods, and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_442123] 7.5.
Risks of LIK066 administration in human subjects may include the development of 
gastrointestinal adverse reactions, postural hy potension due to volume depletion, ketoacidosis, 
urinary  tract infection, genitourinary  infection, renal and hepatic toxicity , and changes in 
calcium homeostasis with subsequent eff ects on bones, hy
pergl ycemia and hy poglycemia.
Doses of LIK066 proposed in this study  have been tested and deemed safe in healthy  subjects, 
patients with T2DM and obese patients. Subjects should be closely  monitored and treated 
according to the standard of care if deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_16310].  LIK066 is 
considered an aneugen at extremely  high doses. With the doses and treatment duration 
proposed in this study , more than 10-fold exposure multiple is maintained relative to the 
threshold NOE L exposure for aneugenicit y. LIK066 is not anticipated to increase the risk of 
adverse developmental or reproductive outcomes in humans when administered at the highest 
planned clinical dose of [ADDRESS_561734] adhere to the 
contraception requirement for the duration of the study  (Section 4.2). If there is any question 
that the subject will not reliably  comply , they  should not be entered in the study .
The supplements used in this study  are generall y well tolerated and widely  used as the OTC 
supplemen ts. Potential risks associated with psyllium are bloating and flatulence, and those 
associated with calcium carbonate are constipation, gas and burpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
Blood samples will be collected frequentl y during the study  either via venipuncture or cannula. 
Additi onal samples for monitoring of any safet y findings would be in addition to 
this. This is 
not considered to be a risk for this population. Risks associated with blood collection include 
pain, swelling and/or bruising at the inserti on site of the needle. Alt hough rare, localized clot 
formation, infections and nerve damage may  occur. Lightheadedness and/or fainting may  also 
occur during or shortly  after the blood draw.
There may  be unknown risks to LIK066 which may be serious and unforeseen.

6.At screening and baseline,  vital signs (s ystolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate) 
will be assessed in the sitting position after the subject has rested for at least three (3) 
minutes, and again when required after three (3) minutes in the standing position 
Investigators can be guided by  [CONTACT_442140]:
oral body temperature between 35.0 -37.5 °C
sitting sy stolic blood pressure, 90 -139 mm Hg
sitting diastolic blood pressure, 50- 89 mm Hg
sitting pulse rate, 40 -90 bpm
If vital signs are out
-of-range, the Investigator may  obtain two additional readings ,so that 
up to three (3) consecutive assessments are made, each after at least 30 minutes (one hour 
is recommended), and with the subject seated quietly  during the five (5) minutes 
preceding the assessment. At least the last reading must be within the rang es provided 
above in order for the subject to qualify.
When blood pressure and pulse will be taken again after 3 minutes standing, there shall be 
no more than a 20 mm Hg drop in s ystolic or 10 mm Hg drop in diastolic blood pressure 
and increase in heart ra te (>20 bpm) associated with clinical manifestation of postural 
hypotension.
All blood pressure measurements at other time -points should be assessed with the subject 
seated, unless stated otherwise in the protocol design, and utilizing the same arm for eac h 
determination.

moderate: sufficiently  discomforti ng to interfere with normal activities
severe: prevents normal activities
2.its relationship to the study  treatment  
Yes or
No
3.its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing an outcome of not 
recovered/not resolved must be reported.
4.whether it constitutes a SAE (see Section 9.2 for definition of SAE) and which seriousness

5.
Action taken regarding investigational treatment.
All adverse events must be treated appropriately. Treatment may include one or more of 
the following: 
no action taken (e.g. further observation only )
investigational treatment dosage increased/reduced
investigational treatment interrupted/withdrawn
concom itant medication or non -drug therap y given
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section 9.2 for definition of SAE)
6. its outcome (not recovered/not resolved; recovered/resolved; recovering/resolv ing, 
recovered/resolved with sequelae; fatal; or unknown). 
Information about common side effects alread y known about the investigational drug can be 
found in the Investigator's Brochure (IB).  Once an adverse event is detected, it must be 
followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and assessment should be 
made at each visit (or more frequentl y, if necessary ) of any changes in severity , the suspected 
relationship to the investigational drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.
The investigator must also instruct each subject to report any new adverse event (beyond the 
protocol observation period) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes 
might reasonabl y be related to study  treatment. This information must be recorded in the 
investigator’s source documents; however, if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE, it must be 
reported to [COMPANY_001].

9.2 Serious adverse event reporting
9.2.1 Definition of SA E
An SAE is defined as any adverse event (appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing) 
undesirable sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s)) which meets any one of the 
following criteria:
is fatal or life -threatening
results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
constitutes a congenital anomaly /birth defect
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]: 
treatment on an emergency  outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any  of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resu lting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]
social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_37207]’s 
general condition
is medically  significant, e.g. defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or may  
require medical or surgical intervention.
All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically  significant” if other 
seriousness criteria are not met.
Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically  might have 
caused death if it were more severe (see Annex I V, ICH-
E2D Guideline).
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations 
should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be 
immediately  life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_50068]. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_109000] (see Annex IV, ICH-E2D Guideline).
Any suspected tra nsmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a 
serious adverse reaction.
All AEs (serious and non-serious) are captured on the CRF; SAEs also require individual 
reporting to [COMPANY_001] Drug Safet y & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (DS&E) as per Section 9.2.[ADDRESS_561755] has 
provided informed consent and until 30 days [after the last study  visit/ following the last 
administration of study  treatment if there are post-treatment follow -
up visits with no required 
procedures] must be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence as 
described below. Any SAEs experienced after this period should only be reported to [COMPANY_001] 
if the investigator suspects a causal relationsh ip to study  treatment.

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 59
Amended Protocol Version v01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLIK066B2203
Note: SAEs reported by [CONTACT_442149].
All follow -up information f or the SAE including information on complications, progression of 
the initial SAE and recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_6537] -up to the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_30755] [ADDRESS_561756] describe whether the even t has resolved or continues, 
ifand how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not (if applicable) and whether the 
subject continued or withdrew from study  participation. Each re-occurrence, complication, or 
progression of the original event must be reported as a follow -up to that event regardless of 
when it occurs.
If the SAE is not previously  documented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert 
(new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study  treatment a Drug Safet y and 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_50070]. [COMPANY_001] may need to issue an Investigator 
Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same study  
treatment that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics 
committees in accordance with EU Guidance 2011/C 172/01 or as per national regulatory 
requirements in participating countries.
Follow the detailed instructions outlined in the Site Operations Manual regarding the 
submission process for repor ting SAEs to [COMPANY_001].   Note: SAEs must be reported to

9.4 Renal safety  monitoring
Renal events are defined as one of the following:
Confirmed (after ≥ 24h) increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 25 % compared to baseline 
during normal hy dration status, and deemed as a new onset renal events in subjects with 
reduced renal function at the discretion of investigator(s)
A doubling in the urinar y albumin- creatinine ratio (ACR) or urinary  protein -creatinine 
ratio (PCR).
New onset ( ≥1+) proteinuria or hematuria

9.5 Reporting Medication errors including misuse/abuse
Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administration or 
monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, patient/subject 
or consumer (EMA definition).
Misuse refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally  and inappropriatel y 
used not in accordance with the pro tocol.
Abuse corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicinal 
product, which is accompanied by  [CONTACT_50104].
All study  treatment errors and uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol will be 
collected in the dose administration record (DAR) CRF.  Study  treatment errors are only  to be 
reported to [COMPANY_001] Drug Safet y and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_50071].
All instances of misuse or abuse must be documented in the adverse event (AE) CRF 
irrespective of the misuse/abuse being associated with an AE/SAE. In addition, all instances 
of misuse or abuse must be reported to [COMPANY_001] Drug Safet y and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] . As such, 
instances of misuse or abuse are also tobe reported using the SAE form/CRF. Table 9-1

The study  drug must be discontinued, though the subject may stay in the study , if she wishes 
to do so. All assessments that are considered as a risk during pregnancy  must not be 
performed. The subject may  continue all other protocol assessments.
Pregnancy  outcomes should be collected for the female partners of any males who took study 
treatment in this study . Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy  outcomes 
should be obtained from the mother. 
9.7 Early phase safety  monitoring
The Investigator will monitor adverse events in an ongoing manner and inform the Sponsor of 
any clinically  relevant observations. Any required safety  reviews will be made jointly  between 
medi cally qualified personnel representing theSponsor and Investigator. Such evaluations may 
occur verbally , but the outcome and key discussion points will besummarized in writing (e-mail) 
and made available to both Sponsor and all Investigator(s). Criteria pertaining to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_90348] /treatment or adapting the study  design are presented above.

During the course of the study, if any patient experiences symptoms of hypoglycemia 
(shakiness, nervousness, hunger, nausea, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], dizziness, orconfusion), they will be 
instructed to seek immediate medical evaluation and treatment.  
9.9 Monitoring orthostatic hy potension
Because orthostatic hypotension is a potential risk of LIK066 treatment, orthostatic blood 
pressure readings will be recorded throughout the study  as shown in the Assessment schedule .
Any patient with clinically significant symptomatic orthostasis (more than 20 mmHg drop in 
systolic or 10 mmHg drop in diastolic blood pressure and increase in heart rate >20bpm) will 
have the study  treatment placed on hold. In addition, individuals with orthostasis will be 
treated with volume replacement accordin g to standard of care (refer toSection
7.2
(Discontinuation of study treatment) .

close attention for any  signs of ketoacidosis. Signs and sy mptoms of ketoacidosis may  include 
deep and rapid breathing, nausea, vomiting, severe abdominal pain, co nfusion, unusual fatigue 
or sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], and coma. All signs and/or symptoms and results from relevant laboratory  tests 
must be reported on the AE eCRF. If ketoacidosis is confirmed, the study  treatment should be 
discontinued as per Section 7.2 (Discontinuation of study  treatment) and appropriate measures 
must be taken to correct the acidosis and monitor glucose levels according to standard of care.

10 Data revie w and database management
10.1 Site monitoring
Before study  initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a [COMPANY_001] 
representative will review the protocol and CRFs with the invest igators and their staff. 
During the study  [COMPANY_001] employ s several methods of ensuring protocol and GCP 
compliance and the quality /integrit y of the sites’ data. The monitor will visit the siteto check 
the completeness of subject records, the accuracy  of entries on the CRFs, the adherence to the 
protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and ensure that study  drug 
is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key  study  personnel 
must be available to assist the monitor during these visits.
The investigator must maintain source documents for each subject 
in the study , consisting of 
case and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) conta ining demographic and medical 
information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or 
assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the 
subject's file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by 
[CONTACT_423] (a signed copy  is given to the subject).
The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm 
their consistency  with the CRF entries. [COMPANY_001] monitoring standards require full verification 
for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the eligibility  criteria, documentation of 
SAEs, and the recording of data that will be used for all primary  and safet y variables. 
Additional checks of the consistency  of the source data with the CRFs are performed 
according to the study -specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about 
the identity  of the subjects will be disclosed.

11.4.3 Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations
The primary  analysis will be performed on all available data. There will be no imputation of 
missing data. 
11.4.4 Sensitivity analy ses
As a sensitivity  analysis, the interaction between treatment and day will be assessed, and if 
non-significant, the results from the 3 days will be averaged and corresponding model -based 
quantities extracted. 
Covariates such as baseline number of diarrhea may be included in the model when 
appropriate . 
The model assumption of negative binomial distribution will be examined, especiall y if over-
dispersion (i.e. variance>mean) exists. If the data doesn’t fit negative binomial distribution or 
over-dispersion doesn’t
exist, other models such as Poisson regression will be explored.  
The model assumption of no first-order carry -over effect may be evaluated by [CONTACT_442151]-order carry -over effects into the above statistical model, and performing a type [ADDRESS_561767].

distribution may  be evaluated in a similar fashion as the primary  endpoint. 
Other secondary  endpoints include average consistency  with Bristol stool chart, average stool 
pH, average stool weight over each [ADDRESS_561768]-squares mean and associated 80% CI for 
each treatment, and the estimated mean difference 
between each treatment, the p-value, and

11.7 Sample size calculation
The sample size justification for this study  is based on internal data from Part 2 of the LIK066 
obesity  PoC study  (LIK066X2201) on the 50 mg tid treatment regimen.
For patients on the 50 mg tid regimen, a mean (range) of 3.5 (0-12), 4.8 (0-18), and 3.9 (0 -18) 
daily  epi[INVESTIGATOR_442131] 1, [ADDRESS_561770] of the low 
carb diet or of the supplements is a reduction in the number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_442132] a mean 
of 3 epi[INVESTIGATOR_442133] 1.5 epi[INVESTIGATOR_914], or from a mean of 
5epi[INVESTIGATOR_442134] 3 per day , then 5 subjects per sequence per study  part (30 subjects total) 
with complete data will provide 80% power to detect the reduction. Assuming a drop-out rate 
of 37.5%, 8 subjects per sequence (48 total subjects) should be enrolled. 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 70
Amended Protocol Version v01 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLIK066B2203
These results are based on [ADDRESS_561771] 
effects , and assuming no carry over effects from one period to the next.
Two plausible scenarios for the variabilit y of the number of daily diarrhea epi[INVESTIGATOR_442135]: (1) assuming the variabilit y is as was observed in LIK066X2201, reflected by a 
dispersion parameter in the negative binomial model of 2.4, and (2) assuming the endpoint is 
less variable, reflected by a dispersion parameter of 1. In both scenarios, the power for 
detecting the reductions is at least 80%. Simulations were also performed under two
additional scenarios where non-zero period effects were assumed (a sequential 
increase/decrease of 0.1 in the log scale), and these also demonstrated 
sufficient power with
5 completers per sequence.
11.8 Power for analy sis of key secondary  variables
Power for key secondary  variables doesn’t apply  since there will be no formal hypothesis 
testing for the secondary  variables. 
11.9 Interim analy ses

Follow up within 2 -5 day s
Serum creatinine increase >50% Consider causes and possible interventions
Repeat assessment within 24 -48h if possible
Consider drug interruption or discontinuation 
unless other causes are diagnosed and 
corrected
Consider hospi[INVESTIGATOR_233610] -creatinine or albumin -creatinine ratio 
increase ≥ 2 -fold

new onset dipstick proteinuria ≥ 1+
or
Albumin -creatinine ratio (ACR) ≥ 30 mg/g or 
≥3 mg/mmol;
or
Protein -creatinine ratio (PCR ) ≥ 150 mg/g 
or >15 mg/mmolConsider causes and possible interventions
Assess serum albumin & serum protein
Repeat assessment to confirm

unless other causes are diagnosed and 
corrected
New onset glucosuria on urine dipstick (unless 
related to concomitant tr eatment, diabetes)Assess & document:
Blood glucose (fasting)
Serum creatinine
Urine albumin -creatinine ratio
New hematuria on dipstickAssess & document :
Urine sediment microscopy
Assess sCr and urine albumin- creatinine ratio
Exclude infection, trauma, bleeding from the 
distal urinary tract/bladder, menstruation
Consider bleeding disorder
Additional specialized assessments are available to assess renal function or renal pathology . 
(Note: In exceptional cases when a nephrologist considers a renal biopsy ,it is strongl y 
recommended to make specimen slides available for evaluation by [CONTACT_233645] y 
identify  project -wide patterns of nephrotoxicity .)

Whenever a renal event is identified, a detailed subject history  and examination are indicated 
to ide ntify , document and potentiall y eliminate risk factors that may have initiated or 
contributed to the event:
Blood pressure assessment (after [ADDRESS_561778], with an appropriate cuff size)
Signs and s ymptoms such as fever, headache, shortness of breath, back or abdominal pain, 
dysuria, hematuria, dependent or periorbital edema
Changes in blood pressure, body  weight, fluid intake, voiding pattern, or urine output
Concomitant events or procedures such as trauma, surgical procedures, cardiac or hepatic 
failure, contrast media or other known nephrotoxin administration, or other potential 
causes of renal d ysfunction, e.g., dehy dration, hemorrhage, tumor l ysis
Table 16-2 Follo w-up of ren al events
Action Follow up
Assess *, document and record in the Case 
Report Form (CRF) or via electronic data load. 
Review and record possible contributing factors 
to the renal event (co -medications, other co -
morbid conditions) and additional diagnostic 
procedures (MRI etc) in the CRF.Urine dipstick and sediment microscopy
Blood pressure and body weight
Serum creatinine, electrolytes (sodium, 
potassium, phosphate, calcium), bicarbonate 
and uric acid
Urine output
Monitor subject regularly (frequency at 
investigator’s discretion) until:Event resolution: (sCr within 10% of baseline or 
protein -creatinine ratio within 50% of baseline)
or
Event stabilization: sCr level with ±10% 
variability over last 6 months or protein -
creatinine ratio stabilization at a ne w level with 
±50% variability over last 6 months.
* Urine osmolality : in the absence of diuretics or chronic kidney  disease this can be a very 
sensitive metric for integrated kidney  function that requires excellent tubular function. A high 
urinary  osmolal ity in the setting of an increase in sCr will point toward a “pre-renal” cause 
rather than tubular toxicity.

2.1 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
2.1- Primary  objective:  to evaluate  the safety  and efficacy  of the use of R-MPV  followed  by [CONTACT_5019]- dose 
chemotherapy using thiotepa,  cyclophosphamide  and busulfan with stem cell rescue in patients with 
newly diagnosed PCSNL. Primary endpoint will be 1-year event-free survival  and acute treatment-related 
toxicity.  
 
2.2- Secondary  objectives: 
1- to evaluate  response rates with the combination of rituxima b  and  MPV as induction 
chemotherapy  
2- to determine  overall survival and progression-free  survival with this regimen 
3-  To evaluate the incidence  of treatment  related neurotoxicity with this regimen. 
 
3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
3.1- Treatment   for PCNSL  
PCNSL is a non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (NHL) that arises within the brain, eyes, leptomeninges  or 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], in the absence of systemic  disease. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_179799] a relatively rare tumor, its incidence  has 
been increasing   in the immunocompetent   patient  population  over  the past several  decades.1, [ADDRESS_524115] shown  that the addition of pre-irradiation  methotrexate   (MTX)  in doses  of 
1 g/m2  or higher significantly  improves patient survival.  Currently,  multiple  treatment regimens  using 
high dose MTX  alone  or in combination with other  chemotherapeutic  agents  have been reported. 
Although response  rates may reach  90% in some  series,  the incidence  of relapses  is high and progression 
free-survival   ranges  from 12 to  20 months. Relapse  yields  a reserved  prognosis  and is associated  with 
decreased quality  of life and survival.  The median overall survival  remains  30-60 months 3-6. Moreover, 
patients  successfully   treated  with chemoradiation   are at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_415819]3,  7, 8. 
The usual  form of presentation  of neurotoxicity  is of a devastating  subcortical  dementia,   with executive 
dysfunction,  memory abnormalities,  gait ataxia and incontinence.  Neurotoxicity is associated  with a fatal 
course in a majority of patients. The incidence  of neurotoxicity increases with longer survival and it has 
been reported  in up to 40%  of patients  treated  with chemotherapy  and radiation  therapy.  Elderly  are at 
increased  risk and the incidence  in patients  over 60 can  be as high as 90%. Some  studies  reporting on the 
use of intensive  chemotherapy regimens  without  RT in an attempt of decreasing the risk of neurotoxicity 
have demonstrated   increased   acute  toxicity   and/or  less effective   disease control.5, 6, 9-11 Therefore,  the 
optimal  treatment for PCNSL  remains   controversial. 
 
3.2- Methotrexate,   procarbazine  and vincristine   for PCNSL  
The rationale  underlying the choice of drugs  in PCNSL  is based  on two  premises:  demonstrated  
activity in non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  and penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Successful 
regimens  for non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  such as CHOP have been unsuccessful in the treatment  of 
PCNSL  because  of inability  of these drugs  to cross  an intact  blood- brain  barrier.  Although some  areas  of 
the tumor  may have a disrupted BBB,  several  reports  have demonstrated   the presence of tumor  cells 
beyond those  areas,  where  the BBB  is intact.[ADDRESS_524116] BBB when  used in doses  higher   than 1g/m2. Procarbazine   and vincristine   are drugs  that are active

IRB Number: 04- 129 A(18)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_524117] been i ncorporated in a variety of regimens 
for PCNSL, although  t he single  contribution  of these drugs is difficult  to ascertain.13 
The activity  of the combination  of methotrexate,   procarbazine  and vincristine   was demonstrated in 
a prospective  study conducted  by [CONTACT_415834].  That study enrolled 98 patients  with newly -diagnosed 
PCNSL. The  regimen  consisted  of IV MTX  2.5g/m2, IO MTX  12mg, vincristine   1.4g/m2 and 
procarbazine   100mg/m2, followed  by [CONTACT_218116].   A complete  response  to chemotherapy was observed  in 
58% of patients and a partial response in 36%. Median progression- free  survival  was 24 m onths and 
overall  survival  was 36.9 months.4  Another  prospective  study was conducted at Memorial  Sloan - 
Kettering using a similar  regimen,  but with MTX in a dose of 3.5g/m2. The median overall survival  was 
60 months.3  However,  in both studies, the incidence   of neurotoxicity  by [CONTACT_415835]  
(15 and 25%, respectively).   Nevertheless,   MPV  has been considered  the standard  of care by [CONTACT_415836], it will be used for achieving maximum  response rates as induction 
chemotherapy.  
 
 
3.3- The use of high- dose chemotherapy  with autologous   stem cell rescue in PCNSL  
High -dose chemotherapy  with or without   radiotherapy  with autologous   stem transplantation  has 
been  proven to be an effective   salvage treatment   modality  for refractory  or relapsed  NHL.  In patients  with 
chemosensitive  disease, the long-term disease free survival may approach 40 to 50% . Some studies have 
suggested an improved  outcome  when  high dose chemotherapy  with bone marrow  transplantation  is used 
as part of the initial treatment  of patients with poor prognos is/stage  IV NHL.14 
A study using high- dose chemotherapy  and stem cell rescue for refractory  or recurrent  PCNSL  
was reported by [CONTACT_415837]. Induction chemotherapy with high-dose cytarabine  and etoposide was 
given prior to stem cell harvesting to 22 pa tients. Two patients died after induction chemotherapy;  eight 
patients  achieved  a CR; four a PR and one had SD; seven  patients  had refractory  disease.  High -dose 
chemotherapy consisted of thiotepa (250m g/mg),  busulfan (10mg/kg)  and cyclophosphamide  (60mg/kg), 
followed  by [CONTACT_415838] 20 patients.  A CR was achieved  in 16 patients,  PR in 
two, SD in one; disease progressed  in one patient.  At least one death  was direct  consequence  of treatment,  
from severe thrombocytopenia.  Acute neurotoxicity  developed in two patients  (one of them  is the one 
patient  who died from bleeding).  The other  patient  recovered.  Chronic  neurotoxicity  developed in 5 
patients,  two of them  died from it. Among those  5 patients,  3 had received  prior RT, the other  two were 
older than 60. T hat study demonstrated  that the regimen utilized  was feasible and effective,  although 
cumulative  toxicity inherent  to patients with recurrent disease precluded better results.9 
Encouraging  results  with high- dose chemotherapy  and stem cell rescue in PCNSL  were also 
reported by C heng et al. Seven patients with unfavorable  prognostic  factors (KPS <50, a ge>60 or relapsed 
disease) were treated with an induction chemotherapy consisting of MTX 3.5g/m2, procarbazine 
100mg/m2  and cytarabine  3 g/m2.  A CR was obtained in one patient,  a PR in 5 patients  and PD in one. 
The high-dose regimen consisted of thiotepa 300mg/m2 and oral busulfan 4mg/kg, which achieved a CR 
in all patients. One early treatment-related  death occurred in a patient with multiple  comorbid medical 
conditions.  Five patients  were alive at 5, 8, 24, 36 and  42 months  of follow -up.  No neurotoxicity  had been  
observed but no patient  had been treated  with RT. This study  suggested that the use of drugs  that cross  the 
BBB  for the high- dose chemotherapy  part of the regimen  may achieve better  results  than non-crossing 
agents.15 
A study conducted in our institution treated  28 patients  with newly -diagnosed  PCNSL  with MTX  
3.5g/m2 and cytarabine  (3g/m2)  followed  by [CONTACT_415839]-cell rescue.  Of the 25 
patients  evaluable  for response, only 16 patients  had a PR or better  after MTX  and proceeded  to 
cytarabine.   After  cytarabine,   8 patients  had a CR and 6 had a PR; those  patients  proceeded  with HD

chemotherapy.   The other  two patients  did not proceed  with HD chemotherapy  because  of disease 
progression in one and systemic   complications   in another  patient.  Among the 14 patients  who were 
treated  with HD chemotherapy,   a CR was achieved  in 8 and PR in 2; disease  progressed in three patients; 
one patient died from transplantation-related  complicat ions.  The median event-free survival  was 9.[ADDRESS_524118] a good  CNS  penetration.10Therefore,   in the present  study,  MPV  will  be utilized   for 
improving initial response rates; the regimen described by [CONTACT_415840], busulfan and 
cyclophosphamide   will replace BEAM  in an attempt to decrease relapse rates,  since these  drugs  have a 
better  BBB  penetration.  
 
 
3.4- The role of Rituximab   in PCNSL  and NHL  
Rituximab   is a chimeric   anti-CD20  monoclonal   antibody  designed to target  the CD20  antigen  
which is a transmembrane  phosphoprotein expressed on greater than 90% of all B-celll      NHL’s lymphoma. 
Data from patients with systemic  lymphoma  indicates  that rituximab  may increase the susceptibility of 
tumor  cells to chemotherapy. 
 
Ruhstaller  et al evaluated the anti-tumor  activity and CNS penetration of intravenously  
administered  Rituximab  in a 38-year old male with follicular  lymphoma  relapsing in the CNS. Rituximab 
800 mg  was administered   intravenously  once weekly  for four weeks.   Following therapy,  marked  
neurologic  improvement  occurred and MRI showed reduction of leptomeningeal  enhancement.  Intrathecal 
cytarabine  and hydrocortisone  were then admini stered  weekly alternating with intravenous  Rituxima b  for 
two months and then alternating every two weeks for 3 months (total 12 Rituxima b  infusions  and 5 
intrathecal  chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]).   Eight  months after initiating this regimen,  neurological  evaluation was 
normal  and repeat  MRI showed  near complete disappearance of CNS  lesions.    Rituximab   peripheral  blood 
and cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872]  (CSF) levels  were measured 4 days after the sixth infusion and imme diately after 
the seventh infusion.   The CSF concentration was 1.76%  (10 uG/ml)  and 1.04%  (8.5 M L/ml)  of the 
corresponding serum levels after the sixth and seventh infusions,  respectively.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_179799] a heavy 
molecular   weight,  rituximab   may penetrate the BBB  via leakage across  areas  of BBB  breakdown and/or  
macromolecular  vesicular  transport of the antibody across an intact BBB.[ADDRESS_524119] 
2 
patient  was a 61-year-old man who received  Rituximab   375mg/m  administered   IV once weekly  for four 
doses.  The patient achieved a radiographic  partial response with clinical improvement.   The second 
subject  was a 39-year old woman  with a left periatrial lesion  who had a radiographic   partial  response  and 
2 
clinical stabilization following Rituximab  admini stered  as a 500 m g/m dose for four weeks.   The third 
patient  was a 71-year old man with leptomeningeal   disease who had no radiographic   response  after 
2 
receiving  500 mg/m 
2 of antibody for four doses.  The other  6 patients  received  doses  ranging between  
500mg/m  and 750mg/m2.17 
 
Wong et al. reported  their experience using the combination of rituximab   (375mg/m2)   and 
temozolomide   for PCNSL  in 7 patients.  That regimen  was well tolerated  and 5 patients  had an objective  
response.18  At MSKCC,  15 patients  with relapsed  or refractory  PCNSL  with a combination  of 
temozolomide   and Rituxan  (750 mg/m2).  A CR was observed in 6 patients  and a PR in 2. grade  3 anemia,

thrombocytopenia   and leukopenia   was seen in 4 patients.19 
 
In an ongoi ng clinical trial at MSKCC using the combination of rituximab  500m g/m2  and MPV, 
[ADDRESS_524120] completed  therapy  and were deemed  evaluable  for response. After  5 cycles  of R-MPV,  
13 patients  responded, but only 5/14 had  a CR. However,  after 7 cycles,  14 of  the 15 patients  achieved  a 
CR, suggesting that the combination  of Rituxan  and MPV  is effective  in PCNSL.  In that study, patients  
presenting with a CR will be treated  with reduced  dose RT (2340 cGy),  while   the remaining  patients  will 
be treated  with 4500 cGy.  Hematologic   toxicity  was the main adverse event,  with 1 grade  3 
thrombocytopenia,  one grade  3, one  grade  4 and one grade  5 neutropenia   among 18 patients  assessable  for 
toxicity.  Among non-hematologic   toxicity,  grade  3 nausea  and vomiting  occurred  in one patient; elevated  
ALT developed in a grade  3 in one and grade  4 in another  patient.20 
Based on these encouraging results, Rituxan will be added to MPV in an attempt to impr ove 
response rates to induction chemotherapy,  selecting more patients for the high-dose chemotherapy part of 
the treatment and maybe improving disease-free survival. 
 
3.5- Rationale  for this study 
This study  is an effort  to build on the results  of two prior MSKCC  studies:  98-[ADDRESS_524121] ion. 
To improve  the efficacy  of the high- dose chemotherapy  regimen,  the present  protocol  will 
incorporate different  drugs in comparison to protocol 98-96. That study used BEAM chemotherapy,  a 
well tolerated  regimen  that is particularly  safe in the elderly  (over  60) population,  which  constitutes   half 
of the patients  with PCNSL. However, in that study, nearly  50% of patients  relapsed   within  a few months  
after high- dose chemotherapy.   A possible  explanation for this lack of efficacy  is that the drugs  in BEAM  
may not achieve ideal levels in the CNS due to incomplete  penetration of the BBB. A study by [CONTACT_415841]-dose thiotepa and busulfan with stem-cell support in PCNSL resulted in lower relapse 
rates,  with acceptable toxicity9. A small study by [CONTACT_415842] (elderly,  poor functional  status or recurrent disease), demonstrated that the 
regimen  was effective  and well tolerated  in that population.[ADDRESS_524122]  that thiotepa  and 
busulfan may be more effective  than BEAM in preventing relapse in PCNSL and, therefore, we will 
utilize   the regimen  described  by [CONTACT_415843]-dose chemotherapy  portion of our study.

4.0 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION 
4.1- Design  
In this single   arm, multi-  institution,   phase  II trial, patients  with newly -diagnosed   PCNSL  will undergo 
base-line clinical  and radiographic  evaluation,  including neuropsychologic  evaluation and will be initially 
treated with induction chemotherapy,  which will consist of R-MPV (one cycle=14 days). After 5 initial 
cycles  of R-MPV,  all patients  will be evaluated  for response  with an MRI.  
 
4.1.1-   Patients with CR after the initial  5 cycles will proceed with the HD-chemotherapy portion of the 
study.  
 
4.1.2-   Patients with SD or PR after the initial  5 cycles will receive 2 additional cycles of R-MPV and  
will then be reassessed  with an another  MRI.   After  7 cycles,  those  with a CR, PR, or continued   
PR as compared  with the baseline (pretreatment)   MRI,  will proceed  to HD chemotherapy.    After  7 
cycles,  patients  with SD will be taken  off study.  
 
4.1.3-   Patients  with PD at any time or with PD after 7 cycles  of R-MPV  cycles  will be taken  off study.  
 
 
4.1.4-   Patients  will be off study at the time of death.  All patients  will be followed   for survival  every  6 
months throughout  their lifetime. Survival status may be obtained by [CONTACT_25600], clinical visit  or 
medical  records  (e.g. physician  notes/laboratory results  of clinic  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_62001]. 
 
The response  documented   in the MRI after the 5th or 7th cycles  of R-MPV  will be considered  
response rate to induction chemotherapy.  Patients selected for the HD-chemotherapy portion of the study 
will receive thiotepa, busulfan and cyclophosphamide  follow ed  by [CONTACT_415844].   Response rates to 
high-dose chemotherapy will be assessed [ADDRESS_524123] 
neuropsychologic  evaluation 6 months  after high-dose chemotherapy and every 6 months  thereafter. All 
patients will be follow ed  for survival. 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS  
5.1- Rituximab:  
Mechanism  of action:  rituximab   is a genetically  engineered   chimeric   (murine   and human)   monoclonal  
antibody  directed  against  the CD20  antigen  found  on the  surface of normal  cells and in high copy number  
on m alignant  B lymphocytes.   The Fab dom ain of rituxima b  binds to the CD20 antigen on B -lymphocytes 
and B-cell non-Hodgkin's  lymphomas,  and the Fc dom ain recruits immune  effector functions  to mediate 
B-cell lysis. Rituximab   is supplied as 100mg and 500mg of sterile,  preservative - free,  single - use 
vials. DO NOT  ADMINISTER  AS AN INTRAVENOUS  PUSH  OR BOLUS  
Preparation: Use appropriate aseptic technique.   Withdraw the necess ary amount  of Rituximab  and dilute 
to a final concentration of 1 to 4 mg/ml into an infusion bag containing either 0.9%  Sodium Chloride, 
USP,  or 5% Dextrose  in Water,  USP.   Gently  invert   the bat to mix the solution.  Discard  any unused 
portion left in the vial. 
 
5.2- Methotrexate:  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 04- 129 A(18)  
Approval date: 04 -Nov-2020  
Page  9 of 26  
  
 
Mechanism of action: Inhibition of dihydrofolate  reductase leads to partial depletion of reduced folates, 
which leads to inhibition of purine and thymidylate  biosynthesis. 
Formulation:  Methotrexate sodium for injection is supplied  as a sterile lyophilized 
powder, which  comes  in 20 mg, 50 mg  and 1 g, vials. 
Preparation:  Immediately  before  use the contents  of each vial should  be reconstituted  
with preservative  free medium (5% dextrose solution USP or sodium chloride  injection 
USP).   The 20 and  50 mg  vials should  be reconstituted   to a concentration  no greater  than 
25mg/ml;   the 1 g vial should be reconstituted   with 19.4 ml to a concentration  of 50 
mg/ml.   The drug is then further  diluted with D5W for intravenous  administration. 
Storage:  Vials should be stored  at room  temperature  and protected  from light. 
 
5.3-Vincristine:  
Mechanism  of action:   The mechanism  of action  of vincristine   has been related  to the 
inhibition of microtubule  formation in the mitotic  spi[INVESTIGATOR_86853],  resulting in an arrest of 
dividing cells at the metaphase stage.  
Formulation:  Preparation of vincristine  is for IV use, available  in 1mg, 2mg and 5mg 
vials. 
Preparation:  Do not add extra  fluid  to the vial prior to removal  of the dose. Withdraw  the 
solution of vincristine  into an accurate dry syringe,  measuring the dose carefully. 
 
5.4- Procarbazine:  
Mechanism  of action:  Procarbazine  may act by [CONTACT_415845],  RNA and DNA 
synthesis.   Studies have suggested that procarbazine  may inhibit  transmethylation of 
methyl groups of methionine  into t-RNA. The absence of functional  t-RNA could cause 
the cessation  of protein synthesis   and consequently  DNA and RNA synthesis.  
Formulation:  Procarbazine  is available  as capsules  containing the equivalent   of 50 mg  
procarbazine   as the hydrochloride.  
Preparation: Each capsule also contains cornstarch, mannitol and talc.  Gelatin capsule 
shells  contain  parabens  (methyl and propyl), potassium  sorbate,  titanium  dioxide, FD&C  
yellow   No. 6 and D&C  Yellow   No.10.  
Storage:  The drug is stored  in room  temperature.  
 
5.5- Busulfan (Busulfex): 
Mechanism  of action:  polyfunctional -alkylating agent  that interacts  with nucleic  acids  
causing inter-strand  cross-linking and DNA protein cross-linking.   Busulfan is 
extensively  metabolized   to inactive   compounds  that are renally  excreted.  
Formulation:  60 m g vials for intravenous  use 
Preparation: Sterile solution in 10 m l single  use clear glass ampoules each c ontaining 60 
mg of busulfan at concentration of 6 mg/ml for IV use 
Storage: Refrigerated  conditions  between 2-8°C 
 
5.6- Thiotepa  (Thioplex):  
Mechanism  of action:  cell cycle non-specific   chemotherapeutic   agent  capable of killing  
cells in any phase  of the cell cycle.   Thiotepa  forms  covalent   cross -links with DNA or 
DNA protein complexes,  resulting in cytotoxic,  mutagenic   and carcinogenic   effects.  
Formulation:   15mg vials. 
Preparation:  vials containing 15mg of non-pyrogenic,  sterile  lyophilized  powder

7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
Patients  will be recruited  from the Neurology and Neurosurgery  services.  All patients  will be seen by 
a Neuro-Oncology attending physician.  Every effort will be made to include  encourage eligible 
women  and minorities   to participate.  All patients  will be required  to sign a written  informed   consent  
prior to being registered  on this  protocol. Every  effort  will be made  to answer  questions  raised  by 
[CONTACT_415847][INVESTIGATOR_415820] a 
patient  to sign the consent  form.  
 
Estimated  accrual: based on pr evious clinical trials conducted at MSKCC, the estimated  accrual is 3-4 
patients/month.   Estimated   study duration:  2-3 years.  
 
 
8.0 PRETREATMENT  EVALUATION  
 
8.1- Bloods: CBC with white cell differential,  PT/PTT, screening profile  including  creatinine, 
electrolytes,   and liver enzymes   and EBV,  CMV,  HSV,  hepatitis   B and C serology.  
 
8.2- HIV testing within 3 months  prior to enrollment  in the protocol.  (Separate counseling and consent if 
done at MSKCC) 
 
8.3- Urine: 24 creatinine  clearance and routine urinalysis. 
 
8.4- Radiographic   studies:  Chest  X-ray (PA  and lateral),   CT scan of chest,  abdomen and pelvis,  MR scan 
of brain  with gadolinium   (CT scan may be substituted   if patient  has a medical  contraindication to MR 
scanning)  within 14 da ys of starting chemotherapy.   MR spectroscopy will be done if available  (not 
required  for protocol).  
 
8.5- Complete ophthalmologic  exam including slit lamp. 
 
8.6- A complete physical and neurological exam including KPS and MMS E. 
 
8.7- Baseline  neuropsychologic   evaluation  (appendix). If neuropsychological  evaluation  is not possible  
patients  may still participate   in the study.  
 
8.8- Bone  marrow  biopsy  and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337].  Results  of bone marrow  biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_415821],  but if evidence of bone marrow lymphomatous  infiltration is documented, then  the 
patient should be taken  off protocol since the patient no longer meets the definition of primary CNS 
lymphoma  and  therefore no longer meets eligibility criteria. Such patients will be treated at the discretion 
of treating physician and may continue  with induction  treatment  off-protocol if deem ed appropriate.

9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION   PLAN  
9.1- Induction  chemotherapy:  
After registration and initial evaluation,  patients will receive 5 cycles of the combination of Rituxima b, 
methotrexate   (MTX),  procarbazine and vincristine   (R-MPV).   Rituximab   will typi[INVESTIGATOR_415822].   Patients  will then be admitted  to receive methotrexate,   procarbazine,  and 
vincristine   as inpatients.    One cycle was defined  as [ADDRESS_524128]  of the following:  
 
 
2 
9.1.1-  Rituximab   500 mg/m  will be given intravenously on day 1 of  each cycle typi[INVESTIGATOR_415823].  
Prior to Rituxima b  infusion,  patients will be pre-medicated with lorazepam 0.5 m g - 1 mg IV, Benadryl 
25-50mg IV/po, Tylenol 650 m g po.  D emerol 25-50 m g will be given to the patient prn rigors. 
Rituximab   will be infused   over approximately 5 hours  or per institutional guidelines.  
 
 2 
9.1.2-  Methotrexate,   3.5 gm/m , diluted   in 500cc  D5W  containing   50meq NaHCO3 will be infused  
intravenously over approximately  [ADDRESS_524129]  pretreatment   hydration and 
alkalinization  of urine will be done per institutional  guidelines   (MSKCC:  Infuse  1 liter  D5W + 100mEq 
sodium  bicarbonate  over 4 hours  and urine output  should be > 150 ml/hour   and urine pH > 7.5 prior  to the 
start of the high- dose  Methotrexate).    Prior to MTX  administration,   1meq/kg of NaHCO 3 in 50cc  D5W  
will be given.  Oral NaHCO3 (2 tabs po q 6h ) will be given for the 3 days follow ing  M TX infusion to 
maintain urine pH > 7.0. If a patient is unable to take NaHCO3 by m outh, or if adequate alkalinization of 
the urine is not accomplished,   IV NaHCO 3 will be started.   15 meq  NaHCO3  in 50 cc  D5W  are 
administered  IV over 15 minut es  q 6h; the frequency can be  increased to every 4 hr if the urine pH 
remains   < 7.0.  
Leucovorin,  25 mg  po q 6h for 12 doses, (if a patient  is unable  to take oral leucovorin,  it will be 
administered  IV at 20 m g q 6 h r) will begin approximately 24 hours after MTX infusion and continue  for 
-8 
72 hours  or until the MTX  level is < 1 X  10 . 
MTX levels, CBC and electrolytes  (including BUN/Cr) will be obtained daily for 3 days follow ing MTX 
administration.    If MTX  levels  are toxic at 48 hrs  (>1 x 10-6 M), leucovorin will be increased  to 40 mg 
2 -8 
po/IV  q 4h and  total fluid  intake  will increase to 3000 cc/m  . MTX  levels  > 1 X  10 
2 at 72 hr  will dictate  
continued  leucovorin (40 mg po/IV  q 6h),  hydration at 3000 cc/m  /day and NaHCO 3 (or per institutional  
-8 
guidelines)   until MTX  level is [ADDRESS_524130] 1500 -1800 cc/m  2 
and increased  to 2000 cc/m  for the following  48 hours.  Patients  will be instructed  
to refrain  from eating  citrus  fruit, drinking citrus  fruit  juices  or taking vitamin  C supplements   during MTX  
administration  and for the following  72 hrs.  
 
 2 
9.1.3-  Vincristine   1.4mg/m  IV will be given  concomitantly with each dose of systemic   MTX.  
2 
Vincristine   is capped  at 2mg/m (or 2.8mg maximum dose).

2 
9.1.4-  Procarbazine,   beginning on day 2, 100mg/m  /day PO for [ADDRESS_524131],  
fifth,  and seventh (if patient receives this) cycle of R-MPV.  Patients will be maintained  on a tyramine- 
free diet during procarbazine  administration.  
9.1.5-  G-CSF support should be used with each cycle of induction chemotherapy.   Patients will be 
treated  with 5ug/kg/day subcutaneously daily for 3-[ADDRESS_524132] dose of 
procarbazine   (cycles  1,3,5,7)  or starting  96 hours  after MTX  dose or when  MTX  level is < 1 X  10 -8 
(cycles  2,4,6).  If for any reason  a patient  cannot  receive GCSF  then a CBC  should  be done at least twice  
a week between cycles of induction chemotherapy and between cycle 7 and the start of high-dose 
chemotherapy.  
 
9.1.6-  All patients  will undergo a repeat  brain  MRI (or CT) after 5 cycles.  The response  achieved  will 
determine  the total number  of cycles  as follows:  
 
-CR: Patients with CR after the initial  5 cycles will proceed with the HD-  chemotherapy 
portion of the study.  
 
-SD or PR:  Patients with SD or PR after the initial  5 cycles will receive 2 additional cycles 
of R-MPV  and will be reassessed  with an MRI.   After  7 cycles,  those  with a CR, PR, or 
continued  PR as compared  with the baseline  (pretreatment)   MRI,  will proceed  to HD 
chemotherapy.    After  7 cycles,  patients  with SD will be taken  off study.  
 
-PD: Patients  with PD after 5 cycles  of R-MPV  or after 7 cycles  of R-MPV  or with PD at 
any time during the study  will taken  off study.  
 
 
9.2- Peripheral  Blood  Stem  Cell Cytapheresis  
 
The peripheral  blood stem cell (PBSC)  harvest  procedure  will be performed  at the discretion of the 
hematology  attending   (usually  after  the 1st or 2nd cycle of R-MPV).   Cytapheresis   will start after bone  
6 
marrow  recovery  and repeated  daily up to day 7 until  a target  yield of > 5 X  10 
6 CD34+  cells  have been  
6 
collected;  the minimum acceptable  total yield is 2 X 10 CD 34+ cells/kg.  If fewer  than 2 X 10 CD34+  
cells are collected  then bone  marrow  harvest  is required.  The minimum  acceptable yield for patients  
[ADDRESS_524133]  is 1.5 X  10 mononuclear   cells/kg.  
 
Some  patients  will have inadequate  peripheral  venous  access  and require  placement   of a catheter  suitable  
for hemodialysis.  All patients will have a 13.5 Fr Davol double-lumen catheter (or similar  catheter) placed 
prior to PBSC  leukophoresis.  If this catheter  requires  replacement   subsequently,  a standard  10 Fr  catheter  
may be used.

9.3- HD chemotherapy  with autologous  stem  cell support  
 
9.3.1-  The high-dose chemotherapy program will include  thiotepa, busulfan and cyclophosphamide 
administered   as follows:  
 
 
Agent  Total  Dose  Route  Days  
Thiotepa  250 mg/m2/day  intravenous -9, -8, -7 
Busulfan 3.2 mg/kg/day  intravenous -6, -5, -4 
Cyclophosphamide  60mg/kg/day  intravenous -3, -[ADDRESS_524134] procedures. 
(Please see appendix for general  recommendations)  
 
 
[NOTE:  When  patient  weight  exceeds  the maximum  large  frame  value  from the Metropolitan Life table,  
doses  of chemotherapy  will be based  on ideal  body  weight,  not actual  weight   (ie. the maximum large 
frame  weight   from said table).]  
 
 
9.3.2-  Support  therapy  
Support  therapy  during high- dose  chemotherapy  and post-transplant   care will follow   institutional 
guidelines   and usually will include   the following:  
 
- Seizure prophylaxis:  all patients  should be on prophylactic   anticonvulsants   prior to the 
administration of busulfan.   The general recomme ndation in patients not already on an 
anticonvulsant  is to use a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  (clonazepam 2mg/day or diazepam 10mg/day) 
starting the first day of busulfan administration and continuing until the day after the last 
dose of busulfan. 
 
- Hydration:  To ensure  a urine output  >100 ml/hr   patients  will receive normal  saline at 200 
2 
ml/m  /hr  x 6 hours  prior to commencing  high- dose chemotherapy.   Normal  saline  plus 20 
(millie quivalents)  of KCL/l will be infused  intravenously between doses of busulfan and 
thiotepa and during the rest phase prior to stem cell reinfusion.   Subsequently,  intravenous 
fluid  requirements   will be dictated  by [CONTACT_415848].  Fluid intake  and output  
will be continuously measured.   If there is a lag in urine output  greater  than 800 ml/12  
hours, furosemide  or an equivalent  diuretic  should be admini stered  intravenously (± low 
dose dopa mine).  Prior to cyclophosphamide  infusion hydration  w ill consist of D51/2 NS + 
8 mEq  magnesium sulfate/Liter   + 20 mEq  potassium  chloride/liter   and D51/2 NS + 20mEq 
potassium  chloride/Liter   + 50 mEq  sodium  bicarbonate/Liter   to infuse   simultaneously  or 
alternate bottle sequence (prefer simultaneous  infusion).  Start IV hydration with each lit er 
at 75 ml/ hour  to total 150 ml/ hour  at 7 PM the night  before, then increase IV rate to 300 
ml/hour  (each lit er at 150 ml/ hour)  at 7AM the next day. After the infusion,  hydration will 
consist  of D51/2 NS  + 8 mEq magnesium   sulfate/Liter   + 20 mEq  potassium  chloride/Liter

and D51/2 NS  + 20 mEq  potassium  chloride/Liter   + 50 mEq  sodium  bicarbonate/Liter   to 
infuse  simultaneously or alternate bottle sequence (prefer simultaneous  infusion)  @ 300 
ml/hour   (each  liter at 150 ml/hour)   for [ADDRESS_524135] 
treatment  and monitored  for hematuria.  
 
- Anti-emesis:   All antiemetic   prophylaxis   will be done  according  to standard  institutional 
procedures. (Please see appendix for general recommendations). 
 
- Patients  will be given vitamin  K 10 mg  po or  sq one to three times  per week  unless  added  
to TPN.  
 
- Patients  will start G-CSF 5 ug/kg sq bid beginning day +1. It  will be continued   until ANC  
> 1000/mm3 X 3 days. 
 
- Blood transfusion:   All blood products  will be irradiated  to 3000 cGy  to prevent  
transfusion associated GVHD.  Platelets will be given prophylactically to maintain a 
platelet count  > 20,000/mm3 for the first [ADDRESS_524136]  in all patients  and beyond 
that period in patients  with active bleeding,  fever  or coagulopathy.  After  day 10 
prophyl actic  platelet transfusions  will be given to maintain a platelet count > 10,000/ mm3 
in the low risk, non-bleeding patient. Patients will be transfused  to maintain a hemoglobin 
> 7 g /dl. If clinically indicated,  additional transfusions  can be  given. Patients who are 
CMV  seronegative  will receive white  blood cell depleted  products  using a third generation 
white  cell filter,  or CMV  negative   blood products.  
 
- Nutritional status will be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_415849].  TPN will 
be administered   to patients  if caloric intake  is < 25%  of his/her  estimated   calorie needs  for 
3 days. 
 
- Antibiotics:  On admissi on,  patients will receive: 
 
 Ciprofloxacin [ADDRESS_524137] spectrum  antibiotics   for neutropenic   fever.  
 
 Fluconazole  100 m g po or  IV bid which will continue  until the ANC is > 
1000/mm3 X 3 days  or until amphotericin  B therapy is initiated   (except  for patients  
concurrently  enrolled on MSKCC  protocol  97-112, who will not receive 
fluconazole  prophylaxis). 
 
 Bactrim  ds po bid  until day -2 for PCP prophylaxis. 
 
 Nystatin  powder  will be applied to the groin and axilla   bid. 
 
 Patients  seropositive   for HSV will be given acyclovir   400 mg  po bid  or 250 mg  
IVPB  q 8h until  the ANC  > 1000/mm3 X [ADDRESS_524138].

 On day [ADDRESS_524139] patients will receive aerosolized  pentamidine.  On day 90 i f 
the platelet count  is > 50,000/ul  Bactrim  will  be restarted  at 1 po bid for 2 
consecutive   days/weeks  for [ADDRESS_524140].  If on day 90 the platelet count  is 
< 50,000/ ul aerosolized  pentamidine  will continue  monthly until day [ADDRESS_524141].  
 
 
10.0 EVALUATION  DURING  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION 
10.1-  During  induction   chemotherapy:  
Electrolytes  including BUN/Cr and MTX level will be drawn daily prior to and for at least 72 hours after 
each c ycle of MTX. (1 st MTX level 24 hr after infusion). 
Urine  pH will be checked  several  times  daily for at least [ADDRESS_524142] after 5 or 7 cycles of R-MPV and 90 da ys after chemotherapy.  At 
each step,  the following  tests will be performed:  
 
-Complete neurologic  examination including KPS and MMS E. 
 
-MRI  of the brain  with gadolinium   to evaluate  response  to treatment.   MR spectroscopy  will 
be done if available  (not required). CT scan will be performed in case of contra-indications  to 
MRI.  
-If CSF cytology  was positive  at initial diagnosis,  repeat CSF will be sent for cytologic  examination, 
and routine  chemistries   and cell count.  
-Patients with ocular involvement  at diagnosis  will have a complete eye exam including slit lamp 
examination. 
 
 
10.2 Evaluation  prior  to HD-chemotherapy/PBPCT   : 
 
- Pulmonary function tests, including DLCO 
 
- Dental  evaluation  prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_415824].  
 
- Echocardiogram  or MUGA scan.  
 
- CBC, electrolytes,  liver function. 
 
- Neuropsychological evaluation will be performed upon completion of R-MPV (induction 
chemotherapy)   and prior to transplant.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 04- 129 A(18)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_524143] treatment  evaluation:  
 
Patients will be examined  at least weekly until they becom e transfusion independent. 
Follow -up neurologic   status  will be assessed  monthly for the first [ADDRESS_524144] year and fourth years and then every 6 months througho ut  their lifetime.  Survival  status 
may be obtained by [CONTACT_415850], clinical visit  or medical records (e.g. physician notes/laboratory results of 
clinic   or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_62001]).  
 
. All neurologic  evaluations  will include  a MMS E and KPS.  An MRI scan will be done at the time of 
each n eurologic  evaluation beginning at [ADDRESS_524145]. 
 
Repeat  CSF and/or  ocular  exam  will be done  [ADDRESS_524146]  in those  patients  who had evidence of 
involvement   at diagnosis.  Further  exams  will only be done  for recurrent  symptoms.  
 
Neuropsychologic  evaluation will be repeated approximately 6 months after the completion of therapy 
and at 6 months intervals  thereafter. 
 
 
11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE   EFFECTS  
 
Toxicity will be graded  using the NCI Common Toxicity  Criteria,  version  3.0. 
 
11.1-  Rituximab   may cause infusion- related   symptoms,  consisting of fever  and chills  that occurs  in most 
patients during the first infusion.   Other hypersensitivity symptoms,  including nausea, urticaria,  fatigue, 
headache,  pruritus,  bronchospasm,  dyspnea, sensation of tongue  or throat  swelling,   rhinitis,   vomiting, 
hypot ension,  flushing,  and pain at disease sites, may also be seen. They occurred primarily during 
Rituxima b  infusion and resumption at a slower rate. 
Other adverse events caused by [CONTACT_415851],  thrombocytopenia  and asthenia.  Patients 
with preexisting cardiac conditions,  including arrhythmia  and angina,  have had recurrences of these 
cardiac events during Rituximab  infusions. 
Although rare, tumor  lysis syndrome  has been  reported  in post-marketing  studies  and is characterized   in 
patients with a high number of circulating malignant  cells (>25,000 u l) by [CONTACT_415852],  renal insufficiency,  hyperkalemia,  hypocalcemia ,  hyperuricemia,  and hyperphosphatemia. 
In rare cases, severe and fatal cardiopulmonary events, including hypoxia,  pulmonary infiltrates,  acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505],  myocardial infarction,  and cardiogenic  shock, have occurred (4-7/10,000 
patients  or 0.04- 0.07%)  Nearly  all fatal infusion- related   events  occurred  in association  with the first 
infusion. 
The following  immune   serious  adverse events  have been reported  to occur  rarely  (<0.1%)  in patients  
follow ing completion of Rituximab  infusions: arthritis,  disorders of blood vessels (vasculitis,  serum 
sickness and lupus-like  syndrome),  lung disorders including pleuritis  and scarring of the lung 
(bronchiolitis   obliterans),   eye disorders  (uveitis   and optic neuritis),   and severe bullous   skin reactions  
(including toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_415825])  that may result in fatal outcomes.  Patients may 
have these  symptoms   alone  or in combination  with rash and polyarthritis.  
 
11.2-  MTX can pr oduce myelosuppression,  GI toxicity,  particularly mucositis,  liver  dysfunction,  renal

failure   and rarely  interstitial pneumonitis   and gastrointestinal  epi[INVESTIGATOR_415826].  
 
 
 
11.3-  Procarbazine   can produce  myelosuppression,  nausea and vomiting.    Hypertension can occur  when  
foods  containing tyramine  are ingested due to inhibition of monoamine  oxidase, and Antabuse-like 
reactions  may occur  when  alcohol  is taken  with PCB.  Cutaneous  and pulmonary hypersensitivity 
reactions  are rare complications.  
11.4-  Vincristine  can cause a peripheral neuropathy including autonomic  dysfunction such as 
constipation.  It also causes alopeci a and can result in local necrosis after extravasation. 
11.5-  Busulfan can cause moderate nausea and vomiting,  diarrhea, dose limiting mucositis,  and severe 
myelosuppression with high dose therapy. Severe or irreversible  effects include  veno-occlusive  disease 
(VOD) of the liver,  seizures, confusion,  hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_16575], interstitial  pulmonary fibrosis 
(“busulfan  lung”),  increased  incidence  of secondary  malignancies   after prolonged administration.   Because 
of the risk of seizures,   prophylactic   anti-convulsants   are recommended.  
 
11.5-  Thiotepa  can cause bone marrow  depression, which  is dose limiting  and requires  stem cell support  
2 
at doses  >60 mg/m . Neutropenia  and thrombocytopenia   occur  within  7 to 10 days. Other  common side 
effects  include   nausea and vomiting  (usually mild),   mucositis,   esophagitis   and enterocolitis.  
Dermatological   toxicity  consisting of an acute erythrodermia   with desquamation  and peeling  of skin of 
soles and palms  is uniformly  seen.  General  darkening  of the skin may occur  (resembling  a mild  suntan)  
which  can persist  for several  months. Central  nervous  system  toxicity  characterized   by [CONTACT_415853]  
2 
behavior, forgetfulness,  confusion and somnolence  occurs in ~5% patients given 900 m g/m . 
 
11.6-  Cyclophosphamide   can cause dose dependent  myelosuppression.  Bladder  toxicity  in the form of 
hemorrhagic   cystitis,   dysuria, and increased  urinary frequency occurs  in 5-10%  of patients.  It is usually 
reversible  upon discontinuation of the drug. Uroprotection with mesna and hydration must be used with 
high-dose therapy. Nausea and vomiting usually occur within 2-4 hours after infusion.  Alopecia is severe 
and skin and nails may become hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_49194].  Amenorrhea   with ovarian  failure   may occur  and sterility  
may be permanent. Cardiac toxicity may be observed. Secondary malignancies  may develop, including 
acute leukemia   and bladder  cancer.  Immunosuppression,  SIADH and hypersensitivity reactions  may 
occur.  
 
11.6-  Filgrastin  can cause  bone pain, exacerbation  of pre-existing autoimmune   disorders, transient   and 
reversible  changes  in alkaline   phosphatase,  uric acid and LDH.  
 
11.7-  Leucovorin can cause allergic   reactions.  
 
12.0  CRITERIA  FOR  THE  THERAPEUTIC   RESPONSE/OUTCOME   ASSESSMENT  
 
Radiographic   response:  
As assessed by M RI/CT. Tumor measurements  must be recorded in centimeters  and must be measured at 
the longest diameter and its perpendicular  at the widest portion of the tumor. For tumors that are difficult 
to measure (ie. irregular  shape), a visual interpretation of the magnitude  of response is accept able.

• Complete  response  (CR) - disappearance of all enhancing  tumor.  Patients  must be off steroid  
therapy  and neurologically stable  or improved.  If CSF cytology was previously  positive,  it must be 
reassessed and negative.  If ophthalmologic  examination was previously positive, it must be reassessed 
and negative   for cells. 
 
• Partial  response  (PR) - > 50 %  decrease in tumor  size in comparison  with baseline scan.  Patients  
must be neurologically improved or stable  on a stable  or decreasing  dose of corticosteroids.  
• Progressive   disease (PD) - > 25%  increase in enhancing  tumor  or the appearance  of new lesions. 
The patient  may be neurologically stable or worse  and on stable  or increasing  doses  of steroids. 
• Stable disease (SD) - all other situations. 
 
13.1 CRITERIA FOR  REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
Patients  may be removed  from the study if any one or more  of the events  listed  below  occurs.  The reason

• Important  Medical  Events  (IME) that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,   or require  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613], based  upon medical  judgment,   they may 
jeopardize the patient  or participant   and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
• List any additional  events  that require  SAE reporting (pregnancy, AEs of special  interest  
(AESI),  secondary malignancies, etc) 
 
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_415828] a planned procedure/disease  treatment is not considered an SAE. 
 
SAE reporting is required  as soon  as the participant   starts  investigational  treatment/intervention.  
SAE reporting is required  for 30-days after the participant’s   last investigational  
treatment/intervention.   Any event  that occur  after the 30-day period that is unexpected  and at least 
possibly related  to protocol  treatment  must be reported.  
 
Please note:  Any SAE that occurs  prior to the start of investigational   treatment/intervention  and is 
related  to a screening  test or procedure  (i.e., a screening  biopsy)  must be reported.  
 
All SAEs must be submitte d  in PI[INVESTIGATOR_46427]. If an SAE requires submission to the HRPP office per IRB 
SOP RR-408 ‘Reporting of Serious  Adverse  Events’ , the SAE report  must be submitted   within  [ADDRESS_524148] be submitted   within  30 calendar  days of the 
event.  
The report should contain the follow ing information: 
• The date the adverse event  occurred  
• The adverse event  
• The grade  of the event  
• Relationship   of the adverse event  to the treatment(s)  
• If the AE was expected  
• Detailed text that includes  the follow ing 
o An explanation of how the AE was handled 
o A description of the participant’s   condition  
o Indication if the participant  remains on the study 
• If an amendment   will need to be made  to the protocol  and/or  consent  form 
• If the SAE is an Unanticipated   Problem  
 
17.3-  Risks  to human subjects  
Potential risks to human subjects  include   drug related  toxicity,   pain and discomfort   associated  with 
phlebotomy,  and possible  psychologic   discomfort   while  obtaining MRI scans.  
The side effects  and potential  toxicities  of all chemotherapeutic  agents  are listed  in  section  11. Death  
may occur  as a result  of treatment.  All efforts  will be made to avoid any complication  by [CONTACT_334974]’  symptoms   and monitoring blood tests.  
 
Periodic  phlebotomy is necessary  to monitor  for the potential  treatment  related  toxicities; trained  
phlebotomy technicians   or nurses  will perform  all phlebotomy.

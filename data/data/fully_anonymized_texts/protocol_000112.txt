19. Tumour assessment: CT or MRI imaging of the chest, abdomen a nd pelvis at screening and prior to the start C3D1 onwards (see below ) according to modified RECIST criteria (version 1.1)
see appendix 10.4 . If clinically indicated, imaging of any other known or suspected sites of disease using an appropriate method (CT scan and MRI) should be performed. After study entry, 
all lesions identified during the screening should be followed up at all specified imaging time points. The same radiographic p rocedure must be used throughout the study. See section 5.1.2. 1
A bone scan should be performed at screening and prior to the start C3D1 and onwards according to schedule below. 
Tumour assessment and bone scan will be performed at the following time points until progression/start of further anti-cancer the rapy (assessments may be performed up to 7 days prior to 
the scheduled assessment date):
∀ At screening: all patients will have a  CT or MRI and bone scan at screening, unless valid results are available from a scan pe rformed within 28 days prior to start of study 
treatment, as part of routine clinical practice
∀ Week 8 (49-56 days after start of study treatment)
∀ Week 16 (105-112 days after start of study treatment)
∀ Week 24 (161-168 days after start of study treatment)
∀ Every 12 weeks thereafter (i.e., during week 35-36 (245-252 days after start of study treatment), during week 47-48 (329-336 days a fter start of study treatment), etc…)
In the event of an interruption/delay to treatment the tumour assessment schedule should not be changed.  
20. All patients should have a tumour assessment/bone scan at EOT visit regardless of the reason for discontinuation, unless the  last evaluation was performed within [ADDRESS_1188865] to be completed for 7 days in screening period prior to C1 Day-1 (Day-7 to Day-2), 
and for 7 days prior to C2 Day 1 (C1 Day 23 to Day 28).
25. For expansion cohort only at these visits: Review of diary card and compliance check of enzalutamide taken during screening period prior to C1 Day -1 and prior to C2D1

* From cycle 4 onwards patients on enzalutamide (Arm B) and those patients that have discontinued BI 836845, but remain on enzal utamide (Arm A), will only be required to visit on day 
1 of each cycle.
1. Treatment cycles: each treatment cycle consists of 28 days 2. EOT: end of treatment visit; within 7 calendar days after permanent termination of trial drug(s). If permanent discontinuatio n of study drug falls on a scheduled visit, examinations as 
defined for EOT should be performed instead of the examinations of the scheduled visit
3. FU: Follow-up visit; 42 days (+7) after per manent discontinuation of trial medication.  
Additional FU: Patients who have not progressed and not started further anti-cancer therapy at first FU should have additional f ollow-up visits at scheduled tumour assessments until 
progression /start of further anti-cancer therapy. Only tumour assessments, AEs and concomitant medication to be reviewed, no oth er assessments required.
4. OP: Observational phase; every 90 days ( ∃15) after last FU, patients will be followed for survival every three months until patient death. Survival information can be o btained via phone 
contact
5. Written informed consent must be obtained before any trial specific screening assessments are performed
8. Physical exam: includes a thorough cardiopulmonary, abdominal and lymph node exam and an assessment of the mental and neurolo gical status. 
9. Vital signs: includes respi[INVESTIGATOR_853958] (after two minutes supi[INVESTIGATOR_198620]), pulse, temperature, and blood pressure . On dosing days, at any time before drug administration.
10. 12-lead ECG: 12-Lead resting digital electrocardiogram (ECG) are recorded digitally and in triplicate. ECGs will be performed  at: Screening, Cycle 1 on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15; 
Cycle 2 on Day 8 and Day 15; Cycle 3 on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15. Day 1 of Cycles 6, 9, 12 and every 12 weeks thereafter; also E OT and first FUP. See Appendix 10.6 for schedule.
ECGs to be taken: Pre-dose (-20 min. to -5 min. before administration of BI 836845 and/or enzalutamide) and immediately after th e end of infusion of BI 836845 (up to 15 minutes after
end of infusion), or one hour after the administration of enzalutamide. ECGs to be taken prior to PK sample time-points where app licable.
12. Safety labs: haematology, coagulation, biochemistry, electrolytes, urinalysis by [CONTACT_853988]. See section 5.2.5 for details.
13. Fasting glucose and HbA1C only at screening and Day 1 of each cycle and EOT.

20. Tumour assessment: CT or MRI imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis at screening and prior to start C3D1 onwards (see below) acc ording to modified RECIST criteria (version 1.1). 
If clinically indicated, imaging of any other known or suspected sites of disease using an appropriate method (CT scan or MRI) should be performed. After study entry, all lesions 
identified during the screening should be followed up at all specified imaging time points. The same radiographic procedure mus t be used throughout the study. See section 5.1.2. 1
A bone scan should be performed at screening, prior to the start C3D1and onwards according to schedule below. 
Tumour assessment and bone scans will be performed at the follo wing time points until progression/start of further anti-cancer th erapy (assessments may be performed up to 7 days prior 
to the scheduled assessment date):
∀At screening: all patients will have a  CT or MRI and bone scan at screening, unless valid results are available from a scan pe rformed within 28 days prior to start of study 
treatment, as part of routine clinical practice
∀ Week 8 (49-56 days after randomisation)
∀ Week 16 (105-112 days after randomisation)
∀ Week 24 (161-168 days after randomisation)
∀ Every 12 weeks thereafter (i.e., during week 35-36 (245-252 days after randomisation), during week 47-48 (329-336 days after randomis ation), etc…)
In the event of an interruption/delay to treatment the tumour assessment schedule should not be changed.
21. All patients should have a tumour assessment/bone scan at EOT visit regardless of the reason for discontinuation, unless the la st evaluation was performed within 4 weeks of EOT .
22. Optional physical examination.
23. If not recovered at EOT, or new AE, or drug related death.
24. Dispensing of enzalutamide at every weekly visit. However for patients in Arm B and those patients in Arm A which discontinue  BI 836845 permanently, from cycle 4 onwards,
enzalutamide will be dispensed only on Day 1 of each cycle, e.g. C4D1, C5D1 onwards.
25. For more details on patient completion, see section [IP_ADDRESS]
 
27. The randomization may take place up to [ADDRESS_1188866] include a copy of site policy/written justification in the ISF and submit a copy to the sponsor.  If randomization is performed prior to C1D1, the subsequent 
visits must be scheduled with reference to C1D1.

cancer-related deaths among men in developed countries ( R11-0764 ). Androgen-deprivation 
therapy is, and has been, the gold standard of care for advanced or metastatic prostate cancer 
for decades. Although more than 90% of prostate cancer patients initially respond to androgen deprivation therapy, most tumours b ecome refractory and eventually reoccur as 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), for which there are limited treatment options with only modest survival benefit.
A significant amount of data has been accumulated suggesting that the insulin-like growth 
factor (IGF) system plays an important role in prostate cancer initiation and progression.  The IGF axis is composed of 2 peptide growth factors (IGF-1 and -2), 2 transmembrane receptors (IGF-1R and -2R), 6 IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP-1 to -6), and IGFBP proteases. IGFs are synthesized primarily in the liver and have effects on protein and carbohydrate metabolism but also regulate cellular processes of proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis and apoptosis ( R13-0728 ). These later attributes have resulted in the IGF axis being associated 
with a critical role in the development of a variety of malignancies including prostate cancer 
(R10-6695 , R13-0992 , R13-0723 , R13-0724 , R13-0729 ). IGF-1R is a transmembrane 
receptor tyrosine kinase that is widely expressed in human tissues. Binding of IGF ligands 
induces conformational changes of IGF-IR and activation of its intrinsic intracellular tyrosine kinase activity. The activated receptor induces recruitment of the insulin receptor substrates (IRS) 1 and 2, which in turn activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt intracellular signaling pathways, leading to cellular proliferation and apoptosis inhibition ( R13-0725 , R13-0726 ). 
Elevated levels of serum IGF-[ADDRESS_1188873] been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer 
in meta-regression analysis ( R07-4212 , R13-0727 ) (R13-0730 ), and high plasma IGF-1 and 
low IGFBP-3 has been associated with more advanced stages of prostate cancer ( R13-0731 , 
R13-0732 ). In human primary prostate cancers, IGF-1R, IGF-1, and -[ADDRESS_1188874] increased expression compared with normal prostate tissue ( R13-0982 , R13-0993 , 
R13-0994 ) and is also increased in advanced and metastatic disease ( R13-0659 , R13-0018 ). 
IGF-1 and IGF-1R are increased with progression to castration-resistance in vivo (R13-0660 ). 
In the TRAMP model (transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate), prostate cancer 
incidence is substantially reduced in IGF-1–deficient mice, whereas organ-specific overexpression of IGF-1R increased prostate neoplasia ( R13-0705 ). In other preclinical 
studies, the IGF axis appears to be up-regulated in bone metastases ( R13-0704 ) and IGF-1 
has been shown to accelerate tumour growth ( R13-0703 ), promote migration through 
PI3K/AKT ( R13-0995 ), and be involved with angiogenesis through VEGF ( R13-0707 ).
Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor that targets multiple steps in the androgen 
receptor signalling pathway in the tumour cell; namely inhibition of nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor, DNA binding, and co-activator recruitment and has no known agonistic effect.

Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status score and pain intensity. Patients were 
randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive oral enzalutamide at a dose of 160 mg per day (800 patients) or placebo (399 patients). The primary end point was overall survival.
The median overall survival was 18.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.3 to not yet 
reached) in the enzalutamide group versus 13.6 months (95% CI, 11.3 to 15.8) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death in the enzalutamide group, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.75; P<0.001). The superiority of enzalutamide over placebo was shown with respect to all secondary end points: the proportion of patients with a reduction in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level by 50% or more (54% vs. 2%, P<0.001), the soft-tissue response rate (29% vs. 4%, P<0.001), the quality-of-life response rate (43% vs. 18%, P<0.001), the time to PSA progression (8.3 vs. 3.0 months; hazard ratio, 0.25; P<0.001), radiographic progression-free survival (8.3 vs. 2.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.40; P<0.001), and the time to the first skeletal-related event (16.7 vs. 13.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.69; P<0.001). Hence enzalutamide significantly prolonged the survival of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after chemotherapy ( R13-1229 ).
These data were more recently confirmed in the PREVAIL trial ( R15-1307 ) investigating 
Enzalutamide in metastatic prostate cancer before chemotherapy: Enzalutamide significantly 
decreased the risk of radiographic progression and death and delayed the initiation of chemotherapy. 
The present trial shall investigate the safety and efficacy of enzalutamide taken in 
combination with BI 836845, an IGF ligand blocking agent directed towards IGF-[ADDRESS_1188875] on the IGF-1R phosphorylation potential (IGF bioactivity) of human plasma ex vivo . Due to its cross-reactivity to rat and Cynomolgus 
monkey IGF-[ADDRESS_1188876] of BI 836845 on IGF bioactivity in both these species was demonstrated by a clear and potent reduction in plasma IGF bioactivity for all doses tested.
Repeat-dose toxicity studies with once weekly intravenous administration of BI 836845 for 
13 weeks in Cynomolgus monkeys and for 13 or 26 weeks in rats revealed a variety of dose related and essentially reversible effects. The treatment related changes included the body as a whole (growth retardation) in both species and liver functions, the haematolymphatic system, kidneys, bone, teeth, and ovaries in rats only. Most, if not all, observed effects were attributable to the pharmacodynamic potential of BI 836845, i.e. reflecting the neutralization of specific growth factors in these species during a phase of rapid body growth.

Proprietary confidential information. ![ADDRESS_1188877] recent update of the investigator brochure (IB, c01690707 ).
Two Phase I studies with BI 836845 monotherapy are ongoing in patients with advanced 
solid tumours to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose and/ or relevant biological dose, pharmacokinetics (PK) and PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) correlation, applying either a weekly dosing schedule in study 1280.1 ( U11-3025 ) or a once every three weeks dosing 
schedule in study 1280.2 ( U10-2994 ) during escalation phase; study 1280.2 has since 
changed to a weekly dosing phase in the expansion phase.
As of the database cut-off date of the IB (U10-2830) of [ADDRESS_1188878] 
received BI 836845 across the two phase I trials (U11-3025 and U10-2994). Overall in these studies, BI 836845 was well-tolerated. The type and pattern of adverse events (AEs) observed to date have generally been mild to moderate (CTCAE Grade 1 and 2) and consistent with the underlying neoplastic conditions of patients enrolled in the trials. The most frequently reported AEs reported across both studies (any cause) were general disorders, especially fatigue, as well as gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea). Specifically, there were no laboratory findings that would indicate kidney damage in patients, as previously observed in the 13-week study in rats ( U10-2830 ).
Of the 81 subjects treated until the cut-off date, only one experienced a drug-related serious 
adverse event (SAE). One further patient experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).
Four subjects discontinued treatment due to non-drug related AEs. Infusion-related reactions 
were not observed. Metabolic AEs involving perturbed glucose homeostasis, among the most common toxicities documented for IGF-1R-targeting monoclonal antibodies and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, were observed at relatively low frequencies. Two out of 81 subjects reported transient hyperglycemia: one patient (CTCAE Grade 2) in study 1280.1 and one patient (CTCAE Grade 3) in 1280.2, see the most recent edition of the IB for full details ( U10-2830 ).
Preliminary tumour response data is available for the subjects treated in both the first in-man 
studies; however the results are insufficient to reliably assess the anti-tumour activity of BI 836845 as monotherapy. There were 12 (25.0%) patients with confirmed stable disease in study 1280.1 and four patients (12.1%) with confirmed stable disease in study 1280.2. Two patients had confirmed partial responses in study 1280.1: a patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and a patient with peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour, a member of the Ewing’s family of tumours.
Preliminary PK interim data from the dose escalation part of both trials indicate that 
maximum plasma concentrations of BI [ADDRESS_1188879] biphasic decay with a terminal half-life of about 6 days. The estimated volume of distribution was about 5.8 L (approx. two times the plasma volume) and the total plasma clearance was about 0.5 mL/min. The incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) was approximately 19% in 1280.1 and 30% in 1280.2. Overall, the ADA-response was weak, dose-independent and in many cases transient and had no impact on PK or PD.

range analysed (10-1050 mg q1w in 1280.1 and 10-3600 mg q3w in 1280.2). Steady state plasma concentrations of BI [ADDRESS_1188881] not been related to modulation of CYP450 isozymes or drug transporters ( P13-[ZIP_CODE] ). Hence, the potential of BI [ADDRESS_1188882]. The chemical name [CONTACT_832] 4-{3-[4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5,5-dimethyl-4-oxo -2-sulfanylideneimidazolidin-1-yl}-2-fluoro- N-
methylbenzamide. The molecular weight is 464.44 and molecular formula is C21H16F4N4O2S. Enzalutamide is a white crystalline non-hygroscopic solid. It is practically insoluble in water.
Enzalutamide has been shown to competitively inhibit androgen binding to androgen
receptors and inhibit androgen receptor nuclear translocation and interaction with DNA. A major metabolite, N-desmethyl enzalutamide, exhibited similar in vitro activity to 
enzalutamide. Enzalutamide decreased proliferation and induced cell death of prostate cancercells in vitro , and decreased tumour volume in a mouse prostate cancer xenograft model.
Following oral administration (160 mg daily) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer, the median time to reach maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) is 1 hour (range 0.5 to 3 hours). At steady state, the plasma mean Cmax values for enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide are 16.6 μg/mL (23% CV) and 12.7 μg/mL (30% CV), 
respectively, and the plasma mean predose trough values are 11.4 μg/mL (26% CV) and 13.0 
μg/mL (30% CV), respectively.  With daily dosi ng enzalutamide steady state is achieved by 
[CONTACT_2006] 28, and enzalutamide accumulates approximately 8.3-fold relative to a single dose. Daily fluctuations in enzalutamide plasma concentrations are low (mean peak-to-trough ratio of 1.25). At steady state, enzalutamide showed approximately dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the daily dose range of [ADDRESS_1188883]-order absorption.
In vitro, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 are responsible for the metabolism of enzalutamide. Based 
on in vivo and in vitro data, CYP2C8 is primarily responsible for the formation of the active 
metabolite (N-desmethyl enzalutamide). Enzalutamide is primarily eliminated by [CONTACT_171339]. The mean terminal half-life (t1/2) for enzalutamide in patients after a single oral dose is 5.8 days (range 2.8 to 10.2 days) ( R13-5391 ).  Please also refer to the current 
summary of product characteristics (SPC) from eMC website.

Proprietary confidential information. ![ADDRESS_1188885] progression involve the androgen-receptor (AR) pathway, including AR activation via crosstalk of signal transduction pathways such as the IGF axis.
An increasing body of evidence has linked activation of the IGF axis with castrate-resistant 
progression of prostate cancer including via ligand-independent activation of the androgen receptor ( R13-0706 ) and increases in IGF-1 ( R13-0660 ), IGF-1R ( R13-0018 ), IGFBP-2 
(R13-0756 ), and IGFBP-5 ( R13-0757 ). Preclinical studies have supported this approach using 
a variety of IGF pathway inhibitors ( R10-5690 , R13-0758 , R13-0759 ). In both castrate-
sensitive and –resistant prostate cancer models, activity has been observed with the IGF-1R–
specific monoclonal antibody cixutumumab (formerly IMC-A12), which induced tumour cell apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and down regulation of ligand-independent, androgen-regulated gene expression ( R13-0016 , R13-0658 , R13-0657 ).A recently completed phase 2 clinical trial 
with figitumumab (formerly CP-751,871), an IgG2 IGF-1R antibody inhibitor that blocks 
IGF-1 binding and promotes receptor internalization, in patients with localized prostate cancer showed a decrease in serum levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) ( R13-0656 ). 
Enzalutamide is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (CRPC) who have received prior chemotherapy containing docetaxel.
A recent non-clinical study (unpublished in -house study) of enzalutamide (MDV-3100), plus 
BI 836845, was conducted to test the anti-proliferation effects in vitro by 2D cell 
proliferation assay of the combination, when compared to single agent activity. Three of the prostate cell lines tested showed single agent responses with enzalutamide and BI 836845 and resulted in limited inhibition of cell proliferation; however the combination effect in the same cell lines was complete inhibition of cell proliferation. Overall, the results indicate that the presence of androgen receptor and IGF-1R, in addition to the expression of PTEN and wild-type PIK3CA, characterises prostate cancer cells that showed complete inhibition of cell proliferation in the presence of the combination of enzalutamide and BI 836845 in vitro .
The progression to CRPC correlates with gain-of-function of the AR and activation of AKT. 
However, as single agents, AR or AKT inhibitors result in a reciprocal feedback loop ( R14-
0873 ). The existence of bidirectional cross-talk between the IGF-1R/PI3K/AKT pathway and 
the AR axis has been proposed ( R14-0873 ) and there is ample evidence for the interaction of 
IGF signaling and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression ( R14-0855 ; R14-
0854 ). Specifically, IGF-1R signaling to activate PI3K/AKT pathway has been proposed to 
be one of the mechanisms to transactivate the AR in the absence of androgen and progression 
to androgen-independent diseases ( R14-0855 ; R14-0851 ; R14-0852 ). For instance, Schayek 
et al. showed that re-expression of wild-type AR in an AR-negative metastatic prostate cancer 
cell line M12 led to significant increase in IGF-1R expression. However, when they

Proprietary confidential information. ![ADDRESS_1188886]. To further support this conclusion, they further showed that AR can directly bind to IGF-1R promoter region. These data, along with recent evidence indicating that the combination of an AKT inhibitor with an antiandrogen, results in prolonged disease stabilization in a model of CRPC, provide further evidence for the strategy of targeting the AR and the IGF-1R/PI3K/AKT signaling axis ( R14-
0873 ;P14-[ZIP_CODE] ). Taken collectively, these studies suggest that co-targeting the IGF and AR 
pathways with BI [ADDRESS_1188887] received and failed prior cabazitaxel treatment, in any setting.
An expansion cohort, during the phase Ib study, will also be pursued at the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD), and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D), in patients that are already undergoing treatment with enzalutamide and showing a measured rise in PSA whist on enzalutamide according to standard criteria ( R13-1642 ). Patients may not have received 
prior taxane therapy or abiraterone
Overall, this trial is intended to prove the clinical proof of concept for the proposed 
combination of enzalutamide and BI 836845. The data of this randomised II trial will be used as the basis for the clinical assumptions for the phase III pi[INVESTIGATOR_853960].
2.2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES
The primary objectives of the trial are to:
∀Determine the safety and tolerability profile of BI 836845 in combination with 
enzalutamide following progression on docetaxel-based chemotherapy and abiraterone (phase Ib escalation).
∀Evaluate the anti-tumour activity of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide in 
patients naïve to taxane-based chemotherapy and abiraterone (phase Ib expansion cohort).
∀Evaluate the anti-tumour activity between the two treatment arms of BI 836845 in 
combination with enzalutamide versus enzalutamide alone following progression on 
docetaxel-based chemotherapy and abiraterone (phase II)

 the incidence and intensity of adverse events according to 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 dated 14 June 2010 (R10-4848 ); ECG evaluation correlated with PK assessment.  
All patients in the trial have sufficient data to adequately answer the primary and secondary 
objectives of the trial. After approval of protocol version 10, the data collected in the clinical trial database will be limited to data required to ensure the safety of the patient, and to support safety reporting to authorities. Patient visits and assessments will continue per the revised Flow 
Chart . At the end of the clinical trial, the new reduced data collected will be locked and the 
data will be summarised in a CTR revision.
2.3 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT
Monotherapy studies performed to date with BI 836845 in patients with various malignant 
tumours has shown the drug to be well tolerated, with only mild to moderate drug related adverse events reported of CTCAE Grade 1 and 2 ( U10-2830 ). Published data from IGF-1R 
antagonist therapi[INVESTIGATOR_853961] ( P12-[ZIP_CODE] ). Thus, although 
BI [ADDRESS_1188888] profile, parametchfor glucose metabolism, other metabolic parameters, renal function, other adverse events, including full ECG analysis of the QT interval, will be carefully supervised and evaluated in the present trial.
BI 836845 is a humanised antibody given intravenously. Infusion reactions and immune 
responses cannot be excluded; and have been reported. Any infusion reactions that occur will be carefully evaluated and appropriate preventive and/or corrective action implemented. Immune response monitoring and analysis will be assessed continually throughout treatmentand into the follow-up period.
The collection of tumour biopsy in this trial will only be performed if there is a low risk of 
complication and as little discomfort to the patient as possible. Risks and complications associated with biopsy are usually small; however they can cause pain or bruising at the biopsy site, bleeding, infection, and reaction to local anaesthetic. Very rarely the bleeding may be significant and require surgery.  As a consequence, so as to minimise potential risks associated with the tumour biopsy, restrictions have been stipulated in this study: patients must have controlled haematology parameters and platelet counts, and the use of concomitant anti-platelet and anti-coagulation therapy prior to biopsy has been restricted. Patients with a

Proprietary confidential information. ![ADDRESS_1188889] common adverse reactions with enzalutamide ( ≥ 5%) are asthenia/fatigue, back pain, diarrhoea, 
arthralgia, hot flush, peripheral edema, musculoskeletal pain, headache, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], muscular weakness, dizziness, insomnia, lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], spi[INVESTIGATOR_611356], haematuria, paresthesia, anxiety, and hypertension. 
All adverse reaction will be carefully monitored throughout the course of the trial. The 
addition of BI [ADDRESS_1188890] enzalutamide therapy is not expected to substantially worsen or contribute to the toxicity profile of enzalutamide; however, the tolerability and safety phase of the study will confirm the safety of the combination and determine a recommended dose before proceeding to the randomised trial. Renal and hepatic function as well as other safety parameters will be carefully examined before each new treatment course.
Although rare, a potential for drug-induced liver injury is under constant surveillance by 
[CONTACT_23274]. Therefore, this study requires timely detection, evaluation, and follow-up of laboratory alterations of selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure patients´ safety.
The phase Ib escalation and expansion parts of the study will be continuously supervised and 
monitored by [CONTACT_853989] (steering committee), as described in section 3.1.1 . An internal Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) data monitoring committee (DMC) will 
be nominated and be responsible for the continuous supervision of the safety of the patients 
included in the phase II randomised trial. 
Patients are expected to benefit from the established and registered enzalutamide treatment. 
The addition of BI 836845 to enzalutamide is hoped to provide additional benefit to patientsthat include: improved disease control, increased survival and quality of life over the standard therapy alone.
Based on the pharmacological mechanism and existing non-clinical and clinical data, there is 
currently no reason to believe that xentuzumab, either as monotherapy or in combination with enzalutamide therapy, will increase the occurrence or worsen the outcomes of a COVID-19 infection. In the target population of patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and progression on docetaxel-based chemotherapy and abiraterone, the benefit-risk assessment for xentuzumab remains positive also in the presence of a COVID-19 outbreak. 
The decision on whether to continue study drugs if a patient develops COVID-19 will be left 
to the investigator’s benefit/risk assessment on a case-by-case basis. Based on laboratory data and any adverse event that may occur, the clinical trial protocol includes guidance for continuation, interruption, dose reduction, and discontinuation of study drugs.

In consideration of these top line results of 1280-0022, as of 19 October 2021, Boehringer 
Ingelheim recommended to immediately discontinue all xentuzumab treatments. Sites were also recommended to discontinue associated assessments, including central laboratory sampling. Boehringer Ingelheim also terminated all oncology development of xentuzumab.
Relative to benefit-risk for any patient continuing on enzalutamide treatment:  The recent 
SmPC label for enzalutamide identified two new risks/warnings:
1. Second primary malignancies:  Cases of second primary malignancies have been 
reported in patients treated with enzalutamide in clinical studies. In phase [ADDRESS_1188892] frequently reported events in enzalutamide treated patients, and greater than placebo, were bladder cancer (0.3%), adenocarcinoma of the colon (0.2%), transitional cell carcinoma (0.2%) and bladder transitional cell carcinoma (0.1%).  Patients should be advised to promptly seek the attention of their physician if they notice signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, macroscopic haematuria, or other symptoms such as dysuria or urinary urgency develop during treatment with enzalutamide.
2. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions(SCARs):  Hypersensitivity reactions manifested 
by [CONTACT_129572], but not limited to, rash, or face, tongue, lip, or pharyngeal oedema, have been observed with enzalutamide. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) have been reported with enzalutamide. At the time of prescription patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for skin reactions.
However, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_853962] (low risk of secondary 
malignancies and of severe cutaneous adverse reactions) of enzalutamide noted above, given the proven survival benefit of enzalutamide in CRPC patients in the Affirm study (noted above in section 1.1 ), the continued use of enzalutamide in patients having apparent benefit 
remains positive in terms of benefit-risk.  However, investigators should use their discretion 
in weighing all benefits and risks in deciding to continue patients on enzalutamide.

3. DESCRIPTION OF DESIGN AND TRIAL POPULATION
3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
This phase Ib, and phase II randomised open label trial, will be conducted to explore the anti-
tumour activity and safety profile of the combination treatment of BI 836845 andenzalutamide (Arm A), compared to enzalutamide alone (Arm B) in patients with CRPC.  A tolerability and safety phase Ib will initially be performed to determine the MTD, and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide for the phase Ib expansion cohort and phase II randomised trial, see figure 3.1:1. In addition, anysafety issues will also be assessed before commencement of the expansion cohort andrandomised trial.
BI 836845 will be administered weekly in 28 day cycles of treatment, as per the Flow Chart , 
by a one hour intravenous infusion. Enzalutamide will be administered daily by [CONTACT_853990].

Phase Ib – Tolerability and safety / expansion cohort:
A 3+3 design tolerability and safety phase (escalation) will initially be performed with a 
single escalation step in order to determine the MTD, and/or recommended phase II doses,and the safety profile of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide. Approximately 9-12patients may be assessed to determine the MTD and/or the recommended phase II dose(RP2D). Patients in phase Ib escalation will not be randomised into phase II and will not be included in the final efficacy (anti-tumour activity) analysis of the study; however these patients will continue treatment until disease progression, undue toxicities, or discontinuation for any other reason, see section 3.3.4 for details. 
An exploratory expansion cohort will be pursued in approximately 25 enrolled patients to 
ensure 21 evaluable patients at the MTD, and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D)determined in the escalation part of phase Ib described above. A patient is considered evaluable if data for the assessment of the primary endpoint is available. Patients recruited to this cohort will be on ongoing enzalutamide therapy and be beginning to show a rise in PSA(as described in section 3.3.2 inclusion #19) on this treatment at the time of consent for the
expansion cohort of the study. These patients will continue to receive enzalutamide from the 
first day of treatment on the study combined with BI 836845. Patients in this expansion cohort will continue treatment until disease progression, undue toxicities, or discontinuation for any other reason, see section 3.3.4 for details. 
Phase II – Randomised phase II:
In phase II, 80 patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with either BI 
836845 plus enzalutamide (Arm A) at the MTD, and/or the recommended phase II dose(RP2D) determined in phase Ib escalation, or enzalutamide alone (Arm B), in an open label, parallel group study design. Patients will continue treatment until disease progression, undue toxicities, or discontinuation for any other reason, see section 3.3.4 for details. 
After discontinuation of all trial drugs and completion of the final follow up visit, see section 
6.1.3 , patients will be followed up further (every [ADDRESS_1188895] follow up visit) for 
survival status in an observation period (until approval of protocol version 10 after which no 
further survival status will be collected).

Phase I and Phase II:
Patients will be enrolled onto the study at the time of signing the informed consent and will 
conclude participation in the treatment phase of the study once the end of treatment (EOT) and last follow-up visit has been performed. If withdrawal from the study falls on a scheduled visit then that visit will be considered the EOT and all EOT assessments will be performed. For the collection of adverse events, these will be collected from the signing of the informed consent (pre-treatment). Patients will still be considered as “on-treatment” from first study drug administration until [ADDRESS_1188896] study drug infusion of BI 836845 and/or the last dose of enzalutamide (i.e. at the planned time of the first follow-up visit), whichever is the last drug to be taken by [CONTACT_102].
Prior to approval of protocol version 10, patients that withdraw from treatment and do not 
have progressive disease, or have not started another anti-cancer therapy, will continue with limited follow-up visits at scheduled tumour assessments, until start of progressive disease, or start of other anti-cancer therapy. Patients, after protocol version [ADDRESS_1188897] study drug infusion of BI 836845 and/or the last dose of enzalutamide.
Soft tissue tumour assessment by [CONTACT_853991] (RECIST) version 1.1 ( R09-0262 and appendix 10.4 ), as well as 
bone scans according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) ( R13-
1642 and section [IP_ADDRESS] ), at baseline, every two cycles until week 24 and then every three 
cycles thereafter as per the Flow Chart .  Assessment of response will be performed at the 
investigator site and will be sufficient for the decision to allow a patient to continue on 
treatment in the study. Patients should be kept on trial until radiographic, and/or bone scan progression and/or symptomatic progression, which may include PSA progression. Patients should not be discontinued due to rising PSA alone. During phase II an independent analysis of response will also be performed by a central imaging unit CRO (see section 5.1.3 ); 
however this CRO will not be used to make treatment decisions.
PSA collection  
CTC collection will be performed throughout phase Ib and phase II as per the time-points 
specified in the relevant Flow Chart and Appendix 10.6 .
The study will be performed by [CONTACT_853992], especially CRPC, and experienced in phase I/II oncology trials. The sites will have available all equipment necessary for dealing with any serious side-effects and potential emergencies.

3.1.1 Administrative structure of the trial
The trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_23347] (BI). BI will appoint a Trial Clinical Monitor, 
responsible for coordinating the activities required in order to manage the trial in accordance with applicable regulations and internal standard operating procedures (SOPs), directing the clinical trial team in the preparation, conduct, and reporting of the trial, order the materials as needed for the trial, ensures appropriate training and information of local clinical monitors (CMLs), clinical research associates (CRAs), and investigators of participating countries.
Data management and statistical evaluation will be performed by [CONTACT_15640]. 
For these activities, a Trial Data Manager and a Trial Statistician will be appointed. Tasks and functions assigned in order to organise, manage, and evaluate the trial will be defined according to BI SOPs. Special tasks may be contracted to a CRO. A list of responsible persons will be given in the Clinical Trial Master File (CTMF) document. In each local BI-organisation (OPU) participating in this study, a local clinical monitor (CML) will be appointed responsible for coordinating the activities required in order to manage the trial in accordance with applicable regulations and internal SOPs in the countries covered by [CONTACT_853993]. On-site monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_688669] a CRO appointed by [CONTACT_23347].
A Co-ordinating Investigator will be nominated to coordinate investigators at different sites 
participating in this multicentre trial and to sign the clinical trial report. Documents on participating (Principal) investigators and other important participants, especially their curricula vitae, will be filed in the Clinical Trial Master File (CTMF).
Evaluation of the imaging findings and response assessment will be performed at the 
investigational site. Independent review will be performed by a central imaging unit CRO in the phase II randomised trial.
The trial drugs (where required) will be provided by [CONTACT_23292] a CRO appointed by [CONTACT_35978]. The trial 
drugs will be stored according to the required storage conditions.
During phase Ib dose escalation phase of the study, regular teleconference will be held 
between the investigators and BI study team for review of safety data, decisions over doseescalation, discussions of on-going patients, and discussion of operational aspects. Relevant safety, laboratory, and efficacy data should be reviewed by [INVESTIGATOR_2394]-site monitoring and, if possible, recorded in the eCRF before the teleconference. During the regular teleconferences with the investigators and BI study team, the next higher dose level will be determined from the progress of existing patients at the current dose level and in consideration of available safety, toxicity and PK-PD data. Any potential patients for the trial will also be discussed. The decision to conclude dose escalation should be agreed by [CONTACT_853994]. The decision to commence the expansion cohort and phase II will be discussed between the investigators and BI study team. All teleconference details will be documented accordingly and reviewed by [CONTACT_229583]. Approval of the entry of a new patient into any cohort will be confirmed, and documented, in a fax or e-mail between the CML and the investigator/site.

The DMC’s responsibility will be the continuous assessment of the trial data to ensure overall safety in the patients treated, monitor the quality and provide the trial team with advice about the conduct of the trial and the integrity of the data in the phase II randomised trial. Details of the DMC responsibilities and frequency of data review will be described in the DMC charter.
All trial relevant documentation will be stored in BI’s CTMF document according to BI 
SOPs. Trial relevant documentation which has to be at the trial site will be filed in the investigator site file (ISF) at the investigator site. The ISF document will be kept in print-out version at the sites as required by [CONTACT_847110]. 
3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
BI 836845 is currently being investigated as monotherapy in two phase I trials ( U11-3025 , 
U10-2994 ) in various malignant tumour indications. A relevant biological dose (RBD) of 
BI 836845 has been determined as the recommended dose for monotherapy and will be the 
basis for determining the dose that can be used safely in combination with other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Given the good tolerability and safety profile of BI 836845 it is expected that the addition of enzalutamide at the labelled dose might be combined safely. 
Thus, the phase Ib dose confirmation part of this trial aims to determine the MTD, and/or 
recommended phase II dose, of BI 836845 to be used in combination with enzalutamide for the treatment of metastatic CRPC is deemed a sufficient safety analysis before commencement to the expansion cohort and phase II randomised trial. This design allows for a simple transition from the safety and tolerability dose-finding phase Ib, to the randomised phase II proof of concept trial, thereby [CONTACT_853995] 836845 in CRPC.
The initial tolerability and safety phase Ib of the trial (escalation) will be performed to 
determine the MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and any safety issues of combining enzalutamide and BI 836845 before commencement of the randomised trial and the exploratory expansion cohort. The traditional 3+3 design remains the prevailing method for conducting phase I cancer clinical trials. The main advantages of the 3+3 design are that it is simple to implement and considered safe for patients. In addition, the accrual of three patients per dose level will provide additional information regarding the pharmacokinetic inter-patient variability. The 3+3 rule-based design will allow for the assignment of patients to chosen dose levels according to specified rules, or DLTs, based on actual observations of target events noted from the clinical data. The MTD will be determined using the DLT criteria specified in this protocol, see section 5.2.3 .

abiraterone treatment for inclusion into this part of the study. The results of the expansion 
cohort will not affect the continuation of the randomised phase II trial. Further data concerning safety, QT assessment and drug-drug interactions will also be collected throughout this cohort.
The phase II trial will be performed according to an open-label, randomised design. Blinding 
is not considered ethical, or necessary. The determination of radiological disease progression will be assessed by [CONTACT_853996] 1.1 (R09-0262 ), and Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group Criteria (PCWG2) ( R13-
1642 ) as per Appendix 10.4 and Section [IP_ADDRESS] , to assess whether a patient should remain on 
trial. However, an independent central imaging unit will be used to analyse and confirm 
progression free survival endpoint in the phase II trial in a blinded manner. Internal review by [CONTACT_853997].
All patients will receive the standard enzalutamide regimen that is registered and 
recommended by [CONTACT_853998], expansion cohort, and the phase II randomised trial, regardless of the treatment arm to which they are randomised.
The main objective of the trial is to test and support the hypothesis that BI 836845 will 
improve clinical outcome when combined with enzalutamide in patients with advanced and/or metastatic CRPC. 
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
A total of up to approximately 120 patients may be recruited into the study.  Approximately 
9-12 patients will be entered into the phase Ib tolerability and safety phase of the study (escalation part) to ensure the safety of the combination therapy and determine the MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D). For the exploratory expansion cohortapproximately 25 patients will be treated with BI 836845 at the MTD, and/or recommendedphase II dose (RP2D) in combination with enzalutamide.
In phase II of the study, 80 patients will be randomised onto one of the two study arms, with 
40 patients randomised to each arm (Arm A=40, Arm B=40).  
The Phase Ib escalation part of the study will be performed in 4 or more centres. The Phase 
Ib expansion part of the study will be performed in 8 or more centres. The Phase II of the study will be performed in 25-30 centres globally.
A log of all patients included into the study (i.e. having given informed consent) will be 
maintained in the ISF at the investigational site irrespective of whether they have been treated with investigational drug or not.

4. The patient is receiving forbidden concomitant therapy affecting the safety of the patient 
according to the judgment of the investigator (refer to section 4.2 )
5. The patient is no longer able to participate for other medical reasons (e.g. surgery, 
adverse events, or other diseases)
6. The patient meets one of the criteria that require permanent discontinuation of trial drug 
or dose reductions beyond those specified in section [IP_ADDRESS]
7.  Investigator and patient (following discussion) consider it in the patient’s best interest to 
remove the patient from BI 836845 following results of the phase II trial.
8.  The trial is terminated for any of the reasons listed in section [IP_ADDRESS] ”Discontinuation of 
the trial by [CONTACT_456]”.
Patients who discontinue or withdraw prior to entering the active treatment phase will be 
entered in the trial database and will be reported. The data for patients who discontinued or withdrew from the trial after entering the active treatment phase must be documented and the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the eCRF. These data must be included in the trial database and must be reported.
If an individual patient withdraws consent for further participation in the trial including 
withdrawal to be followed up, the patient will be asked to have an end of trial investigation and the data collected until the point in time when withdrawal occurred will be included in the final analysis of the trial data. No further follow-up will be done for this patient. However, the investigator will be allowed to report the date and reason of death in case ofpublic registry, or the investigator becomes aware of the date and/or reason for death.
[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation of the trial by [CONTACT_23286] a particular trial 
site at any time for the following reasons:
1. Failure to meet expected enrolment goals overall or at a particular trial site,
2. Emergence of any efficacy/safety information that could significantly affect continuation 
of the trial or any other administrative reasons.
3. Violation of GCP, the CTP, or the contract by a trial site or investigator, disturbing the 
appropriate conduct of the trial.
4. Discontinuation of the clinical development program with BI [ADDRESS_1188911] cancer. Consequently, the clinical development of xentuzumab (BI 836845) was discontinued by [CONTACT_853999], including in CRPC.  Due to the worsening in benefit-risk and the discontinuation of the clinical development program with BI 836845 in CRPC, the trial will proceed towards termination based on the following 3 steps:

xentuzumab can still be eligible for continued treatment with enzalutamide (standard of care in this setting) provided they are tolerating the drug without tumor progression.
b. When all patients have discontinued xentuzumab treatment, if any patient on 
enzalutamide is able to continue taking this approved medication off study, then, at the request of the sponsor, the patient may end such treatment as part of the trial and discontinue study participation (if both the Investigator and patient agree).
c. After all patients end treatment with all study drugs (xentuzumab and enzalutamide),

For phase Ib escalation:
Patients will be replaced for determination of the primary endpoint (MTD) in cases of:
∀Patient’s withdrawal during the first cycle of treatment for reasons other than DLT, e.g. 
patient no longer wishes to participate, or lost to follow up during first cycle.
∀Patients who do not experience DLT, but miss more than one dose of BI [ADDRESS_1188912] cycle of treatment. 
∀Patients who do not experience DLT, but miss [ADDRESS_1188913] cycle of treatment.
∀Patients who miss one complete cycle at any time beyond the first cycle of treatment may 
be replaced after discussion between the sponsor and the investigator.
∀Patients who are non-evaluable with respect to DLT.
∀Patients with CTCAE grade ≥3 allergic reaction/hypersensitivity to the study drug(s) 
within the first cycle will be replaced.
Patients that have been replaced might continue treatment in the trial should criteria in section 
[IP_ADDRESS] apply; however these patients will not be considered for analysis of the primary 
endpoint of this part.
For phase Ib expansion cohort:
Patients who withdraw after assignment but before start of therapy will be replaced.

studies in both a weekly ( U11-3025 ) and 3-weekly dosing scheme ( U10-2994 ).  Minimal 
protocol defined DLTs were observed and no MTD was reached in either study; however a 
relevant biological dose was determined.
A dose of BI 836845 is considered biologically relevant, when concentrations of free IGF-1 
and free IGF-2 are considerably reduced over time. Free IGF-1 and free IGF-2 plasma concentrations are not measured in studies 1280.1 and 1280.2. Therefore a semi-mechanisticPK/PD model was developed describing the time-dependent kinetics of and the interaction between BI 836845 and the different PD biomarkers (i.e. IGF-1, IGF-2, and IGFBP3) over time. Simulations using this model indicate that a weekly dosing of 1000 mg BI 836845 reduces free IGF-1 concentration by [CONTACT_726] 90% and in addition free IGF-2 by 64 % at trough steady-state relative to pre-treatment; this is considered a relevant biological effect. Therefore, a weekly dose of 1000 mg BI 836845 is considered a suitable dose.

The recommended dose of enzalutamide, as per the SPC, is 160 mg (four 40 mg capsules, 
four 40mg tablets or two 80mg tablets) administered orally once daily and can be taken with or without food (for dosing instructions on PK sampling visits see below).
[IP_ADDRESS] Determination of the dose of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamideThe phase Ib tolerability and safety phase (phase Ib escalation cohort) will be performed to 
determine the MTD, recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide using a 3+3 design in order to confirm the recommended dose to be used in thephase II randomised trial and exploratory expansion cohort.
Dosing with BI 836845 will be as follows:

Non-evaluable patients for DLT will be replaced. 
The decision on dose escalation and determination of next dose, the MTD, and/or 
recommended phase II dose (the exploratory expansion cohort will also use the same dose as Phase II) will be determined after discussion with the trial team comprising of at least one BI Clinical Monitor, BI project physician (TMM) and Coordinating Investigator, or designee, and taking into account patient safety.
[IP_ADDRESS] Exploratory expansion cohortFor the exploratory expansion cohort patients will have received prior enzalutamide, but no 
prior abiraterone for CRPC, and while on enzalutamide show a rise in PSA according to standard criteria ( R13-1642 ), and section 3.3.2 (inclusion criterion #19), before entry into the 
trial. Patients may not have received any prior taxane-based chemotherapy before entering 
this cohort. Approximately 25 patients will be treated with the combination therapy of BI 836845 and enzalutamide at the MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D).  This expansion cohort will allow for further safety, tolerability and PK assessments (including investigation of potential drug-drug interaction), in addition to the evaluation of anti-tumour activity.
The current enzalutamide treatment taken prior to the trial must be continued after 
patient informed consent and throughout the screening period and up to the day before
the dosing with BI 836845. A compliance check of enzalutamide taken prior to the first day 
of study treatment should be performed to ensure consistent dosing up to the point of entry into the study, see section 4.3 .
Safety will be continually assessed and reported accordingly for all repeated cycles of 
treatment for all patients throughout the phase Ib escalation and at the MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D).

[IP_ADDRESS] Phase Ib tolerability/safety and dose finding phase
Initially, three patients will be treated at the starting dose regimen (75% BI 836845 and 100% 
enzalutamide). Dose escalation will be performed according to the rules outlined in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] . Dose escalation and entry of patients into the highest dose regimen will begin only 
after accrual of the required minimum number of patients has been achieved and all patients 
in the cohort have completed cycle 1 (28 days) of treatment. Patients who are not treated to the end of the first cycle for any reasons other than DLT will be replaced, as per section 3.3.[ADDRESS_1188921] be treated at the MTD, or recommended phase IIdose (RP2D) before commencement of the phase Ib exploratory expansion cohort and phaseII.

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of potential hyperglycaemia 
Hyperglycaemia as a consequence of BI [ADDRESS_1188940] 
treatment regimens such as oral hyperglycaemic therapy, e.g. metformin, sulfonylurea and/or insulin as per standard and/or local guidance. When treatment with the study drug is discontinued the need for further antidiabetic treatment has to be evaluated depending on the blood glucose levels of the patient. The appropriate expert advice should be considered in the management of hyperglycaemia.
4.2.2 Restrictions
[IP_ADDRESS] Restrictions regarding concomitant treatment
Additional chemo-, immuno-, hormone- or radiotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_853966]. 
For symptom control palliative radiotherapy may be permitted for bone metastases after 
discussion with the sponsor provided that radiotherapy does not affect the target lesions, and the reason for the radiotherapy does not reflect progressive disease.
Strong inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513]) of CYP2C8 are to be 
avoided. If patients must be co-administered a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced to 80 mg once daily. 
Enzalutamide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19. Patients taking medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A4 (see appendix 
10.[ADDRESS_1188941]), CYP2C9 (e.g. warfarin, phenytoin), or CYP2C19 (e.g. S-
mephenytoin), should be evaluated for possible loss of pharmacological effects (or increase 
in effects in cases where active metabolites are formed) during the first month of enzalutamide treatment, and dose adjustment should be considered as appropriate.
Enzymes that may also be induced include CYP2B6 and uridine 5'-diphospho-
glucuronosyltransferase (UGTs - glucuronide conjugating enzymes). Patients taking medicinal products that are substrates of CYP2B6 (e.g. bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], efavirenz) or UGT1A1 should be evaluated for possible loss of pharmacological effects (or increase in effects in cases where active metabolites are formed) during the first month of enzalutamide treatment, and dose adjustment should be considered as appropriate.
Enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of the efflux transporter P-gp. Medicinal products with a 
narrow therapeutic range that are substrates for P-gp (e.g. colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin) should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with enzalutamide and may require dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma concentrations.
Please refer always to the current SPC/label for specific restrictions for enzalutamide.
Additional restrictions for patients in Phase Ib expansion:
In order to effectively assess the potential for pharmacokinetic drug interaction between 
enzalutamide and BI 836845 and to investigate potential alterations of pharmacokinetics

A list of examples is provided in appendix 10.3.2 . Switching to a different class of drug that 
is not a strong or moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor/inducer or CYP3A4 inhibitor/inducer is 
recommended.
Outside the above time periods, follow the respective drug package insert/SPC when 
considering concomitant treatment with CYP2C8 inhibitors/inducers and CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers.
Anti-platelet medications (e.g. acetyl salicylic acid) should be discontinued 7 days prior to 
tumour biopsy. Anticoagulant medications should be discontinued prior to tumour biopsy. In all patients, the risk of discontinuing anti-platelet and/or anticoagulant medications must be weighed against the (potential) risk of bleeding during/after biopsy. Anti-platelet and anticoagulant may be restarted after tumour biopsy by [CONTACT_854013].
Any concomitant medication should be reduced to the clinically necessary minimum on the 
days of BI 836845 infusion.
Treatment with other investigational drugs or treatment within another clinical trial is not 
allowed at any time during this trial.
[IP_ADDRESS] Restrictions on diet and life style
There are no major dietary or life style restrictions except that patients should attend visits in 
a fasting condition at the site for analysis of specific blood parameters (glucose and HbA1c on day 1 of every cycle).
Patients are requested to take enzalutamide at the same time every morning to facilitate 
accurate PK analysis. (This also applies to patients in the screening phase of the expansion cohort).
On day -1 of the screening period (expansion cohort only) and day 1 of cycle 2 (phase Ib
and phase II), patients should remain fasting for at least 1 hour after administration of 
enzalutamide , (i.e. food/water intake is not allowed before the 1:00 h PK sample). The 
timing of food intake prior to and after enzalutamide administration must be recorded 
in the eCRF.

4.3 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE
BI 836845:
BI 836845 will be administered as a single infusion over one hour under supervision of the 
investigator or dedicated study personnel.
Enzalutamide:
On the days of PK sampling, patients must take enzalutamide in the clinic and should not 
take the dose at home prior to the visit. Sites should be encouraged to schedule PK visits 
early in the morning to accommodate consistent dosing schedules. 
For patients in the phase Ib expansion cohort :
Patients in the expansion cohort must be questioned by [CONTACT_854014] -1 (screening 
period) and at cycle [ADDRESS_1188943] be recorded in the eCRF.
For patients in the phase II arm B :

5.1.2 Assessment of efficacy (anti-tumour activity)
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of tumours and bone
For soft tissue lesions:
Radiological disease progression will be evaluated at the investigative site and be based on 
tumour assessments in bone and/or soft tissue lesions. For patients with measurable disease at baseline, progression will be determined according to modified RECIST 1.1( R09-0262 ). See 
Appendix 10.[ADDRESS_1188945] criteria.
The following modification applies only for lymph nodes as per the Prostate Cancer Clinical 
Trials Working Group ( R13-1642 ): only lymph nodes > 20 mm in the short diameter at 
baseline should be used to assess a change in size during the trial and may be considered a 
target lesion. 
Re-appearing, or enlarging, lymph nodes < [ADDRESS_1188946] will make every effort to assess the patient’s disease

Proprietary confidential information. ![ADDRESS_1188947], abdomen and pelvis at 
screening. If clinically indicated, imaging of any other known or suspected sites of disease using an appropriate method (CT scan or MRI) should be performed. After study entry, all lesions identified during the screening should be followed up at all specified imaging time points. 
The same radiological procedure should be used throughout the study at baseline and for all 
repeated measurements according to the Flow Chart . Clinical tumour assessment will 
contribute to the decision for continued patient participation in the trial. Every effort should 
be made to objectively evaluate tumour response for all patients who enter into the trial, including those who discontinue prematurely. 
If a patient presents with marginal or equivocal tumour progression at their first RECIST 
assessment, confirmation by a second scan [ADDRESS_1188948] assessment CRF page. 
For bone:
A bone scan should be performed at screening, at 8 week intervals until week 24 (i.e. weeks 
8, 16 and 24) and then at 12 week intervals thereafter (i.e. weeks 36, 48 etc) throughout the trial at until disease progression and/or new anticancer therapy is started. 
Radiographic progression on bone scans is defined by [CONTACT_4868] (as per the 
Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 ( R13-1642 )):
∀≥ 2 new bone lesions on bone scan performed within the flare window plus ≥2 
additional at confirmation (“2 + 2”) on a second bone scan ≥ [ADDRESS_1188949] scan that shows the change.
∀≥ 2 new bone lesions on bone scans performed after the flare window, disease 
progression is determined at that assessment.
∀If bone scan does not show new lesions OR new lesions are not consistent with 
progression, then patient should continue on study protocol and continue dosing until 
the next tumour assessment, as clinically indicated, until radiographic disease progression.
The flare window is considered as 12 weeks from randomization for patients in phase II and 
12 weeks from start of treatment for patients in phase Ib escalation and expansion.

For examples of bone scan progression using the prostate cancer clinical trials working group 
guidelines (PCWG2), see appendix 10.[ADDRESS_1188950] 1.1 progression criteria.
In general:
Assessments will be performed at screening, or if valid results are available as part of routine 
clinical practice and are within 28 days prior to start of study treatment, repeat imaging will not be required. Imaging will be at baseline and then every 2 cycles (8 weeks) up to week 24 and then every 3 cycles (12 weeks) thereafter i.e. prior to the start of cycles 3, 5, 7, 10 onwards. Tumour assessments may be performed up to 7 days prior to the scheduled date for start of the relevant cycle/assessment date.
In the event of a delay, interruption or discontinuation of treatment, tumour assessment 
should continue to follow the original schedule. The schedule should be followed until 
progression is observed or until the patient commences further treatment for disease, 
whichever occurs first. For patients who prematurely discontinue study medication without disease progression, tumour assessments should continue to be performed until disease progression or start of further treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of PSAPSA assessments and determination of response, or progression, will be performed locally.
Early changes in PSA should not be considered in clinical decisions for continuation of participation in the trial. PSA will be assessed according to the schedule on the Flow chart . 
PSA will be measured during screening to confirm eligibility and at cycle 1 day 1 before 
study treatment for a baseline value.  PSA will be measured 8 weeks later at the start of cycle 3 and every cycle thereafter to assess possible disease response or progression.
PSA progression is defined in this study as the date that a 25% or greater increase in PSA and 
an absolute increase of 2 ng/mL or more from the nadir is documented (which is confirmed by a second value 3 or more weeks later) ( R13-1642 ).  Patients should be kept on trial until 
radiological or symptomatic progression is documented with or without confirmed PSA 
progression.
[IP_ADDRESS] Circulating tumour cell (CTC) assessmentsCirculating tumour cells will be analysed using the Veridex CellSearch technology. After cell 
counting, isolated CTCs might be used for morphological, protein or molecularcharacterization by [CONTACT_4656]. CTC counts will be exploratory evaluated as prognostic and surrogate efficacy markers.

Proprietary confidential information. ![ADDRESS_1188951] 10 mL blood will be taken from a forearm vein 
at those time points specified in the Flow Chart and immediately shipped to a CRO with 
given authorization by [CONTACT_35978].
Measurements and analysis will be made to determine the maximum decline in CTC counts 
compared to baseline that occurs at any point after treatment start. CTC response will be measured by a CTC reduction compared to baseline: CTC decline from ≥5 to <5 cells per 7.5
ml blood ( R14-0865 ) for at least one time point after treatment start will be reported, as will
all declines in CTC counts of 30% or more. 
5.1.3 Central Imaging
Until the primary analysis, image data collection in phase II will be sent to a central imaging 
unit to obtain an independent blinded confirmation of tumour response assessment based on a uniform interpretation of radiographic image for all patients entered on to the trial. Upon receipt of image data, the central imaging unit will log all data onto a tracking system and perform quality control of digitised radiographic images.
An independent review of radiographic images including: (i) sequential lesion selection and 
measurement, (ii) incremental radiological response assessment followed by, (iii) global review of tumour response or progression, will be performed by [CONTACT_11136] (with regard to patient, treatment, and visit) radiologist. 
The review of the image data will be performed by [CONTACT_499847], who are not 
affiliated with the study. All procedures will be done according to the specifications provided in the investigator site file. The purpose of the blinded reading is to independently assess patient response to therapy and disease progression (for details, please refer to the ISF).
Further details of the independent review are described in the Imaging Charter. Modifications 
of the conventional RECIST 1.1 lesion measurement criteria will be introduced into the measurement process in an attempt to reduce variability in the measurements for the independent central imaging review. Eligibility and treatment decisions will be based on the assessment of disease by [CONTACT_093] (as per Section [IP_ADDRESS] andappendix 10.4 ). Central 
imaging will not be used for this purpose and the results of the central imaging review will 
not be communicated to the investigator.
5.2 SAFETY
5.2.1 Endpoint(s) of safety
Safety of BI 836845 when administered together with enzalutamide will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_854016], and will be graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03 dated 14 June 2010 ( R10-4848 ). Safety endpoints will include:

Primary endpoints (Phase Ib Escalation):
∀Number of patients with Dose Limiting Toxicities 
∀Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of BI 836845
All other safety endpoints will be defined in Section 5.3.1 and details are provided in Section 
5.2.2.
5.2.2 Assessment of adverse events
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of adverse events
Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untowar d medical occurrence in a patient or clinical
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal re lationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of amedicinal product, whether or not consid ered related to the medicinal product.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE which:
∀results in death,
∀is life-threatening,
∀requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574],
∀results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,
∀is a congenital anomaly/birth 
defect,
      or∀is to be deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when 
based upon appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed in the above definitions.
Life-threatening in this context refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have causeddeath if more severe.
An AE does not meet the SAE criteria for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_853967]:
∀The subject was treated in the emergency room but was not admitted for an overnight 
stay
∀Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_853968]-planned treatments or procedures
Boehringer Ingelheim 06 Jun 2022

∀Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_853969]
∀Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_853970] “Always  Serious”
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events,
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which by [CONTACT_15623], can always be
considered to be “serious” even though they may not have met the criteria of an SAE as
given above.
The latest list of “Always Serious AEs” can be found in the RDC system. A copy of the 
latest list of “Always Serious AEs” will be provided to you upon request. These events 
should always be reported as SAEs as described in Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_1188952] (AESIs)
The term AESI relates to any specific AE that ha s been identified at the project level as 
being of particular concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment within 
this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same 
class. AESI need to be reported to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAE, see Section 5.2.2 .
The following are considered as AESIs: 
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury is defined by [CONTACT_35961]:
For patients with normal liver function at baseline:
∀an elevation of AST and/or ALT ≥[ADDRESS_1188953] combined with an elevation of 
total bilirubin ≥[ADDRESS_1188954] measured in the same blood draw sample, and/or
∀marked peak aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥[ADDRESS_1188955]
For patients with impaired function tests at baseline:
∀an elevation of transaminase ≥ (baseline + [ADDRESS_1188956]) combined with an elevation 
of total bilirubin ≥ [ADDRESS_1188957] measured in the same blood draw sample.
∀patients with abnormal liver function tests must have their abnormalities and the 
etiology documented in detail as baseline conditions. Every effort should be 
made to explain possible deteriorations of baseline conditions
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according the “DILI checklist” provided in the ISF. In case of clinical symptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy, unexplained coagulopathy, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should 
make sure these parameters are analysed, if  necessary in an unscheduled blood test. 
Should the results meet the criteria of hepa tic injury alert, the procedures described in 
the DILI checklist should be followed.

Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs):
∀DLTs occurring during the phase Ib escalation cohort will be considered protocol-
specified AESI. See section 5.2.3 for DLT definitions. AESI will be reported on the 
eCRFs/SAE reporting forms, as per the SAE reporting instructions detailed in the 
‘Adverse Event Reporting’ section of the Investigator Site File.
AESI are to be reported in an expedited manner similar to Serious Adverse Events, even if 
they do not meet any of the seriousness criteria – for details please see section 5.2.2 .
Intensity of AEs
The intensity of adverse events should be classified and recorded in the (e) CRF according to 
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03 dated 14 June 
2010 ( R10-4848 ) in the (e)CRF.
Causal relationship of AEs
Medical judgment should be used to dete rmine the relationship, considering all relevant
factors, including pattern of reaction, temp oral relationship, de-challenge or re-
challenge, confounding factors such as conc omitant medication, concomitant diseases
and relevant history.
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relati onship between the investigational 
product administered and the AE.
No: There is no reasonable causal relati onship between the investigational 
product administered and the AE.
The causal relationship must be provided by [CONTACT_338011], i.e. 
the BI trial drug and for all other trial drugs (such as any active comparator or placebo and for trial procedure).
The reason for the decision on causal relationship needs to be provided in the (e)CRF and 
on the SAE form (if applicable).
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event collection and reporting
AE Collection
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate eCRF by [CONTACT_29256]:
- From signing the informed consent onwards through the Residual Effect 
period (REP), until the end of the REP all AEs (non-serious and serious), and 
AESIs.
- After the end of the REP until trial completion, all related SAEs and related AESIs.- If in an individual patient only vital status information (Phase II patients only)
is collected from a certain timepoint on, no further AEs or AESIs will bereported for this patient.

Figure [IP_ADDRESS]: [ADDRESS_1188958] report SAEs, AESIs, and non-serious AEs which are relevant for thereported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form immediately (within 24 hours ) to the 
Sponsor’s unique entry point (country specific reporting process will be provided in theISF). In specific occasions the Investigator could inform the Sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the requirement to complete and send the BI SAE form.
With receipt of any further information to these events, a follow-up SAE form has to 
be provided. For follow-up information the same rules and timeline apply as forinitial information.
Information required
For each AE, the Investigator should provide the information requested on the appropriate
(e)CRF pages and the BI SAE form, e.g. onset, end date, intensity, treatment required, 
outcome, seriousness, and action taken with the investigational drug(s). The Investigator 
should determine the causal relationship to the trial medication, the trial procedures 
outlined under section 6.2 , and any possible interactions between the investigational
drug(s) and a non-investigational product (NIMP)
The following should also be recorded as an (S)AE in the (e)CRF and SAE form 
(if applicable):
∀  Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre-existing conditions

Boehringer Ingelheim 06 Jun 2022

∀  Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination and laboratory test results, if 
they are judged clinically relevant by [CONTACT_737].
If such abnormalities already pre-exist prior trial inclusion they will be considered 
as baseline conditions.
All (S)AEs, including those persisting after trial completion must be followed up until 
they have resolved, have been sufficiently cha racterized, or no further information can be 
obtained.
Screening failures:
SAEs occurring in patients after having discontinued in the trial due to screening failures, 
i.e after the screening period and who did not receive any trial medication, are to be reported if 
the Investigator considered the SAE related to the screening procedure. SAE which occurred during the screening period are to be reported according to standard practices .
Pregnancy
In the rare case that a female partner of a subject participating in this clinical trial becomes pregnant, the Investigator must report immed iately (within 24 hours) the drug exposure to 
female partners of male participants during pregnancy (DEDP) to the Sponsor’s unique entrypoint (country- specific contact [CONTACT_15626]). The PregnancyMonitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A) should be used.
The outcome of the pregnancy associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy must
be followed up and reported to the Sponsor’s unique entry point on the Pregnancy
Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part B).
As pregnancy itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompanying
SAE, only the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials and not the SAE form is to be completed. If there is an SAE associated with the pregnancy then the SAE has to bereported on the SAE form in addition.
The ISF will contain the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and B).
Exemption to (S)AE Reporting:
Disease Progression is a trial endpoint for analysis of efficacy and as such is exempted from 
reporting as an (S)AE.  Progression of the patients underlying malignancy will be recorded on the appropriate pages of the (e)CRF as part of efficacy data collection only and will not be reported on the SAE Form. It will therefore not be entered in the safety database (ARISg) and hence not get expeditiously reported. Death due to disease progression is also to be recorded on the appropriate (e)CRF page and not on the SAE Form.
However, when there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the study drug(s) 
and the progression of the underlying malignancy, the event must be reported as an SAE on the SAE Form and on the (e)CRF.
Examples of exempted events of PD may be:

• Progression of underlying malignancy (Progressive disease [PD]):  if PD is clearly 
consistent with the suspected progression of the underlying malignancy as defined by [CONTACT_810550]. • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/Procedures due solely to the progression of underlying malignancy (PD)• Clinical symptoms and/or signs of progression (without confirmation by [CONTACT_480110] e.g. imaging, clinical measurement): if the symptom can exclusively be determined to be due to the progression of the underlying malignancy and does meet the expected pattern of progression for the disease under study. 
Exempted events are collected and tracked following a protocol-specified monitoring plan.Exempted events are monitored at appropriate intervals by [CONTACT_1578].
5.2.3 Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) definitions
DLTs will be assessed during the phase Ib escalation part of the study. The determination of 
the number of DLTs experienced during the first cycle of treatment will be used to identify the MTD of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide.
A study drug-related adverse event constitutes a DLT, if one of the following applies during 
treatment in the phase Ib escalation cohort:
∀AST or ALT > 5x ULN (for baseline AST/ALT ≤ ULN) or > (baseline value + 4x ULN) 
(for baseline AST/ALT > ULN)
∀CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 toxicity (except for incompletely treated nausea, untreated 
vomiting, untreated diarrhoea, fatigue, infusion reaction, electrolyte, or AST/ALT).
∀CTCAE Grade ≥2 infusion reaction despi[INVESTIGATOR_679761]-medication.
∀CTCAE Grade ≥2 nausea and/or vomiting persisting for 7 or more days despi[INVESTIGATOR_853971].
∀Any grade 4 hyperglycaemia (symptomatic or asymptomatic).
∀Any Grade 3 hyperglycaemia lasting >48 hours.
∀Any electrolyte grade 3 AE which is refractory to optimal correction therapy
∀Seizure event of any CTCAE grade
∀No recovery from a non-DLT CTCAE grade >2 toxicity to grade 1 within 14 days of 
administered dose
∀Sustained fatigue/asthenia grade 3 for longer than 96 hours associated with deterioration 
of ECOG Performance Score
∀Any other study drug related toxicity at any time point during the study considered 
significant enough to be qualified as DLT in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_853972], will be reported as a DLT.
It is essential that patients are treated sufficiently according to supportive care standards.
As patients with a documented clinical benefit, e.g. objective tumour response or absence of 
tumour progression, will receive further treatment with the trial drug all DLT events in individual patients occurring at any time during treatment cycles, or the follow-up period, must be reported as an AESI.

the sponsor and the clinical investigators at all sites, and in consideration of all the available toxicity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data.
5.2.4 Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D)
The maximum tolerated dose in this study is defined as the highest protocol dose level of BI 
[ADDRESS_1188960] 28 day treatment cycle – i.e. the incidence of a dose limiting toxicity is no more than 17%. DLT events experienced after the start of the second treatment course will be examined separately.
The MTD or a lower dose level will be chosen as the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) 
based on the totality of the safety data available at the time that [ADDRESS_1188961] 
finished course 1 of treatment at the MTD (or RP2D if MTD not reached); at the earliest . 
The discussion and agreement on dose selection between the phase Ib escalation investigators and the sponsor will be documented and communicated to all participating sites. The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) will also be used for the phase Ib expansion cohort.
5.2.5 Assessment of safety laboratory parameters
Safety assessments, including clinical and laboratory evaluations will be assessed during 
treatment cycles according to Flow Chart . Adverse events are to be graded according to the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, CTCAE 
version 4.03, 14 June 2010 ( R10-4848 ). Changes in laboratory tests from baseline will be 
assessed.
Assessment of safety laboratory parameters prior to approval of protocol version 10
Blood samples, including fasting serum samples (fasting state from midnight the night 
before), will be collected up to one day prior to the scheduled time points as specified in the Flow Chart and analysed in a laboratory facility at (or close to) the investigational site. Safety 
laboratory examinations include hematology, biochemistry, coagulation and urine 
examination. See Table 5.2.5: 1 for details. Futher samples may be taken throughout the course of the study when deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093]. All analyses are to be performed by [CONTACT_701151].

performed in all patients at the time-points as specified in the Flow Chart and Appendix 10.[ADDRESS_1188965] any ECG abnormality that meets AE criteria. 
Triplicate ECGs will be recorded at the following time-points:
∀Screening
∀Pre-dose (-20 min. to -5 min. before administration of BI 836845 and/or 
enzalutamide) and immediately after the end of infusion of BI 836845 (within 15
minutes after the end infusion to ensure PK sampling is also completed within 15 minutes), or one hour after the administration of enzalutamide on the following days*:
o Cycle 1: Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 
o Cycle 2: Day 8, Day 15 
o Cycle 3: Day 1, Day 8, Day 15
o Cycles 6, 9, 12 and in 12 weeks intervals thereafter on Day 1
∀EOT
∀First follow-up visit only
* ECGs to be taken prior to PK sample time-points where applicable. See appendix 10.6 for 
ECG flowchart.
ECGs will only be correlated to PK for the drug combination (BI 836845 and enzalutamide) 
during phase Ib and phase II arm A.
All ECGs will be recorded digitally with ECG equipment provided by a CRO ECG core lab.Before study start the study sites will be trained for the proper use of the equipment and 
transfer of the electronic data to the CRO core lab. To be able to assess the electrocardiographic variables in resting phases the ECGs have to be recorded in supi[INVESTIGATOR_853973]. At specific time-points 
triplicate ECGs will be recorded to minimize the physiologically induced QT and heart rate variability. The recordings will be evaluated at the site by [CONTACT_093] (or  delegate) to assess any ECG abnormalities and changes in interval duration. ECG abnormalities will be

All ECGs will be sent to the CRO core lab to centrally and independently evaluate the
electrocardiograms.
After the primary analysis of the study, a decision can be made by [CONTACT_854018]. Thereafter the ECG will be evaluated locally by [CONTACT_404489]
[IP_ADDRESS] ECG evaluationThe digitally recorded ECGs sent to the CRO core lab will be evaluated for cardiac intervals 
(RR, PR/PQ, QRS, QT and heart rate-corrected QT (QTc)). Measurements of the cardiac intervals will be done from three (possibly consecutive) normal heart complexes in lead II using the core lab’s procedures. Heart rate correction of QT intervals will be done using Fridericia’s and Bazett’s formula. In addition, the ECGs will be reviewed by a board-certified cardiologist using a standardized worksheet to obtain clinically significant findings such as rhythm, morphology, and conduction abnormalities as well as those of ST Segments, T and U waves. The central measurement of the ECG intervals will be done in all ECGs. In triplicate ECG recordings one randomly selected ECG from this time-point will be evaluated. In case of clinically significant abnormalities (e.g. heart blocks or large changes in interval duration) the CRO core lab may contact [CONTACT_854019]. Changes in QT interval compared to baseline will be evaluated internally at BI.
5.2.7 Left ventricular ejection fraction
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) as measured by [CONTACT_854020]. The same method of measurement should be used throughout the study.
5.2.8 Assessment of vital signs and physical examination
Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse and respi[INVESTIGATOR_853974]) and 
temperature will be recorded at the screening visit and at the time points specified in the Flow 
Chart.
A physical examination, including weight, will be performed at screening and at the time 
points specified in the Flow Chart . The physical examination should include a thorough 
cardiopulmonary examination, an examination of the regional lymph nodes, an examination 
of the abdomen and an assessment of the mental and neurological status. Additional symptoms which have not been reported during a previous examination should be clarified. A physician should perform this examination. Measurement of height (in cm) and body weight (in kg) and the evaluation of the ECOG performance score and  will be performed at the time points specified in the Flow Chart.

6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
6.1.1 Screening Visit: -[ADDRESS_1188968] administration of study 
drug/s on day 1 (visit 1) of cycle 1. Patients who have signed the informed consent and meet all eligibility criteria will be scheduled to begin treatment with either: BI 836845 and 
enzalutamide (phase Ib and phase II arm A), or enzalutamide alone (phase II arm B).
6.1.[ADDRESS_1188969] day of infusion of BI 836845 in cycle 
1. Administration of BI 836845 will be weekly and enzalutamide will be daily over a 28 day
cycle of treatment in phase Ib and phase II of the study.
All treatment cycles will comprise of four visit days as per the Flow Chart Phase Ib and 
Phase II. 
During the phase II randomised trial of the study from cycle 4 onwards patients on arm B 
(enzalutamide only) will only be required to attend for one visit per cycle on day 1 and when imaging assessments are scheduled; optional telephone contact [CONTACT_854021] 8, day 15 and day 22 per cycle where required, and at the discretion of the investigator, for the collection of AE and concomitant medication information. For those patients receiving the combination treatment in any part of the trial, and who later discontinue BI 836845 permanently, they may attend only on day 1 of every cycle, from cycle 4 onwards, and when 
imaging assessments are scheduled.
For those patients that complete cycle 3 in phase Ib and phase II, these cycles will be repeated 
where clinical benefit is indicated. All assessments stated for cycle 3 in phase Ib and phase II will be repeated for all subsequent cycles, unless otherwise indicated in the Flow Chart. 
Tumour assessments, including bone scans, will be performed as per the Flow Chart at week 
8, week 16, week 24, week 36 and every 12 weeks thereafter. All tumour assessment visits may be within 7 days prior to the start of the respective cycle of treatment.
PK, biomarker assessments, PSA, CTC and immunogenicity sampling will be conducted for 
all days stated in the Flow Chart and Appendix 10.6 .
No visit windows will be permitted on day 1 (visit 1) at the start of a cycle. On days 8, day 15 
and 22 of every cycle a ±1 day window will be permitted.
All planned visit dates are programmed from the start of day 1 (visit 1) of cycle 1. If a visit is 
missed there will be no re-scheduling; if a patient should attend the study site between the “missed” and scheduled visit, then the missed visit assessments should be performed. The current date and the reason for the delay must be noted in the medical records. All subsequent visits must adhere to the scheduled programme of visits for all cycles of treatment.
In situations where a patient is unable or unwilling to attend a clinic visit, the investigator 
must assess the risk-benefit balance for the individual patient and may decide to perform a

7. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF 
SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN – MODEL
This is a Phase Ib/II open label trial split into three parts. Phase Ib escalation follows a 3+3 
design, and the objective of this phase is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide. There is also an exploratory expansion cohort in phase Ib; the objective is to evaluate restoration of anti-tumour activity of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide. In phase II, patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to two treatment arms: BI 836845 + enzalutamide (Arm A), and enzalutamide alone (Arm B). The objective of phase II is to further explore the anti-tumour activity and safety of BI [ADDRESS_1188986] received and progressed after docetaxel and abiraterone treatment.
7.2 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
As an exploratory Phase Ib/II trial, inferences about the efficacy of BI 836845 in combination 
with enzalutamide will be based on the magnitude of the observed difference in PFS and other efficacy endpoints (including overall survival), rather than formal hypothesis testing. 
7.3 PLANNED ANALYSES
During phase Ib (escalation), cohorts of patients treated with BI 836845 in combination with 
enzalutamide will be evaluated continuously based on the safety profile in order to determine the MTD and /or recommended phase II dose. This MTD, and /or recommended phase IIdose will be used in the phase Ib expansion cohort and in phase II. 
Efficacy analyses will include all randomised patients in phase II. For phase Ib expansion 
cohort PFS will be summarised on cohort level. No comparisons between dose cohorts will be performed for phase Ib escalation.
Safety analyses will be summarized separately for patients treated in phase Ib and phase II. 
The safety profile for the phase II patients will be compared in a descriptive manner between the BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide arm, and the enzalutamide only arm.
7.3.1 Primary analyses
The primary analysis of PFS for the phase II will be conducted and reported when 
approximately 60 patients (out of 80 randomised patients) have progressed or died. However, it may be performed with fewer events after approximately [ADDRESS_1188987] patient being randomized in the Phase II part. Any additional information collected after the data cut-off for the primary analysis will be part of a revised report.
A Cox proportional hazards model (using Breslow’s method for dealing with ties) will be 
used to analyse PFS for the phase II patients. The model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide vs. enzalutamide alone, where a value

Proprietary confidential information. ![ADDRESS_1188988] ratio, its asymptotic two-sided 95% confidence interval and asymptotic two-sided p-value when testing against a value of one will be displayed. The proportional hazards assumption will also be checked.
The Kaplan-Meier survival rate quartiles (with two-sided 95% confidence intervals found 
using Greenwood’s variance estimate) will be presented for each treatment group. The equality of the survival curves will be tested by [CONTACT_63450]-rank test at the 5% significance level.
PFS for phase Ib expansion, patients will be summarized separately to phase II patients using 
descriptive statistics only.
PFS is defined as the time from randomisation for phase II (from the start of treatment for 
phase Ib) to disease progression in bone based on prostate cancer clinical trials working group (PCWG2) criteria, or soft tissue based on modified RECIST 1.1 (as detailed in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] ), or death. Patients without image-based progression or death at any time during the 
study will be censored at the date of their last imaging. Detailed censoring rules will be 
specified in the TSAP.
For the exploratory expansion cohort, PSA response, defined as a decline in PSA >50% 
(which is confirmed by a second value 3 to 4 weeks apart), will be used as primary endpoint. Descriptive statistics for PSA response will be provided for all treated patients. 
7.3.[ADDRESS_1188989] as 
the primary endpoint for phase II (see Section 7.3.1 ). A hazard ratio and 95% confidence 
interval for BI [ADDRESS_1188990] follow-up visit and/or when an adequate number of patients have died. The time to PSA progression will be analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model in the same way as the primary endpoint for phase II (see Section 7.3.1 ). In addition, the percentage change from baseline in PSA will 
be summarized descriptively. The maximum decline in PSA compared to baseline will be 
explored graphically. Further details will be provided in the TSAP. 
7.3.3 Safety analyses
DLTs will be tabulated for each dose cohort in phase Ib (escalation). The tabulation will be 
done in two ways:

• DLTs with onset in the first treatment course, and
• All DLTs regardless of treatment course at onset
The MTD analysis is defined in Section 5.2.4.
Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE, Version 4.03 ( R10-4848 ). Key safety 
measures will include:
∀Events leading to dose reduction or permanent treatment discontinuation
∀The overall incidence and intensity of AEs, as well as seriousness and relatedness of 
adverse events to treatment
Other safety-relevant assessments including those involving ECG, and ECOG score, will be 
described with respect to possible changes compared to baseline values. Further details on the analysis of ECG data will be specified in the TSAP.
7.3.4 Interim analyses
No formal interim analysis is planned for efficacy. In the phase Ib escalation, the study team 
will continuously monitor and assess safety data to ensure patients’ safety, as well as to determine the dose for the exploratory expansion cohort and phase II. If considered necessary, as soon as the MTD and/or the recommended phase II dose is determined, an evaluation of the safety and efficacy aspects will be performed via a snapshot of the database. Results of this evaluation will be documented and stored.
Continuous monitoring of safety data for phase Ib expansion cohort will be done by [CONTACT_854024] a benefit risk assessment during the DMC meetings. During regular meetings, the committee may examine the efficacy data in order to completely assess the benefit risk advantage of BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide.
The results of the phase Ib expansion cohort and the phase II will be analysed separately.

For partial or missing AE onset and/or end dates, BI internal rules will be followed for 
imputation (see Reference Document 001-MCG-156_RD01 “Handling of missing and incomplete AE dates”).
7.5 RANDOMISATION
No randomisation is needed for phase Ib. Patients will be assigned sequentially to the dose 
cohort at the time for the escalation part, and to the MTD and/or recommended phase II dose.
In phase II, patients will be randomised in a 1:[ADDRESS_1188992]-party phone/web-based 
randomisation during the screening phase. This will involve the use of an interactive response technology (IRT i.e. Interactive Voice Response System [IVRS]/Interactive Web Response System [IWRS]). Boehringer Ingelheim will arrange the randomisation. A randomisation list will be generated using a validated pseudo-random number generator, yielding reproducible and non-predictable results.
7.6 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
Phase Ib escalation follows a 3+3 design to determine the MTD and/or recommended phase 
II dose of BI [ADDRESS_1188993] cohort, followed by 3-6 patients in the second cohort. 
The phase Ib exploratory expansion cohort consists of one cohort treated at the MTD and/or 
recommended phase II dose. In this cohort, approximately 25 additional patients will be

treated to ensure 21 evaluable patients. Assuming a PSA response rate of 30% ( P14-[ZIP_CODE] , 
see Arm B2), a sample size of evaluable 21 patients leads to a probability of about 80% of 
observing at least 5 patients with a PSA response (as shown in Table 7.6: 1 below).
If the true PSA response rate is less i.e. 25%, then the probability of observing at least 5 PSA 
responses is 63%. If the true PSA response rate is higher i.e. 35%, then the probability of observing at least 5 PSA responses is 91%. A probability of 80% was seen as sufficient, leading to the chosen sample size of 21 evaluable patients. In the phase Ib expansion part of the study an evaluable patient is defined as a patient where data for the assessments of the primary endpoint is available.
The probability of a false positive signal is also sufficiently small given a sample size of 21 
evaluable patients. For example, the probability of observing 5 PSA responses if the true PSA response rate is 5% is less than 0.5%.

The phase II of the trial is intended to provide evidence that will allow informed decision 
making during the next stages of development. The phase II is therefore sized such that, if the true hazard ratio of BI [ADDRESS_1188995] ratio should be sufficiently small. Table 7.6: [ADDRESS_1188996] ratio and a pre-specified number of events.

is normally distributed with mean log(true hazard ratio), and variance (4 / number of PFS events) ( R10-4988 ).
3Note that [ADDRESS_1188999] ratio is 1.0 (i.e. no treatment effect) and given [ADDRESS_1189000] ratio of less than 0.8 is sufficiently low at 0.19. 
Due to the inherent difficulties determining radiographic progression in this indication, a 
central imaging unit is employed to interpret the radiographic images and obtain an independent tumour assessment in addition to the investigator’s assessment. However, due to these difficulties, there is potentially a high discordance rate between the independent review and the investigators (fewer independent review events compared to investigator assessed events). From Table 7.6: 2 it can be seen that having a discordance rate of going up to 33% –
leaving potentially only 40 independent review events – still gives a probability of between 
0.66 and 0.74 (corresponding true underling HR of between 0.65 and 0.70) of observing a HR of less than 0.8 in the evaluation of the independent review as well. If the true underlying HR should be 1.0, then the probability of observing a HR of 0.8 is still sufficiently low with 0.24.
Due to the patients’ advanced condition and previous treatment regiments obtained before 
joining this study, the estimated median PFS time in the enzalutamide arm is around 3 months, and between 4.3-4.6 months in the combination arm of BI 836845 + enzalutamide.

where λ1=0.151 and λ2=0.231 are the parameters of exponential distribution assuming median 
PFS of 4.6 months for BI 836845 in combination with enzalutamide and 3 months for emzalutamide alone.

guidelines published in the European Journal of Cancer ( R09-0262 ) and the accompanying 
articles.  Study personnel involved in tumour assessment for this trial must be trained and 
knowledgeable of RECIST criteria version 1.1.
Modification re Lymph Nodes:
The following modification applies only for lymph nodes as per the Prostate Cancer Clinical 
Trials Working Group ( R13-1642 ): only lymph nodes > 20 mm in the short diameter at 
baseline should be used to assess a change in size during the trial and may be considered a 
target lesion. 
Re-appearing, or enlarging, lymph nodes < [ADDRESS_1189021] will make every effort to assess the patient’s disease 
elsewhere, and provide explanatory comments for the oncologist to take into consideration upon determining the final overall assessment, if applicable.
When a lymph node continues to increase over [ADDRESS_1189022] assessment CRF page. 
Response criteria for target lesions :
1.   Complete Response 
(CR):Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-target) must have a reduction in short axis to <10mm)
2.   Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters
3.   Progression (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as references the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of a least 5mm (note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).
4.   Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as references the smallest sum diameters while on study

Response criteria for non-target lesions:
1.   Complete Response 
(CR):Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of 
tumour marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10mm short axis)
2.   Non-CR/ Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and 
maintenance of tumour marker level above the normal limits
3.   Progression (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions 
(Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression)

Section to be changed Section 1.1 Medical Background
Description of change The following paragraph was added: These data 
were more recently confirmed in the PREVAIL trial, investigating Enzalutamide in metastatic prostate cancer before chemotherapy: Enzalutamide significantly decreased the risk of radiographic progression and death and delayed the initiation of chemotherapy.
Rationale for change Addition of more recent clinical trial data on 
enzalutamide.

Description of change The following paragraph was removed: Whilst 
there is a lack of preclinical data for synergistic activity between IGF-targeting compounds and specifically enzalutamide thus far, there is a strong theoretical (mechanistic) rationale.
The terminology for MTD and/or recommended 
dose was updated to MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D).
The section has been updated to clarify that 
patients require a rise in PSA in order to be eligible for phase Ib expansion and the words “failing on this  treatment” have been removed.

dose was updated to MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) to be consistent throughout protocol and other protocols in 1280 program within Boehringer Ingelheim.
Patients require a rising PSA “biological 
progression” to enter the trial but have not been considered to have “failed” treatment. The words failing treatment have therefore been removed.
Inclusion of the [LOCATION_003] as country for Phase Ib 
expansion required that only patients not pre-treated with taxane-based therapy may enter the cohort.
Section to be changed Section 2.2: Trial Objectives
Description of change Primary Objectives: Primary objectives updated 
to clarify the treatment regimens that patients must/must not have received prior to entering the trial. 
 
Rationale for change Primary Objectives: The [LOCATION_003] is being added as
an additional country for the Phase Ib expansion cohort and this added the requirement to make the expansion group of patient’s pre taxane -based therapy only. The other two cohorts (phase Ib escalation and phase II) have been updated to clarify the difference in the 3 cohorts.

for the Phase Ib expansion cohort. This added therequirement to make the expansion group of patients pre taxane-based therapy only.
Patients require a rising PSA “biological 
progression” to enter the trial but have not been considered to have failed treatment. The words failing enzalutamide have therefore been removed.
The section on enzalatamide being supplied in 
from cycle 1 day 1 specifically for the study has 
been removed as the US sites will provide their 
own enzalutamide for the phase Ib expansion cohort.
The terminology for MTD and/or recommended

Section to be changed Section [IP_ADDRESS] Restrictions regarding 
concomitant treatment
Description of change This section has been updated to match the 
requirements for restricted medications in the Summary of Product Characteristics for Enzalutamide. 
Rationale for change The protocol originally had a very exhaustive list 
of medications that should be discussed and agreed with BI in case patient wanted to stay on the concomitant medication (appendix 10.3). This section was not in line with the SPC for enzalutamide. After review with the investigators this section was revised to be more in line with Summary of Product Characteristics for enzalutamide and allow investigators to make clinical decisions on the best concomitant treatments for their patients.The Summary of Product Characteristics for enzalutamide was also updated and included a new CYP substrate that has interactions with enzalutamide. Language refers investigator back to Summary of Product Characteristics for treatment related decisions to always ensure that Investigator is considering most current update.

Rationale for change Palliative radiotherapy will be allowed for all 
bone metastases so long as any target lesions are not affected by [CONTACT_854047]. This change is in line with the PCWG2 guidelines. This must be discussed with medical team at sponsor.
An exceptions section with regard to co-
medications for patients in the phase Ib expansion has been added. This covers the time frame of the drug-drug-interaction assessment for each patient. Any of these co-medications may influence the exposure of enzalutamide during this period.

additional at confirmation (“2 + 2”) on a second bone scan ≥ [ADDRESS_1189082] protocol-defined imaging assessment is scheduled at the end of week 12 of treatment (end of cycle 3 tumour assessment, within 7 days prior to Cycle 4 Day 1).
∀If this assessment shows definitive 
evidence of ≥ 2 new bone lesions 
consistent with progression, then patient should discontinue from study.

The following paragraph in the general rules on 
imaging was also updated from:
Assessments will be performed at screening, or if 
valid results are available as part of routine  clinical practice and are within 28 days prior to start of study treatment, repeat imaging will not be required . Imaging will be every 3 cycles (12 
weeks) from baseline and prior to the start of 
cycle 4, 7, 10 onwards . Tumour assessments may 
be performed up to 7 days prior to the scheduled date for start of the relevant cycle/assessment date.
To:
Assessments will be performed at screening, or if 
valid results are available as part of routine clinical practice and are within 28 days prior to start of study treatment, repeat imaging will not be required. Imaging will be at baseline and 
then every 2 cycles (8 weeks) up to week 24 and 
then every 3 cycles (12 weeks) thereafter i.e. 
prior to the start of cycles 3, 5, 7, 10 onwards . 
Tumour assessments may be performed up to 7 days prior to the scheduled date for start of the relevant cycle/assessment date.
Rationale for change The soft tissue lesion section has been updated to 
add an example of where an investigator can chose to keep patient on treatment if equivocal or marginal tumour progression is seen at the first imaging assessment at week 8.
The bone imaging section has been updated due to 
the fact that the first imaging assessment for bone lesions now falls within the flare window. A confirmation scan would therefore always be required if new lesions were seen on the first bone scan.
The section has also been updated to confirm the 
new timelines for all imaging assessments.
Reference to a new appendix 10.7 has been added

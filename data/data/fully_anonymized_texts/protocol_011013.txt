3 INTRODUCTION  
 
3.1 Overview of  Psoriasis  
Psoriasis  is a chronic  immunological  disease  characterized  by [CONTACT_134676]  T cells and by [CONTACT_134677],  resulting  
in marked  inflammation  and thickening  of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196].  Psoriasis  affects  1-3% of the 
world  population,  making  it one of the most  prevalent  inflammatory  immunological  
diseases.1 There  are several  clinical  subtypes  of psoriasis:  plaque,  guttate,  
erythrodermic,  inverse,  and pustular.  Plaque  psoriasis  is the most  common  type of 
psoriasis  affecting  75-80% of psoriasis  sufferers.²  It presents  as raised  silvery  scale,  
which can  cover large  areas, with underlying  erythema,  itching, and discomfort

 3.2 Rationale  for Treating  Plaque  Psoriasis  with Deucravacitinib  + Enstilar  
Deucravacitinib  is an investigational  TYK2  inhibitor  that has been  tested  for the 
treatment  of moderate -to-severe  psoriasis.   Combination  regimens  that utilize  a 
systemic  agent  with light  therapy  and/or  a topi[INVESTIGATOR_134655]3 and Europe4, confirming  the observation  of Lebwohl  et al5 in

5.5  STUDY  TREATMENT  
 
5.5.1  Deucravacitinib Treatment  
 
5.5.2  Deucravacitinib  Description  
 
Deucravacitinib  is manufactured  by [CONTACT_134678].  Tyrosine  kinase  2 (TYK2)  is 
associated  with specific  cytokine  receptors  and catalyzes  the phosphorylation  of signal  
transducer  and activator  of transcription  (STAT)  proteins  downstream  of these  receptors  
including  the receptors  for p40-containing  cytokines,  interleukin  (IL)-12, and IL-23, as 
well as the interferon -α and interferon -β. Type  I interferon [IFN])  receptor. TYK2  
activity  results  in  the  activation   of  STAT -dependent   transcription   and  functional  
responses  specific  for these  receptors . Deucravacitinib is  a stable  deuterium -
labeled  compound  (where  deuterium  is a stable,  nonradioactive  isotope  of 
hydrogen)  and a potent,  highly  selective  small  molecule  inhibitor  of TYK2.  
Deucravacitinib  has a unique  mode  of binding  that provides  the high selectivity  over 
the other  members  of the JAK family  of non-receptor  tyrosine  kinases.8   Selective  
inhibition  of TYK2  with the oral agent  deucravacitinib  at doses  of 3 mg daily and higher  
resulted  in greater  clearing  of psoriasis  than did placebo.9 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Deucravacitinib  Dosing  Schedule  
Deucravacitinib  6mg tablets  will be supplied  by [CONTACT_134679] (recommended in the mornings).  It is recommended  the first dose  of IP will 
be taken  in the clinic  at the baseline  visit. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Deucravacitinib  Dispensing  
Subjects  will return  all unused  deucravacitinib  tablets  to the study  site. Site personnel  
will keep  a record  of deucravacitinib  dispensed  to and returned  by [CONTACT_134680].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Deucravacitinib  Dosage  Adjustments  
If an SAE or an adverse  event  that is thought  to be related  to deucravacitinib  and is not 
alleviated  by [CONTACT_134681],  deucravacitinib  will be discontinued.  
Subjects  who permanently  discontinue  deucravacitinib  therapy  under  this protocol  should  
receive standard  care of psoriasis  treatment  as prescribed  by [CONTACT_9682].

5.6.1  Informed Consent  
This Study  will be conducted  in compliance  with CFR Title 21, Part 50 (Informed  Consent  
of Human  Subjects).  Informed  consent  will be obtained  from each  subject  in writing  
before  participation  in the Study.  A signed  copy  of the Informed  Consent  Form  will be 
provided  to each  subject.  A provision  to obtain  a signed  authorization  to provide  protected  
health  information  to the study  sponsor,  internal  quality  assurance  agencies,  health  
insurance  agencies,  and other  parties  as specified  in the Federal  Health  Insurance  
Portability  and Accountability  Act (HIPAA)  privacy  regulation  will be included  in the 
Informed  Consent  Document.  HIPAA  authorization  is voluntary.  However,  since  the use 
and release  of health  information  is critical  to the conduct  of the study,  subjects  who do 
not provide  authorization  to use and disclose  their health  information  will not be enrolled  
into the study.    Subjects  who withdraw  their authorization  to use and release  health  
information  during  study  participation  will be formally  discontinued  from the study.  The 
investigator  may use and release  at any time all the information  collected  prior to a 
subject’s  withdrawal  of the authorization  to all authorized  parties  to satisfy  scientific,  
regulatory,  and financial  concerns.  
 
5.6.2  Inclusion  and Exclusion  Criteria  
Subjects’  eligibility  to participate  in the study  will be determined  according  to the Inclusion  
and Exclusion  Criteria  during  the screening  period  (0 – [ADDRESS_152543] dose  of 
the study  drug).  Subjects  who ultimately  do not satisfy  the eligibility  criteria  except  
changing  treatments  and undergoing  a washout  period,  will not be enrolled  into the study.  
Subjects  who need  to meet  eligibility  requirements  will be asked  to make  the necessary  
changes.  Subjects  who agree  and comply  will be re-evaluated  prior to Baseline.  
 
5.6.[ADDRESS_152544]  during  screening:  date of birth,  
sex, race/  ethnic  origin, relevant  medical  and surgical  history,  including  year of diagnosis  
of plaque  psoriasis,  and current  and previous  anti-psoriasis  treatments  for the last 6 
months.  All current  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_134663].  Medical  
history  will be reviewed  and updated  at the Baseline  Visit to ensure  that the patient  
remains  eligible  to participate  in the study.  
 
5.6.4  Pregnancy  Testing  
Serum  Pregnancy  testing  (urine  β-human  chorionic  gonadotrophin  [β-HCG])  will be 
conducted  in all female  subjects,  except  those  without  childbearing  potential  at Screening  
(-30 to -1). Urine  pregnancy  tests  will be conducted  at Baseline  (prior  to first dose  of  
30August2021  PTC09  
14  
 deucravacitinib)  and at each  visit through  week  28. An interim urine  pregnancy  test may 
be performed  if there  is reason  to believe  the subject  may have  become  pregnant  during  
the study.  Subjects  with a positive  pregnancy  test will not be eligible  to participate  or to 
continue  to receive  study  treatment.  
 
A female  of childbearing  potential  is a sexually  mature  female  who 1) has not undergone  
a hysterectomy  (the surgical  removal  of the uterus)  or bilateral  oophorectomy  (the surgical  
removal  of both ovaries)  or 2) has not been  postmenopausal  for at least  24 consecutive  
months  (that is, has had menses  at any time during  the preceding  24 consecutive  
months).  The female  subject’s  chosen  form of contraception  must  be effective  by [CONTACT_134685]  (for example,  hormonal  contraception  
should  be initiated  at least  28 days  before randomization).  
 
5.6.5  Laboratory Testing  
Serum  chemistry,  hematology,  fasting  lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); 
Hepatitis C virus antibody  and HIV  and Quantiferon  Gold  testing  will be performed  at 
screening  to ensure  subject  safety  prior to baseline.  Serum  chemistry,  hematology  and 
fasting  lipi[INVESTIGATOR_134664]  16 and 28.  
 
5.6.6  Physical  Examination  
A physical  examination,  including  vital signs  measurements  (blood  pressure,  pulse  and 
temperature),  will be performed  according  to the schedule  of events.  The physical  
examination  should  include  a thorough  evaluation  of the subject's  skin. Any clinically  
significant  abnormalities  discovered  during  physical  examinations  after the Screening  / 
Baseline  visit should  be documented  and evaluated  as potential  adverse  events.  
 
5.6.7  Physician’s  Global  Assessment (PGA)  
PGA  will be determined  for all  subjects  throughout  the study.  PGA  is a 6 point  scale  that 
records  the overall  disease  severity  at each  clinical  evaluation  based  on the average  
degree  of erythema,  induration,  and scaling  of areas  affected  by [CONTACT_22803].  PGA  uses  a 
scale  of 0 = Clear,  1 = Minimal,  2 = Mild,  3 = Moderate,  4 = Severe,  and 5 = Very Severe.

6. ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
ADVERSE  EVENTS, SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS,  PREGNANCY, & PRODUCT 
QUALITY COMPLAINTS  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or 
worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant 
administered study drug and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavor able and unintended sign (such as 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational 
product.  
A NON -SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  is an AE not  classified as serious.  
The protocol must include a definition for Serious Adverse Events (SAE) . 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening (defined as an  event in which the participant was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_134665] (see NOTE  below)  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may 
require intervention [eg, medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples of such event s include, but 
are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)  
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or 
nonp athogenic) via the study drug is an SAE.  
Below is supplemental information that is included in BMS -Sponsored trials. It is the 
responsibility of the Sponsor -Investigator to determine if this information regarding 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_134666].  
− a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that 
does not result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -
30August2021  PTC09  
17  
 threatening event)  
− elective surgery, planned prior t o signing consent  
− admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
− routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health 
status (eg, routine colonoscopy)  
− Medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior 
to entry into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases.  
− Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing 
on health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of 
housing , economic inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, 
administrative reason).  
− Admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any 
other SAEs (applies to oncology protocols)  
 
NOTE : Although pregnancy and potential drug -induced  liver injury (DILI), are not 
always serious by [CONTACT_8661],  these events must be reported within the 
SAEs timeline.  
NOTE : Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to study therapy 
should be reported as an SAE (eg, death is a n endpoint, if death occurred due to 
anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported).  
 
The causal relationship  to study drug is determined by a physician and should be 
used to assess all adverse events (AE). The casual relationship can be one of the 
following:  
Related : There is a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration 
and the AE.  
Not related : There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study drug 
administration and the AE.  
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there  is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship.  
An appropriate SAE form (e.g.  ex -US = CIOMS form or [LOCATION_003] = Medwatch form) 
should be used to report SAEs to BMS.  If the Sponsor -Investigator prefers to a study 
specific/Institutional form, it must be sent to the BMS ISR Trial Manager prior to study 
initiation for internal BMS review to ensure that at a minimum all of the data elements 
on the CIOMS form are present.   
Please include the BMS Protocol number on the SAE form or on the   cover sheet with 
the SAE for m transmission.   
✓ The CIOMS form is available at: https://cioms.ch/cioms -i-form/    
✓ The MedWatch form is available at: https://www.fda.gov/safety/medical -
product -safety -information/medwatch -forms -fda-safety -reporting  
30August2021  PTC09  
18  
 NOTE : If a CIOMS I or Medwatch  form is selected for reporting, the investigator 
causal assessment must be provided in the narrative section, otherwise the BMS form 
must be used.  
NOTE : For studies with long -term follow -up period in which safety data are being 
reported, include the defin ition of end date of SAE collection.  
 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT COLLECTION AND REPORTING  
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur following the subject’s written consent 
to participate in the study through [ADDRESS_152548] be collected that relate to any follow -up protocol -specified 
procedure (eg, a follow -up skin biopsy).  
• Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, 
whether related or not related to study drug, are collected, including those 
thought to be associated with protocol -specified procedures. The Investigator 
should report any SAE occurring after these aforementioned time p eriods, which 
is believed to be related to study drug or protocol -specified procedure.  
• An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding 
its seriousness;  
• If the Investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but  is 
potentially related to the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous 
therapy or a complication of a study procedure), the relationship should be 
specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.  
 
SAEs, whether related or not rela ted to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported 
to BMS within 24 hours \ [ADDRESS_152549] 
be recorded on either CIOMS, MedWatch, or approved study specifi/institutional SAE 
form.   
 
SAE Email Address:  Worldwide. [EMAIL_2793]  
SAE Facsimile Number:  +[PHONE_3046]  
If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. ( Note : 
Follow -up SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
If an ongoing SAE chan ges in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new 
information becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours 
\ 1 Business Day to BMS using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial 
SAE report.  
All SAEs shoul d be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
NOTE : The Sponsor -Investigator must provide a single centralized e -mail address 
(not an individual’s e -mail address) to be used by [CONTACT_134687]/SAE report related 
queries. The single centralized e -mail addres s must be provided in the Study Contract 
30August2021  PTC09  
19  
 and sent to [EMAIL_177].  
 
Expedited and periodic safety update reporting by [CONTACT_20444]:  
It is the Sponsor -Investigator’s responsibility to report events to their Local HA. In 
addition, suspected serious adve rse reactions (whether expected or unexpected) shall 
be reported by [CONTACT_134688] (either as expedited and/or in aggregate 
reports).  
In accordance with local regul ations, BMS will notify Sponsor -Investigator of all 
reported SAEs that are suspected (related to the investigational product) and 
unexpected (ie, not previously described in the IB). An event meeting these criteria is 
termed a Suspected, Unexpected Serious  Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) . Sponsor -
Investigator notification of these events will be in the form of either a S[LOCATION_003]R Report or 
a Semi -Annual S[LOCATION_003]R Report. Sponsor -Investigator (or delegate) will receive these 
reports through the FastTrack portal.  
Other impor tant findings which may be reported by [CONTACT_134689] (ESR) include: increased frequency of a clinically significant expected SAE, an 
SAE considered associated with study procedures that could modify the conduct of 
the study, lack of eff icacy that poses significant hazard to study subjects, clinically 
significant safety finding from a nonclinical (eg, animal) study, important safety 
recommendations from a study data monitoring committee, or Sponsor -Investigator or 
BMS decision to end or t emporarily halt a clinical study for safety reasons.  
Upon receiving an ESR from BMS, the Sponsor -Investigator  must review and retain 
the ESR with the IB . Where required by [CONTACT_34342] a central 
IRB/IEC for the study, the Sponsor -Investigator will submit the ESR to the appropriate 
IRB/IEC. The investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires 
revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for 
reporting any other safety information.  
NON -SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT COLLECTION AND REPORTING  
The collection of non -serious AE information should begin following the subject’s 
written consent to participate in the study. All non -serious adverse events (not only 
those deemed to be treatment -related) sh ould be collected continuously during the 
treatment period and for a minimum of [ADDRESS_152550] dose of study 
treatment.  
Non-serious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs 
if they become serious. Follow -up is  also required for non -serious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study drug and for those present at the end of study 
treatment as appropriate.  
Non-serious Adverse Events (AE) are to be provided to BMS in aggregate via interim 
or final study reports as specified in the agreement or, if a regulatory requirement [eg, 
IND US trial] as part of an annual reporting requirement.   
 
 
30August2021  PTC09  
[ADDRESS_152551] will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg,  
dose tapering if necessary for participant).  
The Sponsor -Investigator must immediately notify [EMAIL_555]  of 
this event and complete one of the following forms within [ADDRESS_152552] results that constitute SAEs should be documented and 
reported to BMS as such.  
The following laboratory abnormalities should be documented and reported 
appropriately:  
• any laboratory test  result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an 
SAE 
• any laboratory abnormality that required the participant to have study drug 
discontinued or interrupted  
• any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific correc tive 
therapy.  
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be 
used by [CONTACT_9673] (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).  
 
OTHER SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS  
Any significant worsening noted during interim  or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiograms, X -rays, and any other potential safety assessments, whether or 
not these procedures are required by [CONTACT_760], should also be recorded as a non -
30August2021  PTC09  
21  
 serious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported acco rdingly.  
 
ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING FOR SPECIFIC SITUATIONS (remove if not 
applicable):  
 
➢ Assets with no marketing authorization: Potential Drug Induced Liver 
Injury (DILI)  
Definition of criteria is mandatory for all pre -marketed asset protocols  enrolling 
participants without known abnormalities in liver function at baseline AND for protocols 
involving participants with known liver abnormalities a t baseline or with other clinical 
confounders where asset specific criteria for potential drug induced liver injury have 
been defined . Use for marketed assets is optional.   
For protocols without known abnormalities in liver function at baseline, use the 
mandatory standard DILI definition listed below. Wherever possible, timely 
confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities should occur prior to the 
reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting the 
defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs.  
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as:  
1) AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)  
AND  
2) Total bilirubin >  [ADDRESS_152553], without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum 
alkaline phosphatase)  
AND  
3) No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic 
or ac ute liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be 
hepatotoxic.  
 
➢ Immune -Mediated AEs (Product Specific, Usually a regulatory 
requirement)  
Immune -Mediated AEs are required in ISR Protocols with Registrational Intent .  
Every AE must be ass essed by [CONTACT_134690] -mediated. For events which are potentially immune -mediated, additional 
information must be collected.  
 
Immune -mediated adverse events (IMAEs) are AEs consistent with an immune -
mediate d mechanism or immune -mediated component for which non -inflammatory 
etiologies (eg, infection or tumor progression) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include 
events with an alternate etiology which were exacerbated by [CONTACT_134691]. Informatio n supporting the assessment will be collected.  
30August2021  PTC09  
22  
  
➢ AEs of Interest  
ADVERSE EVENT RECONCILIATION PROCESS  
AEIs may be serious or non -serious and may require further investigation to better 
characterize and understand them. In the deucravacitinib clinical devel opment 
program, select infections (opportunistic, TB, herpes zoster) and malignancies have 
been identified as AEIs based on the mechanism of action of deucravacitinib. 
Therefore, in order to better characterize and understand these AEIs, information may 
be collected on supplemental CRFs.  Additionally, information on potential AEIs based 
on the disease or population under study may be collected on supplemental CRFs.  
The Sponsor -Investigator  (or designee) will reconcile the clinical database AE cases 
(case l evel only) transmitted to BMS Global Pharmacovigilance 
([EMAIL_555] ).  
• The Sponsor -Investigator will request the SAE reconciliation report (and include 
the BMS protocol number) from BMS GPV&E ( [EMAIL_177] ) 
every  3 months and prior to data base lock or final data summary  
• GPV&E will send the Sponsor -Investigator  the report to verify and confirm all AE 
and SAEs have been transmitted to BMS GPV&E.  
• The data elements listed on the GPV&E reconciliation report will be used for 
case identification purposes. If the Sponsor -Investigator  determines a case was 
not transmitted to BMS GPV&E, the case should be sent immediately to BMS 
([EMAIL_555] ).

8.2 Statistical Considerations  
 
It is desired  to enroll  30 patients . Since  this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_134667],  
statistical  power/sample  size is not formally  presented  in this protocol . 
The study  will analyze  data based  on the non-responder  imputation  (NRI)  method.  This 
will be performed  for each  arm of the study  (PASI  75 responders  at week  8 and PASI  25- 
74 responders  at week  8. Subjects  who do not complete  week  12 assessments  will be 
classified  as non-responders  
Analysis  will be performed  by [CONTACT_134694]  (PASI)  75 response  at week  12 
The investigator  will also analyze  PASI  25-74 at week  8, PASI,  PGA,  BSA,  PGAxBSA  
and DLQI  improvement  at week  8, BSA,  PGA  and BSA x PGA  and DLQI  improvement  at 
week  12. PASI,  BSA,  PGA,  BSA x PGA  and DLQI  at weeks  16, 20 and 24.  This 
analysis  will be done  separately  for both cohorts  (PASI  75 responders  at week  8 
and PASI 25-74 responders  at week  8) using  summary  statistics.  The Investigator  will also 
analyze  SAE’s  by [CONTACT_9084].

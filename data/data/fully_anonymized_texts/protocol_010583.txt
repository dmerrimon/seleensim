Version 2, Nov 21, [ADDRESS_463719] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_370493] a 
computer-based program (CBT4CBT), used for the treatment of substance use disorders, in a 
church setting.  Forty Black adults with a current DSM-5 alcohol or substance use disorder will 
utilize the ‘CBT for CBT’ program over a period of [ADDRESS_463720] a randomized 
controlled trial.
Specific aims are as follows:
(1) To  determine the feasibility of recruiting Black adults with substance use disorders 
(BSUD) from within the Black church and immediate surrounding community and 
retaining BSUD in treatment, within a church setting.
(2) To  evaluate the acceptability of CBT4CBT with BSUD in a church setting and to identify 
if religious behaviors led by [CONTACT_370535] (CHA), may increase 
the likely suitability of this intervention within the Black church.
(3) To  obtain qualitative data from both CHAs and BSUD about providing substance abuse 
treatment in a church setting.
(4) To  collect pi[INVESTIGATOR_370494]4CBT on substance use, recovery goals and 
level of functioning among BSUD.
2.Background:  Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. 
Provide references to support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
A. SIGNIFICANCE
A.1. Overview of Research Activities
The overall aim of this proposal is to provide Black adults with substance use disorders 
(BSUD) access to an evidence-based, web-based, cognitive behavioral therapy intervention 
(CBT4CBT) and to pi[INVESTIGATOR_370495] a church setting. Given low rates of substance abuse treatment 
initiation and engagement as well as the importance of spi[INVESTIGATOR_370496], this study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of conducting CBT4CBT in a 
Black church setting, and measure the effect of CBT4CBT on participant’s substance use, 
recovery goals and level of functioning.
A.2. BSUD suffer more negative drug-related consequences, but less likely to initiate 
treatment
Substance Use Disorders (SUD) are one of the most devastating health and social issues 
confronting this country, causing a tremendous amount of suffering for individuals, families, 
entire communities, and disproportionately affect minority communities. Black adults use 
alcohol at lower rates compared with their white counterparts (43.6% vs 57.7%), with nicotine 
and illicit drug use at the same rate, however Blacks are more likely to suffer negative drug-
related consequences, including physical ailments and higher rates of involvement in the 
criminal justice system.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_370497], Blacks are less likely to initiate substance use 
treatment when compared with other racial groups, but the reasons accounting for this difference 
are not well understood. Several theories have been cited for low treatment engagement among 
Blacks, including societal and cultural stigma associated with accessing substance use treatment,

Version 2, Nov 21, [ADDRESS_463721] for help, that is comfortable, with access to programs, with 
emphasis on God, spi[INVESTIGATOR_370498] (Figure 1 within the text to the Left).
A.3. The Role of the Black Church in promoting healthy lifestyles 
The “Black Church,” defined as the collection of seven predominately African American 
denominations of the Christian faith, including the African Methodist Epi[INVESTIGATOR_370499], the 
African Methodist Epi[INVESTIGATOR_370500], the Christian Methodist Epi[INVESTIGATOR_370499], the 
Church of God in Christ, Baptist, United Methodist Church, and Presby[CONTACT_370536], plays a 
key role in promoting healthy lifestyles. Religion and spi[INVESTIGATOR_370501] a source of help for copi[INVESTIGATOR_370502]. For many 
Black adults, God and prayer are crucial in daily life, along with church and church attendance.20 
In urban Black communities, 65% to 80% of adults attend church regularly, and 55% are 
involved in church-related activities.
The Black church holds great cultural significance in the community, as a highly relevant 
institution dedicated to health promotion. Black churches have been successfully involved in 
research studies targeting stigmatized issues such as depression among Black men, and HIV 
care. Several reports also highlight the potential role of the Black church in addressing SUD, 
where members often seek informal help from clergy. Further, a number of investigators have 
shown improvement  in functioning and decreased substance use among BSUD when standard 
treatment was coupled with religious behaviors and/or structured support from Black churches 
and the faith community.
A.4. Rationale for CBT4CBT for use the Black Church
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based psychotherapy shown to be 
effective in reducing substance use. Carroll  and colleagues have developed a web-based 
intervention called CBT4CBT, which has demonstrated efficacy as an intervention for SUD, 
both as an adjunct to standard care, as well as a stand-alone intervention with clinical monitoring. 
Secondary analyses indicated no significant differences in outcomes between Blacks and whites 
in these studies (46% of the samples), which were delivered in traditional mental 
health/substance use treatment clinics. There are few data, however, evaluating the feasibility 
and acceptability of CBT4CBT in alternate settings, such as churches, where Blacks are likely to 
congregate. We hypothesize that despi[INVESTIGATOR_370503], 
partnering with the Black church will increase BSUD participation with evidence-based 
treatments, such as CBT4CBT, by [CONTACT_370537] a comfortable environment, 
among a population in need, who might otherwise not engage in care. Data from a needs 
assessment study (manuscript in progress) supports this hypothesis, demonstrating that 56% of 
Black adults with problematic illicit drug and alcohol use reported they would be willing to 
engage in treatment within a place of worship, such as the Black church. 
A.5. Preliminary Data
Methods.  Two phases of work were conducted in the needs assessment study assessing 
the Role of the Black church in increasing access to treatment for BSUD. The first phase 
involved qualitative methods and was comprised of 2 steps. (1) Three focus groups were

Version 2, Nov 21, 2016
Page 5 of 24conducted in different  Black churches with key stakeholders in the Black community, to (a) 
identify community and cultural factors related to BSUD that might increase or decrease 
perceptions of stigma and (b) identify community/church attitudes/biases that might impact a 
BSUD likelihood of engaging with treatment. (2) We also conducted in-depth interviews 
(recently completed) with BSUD to (a) identify perceived barriers to help seeking and treatment 
engagement among BSUD, (b) explore attitudes and experiences associated with spi[INVESTIGATOR_25824], 
religion, and the Black church that might indicate a willingness to access treatment connected 
with the Black church; and (c) assess the acceptability of using a web-based intervention. The 
second phase of the study involved a quantitative approach, through the development of an 
online survey (N=205) to (a) quantify what percentage of Black adults would be willing to use a 
web-based intervention to decrease substance use, and (b) identify what population of Black 
adults are willing to engage in substance use help in the church setting. Selected data from the 
quantitative phase of this project (mobile, optimized qualtrics survey) is presented below. 
Blacks who use drugs and alcohol identify with the Christian Faith and will access help in 
the church
Demographic data obtained from survey participants, who identified as Black (N=205), 
demonstrates a predominately heteronormative (77%), Christian cohort (76%); who are likely to 
access treatment in the church setting (56%). 
Black church  viewed as a major place for help

Analysis of free text, from the quantitative survey 
among Black adults with problematic illicit drug 
and alcohol use who would access the church for 
treatment, identified the Black church as a source 
of help, which is comfortable, has access to 
programs, with emphasis on God, spi[INVESTIGATOR_370504] (Figure 1 within text to Left).  
Black adults  with drug and alcohol use are willing to engage with an online treatment
Among Black adults who use illicit drugs and have a problem with alcohol, the majority of this 
cohort indicates willingness to access online treatment (70%), making CBT4CBT a viable 
option. These findings underscore the important and dynamic role the Black church serves in the 
lives of many Black adults, including those with drug and alcohol problems. Based on 
preliminary data collected from the mixed methods needs assessment, the Black church, a 
central, trusted institution has been identified as a viable portal to improve access to and 
utilization of evidence-based treatments for substance use. 
A.6. Collaboration with Community Partners
A main priority at the start of this project is to learn from and collaborate with 
community stakeholders who are invested in improving access to and initiation of SUD 
treatment amongst BSUD in New Haven. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_370505], Reverend Frederick Streets, of Dixwell Avenue Congregational United 
Church of Christ (UCC), who has agreed to partner with the research team and allow use of the 
church, f ounded in 1820, the oldest African American Congregational UCC church in the world, 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 4/8/2019
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 4/8/2019HIC# [PHONE_7650]
Version 2, Nov 21, [ADDRESS_463722] proposed in this 
application. Specifically, Reverend Streets will identify church based health advisors (CHA) 
within the Black church and community that will be trained in CBT4CBT modules, who will 
meet together to identify religious practices, which can be coupled with each CBT4CBT module, 
to reinforce lessons taught, in each respective module. Reverend Streets will also assist with 
recruitment of research subjects from the Black church community and the immediate 
surrounding areas of Dixwell and Newhallville, two predominately Black neighborhoods within 
New Haven. Blacks comprise approximately 35% of the population in New Haven, and the 
Dixwell location where the pi[INVESTIGATOR_370506], has the 
highest Black composition in New Haven (55.4%), making this an ideal location for the project 
site.
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_370507] a YCCI Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) scholar, a 
program that teaches the tenants and methodology of CBPR research and allows investigators to 
establish and foster relationships with partners in New Haven for meaningful research 
collaboration, relevant to the needs of New Haven residents.  As a YCCI CBPR scholar, [CONTACT_370557] has presented to and formed relationships with pastors in the Cultural Ambassadors 
Program (CAP), a partnership established in 2011 between YCCI and New Haven’s Black and 
Hispanic communities, who meet once a month to discuss research and other initiatives that are 
relevant to their communities. CAP was developed to ensure Yale’s clinical research reflects the 
diversity of New Haven’s population, and directly offers benefits to the local community. These 
existing contacts and infrastructure have been utilized in the research approach by [CONTACT_370538], protection of BSUD confidentiality, and eliciting 
ideas on how the computer-based intervention can best be integrated within the Black church. 
We will continue to partner with CAP throughout all aspects of the project, including data 
collection, analysis and dissemination of findings. The integration of community ties is not 
limited to academic research but extends to social and community development.
3. Research Plan: Summarize the study design and research procedures using non-technical 
language that can be readily understood by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to 
distinguish between standard of care vs. research procedures when applicable, and include 
any flowcharts of visits specifying their individual times and lengths. 
B. METHODOLOGY
B.1.a. Recruitment of  BSUD: 
Forty Black adults, 20 male and 20 female participants, who self-identify as Black and want help 
with drug and/or alcohol problems in the church setting, will be recruited from within the church 
itself, Dixwell Avenue Congregational UCC and the two predominately Black neighborhoods in 
New Haven, CT, Dixwell and Newhallville, immediately surrounding the church. Given past 
successes with the needs assessment study, using targeted recruitment strategies, including 
culturally normative flyers disseminated by [CONTACT_370539], online and print ads in Black 
church bulletins, and culturally sensitive ads on urban radio stations, these same tools will be 
utilized to recruit the research participants for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080]. Participants will be screened by 
[CONTACT_370540]-5 Substance Use Criterion to ensure all potential participants meet 
criteria for a SUD as defined by [CONTACT_2681] 5. Inclusion criteria: (1) at least 18 years of age (2) has at 
least one SUD diagnosis as defined by [CONTACT_9288] 5 (3) self-identified with having a SUD and

homicidal ideation and (3) current engagement in substance abuse treatment. 
B.1.b. Recruitment of Church Based Health Advisors (CHAs): 
Community partner, Reverend Streets--pastor of Dixwell Avenue Congregational United Church 
of Christ, will advertise the role of the CHA (CHA description in attached documents) in the 
church bulletin, through church meetings, and by [CONTACT_370541], in order to identify church 
leaders interested in this role.  All CHAs must be a member of a Black church in the targeted 
Newhallvile/Dixwell neighborhoods, be at least [ADDRESS_463724] the ability to read and write.  It 
would be preferable, but not necessary, if a CHA had lived experience with drug and/or alcohol 
use.  12 CHAs will be recruited in total, 10 consistent leaders, and 2 alternates for 
emergency/unplanned absences.
B.2. Procedure: 
A total of 5 cohorts, each with 8 participants, will meet at Dixwell church on pre-determined 
days to take the intervention (CBT4CBT) online, simultaneously. Participants in each cohort will 
complete each online module at their own speed, but meet together on a weekly basis for a total 
of 8 sessions (8 weeks). Tablets, Wi-Fi hot spots and internet service, will be purchased for the 
church and made available to participants during the 8 weekly sessions, in addition to allocated 
times, for review of immediate session topi[INVESTIGATOR_370508] a CBT module. 
The ten church staff members, known as CHAs, will undergo the informed consent 
process to participate in the research program, along with two extensive, 8-hour training days, 
including, but not limited to, topi[INVESTIGATOR_370509]4CBT, basic research principles, 
and foundational knowledge related to addiction and drug and alcohol treatment. The CHAs, will 
then meet together to identify religious practices that can be coupled with each CBT4CBT 
module, to reinforce lessons taught in each respective module. Two CHAs will be assigned to 
each cohort, and will meet the 8 participants on a weekly basis, with a back-up CHA also 
assigned, for emergency/unplanned absences, to ensure each cohort has at least 2 CHA present. 
All religious practices will be led by [CONTACT_370542], with any spi[INVESTIGATOR_370510], to reinforce lessons from a CBT4CBT module. 
A member of the research team will also be present during all CBT4CBT sessions to 
collaborate with research participants and CHAs. Table 1, included below provides a detailed 
outline of the CBT4CBT modules and approximated spi[INVESTIGATOR_370511]. Final practices to accompany each CBT module will be pre-determined by [CONTACT_370543].

Page 8 of 24Session 8 Closing Potluck and Graduation -fellowship affirmation of completing 
program, participants will receive a completion certificate
Description of computer-based training program.
The program has the following features:
Password  protection.  Each participant will access the program through an ID/password system 
that will protect confidentiality and will be linked to an imbedded database that will track, for 
each participant, time logged onto the program, modules accessed, progress through the 
program from session to session, completion of homework assignments, progress in treatment, 
and learning of CBT principles through multiple choice tests after each module.  
User-friendliness . Given that many participants have minimal background in the use of 
personal computers, the program will be user-friendly, with extensive use of point-and-click 
features (as opposed to typed-in responses) so that no prior experience with computers or 
software is necessary.  Whenever possible, presentation of didactic material will be done 
through graphics and cartoons, videotaped examples, and audio voice-overs, thus requiring 
very little reading of text.   When text is used in presentation of material, audio voice-overs 
will accompany the text, as many participants may not be literate or become impatient or 
uncomfortable with reading large amounts of material.  CBT concepts will be presented in a 
simple, straightforward style without jargon and in a visual style that is engaging and enjoyable 
(e.g., modeled on computer learning games).  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_370514]:  The ‘CBT for CBT’ program is modeled closely on our NIDA-published CBT 
manual.  Seven core skill modules will cover the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], which correspond to the 
major session topi[INVESTIGATOR_370515]:  
oUnderstanding  and changing patterns of drug use, 
oCopi[INVESTIGATOR_370516], 
oSubstance  refusal skills, 
oSeemingly  irrelevant decisions, 
oPlanning  for emergencies, and
oProblem-solving  skills.
oStaying  Safe
Module  format.  Each of the 7 modules follows a similar format:
1. Once  the participant accesses the program and enters his/her ID and password, the 
program greets the participant, inquires about the helpfulness of the last session and the 
last session’s assignment.  This is preceded by [CONTACT_370545][INVESTIGATOR_1102] 
2. Each new  skills module is introduced through presentation of a videotaped vignette to 
heighten its relevance and applicability to the participant.  For example, the ‘copi[INVESTIGATOR_370517]’ module would start with a brief videotaped vignette showing an 
individual experiencing craving in response to a cue (e.g., seeing others use at a party), 
followed by [CONTACT_245825]/graphics asking, “What would you do?”  
3.Skills  training are done through 5 strategies:  didactic presentation, videotaped 
examples of effective copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], self-assessments of understanding, virtual role plays, and 
extra-session practice assignments.   This sequence of activities is very similar to the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_370518] (introduction of the skill topic, 
didactic instruction, practice via modeling and role-plays, assessment of the 
participant’s understanding of the material, and assignment of homework), but

instruction:   
4. Finally,  prior to log-off, participants are reminded to immediately report any concerns 
or uncomfortable feelings associated with use of the program to [CONTACT_117467], the Project 
Coordinator, or the Research Assistants.
(1) Initial Screening:
At the first interview, the research staff will provide a brief overview of the 
protocol and obtain written or verbal informed consent for both the BSUD and CHAs. 
We routinely use a multiple-choice test to assess participants’ comprehension of the 
protocol with ample time to review questions to assure understanding of the protocol, 
consent, and treatments offered. After determination of eligibility, pretreatment 
assessments will be completed (see Assessment Battery in Table 2).
(2) Intervention Phase:
The intervention will last 8 weeks. During the intervention, all participants will 
meet with a research assistant for completion of self-report, urine and breath samples 
when they come to the church.  These results will not be shared with the church or CHAs 
and are for research purposes only. 
 
Clinical  deterioration. We will closely monitor participant treatment response and 
safety in all conditions through assessment sessions. These will include breath and 
urine screens with assessment of psychiatric status. Although in our experience this is 
a very rare event in behavioral trials, participants who show significant deterioration 
(e.g., increased substance use or psychiatric symptoms that cannot be managed within 
the protocol) will be regarded as symptomatic failures, withdrawn from the study, and 
referred appropriately.
Strategies  to minimize attrition. In order to hold participant dropout to a minimum, 
we use multiple procedures to enhance adherence with alcohol and substance abuse 
treatment.  These include rapid assignment treatment days, thorough explanation of 
study treatments and requirements, close monitoring of participants’ clinical status, 
integration of the research with community and church, accessibility of study staff for 
questions and problems, and adequate compensation to participants for the time spent 
on completing assessment instruments.
(3) Post  treatment assessment
At the end of the  8-week treatment period, all participants (BSUD) will be re-
interviewed by [CONTACT_17033], who will complete post-treatment ratings (see 
Assessments, below) and by [CONTACT_978], who will complete qualitative exit interviews with 
both the BSUD and CHAs about their experience in the research project. Access to the 
CBT4CBT program will be terminated for participants after the exit interviews. 
Participants will be strongly encouraged to continue substance abuse treatment at the end 
of the study, and resources/information about local substance abuse and mental health 
clinics will be made available.

As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_370523]4CBT in a Black 
church setting, data analyses will focus on determining whether the results warrant further 
adaptation of the existing CBT4CBT program. Criteria for this will include (1) measuring 
acceptability of treatment by [CONTACT_203723] a post-intervention satisfaction survey as 
well as a qualitative exit interview, to fully assesses satisfaction with the intervention, perception 
of outcome, attitudes about spi[INVESTIGATOR_370524], and whether the 
participant would recommend this program to a friend. (2) Feasibility will be measured by [CONTACT_12697] 2/3 of participants (N=27) completing the CBT4CBT intervention. Secondary analyses will 
include significant reductions in drug use, as measured by [CONTACT_370546], and functioning over the course of treatment intervention.  The 
proposed sample size (n=40) is adequate to detect this effect.

SECTION IX: PROTECTION OF R ESEARCH SUBJECTS
1.Risks:  Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to subject privacy, discomforts, 
or inconveniences associated with subjects participating in the research. 
Psychological risks are minimal and not different from those of equivalent non-study
psychotherapeutic interventions. 
Computer-based interventions have been used safely in multiple investigations with a range of 
populations, and we are unaware of any reported risks associated with these interventions.
The data collected from interviews and self-report forms, as well as urine and breath collection, 
carry minimal risk. Since the project is taking place in a church setting, there is the possible risk 
of loss of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to keep information confidential; however, this 
cannot be guaranteed. Further, only the research team will have access to the results of the 
drug and alcohol tests.  The church based health advisors will not see this information.
2.Minimizing  Risks:  Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be minimized. 
The Project Coordinator will supervise the participants’ use and understanding of the program 
closely, and research staff will be available to monitor participants’ reactions to the program and 
to answer any clinical issues.  
The web-based intervention is highly secure (annual Security Design Review by [CONTACT_370550]). The program does not collect any PHI or specific 
information regarding recent drug use or illegal activities.
3. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan: Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
(DSMP) based on the investigator’s risk assessment stated below. (Note: the HIC will make the 
final determination of the risk to subjects.) For more information, see the Instructions, page 24.

i. How  will adverse events and unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or 
others be reported, reviewed and managed?
ii. What  provisions are in place for management of interim results?
iii. What  will the multi-site process be for protocol modifications?
Overall level of risk for participants is minimal given the nature of this project and 
procedures in place for careful identification of potential subjects, informed consent process, and 
protection of confidentiality.  We have used the CBT4CBT program successfully and safely in 
multiple previous trials {Carroll, 2008 #[ZIP_CODE]; Carroll, 2009 #[ZIP_CODE];Carroll, 2014 #[ZIP_CODE]}.
 A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor this project because this 
population might be considered vulnerable due to their substance use. This board is already in 
place for the Yale Psychotherapy Development Center (Carroll, Faculty Advisor). The DSMB is 
composed of Yale investigators who are independent of the proposed trial and experienced in 
various aspects of the conduct of clinical trials for the treatment of addictive disorders. We have 
developed a standard DSMB report form that is used in all Center related trials that summarizes, 
on a quarterly basis:
1. Recruitment, retention, and follow-up rates for the study and compares them to target rates.
2. Rates of data completeness and availability of primary outcome data.
3. Occurrence of AEs and SAEs.
4. Report of study progress since the last report.
5. Rates of recruitment of women, minorities, and children with respect to targets.
These reports are generated by [CONTACT_370551] [INVESTIGATOR_370526]. DSMB comments are documented and forwarded to 
the Yale IRB at the time of the annual review and re-approval.  
Because the projected effect sizes may not be large enough for detection during interim 
analyses, we are not proposing a preliminary analysis of accumulating efficacy and safety data 
by [CONTACT_3148]. Instead, we propose to submit a quarterly report of aggregate data to the DSMB 
members that contains screening data, baseline demographics, retention data, serious adverse 
events data, as well as accrual status including projections, times to milestones, and any other 
data that will help in the assessment of the clinical trial. Based on this report, each DSMB 
member will complete a form making one of two recommendations: 1) continue recruitment as 
planned; or 2) schedule formal DSMB meeting immediately. If any DSMB member recommends 
a meeting, this will be scheduled within one week, minutes will be kept, the report will be 
reviewed with the PI, and the committee will vote on whether the study should: 1) continue 
recruitment unchanged; 2) continue with a protocol amendment; 3) stop recruiting pending 
further investigation. If, after this meeting, any DSMB member votes to stop recruitment or 
requests a protocol modification, the Yale IRB will be informed.

Version 2, Nov 21, [ADDRESS_463736] SAEs will result in inpatient care and thus in transfer to the inpatient division of 
CMHC or YNHH.  All SAEs will result in the completion of an SAE Form and a verbal report 
within one hour to the Principal Investigator ([CONTACT_117467]).  Within 24 hours, the following 
additional individuals will be informed: 1) All co-investigators; and 2) the DSMB. Adverse 
events that are serious and unanticipated and probably, possibly, or definitely related or adverse 
events occurring with greater frequency than anticipated will be reported to the Yale Human 
Investigation Committee within 5 days of discovery.  The procedures for SAE reporting include 
written documentation using the clinical notes related to the adverse event and specific forms 
detailing the event with a sign-off by [CONTACT_370552].  Communication of 
recommendations and decisions from all parties (DSMB, Yale Human Investigations Committee, 
and CMHC Administration) are made back to the investigator in a timely manner. We will report 
all protocol amendments or changes in the informed consent form to NIDA as well as any 
temporary or permanent suspension of patient accrual.
4.    Confidentiality & Security of Data:
a.    What  protected health information (medical information along with the HIPAA identifiers) 
about subjects will be collected and used for the research?   
PHI that will be collected includes names, addresses, phone numbers, and email 
addresses for locator purposes. 
Our study assessments/forms have been designed to avoid collecting identifiable 
information (e.g., no PHI identifiers are collected on CRFs). The only dates collected are 
protocol session dates. These are changed to ‘number of sessions completed’ when data sets are 
anonymized and released to other investigators.
b.    How will the research data be collected, recorded and stored?
Research data  are collected on CRFs and in Qualtrics, and sent to data managers in our 
research offices on a closed secure network.  All computers used by [CONTACT_370553].  No identifying information is on CRFs.  Only authorized individuals will have access 
to CRFs.
c.    How will the digital data be stored?  CD   DVD   Flash Drive   Portable Hard   
       Drive   Secured Server   Laptop Computer   Desktop Computer   Other
d.    What methods and procedures will be used to safeguard the confidentiality and security of    
the identifiable  study data and the storage media indicated above during and after the subject’s 
participation in the study?
Do all portable devices contain encryption software?  Yes    No
         If no, see http://hipaa.yale.edu/guidance/policy.html
 Confidentiality  in regards to collected materials will be maintained via a numbered 
reference system maintained by [CONTACT_211224].  Participants’ names will appear only on 
the consent form, and “key” form kept by [CONTACT_211224]. The key form linking subject 
names to ID codes will be stored in a separate, locked file cabinet.  Data are stored at our secure 
data management center; data sets do not include identifying information.
In addition,  we have designed all of our CBT4CBT websites such that no sensitive 
information (i.e., information on illegal behavior) or PHI is collected or stored by [CONTACT_198910] 
(including IP address).  Moreover, to avoid participants inadvertently revealing sensitive

Page 19 of 24information, the website  does not use any ‘blank fills’, and the program shuts down after 10 
minutes of inactivity.
e. What  will be done with the data when the research is completed? Are there plans to destroy     
the identifiable data? If yes, describe how, by [CONTACT_22467]. If 
no, describe how the data and/or identifiers will be secured.
Paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_370527].  Source files with subject names will be stored in the regulatory 
coordinator's office separately under triple lock (building entry, office entry, separate locked file 
cabinet designated for name [CONTACT_370556]).  The paper log linking subject names to ID codes will be 
stored in a separate, locked file in the regulatory coordinator's office.  The link to the subjects 
personal information will be kept for the [ADDRESS_463737] retention period, data will be destroyed in accordance with Yale ITS policies 
1609 and 1609PR.01. Source data are generally destroyed 3 years after completion of the study 
at a secure location (Iron Mountain) or by [CONTACT_370554]-It.
f.   Who  will have access to the protected health information (such as the research sponsor, the  
investigator, the research staff, all research monitors, FDA, QUACS, SSC, etc.)? (please 
distinguish between PHI and de-identified data) 
The Yale PI [INVESTIGATOR_370528].  The funding 
agency, NIDA, may access the data for routine audits.
g.   If appropriate, has a Certificate of Confidentiality been obtained?
Obtained
h.   Are  any of the study procedures likely to yield information subject to mandatory reporting   
requirements? (e.g. HIV testing – reporting of communicable diseases; parent interview -incidents 
of child abuse, elderly abuse, etc.). Please verify to whom such instances will need to be reported. 
Limits to confidentiality include only disclosure of acute suicidality, homicidality, or 
abuse of a minor/elder, as is standard in clinical practice and indicated in the consent form.  
When there is reasonable cause to suspect or believe there is a case of child abuse or elder abuse, 
a report will be made to the CT Department of Children and Families (DCF) or CT Department 
of Social Services (DSS), Protective Services for the Elderly (PSE).  Designated clinic personnel 
will be notified as per clinic policies.

Potential Benefits: Identify any benefits that may be reasonably expected to result from the 
research, either to the subject(s) or to society at large. (Payment of subjects is not considered a 
benefit in this context of the risk benefit assessment.) 
The major potential benefit in this study is in reduction of substance use via the study 
treatments and affirmation of self-identity and spi[INVESTIGATOR_25824], which may, in turn, foster 
improvement in participants’ legal, medical, interpersonal, psychological and occupational 
functioning.

1.     Alternatives: What other alternatives are available to the study subjects outside of the research?
Individuals who do not wish to participate or who are ineligible for the trial will be given 
information about substance abuse clinics and mental health centers in the area.
2. Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe any payments that will be 
made to subjects, the amount and schedule of payments, and the conditions for receiving this 
compensation. 
 
BSUD subjects will be compensated for time required to complete screening assessments at $20, 
baseline assessment at $20, week 4 assessments at $10, study assessments at $10 for each weekly 
module time point; $50 for completing all modules, and $[ADDRESS_463738]-treatment for a possible total 
of $230. 
CHA subjects will be paid $14.[ADDRESS_463739], over an 8-12 week time period, for a total of $1,225.50 paid by [CONTACT_9434].
3. Costs  for Participation (Economic Considerations): Clearly describe the subject’s costs 
associated with participation in the research, and the interventions or procedures of the study that 
will be provided at no cost to subjects.     
There will be no costs to subjects associated with participation in this study.   Subjects 
will not be charged for study treatments or evaluations they receive at the clinic. 
4. In  Case of Injury: This section is required for any research involving more than minimal risk.
a.     Will medical treatment be available if research-related injury occurs? 
b.     Where and from whom may treatment be obtained? 
c.     Are there any limits to the treatment being provided? 
d.     Who will pay for this treatment? 
e.     How will the medical treatment be accessed by [CONTACT_1766]? 
Because we are evaluating standard behavioral approaches with strong empi[INVESTIGATOR_370529], study related injuries are expected to be extremely rare.  
There will be no compensation and/or medical treatment available if injury occurs. Participants 
or their insurance carrier will be expected to cover costs of any medical treatment.

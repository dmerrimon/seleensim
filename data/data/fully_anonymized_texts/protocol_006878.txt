Randomized Controlled Trial of a Sleep Study + Targeted CPAP Therapy for Obstructive Sleep Apnea to Reduce the Incidence of Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  12 February 2016 (IRB Approval Date) Research Design and Methodology A prospective, randomized, parallel group, clinical trial design was used. The treatment group was randomized to receive an unattended WatchPAT-[ZIP_CODE] sleep study in early (6-16wks), late pregnancy (27-33wks), and at 3 months postpartum (between 8 and 12 weeks postpartum). Subjects with an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥5 were referred to a sleep medicine physician at Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) for evaluation, education on OSA, and possible initiation of continuous positive airway pressure (auto-titrated CPAP). Subjects randomized to the control group received usual standard prenatal care. Control group subjects completed an unattended sleep study at [ADDRESS_844105] one of the following risk factors for OSA: pre-pregnancy BMI ≥ 30kg/m2, chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes, twin gestation, or a history of prior pregnancy affected by: [CONTACT_264207], eclampsia or fetal growth restriction. Between 6- and 16-weeks gestation at time of enrollment. Subjects were excluded if they had a current diagnosis and treatment of OSA, refused to be randomized, had a permanent pacemaker (interfere with WATCHPAT sleep study), were currently taking alpha blockers or nitrates (interfere with WATCHPAT sleep study), had coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure or cardiomyopathy, not delivering and completing their postpartum visit at NMCSD, inability to read or understand the consent, and <[ADDRESS_844106] medical, obstetrical, and surgical history, and snoring frequency. Subjects in the control group received usual prenatal care and at 3 months postpartum they completed an unattended Watch-PAT-200 sleep study.  Subjects in the treatment group completed an OSA pregnancy screening questionnaire at each time point. The questionnaire collects information on general work and sleep patterns, sleep habits, snoring and sleep apnea symptoms, and STOP-BANG score.19,20 A research coordinator drove to the patient’s home to set-up the unattended sleep study at each time point with the Watch-PAT-[ADDRESS_844107] and analyzed with the WatchPat zzzPAT proprietary software which automatically scored the results. If there was a technical error with the sleep study the research coordinator attempted to reschedule completion of the sleep study. The Watch-PAT-200 is an FDA-approved portable diagnostic device (6 channels: peripheral artery tone, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, actigraphy [to calculate sleep stages], body position, & snoring) used for screening, detection, and the follow-up treatment of OSA. It uses peripheral artery tonometry (PAT) finger plethysmography and standard oxygen saturation (SPO2) probe, which allows for recording of the PAT signal, heart rate, and SPO2. Sleep time is estimated with 
actigraphy. Specific data obtained included: sleep stages, pRDI, pAHI, pODI (peripheral artery tonometry respi[INVESTIGATOR_285556] [pRDI], apnea hypopnea index [pAHI], and oxygen desaturation index [pODI]), mean and lowest oxygen saturation, percent sleep time with SPO2 <90%, <88%, <85%, <80%, and <70%, percent rapid eye movement of sleep time (% of sleep in REM), and the mean, minimum, and maximum heart rate. Subjects with an AHI ≥[ADDRESS_844108] and coordinated delivery and set-up of the CPAP device. Devices used were the AirSense 10 AutoSet with auto-titrated pressure ranging from 5 to 15 cm H2O. CPAP compliance data was obtained from the durable medical equipment contractor. CPAP compliance defined as >4 hours/night for 70% of nights. The primary outcome was the difference in APOs between the two groups. After delivery the research coordinator reviewed the medical records and recorded the rate of individual and composite APOs in both groups (defined as a composite variable which included gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, low birth weight, or stillbirth). Results were confirmed with a co-investigator who was a Maternal Fetal Medicine Obstetrician. Secondarily, we examined the rate and trends in OSA in early and late pregnancy, and at 3 months postpartum (between 8 and 12 weeks), and differences in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_632216]. An exploratory aim was to compare differences in APOs between subjects at high risk for OSA started on CPAP therapy in either early or late pregnancy. Upon completion of the 3-month postpartum sleep study subjects were given a $[ADDRESS_844109].  Statistical Analysis. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the results. A Fisher’s Exact test was used to compare differences in APOs between the treatment and control group. If significant differences are found in APOs a multiple logistic regression control for significant covariates and CPAP usage. Because sleep study results were not normally distributed a Friedman’s test was used to analyze differences in sleep study results at the three time points. If significant differences are found in sleep study results a post hoc Wilcoxon Ranked Sign test will be used to compare differences at individual time points. Differences in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_632217] a t-test. A P <.[ADDRESS_844110] of CPAP on APOs. We estimate dthat initiation of CPAP in the treatment group will reduce their risk of APOs by 20%. Using G*Power [IP_ADDRESS] and a one-sided Fisher’s exact test with an alpha of 0.05 and power of 80%, and a 2 to 1 allocation of control: treatment group, we would need 55 subjects in the treatment group and 110 in the control group (N = 165). Over a 36-month data collection period we originally estimated we could enroll up to 30 subjects per quarter for a total of N = 360 by [CONTACT_632219] (N = 180 in each group). Subjects will be randomized to one of the two groups in a 1:1 ratio. Assuming 30% of subjects in the treatment group require CPAP initiation during their pregnancy this will give us at approximately N = 55 subjects who received CPAP during pregnancy and up to N = 180 control subjects. These 
enrollment estimates thus meet our sample size calculation and approximate 2:[ADDRESS_844111] Mosquera.

We estimated that we could enroll between 11-14 patients per month which would give us an estimated sample size at the end of active recruitment of N = 252 to 288 subjects (126 to 144 per group). If we assume 25% in the treatment group have OSA, then we estimate we will have 32 to 36 subjects in the treatment group who will require CPAP therapy, meeting our target sample size.

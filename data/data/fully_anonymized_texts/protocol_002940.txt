INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE : 
Patients with cancer often experience physical and emotional distress, utilize unplanned acute 
care, and undergo medical interventions that are discordant with their wishes.1–6 Given the COVID -19 
pandemic, these adverse outcomes are amplified, particularly for  racial/ethnic  minorities . Serious 
illness conversations (SICs) tha t elicit patients’ values, goals, and care preferences, particularly early 
in the disease trajectory, are an evidence -based practice, improve patient mood and quality of life,7–12 
and are recommended by [CONTACT_145496].13–[ADDRESS_827255] patients with advanced cancer die without a 
documented SIC and there are well -documented health disparities in implementation for racial and 
ethnic minorit ies.16–[ADDRESS_827256] of behavioral nudges on Serious Illness Conversations  
Version 9: 8-08-2022 Page 2 
 While core elements of this program are transferable —such as its structured guide —clinical use 
remains low. For example, even after training, clinicians at Penn Medicine document SICs f or fewer 
than 5% of patients with advanced cancer.[ADDRESS_827257] choices are framed, behavioral nudges can lead to desirable changes in clinician 
behavior while preserving clinician choice.22–25 Our preliminary work demonstrates the effectiveness of 
an imple mentation strategy focusing on a clinician nudge, consisting of performance feedback and 
targeted text messages identifying patients at high risk of mortality based on a validated machine 
learning prognostic algorithm.26 This strategy led to a threefold increase in SIC documentation for 
high-risk patients , equitably across racial/ethnic minority subgroups,  and is now in routine use across 
Penn  Medicine practice sites. However, clinicians still did not document SICs for over half of patients, 
illustrating the limitations of a clinician -directed implementation strategy alone.[ADDRESS_827258] behavioral economics -informed multilevel implementation strategi es to prompt 
clinicians and patients to engage in early SICs. This study  will expand on these preliminary findings to 
evaluate the synergy between clinician - and patient -directed nudges to increase SIC documentation.  
 
OBJECTIVES : 
 
Aim 1: Conduct a pragmatic four -arm randomized controlled trial  to test the effectiveness  of nudges to 
clinicians, nudges to patients, or nudges to both  in increasing the frequency  and timeliness  of SIC 
documentation, compared  to usual practice.  
 
1. Primary objectiv e: 
Test the effect of nudges to clinicians, nudges to patients, or nudges to both, compared to 
usual practice, on SIC documentation, among high-risk patients . 
 
2. Secondary  objectives : 
Test the effect of nudges to clinicians, nudges to patients, or nudges to both, compared to 
usual practice, on the following secondary outcomes:  
a) SIC docume ntation, among all patients  
b) Palliative c are referral, among high -risk patients  
c) Aggressive end -of-life care ( any of the following three criteria: chemotherapy within 14 
days before death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21342] 30 days before death, or admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125] 
3 days or less before death ), among high -risk patients  who die  
 
Aim 2: Conduct a quantitative evaluation using secondary data (obtained via EMR  and census , for 
patients, and by [CONTACT_154700], for clinicians) to identify moderators of implementation effects on SIC 
documentation . [Note: the clinician survey will be conducted within a separate study funded by [CONTACT_621433] a separate protocol; data across the studies will be 
linked by [CONTACT_621434].]  
 
1. Primary objective:  
Evaluate for heterogeneity of implementation effects on SIC documentation by [CONTACT_545]/ethnicity, 
income, and geographic location  as well as by [CONTACT_621435] . 
 
Aim 3 : Perform a mixed methods qualitative/quantitative analysis of secondary patient -reported data 
from the SIC priming questionnaire, among patients randomized to the patient nudge arm.  
 
BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE : 
Serious illness conversations (SICs) that elicit patients’ values, goals, and care preferences, 
particularly early in the disease trajectory, are an evidence -based practice, improve patient mood and 
Effect of behavioral nudges on Serious Illness Conversations  
Version 9: 8-08-2022 Page 3 
 quality of life,7–12 and are recommended by [CONTACT_145496].13–[ADDRESS_827259] patients with 
advanced cancer die  without a documented SIC and there are well -documented health disparities in 
implementation for racial and ethnic minorit ies.16–21 Clinician barriers to initiating SICs include 
optimism bias, or the belief that one’s  own patient is unlikely to experience a negative event; 
uncertainty about prognosis and appropriate timing; and fear that bringing up end -of-life issues may 
be distressin g to patients.26,[ADDRESS_827260] likely to benefit from SICs. Moreover, t hat individuals desire to conform to an approved 
behavior (an in junctive norm) and the behavior of others (a descriptive norm) may contribute to low 
observed SIC rates, and may also  afford  an opportunity for intervention.  We expect that periodically 
reminding clinicians  of their own  performance on SIC documentation , while providing both  an 
injunctive norm (citing national and institutional guidelines) and a descriptive social norm (displaying 
the behavior of the ir best performing peers) , will lead clinicians  to conform more closely to these 
norms , as has been shown in  studies conducted in other contexts.23,30,31 
Rationale for patient nudge  using priming . Priming is a type of nudge that frames information 
to activate one’s self-efficacy and willingness to engage in  behavior change .[ADDRESS_827261] of a patient nudge designed to prime  patients and, in turn, their clinicians to having a 
SIC.  
 
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STUDY POPULATION : 
  
1. Target Population  and Accrual : 
The target population  includes approximately 5,500 high-risk patients with cancer 
cared for by [CONTACT_3450] 166 medical and gynecologic oncology clinicians at the following 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_621425]-standing community practice  sites of the Penn Medicine Abramson Canc er 
Center (ACC) , referred to hereafter as the “Implementation Laboratory” : Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71972] (HUP), Pennsylvania Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (PAH), Penn Presby[CONTACT_427343] (PPMC), Chester County Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (CCH), Valley Forge Medical Center, R adnor 
Medical Center, Cherry Hill Medical Center, Voorhees Medical Center, Sewell Medical Center 
and Regional Hematology Oncology Associates . The trial will be conducted pragmatically, and 
patients will accrue as they are seen in follow -up at a participati ng practice site by [CONTACT_621436].  
 
2. Key Eligibility Criteria : 
Key inclusion criteria  
Eligible clinicians (M.D., P.A., or N.P.) must meet the following criteria:  
• Provide care at least 1 clinic session per week for adult (age  >18 years) patients with 
solid, hematologic, or gynecologic malignancies at a participating PennMedicine 
Implementation Lab site 
Eligible patients must meet the following criteria:  
• Receive care  for a solid, hematologic, or gynecologic malignancy from an el igible 
provider at a participating PennMedicine Implementation Lab site  
• Have at least one scheduled Return Patient Visit (either in person or via telemedicine) 
with an eligible PennMedicine provider during the study period

Version 9: 8-08-2022 Page 4 
 Key exclusion criteria  
Clinicians will be ineligible for ANY of the following reasons:  
• Provide exclusively benign hematology, leukemia or bone marrow transplant, 
survivorship, or genetics care   
Patients will be ineligible for ANY of the following reasons:  
• Previously documented SIC within 6 months  
• Have a non -valid phone number  
 
3. Subject Recruitment and Screening : 
Given the pragmatic nature of this study, assessing the impact of implementation 
strategies delivered to clinicians and patients through adjustments to existing clinical workflow s 
using  the electronic medical record and other existing patient communication tools , we are 
requesting a waiver of informed consent . There are several reasons to justify this request. 
First, it is not feasible to consent every patient and clinician  randomized to nudges . Second, if 
members of the control group were consented, they would know they were being studied and this 
could affect  their beha vior, thereby [CONTACT_621437]. 
Third, none of the nudges being tested forces behavior change. Clinicians  randomized to receive 
a nudge are made aware of the ir high -risk patients and their performance compare d to peers . 
Patients randomized to receive a nudge wil l have the option to complete an electronic 
questionn aire that may prime them for a SIC. Neither  clinicians nor patients will be coerced or 
forced to engage in SICs; rather , the goal of nudges is to make standard evidence -based 
practices easier to conduct. Finally, as part of a previous quality improvement initiative, we 
interviewed [ADDRESS_827262] of care for patients 
with cancer.   
 
4. Early Withdrawal of Subjects : 
We are requesting a waiver of informed consent, so the option to withdraw early from this study is 
not applicable.  
 
5. Vulnerable Populations :  
Children, pregnant women, fetuses, neonates, or prisoners are not being targeted  in this research 
study . 
 
6. Populations vulnerable to undue influence or coercion : 
We will not be targeting participants who are likely to be vulnerable to undue influence or coercion . 
 
STUDY DESIGN : 
 
1. Study design:  
We will conduct a pragmatic four -arm randomized  controlled  trial to test the effectiveness of 
nudges to clinicians, nudges to patients, or nudges to both in promoting SIC documentation , 
compared to usual practice. We will independently randomize eligible clinicians and patients using 
a 2x2 factorial design. Clini cians will be randomized to receive a nudge consisting of  targeted text 
messages identifying patients at high risk of  predicted  6-month mortality based on a validated 
machine learning prognostic algorithm  and performance  feedback  compared to peers (“ clinic ian 
peer comparison”), versus usual practice. Patients will be randomized to receive a n udge 
consisting of a normalizing message prompting patients to complete an electronic questionnaire 
designed to prime patients towards having an SIC  (“patient priming”) , versus usual practice . This 
design will thus lead to four independent study groups: (1)  nudge to both clinici an and patient, (2) 
nudge  to clinician  only, (3)  nudge to  patient only , and (4)  usual practice , as depi[INVESTIGATOR_48393].

2. Study Duration:  
The study duration will be approximately 6 months per participant, defined  by [CONTACT_621438] (marking the beginning of the nudge exposure period) and followed by a 6 -
month follow -up period over which outcomes will be ascertained. We will employ rapid cycle 
approaches (RCA) prior to clinical trial enrollment to optimize implementation strategies.  
 
METHODS : 
 
1. Study Instruments : 
Any study instruments will be submitted to the IRB as a modification prior to use.  
 
2. Administration of Surveys and/or Process :  
Any surveys will be submitted to the IRB as a modification prior to use.  
 
3.  Data Management : 
To minimize the risk of breach of data and confidentiality, we will use secure, encrypted servers to 
host the data and conduct the analysis. The Penn Medicine Academic Computing Services 
(PMACS) will be the hub for the hardware and database infrastructure that will support the project. 
The PMACS is a joint effort of the University of Pennsylvania's Abramson Cancer Center, the 
Cardiovascular Institute, the Department of Pathology, and the Leonard Davis Institu te. The 
PMACS provides a secure computing environment for a large volume of highly sensitive data, 
including clinical, genetic, socioeconomic, and financial information. PMACS requires all users of 
data or applications on PMACS servers to complete a PMACS -hosted cybersecurity awareness 
course annually, which stresses federal data security policies under data use agreements with the 
university. The curriculum includes Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
training and covers secure data  transfer, passwords, computer security habits and knowledge of 
what constitutes misuse or inappropriate use of the server. We will implement multiple, redundant 
protective measures to guarantee the privacy and security of the participant data. All investi gators 
and research staff with direct access to the identifiable data will be required to undergo annual 
responsible conduct of research, cybersecurity, and HIPAA certification in accordance with 
University of Pennsylvania regulations. Data will be stored,  managed, and analyzed on a secure, 
encrypted server behind the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) firewall. All study 
personnel that will use this data are listed on the IRB application and have completed training in 
HIPAA standards and the C ITI human subjects research. Data access will be password protected. 
Whenever possible, data will be deidentified for analysis.

STUDY PROCEDURES : 
 
1. Detailed Description : 
Eligible clinicians and patients will be identified using the criteria listed above , and will be 
independently randomize d to study arms using a 2x2 factorial design. Eligible clinicians will be 
rando mized at the start of the study  and will receive nudges identifying their high -risk patients with 
or without peer comparisons for the duration of  the study period. Eligible patients will be 
randomized in advance of an index outpatient clinical encounter , and will accrue to the study 
accordingly. Patients will be exposed to implementation strategies based on their assigned study 
arm, which will depend on their own randomization and that of their clinician (determined at the 
time of the index  outpatient cl inical encounter ). Physicians will be mapped to advanced 
practitioners (i.e. physician assistants, nurse practitioners) with whom they work, and vice versa, 
and this cluster will serve as the clinician unit of analysis and thus will be cluster randomized.  
 
Nudge  to clinician  only. The clinician nudge will consist of targeted text messages identifying 
patients at high risk of  predicted  6-month mortality based on a validated machine learning 
prognostic algorithm ,33,34 as well as  SIC documentation performance feedback graphically 
compared to peers (“clinician peer comparison”).  The clinician nudge will be deliver ed weekly via 
email with  text messages sent on the morning(s) before clinic sessions. See Appendix 1. Sample 
Prov ider Nudge for the content of provider nudge email  and text . 
 
Nudge to patient only . The patient nudge will consist of a normalizing message prompting patients 
to complete an electronic questionnaire designed to prime patients towards ha ving a SIC (“patient 
priming”). The nudge will be delivered via text message and email in advance of the index clinical 
encounter, and will be re -sent a maximum of two times at monthly intervals only for those patients 
who neither fill out the priming ques tionnaire nor have a documented SIC during follow -up. 
Patient -reported data from the priming questionnaire will be shared with clinical teams in real -time. 
See Appendix 2. Sample Patient Nudge for the content of patient nudge  texts, email, and  
electronic q uestionnaire.  
 
Nudges to both clinician  and patient . Both strategies described above will be used.  
 
Usual practice . Usual practice will consist of  targeted text messages identifying patients at high 
risk of mortality based on a validated machine learning prognostic algorithm , as well as clinician -
directed performance feedback  (WITHOUT peer comparison) , thereby [CONTACT_621439]. 
 
We w ill use RCA to optimize implementation strategies to ensure face validity and maximum 
effect. We will focus on optimizing content, messaging, and design. RCA procedures will involve 
design meetings  with study team , discussions with administrators and clini cians who are members 
of our Implementation Lab, as well as pi[INVESTIGATOR_621426].   
 
2. Data Collection : 
The electronic medical record and other Penn Medicine secondary databases will be used to 
collect information on practices, clinicians, and patients. These systems collect this information as 
part of routine clinical care. We will also collect data from the U.S. C ensus via publicly ava ilable 
datasets.  
 
Aim [ADDRESS_827264] of behavioral nudges on Serious Illness Conversations  
Version 9: 8-08-[ADDRESS_827265] has an Advanced Care Planning 
(ACP) section in which ACP notes are documented. Any note documented in this section will be 
classified as an ACP , and only t he subset of notes that include a preformatted SIC template will be 
classified a s a SIC.  
 
The secondary outcomes  will each be measured at the patient level as a binary outcome, 
ascertained over the 6 -month period following the index outpatient clinical encounter : 
• SIC documentation, among all patients  
• Palliative care referral, among high-risk patients  
• Aggressive end -of-life care ( any of the following three criteria: chemotherapy within 14 
days before death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21342] 30 days before death, or admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125] 3 
days or less before death ), among high -risk patients  who d ie 
 
Aim [ADDRESS_827266]  and using publically available 
U.S. Census  data, will include:  
• Patient -level data : age, sex, race/ethnicity, cancer type, cancer stage , health insura nce 
(e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, c ommercial);  
• Clinician -level data : years in practice and patient panel size;  
• Practice -level data : setting (community vs. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based), urban vs. non -urban location, 
and health insurance mix;  
• Ecologic -level data  linked at the patient - and pr actice -level, including median income and 
educational attainment.  
 
Aim [ADDRESS_827267] of patient -reported content obtained during the 
course of the study in response to the SIC priming questionnaire, among 1,166 participa nts 
randomized to the patient nudge study arm who completed the SIC priming questionnaire 
(Appendix 2).

Not applicable  
 
4. Use of Deception:  
Not applicable  
 
5. Statistical Analysis : 
 
Aim [ADDRESS_827268] errors to account for clustering by [CONTACT_68566]. SIC 
documentation, as defined above, will serve as the primary event outcome. Da ys between  the 
index clinical encounter  (at which the nudge exposure period begins)  and SIC documentation will 
serve as the time variable . The design is a 2x2 factorial, which breaks down into 4 study arms 
(defined by [CONTACT_621440]): nudge to 
clinician only, nudge to patient only, nudge to both, or usual practice . Cox regression will estimate 
hazard ratios for the main effects (Aim 1) and a ratio of hazard ratios for the interaction term (Aim 
2).  Significance will be determined using the z -score corresponding to each of the estimated 
effects, using a two sided type 1 error of 5%.  All enrolled  patients will be  included in the intention -
to-treat analysis, and subjects will be censored at the time of last follow -up or death , should they 
Effect of behavioral nudges on Serious Illness Conversations  
Version 9: 8-08-[ADDRESS_827269] a documented SIC during the follow -up period. Covariates will be 
assessed across s tudy arms and included in the Cox model if unbalanced across arms.   
 
We will use our fitted Cox model to generate predicted probabilities of SIC documentation within 6 
months, via marginal standardization , as well as median time to documented SIC  across arms. 
The functional form of the model will be checked using cumulative  martingale residuals, and the 
proportional hazards assumption will be checked using scaled Schoenfeld residuals.   
 
The secondary out comes will be similarly modeled. All hypothesis tests will use a two -sided alpha 
of 0.0 5 as the thresho ld for statistical s ignificance.  
 
Aim 2  
We will evaluate for heterogeneity of implementation effects on SIC documentation by [CONTACT_155381], separately, patient factors, such as race/ethnicity, 
income, and geographic location; clinician fa ctors; and inner setting factors . Evidence for effect 
modification will be judged based on the z-score corresponding to the ratio of hazard ratios 
(interaction term ) using again a two -sided alpha of 0.0 5 as the thresho ld for statistical significance.  
 
Aim 3  
We will perform a mixed methods qualitative/quantitative analysis of 1,[ADDRESS_827270] independent coder to resolve 
discrepancies. Kappa statistics will be generated to esti mate inter -rater reliability. The iterative 
coding process will continue until all coding is complete with a Kappa score greater than or equal 
to 0.80. NVivo qualitative software will be used for codebook generation, data management, and 
to pull qualitativ e data points as needed for analysis.  
 
Participant responses to the SIC priming questionnaire will be described quantitatively (questions 
1 and 3) or qualitatively (question 2). For the latter, representative quotes will be selected to 
illustrate the key t hemes that emerge from qualitative coding. We will evaluate for associations 
between participant responses and patient, clinician and inner setting factors.  
 
Power and Sample Size  
We are seeking  to detect the main effects  of nudges  and their interaction wi th at least 80% power 
using a two -sided alpha  of 0.05. We anticipate enrolling  [ADDRESS_827271] (Power)

RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT : 
 
1. Risks :  
There are minimal risks to participants in this trial. There is a risk of breach of data and 
confidentiality, however we described the precautions in place to securely manage this data in the 
Data Management section of this protocol.  As noted above, substantial data demonstrates that 
ACPs improve patient goal -concordant care without any identified harms (despi[INVESTIGATOR_621427], the opposite has been fo und), so the negative impact 
on patients is minimal.  
 
The provider data that will be shared with providers is already shared in one form (in the case of 
SIC rates ), so the trial does not expos e providers to additional risk.  
 
2. Benefits : 
As described in the literature, patients may have improved quality of life and better goal -
concordant care when exposed to ACPs, especially earlier in their disease course. An intervention 
that prompts providers to have an SIC  with patients on active treat ment for cancer may increase 
the likelihood that these conversations occur and that they occur earlier in the disease course. 
However, it is possible that patients will receive no benefit from this study.  
 
3. Subject Privacy:  
Privacy will be given utmost c onsideration and is highly valued in the proposed research.  No 
research activities involve any direct interaction with subjects that would pose risk to their privacy.  
 
4. Subject Confidentiality : 
Confidentiality refers to the subject’s understanding of, and agreement to, the ways in which  
identifiable information will be stored and shared.   
 
How will confidentiality of data be maintained?   
  
 Paper -based records will be kept in a secure location and only be accessible to personnel 
involved in the study.  
 Computer -based files will only be made a vailable to personnel involved in the study 
through the use of access privileges and passwords.  
 Prior to access to any study -related information, personnel will be required to sign 
statements agreeing to protect the security and confidentiality of identifiable information.  
 Whenever feasible, identifiers will be removed from study -related information.   
Effect of behavioral nudges on Serious Illness Conversations  
Version 9: 8-08-[ADDRESS_827275]’s financ ial standing, 
employability, or liability.  
 A waiver of documentation of consent is being requested, because the only link between 
the subject and the study would be the consent document and the primary risk is a breach of 
confidentiality.  (This is not an option for FDA -regulated research.)  
 Precautions are in place to ensure the data is secure by [CONTACT_71994], 
because the research involves web -based surveys.   
 Audio and/or video recordings will be transcribed and then destroyed to eliminate audible 
identification of subjects.  
 Other (specify):     
 
 
To pr otect participant confidentiality, only the research team outlined in HSERA will have access to 
review identified research records. Confidentiality will be protected to the fullest extent allowable 
under the law. See the Data Management section for more de tails.  
 
If any data needs to be transmitted, it will be done through a Penn -approved secure encrypted file 
transfer solution as is described Penn IRB’s Guidance on Electronic Data Protection Requirements for 
Research Involving the Use of PHI. Records will  not be released without the participant’s consent 
unless required by [CONTACT_2371] (e.g., imminent risk of harm to self suspected) or court order. When results of 
the research are presented at scientific meetings or published, no identifying information will be 
included.  
 
All identifiable data, including the master list linking identifiers to the ID number and recordings, will be 
destroyed in 2028, seven years after the award period ends.  
 
5. Protected Health Information  
• Name  
• Address  
• Date of Birth  
• Phone number(s)  
• Electronic mail address  
 
6. Compensation :  
Participants will not be compensated for participating  in this study .  
 
7. Data and Safety Monitoring : 
The nature of the project  poses minimal risk to participant safety and privacy . Yet, we will constitute a 
formal Data Safety Monitoring Board. The specific aspects of the DSMB for this study are as follows:  
1. The DSMB will consist of 4 members: 1) Erin Aakhus, MD, Assistant Professor of 
Clinical Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of P ennsylvania, Associate 
Director of the Hematology Oncology Fellowship Program 2) Kate Courtright, MD, 
MSHP, Assistant Professor of Clinical Medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine of 
the University of Pennsylvania 3) Kit Delgado, MD, MS, Assistant Prof essor of 
Emergency Medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine of the University of 
Pennsylvania, Associate Director of Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral 
Economics 4) Meghan Lane -Fall, MD, MSHP, David E. Longnecker Associate 
Professor of Anesthes iology and Critical Care & Associate Professor of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_621428], Associate 
Director of the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics  
2. The DSMB will perform several duties. First, they will review and approve research 
protocols and plans for data and safety monitoring prior to any study commencement. 
Effect of behavioral nudges on Serious Illness Conversations  
Version 9: 8-08-[ADDRESS_827276] 
University procedures for safety monitoring. The specific elements of our oversight plan are as above: 
1) all project staff will complete certifi cation in the protection of research participants; 2) the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_155374], or more frequently as determined by [CONTACT_5040], which may in turn suspend, terminate or restrict the study as appropriate; and 3) any serious 
adverse events will be reviewed in real time by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_152213]. Individual -
level data for participants will be kept confidential and will only be stored on highly secure servers 
available for patient -level data. On ly authorized project personnel will have access to the data and the 
data will only be stored on servers and not stand -alone PCs or laptops. All data will be reported at 
units of aggregation which make impossible the identification of individual patients o r clinicians.  
 
The data and safety monitoring plan will have [ADDRESS_827277], the study MPIs, biostatistician, and 
Director of the Data Management Unit will develop and implement methods of verifying entered data 
and of quality control. Second, the MPIs wi ll be directly responsible for identifying and reporting all 
adverse events, protocol deviations/violations and unanticipated events to the IRB and funding 
agency promptly, as appropriate. The PIs will also report all adverse events, accrual rates, retenti on 
rates, and all other logistical issues to the DSMB (described above ) at least biannually (and more 
frequently if there are serious adverse events). Third, there will be a DSMB responsible for monitoring 
the trial.  
 
A written research protocol will unde rgo formal institutional scientific and institutional review board 
(IRB) review at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) to ensure protection of the rights and welfare of 
human research subjects. Specifically, the MPIs and the IRB will be responsible for e nsuring risks to 
human subjects are minimized, risks are reasonable, subject selection is equitable, the research team 
has access to adequate resources to conduct the study, the informed consent process (or waiver) 
meets regulatory and ethical requirements , adequate provision is made to protect human subjects by 
[CONTACT_155382].  
 
All senior/key personnel and research staff who will b e involved in the design and conduct of the study 
must receive education in human research subject protection from a training program that is approved 
by a properly constituted independent Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board. The MPIs will 
be re sponsible for ensuring project faculty and staff have the equipment and training required to 
protect privacy and confidentiality and will monitor and document that these individuals are properly 
certified. If new senior/key personnel and staff become invol ved in the research, documentation that 
they have received the required education will be included in the annual progress reports. The 
UPENN Office of Regulatory Affairs currently requires HIPAA training upon designation as research 
investigator/staff and recertification in human research subjects protection every three years.  
 
The Penn IRB will serve as the IRB of record for any external ethics review boards or IRBs applicable 
to researchers from other institutions who may have access to human research sub jects identified 
data.

 This study presents minimal risk that is balanced by [CONTACT_155383].  
 
INFORMED CONSENT : 
 
1. Consent Process : 
Aims [ADDRESS_827278] for  these types of trials. We 
will identify clinicians at the practice sites and their patients using the EMR.   
 
2. Waiver of Informed Consent : 
We are requesting a waiver of informed consent and HIPAA authorization from clinicians and patients 
(see attached request for waiver of HIPAA authorization). A waiver of informed consent is reques ted 
for the following reasons. First, it is not feasible to consent every patient and clinician randomized to 
nudges . Second, if members of the control group were consented, they would know they were being 
studied and this could change their behavior. This could potential ly disrupt the design of the study and 
make interpretation of the findings challenging. Third, clinicians are not forced to have serious illness 
conversations with their patients , and patients are not being forced to engage in the pre -work or the 
conversatio ns with their providers . In all arms, clinicians can still engage or refrain from the 
conversation  according to their best clinical judgment , and patients can refuse to participate in the 
conversation, even when engaged by [CONTACT_137021] . Third , as part o f a previous quality improvement 
initiative, we interviewed [ADDRESS_827279] not re -
consenting patients to use data from the questionnaire provided as part of this study.  
  
RESOURCES NECESSARY FOR HUMAN RESEARCH PROTECTION : 
Adequate facilities are available at the ACC . The members of the research team are outlined in 
HSERA and include appropriate personnel to successfully implement this project . The entire team will 
be overseen by [CONTACT_978]. All personnel will complete required training before being granted access to 
any identifying information. This includes training on confidentiality through the Collaborative IRB 
Training Initiative (CITI) course. All personnel will be trained in the proced ures for reporting 
unintentional breaches in confidentiality to the PI . All personnel will be aware that violations of 
participants’ confidentiality, either unintentional or deliberate, may result in termination of hire. The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_621429] a ll research personnel regarding data, limits of confidentiality, maintaining 
confidentiality and proper study procedures.

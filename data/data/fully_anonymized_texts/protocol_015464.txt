assessed at Baseline and various time points including 24 hours (Day 2), Week 12, and Week 26 
during treatment  
Study Design and Methodology:  
This is an open -label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, and PD of intravenous eculizumab 
in pediatric patients aged 6 to <  18 years with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) -antibody (Ab) positive refractory 
gMG. There will be 4  periods in this study: Screening Period (2 to 4 weeks), Primary Evaluation Treatment 
Period (26 weeks), Extension Period (up to an additional 208 weeks), and Follow -up Period (8  weeks). All 
patients  who complete Week [ADDRESS_62834] dose of study drug for all patients upon withdrawal or discontinuation from the study or upon completion of 
the study when the patient is not continuing to receive eculizumab treatment.  
Patients may continue use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChI),  intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and 
supportive immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (ISTs) during the study where applicable under certain restrictions.   
Screening Period (2 to 4 weeks):  
Patients will be screened for study eligibility only after obtaining the informed assent of the patient and informed permission of the parent or other legal guardian.  
To reduce the risk of me ningococcal infection, all patients must be vaccinated against meningococcal infections 
within the [ADDRESS_62835] Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae ) and Streptococcus 
pneumoniae (S pneumoniae ), and strictly adhere to the national vaccination recommendations for each age 
group.  
The site must notify the Sponsor if any patient experiences signs and symptoms of MG worsening that require 
rescue or foreseeable imminent change to the background medication, during the Screening Period. Patients 
whose MG is unstable (as determined by [CONTACT_737]) during the Screening Period may be rescreened based on discussion and agreement between the Investigator and the Alexion Medical Monitor.  
Primary Evaluation Treatment Period (26 weeks):  
All patients will receive eculizumab by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) infusion during the open -label Primary Evaluation 
Treatment Period. Dosing will be initiated with a weekly weight- based induction regimen and, thereafter, will 
be eve ry 2 weeks.  
Extension Period (up to 208 weeks):  
After completing the 26 -week Primary Evaluation Treatment Period, patients will continue receiving 
eculizumab in the Extension Period of this study for up to an additional 208 weeks.  
Follow -up Period:  
• Safet y Follow -up (8 weeks)  
Patients who do not enter the Extension Period from the Primary Evaluation Treatment Period, who withdraw from the study at any time, or who do not continue to receive eculizumab treatment upon study completion will be followed for at  least [ADDRESS_62836] dose of eculizumab. Patients who complete the study and 
transition to uninterrupted treatment with commercially available eculizumab will not be required to complete an 8-week follow -up visit.

c Only patients in 15-20 kg weight category to be included in this group.  
Note s: The timing of supplemental eculizumab dosing varies by [CONTACT_57729]:  
• If a patient continues to receive IVIg treatment at a dose cycle interval equal to or more frequent than every 
4 weeks during eculizumab treatment, a supplement al dose will be administered at the same time that each 
scheduled dose of eculizumab is administered.  
• If a patient receives IVIg treatment at a dose cycle interval less frequent than every [ADDRESS_62854] dose of the IVIg infusion cycle at the 
next scheduled eculizumab dose.  
 
• If a patient receives IVIg treatment within [ADDRESS_62855] dose of eculizumab is 
administered (ie, the total dose is the supplemental dose plus the first scheduled dose).
 
When IVIg is administered as acute rescue therapy for clinical deterioration, no supplemental dose of 
eculizumab should be administered. However, if a patient receives more than [ADDRESS_62856] dose of the 
second IVIg cycle and at the end of each s ubsequent IVIg dose cycle within the 12 -week period in accordance 
with Table  2.  
For patients who undergo PE, plasmapheresis (PP), or receive fresh frozen plasma (FFP), supplemental 
eculizumab dosing should be administered as shown in Table 3 . In addition, patients are to continue study drug 
infusion according to the protocol -specified dosing regimen. If the PE/PP/FFP is on the day of a scheduled

Alexion Confidential  2. INTRODUCTION  
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare, chronic, autoimmune disease of neuromuscular transmission 
that manifests clinically in both children and adults as fluctuating weakness in voluntary muscles 
that is exacerbated during periods of activity and improves after periods of rest (Barnett, 2014; Sieb, 2014).  The pathological hallmark of both juvenile and adult forms of MG is production of 
antibodies (Abs) against the components of the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), predominantly the acetylcholine rece ptor (AChR). Although adults and 
juveniles with MG share aspects of presentation and pathophysiology, there are differences in 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_57688]. Additionally, the ongoing development of children and adolescents 
complicate therapeutic decision mak ing in young patients with MG.  
2.1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_57689] 10% to 20% of all MG cases ( Snead, 1980; Szorbor, 1988-1989). The annual incidence of MG in 
children and adolescents has been reported as approximately 1.1 per million  in North America 
and 1 to 5 per million in Europe ( Phillips, 1992; Andrews, 2004;  McGrogan, 2010;  
Della Marina, 2014), with incidence and prevalence varying geographically. Ten percent of patients with MG have disease limited to ocular muscles, while the remaining 90% have 
generalized MG (gMG),  with muscle weakness involving neck, head, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], bulbar, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
or limb muscles.  
Clinically, gMG in children and adolescents presents as fluctuating and fatigable skeletal muscle weakness, which improves with rest, similar to manifestations of the  disease in adults. Clinical 
features may include predominantly ocular symptoms with ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and/or 
diplopia. Bulbar symptoms of dysphagia and/or dysphonia may be present, as well as generalized 
symptoms of exercise intolerance and weakness. As with adults, respi[INVESTIGATOR_57690] a feature of MG in children and adolescents and may lead to respi[INVESTIGATOR_57691], particularly if left untreated. In children and adolescents with MG, 
prepubertal patients tend to be more clinically distinct compared to adults with MG, as compared 
with the pubertal/postpubertal group who share more features with adult- onset MG.  
2.2. Unmet Medical Need  
While there is no cure for MG, there are a variety of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_57692]. Currently available treatments for MG aim to modulate neuromuscular transmission, inhibit the production or effects of pathogenic antibodies, or inhibit 
inflammatory cytokines ( Kim, 2011). There is currently no specific treatment that targets the 
underlying pathophysiology of NMJ injury specifically: anti- AChR Ab -AChR interactions 
resulting in complement activation via the classical pathway and inflammation, with the resultant destruction  of the NMJ. With current standard of care, which combines cholinesterase inhibitors, 
corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (ISTs; most commonly azathioprine [AZA], 
cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil [MMF]), the majority of MG patients have their 
disease reasonably well controlled. For the cohort of refractory patients who do not respond adequately to ISTs or cannot tolerate ISTs and those who require repeated treatments with plasma exchange (PE) and/or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) to ma intain clinical stability 
(Conti-Fine, 2006), there is a medical need for alternative treatment strategies targeting different

Alexion Confidential  pathophysiological aspects of the disease. There are currently no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_57693]. Since complement activation plays a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_57694] ( Vincent, 2002;  Conti -Fine, 2006), eculizumab, a 
terminal complement inhibitor, may benefit patients who continue to have generalized weakness 
and bulbar signs and symptoms despi[INVESTIGATOR_57695].  
2.3. Eculizumab Clinical Program in Refractory Generalized Myasthenia 
Gravis 
Alexion has completed [ADDRESS_62868] ory gMG patients was consistent with the well -established 
safety profile of the drug with over 10 years of clinical and postmarketing use. The data observed 
in the ongoing Study ECU- MG-302 support the long- term safety and maintenance of clinical 
response o f eculizumab in adults with refractory gMG.  
Based on the data from these 3 studies, eculizumab was approved for AChR Ab -positive adults 
with refractory gMG in the EU ([ADDRESS_62869] 2017), gMG in the US (23 October 2017), and gMG 
with symptoms that are difficu lt to control with high-dose IVIg therapy or PE in Japan 
(25 December 2017). 
Refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for further information on the safety and 
efficacy data of eculizumab.  
2.4. Eculizumab Dose in Pediatric Refractory gMG Patients 
The s afety and efficacy of the 900 mg/1200 mg dose regimen was previously established in 
adults with refractory gMG in Study ECU- MG-301. The categorical dose regimen selected for 
this pediatric study (Study ECU- MG-303) is based on the body weight of the pediatr ic patient, 
thus allowing for the accommodation of weight changes during the development and maturation of the patient. For pediatric gMG patients on stable, maintenance IVIg treatment, a series of 
supplemental doses of eculizumab must be administered. If a patient undergoes plasmapheresis 
(PP)/PE/fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for clinical deterioration during the study, a supplemental dose of study drug must be administered. The proposed pediatric dose regimen is supported by 
[CONTACT_31577]/PD modeling and simulation using data from the MG adult studies, and is identical to that 
approved for pediatric patients with aHUS, except for the supplemental dose with IVIg administration.  
2.5. Rationale for Eculizumab Refractory gMG Pediatric Study 
The pathophysiology of MG involves auto- Ab-driven uncontrolled terminal complement 
activation with membrane attack complex dependent lysis and activation, which causes 
inflammation at the NMJ, AChR loss, and failure of neuromuscular transmission. Eculizumab 
binds specifically to the human terminal complement component 5 (C5), inhibiting C5 enzymatic 
Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0         Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion)  
[ADDRESS_62870] the 
NMJ in both adults and children/adolescents. 
The favorable benefit- risk for eculizumab in the treatment of adult patients with refractory gMG 
that was established in the adult clinical  program provides the basis for studying eculizumab in 
the pediatric patient population.  The clinical development program in adults with refractory gMG has informed the methodology 
of the study design and investigational plan for this first clinical study in pediatric refractory 
gMG patients.  
2.6. Benefit and Risk Assessment  
2.6.1. Potential Benefits  
Given that MG is a chronic disease, pediatric patients with refractory gMG are at risk of substantial morbidity and mortality, including profound weakness, slurred speech, dysarthria, choking, the inability to swallow hard and/or soft foods, disorienting vision, shortness of breath 
(both with activity and at rest), significant upper and lower extremity weakness, substantially 
impaired mobility, marked reductions in ability  to perform activities of daily living, extreme 
fatigue, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_57696], all of which can 
have a dramatic impact on quality of life. As there is currently no approved therapy for refractory 
gMG in the pediatric population, the benefit of sustained terminal complement inhibition and the consistency of the eculizumab treatment effect observed in the adult population support the 
potential clinical benefit of eculizumab in pediatric refractory gMG patients.  
2.6.2. Identified and Potential Risks  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Meningococcal Infection and Other Encapsulated Bacterial Infections 
Eculizumab blocks terminal complement; therefore , patients may have increased susceptibility to 
encapsulated bacterial infections, in particular  Neisseria meni ngitidis  (N meningitidis ). Specific 
risk mitigation measures in place are described in Section  6.3.4. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Immunogenicity  
As with any humanized monoclonal Ab, administration of eculizumab may be associated with 
the development of anti-drug antibodies. Monitoring of immunogenicity is planned, as described 
in Section  4.2 and Section  9.5.

Alexion Confidential  4. STUDY DESIGN  
4.1. Overall Design  
Study ECU- MG-303 is an open- label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, and 
PD of eculizumab for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 6 to < [ADDRESS_62871] 12 eligible patients aged 12 to <  [ADDRESS_62872] 10 evaluable patients 
aged 12 to < 18 years for the primary endpoint taking into account potential dropouts. There will be 4 periods in this study:  
• Screening Period (2- 4 weeks)  
• Primary Evaluation Treatment Period (26 weeks) 
• Extension Period (up to an additional 208 weeks) 
• Follow-up Period (8 weeks)  
Patients  may continue to receive AChI, IVIg, and ISTs  during the study where applicable under 
certain restrictions. For patients who enter the study receiving any background therapy, the dose 
and frequency may not be changed during the Primary Evaluation Treatment Period be fore 
Week  12, unless deemed necessary per the Investigator based on clinical safety evaluation and 
Sponsor approval is obtained. Dose change with background medication is permitted after 
Week  12 at the Investigator’s discretion and with Sponsor notification. During the Extension 
Period, changes in background medications will be permitted at the Investigator’s discretion and 
with Sponsor notification.  
If a patient withdraws from the study or discontinues eculizumab treatment at any time, the 
patient will be  required to complete an Early Termination (ET) visit at the time of withdrawal 
and a Follow-up visit [ADDRESS_62873] dose of study drug. The overall study duration 
for an individual patient can be up to 246 weeks (approximately 4.7 years) from the Screening 
Period through the Follow-up Period.  
This pediatric study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of eculizumab in AChR -Ab 
positive refractory pediatric gMG patients, similar to what has been demonstrated in patients 
aged ≥ 18 years in Study ECU- MG-301 (a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study). 
The similar pathogenic autoantibody profile (AChR-Ab), pathophysiology, clinical presentation, 
and treatment responses in AChR-Ab positive patients aged ≥ [ADDRESS_62874] a similar efficacy profile of eculizumab in patients aged ≥ 18 years and 
pediatric patients with refractory gMG. Given the demonstration of the efficacy and safety of 
eculizumab in patients aged ≥ 18 years , randomizing pediatric patients to a placebo treatment

This pediatric study is similar to the study conducted in patients aged ≥ 18 years (Study ECU- MG-301) in permitting background IST use. All patients may continue to receive 
ISTs during the study. Given the global nature of the study (multicenter) and experience from the 
study in patients aged ≥ [ADDRESS_62875] availability; thus, the use of ISTs will not be standardized in this study. In contrast to the study in patients aged ≥ 18 years , the number of eligible refra ctory

and on a stable dose ≥ [ADDRESS_62877] 1 patient in each geographic region (North America, EU, and APAC).  
There will be no limit on the number o f patients aged 6 to < 12 years who may enter the study on 
maintenance IVIg. This change was made based on the higher prevalence of maintenance IVIg use in children. 
4.1.1. Screening Period (2 to 4 weeks)  
Patients will be screened for study eligibility only after obtaining the informed consent of the 
parent or other legal guardian, and the patient’s informed assent, when applicable. Assessment 
will include confirmation of a refractory gMG diagnosis per protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, QMG total score, history of previous MG treatments and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], history of MG 
exacerbation or crisis and the treatment for each exacerbation/crisis, and a comprehensive review of medical history, including vaccination history, as well as any non- MG comorbid condit ions. 
When an eligible patient meets all inclusion criteria, but none of the exclusion criteria, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_57697].  
To reduce the risk of meningococcal infec tion, all patients must be vaccinated against 
meningococcal infections within the [ADDRESS_62878] be vaccinated or revaccinated according to current national 
vaccination guidelines or local practice for vaccination use with complement-inhibitors (eg, eculizumab) . In addition to meningococcal vaccination, patients must be vaccinated against 
Haemophilus influenzae  (H influenzae ) and Streptococcus pneumoniae  (S pneumoniae ), if not 
already vaccinated, and strictly adhere to the national vaccination recommendat ions for each age 
group.  
The site must notify the Sponsor if any patient experiences signs and symptoms of MG 
worsening that require rescue or foreseeable imminent change to the background medication 
during the Screening Period. Following discussion with the Sponsor, a decision will be made 
about whether the patient may be enrolled in the study or should be withdrawn. Patients whose MG is unstable (as determined by [CONTACT_737]) during the Screening Period may be 
rescreened at a later date based on discussion and agreement between the Investigator and the 
Alexion Medical Monitor.  
4.1.2. Primary Evaluation Treatment Period (26 weeks)  
All patients will receive eculizumab by [CONTACT_57730]- label Primary Evaluation 
Treatment Period. Dosing will be in itiated with a weekly weight -based induction regimen and, 
thereafter, will be every 2 weeks. Weight may change for an individual patient during the study, 
and dose regimen will be based on the current visit’s recorded body weight. If site/institution 
policies prohibit study drug to be prepared day- of visit, the weight from the most recent study 
visit should be used.

the Investigator in the event these occur. The Investigator should make every effort to evaluate a patient reporting worsening signs and symptoms of MG as soon as possible and within 48 hours of notification. The Investigator will assess for clinical deterioration and treat the patient 
accordingly.  
4.1.3. Extension Period (up to an additional 208 weeks)  
After completing the 26 -week Primary Evaluation Treatment Period, patients will continue 
receiving eculizumab in the Extension Period of this study for up to an additional 208 weeks. 
Weight may change for an individual patient during the study, and dose regimen will be based on 
the current visit’s recorded body weight. If site/institution policies prohibit study d rug to be 
prepared day-of visit, the weight from the most recent study visit should be used. Patients may 
have an opportunity to receive study drug administration remotely at a medical facility that is 
located near the patient’s home or at the patient’s home with the permission of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_57698], state, and local laws or regulations of the pertinent 
regulatory authorities.  
4.1.4. Follow- up Period: Safety Follow -up (8 weeks)  
Patients who withdraw or discontinue treatment at any time and for any reason after receiving 
any amount of eculizumab will be required to complete both an ET Visit at the time of withdrawal and a Follow -up Visit at [ADDRESS_62880] 
confirm with the patient or their guardian/caregiver by [CONTACT_57731] [ADDRESS_62881]-Treatment Follow -up (up to 1 year)  
The Sponsor may seek to collect follow -up information concerning MG status in patients

Additional (Unscheduled) visits outside the specified visits for study procedures, tests, and 
assessments may be performed at the request of the Investigator or Sponsor. If an Unscheduled 
Visit is performed, any tests, procedures, or assessments performed at the Unscheduled Visits 
must be recorded on the electronic case report forms (eCRFs) . 
4.1.8. Study Completion  
A patient is considered to have completed the study if:  
• The patient has completed all periods of the study including the last visit of the Extension Period, or 
• In the event the study is completed early, the patient has completed all applicable 
periods of the study including the ET/End of Study visit, or,  
• The patient completes the study early (and completes an ET visit) because the study 
drug has become registered or approved (in accordance with country- specific 
regulations)  
4.2. Study Flow Diagram and Schedule of Assessments  
The flow diagram for the study design is illustrated in Figure 1. The Schedule of Assessments 
during the study for patients in weight cohorts ≥ 40  kg, 30 to < 40 kg and 20 to < 30 kg are 
summarized in Table  4 and  Table  5. The Schedule of Assessments for patients in weight cohort 
10 to < 20 kg are summarized in Table  6 and Table  7.Weight cohort may change for an 
individual patient during the study, and dose regimen will be based on the current visit’s recorded body weight. If site/institution policies prohibit study drug to be prepared day- of visit, 
the weight from the most recent study visit should be used.

accommodate any growth changes in patients. When possible, dose regimen should be based on the current visit’s recorded body weight. If site/institution 
policies prohibit study drug to be pr epared day -of visit, the weight from the most recent study visit should be used. For additional details on weight -based 
treatment regimens, refer to Table 15  for scheduled doses of eculizumab and Table  16 and Table 17  for supplemental doses of eculizumab. During the 
initial induction phase, if a patient’s weight increases or decreases resulting in a change in weight cohort the Alexion medi cal monitor must be contact[CONTACT_57734].  
h. Collect height  with no shoes or footwear.  
i. All AEs (serious and nonserious) will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form.  
j. Prior to study drug infusion, perform the MG -ADL, QMG, and MGC using a properly trained evaluator, preferably the same evaluator at approximately 
the same time of day throughout the study; MGFA -PIS must be performed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_57701] -trained neurologist, preferably the same evaluator 
throughout the study.  
k. The recall period for the MG -ADL is the preceding [ADDRESS_62909] visit if the visit interval is < [ADDRESS_62910] 10 hours prior to the QMG and MGC tests.  
m. Perform serum pregnancy tests on all female patients of childbearing potential at the specified time points. Additi onal pregnancy tests (serum or urine) 
may also be performed at any visit at the PI’s discretion.  
n. Perform urine pregnancy tests on all female patients of childbearing potential at the specified time points. Additional pregn ancy tests (serum or urine) may

r. Review the Patient Safety Information Card with the patient and caregiver to discuss the importance of carrying the safety ca rd at all times.  
s. Administer study drug after completion of all other tests and procedures, excluding the peak blood sampling for PK, hemolysis, and free C5 assay.  
t. For supplemental weight -based eculizumab dosing, refer to Table  16 and Table 17 .  
u. Should the patient’s weight increase ≥20kg during the study, dosing should be based on the most recently recorded body weight at a prior dosing visit and 
adjusted accordingly to ensure the proper dosing regimen per patients current weight. Refer to  Table [ADDRESS_62913] confirm with the patient or their guardian/caregiver by [CONTACT_57732] a vailable eculizumab occurred

subject’s home or at the subject’s home with the permission of the Investigator in accordance with all national, state, and local laws or regulations of the 
pertinent regulatory authorities.  
b. Shown as visit/week for Weight Cohorts ≥40 kg, 30 to <40 kg, and 20 to <30 kg (10 to <20 kg).  
c. Unscheduled visits and procedures will be performed at the Investigator's discretion, and results will be recorded in the eCRF.  
d. Perform an evaluation visit for CD as soon as possible within [ADDRESS_62915] the dosing profile of eculizumab and should  be adjusted to 
accommodate any growth changes in patients. When possible, dose regimen should be based on the current visit’s recorded body weight. If site/institution 
policies prohibit study drug to be prepared day- of visit, the weight from the most recent study visit should be used. For additional details on weight -based 
treatment regimens, refer to Table 15  for scheduled doses of eculizumab and Table  16 and Table 17  for supplemental doses of eculizumab. During the 
initial induction phase, if a patient’s weight increases or decreases resulting in a change in weight cohort the  Alexion medical monitor must be contact[CONTACT_57734].  
h. Collect height with no shoes or footwear.  
i. All AEs (serious and nonserious) will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form.  
j. Prior to study drug infusion, perform the MG -ADL, QMG, and MGC using a properly trained evaluator, preferably the same evaluator at approximately 
the same time of day throughout the study; MGFA -PIS must be performed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_57701] -trained neurologist, preferably the same evaluator 
throughout the study.  
k. The recall period for the MG -ADL is the preceding [ADDRESS_62916] visit if the visit interval is < [ADDRESS_62917] 10 hours prior to the QMG and MGC tests.  
m. Perform serum pregnancy tests on all fema le patients of childbearing potential at the specified time points. Additional pregnancy tests (serum or urine) 
may also be performed at any visit at the PI’s discretion.  
n. Perform urine pregnancy tests on all female patients of childbearing potential at the  specified time points. Additional pregnancy tests (serum or urine) may 
also be performed at any visit at the PI’s discretion.  
o. Obtain Baseline and trough blood samples for PK, hemolysis, free C5, and ADA tests 5 – [ADDRESS_62918] dose blood samples for PK, 
hemolysis, and free C5 after study drug infusion at Visit 2 (Day 1). For the sample coll ected at 24 hours, there will be a window of ±[ADDRESS_62919](s) medically indicated may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator.  
q. Patients must be revaccinated for N meningitidis , H influenzae , and S pneumoniae  to provide active coverage according to current medical/country 
guidelines.  
r. Review the Patient Safety Information Card with the patient and caregiver to discuss the importance of carrying the safety ca rd at all times.  
s. Administer study drug after completion of all other tests and procedures, excluding the peak blood sampling for PK, hemolysis , and free C5 assay.

Alexion Confidential  t. For supplemental weight -based eculizumab dosing, refer to Table  16 and Table 17 .  
u. Should the patient’s weight increase ≥20kg during the study, dosing shoul d be based on the most recently recorded body weight at a prior dosing visit and 
adjusted accordingly to ensure the proper dosing regimen per patients current weight. Refer to  Table [ADDRESS_62920] confirm with the patient or their guardian/caregiver by [CONTACT_57732] a vailable eculizumab occurred 
within [ADDRESS_62921] scheduled dose during the study. In the event that treatment with commercia lly available eculizumab is delayed, an unscheduled 
safety Follow -up Visit should occur on the day of initiating commercial eculizumab treatment or as soon as feasible.  
x. Clinical laboratory tests are to be performed every 6 months during the extension peri od.

Alexion Confidential  4.3. Protocol Definitions 
4.3.1. Clinical Deterioration and Rescue Therapy  
On-study rescue therapy (eg, high dose corticosteroid, plasma exchange [PE], or intravenous 
immunoglobulin [IVIg]) will be allowed when a patient experiences clinical deterioration as 
defined in this protocol. The rescue therapy used for a particular patient will be at the discretion of the Investigator.  Every effort should be made to notify the Sponsor within 24 hours should a 
patient require rescue therapy.  
For this protocol, clinical deterioration warranting the use of o n-study rescue therapy is defined 
as follows:  
• Patients who experience an MG crisis, which is defined as weakness due to MG that is severe enough to necessitate intubation or to delay extubation following surgery; or, 
• Significant symptomatic worsening that requires rescue medication in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]; or,  
• Patients for whom the Investigator believes that the patients’ health is in jeopardy if 
rescue therapy is not given. 
4.3.2. Clinical Evaluator  
Clinical Evaluators are study staff that have been trained and certified in administering the 
QMG, MG- ADL, and MGC. The Clinical Evaluator may be a neurologist, physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], or 
other study team member delegated by [CONTACT_737]. Clinical Evaluator training and certification for this protocol will take place either at the Investigator's meeting or via the Sponsor's designated online training portal or other mechanism. 
4.3.3. Responsibilities for Myasthenia Gravis Assessments  
Responsibilities for MG assessments are summarized in Table  12. Throughout the study, MG 
assessments for an individual patient should be performed at approximately the same time of day 
by a properly trained evaluator, preferably the same evaluator.

Gently invert the infusion bag containing the diluted study drug solution to ensure thorough 
mixing of the product and diluents. Discard any unused portion left in a vial, as the product 
contains no preservatives. The diluted solution should be allowed to warm to room temperature 
by [CONTACT_57740].  
6.1.4. Study Drug Administration  
Study drug should only be administered via IV infusion, using a weight -based schedule 
(Section  6.2). DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN IV PUSH OR BOLUS INJECTION.  
Prior to study drug administration, the diluted solution should be allowed to warm to room temperature by [CONTACT_57741]. The diluted solution must not be heated in a microwave 
or with any heat source other than ambient air temperature. Parenteral drug products should be 
inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.  
The diluted study drug should be intravenously administered over 1 to 4 hours in pediatric 
patients. For those patients who reach ≥ 18 years of age during the study, the study drug should 
be administered intravenously over 35 (± 10) minutes. It is not necessary to protect the infusion 
bags from light while study drug is being administered to the patient. The patient should be 
monitored for at least 1 hour following infusion.  
If an AE occurs during administration of the study drug, the infusion may be slowed or stopped 
at the discretion of the Investigator, depending upon the nature and severity of the event; 
however, the overall duration should not exceed 2 hours from the start of the infusion in patients 
aged ≥ 18 years and 4 hours from the start of infusion in pediatric patients. In patients aged ≥ [ADDRESS_62961] be captured in the patient’s source document and eCRF.  
The actual start and stop times of all dose administrations will be recorded in the  patient’s source 
documents and eCRF. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional directions on study drug 
administration.  
Sites must have resuscitation equipment, emergency drugs, and appropriately trained staff 
available during the infusion, and for at least [ADDRESS_62962] should verify the contents, 
sign the packing invoice provided with the shipment, and maintain the original copy for review by [CONTACT_11200]. Additionally, reception of study drug (as well as reception conditions) 
Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0         Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion)  
[ADDRESS_62963] be reported to the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system to allow drug 
randomization, resupply, estimations, and drug expi[INVESTIGATOR_57708].  
Unless notified otherwise, empty vials and vials with residual materials should be kept for 
inspection and accountability by [CONTACT_57742] (SOPs) for clinical study drugs. Destruction of used and 
unused vials, either locally or centrally, must be properly documented. Drug accountability will 
be managed through the IRT system and detailed instructions on managing the IRT drug accountability module will be included in the IRT User Guide. The IRT module will perform 
accountability in two stages, where site personnel will complete an initial accountability entry in 
the system followed by [CONTACT_57743].  The pharmacist or designee must maintain accurate records 
demonstrating dates and amount of IP received, to whom dispensed (subject-by-subject accounting), and accounts of any IP accidentally or deliberately destroyed. These drug accountability records must be readily available upon request and  will be reviewed throughout 
the study. 
Each kit will have a label and a place for the pharmacist to record the patient number and initials.  The study monitor will examine the inventory during the study. Additionally, the inventory 
records must be readily available to regulatory authorities, th e local regulatory agency, or an 
independent auditor’s inspection at any time. 
Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional information.  
6.1.6. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
All clinical study material provided to the Investigator will be stored in a secure place and  
allocated and dispensed by [CONTACT_30801]. Detailed records of the amounts of 
the study drug received, dispensed, and destroyed will be maintained. 
To satisfy regulatory requirements regarding drug accountability, all remaining eculizumab 
inventory will be reconciled and destroyed or returned to Alexion at the end of the study according to applicable regulations. 
Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for fu rther information.  
6.2. Dosing Regimen 
6.2.1. Rationale for Selection of Doses in the Study  
The doses of eculizumab to be administered in this study have been selected to produce 
eculizumab trough concentration coverage comparable to that observed in Study ECU- MG-301, 
in which the efficacy and safety of eculizumab in adult patients (18 years of age or older) with 
refractory AChR -Ab positive gMG was established. A modeling and simulation study was 
completed to support the planned bodyweight- categorized dose r egimens, which is described in 
further detail below.  
Demonstrating PK bridging between aHUS and refractory gMG patients aged ≥ [ADDRESS_62964] dose regimens for pediatric patients with refractory gMG, as substantial 
pediatric data has been generated for pediatric patients with aHUS, and no prior PK data from

Page 80 of 123 
Alexion Confidential  pediatric patients with refractory gMG exists. The successful PK bridging enables extrapolation 
of the aHUS pediatric data and corresponding PK model to pediatric patients with refractory 
gMG. Simulations using the aHUS PK model and gMG PK model, respectively, demonstrated 
the comparability of eculizumab serum concentration time profiles between patients with aHUS and patients with refractory gMG for body weight ≥ 40 kg.  
Demonstrating PD bridging between aHUS/paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and 
patients aged ≥ 18 years with refractory gMG was also important. Using PK and PD data from 
patients aged ≥ 18 years and pediatric patients with aHUS and patients aged ≥ 18 years and 
pedia tric patients with PNH, the PK/PD (hemolysis) analysis identified an eculizumab threshold 
concentration range of 50-100 μg/mL to achieve complete inhibition of hemolysis.  
Using PK and PD data from patients aged ≥ 18 years with refractory gMG from Studies C08-001 
and ECU- MG-301, the PK/PD analysis of hemolysis or free C5 identified an eculizumab 
threshold serum concentration of 85 μg/mL to achieve complete inhibition of hemolysis, which 
is within the range of 50-100 μg/mL identified above in aHUS.  
Therefor e, the PD bridging was successfully demonstrated between the [ADDRESS_62965].  
The aHUS PK model was used to simulate eculizumab concentration time profiles for the 
pediatric patients with refractory gMG. The simulation results showed that overall the proposed 
dosing regimens across the body weight categories essentially maintained therapeutic levels of eculizumab. Hence, the proposed bodyweight-categorized dosing regime ns are expected to 
achieve immediate, sustained, and complete inhibition of terminal complement in pediatric patients with refractory gMG.  
Complete and sustained inhibition of complement activity will be confirmed with PK/ PD data 
derived from this study.  
6.2.2. Dosing Regimen Preparation and Administration  
Eculizumab will be administered weekly during the initial induction phase and every 2 weeks 
during the maintenance phase. The dosing regimen will be based on the pediatric patient’s body 
weight ( Table 15 ). 
Table 15: Weight- based Dosing Regimen of Eculizumab

a Dose regimen will be based on the current visit’s recorded body weight. If site/institution policies prohibit 
study drug to be prepared day- of visit, the weight from the most recent study visit  should be used  
b During the initial induction phase, if a patient’s weight increases or decreases resulting in a change in 
weight cohort, the Alexion medical monitor must be contact[CONTACT_57728] .

Alexion Confidential  Eculizumab 300 mg, 600 mg, 900 mg, or 1200 mg will be administered via IV infusion based on 
the patient’s most recently recorded body weight at a prior dosing visit, as presented in Table 15. 
Doses of study drug must only be prepared and dispensed by [CONTACT_9260]. Study 
drug is to be dispensed only to enrolled patients who are confirmed eligible for participation in this study. Once study drug is prepared for a patient, it can only be administered to that patient. 
Vials of study drug are for one-time use only, and any drug product remaining in the vial should 
not be used for another patient. Any drug remaining in the infusion tubing or infusion bag should not be used for another patient. 
Further details on preparation and dose administration of eculizumab, as well as disposal of the 
study drug, can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.2.3. Supplemental Eculizumab Doses in Patients Receiving Ma intenance IVIg 
Treatment  
Maintenance IVIg treatment may interfere with the endosomal neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) 
recycling mechanism of monoclonal antibodies and, thus, may decrease serum eculizumab 
concentrations ( Jin, 2005; Wang, 2008; Fitzpatrick, 2011). Fitzpatrick et al reported that, in adult 
multifocal motor neuropathy, patients receiving cycles of IVIg 1 g/kg over 1 to 5 days and 
repeated on average at 4 -weekly intervals, eculizumab treatment resulted in a significantly lower 
median eculizumab exposure (78.7 μg/mL, interquartile range [IQR] 55–108) compared to 
exposure in patients not receiving IVIg (119.7 μg/mL, IQR 95–147), which translates to an 
approximate median increa se of 50% in the clearance of eculizumab under IVIg co-
administration (Fitzpatrick, 2011).  
Therefore, for pediatric gMG patients receiving maintenance IVIg treatment, a series of 
supplemental doses of eculizumab will be admi nistered to account for the anticipated 
approximately 50% increase in eculizumab clearance. For further details on supplemental 
dosing, please refer to Table  16. In addition, patients are to continue eculizumab infusion 
according to the protocol- specified dosing regimen.

Notes: The timing of supplemental eculizuma b dosing varies by [CONTACT_57744]: 
• If a patient continues to receive IVIg treatment at a dose cycle interval equal to or more 
frequent than every 4 weeks during eculizumab treatment, a supplemental dose will be 
administered at the sam e time that each scheduled dose of eculizumab is administered.  
• If a patient receives IVIg treatment at a dose cycle interval less frequent than every [ADDRESS_62966] dose of 
eculizumab is administered (ie, the total dose is the supplemental dose plus the first scheduled 
dose). 
For patients who enter the study on a stable IVIg maintenance dose regimen, PK/PD samples 
will be analyzed after the first 4 weeks of eculizumab administration for the evaluation of 
eculizumab exposure. If the PK concentration values are greater than 1790 µg/mL (Alexion Internal Report: ECU -MG-Adult PK-PD Modeling Report, Addendum ECU- MG-302), the 
maximum concentration value observed in Studies E CU-MG-[ADDRESS_62967] or waived, as appropriate, so that the predicted maximum PK concentration is below 1790 μg/mL.  
6.2.4. Supplemental Eculizumab Doses Following Re scue Therapy  
When IVIg is administered as acute rescue therapy for clinical deterioration, no supplemental dose of eculizumab should be administered. However, if a patient receives more than [ADDRESS_62968] dose of the second IVIg cycle and at the end of each subsequent IVIg dose cycle within the 12 -week period in accordance with Table  16. 
If a patient undergoes PP/PE/FFP for clinical deterioration during the study, a supplemental dose 
of study drug must be administered within 1 to 2 hours after each PP/PE/FFP session unless the 
PP/PE/FFP session is on the day of a scheduled study drug infusion. If FFP has been administered, a supplemental dose of study drug must be administered 1 hour prior to each

scheduled dose of study drug (instead of the supplemental dose) should be administered within 1 
to 2 hours after the completion of PP/PE/FFP session. For further details on supplemental dosing 
please refer to Table 17. In addition, patients are to continue eculizumab infusion according to

Palliative and supportive care is permitted during the course of the study for underlying 
conditions. Patients may continue to receive AChI, IVIg, and ISTs during the study where 
applicable under certain restrictions. For patients who enter the stud y receiving any background 
therapy, the dose/schedule may not be changed during the Primary Evaluation Treatment Period 
before Week 12, unless deemed necessary per the Investigator based on clinical safety evaluation  
and if Sponsor approval is obtained. Dose change with background medication is permitted after 
Week 12 at the Investigator’s discretion  and with Sponsor notification.  
During the Extension Period, changes in background medications will be permitted at the 
Investigator’s discretion and with Sponsor notification.  
Changes in concomitant medications and/or nondrug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_57709].  
The following additional restrictions apply: 
• Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors

Alexion Confidential  − The following ISTs are allowed during the study: corticosteroid, AZA, MMF, 
MTX, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, or cyclophosphamide. The ISTs and the 
appropriate dose levels to be used for an individual patient will be at the discretion of the treating physician. During the Primary Evaluation Treatment Period, the patient’s IST dose may be adjusted on the basis of 
weight/body-surface/age to account for the child’s growth. 
− High -dose steroid should be reserved for patients that experience clinical 
deterioration as defined by [CONTACT_3181]. Every effort should be made to notify the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of administration should a patient require a rescue 
therapy for clinical deterioration.  
• Intravenous immunoglobulin  
− If a patient enters the study receiving maintenance IVIg, a supplemental dose of study drug will be administered at the first sc heduled dose. Subsequent 
supplemental dosing will be informed as described in Section  6.2.3.  
• Plasma Exchange/Plasmapheresis/Fresh Frozen Plasma (PE/ PP/FFP)  
− Use of PE/PP/FFP will be allowed as rescue therapy for patients who experience a clinical deterioration as defined by [CONTACT_3181]. The rescue therapy used for an 
individual patient will be at the discretion of the treating physician. Every effort 
should be made to notify the Sponsor within 24 hours should a patient require a rescue therapy.  
− If a patient undergoes PE during the study, a supplemental dose of study drug must be administered ( Section  6.2.4 ).  
6.3.2. Disallowed Medications 
The use of rituximab and SC Ig is prohibited during the study. 
6.3.3. Clinical Deterioration and Rescue Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_57710]- study rescue therapy is described in  Section  4.3.1. 
6.3.4. Vaccination  
As with any terminal complement antagonist, the use of eculizumab increases the patient’s 
susceptibility to meningococcal infection ( N meningitidis ). To reduce the risk of mening ococcal 
infection, all patients must be vaccinated against meningococcal infections within the [ADDRESS_62969] be vaccinated or revaccinated according to current national vaccination guidelines or local practice for vaccination use with complement- inhibitors (eg, eculizumab) . 
Vaccines against serotypes A, C, Y, W135, and B, where available, are recommended to prevent common pathogenic meningococcal serotypes.

group.  Due to the length of the Extension Period of this study, patients may be revaccinated for 
appropriate vaccinations based on adherence to the national vaccination recommendations for each age group to provide active coverage according to current medical/coun try guidelines. 
Investigators will assess the need for revaccination, which will be recorded in the source documents and electronic case report form (eCRF).  
6.4. Treatment Compliance 
The infusion of study drug into patients will be under the supervision of the Investigator or their designee to ensure that the patients received the appropriate dose at the appropriate time-points during the study. 
Patients who fail to return for a scheduled visit within the acceptable visit windows (±2 days) 
must be contact[CONTACT_426] t he site study staff to determine the reason for missing the appointment. 
Patients should be strongly encouraged to return to the investigational site for evaluation if 
clinical deterioration or an AE is suspected to have occurred. In the exceptional circumstance, if 
a patient cannot or does not come to the study site for examination, the patient will be instructed to see his or her local neurologist or physician. In this event, the investigational site will (or 
attempt to) obtain relevant medical records as  documentation from the local physician’s 
examination, and enter relevant data in the eCRF as appropriate.  
As it is vital to obtain information on any patient’s missing visit (in -clinic or remote) to assure 
the missing appointment was not due to a clinica l deterioration or an AE, every effort must be 
made to undertake protocol- specified follow -up procedures ( Table  5 and Table  7 based on 
weight cohort). Follow-up due-diligence documentation will consist of 3 phone calls followed by 1 registered letter to the patient’s last  known address, and documented in both the source 
documents and the eCRF. 
Patients should be registered in the IXRS as soon as the Study ECU -MG-303 informed consent 
form (ICF) is signed. The initial shipment of study drug for Study  ECU- MG-303 will be 
trigg ered by [CONTACT_4150]. 
6.5. Continued Access to Study Drug 
After completing the 26 -week Primary Evaluation Treatment Period, patients will continue 
receiving eculizumab in the Extension Period for up to additional 208 weeks.

gross motor (6 items), axial (1 item), and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] (1 item); each graded [ADDRESS_62971] severe ( Appendix 1). The range of total QMG score is 0 to 39. The QMG scoring 
system is considered to be an objective evaluation of therapy for MG and is based on quantitative testing of sentinel muscle groups. The MGFA task force has recommended that the QMG score be used in prospective studies of therapy for MG. 
A modified QMG score has been developed for use in patients younger than 12 years of age that 
will be used for patients aged 6 to 11 years at the time of Screening ( Goldstein , 2015 ; 
Appendix 2). The modified QMG omits the assessment of grip strength and uses a modified 
assessment of swallowing (slurp test) compared  to the traditional QMG, with total scores ranging 
from 0 to 21. In this study, patients will continue to be evaluated based on the QMG scale 
initially completed upon entry into the study. Change in age during the study will not constitute a 
patient changi ng the type of survey completed (ie, a patient who enrolls at age 11 will continue 
being assessed with the modified QMG scale even after he or she reaches 12 years of age).  The 
QMG assessment will be administered at the protocol -specified time points at ap proximately the 
same time of day by a properly trained evaluator, preferably the same evaluator, throughout the 
study. 
7.2. Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living Score 
The MG -ADL is an 8 -point questionnaire that focuses on relevant symptoms and functiona l 
performance of activities of daily living in MG patients (Appendix 3). The 8 items of the MG-ADL were derived from symptom- based components of the original 13- item QMG to assess 
disability secondary to ocular (2 items), bulbar (3 items), respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] (1 item), and gross motor or limb (2  items) impairment related to effects from MG. In this functional status instrument, each 
response is graded 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe). The range of total MG -ADL score is [ADDRESS_62972] visit if the visit interval is 
less than 7 days. The MG -ADL assessment will be administered at the p rotocol- specified time 
points at approximately the same time of day by a properly trained evaluator, preferably the same 
evaluator, throughout the study.  
For patients <12 years of age, caregiver assistance can be provided during the MG -ADL 
assessment.  
7.3. Mya sthenia Gravis Composite Score 
The MGC is a validated assessment tool for measuring clinical status of patients with MG 
(Burns, 2010). The MGC assesses [ADDRESS_62973] frequently affected by 
[CONTACT_4224], and the scales ar e weighted for clinical significance that incorporates patient- reported 
outcomes ( Appendix 4). The range of total MGC score is 0 to 50. Higher score s indicate more 
Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0         Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion)  
[ADDRESS_62974] skilled in the evaluation of MG patients throughout 
the study ( Appendix 11).  
7.5. European Quality of Life 5- Dimension  
The EQ -5D- Y (Appendix 5) is a reliable and validated survey of health status in 5 areas: 
mobility, self- care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, each of which is 
completed by [CONTACT_57745] ≥ 12 years of age (at time of assessment) and completed by [CONTACT_102]’s caregiver or with caregiver assistance for patients <12 years of age ( Szen de, 2014). 
Each area has 3 levels: Level 1 (no problems), Level 2 (some problems), and Level 3 (extreme problems). The EQ visual analogue scale (VAS) records the patient’s self -rated health on a 
vertical, 20 cm VAS where the endpoints are labeled ‘Best imaginable health state, marked as 
100’ and ‘Worst imaginable health state, marked as 0’. Patients will continue to be evaluated based on the survey initially completed upon entry into the study. Change in age during the study will not constitute a patient changing the type of survey completed. Patients who are younger 
than the lowest age range of the survey (ie, patients < 8 years of age) will be evaluated using the 
proxy version of the EQ-5D- Y (Appendix 6). The parent or legal guardian (the proxy) will be 
asked to rate the child’s health -related quality of life in their (the proxy’s) opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The EQ -5D-
Y assessment will be administered at the protocol-specified time points at approximately the 
same time of day throughout the study. 
7.6. Neurological Quality of Life Fatigue Questionnaire 
The Neuro- QoL Pediatric Fatigue questionnaire ( Appendix 7) is a reliable and validated brief 
11-item survey of fatigue, completed by [CONTACT_57745] ≥ 12 years of age (at time of assessment) and completed by [CONTACT_102]’s caregiver or with caregiver assistance f or patients 
<12 years of age ( Cella, 2010).  Higher scores indicate greater fatigue and greater impact of MG 
on activities. Patients will continue to be evaluated based on the survey initially completed upon entry into the study. Change in age during the study will not constitute a patient changing the 
type of survey completed. Patients who are younger than the lowest age range of the applicable scale (ie, patients < 8 years of age) will be evaluated using the PROMIS Parent Proxy Item Bank 
v2.0 – Fatigue – Short Form 10a questionnaire ( Appendix 8). The parent or legal guardian (the 
proxy) will complete the measure on the child’s behalf following administration of these instructions: “The following questionnaires will ask about your child’s symptoms and activity 
levels; his/her ability to think, concentrate and remember things; questions specific to his/her 
condition, and questions related to his/her quality of life. Please answer the following questions based on what you think your child would say.” The Neuro-QoL Pediatric Fatigue questionnaire 
will be administered at the protocol- specified time points at approximately the same time of day 
throughout the study.

Alexion Confidential  8. ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS  
8.1. Myasthenia Gravis Disease Biomarker 
Blood samples for assay of the AChR- Ab will be collected at Screening as specified in the 
Schedules of Assessments ( Section  4.2). 
8.2. Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
Blood samples will be collected at specified time points to study the PK of eculizumab in 
pediatric patients with refractory gMG. Pharmacok inetic parameters such as maximum 
concentration and concentration after the first dose, and during the induction and maintenance 
treatment phase will be obtained. Clearance and terminal half -life will be estimated.  
Blood samples for PD analysis will be collected at specified time points to assess pre-and 
post- treatment serum hemolytic activity and, therefore, C5 complement activity inhibition.  
Baseline PK and PD samples will be collected [ADDRESS_62975] dose. 
For the sample collected at 24  hours, there will be a window of ± [ADDRESS_62976] been collected for the study. The frozen samples may be used for future research related to 
eculizumab. Each sample will be given a code. This code will allow the patient sample to be 
used without the researchers knowing the patient’s name. The results of the research may be presented at scientific meetings or in publications; however, patient identity will not be 
disclosed. All other blood and urine samples collected during the study will be destroyed after 
the tests have been completed.

Alexion Confidential  9. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
The collection of AEs will be monitored from the signing of informed consent until study 
completion. Investigators are instructed to follow any AEs through to their conclusion 
(resolution or stabilization ) as described in Section  9.6.8. In the event of patient withdrawal from 
the study, AE monitoring should continue through the last patient’s last study visit if possible.  
The timing of the clinical and laboratory assessments to be performed is specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments (Section  4.2). Any clinically significant abnormal results should be 
followed until resolution or stabilization.  
9.1. Physical Examinations  
Each examination will include the following assessments: general appearance of skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, lymph nodes, chest, heart, abdomen, extremities, and general neurologic 
system. Physical growth (height [cm], weight [kg]) will be assesse d. The accurate weighing of 
patients is vital as part of their management, as eculizumab dosing will depend on the patient’s 
recorded body weight at the most recent dosing visit. It is recommended that patients should be 
weighed in the same amount of cloth ing in each instance where weight is assessed.  
9.2. Vital Signs 
Vital sign measurements will be taken after the patient has been resting for at least 5 minutes and will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure (millimeters of mercury [mmHg]), heart rate 
(beats/minute), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (breaths/minute), and temperature (degrees Celsius [°C] or degrees Fahrenheit [°F]). Vital signs will be taken prior to each administration of study drug.  
9.3. Laboratory Assessments (Pregnancy Screen, Serum Chemistry, and 
Hematology)  
Samples for urine pregnancy, hematology, and chemistry will be performed at the times 
specified for clinical laboratory tests in the Schedule of Assessments (Section  4.2). Specific 
laboratory assessments are provided in Appendix 12. For clinic visits indicating laboratory 
assessments as req uired, the samples for laboratory assessments will be collected before 
administration of study drug.  
It is anticipated that some laboratory values may be outside the normal value range due to 
underlying disease. The Investigators should use their medical judgment when assessing the 
clinical significance of these values. Clinical significance is defined as any variation in 
laboratory measurements that has medical relevance and that results in a change in medical care. If clinically significant laboratory ch anges from Baseline resulting in medical intervention are 
noted, the changes will be documented as AEs on the AE eCRF. The Investigator will also assess the relationship to study drug for all clinically significant out -of-range values ( Section  9.6.5). 
The Investigator will continue to monitor the patient through additional laboratory assessments 
until (1) values have returned to the normal range or baseline level, or (2) in the judgment of the 
Investigator, values that are outside the normal range are not related to the administration of study drug or other protocol- specific procedures.

Alexion Confidential  9.4. Electrocardiograms  
For each patient, 12- lead digital electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be collected according to the 
Schedule of Assessments (Section  4.2). Patients must be supi[INVESTIGATOR_17044] [ADDRESS_62977] the Medical Monitor to discuss the patient’s continued eligibility to 
participate in this protocol.   
9.5. Immunogenicity 
Blood samples will be collected to test for the presence and titer of ADAs to eculizumab in serum as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Section  4.2). Further characterization of 
antibody responses may be conducted as appropriate, including binding and neutralizing 
antibodies, to PK/PD, safety, and activity of eculizumab.  
Refer to the Laboratory Manual for time windows for sample collection and detai led instructions 
for collecting, processing, storing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_57711]. 
9.6. Adverse Event Management 
9.6.1. Detection of Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for detecting, assessing, documenting, and reporting all AEs. 
Adverse events reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or parent or legal guardian, identified in response to 
an open-ended question from study personnel, or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, 
or other study procedures must be collected and recorded as de scribed in Section  9.6.3. The same 
parent or guardian is recommended to be available to accompany the patient to each visit, in 
order to reduce subjective variability in assessments.  
9.6.2. Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE  is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study patient administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition, in cluding either an increase in 
frequency and/or intensity of the condition, and abnormal laboratory findings that are considered 
to be of clinical significance are all to be considered AEs.  
A medication error (including intentional misuse, abuse, and overdose of the product) or use 
other than what is defined in the protocol is not considered an AE unless there is an untoward 
medical occurrence as a result of a medication error.  
Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0         Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion)  
[ADDRESS_62978] medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or elec tive admission 
to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]), and anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen are not AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Procedure  
Elective procedures that were preplanned prior to the time that written ICF was obtained are not 
AEs. Any complication or worsening of a pre-existing condition leading to the procedure must 
be considered an AE. In addition, any AE that could occur as an outcome of the planned 
procedure should be considered as an AE.  
Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (invasive and noninvasive), such as surgery or 
angiography, should not be reported as an AE or SAE. However, the medical condition or the 
diagnosis that was responsible for the procedure should be recorded. The procedure should be recorded in the narrative as treatment for the AE or SAE (eg,  laparoscopic cholecystectomy is 
the procedure or treatment for an SAE of necrotic gall bladder).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Abnormal Test Findings  
Abnormal test findings may be considered AEs or SAEs; however, Investigators are strongly encouraged to report the diagnosis, sign, or symptom instead of just the abnormal result. The 
criteria for an abnormal test finding being classified as an AE or SAE are as follows:  
• Test result is associated with a sign or symptom  
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing  
• Test result requires a medical or surgical intervention  
• Test result leads to a change in study dosing outside of the protocol defined dosing or 
discontinuation from the study 
• Test result requires significant additional treatment (ie, addition of new medication, significant increase in dose of current medication)  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Lack of Efficacy 
Since eculizumab treatment in pediatric patients with refractory gMG is not an approved 
indication for this popula tion, lack of efficacy should not be reported as an AE. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Development of Myasthenia Gravis Clinical Deterioration 
Normal day -to-day fluctuations of the underlying study indication are not considered an AE 
unless it is so in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]. W orsening of underlying study indication that 
meets the SAE criteria should be reported as an SAE.  
9.6.3. Recording Adverse Events  
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposure to the study drug are to be 
reported within 24 hours of Investigat or/site awareness. Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding 
will be collected for regulatory reporting and safety evaluation.  
Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0         Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion)  
28 Sep 2020 
Page 92 of 123 
Alexion Confidential  All AEs (serious and nonserious) will be collected from the signing of the ICF. An AE reported 
after informed consent but before study drug administration will be considered a pretreatment 
AE. 
Alexion has reporting standards for AEs that are to be followed as described in Section  9.6.8 
regardless of applicable regulatory requirements that may be less stringent.  
9.6.4. Severity Assessment  
The severity (intensity) of an AE will be rated by [CONTACT_57746], moderate, or sev ere 
using the following criteria:  
• Mild: events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the patient’s daily activities.  
• Moderate: events result in a low level of inconvenience or concerns with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with 
functioning. 
• Severe: events interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating.  
Change in severity of an AE should be documented based on specific instructions in the eCRF Completion Guidelines.  
Severity and seriousness must be differentiated. Severity describes the intensity of an AE, while 
the term seriousness refers to an AE that has met the criteria for an SAE (Section  9.6.6 ). 
9.6.5. Causality Assessment  
An Investigator causality assessment (not related or related) must be provided for all AEs, both 
serious and nonserious based upon the Investigator’s medical judgement and the observed 
symptoms associated with the event ( Table  18). This assessment must be recorded in the eCRF 
and any additional forms as appropriate. 
 Table  18: Causality Assessment Descriptions 
Assessment  Description  
Not Related  This relationship suggests that there is no causal association between the 
study drug and the reported event.  
Related  This relationship suggests that there is causal association between the 
investigational product and the reported event  
9.6.6. Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
Any AE that fulfills any [ADDRESS_62979] be recorded as  an SAE. An SAE 
(experience) or reaction is described as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
1. Results in death  
2. Is life -threatening 
Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0         Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion)  
28 Sep 2020 
Page 93 of 123 
Alexion Confidential  NOTE: The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in 
which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may j eopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above. 
The expectedness of an SAE will be determined by [CONTACT_57747], based on the current version of the 
eculizumab IB.  
Information pertaining to the collection and reporting of SAEs is provided in Section  9.6.6. 
9.6.7. Serious Adverse Event With Outcome of Death  
If a patient experiences an SAE with an outcome of death :  
• The SAE resulting in death should have an outcome documented as death/fatal with 
an end date being the date of death. 
• If the patient had additional AE/SAEs that were ongoing at the time of death, these 
events would be documented as ongoing with no end date.  
• Only one event should have an outcome of death/fatal unless an autopsy report or 
Investigator states otherwise.  
9.6.8. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57712]. All admissions to a health care facility meet this criteria, even if less than 24 hours. Criteria for seriousness are also met if transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57713] / surgical care (eg, medical floor to the intensive care unit [ICU]). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]: 
• Rehabilitation facility  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57714]  
• Nursing facility  
• Emergency Room  
• Same day surgery  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57715],

9.6.9. Collection and Reporting of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. All Adverse Events  
All AEs (serious and nonseri ous) will be collected from the signing of the ICF until [ADDRESS_62980] be recorded on the eCRF upon 
the Investigator or his/her staff becoming aware of their occurrence.  
Investigators will be instructed to report the SAE including their assessment (eg, severity, 
seriousness, and potential relatedness to study drug) to Alexion Global Drug Safety (GDS) 
within [ADDRESS_62981].  
If a patient’s treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must clearly 
capture the circumstances and data leading to any such dose interruption or discontinuation of 
treatment in the AE and Exposure pages of the eCRF. 
For patients who enter the trial on maintenance IVIg therapy, IVIg  administered as part of routine 
maintenance therapy in an inpa tient or outpa tient setting should not be captu red as AEs or S AEs, 
unless identified as such by [CONTACT_57748]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs must be recorded regardless of the Investigator’s assessment of causality.  No time 
limit exists on reporting SAEs that are thought to be causally related to the study drug. 
Investigators are at liberty to report SAEs irrespective of causality at any time.  
For all SAEs, the Investigator must provide the following:  
• Appropriate and requested follow- up information in the time frame detailed above  
• Causality of the serious event(s)  
• Seriousness criteria  
• Treatment of/intervention for the SAE(s)  
• Severity  
• Outcome of the serious event(s) 
• Supporting medical records and laboratory/diagnostic information 
All SAEs must be reported to Alexion GDS within [ADDRESS_62982].  
Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0         Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion)  
[ADDRESS_62983] is unavailable at the 
site(s), the SAE must be reported utilizing the paper contingency form via Facsimile 
transmission or email.  
Email:   
Facsimile:   
When further information be comes available, the eCRF should be updated with the new 
information and an updated SAE report should be submitted to Alexion GDS via the Safety 
Gateway.  
If applicable, additional information such as relevant medical records should be submitted to Alexion GDS via the email address or fax number noted above accompanied by [CONTACT_57749]. 
All paper forms and follow -up information submitted to the Sponsor outside of the Safety 
Gateway (eg, discharge summary) should be kept in the appro priate section of the study file.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are serious events that are not listed 
in the IB and that the Investigator identifies as related to the study drug or procedure. United 
States 21 CFR 312.32 and European Union Clinical Study Directive 2001/20/EC and the 
associated detailed guidances or national regulatory requirements in participating countries 
require the reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs. Alexion has procedures that will be followed for the recording 
and expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are consistent with global regulations and the associated detailed guidances. Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the 
national competent authority and IRBs or IECs where applicable.  
9.6.10. Sponsor Reporting Requirements  
Alexion GDS or its legal representative is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory 
authorities of SAEs meeting the reporting criteria. This protocol will use the current eculizumab 
IB as the Reference Safety Document. The expectedness and reporting criteria of an SAE will be 
determined by [CONTACT_57750]. 
9.6.11. Investigator Reporting Requirements  
The Investigator must fulfill all local regulatory obligations required for study Investigators. It is 
the PI’s responsibility to notify the IRB or IEC of all SAEs that occur at his or her site. 
Investigators will also be notified of all S[LOCATION_003]R events that occur during the clinical study. Each site is responsible for no tifying its IRB or IEC of these additional SAEs.  
9.7. Exposure During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding 
Pregnancy data will be collected during this study for all patients and female spouse/partner of male patients. Exposure during pregnancy (also referred to as exposure in  utero) can be the result 
of either maternal exposure or transmission of drug product via semen following paternal exposure. 

Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0         Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion)  
[ADDRESS_62984] 
be recorded and the pregnancy followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (ie, 
spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality), even if 
the patient discontinues study drug or withdraws from the study. 
If a female patient or a patient’s female partner becomes pregnant during the conduct of this 
study, the Investigator must submit the “Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome/Breastfeeding” form 
to Alexion GDS via fax or email (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). When the outcome of the pregnancy becomes 
known, the form should be updated and submitted to Alexion GDS. If additional follow-up is 
required, the Investigator will be requested to provide the information. 
Exposure of an infant to an Alexion product during breastfeeding must also be reported (via the 
“Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome Form/Breastfeeding”) and any AEs experienced by [CONTACT_57751] ( Section  9.6.8).  
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_57716] a contraceptive medication. However, 
complications of pregnancy and abnormal outcomes of pregnancy are AEs and may meet the 
criteria for an SAE (eg, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly). Elective abortions without complications should not be 
reported as AEs.  
9.8. Safety Monitoring  
The Alexion medical monitor, GDS physician, or both will monitor safety data throughout the course of the study. 
Alexion will review all information pertaining to the SAEs within the time frames mandate d by 
[CONTACT_10984]. The Alexion medical monitor will, as appropriate, consult with the GDS 
safety physician, to review trends in safety data.

Alexion Confidential  10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1. General Considerations  
All summary statistics will be computed and displayed by v isit where applicable. Descriptive 
statistics for continuous variables will minimally include the following: n, mean, standard 
deviation, minimum, median, and maximum. For categorical variables, frequencies and 
percentages will be presented. Graphical disp lays will be provided as appropriate. Unless 
otherwise stated, all statistical summaries will be displayed by [CONTACT_57752] (<12 years) and older (12 
to < 18 years) age groups separately and/or combined. A two- sided Type I error of 5% will be 
used for statistical tests unless otherwise stated. The statistical modeling will be performed for the applicable endpoints only for the older age group, as very few patients are anticipated to be enrolled in the younger age group. Study data will be summarized by [CONTACT_57753]. 
All study data collected on the CRF and from other sources will be listed for individual patients. 
Baseline will be defined as the last non -missing value on or prior to first dose of eculizumab, 
unless otherwise stated. No imputation will be performed for missing efficacy data.  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed and finalized prior to the primary analysis and will provide further details. The primary analysis will be conducted when all patients have completed the 26- week Primary Evaluation Treatment Period or discontinued prior to the 
completion of the Primary Evaluation Treatment Period. This analysis will include all efficacy, safety, and PK/PD study data for regulatory submission purpose. Section  10.12 outlines the plan 
for subsequent interim analyses and the final analysis. Another SAP will be developed and 
finalized prior to the completion of the entire study (including the Extension Period). 
Analyses will be performed using the SAS
® software Version 9.4 or higher. 
10.2. Hypotheses 
The null and alternative hypotheses related to primary endpoint for this study is described as: 
𝐻𝐻0:𝜇𝜇= 0 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 .𝐻𝐻1:𝜇𝜇 ≠ 0, 
where 𝜇𝜇 represents the mean improvement in QMG from Baseline over time regardless of rescue 
under null and alternate hypotheses. 
10.3. Determination of Sample Size 
The sample size will be determined to ensure adequate power for testing the primary endpoint 
for this stu dy in the older age group. The assumptions regarding change from Baseline in QMG 
and MG-ADL scores were based on the subset of a younger patient population treated with 
eculizumab in Studies ECU- MG-301 and ECU- MG-302.  
Based on eleven younger (<25 years) patients from those studies, the mean and SD were 
calculated at both 12 and 26 weeks of eculizumab exposure ( Table  19).

improvement in QMG total score at Week 26 with mean (SD) of 9 (7), a total of 10 patients will 
provide approximately 95% power to detect a statistically significant improvement in QMG total 
score from Baseline. Similarly, assuming an improvement in MG -ADL total score at Week 26 
with mean (SD) of 7 (5), a total of 10 patients will provide approximately 97% power. Likewise, 
based on a two-sided one- sample t -test with a significance level of 0.05 and assuming an 
improvement in QMG total score at Week 12 with mean (SD) of 9 (7), a total of 10 patients will 
provide approximately 95% power to detect a statistically significant improvement in QMG total 
score from Baseline. Similarly, assuming an improvement in MG -ADL total score at Week 12 
with mean (SD) of 6 (5), a total of 10 patients will provide approximately 92% power.  
Assuming a loss of 15% of patients due to not meeting evaluability criteria, a total of at least [ADDRESS_62985] 10 evaluable patients.  There  will be no statistical considerations to determine the number 
of patients to be enrolled in the younger age group. Section  10.3.1 provides additional 
information about sample size re -estimation.  
In addition, a maximum of 6 patients on maintenance IVIg aged 12 to < [ADDRESS_62986] 
12 months and on a stable dose ≥ [ADDRESS_62987] 1 patient in each geographic region (North America, EU, 
and APAC). There is no cap on patients 6 to  < 12 years of age.  
10.3.1. Interim Monitoring of Variability and Sample Size Re -assessment  
Since the estimates provided in Table  19 are based on a small number of patients and it is 
unknown whether the variability in change in QMG in this study population is consistent with 
patients aged ≥ [ADDRESS_62988] 14 patients instead of 12 patients to preserve adequate 
power for testing the primary and endpoint. 
10.4. Analysis Sets 
10.4.1. Full Analysis Set  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which consists of all 
patients who received at least 1 dose of eculizumab . A subset of the FAS that includes older

QMG total score will be conducted at Week [ADDRESS_62989] of eculizumab treatment during the Primary Evaluatio n Treatment Period after the 12 weeks during which MG 
medications (ie, ISTs, IVIg) are continued at a stable dose. The Paediatric Committee of the European Medicines Agency (PDCO)- specific primary efficacy analysis will be conducted at 
Week 26. The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the mFAS. A Repeated -Measures 
model will be used to analyze observed change in QMG with baseline QMG score and visits as covariates. The least -squares mean at Week [ADDRESS_62990] the primary hypothesis at a 
significance level of 5%. The least -squares mean at Week [ADDRESS_62991] the 
PDCO-specific primary hypothesis at a significance level of 5%. The standard error of the mean and 95% confidence interval will be produced. Missing primary endpoints at post -baseline visits 
will not be imputed.

Alexion Confidential  11. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a patient into the study, a representative of the Sponsor or 
its designee will visit the investigational study site to:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the Investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard 
to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s 
designee or its representatives. This will be documented in a Clinical Study 
Agreement between Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or its designee and the Investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from the Sponsor or its designee or representative will have regular contacts with the investigational site, to:  
• Provide information and support to the Investigator(s) 
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigatio nal team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the eCRFs, and that study drug accountability checks are being 
performed  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRFs 
with the patient ’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each patient (eg, clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to the Sponsor or its 
designee.  
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to the Sponsor or its designee and those SAEs that met 
criteria for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB/IEC.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the Investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
11.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s designee, a regulatory authority, and an IEC or an IRB may visit the sites to perf orm audits or inspections, including source data 
verification. The purpose of an audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were 
conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, 
GCP guidelines of the ICH, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The Investigator should 
contact [CONTACT_57756]’s designee immediately if contact[CONTACT_426] a regulatory agency about an inspection.

Alexion Confidential  ICF prior to the performance of any protocol procedures and prior to the administration of study 
drug.  
The PI(s) must maintain the original, signed ICF. If the ICF is amended, the original signed, 
amended version must also be retained. A copy of the signed ICF must be given to the patient and/or parental guardian.  
The same parent or guardian is recommended to be available to accompany the child to each 
study visit, in order to reduce subjective variability i n assessments.  
As used in this protocol, the term “informed consent” includes all informed assent given by 
[CONTACT_1962], informed permission by [CONTACT_57760], or, as applicable, informed consent by 
[CONTACT_57761].  
11.7. Data Protection 
The following measures will be implemented for the protection of patients’ personal data:  
• Each patient  will be assigned a unique identifier. Any patient records or datasets that 
are transferred to Alexion will contain the identifier only; patien t names or any 
information that would make a patient identifiable will not be transferred.  
• The patient and/or parental guardian must be informed that the patient’s personal study-related data will be used by [CONTACT_57762]. The level of disclosure must also be explained to the patient and/or parental 
guardian, as well as a notice of the collection, use, and storage of the personal data through the informed consent or other privacy notice in accordance with local data 
protection law.  
• The p atient and/or parental guardian must be informed that the  patient’s  medical 
records may be examined by [CONTACT_57763], by [CONTACT_6667]/IEC members, and by [CONTACT_57764]. 
11.8. Changes or Deviations to Protocol  
The Investigator ma y need to deviate from the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to a 
study subject without prior notification of the IRB/IEC. Any deviations from the protocol must be fully documented. The deviation and the reasons for it should be submitted to the IR B/IEC, 
Sponsor, and appropriate regulatory authority if required (ICH GCP E6 [R1] 4.5.4). After the commencement of the clinical study, the Sponsor may make changes to the protocol. If those changes are significant, the regulatory authority and applicable IRB/IEC will be notified.  
11.9. Data Handling and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
11.9.1. Inspection of Records

Alexion Confidential  APPENDIX 13. COLLECTION OF FOLLOW -UP INFORMATION FROM 
PATIENTS WHO WITHDRAW FROM THE STUDY 
To gain understanding of the patient’s post- treatment disease status, the Sponsor may request 
additional Post- Treatment Follow -up information from patients who discontinue prematurely for 
up to 1 year following discontinuation. An ICF (and/or an ICF Addendum) will be provided to 
all patients and/or the parent or other legal guardian (as applicable) describing the reason for 
collecting follow -up information, the information that will be collected, and how the information 
will be used. The ICF (and/or ICF Addendum) will clearly state that the patient and/or the parent 
or legal guardian has the option to accept or reject, and that either decision will have no impact 
on their medical benefits. Prior to collecting any follow -up information, the ICF (and/or ICF 
Addendum) must be signed. 
The Sponsor may obtain patient post- treatment data  by [CONTACT_57766]’s medical records, 
through the study physician or the patient’s current treating physician. The follow-up data to be 
collected from the physician may include the following:  
• How has the patient’s MG status changed since they left S tudy ECU- MG-303 
(better/worse/unchanged); if better or worse, what are the changes?  
• What are the patient’s current MG medications and the doses, and MG medication 
history since leaving Study ECU- MG-303? 
• Has the patient experienced any exacerbations (clinical deteriorations) of MG, or any 
myasthenic crises since leaving Study ECU -MG-303; if so how many times? 
• Has the patient experienced any MG -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57724]- MG-303; if so how many times 
• Has the patient required rescue treatment with IV acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, 
corticosteroids, plasma exchange or IVIg since leaving Study ECU- MG-303; if so 
how many times 
• Has the patient had any assessments using the MG -ADL, QMG, MGC, Neuro -QoL 
Fatigue or EQ -5D- Y scale; if so, what are the results, and was it administered by [CONTACT_57767] 
• Have there been any changes in non-drug therapy. 
This information will not be entered into the trial Electronic Data Capture systems and will not 
be par t of any safety or efficacy analysis that will be included in the ECU -MG-303 clinical study 
report.

The HILIO Trial: High vs. L ow Oxytocin Dosing for  Induction of labor 
in Pregnant Patients with Obesity 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_507734] [ADDRESS_655085] suggested that women with obesity may be 
less responsive to oxytocin. This trial wil l compare a high and low dose oxytocin dosing 
regimen for the induction of labor in women with obesity.  
 
1.2  Hypothesis 
 
A higher oxytocin dosing regim en (increase by 6 mU/min every 30 minutes) will result in  
a decreased risk of cesarean delivery compared to a lower oxytocin dosing regimen 
(increase by 2 mU/min every 30 minutes) in nulliparous women with a pre- pregnancy 
body mass index ≥30 kg/m2 undergoing induction of labor at >37 weeks gestation.  
 
 
2. BACKGROUND  
2.1 Introduction 
It is estimated that nearly 40% of reproductive- aged women in the [LOCATION_002] (U.S.) 
are obese,1,2 and rates of obesity are projected to further increase over the next 
decade.3 Maternal obesity, defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2, is a major risk 
factor for adverse obstetric outcomes. It has been suggested that the dramatic rise in 
the prevalence of obesity is, at least in part, responsible for the increase in the cesarean 
delivery rate that has observed over the past [ADDRESS_655086] shown that there is a dose response relationship 
between increasing maternal BMI and risk of cesarean delivery.8,9,11 In a large 
multicenter U.S. study, Kominiarek  et al. reported that there was a 5% increase in the 
risk of cesarean for each 1- kg/m2 increase in maternal BMI among both laboring 
nulliparous and multiparous women without a prior cesarean delivery.8 Among 
nulliparous women with cephalic term fetuses who underwent labor, rates of cesarean 
delivery were 11.1%, 17.7%, 25.1%, 33.0%, and 42.8% for women with delivery BMI <25.0 kg/m
2, 25.0- 29.0 kg/m2, 30.0- 34.9 kg/m2, 35.0- 39.9 kg/m2, and ≥40 kg/m2, 
respectively. Furthermore, the association between increasing maternal BMI and 
cesarean delivery was shown to be independent of age, race, diabetes status, cervical 
dilation at admission, and induction of labor.  
In general, labor progresses more slowly among women with obesity. In a cohort study 
of women who succes sfully achieved complete cervical dilation, Norman et al. found 
that the median duration of time for a women to progress from 4 cm dilation to 10 cm  was significantly longer in obese compared to non- obese women (4.7 hours vs 4.1 
hours, p <0.01).
[ADDRESS_655087] compared to non- obese (47% vs 33%).[ADDRESS_655088] stage of labor during which the 
cervix dilates; once women reach complete dilation, rates of cesarean are similar 
among women with and without obesity.18  
While there is strong epi[INVESTIGATOR_507735], the biologic mechanisms underlying this association are largely 
unknown. One leading theory is that maternal obesity is leads impaired myometrial 
contractility.19 Differences in the pharmacokinetics of drugs commonly used for labor 
induction and augmentation in obese and non- obes e women may also contribute to the 
association between maternal BMI and labor outcomes.20-22 With these potential 
biological factors in mind, and the significant individual and public health benefits that would be gained by [CONTACT_507739], 
research focused on the clinical relationship between the medications used to stimulate 
labor and obstetric outcomes among women with obesity is needed.  
2.3 Oxytocin Dosing in Labor  
2.3.1 High vs. Low Dosing Regimens 
Induction of l abor, defined as the artificial initiation of labor before spontaneous  labor  
onset , is performed in approximately 30% of all births.[ADDRESS_655089] commonly used agent for the induction and augmentation of labor since being 
introduced into the market in the 1950’s.23,[ADDRESS_655090] evaluated the dose of oxytocin for labor 
augmentation. In a systematic review and meta- analysis of 4 studies including 644 
women published in 2013, higher dose oxytocin regimens were associated with lower rates of cesarean delivery and shorter duration of labor compared to lower dose 
regimens.
26 However, the results of a large single center trial comparing high -dose (6 
mu/min) compared to low -dose (2 mu/min) regimens for augmentation of labor that 
included over [ADDRESS_655091] those having augmentation, not 
induction.  
The question of oxytocin dosing for induction of labor –  let alone among obese 
individuals – has been less well studied. In 2014, Budden et al. conducted a systematic 
review and meta- analysis to address this clinical question.28 Nine clinical trials involving 
2391 women were included in the review. They found no differences in rates of cesarean or time from induction to delivery among women randomized to high- dose 
compared to low- dose oxytocin infusion regimens, but reported higher -dose regimens 
were associated with an increase in the incidence of “hyperstimulation”.  However, the 
studies included in the review were heterogeneous, specifically with regards to the 
dosing regimen used and population studied. In fact, the only study in the review that 
was published in the past [ADDRESS_655092] common drug used in induction of labor. Women with a higher BMI seem to be 
less responsive to oxytocin. In one retrospective study of women who reached the 
second stage of labor, only 2.6% of women with BMI <30 kg/m2 required maximum 
oxytocin doses >20 mu/min compared to 4.3% of women with BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2.[ADDRESS_655093] that women 
with obesity require higher doses of oxytocin, and are a group who would preferentially benefit from higher oxytocin dosing regimens.  
2.3.3 Oxytocin Safety 
The use of oxytocin in the [LOCATION_002] is ubiquitous, with 78% of women receiving it 
during labor in one large multicenter study.
32 Nevertheless, intravenous oxytocin is 
labeled as a “high alert” medication by [CONTACT_507740] .33 This 
risk category was assigned to oxytocin due to risks related to infusion including 
maternal risks of uterine tachysystole, water intoxication with prolonged use, and fetal 
risks including intrauterine heart rate changes and neonatal acidemia at birth.  Yet, these 
outcomes are rare. In a recently published large randomized trial of high-  versus low -
oxytocin  regimens for labor augmentation, no differences in neonatal outcomes were 
reported.27 
2.4 Rationale for Randomized Trial  
There is a general consensus that the current cesarean delivery rate of 31% in the [LOCATION_002] is higher than it ought to be.
5,[ADDRESS_655094] that women with obesity may benefit from receiving 
higher doses of oxytocin to achieve a vaginal delivery. Thus, a rigorous trial investigating 
the optimal dosing of oxytocin in obese women is needed.  
 
3. STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Primary Research Question 
This double blinded randomized controlled trial will address the primary research 
question:  
Does a high- dose oxytocin regimen reduce the chance of cesarean delivery compared 
to a low- dose oxytocin regimen among nulliparous women with obesity undergoing 
induction of labor at 37 weeks’ gestation or later? 
 
 
3.2 Design Summary This study is a pragmatic single center randomized, double blinded controlled trial. 
Nulliparous women with a pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m
2 undergoing 
induction of labor at ≥370 weeks’ gestation will be eligible for enrollment. Women will be 
randomly allocated to receive oxytocin using either a high- dose or low -dose regimen. 
Patients, providers, and research staff will be blinded to the dosing regimen.  
High-dose oxytocin regimen: Starting dose 6 mU/min and increased by 6 mU/min every 
30 minutes until adequate contractions achieved, at the discretion of the obstetric 
providers.  
Low-dose oxytocin regimen: Starting dose 2 mU/min and increased by 2 mU/min every 
30 minutes until adequate contractions achieved,  at the discretion of the obstetric 
providers.  
Adequate contractions will be defined as >200 Montevideo units averaged over 30 minutes in women w ith an intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC), or contractions every 
2-3 minutes in women without an IUPC.  
3.3 Blinding 
Participants, research staff, and clinical care providers will be blinded to the dosing 
regimen. This will be achieved by [CONTACT_507741]. In the low -dose group, the oxytocin solution will be 
prepared using 30 units of oxytocin in 500 mL of normal saline (concentration 60 
mU/mL). The oxytocin concentration in the hi gh-dose group will be prepared using 90 
units of oxytocin in 500 mL of normal saline (180 mU/mL). The study drug in both groups will be administrated at a rate of 2 mL/hour with an increase in rate of 2 mL/hour 
every 30 minutes.

3.5 Informed Consent Criteria  
Written informed consent will be obtained prior to randomization into the study. The 
details of the study will also be reviewed with the patient by [CONTACT_2710]. 
Participants will be provided with a signed copy of the consent form.  
3.6 Randomization  
Patients will be approached for possible enrollment in the study when they are admitted 
to the labor and delivery unit for induction of labor. Women who chose to participate in 
the study will be randomized to the high-  or low -dose oxytocin regimen prior t o the 
initiation of oxytocin in the labor course. Women will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the high and low -dose oxytocin regimens.  
A block randomization method will be used to generate the randomization sequence 
because it provides a high probability of balance of treatment assignments. A computer -
generated randomization scheme using block sizes of four will be designed by [CONTACT_4305]. The randomization sequence will be provided to the investigational 
pharmacy staff who will prepare the study  drug for each participant.  
 
4. STUDY PROCEDURES 
4.1 Screening for Eligibility and Consent  
Women who are admitted for delivery to the Ohio State University Wexner Medical 
Center Labor & Delivery unit will be screened for potential enrollment. The inclusion/ 
exclusion criteria will be reviewed in the patient’s medical record and documented on 
the screening log.  
If the patient meets all eligibility criteria for enrollment, then she will be approached by 
[CONTACT_507742]. Patients may be approached any time 
after admission to the Labor & Delivery unit, but prior to the initiation of oxytocin for 
labor induction. If the patient is interested in enrollment, the informed consent process 
will be conducted by [CONTACT_7628]. The study consent and HIPAA authorization 
will be signed after all questions have been discussed and answered. The participant 
will be given a copy of the signed consent form.  
4.2 Randomization  
Randomization will occur when the obstetric provider decides t o begin oxytocin for labor 
induction. At that time, the patient will be assigned the next sequential study 
identification number and central pharmacy will dispense the study drug (high-  or low -
dose oxytocin concentration) depending on the randomization all ocation sequence. The 
pharmacist will not be blinded to the allocation.

6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 6.1 Data Relevant to the Primary Outcome 
Using institutional data collected for a retrospective study evaluating the relationship 
between BMI and labor management, we estimated that the cesarean delivery rate 
among nulliparous obese women who labored was 31.6%. This is a similar rate to what 
has been reported in the literature.
[ADDRESS_655103] oxytocin dosing at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center 
uses the low -dose regimen.  
6.2  Sample Size  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_507738] a future large randomized controlled trial. We plan to enroll 20 participants today. Ten participants will be 
randomized to the high- dose and 10 participants randomized to the low -dose oxytoci n 
dosing regimen.  
 
6.3  Feasibility 
Based on internal institutional quality metric data, there were approximately 250 
nulliparous women with prepregnancy BMI ≥30 kg/m
2 who underwent induction of labor 
at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in 2020. If 40% of obese women undergoing induction meet other eligibility criteria and agree to participate in the study, 
then we would anticipate complete the pi[INVESTIGATOR_48505] a total sample size of 20 women 
in 10 weeks.  
Information about the proportion of eligible women who agree to participant in the study will be used to determine the feasibility of a larger clinical trial.  
6.4 Analysis Plan 
All analyses will be performed based on the intent -to-treat principle. The primary 
outcome will be assessed by [CONTACT_507746]. Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals will be 
calculated. Similarly, secondary outcomes will be assessed using the chi -square and 
Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables. Continuous variables will be assessed for normality and compared using a Student’s t -test or Mann Whitney U test as appropriate.

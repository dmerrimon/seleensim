61.BACKGROUND
1.1 Study Disease
Administration of exogenous testosterone as efficacious treatment for male hypogonadism has been 
part of medical practice for more than 50 years . Testosterone is an anabolic steroid and the primary 
male sex hormone promoting development of male reproductive tissues such as prostate and testis. 
Several androgen replacement modalities are FDA approved and commercially available or are under 
clinical investigation. These include intramuscular injection of testosterone esters, subcutaneous 
implants, transdermal patches, oral tablets and capsules, buccal and sublingual dosage forms, 
implantable T microspheres, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_98787] 5α-dihydrotestosterone  
(DHT).
 It can activate androgen receptors in its unchanged form or it can be converted to 5α-
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by [CONTACT_98804] 5 α reductase before binding to the androgen receptor. 
Once bound, the receptor-hormone complex moves into the cell nucleus altering specific gene 
sequences on the cellular DNA and modifying its transcription, therefore promoting protein 
synthesis and thus growth of tissues that are sensible to its action.1    
Hypogonadism, or low testosterone (Low T), is the deficiency in producing testosterone by [CONTACT_244058]. Low T affects more than 10% of men worldwide, with high incidence in the elderly (Haring, 
et al., 2010). It occurs in association with aging, chronic disease, or other modifiable risk factors 
such as obesity and diabetes.[ADDRESS_296776] been shown to associated with less 
muscle mass3, lower bone mineral density4, lower hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations5, 
smaller prostate glands6, and diminished energy and sexual function than normal men.7,8
1.2 Study Interventions
Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is becoming more widely available and has seen a greater 
than three-fold increase in use men 40 years and older.9 Current delivery systems of TRT include 
transdermal gels and patches10, injection therapy11, and long acting subcutaneous pellets.12 TRT 
has been shown to improve bone mineral density, prostate volume, energy, and sexual function.8 
Testosterone pellets is a long-acting formulation of TRT that is delivered subcutaneously to men 
diagnosed with low T. This method of administration has the potential to avoid side effects related 
to TRT that are commonly seen with other delivery methods, daily topi[INVESTIGATOR_98789] a 
risk of transfer of testosterone to partners and family members as well as a short half-life of 
injectable and intranasal products. A recent study showed that this medication is well tolerated 
with very low adverse events and discontinuation rates among patients. 11
Treatment was well tolerated; adverse event rates werelow. Adverse event discontinuation rates were 2.1% (b.i.d.) and 3.7% (t.i.d.)Treatment was well tolerated; adverse event rates werelow. Adverse event discontinuation rates were 2.1% (b.i.d.) and 3.7% (t.i.d.)

more consistent, and longer maintenance of testosterone levels within the therapeutic range. 
Our hypothesis Pellets provide sustained eugonadal T levels for 3–6 months with not significant 
difference between Testopel ® and compound subcutaneous testosterone. 
2. HYPOTHESIS
2.1 Alternate hypothesis
Treatment groups will show a sustainable testosterone value between 300ng/dl and 1000 ng/dl 
from baseline in patients with low T, to [ADDRESS_296779]-therapy. 
2.2 Null Hypothesis
There is no difference between the patient receiving Testopel ® vs Subcutaneous compound 
testosterone pellets. 
3. OBJECTIVES
3.1 Primary Efficacy Objective
Primary outcomes will be changes in Testosterone (T) from baseline, 2 month, 4 month and 6 
month.
3.2 Secondary Efficacy Objective
We will evaluate changes in Hematocrit (HCT), Estrogen (E) and PSA from baseline to 2 month, 
4 month and 6 months.
4. STUDY DESIGN
4.1 Accrual goal
A total of 120 patients with low testosterone (<300ng/dL) on 2 measurements meeting the 
eligibility criteria will be recruited from the Department of Urology clinic. 
4.2 Duration of Study Participation

EVALUATIONS
7.1 Study Design 
This is a prospective, Phase 3, randomized, clinical study aimed to evaluate comparison between 
Testopel ® vs subcutaneous compounded testosterone for men with low testosterone. Subjects will 
be enrolled in the study based on selection criteria designed to represent the general population of 
hypogonadal men while minimizing risk to study participants. Approximately 120 subjects will be 
enrolled to meet scientific and regulatory objectives. After meeting the selection criteria, the 
subjects will be randomly assigned in 1:1:1 ratio such that 40 subjects will receive Testopel,  40 
subjects will receive Compounded testosterone pellets  (8 pellets with 100mg pellets) once and 40 
subjects will receive compounded testosterone pellets (4 pellets with 200mg pellets) once and will 
be followed for [ADDRESS_296784] visit of the patients will be for screening and medical evaluation. Patient’s medical co-
medication history will be collected and documented and a physical examination will be 
performed. 
Previous month’s blood test results will be reviewed including a general chemistry panel and 
Testosterone levels during chart review.
Patients will sign an informed consent and in case they meet all inclusion criteria (and do not meet 
any exclusion criteria), they will be recruited to the study. 
7.[ADDRESS_296785] 120 subjects who meet all the entry criteria will be randomized 1:1:1 such that

the Compounded treatment arm (200mg pellets),  (Randomization will be performed by a 
computer software maintained by [CONTACT_85272]). Patients randomized to the 
treatment group will be instructed to stop any use of androgen replacement therapy for 4 weeks

7.4 Treatment procedures
Clean and numb the insertion site with lidocaine at 1%, followed by [CONTACT_244059], 
implantation of pellets into subdermal fat layer and sealing the incision with Steri-strip. This is the 
current standard of care of Testopel insertion and same procedure will be followed with both 
compounded and commercial pellets. 
7.5 Follow-Up Procedures and Evaluations:
Follow-up visits will be conducted at 2, 4. 6 months, these visits shall include: 
Taking serum T, HCT, E, PSA levels. 
Reporting and recording adverse events at every follow-up visit.
7.6 Reimbursement 
Once the patient is included into the trial, the sponsor company (Empower pharmacy) will 
reimburse $75 for participation. Once randomized, the sponsor company (Empower Pharmacy) 
will provide one time treatment “Testopel or Compounded Testosterone” based on the results of 
randomization.

11. INVESTIGATORS RESPONSIBLITIES
11.1 Investigator Responsibility/Performance
The investigator (or a person designated by [CONTACT_093]) should inform the patient of all 
pertinent aspects of the study, including the written information.
The investigator should provide the patient ample time and opportunity to inquire about details of 
the study and to decide whether to participate in the study or not.  All questions about the study 
should be answered to the satisfaction of the patient. Neither the investigator, nor the study staff, 
should coerce or unduly influence a patient to participate or to continue to participate in a study.
11.3 Confidentiality
The identity of the patients in this study will be treated as confidential. Patients eligible to 
participate in the study following the pre-treatment visit will be assigned a unique patient code.

The investigator or designee must explain to the subject before enrollment into the study that for 
evaluation of study results, the subject’s protected health information obtained during the study 
may be shared with the study sponsor, regulatory agencies, and the IRB.  It is the investigator’s

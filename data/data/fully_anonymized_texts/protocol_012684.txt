2Rationale for Amendment 04
This document describes changes in reference to the protocol incorporating Amendment 04. 
The primary reason for this amendment is to employ overall survival (OS) as the primary 
endpoint of the study. OS is a clearly defined endpoint that is commonly used in studies with patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic 
leukemia (CMML) and low-blast acute myeloge nous leukemia (AML). Event-free survival 
(EFS), the previous primary endpoint of the study, is now a secondary endpoint. These
changes affect the objectives and endpoints of the study. The protocol was also amended to clarify definitions of response, duration of th e study, and concomitant medication therapy, 
and to update the metabolism profile of pevonedistat and the statistical analysis plan for the 
study.
Throughout the protocol where text previously read “HR MDS or CMML patients” and 
“low-blast AML patients,” text now reads “patients with HR MDS or CMML” and “patients 
with low-blast AML.”
Minor grammatical, editorial, formatting, and administrative changes not affecting the 
conduct of the study are included for clarification and administrative purposes only. 
For specific descriptions of text changes, the rationale for each change, and where the 
changes are located, see Section 15.13.

4PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Study Title: A Phase 2, Randomized, Controlled, Open -Label, Clinical Study of the Efficacy and 
Safety of Pevonedistat Plus Azacitidine Versus Single -Agent Azaci tidine in Patients With Higher -
Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia, and Low -Blast Acute 
Myelogenous Leukemia
Number of Patients: It is expected that approximately 117 patients will be enrolled in this study.
Study Objectives
Primary
To determine in patients with higher -risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR MDS) or chronic 
myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and low -blast acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)
whether the combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine improves overall survival ( OS)when 
compared with single -agent azacitidine.
Secondary
To determine in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low -blast AML whet her the 
combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine improves event -free survival (EFS) when 
compared with single -agent azacitidine; for patients with HR MDS or CMML, an event is 
defined as death or transformation to AML; for patients with low -blast AML, an event is 
defined as death.
To determine in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low -blast AML whether the 
combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine improves 6 -month and 1 -year survival rates 
when compared with single -agent azacitidine.
To determine in patients with HR MDS or CMML whether the combination of pevonedistat 
and azacitidine delays time to AML transf ormation when compared with single -agent 
azacitidine.
To determine in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low -blast AML whether the 
combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine, when compared with single -agent azacitidine, 
improves the rate of complete remissi on (CR) (composite CR [CR+ CRi ]in patients with 
low-blast AML), CR plus partial remission (composite CR + PR for patients with low -blast 
AML), overall response, and/or CR (not including CRi) in low -blast AML. Overall response 
in HR MDS or CMML is defined as CR + PR + hematologic improvement (HI); overall 
response in low -blast AML is defined as CR + CRi + PR.
To determine in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low -blast AML whether the 
combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine, when compared with single -agent azacitidine, 
improves the rate of CR (composite CR [CR + C Ri] in patients with low -blast AML), CR + 
PR (composite CR + PR in patients with low -blast AML), the overall response rate (ORR), as 
well as CR (not including CRi) in low -blast AML by [CONTACT_51199] 4.
Todeter mine in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low -blast AML whether the 
combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine, when compared with single -agent azacitidine, 
improves duration of CR (composite CR [CR + C Ri] in patients with low -blast AML), CR + 
PR (co mpos ite CR + PR in patients with low -blast AML), overall response, and/or CR (not 
including CRi) in patients with low -blast AML.

when compared with single-agent azacitidine.
!To determine in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low-blast AML whether the combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine delays time to subsequent therapy when 
compared with single-agent azacitidine. Subsequent therapy is defined as agent(s) with antileukemic/anti–myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) activity (eg, cytarabine, anthracyclines, 
purine analogues, and hypomethylating agents other than azacitidine). Patients who 
discontinue study treatment to receive single-agent azacitidine off study would not be counted as receiving subsequent therapy.
!To determine in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low-blast AML whether the combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine improves rate of transfusion independence when 
compared with single-agent azacitidine. Red blood cell (RBC) or platelet transfusion 
independence requires that the patient receive no RBC or platelet transfusions, respectively, for a period of at least 8 weeks.
!To determine in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low-blast AML whether the combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine reduces the percent of patients who have at least 
one inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063](s) related to HR MDS, CMML, or low-blast AML when 
compared with single-agent azacitidine.
!To determine in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low-blast AML whether the combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine delays time to disease progression (progressive disease; PD), relapse, or death when compared with single-agent azacitidine. 
!To evaluate in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low-blast AML, the safety of the combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine when compared with single-agent azacitidine.
!To collect in patients with HR MDS or CMML and low-blast AML plasma concentration-time data for pevonedistat to contribute to future population pharmacokinetic 
(PK) analyses of pevonedistat.

Clinical Study Protocol Pevonedistat-[ADDRESS_53790]: 2015-000221-37
6Overview of Study Design: This study is a multicenter, global, randomized, controlled, open-label, 
phase [ADDRESS_53791] not previously received a hypomethylating agent.
Once enrolled, patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive study drug (either single-agent 
azacitidine or the combination of pevonedistat and azacitidine) in 28-day treatment cycles. All 
patients will be stratified into 4 categories: low-blast AML, Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) risk group of very high, high, or intermediate for MDS/CMML [2]. All patients 
will receive azacitidine (75 mg/m
2[intravenous or subcutaneous]) on Days 1 through 5, Day 8, and 
Day 9. Patients randomized to the combination arm will also receive pevonedistat (20 mg/m2via 
60-minute infusion) on Days 1, 3, and 5 of each cycle. Dose modifications may be allowed.
Patients, including those who achieve a CR, may receive study treatment until they experience 
unacceptable toxicity, relapse, transformation to AML, or progressive disease as defined in this 
study.
Patients with HR MDS or CMML may be allowed to continue study treatment (either treatment arm) 
if they meet the criteria for progressive disease based only on bone marrow blast count (without 
AML transformation) if, in the clinical judgment of the investigator, the patient is still receiving clinical benefit from this treatment and the continuation is endorsed by [CONTACT_456]’s project 
clinician (or designee). Patients with low-blast AML in this study may also be allowed to continue 
study treatment (either treatment arm), even if they meet the criteria for progressive disease based only on bone marrow blast counts, if, in the clinical judgment of the investigator, the patient is still receiving clinical benefit from this treatment, and the continuation is endorsed by [CONTACT_456]’s 
project clinician (or designee). Patients who meet the criteria for PD and continue on study under 
these conditions must be reconsented before continuing study treatment. Patients may choose to discontinue at any time. 
Patients will attend the End-of-Treatment (EOT) visit 30 days (+10 days) after the last dose of study 
drug or before the start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy if that occurs sooner. Patients will enter 
EFS follow-up (for patients with HR MDS/CMML) or response follow-up (for patients with 
low-blast AML), with study visits every 3 months, to include physical exam, clinical blood tests, 
HRQOL assessments, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51105], bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_51106], and disease assessment, if their disease has not transformed from HR MDS or CMML to AML (for patients with HR MDS or CMML) or progressed (for patients with low-blast AML), and they have not started 
subsequent therapy. Patients will enter OS follow-up (contact[CONTACT_457] 3 months to document CCI

patient with HR MDS or CMML) or experienced progressive disease (patients with low-blast AML) 
or have started subsequent therapy.
Disease response assessments for all HR MDS/CMML patients will be based on the Modified 
International Working Group (IWG) response criteria for MDS [3]. Disease response assessments for 
patients with low-blast AML will be based on the Revised Recommendations of the IWG for 
Diagnosis, Standardization of Response Criteria, Treatment Outcomes, and Reporting Standards for 
Therapeutic Trials in Acute Myeloid Leukemia [4]. Formal disease assessments for study endpoints 
will be determined based on local bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_51108], and central lab 
data (local lab data may be used for time-sensitive clinical decisions). 
Bone marrow samples (biopsy and/or aspir ate) will be collected at Screening, during treatment, and 
during follow-up for blast count evaluation (to inform disease burden assessment). Bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_51109],  
 
Samples will be 
collected and analyzed from patients in both treatment arms. 
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51110]-blast AML, as well as RBC- and 
platelet-transfusion independence, will be monitored as secondary efficacy endpoints. Treatment- emergent resistance w ill also be monitored. 
Sparse sampling for the determination of pevonedistat plasma concentrations and, if appropriate, its 
metabolites will be collected from each patient in the Combination Pevonedistat Plus Azacitidine 
Arm to contribute to a population PK analysis of pevonedistat co-administered with azacitidine. 
Adverse events and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status will be 
assessed, and ECGs, clinical laboratory values, and vital signs will be obtained, to evaluate the safety 
and tolerability of the study drug treatments. Patient-reported HRQOL will be evaluated using the 
EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L (all patients) a nd the QOL-E (American English-speaking US 
patients only) questionnaires.
Study Population:
Patients may be male or female, and must be [ADDRESS_53793] morphologically confirmed diagnosis of MDS or nonproliferative CMML (ie,

(a) Screening assessments will be performed within [ADDRESS_53802] time before the start of study 
drug administration.
(b)Except for hematology, procedures conducted during the Screening period that are performed within [ADDRESS_53803] samples on the previous Friday.
(c) On dosing days, all procedures are to be performed prior to pevonedistat or azacitidine dosing unless specified otherwise. 
(d) For a new cycle of treatment with study drug(s) to begin, toxicities considered to be related to treatment with study drug(s) must have resolved to the level or grade defined in 
Section 6.3.1 .
(e) The first dose of st udy drug must be administered within 5 days of randomization on study. It is strongly recommended that dosing for both treatm ent arms occur on the days 
specified. However, dosing of either drug may be delayed for safety reasons or other unavoidable circums tances (eg, weather conditions affecting clinic accessibility). If 
pevonedistat dosing is delayed, a minimum of 1 full calendar day between any 2 doses should be maintained. In each cycle, a maximum of 3 doses of pevonedistat and 7 doses 
azacitidine (as ap plicable) should not be exceeded. For the combination arm, pevonedistat and azacitidine should always be administered on the same day (eg, instead of 
pevonedistat dosing on Days 1, 3, and 5, it would be acceptable to dose on Days 1, 5, and 8). If dosing is adjusted, study procedures should be performed on the actual day of 
dosing.
(f) The EOT visit will occur 30 days (+10 days) after the last dose of study drug(s) or before the start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy if that occurs sooner. Af ter the EOT visit, 
patients will enter EFS follow -up if their disease has not transformed to AML (for patients with HR MDS or CMML) or enter response follow -up if their disease has not 
progressed ( for patients with low -blast AML) (as defined in Section 7.4.21 ), and they have not started subsequent therapy. Patients will enter OS follow -up when they have 
confirmed transformation to AML (for patients with HR MDS o r CMML at study entry), experienced progressive disease (for patients with low -blast AML at study entry), or 
have started subsequent therapy.
(g) Confirmation of patient eligibility by [CONTACT_456]’s project clinician (or designee) is required prior to rand omization. A Patient Eligibility Checklist must be completed and 
submitted by [CONTACT_51201].
(h) See Section 15.7 for the modified Charlson comorbidity index. 
(i) Weight will be measured within [ADDRESS_53804] formula (see example in Section 15.8) on 
Cycle 1 Day  1, and on Day 1 of subsequent cycles if the patient experiences a 5% change in body weight from the weight used fo r the most recent BSA calculation.
(j) Vital signs, including diastolic and systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature will be collected at Screening, predose on Days 1, 3, and 5 on each treatment arm of 
each treatment cycle, at EOT, and as clinically indicated. Vital sign measurements will be taken with the patient in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_51115] .
(k) Additional ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.
(l) If a chest X -ray or chest CT scan was performed within [ADDRESS_53805] X -ray does not need to be performed during Screening.
(m) A serum pregnancy test will be performed for women of childbearing potential at Screening. A pregnancy test must also be perf ormed for women of childbearing potential at

MDS are classified using the World Healt h Organization (WHO) classificat ion system [6,7]
based upon a combination o f morphology , immunophenoty pe, genetics, and clinical 
features. The WHO classificat ion system was built  upon the French -American -British 
(FAB) Cooperative Group classificat ion [
5].
MDS are commonly divided into lower -or higher-risk categori es based on the Revised 
International Prognosti c Scoring System (IPSS -R) for MDS, which is a scoring system 
useful for estimat ing overall survival and the risk of transformation to AML [
2].Overall, 
approximately  25% of  patients wi th very  high, high, or interm ediate IPSS -R scores will 
transform to AML wit hin 0.[ADDRESS_53837] ively [2]. Medi an 
survival for patients with MDS varies fro m years to m onths and decreases wit h increasing

of patients wi th lower -risk MDS (often defined as patients with <5% myelo blasts and/or 
norm al or good risk cy togenetics and few cytopenias) focuses on minimizing blood product 
transfusio ns and maximizing qualit y of life through use of supportive care (eg, antibiotics as 
needed for infect ions, red blood cell transfusions), growth factors such as ery thropoi esis 
stimu lating factors or immunosuppressive drugs. Treatment for patients with higher -risk 
disease often includes DNA hypo methylat ing agents (azacit idine and decitabine) [8]. Rarely, 
intensive chemotherapy is used in pat ients with higher -risk MDS (HR MDS), but it 
generally results in significant toxicit y and m odest responses

(>10x109/L), absence of the Philadelphia chromosome and/or BCR -ABL1 fusio n gene, 
absence of platelet -derived growth factor rec eptor or gene rearrangement, fewer than 20% 
blasts in the blood and the bone marrow, and dy splasia of 1 or more myelo id lineages [21]. 
CMML was classified as an MDS in the FAB classificat ion system in 1982 [
5], but was 
subsequent ly reclassified as a mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferat ive disorder by  [CONTACT_51207] 2001 [
22]. CMML shares clinical and bio logical features with 
MDS, including development of cy topenias and bone marrow failure, risk of progressi on to 
AML, and overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_51141]. Like MDS, i t has a vari able 
clinical course, with reported rates of transformat ion to AML of 15% to 52% and a median 
OS of 12 to 18 months [
23-25] . Treatment modalit ies for the 2 diseases are also similar, 
including hematopoie tic growth factors (ery thropoiesis -stimulating agents and granulocyte 
colony-stimulat ing factor), transfusio n support, hypomethylat ing agents, and allogeneic 
hematopoiet ic stem cell transplantation. 
Prognosti c scoring systems for MDS, including the IPSS -R scoring system used in this 
study , have been routi nely applied to pati ents wi th CMML and have been shown to be 
predi ctive of both transformat ion to AML and overall survival [26]. 
Low m arrow bl ast count (20% -30%) WHO -

refractory  anemia wi th excess blasts in transformatio n (RAEB -t). WHO cri teria now define

70years) compared the effects of azacit idine versus CCRs o n overall survival o f these 
FAB -defined RAEB -t and WHO -defined AML [
13].Median overall survival for 
azacit idine-treated pati ents was 24.5 months co mpared wi th 16.0 months for CCR -treated 
patients (hazard rati o=0.47). Furthermore, azacit idine was associated with fewer total days

these low m arrow bl ast AML pati ents. Azacit idine was associated with improvements in 
physical funct ion, symptoms, and psycho logical state. Pati ents assigned to supportive care 
were permitted to cross over to azaci tidine at the time of progression; this design limited 
survival analysis. Based on these studi es, azaci tidine-based therapy  is a standard of care in

281.1.2 Study Drug: Pevonedistat
Pevonedistat (MLN4924; TAK -924) i s a fi rst-in-class small mo lecule inhibitor of the 
NEDD8 (neural precursor cell expressed develo pmen tally down -regul ated protein 
8)-activating enzyme that is being developed for the t reatment of malignancies. 
NEDD8- activat ing enzyme (NAE) is an E1 activating enzyme and is an essent ial component 
of the NEDD8 conjugat ion pathway , which controls the act ivity of a subset of ubiquit in E3 
ligases, mult iprotein co mplexes that transfer ubiquit in molecules to protein substrates that 
are then targeted to the proteasome for degradation. Cullin -dependent ubiquit in E3 ligases 
(CDLs) require conjugation to NEDD8 to be activated. Cullin dependent ubiquit in E3 
ligases control the timely ubiquit ination and consequent proteasomal degradation o f proteins 
with important rol es in cell cycle progression and signal transduct ion, cellular processes that 
are integral to tumor cell growth, proliferat ion, and survival. Inhibitors of NAE activit y may 
be of therapeut ic value in the treatment of various cancers by [CONTACT_51209] a variet y of critical regulatory  proteins. As detailed in Section 1.5, the 
nonclinical and preliminary  clinical experience in AML with pevonedistat alone or in 
combinat ion supports further evaluat ion in the subset of patients who are classified as HR 
MDS orCMML or low- blast AML.
1.2 Nonclinical Experience
1.2.1 Single -Agent Pevonedistat
Pevonedistat is a potent and selective inhibitor of NAE activit y.
Pevonedistat treatment of cultured tumor cells resulted in growth inhibit ion of a wide variety 
of cell lines derived from acute leukemias, lymphomas, mult iple myelo ma, and a range of 
solid tumor ty pes. Changes in protein levels observed in cultured cells treated with 
pevonedistat were consistent with the inhibit ion of NAE :inparticular ,a decrease in 
NEDD8- cullin levels and a reciprocal increase in the levels of known CDL substrates, 
including NFE2- related f actor 2 (Nrf2) and chromatin -licensin g and DNA -replicat ion 
factor -1 (Cdt -1). In most cell lines evaluated, NAE inhibit ion by [CONTACT_51210] t led to DNA 
re-replicat ion and accumulat ion of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle; this resulted in DNA 
damage and subsequent cell death through apoptosis [28-30] .
Pevonedistat demonstrated pharmacodynamic and ant itumor activit y in so lid tumor, 
lympho ma, and AML xenograft models when administer ed to immunocompromised mice 
by [CONTACT_51211] (SC) route. Very  few preclinical models of HR MDS are available, and 
pevonedistat has not been tested specifically in HR MDS.

The systemic toxicit y of pevonedistat was a ssessed in GLP -compliant repeat -dose studies in

30The benefit of the combinat ion of pevonedistat with azacit idine was confirmed in vivo with

xeno grafts. Pevonedistat in combinat ion withazaciti dine dem onstrated addi tive or

which represent both azacit idine-sensi tive (OCI -M2) and azacit idine-insensit ive (HL60 and 
THP -1) models. In OCI -M2, azacitidine and pevonedistat as single agents inhibited tumor 
growth, but the combination o f these agents resulted in tumor regressions with a statist ical 
assessment of synergy. In THP- 1, although pevonedistat as a single agen t inhibi ted tum or 
growth without causing regressio ns and azacit idine as a single agent had only  a marginal  
effect on tumor growth, the combinat ion caused regressio ns and delayed tumor regrowth 
following the treatment period. In HL60, tumor regressio ns were seen with the co mbination 
of pevonedistat and azacit idine at dose l evels that had minimal or moderate antitumor 
activit y as single agents. Furthermore, in a disseminated xenograft model in which HL60 
cells were inoculated into immunocompro mised mice by [CONTACT_51215], pevonedistat and 
azacit idine as single agents both extended survival time compared to a control group, but the

received pevonedistat 20 mg/m2(n=26) o r 30 mg/m2(n=3). Primary  diagnoses were 
19(66%) de novo AML and 10 (34%) secondary  AML. Seventeen (59%) patients had 
intermediate -risk cy togeneti cs and 7 (24%) had adverse -risk cy togeneti cs (5 [17%]

pevonedistat in co mbination wit h 75 m g/m2azacit idine. During dose escalat ion, DLTs at the

studi ed in Sprague -Dawley rats, beagle dogs, cynomo lgus mo nkeys, and chimpan zees. The 
whole blood clearance is low in all animal species, likely as a result of the extensive 
partitioning of pevonedistat into red blood cells. The plasma terminal disposit ion half-life 
(t1/2)varied fro m short (l ess than 1 hour in rats) to relat ively long (15 hours in monkeys). 
The m ajor eliminat ion pathway  of pevonedistat in animals is through the hepat ic route. 
Urinary  excret ion of unchanged pevonedistat was negligible (<5%) in rats and primates. 
After an IV dose of [14C] pevonedistat, radioactivit ywas primarily  excreted in the feces in 
intact rats and in bile duct -cannulated rats; excret ion was almost complete by  24 hours 
postdose. No plasma metabo lite accounted for more than 10% of the total plasma 
radioactivi ty, suggesting potenti ally low systemi c exposure to metabo lites. 
In vitro pevonedistat is metabo lized via hydroxylatio n and oxidat ion, predominantly by 
[CONTACT_097]3A4 wit h a small contribut ion from CYP2D6. Results from the co mpleted drug -drug

33Pevonedistat systemic exposure in the presence of itraconazo le, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, 
was only minimally increased co mpared with that in the absence of itraconazo le (geometric 
mean dose -norm alized AUC ∞ratio of 1.14 [90% CI ,1.07 to 1.23 ]). The 14% increase in the 
pevonedistat geometric mean dose -norm alized AUC was not considered clinically  
meaningful when viewed in the context of pevonedi stat overall PK variabilit y (coefficient of 
variat ionin AUC ∞, 16%- 34%), supporting inference of the lack of a clinically relevant 
effect of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor on total systemic exposure (AUC) of 
pevonedistat (see Section 1.6.3 ). Pevonedistat does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 
and 3A4/5, and weakly  and reversibly  inhibi ts both CYP2B6 and 2C8; it does not induce 
CYP1A 2, 2B6, and 3A4/5. When viewed in the context of clinically  relevant concentrati ons 
at 20 mg/m2(mean single -dose maximum [peak] concentration [C max] of ~0.5 µM), 
pevonedistat is unlikely to affect the PK of drugs that are metabo lized by [CONTACT_51217].
In vitro, pevonedistat is a substrate for the drug efflux transporters P -glycoprotein (P -gp) 
and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and is also a weak inhibitor of BCRP -mediated 
transport (concentrations producing 50% inhibit ion [IC 50] of 6.3 M). Additional transport 
studi es wi th organic anio n-transporti ng po lypept ides (OATP) in sandwich -cultured human 
hepatocy tes showed that pevonedistat can inhibit the hepat ic uptake of estrone -3-sulfate 
(IC 50of 29.1 µM) while inhibit ion of OATP -mediated upt ake of simvastatin and lovastatin 
(IC 50of 0.4-4.9 µM and 0.9 µM, respectively) was observed in so me, but not all, donors. On 
the basis o f these data, pevonedistat at clinically relevant concentrations is unlikely to affect 
the PK of other drugs that are k nown BCRP or OATP substrates (IC 50 >10-fold the unbound

Pevonedistat PK was linear over the dose range studied based on a daily area under the 
plasma concentration -time curve (AUC 0-24hr) that increased proportionately  with dose. 
Consistent with in vitro data, pevonedistat was also found to extensively part ition in human 
blood (m ean bl ood-to-plasma concentration rat io of ~65) with observed concentrations of 
pevonedistat in who le blood and plasma declining in parallel over 24 hours. Upon 
explorat ion of the effects of patient -specific covariates on pevonedistat populat ion PK, body  
size and age influenced clearance of p evonedistat, while only body  size was important for all 
volume of distribut ion parameters. Addit ionally , data are available in 29 treatm ent-naïve,

combinat ion of pevonedistat and azacit idine compared withsingle- agent azaci tidine as a 
treatm ent for HR MDS or CMML or low- blast AML. Patients with CMML are included 
because CMML shares clinical and bio logical  features wi th MDS, has a similar variable 
clinical course, and treatment modalit ies for the 2 di sease s are al so similar (see 
Secti on1.1.1 ). Patients with CMML were also included in rando mized studies o f azacit idine 
conducted in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and the European Unio n with similar response rates to 
patients wi th MDS [13,27] . The rati onale for including low marrow blast count (20% -30%) 
WHO -defined AML i s because l ow m arrow bl ast count AML had been previously  classified 
as refractory  anemia wi th excess blasts in transformat ion (RAEB -t), which was part of the 
MDS spectrum, and it is a populati on of  patients wi th AML who have been shown to benefit 
from azacit idine-based therapy (see Section
 1.1.1 ).
1.5.2 Rationale for the Combination of Pevonedistat Plus Azacitidine
The rati onale for com bining pevonedistat with azacit idine in pat ients with AML and MDS is 
2-fold; namely, the single -agent ac tivity observed with azacit idine [13]and pevonedistat 
[
33]in patients with AML or related diseases such as MDS, and the preclinical evidence 
supporting t he improved benefit of pevonedistat administered in co mbinat ion with 
azacit idine in AML xenograft models; see Section 1.2.2 and the IB for more inf ormation. 
1.5.3 Rationale for Dose and Schedule of Study Drugs
The cho ice of doses and schedules for this study  was based on Study  C15009, which 
established the MTD of pevonedistat as 20 mg/m2given on Days 1, 3, and 5, in combinat ion 
with 75mg/m2azacit idine given on Day s [ADDRESS_53865] ion tests (LFTs; see 
Secti on 1.3and the IB for more informat ion). 
The commo nly used schedule of azacit idine administration in the U nited States is a 
5-on/2-off (weekend)/[ADDRESS_53866]/hematologist 
surveys conducted by  [CONTACT_456], of the patients treated with azacit idine for AML in the 
[LOCATION_002], approximately  70% f ollow this schedul e. Garci a et al  conducted a 
retrospective evalua tion of  3schedules o f azacit idine administration in 181 patients wi th 
MDS . Evaluated patients received 75 mg/m2azaci tidine on one of the following schedules : 
5days, 5-on/2-off/2 -on, or daily for 7 days. The overall response rates (38%, 71%, and 52%,

36respectively) favored 5-on/2- off/2-on administration of azacitidine over a 7-day 
administration, with p = 0.0418. All schedules were well tolerated [34].
In this study, azacitidine may be administered  using either the SC or the IV route of 
administration, given that comparable systemic exposures (AUC 0-48hr) to azacitidine were 
achieved following either route in Study C15009. Furthermore, it has been reported that 
azacitidine is generally w ell tolerated regardless of the route of administration [35], which is 
also supported by [CONTACT_51218] C15009.
As detailed in Section  1.3, some patients in Study C15003 (single-agent pevonedistat in 
patients with relapsed/refractory AML) derived clinical benefit from continuing study treatment despi[INVESTIGATOR_51144]. Standard MDS guidelines [36]
also recommend treatment for 6 cycles without altering dose or frequency of azacitidine 
regardless of cytopenias. Patients with HR MDS or CMML may be allowed to continue 
study treatment (either treatment arm) if th ey meet the criteria for progressive disease based 
only on bone marrow blast count (without AML transformation) if, in the clinical judgment 
of the investigator, the patient is still receivi ng clinical benefit from this treatment and the 
continuation is endorsed by [CONTACT_456]’s project clinician (or designee). Patients with low-blast AML, in this study, may also be allowed to continue study treatment (either treatment 
arm), even if they meet the criteria for progressive disease based only on bone marrow blast 
counts, if, in the clinical judgment of the investigator, the patient is still receiving clinical 
benefit from this treatment, and the continuation is endorsed by [CONTACT_456]’s proj ect 
clinician (or designee). Patients who meet the criteria for PD and continue on study under 
these conditions must be reconsented before continuing study treatment. If a patient has 
<50% increase in blast count from pretreatment, then this is stable disease and the patient 
should remain on study.

clinical outcome. Various studies confirm that survival for individual patients in both 
diseases is heavily influenced by [CONTACT_51219]. Along 
with age and performance status, cytogenetics are a key clinical predictor, and cytogenetic findings are incorporated into risk categorization schemes to guide treatment. CCI

disease relapse. Measurable residual disease (MRD) testing provides the sensitivity and 
specificity to identify the presence of these residual cells. Studies have shown that the 
sensitive detection of a leukemia-specific marker (eg, a mutation in the gene encoding nucleophosmin [ NPM1 ]) could improve prognostication by [CONTACT_51220] [51]. Assessment of MRD is receivin g recognition as a potential 
tool to assess the quality of response after chemotherapy and to plan post-remission 
strategies. PCR and multiparametric flow cytom etry have become the most popular methods 
to investigate MRD in AML [52]. Methods to assess MRD by [CONTACT_11398]-generation sequencing

401.5.5 Rationale for Health-Related Quality of Life Assessments
When caring for patients with advanced and life-threatening diseases such as cancer, 
preserving their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and reducing symptom burden are 
among the most important therapeutic goals. However, there are limited data on patient 
reported outcomes (PROs) among patients with HR MDS. In previous randomized clinical trials among patients with MDS, patients on the azacitidine arm experienced improvement in 
HRQOL as assessed by [CONTACT_51222]-QLQ-C30 PRO instrument [62].
To compare the impact of treatment between the 2 patient groups in this study, HRQOL will 
be assessed by 3 instruments: EORTC-QLQ- C30 and EQ-5D-5L (all patients) and the 
QOL-E (US patients only). Data from these 3 instruments will facilitate assessment of important general, cancer-specific, and MDS-specific HRQOL domains and items, and 
ascertainment of how these may be correl ated with certain clinical outcomes.
The EORTC-QLQ-C30 [63], designed to assess health-related quality of life in a wide range 
of cancer patient populations, has been admin istered in multiple randomized clinical trials of 
patients with MDS [62,64] . 
While the EORTC-QLQ-C30 assesses important HRQOL domains including global health 
status/quality of life, functioning, and symptoms over the past week, the QOL-E wasdeveloped specifically for patients with MDS, with evidence for reliability and validity in 
this patient population [65]. As such, it is used to assess the specific impact of MDS on 
HRQOL that is not measured in general non–MDS-specific instruments.
Because oncology therapi[INVESTIGATOR_51145] a patient’s quality of life, a 
common methodological approach used to quantify this effect is to “quality-adjust” survival rates in comparative treatment arms. The resulting data, referred to as quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs), provide a measure of both the length and quality of life and are used for 
economic evaluation of new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The data required for the assessment for QALY is captured by [CONTACT_28973]-5D-5L.
Refer to Section  7.4.16 for additional details on the components and administration of these 
questionnaires. CCI

Clinical Study Protocol Pevonedistat -[ADDRESS_53873] : [ADDRESS_53874] ions to azacit idine were qualitatively similar between the IV 
and SC routes of administration [35]. In clinical studies with SC administration of 
azacit idine, adverse react ions of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomit ing, 
diarrhea, consti pation, and inject ion site ery thema/reacti on tended to increase in incidence 
with higher doses of azacit idine. Adverse react ions that tended to be more pronounced 
during the first 1 to 2 cy cles of SC treatm ent com pared wi th later cycles inc luded 
thrombocy topenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, vomit ing, injection site 
erythema/pain/bruising/react ion, constipat ion, petechiae, dizziness, anxiet y, hypokal emia, 
and inso mnia. There did not appear to be any adverse reactions that increased in freque ncy 
over the course of treatment.
Adverse reactions that appeared to be specifically associated with the IV route of 
administration included infusio n site reactions (eg, erythema or pain) and catheter site 
reacti ons (eg, infection, ery thema, or hem orrhage) .
Adverse reactions ident ified during postmarketing use of azacit idine include interst it
ial lung 
disease, tum or lysis syndrome, i nject ion site necrosis, and Sweet’s syndrome (acute febrile 
neutrophilic dermatosis).

Unio n (EU) Summary of Product  Characteristics (SmPC) [66], as applicable, for the most

[IP_ADDRESS] Renal Abnormalities
Patients wi th renal impairment should be closely  monitored f or toxi city because azacit idine 
and its metabolites are primarily  excreted by  [CONTACT_8212]. Renal abnormalit ies ranging fro m 
elevated serum  creat inine to renal failure and death have been reported in pat ients treated 
with IV azaci tidine in co mbinat ion with other chemotherapeut ic agents for non -
MDS 
condi tions. Renal tubular acidosis, defined as a fall in serum bicarbonate to <20 mEq/L in 
associ ation with an alkaline urine and hypokalemia (serum potassium <3 mEq/L), developed 
in 5 pat ients with chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with azacit idine and etoposi de.
1.6.2 Pevonedistat Plus Azacitidine
In the ongoing clinical study  of the combinat ion of pevonedistat and azacit idine in 
treatm ent-naïve patients wi th AML, age ≥60 years (S tudy C15009), am ong 
25response -evaluable patients, 28% had a best response of CR or CRi  (26September 2014

The m ost detailed informat ion on risks is provided in the Invest igator’s Brochure and the 
Developmental Core Safet y Informat ion (DCSI) located within the Invest igator’s Brochure.
Overall ident ified risks of pevonedistat include increased heart rate, diarrhea, nausea, 
vomiting, abnormal LFTs, py rexia, myalgia, and musculoskeletal pain. 
Hepatotoxi city: Hepatotoxi city has been noted following administration of pevonedistat in 
patients wi th advanced malignancy , including el evati ons of  liver transaminases (up to 
Grade 4), alkaline phosphatase (up to Grade 3), and bilirubin (up to Grade 3). Grade [ADDRESS_53880] been 
observed in patients receiving single -agent pevonedi stat f or relapsed and/or refractory  AML . 
The patients experiencing these changes in laboratory  values have been asymptomatic . This 
type of elevat ion in transaminases had been observed previously in pat ients treated with 
pevonedistat . The el evations in laboratory  values have been reversible with dose 
modificati on including dose delay and reduct ion. Patients with elevated t ransaminases have 
been successfully rechallenged at lower doses . 
Some events are considered potential risks of pevonedistat because of the occurrence of 
these events in phase 1 clinical studies in which single -agent pevonedistat was administered 
at doses substant ially higher than those being used in current clinical trials. Those events 
included mult i-organ failure that could result in death ,renal fa ilure, cardi ac arrhy thmias 
(allsupraventricular and all except 1 unrelated, the case of atrial fibrillat ion assessed by  [CONTACT_51223] a pat ient with cardi ovascular risk factors), 
myelosuppressio n with increased suscept ibilit y to infect ion, bleeding, anemia ,acute phase 
response, gastrointestinal toxicit y including or result ing in dehydration, electrolyte 
imbalance, and hypophosphatemia .
Other events, such as fat igue, chills, decreased appetite, febrile neutropenia, and GI bleeding 
(all events assessed by [CONTACT_51224], the majorit y occurred in the setting of 
throm bocy topenia) ,are considered potential risks that are confounded by [CONTACT_51225].

activated thromboplastin time (aPTT), and local tissue injury  when administered 
subcutaneously (SC). Addit ional details may be found in the current IB .
Based on the known individual safet y profiles of pevonedistat and azacit idine, the following 
potenti al risks of combinati on therapy  may apply: myelosuppressio n, gastrointestinal events, 
electroly te imbalances, hypophosphatem ia, decreased renal funct ion, hepatotoxicit y, cardi ac 
arrhy thmias, cardi omyopathies, m uscul oskeletal  pain, bleeding, and inject ion site reactions.
In Study  C15009, pati ents receive azacit idine as either an IV infusio n or subcutaneous 
inject ion. Preliminary data indicate that the route of azacit idine administration has no 
apparent effect on the safet y profile of pevonedistat plus azacit idine. 
1.6.3 Potential for Drug- Drug Interactions
No formal clinical  assessments of DDIs between azacit idine and other agents ha ve been 
conducted. Please consult the VIDAZA USPI (Clinical Ph armacology [Secti on 12.3], 
Drug -Drug Interactions) for addi tional informat ion [35].
The potential risk of DDIs between pevonedistat and conco mitantly administered drugs is 
currently informed by  [CONTACT_51226] (see IB and Section
 1.4). Study  
C15011, a phase [ADDRESS_53882] of multiple doses of fluconazo le (a moderate 
CYP3A inhibitor) as well as the effect of mul tiple doses of i traconazol e (a strong CYP3A 
inhibitor) on the PK, safet y, and tol erabili ty of a single dose of IV pevonedistat (see 
Secti on1.4.1 ) was completed. Based on results from C15011, administration of pevonedistat 
with moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors is permitted in this study , while use of strong 
CYP3A inducers should be avo ided. As a general precaution, patients receiving conco mitant 
medicat ions, particularly  those wi th narrow therapeuti c indices, shoul d be carefully 
monitored as the DDI potential between pevonedistat and other drugs has not been formally 
studi ed in humans. Pati ents shoul d also be instructed to consult with the invest igator before 
taking any  new medicat ions, including over -the-counter products and herbal supplements.

rando mizat ion by [CONTACT_3170].
It is expected that approximately 117 patients will be enrolled in this study . Once enrolled, 
patients (MDS, CMML, and low -blast AML) will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive 
study  drug (ei ther single -agent azaci tidine or the combinat ion of pevonedistat and 
azacit idine) in 28- day treatm ent cy cles. All pat ients will be stratified i nto 4 categories: 
low-blast AML, IPSS -R risk groups of very  high, high ,or interm ediate for MDS/CMML 
[2]. Note that patients with HR MDS/CMML with indeterminate cy togenet ics findings at 
Screening should be assigned a cy togenetics prognostic variable of 2 points, ie, intermediate, 
for dete rmining overall Prognostic Risk Category/Score; see Section
 7.4.4 . All patients will 
receive azacit idine (75 m g/m2[IV or SC]) on Days 1 through 5, Day 8, and Day 9. Patients 
rando mized to the combinat ion arm  will also receive pevonedistat (20 mg/m2via 
60([±10] -minute infusio n) on Day s 1, 3, and 5. Modificat ions to the dos e and schedule may  
be allowed as detailed in the Schedule o f Events and Section 6.1.
Patients, including those who achieve a CR, may  receive study  treatm ent until they 
experience unacceptable toxicit y, rel apse, transformat ion to AML, or PD as defined in 
Secti on 7.4.21 . Patients with HR MDS or CMML may be allowed to continue study 
treatment (either treatment arm) if they meet the criteria for progressive disease based 
only on bone marrow blast count (without AML transformation) if, in the clinical 
judgment of the investigator, the patient is still receiving clinical benefit from this 
treatment and the continuation is endorsed by [CONTACT_456] ’s project clinician (or 
designee). Patients with low -blast AML in this study may also be allowed to continue 
study treatment (either treatment arm), even if they meet the criteria for progressive 
disease based only on bone marrow blast counts, if, in the clinical judgment of the 
investigator, the patient is still receiving clinical benefit from this treatment and the 
continuation is endorsed by [CONTACT_456]’s project clinician (or designee). Patients who 
meet the criteria for PD and continue on study under these conditions must be 
reconsented before continuing study treatment. Patients m ay choose to di scontinue 
therapy  at any  time. 
Patients will  attend the End -of-Treatm ent (EOT) visit 30 days (+10 day s) after the l ast dose 
of study  drug or before the start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy if that occurs sooner. 
After the EOT visit, patients will enter EFS follow -up (for patients with HR MDS or 
CMML) or response fo llow-up (for pati ents wi th low-blast AML), with study visits every 
3months, to include physical exam, clinical blood tests, HRQ OL assessments,

disease has not transformed to AML (for patients with HR MDS or CMML) or progressed

will enter OS follow-up (contact[CONTACT_457] 3 months  to document subsequent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_51149]) when they have confirmed transformation to AML (for patients with HR MDS or CMML) or experienced progressive disease (for patients with low-blast AML) or 
have started subsequent therapy.
Disease response assessments for all patients with HR MDS or CMML will be based on the 
Modified International Working Group (IWG) response criteria for MDS [3]as detailed in 
Section  7.4.21.  Disease response assessments for patients with low-blast AML will be based 
on the Revised Recommendations of the IWG for Diagnosis, Standard ization of Res ponse 
Criteria, Treatment Outcomes, and Reporting Standards for Therapeutic Trials in Acute 
Myeloid Leukemia as detailed in Section 7.4.21 [4]. Formal disease assessments for study 
endpoints will be determined based on lo cal bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_51150], and central lab data (local la b data may be used for time-sensitive clinical 
decisions).
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51110]-blast AML, as well as 
transfusion independence, will be monitored as secondary efficacy endpoints. RBC- and 
platelet-transfusion independence requires that the p atient receive no RBC or platelet 
transfusions, respectively, for a period of at lea st [ADDRESS_53894] count evaluation (to 
inform disease burden assessment).

the study drug treatments. Toxicity will be ev aluated according to National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Even ts (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.03, effective 
date 14 June 2010 [68]. Dose modification guidelines are presented in Section 6.3. 
4.2 Number of Patients
Approximately 117 patients (rando mized in a 1:1 ratio) w ill be enro lled in this study from 
approximately 80 study centers globally. Enrollment is defined as when the patient is randomized onto study treatment.
4.3 Duration of Study
Patients, including those who achieve a CR, may receive study treatment un til they 
experience PD or discontinuation for any other reason outlined in Section  7.5. Patients will 
be followed until approximately 60% of patients with HR MDS/CMML have experienced 
OS events, or termination of the study by [CONTACT_3433] e sponsor. Patients who are still receiving study 
treatment and continuing to derive clinical benefit may continue to receive pevonedistat at the discretion of the sponsor; the continuation of treatment may occur in  a manner other than 
under the study protocol, in accordance with local regulations.
After discontinuing study treatment (including th e EOT visit), patients will be followed for 
survival, subsequent therapy, and transform ation to AML (for patients with HR MDS or 
CMML), or progression and relapse from CR (patients with low-blast AML).CCI

The first dose of study  drug m ust be administered wi thin 5 days of randomizat ion on study . 
It is strongly  recommended that dosing for both treatment arms occur on the day s specified 
(ie,azacit idine dosing on Days 1 -5, 8, and 9; pevonedistat dosing on Days 1, 3, and 5). 
However, dosing of either drug may be delayed for safet y reasons or other unavo idable 
circumstances (eg, weather affect ing clinic accessibilit y). If pevonedistat dosing is delayed , 
a minimum of 1 full calendar day between any 2 doses shoul d be m aintained. In each cycle, 
a maximum  of 3doses of pevonedistat and 7 doses azacit idine (as applicable) should not be 
exceeded. For the combination arm, pevonedistat and azacitidine should always be 
administered on the same day (eg, instea d of pevonedistat dosing on Days 1, 3, and 5, it 
woul d be acceptable to dose on Day s 1, 5, and 8). If dosing is adjusted, study  procedures 
shoul d be perform ed on the actual  day of dosing.
The am ount of  study  drug (pevonedistat and/or azacit idine, as applic able) to be administered 
will be based on body  surface area (BSA). BSA will be calculated using a standard formula 
(see example in Sect ion15.8) onCycle 1 Day  1, and on Day  1 of subsequent cy cles if the

between 30 and 60 minutes after completion o f administration of IV azacit idine. 
6.2 Reference/Control Therapy: Azacitidine
Azacit idine is a chemical analogue of cy tidine that is wi dely used for the treatment of 
patients wi th AML. A phase 3, randomized, open -label, internat ional study  com pared 
azacit idine (75 m g/m2SC daily  for 7 day s, every 28 day s) wi th invest igator selected, 
convent ional care regimens (CCRs) (eg, best supportive care, low dose cy tarabine, or 
intensive chemotherapy) in 358 patients with HR MDS as defined at that time [13].
Approximately  one thi rd (n=113) of the pati ents in this study  had refractory  anemia wit h 
excess blasts in transformat ion (RAEB -t; 20% -30% bone marrow blasts); under the 2008 
WHO revised criteria, RAEB -t is now defined as AML [6]. A subanalysis of the study  
compared the rel ative efficacy and safet y of azaci tidine versus CCR in this patient subgroup 
(median age, 70 years) [
69]. Of these 113 patients with WHO -defined A ML, 86% were 
considered unfit for intensive chemotherapy. Two -year OS rates were higher wit h 
azacit idine versus CCR in the pat ients considered unfit for intensive chemotherapy (51% vs 
13%, respectively, p=0.0003). In addition, azacit idine was associated wi th fewer total  days

interval  [CI] 0.44 -0.52; p<0.0001) than CCR. In patients with unfavorable cytogenet ics, 
median OS in the azacit idine (n=14) and CCR (n=13) groups wa s 12.3 and 5.3 months, 
respectively  (hazard rati o=0.66; 95% CI 0.26 -1.68; p=0.38), whereas the 2 -year OS rate was 
38% for azacitidine, with no patients surviving mo re than 20 months in the CCR group 
(p=0.01) [69].
In a rando mized phase 3 trial o fazacit idine versus CCR in o lder patients with newly 
diagnosed AML, the m edian OS wi th azaci tidine was 10.4 months, a 3.8 month (58%) 
increase over CCR. One -year survival with azacit idine was 47%, a 36% increase over CCR. 
Although the study  did not reach s tatistical significance for its primary endpoint of OS

6.3 Dose Modification Guidelines
6.3.1 Criteria for Retreatment and Dose Delays
Retreatment Within a Cycle
If dosing of either drug is delayed for safet y reasons, retreatment may  be resumed upon 
resol ution of the safet y condi tion to ≤Grade 1. For pevonedistat , a minimum o f 1full 
calendar day between any  2doses shoul d be maint ained. In each cycle, a maximum of 
3doses of pevonedistat and 7 doses azacit idine (as applicable) should not be exceeded. If 
azacit idine is held for whatever reason, it may  be resumed to com plete a full treatment 
course as long as the full [ADDRESS_53922] igator 
and the sponsor’s project clinician (or designee) agree that it is in the pa tient’s interest to 
continue therapy  with the study  drug(s), then after recovery  of the toxi city or toxi cities in 
question to Grade 1 or to the patient’s baseline values, the dose of study  drug m ay be 
reduced. For toxicit y not related to drug (eg, disease -related toxi city), although a similar 
dose reduction is permitted, in general it is discouraged. If the reduced dose is well tolerated 
and the toxicit y leading to dose reduction was ≤Grade 3, has resolved, and does not reoccur, 
the dose m ay resume at the original  dose l evel in the next cycle after endorsement by  [CONTACT_103]’s project clinician (or designee). For specific guidelines on azacit idine and 
pevonedistat dose reductions, see Sections 6.3.2 and 6.3.3).

62Initiation of a New Cycle
Treatment with study  drugs will be repeated every  28days.It is strongly  recommended that 
dosing for both treatment arms occur on the day s specified. However, the initiation of a new 
cycle may be del ayed f or safet y reasons or other unavoidable circumstances (eg, weather 
affect ing clinic accessibilit y). For thera py to resume, nonhematologic toxicit y considered 
related to treatm ent wi th study  drugs m ust have resolved to Grade 1, to the patient’s 
baseline values, or to a level considered acceptable by  [CONTACT_51231] h 
sponsor’s project clinici an (or desi gnee). Cri teria for dosing in a new cycle related to 
hematol ogic toxici ties are detailed for azacit idine in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and for pevonedistat in 
Secti on [IP_ADDRESS] .
If a patient fails to meet the criteria for retreatment, init iation of the next cycle of treatment 
may be delayed for up to [ADDRESS_53924] been met. A dose reduction (as 
detailed in Sect ions 6.3.2 and 6.3.3 ) would be triggered if treatment is delayed for >2 weeks 
because of inco mplete recove ry from treatm ent-related toxi city. If the reduced dose i s well  
tolerated and the toxicit y leading to dose reduction was ≤Grade 3, has resolved, and does not 
reoccur, the dose may  resume at the ori ginal  dose level in the next cycle after endorsement 
by [CONTACT_456]’s project clinician (or designee).
6.3.2 Dose Modification for Hematologic Toxicities
[IP_ADDRESS] Azacitidine
Dose reduction or delays of azaci tidine for hematologic toxicit ies (including fever and 
neutropeni a) during the first [ADDRESS_53925] with the 
sponsor’s project clinician (or designee).
For hem atologic AEs, the start of a new treatment cy cle shoul d be delayed and/or dose 
modifications shoul d be consi dered if:
Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is <500/µL. For patients with disease -related 
neutropeni a, physician discretion may  be used to init iate therapy  with ANC ≥50% of 
baseline (baseline from the start of the previous cycle). In ge neral, the use of growth 
factors should be restricted. However, to avoid dose delay , pati ents who experience 
Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <500/µL) with or without fever may receive granulocyte 
colony-stimulat ing factor (G -CSF) or granulocyte macrophage co lony-stimulating

combinat ion after discussio n and agreement with the sponsor’s project clinician (or 
designee) . Any use of growth factors will be documented in the electronic case 
report form (eCRF). Pati ents who receive myelo id growth factors will not be 
included in assessment of neutrophil response.
Platelet coun t is <20,000/µL. For patients with disease -related thrombocy topeni a, 
physician discretion may  be used to init iate therapy  with platel et count ≥50% of 
baseline (baseline from the start of the previous cycle). If the above criteria are not 
met, the start of the new cycle will be delayed unt il the above criteria are met. If a 
low ANC or pl atelet count causes the delay  of the start of the new cy cle of  more than 
2 weeks, then the azacit idine dose will be decreased to 50 mg/m2when treatm ent is 
resum ed. Treatm ent m ay be held up to 6 weeks (42 day s) due to toxicit y before 
patient m ust be rem oved from  protocol  therapy . 
If the reduced dose is well tolerated and the toxicit y leading to dose reduction was ≤Grade 3, 
has resolved, and does not reoccur, the dose may resume at the original dose level in the 
next cy cle after endorsement by  [CONTACT_456]’s project clinician (or designee).
If indicate d, bone m arrow eval uation will be performed to establish whether cont inued 
myelosuppressio n is related to persistent or progressing leukemic infiltrat ion. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pevonedistat
It is not anti cipated that pevonedi stat dose m odificati ons woul d be necessary  due to 
myelosuppressio n. However, if clinically indicated in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the invest igator, the 
pevonedistat dose may be reduced from 20 mg/m2to 10 m g/m2. The pevonedistat dose may  
be re -escalated to 15 mg/m2or 20 m g/m2at the next cy cle, if the toxicit y has r ecovered to 
≤Grade 1 or the patient’s baseline. 
Although leukostasis is not anticipated in this study, pevonedistat should be held for 
symptoms of leukostasis unt il the leukostasis is treated per inst itutional guidelines. 
Pevonedistat may be restarted when WBC count is <50,000/µL and fo llowing agreement by

[IP_ADDRESS] Azacitidine
Azacitidine Dose Adjustment Based on Renal Function and Serum Electrolyt es
For renal  toxicities, specifically elevated creatinine >Grade 1, azacit idine shoul d be reduced 
in accordance wit h the prescribing informat ion [35] and/or institutional guidelines. 
Similarly, if unexplained elevat ions in serum creat inine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) occur, 
the next cycle should be delayed until values return to normal or baseline values, and the 
dose should be reduced by 50% on the ne xt treatment course. 
If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to <20 mEq/L occur, the azacit idine 
dose should be reduced by 50% on the next course. The azacit idine dose may be re -escalated 
back to 75 mg/m2at the next cycle, if the toxicit y has recovered to ≤Grade 1 or the patient’s 
baseline status. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pevonedistat
Pevonedistat Dose Adjustment Based on Serum Transaminases and Total Bilirubin
It is ant icipated that LFTs (AST, ALT, and occasionally bilirubin) may be elevated for 
approximately  48 hours fo llowing the end of pevonedistat infusio n on Cy cle 1 Day  1. 
For el evated LFTs of Grade 2 or 3 that occur on or after Cy cle 1 Day  3, pevonedistat should 
be held; once the elevated AST or ALT returns to ≤Grade 1, and/or elevated bilirubin 
returns to 1.5ULN or the patient’s baseline level , pevoned istat dose may be resumed at 
20mg/m2. For pevonedistat , a minimum o f 1full cal endar day between any  2doses should 
be maintained, and a maximum o f 3doses of pevonedistat within the cycle must not be 
excee ded. 
For el evated LFTs of Grade 4 that occur on or after Cycle 1 Day  3, the pevonedistat dose 
shoul d be held for the remainder of the cycle; if the elevated AST or ALT returns to ≤Grade 
1, and/or elevated bilirubin returns to 1.5ULN or the patient’s baseline level , then 
pevonedistat may be restarted at the next cy cle at a reduced dose of 10 mg/m2. If the toxicit y 
returns to ≤Grade 1 or the patient’s baseline status, pevonedistat may be re -escalated to 
15mg/m2 for the next cy cle. After 1 cy cle at 15 m g/m2, further re -escalation to 20 mg/m2
may occur only after the patient’s liver function test (AST, ALT, and bilirubin) have been 
confirmed to be Grade 1, the same level as the patient’s baseline values, or a level 
considered acceptable by [CONTACT_51232]’s project clinician (or designee).

Guidance for Clinical Assessment and Management of Hemodynamic Compromise 
It is essential that the pat ients receiving the combination of pevonedistat and 
azacitidine are carefully evaluated at Screening and before each dose of study drug for 
early symptoms and signs of hemodynamic compromise and/or active infection. 
Particular attention should be paid to u nexplained fever, tachycardia, hypotension, 
orthostasis, tachypnea, recent nausea and vomiting, and clinical evidence of 
dehydration. Patients who experience an untoward reaction with the combination of 
pevonedistat and azacitidine should be followed close ly on subsequent dosing.
For patients for whom there is a concern of dehydration, the following guidance for 
rehydration before pevonedistat dosing may be considered: 500 mL/hour of 
0.5Nsaline given over 2 to4 hours for a total of 1 to 2 L of fluid as c linically 
appropriate; each infusion of IV fluids should be recorded in the eCRFs.
For all patients with anemia, and especially for those with hemoglobin values ≤8g/dL 
at Screening or during the conduct of the study, RBC transfusions should be 
considered before pevonedistat dosing based on the risk of inadequate oxygenation, 
underlying cardiopulmonary status, clinical judgment, and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48799]. 
Similarly, for patients with clinically significant thrombocytopenia, especially those 
with platelet count <10,000/ µL, a platelet transfusion should be considered. Any RBC 
or platelet transfusion must be recorded in the eCRFs.
Patients who experience signs and symptoms of hemodynamic compromise after 
pevonedistat dosing (eg, tachycardia, hypotension, ortho stasis, changes in mental 
status, syncope, and dizziness) should be followed closely and managed with supportive 
care, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], as clinically indicated.
Guidance Management of Leukostasis 
Pevonedistat treatm ent shoul d be wi thheld for pat ients who develop symptoms of 
leukostasis (see Sect ion [IP_ADDRESS] ). Treatment may include leukapheresis and hydroxyurea

Patient eligibilit y will be established before randomizat ion into the study  as pati ents will  not 
be permitted to re -enroll. Confirmat ion of patient eligibilit y by [CONTACT_456]’s project 
clinici an (or desi gnee) fo llowing review and approval of a Patient Eligibilit y Checklist is 
requi red pri or to randomizat ion. A centralized randomizat ion and stratificat ion using an 
interact ive web response system (IWRS) will be used. Patients will be rando mized s trictly 
sequent ially at a center as they  become eligible for randomizat ion and will be stratified as 
detailed in Sect ion 8.1.2. The study  drug regimen must be init iated wi thin 5 days of

Reconsent of Patients Who Meet the Criteria for PD and Continue Study Treatment
Patients wi th HR MDS or CMML may be allowed to con tinue study  treatm ent (ei ther 
treatm ent arm ) if they meet the criteria for PD based only on bone marrow blast count 
(without AML transformat ion) if, in the clinical judgment of the investigator, the patient is 
still receiving clinical benefit from this treatment ,and the continuat ion is endorsed by  [CONTACT_103]’s project clinician (or designee). Patients with low -blast AML in this study  may also 
be allowed to continue study  treatm ent (ei ther treatment arm), even if they  meet the cri teria
for PD based only on bone marrow blast counts if, in the clinical judgment of the 
investigator, the patient is st ill receiving clinical benefit from this treatment, and the 
continuat ion is endorsed by [CONTACT_456]’s project clinician (or designee). Patient s who 
continue on study  under these condit ions m ust be reconsented before continuing study

747.4.2 Inclusion/Exclusion Confirmation
During the screening process, a Patient Eligibilit y Checklist must be completed and 
submitted by  [CONTACT_51236]. Completion of the eligibilit y checklist i s necessary  to verify that the 
patient has met all of the inclusio n and exclusion criteria. Source documentation allows for 
independent verificat ion that patient eligibilit y has been determined by [CONTACT_51237]. Unless specifically  requested, addi tional source docum entati on does not need 
to be submitted with the checklist for the assessment of eligibilit y related to the other 
inclusion and exclusio n criteria.
7.4.3 Patient Demographics
The date of birth, race, ethnicit y, and sex of the patient are to be recorded during Screening.
7.4.4 Medical History and IPSS -R Risk Categorization
During Screening, a complete medical history  will be com pi[INVESTIGATOR_51156]. The history  
will emphasize the background and progress of the patient’s HR MDS orCMML or 
low-blast AML (see inclusion criteria 2 and 3, Sectio n5.1, for definit ions), including an 
assessment of bone marrow morpho logy (see Section 7.4.20 for addi tional details on bone 
marrow sample co llection and evaluat ion). Information regarding any prior therapy  for HR 
MDS orCMML or low- blast AML, including start and stop dates of each therapeutic agent 
and response to therapy , will be collected in the eCRF. In addit ion, all blood transfu sions 
related to HR MDS orCMML or low-blast AML that the patient received within 8 weeks 
prior to randomizat ion will be recorded to document baseline transfusio n dependence. 
For pati ents wi th HR MDS or CMML (but not for patients with low- blast AML), screening 
assessments must include risk categorizat ion (for patients both wit
h HR MDS and with 
CMML) according to the IPSS -R [2]. Source documents supporting the prognostic risk 
category  determinat ion may be requested with the Patient Eligibilit y Checklist for review by 
[CONTACT_51238] (see Sect ion 7.4.2 ).
The IPSS -R Prognostic Score values based on specific criteria are provided in Table 7.a, and 
the IPSS -R cytogenetic risk groups are provided in Table 7.b. Cytogen etic risk groups and 
bone marrow blast percent ages will be based upon results from the local laboratory , while 
clinical lab values (hemoglo bin, platelets and ANC) should be fro m the central  laboratory  
resul ts. Cri teria and score values from these tables are used to d etermine the overall risk 
category  as listed in Table 7.c. These [ADDRESS_53956] been adapted from:

administrative procedures of the questionnaires will be provided to the sites. Patient’ s 
refusal to complete all or any  part of a questi onnai re shoul d be docum ented in the eCRF. 
EORTC -QLQ -C30
The EORTC -QLQ -C30 incorporates [ADDRESS_53969] ional scales (physical  functioning, role 
funct ioning, emotional funct ioning, cognit ive functi oning, and soci al functioning), 1 global 
healt h status scale, 3 symptom scales (fat igue, nausea and vo miting, and pain), and 
6individual items (dyspnea, inso mnia, appetite loss, constipat ion, diarrhea, and financial 
difficult ies). Most of the [ADDRESS_53970] 4 response levels (not at all , a little, qui te a bi t, and 
very much), wi th [ADDRESS_53971] ional scales and the global 
healt h status scale, higher scores r epresent better HRQOL; whereas for the symptom scales 
lower scores represent better HRQOL. All items in this quest ionnaire relate to a recall period 
of 1 week.
QOL -E
The QOL -E assesses HRQOL in 5 general do mains (ge neral well -being, physical 
well-being, fu nctional well -being, social well -being, sexual well -being) and disease -related 
issues, with a recall period of 1 week with the excepti on of  1 general healt h item (1month). 
A higher score indicates a better HRQOL for that domain . The QOL -E will be administ ered 
to American English -speaking pat ients in the US only.
EQ-5D-5L
The EQ -5D- 5L is a self -administered preference -based measure of healt h status suitable for 
calculat ing QALYs to inform econo mic evaluat ions. EQ -5D- 5L includes 5 dimensions 
(mobilit y, self-care, usual activit ies, pain/disco mfort, anxiet y/depressio n) and 5 response 
levels for each do main (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, 
and extreme problems). Patients are asked to indicate their healt h state by  [CONTACT_51240] y on each of the 5 dimensi ons. Pati ent responses to the 
5dimensio ns of the EQ -5D- 5L represent the patient’s healt h state that is transformed to a

diagnosis at discharge. Transfusion data will also be collected. For example, the number of 
patients who received pRBCs and number of units received, number of patients who received a platelet transfusion and number of units received, and location of transfusion 
(inpatient vs outpatient).
7.4.18 Pharmacokinet ic Measurements
Blood samples (approximately 3 mL each) for the determination of pevonedistat (and its 
metabolites, if  appropriate) plasma concentrations will be collected from all patients in the 
Combination Pevonedistat Plus Azacitidine Arm at the time points indicated in the  Schedule 
of Events.  The exact date and time of each sample collection, as well as the actual start and 
stop times of the study drug administration, should be recorded accurately, and particular care should be given to the recording of blood sampling times that occur close to the 
infusion.
To ensure that the measurements are representative of plasma exposure, blood draws will be 
conducted in the arm opposite to a patient’s IV infusion. In the case that only a single arm is available, blood should be drawn as distal to th e site of IV i nfusion as f easible, and the site 
of blood draw should be documented.

In addition, a bone marrow assessment will be performed for disease assessment at relapse 
(or suspected relapse) or PD, and if otherwise clinically indicated (eg, major changes in the patient’s underlying hematological disease are suspected). Note that the detection of 
circulating blasts is not by [CONTACT_5071] a sufficient criterion for relapse, but should trigger a bone 
marrow examination to determine whether a relapse has occurred. Other examples of triggers for ad hoc bone marrow examination may include a 50% reduction from maximum remission/response in granulocytes or platelets or a reduction in hemoglobin by ≥2 g/dL that 
is not considered drug related (eg, do not recover), or the hematologic values prompt new or 
more frequent transfusion support than the patient’s baseline status. 
A bone marrow biopsy (in addition to bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]) is required only at Screening to 
confirm the diagnosis. However, a bone marrow biopsy may be collected with bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_51163]. If a biopsy was done within 28 days

86Note: The principal invest igator should make all efforts to perform the disease assessment 
by a bone marrow examinat ion. 
However, in the except ional circumstance that it is not 
possible to have a bone marrow examinat ionfrom patients f or disease assessment , 
transformation to AML will also be defined as >20% bl asts in peripheral blood AND an 
increase of blast count by  50% from  pretreatm ent.
Note that, according to the WHO Classificat ion [72]:
The blast percentage and assessment of degree of maturation and dysplast ic 
abnorm alities in the neopl astic cells should be determined, if possible, fro m a 
200-cell leukocy te different ial perform ed on a peripheral blood smear and a [ADDRESS_53980] ic/monocyt ic and acute and chronic 
myelo monocy tic leukemia and the megakary oblasts in acute m egakary oblast ic 
leukemia are considered as ‘blast equivalents’ when the requisite percentage of blasts 
is calculated for the diagnosis of AML.
As defined in
 Table 7.dand  Table 7.e, addi tional assessment(s) of disease response for 
patients wi th MDS or CMML are based on the criteria outlined in the Modified IWG 
Response Criteria for MDS [3]; and additional assessments of disease response for pati ents 
with low-blast AML are based on the criteria outlined in the Revised Reco mmendat ions of 
the IW G for Di agnosis Standardizat ion of Response Criteria, Treatment Outcomes, and 
Reporting Standards for Therapeutic Trials in Acute My eloid Leukemia (Table 7.f.).
Note that standard MDS guidelines [33] also recommend treatment for 6 cy cles wi thout 
altering dose or frequency of azacit idine regardless of cy topenias. Therefore, in this study , 
patients wi th HR MDS or CMML may  be allowed to con tinue study  treatm ent (ei ther 
treatm ent arm ), even if they  meet the cri teria for progressive disease based only on bone 
marrow bl ast counts (wi thout AML transformat ion), if, in the clinical judgment of the 
investigator, the patient is st ill receiving clinical benefit from this treatment, and the 
continuat ion is endorsed by [CONTACT_456]’s pro ject clinician (or designee). Patients who m eet 
the criteria for PD and conti nue on study  under these condit ions must be reconsented before 
continuing study  treatm ent.

874cycles. For example, 2 of the 6 responders in the single -agent pevonedistat study  in 
relapsed/re fractory AML had asymptomat ic transient increases in bone marrow blasts after 
achieving a response. In these 2 cases, bone marrow blasts increased from less than 5% to 
more than 20%, and then declined. In addi tion, another responder in that study  had an 
asymptomat ic transient increase in bone marrow blasts before achieving a response. In that 
case, bone marrow blasts almost doubled before response. These [ADDRESS_53982] AML, in this study , also may  be allowed to continue study  treatment (ei ther 
treatm ent arm ), even if they  meet the cri teria for progressive di sease based only on bone 
marrow bl ast counts, if, in the clinical judgment of the investigator, the patient is still 
receiving clini cal benefi t from this treatm ent and the cont inuat ion is endorsed by [CONTACT_103]’s project clinician (or designee). Patients who meet the criteria for PD and continue 
on study  under these condit ions must be reconsented before continuing study  treatm ent. If a 
patient has <50% increase in blast count from pretreatment, then this is stable disease and 
the pati ent shoul d remain on s tudy.

Morphologic 
Complete Remission 
(CR)A CR designation requires that the patient achieve the morphologic leukemia-free state 
and have an ANC of more than 1,000/ μL and platelets of ≥ 100,000/μL. A 
morphologic leukemia-free state requires less than 5% blasts in an aspi[INVESTIGATOR_51169] a count of at least [ADDRESS_53987] be independent of transfusions. There should be no residual evidence of 
extramedullary leukemia.
Morphologic 
Complete Remission with Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRi)After chemotherapy, some patients fulfill all of the criteria for CR except for residual

Category Response Criteria
Partial Remission 
(PR)This designation requires all of the hematologic values for a CR but with a decrease of 
at least 50% in the percentage of blasts to 5% to 25% in the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] . 
Thus, if the pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage was 50% to 100%, the 
percentage of blasts must decrease to a value between 5% and 25%; if the pretreatment 
blast percentage was 20% to less than 49%, they must decrease by [CONTACT_51246] a 
value of more than 5% . A repeat bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_51170] a PR and increased blasts caused by [CONTACT_51247] n. A value of ≤ 5% blasts may also be considered a PR if Auer rods are 
present.
Progressive disease 
(PD)Because the IWG criteria for AML do not provide a standardized definition for PD, [4]
in this protocol, PD is defined as one of the following:
>50% increase in bone marrow blasts from baseline value to > 30% blasts
>50% increase in circulat ing blasts from baseline value to >30% blast sin 
peripheral blood (in the exceptional case when bone marrow examination is 
not possible ) 
Development of biopsy -proven extramedullary disease, or new sites of 
extramedullary leukemia
Relapse after CR Relapse after CR is defined as a reappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral 
blood or >5% blasts in the bone marrow not attributable to any other cause (eg, bone 
marrow regeneration after consolidation therapy). In the setting of recent treatment, if 
there are no circulating blasts and the bone marrow contains 5% to 20% blasts, a 
repeat bone marrow performed at least a week later is necessary to distinguish relapse 
from bone marrow regeneration.

97OS will be analyzed when approximately 60% of patients with HR MDS/CMML have 
experienced OS events, or terminat ion of the study by [CONTACT_456].
OS will be calculated fro m date of rando mizat ion to the date of patient death due to any 
cause. Patients without documented death at the time of the analysis will be censored at the 
date tha t the patie nt was last known to be alive. Unstratified log -rank test will be used to 
compare OS between the [ADDRESS_54004] ratios, along with the 2 -sided 95% CIs,
will be estimated using the unadjusted, unstratified Cox model. The proportional ha zard 
assumpt ions will be examined and sensit ivity analysis will be conducted if appropriate. 
Kaplan -Meier curves and Kaplan -Meier m edians (if est imable), together with the 95% CIs, 
will be calculated for each treatment group.
[IP_ADDRESS] Analyses of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
If the secondary efficacy endpo int is response related, such as CR, the response -evaluable 
popul ation ofpatients with HR MDS/CMML, patients with low-blast AML, and the overall 
patientpopul ationwill be used separately ,if appropriate. Duration of the response -related 
endpo intwill be analyzed based on the corresponding responders ; otherwise ,the analysis 
will be based on HR MDS/CMML patients and the ITT populat ion separately.
For pati ents wi th low-blast AML, composite CR + CRi, CR as we ll as CRi will be analyzed.
Refer to Section
 7.4.21 for response definit ions (eg, complete remissio n, transformation to 
AML, PD).
EFS
The analysis of EFS, will  be based on patients wi th HR MDS/CMML and the ITT 
popul ation separately.
For pati ents wi th HR MDS/CMML, an event is defined as death or transformat ion to AML; 
for pati ents wi th low-blast AML, an event is defined as death. EFS is defined as the time 
from randomization to the occurrence of an event. Unstratified log -rank test will be used to 
compare EFS between the [ADDRESS_54005] ratios along with the 2 -sided 95% CIs will be 
estimated using the unadjusted, unstratified Cox model. The proporti onal hazard

signed inform ed consent to participate in a study  but before administration of any study  
medicat ion; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relat ionship with study  
participat ion.
10.1.2 Adverse Event Definition
Adverse event (AE) means any  untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not 
necessarily have a causal relat ionship wi th this treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavora ble and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or 
disease tem porally associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal (investigational) product whether 
or not i t is related to the medicinal product. This includes any newly occurring eve nt, or a 
previous condit ion that has increased in severit y or frequency since the administration of 
study  drug.
An abnormal laboratory  value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuat ion or del ay in treatm ent, dose m odificati on, therapeuti c intervent ion, or is 
considered by [CONTACT_2418] a clinically significant change from Baseline. 
10.1.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition
Serious AE (SAE) m eans any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death.

Pevonedistat (ML N4924; TAK -924)
Clinical Study Protocol Pevonedistat -[ADDRESS_54025] : 2015 -000221-37
106Is life-threat ening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe).
Requi res inpat ienthospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]
(see clarificati onbelow on planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24509]).
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . (Disabilit y is defined 
as a substant ial disrupt ion of a person’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions).
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .
Is a medically important event . This refers to an AE that may  not resul t in death, be 
immediately  life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered 
serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, 
requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent [ADDRESS_54026] ious agent. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatm ent in an emergency  room  or at hom e, blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do 
not resul t in inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094], or the develo pment of drug dependency or 
drug abuse; any  organism, virus, or infect ious parti cle (eg, pri on protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathoge nic or nonpathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent. 
In thi s study , intensi ty for each AE, including any  lab abnormalit y, will be determined using 
the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, effect ive date 14 June 2010 [68]. Clarificat ion shoul d be 
made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considere d severe in intensit y (Grade 3 
or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous. The general term severe
is often used to describe the intensit y (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, 
may be of relat ively minor medical sig nificance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is NOT 
the sam e as serious , which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described 
above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to 
funct ion. A seve re AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily  need to be considered serious. For 
example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3to less than 2000 is considered Grade 3 
(severe) but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not intensit y) serves as a guide for
defining regulatory  reporti ng obligat ions.

Adverse Events
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to an open question from 
study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic 
procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Section  10.3 for the 
period of observation). Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology  should be noted as 1 comprehensive event.
Regardless of causality, SAEs and serious pretreatment events (as defined in Section  10.1)  
must be reported (see Section  10.3 for the period of observation) by [CONTACT_51258] (contact [CONTACT_51259]). This should be done by [CONTACT_51260] [ADDRESS_54028] Information

later than planned).
For both serious and nonserious AEs, the investigator must determine both the intensity of 
the event and the relationship of the even t to study drug administration. For serious 
pretreatment events, the investigator must deter mine both the intensity of the event and the 
relationship of the event to study procedures.CCI

11.6 Patient Information and Informed Consent
After the study  has been fully  explained, wri tten inform ed consent will be obtained from 
either the pati ent or his/her guardian or legal representative before study participat ion. The 
method of obtaining and document ing the informed consent and the contents of the consent 
must com ply with the ICH -GCP and all applicable regulatory  requi rements. Patients with 
progressive disease based on bone marrow blasts counts may  be all owed to rem ain on study , 
after di scussio n between the invest igator and project clinician or designee, if it is judged that 
they are deriving clinical benefit from doing so. Patients who meet the criteria for PD and 
continue on study under these condit ions m ust be reconsented before continuing study

1)Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the investigational medicinal product, 
which may reduce the efficacy of the contraception method.
2)Contraception methods that in the context of this guidance are consider ed to have low user 
dependency.
3)Vasectomised partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the woman of childbearing potential participant of the study and that the vasectomised 
partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success.
4)In the context of this guidance sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if 
defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the 
study tre atments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration 
of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.
5)A combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide (d ouble -barrier 
methods) are also considered acceptable, but not highly effective, birth control methods.

[ZIP_CODE].10 Amendment 01 Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amend ment 01
The ori ginal  protocol  received approval signatory  on 25 February  2015. Based on the need 
to clarify  information, m odificat ions and/or revisio ns to the text were required. The study
has not enrolled any patients.
The rati onale for including low -marrow bl ast count (20% -30%) World Heal th Organizat ion
(WHO) -defined acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is based on the fact that it had been 
previously classified as refractory  anemia wi th excess blasts in transformat ion (RAEB -t), 
which was part of the myelodys plasti c syndrom es(MDS) spectrum, and that it is often 
treated with azacit idine-based therapy . In a phase 3 randomized trial, azacit idine 
significant ly pro longed overall survival co mpared with convent ional care regimens in 
patients wi th higher -risk MDS. In that trial, in a subgroup analysis of the 113 elderly  
patients previ ously classified as RAEB -t (now re -classified as low marrow blast AML), 
azacit idine significant ly pro longed survival and was associated with fewer total days in the 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_51185].
The rati onale for simplifying the schedule of events is based on the review of informat ion 
presented in the last Development Safety  Update Report (DSUR) (cumulative to 22 January 
2015) where there was no change to the benefit -risk evaluat ion for pevonedistat. The 
sponsor also conducted preliminary analyses (data available as of 19 July 2015) of select 
safet y parameters, including gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), urinalyses (including 
urobilinogen), and vital signs (including systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, 
and heart rate), and no safet y concerns were identified.
The rati onale for inst ituting the [ADDRESS_54090] -in-class 
molecule warrant ing a more cautious approach, and the 4-month requirement for females 
matches the contraception recommendation for males. 
The rati onale for rem oving the Qualit y of Life in Hem atological Pat ients (myelodysplast ic 
syndro mes) (QOL -E) assessment at study  centers outsi de the Uni ted States (US ) is because 
validated translat ions of the quest ionnaire are not available for all countries in which the 
sponsor intends to enroll patients.

[ZIP_CODE].11 Amendment 02 Rationale and Purposes
Rationale for Amendment 02
This protocol was revised to comply with requests rece ived by [CONTACT_51279]. To mit igate reproductive and developmental hazards, addit ional 
pregnancy testing has been added at Day  1 of each Cy cle and at end of treatment (EOT). 
Patients will  also not be allowed to donate ova o r sperm during the study  and f or [ADDRESS_54096] dose of study  drug(s). In addit ion, examples of highly effective birth 
control  methods have been included. 
In thi s study , pati ents wi th higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or chronic 
myelomo nocy tic leukemia (CMML) may  be all owed to continue study  treatm ent if they  
meet the criteria for progressive disease (PD) based only on bone marrow blast count 
(without transformat ion to acute myelogenous leukemia [AML]) if, in the clinical judgment 
ofthe invest igator, the patient is st ill receiving clinical benefit from this treatment, and the 
continuat ion is endorsed by [CONTACT_456]’s project clinician (or designee). Patients with 
low-blast AML may also be allowed to continue study  treatm ent even if t hey meet the 
criteria for PD based only on bone marrow blast counts if, in the clinical judgment of the 
investigator, the patient is st ill receiving clinical benefit from this treatment, and the 
continuat ion is endorsed by [CONTACT_456]’s project clinician ( or desi gnee). Pati ents wi th PD 
who continue on study  at the invest igator’s discretion should be reconsented before 
continuing study  treatm ent.
The rati onale to allow pat ients with therapy -related MDS, CMML, or low -blast AML 
associ ated wi th previ ous cy totox ic chemotherapy to be included in the study is based on the 
fact that patients with therapy -related MDS or AML have an equivalent outcome to certain 
patients wi th de novo disease. This is because cytogenet ics has an important impact on the 
prognosi s of patients with AML or MDS and i s the strongest prognostic factor for overall 
survival. In patients with de novo MDS with similar adverse cytogenet ics, survival is 
comparable to pati ents wi th therapy -related MDS.

Rationale for Amendment 03
This document describes the changes in reference to the protocol incorporating 
Amendment 03. The primary reason for this amendm ent is to em ploy a defini tion of

Study Pevonedistat -[ADDRESS_54107] acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). This change will facilitate integration 
of this supportive study  with the gl obal registrati on study  resul ts. This change in EFS 
definit ion affects the primary  object ive and primary endpo int of the study . For pati ents wi th 
low-blast AML, progressive disease or relapse after complete remissio n (CR) has been 
removed from  the definit ion of an event and an event in pat ients with low-blast AML is now 
defined only as death.

[ZIP_CODE].13 Amendment 04Detailed Description of Amendments to Text
The primary  secti on(s) of the protocol affected by [CONTACT_51280]
04are 
indicated. The correspond
ing text has been revised throughout the protocol.
Change 1: Update the pharmacokinet icprofile of pevonedistat and risk assessment for 
drug- d rug interacti ons.
The primary  change occurs in Secti on 1.4.1 Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Risk 
Assessment for Drug- Drug Interactions
Initial 
wording:In vitro pevonedistat is metabo lized via hydroxylatio n and oxidat ion, 
predominant ly by [CONTACT_097]3A4 with a small contribut ion fro m CYP2D6.
Preliminary PK evaluat ions from 26 patients wi th advanced soli d tum ors 
in an ongoing open -label drug -drug interaction (DDI) study  (Study  
C15011) showed that steady -state fl uconazol e (classified as a m oderate 
CYP3A inhibitor) appeared to have minimal effect (13% increased area 
under the plasma concentration versus t ime curve from zero to infinit y

Change 12: Specify analyses of primary efficacy endpo int OS.
Primary change occurs in Sect ion8.1.6.2 Analyses of Primary Efficacy Endpoints
Initial 
wording:The analysis of the primary  efficacy endpoint, EFS, will be based on the 
ITT populat ion.
For pati ents wi th HR MDS/CMML, an event is defined as death or 
transformation to AML; for patients with low -blast AML, an event is 
defined as death. EFS is defined as the time fro m rando mizat ion to the 
occurrence of an event. Stratified log -rank test will be used to compare 
EFS between the 2 arms (see Section 8.1.2 for stratificat ion factors). The 
hazard ratios along wit h the 2- sided 70% CIs and 95% CIs will be 
estimated using the unadjusted strat ified Cox model. The proportional 
hazard assumptions will be examined and sensit ivity analysis will be 
conducted if appropriate. The Kaplan -Meier survival  curves and Kaplan 
Meier m edians (if est imable), along with the 70% and 95% CIs, will also 
be provided for each treatm ent group.
Amended or 
new wording:The analysis of the primary  efficacy endpoint, OSEFS, will be based on 
HR MDS/CMML patients and the ITT population separately.
ForOS will be analyzed when approximately 60% of patients with HR 
MDS/CMML ,an event is defined as death or transformat ion to AML; for 
patients wi th low blast AML, an event is defined as death. EFS is defined
as the time from randomization to the occurrence of an event. Stratified
have experienced OS events, or termination of the study by [CONTACT_103] .
OS will be calculated from date of randomization to the date of 
patient death due to any cause. Patients without documented death 
at the time of the analysis will be censored at the date that the 
patient was last known to be alive. Unstratified log-rank test will be 
used to com pare OSEFS between the 2 treatment arms (see Section 
8.1.2 for stratificat ion factors). The hazard Hazard ratios ,along wi th the 
2-sided 70% CIs and 95% C Is,will be estimated using the unadjusted ,
stratified unstratified Cox m odel. The proporti onal hazard assumpt ions
will be examined and sensit ivity analysis will be conducted if
appropriate. TheKaplan -Meier survival  curves and Kaplan -Meier

131. PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS FOR STUDY 200363
Rationale
This pharmacokinetic/pharmacod ynamic study  is being conducted as part of an 
extrapolation strategy  to support the use of mepolizumab in the [ADDRESS_997072].  
Following the main study (Part A), subjects will be evaluated for eligibility  to continue 
into the optional long -term extension phase (Part B) of this study .  For those subjects 
determined to be eligible and for whom appropriate informed consent/assent has been 
obtained there will be the option of continuing to receive treatment with mepolizumab 
during a Long -Term Safety  / Pharmacod ynamic Phase (Part B) which will include 
Treatment and Follow -up phases (Part B Follow -up is not required for subjects 
transitioning to the long term a ccess program at the end of Part B) .  Part B will provide 
data to assess the long -term safet y and tolerability of mepolizumab in this paediatric 
population and will also provide data to assess the durability  of the pharmacody namic 
response to mepolizumab.
Objective(s)/Endpoint(s)

17This Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacod ynamic Phase (Part A) stud y will consist of three 
stages: Pre -Screening/Screening/Run- in, Treatment and Follow -up. 
Pre-Screening/Screening/Run -in:  Subjects will attend an initial Pre -screening visit to 
assess their willingness and eligibility  to participate in the study .  The Pre -screening visit 
will include: informed consent, demography, exacerbations and concomitant medications.  
Visit 1(Screening) will include a ph ysicalexam, screening laboratory  tests, screening 
ECG and other assessments to determine suitability  to participate in this study .  The Pre -
screening visit may  be conducted at the same clinic visit as Visit 1(Screening).  Subjects 
meeting the Visit 1(Screening) eligibility  criteria will enter a Run- in period of up to 2 
weeks to allow for receipt and review of the lab results and ECG. 
Part A Treatment:   Those subjects meeting all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria by  
[CONTACT_4838] [ADDRESS_997075] body weight (40 
mg for sub jects <40 kg and 100 mg for subjects ≥ 40 kg). Subjects will receive their first 
dose of mepolizumab at Visit 2 and enter into the Treatment phase of the study .  Subjects 
shall be observed for a minimum of 60 minutes in the clinic following each injection.   
Safety  monitoring of subjects will occur during SC administration and for 1 hour after the 
three administrations in Part A and then follow monitoring policies for the center in Part 
B.  Such monitoring will include general safety  monitoring including mon itoring for both 
systemic h ypersensitivity (i.e., allergic/IgE -mediated and non- allergic) and local site 
reactions.  In the event of an acute severe reaction (e.g., anaph ylaxis) following 
administration of mepolizumab, there are personnel/staff onsite at t he treatment facility  
who are appropriately  trained in basic life support to manage the patient including 
administration of medications (e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) and have access to a s ystem that can 
promptly  transport the patient to another facility for additional care if appropriate.
Those subjects who enter the run-in period but do not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria 
will be deemed Run -in failures and will not be dosed in the study . The reason for any  
Run-in failure will be recorded in the eCRF.
During th e Part A Treatment phase, all subjects will receive mepolizumab either 40mg 
(subjects <40kg at Visit 2) or 100 mg SC (subjects ≥ 40kg at Visit 2) at week 0 (Visit 2), 
week 4 (Visit 3) and week 8 (Visit 4) which will provide therapeutic coverage through to 
week 12 (Visit 6/End of Therapy Visit).  Visit 6 will mark the end of the treatment phase.
Subjects will visit the clinic at week 9 (Visit 5) to allow for measurement of the 
approximate peak mepolizumab concentration.  
Part A Follow -up:  Following completi on of Visit 6, subjects will enter into the Follow -
up phase which will consist of two additional visits at weeks 16 (Visit 7) and 20 (Visit 8). 2017N314087_00

2. INTRODUCTION
Three randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled trials have investigated the efficacy , 
tolerability , pharmacokinetics and pharmacody namics of mepolizumab administered IV 
or SC in subjects 12 and older with severe eosinophilic asthma ( Pavord, 2012, Ortega ,
2014, Bel , 2014).  Additionally , a randomized, double -blind trial with I V mepolizumab 
administration to treat eosinophilic e sophagitis in children ages 2 -17 years of age has 
been conducted. However, no trial for children aged less than 12 years old with severe 
eosinophilic asthma or with the SC route has been conducted.  
The generated data from the current study  will be used t o support the extrapolation of the 
safet y and efficacy results from the 3 randomized trials in adolescents and adults to 
children ages 6 -11 and ultimately  an alternative therapeutic option to treat school- age 
children with severe eosinophilic asthma.  With therapeutic proteins, such as the 
monoclonal antibody  mepolizumab, it is common to extrapolate the results of adult 
studies to pediatric subjects in consideration of the pharmacokinetic properties of such 
molecules ( Xu, 2013). It is suggested that a principal reason this extrapolation is possible 
is that for monoclonal antibodies targeting a soluble ligand, such as mepolizumab, 
metabolism and clearance are unlikel y to be affected by [CONTACT_730046].  Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) tend to be highly specific and 
therefore less likel y to present off -target toxicity  resulting in wider therapeutic index.  
The pharmacokinetics across age- groups is generally  consistent once bod y-size is ta ken 
into account ( Xu, 2013).  Taking into account these characteristics, mAbs are an ideal 
class of medications for the extrapolation of safet y and efficacy data from adults and 
adolescents to children.  This approach per mits a more efficient, stream- lined 
development program for this age -group and minimizes the need for large, redundant 
clinical trials in this sub -set of patients. 2017N314087_00
[ADDRESS_997078] of 
large efficacy  trials might prove challenging in particular if the prevalence of disease 
particular phenoty pe (e.g., severe eosinophilic asthma) in the pediatr ic population is quite 
low. Nonetheless it remains equally  important to provide alternative therapeutic options 
to the pediatric population.  This pharmacokinetic/pharmacod ynamic study  is conducted 
to support the use of mepolizumab in children aged 6- [ADDRESS_997079] severe eosinophilic asthma and will ultimatel y support an extrapolation 
strategy  of the safet y and efficacy data observed in the adult population with severe 
eosinophilic asthma to this pediatric population. This study  will also assess safet y, 
tolerability, and immunogenicity  of mepolizumab in this p opulation along with clinical 
outcome measures, including the ACQ -7 (Juniper , 1999, Juniper , 2005, Juniper , 2006) 
and the C-ACT.  
In ad dition a pre- planned anal ysis comparing the body weight -adjusted clearance between 
adults and subjects [ADDRESS_997080] information on the 
blood eosinophil reduction afforded b y mepolizumab 40 or 100 mg SC in this age group 
that can be compared to the adult and adolescent population. A Population- PK (Pop -PK) 
analysis of IV data from pediatric patients 2 to 17 y ears of age with eosinophilic 
esophagitis using the previous adult meta -analysis IV model showed that the adult IV 
pharmacokinetics model from multiple studies, diseases and populations, predicts 
pediatric I V pharmacokinetics (Assa'ad , 2011). This study  aims to demonstrate this is 
also valid following SC administration. 
2.2. Brief Background
2.2.1. Severe Eosinophilic A sthma in Children
In the western world, asthma is the most prevalent disorder in school- age children with 
an incidence of 5 -8%. ( CDC , 2013)  A small subset of this population, approximately  5% 
(Bossley , 2012) are considered to have severe asth ma, which is defined as patients with a 
lack of control despi[INVESTIGATOR_398880] 4 or 5 of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines 
or patients that will lose asthma control if they  are stepped down from this treatment. 
(GINA, 2015).  These children are often unable to lead a normal life and have an affected 
quality  of life due to missed school day s and limited ability  to participate in phy sical 
activities due to persistent sy mptoms and the high frequency  of exacerbations. (GINA, 
2015). According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC , 2013), 
children ages [ADDRESS_997081] one asthma exacerbation per y ear miss a combined total 
of 10.5 million day s of school ( CDC , 2013).  Significant asthma exacerbations also carry 
increased healthcare costs.  I n fact, patients who experience an exacerbation are three 
times more costly  per y ear to treat compared to patients who remain exacerbation free 
(Lane
, 2006).  Another deleterious outcome for children with severe asthma is a  2017N314087_00

200363
21progressive loss of lung function. ( Szefler , 2014).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_730020], there has been a paucit y of new classes of 
medications developed for this condition.  I n the past decade, only  [ADDRESS_997082] been introduced: anti -leukotrienes and an ti-IgE.  There is a significant 
unmet need for new medications to provide asthma control in severe childhood asthma.
Three key  efficacy  studies support the efficacy  and safet y of mepolizumab in severe 
eosinophilic asthma in adults and adolescents ( Pavord , 2012, Ortega , 2014, Bel, 2014). In 
addition a Dose -ranging Pharmacokinetic (PK)/Pharmacod ynamic (PD) Study  
(MEA114092) characterized the dose response for blood eosinophil reduction.
The exacerbation studies and the OCS reduction study  were randomized, double -blind, 
parallel -group, placebo -controlled designs.  In addition to frequent exacerbations, the 
subjects in the severe eosinophilic asthma program have a significant burden of steroid 
use, thus reduction of OCS use while maintaining asthma control is an additional key  
treatment outcome.  Since the exacerbation studies required maintenance of standard of 
care (no dose adjustments), the ability of mepolizumab to reduce OCS use was studied in 
a specific stud y (Bel, 2014).
2.2.2. Pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab
Mepolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody  (mAb) that exhibits dose -
proportional and time-independent pharmacokinetics. After SC administration to adults 
and adolescents mepolizumab is absorbed slowl y, with an absolute bioavailability  in the 
arm of 74–
80% and median time to maximum concentration ( Tmax) values ranging from 
4–8 day s. Mepolizumab distribute s into a central volume of distribution (Vc) similar to 
plasma volume with a distribution half- life of 1–2 day s, and has a steady -state volume of 
distribution (Vss) of 1.5–2 times plasma volume (55–85 mL /kg). Mepolizumab is
catabolized by  [CONTACT_730047], not restricted to hepatic tissue, and is 
cleared slowly  with a terminal- phase elimination half -life of approximately  20 day s, 
irrespective of the route of administration, and mean s ystemic clearance (CL ) of 1.9 –3.3 
mL/day/kg. Mepolizumab doe s not undergo target -mediated clearance. When dosed 
every  four weeks, mepolizumab shows two- fold stead y-state accumulation, irrespective 
of route of administration, consistent with the terminal- phase elimination half -life of [ADDRESS_997083] of bod y weight on mepolizumab exposure was not deemed clinically relevant. The 
pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab is consistent across studies, diseases and ethnicities, 
with pediatric pharmacok inetics predictable from adults. Of note, a previous study  was 
conducted with mepolizumab IV in pediatric subjects 2- 17 years old with eosinophilic 
esophagitis ( Assa'ad , 2011). After adjusting for body weight via weigh t-based dosing, age 
was not a determinant of exposure. A population PK anal ysis of the data using the 
previous adult meta -analy sis IV model described the data adequatel y without parameter  2017N314087_00
2014 N216964_05 CONFIDENTIA L
200363
22estimation or bias, imply ing that adult pharmacokinetics, estimated from multiple studies, 
diseases and populations, predicts pediatric pharmacokinetics.
2.2.3. Pharmacody namics of mepolizumab
Mepolizumab pharmacody namics has been studied in multiple Clinical Pharmacology  
and efficacy  studies in multiple diseases. Mepolizumab tre atment produces a consistent 
and sustained reduction in blood eosinophil count relative to baseline whose magnitude 
and duration is dose -dependent, imply ing that full saturation of IL -5 target can be 
achieved. There are non -linear dose -and concentration -responses to blood eosinophil 
reduction. Dose -response is unchanged by [CONTACT_730048], after adjusting for 
bioavailability. An inhibitory  Imax model estimated the SC doses resulting in 50% and 
90% of the maximum effect (ID50 and ID90) to be 11 and 99 mg, respectively , 
corresponding to IV doses of 8 and 74 mg. This finding was further confirmed by  [CONTACT_730049] 3 study  MEA115588 where similar blood eosinophil reductions 
were observed at corresponding doses of mepolizumab IV 75 mg and SC 100 mg .
Mepolizumab also reduces eosinophils in sputum and bone marrow ( Pavord , 2012, 
Flood -Page , 2007).
Blood eosinophil counts assessed in a pediatric population aged 2 –17 y ears w ith 
eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) ( Assa'ad, 2011) following IV administration showed the 
magnitude of the eosinophil reduction and time to return towards baseline were dose -
dependent. At Week 12, following mepolizuma b IV 0.55, 2.5 and 10 mg/kg eosinophil 
reductions were 77%, 69%, and 81%, respectivel y; similar to adult data at corresponding 
doses.
2.2.4. Safety  of mepolizumab following administration in Children and 
Adolescents
Although no data are available in pediatric pat ients with severe asthma (aged 6- 11 
years), pediatric subjects 2 -17 years with EoE ( Assa'ad, 2011) received one of three 
intravenous doses of mepolizumab (0.55, 2.5 or 10mg/kg ) every  [ADDRESS_997084] common AEs were vomiting, diarrhea, oropharyngeal 
pain, upper abdominal pain, sy mptoms known to be associated with the disease state 
(Sorser , 2013), and nasophary ngitis, headache, cough, and p yrexia.   No AEs appeared to 
be dose -related.   SAEs were reported for 3 subjects: chest discomfort, esophageal injury  
(occurred during esophagogastroduodenoscop y (EGD) study  procedure), and foreign 
body  trauma; none were considered related to mepolizumab by [CONTACT_093].  
Immunogenicit y was conducted with the former analytical assay, which showed some 
transient positive anti- drug antibodies; however, there were no neutralizing antibodies 
detected. Furthermore, there was no apparent impact on the clinical , pharmacody namic or 
pharmacokinetic profiles. These findings indicated low risks and/or concerns associated 
with the immunogenicity profile. Detailed electrocardiogram data showed no clinically  
relevant trends related to prolongation of the QT/QTc interva l; no cardiac or ECG -related 
adverse events were reported.  No clinicall y relevant trends in vital signs or laboratory
 
data were observed.  In summary , all doses of mepolizumab demonstrated a favorable 
safet y profile; common adverse events were non -serious, not- unexpected with this 
disease, and manageable with minimal supportive care. 2017N314087_00

4. STUDY DESIGN
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed with the exception of immed iate safety  
concerns. Therefore, adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those 
specified in the Time and Events Table s (Table 3and Table 4), are essential and required 
for study conduct. 
Supplementary  study  conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is 
provided in the accompany ing Study  Reference Manual (SRM). The SRM will provide 
the site personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does not 
impact subject safet y.
This is a multi -centre, open -label stud y that will assess the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacod ynamics of three (4 -weekl y) doses of mepolizumab [ADDRESS_997085] of two phases: Part A will consist of Pre-
Screening/Screening/Run- in, Treatment, and Follow -up.  Part B will consist of L ong-
Term Treatment and Follow-up.  The Part B follow -up phase i s not required for subjects 
transitioning to the long t ermaccess program.
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacody namic Phase (Part A )
Pre-Screening/Screening/Run -in:  Subjects will attend an initial Pre -screening visit to 
assess their willingness and eligibility  to pa rticipate in the study .  The Pre -screening visit 
will include: informed consent; demograph y exacerbations and concomitant medications.  
Visit 1(Screening) will include a ph ysical exam, screening laboratory  test, screening ECG 
and other assessments to deter mine suitability  to participate in this study .  The pre -
screening visit may  be conducted at the same clinic visit as Visit 1(Screening).  Subjects 
meeting the Visit 1(Screening) eligibility  criteria will enter a Run- in period of up to 2 
weeks to allow for receipt and review of the lab results and ECG.

observed for a minimum of 60 minutes in the clinic following each injection.  Safety  
monitoring of subjects w ill occur during SC administration and for 1 hour after the three 
administrations in Part A and then follow monitoring policies for the center in Part B.  
Such monitoring will include general safet y monitoring including monitoring for both 
systemic h yperse nsitivity (i.e., allergic/IgE-mediated and non- allergic) and local site 
reactions.  In the event of an acute severe reaction (e.g., anaph ylaxis) following 
administration of mepolizumab, there are personnel/staff onsite at the treatment facility  
who are appropriately  trained in basic life support to manage the patient including 
administration of medications (e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) and have access to a s ystem that can 
promptly  transport the patient to another facility  for additional care if appropriate .
Those subjects who enter the run -in period but do not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria 
will be deemed Run -in failures and will not be dosed in the study . The reason for any  
Run-in failure will be recorded in the eCRF.
During the Treatment phase, all subjects w ill receive mepolizumab either 40mg SC 
(subjects <40kg at Visit 2) or 100 mg SC (subjects ≥ 40kg at Visit 2) at week 0 (Visit 2), 
week 4 (Visit 3) and week 8 (Visit 4). These doses should provide therapeutic coverage 
through to week 12 (Visit 6/End of Thera py Visit).  Visit 6 will mark the end of the 
treatment phase. 
Subjects will visit the clinic at week 9 (Visit 5) to provide a blood sample to measure the 
approximate peak mepolizumab concentration.  
Study  visits will have a window of  3 day s; except for Visit 5 which should be 
scheduled  1 day .
Follow -up:Following completion of Visit 6, subjects will enter into the Follow -up phase 
which will consist of two additional visits at weeks 16 (Visit 7) and 20 (Visit 8).For 
subjects who had a positive anti-mepolizumab antibody  response at the Follow -up (Visit 
8) (or last stud y visit at which immunogenicit y was assessed if the Follow -up (Visit 8) 
immunogenicit y sample is not available), an attempt will be made to obtain a serum 
sample for anti -mepolizumab antibo dies at least [ADDRESS_997087] will be regarded as having completed Part A if they  complete all phases of Part 
A (Pre -Screening/Screening/Run -in, Treatment, and Follow -up).  Subjects who complete 
Part A will participate for approximately  22 weeks.
Long -Term Safety / Pharmacodynamic Phase (Part B)
At the end of Part A, a benefit/risk assessment will be performed b y the Investigator and 
if this assessment supports continued therap y with mepolizumab the subject can continue 
into Part B following the Part A Follow -up (Visit 8).
Long -Term Treatment:   Those subjects meeting the eligibility  criteria for the long -term 
phase of the stud y at Visit 9 will receive mepolizumab 40 or 100 mg SC, (depending on 
subject body weight measured at Visit 9;  40 mg for subjects <40 kg and 100 mg for  2017N314087_00

Approximately  40 male or female subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma, aged 6 to 11 
years inclusive at screening (Visit 1), will be screened to achieve approximately  28 
eligible subjects entering the Part A treatment phase to allow availability  of 20 evaluable 
subjects, with a minimum of six subjects enrolled in the < [ADDRESS_997091] who has received all three doses of

the eligibility  criteria for Part B will be allowed to participate in Part B.
4.4. Design Justification
This study  is designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacody namics of
mepolizumab as add- on to best standard of care in children w ith severe eosinophilic 
asthma aged 6 to 11 years to support the extrapolation of the safet y and efficacy data 
observed in the adult/adolescent population to this pediatric population. The design of the 
study  aims to balance the challenging access to the t arget pediatric population and the 
study  constraints with the scientific evidence to support the use of mepolizumab in this 
population. 
An additional secondary  objective of the study  is to compare the bod yweight- adjusted 
clearance between adults and subje cts aged 6 to 11 y ears old. Three repeat doses of 
mepolizumab administered every 4 weeks subcutaneously  to subjects aged 6 to 11 y ears 
is considered adequate to achieve the PK and PD objectives of the study .  Blood 
eosinophil count is consistently  reduced following mepolizumab administration, which 
make blood eosinophils a suitable PD endpoint for evaluation.
The study  population reflects the intended population for therapeutic use to support the 
extrapolation strategy . 
A treatment phase duration of 12 wee ks is considered sufficient to support the primary  
PK and PD endpoint of the study . A dose ranging PK/PD study  (MEA114092) of 
mepolizumab administered intravenousl y (75 mg) or subcutaneousl y (12.5, 125 and 250 
mg) with a similar duration was conducted in a dult asthmatic subjects with elevated 
blood eosinophil levels. Concordance in the blood eosinophil reduction at 75 mg IV 
between this study  and the 12 -month duration phase 2/3 study  (Pavord, 2012) confirms 
suitability of the 12 weeks duration treatment for the chosen endpoint. Furthermore, 
comparable blood eosinophil count reduction was observed at 75 mg IV and 100 mg SC 
in a phase 3 study (MEA115588) with consistent blood eosinophil reduction observed 
from 12 weeks on wards. These data support conducting a stud y of 12 weeks duration  
and will allow comparison with adult/adolescent data to support the extrapolation of the 
safet y and efficacy data observed in adults/adolescents in the severe asthma phase [ADDRESS_997092] the robustness of the study  design.  
A sample on week 9 (Visit 5) was included to collect information close to mepolizumab 
Tmaxfollowing SC administration (see Section 9.2for further details).
The assumption is the PK in pediatric subjects 6 -11 years old is comparable to the PK in 
adults therefore the adult PK model was used to generate a database of pediatric subjects 
from which random subjects with clinical trial characteristics were selected. Data from 
the different trials were then fitted, body weight -adjusted clearance estimated and 
compared to the known value (i.e. the true value from which the pediatric subjects were 
simulated from) (see Section 9.2for further details).
No long- term data (up to 52 weeks) documenting the safet y and tolerability  of 
mepolizumab in children aged [ADDRESS_997093] body weight, administered every  
4 weeks has been selected for this 6- 11 years old pediatric population which is predicted 
to provide similar exposure to the SC dose that was investigated in the adult/adolescent 
population in the phase 3 program. This dose was shown to be efficacious and well 
tolerated and therefore the doses selected in this study  are expected to confer clinical 
activity  in the 6- 11 years old age group. A non- linear inhibitory  dose -response model
identified 99 mg administered SC as providing 90% of the maximum achievable blood 
eosinophil reduction in the adult program. A similar baseline blood eosinophil count is 
anticipated in the severe eosinophilic asthma pediatric population, as was seen in adults 
(Giubergia , 2012; Jenkins , 2003), hence a similar magnitude of blood eosinophil 
reduction is also expected. 
An extrapolation of exposure (AUC (0-inf) ) using allometric principles confirmed from 
pediatric subjects with EoE in study  MEE103219 ( Assa'ad , 2011) showed that for the 
weight range to be studied, (15 kg and upwards), two weight bands of 15 to less than 40 
and ≥40 kg provided a mean exposure within 25% of the adult 100 mg SC target 
exposure across the entire weight range. This precision compares very  favourably  with an 
optimal solution of 21% across the wider weight range 1 –100 kg based on five weight 
bands ([COMPANY_004] Document Number 2014N223495_00).
These proposed doses are further supported by [CONTACT_49750] y data collected in the previously 
conducted stud y MEE103219 in which intravenous doses up to 10 mg/kg were 
inves tigated in pediatric subjects 2
-17 years old with eosinophilic esophagitis, from  2017N314087_00

4.6. Benefit:Risk A ssessment
Summaries of findings from both clinical and non-clinical studies conducted with 
mepolizumab (SB240563) can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.
Serious adverse events (SAEs) reported from ongoing clinical studies with mepolizumab 
are reviewed dail y by [CONTACT_730050] (SAE) Co -ordinator (project Medical 
Monitor. Additionally , regular, s ystematic reviews of emerging safet y data from all 
clinical studies are conducted by  [CONTACT_28920]- house multi disciplinary  Safet y Review Team 
(SRT) which provides a central and dedicated forum for review of emerging data which 
could impact subject safety . The SRT, which includes the project Medical Monitor, other 
physicians assigned to the project, clinical scientists and a statistician reviews blinded 
and unblinded (i.e., from open -label trials) safet y data from ongoing clinical studies with 
mepolizumab on a regular basis and conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the safet y 
data upon completion of each stud y. Moreover, an integrated analysis of safety across the 
program is comp leted annually  when additional safet y data are available from completed 
studies. A reassessment of benefit risk and the current Developmental Core Safety  
Information (DCSI) is completed at each SRT meeting subsequent to review of new data. 
There is also a standard and comprehensive process for the reporting and management of 
Sentinel Events at [COMPANY_004]. (A Sentinel Event is an SAE that is not necessaril y drug -related, 
but that has been associated historically  with adverse reactions for other drugs, and is 
there fore worth y of heightened pharmacovigilance. At [COMPANY_004] Sentinel Events include 
acquired long QT s yndrome, agranulocy tosis, anaphy lactic and anaphy lactoid reactions, 
hepatotoxicity , renal failure, seizures, and Stevens Johnson sy ndrome/toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_184793].) Subsequent to the reporting of a Sentinel Event, the Medical Monitor 
promptly  notifies the SRT and the [COMPANY_004] Global Safet y Board and leads a thorough and 
comprehensive follow -up of the Sentinel Event with collection of all relevant data.

Investigational Pro duct (IP) SB [ADDRESS_997094] occurred following 
mepolizumab administration; most reactions 
have been non- serious and resolved without 
sequelae.  These r eactions generally occur 
within hours of administration, but in some 
instances had a delayed onset (i.e., days).  
An increase in the incidence of local site 
reactions was observed with SC administration 
of mepolizumab compared with placebo, but the 
overal l incidence was low.   The most common 
symptoms associated with subcutaneous 
injections included: pain, erythema, swelling, 
itching, and burning sensation.

Investigator’.
Risk of Immunogenicity Biopharmaceutical products may elicit anti- drug 
antibody (ADA) and neutralizing antibody 
(NAB), which ha ve the potential to modulate 
pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) 
or produce adverse reactions. However, 
humanized and fully human antibodies are less 
immunogenic than mouse or chimeric 
monoclonal antibodies.
Mepolizumab has low immunogenic potential
and anti -mepolizumab antibody formation is not 
expected to impact the overall clinical benefit of 
mepolizumab treatment.  Both incidence and 
titer data from completed studies demonstrate a 
low risk for loss of efficacy associated with AEs 
and/or altered P K/PD.  
Immunogenicity data reported to date across the 
mepolizumab development program are 
summarized in the IB; See Section 5.4 ‘Clinical 
Immunogenicity’ and a summary of

of non- pharmacologic effects on cardiovascular 
(CV) function. 
No AEs concerning cardiac conduction or

dosed at 10 mg/kg or 750 mg.
No clinically relevant trends observed in ECG 
data in humans.
In one study in subjects with severe refractory 
asthma, cardiac events were reported in similar 
frequencies across treatment groups with a small 
numerical increase observed in serious ischemic 
cardiac events in the mepolizumab -treated 
groups. However, an integrated safety analysis 
of all placebo -controlled multiple dose asthma 
trials showed similar frequenc y of SAEs 
reported overall from the cardiac and vascular 
system organ class (SOC). Additionally, similar 
findings were observed in other SOCs with 
thrombotic events (e.g., stroke in the Nervous 
System SOC). Data from 2 subsequently 
completed placebo -contro lled severe asthma 
trials did not show an increased risk of serious 
ischemic cardiac events; there were no new 
reports in any treatment groups including Daily monitoring of SAE Serious Adverse

384.6.2. Benefit A ssessment
Study  200363 will characterize the pharmacokinet ics and pharmacod ynam ics of 
mepolizumab administered subcutaneousl y to subjects aged 6 to 11 years old with severe 
eosinophilic asthma. This pediatric population of asthma subjects has not been evaluated 
as having received benefit from treatment with mepol izumab.  However, [COMPANY_004] conducted 
a randomized, double -blind, parallel group clinical trial to evaluate the safety , 
tolerability , pharmacokinetics and pharmacod ynamics ofmepolizumab in 59 children and 
adolescents 2 to 17 years old with eosinophilic esophagitis ( Assa'ad, 2011).  Each subject 
received one of three intravenous doses (0.55, 2.5 or 10mg/kg ) every  [ADDRESS_997097] observed (reduction of blood eosinophils) was 
consistent with p hase 3 studies ( Bel, 2014 and Ortega , 2014).  In addition to investigating 
the pharmacokinetics and pharmacod ynamics of mepolizumab in a pediatric population 
with severe asthma, thi s study  200363 will assess the incidence of adverse events and the 
rate of exacerbations to assess safety and efficacy of the treatment in this population.
Exacerbations are a major concern to asthma patients and lead to a worsening of the 
quality  of life for subjects. I nterventions in at risk populations that can reduce or 
eliminate serious exacerbations will improve a patient’s quality  of life and may  reduce 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. Subjects participating in this study will be required to attend visits 
approxima tely every  [ADDRESS_997098] asthma care.
4.6.3. Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion
Data from mepolizumab preclinical and clinical development demonstrate the ability  of 
mepolizumab to inhibit IL-5 and, consequently , treat inflammatory  conditions linked to 
an eosinophilic signal, such as asthma subjects predisposed to exacerbations. To date, the 
safet y profile of mepolizumab across other mepolizumab studies has been favorable for 
all the patien t populations studied. Adverse events (AEs) reported commonly  have been 
manageable with minimal medical intervention. Furthermore, preclinical data and the 
observed safet y profile to date in over [ADDRESS_997099] will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following criteria

7.1.1. Pre-Screening Failures (Visit 0)
A subject will be assigned a subject number at the time the informed consent is signed.  A 
subject who is assigned a subject number but is not screened further will be considered a 
pre-screen failure.  Note:  Visit 0 (Pre -Screening) and Visit 1 (Screening) may  be

7.2.1. Adverse Events (A E) and Serious A dverse Events (S AEs)
The investigator and their designees are responsible for detecting, documenting and 
reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE. 
In line with clinical practice, monitoring of patients following administration of a 
biologic agent including mepolizumab should be done to detect and report the occurrence 
of sy stemic (i.e., allergic/hy persensitivity  and non -allergic) reactions.  Hy persensitivity  
reactions will be monitored using the diagnost ic criteria for anaphylaxis as outlined by  
[CONTACT_941] 2006 Joint NI AID/FAAN Second S ymposium on Anaphy laxis [ Sampson , 2006]  2017N314087_00

reactions.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of an Adverse Event (A E)
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product.
Note: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  
associated with the use of a medicinal product.  For marketed medicinal pro ducts, this 
also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse.
Events meeting the definition of an AE include:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequ ency  and/or intensity  of the condition
New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even 
though it may  have been present prior to the start of the study
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction
Signs , symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE) unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -
harming intent. This should be reported regardless of sequelae .
“Lack of efficacy ” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and sy mptoms and/or clinical sequelae 
resulting from lack of efficacy  will be reported if they  fulfil the definition of an AE or 
SAE.  
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:
Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscop y, appendectom y); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE
Situations where an unto ward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen
The disease/disorder b eing studied, or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s 
condition
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of a Serious A dverse Event (SA E)
A serious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurr ence that, at an y dose: 2017N314087_00
2014N216964_05 CONFIDENTIA L
200363
55a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
NOTE:  The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an 
event, which h ypothetically  might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23916]:  In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] 
(usually  involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23917]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s 
office or out -patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23918].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23919], 
the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was 
necessary , the AE should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre- existing condition that did not wor sen 
from baseline is not considered an AE.
d.Results in disability /incapacity , or
NOTE:  The term disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to 
conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of rel ativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may  
interfere or prevent everyday  life functions but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
f.Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_730027].  These should also be considered serious.  
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency  
or drug abuse.
g.All events of possible drug -induced liver injury  with hyperbilirubinaemia defined as 
ALT 3xULN andbilirubin 2xUL N (>35% direct) (or ALT 3xUL N and 
INR>1.5, if INR measured) termed ‘Hy ’s Law’ events ( INR measurement is not 
required and the threshold value stated will not apply  to patients receiving 
anticoagulants).
NOTE: bilirubin fractionation is performed if testing is available. If testing is 
unavailable, record presence of urinary  bilirubin detectable on dipstick indicating 
direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury . If testing is unavailable and a 
subject meets the criterion of total bilirubin 2xULN, then the event is still reported 
as an SAE. If INR is obtained, include values on the SAE form. INR elevations >1.[ADDRESS_997119] severe liver injury .    2017N314087_00

[IP_ADDRESS]. Time period and Frequency  for collectin g AE and SA E information
AEs and SAEs will be collected from the start of Study  Treatment until the follow -
up contact (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), at the timepoints specified in the Time and Events 
Table ( Table 3and Table 4).
Medical occurrences that begin prior to the start of study treatment but after 
obtaining informed consent may  be recorded on the Medical History /Current 
Medical Conditions section of the eCRF.
Any SAEs assessed as related to study  participation (e.g., protocol- mandated 
procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a [COMPANY_004] product 
will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the stud yup to and 
including an y follow -up contact. 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours, as indicated in 
Appendix 3 .
Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study 
subje cts. However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE, including a death, at an y 
time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the 
event reasonabl y related to the study  treatment or study  participation, the investigator 
must p romptly  notify  [COMPANY_004].
NOTE: The method of recording, evaluating and assessing causality  of AEs and SAEs 
plus procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports to [COMPANY_004] are provided in 
Appendix 3 .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended 
and non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrence.  Appropriate questions include:
 “How does your child seem to feel?”
 “Has your child had an y (other) medical problems or seem to act differently in an y 
way since his/her last visit/contact?”
 “Has your child needed to take an y medicines, other than those provided in this 
study , since his/her last visit/conta ct?”
[IP_ADDRESS]. Follo w-up of A Es and SA Es
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
subject at subsequent visits/contacts.  All SAEs and non- serious AEs of special interest 
will be followed until resolution, until the c ondition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise 
explained, or until the subject is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 5.5). Further 
information on follow- up procedures is given in Appendix 3 . 2017N314087_00

7.7. Asthma Control Questionnaire -7 (A CQ-7)
The ACQ -7 (Juniper , 1999, Juniper , 2005, Juniper , 2006, Juniper , 2010) will be 
administered b y a trained clinic staff member at each visit indicated in the Time and 
Events schedule ( Table 3and Table 4).  The ACQ -7 is a simple questionnaire to measure 
the adequacy  of asthma control and change in asthma control which occurs either 
spontaneously  or as a result of treatment ( Appendix 5 ).  The questionnaire includes 7 
items; and requires a 1 week recall (for items on sy mptoms and rescue inha ler use).  The 
ACQ -IAhas a multidimensional construct assessing s ymptoms (5 items administered by  
[CONTACT_730057]) and rescue 
bronchodilator use (query to child or parent), and FEV1% (1 item) completed by  [CONTACT_168306] ( Appendix 6 ).  The ACQ -7 uses a 7 -point scale (0=no impairment, 6= maximum 
impairment for s ymptoms and rescue use; and 7 categories for FEV1%).  The instrument 
has a reported high test- retest reproducibili ty with an intraclass correlation coefficient 
=0.90.  The minimally  important change in score is 0.5. The ACQ -IA will be 
administered to subjects for whom an appropriate translation is available. If necessary , 
the draft ACQ -IA will be administered until a final linguistically  validated version 
becomes available. The draft version of the ACQ- IA includes the linguistically validated 
ACQ -[ADDRESS_997127] (C- ACT)
The Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) assesses asthma control in children 4-11 
years of age ( Liu, 2007, Liu, 2010). The ACT will be completed on paper. The C -ACT 
should be completed prior to other study  procedures to ensure that responses are not 
influenced b y interactions with study site staff.  The C -ACT is a 7- question, 2 -part 
questionnaire, with items one through 4 to be completed by  [CONTACT_2252] (with assistance 
from a caregiver, as needed) and items 5 to 7 to be completed by  [CONTACT_18629] ( Appendix 
10
).   A total sum score based upon responses to all items is calculated to provide an 
overall measure of asthma control. 
7.9. Asthma Exacerbations
At each stud y visit the investigator will make an assessment of the occurrence of an 
asthma exacerbation.  Any asthma exacerbation will be recorded on the app ropriate eCRF 
page.
An exacerbation of asthma as defined as:
Worsening of asthma which requires use of s ystemic corticosteroids1and/or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31739]/or Emergency  Department (ED) visits.

629. STATISTICA L CONSIDERA TIONS AND DATA 
ANALYSES
No formal hypothesis will be tested.  
Population -PK (Pop -PK) parameter estimates will be presented (AUC (0-inf), clearance, 
Cmax, t 1/2).  Descriptive statistics will be used to present the subject demographics, 
subject st udy accountability , post -hoc individual pharmacokinetic parameter estimates 
(e.g. AUC (0-inf), clearance, C max, t1/2), blood eosinophil count and ratio of blood eosinophil 
count to baseline at week 12, IL5 levels, selected clinical outcome measures (FEV 1, 
ACQ-7, C- ACT, asthma exacerbations), and safety  assessments (adverse events, vital 
signs, ECGs and laboratories) and immunogenicity .  Confidence intervals may  be applied 
where appropriate.  In addition a pre -planned analy sis comparing the bodyweight-
adjuste d clearance between adults and subjects 6 -11 years with severe eosinophilic 
asthma will be conducted, with appropriate confidence intervals applied.
Details of the statistical considerations and data analy ses will be detailed in the Reporting 
and Anal ysis Plan (RAP). 
9.1. Hypotheses
Formal h ypothesis testing will not be performed.
9.2. Sample Size Considerations
The sample size was determined by  [CONTACT_730058] A of the study , based on previous PK/PD studies. A ped iatric 
population -PK trial simulation ([COMPANY_004] Document Number 2014N223495_00 ) was used to 
determine the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE, i.e. standard deviation) in estimated 
exposure (AUC (0-inf)) as a function of sa mple size, pharmacokinetic sampling scheme and 
model assumptions. Based on 1000 trial simulations per scenario, a sample size of 16 -32 
subjects is sufficient to maintain precision in exposure estimation (and hence 
body weight -adjusted clearance) below 20%, (as compared with the  guideline 40%), 
providing five pharmacokinetic samples (including one close to Tmax) are collected and 
four parameters are fixed from adult values in the population -PK model.
For blood eosinophils it is expected that this trial will have a similar residual variance to 
that observed in the MEA115588 trial, where a residual SD of 0.7867 on the log 
transformed scale was observed. Based on this assumption, a total of 20 subjects should 
provide sufficient precision for the 95% confidence interval for the ratio to baseline to lie 
within a ratio of 50% of the observed value. For example if the observed ratio to baseline 
for blood eosinophils is 0.14, the reduction observed in trial MEA115588, the 95% 
confidence interval is expected to be fr om 0.09 to 0.20.
With regards to the pre -planned secondary  anal ysis, the trial simulations also showed that 
for the proposed sample size and sampling scheme, 80% of simulated trials y ielded a 
body weight -adjusted apparent clearance with 90% confidence limit s falling within the 
bounds 0.8 – 1.25 of the adult apparent clearance value ( CL/F of 0.29 L/day ). This  2017N314087_00
2014N216964_05 CONFIDENTIA L
200363
63precision is deemed sufficient for extrapolation purposes from adults to pediatric subjects 
aged 6 to 11 years supported by [CONTACT_594331] y ([COMPANY_004] Document Num ber 2014N223495_00).
Patients who complete Part A and who meet the eligibility  criteria for Part B will be 
allowed to participate in Part B and no specific sample size requirements are defined.
9.2.1. Sample Size A ssum ptions
No sample size assumptions are assumed bey ond the demonstrated comparability  
between adult pharmacokinetic parameters and those observed in an intravenous study in 
children aged 2 -17 years with eosinophilic esophagitis.
9.2.2. Sample Size Sensitivity
Furth er details of the PK trial simulation sample size estimation methodology  are 
provided in [COMPANY_004] Document Number 2014N223495_00.

[PHONE_15163].5. Stud y and Site Closure
Upon completion or premature discontinuation of the study , the [COMPANY_004] monitor will 
conduct site closure activities with the investigator or site staff, as appropriate, in 
accordance with applicable regulations including GCP, and [COMPANY_004] Standard Operating 
Procedures.
[COMPANY_004] reserves the right to temporaril y suspend or prematurel y discontinue this study  
at any time for reasons including, but not limited to, safet y or ethical issues or severe 
non-compliance. For multicenter studies, this can occur at one or more or at all sites.  
If [COMPANY_004] determines such action is needed, [COMPANY_004] will discuss the reasons for taking 
such action with t he investigator or the head of the medical institution (where 
applicable).  When feasible, [COMPANY_004] will provide advance notification to the 
investigator or the head of the medical institution, where applicable, of the 
impending action.
If the stud y is suspende d or prematurely  discontinued for safet y reasons, [COMPANY_004] will 
promptly  inform all investigators, heads of the medical institutions (where 
applicable) and/or institution(s) conducting the study . [COMPANY_004] will also promptly  
inform the relevant regulatory  authorities of the suspension or premature 
discontinuation of the study  and the reason(s) for the action.  
If required b y applicable regulations, the investigator or the head of the medical 
institution (where applicable) must inform the I RB/I EC promptl y and provide the 
reason for the suspensio n or premature discontinuation.
10.6. Records Retention
Following closure of the study, the investigator or the head of the medical institution 
(where applicable) must maintain all site study  records (except for those required by  
[CONTACT_1206]), in a safe and secure location.  
The records must be maintained to allow eas y and timely  retrieval, when needed 
(e.g., for a [COMPANY_004] audit or regulatory  inspection) and must be available for review in 
conjunction with assessment of the facility , supporting s ystems, and relevant site 
staff.  
Where permitted b y local laws/regulations or institutional policy, some or all of these 
records can be maintained in a format other than hard cop y (e.g., microfiche, 
scanned, elect ronic); however, caution needs to be exercised before such action is 
taken.  
The investigator must ensure that all reproductions are legible and are a true and 
accurate cop y of the original and meet accessibility and retrieval standards, including 
re-gene rating a hard copy , if required.  Furthermore, the investigator must ensure 
there is an acceptable back- up of these reproductions and that an acceptable quality  
control process exists for making these reproductions.
[COMPANY_004] will inform the investigator of the time period for retaining these records to 
comply  with all applicable regulatory  requirements.  The minimum retention time 
will meet the strictest standard applicable to that site for the study, as dictated by [CONTACT_1629] y  2017N314087_00

and/or institutional requirements.  
The investigator must notify  [COMPANY_004] of any  changes in the archival arrangements, 
including, but not limited to, archival at an off- site facility  or transfer of ownership 
of the reco rds in the event the investigator is no l onger associated with the site.
10.7. Provision of Study  Results to Investigators, Posting of 
Information on Publically  Available Clinical Trials Registers 
and Publication
Where required b y applicable regulatory  requireme nts, an investigator signatory  will be 
identified for the approval of the clinical study  report.  The investigator will be provided 
reasonable access to statistical tables, figures, and relevant reports and will have the 
opportunity  to review the complete study  results at a [COMPANY_004] site or other mutually -
agreeable location.
[COMPANY_004] will also provide the investigator with the full summary  of the stud y results.  The 
investigator is encouraged to share the summary  results with the study  subjects, as 
appropriate.
The p rocedures and timing for public disclosure of the results summary  and for 
development of a manuscript for publication will be in accordance with [COMPANY_004] Policy .
One or more manuscripts will be progressed for publication in the scientific literature. 2017N314087_00

[PHONE_15167].3. Appendix 3: Definit ion of and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -Up and Reporting of A dverse Events
12.3.1. Definition of A dverse Events
Adverse Event Definition:
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject, temporall y associate d with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product.
NOTE: An AE can therefore be an yunfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) tempora lly 
associated with the use of a medicinal product.
Events meeting AE definition include:
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) 
or other safet y assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs 
measu rements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically  
significant in the medical and scientific judgement of the investigator.
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequen cy and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even 
though it may  have been present prior to the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -
harming intent. This should be reported regardless of sequelae).
"Lack of efficacy " or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE.  However, the signs and sy mptoms and/or clinical 
sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy  will be reported if they  fulfil the definition 
of an AE or SAE.
Events NOT meeting definition of an AE include:
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal safet y 
assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by  [CONTACT_99479]’s condition.
The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of  2017N314087_00
2014N216964_05 CONFIDENTIA L
200363
80the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the sub ject’s 
condition.
Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE.
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
Anticipa ted day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
12.3.2. Definition of Serious A dverse Events
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if s erious 
conditions are met (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/sy mptoms of the disease under study , 
death due to progression of disease, etc).
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, 
at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life-threatening
NOTE:
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  I t does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically  might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23916]:
In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually  
involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_730035]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s 
office or out -patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23918].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], 
the eve nt is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was 
necessary , the AE should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE.
d.Results in disability/incapacity
NOTE:
The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct 
normal life functions.
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical  2017N314087_00

and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may  interfere or prevent every day 
life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f.Other situations:
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_730036].  These should also be considered 
serious.
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency  
or drug abuse
g. Is associated with liver injury andimpaired liver function defined as:
ALT 3xULN and total bilirubin*2xUL N (>35% direct), or
ALT 3xULN and INR**> 1.5.
* Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available; if unavailable, 
measure urinary  bilirubin via dipstick.  I f fractionation is unavailable and ALT 3xULN 
and total bilirubin  2xULN, then the event is still to be reported as an SAE.
** INR testing not required per protocol and the threshold value does not apply  to 
subjects receiving anticoagulants.  If INR measurement is obtained, the value is to be 
recorde d on the SAE form.
12.3.3. Definition of Cardiovascular Events
Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition:
Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the CRF for the 
following AEs and SAEs:
Myocardial infarction/unstable angina
Congestive heart failure
Arrh ythmias
Valvulopathy
Pulmonary  hypertension
Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack
Peripheral arterial thromboembolism 2017N314087_00
2014N216964_05 CONFIDENTIA L
200363
82Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary  embolism
Revascularization
12.3.4. Recording of A Es and SA Es
AEs and S AE Recording:
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostics reports) 
relative to the event.
The investigator will then record all relevant inform ation regarding an AE/SAE in 
the CRF
It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical 
records to [COMPANY_004] in lieu of completion of the [COMPANY_004], AE/SAE CRF page.
There may  be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_19952] b y [COMPANY_004].  In this instance, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the 
subject number, will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_131976].
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis will be 
documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/sy mptoms.
The use of a single question from a multidimensional health survey  to designate a 
cause-effect relationship to an AE is inappropriate.
12.3.5. Evaluating AEs and SA Es
Assessment of Intensity
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the stud y and will assign it to one of the following categories:
Mild:  An event that is easily  tolerated by  [CONTACT_423], causing minimal discomfort 
and not interfering with every day activities.
Moderate:  An event that is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with normal 
every day activities
Severe:  An event that pr events normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe will not be confused with an SAE. Severit y is a category utilized for rating the 
intensity  of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.
An event is defined as ‘serious’ wh en it meets at least one of the pre- defined 
outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE. 2017N314087_00
2014N216964_05 CONFIDENTIA L
200363
83Assessment of Causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and 
the occurrence of each AE/SAE.
A "reasonable poss ibility " is meant to convey that there are facts/evidence or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled 
out.
The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
Alternative causes, such as natural history  of the underly ing diseases, concomitant 
therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study  
treatment will be considered and investigated.
The investigator will also consult the Investigator Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality .
There may  be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_004].  However, it is very important 
that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event 
prior to the initial transm ission of the SAE data to [COMPANY_004].
The investigator may  change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_19954] -up 
information, amending the SAE data collection tool accordingl y.
The causality  assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory  
reporting requirements.
Follow -up of A Es and SA Es
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as may  be indicated or as requested by  [CONTACT_90648]/or causality  of the AE or SAE.
The investigator is obligated to assist.  This may  include additional laboratory  tests 
or investigations, histopathological examinations or consultation with other health 
care professionals.
If a subject dies during participation in the study  or during a recognized follow -up 
period, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_004] with a copy  of any  post -mortem findings, 
including histopathology .
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally  completed CRF.
The investigato r will submit any  updated SAE data to [COMPANY_004] within the designated 
reporting time frames. 2017N314087_00

[PHONE_15168].3.6. Reporting of SA Es to [COMPANY_004]
AE reporting to [COMPANY_004] via electronic data collection tool
Primary  mechanism for reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_004] will be the electronic data collection 
tool
If the electronic s ystem is unavailable, the site will use the paper SAE data collection 
tool and fax it to the SAE coordinator within 24 hours.
Site will enter the serious adverse event data into the electronic s ystem as soon as it 
becomes available.
After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool (e.g., 
InForm s ystem) will be taken off- line to prevent the entry  of new data or changes to 
existing data
If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study  subject or rece ives updated data 
on a previousl y reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken 
off-line, the site can report this information on a paper SAE form or to the SAE 
coordinator b y telephone.
Contacts for SAE receipt can be found at the beginning of this protocol on the 
Sponsor/Medical Monitor Contact [CONTACT_23774]. 2017N314087_00

Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to [COMPANY_004] within [ADDRESS_997145]'s pregnancy .
Subject will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . The 
investigator will collect follow up information on m other and infant, which will be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_004].  Generall y, follow-up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 
weeks bey ond the estimated delivery  date. 
Any termination of pregnancy  will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure.
While pregnancy  itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any  pregnancy  
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or 
SAE.
A spontaneous abortion is alway s considered to be an S AE and will be reported as 
such.  
Any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study  pregnancy ,which is considered 
reasonabl y related to the study  treatment by  [CONTACT_093], will be reported to [COMPANY_004]

To be eligible for entry  into the study , females of childbearing potential must commit to 
consistent and correct use of an acceptable method of birth control from the time of 
consent, for the duration of the trial, and for [ADDRESS_997148] stud y drug 
administration.
Abstinence from penile -vaginal intercourse
Male partner who is sterile prior to the female sub ject’s entry  into the study 
and is the sole sexual partner for that female subject 
Implants of levonorgestrel  or etonogestrel 
Injectable progestogen
Oral contraceptive (either combined or progestogen alone)
Estrogenic vaginal ring
Percutaneous contracep tive patches
Any intrauterine device (IUD) with a documented failure rate of less than 1%

Male condom combined with a vaginal spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream, or 
suppository )
Male condom combined with a female diaphragm, either with or without a 
vaginal spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository )
Females of childbearing potential are defined as females with functioning ovaries (i.e., 
post-menarche, premenopausal women with no documented impairment of oviductal or 
uterine function that w ould cause sterility ). This category  includes females with 
oligomenorrhea, females who are peri -menopausal, and y oung females who have begun 
to menstruate (adolescents).  The information on the lack of impairment of oviductal or 
uterine function that would cause sterility , can come from the site personnel’s:
Review of subject’s medical records
Medical examination of the subject
Interview with the subject on her medical history .
Menarche is the onset of menses for the first time in a young female and is prec eded by  
[CONTACT_730062]. Menarche usually occurs within [ADDRESS_997149] 
development (palpable glandular breast tissue).  
Based on the absence of an identified reproducti ve hazard from preclinical studies, 
absence of a genotoxic potential, and very  low levels of mepolizumab that might be 
present in semen, there is no recognized risk for mepolizumab to affect human sperm or  2017N314087_00

(Table 3).  The ACQ -7 is a simple questionnaire t o measure the adequacy  of asthma 
control and change in asthma control which occurs either spontaneousl y or as a result 
of treatment ( Appendix 5 ).  The questionnaire includes 7 items; and requires a 1 week 
recall (for items on s ymptoms and rescue inhaler use).  The ACQ has a 
multidimensional construct assessing s ymptoms (5 items administered by  [CONTACT_730064]) and rescue bronchodilator use (query  to child or parent), and FEV1% (1 
item) completed b y clinic staff.  The ACQ -7 uses a 7- point scale (0= no impairment,

Section 4.4, Design Justification
Additional text:
No long- term data (up to 52 weeks) documenting the safet y and tolerability  of 
mepolizumab in children aged 6 to 11 years with s evere eosinophilic asthma are currently  
available.  As it is expected that treatment with mepolizumab in this population may  be 
long-term it is essential that such data be collected.  Extended treatment with 
mepolizumab during Part B of this protocol also permits an assessment of the durability  
of the pharmacod ynamic response to mepolizumab in this population. 2017N314087_00

153Section 9.2 Sample Size Considerations:
Original Text:
The sample size was determined by  [CONTACT_730069]/PD studies. A pediatric population -PK trial simulation 
([COMPANY_004] Document Number 2014N223495_00) was used to determine the Root Mean 
Square Error (RMSE, i.e. standard deviation) in estimated exposure (AUC (0-inf)) as a 
function of sample size, pharmacokinetic sampling scheme and model assumptions. 
Based on 1000 trial simulations per scenario, a sample size of 16 -32 subjects is sufficient 
to maintain precision in exposure estimation (and hence bod yweight -adjusted clearance) 
below 20%, (as compared with the  guideline 40%), providing five pharmacokinetic 
samples (including one close to Tmax) are collected and four parameters are fixed from 
adult values in the pop ulation -PK model.

Section 4.4, Design Justification:
Original Text:
A treatment phase duration of 12 weeks is considered sufficient to support the primary  
PK and PD endpoint of the study . A dose ranging PK/PD study  (MEA114092) of 
mepolizumab administered intravenousl y (75 mg) or subcutaneousl y (12.5, 125 and 250  2017N314087_00

162mg) with a similar duration was conducted in adult asthmatic subjects with elevated 
blood eosinophil levels. Concordance in the blood eosinophil reduction at 75 mg IV 
between this study  and the 12 -month duration phase 2/3 study  (Pavord, 2012) confirms 
suitability  of the 12 weeks duration treatment for the chosen endpoint. Furthermore, 
comparab le blood eosinophil count reduction was observed at 75 mg IV and 100 mg SC 
in a phase 3 study (MEA115588) with consistent blood eosinophil reduction observed 
from 12 weeks onwards. These data support conducting a stud y of 12 weeks duration  
and will allow comparison with adult/adolescent data to support the extrapolation of the 
safet y and efficacy data observed in adults/adolescents in the severe asthma phase [ADDRESS_997243] dose, which is consistent with the follow- up duration in adult studies.

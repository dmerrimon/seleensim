Version 9:July 12, 2021  Page 3 of 31 Introduction. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by [CONTACT_578433].1,2 In COPD, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based pulmonary rehabilitation can improve symptoms, functional status, and quality of life.3-5 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based rehabilitation can also decrease unscheduled physician visits, emergency room visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602],6 and possibly, mortality.7 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_578392], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based pulmonary rehab remains largely underused8,9 for various reasons: lack of access to programs, need for qualified health care professionals and equipment that demand significant costs, and limited reimbursement.8,10 Up to 50% of eligible patients cannot participate because of transportation difficulties.[ADDRESS_760086] that rhythmically enhanced music may constitute such an innovative strategy. Music can elicit a positive emotional reaction that lessens the fear21 and intensity of unpleasant symptoms such as dyspnea and exercise-induced fatigue.22,23 These data raise the possibility that diminishing the fear of dyspnea and fatigue may allow patients to tolerate more challenging physical activity and obtain a greater benefit from rehabilitation. Music also can induce entrainment of motor responses such as walking24 (cuing gait to music).25 Sensorimotor coupling can be optimized by [CONTACT_578434], known as rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS)26 in an instrumental track27 (Fig. 1). Using RAS-enhanced music, we have been able to lengthen the distance walked by [CONTACT_578435] (PAD).[ADDRESS_760087], “Increasing Physical Activity in Patients Recovering from Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53763]-19 Through a Home-based, Exercise Program Utilizing Rhythmically Enhanced Music”.  This study was not funded as a separate project but VA Merit Review suggested and funded an ‘Administrative Project Modification’ to this parent COPD study in which we will include patients recovering from prolonged COVID19 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Specifically, we will use our novel RAS-enhanced music exercise program developed for the parent grant in patients recovering from COVID19.  The main goal of the modified proposal for COVID19 patients is to compare the efficacy of a 12-week, home-based exercise program augmented by [CONTACT_422885]-therapeutic music and strength training to 12-weeks usual care and strength training in patients recovering from COVID 19.    Due to the overwhelming burden on the healthcare system and high transmissibility of the virus, patients who may have typi[INVESTIGATOR_578393] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_578394]. These patients are suffering from longterm adverse consequences of COVID-19 and would greatly benefit from a rehabilitative intervention. Therefore, we are broadening our inclusion criteria to include any patient who visited the ED for COVID or was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_578395] (both typi[INVESTIGATOR_578396]).

COVID Patients Objective 1. To determine the efficacy of a 12-week, home-based, patient-tailored, RAS-enhanced music exercise program and strength training in improving functional and clinical parameters in patients recovering from COVID19with a history of an emergency room and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].. Hypotheses: Compared to patients randomized to a home-based, exercise program without music (control group), patients randomized to a home-based, exercise program augmented with RAS-therapeutic enhanced music (experimental group; hereafter referred to as RAST-music group) will demonstrate greater: 1a- increase in 6-minute walking distance (primary hypothesis); 1b- greater increases in rectus femoris dimensions (ultrasound) 1c- greater quadriceps force and endurance (magnetic femoral nerve stimulation; isokinetic strength testing) 1d- increased sense of emotional investment related to the music experience Objective 2.

Hypothesis: The RAST-music group will maintain improvements in measured and perceived function at 24 weeks to a greater extent than the control group. (same as COPD) Objective 4. To assess impact of physiological and psychological phenotype and clinical factors including those related to music preference and history on responsiveness to rehabilitation achieved with and without concurrent use of RAST music programs (Exploratory objective). Specific physiological, psychological and clinical factors will include, quadriceps function and dimension after rehabilitation,  self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, time of mechanical ventilation, music preference and history , and adherence to the program.  A.2. Impact: Using RAS-enhanced music to cue walking cadence and decrease exercise-induced dyspnea/fatigue has the potential to transform home-based pulmonary rehab. Altering the beat and tempo of music provides stimuli to speed or slow walking cadences that are imperceptible to the patient. If successful, RAS/RAST-guided exercise programs will have far reaching implications not only for COPD and COVID 19, but for rehab in other chronic diseases including interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, cardiomyopathies and peripheral arterial disease.19,[ADDRESS_760089] of these factors on exercise capacity in COPD. A.3.1.1  Exercise Limitation in COPD: Dynamic Hyperinflation and Respi[INVESTIGATOR_578397]. During whole body exercise, most patients with COPD experience an increase in end-expi[INVESTIGATOR_13962] (EELV).4,30,31 This increase results from expi[INVESTIGATOR_94806]32 and tachypnea.31 The result is a progressive increase in end-inspi[INVESTIGATOR_578398] (IRV).30,[ADDRESS_760090] demonstrated,33 critical decreases in IRV elicit unsustainable dyspnea, and patients stop exercising. Unsustainable dyspnea occurs because the critical decrease in IRV is accompanied by [CONTACT_578437][INVESTIGATOR_578399].29

Version 9:July 12, 2021  Page 6 of 31 A.3.1.2.   Exercise Limitation in COPD: Limb Muscles. Reduced muscle mass (sarcopenia) is a major systemic manifestation of COPD, and is present in up to one-third of patients.32,34 Sarcopenia is associated with muscle weakness,35 decreased exercise tolerance,36 worse quality of life36 and decreased survival.34 Lower extremity sarcopenia is independent of body mass index (BMI),[ADDRESS_760091] assessment of muscle dimensions through imaging techniques such as ultrasonography, as now planned.38,39 Additional factors contributing to decreased exercise tolerance include decrease in fatigue-resistant type 1 muscle fibers, increase in type 2 fatigue-sensitive fibers, decrease in oxidative enzymes and increase in glycolytic enzymes (quadriceps).[ADDRESS_760092] baseline and follow-up data  on rectus femoris size (ultrasound) reasoning that these data will shed light into the impact of muscle size and function on the response to our rehabilitation program. These data will be used also to explore whether there are specific subgroups of patients who – in addition to RAS/RAST-enhanced exercise-training – could benefit from specific ancillary interventions (see sections C.4. Alternative Outcomes and C6. Future Directions).41 A.3.2. Exercise-training. Exercise-training is a critical intervention in the pulmonary rehab of patients with COPD42 that can produce positive clinical outcomes.3,4,6,7,9,43 A.3.2.1 Exercise-Training: Impact of Locomotor Muscle Response. To obtain physiological training adaptations in a skeletal muscle, the level of load during training must be sufficient to stress the muscle and cause contractile fatigue (muscle overload).44,45 In a study by [CONTACT_578439],44 29 of 46 patients with COPD developed quadriceps fatigue during a scheduled rehab visit; after 3 months of training, fatiguers achieved greater training in terms of exercise capacity and health-related quality of life than non-fatiguers. Similar results were reported by [CONTACT_578440].45 In the investigations of Burtin et al44 and Mador et al,45 quadriceps fatigue was objectively quantified by [CONTACT_578441] (quadriceps twitch or Quad-Tw)(Fig. 2). We have extensively used this state-of-the-art technique to evaluate strength and fatigue in healthy volunteers, patients with COPD and mechanically ventilated patients.[ADDRESS_760093] data on quadriceps fatigability at the end of training (Quad-Tw). Specifically, we will determine whether randomization into RAS-music will increase the likelihood of quadriceps fatigue and whether quadriceps fatigue contributes to the beneficial effects of the home-based, RAS-music exercise program. These data will be used also to explore whether there are specific subgroups of patients who – in addition to RAS-enhanced exercise-training – could benefit from specific ancillary interventions (see sections C.4. Alternative Outcomes and C6. Future Directions).41 A.3.2.2. Exercise-Training: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-Based vs. Home-Based Programs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based pulmonary rehabilitation can produce favorable structural adaptations in the locomotor muscles and improve the clinical status of patients with COPD.3,4,6,9 Unfortunately, less than 5% of patients who would benefit from rehab are enrolled in such a program.46,[ADDRESS_760094] to report that unsupervised exercise at home (stair climbing), could reduce dyspnea and improve exercise capacity in [ADDRESS_760095] methodological limitations that hamper the generalizability of the results. In Puente-Maestu et al,16 Wedzicha et al12 and Hernandez et al.13 patients received no external encouragement during exercise. Strijbos et al15 and Wedzicha et al12 utilized physiotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_578400]-exercise training – a prohibitive resource-intensive strategy for most health care systems. As for the study of Hernandez et al,13 the training prescription was nebulous and sample size small (20 patients in intervention group and 17 in control group completed the study). This factor raises the spectrum of Type II error. All these limitations will be overcome in the current investigation. In a departure from previous strategies, Liu et al11 developed a home-based program where 24 patients

Version 9:July 12, 2021  Page 7 of 31 with COPD were instructed to walk keepi[INVESTIGATOR_578401] a cell phone. Tempo was adjusted to coincide with the necessary walking speed for the patients’ exercise training (i.e., 80% of the patient’s maximal capacity). To keep the exercise target at 80% of maximal capacity the music’s tempo was readjusted every four weeks during the first three months of the study (exercise training period). In the following 9 months no additional adjustments were made yet, patients were encouraged to continue exercising (self-management period). A second group of [ADDRESS_760096] (both distance and duration) and quality of life while experiencing fewer acute exacerbations and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_578402]. As recognized by [CONTACT_578442], this small pi[INVESTIGATOR_578403].11 In addition, patients had no choice in selecting the music used during exercise and over the course of the trial – i.e., music never changed. That is, contrary to what we propose in our current study (see below), Liu et al11 did not take full advantage of the capacity of music to decrease dyspnea and leg fatigue and to induce entrainment of gait. A.3.3.  Music and Exercise. Music can improve affect,21 lessen unpleasant symptoms such as fatigue51 and dyspnea,22,23 and it can modulate the perceptions and ergonomics associated with physical activity.20 A.3.3.1.  Music and Exercise: Dyspnea & Exercise-Associated Fatigue. In healthy volunteers, listening to preferred music triggers endogenous dopamine release in the caudate nucleus and the nucleus accumbens.[ADDRESS_760097] nucleus, part of the dorsal striatum, is involved in the anticipatory phase of a rewarding experience.53 The second nucleus, part of the ventral striatum, is involved in the consummatory phase of a rewarding experience. This consummatory phase is driven by [CONTACT_578443][INVESTIGATOR_578404].53 This striatal coativation creates a sense of pleasure and reduces pain.54 In healthy volunteers exposed to noxious thermal stimuli, music personally selected has greater analgesic effects than no-music conditions.55 Music-associated reduction of pain has also been reported in patients requiring physical therapy following trauma56 or orthopedic surgery.57 Music-associated release of dopamine in the striatum can also enhance mood54 and produce a sense of empowerment.23 In patients with cancer, music interventions reduce anxiety, depression and fatigue.51 Again, these effects are more pronounced when the patient’s music preference is taken into account.51 The complex effects of music on the striatum are likely responsible for the reduction of ex ercised-induced dyspnea and leg fatigue in COPD (see preliminary results).21-23,58 These observations raise the possibility that deconditioning patients with COPD from the unpleasant sensations of exercise-induced dyspnea and leg fatigue with self-selected music could allow them to tolerate more challenging physical activity and, thus, obtain a greater benefit from pulmonary rehab.This possibility will be tested in the experiments describe in the current proposal. A.3.3.2  Music and Exercise: Entrainment of Gait. The ability of music to evoke a physical response is a human universal phenomenon occurring from young children to elderly patients with Alzheimer’s disease.[ADDRESS_760098] of motor–behavioral responses such as walking, cycling, eating, and drinking can be influenced by [CONTACT_89863].27 For example, a change in the tempo of background music in a supermarket from 70 bpm to 130 bpm can increase the pace of shopper traffic.27 The effects of music are often implicit (individuals are not aware of being influenced by [CONTACT_89863]).59 The motor-behavioral responses to music likely result from the interaction of two mechanism: enhanced arousal and entrainment.27 That is, music enhances arousal with resultant priming of motor behaviors while concurrently inducing an automatic synchronization between internal bodily “oscillators” and external rhythms.27 These internal bodily “oscillators” result from the natural periodicity of neuronal activity.27 Converging neurophysiological evidence suggests that brain regions underpi[INVESTIGATOR_578405], including the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and supplementary motor areas, are also deployed during rhythm perception -- neural response to auditory rhythm denotes a preparation for movement.27,59 Auditory stimuli can also modulate movement by [CONTACT_578444] “central pattern

Version 9:July 12, 2021  Page 8 of 31 generators” in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. This redundancy in neural pathways explains why period shifts in music that are not consciously perceived as such can still induce entrainment of motor responses, such as finger tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], in patients with cerebellar lesions.59 Entrainment of motor responses to music can be optimized by [CONTACT_578445] (also known as rhythmic auditory stimulation or RAS) in an instrumental track (Fig 1).20,26 For example, in Parkinson’s disease RAS-enhanced music leads to significant improvements in gait velocity and stride length. Similar results have also been reported in patients with stroke and traumatic brain injury59 and, relevant to the current proposal, in patients with COPD58 (please see our preliminary data, Section B.6.1.). The potential benefits of personalized RAS-enhanced music in optimizing entrainment of motor responses to music has been explored in the small feasibility study by [CONTACT_578446].[ADDRESS_760099] time and with sufficent power, that our novel home-based, patient-tailored, RAS-enhanced music exercise program will produce greater improvements in functional and clinical parameters and it will ensure greater volumes of physical activity than a home-based program with no music. These exciting possibilities will be investigated in Objective #1 and Objective #2 of the proposed study. A.3.3.3.   Music and Exercise: Maintenance of Pulmonary Rehabilitation Gains. Maintaining exercise benefits following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based pulmonary rehab programs is challenging.60,[ADDRESS_760100] to the previous studies, Strijbos et al15 were successful in maintaining (and indeed improving) pulmonary rehab gains following 12 weeks of home-care rehabilitation. The investigators speculate that patients had become accustomed to exercise in their own domiciliary environment. This made it easier for them to continue exercising at home after the initial 12-weeks of training were over. A similar result was recently reported in the small proof-of-principle study of Ho et al.58 The observations of Strijbos et al15 and Ho et al.58 combined with our success in increasing exercise performance with RAS-enhanced music (see preliminary results, Section B.6.1.) lay the scientific foundation of the proposed experiments in our Objective #3. Specifically, these observations raise the possibility that combining RAS-music and home-based exercise training will result in greater long-term maintenance of rehabilitation gains than exercise-training alone. A.3.4.  Potential Confounders. Potential confounders to any pulmonary rehabilitation study include the patients’ physiological and psychological phenotype and clinical factors. A.3.4.1.  Potential Confounders: Physiological Phenotype. Decreased exercise tolerance with attendant difficulty in achieving sufficient intensity of exercise during training hinders the effectiveness of rehab. 63 In addition to severity of lung disease, independent predictors of decrease exercise tolerance include quadriceps dimension, recruitment and strength, systemic inflammation (hsCRP and IL-6)64 (see work accomplished). A.3.4.2.  Potential Confounders: Psychological Phenotype. Depression,49,60,65 anxiety49,60,65 and overall sense of fatigue62,66 can limit the effectiveness of pulmonary rehab as these factors may cause insufficient adherence to rehabilitation programs. A.3.4.3  Potential Confounders: Clinical Factors. Approximately 15% of patients drop out from pulmonary rehab due to clinical factors such as COPD exacerbations,67 cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents), or cancer.68 Because of this, in the proposed investigation, we will assess the influence of the physiological and psychological phenotype and clinical factors on the effectives of RAS- enhanced and non RAS-enhanced home-based

Version 9:July 12, 2021  Page 9 of 31 rehabilitation (Objective #4). A.4.  Significance and Relevance to the VA.  COPD is the third leading cause of death in the US69and the sixth most common chronic condition among Veterans.70 Already in 2004, the Veterans Healthcare Administration spent annually an estimated $5.[ADDRESS_760101] no access to pulmonary rehabilitation. A.5. Innovation: Exercise training combined with RAS-enhanced music is an innovative rehab program that capi[INVESTIGATOR_578406]-enhanced music26. Augmentation of home-based pulmonary rehab with RAS-enhanced music creates a more affordable and motivational program compared to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based rehabilitation. In our proposal, we use will use rigorous techniques to study the biophysical impact of this rehab strategy on clinical outcomes (Objectives #1), volume of exercise accumulated during rehab (Objective #2) and the potential mechanisms underpi[INVESTIGATOR_578407] (Objective #4). In addition, we will use a careful phenotypic characterization of patients to probe the effect of RAS-enhanced rehab on maintenance of physical activity once the 12 weeks of formal exercise training are over (Objective #3). Through this proposed work we expect to demonstrate, for the first time and with sufficient power, that, compared to home-based training without RAS-enhancement, our novel home-based, RAS-enhanced program will produce greater improvements in functional and clinical parameters. We also expect that this program will ensure greater volumes of physical activity in the weeks that follow formal exercise training. The latter is increasingly recognized as critical to maintain benefits of rehab and to reduce morbidity and, possibly, mortality in COPD.7 Research such as the one proposed here is vital to advance home-based rehabilitation in veterans with COPD. B.  Background and Work Accomplished: [CONTACT_578464] and [CONTACT_211239] successfully concluded studies on respi[INVESTIGATOR_578408],75,[ADDRESS_760102] to perform a head-to-head detailed investigation of the physiologic responses to exercise in patients with severe COPD who received helium -oxygen mixtures or pressure-support ventilation.30 Based on their visual ventilation-feedback work, they developed and tested an acoustic ventilation-feedback system to modulate the respi[INVESTIGATOR_578409]. Finally, they conducted investigations on quality of life in COPD – including studies on the impact of gonadal state on respi[INVESTIGATOR_13945], exercise capacity, depression, sexual function and survival.80,81,[ADDRESS_760103] extensive experience with the techniques which will be

Ventilation-Feedback Training and Exercise for Patients with COPD (F2302-R). The primary objective of this study was to determine whether limiting exercise-induced dynamic hyperinflation during 12 weeks of exercise training plus ventilation-feedback training (i.e., breathing-retraining) would prolong the duration of constant-load treadmill test more than 12-weeks of exercise-training alone or breathing-retraining alone. After training, duration of the constant-load treadmill test was longer with breathing-retraining plus exercise (40±20 min) than with breathing-retraining alone (16±19 min; P<.0001) and tended to be longer with breathing-retraining plus exercise than exercise alone (32±17 min; P=.022).4 B.2.  Innovative Methods for Pulmonary Rehabilitation (F3845-R). The primary objective of this study was to determine whether reducing exercise-induced dynamic hyperinflation during 12 weeks of exercise training with either breathing-retraining or with helium-oxygen (heliox) would prolong the duration of constant-load treadmill test more than 12-weeks of exercise-training alone.[ADDRESS_760104] increased by 11±13 min with exercise plus breathing-retraining, 8±10 min with exercise plus heliox, and 5±[ADDRESS_760105] notable in patients with hyperinflation; those randomized to breathing-retraining showed greater gains in exercise when compared to exercise alone (12.3±13.3 vs. 4.6±7.7 min, P=.01).

Overall adherence to the study has been excellent (88% at one year). Analysis and data collection are ongoing as not all patients have completed the follow-up period. B.5.  Is Systemic Inflammation a Mechanism of Functional Impairment in COPD? (VA Resp-011-06F). This investigation was designed to test the hypothesis that in patients with COPD, greater functional impairment is associated with higher levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines and greater oxidative stress.

Version 9:July 12, 2021  Page 11 of 31             Two unique experimental modalities used in the VA Resp- 011-06F study that are relevant to the current proposal are: (a) assessment of quadriceps fatigue and (b) assessment of quadriceps muscle dimensions. We will separately describe preliminary results pertaining to these two modalities. a- Quadriceps fatigue: To determine whether patients developed quadriceps fatigue after exercise, maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) and quadriceps twitch force elicited by [CONTACT_578447] (Quad-Tw) were recorded in 63 patients before and after constant-load cycle ergometry. Fatigue (decrease in Quad-Tw > 15% of baseline values, Fig. 2)43 occurred in 67% of patients. Independent predictors of exercise-induced quadriceps fatigue were: less quadriceps recruitment, smaller pre-exercise Quad-Tw, greater inflammation (hsCRP, IL-6), and greater workrate (p≤.05).92 b- Quadriceps dimensions: In the same 63 patients, the cross-sectional area of the rectus femoris using ultrasonography39 was identified as an independent predictor of exercise capacity (VO2 max and Watts max). B.6.1. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_578411]-COPD: We enrolled 13 patients with COPD (age=71±57 yr, FEV1=49±16% predicted). To assess whether RAS-music increases the distance walked during a fixed time, we measured the distance walked during three 6-minute walk tests (6MWTs) (no-music, music-as-recorded, or RAS- enhanced music) administered in random order. To minimize undue fatigue, patients rested for 30-minutes between tests. Patients were told that they would complete one walk without music and two walks while listening to self-selected music played in a continuous loop to last six minutes. During the unenhanced music walk, music was played at a tempo that matched the patient’s usual cadence (steps/minute). During the RAS-enhanced walk, the music’s bass was enhanced to emphasize the rhythm and the music’s tempo was increased to approximately 5-10 beats/min higher than the patient’s usual walking cadence. To eliminate extraneous noise, patients wore Bose® noise canceling head phones during each test. No adverse events or complications occurred. All patients successfully completed the three 6MWTs, and no patient commented that the music sounded different. Total distance walked was greater in the RAS-music walk when compared to no music (p=.038) and music without enhancement (p=.016) (Tab.1). As reported by [CONTACT_127761],93 there was no difference in distance walked when the no-music walk was compared to the walk with unenhanced music. Distance walked when patients reported  Table. 1 Mean differences in walking distance based on music condition (mean ± SD)  No music Music without enhancement RAS Music Total distance walked (m)  Onset of dyspnea distance (m) 461±58  373±105 452±48  378±102 470±53  390±132    onset dyspnea was 372±05 m without music and 390±123 m with RAS-enhanced music.

We learned some important lessons from our experience from the PAD-pi[INVESTIGATOR_578413]: (1) Several patients did not have readily available Wi-Fi. The resultant inability to sync the Fitbit resulted in loss of data. In the proposed COPD study, we will instruct patients with no Wi-Fi to come to our Lab to sync the Fitbit and/or we will assist them in finding local hotspots to sync. (2) We will carefully track Fitbit data and call patients if Fitbit is data are missing (see C.1.7.). (3) Helpful family members “assisted” the patients by [CONTACT_578448]’ steps. Accordingly, we developed detailed instructions for the Fitbit. (4) Patients requested more songs and playlists than we originally provided. (5) A community advisory board advised us that patients with smartphones would prefer that the music be placed on smartphone so they would only have one device. After we changed our PAD pi[INVESTIGATOR_578414], patients have been satisfied with the selection and amount of music they were given, we have been able to track Fitbit steps and we have not had issues with families resetting accounts. One patient in the PAD- pi[INVESTIGATOR_578415]. Conclusion: The data presented in section D. Background and Work Accomplished indicate that: (a) The PIs have extensive experience with the methods to be used in the proposal; (b) The unambiguous feasibility and biological plausibility of the proposed study; and (c) The opportunity that the proposed experiments will provide unparalleled insights into home-based pulmonary rehab, sustainability of the gains achieved with pulmonary rehab and potential mechanisms that can affect such sustainability.

Version 9:July 12, [ADDRESS_760108] of this integrated synergism will be to promote greater functional gains (primary hypothesis) at the end of 12 weeks of home- based exercise training and to promote better maintenance of the benefits of pulmonary rehab at 24 weeks than in the no-music group (secondary hypothesis). C.1.2.  General Overview of Design. The proposed study has been designed as a randomized, controlled clinical trial in which COPD patients will be randomized into an exercise program with RAS-enhanced music (RAS- music group) or in an exercise program without music (no-music group). COVID [ADDRESS_760109]-enhanced music (RAST- music group and strength training) or in an exercise program without music (no-music but will have strength training  group).Patients will complete testing procedures at pre-randomization, at [ADDRESS_760110] 6MWT over 12 weeks between groups (see C.1.9.1.a.). We estimate that the COPD target sample size of 68 patients per group completing 12 weeks will ensure 80% power to detect the differences between treatment arms using a two-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming a correlation of 0.[ADDRESS_760111] deviations at baseline and at 6 weeks between groups and over time (232 feet), correlations between measurement of 0.76 to 0.86, and an increase of 87.2 feet at 6 weeks for the RAS- music group, with a slightly higher level for those completing the 12-week assessment.

Version 9:July 12, [ADDRESS_760112] 6MWT at 12 weeks between groups.  We estimate that over a two-year period we will ensure complete data collection on a total of 72 patients (36 per group). This will ensure a 58% power to detect the differences between treatment arms using a two-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming a correlation of 0.[ADDRESS_760113] conservative correlation observed between measurements (r=0.65), and an increase of [ADDRESS_760114] studies,3,4,94 30% of patients who signed the informed consent (i.e., enrollees) did not meet pulmonary function criteria or did not qualify for other reasons.[ADDRESS_760115] an attrition 12 weeks after randomization of about 8%, and an attrition 24 weeks after randomization of 20%. Accordingly, to have complete data in 136 COPD patients as required by [CONTACT_578450] (see above), we plan to ‘enroll’ 243 COPD patients (i.e., signed informed consent) expecting to ‘randomize’ 170 of them, and to lose 34 of this latter group by [CONTACT_5875] 24 (end of the study). We will enroll 100 patients with COVID 19 into this study. C.1.4.  Recruitment. COPD patients will be recruited from the outpatient Pulmonary Medicine Service at the Hines VA (Tab. 2).COVID 19 patients will be recruited from Hines outpatient Medical Services. No patient will be excluded based on gender or ethnicity. About 8 patients per month will be ‘enrolled’ with 5-6 of them being randomized. This will allow us to meet our target sample over 3.5 years ( Tab. 3). Recruitment will be monitored weekly. We are confident we will meet the target number of participants (see also section C.5. Potential Problems) considering we enrolled more than 1000 patients into our various investigations3,4,81,82,96 and that many patients with COPD attend Hines VA (4,803 unique patients with an ICD10-COPD code in FY2016, which is an underestimation of more than 1000 patients as this number does not capture patients in whom the ICD 9-COPD code has not been updated to the ICD 10-COPD code). C.1.5. Screening and Baseline Testing. Proposed study participants will be screened for eligibility and written informed consent will be obtained. All testing will take place at Hines VAH’s Physical Performance Research Laboratory. During screening, patients will be asked about their medical history and medication use. This will be followed by [CONTACT_5292], pulmonary function testing and completion of quality of life/dyspnea questionnaires (Tab. 4). Eligible patients will perform additional baseline tests4 that include a functional assessment of the quadriceps (after the completion of 12 weeks of training), quadriceps ultrasonography, two standard 6MWT (according to ATS recommendations, patients will be instructed to walk as fast as they can without running)97 and two modified 6MWT at their usual/leisurely walk pace (leisurely-paced 6MWT; see section C.1.9.1). Walking cadence during these tests will be used to adjust the RAS exercise prescription (RAS-music group). In addition, data from the standard 6MWT will be used to test the primary hypothesis that exercise training with RAS-music elicits greater increases in standard 6MWT distance than exercise training alone (see sections C.1.6.1. and C.1.9.1). Patients will receive an Actigraph to measure physical activity over the course of one week. After baseline testing is completed (Tab. 4) and study criteria are met, COPD patients will be randomized to exercise training with RAS-enhanced music (RAS-music group) or exercise training without music. COVID [ADDRESS_760116]-enhanced music  and strength training (RAST-music group) or exercise training without music and with strength training.

C.1.6.1 Exercise Prescription:RAS/RAST-music group C.1.6.1.a. Music selection: Immediately after randomization,COPD patients in the RAS-music group will be asked to list 15 songs/music pi[INVESTIGATOR_578417]. If patients need help naming songs/music pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928], we will present them with a catalogue of “Top Twenty” songs/music within several genres . Patients will be also informed that they can choose songs/music not listed in the catalogue.  COVID [ADDRESS_760120]: [CONTACT_578467] V.

The music therapi[INVESTIGATOR_578418]. Loewy to assure that appropriate music therapy interventions are implemented. C.1.6.1.b. Coaching playlist: A “coaching playlist” of 12 songs will be loaded on the patient’s smartphone or iPod. The patient’s self-selected music is required to have a tempo that is within 5% of the patients’ usual walking cadence (see C.1.9.1.b. Leisurely-paced 6MWT) with brief segments of music at a faster tempo (~10 beats/minute over the leisure walking pace). (Music tempo is the speed of the underlying beat. Tempo is measured in beats per minute or BPM.) Patients will be instructed on how to access the playlist, use the headphones and maintain a cadence (steps per minute) that matches the music’s tempo.  C.1.6.1.c. Personalized RAS/RAST-music visit: Patients will return to the lab one week later. During this visit (“personalized RAS/RAST-music visit”), patients will be given a playlist of the music they prefer. Each personalized playlist will include approximately 15 songs for a total of 45-60 minutes of music. The selection of songs will ensure that the music’s tempo to which patients must entrain their walking cadence at home is initially slow (warm-up phase – music tempo within 5% of the walking cadence during leisurely-paced 6MWT), then fast (overload phase – music tempo same as during standard 6MWT) (see section, standard 6MWT, C.1.9.1.a.) and then slow again (recovery phase – music tempo within 5% of the during leisurely-paced 6MWT). The first two phases will last approximately 4 minutes (i.e., two songs each). The last phase will last about 2 minutes (one song). During the personalized RAS/RAST-music visit, patients will complete one or more RAS-enhanced music cycles (i.e., warm-up, overload, and recovery) until the Research Assistant determines that the patient is comfortable with the procedure and successfully entrains his/her walking cadence with the music’s tempo. (During the personalized RAS/RAST-music visit, patient and research staff will concurrently listen to the music so that the research staff may give real-time music-cadence entrainment feedback to the patient). To avoid undue burden to patients with frequent return visits to the lab, the research staff will upload in the patients’ smartphone or iPod four additional playlists each with approximately 15 songs. The music’s tempo in these playlists will match the required increase in walk cadence as patients progress with training -- i.e., as the weeks pass, patients will be instructed by [CONTACT_578453]. During the personalized RAS/RAST-music visit, patients will be instructed on the exercise prescription for the upcoming [ADDRESS_760121] three times weekly. Compatible with perceived dyspnea (modified Borg < 3/10 [moderate dyspnea]),3,23 patients will be encouraged to extend the period of exercise by 5 minutes every 2 weeks (not to exceed 45 minutes)23 (Patients will be notified that the 30-to-45 minutes of three- weekly exercise session can be achieved all in one bout of exercise or in more than one bout of exercise during the exercise day). Patients will also be asked to wear the Fitbit at all times except when showering.

Version 9:July 12, 2021  Page 17 of 31 At the conclusion of the personalized RAS/RAST-music visit, patients will be coached during 30-minutes of walking exercise to ensure that they properly understand how to conduct the RAS-music walking exercise at home and how to gauge dyspnea using the modified Borg scale.

At week 12, patients will return to the lab (same steps as in week 6). The purpose of this 12-week visit is to recalibrate once more the tempo of the RAS-enhanced music so that if the patient is interested in using the RAS-music during the last 12 weeks of the study he/she may do so with an updated prescription of music. At weeks 6, 12 and 24 patients will also fill out questionnaires and complete the 7-day actigraphy. At week 12 and 24, patients will also undergo a quadriceps ultrasound and Quad-Tw testing (week 12 only). During the personalized RAS/RAST-music visit and subsequent visits to the lab, the research staff will also ensure that patients know how to use the Fitbit, will reinforce on how to use RAS-enhanced music to guide the walking cadence and will inform patients that any time during the study they can obtain different songs if they do not like or get bored with the songs provided in their personal playlist. C.1.6.2. Exercise Prescription: No-music group. One week after randomization, patients in the no-music group will return to the lab to receive detailed instructions about the 12-week no-music exercise walking program. Specifically, they will be instructed to exercise at least [ADDRESS_760125] of repeated bouts of walking, which will be slow initially for about two minutes (warm-up phase – leisurely- paced walk), then fast as they can without running for about four minutes (same as standard 6MWT)97 and then slow again for about one minute (recovery phase – leisurely-paced walk). Compatible with perceived dyspnea (modified Borg < 3/10 [moderate dyspnea])3,23 patients will be encouraged to extend the period of exercise by 5 minutes every 2 weeks (not to exceed 45 minutes).23 (Patients will be notified that the 30-to-45 minutes of three- weekly exercise session can be achieved all in one bout of exercise or in more than one bout of exercise during the exercise day). Patients will also be asked to wear the Fitbit at all times except when showering. To conclude the visit, patients will be coached during a 30-minute walking exercise to ensure that they understood how to conduct the no-music walking exercise at home and how to gauge dyspnea using the modified Borg scale. Of importance, the difference in exercise training between the no-music group and the RAS-music group is that the no-music exercise program will not be directed by [CONTACT_422885]/RAST-enhanced music. In addition, patients in the no-music group will be instructed to avoid listening to any music while walking. All other methods, including phone calls at the end of weeks [ADDRESS_760126] 12 weeks of training, will be same for both groups. (Patients will be scheduled so that the RAS-music and the no-music groups are not in the laboratory at the same time.) COVID 19 Exercise and Strength Training (music and no music group) Three times a week, patients will complete a muscle resistance/strength training session using professional grade resistance bands with handles (DYNAPROÔ). Patients will complete upper, lower, and core body exercises. Training will include 9-11 exercises (e.g., shoulder press, lateral arm raises), will be progressive (i.e., bands with greater resistance will be used as participants’ strength increases), and will be completed in two sets of 12-[ADDRESS_760127] generalized overall body weakness.

Version 9:July 12, 2021  Page 18 of 31 Usual Care Group: One week after randomization, patients in the control group will return to the lab to receive educational material on physical activity and general advice based on the 2018, Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans 2nd edition (U.S. Department of HHS) (see Appendix 4).142  Three times a week, patients will complete a muscle resistance/strength training session using professional grade resistance bands with handles (DYNAPROÔ) (same as RAS-therapeutic music group).  C.1.7.  Promoting & Assessing Adherence to the Exercise Program with and without RAS/RAST-music. To promote and monitor adherence to exercise (with or without RAS-music), all patients will be provided with a 3- axis accelerometer (Fitbit).100-102 Patients will be instructed to download (sync) data from the Fitbit into their smartphone or iPod devices. These data will be saved in the associated online “Fitbit user account” set up by [CONTACT_5984]. During the 12-week period of exercise training, study staff will call patients on a weekly basis to go over daily and weekly walking data saved in the Fitbit account and to answer any questions that may arise. To enhance/ensure compliance, our study staff will take a positive approach using motivational interviewing techniques. After week 12, weekly phone calls will stop. To maintain engagement with study staff, patients will be called again at week 18. At week 23, they will be called to be reminded of the final visit that will take place on week 24. C.1.8.  Time Summary. The two groups of patients will complete the same testing procedures at the same time intervals. In Tab. 5, we summarize the timeline for completion of the proposed research project. C.1.9.  Measures: 
 COVID 19 timeline          C.1.9.1.  Six-minute Walk Tests (6MWT): Patients will perform two 6MWT as fast as they can without running according to ATS recommendations (standard 6MWT)97 and two modified 6MWT at their usual/leisurely walk pace (leisurely-paced 6MWT). Walking cadence during these tests will be used to adjust the RAS exercise prescription (RAS-music group). In addition, data from the standard 6MWTs will be used to test the primary hypothesis that exercise training with RAS-music elicits greater increases in standard 6MWT distance than exercise training alone. Please note that the leisurely-paced 6MWT are only completed at baseline. The standard 6MWT are repeated at all testing time points (baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks). C.1.9.1.a.

Version 9:July 12, [ADDRESS_760128] will be recorded with a camcorder to count the number of steps and, thus, calculate patient’s cadence for the overload phase of RAS training (modified from Ho et al.58 and Liu et al.11). C.1.9.1b  Leisurely-paced 6MWT: The purpose for this test is to identify the patient’s leisurely walking cadence to set the music tempo during the warm-up and cool-down phases of the home-based exercise (RAS- music group). The test will be identical to the standard 6MWT with the exception that patients will be instructed to walk at their usual leisurely walking pace. We chose six minutes of observation because, in older adults, a one-minute step-count can overestimate usual walking cadence by [CONTACT_45848] 40%.[ADDRESS_760129] will be recorded with a camcorder to count the number of steps and, thus, calculate patient’s cadence for the warm-up and cool-down phases of RAS training (modified from Ho et al.58 and Liu et al.11). C.1.9.[ADDRESS_760130] for the following reasons: (1) The standard 6MWT is more reflective of activities of daily living than other walk tests and is currently the test of choice when using a functional walk test for clinical or research purposes ;97 and (2) The standard 6MWT assesses the submaximal level of functional capacity. Most patients limit their own intensity of exercise and are allowed to stop and rest during the test. Because most activities of daily living are performed at submaximal levels of exertion, the standard 6MWT may better reflect the functional exercise level for daily physical activities;97 (3) The standard 6MWT has a defined clinically important difference;97  C.1.9.3.  Actigraphy: Daily physical activity will be quantified using a lightweight (27 gm.), small (3.8 x 3.7 x 1.8 cm), triaxial accelerometer worn on the hip (actigraph GXT3). The actigraph GXT3 detects accelerations ranging from 0.05 to 2.5 Gs and it has a frequency responses ranging from 0.25 to 2.5 Hz. Motion outside human movements are rejected by a bandpass filter. The acceleration/deceleration signals are digitized by [CONTACT_570128] - to-digital converter at 30 times/second (30 Hz) over a pre-programed epoch interval. The monitor is programmed for start time and data collection interval, and data are retrieved for analysis. The device is capable of recording up to 22 days of continuous data in one-minute epochs. The actigraph GXT3 is both reliable (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for activity counts of 0.97)104 and valid in measuring physical activity105 even in patients with low levels of overall physical activity.106 Since physical activity is known to vary based on the day of the week due to work and leisure activities profiles,107 patients will be instructed to wear the sensor for 8 days, 24 hours a day.108 At the end of day-8, patients will doff and mail the Actigraph to the lab.  C.1.9.4.  Fitbit Step Count: The Fitbit is a commercially-available motion sensor (3-axis accelerometer) designed to monitor number of steps taken, activity (sedentary, light activity, moderate activity, moderately vigorous), distance walked and sleep.[ADDRESS_760131] is highly accurate in step counting101 – i.e., high correlation with observed step counts (r= 0.97 to 0.99)101 and high ICC (0.97).[ADDRESS_760132] are not as accurate as those worn at the hip101,111 – the Fitbit worn on the wrist can underestimated step counts by 16% for slow walking and by 11% for moderately fast walking.[ADDRESS_760133] patients are very receptive to wear wristband Fitbits for long periods of time.109 Accordingly, we will use the wristband Fitbit as a source of general information on daily level of physical activity during the 12 weeks of exercise training and will use that information to monitor adherence to the program and to motivate patients to exercise. We will use hip actigraph recordings100 to accurately quantify physical activity (see C.1.9.3.). C.1.9.5.  Questionnaires: Self-reported physical function and quality of life will be evaluated using eight questionnaires (see C.1.9.5.a. to C.1.9.5.e.). C.1.9.5.a.  Chronic Respi[INVESTIGATOR_578419] (CRQ). This questionnaire is designed to determine how the lives of patients with chronic airflow limitation are affected by [CONTACT_578454].[ADDRESS_760134] reliability and validity of the CRQ are well established.112 Patients will not be informed of their previous responses on the questionnaire when the CRQ is administered at week 6 and 12 and 24.

Acute exacerbations are defined by [CONTACT_578455], volume or consistency and are accompanied by [CONTACT_578456].31 Acute exacerbations are classified as mild (the need for increased use of inhaled bronchodilators only), moderate (the need for systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics), or severe (the need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).[ADDRESS_760137] their testing deferred until the exacerbation has resolved. If patients report an exacerbation (or have signs of exacerbation), the research team will notify [CONTACT_578464] for assessment and treatment if needed. In the final analysis, occurrence and severity of exacerbations will be included as potential covariates. C.1.11.  Data Management, Quality Control. All data will be cleaned using frequency distributions to identify errors in data entry. In addition, 10% of the data will be hand-checked for accuracy. If the coding/entry error rate is > 2% for any test/instrument, we will check 25% of the data. If the error rate is still > 2%, all of the data for that test/instrument will be hand-checked. Monitoring logs will be maintained for (a) patients screened for participation [demographic information and reason for non-participation (for non-participants only)]; (b) patient entry into the study; (c) timeliness of data collection; and (d) missing data. C.1.12.  Treatment Fidelity. We will employ treatment fidelity strategies recommended by [CONTACT_18121].[ADDRESS_760138] a detailed operations manual. To prevent group contamination, patients in the two groups will be seen/tested at different times.3,4 C.2.  Statistical Analysis. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize baseline characteristics of patients. C.2.1.  Statistical Analysis: Primary Hypotheses H1A: IN PATIENTS WITH COPD, IMPROVEMENTS IN 6-MINUTE WALKING DISTANCE WILL BE GREATER AFTER COMPLETING 12 WEEKS OF A HOME-BASED, EXERCISE PROGRAM WITH RAS-ENHANCED MUSIC THAN AFTER A HOME-BASED, EXERCISE PROGRAM WITHOUT MUSIC. The analysis of the primary outcome (improvements in 6-minute walking distance) is based on all data collected during the intervention period—baseline, [ADDRESS_760139] a sensitivity analysis129,130 based on the results of the mixed model analysis to determine whether other assumptions regarding the missing data may produce different results. One component of the sensitivity analysis will also include adjustment for

Version 9:July 12, 2021  Page 21 of 31 baseline demographic and health covariates.  C.2.2.  Statistical Analysis: Secondary Hypotheses Statistical analysis for H1c will parallel that of H1a. H1D: THE RAS-ENHANCED MUSIC GROUP WILL DEMONSTRATE GREATER INCREASES IN HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. Statistical analysis for H1d will parallel that of H1a. H2: THE RAS-ENHANCED MUSIC GROUP WILL ACCUMULATE A GREATER VOLUME OF DAILY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. THIS WILL BE DEMONSTRATED BY [CONTACT_578457] 12 WEEKS (ACTIGRAPHY). Statistical analysis for H2 will parallel that of H1a. H3: THE RAS-ENHANCED MUSIC GROUP WILL MAINTAIN IMPROVEMENTS IN MEASURED AND PERCEIVED FUNCTION AT 24 WEEKS TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN THE NO-MUSIC CONTROL GROUP. In the statistical analysis of H3, we will use independent t-tests to compare the changes in measured function (distance walked in the 6MWT and perceived function (questionnaires) between [ADDRESS_760140] paired t-tests within each group to determine whether values at 24 weeks are worse than those at 12 weeks. These computations will be based on those patients with 12 and 24-week data. To assess whether patients included in the H3 analysis are representative of the original randomized groups, we will also compare demographic and health measures (i.e., FEV1 percent predicted, comorbidities, depressive symptoms and exacerbations) of patients included in the H3 analysis to patients who were not. C.2.3.  Statistical Analysis: Exploratory objective: [exploratory objective not reported] TO ASSESS IMPACT OF PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PHENOTYPE AND CLINICAL FACTORS ON RESPONSIVENESS TO REHABILITATION ACHIEVED WITH AND WITHOUT CONCURRENT USE OF RAS-MUSIC. PHYSIOLOGICAL FACTORS INCLUDE: SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION (HSCRP), QUADRICEPS STRENGTH, RECRUITMENT AND FATIGUE, QUADRICEPS FUNCTION AND DIMENSION AFTER REHABILITATION. PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS INCLUDE: SELF-EFFICACY, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. CLINICAL FACTORS INCLUDE: ADHERENCE TO THE 12-WEEK PROGRAM, ADHERENCE TO FOLLOW-UP AND NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF EXACERBATIONS. To assess the impact of the above confounders two separate analyses will be conducted: (a) A linear regression model with changes from baseline to 12 weeks of training as the dependent variable, and assigned treatment group, physiologic and psychologic phenotype and clinical factors as the independent variables, and (b) A mixed model ANOVA with baseline, and 12 and 24 weeks measurements as dependent measures and assigned group, physiologic and psychologic phenotype and clinical factors as the independent variables. C.3. Expected Outcome: We expect to demonstrate that improvements in 6-minute walking distance from baseline to [ADDRESS_760141] three alternative outcomes will be considered. C.4.1.  Alternative Outcome #1: Improvements in 6-minute walking distance are greater after exercise-training without music. If this occurs, at least three possibilities must be considered.    One, despi[INVESTIGATOR_578421] (see C.1.5.), the RAS-music group experienced less severe quadriceps fatigue or other confounders than the exercise-alone group (e.g., imbalance in the randomization at baseline of fitness or history/likelihood of exacerbations) (see Explorative Objective). If this occurs, we will conduct a future study focused on patients with more severe COPD who have smaller

Version 9:July 12, 2021  Page 22 of 31 quadriceps and develop less fatigue during exercise and who are stratified according to baseline fitness and history/likelihood of exacerbations. Two, patients paid more attention to the RAS-music than to the assigned exercise (inadequate exercise intensity during training). Less exercise intensity would reduce potential gains obtainable with rehab. Although we consider this possibility very unlikely,11,[ADDRESS_760142] for sub-optimal challenge of the leg muscles (lack of contractile fatigue; see section A.3.2.1.) by [CONTACT_578458]-Twitches at the end of training.44 C.4.2.  Alternative Outcome #2. If improvements in 6-minute walking distance are similar in the two groups at least three possibilities must be considered. One, the RAS-music group did not comply with RAS during training. To monitor and optimize adherence with RAS-music plus exercise we developed a very rigorous protocol (see section C.1.7.). If, despi[INVESTIGATOR_578422], compliance remains poor we will investigate possible barriers to poor compliance and plan future studies to address barriers (see C.4.3. Alternative Outcome #3). Two, RAS-music adds nothing to gains achieved with exercise-training alone. Two mechanisms could cause this unlikely11,58 result: (1) insufficient stress on muscles and (2) suboptimal entrainment. The first possibility would be supported if prevalence of exercise-induced quadriceps fatigue elicited by a typi[INVESTIGATOR_171824]-training session in the two groups is the same. The second possibility would be supported if less gains are related to greater failure to entrain gait during teaching sessions (poor entrainers). If that happens, we plan future studies where RAS-music in poor entrainers will optimized – i.e., in the subgroup of poor entrainers we will increase the volume of RAS music and augment the entraining pulse (strongly emphasized beat) to facilitate music-motor synchronization.[ADDRESS_760143] of RAS-music is smaller than predicted – i.e., Type II error.  C.4.3.  Alternative Outcome #3. Neither group experiences improvement in 6-minute walking distance.  If this occurs at least three possibilities must be considered. One, neither group engaged in home-based exercise training. Several factors, including psychological phenotype (i.e., anxiety, depression)122 are known to reduce acceptance and adherence to rehab.7,8,12,57,58 If our data demonstrate that psychological factors interfere with acceptance and adherence to home rehab (see Explorative Objective), we will plan a future investigation that will include formal psychological interventions (i.e., cognitive behavioral therapy) to address those factors.123 Two, physiological/clinical factors decreased exercise tolerance thereby [CONTACT_578459].63 These factors could include frequency of exacerbations, severity of lung disease, quadriceps dimension, recruitment and strength, systemic inflammation (hsCRP) (see Explorative Objective).64 If the negative results of our study parallel these physiological/clinical factors, we will explore the possibility of combining pulmonary rehab with the administration of novel anti-inflammatory agent(s). This strategy is based on the mounting evidence that systemic inflammation may contribute to local and systemic manifestations of COPD.124 Additional ancillary interventions could include strategies to enhance muscle anabolism,125,126 to enhance muscle recruitment by [CONTACT_223160],127 and strategies to promote muscle overload (fatigue) during training.41,128 Three, limited adherence to home-based exercise: please see point One, section C.4.2. C.4.4.  Miscellaneous limitations and alternative methods C.4.4.1.  Medications: Medications may be adjusted throughout the study; such adjustments may affect outcome variables including exercise endurance. Proposed Action: Patients must be on stable therapy before enrollment. From our previous experience, we expect that several patients will require minor adjustments of their anti-hypertensive medication throughout the study. Medication lists and doses will be documented at each evaluation period. If patients require significant medication changes as judged by [CONTACT_6283]. Laghi (Pulmonary) or Budinger (Data Safety Monitoring), appropriate statistical adjustments will be made. C.4.4.2.  Patients withdrawal: Patients may withdraw from the study at a higher rate than anticipated. Proposed Action: Since we use intent-to-treat analysis, any patient completing at least six weeks of training will be included in the analysis. If more than 20% of patients withdraw - or have to be withdrawn - prior to the sixth week of training, we will increase the number of randomized patients accordingly. C.4.4.3.  Lack of internet access: Some patients have no internet access. (Patients need internet access to sync the Fitbit). Proposed Action: Patients without internet access will be provided with a list neighborhood locations with Wi-Fi hotspots. Alternatively, patients will be free to come to the lab to sync

Version 9:July 12, 2021  Page 23 of 31 the Fitbit. C..4.4.4.  Music in the control group: Some patients in the control group may be used to listening to music while walking. Proposed Action: Throught the study, patients in the no-music group will be instructed to avoid listening to any music while walking. In addition, at the end of the study, we will ask patients in the control group whether they listened to music while walking. Appropriate statistical adjustments will be made if needed. C.5.  Potential Problems. C5.1. Insufficient patient enrollment. This is a very unlikely considering the large number of patients with COPD cared for at Hines VAH and our excellent track record.3,4,80,[ADDRESS_760144] of Hines. We could advertise in local newspapers and on Chicago Transit Authority busses.96 C5.2. Exacerbations. Exacerbations can cause functional impairment and decreased peripheral muscle  function (see sections A.3.4 and C.2.3. Exploratory Objective). Exacerbations will be tracked as part of our data safety monitoring.  C.5.3. Adherence to the home-based program. In our studies, patient compliance to training has ranged from 90 to 95%.3,4,94 In this proposal we will take several steps to ensure high compliance with training (see C.1.7.).139 All patients will receive at weekly phone calls. In addition, they will be called if they do not sync their Fitbit or do not exercise for three consecutive sessions. Additionally, patients will receive $20 to cover travel expenses for each visit to the lab. C.6. Future Directions. If, as we hypothesize, RAS-music plus exercise-training improves exercise capacity at the conclusion of a 12-week home-based rehab program and, thereafter, it promotes the maintenance of physical activity, three questions for future studies will arise: (1) What is the effect of RAS-music plus exercise on the systemic manifestations of COPD including depression, osteoporosis, and coronary artery disease? (2) Could RAS-music plus exercise decrease the staggering heath care cost for veterans and non-veterans with COPD? (3) What is the effect of RAS-music plus exercise on survival? To address these questions, we will pursue a multi-center randomized clinical trial. In addition, we will consider additional studies tailored to specific subgroups of patients. For example, if we find that to achieve and maintain benefits from home-based, RAS-music rehab patients must also develop quadriceps fatigue,44,45 we will design an investigation where in “non-fatigures” we will combine RAS-music plus a one-leg exercise-training41,128 or RAS-music plus neuromuscular electrical stimulation of the quadriceps, gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles.126 Risk to Subjects a. Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics. Patients recruited for this study will be adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Most patients with COPD that we recruited in the past1-3 were in their late 60’s or early 70’s. Accordingly, we anticipate that patients who will participate the proposed study will be of similar age. We expect to enroll [ADDRESS_760145] to screen about  6000 patients via electronic chart review. More information about recruitment follows in the Recruitment Section below. Patients’ fulfilment of inclusion/exclusion criteria (Table 2 above) will be evaluated during the screening and baseline testing phase of the study. Non- veterans will be enrolled in the study. We recruit non-veterans to ensure that an adequate number of women participate in the study.  b. Sources of Materials. Most of our research data are collected from the research participants and used for research purposes. We do use medical record information as part of our medical history review. We also use pulmonary function test results if they have been completed within the previous year and there have been no exacerbations or reasons to believe that the patient’s condition has changed.  c. Potential Risks. There are potential risks associated with this study. There is the risk that unknown cardiovascular or other clinical conditions may be uncovered as a result of participation in the study. In our ongoing study, 30 patients were excluded from participation due to medical comorbidities. These

Version 9:July 12, 2021  Page 24 of 31 included cardiovascular disease, cancer, hypertension, and diabetes. There are also other risks such as falling, muscle soreness, lightheadedness or dizziness that may occur with exercise training. These are extremely rare occurrences. Patients may choose to not participate in the research program or withdraw from the research program at any time. There is a clinical pulmonary rehabilitation program that they can enroll in at the Hines VA Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_578423]. Adequacy of Protection from Risk a. Recruitment and Informed Consent. Patients are identified from the Pulmonary Clinic, their ICD-9CM code (ICD-9CM 496, 491.21), clinic stop (pulmonary clinic or pulmonary function testing laboratory), outpatient medical clinics, or self-referral. Recruitment flyers, brochures, and posters will be displayed in key areas of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_578424].  A brief electronic chart review (CPRS) is conducted. A HIPAA waiver and an informed consent waiver will be sought to screen electronic medical records (CPRS) of potential patients for eligibility in the study. Patients are excluded if they do not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria (Table 1). All other potential participants are sent a recruitment flyer and letter inviting them to join the study. A short survey and return envelope is enclosed for them to return. Patients may choose to be contact[CONTACT_578460]. If they choose not to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], no more contact [CONTACT_58661]. If they do not respond, a second letter of invitation is sent. If patients respond positively, they are contact[CONTACT_578461] (S. O’Connell RN, MBA). The study is briefly explained and if the patient is still interested and no exclusionary criteria have been uncovered an in-person visit is scheduled. In the interim, a copy of the informed consent is mailed to the potential participant to review with their family or physician. We believe that informed consent is a process that begins at the letter of invitation and/or when patients inquire about the study and does not end until they have completed the study.  When the initial in-person visit takes place, research staff will explain the purpose of the study, study procedures, benefits, risks, confidentiality and privacy, and the subject’s rights. Since this study involves a substantial time commitment on the part of the patient, time commitment is emphasized during the consenting process. The written consent is reviewed in detail and is used as a guide for the person obtaining the consent. Patients are encouraged to ask questions throughout this process. The informed consent procedure generally takes 30-60 minutes to complete. Patients are encouraged to take the consent home and review it with their family and/or their doctor before signing. Some patients insist on signing the consent the same day that the study is explained. If this occurs, the patient is given a copy of the consent to bring home and informed again that he/she is free to withdraw from the study at any time. patients will be paid $[ADDRESS_760146] of appropriate walking shoes. The amount of reimbursement is not excessive and will not be emphasized during the recruitment process.  [CONTACT_578470] O’Connell RN, MBA and [CONTACT_578464] will be responsible for obtaining the informed consent from study participants. Ms. O’Connell has been a research study nurse and project manager for the past 22 years and has been a member of the Hines/Lovell IRB. She is very experienced in obtaining informed consent and in HIPAA authorizations. She has worked in the Physical Performance Laboratory for the past 17 years and is extremely familiar with the study procedures, risks, and benefits of participation. Ms. O’Connell will be primarily responsible for the informed consent process. [CONTACT_578464] has been conducting research for over [ADDRESS_760147] Risk Six-minute walk testing: The six-minute walk is a submaximal test. McDermott (2014) reports only one

We have completed >2000 six-minute walk tests on patients with COPD without incident.  Exercise training: Training sessions will be completed in the patient’s home environment. Investigators and research staff will discuss places to exercise and plans for walking with the subject. Patients will be provided with alternative safe places for exercise as well areas to exercise in lieu of inclement weather. If patients are having difficulty finding places to walk, the staff will assist them in finding a place that is close their home. Those assigned to the RAS-entrainment group will walk with headphones on.  Burden: Given that much of the intervention will be completed at home or in the community, burden should not be an issue. Also, patients will be paid $20 for each visit to the laboratory. The compensation is intended to pay for travel and time for participation.  Uncovering unknown illness: At the time of consent, patients will be informed that there is a chance that an illness will be uncovered during the study. Coronary artery disease was the primary disease discovered during our previous studies. It will be made clear to patients that study staff will assist them in seeking resolution to problems discovered throughout the course of the study, but financial obligations associated with this follow-up treatment will not be paid for by [CONTACT_67300].  Confidentiality: All research data will be coded for data entry so that a patient’s identity cannot be determined (e.g., COPD001, COPD002). All computerized files will be password protected and available only to those involved with the research project. All data are stored on a secure VA Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_578425] (our laboratory has [ADDRESS_760148]). [CONTACT_211239] does have an encrypted VA laptop that she uses to analyze data and to write manuscripts. Drs. Laghi and Collins both have encrypted Ironkey flashdrives for transferring data when needed. Since data are transferred from the VA network drive to the encrypted laptop, special precautions have been taken. First, an approved encrypted thumb drive is always used to transfer data (this is generally not done as a first choice for transferring data; VPN connections are used with the encrypted laptop and data are moved behind the firewall). Next, identifiable data (i.e., screening logs), are kept separately from the study data files. These files are never removed from the VA network drive. Thus, any files transferred to the laptop are identified only by [CONTACT_5056] (COPD1, COPD2). Lastly, we do not enter social security numbers into our databases. Login and passwords will be created for the Fitbit devices. This will allow the research staff to monitor step counts from the Fitbit on the Fitbit website. No Protected Health Information (PHI) will be entered into the Fitbit website. The patient’s name [CONTACT_578462]’s study number. Once the study has ended, the logins will be reconfigured so that patients can use whatever name [CONTACT_578463]. Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_578426]. These data and access to these rooms are available to study personnel only. We retain records according to the new records retention policies (6 years after cut-off time). EKGs from the exercise stress tests will be discarded when patient follow-up is completed. We are connected to the Cardiology EKG network and the EKGs are stored there indefinitely. If patients provide written permission and request that their test be sent to a treating physician, these data and tests will be given or sent to others. Release of information procedures are followed. These procedures will be explained to patients at the time of completing the informed consent.  Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others. The risks to patients are low when compared to the potential benefits of participation. Since there is no non-exercising control group, all patients have potential to increase their physical function. In addition to decreased breathlessness and improved quality of life2,7,[ADDRESS_760149] manager (S. O’Connell, RN, MHA) actively

Version 9:July 12, 2021  Page 26 of 31 works with clinicians to coordinate appointments efficiently.  Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained. Increasingly, cardiac rehabilitation efforts are being moved to the home environment. These trends are the same for pulmonary rehabilitation. Finding ways to keep patients involved in home-based rehabilitation programs is critically important. We reason that our innovative home-based exercise program augmented by [CONTACT_4676]-tailored, rhythmically enhanced music will successfully lessen patients’ perception of exercise-induced dyspnea and exercise-induced effort while concurrently increasing intensity and duration of walking.  Data Safety Monitoring/Adverse Events.  Data Safety Monitoring will be ongoing throughout the study. [CONTACT_578471] (Northwestern University) will be responsible for reviewing our data safety monitoring reports yearly. Data collection methods and forms will be reviewed initially. [CONTACT_578472] will be notified of all study-related serious adverse events within [ADDRESS_760150]. Budinger: study event update (e.g., changes in personnel, recruitment strategies, testing procedures), study enrollment and randomization data (actual vs. expected), baseline data on patients by [CONTACT_91727], recruitment and retention flow diagram (i.e., CONSORT diagram), patient retention data (deaths, loss to follow up, withdrawals) and adverse event monitoring log. Adverse events will be split in study related and non-study related. Specific adverse events to be monitored include: exacerbations, falls, emergency room visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48279]. Subject group assignment will be blinded for the above reports.  Women and Minority Inclusion: We actively recruit veterans to participate in our studies. We expect at least 20% of our patients to be minority patients (our current study consists of 11% minority patients). To boost the number of women participants, we will request permission to the local IRB to enroll non-veterans with COPD. Vulnerable patients will not be recruited in this study.

Title:  The Effect of Auriculotherapy for Post -Operative P ain Management following Rotator Cuff Surgery : 
A Randomized, Placebo -Controlled Study  
Introduction  
The current opi[INVESTIGATOR_152070] a renewed interest in exploring non -pharmacological 
techniques to treat post -operative pain. An increasing number of patients are suffering from the adverse 
effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_58328], including post -oper ative nausea and vomiting, respi[INVESTIGATOR_41826], immunosuppression, constipation, and most recently, addiction. In the [LOCATION_002], over 
$600 billion is spent every year on opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827], including $[ADDRESS_175273] -
operative narcotic consumption in participants undergoing rotator cuff surg ery. Enrolled participants 
will be randomized to a control or interventional arm of the study, where they will either receive an 
active auriculotherapy treatment with nitrogen gas  (intervention) or non-active auriculotherapy 
treatment without nitrogen gas  (placebo).  
Title:  The Effect of Auriculotherapy for Post -Operative P ain Management following Rotator Cuff Surgery : 
A Randomized, Placebo -Controlled Study  
Background  
Auriculortherapy is an ancient technique initially used to treat back pain and was rediscovered 
in the 1940s by [CONTACT_152084]. Paul Nogier, who postulated that the ear contains a complete 
representation of the body with the hea d down. The theory is that any pathological condition is 
associated with a corresponding modification of the ear point. The technique consists of invalidating the 
pathologic or dysfunctional ear point, which generates an impulse  that is transmitted to the brain, 
where the brain tries to reset the ear point to homeostasis. The brain also tries to reset the 
corresponding point of the body to h omeostasis . 
Auriculotherapy is grounded in the concept that the ear can be considered a keyboard of the 
computer, with  the brain being the hard drive , due to its embryologic origin and innervation. From an 
embryologic perspective, the conchae originate from the ectoderm, the lobe and ascending part of the 
helix, tragus and anti -tragus originated from the endoderm, Helix o riginated from the mesoderm. From 
the innervation perspective, specific parts of the ear are innervated by a specific branch of cranial 
nerves and plexus. These nerves carry impulses from the body to the ear, from the ear to the brain, and 
then back from b rain to the ear . The fundamental princip le of action of Auriculotherapy  is based on a 
temporary and reversible invalidation of the somatotopic representation zones  on the auricular 
cartography  innervating the different section of the ear .  
Auriculotherapy is neuro -physiologically based —a functional MRI study conducted in [ADDRESS_175274] 
been proposed —the most recent and scientifically -based cartography is using a segmentogram with a 
corpus collosum as the center of symmetry. Validation of this cartography has been obtained in studies 
using functional MRI.

A Randomized, Placebo -Controlled Study  
Specific Ai ms 
1. This study  will prospectively investigate the efficacy of auriculotherapy  in reducing perioperative 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_152071]   
3. To prospectively investigate role that auriculotherapy  may have in reducing opi [INVESTIGATOR_152072] a  prospective , randomized, placebo -controlled trial at the University of 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_45589] (UPMC) Shadyside Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_152073] . Institutional review 
board approval will be obtained before eligible patients are recruited and consented. Trial will be 
registered at www.clinicaltrial.gov before beginning recruitment.  
Recruitment  
Potential subjects will be re cruited in the pre-operative area of Shadyside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_152074] -cuff surgery. Patients who agree to participate in the trial will sign an IRB approved 
Informed Consent Form.  
Randomization Process  
Participating patients will be randomized by [CONTACT_152085].  
 
 
 
 
Title:  The Effect of Auriculotherapy for Post -Operative P ain Management following Rotator Cuff Surgery : 
A Randomized, Placebo -Controlled Study  
Treatment Groups  
Control Arm : Control group will receive  an auriculotherapy placebo - this placebo  involves using the 
auriculotherapy cryopunct ure device without  the compressed nitrogen gas  to invalidate innervated 
points on the ear, plus the standard of care  interscalene block  and post -operative pain management 
protocol  
Interventional Arm:  Intervention group will receive  actual auriculotherapy p rocedure, which involves 
using the auriculotherapy cryopuncture device with  the nitrogen gas  to invalidate innervated points on 
the ear, plus the standard of care interscalene block  and post -operative pain management protocol  
Inclusion Criteria  
1. Subject is greater than [ADDRESS_175275] di agnosed with a chronic pain condition  which daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_152075]  
3. Anatomical malformation, which in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_152076] e with the placement 
of the nerve block  
4. Raynaud's disease  diagnosis  
5. Patient refusal

A Randomized, Placebo -Controlled Study  
Data Collection and Outcom e Measures  
Once patient has signed the Informed Consent to participate in this trial, demographic information and 
medical history will be collected from each participant on the day of surgery. Research staff will record 
this information from the medical chart.  The Medical Outcomes Study Questionnaire 12 -Item Short 
Form Health Survey (SF -12) will also be administered  at this time to obtain baseline value.  
Randomization will occur by [CONTACT_58337] a subject ID number, and this ID numbe r will 
correspond to a treatment allocation based on a pre -designed randomization schema. This treatment 
allocation (intervention/control) will be contained in a sealed, opaque, envelope with the subject ID 
number that is designated on envelope. The master  randomization list will be created and held by [CONTACT_152086].  
Once patient is randomized to a treatment group by [CONTACT_3647], Auriculotherapy will be performed 
using a cryopunct ure device in the post -operative  setting, either with nitrogen gas (intervention group), 
or an empty cryopunture with no gas (control group). [CONTACT_152089] is formally certified in auriculotherapy 
(diploma attached). After proper disinfection of the designate d ear, the treatment consists of the 
stimulation of 9 ear points on the ipsilateral ear. These points include: -Ω2 (the master point for the 
mesoderm), the shoulder point, [ADDRESS_175276] (the stellar ganglion, the 
sensory and motor C7 branches, the sensory master point (MSP), the reticular master point (RMP) and 
the point corresponding to the Thalamus).   
Finally, the stimulation of the ACTH point completes the treatment. The total time required to complete 
auriulotherapy treatment i s approximately 10 minutes

A Randomized, Placebo -Controlled Study  
The enrolled  subject  will also receive an interscalene block as per standard of care.  The patient will 
receive standard of care treatment for surgery, post -operative pain management, and physical therapy.  
After surgery, the su bject will be assessed at time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_152077], administer pain satisfaction questionnaire (0 -6) and obtain NRS pain at rest and with 
movement scores (0 -10).  
When the patient is discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l, the subject will be asked to take home and complete 
a subject diary where they will record their total narcotic/pain medication consumption, pain 
satisfaction score (0 -6), and NRS pain score (0 -10), and adverse events daily for first [ADDRESS_175277] op day 14 and once a month for three months (post op days 30, 60 and 90). 
The subject will be instructed to complete the diary just before bedtime on these days. The patient will 
be contact[CONTACT_152087] [ADDRESS_175278] -operative Day 14, 30, 60 and 90 telephone calls, functional recovery will be measured using the 
Medical Outcomes Study Questionnaire 1 2-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF -12). The subject will also 
be asked to assess their overall patient satisfaction at the Day 90 call, on a scale of 0 (least satisfaction) 
to 10 (most satisfaction) . 
Analgesic efficacy in both groups will also be evaluate d by [CONTACT_152088] 
(measured with  oral morphine equivalent doses of analgesics used to provide pain relief). Secondary 
outcome measures will include total non -narcotic pain medication consumption for 5-days post -
discharge, time to readiness for discharge from PACU, time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], readmission  to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_152078] -related  issues, incidence of post operative comp lications, overall patient 
satisfaction, patient satisfaction relating to pain management and functional recovery. Functional 
recovery will be measured using the Medical Outcomes Stud y Questionnaire 12 -Item Short Form Health 
Survey (SF -12).

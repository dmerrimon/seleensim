Executive Summary  
Title  Predischa Rge initiation of Ivabradine in ManagEment of Heart Failure (PRIME -
HF) 
Patient 
Population  Post-Acute Heart Failure Syndrome with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 
<35%, [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) class II -IV symptoms despi[INVESTIGATOR_824982] -directed medical therapy, documented clinical stability, and sinus rhythm 
with a resting heart rate of >70 beats per minute (bpm).  
Location  Approximately 50  clinical centers in the [LOCATION_002]  
Brief Rationale  Heart failure (HF) affects over 5 million adults in the [LOCATION_002] alone and the 
prevalence is expected to increase.1 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_824983] (HFrEF),[ADDRESS_1143909] that the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824984] a unique opportunity for patients with HF to initiate guideline -directed 
medical therapy.3 
Ivabradine is an orally available, specific inhibitor of the If current in the sinoatrial 
node recently approved for use for patients with HF rEF by [CONTACT_33438]. A double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled trial demonstrated 
that h eart-rate reduction with ivabradine improves clinical outcomes for patients with 
chronic, symptomatic HF.4 The initiation of ivabradine specifically  in patients 
following stabilization for acute HF has not been evaluated.  
Since ivabradine was FDA approved relatively recently, this study also serves as a 
strategy trial to explore drug acquisition for a drug that has been proven efficacious 
to the heart failure popu lation and has been added to 2016 ACC/AHA/HFSA

enter a registry of ivabradine -eligible patients with doc umentation of the medication 
acquisition challenges experienced by [CONTACT_825024].  
Treatment  Pre-discharge initiation  of twice -daily oral ivabradine (starting at 5mg BID with 
encouraged dose titration to 7.5mg BID) versus usual care (i.e., post -discharge 
initiation of ivabradine at discretion of routine physician) for [ADDRESS_1143911] of pre discharge initiation of ivabradine  on: 
1) Heart Rate  
a) Change in heart rate from baseline to 180 days  
b) Median heart rate at 180 days  
2) Patient -Centered Outcomes  
a) Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire  (KCCQ)  
b) Patient Global Assessment  (PGA)  
Tertiary 
Objectives  To explore the impact of pre discharge initiation of ivabradine on:  
1) Evidence -Based Implementation  
a) Assessments of beta -blocker use at 180 days (e.g., proportion on beta -
blocker, proportion on target dose, mean change in dose)  
[COMPANY_010] Proprietary - Confidential

Confidential  Version 3 – July 19, 2017  
 12 b) Other assessments of ivabradine use at 180 days (e.g., mean dose, proportion 
with any initiation, proportion on maximum dose)  
i) Evaluations will incorporate data based on whether or not indication 
status was retained and whether or not an ivabradine prescrip tion was 
provided.  
2) Tolerability of ivabradine and events of interest  
a) Symptomatic bradycardia  
b) Symptomatic hypotension  
c) Other symptoms leading to ivabradine discontinuation  
To explore barriers to ivabradine acquisition in routine clinical practice.  
Summary  of

Abbreviated 
Study Flow  1) Patients with a reduced LVEF ( <35%) will be identified during a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824986]. Patients will be screened throughout the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824987] . 
2) Prior to discharge, clinical stability will be assessed including blood pressure and 
heart rate  criteria . Patients with a pre -discharge blood pressure of >90/50 mm Hg 
and heart rate > [ADDRESS_1143912] a planned/scheduled up -titration of beta -blocker in the following 
4 weeks. However, adjustments of background therapy can be made at any point 
during the study period at the discretion of the treating physician.  Patients can be 
consent ed and randomized prior to the day of discharge as long as they meet 
entry criteria.

 14 3) Consented patients will undergo baseline examination, KCCQ, and PGA. 
Baseline heart rate will be assessed on at least one 12-lead ECG  (screening ECG 
may be used).  
4) Participants will then be randomized to pre discharge initiation of ivabradine or 
usual care. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_68566] .  
5) Participants  randomized to pre discharge initiation of ivabradine should receive at 
least the initial dose of 5m g BID prior to discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824988] . 
6) If the patient is randomized to pre -discharge initiation, the study team and/or 
inpatient care team (e.g., providers and care coordinator) should initiate the 
process to acquire outpatient medication,  explore patient costs and consider 
support options for the patient. If the patient is not able to pay for the medication, 
they will continue in the study and will enter a registry of ivabradine -eligible 
patients with documentation of the medication acquis ition challenges 
experienced by [CONTACT_825024].  
7) Consistent with current HF guidelines,[ADDRESS_1143913] t he dose the dose to 2.5mg BID or 7.5mg BID. For 
participants randomized to usual care, ivabradine may be initiated at the 
provider’s discretion.  
8) All participants will have a second  follow -up study  visit 6  weeks  (42 +/- 14 days) 
post-discharge . Heart rate, systolic blood pressure and quality of life (KCCQ and 
PGA) will be assessed. For participants already taking ivabradine in either 
treatment group, the heart rate may again be used to adjust the dose of 
ivabradine. For participants not yet rec eiving ivabradine, it may be initiated at the 
provider’s discretion.  
9) All participants will receive a 90 (+/-7) day post -discharge  phone call  by [CONTACT_825025].

Heart rate  (on exam and 1 ECG) , systolic blood pressure and quality of life 
(KCCQ and PGA) will be assessed.  The treating physician may initiate 
ivabradine per usual care clinical practice.

The 1 -year mortality rate after a HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] 20 -30%, and this 
number has been relatively unchanged over the past decade.6,[ADDRESS_1143915] been 
approved for use in Europe for several years11 for patients with symptomatic chronic 
HFrEF (LVEF <35%) and a heart rate >75 bpm on guideline -directed medical therapy (or 
intolerance/contra -indication to beta -blocker use). Ivabradine  was recently approved for 
use in the [LOCATION_002].  However, no US data exist regarding the potential adoption of 
ivabradine into routine clinic al care . 
Since ivabradine is a newly approved drug, this study also serves as a strategy 
trial to challenge study sites to explore drug acquisition for a drug that has been proven 
efficacious to the heart failure population and has been added to 2016 ACC/AHA/HFSA

These improvements in care were achieved without increasing side effects or index 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_82814]. Similar to beta -blockers and other medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_824992], ivabradine was initiall y studied in patients with chronic HF.4 The initiation of 
ivabradine  specifically  in patients following stabilization for acute HF has not been 
evaluated.  
1.2 Prior data  
The Systolic Heart failure treatment with Ivabradine Trial (SHIFT) enrolled 6,558 
patients with chronic, symptom atic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.4 In this 
double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled trial , patients treated with ivabradine were 
less likely to experience the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10889] (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 , 0.90). These results support that 
ivabradine represents a novel treatment strategy for patients with HFrEF already on 
optimal medical therapy including a beta -blocker.  
A prior study of data from the Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving 
Treatment in H ospi[INVESTIGATOR_570513] (OPTIMIZE -HF) registry  suggest 
that a substantial proportion of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824993] .12 This study analyzed 10,696 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824994] a LVEF  <40%. Patients with a history of atrial

4.1 Overview of Study  
The PRIME -HF study is a multi -center, patient -level, randomized, open -label study of 
approximately 450 patients with reduced LVEF of <35% and heart -rate >70 bpm who a re 
being discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824997] a treatment strategy of predischarge  initiation of ivabradine or usual care .  
4.2 Screening Phase  
Patients admitted with acute HF will be screened for basic e ntry criteria. To be eligible, 
patients should be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191546] a cute HF (primary or secondary diagnosis) . Patients 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_824998] -directed medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_824999]-blockers. Patients will be screened for potential eligibility  during the index 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_825000], heart rate, and 
blood pressure will be assessed once the patient is stable and approaching discharge.  
Patients can be consented and randomized prior to the day of dis charge as long as they 
meet entry criteria.  
4.3  Clinical Evaluation Prior to Randomization  
When patients are approaching the time for  discharge, final study eligibility will be 
determined. Prior to discharge, clinical  stability  will be assessed to ensure reso lution of 
signs and symptoms of acute HF. Blood pressure and resting heart rate will be assessed. 
Patients with a pre -discharge blood pressure of >90/50 mm Hg and heart rate > [ADDRESS_1143925] a

dose of medication prior to discharge  if possible . If ivabradine is administered and then 
discharge is delayed, participants should continue on open -label ivabradine  until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954].  Participants should then receive a prescription for outpatient ivabradin e. Study 
drug will not be provided as part of the study.  If the patient is randomized to pre -
discharge initiation, the study team and/or inpatient care team (e.g., providers and care 
coordinator) should initiate the process to acquire outpatient medication , explore patient 
costs and consider support options for the patient. If the patient is not able to pay for the 
medication, they will continue in the study and will enter a registry of ivabradine -eligible

 30 patients with documentation of the medication acqui sition challenges experienced by [CONTACT_825029].  All participants will be counseled on the signs and symptoms of 
bradycardia including lightheadedness, dizziness, and syncope. Participants will also be 
followed carefully for the remainder of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_825003].   
5.4 Follow -up Evaluations  
5.4.1 Clinical Follow -up Visit (Study Visit 1)  
Consistent with current HF guidelines,[ADDRESS_1143933] a follow -up study 
visit within 7 -14 days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] . The timing of this visit will be determined by 
[CONTACT_44375]. Current medication use and doses, physical examination, heart rate, 
systolic blood pressure and quality of life (KCCQ and PGA) will be assessed at this 
clinical visit. For participants randomized to pre discharge initiation of ivabradine  and on 
5mg BID , the heart rate may be used to adjust the dose of ivabradine to 2.5mg BID or 
7.5mg BID (Table  1). For participants randomized to usual care, ivabradine may be 
initiated at the provider’s disc retion. Participants not eligible for ivabradine at th is visit 
will be document ed and continue study follow -up.

resting heart rate >60 bpm, the dose may be increased to either 5mg or 7.5mg BID. If the 
resting heart rate is <50 bpm or the partici pant is experiencing signs or symptoms related 
to bradycardia, then the dose may be reduced to 2.5mg BID or the study drug should be 
discontinued. If the heart rate is 50 to 60 bpm, then the dose may be maintained. For 
participants not yet taking ivabradin e, then it may be initiated at the provider’s discretion. 
Participants not eligible for ivabradine at th is visit will be documented and continue study 
follow -up. Study investigators or designee will assess  quality of life (KCCQ and PGA ).  
5.4.3  Phone Call  
At 90  (+/-7) days post -discharge , participants should be contact[CONTACT_55654] ( phone call )  
to assess for event status, c urrent medication use and doses,  and tolerability of ivabradine ,

An Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety composite 
data at regular intervals throughout the study. The DSMB will be empowered to stop the 
study for evidence of harm but not for evidence of efficacy .  
8.3.1 Suspected Adverse Reaction  
In PRIME -HF a  suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that ivabradine  caused the event. “Reasonable possibility” suggests 
there is a causal relationship betwee n the drug and the AE. “Suspected adverse reaction” 
[COMPANY_010] Proprietary - Confidential  
PRIME -HF 
   
 
Confidential  Version 3 – July 19, 2017  
 39 implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means 
any AE caused by a drug.  
8.4 Assessment of Adverse Event Severity  
The determination of AE severity rests on medical jud gment of a medically qualified 
investigator. The severity of AEs will be graded using the following definitions:  
 Mild : Awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated.  
 Moderate : Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity and 
may warrant intervention.  
 Severe : Incapacitating with inability to do usual activities or significantly 
affects clinical status and warrants intervention.  
8.[ADDRESS_1143946] assess the relationship of an y AE to the use of 
study drug, based on available information, using the following guidelines:  
 Not related : There is not a reasonable causal relationship between the 
investigational product and the AE.  
 Unlikely related : No temporal association or cause of  the event has been 
identified, or the drug or biologic cannot be implicated.  
 Possibly related : There is reasonable evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and AE.  
 Probably related : There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship betw een 
the drug and AE, and the influence of other factors is unlikely.

 43 10 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN AND  DETERMINATION OF SA MPLE 
SIZE  
10.1 Overview  
All planned analyses will be prospectively defined for this study and approved by [CONTACT_380771]. In addition, exploratory analyses will be performed to help explain 
and understand findings observed from the planned analyses. Statistical tests with a 2 -
sided p -value <0.[ADDRESS_1143953] ically significant, unless otherwise stated. 
Analyses will be performed using SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).   
The primary endpoint of the study is proportion of participants using ivabradine at 180 
days.  
10.2 Sample Size Justification  
We assumed that 35% of participants randomized to the usual care arm will be treated 
with ivabradine at 180 days, and the predischarge initiation of ivabradine would increase 
the use at 180 days to 50%. The usual care event rate is  based on investigator estimates of 
clinical use in the first year following approval by [CONTACT_2165]. At 
a two -sided Type I error rate of 0.05, 450 participants would provide 85% power to 
detect a significant difference in the rate of ivabradine use between groups. This sample 
size estimate is based on a two -group continuity corrected chi -square test and assume s a 
1:1 allocation ratio between the predischarge initiation of ivabradine and usual care 
groups . This sample size estimate allow s for 8% missing primary endpoint data. 
 
For the KCCQ overall summary endpoint we have made a conservative assumption of [ADDRESS_1143954] deviation.  For this measure, the m edium and large clinically 
meaningful differences are 5 and 10 points for the KCCQ overall summary measure, 
respectively.  Allowing for approximately 8% missing data, the proposed sample size of 
450 participants provides approximately 90% power to detect a difference of 5 points 
[COMPANY_010] Proprietary - Confidential  
PRIME -HF 
   
 
Confidential  Version 3 – July 19, 2017  
 44 (medium clinically meaningful difference). The power calculations are based on the two 
sample t -test with a two -sided Type I error rate of 0.05.  
10.3 Analysis of the Primary Endpoint  
The primary analysis will be conducted on an intention -to-treat (ITT) basis including all 
randomized  participants . A log istic regression model with ivabradine use at [ADDRESS_1143955] for the ivabradine at discharge 
group will be sum marized by [CONTACT_825031] 95% confidence interval.   
10.4 Analysis of Secondary and Tertiary Endpoints  
 Heart Rate Assessments  
o Change in heart rate from baseline to 180 days  across treatment groups.  
Change will be calculated as follows: (Baseli ne heart rate – 180-day heart 
rate). Comparisons across treatment groups will be performed using a 
linear model with adjustment for the baseline heart rate and beta-blocker 
use.  Treatment groups will be included in the regression model as main 
effects . Multiple imputation will be used to impute 180 -day missing HR 
observations  if missing is > 10% . 
o Heart rate  in bpm  at 180 days will be compared in the predischarge 
ivabradine group compared across treatment groups. Comparisons across 
treatment groups will be performed using a linear model with adjustment 
for the baseline heart rate and beta-blocker use.  Treatment groups will be 
included in the regression model as main effects . Multiple imputation will 
be used to imp ute 180 -day missing HR observations  if missing is > 10% . 
 Changes in symptoms and quality -of-life from baseline to 180 days as assessed by  
[CONTACT_825032] a linear model 
with adjustment for the baseline quality -of-life and beta -blocker use. A multiple 
imputation approach will be used to account for possible missing data. The 
[COMPANY_010] Proprietary - Confidential  
PRIME -HF 
   
 
Confidential  Version 3 – July 19, 2017  
 45 differences between treatment groups will be estimated using point estimates and 
the associated two -sided 95% confidence intervals.  
 Beta-blocker use at 180 days as assessed by [CONTACT_941] (a) proportion of participants on a 
beta-blocker at 180 -days, (b)  proportion on target dose, (c)  the proportion 
discontinuing beta -blockers at 180 days and (d) the mean change in beta -blocker 
dose from discharge to 18 0 days  will be compared between treatment groups.  
 Ivabradine use at 180 days as assessed by [CONTACT_941] (a) proportion of appropriate 
participants with any initiation of ivabradine at 180 days, (b) the proportion of 
appropriate participants at the maximum  dose of ivabradine at 180 day  (i.e., 7.5 
mg twice daily) , and (c) the mean dose of ivabradine achieved at 180 days  will be 
compared between treatment groups.  
 The event counts and subject incidences for the following adverse events will be 
presented for the treatment groups:  
o Symptomatic bradycardia  
o Symptomatic hypotension  
 Barriers to the acquisition of ivabradine. Barriers will be documented in the case

2.1 Multiple Sclerosis and Spasticity  
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an acquired inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous 
system (CNS) that is regarded as the foremost cause of non -traumatic neurologic disability in 
adults in North America .  Multiple sclerosis  has a prevalence of approximately 1  case per 1,000 in 
the population and a predominance in women (female  to male ratio, 2:1).  The mean age at onset 
is 30 years.  Although MS is a heterogeneous illness , in 85% of patients it begins with e pi[INVESTIGATOR_49564], 
largely reversible neurologic dysfunction, in a pattern termed relapsing- remitting  (RR)  MS.  In 
75% of those patients, the disease advances over time to a steady, irreversible worsening state 
designated secondary -progressive (SP) MS.  Less than 5%  of patients have very severe disability 
(fulminant MS) within the first 5 years after onset, and 10% to 20% of patients remain unimpaired 
without therapy (benign MS) for [ADDRESS_141996] some 
permanent disability.   Multiple scleros is treatment relies on pharmaceutical agents to slow disease 
progression and reduce the burden of MS symptoms. 
Spasticity is a common complication in MS and occurs in up to 84% of patients.  The main sign 
of spasticity is resistance to passive limb movemen t characterized by [CONTACT_126197], clonus, and exaggerated deep reflexes.   The associated features of spasticity, including 
pain, gait disorders, fatigue, and loss of function, significantly affect patient quality of life.  Data 
collect ed from the North American Research Committee on MS (NARCOMS) Patient Registry 
showed that 34% of over 20,[ADDRESS_141997] -line pharmacotherapy as described in the MS Council for Clinical Practice Guidelines for 
treatment of spasticity in MS.  However, the therapeutic potential of baclofen is limited because it 
is poorly tolerated by [CONTACT_126198], drowsiness, and worsening of 
fatigue.  Therefore, an unmet medical need exists for an effective, better tolerated oral treatment 
of spasticity.  
Baclofen is a racemate (rac- baclofen) consist ing of an equal mixture of two enantiomers:  the l- or 
R-enantiomer (arbaclofen) and the d- or S -enantiomer.  
Osmotica Pharmaceutical is currently developi[INVESTIGATOR_126181] -release tablets (AERT) for 
the treatment of spasticity in patients with MS.  Ar baclofen is the active R -enantiomer of baclofen 
and it has been postulated that the efficacy of baclofen is primarily due to the R -enantiomer.  This 
Study  OS440 -[ADDRESS_141998].OS440 -3005.PR.A02.[LOCATION_003]  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 10 of 70 
 clinical study is an open- label extension of the Phase 3 double -blind Study  OS440- 3004 to 
evaluate the long -term safety  and tolerability  of AERT in patients with spasticity due to MS.  
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is t o evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of  AERT in 
patients with spasticity due to MS.  
3.2 Secondar y Objectives  
The secondary objectives are to:  
• Assess the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) over 1 year.  
• Assess the Total Numeric -transformed m odified Ashworth S cale score of the most affected 
limb (TNmAS -MAL)  over 1 year.  
• Assess the Expanded Disability Status Scale  (EDSS) over 1 year.  
4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.1 Overall Study Design 
This is a  multicenter,  open- label, long -term extension study to evaluate the safety and tolerability 
of oral AER T in patients with spasticity due to MS .  Subjects from the double- blind study 
(Study  OSS440- 3004) may rollover into this open- label extension study , as well as de novo  
subjects , provided that all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are met.  Eligible de novo  
subject s will undergo a washout period withdrawing  all medications used for anti- spasticity and/or 
muscle relaxation  up to [ADDRESS_141999] .  The omission of a control group is appropriate.  The 
subjects will be selected according to predefined entry criteria from the previous Phase 3, 
randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo -controlled study.  The open- label study treatment 
duration of approximately 1 year is  adequate for chronic exposure.  Nonclinical arbaclofen data 
from a 3 -month rat toxicity study (Study 0460RO24.001) show  margins of  exposure greater than 
[ADDRESS_142000].OS440 -3005.PR.A02.[LOCATION_003]  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 11 of 70 
 supports a dose level of 80 mg.  To date, Osmotica has conducted 11 clinical  studies (Phases 1 
through 3) utilizing AERT in doses up to 80 mg/day in single and divided doses. 
The open -label exten sion study is necessary to obtain safety information about the long -term use 
of AERT at the highest target dose  to treat patients with spasticity due to MS because it is a chronic 
condition. 
5 STUDY POPULATION 
It is anticipated that approx imately 50% of subj ects randomized into the double -blind study 
(Study OSS440-3004) may rollover into this  open- label study .  In addition, [LOCATION_002] ( US) 
subjects who did not participate in Study OS440- 3004 ( i.e., de novo subjects ) may also enroll into 
the current study provided that all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are met.  In total, 
approx imately  [ADDRESS_142001] 100 subjects 
for 6 months, and 50 subjects at 80 mg/day for at least 1 year; however, the sponsor reserves the 
right to end this clinical study after a sufficient number of subjects have enrolled  to complete the 
requirement . 
5.1 Inclusion Criteria

7 STUDY TREATMENTS  
7.1 Treatments Administered  
All subjects will begin treatment with AERT at 40  mg per day (2  x 20 mg) for 3 days , then increase 
to 60 mg per day (3 x 20 mg) for 3 days , and then increase to 80 mg per day ( 4 x 20 mg).  Once 
the subject has reached the maintenance dose,  they will remain on that dose for approximately 
1 year (Figure 2).  The maintenance dose w ill be the highest tolerated dose, not exceeding [ADDRESS_142018].OS440 -3005.PR.A02.[LOCATION_003]  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 70

7.1.1 Treatment Administration  
The study medications will be administered orally twice daily (every 12 hours, or BID) without 
regard to food.  Note:   For the 60 mg/day titration, this means [ADDRESS_142019] tolerability issues due to AERT , they may taper study drug only 
under the guidance of the study site ( i.e., in 20 mg increments per week).  Subjects may 
subsequently attempt study drug taper if the investigator deems this clinically appropriate.  There 
will be no taper phase for subjects who solely achieve a [ADDRESS_142020] misses 7 or more consecutive days  of dosing  AND has taken less than 80% of their 
doses of study medication in a 42- day (6 -week) period, then the subject must be  discontinued ( see 
Section 12.4).  
7.1.[ADDRESS_142021] be stored at 20°C to 25°C (68°F  to 77°F), excursions 
permitted to  between  15°C and 30°C (59°F  to 86°F) (see USP Controlled Room Temperature .  At 
study sites, all study medication must be stored, secured , and locked in a safe place.  
Study OS440 -[ADDRESS_142022] be available for inspection during an audit ( e.g.,

Under no circumstances will the i nvestigator allow the investigational drugs to be used other than 
as directed by [CONTACT_3181].  The study medication must be protected from unauthorized access 
(e.g., in a locked storage facility).  Qualified study personnel must use the specified randomization 
system to a ssign subjects to treatment.  Reasons for digression from the expected dispensing 
regimen must also be recorded. 
At the end of the study , all medication must be reconciled.  Any unused medication will be 
inventoried by [CONTACT_126203]. 
7.[ADDRESS_142023] be protected from unauthorized access ( e.g., in a locked storage facility). 
Any unused, partially used, or empty bottles of study drug will be returned to the Sponsor or 
designee by [CONTACT_76526]’s close -out visit.  Receipt, distribution, and return of the study drug 
must be properly documented on forms provided by [CONTACT_16015]. 
7.4 Method of Assignment of Study Drug  
This is an open- label study and all subjects will begin treatment with AERT at 40  mg per day 
(20 mg BID) for 3 days , then increase to 60 mg per day ( 20 mg in the morning and 2 x 20 mg in 
the evening ) for 3 days , and then increase to 80 mg per day (2 x 20 mg  BID).  Once the subject 
has reached the maintenance dose, they will remain on that dose for approximately [ADDRESS_142024] will be 
allowed to taper the 80- mg/day dose for issues of tolerability on at most three occasions.  If 
tolerability issues persist, the subject will be required to discontinue from the study. 
After Baseline procedures have been completed, authorized site personnel will acknowledge that 
the applicable subject met al l the specified inclusion criteria ( Section 5.1) and none of the exclusion 
criteria ( Section 5.2) and an enrollment number will be sequentially assigned.

 7.6 Emergency Unb linding  
This is a n open- label  study. 
7.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria ( Section 5.1 and 5.2, respectively ) provide details on 
prohibited medications and food and the permitted duration since their last use prior to Baseline 
and/or study drug administration.  For de novo subjects, a ll medications taken within 30 days 
before Baseline are to be recorded in the electronic case report form  (eCRF ).  Eligible de novo  
subjects will undergo an up to 21-day washout period (no drug onboard) for withdrawal of all 
medications used for anti -spasticity and/ or muscle relaxation prior to Baseline (see Inclusion 
Criterion 6).  Any s ubject will be ineligible  for the current open- label study  if they are 
concomitantly us ing any of the medications listed in  Appendix 5 (see Exclusion Criterion 5).   
Table 3 presents the half -life, taper period, and washout period for specific anti -spasticity a nd/or 
muscle relaxation medications.  Tapering of an existing anti -spasticity drug depends on the dose 
of the drug and other conditions.  The investigator should use medical judgment to safely taper the 
dose.  Under most conditions, the taper should take no more than [ADDRESS_142027] the medical monitor for discussions of the 
washout period .

Other than anti -spasticity medications, a ll conventional medications regularly used for the 
treatment of MS  and all non-pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (intended to  alleviate spasticity, e.g., 
physiotherapy) are allowed provided they have been taken/administered for at least [ADDRESS_142028] is receiving disease -modifying medications (especially interferons, see Inclusion 
Criterion 5), study visits should be scheduled prior to administration and, if possible, at a c onsistent 
time point during the study from when these drugs are administered in order to avoid interference 
with the temporary increase in spasticity that these medications may produce.  
Subjects who experience an acute MS exacerbation/relapse (symptoms including but not limited to visual disturbance, dizziness, tingling, or extreme fatigue lasting greater than [ADDRESS_142029] 30 days after a previous relapse) requiring immediate therapy or adjustment in disease- modifying medication dose ( e.g., oral or intravenous high-dose steroid therapy) will be 
discontinued from this study.   
Other medication that is considered necessary for the subject’s safety and well -being may be given 
at the discretion of the investigator.  The administration of all medication (including investigational 
products) will be recorded in the appropriate sections of the eCRF . 
Data collection for concomitant medication s will include information on indication, dose, route, 
dosing frequency, start date, stop date, and will continue throughout the study. The investigator or study staff will ask the subject at every study visit whether they have taken any 
new medications or had changes in their current medications since the last study visit.   It is the 
responsibility of the investigator to ensure that any change in concomitant medications during the 
study is recorded in the source documentation and entered in the eCRF . 
7.[ADDRESS_142030] be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy.  Females of childbearing potential include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical 
sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea >12 consecutive months).  De novo  premenopausal 
women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_142031]; the subject must discuss with the investigator the most 
appropriate form of birth control: 
• Hormonal methods 
o Oral contraceptives  
o Implant 
o Injection  
o Transdermal patch

 o Intravaginal ring  
• Intrauterine device (hormonal or non-hormonal) 
• Barrier methods  
o Condom (male or female) with spermicide  
o Diaphragm with spermicide  
• Complete abstinence  
7.[ADDRESS_142033] compliance will be based on drug accountability information.  Non-compliance will be 
defined as subjects taking less than 80% or more than 120% of prescribed study medication overall 
as assessed by [CONTACT_126204] .  If a subject 
misses 7 or more consecutive days  of dosing  AND has taken less than 80% of their doses of study 
medication in a 42- day (6 -week) period, then the subject must be discontinued. 
[ADDRESS_142034]’s overall status using the following categorical scale:  
• 1 = Very much improved 
• 2 = Much improved 
• 3 = Improved 
• 4 = No change 
• 5 = Minim ally wor se

 When initially developed in the early 1960s (Ashworth 1964) to estimate the efficacy of 
anti-spastic drugs in subjects with MS, i t was a 5 -point scale, with a grade score of 0  to 4.  In 1987, 
the gra de “1+” was added and slight changes were proposed on the definitions of each score in 
order to increase the sensitivity of the measure and facilitate scoring.  The new measure was then 
called the Modified Ashworth Scale  (mAS) and it is considered the gold standard for measuring 
spasticity ( Bohannon and Smith 1987).  
Although there are no standardized guidelines for its use, it can be applied to muscles of both the 
upper or lower body.  The rater should extend the client ’s limb from a position of maximal flexion 
to maximal extension until the first soft resistance is felt.   Moving a subject’s limb through its full 
range of motion should be done within 1 second by [CONTACT_126205] “one thousand and one.” 
It is suggested that the testing  of the upper limbs should take place while the subject is lying supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
with the upper limbs parallel to the trunk, elbows extended, wrists in a neutral position, and the 
lower limbs positioned parallel to one another.  Exceptions are made for the shoulder extensors, 
where the arm should be moved from extension to [ADDRESS_142036] ed limb will be determined by [CONTACT_1275] . 
The TNmAS -MAL  assessment will be done at the visits specified in Table 1.  The mAS and 
TNmAS -MAL are provided in Appendix 1. 
8.3 Expanded Disability Status Scal e 
The EDSS is a method of quantifying disability in MS and monitoring changes in the level of 
disability over time.  It is widely used in clinical trials and in the assessment of people with MS.   
The scale was developed by [CONTACT_126206] 1983 as an advance from his previous 10- step 
Disability Status Scale (DSS)  (Kurtzke 1983).  The EDSS scale ranges from [ADDRESS_142037].OS440 -3005.PR.A02.[LOCATION_003]  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30 of 70 
 EDSS steps 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people with MS wh o are able to walk without any aid and is based 
on measures of impairment in eight functional systems (FS):  pyramidal (weakness or difficulty 
moving limbs), cerebellar (ataxia, loss of coordination, or tremor), brainstem (problems with 
speech, swallowing , and nystagmus), sensory (numbness or loss of sensations), bowel and bladder 
function, visual function, cerebral (or mental) functions , and other.  Each FS is scored on a scale 
of 0 (no disability) to 5 or 6 (more severe disability).  EDSS steps 5.[ADDRESS_142038] results, 
12-lead ECG s, the USP questionnaire, and the C- SSRS  will also be assessed.  
9.1 Medical/Surgical History  
A complete medical and surgical history will be obtained at Baseline (Screening for de novo  
subjects) , which will record previous respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, 
nephron- urologic, metabolic, allergic, infectious, gynecologic,  musculoskeletal, endocrine, 
neurologic, psychiatric, dermatologic , allergi c, hematologic, and any other diseases.

standing position, BP and heart rate will be measured again after the supi[INVESTIGATOR_126191].  
9.3 Physical Examination 
A physical examination will be performed at Baseline (Screening for de novo subjects) and will 
include the following categories :  general , head, ears, eyes, nose and throat , neck,

9.4 Weight and Height 
Weight will be measured at Baseline (Screening for de novo  subjects) , at Visit 4 (Week 2 8), and 
at Visit 8 (Final Visit or Early Termination) .  Height will be measured only at Baseline.  At each 
site the same balance will be used for all measurements.  Subjects will wear only indoor clothing

9.6.2 Urinary Symptom Profile
© Questionnaire  
The USP is a health -related quality of life  questionnaire developed in 2005 by [CONTACT_126208] 2008 ( Haab et al 2008 ).  It is composed of 13 items in 
3 dimensions to assess urinary symptoms among adults (both men and women) with stress, urge, 
overactive bladder, or urinary obstructive symptoms.  It is administered with a time frame over the 
past [ADDRESS_142045]  to complement 
clinical measures and diagnosis due to it being a valid and reliable questionnaire providing 
comprehensive evaluation of all urinary disorders and their severity.  It also allows the pathology 
screening and contributes to the differential diagnosis of these symptoms.  Due to the potential risk 
of arbaclofen to produce urinary problems, mainly at the bladder level  (as seen in some animal 
toxicological studies ; see the current arbaclofen Investigator’s Brochure [IB] ), the utilization of 
this questionnaire has been implemented in the context of this study  to monitor  urinary 
symptomatology  and rule out any complication that could be developed during the course of the 
study.   An increase of [ADDRESS_142046] at the visits specified in  Table 1.  The 
USP is provided in Appendix 6. 
9.6.3 Columbia –Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS will be administered by [CONTACT_1720] a qualified designee trained in its 
administration.   The C -SSRS is a standardized instrument that was developed to assess the severity 
of and monitor changes in suicidal ideation and behavior.  Four constructs are measured.  The first 
is severity of ideation rated on a [ADDRESS_142047].OS440 -3005.PR.A02.[LOCATION_003]  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 of 70 
 comprises 5 items (frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reason for  ideation) each 
rated on a [ADDRESS_142048] is behavior rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, 
aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and non- suicidal self -injurious behavior.  
The fourth is lethality, which asses ses actual attempts; actual lethality is rated on a [ADDRESS_142049] observation or visit, they had any of 
the following: 
• Experienced any changes in well -being. 
• Used any new medications . 
• Changed medication regimens (both prescription and over-the-counter). 
• Were admitted to  a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49198]. 
All questions should be of a general nature and should not suggest symptoms. 
When an AE is suspected, all relevant evaluations will be performed and appropriate treatment 
provided.  Additional follow -up will be done as nec essary ( Section 9.7.4) and recorded in the 
subject’s source documents, and the results will be provided to the Sponsor. 
9.7.2 Adverse Event Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease that appears or worsens in a 
subject after the subject signs the ICF for a clinical study.  
Examples of what may be considered an AE include any of the following: 
• A new illness . 
Study  OS440 -[ADDRESS_142050].OS440 -3005.PR.A02.[LOCATION_003]  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 of 70 
 • An exacerbation of a sign or symptom of an underlying condition or of a concomitant illness 
unrelated to participation in the clinical study or an effect of the study drug or comparator drug . 
No causal relationship with the study drug is implied by [CONTACT_3794] “adverse event.”  An 
exacerbation of a pre- existing condition/illness is defined as a more frequent occurrence or as an 
increase in the severity of the pre- existing condition/illness during the study.  Planned or elective 
surgical procedures for pre -existing conditions that have not worsened are not AEs.  However, any 
complication that occurs during a planned or elective surgery is an AE.  (If the event meets the criteria for a SAE , such as an extended hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it will be considered a n SAE).  Conditions 
leading to unplanned surgical procedures may also be AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is any AE that: 
• Results in death . 
• Is life -threatening . 
Note:   The term “life -threatening” refers to any AE that, as it occurs, puts the subject at 
immediate risk of death.  It does not refer to an AE that hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe.  
• Results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49199] (not including 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition that has not increased in severity or frequ ency from 
the subject’s underlying medical condition prior to entry into the study). 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject 
• Is another serious event (important medical events) 
Note:   Important medical events may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49200], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical  intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity of Adverse Events 
“Severity” of the AE refers to the extent to which an AE affects the subject’s daily activities and differs from “Serious”, which is a regulatory classification.  Severity will be categorized according to the following criteria:  
Study  OS440 -[ADDRESS_142051].OS440 -3005.PR.A02.[LOCATION_003]  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 35 of 70 
 • Mild:   The symptom has a negligible effect or no impairing effect on the subject ’s normal 
function. 
• Moderate:   The symptom impairs the subject’s normal function to some extent. 
• Severe:   The symptom  has an obvious, significantly impairing effect on the subject ’s normal 
function. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Treatments 
“Causality” refers to the relationship of the AE to study drug and will be categorized according to 
the following criteria:  
• Unlikely:   There is no medical evidence to suggest that the AE may be related to study drug 
usage, or there is another more probable medical explanation. 
• Possible:   There is medical evidence to suggest that there is a reasonable possibility that the 
AE ma y be related to study drug usage.  However, other medical explanations cannot be 
excluded as a possible cause.  
• Probable:   There is strong medical evidence to suggest that the AE is related to study drug 
usage.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Expectedness  
Expected AEs are d efined as those described in the  arbaclofen  IB.  If an event increases in intensity 
or severity from that described in the IB, it will be considered unexpected. 
9.7.[ADDRESS_142052] be done by [CONTACT_126209] (SAE form 
or Exposure during Pregnancy form) to the Sponsor.  Any pertinent follow -up information should 
be provided in a similar manner.  Contact [CONTACT_76533]: 
Study  OS440 -[ADDRESS_142053] be withdrawn from 
the study and the Sponsor and site monitor notified.   Additional relevant information about the 
confirmed pregnancy will be recorded on the appropriate form(s); pregnancy will not be captured 
as an AE.  
The subject should be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known. 
9.[ADDRESS_142054] ( DSMB ) will oversee study subject safety with respect to AEs 
and clinically important lab values.  The committee will include three individuals with collective 
experience and knowledge about clinical trial conduct, study subject safety, MS, and bladder dysfunction, a condition common in MS subjects.  DSMB members will be independent of the 
Sponsor, study sites, and the managing vendors, and will have no other role in the trial.  The DSMB will convene after 33%, 66% , and 100% of the trial is enrolled.  The role of the DSMB will be 
governed by a DSMB c harter.  
11 STATISTICAL DESIGN AND ANALYSIS  
11.1 Statistical Analysis Plans  
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) will be finalized prior to study termination . 
Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation [SD], minimum, and maximum for continuous data; frequencies and percentages  for categorical data) will be used to summarize study 
data.  Unless specified otherwise, all statistical testing will be two -sided and performed using a 
significance level of 0.05.  
11.2 Analysis Populations 
The following population will be  defined for analysis: 
• Safety population:  Includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of open- label  study 
treatment and have at least one post -dose visit.  Subjects will be analyzed according to the 
treatment received.  This population will be used for all safety and efficacy  analyses.  
11.3 Determination of Sample Size  
In total, approx imately  300 subjects are to be enrolled in this study  (i.e., both rollover and de novo  
subjects) .  It is anticipated that approx imately 50% of subjects randomized into the double -blind 
study ( Study OS440-3004) may roll over into this  open- label study , and US subjects who did not 
participate in the previous double -blind Study OS440-3004 (i.e., de novo  subjects ) may also enroll 
into the current study.  The number of subjects at each site will be determined primarily by [CONTACT_126210]440-3004.  No statistical rationale for subject number is provided.    
Study  OS440 -[ADDRESS_142055].OS440 -3005.PR.A02.[LOCATION_003]  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 of 70 
 The sponsor has previously completed a 1- year, open- label safety study (Study OS440-3003) at 
the 40- mg p er day dose. In Study O S440-3003 a total of 148 subjects were treated. Study 
OS440- 3005 is designed to enrich the existing safety database and provide long -term safety and 
tolerability data at the maximum daily dose of 80 mg/day.  Target recruitment includes at least [ADDRESS_142056] s treated at 6 months and 50 subjects treated for 1 year at 80 -mg per day. 
11.4 Efficacy Analyses 
11.4.1 Efficacy Endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient Global Impression of Change 
Descriptive summaries  for PGIC scores will be tabulated by [CONTACT_126211].

All reported AEs will be mapped to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ classifications (SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs).  If a s ubject reports multiple events 
of a single PT, the greatest severity and strongest investigator assessment of relationship to study treatment will be assigned to that PT.  Should an event have a missing severity or relationship, it will be classified as ha ving the highest severity and/or strongest relationship to study drug.  
Summaries of treatment- emergent AEs (TEAEs) will include any AEs reported beginning with the 
first dose of study treatment on Day 1.  The occurrence of TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_126214], PTs, and severity.  Separate summaries of treatment -emergent SAEs, TEAEs 
considered related to study treatment, and events leading to the discontinuation of study drug will be generated.  
Descriptive summaries of vital signs, clinical laboratory results , USP results, and the C -SSRS 
results will be presented by [CONTACT_126215].  The number and percentage of 
subjects with treatment- emergent clinical laboratory abnormalities will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_1570].  Normal range clinical laboratory shift s from baseline to end of study will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
Study  OS440 -[ADDRESS_142058].OS440 -3005.PR.A02.[LOCATION_003]  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 70 
 Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) dictionary.  
These data will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Previous and concomitant medications will be presented in a data listing.  
Subject disposition will be presented for all subjects.  The numbers of subjects who complete the study and who discontinue early from the study will be provided.  The reasons for early discontinuation will also be presented. 
11.6 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned. 12 STUDY MANAGEMENT  
12.1 Monitoring  
The investigator will be responsible for preparing and maintaining adequate and accurate source 
documents (medical records, ECGs, raw data collection forms, etc.) designed to record all 
observations and other pertinent data for each subject treated with the study drug.  The investigator 
will allow representatives of the Sponsor, contract designees, authorized regulatory authority inspectors, and the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) to have direct access to all documents pertaining to the study.  The investigator is to immediately notify 
the Sponsor of any regulatory authority inspections.  The investigator will be informed about the 
outcome of any Sponsor audit. 
This study will be monitored regularly, by [CONTACT_76540] a monitor from the Sponsor.  
The frequency of monitoring visits will be agreed upon by [CONTACT_1034]’s representative and the study site.  
Moni toring visits will take place on a regular basis according to the enrollment rate and number 
of subjects enrolled at each investigational site.  During these visits, the monitor will check the completion of the eCRF  entries, compliance with the study protocol and with Good Clinical 
Practice - International Conference on Harmoni zation (GCP -ICH), and their agreement with the 
source data.  The monitor will also verify the correct use of the study drug.  At a final visit, the monitor will check all remaining material including the remaining quantities of the study drug and will organize their return to the Sponsor or designee.  At each visit, the investigator and staff will 
be expected to cooperate with the Sponsor’s representative(s) for the purposes of review and 
verification of protocol compliance, AE reporting, eCRFs, source documents, clinical supplies and inventory records, and any additional records as may have been previously arranged between the investigator and the Sponsor’s representative(s). 
The inves tigator and/or other designated study personnel are expected to contact [CONTACT_126216]/or questions.  Contact [CONTACT_126217].  
12.[ADDRESS_142059].OS440 -3005.PR.A02.[LOCATION_003]  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 70 
 No change to the protocol will be implemented until the Sponsor and the IRB/IEC have reviewed 
and approved the amendment. 
In the event of an emergency, the investigator shall implement any medical procedures deemed 
appropriate for subject safety.  All such procedures must have written documentation and be 
promptly reported to the Sponsor. 
12.3 Protocol Deviations 
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence , or departure from the IRB/IEC approved protocol 
(intentional or unintentional).  Protocol deviations are to be reported to the IRB/IEC  according to 
the IRB/IEC guidelines.  
12.[ADDRESS_142060] 
discontinued prematurely if he/she withdraws prior to completing Visit 8 (Final Visit).  If a subject 
misses 7 consecutive days AND has taken less than 80% of their doses of study medication in a 42-day (6 -week) period, then the subject must be  discontinued.  Subjects may also be withdrawn 
from the study because of any  of the following: 
• Adverse Event:   An AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_94367], suggests that 
continued participation in the study is not in the subject’s best interest for safety reasons (also 
see Section 10).  All AEs that are present when the subject withdraws from the study will be 
followed as described in Section 9.7.4. 
• Medical Condition :  Any medical condition that, in the investigator’s judgment, would 
increase the risk or interfere with the evaluation of study objectives . 
• Lost to Follow- up:  Confirmed at minimum by [CONTACT_126218] a traceable letter without 
answer . 
• Subject Request:   Subject requests for any reason to be withdrawn or withdraws his/her 
consent.  Every effort should be made to determine the reason for the withdrawal request ( e.g., 
AE, lack of efficacy, scheduling issues , etc. ). 
• Protocol Deviation:   A subject may be withdrawn from the study at the discretion of the 
investigator or Sponsor due to poor compliance with protocol requirements that may 
compromise the study results or subject safety. 
• Enrollment in Another Study:   Enrollment in other protocols involving research drugs, 
medical devices , or surgeries . 
• Other Anti -spasticity Treatment:   Starting any other pharmacological anti -spasticity 
treatment during the study. 
Study  OS440 -[ADDRESS_142061].OS440 -3005.PR.A02.[LOCATION_003]  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 70 
 • Relapse:  Subjects who experience an acute MS exacerbation/relapse (symptoms including but 
not limited to visual disturbance, dizziness, tingling, or extreme fatigue lasting greater than 
[ADDRESS_142062] 30 days after a previous re lapse) requiring immediate therapy 
or adjustment in disease -modifying medication dose ( e.g., oral or intravenous high- dose steroid 
therapy).  
• Other:   Other reasons include but are not limited to:  Investigator decision that it is in the 
subject’s best inter est to be withdrawn, administrative reasons, relocation of subject, etc.  If a 
subject or the partner of a subject becomes pregnant during the study, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and followed through conclusion of the pregnancy  (see 
Section  9.7.5). 
When possible, a decision to discontinue a subject from the study should first be discussed with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor.  If a subject is prematurely discontinued after randomization and 
prior to the final scheduled visit, every effort should be made to perform all of the Visit 8 
assessments ( Table 1).  The reason(s) for early withdrawal must be recorded in the eCRF .  Subjects 
withdrawn from the study will not be replaced. 
12.[ADDRESS_142063] of the Sponsor or a regulatory authority, 
with proper and timely notification of all parties concerned.  The IRB/IEC will be informed promptly and the  Sponsor or the investigator will supply reason(s) for the termination or 
suspension, as specified by [CONTACT_1214].  Otherwise, the study is considered terminated upon completion of all subject treatments and evaluations. 
12.[ADDRESS_142064] of the Study  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for 
GCP, 1997; the US Title 21 CFR parts 50, 56, and 312; and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The study will not begin until all of the requirements of the appropriate re gulatory authorities have been fulfilled. 
13.2 Institutional Review Boards and/or Independent Ethics Committees  
This protocol (and any changes), all consent forms, and subject consent procedures must be reviewed and approved by a properly constituted IRB/IEC.  The information presented to the IRB/IEC at the time initial approval is sought must include any plans for subject recruitment that 
Study  OS440 -[ADDRESS_142065] 
relationship.  A letter of  approval issued by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC must be sent to the Sponsor prior to 
initiation of the study.  Any changes made to the protocol must be approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC prior 
to implementation, except where needed to eliminate a potential imminent safety hazard to the 
subject.  In this case, immediate implementation may take place followed by [CONTACT_1744]/IEC approval.  Review and approval by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC for continuation of the study must take place at least once a year.  
13.[ADDRESS_142066] prior to his/her entry into the study ( i.e., before examinations and procedures associ ated 
with selection for the study are initiated).  Each subject will have ample opportunity to ask questions and will be informed about the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any disadvantage and without having to provide reasons for this decision. 
Following this informative discussion, the subject will be asked if he/she is willing to sign a 
statement of informed consent.  Only subjects who voluntarily sign the ICF may enter the study.  The ICF must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1035]/IEC prior to its use. 
The original signed ICF will remain in the investigator’ s files.  The investigator or designee will 
indicate in each subject’s source documents that he/she has informed the subject about the study 
and its procedures, the subject has signed and dated the ICF, and the subject has been given a copy of the signed ICF.  The investigator or designee will inform subjects of any new information that 
may be relevant to the subject ’s willingness to continue in the study.  
13.[ADDRESS_142067] permission to review all study -related documents:   
monitor, auditor, IRB/IEC , and regulatory authorities.  The subject’s identity and study -related 
records will remain confidential throughout the duration of the study data collection and reporting process.  
A unique subject identification code will be assigned to each potential study subject.  The identification code protects the subject’s identity and is used in lieu of the subject’s name [CONTACT_126222].  The data will always maintain the confidentiality of the subject.  
The investigator or designee will review the subject data, which will be referenced using the 
subject identifier.  At the conclusion of the study, the data obtained may be presented to regional 
regulatory authorities but the subject’s identity will not be revealed.  In addition, if any clinical 
data obtained from the study are published in scientific journals or presented at scientific meetings, the subject’s identity will n ot be revealed.  
13.[ADDRESS_142068] maintain essential study documents (protocol and amendments, source 
documentation corresponding to all information contained in the eCRFs, signed ICFs, relevant 
Study  OS440 -[ADDRESS_142069].OS440 -3005.PR.A02.[LOCATION_003]  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 70 
 correspondence, and all other supporting documentation) until at least [ADDRESS_142070] identification codes (subject names and corresponding study numbers) will be retained for this same time period.  Custody of the records may be transferred to another responsible party, acceptable to the Sponsor, who agrees to abide by [CONTACT_126219].  Written notice of transfer must be submitted to the 
Sponsor.  The investigator must contact [CONTACT_48701]. 
13.6 Financing  
Funding for this study will be agreed between the investigator and the Sponsor and will be 
confirmed in writing before the study starts.  
Completion of Financial Disclosure Forms will be required before the study starts.  Any additions 
to the primary site personnel will necessitate the completion of new Financial Disclosure Forms.  This information w ill also be collected at site closure and 1 year after the completion of the study.  
14 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
The Sponsor and investigator will take all steps possible to ensure the accuracy, consistency, 
completeness, and reliability of the data, including participating in an investigator meeting and/or 
site initiation visit, routine site monitoring, review of eCRFs against source documents, and quality control checks. 
In addition, a representative from the Sponsor’s Clinical Quality Assurance Department may 
conduct periodic audits of the study processes, including, but not limited to, auditing the clinical 
site, laboratories, vendors and CROs, the clinical database, and the final study report. 
[ADDRESS_142071] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_126193] e web -based  eCRFs developed through a validated, Electronic 
Records/Electronic Signatures -compliant platform (US Title 21 CFR Part 11).  The Sponsor’s 
Clinical Data Management department or designee will create the eCRFs and corresponding 
clinical database based on the final protocol. 
All site personnel who will be using this system will receive formal training on the system, after 
which each person will be issued a unique username [CONTACT_2383].  Only the person who owns the username [CONTACT_126223].  For data 
security reasons and to be in compliance with regulatory guidelines, usernames and passwords are not transferable.  
The investigator is responsible for all data entered via the remote data capture (RDC ) system 
eCRFs and must confirm the accuracy of the data by [CONTACT_76550] (signing) the eCRFs.  This responsibility includes the timely completion and accuracy of the data entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_126220]440 -[ADDRESS_142072].OS440 -3005.PR.A02.[LOCATION_003]  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44 of 70 
 database ( e.g., clinical laboratory results) by [CONTACT_13610].  The Sponsor will review the 
database to identify data errors or inconsistencies, which will be posted in the RDC system as 
queries for reso lution.  In addition, the Sponsor may make obvious corrections to the data in the 
database ( e.g., obvious errors in dates).

Device Deficiencies
A device deficiency  is inadequacy  of a medical device with respect to its identity , quality , 
durability , reliability , safety , or performance. A device deficiency  may  or may  not be 
associated with patient harm (ie, ADE or SADE); however , not all ADEs or SADEs are due 
to a device deficiency . The Investigator should determine the applicable category listed in the 
Device Deficiency  eCRF for the identified or suspect device deficiency  and report an y patient 
harm separately . Examples of device deficiencies include the following: 
Failure to meet product specifications (eg, incorrect lens power/diameter/base 
curve/color)
Lens/solution cloud y

below and report as applicable:
“Have you had an y health problems since your last study  visit? ”
“Have there been an y changes in the medicines you take since your last study  visit? ”
In addition, changes in any pr otocol -specific parameters and/or questionnair es evaluated 
during the stud y are to be reviewed b y the Investigator . Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter or quest ionnair e response that is 
clinically  relevant, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] I nvestigator , is to be reported as an AE. These 
clinically  relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality . 
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent .Any pre -existing medical conditions or 
signs/sy mptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study  (i.e., before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study  and should be recorded in the subject ’s 
Medical History .
In addition, temporary  lens awareness or visual changes during the fitting process are not 
considered AEs if the Investigator assesses that the sy mptom(s) can reasonably  resolve within 
the anticipated adaptation period. 
For each recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs documentation must include: date of 
occurrence, severity , treatment (if applicable), outcome, and assessments of the seriousness 
and causality . In addition, the I nvestigator must document all device deficiencies reported or 
observed with test and control products on the Device Deficiency  eCRF . The site must submit 
all available information on ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies to the Study  Sponsor 
immediately  as follows:

ADEs or SAEs are documented on the Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device 
Effect eCRF within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness. 
Device deficiencies are documented on the Device Deficiency eCRF within 24 hours 
of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness. 
A printed cop y of the completed Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect 
and/or Device Deficiency eCRF must be included with product returns. Please refer to 
the MOP for further details regarding product returns. 
Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available.  
Document an y changes to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.
Document all relevant information from Discharge Summary , Autopsy  Report,
Certificate of Death etc., if applicable, in narrative section of the Serious Adverse 
Event and Adverse Device Effect eCRF .
Note: Should the EDC system become non -operational, the site must complete the 
appropriate paper Serious Adverse E vent and Adverse Device Ef fectand/or Device 
Deficiency  Form. 
The completed form is emailed to the Study  Sponsor at 
msus.safety @alcon.com according to the timelines outlined above; however , the reported 
informat ion must be entered into the EDC sy stem once it becomes operational.
Any AEs and device deficiencies for non -study  marketed devices/products (i e,CLEAR 
CARE disinfection solution) will be considered and processed as spontaneous (following the 
post-market vigilance procedures) and should be communicated to the device ’s/product ’s 
manufacturer as per local requirements.
Study  Sponsor representatives may  be contact[CONTACT_796753] -related question and their 
contact [CONTACT_706785].
Further , depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency  being reported, the Study  
Sponsor may  request copi[INVESTIGATOR_13271]’ s medical records. The 
Investigator must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory  authorities or I RB/IEC.
Intensity and Causality Assessments
Where appropriate, the Investigator must assess the intensity  (severit y) of the AE based on 
medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:
Alcon - Business Use Only   Effective Date:

Protocol - Clinical
09-Jul-2020
Page 45of 56
Intensity (Severity)
Mild An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily  tolerate the sign or 
symptom.
Moderate An AE is moderate if the sign or s ymptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.
Severe An AE is severe if the sign or sy mptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability  to work or engage in their usual activities.
For every  AE in the study, the Investigator must assess the causalit y (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study  procedure). An assessment of causality  will also be performed 
by [CONTACT_13302], as shown below:
Causality
Related AnAE classified as related may  be either definitely  related or possibl y 
related where a direct cause and ef fect relationship with the medical 
device or stud y procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a 
reasonable possibility  that the AE was caused b y the medical device or 
study  procedure.
Not Related An AE classified as not related may  either be definitely  unrelated or 
simply  unlikel y to be related (ie, there are other more likely causes for the 
AE).
The Study  Sponsor will assess the AEs and may  upgrade the Investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality . The Study  Sponsor will notify  the Investigator of an y AEs that is 
upgraded from non -
serious to serious or from unrelated to related.
Furthermore, the Study  Sponsor shall promptly  conduc t an evaluation of any  unanticipated 
adverse device effect, including anticipated adverse events that occur in unanticipated 
severit y or frequency . The results of this evaluation will be reported to the FDA, the IRB, and 
participating Investigators within [ADDRESS_1099046] information are provided in the MOP  that 
accompanies this protocol.

Alcon products associated with device deficiencies and/o r product related AEs should be 
returned and must include the Complaint # which will be provided by  [CONTACT_13304] ’s Global Product Complaint Management Sy stem 
(GPCMS). 
11.5 Unmask ing of the Study Treatment
Masked information on the identity  of the assigned medical device should not be disclosed 
during the stud y (refer to Section 9.4 T reatment Masking). If the treatment code needs to be 
broken in the interest of subject safet y, the Investigator is encouraged to cont act an 
appropriate Stud y Sponsor representative prior to unmasking the information if there is 
sufficient time. Dependent upon the individual circumstances (i e, medical emergency ), the 
code may  be broken prior to contact [CONTACT_69211] . The Study  Sponsor must be 
informed of all cases in which the code was broken and of the circumstances involved. 
Additionally , the Study  Sponsor may  be required to unmask the information in order to fulfill 
expedited regulatory  reporting requirements.
11.6 Follow -Up of Sub jects with Adverse Events
The Investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study  and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study . 
The Investigator sho uld provide the Study  Sponsor with any  new safet y information (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previousl y reported AEs) that may  affect the safet y 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved/ ongoing at time of subject exit from 
study , any  additional information received at follow - up should be documented in the eCRFs 
up to study  completion (ie, database lock). 
Any additional data received up to [ADDRESS_1099047] be 
documented and available upon the Study  Sponsor ’s request. All complaints received after 
this time period will be considered and processed as spontaneous (following the postmarket 
vigilance procedures) and should be communicated to the medical device ’s manufacturer as 
per local requirements.
The I nvestigator should also report complaints on non- Alcon products directly  to the 
manufacturer as per the manufacturer ’s instructions or local regulatory  requirements.

The study will co nsist of a Baseline visit  (Week  0) which will be the same as Week  52 of the parent study  
12-week ly visits (from Week  8) up to approximately 2 years from the start of the extension study, followed by 
24-weekly visits ther eafter (from Week  104) up until approximately 4  years after t he star t of the study 
(approximately 5  years from the start of the parent study).   
The parent Phase 2 stud y will retain a blind status at the time of the initiation of the extension study 
(double -blind for the PsA study, i.e., only the Sponsor and designa ted contract research organization [ CRO ] 
team members not directly related to the clinical conduct of the study will have been unblinded).  Safety 
assessments will be conducted at the 12 weekly or 24-weekly visits in accordance with the Schedule of 
Assessments.   
All scheduled visits will occur at the study site.  However, s hould unusual circumstances such as public health 
emergency (i.e. pandemic with an infectious agent ) or natural disasters  arise , video conference or 
teleconference between the subject and site investigator will be permitted as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_557026].   In this unusual circumstance, self -injection  made by 
[CONTACT_99840]’s home is allowed in order to guarantee treatm ent continuity.  
When all subjects have  completed the PsA parent Phase [ADDRESS_731539] the option to become    open -label for those subjects.  
Note: the timi ng of switch to an open -label design may differ across the cohorts of  subjects entered, depending  
on the parent study.  If other studies are also included in the long -term extension study, similar considerations 
for maintenance of blind will be necessary.  Those subjects will be entered as separate cohorts and procedures 
such as continued double -dummy dosing regimens will be utilized , even after other parent Phase [ADDRESS_731540] ( IMP), and 
receive clinical care as determined by [CONTACT_737].  
With the exceptio n of those who withdraw informed consent, subjects who withdraw from IMP during the 
long-term extension study  will undergo the E oT assessments approximately [ADDRESS_731541] 
administration of IMP.  Subjects  who complete treatment to Week  200 will r eturn for a Follow -up assessment 
at Week  208 (4 years).  
No independent assessor is needed to assess efficacy measurements.  There will be no efficacy assessments during the LTE study. The Principal Investigator (PI)/designee will be responsible for perform
ing safety 
evaluations.  
Clinic al Adjudication Committee will be established to evaluate cardiovascular events.  
End of study is def ined as the last visit of the 4 -year treatment period (Week  208, EoT/Follow -up) for the last 
global subject.

Inclusion Criteria : 
Subjects may be included in the study if they meet all of the following criteria:  
1. Subject has provided written informed consent for this long- term extension study.  
2. Subjects with PsA who met the inclusion criteria  of the parent stud y and completed the parent study 
treatment period (e.g., up to Week  48 for the parent Phase 2 stud y, with return for the EoT assessment at 
Week 52).  
3. PsA subjects who achieved a 20% reduction from Baseline in American College of Rheumatol ogy 
(ACR) [ADDRESS_731543] has received sufficient clinical benefit, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], to support continued treatment with tildrakizumab.  
This criterion  using response criteria at Week  52 will apply to all s ubjects, including those subjects who 
enter the study from the wash -out phase of  their parent study (after Week  52) due to the timing of study 
site activation of the long -term extension study.   
4. No concomitant use of both leflunomide and methotrexate  simul taneously. 
5. No history of active tuberculosis (TB) or symptoms of TB.  
Exclusion Criteria : 
Subjects should be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:  
1. New onset during the parent study of arthritic conditions other than the subject's original condition.  
2. Female subjects of childbearing potential who do not agree to abstain from heterosexual activity or practice 
a dual method of contraception, for example, a combination of the following: (1) oral contraceptive, depo- progesterone, or intrauterine device; and (2) a barrier method (condom or diaphragm).  Male subjects 
with female partners of childbearing potential who are not using birth control as described above must use a barrier method of contraception (e.g., condom) if not surgically sterile (i.e., vasectomy).  Contraceptive 
methods must be practiced upon entering the study and through [ADDRESS_731544] and/or represents a potential unacceptable risk for the subject.  
6. Subject has an active infection or history of infections as follows:  
− a serious infection, defined as requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_557009]-infectives within [ADDRESS_731545] dos e having been received within 7  days 
of start of the extension study,  
− recurrent or chro nic infections, e.g., chronic pyelonephritis, chronic osteomyelitis, bronchiectasis, or 
other active infection that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], might cause this extension study to be detrimental to the subject.

Amendment 1.0 (Final )  Page [ADDRESS_731574] received in the parent 
study.  The duration of time in the wash -out phase of the parent study prior to entry to the long-
term extension is anticipated to be short, thus enabling continued efficacy assessment across  
the long- term extension study.  
All safety measures are consistent with evaluations used in clinical studies and previous studies with tildrakizumab.  
9.2.1 Risk/Benefit and Ethical Assessment  
This extension study will provide subjects from parent Phase  2 stud y who receive clinical 
benefit from treatment after approximately 1  year, as determined  by [CONTACT_557036][INVESTIGATOR_1649], opportunity to receive continued long- term tildrakizumab treatment for 
up to a further 4 years .  Subjects from other studies may also be eligible for entry to this 
long- term extension study, hence offering  extended use of effective dosing regimens.  
Subjects will only be eligible for continuation into this long -term extension study if they 
complete  the treatment period of the parent study ( Week  48 for parent Phase  2 studies , with 
return for the EoT assessmen t at Week  52), meet defined clinical response criteria and, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], would gain clinical benefit from long- term continuation of 
tildrakizumab.  
The study has also been designed to minimize potential risks to subjects; all subjects will 
undergo Screening procedures at the start  of their parent study aimed at reducing the likelihood 
and impact of any such risks.  In addition, regular safety monitori ng during the treatment period 
of the parent study and this long -term extension study for all subjects will ensure that any 
unanticipated effects of study participation are identified promptly and managed appropriately.  
The design also allows withdrawal o f subjects from tildrakizumab  at the end of the parent study 
(in accordance with the current parent protocol wash -out phase ) and at any time thereafter 
during the extension study if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the subject is no longer obtaining sufficient clinical benefit, thus enabling subjects to receive other treatment in accordance with local clinical practice.  
Overall, based on data from non- clinical and clinical studies of tildrakizumab to date and the 
risk minimization strategies discussed a bove, the risk:benefit profile of the current study is 
considered acceptable.

 9.2.2 Early Termination 
This study may be terminated at any time by [CONTACT_557037], 
if the Investigator does not adhere to the protocol or if, in the Sponsor's judg ment, there are no 
further benefits to be achieved from the study.  In this event, the Sponsor will inform the study 
Investigators, institutions and all regulatory authorities.  
9.3 Selection of Study Population 
9.3.1 Inclusion Criteria  
Subjects may be included in the study if they meet all of the following criteria:  
1. Subject has provided written informed consent for this long- term extension study . 
2. Subjects with PsA who met  the inclusion criteria of the parent  stud y and completed the 
parent study treatment period (e.g., up to Week  48 for the parent Phase  2 stud y, with return

Note: This criterion using response criteria at Week  52 of the parent study will apply to all 
subjects, including those subjects who enter the study from the wash -out phase of their 
parent study (after Week  52) due to the timing of study site activation of the long -term 
extension study.  
4. No concomitant use of both leflunomide and methotrexate, 
5. No history of active tuberculosis ( TB) or symptoms of TB. 
9.3.2 Exclusion Criteria

1. New onset during the parent study of arthritic conditions  other than the subject ’s original 
condition. 
2. Female subjects of childbearing potential who do not agree to abstain from heterosexual 
activity or practice a dual method of contraception, for example,  a combination of the 
following: (1 ) oral contraceptive, depo -progesterone, or intrauterine device; and (2) a 
barrier method (condom or diaphragm).  Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential who are not using birth control as described above must use a barrier method of contraception (e.g., condom) if not surgically sterile (i.e., vasectomy).  Contraceptive

All safety  assessments will be administered  by [CONTACT_83169] /designee.  
Should a situation arise where unblinding is required, the Investigator at that study site may 
perform immediate unblinding via the IVRS without the need for communication with the 
Sponsor.  This can only occur in emergency situatio ns (Section  10.3).  
At the time of the first IA for this extension study , the Phase [ADDRESS_731595] been 
unblinded and hence no considerations of maintenance of blind will be necessary  for those 
cohorts of subjects. 
10.3 Procedure for Breaking the Randomization Code  
Subjects, study site  personnel , persons performing the assessments, and data analysts will 
remain blind to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until such time the 
long-term study can become open- label for the relevant cohort of subjects ( Section  9.1.1). 
Emergency treatment code breaks should only be undertaken when it is essential to treat the 
subject safely and efficaciously.  Most often, IMP discontinuation and knowledge of the 
possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study subject who presents with an emergency condition.  Emergency code breaks are performed using the IVRS.  When the 
Investigator contacts the system to break a treatment c ode for a subject, he/she must provide 
the requested subject identifying information and confirm the necessity to break the treatment 
code for the subject.  The Investigator will then receive details of the IMP for the specified 
subject and a fax or email confirming this information.  The system will automatically inform 
the designated site monitor, medical monitor, and the project m anager that the code has been 
broken, but no treatment assignment will be communicated. 
It is the Investigator’s responsibilit y to ensure that there is a procedure in place to allow access 
to the IVRS in case of emergency.  The Investigator will inform the subject how to contact 
[CONTACT_5657]/her backup in case  of emergency when he/she is unavailable.  The Investigator will provide 
the protocol number, IMP name [CONTACT_90228], subject number, and instructions for contact[CONTACT_557041]   22 Jul 2020

 11 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
The timing and frequency of safety assessments are described in Section  9.1.2 and 
Section  9.1.3. 
11.1 Adverse Events  
The definitions for AEs  and SAEs are provided in Section  11.1.1.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_557014]. 
11.1.1 Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as “any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, 
symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigation) product , 
whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product”. 
Any relevant observations made at the Baseline visit (including laboratory test results, and until 
the ICF is signed ) are to be recorded on the AE eCRF, but will not be considered treatm ent-
emergent AEs (TEAEs) for the long -term extension study, and will be reported separately from 
TEAEs.  A TEAE includes a ny relevant observations  following signing of the ICF  for the 
long˗term extension study , and  will be recorded as an AE in the subject’ s AE eCRF; this 
includes physical examination findings, clinically relevant abnormal vital signs, clinically 
relevant laboratory abnormalities, and clinically relevant ECG findings.  An AE relating to a 
pre˗existing condition or ongoing at the start of the  long- term extension study will only be 
recorded as a TEAE if there is a worsening of the pre -existing condition during the long -term 
study conduct with regard to nature, intens ity or frequency.  
An adverse drug reaction is an “untoward and unintended response to an IMP related to any dose administered”.  
All AEs judged by [CONTACT_96949] a reasonable causal relationship to a medicinal product qualify as adverse drug reactions.  The expression of “reasonable causal relationship” means to convey in general that there are facts or arguments 
which suggest a causal relationship.   Subjects who discontinue the study due to an AE 
considered related to study drug should be followed until the event is resolved, conside red 
stable, or the I nvestigator determines the event is no longer clinically significant. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as, but is not limited to, an event that: 
• Results in death , 

 
Sun Pharma Global FZE   22 Jul 2020  
Tildrakizumab    
 
Protocol CLR_18_07  
Amendment 1.0 (Final )  Page 44 of 74 
 Death is not an AE in itself, but an outcome.  The cause of the death is the AE which 
resulted in death. 
• Is life -threatening , 
Life-threatening means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
SAE; it does not refer to an SAE that hypothetically might have caused death if it had been 
more severe.  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72010] , 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_557015] 1 o vernight formal admission into hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], usually in 
order to perform additional tests, provide treatment which it is not possible to provide at 
home and/or due to an unstable medical condition which requires specific monitoring of 
the subject.  Pre -planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (known already prior to signing the ICF) will not 
be considered an SAE, unless any of the above criteria are fulfilled over  the course of the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216556].  "Social" hospi[INVESTIGATOR_557016].  
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_557017].  If the complication delays subject release from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_557018].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_557019].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity , 
The term significant disability refers to any condition that impairs physical/physiological well-being to the extent that the subject is unable to function normally.  Physical disability 
may include, but is not limited to, permanent disability of locomotion or motility, but also 
systemic permanent dysfunction including heart failure, liver insufficiency or pulmonary 
fibrosis.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect , 
• Is an important medical event. 
Important medical events that ma y not result in death, be life -threatening or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438709], based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or the subject may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The events of severe infections  (defined as any infection meeting the regulatory definition of a 
SAE or requiring intravenous antibiotics whether or not reported as a serious event) , 
malignancies (including non- melanoma and melanoma skin cancer), confirmed Major Adverse 
Cardiovascular Events (MACE), and drug -related hypersen sitivity reactions) will each be

Protocol CLR_18_07  
Amendment 1.0 (Final )  Page [ADDRESS_731599] ( AESI ) for summari zing in this study .  Major 
Adverse Cardiovascular Events include non- fatal stroke, non- fatal myocardial infarction , and 
cardiovascular death.  All MACE events will be evaluated and adjudicated by a CAC 
(Section  12.3.4).  An AESI must be reporte d as if it were an SAE (Section  11.1.2) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Overdose  
A drug overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional use of a drug or medicine or an administration error in an amount that is higher than is normally used.  Every overdose must 
be reported to the designated pharmacovigilance/s afety services within 24 hours of awareness, 
irrespective of whether the overdose was associated with an AE/SAE.  
Overdose in this study is specifically defined as any dose greater than the intended protocol 
dose ( Section  10.1.1).  In case of overdose, it is recommended that the subject be monitored 
for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions or effects and appropriate symptomatic 
treatment be instituted immediately.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Prod uct Quality Complaint  
A product quality complaint (PQC) is related to a potential quality issue during manufacturing, release testing, stability monitoring, dose preparation, storage , or distribution of the product or 
delivery system.  In addition, it includes any reports in which a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_557020]/tampering exists.  It is important to note that not all PQCs involve a subject.  A PQC should be reported within 24 hours, using the details provided in Section  11.1.2. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Planned Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110156] a therapeutic interv ention and not the result of a new SAE and should be recorded as medical history.  If the 
planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_557021], the record in the subject's medical history is considered complete.  However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it must be reported as an AE. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Incident  
A device -related incident is any product complaint that led to or might have led to death or 
serious deterioration of health/serious injury/serious illness for the user of the product or any 
other person.  Note that "device" refers to the for this study.  The incident should be 
reported within 24 hours , using the details provided in Section  11.1.2. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Recording of Adverse Events  
Any relevant observations made before the end of the Baseline visit (prior to signing the ICF  
for this long -term extension study) are to be recorded on the AE eCRF, but will not be 
considered TEAEs and will be reported separatel y from TEAEs.  Any relevant observations

Protocol CLR_18_07  
Amendment 1.0 (Final )  Page [ADDRESS_731600]'s AE eCRF (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
For the purposes of this study, any detrimental change in the subject's condition, after the first 
dose of IMP for the long -term extension study and up to completion of the EoT /Follow -up 
visit, should be considered an AE. 
The following variables  will be recorded for each AE: verbatim/AE description and date for 
AE start and stop, intens ity, seriousness, causality rating, whether or not the AE caused the 
subject to discontinue, and the outcome.  A new AE must be recorded if the intens ity of the AE  
changes.  
All AEs/SAEs have to be reported to the Sponsor, whether or not considered causally related 
to the IMP or to the study procedure(s). 
All ongoing AEs/SAEs should be followed up until resolution or stabilization or the last visit 
if in the Investig ator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the AE is unlikely to resolve due to the subject's underlying 
disease.  
At any time after the subject has taken the first dose of IMP, if an Investigator learns of an SAE that can be reasonably related to IMP, he/she should promptly notify the Sponsor. 
The Investigator will assess the intensity of AEs based on the following definitions: 
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated), 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities) , 
• Severe (incapacitati ng, with inability to perform normal activities) . 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is def ined by [CONTACT_14540]  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea 
that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke 
but would be an SAE. 
For an AE to be a suspected drug -related event, there should be at least a reasonable possibility 
of a causal relationship between the IMP  and the AE. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Causal Assessment  
The relationship of AEs to IMP will be assessed by [CONTACT_737] (Global Introspection 
assessment), and will be a clinical decision based on all available information.

The clinical criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis are as follows:  
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled:  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both 
(e.g. generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, or swollen lips -tongue -uvula)  
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING : 
a) Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g. dyspnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, reduced P EF, or hypoxemia) ,

[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_557023] a contraceptive medication.  If a pregnancy is reported for 
a subject, no further IMP will be administered to this subject and the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth , or congenital abnormality) must 
be followed up and documented.  Follow -up should be performed up to delivery and 
examination of the new -born, after which a follow -up report should be sent with any new 
information regarding the pregnancy and the outcome of the birth. 
All congenital abnormalities/birth defects should be classified as SAEs.  Spontaneous 
miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as SAEs, but should be reported as a follow -up report for 
the pregnancy.  All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor on a Pregnancy Outcomes Report Form.

obtain follow -up information on the outcome until the event is considered resolved, chr onic 
and/or stable. 
If a non -serious AE becomes serious, this and other relevant follow -up information must als o 
be provided to the designated CRO within 24 hours as described above.  The start date of the SAE is not the start date, but the date when the AE becomes serious; analogously, the stop date 
is the date when any seriousness criterion is no longer applicable, not the date when the AE is resolved. 
All SAEs will also be recorded in the eCRF.  The Investigator is responsible for informing the 
Ethics Committee of the SAE as per local requirements.  
Paper SAE forms should be completed at the site and faxed/emailed to the designated 
pharmacovigilance/s afety services or emailed to the global em ail distribution list within 
24 hours of awareness of the event. 
SAE and AESI reports should be sent or faxed to the designated pharmacovigilance/safety 
services  provided in Section  3. 
There may be sit uations when an SAE (or AESI ) has occurred and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial SAE report.  However, it is very important that the Investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event prior to transmission of 
the SAE Report Form.  Minimum criteria are identifiable subject (number), a suspect product (i.e., IMP or concomitant medication), an identifiable reporting source (Investigator/study site 
identification), and an event or outcome that can be identified as serious.  The Investigator may

test, the subject will have IMP stopped and will be withdrawn from the study. 
Pregnancy tests will also be performed whenever 1  menstrual cycle is missed during the 
treatment period (or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected), to confirm the  subject 
has not become pregnant during the study.  Pregnancy tests may also be repeated as per request

11.4 Assessment of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior  
Subjects will be assessed for suicidal ideation and behavior at Baseline ( Section  9.1.1) and each 
subsequent visit using the C -SSRS s ince L ast Visit version.  There are 5  questions relating to 
levels of suicidal ideation which prompt questioning about suicidal behavior or intensity of 
ideation, depending on response.  Subjects acknowledging active thoughts of self -harm but 
lacking an articulated plan f or doing so are classified at the intermediate risk level; those 
presenting a defined self -harm plan or lacking needed impulse control are judged to be at the 
high-risk level.  Subjects  who develop suicidal ideation during the study rated as high- risk 
according to the above classification must be temporarily discontinued from receiving IMP and 
referred promptly for psychiatric evaluation.  Subjects rated as displaying the intermediate level of suicidal ideation should receive psychological support and be assessed on an individual 
basis.  All individuals assessed as exhibiting suicidal behavior, except preparatory acts, must discontinue IMP permanently.  The presence of non- suicidal self -injurious behavior should be 
assessed on an individual basis.

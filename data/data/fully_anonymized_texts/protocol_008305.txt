 3 INTRODUCTION  
3.1 Study B ackground 
Physiologic al skin aging is multi factorial and result s from both intrinsic and extrinsic factors.  
Genetics  is one example of an i ntrinsic factor;  others include hormone and metabolic processes 
that can cause the skin to age.  Exposure to chronic light , radiation, pollution, chemicals and 
toxins , are examples of extrinsic factors. Since skin health and beauty is contemplated as one of 
the representation s of overall “well -being” and “health”, several anti -aging therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541366]. The goal of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541367] a healthy, smooth, 
blemish -free, translucent and resilient skin . [1] 
Skin resurfacing or peel procedures have become an established non- surgical method for reducing 
certain skin imperfections such as wrinkles, rhytides, dark spots, scars, or blemishes.  Traditional 
fully ablative and fractional lasers are the most commonly used devices for skin resurfacing.  
The skin is composed of three layers:  the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196], the dermis, and the hypodermis.  The dermis contains well -organized and oriented collagen fibers that contribute to the firmness and 
smoothness of the skin.  As people age, these collagen fibers reduce in number and become less organized, resulting in sagging and/or wrinkled skin. When esthetic procedures are scheduled for  
older adults , the rate of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_541368] a slower wound healing and less 
effective desquamation  (shading of outer layers of the skin) , needs to be taken into 
consideration .
[1]  
In most skin resurfacing procedures, an energy source (heat, radiofrequency energy, etc.) is used to selectively damage the skin and prompt a healing response that stimulates the growth of new collagen fibers in the dermis that are well- organized.  The healing response and new collagen 
formation results in skin that is smoother and firmer.    
There are numerous traditional fully ablative and fractional lasers on the market today used for skin resurfacing.  Traditional and fractional lasers differ in their method of treatment.  Traditional 
lasers have a single beam that burns or damages all of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_541369]. Fractional lasers divide the beam into multiple smaller beams and treat only a “fraction” of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_541370]. Thi s results in multiple small 
cores of laser damage surrounded by [CONTACT_541397].  When compared to traditional lasers, fractional lasers deliver a more superficial treatment resulting in less risk for complications and reduced time for h ealing. However, this also means more treatments may be required to achieve 
the desired results especially in areas of deep lines or wrinkles.  Healing times vary by [CONTACT_541398], but fractional laser recovery time is typi[INVESTIGATOR_541371]. 
In the wake of the demonstrated safety and effectiveness  of laser skin resurfacing, multiple 
additional treatment modalities have been developed for this application including the use of radiofrequency (RF) energy. The  fractionated radiofrequency results in epi[INVESTIGATOR_541372] a fractional 
CO 2 laser with dermal heating, seen in the non -ablative lasers and devices.[2] The combination of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_541373], called sublative resurfacing in some 
studies, is suitable for skin types I –IV, for the treatment of skin laxity, wrinkles, enlarged pores, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_80436], acne, telangiectasias, and scar ring from trauma or a cne. Subject recovery and

 down time periods are significantly lower when compared with ablative laser healing times, with 
minimal adverse effects.[3] 
3.[ADDRESS_705872] on 
the skin through the use of positively ionized gasses is plasma skin resurfacing (PSR).[4] As this 
plasma comes in contact [CONTACT_541399], the positive ions capture back electrons while energy is released. With PSR, an inert  gaseous source is used to form a plasma that releases 
thermal energy that eliminates oxygen from the targeted skin surface.
 [5,6] PSR  is not dependent 
on a chromophore for its use and does not vaporize tissue as ablative lasers do. This resurfacing modalit y has been hypothesized to function by [CONTACT_12789] a layer of desiccated epi[INVESTIGATOR_541374] 
a natural barrier that facilitates accelerated healing with generation of new epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]. PSR also penetrates to the upper dermis resulting in thermal denaturation of su rrounding collagen, thereby 
[CONTACT_541400], which has been shown to continue up to a year after the plasma treatments.
[7] Plasma resurfacing has been safely used in Fitzpatrick skin types I –IV. It has been 
approved for the treatment of many skin conditions including photoaging, acne scars, rhytides, dyschromias, skin laxity, as well as the treatment of actinic keratosis and seborrheic keratosis. In contrast to the ablative laser, plasma resurfacing treatments have a very low incidence of side effects such as permanent hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], scarring, or prolonged erythema.
[8] 
As an alternative treatment modality  for skin resurfacing , Apyx Medical Corporation has 
developed the Renuvion® Dermal System that delivers RF energy in a controlled fashion  with 
similar depth of thermal effect as predicate devices currently on the market for dermal resurfacing and wrinkle reduction procedures . 
[9,10,11] A po tential benefit of this single -treatment low-risk 
technology is reducing wrinkle appearance and enhancing well-being by [CONTACT_541401] a more youthful appearance. 
3.3 Study Device Description  
The Renuvion® Dermal S ystem consists of an electrosurgical generator unit (ESU , Figure 1), a  
handpi[INVESTIGATOR_541375] (Figure 2) , and a supply of helium gas.  RF energy is 
delivered to the handpi[INVESTIGATOR_506997].  When helium gas is passed over the energized electrode, a helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to the subject  in the form of a precise helium plasma beam.

Apyx Medical Corporation’s Renuvion® helium- based plasma technology has received FDA 
clearance (K112233, K151325, K152570, and K170188) for the cutting, coagulation, and ablation 
of soft tissue.   
Pre-clinical studies comparing Renuvion (formerly known as J-Plasma®) to other energy sources 
such as CO 2 laser and RF energy demonstrated less or comparable lateral and depth of thermal 
spread for Renuvion® in porcine peritoneum, bladder, and small intestine .[12]   
Additionally, a pre -clinical study comparing Renuvion to the NeoGen PSR System (K132754) 
when ablating/resurfacing the skin in a naive swine model  was conducted.  A single  animal w as 
utilized in the study to evaluate both devices at an acute time point.  At the treatment settings used 
in this study, the maximum depth of thermal effect mea sured for tissue treated using the 
Renuvion® System were statistically equivalent to or lower than the maximum depth of thermal 
effect for tissue treated using the NeoGen PSR System.  These results support the safety of 
Renuvion® for this application and e quivalent tissue effects for the two technologies . 
These pre -clinical study results demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the Renuvion® Dermal 
System in the ablation of soft tissue within its current FDA cleared indications  in an animal model , 
therefore making the Renuvion® Dermal S ystem a viable technology for dermal skin resurfacing.

with child -bearing potential (one at pre -procedure screening and one on the day of the procedure  
prior to the procedure . Screening and procedure will not be performed on the same day) .  
Additionally, photogr aphs of the area to be treated with the study device will be taken using the 
Canfield Scientific Visia -CR system (see also Section 12.3 Data Management Responsibilities 
and Section 12.4 Data Capture Methods) for each subject  to document the appearance of t heir 
facial wrinkles and rhytides. The same standardized photography views will be used throughout 
the study a s documented in the Canfield User Manual  document  developed for the study . Subjects 
will specifically be instructed to lightly rest their chin on the chinrest  rather than resting heavily 
and distorting the chin appearance.  
All screening images will be reviewed by [CONTACT_541405].  
The study subject s may be given medication for the prophylactic treatment of bacterial and viral 
infections including herpes simplex based on investigator’s discretion ; allowed medications 
include:  
• Antibiotics: Keflex 500mg BID (first dose just prior, with in 90 minutes, to procedure) x 
7 days. Alternative, Z -pack.  
• Antivirals: Acyclovir 400mg BID (start 1 day prior and continue for 10 days). Alternative, 
Valtrex 1 gram every day for 10 days (start 1 day prior).  
• Antifungals: Diflucan 150mg (1 day prior).  
 
Renuvion Dermal Resurfacing Study, VP -1909, Rev. No. [ADDRESS_705886] is taking  upon entry into the study should also be documented in the C ase 
Report F orms (CRF ). Documentation should include medications  and supplements  that study 
subjects take on an elective basis in addition to prescribed medications . Medication used for 
analgesia and/or anesthesia should  be recorded as concomitant medication as well. To ensure the 
capture of the foregoing information on pre -existing conditions, sites should also be attentive to 
the need to document without limitation and whenever discovered: (1) all chronic, epi[INVESTIGATOR_95817] ‘as  
needed’ medications used before study enrollment; (2) prior epi[INVESTIGATOR_95817] ‘as needed’  therapeutic 
interventions, procedures or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]; and, (3) recent or planned surgical procedures.  
6.[ADDRESS_705887] (result must be obtained prior to the procedure).  
Additionally, subjects must complete a VAS pa in assessment pre- procedure and immediately 
following the procedure  (within 60 minutes after the procedure).   
Prior to study treatment, the following medications may be administered  at investigator’s 
discretion:  
• Ativan 2mg or Valium 10 -20mg. 
• Norco 5-10mg or Ultram 200mg. 
 
A responsible driver (friend  or family member) is required if these medications are prescribed.  
The skin in the treatment area will be prepped by [CONTACT_100411][INVESTIGATOR_541377] 70% isopropyl alcohol, then cleaned with 0.012 % Hypochlorous Acid, then the entire area will be wiped clean with sterile 
saline.  
Facial Nerve Blocks will be done prior to infiltration of tumescent anesthesia to the ophthalmic nerve (v1), the maxillary nerve (V2), and the mandibular nerve (V3) using 1% -2% lidocaine with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:100,000). 
Regional blocks and local tumescent anesthesia (an anesthetic) will be used during the study 
procedure.  The local anesthetic is commonly referred to as Klein’s Solution. Per standard of care, 
this Klein’s Solution is prepared at the time of use and contains USP injection  grade saline 
solution, USP injection grade Lidocaine for pain, and injection grade Epi[INVESTIGATOR_541378]. A 0.2% concentration ( double Klein solution) will be utilized in this study. The 
Tumescent solution is made by [CONTACT_541406] 500 cc of normal saline:  
1. 50cc of 2% Lidocaine = to 1000mg  
2. 0.5cc of 1 mg/ml Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:1000) 
 Tumescent local and regional anesthesia will be injected percutaneously infused with a 22 Gauge  
spi[INVESTIGATOR_13911].  The  total volume of tumescent used should be between 250 – 500cc for the entire 
treatment area at  investigator’s discretion and will be documented in the CRFs.  
 Polycarbonate plastic eye shields will be used as per product IFU  during study treatment . 
Numbing eye drops may be used to place eye shields at investigator’s discretion.  
Renuvion Dermal Resurfacing Study, VP -1909, Rev. No. [ADDRESS_705888] will be treated by [CONTACT_541407] (IFU; see Appendix F) and procedures described in this section. The face will be divided i nto 6 zones: Zone 1 (perioral), 
Zone 2 (periorbital), Zone 3 (forehead), Zone 4 (nose), Zone 5 (cheeks), and Zone 6 (jawline/mandibular border) – see Appendix G: Facial Zones.    The plasma beam will be used to ablate the tissue in each Zone using a consis tent movement of 
the beam. Zones 1, 3, 4, and 5 (perioral, forehead, nose, and cheeks, respectively ) will be treated 
with two (2)  passes of the plasma beam  at 40% power and 4 liters/minute helium flow  utilizing 
the appropriate standoff  with one pass done horizontally and the other pass done perpendicular .  
Zone 2 (periorbital) will be treated with one (1) or two (2) passes, 20% power, and 4 liters/minute helium flow utilizing the appropriate standoff with up to 2 passes done horizontally or only in one direction. Zone 6 (jawline/mandibular border) will be treated with one (1) or two (2) passes, based 
on the investigator’s discretion, at 20% - 40% power and 4 liters/minute helium flow  using the 
appropriate standof f and a t reatment pattern in a variable motion to achieve blending.  Special 
care must be taken to not pass over any treated area more than twice .  Areas that are treated with 
1 pass (optional for Zone 2 and/or Zone 6) are not wiped after the pass. For areas that will be treated with a [ADDRESS_705889] following 2nd pass .

7 EVALUATION TOOLS  
The following evaluation tools will be used in this study: 
7.1 Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scale (FST) 
Assessment of subject ’s skin color will be determined prior to study proce dure by [CONTACT_541409] .  The scale delineates skin color into the categories as shown in Table 2.  
 Table 2: Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scale (FST) 
Table 2: Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scale Evaluation  
Skin Type  Description  
Type I  White skin that never tans and always burns easily  
Type II  White skin that tans slightly and always burns easily  
Type III  Light brown skin that tans gradually and can burn moderately  
Type IV  Moderately brown skin that tans well and burns slightly  
Type V  Dark brown skin that tans profusely and burns rarely  
Type VI  Black skin with deep pi[INVESTIGATOR_541381]   
7.2 Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis Scale (FWS)  
Assessment of each subject ’s wrinkles at baseline and 30, 90, and 180- day follow- up visits will 
be performed by [CONTACT_737] . As well,  assessment of each subject ’s baseline and the 90-day 
follow -up visit images viewed simultaneously will be performed by [CONTACT_541410] -certified 
dermatologists  or plastic surgeons  sourced and managed by [CONTACT_541411] , 
called Independent Photographic Reviewers (IPRs), using the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis  
Scale ( FWS ) categories as shown in Table 3 (see also Section 12.3 Data  Management 
Responsibilities and Section 12.4 Data Capture Methods) . The FWS is a clinically validated 
Renuvion Dermal Resurfacing Study, VP -1909, Rev. No. [ADDRESS_705898] ’s visit (baseline and follow -up visit) and will perform photographic 
assessments of each subject ’s wrinkle depth in the treated zones (identified only as “Zones to 
Evaluate” to the IPRs) using FWS  and ignoring nasolabial folds  and marionette lines  (effects of 
gravity) , and artifacts from the chin rest.  The IPRs will assign a single FWS score per subject for 
both the right and left photo. Each photograph will have a unique identif ication number but  sets 
of images will not be arranged in any specific order  (i.e., randomized order). 
 
Independent Photographic Review Evaluation Process for FWS: 
1. Each blinded assessor will be provided with identical photos to be assessed.  The pre-
treatment and follow -up photos will be consistent in lighting, subject positioning and 
focus.  Each photo’s visit interval, i.e., pre -treatment and follow -up, will NOT be marked. 
The images placement (right or left) will be randomly ordered for pre -treatment and 
follow -up images. Images for each subject will be grouped together into one set with all 
pre-treatment and follow -up images in the same location (right/left) for the subject set.  
2. Each blinded assessor will conduct their assessment independently with no input from 
another blinded assessor.  
3. Each blinded assessor reviews  the Left photo and assigns a FWS score.  
4. Each blinded assessor reviews the Right photo and assigns a FWS score.  
5. Enough time should be allowed to do this for each image , so the assessments are not 
rushed. 
6. The change between FWS scores will be calculated during data analysis after assessments are complete.  
7. Success will be determined by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_705899] two out 
of three blinded, independent reviewers.

(individual papules with yellow translucency under direct lighting) 
and dyschromia . 
III Fine to deep wrinkles, numerous lines , with or without 
redundant skin folds 7-9 Severe: Multipapular and confluent 
elastosis (thickened, yellow and pallid) approaching or consistent with 
cutis rhomboidalis .

 7.3 Modified Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale  (GAIS)  
The Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) is a subjective rating of improvement in 
treatment results compared to pre -treatment.  A modification of the GAIS to include “much 
worse” and “very much worse” as rating options  will be used i n this study .  The Investigator will 
grade  the overall improveme nt of treatment area as indicated in Table 4a by [CONTACT_58281] ’s appearance at follow -up visits against a photograph taken prior to procedure .  Likewise, 
the subject  will also rate their improvement compared to pre -treatment  as shown in Table 4b.   
 
The modified GAIS results will be collected at the 30, 90, and 180- day follow -up visits .

following study procedure (assessed at the 1, 6, 10 , and 30-day follow- up visit) . 
7.5 Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 
The s tudy subject s will be asked to complete an 11-point Visual Analog Scale (VAS)  for the 
following assessments:  
1. Level of pain and discomfort associated with study procedure – to be completed by [CONTACT_1560] s on the day of the procedure (prior to the procedure and immediately following  
the procedure) , daily between the date of the procedure (reported at home) and the [ADDRESS_705901] satisfaction with treatment – at the [ADDRESS_705902] s will be asked 
if they would recommend the treatment to friends and acquaintances (yes, perhaps, or no)  
and improvements noted (if any).  
 
Scoring for the VAS will consist of making a mark on a [ADDRESS_705903] Diary  
Study subjects will be asked to complete a daily diary (see Appendix E: Subject Diary) starting 
from the procedure date (after study procedure , at home ) until the [ADDRESS_705904]’s baseline and 90- day follow -up images viewed simultaneously will 
be performed by [CONTACT_148115]  (IPR)  who will be blinded to the study 
subject’s visit (baseline and 3 -month follow -up visit).  Each IPR will view each subject’s 
randomized baseline and 90-day follow -up images and assess which set of images represent the 
subject’s post -treatment images. Each photograph will have a unique identification number, but 
the sets of images will not be arranged in any specific order  (i.e., randomized order). 
 Independent Photographic Review Evaluation Process for Masked Assessment : 
1. Each blinded assessor will be provided with identical photos to be assessed.  The pre -
treatment and follow -up photos will be consistent in lighting, subject positioning and 
focus.  Each photo’s visit interval, i.e., pre- treatment and follow -up, will NOT be marked. 
The images placement (right or left) will be randomly ordered for pre -treatment and 
follow -up images. Images for each subject will be grouped together into one set with all 
pre-treatment and follow -up images in the same location (right/left) for the subject set.  
Renuvion Dermal Resurfacing Study, VP -1909, Rev. No. [ADDRESS_705905], so the assessments are not rushed.  
4. The following definition will be used: 
• Change: An improvement that is:  
o Striking, substantial and immediately noticeable, or  
o Readily apparent but modest in nature, or  
o Slight and subtle in nature; may require close examination.  
5. The assessor chooses which photo they believe to be the Post treatment photo (i.e., Left photo or Right photo) once all images in the subject set have been reviewed.  
6. Post-Analysis Coding of Masked Assessment:  
• If the assessor incorrectly chooses the Post treatment photo, this will be coded as an “Incorrect post selection”.  
• If the assessor correctly chooses the Post treatment photo, this will be coded as a 
“Correct post selection”.  
7. Success will be determined by [CONTACT_541412] -up visit 
photographs by [CONTACT_478224], independent reviewers.  
 
[ADDRESS_705906] for cause or relation to device and/or procedure.  
 
In addition, study subject s will be instructed to report all of complications experienced post study 
procedure to the site personnel as soon as they occur/ are observed.                                                                                                                                                      
 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to determine seriousness, severity, and relatedness of the 
Adverse Event to the device and procedure using the definitions below. 
8.2 Adverse Event (AE) and Expected Treatment Effect (ETE) Definition  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject , 
including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the subject ’s participation in the research,  
whether or not considered related to the subject ’s participation in the research. An expected 
treatment effect (ETE) is any typi[INVESTIGATOR_453390] -effect of the Renuvion Dermal System 
Renuvion Dermal Resurfacing Study, VP -1909, Rev. No. [ADDRESS_705907] 
of this trial.  
 A preexisting condition (one that is present at the start of the study) will be recorded as an AE 
only if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.   
 
Neither the c ondition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an 
AE in the following circumstances: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_541384] a preexisting condition. Surgery should not be reported as an 
outcome of an AE if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was 
uneventful.  
8.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Definition  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is an adverse event that:  
• Led to a death or  
• Led to a serious deterioration in the health of a subject that:  
o Resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury,  
o Resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or body function,  
o Required in -patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
o Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent impairment to body structure or 
a body function 
o Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect, or    
o Other  serious (important) medical events that may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent on of the other outcomes.  
 All SAEs that occur during the study period, whether considered to be related to the investigational product or not , must be reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_705908] (UADEs) Definition  
An unanticipated adverse device effect  (UADEs)  is defined as any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life- threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in na ture, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.   
In addition, any UADEs  will be reported to the Sponsor and the reviewing IRB as soon as 
possible, but no later than within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.   
All adverse events, anticipated or unanticipated, will be monitored until they are adequately 
resolved or explained.    
8.5 Reporting Requirements  
All advers e events (AEs) obser ved by [CONTACT_62444] s, investigators or other study staff from first 
exposure to the study product through last study follow -up visit will be recorded. If a device -
related AE, SAE, or unanticipated serious device related effect is ongoing at the final study visit, 
Renuvion Dermal Resurfacing Study, VP -1909, Rev. No. [ADDRESS_705909] to follow -up. The investigator should make every effort 
to ensure that follow -up incl udes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to 
elucidate, as completely as practical, the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. This may 
include unscheduled follow up visits for AE assessment.  
Study subject s will be instructed to report all AEs to the clinical study staff.  AE information will 
be collected throughout the study and  recorded on CRFs.  
8.6 Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of adverse events will be categorized using the following criteria:  
• Mild: easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423] , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with 
everyday activities. These events generally do not require treatment.  
• Moderate:  sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.  These 
vents are usually relieved by [CONTACT_14212].  
• Severe:   prevents normal, everyday activities.  These events may require systemic drug 
therapy or other medical treatment.  
8.7 Relationship to the Study Device and/or Procedure  
The relationship to the study de vice and /or procedure will be determined by [CONTACT_148132]:  
 
• Not Related: An event for which an alternative explanation is conclusively identified –  
e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), and/or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is highly unlikely.  
 
• Related : The adverse event follows a reasonable temporal sequence related to treatment 
by [CONTACT_8121], follows a known or suspected response pattern and a plausible alternative etiology cannot be identified.  
 
• Undetermined : The relation of the adverse event has some temporal relationship  to the 
device  and/or device procedure , is not clearly due to another condition and the 
involvement of the study device is unknown.

 9 RISK AND BENEFITS  
9.1 Benefits  
A possible benefit of using the Renuvion Dermal System  is the potential for improvement in 
wrinkle severity.  Additional potential benefits of improving the appearance of wrinkles could 
include enhanced well -being, with improved satisfaction with the appearance of less facial 
wrinkles or the perception of a h aving a more youthful appearance.  
9.2 Risks  
The following are expected treatment effects (ETE) with the Renuvion Dermal System:  
• Pain & tenderness immediately after the procedure, decreasing substantially by [ADDRESS_705910]-procedure ; and  
• Erythema, swelling, induration (crusting) and/or urticaria  (itching) persis ting 
approximately 7- 14 days . 
• Pin-point bleeding during reepi[INVESTIGATOR_541385] 14 days. 
• Temporary post -inflammatory hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_541386] 90 days , 
Potential risks with the Renuvion Dermal System  are similar to those that are encountered for 
many routine facial soft tissue reduc tions.  These include but are not limited to:  
• pain,  
• tenderness,  
• itching,  
• bleeding,  
• bruising/ hematoma/seroma,

liver failure .  
Renuvion Dermal Resurfacing Study, VP -1909, Rev. No. 5  May 11, 2020  
Confidential    Page 41 of 84 
 Individuals allergic to NSAIDs may experience shortness of breath  after taking 
an NSAID and may experience a similar reaction when other NSAIDs are 
taken.  
People with asthma are at higher risk for experiencing serious allergic 
reactions to NSAIDs.  
NSAIDs (except aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) may increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke , and 
related conditions, which can be fatal. This risk may increase with duration of use and in patients who have underlying risk factors for disease of the heart 
and blood vessels.  
NSAIDs, particularly non -selective NSAIDs, cause an increased risk of 
serious, even fatal, stomach and intestinal adverse reactions such as bleeding, 
ulcers, and perforation of the stomach or intestines. These events can occur at 
any time during treatment and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients are 
at greater risk for these types of reaction.

The full analysis dataset will be used in our main analyses.  
 
Full Analysis Dataset  (Intent -to-Treat Sample, ITT) 
Participants enrolled in the study who had baseline photographs taken will be included. 
Those with missing data items at 90-day visit will be  imputed using multiple imputation . 
The primary efficacy endpoints will use this data set.   The primary safety endpoint will 
also use this data set, but without multiple imputation.  The reason is that the analysis 
method takes into account missing data (see the Analysis section below).  
 
Modified Analysis Dataset s (modified Intent- to-Treat Samples, mITT ) 
Participants enrolled in the study who had baseline data and endpoint data will be included. No imputation will be done for missing endpoints unless there is evidence that the endpoint is missing for cause. The Secondary and Additional  endpoints will use these 
datasets.  The reason that there are more than one mITT data set is that the data set is 
dependent upon the endpoint in questions; only those subjects with baseline and endpoint data for that endpoint  will be included in the analysis. 
 
Per Protocol Dataset  (Per-Protocol Sample , PP) 
This will be a subse t of the full analysis dataset comprising participants without major 
protocol deviations. Participants with major protocol deviations will be identified at the data review meeting that takes place before database lock. If the primary effectiveness 
endpoint is not met, it will be repeated on the PP data set. 
11.3 Other Data Issues  
11.3.1  Discontinuations and Missing Data  
The primary endpoints will be tested or estimated using the full (ITT) sample, with  
missing endpoints will be multiply imputed. Secondary and Additional endpoints will use the mITT data sets.  
11.4 Safety Endpoints  
An interim safety report of 30 -day safety data including analysis of treatment data, adverse 
events, and pain scores will be completed.

90-day visit after treatment.  Each AE will be c ategorized by [CONTACT_102950], severity, seriousness, and 
relatedness to the procedure, the device, and the therapy.  
11.4.2  Secondary Safety Endpoint  
The secondary safety endpoint is the evaluation of the change in pain and discomfort after 
treatment (baseline, within 60 minutes following the procedure) experienced in the period up to the 10- day follow -up visit.  Pain or discomfort will be recorded daily by [CONTACT_541395] a 
diary using an 11- point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).  
11.[ADDRESS_705923] three change scores; if [ADDRESS_705924] will be considered a success (Y or 1) and if [ADDRESS_705925] will be considered a failure (N or 0). 
11.6 Additional Endpoints  
Other endpoints to be evaluated include: 
 
1. Whether or not (Yes/No) at least 2 out of 3 blinded Independent Photographic Reviewers (IPRs) correctly identify the 90-day image of a subject from the pair of baseline and 90-day images .  
2. Magnitude of improvement measured by [CONTACT_541403] 90-day visit as determined by [CONTACT_32366]. 
3. Subject modified GAIS at 90-day FUV.  
4. Investigator modified GAIS at 90- day FUV.  
5. Subject satisfaction with procedure recorded at the 90-day visit.  
6. Achievement of re -epi[INVESTIGATOR_541376] 
[ADDRESS_705926].  
11.7 Statistical Analysis of Safety Endpoints  
All statistical analyses will be described in detail in an accompanying statistical analysis plan (SAP).   
 
Primary Safety Endpoint 
Adverse event  rates will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier time -to-event analyses.  The monthly 
event rates and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be  reported by [CONTACT_541414], severity, and 
relationship to the study procedure, device, and therapy. 
Renuvion Dermal Resurfacing Study, VP -1909, Rev. No. 5  May 11, 2020  
Confidential    Page 48 of 84 
  
Secondary Safety Endpoint 
The mean VAS score will be reported at each measurement along with it 95% CI, its SD and its 
minimum and maximum.  The change from baseline will be similarly reported.     
11.8 Statistical Analysis of the Effectiveness Endpoint  
All statistical analyses will be described in detail in an accompanying statistical analysis plan (SAP).   
 
For the primary effectiveness endpoint, the proportion of successful patients (P) will be tested against the PG. If the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the proportion of subject achieving treatment successes is greater than the Performance Goal, the effectiveness endpoint would be met. The statistical test will be a one- sided Fisher’s Exact Test  at α = 0.05.  For the 
effectiveness endpoint to be met, Ho must be rejected.  
 
Ho:  P < 50%      vs.    Ha:  P > 50%  
 
11.9 Statistical Analysis of Additional Endpoints  
These analyses will be described in the accompanying SAP.  
11.10 Subgroup Analysis 
Subgroup analyses will include modeling (using linear regression analysis) the effect of on age, 
gender, race/ethnicity, and Fitzpatrick Skin Scale (FSS) on the ∆FWS . (Age et al are called 
“independent variables”.)  The goal is to determine whether certain types of subjects are more 
likely to have a better response than other types.  If any of the independent variables are significant , the effect size and better responders will be reported.  This is examined in greater 
depth in the SAP.

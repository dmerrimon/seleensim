Protocol #: [ADDRESS_958816] Title:  Validation Study of the WatchPAT 200 in the Diagnosis of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Children 4- 12 Years of A ge
 
 Principal Investigator:   [INVESTIGATOR_705503] -King, MD   
 
Version Date:  01Jun2017        
 
I. Hypotheses :  
 
We hypothesize that the WatchPAT
TM 200U (Peripheral arterial tonometry recorder; Itamar 
Medical, Caesarea, Israel), which is a wrist worn, non- invasive, ambulatory sleep recorder device 
based on peripheral arterial tone (PAT) signal, pulse rate, actigraphy and pulse oximetry will be able to detect obstructive sleep apnea in children 4 to 12 years of age as effectively as an overnight, attended, in- laboratory polysomnogram.  
  
Our Specific Aims:  
1. To evaluate the accuracy of the WatchPAT  200 device compared to an in- laboratory 
polysomnogram  (PSG)  in detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) through measurement of 
the peripheral arterial tone apnea hypopnea index ( PAHI) in children 4- 12 years of age who 
are referred to the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20161] (CHCO) sleep lab for a diagnostic PSG  due 
to concerns for possible OSA.  
2. To evaluate the diagnostic agreement of the WatchPAT  200 d evice in detecting between 
normal sleep and mild ( > 2 events per hour ) versus moderate to severe obstructive sleep 
apnea (OAHI of > 5 events per hour) in children 4- 12 years of age compared to an in-
laboratory  PSG .  
3. To evaluate the accuracy of the WatchPAT  200 device in measuring other parameters such 
as the PAT Respi[INVESTIGATOR_285556] (PRDI),  oxygen desaturation index (ODI), heart 
rate and body position compared to an in- laboratory PSG .  
4. To evaluate the accuracy of the WatchPAT  200 device in determining sleep architecture 
compared to an in- laboratory polysomnogram.  
 
II. Background and Significance :  
Obstructive sleep apnea is estimated to affect approximately 1% to 5% of children between the ages of [ADDRESS_958817] poor sensitivity and specificity 18-19; therefore, objective 
testing is needed.

The American Academy of Pediatrics  (AAP) 1 recommends an overnight, attended, in- laboratory 
polysomnogram (level 1 sleep study) as the diagnostic test of choice for children with suspected OSA. The polysomnogram measures a number of physiologic functions overnight which includes 
an EEG, pulse oximetry, oronasal airflow, abdominal and chest wall movements, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) and video recording which will help demonstrate the presence or abse nce 
of OSA. 
[ADDRESS_958818] (or referral to a sleep special ist 
or otolaryngologist) when an inpatient polysomnogram is not available, with the rationale that some 
objective testing is better than none. [ADDRESS_958819] looked into alternative objective tests in diagnosing OSA in children. However, these alternative tests (i.e. level [ADDRESS_958820], overnight continuous pulse oximetry, audiotapes and videotapes, etc.) have been found to have a low negative predictive value, indicating that a negative result is not sufficient to exclude 
OSA, and the tests should not be used in routine practice. 
1, [ADDRESS_958821] has been used in some adults; however,  it does not usually 
record sleep, is not routinely utilized in children, and is  not the standard of care in this age group. 
Therefore, a continued search for alternative testing is needed.  
  
A viable al ternative to the polysomnogram  is the WatchPAT  200. This is an FDA approved wrist 
worn ambulatory sleep study device in patients > 12 yea rs of age that uses peripheral arterial 
tonometry in conjunction with pulse oximetry and actigraphy to assess respi[INVESTIGATOR_705504].  28 
It has 6 channels which includes the following: 1. Peripheral arterial tone (PAT) which measures the arterial volume changes, reflecting sympathetic nervous system activation caused by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_674454]; 2. Oximetry;  3. Actigraphy, which measures body movement during sleep; 4. Heart rate; 5. Body position, which can measure supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], prone or side sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_705505] 6. Snoring intensity. Clinical parameters measured include: 1.  PAT apnea- hypopnea 
index  (PAHI), 2. PAT respi[INVESTIGATOR_285556] ( PRDI), 3. PAT sleep staging identification 
(PSTAGES) and optional snoring level and  body position discr ete states  from an external 
integrated snoring and body position (SBP) sensor . 
[ADDRESS_958822] been associated with arousals from sleep. 
29-35 The 
device then indirectly detects apnea and hypopnea via selectively measuring peripheral arterial volume changes mediated by [CONTACT_56576]- adrenergic receptors in smooth muscle via a finger mounted 
plethysmograph. This information is collected together with data from the pulse oximeter and heart rate, which is further analyzed using a predeveloped automated algorithm.  
36 
 It requires minimal cleaning, preparation and handling before or after patient use. Fully automated 
reports are also generated within minutes; thereby [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_705506] a more timely manner. F urthermore, it has the advantage 
of eliminating interscorer variability. This technology has the potential to be an accurate and safe 
alternative in diagnosing OSA in the younger age group, where the disease is known to be prevalent.

 III. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report:   
 
There have been validation studies which were mostly performed in adult patients.  Weimin et al. 
studied 28 adults with suspected OSA who underwent an inpatient polysomnogram while wearing a 
WatchPAT 200. The study  showed comparable accuracy in detecting OSA based on AHI (mean 
PSG score for events/hour was 23 + 21.55 compared to a mean score of 25.00 + 19.09 for the 
WatchPAT, r=0.92, P<0.001). It also provided a reasonably accurate estimation of sleep and wakefullness (agreement was 89 +6%). 
37 In another validation research using the WatchPAT200, 
Gan et al studied 20 patients with suspected OSA who also had simultaneous PSG and WatchPAT200 concurrently at the sleep lab. The study showed the WatchPAT being 100% sensitive when compared to PSG for detecting mild OSA and concluded that it is a good screening 
test for the undiagnosed general population. They study showed 100% specificity when compared to PSG for severe OSA suggesting that it is a good diagnostic test for peopl e with a high suspi[INVESTIGATOR_705507].
38 
 A meta -analysis by [CONTACT_705516]. on 14 studies assessing the correlation of sleep indexes 
between PAT devices and PSG in adults (aged >18 years). The researchers found high overall correlation of the RDI and AHI (r=0.889 [95% CI, 0.862- 0.911]; P<.001). Studies comparing the 
RDI between PAT and PSG had a combined correlation of 0.879 (95% CI, 0.849 -0.904; P <.001); 
those comparing the AHI, 0.893 (0.857- 0.920; P <.001); and those comparing the ODI,  0.942 
(0.894- 0.969; P < .001). 
36 
 Hedner et al. specifically studied the agreement in determining sleep architecture between the WatchPAT 100 and an in laboratory polysomnogram. The overall agreement in detecting light/deep and REM sleep were 88.6% + 5.9% and 88.7% + 5.5%  respectively. OSA severity did not affect the 
sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm. The Cohen K coefficient for detecting all sleep stages: sleep from wake, REM from NREM sleep and deep from light sleep were 0.48, 0.55, 0.[ADDRESS_958823] techniqes in normal subjects and OSA patients.
39 
 
There are a few studies looking into the utility of the WatchPAT in the younger population. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_705508] ( PSDB) in 28 children (5- 12 years) presenting with symptoms 
of SDB but with a negative nocturnal pulse oximetry test. The study showed that in these children, the WatchPAT was able to detect sleep disordered breathing in 10/28 (35.7%) using a cut off of PAT Respi[INVESTIGATOR_72210] (PRDI) of [ADDRESS_958824]. When the threshold for SDB was changed to a PAHI of >1, the number of positive 
patients for PSDB increased to 17/28 (60.7%). 
[ADDRESS_958825]. The study found that in the 6- 11 year old age group, 14 cases were diagnosed 
with OSA by [CONTACT_705517]; howe ver, in the 3- 5 year age group, only six children 
were diagnosed with OSA and there was a significant difference between the PAT and PSG (p<0.05). 
41 More validation studies in this age group is needed.

C. Study Design and Research Methods   
 
This is an investigator -initiated pi[INVESTIGATOR_705509] 200 device 
in the diagnosis of pediatric OSA.  Subjects will be identified through the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_705510] a clinically indicated sleep study. 
After IRB approval is obtained, subjects will be recruited through the sleep lab by [CONTACT_705518].  Subjects who appear via chart review to be a 
good fit will be approached prior to their sleep study to inform them of the research protocol and gauge interest in participation.   
 For all subjects, the sleep study will be scheduled and equipment set up in a fashion routine to 
therapeutic sleep studies.  The standard of care will not be altered or changed due to participation 
in the study or not.  
 Subjects who decide to participate in the research protocol will undergo their normal PSG setup in the sleep lab.  Additionally, they will wear the WatchP AT [ADDRESS_958826]’s 
wrist by a registered sleep technician or member of the study team that is familiar with the device.  The consenting process will also take place by [CONTACT_705519].   Data to be collected from all subjects include results of baseline/diagnostic polysomnogram (PSG) 
and sleep parameter indices (apnea- hypopnea index, etc.).  Upon completion of the sleep study, 
the clinically indicated study will be scored by a physician as normal.  The PSG will then be scored 
again by a single- point dedicated sleep technician research scorer to ensure consistent scoring 
methods between subjects and clinical sleep study scorers.  The data collected by [CONTACT_705520] 200device will be scored through the WatchPAT [ADDRESS_958827]- protected computer.  Additional information that may be collected includes medical 
history, medications, and basic demographic information.

E.   Potential Scientific Problems:   
 
There are no potential scientific problems at this time.  
 
F.   Data Analysis Plan:  
 
Statistical Analysis plan  
 
Data collected for a participant will be excluded from the analysis if any of the 
following: 1) WatchPAT  200 sleep time of less than 4 hours, 2) Lab test sleep time of 
less than 4 hours, 3) poor quality Lab test, consisting of a substantial portion of the Lab test not assessable, as determined by [CONTACT_705521] 4) all WatchPAT  200 channel information not available from the study.  The primary goal of 
the study is to validate and compare two sleep study modalities: 1) WatchPAT  200 
and 2) Lab Testing sleep apnea.  
 
Summary statistics of basic demographics on the study population will be calculated.  
Wilcoxon signed rank test will compare median outcomes of interest ( Total AHI, 
OAHI ,etc) between WatchPAT  200 and PSG Lab testing. Spearman’s correlation 
coefficient will be used to measure cor relation between WatchPAT  200 and Lab 
testing.  Bland Altman plots will graphically assess modality correlation.  Sensitivity 
and specificity with 95% confidence intervals of WatchPAT  200 will be calculated for 
three cutoffs of the outcomes (< 2, <5, and <10 events/hour ) using the PSG lab study 
as the gold standard.   Finally, test agreement on apnea categories will be assessed 
using Cohen’s Kappa statistics fixing OSA diagnosis as dichotomized as non e or mild 
(OAHI <2 events/hour) versus moderate or severe (O AHI ≥ 5 events/hour) disease.  
Other analyses may be conducted on specific strata of participants, based on either 
patient age or BMI percentile.  
 
Power and Sample Size  
 Power and sample size were calculated for the primary aim of the study using Power Analysis & Sample Size Software, PASS 15.0 (NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah, [LOCATION_003]).  
The primary aim is to assess whether the PatWatch device agrees with PSG 
laboratory studies in its ability to detect OSA.  For the power analysis OSA diagnosis 
was dichotomized as non or mild (AHI<4.5) versus moderate or severe (AHI ≥ 4.5) disease.  
 
From previous clinical sleep study experience, (from personal review of PSG’s 
performed at the Main Campus of Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_705511] 2017), investigators anticipate roughly [ADDRESS_958830] for agreement between two raters using the Kappa statistic, a sample size of 
120 participants achieves 80% power to detect a true Kappa value of 0.[ADDRESS_958831] of 
H0: Kappa ≤ κ0 vs. H1: Kappa > κ0 when there are 2 categories with frequencies equal to 0.82 and 0.18. This power calculation is based on a significance lev el of 
alpha = 0.05.  
 Investigators also wished to determine whether the difference of proportions of 
individuals detected to have OSA between testing modalities was no larger than 5%.  
Protocol Template  Page 6 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 A sample size of 147 participants achieves 80 % power at a significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_958832] 
proportion is 0.18, the maximum allowable difference between these proportions that 
still results in non- inferiority (the range of non- inferiority) is 0.05 or  5%, and assuming 
the actual difference of the proportions is 0.0.  
 With 17 months enrollment and an enrollment rate of 80%, investigators anticipate enrolling 150 participants to ensure power >80% for each hypothesis test described 
above.   
 G.  Summarize Knowledge to be Gained:   
 
We hope to gain the knowledge that the WatchPAT [ADDRESS_958833] OSA in children 4- 12 years of age with comparable accuracy with an in- laboratory 
PSG.

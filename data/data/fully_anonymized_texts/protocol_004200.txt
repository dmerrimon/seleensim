Version 4.0         Revised 09/25/18 1.0 Objectives / Specific Aims  
Specific Aims:  Few family -centered self -management interventions exist to assist children with 
sickle cell disease (SCD) and their families, which deprive this population of skills that may improve 
symptom management and quality of life. SCD is an inherited complex chron ic condition (CCC) that 
leads to adverse health outcomes such as pain and organ damage affecting approximately 100,[ADDRESS_1178764] fewer resources are at greater risk for adverse outcomes 
such as increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68896] (ED) utilization and physical and psychosocial 
morbidity. Children with SCD and their families, particularly those who are underserved, would benefit 
from interventions designed to bolster self -management skills and enhance preventive management 
of the disease to reduce negative complications. Importan tly, caregivers of young children with SCD 
are often new to the disease process and have unique needs and challenges.  
     Interventions designed to address the unique needs of and barriers encountered by [CONTACT_847916]. In addition, technology -
based resources such as mobile health applications for symptom tracking, may allow intervention 
delivery to typi[INVESTIGATOR_847864] -to-reach populations, thereby [CONTACT_847917], inc luding 
lack of transportation and obtaining childcare. Further, incorporating theory -based family -centered 
self-management strategies is crucial to support families in developi[INVESTIGATOR_847865], improved self -
management behaviors (e.g. monitoring symptoms, an d attending clinic appointments) which will 
ultimately improve symptom management (e.g. pain, fatigue) and quality of life, and decrease costly 
emergency department (ED) visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
     The interprofessional team of investigators for thi s study includes a mentee (Phillips) with a clinical 
background as a pediatric acute care nurse and research experience with exploring barriers in access 
to care among children with CCC. Mentors include an R01 funded nurse scientist who is an expert in 
intervention development and the conduct of clinical trials (Kelechi: primary mentor), an R01 funded 
clinical psychologist with extensive expertise in technology, user -based design, and intervention 
adaptation (Ruggiero: co -mentor), a pediatric hematologist/o ncologist specializing in clinical care and 
research with populations with SCD (Kanter: co -mentor), and a biostatistician with extensive research 
experience (Mueller: co -mentor). This complementary interdisciplinary team has the knowledge, 
skills, and acce ss to the population to successfully conduct this study, but will also provide the 
mentee with mentorship and training experiences in theory -based, technology -enhanced intervention 
research among a population of children with a CCC and their caregivers.  
     
The purpose of this  second phase of this study is to conduct feasibility testing of an innovative, 
technology -based intervention to improve self -management behavior, quality of life, and symptom 
management (SMYLS) in a sample of children with SCD and t heir families. Three components are 
included in the intervention: previously tested educational materials for adults with SCD and their 
families, a publicly available mHealth application for tracking pain in SCD, and a model of patient -
provider communicati on delivered via mHealth that has been tested with older children with SCD. The 
goal of the proposed research is to use the theory -based Pediatric Self -Management Model to tailor 
and pi[INVESTIGATOR_847866] p hysical symptom 
management and quality of life for children with SCD ages 8 -17 years and their caregivers.  
 
During this  second phase of this study, we se ek to achieve the following aims : 
 
Primary aim of the study is to: Assess feasibility of implementatio n processes including reach, 
enrollment, fidelity, adoption, acceptability, and satisfaction using the RE -AIM framework with process 
measures, surveys, and key informant interviews.  
Secondary Aim: Investigate the presence of signals of efficacy on measures  of self -management, 
and physical and psychological symptoms and quality of life.  
Version 4.0         Revised 09/25/[ADDRESS_1178765] step 
(adaptation and feasibility testing) in a research continuum that will lead to validation of a technology -
based intervention for improving self -management, symptom management, heal th care utilization and 
ultimately quality of life among populations of children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) and 
their caregivers.  
     Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a highly complex and challenging chronic disorder that negatively 
influences qua lity of life in children and families of those with the disorder. [ADDRESS_1178766] SCD; >90% of these are African American. [ADDRESS_1178767] high 
health care and “other” needs that endure throughout their lifetime, prevent ive actions are necessary 
in early childhood to avoid or mitigate adverse effects of the disease process. For optimal 
management and minimal adverse effects, persons with SCD and/or caregivers must coordinate 
appointments with various providers, continuous ly monitor symptoms, and obtain preventive home 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Often, challenges are pronounced early in the disease process as caregivers learn about 
the disease and treatments. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], a multidisciplinary team is established and caregivers learn to 
coordi nate and maintain care. However, SCD primarily affects an underserved population (i.e., 
African Americans) who disproportionately face barriers such as transportation, obtaining childcare, 
and taking time from work. In fact, low -income children with SCD ha ve significantly higher 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_847867]. [ADDRESS_1178768] not been well implemented 
for children with SCD. Fortunately, assistance with providing reliable sources of disease and 
treatment related information, decision -making, and communication with the care team via technolo gy 
improve family -centered self -management behaviors in older children (ages 10 -17 years) with SCD. 10 
Assisting families caring for an infant or young chi ld with SCD via a similar technology -based model 
may lead to improved self -management and quality of life outcomes. Providing resources via this 
mechanism may reduce burden and maximize outreach to this difficult to reach, underserved, high 
needs populatio n. Traditional barriers to care such as transportation, childcare, and work conflicts can 
be overcome. Long -term management of SCD and prevention of adverse outcomes also requires 
support for self -management skill development. Through technological resourc es and collaborative 
relationships with providers, caregivers can receive support to develop self -management skills.  
Technology -based self -management has the potential to address barriers . Use of a technology -
based  intervention  that has been tailored to meet  child/adolescent/ caregiver -reported needs is 
expected to increase engagement and reach of s elf-management strategies. Our technology -based 
intervention  (a self-management program for youth living with sickle cell disease - SMYLS ) consists 
of three components: previously tested electronic educ ational materials on the SCD  process and 
management; a publicly available, web -based , mHealth  application for SCD pain monitoring and 
tracking; and a previously -tested model of patient -provider comm unication delivered via mHealth 
commu nication with a provider  with expertise in SCD. Innovative delivery of coaching a nd support 
Version 4.0         Revised 09/25/[ADDRESS_1178769] on the 
individual, family, commun ity, and health care system domains. Because this study will focus on 
children ages 8- 17 years and their caregivers, and on the caregiver -provider relationship, we will 
target the family and health care system domains. Specific influences, processes, and behaviors 
addressed in this study are outlined in Table 1.  
 
Table 1: Intervention Self -Management Influences, Processes, and Behaviors  
This is Phase II of the overall study. During Phase I, we refined the development 
and design of the intervention, by [CONTACT_847918][INVESTIGATOR_847868] a target population of users. Now, in Phase II, we aim to 
deploy the intervention in a real -world settin 3.0 Intervention to be studied  
     The intervention is a multicomponent (3 -part) technology -based package. 
The intervention targets influences and processes informed by [CONTACT_847919]-Management framework (Table 1). Component 1 (education)  consists of 
continuous access to directed educational resources on the SCD process, 
treatment, home management strategies, symptom prevention and 
management strategies. These materials are easily accessible via a mobile 
device given to caregivers and chil dren (8 -17 years)  and will include patient -
centered PDF files and links to websites developed and tested by 
[CONTACT_676116]. An example includes the patient education materials

Component 2 (symptom monitoring and tracking) consists of a mobile -device based publicly availabl e 
application for tracking and monitoring pain in SCD that also permits upload of symptom logs and text 
alerts to a health care provider (Voice Crisis Alert). Component 3 (caregiver -provider communication) 
is based on Jacob et al. (2013)’s intervention wit h an mHealth intervention for older children with 
SCD. This component consists of a technology -based connection with a provider who will: respond to 
alerts delivered via the mHealth application, monitor pain symptoms delivered via the mHealth 
application, and respond to messages. A provider at the MUSC Pediatric Sickle Cell Clinic will 
collaborate with caregivers to coach caregivers on the care of the child and provide support to the 
caregiver. 10 Caregivers will receive a daily message using a semi -structured protocol to “check in” 
with participants and promote engagement. All components are integrated into the web -based app. A 
secure portal is in place for messaging that encrypts all messages and protects confidentiality.

4.0 Study  Endpoints  
Study end points include: Successful study completions, Consent withdrawals, PI [INVESTIGATOR_847871] s, 
Lost contact [CONTACT_10970], and unexpected adverse events.  
 
5.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria/ Study Population  
• Eligible caregiver/child dyads will be identified through the staff at the MUSC 
Pediatric Sickle Cell Clinic. After receiving permission to approach, PI [INVESTIGATOR_847872] s against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Screening will be documented in REDCap.   
Inclusion Criteria  
• Children ages 8 - 17 years and parent or primary caregiver 18 years of age or 
older  
• Child with sickle cell disease, as reported by [CONTACT_847921]  
• Parent/caregiver or child with cognitive disability or delay that precludes ability 
to participate  
• Lack of Wi -Fi access  
 
Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
Both women and minorities will be included in the proposed study. Women are more often than 
men reported to be the primary caregiver of children with chronic conditions and approximately 
66% of caregivers of adults with chronic illness are women. Therefore , it is anticipated that 
more women will be recruited as participants than men. In addition, SCD occurs almost 
exclusively in African Americans; therefore, it is anticipated that all or nearly all of the caregiver 
participants will be African American.  
 
Inclusion of Children  
Children without cognitive delay ages  between the  ages of 8 -17 years will be included as p art 
of the child/caregiver dyad.  
 
6.0 Number of Subjects  
Version 4.0         Revised 09/25/18 N=60 – 30 caregivers of 30 children (8-17 years) with SCD  will be recruited.  
7.0 Setting  
• The intervention will be used by [CONTACT_847922]. 
Study visits will occur at MUSC Sickle Cell Unit and via telephone to the 
participant’s home .  
8.0 Recruitment Methods  
• Parents/caregivers who participated in Phase I of the study and agreed to be re -
contact[CONTACT_847923].  
• For other potential participants, the MUSC Pediatric Sickle Cell Clinic staff will be 
given the inc lusion/exclusion criteria and will be asked to identify eligible 
participants in the clinic. When potentially eligible participants attend an 
appointment at the clinic, the clinician/staff will approach the parent/caregiver, 
briefly introduce the study  through a n IRB approved  study letter , and if interested 
ask if the researchers  can speak with the parent/caregiver to offer additional 
information. For parents/caregivers who agree, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_847873] -to-face in the clinic and conduct 
eligibility screening. Eligible and interested parents/caregivers will proceed to the 
informed consent interview.  
• Additionally, for the purposes of this study and in direct alignment with the mission 
of the CON P20 Symptom Self-Management Center, we will employ the use of 
MUSC Bioinformatics Center (BMIC) core services to identify and recruit patients 
across the MUSC Enterprise that meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
that have granted authorized research contact  [CONTACT_847924] ‘opt in’ EPIC designation. Once these potentially eligible patients are 
identified, we will then contact [CONTACT_847925] a script to determine if they 
are interested in study participation  
• Flyers will b e posted in the waiting room and patient rooms at the MUSC Sickle 
Cell Clinic. The flyers will include the PI’s contact [CONTACT_3031]; interested 
parents/caregivers who call the PI [INVESTIGATOR_847874].  
9.0 Consent Process  
Since research will be conducted with caregiver/child dyads, consent will be obtained from the 
parent/caregiver and written assent from the child participant  (12-17 years) . In this study, w e will 
employ the use of two informed consenting strategies  (In-person meeting and electronically through 
REDCap e -Consent)  so as to increase the reach of the study and to promote the generalizability of 
findings .  
 
In-Person i nformed consent will occur in the comfort and safety of a private clinic room at the MUSC 
Sickle  Cell Unit prior to any screening procedures being conducted and/or data collection. Potential 
participants will be given the informed consent document to read and review in advance, and/or may 
have it read to them by [CONTACT_847926]. After reviewing the Consent document, both 
caregiver and child will be given the opportunity to ask any questions about the study that they may 
have, and will be requested to demonstrate what is expected from them should they enroll in the 
study through a questi oning of their understanding of study procedures and risks. Prior to consenting, 
all questions will be resolved to the caregiver and child's satisfaction. If a participant does not appear 
to understand the information contained within the Consent document,  the study coordinator will 
review the consent document again with the participant. If after this second review, the subject does 
not demonstrate an understanding, they will not be enrolled in the study. Only participants, with no 
Version 4.0         Revised 09/25/18 diagnosed or observed cog nitive impairment, will be consented and enrolled into the study.  
 
Electronic or e -Consenting will be performed on eligible families that wa nt to participate in the study 
but are unwilling for whatever reason and/or unable to come to MUSC for a face -to-face informed 
consent meeting.  Families identified through the study recruitment process es that fall into this 
category will already have spoken with the researchers by [CONTACT_756], have been introduced to the 
study and its demands, as well as had their initia l questions answered. After speaking with the 
researchers, f amilies that are further interested in study participation will be asked to provide an email 
address at which they will receive a REDCap survey link containing a scanned image of the currently 
approved Informed Consent document (developed from the MUSC REDCap e -consent template ). 
Families will be able to take as much time as they like to read the consent document together in the 
comfort and privacy of their own home or at a place and time of their choosing. They will be provided 
with the telephone and email contact [CONTACT_847927], 
should they have any questions before providing their consent by [CONTACT_847928] g it. Prior to providing their physical e -consent, the researchers will 
coordinate with these families; so as to be on the telephone and be available to further answer any 
questions that they may have during the e -consent process.  Should a participant have any questions 
or concerns about the study, the researchers will address these issues to the best of their abilities 
and knowledge. Upon submitting the e -consent, a REDCap trigger will immediately notify the 
researchers, who will t hen provide their countersignature [CONTACT_187291].  
 
The consent form will meet the requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations and the MUSC 
Institutional Review Board. The consent form will include the following:  
1. The purpose, nature, and objectives, potential risks and benefits of the intended study.  
2. The length of study and the likely follow -up required.  
3. The name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a contact [CONTACT_6823](s) responsible for the protocol.  
4. The right of the participant to accept or refuse stu dy interactions and to withdraw from participation 
at any time.  
 
The HIPPA authorization process will be conducted sequentially with the family in the same manner 
by [CONTACT_41314]. Participants will be able to download a copy of their executed informed e -
consent/HIPAA authorization forms directly to their own computer, or have copi[INVESTIGATOR_819555]. 
They will also be given the option to have a copy of their executed e -forms mailed to them should 
they elect to do so. A copy of the executed e -consent/HIPAA  authorization forms will also be stored in 
the participant's electronic case record for monitoring and audit purposes.  
 
If a child participant should reach an age of majority while enrolled in the study, they will be asked to 
provide written consent.  
 
10.0 Study Design / Methods  
The mHealth SCD management intervention  will be delivered via an app on  both the caregiver and 
child mobile device s over a 12 -week period. This multi -component, web -based app consists of 1.) 
continuous access to directed education al resources on the SCD process, treatment, home 
management strategies, symptom prevention and management strategies; 2.) a series of pages in 
the app that allow for tracking and monitoring symptoms; and 3.) child/caregiver – provider 
communication. The ed ucational component is based on patient -centered materials that have been 
developed and tested by [CONTACT_676116]. In the app, educational materials are organized by 
[CONTACT_847929] (for individuals with SCD) or role for parents/caregivers. Citations are pr ovided and links to 
the sources are included. The symptom tracking and monitoring component consists of a 
customizable avatar on which the user can record the location, severity, and characteristics of pain. 
Users can record other concurrent or associated symptoms (such as fatigue) and can view a graph 
Version 4.0         Revised 09/25/[ADDRESS_1178771] sickle cell crisis hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , 
medications, and allergies. The child/caregiver – provider communication component consists of the 
ability for the child/caregiver to send a secure message to providers within the app to communicate 
pain and other symptoms. Providers will have the capabi lity to securely send a reply within the app. In 
addition, children/caregivers can choose to receive a daily “support” message that will be 
automatically sent from a list of possible messages. All communication is encrypted and sent securely 
within the app  via a portal. Two to three providers at the MUSC Sickle Cell Clinic will participate as 
the designated providers in the study.  
 
To determine feasibility, we will apply the RE -AIM framework to assess the Reach, Efficacy, 
Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance of the intervention with 30 children/caregiver dyads. 18 
The domains a re further explicated in Table 1 . The inter vention will be loaded onto the child’s and 
caregiver’s tablet or smartphone (Appl e or Android); participants without a device will be provided one 
for the durat ion of the study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_847875]. Participants will also receive writte n instructions and a 
contact [CONTACT_847930]. Baseline measures (Table 1 ) will be collected 
during the same meeting. Participants will retain the devices and will participate in the intervention 
over a [ADDRESS_1178772]-intervention data 
collected . Caregivers will also be asked to return  the mobile device  at the end of the study . The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_847876].  
 
Retention: To improve retention, IRB -approved personnel will contact [CONTACT_847931] [ADDRESS_1178773] baseline data collection: weeks 3, 9, 15, 18, and 21. The purpose is to maintain 
contact [CONTACT_808340], not data collection. Correspondence will be logged in REDCap. 
Contact [CONTACT_847932], usi ng the number(s) provided to study personnel upon 
enrollment. Exam ples of messages are provided in an uploaded attachment.  
 
 
Post -intervention interviews. All [ADDRESS_1178774] approximately 45 -60 minutes, and will be conducted according to an 
interview guide with open -ended questions and prompts. These interviews will be recorded for later 
nVivo  qualitative data analysis. Reimbursement for dyads  will be a $[ADDRESS_1178775] provided at each of 
the 4 data collection points, with dyads  in key informant interviews receiving an additional $[ADDRESS_1178776]. All payments will be given to the caregiver.  Selecte d caregivers will be given the option of 
having the interview conducted in -person in a private room at MUSC or by [CONTACT_847933].  
 
Measures. Children (8-17 years) and Caregivers will complete age-appropriate self -report 
assessments at baseline, mid -intervention (6 weeks), post -intervention (12 weeks), and [ADDRESS_1178777]-intervention as previously described . Self -report and proxy assessments will be collected during 
meetings between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_847877]. Depe nding on participants’ preference and 
availability visit 2, 3 and 4 surveys will be completed either by [CONTACT_847934]. All data will be recorded in REDCap by [CONTACT_289278].  
Version 4.0         Revised 09/25/[ADDRESS_1178778] that we will be 
able to recruit 30 child/caregiver dyads. With such a sample we will be able to estimate outcome 
proportions for feasibility measures including recruitment and drop -out with precision ±0.11 to ±0.16 
for values of the true proportion ranging from 0.10 to  0.30 (or correspondingly, from 0.70 to 0.90). 
Assuming a drop -out rate of up to 30%, 95% confidence limits can be estimated for impact measures, 
such as change from pre -to-post in quality of life for child and caregiver with a precision ranging from 
±0.43  to ±1.[ADDRESS_1178779] deviations for change in quality of life scores 
ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 SD units.  
 
Demographic and clinical variables obtained at baseline will be described via measures of central 
tendency (mean, median), vari ability and frequency distributions as appropriate. Additionally, 
demographic and clinical characteristics for those who adhered to the study protocol (study 
completers) versus those who did not adhere (non -adherers and drop -outs) will be compared to 
bette r describe the population for this study. For continuous quality of life measures for the child and 
caregiver the difference between pre and post intervention measurements will be estimated via 95% 
confidence intervals. To assess preliminary intervention e ffects, we will conduct repeated measures 
ANCOVA with symptom (pain) severity and type obtained daily as dependent variable in individual 
models adjusting for “dose” defined as number of times education module was accessed and total 
time spent in education  modules.  
 
Post -intervention qualitative analyses (Aim 2):  Data collected from post -intervention key informant 
interviews will be analyzed using directed content analysis [ADDRESS_1178780] the 
RE-AIM domains.  
 
13.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data and Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
There is a well -developed and NIH/NINR prepared SRG approved DSMP that involves the use of a 
Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) that shall mee t semi -annually post initial study enrollment. The 
Committee is comprised of key individuals that include: an independent medical safety monitor (ISM), 
a biostatistician (BS), and the Program Manager (PM).  
 
The following members of the study’s DSMC will pe rform data safety monitoring of the study:  
• [CONTACT_676142], Independent Safety Monitor (ISM) - primary responsibility  
• [CONTACT_847961], MS, Project Manager (PM)  
• [CONTACT_847962], Biostatistician (BS) - supervised by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Martina Mueller.  
 
Indepen dent Safety Monitor (ISM), [CONTACT_289312] who is Assistant Professor at Medical University of 
South Carolina, has a PhD and a background as a clinical psychologist with expertise in adolescent

Protecting Confidentiality of Participant Data  
Participant Screening and Enrollment. All data from participants screen ed for the study will be  
entered into  an electronic study database. Designated research staff will collect, gather, and enter 
required  data (written informed consent, HIPAA Authorization, and demographics) onto study data 
forms. Screened  patients who do no t meet  study eligibility will have specific  screening data entered  
into the study database. The collected data will be helpful in examining the patient population  and 
feasibility of  enrollment  criteria and  will include reason for exclusion. All dates will be shifted and other 
Personal Health Information  (PHI) will be removed from the study database upon study completion. 
All data obtained from this study will be used for research purposes only and will comply with Federal 
HIPAA regulations.  Master Scr eening and Enrollment Logs will be maintained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_847882].  
 
Version 4.0         Revised 09/25/18 Case Report Forms. All proposed study specific case report forms (source documents) for data 
collection will be designed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238], when possible, transferred by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_847883] (eCRFs) for use in the study’s REDCap database. These study specific eCRFs 
source documents (study logs for correspondence, compensation a nd other forms such as pre -
eligibility screens) will be coded by [CONTACT_47991]’s  unique study ID# for all data collected including 
study instruments  will be maintained in  the participant research record.  Completed instruments  that 
require  signature  [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a paper  CRF will be scanned  and uploaded into the study database to all for 
remote electronic safety monitoring as well as maintained on file in accordance with MUSC policies 
and applicable Federal  Regulations  for the Conduct of Human Participant Research.  
 
Binders . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_847884] a  participant -specific binder for each  participant 
containing  all non-eCRFs records. A regulatory file will also be maintained to include the IRB -
approved Protocol, original Informed Consent documents, HIPAA  forms and other study -related  
regulatory documents.  All paper research records and CRFs will be maintained in  a locked file 
cabinet, stored in a room for research files that is accessible only via a password protected entry 
system that features security c ameras, within the College  of Nursing.  Access to the  research records, 
study database and PHI’s will be restricted to study  personnel  as approved  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_187212].  
As with all studies conducted at MUSC, this study is  also eligible for a random  audit by [CONTACT_847938].  
 
Data Processing.  This study will use Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) for data 
capture and management. REDCap is a software toolset and workflow methodology for the 
electronic collection and management of resea rch and clinical trials data. REDCap provides 
secure, web -based, flexible applications, including real -time validation rules with automated data 
type and range checks at the time of data entry. Exports are made available for several statistical 
packages in cluding SPSS, SAS, SATA, R and Microsoft Excel.  The study -specific REDCap 
electronic database will be designed and developed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_847885].  The 
provision of REDCap is made available through the South Carolina Clinical & Translatio nal Research 
(SCTR) Institute at MUSC with  NIH Grant awards UL1RR029882 and UL1TR000062.  
 
Data Security . Ensuring data security, compliance with [ADDRESS_1178782] Operating Procedures (SOP)  to ensure a high level of data 
security while  coordinating electronic  and paper data management activities for clinical research 
trials. The REDCap study database will be hosted in the Biomedical Informatics secure data center at 
MUSC, a secure environmen t for data systems and servers on campus, and includes firewall, 
redundancy, failover capability, backups and extensive security checks. The secure data center has 
strict access control; only authorized core personnel may access the facility un -escorted. O nly 
authorized users are allowed to connect to the network, and the security of the network is actively 
monitored.  Power and environmental controls have several layers of backups, from interruptible 
power supplies to alternate and redundant feeds to the l ocal utility company. The REDCap system 
administrator contributes to the maintenance of institutional disaster recovery and business continuity 
plans.  Load balancers and a highly fault tolerant SAN infrastructure contribute to high availability.  
 
The RED Cap system itself has several additional layers of protection including password protection. 
Access to the data and its security is managed institutionally by [CONTACT_187267] a 
Shibboleth login with an MUSC issued NetID and features a user acco unt management filter that 
controls who can access the data and to what degree. All personnel must pass an employment 
background check before being issued an ID. Password complexity, history and expi[INVESTIGATOR_847886]. Access to individual REDCap projects and their data is 
managed by [CONTACT_187268]. All transactions are securely delivered to the application using 
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL – SHA-1 with RSA Encryption; 2048 -bits). It is then transmitted inter nally 
Version 4.0         Revised 09/25/18 (behind the firewall) to the database server. All transactions are logged at the server layer (httpd 
logging), application layers (REDCap logs activity to a database table), and the database layer, using 
both query and binary logging. This feature pr ovides audit trails for all changes, queries, data exports 
and reports. MUSC Information security policies are available at: https://mainweb -
v.musc.edu/security/policy/   
 
Data Entry . Only MUSC IRB approved study personnel  that are authorized to have  access to the 
REDCap study database will be granted  password access. Study personnel using computers that are 
connected to the Inte rnet will directly enter data into the remotely housed database. As such, no 
electronic study data will be stored on hard drives and/or any portable electronic devices. Additionally, 
all personnel with access to the database will have current University of  Miami CITI and GCP training 
in the Conduct of Human Subject Protections, and HIPAA and Information Security trainings that are 
completed annually. Each participant will be assigned a unique study identifier, all PHIs will be 
masked, and data exports will be limited to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_847887].  
 
Data Monitoring . Ongoing quality control procedures will  be implemented for data collection,  
storage and  processing. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_847888] o f the study database  and generate a

1.0 Objectives  / Specific Aims  
Specific Aims: Few family -centered self -management interventions exist to assist children 
with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their families, which deprive this population of skills that may 
improve symptom management and quality of life. SCD is an inherited complex chron ic 
condition (CCC) that leads to adverse health outcomes such as pain and organ damage affecting 
approximately 100,[ADDRESS_1178787] fewer resources are at 
greater risk for adverse outcomes such as increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68896] (ED) 
utilization and physical and psychosocial morbidity. Children with SCD and their families, 
particularly those who are underserved, would benefit from interventions designed to bolster 
self-management skills and enhance preventive management of the disease to reduce negative 
complications. Importan tly, caregivers of young children with SCD are often new to the disease 
process and have unique needs and challenges.  
      Interventions designed to address the unique needs of and barriers encountered by [CONTACT_847941] t of the disease in the home setting. In addition, 
technology -based resources such as mobile health applications for symptom tracking, may allow 
intervention delivery to typi[INVESTIGATOR_847864] -to-reach populations, thereby [CONTACT_847942], in cluding lack of transportation and obtaining childcare. Further, incorporating theory -
based family -centered self -management strategies is crucial to support families in developi[INVESTIGATOR_847890], improved self -management behaviors (e.g. monitoring symptoms, a nd attending 
clinic appointments) which will ultimately improve symptom management (e.g. pain, fatigue) 
and quality of life, and decrease costly emergency department (ED) visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
 The interprofessional team of investigators for this s tudy includes a mentee (Phillips) 
with a clinical background as a pediatric acute care nurse and research experience with 
exploring barriers in access to care among children with CCC. Mentors include an R01 funded 
nurse scientist who is an expert in interv ention development and the conduct of clinical trials 
(Kelechi: primary mentor), an R01 funded clinical psychologist with extensive expertise in 
technology, user -based design, and intervention adaptation (Ruggiero: co -mentor), a pediatric 
hematologist/onco logist specializing in clinical care and research with populations with SCD 
(Kanter: co -mentor), and a biostatistician with extensive research experience (Mueller: co -
mentor). This complementary interdisciplinary team has the knowledge, skills, and access to the 
population to successfully conduct this study, but will also provide the mentee with mentorship 
and training experiences in theory -based, technology -enhanced intervention research among a 
population of children with a CCC and their caregivers.  
 There are t hree main components with in the study intervention : previously tested 
educational materials for adults with SCD and their families, a publicly available mHealth 
application for tracking pain in SCD, and a model of patient -provider communication del ivered 
via mHealth that has been tested with older children with SCD. The goal of the proposed 
research is to use the theory -based Pediatric Self -Management Model to tailor and pi[INVESTIGATOR_847891] l symptom management and 
quality of life for children with SCD ages [ADDRESS_1178788] feasibility testing 
of an innovative, technology -based intervention to improve self -management behavior, quality 
of life, and symptom management in a sample of children with SCD  and their families.

During this  second phase of this study, we seek to achieve the following aims:  
 
Primary Aim: Assess feasi bility of implementation processes including reach, enrollment, 
fidelity, adoption, acceptability, and satisfaction using the RE -AIM framew ork with process 
measures, surveys, and key informant interviews.  
 
Secondary Aim: Investigate the presence of signals of efficacy on measures of self -
management, and physical and psychological symptoms and quality of life.

step (adaptation and feasibil ity testing) in a research continuum that will lead to validation of a 
technology -based intervention for improving self -management, symptom management, health 
care utilization and ultimately quality of life among populations of children with complex 
chroni c conditions (CCC) and their caregivers. As such, this project is directly in line with the 
stated core mission of the NIH’s National Institute of Nursing Research.  
     Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a highly complex and challenging chronic disorder that n egatively 
influences quality of life in children and families of those with the disorder. [ADDRESS_1178790] SCD; >90% of these are African American. [ADDRESS_1178791]  
high health care and “other” needs that endure throughout their lifetime, preventive actions are 
necessary in early childhood to avoid or mitigate adverse effects of the disease process. For 
optimal management and minimal adverse effects, persons with SCD  and/or caregivers must 
coordinate appointments with various providers, continuously monitor symptoms, and obtain 
preventive home therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Often, challenges are pronounced early in the disease process as 
caregivers learn about the disease and treatments.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], a multidisciplinary team is 
established and caregivers learn to coordinate and maintain care. However, SCD primarily 
affects an underserved population (i.e., African Americans) who disproportionately face barriers 
such as transportation, obtain ing childcare, and taking time from work. In fact, low -income 
children with SCD have significantly higher hospi[INVESTIGATOR_847892]. [ADDRESS_1178792] not been 
well implemented for children with SCD. Fortunately, assistance with providing reliable sources 
of disease and treatment relat ed information, decision -making, and communication with the 
care team via technology improve family -centered self -management behaviors in older children 
(ages 10 -17 years) with SCD. 10 Assisting families caring for an infant or young child with SCD via 
a similar technology -based model may lead to improved self -management and quality of life 
outcomes. Providing resources via this mechanism may reduce burden a nd maximize outreach 
Version 4.0;    Rev. 09/25/[ADDRESS_1178793] on the individual, family , community, and health care system 
domains. Because this study will focus on children ages birth -7 years and their caregivers, and 
on the caregiver -provider relationship, we will target the family and health care system domains. 
Specific influences, proce sses, and behaviors addressed in this study are outlined in Table 1.

publicly available application for tracking and monitoring pain in SCD that also permits upload 
of symptom logs and text alerts to a health care provider (Voice Crisis Alert). Component 3 
(caregiver -provider communication) is based on Jacob et al. (2013)’s intervention with an 
mHealth intervention f or older children with SCD. This component consists of a technology -
based connection with a provider  who will: respond to alerts delivered via the mHealth 
application, monitor pain symptoms delivered via the mHealth application, and respond to 
messages. A  provider  at the MUSC Pediatric Sickle Cell Clinic will collaborate with caregivers to 
coach caregivers on the care of the child and provide support to the caregiver. 10 Caregivers will 
receive a daily  message using a semi -structured protocol to “check in” with participants and 
promote engagement. All components are integrated into the web -based app. A secure portal is 
in place for messaging that encrypts all  messages and protects confidentiality.  
 
 During Phase I  of this study , using an iterative design process and guided caregiver, child 
and clinician  feedback, we developed and refined the intervention  by [CONTACT_847945][INVESTIGATOR_847893] a target population of end-users. Specific tasks

4.0 Study Endpoints  
Study end points include: Successful study completions, Consent withdrawals, PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_847871] s, Lost contact [CONTACT_10970], and unexpected adverse events.  
 
5.0 Inclu sion and Exclusion Criteria / Study Population  
• Eligible caregiver/child dyads will be identified through the staff at the MUSC 
Pediatric Sickle Cell Clinic. After receiving permission to approach, PI [INVESTIGATOR_847897] 4.0;    Rev. 09/25/[ADDRESS_1178795] the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Screening will be documented in REDCap.   
Inclusion Criteria   
• Children ages 0 – 7 years and parent or primary caregiver 18 years of age 
or older  
• Child with sickle cell disease, as reported by [CONTACT_847946]  
• Parent/caregiver with cognitive disability or delay that precludes ability 
to participate   
• Lack of access to Wi -Fi 
Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
Both women and minorities will be inc luded in the proposed study. Women are more 
often than men reported to be the primary caregiver of children with chronic conditions 
and approximately 66% of caregivers of adults with chronic illness are women. Therefore, 
it is anticipated that more women w ill be recruited as participants than men. In addition, 
SCD occurs almost exclusively in African Americans; therefore, it is anticipated that all or 
nearly all of the caregiver participants will be African American.  
 
Inclusion of Children  
Children ages 0 -7 years will be included as part of the child/caregiver dyad.  Proxy data 
will be collected on children younger than 5 years, and o lder children (ages 5 -7 years) 
without developmental delay will be invited to complete surveys and participate in key 
informant interviews with the caregiver.  
 
6.0 Number of Subjects  
• N=60 – 30 caregivers of 30 children (0 -7 years) with SCD will be recruited.  
 
7.0 Setting  
• The intervention will be used by [CONTACT_847947]. Study visits will occur at MUSC Sickle Cell Unit and via 
telephone to the participant’s home.  
 
8.0 Recruitment Methods  
• Parents/caregivers who participated in Phase I of the study and agreed to be 
re-contact[CONTACT_847923].  
• For other potential participants, the MUSC Pediatric Sickle Cell Clinic staff 
will be given the inc lusion/exclusion criteria and will be asked to identify 
eligible participants in the clinic. When potentially eligible participants attend 
an appointment at the clinic, the clinician/staff will approach the 
parent/caregiver, briefly introduce the study thr ough an IRB approved study 
letter, and if interested ask if the researchers can speak with the 
parent/caregiver to offer additional information. For parents/caregivers who 
Version 4.0;    Rev. 09/25/[ADDRESS_1178796] eligibility screening. Eligible and 
interested parents/caregivers will proceed to the informed consent interview.  
• Additionally, for the purposes of this study and in direct alignment with the 
mission of the CON P20 Symptom Self-Management Center, we will employ 
the use of MUSC Bioinformatics Center (BMIC) core services to identify and 
recruit patients across the MUSC Enterprise that meet the study 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and that have granted authorized research contact  
[CONTACT_847948] ‘opt in’ EPIC designation. Once 
these potentially eligible patients are identified, we will then contact [CONTACT_847949] a script to determine if they are interested in study 
participation  
• Flyers will b e posted in the waiting room and patient rooms at the MUSC 
Sickle Cell Clinic. The flyers will include the PI’s contact [CONTACT_3031]; 
interested parents/caregivers who call the PI [INVESTIGATOR_847874].  
9.0 Consent Process  
Since research will be  conducted with caregiver/child dyads and no research will be conducted 
without the caregiver present, consent will be obtained from the parent/caregiver for both 
him/herself and the child participant  (0-7 years) . In this study, we will employ the use of two 
informed consenting strategies (In -person meeting and electronically through REDCap e -
Consent) so as to increase the reach of the study and to promote the generalizability of findings.  
 
In-person in formed conse nt will occur in the comfort and safety of a private clinic room at the 
MUSC Sickle Cell Unit prior to any screening procedures being conducted and/or data 
collection. Potential participants will be give n the informed consent document  to read and 
review in advance , and/or may have it read to them by [CONTACT_676128]. After 
reviewing the Consent document, both caregiver and child will be given the opportunity to ask 
any questions about the study that they may have, and will be requested to demo nstrate what is 
expected from them should they enroll in the study through a questioning of their 
understanding of study procedures and risks. Prior to consenting, all questions will be resolved 
to the caregiver and child's satisfaction. If a participant d oes not appear to understand the 
information contained within the Consent document, the study coordinator will review the 
consent document again with the participant. If after this second review, the subject does not 
demonstrate an understanding, they will  not be enrolled in the study. Only participants, with no 
diagnosed or observed cognitive impairment, will be consented and enrolled into the study.  
 
Electronic or e -Consenting will be performed on eligible families that want to participate in the 
study b ut are unwilling for whatever reason and/or unable to come to MUSC for a face -to-face 
informed consent meeting. Families identified through the study recruitment processes that fall 
into this category will already have spoken with the researchers by [CONTACT_199097], have been 
introduced to the study and its demands, as well as had their initial questions answered. After 
speaking with the researchers, families that are further interested in study participation will be 
asked to provide an email address at which the y will receive a REDCap survey link containing a 
scanned image of the currently approved Informed Consent document (developed from the 
MUSC REDCap e -consent template). Families will be able to take as much time as they like to 
read the consent document tog ether in the comfort and privacy of their own home or at a place 
and time of their choosing. They will be provided with the telephone and email contact [CONTACT_847950], should they have any questions before 
Version 4.0;    Rev. 09/25/18 
 Page 9 of 17  prov iding their consent by [CONTACT_676130]. Prior 
to providing their physical e -consent, the researchers will coordinate with these families; so as to 
be on the telephone and be available to further answer any q uestions that they may have during 
the e -consent process. Should a participant have any questions or concerns about the study, the 
researchers will address these issues to the best of their abilities and knowledge. Upon 
submitting the e -consent, a REDCap t rigger will immediately notify the researchers, who will 
then provide their countersignature [CONTACT_187291].  
 
The consent form will meet the requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations and the MUSC 
Institutional Review Board; and, include the following elements:  
1. The purpose, nature, and objectives, potential risks and benefits of the intended study.  
2. The len gth of study and the likely follow -up required.  
3. The name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a contact [CONTACT_6823](s) responsible for the protocol.  
4. The right of the participant to accept or refuse study interactions and to withdraw from 
participation at any time.  
 
The HIPPA  authorization process will be conducted sequentially with the family in the same 
manner by [CONTACT_41314].  Participants will be able to download a copy of their executed 
informed e-consent/HIPAA authorization forms directly to their own computer , or have  copi[INVESTIGATOR_847898]. They will also be given the option to have a copy of their executed e -forms 
mailed to them should they elect to do so. A copy of the executed e -consent /HIPAA 
authorization forms will also be stored in the participant's electronic case record for  monitoring 
and audit purposes.  
 
10.0  Study Design  / Methods  
The mHealth SCD management intervention will be delivered via an app on the caregiver ’s 
mobile device over a 12 -week period. This multi -component, web -based app consists  of 1.) 
continuous access to directed educational resources on the SCD process, treatment, home 
management strategies, symptom prevention and management strategies; 2.) a series of pages in 
the app that allow for tracking and monitoring symptoms; and 3.) c hild/caregiver – provider 
communication. The educational component is based on patient -centered materials that have 
been developed and tested by [CONTACT_676116]. In the app, educational materials are 
organized by [CONTACT_847929] (for individuals with SCD) o r role for parents/caregivers. Citations are 
provided and links to the sources are included. The symptom tracking and monitoring 
component consists of a customizable avatar on which the user can record the location, severity, 
and characteristics of pain. U sers can record other concurrent or associated symptoms (such as 
fatigue) and can view a graph with the pain history. This portion of the app also includes a 
health history page on which users can document important clinical information, such as sickle 
cell type, last sickle cell crisis hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], medications, and allergies. The child/caregiver – 
provider communication component consists of the ability for the child/caregiver to send a 
secure message to providers within the app to communicate pain and  other symptoms. 
Providers will have the capability to securely send a reply within the app. In addition, 
children/caregivers can choose to receive a daily “support” message that will be automatically 
sent from a list of possible messages. All communicatio n is encrypted and sent securely within 
the app via a portal. Two to three providers at the MUSC Sickle Cell Clinic will participate as the 
designated providers in the study.  
 
To determine feasibility, we will apply the RE -AIM framework to assess the Reach, Efficacy, 
Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance of the intervention with 30 children/caregiver 
dyads. 18 The domains are further explicated in Table 2. The  intervention will be loaded onto the 
Version 4.0;    Rev. 09/25/18 
 Page 10 of 17  caregivers ’ tablet or smartphone (Apple or Android);  participants without a device will be 
provided one for the duration of the study . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_847899]. Caregivers  will also receive written 
instructions and a contact [CONTACT_847951]. Baseline measures (Table 
2) wil l be collected during the same meeting. Caregivers  will retain the devices and will 
participate in the intervention over a [ADDRESS_1178797] -intervention  meeting with each individual caregiver part icipant  during which  
data will be collected . Caregivers will also be asked to return the mobile device  at the end of the 
study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_847900].  
 
Retention: To improve retention, IRB-approved personnel will contact [CONTACT_847931] 
3-week intervals between data collection points. The timeline for these points of contact [CONTACT_847952]: weeks 3, 9, 15, 18, and 21. The purpose is to 
maintain contact [CONTACT_808340], not data collection. Correspondence will be logged 
in REDCap. Contact [CONTACT_847932], using the number(s) provided to study 
personnel upon enrollment. Exam ples of messages are provided in an upl oaded attachment.  
 
 
Post -intervention interviews. At the end of the [ADDRESS_1178798] -intervention key informant interviews 
with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_847901] -depth data on accessi bility, usability, and adherence to 
intervention ; however, only [ADDRESS_1178799] approximately 45 -60 minutes, and will be conducted according to an 
interview guide with open -ended questions and prompts. These interviews will be audio 
recorded for later nVivo qualitative data analysis. Selected caregivers will be given the option of 
having the interview conducted in -person  in a private room at MUSC  or by [CONTACT_847953].  
 
Reimbursement for dyads wil l be a $[ADDRESS_1178800] provided at each of the 4 data collection points, 
with dyads in key informant interviews receiving an additional $[ADDRESS_1178801]. All payments will 
be given to the caregiver.  
 
Measures. Older c hildren (5-7 years) and their caregivers will complete age-appro priate self-
report and proxy assessments at baseline, mid-intervention (6 weeks), post -intervention  (12 
weeks) , and [ADDRESS_1178802] -intervention as previously described . Self-report and proxy 
assessments will be collected during meetings between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_847877]. 
Depending on participants’ preference  and availability visit 2, 3  and 4 surveys will be completed 
either by [CONTACT_847954]. All data will be 
recorded in REDCap by [CONTACT_289278].

12.0  Data Management   
Sample size considerations  
The purpose of this study is to establish feasibility of implementing the integrated intervention 
obtain estimates of variability for the primary outcome measures and obtain preliminary 
indicators of effectiveness of the intervention rather than to confirm  or refute hypotheses. 
Version 4.0;    Rev. 09/25/[ADDRESS_1178803] that we will be able to recruit 30 child/caregiver dyads. With such a sample we will be 
able to estimate outcome proportion s for feasibility measures including recruitment and drop -
out with precision ±0.11 to ±0.16 for values of the true proportion ranging from 0.10 to 0.30 (or 
correspondingly, from 0.70 to 0.90). Assuming a drop -out rate of up to 30%, 95% confidence 
limits ca n be estimated for impact measures, such as change from pre -to-post in quality of life 
for child and caregiver with a precision ranging from ±0.43 to ±1.[ADDRESS_1178804] deviations for change in quality of life scores ranging from 0.5  to 5.0 SD units.  
 
Demographic and clinical variables obtained at baseline will be described via measures of 
central tendency (mean, median), variability and frequency distributions as appropriate. 
Additionally, demographic and clinical characteristics for  those who adhered to the study 
protocol (study completers) versus those who did not adhere (non -adherers and drop -outs) will 
be compared to better describe the population for this study. For continuous quality of life 
measures for the child and caregiver the difference between pre and post intervention 
measurements will be estimated via 95% confidence intervals. To assess preliminary 
intervention effects, we will conduct repeated measures ANCOVA with symptom (pain) severity 
and type obtained daily as depen dent variable in individual models adjusting for “dose” defined 
as number of times education module was accessed and total time spent in education modules.  
 
Post -intervention qualitative analyses (Aim 2):  Data collected from post -intervention key 
informant  interviews will be analyzed using directed content analysis [ADDRESS_1178805] the RE -AIM domains.  
 
Data sharing with the NINR/ NIH: As a condition of this National Institutes of Nursing 
Research (NINR) award, de-identified patient data  will be shared by [CONTACT_847955] a n NIH  password protected secure server  
(https://cdrns.nih. gov/ ). The purpose of sharing this information is to build a NINR repository 
of data using Common Data Elements (CDE) for future research purposes among the general 
scientific community and for public health benefit. Patients will be allocated a random ide ntifier 
through the NIH supported GUID Tool. The GUID Tool (https://cdrns.nih.gov/node/39)  is a 
customized software application that generates a Global Unique Identifier for each study 
participant. The GUID is a subject ID that allows researchers to share data specific to a study 
participant without exposing personally identifiable information (PII). The GUID is made up of 
random alpha -numeric characters and is NOT generated from PII/PHI. As such, it has  been 
approved by [CONTACT_187258].   GUID Generation complies with HIPPA 
regulations for the protection of PII/PHI.  Patients are made aware of this data sharing 
agreement with the NINR/NIH in the study’s Informed Consent document.  
 
13.0 Pr ovisions to Monitor the Data and Ensure the Safety of Subjects

Protecting Confidentiality of Participant Data  
Version 4.0;    Rev. 09/25/[ADDRESS_1178806], gather, 
and enter required  data (written informed consent, HIPAA Authorization, and demographics) 
onto study data forms. Screened  patients who do not meet  study eligibility will have specific  
screening data entered  into the study database. The collected data will be helpful in examining 
the patient population  and feasibility of  enrollment  criteria and  will include reason for exclusion. 
All dates will be shifted and other Personal Health Information  (PHI) will be removed from the 
study database upon study completion. All data obtained from this study will be used for 
research purposes only and will comply with Federal HIPAA regulations.  Master Screening and 
Enrollment Logs will be maintai ned by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_847906].  
 
Case Report Forms. All proposed study specific case report forms (source documents) for 
data collection will be designed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238], w hen possible, transferred by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_847907] (eCRFs) for use in the study’s REDCap database. These study 
specific eCRFs source documents (study logs for correspondence, compensation and other forms 
such as pre -eligibility scr eens) will be coded by [CONTACT_47991]’s  unique study ID# for all data 
collected including study instruments  will be maintained in  the participant research record.  
Completed instruments  that require  signature  [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a paper  CRF will be scanned  and uploaded int o 
the study database to all for remote electronic safety monitoring as well as maintained on file in 
accordance with MUSC policies and applicable Federal  Regulations  for the Conduct of Human 
Participant Research.  
 
Binders . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_847884] a  participant -specific binder for each  
participant containing  all non-eCRFs records. A regulatory file will also be maintained to include 
the IRB -approved Protocol, original Informed Consent documents, HIPAA forms and other 
study -related  regulatory documents.  All paper research records and CRFs will be maintained in  
a locked file cabinet, stored in a room for research files that is accessible only via a password 
protected entry system that features security cameras, within the College  of Nursing.  Access to 
the research records, study database and PHI’s will be restricted to study  personnel  as approved  
by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_187212].  As with all studies conducted at MUSC, this study is  also eligible for a 
random  audit by [CONTACT_847958].  
 
Data Pro cessing.  This study will use Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) for data 
capture and management. REDCap is a software toolset and workflow methodology for the 
electronic collection and management of research and clinical trials data. REDCap provides  
secure, web -based, flexible applications, including real -time validation rules with automated 
data type and range checks at the time of data entry. Exports are made available for several 
statistical packages including SPSS, SAS, SATA, R and Microsoft Exce l. The study -specific 
REDCap electronic database will be designed and developed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_847908].  The provision of REDCap is made available through the South Carolina Clinical & 
Translational Research (SCTR) Institute at MUSC with  NIH Grant awards UL1RR029882 and 
UL1TR000062.  
 
Data Security . Ensuring data security, compliance with [ADDRESS_1178807] Operating Procedures (SOP) to  ensure a 
high level of data security whil e coordinating electronic  and paper data management activities 
for clinical research trials. The REDCap study database will be hosted in the Biomedical 
Informatics secure data center at MUSC, a secure environment for data systems and servers on 
campus, and  includes firewall, redundancy, failover capability, backups and extensive security 
Version 4.0;    Rev. 09/25/[ADDRESS_1178808] access control; only authorized core personnel may 
access the facility un -escorted. Only authorized users are allowed to connect t o the network, and 
the security of the network is actively monitored.  Power and environmental controls have 
several layers of backups, from interruptible power supplies to alternate and redundant feeds to 
the local utility company. The REDCap system admin istrator contributes to the maintenance of 
institutional disaster recovery and business continuity plans.  Load balancers and a highly fault 
tolerant SAN infrastructure contribute to high availability.  
 
The REDCap system itself has several additional laye rs of protection including password 
protection. Access to the data and its security is managed institutionally by [CONTACT_847959] a Shibboleth login with an MUSC issued NetID and features a user account 
management filter that controls who can a ccess the data and to what degree. All personnel must 
pass an employment background check before being issued an ID. Password complexity, history 
and expi[INVESTIGATOR_187213]. Access to individual 
REDCap projects and their data is managed by [CONTACT_187268]. All transactions are 
securely delivered to the application using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL – SHA -1 with RSA 
Encryption; 2048 -bits). It is then transmitted internally (behind the firewall) to the database 
server. All transactions are logged at the server layer (httpd logging), application layers 
(REDCap logs activity to a database table), and the database layer, using both query and binary 
logging. This feature provides audit trails for all changes, queries,  data exports and reports. 
MUSC Information security policies are available at: https://mainweb -
v.musc.edu/security/policy/   
 
Data Entry . Only MUSC IRB approved study personnel  that are authorized to have  access to 
the REDCap study database will be granted  password access. Study personnel using computers 
that are connected to the Internet will directly enter data into the remotely housed database. As 
such, no electronic study data will be  stored on hard drives and/or any portable electronic 
devices. Additionally, all personnel with access to the database will have current University of 
Miami CITI and GCP training in the Conduct of Human Subject Protections, and HIPAA and 
Information Securi ty trainings that are completed annually. Each participant will be assigned a 
unique study identifier, all PHIs will be masked, and data exports will be limited to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_847909].  
 
Data Monitoring . Ongoing quality control procedures will  be implemented for data collection,  
storage and  processing. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_847910] a report for review at team meetings. Standing agenda items for these me etings will 
include participant recruitment and retention, AE’s, protocol deviations, data integrity and 
overall study conduct. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_847911]. 
Discrepancies that warrant clarification  will be sent  to approp riate  parties for review and 
resolution. All data entry and changes made in the study database by [CONTACT_847960], and provide  a transparent visible  audit trail for 
reviewers.

Version Date: 05March2020_Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_267789] spectrum  of ocular inflammatory diseases  which are associated with 
both systemic infectious and non -infectious conditions.  Non-infectious uveitis, a potentially 
blinding condition that is the fifth leading cause of visual loss in the developed world (thir d 
leading cause of preventable blindness), has been estimated to account for 10% of all visual 
impairment in the western world  and 10–15% of cases of total blindness [Nussenblatt, 1990; 
Merida et al., 2015 ].  
The inflammation associated with uveitis affects the uvea  of the eye  (iris, ciliary body and 
choroid) and it is characterized by [CONTACT_222792], recurrent, chronic 
or acute -on-chronic. Untreated, recurrent bouts of uveitis eventually  lead to tissue destruction 
from direct inflammation or from complications such as cataract, glaucoma and macular edema. 
Clinically, uveitis manifestations include pain, blurry vision, conjunctival hyperemia, anterior 
chamber cells, anterior chamber flare,  fibrin deposition and corneal endothelial inflammatory 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_14263].  
Uveitis may affect either the anterior or the posterior segment or in the case of panuveitis, it 
affects the entire eye.  Anterior uveitis, which specifically refers to uveitis in the an terior 
segment of the eye, is the most common and accounts for approximately 80% of non -infectious 
uveitis cases in the [LOCATION_002] [ Thorne et al., 2016 ].   
The present clinical trial evaluates the treatment  of non-infectio us anterior uveitis with TRS01 . 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_222783] -infectious anterior uveitis and 
postoperative inflammation  [Kim et al., 2019 ]. The side effects associated with steroid use 
significantly limit prolonged treatment. The most common adverse effects of ocular steroids are 
cataract and elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP) which can lead to steroid related glaucoma.  
Given the limitations of steroid treatment , there is a n unmet medical  need for a n effective anti -
inflammatory drug that does not have an IOP -elevating effect  or cause the formation of cataracts . 
Tarsius Pharma , Ltd.  has developed a novel therapeutic approach for local preventio n and 
treatment of ophthalmic inflammatory diseases.  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
TRS is the active drug substance of TRS01 which is an  drug product 
candidate developed for topi[INVESTIGATOR_222784] (eye drops) .  Pre-clinical studies have 
demonstrat ed the safety and tolerability of TRS01.

Eligible subjects will be randomized in  a 1:1 ratio to receive TRS01 -  or TRS01  on Day 
1. 
Randomization will occur after subjects m eet all eligibility requirements at Screening Day 
1/Visit 1. Each subject will be assigned a unique subject number.  
Each kit package  will contain  a kit number that can be later co rrelated 
to the subject number and treatment assignment at the site.   
 
The randomization codes and all data sets will be stored in a secure area accessible only to 
delegated study personnel and only released on completion of the study and after the study 
database has been locked.  
In this study all parties are to be masked to the allocated treatment; sponsor, investigators, study 
staff  and subjects . At the site, there will be designated unmasked study staff that will train the 
subject  on all study procedures  related to  IP administration . 
In emergency situations for reasons of subject  safety (e.g.  serious unexpected /unlisted drug 
related event;  medical emergency;  potentially life-threatening  drug interaction)  the masking  code 
may need to be broken. In those cases, whenever  possible,  a request for unmasking  should be 
discussed with the sponsor prior to unmasking . Detailed instruction on the method for breaking 
the mask  will be provided during site training and noted in the Investigator  study file.  
Following the first IP administration, if the subject  perceives any AE that may be attributed to 
the IP, these should be reported to the unmasked  site personnel.   
4.3 INFORMED  CONSENT   
Prior to undergoing any study -related activity, th e Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee will 
discuss  the purpose and pertinent details of the study with each potentially eligible subject . The 
explanation w ill be  sufficiently detailed to allow the subject  to make an informed decision to 
participate in the study. If the subject  is willing to participate in the study, he/she w ill be 
requested to give written informed consent. A copy of the Informed Consent Form ( ICF) will be  
signed by [CONTACT_222794] [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her designee . 
The signed and dated ICF w ill be  retained with the study records, and a copy of the signed and 
dated ICF w ill be  given to the subject .

5.2 WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA  / EARLY TERMINATION  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, without jeopardizing 
their medical care. Where possible , subjects  will be followed for safety and encouraged to return 
for follow -up vis its for any unresolved safety events.  
In addition, the Investigator or Tarsius’  Medical Officer c an discontinue a subject  from further 
study medication administration for other reasons related to the best interest of the subject . 
If a subject  is discontinued from study and/or study medication administration at any point of the 
Treatment Period, he or she will be  encouraged to remain in the study for follow up through Visit 
7 (Week 10).   
The reason a subject  discontinued from the study is to be c learly described on the Study Exit 
electronic case report form ( eCRF ). 
Subjects  who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  Subjects  who withdraw from the study  
prior to Visit 7 (Week 10)  will be asked to complete all procedures outlined in Visit 7 (Week 10).

welfare that does not interfere with the evaluation of the study medication will be permitted to be 
given at the discretion of the Principal Investigator .   
The decision to administer a prohibited medication or treatment would be taken with the safety 
of the subject  as the primary consideration. Whenever possible, the Tarsius  Medical Director will 
be notified before any prohibited medications or treatments are administered. The Tarsius  
Medical Monitor  should also be contact[CONTACT_222797] a specific medication or 
treatment is in question.   
Any subject placed on rescue therapy will discontinue use of the IP and continue study 
participation through V isit 7. 
 
 Subjects on rescue ther apy due to lack of 
efficacy should not be withdrawn from the study, but rather followed through the end of the 
study.  
Rescued subjects experiencing an AE at the time of rescue will be followed through stabilization 
or resolution of the AE or the end of the study (whichever comes first).  
The following medications are also specifically permitted during the trial:   
• Glaucoma eye drops with the exclusion of Prostaglandins .  Note:  subjects may be treated 
with up to two glaucoma eye drops in the study eye.  Anti-glaucoma eye drops should be

course of the trial  and the dosing and regimen should remain stable  through Visit 5 (end of 
IP treatment  period ).   
6.3 RESCUE MEDICATION USE  
Rescue medications will be administered  in cas es detailed in  section 7.2.2 . Rescue therapy will 
be defined as any treatment (above the permitted dosages outlined in the eligibility criteria and in 
Section 6.2) that would have a therapeutic effect on inflammation  in the anterior  segment , other 
than the IP (e.g., systemic treatment with an immunosuppressant agent, ocular injectio n of 
steroids, or topi[INVESTIGATOR_73204] s in the study eye), regardless of the purpose of administration 
and whether it was recorded as a rescue therapy on the eCRF .  
The addition or increase in s ystemic immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., methotrexate, 
cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, 
azathioprine, or adalimumab) or other therapy considered as a rescue therapy, would be 
administered based on the Investi gator’s best judgment and only after discussion  with Tarsius’ 
Medical Director.

An AE w ill be  considered as an ocular AE  if the Investigator select s ‘OD’, ‘OS’, or ‘OU’ for the 
AE eCRF field “Eye (s) affected”.  
Any AE that causesloss of vision of 15 or more letters (i.e., 3 lines) should be recorded as a 
serious adverse event ( SAE ). Examples include endophthalmitis, retinal vascular occlusion, 
retinal detachment involving the macula/fovea, etc. AEs that cause loss of 15 or more letters  (i.e., 
3 lines)  that are expected to resolve should not be recorded as an SAE .  Examples include 
corneal edema, corneal abrasion, cystoid macular edema or other condition s that are known to 
affect vision but expected to resolve and not results in a permanent impact on vision.   
7.2.2 Criteria for Rescue Therapy   
Rescue therapy will be offered if one or more of the following rescue criteria are met and a 
rescue therapy treatment p lan is discussed with the Tarsius  Medical Officer : 
• If visual acuity  in the study eye  decreases by >2 lines compared to baseline , which in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], is due to non -infectious anterior uveitis . 
•  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
If rescue therapy is initiated, the subject will be instructed to discontinue IP.  The choice of 
rescue therapy will be at the discretion of the Investigator.  If rescue therapy is administered, the 
gener ic name, indication, route of administration, frequency, dose, start date, and stop date  (if 
applicable) w ill be recorded on the eCRF. In addition, if other local therapy  (i.e., periocular or

also be recorded on the eCRF.  
Any medication administered on Visit 5 ( Day 28) after the subject has exited  the study will not 
be considered as rescue therapy.  
 
If possible, during the visit where rescue therapy is initiated, Macular OCT should be performed 
for the study eye.  
 
7.2.3 Other Safety Variables  
Other safety measures are discussed in section  7.2 above.  
 
7.3 ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS  
 
Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
investigational product in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
 
Adverse Reaction (AR) : any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions whe re there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) :  
Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes 
of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means the re is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the AE. A SAR implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
 
Unexpected: An AE or SAR is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the Investigator’s 
Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an 
Investigator’s Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general invest igational plan or elsewhere in the current application.  
  
Life-threatening: An AE or SAR is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.  
 
A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) is any AE or suspected adverse reaction occurring at 
any dose that:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening.  
GADOT 20/20 Trial   002 Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 05March2020_Protocol  Amendment 01    
Tarsius Pharma Ltd .                                               CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 53 • Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defe ct.  
• Is a significant medical event (i.e., one that may jeopardize the subject or may require 
intervention to prevent one or more of the other outcomes listed above).  
 
A NON -SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT is any AE that does not meet the definitions for SAEs 
as de scribed above.  
 
Each AE will be classified as SERIOUS or NON -SERIOUS using the definitions provided 
above.  
 
The SEVERITY of each AE will be classified as MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE.  
The Investigator will review each event and assess its RELATIONSHIP to use of 
investigational product (unrelated, probably, definitely). The AE will be assessed using the 
following definitions :  
 
Unrelated:  
• Event occurring before dosing.  
• Event  easily exp lained by [CONTACT_222800].  
• Event or intercurrent illness due wholly to factors other than investigational product 
use.  
 
Probable:  
• Reasonable temporal relationship with investigational product use.  
• Likely to be known reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by [CONTACT_7552].  
• Event cannot easily be explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state or other factors.  
 
Definite:  
• Distinct temporal relationship with investigational product use.  
• Known reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by [CONTACT_25046].  
• Event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state or other factors.  
 
7.4 PROCEDURES FOR AE REPORTING BY [CONTACT_222801], date and time of resolution, severity, seriousness, causality (relationship to use of 
investigational product), treatment required, and the outcome.  
 
To elicit AEs, simple questions with minimal suggestions or implications should be used as the 
initial questions at all evaluation points during the trial. For example:  
• How have you felt since your last assessment?  
GADOT 20/20 Trial   002 Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 05March2020_Protocol  Amendment 01    
Tarsius Pharma Ltd .                                               CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 53 • Have you had any health problems since your last assessment?  
 
The severity of each AE should be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe.  
 
The causality of use of investigational product in relation to the A E will be assessed by [CONTACT_222802], probable, or 
definite.  
 
If an AE occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or treat as deemed appropriate. If a 
non-SAE is unresolved at the  time of the last day of the study, an effort will be made to follow 
up until the AE is resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or there is some other 
resolution of the event.  
 
7.5 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING BY [CONTACT_222803] a designee within 24 hours of the event being brought to the Investigators’ or their 
staffs’ attention. It is als o the responsibility of the Investigator to report all SAEs reported at their

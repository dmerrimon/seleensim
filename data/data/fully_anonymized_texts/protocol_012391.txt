Title of Study   
A Phase 2 , Open -Label , Cross-over Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy  of Avexitide in Acquired 
Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia  
Protocol Number:  [ZIP_CODE] 
 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
Hyperinsulin emic Hypoglycemia (H H) is a rare but growing disease state characterized by [CONTACT_431689][INVESTIGATOR_431681], with glucose concentrations low 
enough (<54 mg/dL) to cause seizures, altered mental status, loss of consciousness, cognitive 
dysfunction, disability, and possibly deat h. The predominant form of HH is post -bariatric 
hypoglycemia (PBH), which occurs in some 29-39% of patients undergoing Roux-en -Y gastric by[CONTACT_6476] 
(RYGB) and 10-23% of those undergoing vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) (1-4) . HH can also  occur 
as a complication of other upper -gastrointestinal procedures, including esophagectomy (5), 
gastrectomy  (6), and Nissen fundoplication (7). Currently,  there are  no effective medical therap ies for 
patients with HH. 
 
The mechanisms mediating PBH and other forms of HH  that occur after gastrointestinal procedures 
have long been debated, though excessive postprandial secretion of the incretin gut hormone, 
glucagon-like peptide -1 (GLP -1), has been shown to play a c ritical  role in mediating hyperinsulinism 
(5-6,8 -10). Avexitide is a specific, competitive antagonist of the GLP -1 receptor  formed by [CONTACT_431690] 8 N -terminus amino acids from exenatide (commercial name [CONTACT_74994][CONTACT_28557]), a GLP -[ADDRESS_546085] . Prior studies conducted by [CONTACT_431691] ( 7, 11-13) or 
subcutaneous (14-16 ) administration of avexitide have shown normalization of postprandial insulin 
concentrations  with reduction in the  occurrence and severity of hypoglycemia and associated 
symptoms.  
 The most recent study in which our lab oratory participated, the PREVENT study (16 ), was a Phase 2, 
randomized, placebo -controlled crossover study evaluating two dosing regimens of avexitide (30 mg 
BID and 60 mg QD)  in 18 patients with diet-refractory PBH. In this study, 18 participants received 
placebo injections for 14 days followed by [CONTACT_431692] 30 mg BID and avexitide 60 mg QD, each for 14 
days in random order. The primary outcome was glucose nadir during mixed meal tolerance testing (MMTT ) at the end of each 14 -day treatment period. In addition,  hypoglycemic events captured by 
[CONTACT_51964], eDiary, and blinded continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) were captured. T he primary and 
secondary endpoints were met by [CONTACT_431693]. Compared to placebo, avexitide 30 mg BID and 60 mg QD raised the plasma glucose nadir by 21% ( p=0.001) and 26% ( p=0.0002) and lowered the 
insulin peak by 23% ( p=0.029) and 21% ( p=0.042), corresponding to 50% and 75%  fewer participants 
requiring rescue, respectively. Significant reductions in outpatient rates of Levels 1 -3 hypoglycemia  
were observed , defined, respectively, as SMBG<70 mg/dL, SMBG<54 mg/dL, and a severe event 
characterized by [CONTACT_226405]/or physical function requiring assistance. Blinded CGM demonstrat ed reductions in hypoglycemia without induction of clinically relevant hyperglycemia. 
Avexitide was well -tolerated, with no increase in adverse events.

solution ) will be dispensed by [CONTACT_2953] V4 . Participants will be given written and oral 
instructions on how to store, draw up  and safely administered study drug. The study drug will be 
administered as subcutaneous injections either once daily in the morning (90 mg QD), or twice daily 
(45 mg BID): once in the morning and the second daily dose approximately [ADDRESS_546095] AND ASSESSMENTS  
 
Screening Procedures  
Patients providing written informed consent will be evaluated to determine eligibility to participate in 
the study. An initial eligibility review will be conducted, including:  
• review of medical history and concomitant medications  
• review of Level 2  and Level 3  hypoglycemia event rate (<54 mg/dL by [CONTACT_431698] 3 
hypoglycemia ) during Run -In 
• review of clinical lab results  
Page 8 • pregnancy testing (as applicable)  
The preliminary eligibility assessments may be performed up to 90 days prior to randomization, 
consisting of a 14-day Baseline Run-in period during which the following items will be supplied 
concurrent with training:  
• eDiary  
• dietary  guidelines (describes SOC medical nutrition therapy)  
• glucometer, lancets and test strips  
• Dexcom G6PRO  
 
Study Schedule  
The screening period comprises:  
• Visit 1 (Zoom ): Informed Consent, r eview of medical history,  hypoglycemia questionnaire,  
concomitant medications, assessment of preliminary eligibility  
• Visit 2 (Zoom) : training on patient eDiary, glucometer use , and  Dexcom G6PRO application 
and activation . Participants begin 14-day Run-In Period  
• Visit 3 (Zoom): Check in with patient.  
• On day [ADDRESS_546096] a new Dexcom G6PRO sensor . 
• Visit 4 (SHC) : On day  [ADDRESS_546097], an ADA draw,  and CMP as applicable then  consume a standardized liquid mixed meal 
over 10 minutes, with fingerstick  glucose checks every 30 minutes for a total of 180 minutes. 
Eligible  participants are then enroll ed, randomiz ed and dispens ed study drug.  
Enrolled participants will be randomized 1:1 to one of 2 avexitide dosing regimen orders, and 
will be trained on study medication injection procedures. Avexitide should be injected 
subcutaneously either once daily in the morning, or twice daily; once in the morning and the 
second daily dose approximately 12 hours later. During once daily administration ( avexitide 9 0 
mg QD), morning dosing will occur at least [ADDRESS_546098] morning meal. During twice daily administration (avexitide 45 mg BID) morning dosing will not be relative to the timing of the first meal of the day.  Thro ughout, patients will follow currently accepted dietary 
guidelines for treatment of PBH . 
• Visit 5 (Zoom): Participants are train ed on study drug injection; initiate  Treatment Period [ADDRESS_546099] new Dexcom G6PRO device.  
• Day 10 of Treatment Period 1: Participants  place a new Dexcom G6PRO device.   
• Visit 6 (SHC):  On day [ADDRESS_546100] their final Treatment Period 1 study drug injection  and 90 minutes later consume a 
standardized mixed meal over 10 minutes, with fingerstick glucose checks every 30 minutes for 180 minutes. Participants are dispens ed new study drug and initiate a 2-day washout 
period.  
• Day 4 of Treatment Period 2: Particip ants place a new Dexcom G6PRO device.  
• Visit 7 (SHC): On day [ADDRESS_546101] their final Treatment Period 2 study drug injection  and 90 minutes later participants 
consume a standardized mixed meal over 10 minutes, with fingerstick glucose checks every 30 minutes for a total of 180 minutes. Participants then  remove their  Dexcom sensor/transmitter  
and return their used/unused study drug vials.  
 
Page [ADDRESS_546102] ructed to check fingerstick glucose concentrations whenever they experience 
hypoglycemic symptoms. Patients will also enter into the eDiary all SMBG glucose values obtained 
during consumption of the 3 standardized liquid mea ls. Study  personnel will train participants on the 
use of the eDiary and glucometer.  
 
Blinded Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)  
During the Run-In phase, a Dexcom Mobile G6 Pro Continuous Glucose Monitoring System in blinded 
mode (i.e., the CGM device) will be issued to potential study participants. Each participant will be trained on its use in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Written instructions for CGM use and maintenance will be provided. The instructions will, if necessary, be repeated at site visits. The 
data from CGM will be downloaded after Run-In and at the end of each 14-day period for enrolled 
subjects. Each device will be blinded for use during the study. The Dexcom Mobile G6 Pro CGM System must be removed before magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, or high-frequency electrical heat (diathermy) treatment.  
 Dietary Treatment  
All patients will be expected to follow accepted dietary treatment guidelines for PBH throughout the 
study including during the  Run-In period. Guidelines provided include limiting dietary carbohydrates 
to no more than [ADDRESS_546103]  
At the end  of each study period (Run-In, Treatment Periods 1  and 2), participants will consume a 
standardized liquid meal (e.g., Boost Nutritional Drink)  over [ADDRESS_546104] glucose values in the 
eDiary.

Quality of Life Assessment s 
The Short -Form (36) Health Survey (SF -36v2) , EQ-5D, Hypoglycemia Fear Survey-II (HSF -II), and 
Hypoglycemia Confidence S cale (HSC) are patient -reported outcomes measures that enrolled patients 
will complete via RedCap survey at the end of the Run -In period and at the end of each of study 
period.  Clinical Laboratory Tests A urine pregnancy test as applicable, a complete metabolic panel (unless assessed within the 6 months 
prior ), and blood sample s for ADA will be obtained. Any out of range laboratory results should be 
assessed for clinical significance with study entry eligibility at the discretion of the PI.   Safety Assessments  Safet y assessments will consist of monitoring and recording adverse events (AEs ) and serious adverse 
events ( SAEs ). The investigator will carefully monitor each subject throughout the study for possible 
AEs. Patients enrolled into this study have hypoglycemia and severe hypoglycemic events due to their 
disease state. Thus, hypoglycemia and severe hypoglycemic events are expected and captured as 
endpoints. Hypoglycemia will  therefore not be captured as an AE, whereas consequences of 
hypoglycemia , such as loss of consciousness or seizure, may be reported as an AE.  
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_431684]: If a study participant experiences an SAE that is determined by [CONTACT_431699], study drug may be 
discontinued for that participant.

Page 11 Criteria for Evaluation  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
• The primary endpoint i s the baseline-adjusted number  of diurnal  Level 2 hypoglycemia  events 
(ADA, <54 mg/dL) as measured by [CONTACT_431700] <54 mg/dL during diurnal hours ( 8am-10pm) within  each 
treatment period  divided by [CONTACT_431701] a given treatment period, then normalized to 
duration of 1 4 days.  The baseline-adjusted number  of diurnal Level 2 hypoglycemia  events 
during 14 days of avexitide treatment (Treatment Periods 1 and 2 ) and [ADDRESS_546106] of 
care treatment (Run-In Period) will be calculated and examined in a mixed -effect model, 
including treatment, treatment sequence, treatment period, and surgery type stratum (RYGB 
vs. Others) as fixed effect, and subject -within -sequence as random effect. The least squares 
(LS) mean, the standard error (SE), the 2 -sided 95% confidence interval (CI), and the p-value 
will be derived from the mixed-effect model for each active treatment. No multiplicity 
adjustment is planned, and the primary endpoint will be evaluated through the nominal p-
values. P<0.05 is considered statistically significant.  
Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints include the following:  
• Rate of Level [ADDRESS_546107] epi[INVESTIGATOR_431686] 2 
hypoglycemia  (SMBG glucose <54 mg/dL) , divided by [CONTACT_431701] a given treatment 
period, then normalized to duration of 14 days.  
• Rate of Level 3 hypoglycemia ( severe hypoglycemia ), defined as the number of severe events 
during each treatment period characterized by [CONTACT_226405]/or physical functioning that 
requires assistance from another person for recovery, divided by [CONTACT_431701] a given 
treatment period , then normalized to duration of 14 days. This applies regardless of whether a 
patient actually receives external assistance. Since the categorization of a severe hypoglycemia 
event can be subjective, particularly in cases where severe neuroglycopenic symptoms/signs 
occurred and external assistance was needed but was not received, all potential qualifying severe hypoglycemia events will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_458].  
• Percent diurnal time <54 mg/dL, defined as the percentage of CGM values <54  mg/dL during 
daytime hours  (8am-10pm) within  each treatment period, normalized to 14 days.  
• The magnitude of postprandial hypoglycemia, defined as the glucose nadir as measured by 
[CONTACT_431702] [ADDRESS_546108] of care (Treatment Periods 1 and 
2) will be compared to during standard of care (Run -In). Particularly, the baseline -adjusted 
plasma glucose nadir  will be calculated for each patient and evaluated.  
Secondary endpoints will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary efficacy endpoint.   
 
Exploratory Endpoints  
• QoL as measured by [CONTACT_67307] 36 v2, EQ -5D, HSF -II, and HCS.  
• Rate of hypoglycemia, defined as  the number of distinct epi[INVESTIGATOR_431687] 
<70 mg/dL divided by [CONTACT_431701] a given treatment period, then normalized to 
duration of 14 days.  
Page 12 • Percent time >250 mg/dL, defined as the percentage of CGM values >250 mg/dL during each 
treatment period, normalized to 14 days  
• Percent nocturnal time <54 mg/dL as measured by [CONTACT_28047], defined as as the percentage of CGM 
values <54 mg/dL during nocturnal hours  (12am-6am) within  each treatment period, 
normalized to 14 days.  
• Number of nocturnal Level 2 hypoglycemia events (ADA, <54 mg/dL) as measured by [CONTACT_431703] <54 mg/dL 
during nocturnal hours ( 12am-6am) within  each treatment period divided by [CONTACT_431704] a given treatment period, then normalized to duration of 14 days.

 5. BACKGROUND  
This protocol is being conducted under a COVID -19 specific IND filed with the Division of Pulmonary, 
Allergy and Critical Care of the FDA and is intended to provide preliminary data on the efficacy and safety 
of PUL -042 in reducing the infection rate and progression to COVID-19 in adult subjects exposed to SARS -
CoV -2.  Evaluation of these data will determine the feasibility of advancing to Phase 3 clinical development 
to pursue an NDA filing and the potential for  Emergency Use Authorization.   
This section includes a brief summary of t he rationale for clinical investigation of PUL-042 and a summary 
of the nonclinical data available on PUL -042. More detailed information can be found in the  Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
5.1. Introduction 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_578711] a variety of pathogenic organisms including bacteria, fungi, and 
viruses and is one of the leading causes of death worldwid e1. Even in developed countries, respi[INVESTIGATOR_578712] a serious  complication for patients 
being treated for other diseases. The threat of respi[INVESTIGATOR_578713] a decreased 
level of host resistance such as in immunosuppressed individuals and when there is an increased level of 
pathogen exposure such as in the case of bioterror attacks and biowarfare or epi[INVESTIGATOR_578714]-[ADDRESS_760440], Inc. (Pulmotect)  has developed a novel therapeutic to stimulate innate immunity in the lungs 
that may provide protection against lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]. The technology platform is a direct 
result of basic research conducted by [CONTACT_578733]’s founders on the mechan isms of microbial resistance in 
the lung epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]2,3,4,5,6. PUL -042 is a combination of two synthetic molecules, a lipopeptide (Pam2 CSK4 
acetate [Pam2] ) and a phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN  M362 sodium [ODN] ) that act 
synergistically as agoni sts of T oll-like receptors ( TLR)2/[ADDRESS_760441] spectrum of pathogens 
including Gram -positive and Gram -negative bacteria (including three Class A bioterror agents), the fun gus 
Aspergillus fumigatus , and viral pathogens.

after infection with MERS-CoV virus  (Figure 2). The antiviral activity of PUL-042 therefore has the 
potential for the prevention of infection with the SARS -CoV-2 virus.

5.3. Nonclinical Studies  
The nonclinical  pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of PUL -042 are described in detail in  the 
Investigator’s Brochure.   
5.4. Clinical Studies  
The initial phase 1 study of PUL-042 Inhalation Solution  (PUL -042-001) “A Randomized, Double -Blind, 
Placebo -Controlled, Ascending Dose Stu dy to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and 
Pharmacodynamics of PUL -042 Inhalation Solution in Healthy Subjects” has been completed. Subjects 
were administered a single dose of PUL -042 Inhalation Solution  by [CONTACT_196094]. A total of 4 mL of  a 
solution of PUL -042 at increasing concentrations was administered using sterile water for injection (SWFI) 
as the diluent.  
Review of the data from the PUL -042-[ADDRESS_760446] indicated by a rise in the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) as measured at [ADDRESS_760447]  dose. All values were within the norm al range at the 24 -hour time  
point. The neutrophil response was confirmed in sheep and mice, and furthermore was shown to be dose  
dependent  in mice. The time course of that response has been  further explored in subjects in the study 
PUL -042-003 “A Randomized, Open -label, Crossover Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability and 
Pharmacodynamics of PUL -[ADDRESS_760448] of Pretreatment with 
Cromolyn Sodium  or Albuterol Sulfate ”. 

Pulmotect, Inc.  Protocol v. 1.[ADDRESS_760449] was seen in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_44049] (specifically  the forced 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second [ FEV 1]) from  PUL -042-001,  likely  due to the effect of PUL -[ADDRESS_760450]-dose in subjects treated with PUL -042 Inhalation Solution . There was no comparable decline observed 
with placebo. These measurements were largely within the 12% change from baseline  accepted as normal 
variability. This was followed by a recovery to near baseline levels at [ADDRESS_760451]  dose. Over the course 
of 7 days, the mean FEV1  was within 0 -5% of the baseline value , with the subjects who received higher 
doses of PUL -042 showing a  larger mean decrease in FEV1 . None of the decreases in FEV1 were 
accompanied by [CONTACT_578734][INVESTIGATOR_578715] a drop in oxygen saturation. None of the FEV 1 results in 
the PUL -042 inhalation treated groups were statistically different from placebo after  the 30 -minute time  
point.  The MTD delivered as a single dose was established as 40.6  µg Pam2 :  59.5 µg ODN in 
PUL -042-001.  
A second p hase 1 study (PUL -042-003) has been completed. PUL -042-[ADDRESS_760452] of pretreatment with either cromolyn sodium or albuterol sulfate. The pr imary objective of this study 
was to determin e the safety and tolerability in healthy normal subjects of single  or repeated  doses of PUL -
042 in SWFI. Exploratory objectives include determin ing whether ANC was an indicator of biological 
activity and to determi ne 1) the duration of local biological act ivity in the bronchial airways by [CONTACT_96907] 1 
measurements,  2) whether  the administration of cromolyn sodium prior to t he administration of PUL-[ADDRESS_760453] on the FEV 1 response, and 3) whether  the administration of albuterol prior to the 
administration of PUL-[ADDRESS_760454] cohort of 8 subjects (cohort 1)  received a dose  of 20.3 µg Pam2 : 29.8 µg 
ODN (1/2 the single-dose MTD of PUL -042) with or without pretreatment with cromolyn sodium (4 each) . 
Subjects were then crossed over to the alternative treatment after a 2 -week follow-up period and an 
additional 2 -week washout period.  
A similar design was used for the second cohort (8 subjects) with PUL -042 +/ - albuterol sulfate. The seco nd 
cohort of  subjects received a total dose of 40.6  µg Pam2 : 59.5 µg ODN as two doses over 3  days (1 dose 
on Day 1 and 1 dose on Day 3) and a total dose of 81.2 µg Pam2 :  119 µg ODN as four doses over 32 days 
(1 dose each on Day 1, Day 3, Day 29 and Day 3 2).  
Results from  PUL -042-[ADDRESS_760455] -treatment (the 
last observation in that study) compared to the pre -dose baseline. A similar pattern was observed through [ADDRESS_760456], Inc.  Protocol v. 1.60

Currently there is an ongoing Phase 2 study, PUL -042-402  (A Phase 2, Single -Center , Double -Blind, 
Placebo -Controlled Study of PUL -042 Inhalation Solution in Rhinovirus -induced Symptoms in Current 
Smokers with GOLD Stage 0 COPD), that is evaluating the effects of PUL -042 on peak lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_578716] A16.  
Subjects are dosed with PUL -042 ( 20.3 µg Pam2  : 29.8 µg ODN [50 µg PUL -042] ) or placebo [ADDRESS_760457] (DSMB). The DSMB approved enrolling [ADDRESS_760458] ed is based on the results of PUL -042-001, a single ascending dose study to dete rmine the 
maximum tolerated dose of PUL -042 in healthy volunteers , PUL -042-003, an open-label crossover study 
to investigate the effects of pretreatment with cromolyn sodium  or albuterol sulfate on the safety, 
tolerability , and pharmacodynamics of PUL -042 administered to healthy volunteers , and PUL -042-402 an 
ongoing double -blind study of PUL -042 in a COPD rhinovirus challenge model .  
Based on the results of these studies,  the dose level of PUL -042 Inhalation Solution in  the current study 
will be  20.3 µg Pam2  : 29.8 µg ODN/ mL (50 µg PUL -042 [ this is the same dose level currently used in the 
ongoing viral challenge study]).  A total of  up to  4 doses will be administered over a 10 day period for a 
total dose of 81.2 µg Pam2  : 119.[ADDRESS_760459], Inc.  Protocol v. 1.60

Dosing  
PUL -[ADDRESS_760469] be supervised by a health care professional.  PUL -042 will be administered  
via a P ARI Sprint nebulizer equip ped with a filter valve to prevent aeroso l generation. A nose clip will be 
used during the nebulization procedure.  All doses will be administered  as a constant volume (4 mL) via 
nebulization; the nebulizer will be o perated until all drug has been delivered. All of the following time 
points are defined relative to the completion of dosing (T 0). 
Post-Dose Guidelines  
In previous studies with healthy volunteers, some subjects have demonstrated a transient  decrease in lung 
function, usually asymptomatic.  To date, subjects have recovered to at or near baseline lung function values 
without the administration of rescue medication.  However, if after administration of PUL-042 Inhalation 
Solution there are  clinic al symptoms (increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], cough, shortness of breath)  of decreased 
lung function , albuterol  (salbtu amol) can be administered . 
Following dosing, if a reduction of FEV1 >10% relative to pre -treatment is recorded, the subject  
should have the FE V1 measurement repeated as clinically indicated.  If a reduction of FEV1  >12% 
relative to pre-treatment is recorded  at [ADDRESS_760470] be reviewed by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_578721]. If a reduction of FEV1 >12% relative to pre-treatment  persists 
for up to 4 hours and is associated with clinical symptoms over this period,  no further investigational 
treatment  should be administered. Albuterol  (salbut amol) may be given to symptomatic subjects  at 
the discretion of the investigator . 
If a reduction of FEV1  >20% relative to  pre-tr eatment  is recorded , no further investigational 
treatment should be administered to that subject.

 12. ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse events will be described and graded according to the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy  Adult  
and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials.  
Symptoms  and events  associated with SARS -CoV-2 infection will be scored as per the SARS -CoV-2 
infection symptom s core (Table 2) and the Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement  (Table 4).  These  
findings should not be reported as Adve rse Events.  
12.1. Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE  is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not 
considered drug related.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, 
for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if it qualifies as such based on the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials. 
Throughout the course of the study, every effort should be made to remain alert to possible AEs. Subjects 
should be encouraged to report AEs spontaneously or in response to general, nondirected questioning.  
With the occurrence of an AE, the primary concern is the safety of the subject . Appropriate management 
of the AE should always be the first priority . 
Suspected Adverse Reaction 
Defined as any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse 
event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest 
a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser 
degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by [CONTACT_182825].  
Life-Threating Adverse Event or Life-Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction 
The te rms “serious” and “severe” are not synonymous.  Adverse events classified as “serious” have defined 
regulatory requirements. Those classified as “severe” do not have defined regulatory requirements unless 
they are also classified as “serious”.  
Pulmotect, Inc.  Protocol v. 1.60 
PUL -042-501   29 January 2021 
 
29 
 
 The term “se vere” is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe 
myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as 
severe headache).   
An AE is classified as “seriou s” based on the criteria outlined below. Seriousness (not severity) defines the 
regulatory reporting obligations.  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered  “serious” if in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:   
• Death 
• A life -threatening adverse event  
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Persistent or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anom aly/birth defect  
• Intervention to prevent any one of the other outcomes listed above (based on medical judgment)  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20967], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such 
medical events are allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias,  convulsions that do not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse . 
Unexpected Adverse Event  or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “ unexpected ” if it is not listed in the Investigator ’s 
Brochure or is not listed in the Investigator ’s Brochure at the specificity and severity observed . 
Serious and Unexpected Adverse Event  or Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Any AE or s uspected adverse reaction that occurs during the subject’s participation in the study that meets 
the criteria for both serious and unexpected as defined above  is considered a serious and unexpected AE  or 
suspected adverse reaction . 
12.2. Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The AE reporting period for this study is continuous and begins at the time of randomization to study 
treatment and ends on Study Day 29. 
In addition, any known untoward event that occurs subsequent to the AE  reporting period that the 
Investigator assesses as related to the investigational medication should also be reported as an AE . 
All AEs (both serious and nonserious) must be followed until resolution or until a stable clinical endpoint 
is reached.  All measures required for AE managem ent and the ultimate outcome of the AE must be recorded 
in the source documentation and in the eCRF .  
Pulmotect, Inc.  Protocol v. 1.60 
PUL -042-501   29 January 2021 
 
30 
 
 12.3. Treatment Emergent Adverse Events  
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as those that begin or worsen after the start of study drug 
administration.  
12.4. Recording  of AEs  
All AEs will be documented in the appropriate section of the eCRF.   
NOTE: Symptoms and events associated with SARS -CoV-2 infection will be scored as per the SARS-
CoV-2 infection symptom score  (Table 2) and the Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (Table 4).  
These findings should not be reported as Adverse Events.  
In the event that the electronic data capture (EDC) system cannot be accessed and a SAE or serious 
suspected adverse reaction has occurred, a paper SAE report form will be available to be completed and 
faxed or emailed to the Sponsor or their designee.  
The following  will be recorded for each AE  in the eCRF: 
• A description of the AE in medical terms.  Whenever possible, a diagnosis should be given when 
signs and symptoms are due to common etiology ( e.g., cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, 
and head congestion should be reported as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]”)   
• Start date  
• Stop date  
• The severity (i.e. , grade) as assessed by [CONTACT_578737]. If the AE is not specifically listed in the reference above, the following 
grades should be used:   
o Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
o Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADL (Activities of Daily Living)  
o Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_578722]; disabl ing; limiting self-care ADL  
o Grade 4  Life- threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
o Grade 5  Death related to AE  
• The causal relationship to study drug as assessed by [CONTACT_737]; the decisive factor in the 
documentation is the temporal relation between the AE and the study drug. 
• Action(s) taken (e.g., study drug administration interrupted, study drug not administered, none , 
unknown).  
• The outcome (e.g. , recovered/resolved, not recovered/not resolved , recovering/resolving, 
recovered/resolved  with sequelae, fatal, unknown). 
Pulmotect, Inc.  Protocol v. 1.60 
PUL -042-501   29 January 2021 
 
31 
 
 • Whether it caused the subject to discontinue the study . 
If in any [ADDRESS_760482] the same AE occurs on several occasions (unless the AE is continuous and of stable 
grade), the AE in question will be documented and assessed at each occurrence.  
Should a pregnancy of a female participant or a partner of a male participant occur, it must be reported and 
recorded in the eCRF. Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_578723] a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth , or congenital 
abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject  was discontinued from the study.  
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs.  Spontaneous miscarriages should also be 
reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.  
12.5. Assessing Relationships of AE to Study Drug  
The Investigator must record his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_578724] . Table 3 provides guidance for assigning relationship to the study drug.  
Table 3: Relationship of Adverse Event to the Administration of the Study Drug  
Unrelated  There is not a temporal relationship to study drug or there is a reasonable causal 
relationship between another drug, concurrent disease, or circumstance and the AE. The AE is clearly not related to study drug.  
Unlikely  There is a temporal relationship to study drug, but there is not a reasonable 
causal relationship between the study drug and the AE. The AE is doubtfully 
related to study drug.  
Possibly  There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the AE.  
The AE may be related to study drug.  
Probably  There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the AE.  
The AE is likely related to the study drug . 
Definitely There is a causal relationship between the study drug and the AE.  The AE is 
clearly related to the st udy drug.  
12.6. Reporting Serious or Unexpected AEs  
Any SAE  or serious suspected adverse reaction that occurs during the course of the study will be reported 
within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the event. 
All SAE reporting will adhere to the [LOCATION_002] Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), specifically [ADDRESS_760483], Inc.  Protocol v. 1.60 
PUL -042-501   29 January 2021 
 
32 
 
 12.7. Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All AEs (both serious and non -serious) should be followed until resolution or until a stable clinical endpoint 
is reached. All measures required for AE management and the ultimate outcome of the AE must be recorded 
in the source document and the eCRF . 
Any SAE or serious suspected adverse reaction fo llow-up information requested should be provided in a 
timely manner. The additional information may include copi[INVESTIGATOR_243222], autopsy reports, or other 
relevant documents.

 13. STATISTICAL METHODS   
13.1. Sample Size Determination 
The trial size of 200 subjects (100 PUL -042 inhalation solution: 100 placebo) was chosen based on clinical 
considerations. The rates of  infection to adequately estimate a sample size for a statistically significant 
result are unknown.    
Enrolled subjects will be randomized with equal probability to receive blinded treatment consisting of either 
PUL -[ADDRESS_760484] Populations  
Intent to Treat Population (ITT)  
The ITT population will include all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of experimental 
treatment (i.e., PUL-042 or Placebo)  
The ITT population will be the primary data source used to address the pr imary study efficacy objectives 
Modified Intention to Treat ( MITT) 
The MITT population will include all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of experimental 
treatment  (i.e., PUL-042 or Placebo)  and are negative for SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_760485] 
one dose of experimental treatment . The Safety p opulation will be the data source used to evaluate the 
safety and tolerability of experimental treatment for this study.  
13.3. Primary Objective  
To determine the efficacy of PUL -042 Inhalation Solution in the prevention of viral infection with SARS -
CoV -2 and pr ogression to COVID-19 in subjects: 1) who have repeated  exposure to individuals with  
SARS -COV -2 infection  and 2) who are asymptomatic at enrollment.  
The primary endpoint is the severity of COVID -[ADDRESS_760486] of randomized 
treatment and ot her relevant covariates (e.g., age, b aseline OSCI Score, and presence of comorbidities).  
Because the statistical properties of these score differences might not conform to the theoretical requirements of this procedure, a W ilcoxon Rank-Sum (nonparametric) test may also be used to analyze 
the main effect of treatment.   Full details of the planned analysis will be included in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan that will be developed for this study.

 The Ordinal Scale for Clinica l Improvement to be used in this study is derived from a draft scale proposed 
by [CONTACT_38375]9 for clinical improvement as presented below  in Table 4 :

It is possible that medically justified treatment and or procedures cannot be implemented due to the 
unavailability of equipment (e.g., scarcity of ventilators).  In such cases, the data recorded in the eCRF 
should reflect the prescribed circumstances rather than the reality.  For example, if clinical evaluation of a patient indicates the need for mechanical ventilation  when no ventilator is available, that patient should be 
scored  as 6 – “Intubation and mechanical ventilation” not  as a lower score on the Ordinal Scale for Clinical  
Improvement .   
13.4. Secondary Objectives  
To determine the difference in incidence of SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_760487] negative for SARS -CoV-2 at the pre -treatment visit (MITT) 
To compare the severity of COVID-19 within 14 days from the start of experimental therapy  (ITT) 
To compare the severity of COVID-19 within 28 days from the start of experimental therapy  (ITT)  
To assess the requirement for ICU admission within 2 8 days from the start of experimental therapy  (ITT)  
To assess the requirement for mechanical ventilation within 2 8 days from the start of experimental therapy  
(ITT) 
To assess mortality within 2 8 days from t he start of experimental therapy (ITT)

 13.5. Safety Analysis  
A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study results.  
The SAP may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of planned 
analyses will be reflected in a protocol amendment. Safety data will be presented in tabular and/or graphical 
format and summarized descriptively, if appropr iate. 
Adverse events will be described and graded according  to the  Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult 
and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials . 
Treatment -emergent AEs, vital signs, physical examinations, clinical labor atory data, lung function tests, 
and noncompliance will be reviewed on an ongoing basis during the study to evaluate the safety of the 
subjects.

 14. ADMINISTRATION OF THE S TUDY  
14.1. Regulatory Considerations  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the prot ocol, International Conference on Harmoni sation 
(ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines, and the applicable local regulatory requirements.  This 
study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that originate in the Declaration of 
Helsinki and ICH Guidelines for GCP.  
Study protocols and informed consent forms will be approved by [CONTACT_578738]. All subjects will sign an informed consent form prior to any study-specific 
procedure s. The study will be monitored for regulatory and protocol compliance by a study monitor selected 
by [CONTACT_578733] . 
14.2. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee  
The Investigator must submit the final protocol and proposed informed consent document to an I RB/ethics 
committee  that complies with the ICH GCP. The IRB /ethics committee  will provide the Investigator with 
a written decision regarding the conduct of the study and a copy of the document will be forwarded to the 
Sponsor . The study will not be initiated and subjects will not be enrolled until the appropriate 
documentation of IRB/ethics committee approval of the study protocol and the informed consent form has 
been received.  
Substantive modifications to the protocol must be submitted to the IRB /ethics committee  for approval.  
Administrative changes to the protocol , such as revisions for clarification that do not affect the conduct of 
the study or increase the risk to the subject , should be submitted to the IRB /ethics committee  for 
informational purposes;  formal  approval is not required.  
The Investigator must also submit any writt en information that will be given to the study subjects, as well 
any subject recruitment material , to the IRB/ethics committee  for approval prior to use.  
The Investigator will make appropriate and timely reports to the IRB /ethics committee  as required by 
[CONTACT_578739] /ethics committee  policy. In addition to progress reports, all 
known information regarding SAEs will be reported per IRB /ethics committee  requirements.  
It is the Investigator's obligation to provide the Sponsor  with copi[INVESTIGATOR_120882] -related correspondence 
with the IRB /ethics committee in a timely fashion and to retain the originals as part of the Site Regulatory 
File. The Site Regulatory File will be made available as requested for monitoring or quality assurance 
review during site audits and to governmental regulatory re presentatives as required . 
14.3. Subject Information and Informed Consent  
Written informed consent must be obtained from each subject in accordance with the ICH GCP. Informed 
consent must be obtained prior to performing any study-specific procedures. The consent form that is used 
must be approved by [CONTACT_578740] /ethics committee  and Pulmotect. 
The subject and the individual explaining the study will sign the current IRB /ethics committee-approved 
version of the consent form. A copy of the signed consent form will be given to the subject. The date that 
consent was obtained will be recorded on the eCRF as well as in the subject's source documents.  
Pulmotect, Inc.  Protocol v. 1.60 
PUL -042-501   29 January 2021 
 
37 
 
 A copy of each version of the informed consent form that has been approved by [CONTACT_1201] /ethics committee  
will be provided to the Sponsor. Care should be taken that the current approved version of the consent form 
is provided to the subject for review and signature. It is possible that in some cases an updated consent form 
will contain significant information that will require a previously enrolled subject to sign the updated 
consent form. Original signed consent forms must be in the Site Regulatory File and be available for review 
by [CONTACT_4539].  
A sample consent form is provided in Section  15. 
14.4. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An external DSMB will be used to evaluate safety of the study in an ongoing manner. There will be three 
voting members. None of the voting members will have any affiliation with Pulmotect, Inc. A full 
description of the membership, role, and responsibiliti es of the DSMB will be finalized prior to the start of 
the study, and will be provided in the DSMB charter. The DSMB will evaluate safety at regular intervals including early in the trial.  
The DSMB chair has the ability to pause study enrollment at any point during the study for any reason 
including rapid enrollment which could hinder the DSMB’s ability to review the safety of PUL -[ADDRESS_760488] completed dosing. Ad hoc meetings can also be called.  
As a further effort to ensure the safety of PUL -042, a s toppi[INVESTIGATOR_578726].  This rule will be implemented if there is a high probability of excess mortality risk among 
patients randomized to PUL-042.  The following hierarchical analysis of mortality will be performed after 
50% of subjects have been enrolled (50/group) and followed up for 28 days from the start of investigational 
therapy:  
1) Based on blinded data, if no more than [ADDRESS_760489] occurred during the study this analysis will 
not be conduc ted due to the lack of  evidence of increased mortality risk attributable to PUL-042.   
If more than 3 deaths occur : 
2) The Unblinded statistician will evaluate unblinded mortality data to determine the treatment specific death rate (i.e., D
Tx = Deaths Tx / N Tx; Tx = Active or Placebo).   
3) If the difference, Δ,  in treatment -specific death rates (i.e., Δ = D Active – D Placebo ) is greater than 7.5%, 
the DSMB will further review the totality of evidence and render a recommendation to the sponsor 
regarding study cont inuation.

 Characteristics of this rule are as follows:  
Assuming that the true underlying control arm mortality rate is 5% and using a  normal approximation when 
comparing proportions, the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_465932]:  
• 90% if the true underlying mortality rate attributable to PUL-042 is 25%.  
• 62% if the true underlying mortality rate attributable to PUL-042 is 15%.  
• only 11% if the true underlying mortality rate attributable to PUL -042 is 5% (equal to the 
assumed true underlying control arm mortality rate)  
14.5. Adherence to the Protocol  
The study shall be conducted as described in this protocol except for an emergency situation in which proper 
care of the subject requires immediate alternative intervention. This protocol refers to the protocol as 
provided by [CONTACT_578741] /ethics committee  and submitted to the FDA as part 
of the I nvestigational New Drug Application  that is in effect. While FDA regulations permit the protocol 
to be amended, this must be done in accordance wit h the provisions agreed upon in Section 14.6 .

date of screen ing, and enrollment status.  
Data collected through the completion of experimental procedures required by [CONTACT_578746] l be recorded 
in the subject's source documentation. These data will then be transcribed into the eCRF.  
All required study data will be entered into the eCRFs provided by [CONTACT_578733]. A ll study data  should be 
entered into the eCRF as soon as possible after  collection. All information in the e CRFs must be supported 
by [CONTACT_578747]’s medical records. All medical records, laboratory printouts, notes made by 
[CONTACT_099], and other mater ials such as x -rays will be considered source data and must be available for 
inspection by [CONTACT_578733] , its designees, or regulatory authorities.  
Appropriate training of the study site will be conducted prior to study initiation to assist with making entries  
and corrections to data entered into an eCRF. The Investigator remains responsible for the accuracy and adequacy of all data entered into the eCRFs (EDC system).  
Data will be monitored as described in  Section 14.9. Data entered into e CRFs will be reviewed and 
compared with source documents by [CONTACT_578748].   
Upon further data processing, queries may be gene rated and sent electronically to the Investigator for 
clarification or correction. The Investigator  or designee  will address any queries and provide resolution 
within the EDC system.  
The eCRF will be signed (electronically) by [CONTACT_578749] (date and time will be captured in 
the eCRF audit trail). After completion of the study, completed eCRFs will be electronically transferred to 
Pulmotect and/or designee and stored in the archives according to the data management plan. Once the 
eCRFs are signed by [CONTACT_737], the data manager will lock the eCRFs for data analysis.

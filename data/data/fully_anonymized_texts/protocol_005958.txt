2.1 Background  
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_563099] 2  (SARS-CoV-2).1,[ADDRESS_739904] adults with COVID-19 appear to experience fever, cough, and fatigue and then recover within 1 -3 weeks.  However, a p ortion of adults with COVID -19 develop severe illness, typi[INVESTIGATOR_563100], with continued progression to acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) and death in some cases.
1–3  There is an urgent need for outpatient 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15128] a demonstrated ability to improve recovery progression of COVID -19 to severe illness. 
Based on mechanism of action and ea rly clinical experiences, several agents currently available in the 
U.S. are proposed as potential therapi[INVESTIGATOR_563101].4–6  Among these potential 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir has generated substantial interest due to antiviral and immunomodulatory 
activity and established safety profiles with FDA approval for use in other conditions .  In this trial, we 
will evaluate effectiveness and safety of lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054] /ritonavir  for the early  treatment of adults with COVID -
[ADDRESS_739905] a zoonotic 
origin , although the specific reservoir and  intermediary species remain unclear.9  The COVID-19 
infection represents the seventh coronavirus known to cause disease in humans.10  Four of the 
coronaviruses viruses are known to cause symptoms of the common cold in immunocompetent individuals while two others (SARS -CoV and MERS -CoV) have caused recent outbreaks of severe and 
sometimes fatal respi[INVESTIGATOR_3748].
[ADDRESS_739906] common reasons for ICU care are respi[INVESTIGATOR_563102], with a 
minority developi[INVESTIGATOR_563103].17 The case fatality rate is estimated to be  0.25% 
to 3.0%.18   
2.1.2 Promising Candidate Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_563085] -19 
Several agents currently available in the US  are proposed as potential therapi[INVESTIGATOR_563104].4-6  
Lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  (Kaletra), an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV-1, also has potent antiviral 
activity and promising early clinical data against coronaviruses, including those causing SARS and MERS.
22–26 Lopi[INVESTIGATOR_563105] a HIV type 1 aspartate protease inhibitor; when combined with ritonavir, the 
plasma half-life of lopi[INVESTIGATOR_563106]. Lopi[INVESTIGATOR_563107] a potential therapy for severe 
TREAT NOW Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_739907] both SARS-CoV, the virus 
which causes Severe Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_23223] (SARS), and MERS -CoV, the virus which causes 
Middle East Respi[INVESTIGATOR_23223] (MERS).27,28 Prior open label studies of lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054] -ritonavir suggested 
the potential to improve clinical outcomes and decrease viral load in patients with SARS and MERS .29–32  
A recent  randomized open-label trial of lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374] -19 failed 
to demonstrate a treatment benefit.3 However, the trial was underpowered for clinically important  
endpoints and enrolled patients at an advanced stage of disease, a median of 13 days after symptom onset, 
when antiviral activity is likely  much less important. Still, the observed mortality in the 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir group was 5.8% lower than the control group (95% confidence interval, -17.3 to 5.7), as well as an observed faster time to clinical improvement that was also n ot statistically significant (HR 
1.24, 95%CI 0.90-1.72). Accordingly, substantial enthusiasm remains for early  treatment of COVID-19, 
particularly prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
2.1.3 Rationale for a Randomized Trial Early Treatment among Outpatients  
Initial CO VID-19 symptoms develop approximately 2-10 days after infection with the SARS -CoV-2 
virus.33–[ADDRESS_739908] adults recover without complications, but hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563108]/failure, and in some cases, ARDS and death. The first [ADDRESS_739909] ome 
such as fevers and cough. Those experiencing a milder course typi[INVESTIGATOR_563109]; those on a more severe course will progress to respi[INVESTIGATOR_563110], which usually occurs [ADDRESS_739910] in the elderly, immun ocompromised, and those with chronic cardiopulmonary disease. 
However, young adults remain at high risk of complications, as younger adults (age 20-44 years) comprise approximately 25% of COVID -19-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643].  
COVID-[ADDRESS_739911] in finding effective 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], specifically in repurposing approved medications with widespread availability and known safety profiles. Efficacy and safety data for lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir from randomized tria ls are critical to 
provide evidence -based therapy for the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic. Our proposed trial will efficiently 
assess the potential candidate therap y and provide a structure for rapid integration of other candidate 
drugs in future clinical trials. 
2.2 Study Aims  
2.2.1 Study aim  
To determine the effectiveness and safety of early treatment with  lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir versus placebo in

3.3 Justification of Exclusion Criteria  
Since this is intended as an outpatient trial, patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22318] 6 days prior to 
enrollment /randomization are excluded. The other exclusion criteria are primarily designed for patient 
safety.  In addition to excluding specific vulnerable populations (e.g., prisoners), these criteria are 
designed to exclude patients for whom receipt of lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  might increase the risk of serious 
adverse events. Lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ Ritonavir has been  routinely prescribed to outpatients with HIV -[ADDRESS_739917] incorporated guidelines 
for safe outpatient prescribing of lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir without a baseline electrocardiogr am or outpatient 
cardiac monitoring40 and have put into place a method of monitoring newly prescribed medications during 
the 14-day intervention period.  
3.4 Screening  
The site investigator or delegate will screen for non-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105458] s with laboratory confirmed 
COVID-19 (that is, a positive laboratory test for SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_739918] 6 days ). 
The source of these patients will be primarily patients seen and sent home  from the enrolling hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563111] 1.6  
January 26, 2021   Page 17 of 40 emergency department, urgent care, primary care, virtual care/telemedicine visits, or testing centers.  We 
may also advertise the study at outpatient testing sites and more broadly for self-referral to the study.  
3.[ADDRESS_739919] 
patients will no longer be in the health care setting and therefore we anticipate that this discussion will 
occur  primarily by [CONTACT_563148]’s home (test pending patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_563112] p ending).   We may 
advertise the study at both the testing sites as well as more broadly . 
For all excluded patients, including refusal by [CONTACT_563149], we will collect a small number of variables, including month and year patient met screening criteria and reason(s) patient was excluded to 
allow for reporting in the CONSORT diagram of the manuscript. Due to the nature of this trial in the 
outpatient setting and for staff safety and personal protective equipment (PPE) conservation, these 
encounte rs will usually occur via telephone or videophone.  
3.6 Process of Obtaining Informed Consent  
We will obtain w ritten informed consent from the patient . We will not enroll patients who lack decision -
making capacity due to logistical issues with remote study  medication administration, safety monitoring, 
and accurate data collection.  
In-person visits for patients with known COVID-19 who are deemed stable for outpatient management and home quarantine would violate infection control principles and policies. Given the infectious risk 
from COVID -19 and potential shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), there is a moral and 
practical imperative to minimize face-to -face contact [CONTACT_347903] -clinical personnel . 
Therefore, w e will use  “no-touch”  consent  procedures for this trial , employing an electronic remote 
consent process to obtain written informed consent.   
Electronic approach 
1. A link for the electronic consent is sent to the subject . 
2. Research staff contact [CONTACT_563150] ( method dictated by [CONTACT_274424] ) to have an informed consent conversation. This step confirms subject identity. 
3. If they consent, the patient signs the consent form. This can be: 
a. an actual signature (often tracing their finger on the screen) OR  
b. a username [CONTACT_563177]-regulator guidance at 45 CFR 46.117 , 45 CFR 
164.512, 21 CFR 11 Subpart C (11.100 –11.300) ,

https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search -fda-guidance -documents/informed-consent  
We will provide the information for the informed consent discussion in a formal document that has been 
approved by [CONTACT_274427] a language comprehensible to the potential participant, using an interpreter if 
necessary . Currently, English and Spanish documents are approved for use in this trial.  The information 
presented in the consent form and by [CONTACT_191651],  including any potential risks or benefits of  taking part. We will  clearly state that 
the participant is free to withdraw from the trial at any time for any reason without prejudice to future care, and with no obligation to give the reason for withdrawal. Where a patient does not speak English, a 
translated Spanish consent and qualified interpreter will be employed, using similar “no-touch” principles .  
Use of a telephone or video  interpreter and the interpreter’s identity will be documented on the electronic 
consent . 
After allowing the potential participant time to read the informed consent document, research staff  will 
answer any additional questions.     
3.7 Randomization and B linding  
We will randomize eligible participants through a central electronic system  in a 1:1 ratio  to 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir (intervention) versus placebo (control). A randomized group assignment is provided to 
the site investigator or delegate from a centralized, web -based platform.  Randomization will require 
provision of the screening number and confirmation of patient eligibility. In the future, we may also 
consider adding an intervention group.  
We will perform the randomization in permuted blocks of varying size  and stratified by [CONTACT_299898] (≥65 
years or <65 years).  We will store t he randomiz ation  sequence allocation on a secure server , which will 
not be available to site study personnel. Each participant will receive a computer-generated study ID 
number.  The computer -generated study ID number  and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_563113] a dose pack containing lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir or placebo.   
The participant, treating clinicians, study personnel , and outcome assessors will all remain blinded to 
group assignment until after the database is locked and blinded analysis is  completed . Only B elmar 
Pharmacy, who is distributing study medicati on, and one member of the biostatistical team who is 
preparing closed DSMB interim reports will be unblinded. Specifically, study medication will be 
dispensed with packaging and labelling that would blind treatment assignment. Unblinding will occur 
only if required for subject safety or treatment at the request of the treating clinician.  
4. STUDY INTERVENTIONS

A summary of the trial ’s schedule of events is included in Appendix A.  
Timing of study procedures is based on the time of randomization, which is defined as “Time 0”. Study 
Day [ADDRESS_739920] dose of study drug.   We will assess t he primary outcome  
on Study Day 15, which corresponds to 14 days (2 weeks) after the initiation of study drug.  
TREAT NOW Protocol Version 1.6  
January 26, 2021   Page 19 of 40 A research physician will prescribe a study medication that  a central pharmacy (Belmar Pharmacy)  will 
fill at no charge to the patient and will arrive through ove rnight mail ( typi[INVESTIGATOR_563114] 10:00AM ). 
The study medication will arrive in blinded blister packs labelled as lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir or placebo with 
the appropriate daily instruction for administration. The goal is initiation of treatment within one day of 
randomization (Study Day 1) . 
On Study D ays 1-15, the patient will complete brief electronic data collection form through a secure 
electronic platform that will confirm receipt and administration of study drug and document the number 
and reason for any missed doses. For those with missing electronic data, t elephone follow -up will provide 
an additional opportunity to clarify study drug administration, as needed . If the participant  is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563115],  an attempt will be made to continue study medication. 
However, s tudy medication may  be discontinued  if felt necessary by [CONTACT_563151] . Unblinding will occur only if required for subject safety or treatment at the 
request of the treating clinician . 
4.2 Lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/Ritonavir Group 
Participants assigned to the lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir arm will receive lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir 4 00 mg/ 100 mg orally 
twice daily for 2 8 doses (Days 1-14). Medication dose packs will contain all 28 doses labelled by [CONTACT_563152].  
Rationale for Drug Selection of L opi[INVESTIGATOR_054] /Ritonavir 
We are administering lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ ritonavir (LPR/r) in standard dosing:   lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg 
twice daily for 2 8 doses (Days 1-14). LPV/r as Kaletra t ablets is dosed based upon extensive PK/PD 
study evaluations in healthy  and HIV+ subjects as reported in its US and European labels  (400/100mg 
BID  or 800/200mg QD) - 
see https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2016/021251s052_021906s046lbl.pdf  
and https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/221/smpc . The mean in vitro antiviral IC [ADDRESS_739921] HIV in the absence of human serum, is 6.5 nM. The IC 50 of LPV vs SARS viruses and in 
particular SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be approximately 1-10μM.23,25 Comparison of these potencies is 
limited as data are uncontrolled and assay  procedure differ, but it suggests SARS -CoV-2 replication is 
approximately  100 - 1000 -fold less susceptible to LPV/r -mediated   replication than HIV. PK/PD 
comparisons across unrelated viral infections with overtly different clinical manifestations also pr esents 
significant translational insight limitations, but the safety/efficacy and PK/PD for LPV/r against HIV is 
well known and enables a guide to a pragmatic and safety -reasoned dosing regimen. A regime n 
of 400/100 mg BID should achieve near steady state concentrations as seen in HIV therapy within 3 to 4 
days. This should align with  an acceptable safety profile coupled with rapid achievement of LPV/ r 
exposure to efficacious levels associated with HIV clinical antiviral activity, and possibly some effect on 
SARS -C0V-2 replication inhibition in patients. LPV/r dosing BID, or 800/200mg QD in adults enables 
unbound LPV exposure at significantly higher levels than reported by [CONTACT_563153] 50. 
Multiple dosing with 400/100 mg LPV/r twice daily for 14 days produces mean ± SD LPV peak plasma 
concentration (Cmax) of 12.3 ± 5.4 μg/ml. The mean steady -state trough concentration prior to the 
morning dose was 8.1 ± 5.7 μg/ml. LPV AUC over a 12 hour dosing interval averages 113.2 ± 60.5 
μg/h/m. LPV  and RTV are 98 –99% bound to the blood plasma proteins, which indicates that unbound 
LPV exposure to be approximately 10 - 100-fold greater than the in vitro  HIV IC 50 value, and within an 
TREAT NOW Protocol Version 1.6  
January 26, 2021   Page 20 of 40 order of magnitude as reported for SARS -C0V-2 value, thereby [CONTACT_563154] a potential antiviral perspective. If unbound drug levels are higher inpatient 
BAL  fluid, then a more favo urable ratio is potentially achievable.  
4.3 Control Group 
Participants randomized to the control group will receive  placebo  orally  twice daily  for 14 days.  
Medication dose packs will contain all 28 doses labelled by [CONTACT_995] . 
While patients who receive the lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir will not have a matched placebo, the packaging would 
indicate study medication (lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir, or placebo)  and participants will not be aware that there is 
no matched placebo for lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir.  Thus, even if the participant searches the internet for pi[INVESTIGATOR_563116], it is entirely possible from  the patient perspective that this could be a marched placebo.  
Exclusion criteria will be exercised to ensure that two individuals from the same household are not 
enrolled in the study and that telephone assessments during the study avoid discussion of the appearance 
of the study medication.   
4.4 Co -Interventions  
This trial will control the use of lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir, or  placebo during the 14 -day intervention period. 
Enrolled participants will not receive open -label lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  during the 14 -day intervention period, 
unless the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] , and the treating clinician wishes to unblind the trial and use these 
medications open label. The treating clinicians  will make all other treatment decisions without influence 
from the protocol.  Administration of other antiviral, immunomodulatory, or other COVID -19 directed 
novel medications (“rescue therapy”) will be allowed. We will record the co -administered COVID-19 
directed medications in the case report form.  The patient will be allowed to  take antipyretics at home as 
needed.    
4.5 On -Study Monitoring  
All pa rticipants  enrolled in the study will be outpatients (not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] ) and therefore initial monitoring 
will be remote as part of routine  outpatient  clinical care with treating physicia ns and nurses (we anticipate 
primarily virtual care/telehealth or routine telephone follow -up). The research staff will provide additional 
remote monitoring through daily electronic collection of symptoms, healthcare utilization, clinically obtained electrocardiograms, newly prescribed medications, and adverse event reporting with 
supplemental telephone follow -up as needed. The research team may flag potential issues but will defer 
specific decisions about additional care and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563117].  
Lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir has been  used extensively for outpatient treatment of other conditions without the 
need for additional monitoring during short term therapy.  
Between baseline and Study Day 15, study personnel will ascertain and  review the initiation of any new 
medications daily and evaluate for potential medication interactions with lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  (see 
Appendix B) .  If a medication  that is considered to be contraindicated with lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  is 
discovered, site physician investigator or designee will contact [CONTACT_563155][INVESTIGATOR_563118]/treating clinician. If a medication with a potential interaction with lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  is 
identified, study personnel will contact [CONTACT_563156], as needed.  Treating clinicians will determine whether an alternative medication would be 
TREAT NOW Protocol Version 1.6  
January 26, 2021   Page 21 of 40 appropri ate or whether the risk -benefit ratio favors continuing the medication with the known potential 
interaction. 
4.6 Criteria for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_563119] a dministration of the blinded study drug temporarily or permanently for (a) adverse events  
without evidence of an alternative cause to the patient’s symptoms, (b) results of on -study monitoring,  or 
(c) clinical deterioration if requested by [CONTACT_238949]. 
If a patient experiences an adverse event that the patient treating clinicians, or investigators feel merits 
temporarily or permanently stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35648], we will stop the study drug. We will record t he 
explanation for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_563120] , and we will record and report the adverse 
event according to the adverse event guidelines below .  If the adverse event resolves to the extent that the 
patient, treating clinicians, and investigators feel that resuming the study drug is appropriate, we will resume the study drug, and we will record this information in the case report form.   
If an EKG is obtained as part of routine clinical care after enrollment and the QTc  is greater than or equal 
to [ADDRESS_739922] b oth the  value for the  QTc and the decision to continue or stop the study drug in the case report 
form. If the daily on -study monitoring by [CONTACT_563157] a potential 
interaction with a medication that treating clinicians feel is required for the optimal treatment of the 
patient and with which treating clinicians and the investigator feel it would be unsafe to administer 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir, we will stop study drug and record the reason in the case report form.  
For patients who ex perience clinical deterioration  requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563121], for w hich treating clinicians feel optimal care would  include  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_563122], we will  stop the study drug,  and the site inve stigator will contact [CONTACT_563158].  We will defer  any additional 
treatments to the treating clinicians .  In this situation, we will record the following data in the case report 
form: t he criteria met for clinical deterioration; the reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_563123]; use of 
other antivirals, and immunomodulators ; and study outcomes . Crossovers from placebo to 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  will be recorded and reported to the DSMB at DSMB reviews and interim analyses. 
The primary analysis will be intention -to-treat.  
5. OUTCOMES  
5.1 Primary O utcome  
The primary outcome is clinical status on the Modified COVID Ordinal Outcomes Scale to  Day 1 5, 
incorporating more granular description of symptoms at the milder end of the scale for this outpatient 
trial. In addition, we  collapsed  non-invasive ventilation with mechanical ventilation and high flow nasal 
oxygen with supplemental oxygen to improve pragmatism of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137291] (source data may come from the patient or alternate contact [CONTACT_563159][INVESTIGATOR_563124]). This outcome is in use 
by [CONTACT_4113]-19 trials globally, including those conducted by [CONTACT_38375], and will 
facilitate pooling and comparison of data across trials.

symptoms to better distinguish recovery in those with milder disease. Use of this standardized outcome 
will increase the potential to compare the results of this trial with other trials and perform meta -analyses.  
6. DATA COLLECTION 
Given the infectious risk from COVID-19 and potential  shortages of personal protective equipment 
(PPE), we will  have no fa ce-to -face contact [CONTACT_347903] -clinical staff.  Additionally, 
minimiz ing research activities and conducting the trial in a pragmatic manner  will increase the ability to 
complete the trial in the face of strained clinical and research resources during the COVID -[ADDRESS_739924] b iological specimens as part of this trial.  
Electronic Data Collection:  
We will collect data directly from patients using MyCap or, if installation and use of an app is not 
possible, through text messaging or email with a survey link, or phone call as back up. MyCap  is a secure 
mobile  application developed by [CONTACT_563160]. Participants install the application  on their personal device. All interaction with the app 
is secure and requires the user to enter a [ADDRESS_739925] had great success using REDCap -based mobile data collection for multiple studies 
including collection of data about quality of  life and exercise after heart surgery  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , pain 
reporting in sickle cell disease ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , and pain using a visual analog scale (VAS) during an 
interventional drug study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
Telephone/Videophone  Data Collection:  
While primary data collection will be by [CONTACT_563161], specific circumstances will trigger

if tests were obtained.   
• Prolonged (>500 msec) QTc interval on available electrocardiograms  
• Self-reported adverse events to Study Day 15  
7. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Using intention-to-treat principles, we will compare the primary outcome (Modified COVID Ordinal 
Outcomes Scale score to  Day 1 5) between patients in each intervention group and the control group using 
a proportional odds model, adjusted for the following co-variables: age, gender, and duration of acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_563097]. The proportional odds assumption will mainly be 
examined using graphical methods —e. g., the logit of the empi[INVESTIGATOR_563126]. If proportionali ty is clearly violated, 
we will consider partial proportional odds or non-proportional odds models. 
With type I error of 0.05, enrolling 54 0 patients in the primary population will provide 90% power to 
detect an odds ratio of 1.75. Accounting for a ~10% lo ss to follow -up rate, we will plan to enroll [ADDRESS_739926] analysis, which is generally more 
conservative than what is needed for a Bayesian approach. W e will plan an initial  DSMB evaluation of 
safety and feasibility after n=[ADDRESS_739927] been enrolled; efficacy will not be considered at th ese 
analyse s. The trial will then have frequent interim analyses with details on specifics on timing of 
meetings, as well as efficacy and futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_563127], to 
be finalized prior to the first interim analyses.  
Additional analyses will include comparisons of secondary outcomes between treatment groups. We will 
compare the Modified COVID Ordinal Outcome Scale daily over the 14-day intervention period using a 
recently developed longitudinal proportional odds model that can incorporate the information on 
intermediate states between baseline and Study D ay 15. For time -to-event outcomes we wi ll utilize 
survival models (e.g., Cox proportional hazards models), continuous outcomes will utilize linear regression, and dichotomized outcomes will be evaluated using logistic regression. We will also evaluat e 
primary and main secondary outcomes in key subgroups of interest. A priori  subgroups for analysis will 
include age, sex, race/ethnicity, facility residence, BMI, baseline renal function, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and duration of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856].  
The proposed trial will us e a Bayesian approach to implement adaptive elements and to estimate the 
primary outcome using the proportional odds model to calculate the posterior probability that the OR > 1, 
suggesting any benefit. Additionally, we will calculate posterior probabilities to account for the potential 
that a treatment is ineffective  (e.g., OR < 1)  or causes harm  (i.e., safety concerns) and would be of 
consideration to terminate enrollment due to futility. A Bayesian approach provides the ability for 
frequent updating of t he posterior probabilities to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_563128] a treatment is showing benefit to 
reducing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563129], providing the possibility of more quickly identifying beneficial treatments. The proposed design may evolve as more is learned about COVID -[ADDRESS_739928] that given the circumstances of this trial during a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_497859], the DSMB will 
need maximum latitude in modifying this trial if necessary,  based on other studies of  lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir 
that may be conducted simultaneously and the rate of growth or decline of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_901].  Alterations may include adding patients, adding arms to the trial, declining to stop for futility, or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_563130]. We may also need to collapse categories within the Modified COVID Ordinal Scale based on granularity of data or frequency of an individual category. We are 
exploring other possible  statistical plans that will be included in a final statistical analysis plan and will be 
presented to the DSMB before the first interim report.  
8. DATA QUALITY MONITORING AND STORAGE  
8.1 Data Quality Monitoring 
We will review data quality  remotely using front -end range and logic checks at the time of data entry and 
back -end monitoring of data using application programming interface tools connecting the online 
database to statistical software to generate data rep orts.   
8.2 Data Storage  
Site personnel  will enter study data into a secure online database.  Site personnel  will maintain the data in 
the secure online database until the time of study publication.  At the time of publication,  DCC will 
generate a de-identified version of the database.  
9. RISK ASSESSMENT  
9.1 Potential Risk to Participants  
Although lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  are FDA approved medication s with a long history of patient use and well -
established safety profiles,  potential risks exist to participating in this study of lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  versus 
placebo for the treatment of COVID-19.   
9.1.2 Potential risks of receiving lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  
The safety and tolerability of lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  has been well characterized through clinical trials and 
post-marketing experience since first authorization for use in [ADDRESS_739929] 
frequently reported adverse drug reactions among patients receiving lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  were 
gastrointestinal disorders (including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and upper and lower abdominal pain), 
fatigue/asthenia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (upper and lower), lipid elevations (hypercholesterolemia an d 
hypertriglyceridemia), musculoskeletal pain (including arthralgia and back pain), and headache (including migraine). Key safety concerns include metabolic abnormalities such as dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_563131], pancreatitis, and hepatotoxicity. In add ition, in the HIV population, immune reconstitution 
inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) manifesting as autoimmune disorders (such as Grave's disease) has been 
reported.   
TREAT NOW Protocol Version 1.6  
January 26, 2021   Page 27 of 40 Important potential risks include PR prolongation at therapeutic dosing, and QT prolongation with 
supratherapeutic doses. Lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir interacts with several drugs since it is an inhibitor of the P450 
isoform CYP3A and is likely to increase the plasma concentration of drugs that are metabolized by 
[CONTACT_097]3A4.   Therefore, LPV/r should not be co -administered with drugs primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A 
and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events.   A list of such products is included in the lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  label. Rare reports of second - or 
third -degree atrioventricular block in patients with underlying structural heart disease and pre-existing 
conduction system abnormalities, or in patients receivi ng drugs known to prolong the PR interval such as 
verapamil, have been reported in patients receiving lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir .  Lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir should be 
used with caution in such patients. In addition, QT prolongation with supratherapeutic doses and when lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  is co-administered with drugs known to prolong the QT interval has been 
reported.   Because lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  is principally metabolized by [CONTACT_4852], caution should be exercised 
when administering this drug to patients with impaired hepatic function. Extra monitoring is 
recommended when diarrhea occurs. The relatively high frequency of diarrhea during treatment with 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  may compromise the absorption and efficacy (due to decreased compliance) of 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  or other concurrent drugs.   Serious persistent vomiting and/or diarrhea with 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  use might also compromise renal function.   The safety of lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  for 
treatment of patients with COVID-19 disease is unknown. COVID -19 may be associated with cardiac 
effects. lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  may prolong QT at supratherapeutic doses and prolong PR at therapeutic 
doses, resulting in arrhythmias.  
9.1.3 Potential risks of receiving placebo with COVID-19  
One potential risk to participating in this  study is receiving placebo rather than  lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir . This 
risk is only relevant if  lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  are ultimately found to be an effective therapy for COVID -19 
and is not relevant if lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir are both  ultimately found to be  ineffective t herapy for COVID -
19.  This trial protocol minimizes this risk through rigorous design to minimize the number of patients 
that we must enroll to determine whether these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_563132]-[ADDRESS_739930] o f eligible patients to placebo (instead of one half in a traditional two-
arm trial ). We will also exclude patients who decline to participate because they feel their optimal care 
requires lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir , exclude  patients whose treating clinicians decl ines to allow enrollment 
because they feel the patient’s optimal care requires treatment with lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir , and specify 
procedures for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35648], unblinding, and allowing open-label administration of 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  for patients wh o experience clinical deterioration during the study period.  
9.2 Minimization of Risk  
Federal regulations at 45 CFR 46.111(a)(1) require that risks to participants are minimized by [CONTACT_191693].  This tri al protocol incorporates numerous 
design elements to minimize risk to patients that meet this human subject protection requirement.  Lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  is approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration and ha ve been  used in clinical 
practice for decades in a number of patient populations with an established safety profile.  The dose and 
route of administration of both medications i n this trial are comparable to the dose and route of 
administration approved for the tr eatment of other acute infections, such as HIV-[ADDRESS_739931] with  lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054] /ritonavir. 
We will collect data on adverse events that are significant enough to warrant health care evaluation.  It was determined that transient,  and clinically insignificant changes in the electrocardiogram or laboratory 
testing would not be  required. In addition, the additional ris k to the publi c and to research personnel by 
[CONTACT_563163]- [ADDRESS_739932] benefits from their participation in this study. 
Administration of lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  may improve clinical outcomes among outpatient adults  with 
COVID-19.  
9.4 Risk in Relation to Anticipated Benefit  
Federal regulations at 45 CFR 46.111 (a)(2) require that “the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be 
expected to result.” Based on the preceding assessment of risks and potential benefits, the risks to subjects 
are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.  L opi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ Ritonavir  has been used in clinical practice 
for decades and previously evaluated for the treatment of patients acutely ill from infection with substantial data to support its safety and potential efficacy.  
10. HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTIONS  
Each study participant must sign and date an informed consent form  or complete the consent in 
accordance with ethics committee guidelines for obtaining consent . Approval of t he central institutional 
review board will be required before any participant  is entered into the study.  
10.1 Selection of Subjects  
Federal regulations at 45 CFR 46(a)(3) require the equitable selection of subjects. We will screen n on-
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563133]-CoV-[ADDRESS_739933] been collected as part of the routine clinical care of  the patient  will be 
reviewed to determine eligibility. Study exclusion criteria neither unjustly exclude classes of individuals 
from participation in the research nor unjustly include classes of individuals for participation in the 
research. Hence, the recruitment of participants conforms to the principle of distributive justice. 
10.2 Informed Consent  
Federal regulations 45 CFR 46.111(a)(5) require us to seek informed consent from each patient. Study personnel obtaining informed consent are responsible for ensuring that t he patient  understands the risks 
and benefits of participating in the study, answering any questions the patient  may have throughout the 
study and sharing any new information in a timely manner that may be relevant to the patient’s 
TREAT NOW Protocol Version 1.6  
January 26, 2021   Page 29 of 40 willingness to permit the patient ’s continued participation in the trial. The study personnel obtaining 
informed consent will make every effort to minimize coercion. We will inform a ll patients  of the 
objectives of the study and the potential risks. We will use the informed consent document to explain the 
risks and benefits of study participation to the patient  in simple terms before the patient is entered into the 
study, and to confirm that the patient is satisfied with his or her understanding of the risks and benefits of 
participating in the study and desires to participate in the study. The investigator is responsible for 
ensuring that informed consent is given by [CONTACT_6904] . This includes obtaining the appropriate 
signatures and dates on the informed consent  document prior to the performance of any protocol 
procedures including administration of study agent.  
For additional details, see Section 3 .6. 
10.3 Withdrawal of Consent 
Participating patients  may withdraw or be withdrawn ( by [CONTACT_563164]) from the 
trial at any time without prejudice. Site personnel will include d ata up to the point of withdrawal in the 
trial analysis, unless consent to use data is  also withdrawn. Site personnel  will record consent prior to 
receipt of study drug, which will constitute a screen -failure.   Withdrawal of consent after randomization 
and administration of one or more doses of study drug will lead to discontinuation  of study interventions  
but site staff will request access to medical records for data related to the trial.   
10.4 Confidentiality  
Federal regulations at 45 CFR 46 111 (a) (7) requires that when appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of participants and to maintain the confidentiality of data. At no time during the 
course of this study, its analysis, or its publication will we reveal patient identities in any manner.  We 
will collect the minimum necessary data containing patient or provider identities.  All patients will be assigned a unique study ID number for tracking.  We will enter all data collected for this study into a 
secure online database.  We will maintain all data  in the secure online database until the time of study 
publication.  At the time of publication, we will generate a de-identified version of the database. Further, 
we will use tools within the secure online database so that only the coordinating center and investigators 
from the enrolling site will have access to data from participants enrolled at that site. 
11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
Assuring patient safety is an essential component of this protocol.  Lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  is approved by [CONTACT_563165] a well -
established safety profile.  Use of lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  for the treatment of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_563134]-19, however, raises unique safety considerations.  This protocol addresses these considerations through:  
1. Exclusion criteria designed to prevent enrollment of patients likely to experience adverse events 
with receipt of lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  
2. On-study monitoring of co -interventions (e.g., newly prescribed medications) and patient 
characteristics (e.g., healthcare utilization, clinically obtained electrocardiogram ) to intervene 
before adverse events occur. 
3. Systematic collection of safety outcomes relevant to use of lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  in this setting. 
TREAT NOW Protocol Version 1.6  
January 26, 2021   Page 30 of 40 4. Structured reporting of adverse events 
11.1 Adverse Event Defini tions  
Adverse Event: Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug or a study 
procedure, whether or not considered drug related.  
Serious Adverse Event: A serious adverse event is any adverse event that results in one of the outcomes 
listed in section 11.3 below.  
Adverse Reaction : An adverse reaction means any adverse event caused by a study intervention. An 
adverse reaction is a subset of all suspected adverse events where there is a reason to conclude that the 
study intervention caused the event.  Suspected Adverse Reaction: Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study procedures caused the adverse event. Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the study procedures and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction 
implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction.  
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) : An adverse reaction that is both 
unexpected (not consistent with risks outlined in the study protocol or investigator brochure), serious, and 
meets the definition of a suspected adverse reaction.  
11.2 Safety Monitoring 
Assuring patient safety is an essential component of this protocol. Each participating investigator has primary responsibility for the safety of the individual participants under his or her care. The Investigators 
will determine daily if any adverse events occur during the period from enrollment through study day 16 
(or 48 hours after completion of the study drug administration ) and will determine if such adverse events 
are reportable.  Thereafter, adverse events are not required to be reported to the IRB unless the 
investi gator feels the adverse event was related to study drug or study procedures.   
The following adverse events will be considered reportable and thus collected in the adverse event case report forms:   
 Serious adverse events  
 Non-serious adverse events that are considered by [CONTACT_563166] (Appendix C)  
 Events leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug. 
Study -specific clinical outcomes (Primary , Secondary  and Safety  Outcomes and Assessments 
During the Study), including serious outcomes such as organ failures and death, are 
systematically recorded in the case report forms and are exempt from adverse event reporting 
unless the investigator deems the event to be related  to the administration of study drug or the 
conduct of study procedures (or of uncertain relationship) as outlined in Appendix C.  
After randomization, adverse events must be evaluated by [CONTACT_093]. If the adverse event is judged 
to be reportable, as outlined above, then the investigator will report to the VCC their assessment of the 
TREAT NOW Protocol Version 1.6  
January 26, 2021   Page 31 of 40 potential relatedness of each adverse event to the study drug or protocol procedure via electronic data 
entry. Investigators will assess if there is a reasonable possibility that the study procedure caused the 
event, based on the criteria outlined in Appendix C. Investigators will also consider if the event is 
unexpected.  Unexpected adverse events are events not listed in the study protocol and the investigator 
brochure for Lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir. I nvestigators will also determine if adverse events are unanticipated 
given the patient’s clinical course, previous medical conditions, and concomitant medications.   
If a patient's treatment is discontinued as a result of an adverse event, study site personnel must also 
report the circumstances and data leading to discontinuation of treatment in the adverse e vent case report 
forms.   
11.[ADDRESS_739934] sign off on the initial report within three (3) days of study team’s awareness of the SAE.   Alerts issued via telephone are to be immediately followed with official notification on the adverse event case report form. See Appendix C for reporting timelines  for serious, 
unexpected, study related events (SAEs) and serious, unexpected suspected adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  
As per the FDA and NIH definitions, a serious adverse event is any adverse event that results in one of the following outcomes:  
 Death  
 A life -threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)  
 Prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_257353] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_562979]://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/ucm053087.htm : Report if admission 
to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274358] a result of the adverse event. Emergency room visits that do not result in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563135] (e.g., life -thre atening; required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage; 
other serious medically important event).  
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
As per http://w ww.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/ucm053087.htm
: Report if the adverse 
event resulted in a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions, i.e., 
the adverse event resulted in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or 
disruption in the patient's body function/structure, physical activities and/or quality of life.  
Reportable serious adverse events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312753], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Serious adverse events will be collected through Study Day 16 (or 48 hours after completion of the study 
drug administratio n), regardless of the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_25289].  
TREAT NOW Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_739935] (DSMB)  
The principal role of the DSMB is to assure the safety of participants in the trial. They will regularly 
monitor data from this trial, review and assess the performance of its operations with respect to:  
• Review of adverse events  
• Review of every death occu rring on study  
• Interim results of the study for evidence of efficacy or adverse events 
• Possible early termination of the trial because of new external information, early attainment of study objectives, safety concerns, or inadequate performance  
• Possible mo difications in the clinical trial protocol  
• Performance of individual centers  
The DSMB will consist of members with expertise in acute infections, acute lung injury, emergency 
medicine, biostatistics, ethics, and clinical trials. Appointment of all member s is contingent upon the 
absence of any conflicts of interest. All the members of the DSMB are voting members. The unblinded 
statistician will be responsible for the preparation of all DSMB and adverse event reports and may review 
unblinded data.  The DSMB will develop a charter and review the protocol and sample consent form 
during its first meeting. Subsequent DSMB meetings will be scheduled in accordance with the DSMB 
Charter with the assistance of the VCC. When appropriate, conference calls may be held in place of face-
to-face meetings. Recommendations to end, modify, or continue the trial will be prepared by [CONTACT_563167]. Recommendations for major changes, such as stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356], will be 
communicated immediately. Other recommendations will be distributed in writing to the VCC and sIRB , 
which will distribute with instructions for reporting to local IRBs  when appropriate.   
We will comply with the principles and approaches espoused  by [CONTACT_563168] :

Medications considered to present a potential interaction with l opi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir , which if ordered during 
the 14-day study period, will prompt study personnel to discuss with treating clinicians the risk-benefit 
assessment of this medication and potential need for additional monitoring: flecainide, mefloquine, methotrexate, mexilitine, rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], rifapentine, amiodarone, cimetidine dofetilide, phenobarbital, 
phenytoin, or sotalol, propafenone, a stemizole, t erfenadine, alfuzosin, apalutamide, ranolazine, 
dronedarone, rifampin, lurasidone, cisapride, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], ergot -containing medicines  (including 
dihydroergotamine mesylate, ergotamine tartrate, methylergonovine), lovastatin, simvastatin, lomitapi[INVESTIGATOR_5328], 
sildenafil, triazolam, midazolam, rivaroxaban, fluticasone and anticoagulants  or St. John’s Wort.  
 
  
TREAT NOW Protocol Version 1.6  
January 26, 2021   Page 35 of 40 Appendix C:  Adverse Event Reporting and Unanticipated Events  
As noted in section 11, investigators will report all “serious adverse events,”  defined as adverse events 
that are serious and have a reasonable possibility that the event was due to a study drug or procedure (or 
of uncertain relatedness) , to the VCC within [ADDRESS_739937] ( sIRB).  
The National/Lead Investigator at the VCC will work collaboratively with the reporting investigator to 
determine if a serious adverse event has a reasonable possibility of having been caused by [CONTACT_563169], as outlined in 21 CFR 312.32(a)(1), and below. The CC unblinded statistician  will 
also determine if the event is unexpected for lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir.   An adverse is considered “unexpected” 
if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or the study protocol (21 CFR 312.32(a)). If a determination 
is made that a serious adverse event has a reasonable possibility of having been caused by a study 
procedure or the study drug, it will be classified as a suspected adverse reaction. If the suspected adverse 
reaction is unexpected,  it will be classified as a serious unexpected suspected adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R).  
To enhance safety monitoring, the VCC will report every death by [CONTACT_563170] (and potentially 
unblinded group upon request) to the  DSMB. The  VCC will also report all unexpe cted deaths, serious and 
treatment related adverse events, and S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the DSMB, and s IRB within 7 days after receipt of the 
report from a clinical site. A written report will be sent to the DSMB  and the s IRB within 15 calendar 
days. The DSMB will also review all reported adverse events and clinical outcomes during scheduled 
interim analyses. The V CC will distribute the written summary of the DSMB’s periodic review of 
reported adverse events to the sIRB. The VCC will provide to [COMPANY_013] Pharmacovigilance any safety 
findings for lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir  (without disclosing protected health information) during the conduct of the 
trial per contractual  language .  
C.1. Unanticipated Problems (UP)  
Investigators must also report Unanticipated Problems, regardless of severity, associated with study 
procedures within 24 hours. An unanticipated problem is defined as follows: any incident, experience, or 
outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected, in terms of nature, severity, or frequency, given the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and the characteristics of the subject population being studied.  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research, in this guidance document, possibly 
related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459] .  
• Sugge sts that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
C.2. Determining Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug or Study Procedures  
Investigators will be asked to grade the strength of the relationship of an adverse event to study drug or 
study procedures as follows:  
• Definitely Related: The event follows: a) A reasonable, temporal sequence from a study 
procedure; and b) Cannot be explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical state 
TREAT NOW Protocol Version 1.6  
January 26, 2021   Page 36 of 40 or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and c) Evaluation of the patient’s clinical state indicates to the investigator that 
the experience is definitely related to study procedures.  
• Probably or Possibly Related: The event should be assessed following the same criteria for 
“Definitely Associated”. If in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_563136], then “probably” or “possibly” associated should be selected.  
• Probably Not  Related: The event occurred while the patient was on the study but can reasonably 
be explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
• Definitely Not Related: The event is definitely produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clin ical state or by [CONTACT_563171].  
• Uncertain Relationship: The event does not meet any of the criteria previously outlined.  
C.3. Clinical Outcomes that may be Exempt from Adverse Event Reporting  
Study -specific outcomes of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], COVID-19, and critical illness will be 
systematically collected for all patients in both study group and are exempt from adverse event 
reporting unless the investigator considers the event to be Definitely or Possibly Related  (or of an 
Uncertain Relationship) to the study drug or study procedures.  Examples of study-specific clinical 
outcomes include:  
• Death not related to the study procedures .  
• Neurological events 
o Seizure  
• Cardiovascular events  
o Receipt of vasopressors  
o Atrial or ventricular arrhythmia  
o Cardiac arrest  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343]  
o Hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen 
o Acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] 
o Receipt of mechanical ventilation  
o Receipt of extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation  
• Gastrointestinal events  
o Elevation of aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase 
o Acute pancreatitis 
• Renal events  
o Acute kidney injury  
o Receipt of renal replacement therapy  
• Endocrine events  
o Symptomatic hypoglycemia  
• Hematologic or coagulation events  
o Neutropenia, lymphopenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia  
• Dermatologic events 
o Severe dermatologic reaction (e.g., Steven’s Johnson Syndrome)  
TREAT NOW Protocol Version 1.6  
January 26, 2021   Page 37 of 40 Note: A study -specific clinical outcome may also qualify as a reportable adverse event.  For example, a 
ventricular arrhythmia that the investigator considers Definitely or Possibly Related  to the study drug 
would be both recorded as a study-specific clinical outcome and reported as a Serious and Definitely or 
Possibly Related Adverse Event.

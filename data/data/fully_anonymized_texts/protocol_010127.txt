Protocol Number:  CC-5013-CLL-002 
Protocol Title:  A PHASE 3, MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, 
PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, PARALLEL-GROUP  STUDY OF THE EFFICACY AND 
SAFETY OF LENALIDOMIDE (REVLIMID®) AS MAINTENANCE THERAPY FOR 
PATIENTS WITH B-CELL CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LE[LOCATION_006]EMIA FOLLOWING SECOND-LINE THERAPY 
Indication: Maintenance therapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who ha ve achieved at least partial response (PR) to second-line 
therapy. 
Study Duration:  Subjects randomized to the lenalidomide 
treatment arm and on treatment at the time of Amendment #10 
may, at the discretion of the investigator, continue on 
lenalidomide study treatment until disease progression (PD) 
develops.  Subjects randomized to the placebo treatment arm 
and on treatment at the time of Amendment #10 will enter the survival follow-up period.  Subjects who discontinue study 
treatment prematurely for reasons other than PD and subjects 
who develop PD (including disease transformation) will enter 
the survival follow-up period.   
Subjects will be followed until all subjects in the study have 
been followed for at least [ADDRESS_156485] randomization, 
October 2020, (or have died/become  lost to follow-up before 
the 5 years).  
Amendment #11: 
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment will discontinue 
lenalidomide treatment immediately and complete the 
Treatment Discontinuation assessme nt.  The subjects will then 
transition to the survival follow-up period.  Phase of development:  
Phase 3 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
x To compare the efficacy of lenalidomide versus  placebo maintenance therapy. 
Secondary: 
x To evaluate the safety of lenalidomide versus placebo maintenance therapy. 
Study Endpoints:

Study Design: 
CC-5013-CLL-[ADDRESS_156486] partial response (PR) with 
second-line therapy.  The primary efficacy objectiv e of this study is to demonstrate superiority 
of lenalidomide over placebo in prolonging overall survival (OS) due to continued therapy, for 
all subjects, including subjects with or without p oor prognostic factors, subjects of various ages 
and subjects with PR, nodular partial response (n PR), complete response with incomplete bone 
marrow recovery (CRi), complete respon se (CR) and minimal residual disease (MRD)-
negative CR.  All subjects randomized to the lenalidomide treatment arm, including those 
subjects who do not improve their response (P R, nPR, CRi or CR) and subjects who do not 
have the opportunity to improve their response further (MRD-negative CR) will be treated up 
to disease progression, with the objec tive to demonstrate prolongation of OS. 
Eligible subjects must have been treated with a purine analog-, a bendamustine-, an anti-CD20-
antibody-, or a chlorambucil-based regimen in first and/or second line and must have achieved 
at least PR to second-line induction therapy of sufficient duration.  Alemtuzumab- containing 
regimens will also be allowed for those subj ects with 17p deletion.  Subjects who achieve 
stable disease (SD) only or w ho develop progressive disease (P D) at any time during induction 
therapy will not be eligible for participation in this study. 
Approximately, three hundred twenty (320) su bjects with PR, nPR, CRi, CR or MRD-negative 
CR will be enrolled and randomized (1:1) into two arms:  placebo daily or lenalidomide 2.[ADDRESS_156487] 28-day cycle.  If the 2.5 mg dose level is well tolerated, 
escalation to 5 mg daily on days 1-28 of each 28-day cycle is permitted starting with the 
second cycle; for those subjects who tolerate we ll the 5 mg dose, escalation to 10 mg daily on 
days 1-28 of each 28-day cycl e after 5 continuous cycles at 5 mg will be permitted. 
Each treatment arm will be stratified according to 1) the response to second-line induction 
therapy (PR, nPR, CRi or CR versus MRD-negative CR); 2 DJHYHUVXV!\HDUVDQG
3) presence of at least one of the following poor prognostic factors:  11q deletion, 17p deletion, 
unmutated IgVH or ȕ0!PJ/ (Yes versus No versus Unknown). 
The subjects randomized to the lenalidomide treatment arm will continue to receive 
lenalidomide study drug up to PD.  Subjects who di scontinue therapy, will enter the survival 
follow-up phase of the study.  Subjects will be a ssessed for subsequent CLL therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], second 
primary malignancies, recovery from serious adverse events (SAEs), and any new SAEs or 
AEs related to study procedures or prior maintenance therapy.   
Subjects randomized to the placebo arm and currently on treatment at the time of Amendment 
#10 and patients who previously discontinued from the study drug and will be followed every 
24 weeks for survival, subsequent CLL therapie s, response to next therapy and progression

Amendment #11: 
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment  will discontinue lenalidomide treatment 
immediately and complete the Treatment Discon tinuation assessment.  The subjects will then 
transition to the survival follow-up period. 
Screening 
Subjects will sign informed consent prior to undergoing any study- related procedures. 
Screening assessments for protocol eligibility will be performed within 28 days prior to 
randomization as outlined in Table 2 : Schedule of Assessments.  Subjects who develop PD 
during screening will not be eligible to enroll into this study. 
All subjects will undergo both bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_137723].  MRD status will be assessed by [CONTACT_137765] a complete response (CR) to 
second-line induction therapy.  Peripheral bl ood flow cytometry will be performed for all 
subjects at entry to confirm disease diagnosis by [CONTACT_137766][INVESTIGATOR_137724] (NK and T cell) analyses.  If subjects ente r the study with MRD negativity, the disease 
diagnosis will be confirmed based on prior fl ow cytometry (documentation needed).  MRD 
status, immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and immune cell an alyses will be performed at a central 
laboratory.   
A peripheral blood sample for direct antiglobulin  test (DAT) will be collected during screening 
and analyzed at a central laboratory. 
Before randomization, subjects will be tested for cytogenetics by [CONTACT_4656], IgV H mutational status , 
DQGȕ07KHȕ0WHVWZLOOEHSHUIRUPHGGXULQJVFUHHQLQJXVLQJ DSHULSKHUDOEORRGVDPSOH  
and analyzed at a central laboratory. 
FISH and IgV H testing will be performed prior to second line, during second line, in the 
interval between second-line therapy, and sc reening or during the screening period using a 
peripheral blood sample.  Because test results cannot be obtained during screening or between 
second line and screening in some subjects w ho achieve a good response due to the limited 
number of remaining CLL cells, we r ecommend conducting the FISH and IgV H tests preferably 
prior to second line or during second line.   Samples for FISH and IgV
H will be analyzed at a central laboratory. 
If tests do not yield results, subjects can be ran domized and stratified base d on historical data. 
Those subjects for whom results were not ob tainable pre-randomization and for whom no 
historical data were available will be enrolled and grouped separately. 
During screening, CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis will also be performed for all 
subjects; in particular, they will be used to doc ument the status (PR or CR) of subjects entering 
the study.   
If, during the screening period, the subject has a correctable event that prevents randomization 
and the event cannot be corrected within the [ADDRESS_156489] may be re-
screened; however, the CT scans and bone marr ow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_137725] w ithin [ADDRESS_156490]’s clinical status remains the same.

adverse events regardless of causal relati onship to study drug, occurring at any 
time for the duration of the study, from the time of signing the informed consent up 
to and including the su rvival follow-up phase  
  
  
  
Statistical Analysis: 
Overview: The objective of the statistical analysis will be to compare the efficacy and safety of 
lenalidomide versus placebo as maintenance therap y in subjects with relapsed or refractory B-
cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) having achieved PR or better after second-line 
therapy. Overall Survival (OS) will be the primar y endpoint for the study following protocol 
amendment #10. Sample Size:  
For OS, a 61.3% improvement in median surv ival from randomization, from 3 years for 
placebo to 4.84 years on lenalidomide is considered  clinically relevant.  The OS distribution is 
assumed to be exponential with a constant failure  (hazard) rate.  At the conclusion of the study 
a two-sided log-rank test with an overall signif icance level of 0.[ADDRESS_156505] 80% power to 
detect a hazard rate ratio of 0.62. To ensure timely completion of the study, [ADDRESS_156506]. 
Demographic, Disposition, Study Medication:    
The baseline characteristics of subjects enrolled in each arm will be summarized.  An 
accounting will be made of the study course fo r all subjects who received study drug for each 
arm and, in particular, the number of subjects  who expi[INVESTIGATOR_137733].  
Efficacy Analysis: Efficacy analyses will be performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population that includes all 
subjects randomized.

Safety Analysis: 
All subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_156507] incidence rates of a ll AEs (including serious, Grade 3, Grade 4, 
treatment-related [with and without discontinuation]  and events requiring the discontinuation 
of investigational product), will be tabulated by [CONTACT_137775], pr eferred term, and severity using 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activitie s (MedDRA) terms and NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 
severity grades with modifications. (Section  10.2.1 ).  Time to first dose reduction will be 
summarized.  The adverse event of infection will also be analyzed according to the grading 
system as recommended by [CONTACT_137776] 
(Appendix  22.4). 
Death and clinically important AEs (including  tumor flare, tumor lysis, second primary 
malignancies, and thrombosis ) will also be summarized. 
All other measurements will be summarized using means, standard deviations, medians, 
minimum, and maximum.  Graphical displays will be provided where useful in the interpretation of results.

line therapy.  The primary effi cacy objective of this study is to demonstrate superiority of 
lenalidomide over placebo in prolonging OS due to continued thera py, for all subjec ts, including 
subjects with or without poor progn ostic factors, subjects of vari ous ages and subjects with PR, 
nodular partial response (nPR), co mplete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi), 
complete response (CR), and min imal residual disease (MRD)-negative CR.  All subjects 
randomized to the lenalidomide ar m, including those s ubjects who do not imp rove their response 
(PR, nPR, CRi, or CR) and subjects who do not have the opportunity to  improve their response 
further (MRD-negative CR) will be treated up to  disease progression with the objective to 
demonstrate prolongation of OS. 
Amendment #11: 
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment  will discontinue lenalidomide treatment 
immediately and complete the Treatment Discon tinuation assessment.  The subjects will then 
transition to the survival follow-up period. 
Eligible subjects must have been  treated with a purine analog-, a bendamustine-, an anti-CD20 
antibody-, or a chlorambucil-based regimen in first and/or second line and must have achieved at 
least PR to second-line induc tion therapy of sufficient dura tion. Alemtuzumab- containing 
regimens will also be allowed for those patients  with 17p deletion.  Subjec ts who achieve stable 
disease (SD) only or who develop progressive disease (PD) at a ny time during induction therapy 
will not be eligible for pa rticipation in this study. 
Approximately, three hundred twenty (320) subj ects with PR, nPR, CRi, CR or MRD-negative 
CR will be enrolled and randomized (1:1) into tw o arms:  placebo daily or lenalidomide 2.[ADDRESS_156528] complete one full cycle at the 2.5 mg  dose level prior to escal ation to the 5 mg dose 
level.  For those subjects who to lerate the 5 mg dose without un acceptable toxicity, escalation to 
10 mg daily on days 1-28 of each 28-day cycle after 5 continuous cycles at 5 mg will be 
permitted.  Each treatment arm wi ll be stratified according to 1) the response to second-line 
induction therapy (PR, nPR,  CRi or CR versus MRD- QHJDWLYH&5DJHYHUVXV!
years); and 3) presence of at least one of the following poor prognostic factors:  11q deletion, 
17p deletion, unmutated IgV H or ȕ0!PJ/  (Yes versus No versus Unknown). 
The subjects randomized to the lenalidomide treatment will continue to receive lenalidomide up 
to PD.  For those subjects who discontinue ther apy for reasons other than PD (ie, unacceptable 
toxicity) they will transition to the survival follow-up period.  
Subjects who discontinued from the study drug will be followed every 24 weeks for survival, 
subsequent CLL therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], res ponse to next therapy and progre ssion following next therapy, and

Screening: 
Potential study subjects will be screened for protocol eligibility within 28 days prior to 
randomization as outlined in Table 2 .  Please refer to Figure 1 . 
During the screening process for potentially prot ocol-eligible subjects, complete blood counts 
(CBCs), serum chemistries, thyroid function test s, quantitative immunoglobulin tests, a 12-lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG), physical exam to asse ss lymphadenopathies, the spleen and the liver, 
vital signs (with weight), East ern Cooperative Oncology Group (E COG) performance status, and 
evaluation of constitutional symptoms will be performed. Bone marrow biopsies and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_137734].  A central 
review of the bone marr ow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_137735].  Subjects who develop PD during screening w ill not be eligible to enroll into this study.  
Peripheral blood will be sent to a central labora tory for flow cytometr y for all subjects for 
disease diagnosis confirmation (by [CONTACT_137777][INVESTIGATOR_007]), to perform immune cell (NK and T 
cell) analyses and for subjects en tering the study with a CR for de termination of MRD status. If 
peripheral blood is MRD negative, a bone marrow flow cytometry will be implemented. If 
subjects enter the study with MR D negativity, the diseas e diagnosis will be confirmed based on 
prior flow cytometry (d ocumentation needed). 
A peripheral blood sample for a dire ct antiglobulin test (DAT) will be  collected and analyzed at a 
central laboratory. 
Before randomization, subjects will be tested for cytogenetics by [CONTACT_4656], IgV

analyzed at a central laboratory. FISH and IgV
H testing will be performed prior to second line, during second line, in the interval 
between second-line therapy and screening or during the screening period using a peripheral 
blood sample.  Because test results cannot be obtained during screening or between second line 
and screening in some subject s who achieve a good response du e to the limited number of 
remaining CLL cells, we recommend conducting the FISH and IgV H tests preferably prior to 
second line or during second line.   
Samples for FISH and IgV H will be analyzed at a central laboratory. 
If tests do not yield results, subjects can be rando mized and stratified ba sed on historical data. 
Those subjects for whom results were not ob tainable pre-randomiz ation and for whom no 
historical data were available will be enrolled and grouped separately. 
An additional peripheral blood sample will be collected at baseline and stored  at -70° at a central 
laboratory until the completion of the study; subject s will be re-consented if additional testing is 
to be performed. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest,  abdomen, and pelvis will be performed at 
baseline for all subjects to document the subject’s status (PR or CR).

Randomization: Randomization must occur no less than 8 weeks (56 days) and no greater than 20 weeks (140 
days) from the last day of the last cycle of second -line induction therapy received by [CONTACT_137778].  Subjects meeting all 
eligibility criteri a will be randomized (1:1 ) in a double-blind fash ion to receive either 
lenalidomide or placebo.  The randomization procedure will be accomplished by a validated 
interactive voice response system (IVRS) (see Section  10.1.1). Subjects will be stratified at 
randomization by: 1) their respons e to second-line induction thera py (PR, nPR, CRi or CR versus

Maintenance Therapy: 
Study treatment for each subject begins on the same day the subject undergoes randomization.  
Lenalidomide is administered orally.  Subjects will receive lenalidomide 2.[ADDRESS_156534] 28-day cycle.  If the 2.5 mg dose is well tolerated (subject does not

10.1. Description of Study Drug 
Celgene Corporation will supply lenalidomide 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg  capsules for oral 
administration.  Subjects dose reduced to 7.5 mg dose level (as outlined in Section  10.2.1 ) will 
receive one 5.0 mg capsule and one 2.5 mg capsule daily. 
Study drug will be packaged in bottles containing  study capsules for 28 days.  Subjects assigned 
to active treatment will receive 28 days of active drug (with the exception of those subjects de-
escalated to 2.5 mg every other day).   
Celgene Corporation will no longer supply b linded allopurinol 300 mg  and matching placebo 
(Amendment #10). 
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment will discontinue lenalidomide treatment immediately.  
Celgene Corporation will no longer supply lenalidomide (Amendment #11). 
10.1.1. Randomization 
Randomization will be accomplished by [CONTACT_137782].  Designated resear ch personnel at the investiga tional sites will be assigned 
password protected, coded identifi cation numbers, which gives them authorization to call into the 
IVRS to enroll subjects.  The system will present a menu of questions by [CONTACT_137783]. Wh en all questions have been 
answered, including questions regarding the result s of pregnancy tests for FCBP, the IVRS will 
assign a subject number  and study drug to the eligible subject. IVRS will fax a confirmation of 
registration and drug assignment for each subject to  the site and Celgene.   Subjects will be 
randomized (1:1) to receiv e lenalidomide or placebo.  Subjects will be stratified at randomization 
by: 1) their response to second-line induc tion therapy (PR, nPR, CRi or CR versus

dose level may be escalated to 10.0 mg once da ily on days 1 through 28 of each 28-day cycle 
up to disease progression. 
Amendment #11: 
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment  will discontinue lenalidomide treatment 
immediately and complete the Treatment Discon tinuation assessment.  The subjects will then 
transition to the survival follow-up period. 
10.2.1. Dose Modification or Interruption 
Subjects will be evaluated for AEs at each visit with the NCI CTCAE (Version 3.0) used as a 
guide for the grading of severity with the ex ceptions recommended by [CONTACT_3433] e IWCLL guidelines for 
the diagnosis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia  as listed below*:

Other decreases in the white blood cell count, or in circ ulating granulocytes, are not to be considered, since a

16.1. Statistical Overview 
The objective of the statistical analysis will be to compare the efficacy and safety of 
lenalidomide versus placebo as maintenance th erapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory 
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leuke mia (CLL) having achieved PR or better afte r second-line 
therapy. 
Overall survival (OS) will be the primary e ndpoint for the protocol following amendment #10.  
This analysis will be performed at the completion of the study.  It is estimated that at least [ADDRESS_156575] died at the time of an alysis (yielding 80% power to 
detect a 61.3% improvement in me dian OS for a two-sided test at 0.025 level allowing for one 
interim analysis).   
16.2. Study Population Definitions 
16.2.1. Intent-to-Treat Population 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed  on the intent-to-trea t (ITT) population, which 
will include all subjects  who were randomized. 
16.2.2. Safety Population 
All randomized subjects who receive any study dr ug will be included in the safety analyses. 
16.2.3. Subgroup Analyses 
In addition to analyses that include all subj ects, analyses will be performed to compare 
treatments within the following stratification subgroups: 
x Response to second-line induction ch emotherapy (PR, CRi or CR versus 
MRD-negative CR) 
x $JH\HDUVYHUVXV!\HDUV 
x Presence of at least one of the follow ing poor prognostic factors:  11q deletion, 17p 
deletion, unmutated IgV H or ȕ0!PJ/  (Yes versus No versus Unknown) 
Additional subgroups may be examined, as needed  based on regulatory and clinical requests. 
16.3. Efficacy Evaluation 
16.3.1. Primary Endpoint 
Overall Survival (OS) 
Overall survival is calculated as the time from randomization to death from any cause.  OS will 
be censored at the last date that  the subject was known to be alive for subjects who were alive at 
the time of analysis and for subjects who were  lost to follow-up before  death was documented.

16.3.2. Secondary Endpoint 
Progression Free Survival 2 (PFS2) 
PFS is defines as the time from randomization to the second objective di sease progression, or 
death from any cause, whichever occurs first.  Patients alive and for whom a second objective 
disease progression has not been observed should be  censored at the last time known to be alive 
and without second objective dise ase progression.  In situations where OS and PFS2 cannot 
reliably be determined, it may be  possible to rule out significant lack of efficacy of further 
treatments by [CONTACT_137791].  Fo r this analysis, an event is 
defined as second objective dis ease progression, or death from any cause, or the start of the CLL 
therapy after next line trea tment, whichever occurred first (EMEA guideline 13 DEC 2012).  
Various schemes will be assessed for missing data imputation if needed. 
16.3.3. Efficacy Analyses 
Kaplan-Meier product limit methods will be used to  estimate the survivor ship functions for the 
time-to-event endpoints (eg, OS, and PFS2).  A two- sided log-rank test stratified by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_156577] were: 
H0:  F A(t) =  F P(t) for all t 
Versus 
H1:  F P(t)  FA(t) for all t 
where F P is the survivorship function for placebo and F A is the survivorship function for 
lenalidomide. Median OS will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier  estimates, and the 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) will be computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.  Hazard ratio will be 
calculated using Cox model strati fied for the 3 strata (ie, response to second-line induction 
chemotherapy, age, and presence of  at least one prognostic factor) to account for the stratified 
randomization.  The Cox model will also be used to identify prognostic factors. 
Cross-tabulations will be provided by [CONTACT_137792]. 
16.4. Background and Demographic Characteristics 
Subjects’ age, weight, height, and other conti nuous demographic and baseline variables will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum), 
while performance status, gender, race, and othe r categorical variables will be summarized with 
frequency tabulations for each treatment group separately and pooled over both treatment

evaluation) will be provided.  Reasons for discontinuation will be summarized. 
  
 
 
 
16.7. Safety Evaluation 
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study medication will be included in the safety 
analyses. 
Adverse events (AE) will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) classification system. The severity of the toxicities will be graded according to the 
NCI CTCAE version 3.0 whenever possible. The adverse event of infection will also be analyzed according to the grading system as 
recommended by [CONTACT_137793]  
(Appendix  22.4). 
AE frequency will be tabulated by [CONTACT_6764], MedDRA preferred term for each treatment 
regimen during the Treatment Phase.   In the by-subject analysis, a subject having the same event 
more than once will be counted only once.  AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_137794] 3.0 grade.  AEs leading to death or to discontinua tion from treatment, ev ents classified as 
NCI CTCAE version 3.0 Grade 3 or higher, study-drug-related events, serious adverse events 
(SAEs), and events of interest (including s econd primary malignancies) will be summarized 
separately. 
Laboratory data will be graded  according to NCI CTCAE versi on 3.[ADDRESS_156579] in the interpretation of results.

16.9. Sample Size and Power Considerations 
For OS, a 61.3% improvement in median survival  from randomizati on, from 3 years for placebo 
to 4.83 years on lenalidomide is c onsidered clinically relevant.  The OS is assumed to be 
exponential with a constant failure (hazard) ra te.  When the total number of events is 
approximately [ADDRESS_156580] with an overall 
significance level of 0.025 (allowi ng for one interim analysis) would have 80% power to detect a 
hazard rate ratio of 0.62 (that is, if the surviv al curves are exponential, to detect a 61.3% 
difference in the median OS in  the 2 arms). To ensure time ly completion of the study, [ADDRESS_156581].

17.1. Monitoring 
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring proc edures are performed before, during and after 
the study.  Before the study is initiated at a site vi sit or at an investigator  meeting, all aspects of 
the study are reviewed with the investigator(s) and th e staff.   Prior to en rolling subjects into the 
study, a Celgene representative will review the protocol, CRFs, procedures for obtaining 
informed consent, record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and reporting of AEs with the Investigator(s).  Monitoring 
will include on-site visits with the Investigator(s ) and his/her staff as well as any appropriate 
communications by [CONTACT_2319], fax, or telephone.  At each  monitoring visit, the facilities, study drug 
storage area, CRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study documentation will be 
inspected/reviewed by [CONTACT_137795]. 
The monitor will review CRFs for completion and accuracy.  Accuracy will be checked by 
[CONTACT_137796] a direct comparison of the entries 
made onto the CRF against the appropriate sour ce documentation.  Any resulting discrepancies 
will be reviewed with the Investig ator(s) and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary corrections will be 
made directly to the CRFs or via queries by [CONTACT_737](s) and/or his/her staff. Monitoring 
procedures require that informed consents, a dherence to inclusion/ex clusion criteria, and 
documentation of SAEs and the proper recording be verified.  Additional monitoring activities 
may be outlined in a stud y-specific monitoring plan. 
17.2. Audits and Inspections 
In addition to the routine monitoring procedures, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance unit exists within Celgene.  From time to time, representatives of this unit will conduct audits of 
clinical research activities in accordance with Celgene standard operating procedures (SOPs) to 
evaluate compliance with Good Clinical  Practice guidelines and regulations. 
The Investigator(s) is required to permit direct access to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, CRFs, and applicable supporting records of subject part icipation for audits 
and inspections by [CONTACT_137797] l Review Board/Independent Ethic Committees (IRB/IECs), 
regulatory authorities (eg, FDA, EMA, Health Canada) and company authorized representatives.  The Investigator(s) should make every effort to be  available for the audits and/or inspections.  If

should contact [CONTACT_27740] . 
17.3. Investigator(s) Responsibilities 
Investigator responsibilities ar e set out in the International Conference on Harm onisation (ICH) 
guideline for Good Clinical Practi ce and in the US Code of Federal Regulations.  Celgene or a 
representative will contact [CONTACT_137799]-investigators who in turn 
will select their staff.  The investigator must give the monitor access to relevant records to 
confirm the above.

22.1. Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, uninten ded, or untoward medical occurrence occurring at 
any dose that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study.  It may be a new 
intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illn ess, an injury, or any concomitant impairment 
of the subject’s health, including laboratory test values (as specified by [CONTACT_65801]), 
regardless of etiology. Any medical condition that was present prior to study treatment and that 
remains unchanged or improved should not be recorded as an AE.  If there is a worsening of that 
medical condition, this should be considered an  AE.  A diagnosis or syndrome should be 
recorded on the AE page of the electronic Case Report Form rather  than the individual signs or 
symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. 
All AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_3433] e Investigator(s) from the time of signing of informed consent 
form to [ADDRESS_156588]’s source documents. 
Abnormal laboratory values defined as adverse events An abnormal laboratory value is  considered to be an AE if  the laboratory abnormality is 
characterized by [CONTACT_39132]: 
x Results in discontin uation from the study. 
x Requires treatment, modification/interrupt ion of study drug dose, or any other 
therapeutic intervention. 
x Is judged by [CONTACT_737](s) to be  of significant clin ical importance. 
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of  the CRF.  If the abnormality was not a part of 
a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as the AE. 
Please note that all Grade [ADDRESS_156589] be re ported as an Adverse 
Event on the AE page of the CRF.   
Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE which: 
x Results in death 
x Is life-threatening (ie, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689][s] the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE) 
x Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137743] 
x Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to condu ct normal life functions) 
x Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Confidential and Proprietary 95 CC-5013-CLL-002 Amend 11 Final:  [ADDRESS_156590] be reported as 
serious adverse events.  This includes any second primary mali gnancy, regardless of causal 
relationship to study medication, occurring at any time for the dur ation of the study, from the 
time of signing the ICF up to and including any follow-up, observation and/or survival follow-up 
period.  In this study, subjects will be followed un til all subjects in the study have been followed 
for at least [ADDRESS_156591] randomization, October 2020  (or have died/become lost to 
follow-up before 5 years).  Events of second pr imary malignancy are to  be reported using the 
SAE report form and must be cons idered an “Important Medical Ev ent” even if no other serious 
criteria apply; these events must also be docum ented in the appropriate page(s) of the CRF and 
subject's source documents.  Docu mentation of the diagnosis of the second primary malignancy 
must be provided at the time of reporting as a serious adverse event (eg, any confirmatory 
histology or cytology results).    Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137744]: were planned before entry into the 
clinical study; are for elective treatment of a condition unrelated to the studied indication or its 
treatment; occur on an emergency outpatient basis and do not result in admission (unless 
fulfilling other criteria above); are part of the normal treatment or monitoring of the studied 
indication and are not associated wi th any deterioration in condition. 
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE page s of the CRF and the SAE Report Form must be 
completed. 
For each SAE, the Investigator(s) will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to study drug, action ta ken regarding study drug, and outcome. 
Classification of severity For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator(s) mu st assess the severity of the event. 
The severity of AEs will be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE, Vers ion 3.0) with the 
exceptions recommended by [CONTACT_137805]: 
Grade 1 = Mild Grade 2 = Moderate 
Grade 3 = Severe 
Grade 4 =  Life Threatening or disabling AE Grade 5 =  Death

an expedited manner.  Laboratory values will be captured within the study database and will be 
reviewed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_3433] e sponsor and (provided that it is determined that any 
observed individual abnormalit ies or patterns of abnormali ties do not warrant prompt 
communication to Health Authorities) will be reported to  Health Authorities  in periodic safety 
reports. 
Please note that all Grade [ADDRESS_156593] be re ported as an Adverse 
Event on the AE page of the CRF.   
Classification of Relationship/Causality of  adverse events (SAE/AE) to study drug 
The Investigator(s) must determine the relations hip between the administration of study drug and 
the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below: 
Not suspected: The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study drug 
administration makes a causal relationship unlikely or 
remote, or other medications, ther apeutic interventions, or 

Lenalidomide (CC-5013)

Confidential and Proprietary 97 CC-5013-CLL-002 Amend 11 Final:  16 March 2018  underlying conditions provide a su fficient explanation for the 
observed event 
Suspected: The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study drug 
administration makes a causal relationship possible, and other 
medications, therapeutic interven tions, or underlying conditions 
do not provide a sufficient expl anation for the observed event.  
Monitoring and reporting of adverse events 
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study.  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all of the followi ng parameters: the subject’s clinical symptoms; laboratory, 
pathological, radiological, or surgical findings; physical examination findings; or other 
appropriate tests and procedures. 
Immediate reporting of serious adverse events  
Any AE that meets the criteri on for a SAE requires the comple tion of a SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE pages of the CRF.  The Investigator(s) is required to ensure 
that the data on these forms is accurate and cons istent.  This applies to all SAEs, regardless of 
relationship to study drug, that occur during th e study, those made known to the Investigator(s) 
within [ADDRESS_156594]’s  treatment discontinuation visit,  and those made known to the 
investigator(s) at anytime that are su spected of being related to study drug. 
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of intere st and must be reported as 
serious adverse events.  This includes any second primary mali gnancy, regardless of causal 
relationship to study medication, occurring at any time for the dur ation of the study, from the 
time of signing the ICF up to and including any follow-up, observation and/or survival follow-up 
period.  In this study, subjects will be followed un til all subjects in the study have been followed 
for at least [ADDRESS_156595] randomization, October 2020 (or have died/become lost to 
follow-up before 5 years).  Events of second pr imary malignancy are to  be reported using the 
SAE report form and must be cons idered an “Important Medical Ev ent” even if no other serious 
criteria apply; these events must also be docum ented in the appropriate page(s) of the CRF and 
subject's source documents.  Docu mentation of the diagnosis of the second primary malignancy 
must be provided at the time of reporting as a serious adverse event (eg, any confirmatory 
histology or cytology results).    
Grade 4 hematologic abnormalities are expected in patients with CLL, and are also observed in 
patients receiving lenalidomide.  The investigat or will use their judgeme nt to classify the 
seriousness of laboratory abnormality events.  La boratory values will be captured within the 
study database and will be reviewed on an ongoing  basis by [CONTACT_23638] (provided that it is 
determined that any observed individual abnormalities or pa tterns of abnormalities do not 
warrant prompt communication to Heath Authorities) will be reported to  Health Authorities  in 
periodic safety reports. 
The SAE must be reported (ie, within 24 hours of the Investigators’ knowledge of the event) to 
the Celgene Safety by [CONTACT_6972].  An initial writ ten report (prepared by [CONTACT_3433] e Investigator(s) using 
the SAE Report Form provided by [CONTACT_27718]) is to be faxed to the Safety Monitor (see below for 
contact [CONTACT_3031]).

become available.  Any follow-up data will be detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form, and 
sent to Celgene. 
The Investigator(s) is respons ible for informing the Institutional Review Board/Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC) of the SAE and providing th em with all relevant initial and follow-up 
information about the event. Th e Investigator(s) must keep c opi[INVESTIGATOR_137746], 
including correspondence with Ce lgene and the IRB/IEC, on file.  All SAEs that have not 
resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s pa rticipation in the study must be followed until 
either the event resolves completely, stabilizes/res olves with sequelae, or returns to baseline (if a 
baseline value is available). 
Pregnancies 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnanc ies (including a positive pregnanc y test regardless of age or 
disease state) of a female subject or  the female partner of a male subject  occurring while the 
subject is on study drug, or within  [ADDRESS_156597] 
instructed to return any unused portion of the study drug to the i nvestigator(s).  The pregnancy, 
suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test mu st be reported to the Celgene Safety Monitor 
immediately by [CONTACT_137808]. The female should be referred to an obstetr ician-gynecologist experienced in reproductive 
toxicity for further ev aluation and counseling. 
The Investigator(s) will follow the female subj ect until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Safety of the outco me of the pregnancy as a follow -up to the initial SAE report. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE (ie, 
spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any congenital an omaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be 
documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [i ncluding that in an aborted 
fetus]), the Investigator(s) shoul d follow the procedures for repor ting SAEs (ie, report the event 
to Celgene Safety by [CONTACT_31950] 24 hours of the Investigat or’s knowledge of the event). 
In the case of a live “normal” birth, the Celg ene Safety Monitor should be advised by [CONTACT_137809] 24 hour s of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event. 
All neonatal deaths that occur w ithin [ADDRESS_156598] to

related to the in utero exposure to the study drug should also be  reported to Celgene Safety by 
[CONTACT_31950] 24 hours of the Inves tigators’ knowledge of the event. 
If the female is found not to be pregnant, any determination regarding the subject’s continued 
participation in the study will be determined by [CONTACT_737](s) and the Celgene Medical 
Monitor. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events

informed consent to participate in  clinical research or talking to  your study doctor or healthcare 
provider about your medical condition or your treatment. 
What is the most important in formation I should know about lenalidomide? 
1. Lenalidomide may cause birth defects (def ormed babies) or death of an unborn 
baby.   Lenalidomide is similar to the medicine thalidomide. It is known that thalidomide 
causes life-threatening birth de fects.  Lenalidomide has not been tested in pregnant 
women but may also cause birth defects.  Findings from a monkey study indicate that 
lenalidomide caused birth defects in the offs pring of female monkeys who received the 
drug during pregnancy.   
If you are a female who is able to become pregnant: 
x Do not take study drug if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant 
x You must practice complete abstinence or  use two reliable, separate forms of 
effective birth control at the same time:   for 28 days before starting study drug 
 while taking study drug 
 during dose interruptions of study drug 
 for [ADDRESS_156609] pregnancy testing done at the following times: 
 within [ADDRESS_156610] dose of study drug

In order to ensure that an unborn baby [CONTACT_117210], your study doctor 
will confirm that you are not able to become pregnant.   
If you are a male: 
Lenalidomide is detected in trace quantities in human semen. The risk to the foetus in 
females of childbearing poten tial whose male partner is  receiving lenalidomide is 
unknown at this time. 
x Male patients (including those who have had a vasectomy) must  practice complete 
abstinence or must use a condom during sexua l contact [CONTACT_4490] a pregnant female or a 
female that can become pregnant:  While you are taking study drug

Amendment #11:  
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment will discontinue lenalidomide treatment 
immediately and complete the Treatment Discontinuation assessment.  The subject s will then 
transition to the survival follow -up period.  
Screening  
Subjects will sign informed consent prior to undergoing any study-related procedures. 
Screening assessmen ts for protocol eligibility will be performed within 28 days prior to 
randomization as outlined in Table 2 : Schedule of Assessments.  Subjects who develop PD 
during screening will not be eligible to enroll into this study.  
All subject s will undergo both bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_137723].  MRD status will be assessed by [CONTACT_137812] s who achieved a complete response (CR) to 
second -line induction therapy.  Peripheral blood flow cytometry will be performed for all 
subject s at entry to confirm disease diagnosis by [CONTACT_137766][INVESTIGATOR_137750] (NK and T cell)  analyses.  If subject s enter the study with MRD negativ ity, the disease 
diagnosis will be confirmed based on prior flow cytometry (documentation needed) .  MRD 
status, immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and immune cell analyses will be performed at a central 
laboratory.    
A peripheral blood sample for direct antiglobulin test (DAT) will be collected during screening and analyzed at a central laboratory.  
Before randomization, subjects will be tested for cytogenetics by  [CONTACT_4656], IgV
H mutational s tatus , 
and β2M.  The β2M test will be performed during screening using a peripheral blood sample and analyzed at a central laboratory . 
FISH and IgV
H testing will be performed prior to second line, during second lin e, in the 
interval between second -line therapy , and screening  or during the screening period using a 
peripheral blood sample .  Because test results can not be obtained during screening or between 
second line and screening in some subjects who achieve a good response due to the limited number of remaining CLL cells, we recommend conducting the FISH and IgV
H tests preferably 
prior to second line or during second line.   
Samples for FISH and IgV H will be analyzed at a central laboratory.  
If tests d o not yield results, subjects can be randomized and stratified based on historical data.  
Those subjects for whom results were not obtainable pre-randomization and for whom no historical data were available will be enrolled and grouped separately.  
During screening, CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis will also be performed for all subject s; in particular, they will be used to document the  status (PR or CR) of subject s entering 
the study.    
If, during the screening period, the subject has a correctable event that prevents randomization 
and the event can not be corrected within the [ADDRESS_156621] may be re -

Randomization 
Randomi zation must occur no less than 8 weeks (56 days) and no greater than 20 weeks (1 40 
days) from the last day of the last cycle of second -line induction therapy received by [CONTACT_137813].  Subject s meeting 
all eligibility criteria will be randomized (1:1) in a double -blin d manner to receive maintenance 
therapy with either lenalidomide or placebo up to disease progression.  The randomization 
procedure will be accomplished by a validated interactive voice response system (IVRS).  
Subjects will be stratified at randomization by: 1) their response to second-line induction therapy (PR, nPR, CRi or CR versus MRD-negative CR); 2) age (≤ 70 versus > 70 years); and 
3) presence of at least one of the following poor prognostic factors:  11q deletion, 17p deletion, 
unmutated IgVH or  β2M > 4.0 mg/L (Yes  versus No  versus Unknown).    
Maintenance Therapy 
Study treatment for each subject  begins on the same day the subject  undergoes randomization.  
Study visits and serial measurements of safety and efficacy during  maintenance therapy will be 
performed as outlined in Table [ADDRESS_156623] 2 8-day cycle.  If the 2.5 mg 
dose is well tolerated  (subject does not experience any Grade 3 or 4 study drug-related 
toxicities or any other toxicity [Grade 1 or 2] found to be unacceptable by [CONTACT_43755]), subjects should be escalated starting at the second cycle to [ADDRESS_156624] s who complete 5 continuous cycles at the 5 mg dose level without experiencing any 
Grade 3 or  4 study drug-related toxicities  and without  experiencing any other toxicity (Grade 1 
or 2)  found to be unacceptable by [CONTACT_137814] 10 mg once daily on 
Days 1 through 28 of each 28-day cycle  up to disease progression   
 
Dose interruptions/reductions are permitted for Grade 1 or 2 adverse events at the inves tig 
ator’s discretion.  A guideline for the reduction of the dose of lenalidomide for dose -

line therapy.  The primary efficacy objective of this study is to demonstrate superiority of 
lenalidomide over placebo in prolonging OS due to continued therapy, for all subjects, including 
subjects with or without poor prognostic factors, subjects of various ages and subjects with PR, nodular partial response (nPR), complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi), 
complete response (CR), and minimal residual disease (MRD) -negative CR.  All subjects  
randomized to the lenalidomide arm , includi ng those subjects who do not improve their response 
(PR, nPR, CRi , or CR) and subjects who do not have the opportunity to improve their response 
further (MRD -negative CR) will be treated up to disease progression   
with the obj
 ective to demonstrate prolongation of OS. 
Amendment #11: 
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment will discontinue lenalidomide treatment 
immediately and complete the Treatment Discontinuation assessment.  The subject s will then 
transition to the survival follow -up period. 
Eligible subject s must have been tr eated with a purine analog -, a bendamustine-, an  anti- CD20 
antibody-, or  a chlorambucil -based regimen in first and/or second line and must have achieved at 
least PR to second -line induction therapy of sufficient duration . Alemtuzumab - containing 
regimens w ill also be allowed for those patients with 17p deletion.  Subject s who  achieve stable 
disease (SD)  only or who develop progressive disease (PD) at any time during induction therapy 
will not be eligible for participation in this study.  
Approximately, t hree hundred twenty  (320) subject s with PR, nPR, CRi, CR or MRD -negative 
CR will be enrolled and randomized (1:1) into two arms:  placebo daily or lenalidomide 2.[ADDRESS_156663] s who tolerate the 5 mg dose without unacceptable toxicity, escalation to 
10 mg daily on days 1-28 of each 28- day cycle after 5 continuous cycles at 5 mg will be 
permitted.   Each treatment arm will be stratified according to 1) th e response to second -line 
induction therapy (PR, nPR, CRi or CR versus MRD- negative CR); 2) age (≤ 70 versus > 70 
years); and 3) presence of at least one of the following poor prognostic factors:  11q deletion, 
17p deletion, unmutated IgV
H or β2M > 4.0 mg/ L (Yes  versus No versus Unknown). 
The subjects randomized to the lenalidomide treatment will c ontinue to receive lenalidomide up 
to PD  .  For those subjects who discontinue therapy for 
reasons other than PD (ie, unacce ptable toxicity) they will transition to the survival follow -up 
period.

lost to follow  up before 5 years) .     
Screening:  
Potential study subject s will be screened for protocol eligibility within 28 days prior to 
randomization as outlined in Table 2 .  Please refer to  Figure 1 . 
During the screening process for potentially protocol- eligible subjects, complete blood counts 
(CBCs), serum chemistries, thyroid function tests, quantitative immunoglobulin tests, a 12- lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG ), physical exam to assess lymphadenopathies, the spleen and the liver, 
vital signs (with weight), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG) performance status, and 
evaluation of constitutional symptoms will be performed.  
Bone marrow biopsies and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_137757] s at screening.   A central 
review of the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_137758].  Subjects who develop PD during screening will not be eligible to enroll into this study.  
Peripheral blood will be sent to a central laboratory for flow cytometry for all subject s for 
disease diagnosis confirmation (by [CONTACT_137766][INVESTIGATOR_007]), to perform immune cell (NK and T 
cell) analyses  and for subject s entering the study with a CR for determination of MRD status. If 
peripheral blood is MRD negative, a bone marrow flow cytometry will be implemented. If 
subject s enter the study with MRD negativity , the disease diagnosis will  be c onfirmed based on 
prior flow cytometry (documentation needed). 
A peripheral blood sample for a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) will be collected and analyzed at a 
central laboratory. 
Before randomization, subjects will be tested for  cytogenetics by [CONTACT_4656], Ig VH mutational status , 
and β2M.  The β2M test will be performed during screening using a peripheral blood sample and 
analyzed at a central laboratory.  
FISH and IgV H testing will be performed prior to second line, during second line, in the interval 
between second -line therapy and screening or during the screening period using a peripheral 
blood sample .  Because test results can not be obtained during screening or between second line 
and screening in some subjects who achieve a good response due to the limited number of 
remaining CLL cells, we recommend conducting the FISH and IgV H tests preferably prior to 
second line or during second line.   
Samples for FISH and IgV H will be analyzed at a central laboratory.  
If tests do not yield results, subjects can  be randomized and stratified based on historical data. 
Those subjects for whom results were not obtainable pre -randomization and for whom no 
historical data were available will be enrolled and grouped separately.  
An additional peripheral blood sample will be collected at baseline and stored at -70° at a central 
laboratory until the completion of the study; subject s will be re -consented if additional testing is 
to be performed.

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 51 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  Computed tomography ( CT) scans of the chest, abdomen , and pelvis will be performed at 
baseline for all subject s to document the subject’s status (PR or CR).   
If, during the screening period, the subject has a correctable event that prevents randomization 
and the event can not be corrected within the 28 day screening period, the subjec t may be 
re-screened; however, the CT scans and bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_137736] [ADDRESS_156665]’s clinical status remains the same.  
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP ) must have two negative pregnancy tests performed at 
the study site prior to initiating lenalidomide therapy. The first pregnancy test will be performed 
within 10-[ADDRESS_156666] agree to birth control requirements as outlined in Appendix 22.6 during 
the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting study drug; 2) while participating in the study; and 3) at least [ADDRESS_156667] be counseled 
about pregnancy precautions and the potential risk of fetal exposure. 
Randomization: 
Randomization must occur no less than 8 weeks (56 days) and no greater than 20 weeks (1 40 
days) from the last day of the last cycle of second -line induction therapy received by [CONTACT_137817].  Subject s meeting all 
eligibility criteria will be randomized (1:1) in a double -blind fashion to receive either 
lenalidomide or placebo.  The randomization procedure will be accomplished by a validated 
interactive voice response system ( IVRS ) (see Section  10.1.1). Subject s will be stratified at 
randomization by: 1) their response to second-line induction therapy (PR, nPR, CRi  or CR versus 
MRD- negative CR); 2) age (≤ 70 versus > 70 years); and 3) p resence of at least one of the 
following poor prognostic factors:  11q deletion, 17p deletion, unmutated IgV
H or β2M > 4.0 
mg/L  (Yes  versus No  versus Unknown).   
Maintenance Therapy:  
Study treatment for each subject begins on t he same day the subject undergoes randomization.  
Lenalidomide is  administered orally.  Subject s will receive lenalidomide 2.[ADDRESS_156668] 28-day cycle.  If the 2.5 mg dose is well tolerated (subject does not experience any Grade 3 or 4 study drug- related toxicities or any other toxicity [Grade 1 or 2] 
found to be unacceptable by [CONTACT_43755]), subjects should be escalated  starting 
at the second cycle to [ADDRESS_156669] complete 
one full c
ycle at the 2.5 mg dose level prior to escalation to the 5 mg dose level.

Dose interruptions are  also permitted for Grade 1 or 2 adverse events at the investigator’s 
discretion.  A guideline for the reduct ion of the dose of lenalidomide for dose- limiting toxicity 
(DLT ) is provided (see Section  10.2.1).  
Dose re- escalation is permitted if the subject is able to complete [ADDRESS_156671] (conducted by [CONTACT_3452]) within 24 hours prior to starting study drug; the subject  may not receive study drug until the 
Investigator has verified that the pregnancy test is negative. Pregnan cy testing for FCBP will 
continue throughout the study as outlined in Table 2  and Appendix 22.6.   
Counseling regarding blood, eggs and ovum donation, and contraceptive use and the potential 
risks of fetal exposure should be performed as outlined in Appendix 22.6. 
FCBP should be monitored during the course of the study and after the end of study therapy to:  
• Ensure that pregnancy tests are performed during the course of the study and after end 
of study therapy and are negat ive (see specifics in Appendix 22.6).  
• Ensure the subject continues to practic e abstinence or remains on adequate 
contracept ion (see specifics in Appendix 22.6).  
If a FCBP becomes pregnant , treatment should be stopped and the subject referred to the 
appropriate physician.  
Male subject s should be monitored during the course of the study and after the end of study 
therapy to: 
• Ensure they commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual contact [CONTACT_137818] a condom during sexual contact [CONTACT_4490] a FCBP.

Scheduled laboratory studies (CBCs, chemistries ) will be sent to the site’s local laboratory for 
analysis purposes.  
The DAT test must be repeated if the investigator suspects haemolytic anemia and will be 
analysed  centrally during the course of the study. 
ECOG Performance Status will be measured at the treatment discontinuation  visit .

11.1. Description of Study Drug 
Celgene Corporation will supply lenalidomide 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and  10 mg capsules for oral 
administration.   Subjects dose reduced to 7.5 mg dose level (as outlined in Section  10.2.1)  will 
receive one 5.[ADDRESS_156684] s assigned 
to active treatment will receive 28  days of active drug (with the exception of those subjects de-
escalated to 2.5 mg every other day) .   
Celgene Corporation will no longer supply blinded allopu rinol 300 mg and matching placebo  
(Amendment #10). 
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment will discontinue lenalidomide treatment immediately.  
Celgene Corporation will no longer supply lenalidomide (Amendment #11). 
11.1.1. Randomization 
Randomization will be accomplished by [CONTACT_137820].  Designated research personnel at the investigational sites will be assigned password protected, coded identification numbers, which gives them authorization to call into the 
IVRS to enroll subjects.  The system will present a menu of questions by [CONTACT_137821]. When all questions have been 
answered, including questions regarding the results of pregnancy tests for FCBP, the IVRS will 
assign a subject  number  and study drug to the eligible subject . IVRS will fax a confirmation of 
registration and drug assignment for each subject  to the site and Celgene.   Subject s will be 
randomized (1:1) to receive len alidomide or placebo.  Subject s will be stratified at randomization 
by: 1) their response to second-line induction therapy (PR, nPR,  CRi or CR versus 
MRD- negative CR); 2) age (≤ 70 versus > 70 years); and 3) presence of at least one of the 
following poor prognostic factors:  11q deletion, 17p deletion, unmutated IgV
H, or β2M > 4.0 
mg/L  (Yes  versus No  versus Unknown).   
Site staff are to contact [CONTACT_137822], to register dose 
reductions or escalations, and at discontinuation from treatment.  Confirmation of each call will be faxed to the site.

Confidential and Proprietary 68 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  [ADDRESS_156686] s who are tolerating the 5 mg 
dose level may be escalated  to 10.0 mg once daily on days 1 through 28 of each 28- day cycle 
up to disease progression  
Amendment #11: 
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment will discontinue lenalidomide treatment 
immediately and complete the Treatment Discontinuation assessment.  The subject s will then 
transition to the survival follow -up period. 
11.2.1. Dose Modification or Interruption  
Subject s will be evaluated for AEs at each visit with the NCI CTCAE (Version 3.0) used as a 
guide for the grading of severity with the exceptions recommended by [CONTACT_137823]*: 
Table 4: Grading Scale for Hematological Toxicity in CLL Studies  
Grade# Decrease in Platelets* or Hb° (nadir) 
From Pretreatment value (%)  Absolute neutrophil count/μ L@ (nadir) 
0 No change to 10%  ≥ 2,000  
1 11% - 24% ≥1,500 and < 2,000  
2 25% - 49% ≥1,000 and < 1,500  
3 50% - 74% ≥ 500 and < 1,000  
4 ≥ 75%  < 500  
* Platelet counts must be below normal levels for grades 1 -4.  If, at any level of decrease the platelet count is 
<20,000/μL, this will be considered grade 4 toxicity, unless a severe or life -threatening decrease in the initial 
platelet count (eg, 20,000/μL) was present pretreatment, in which case the patient is not evaluable for toxicity 
referable to platelet counts.  
° Hb levels must be below normal levels for grades [ADDRESS_156687] be 
performed before any given transfusions.  The use of erythropoietin is irrelevant for the grading of toxicity, but should be documented.  
# Grades: 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe; 4, life -threatening; 5, fatal.  Death occurring as a result of toxicity at any 
level of decrease from pretreatment will be recorded as grade 5.  
@ If the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reaches less than 1,000/μL, it should be judged to be grade 3 toxicity.  
Other decreases in the white blood cell count, or in circulating granulocytes, are not to be considered, since a 
decrease in the white blood cell count is a desired therapeutic end point.  A gradual decrease in granulocytes is not 
a reliable index in CLL for stepwise grading of toxicity.  The use of G -CSF is irrelevant for the grading toxicity, 
but should be documented.  
In addition, TLS will be graded as specified by [CONTACT_137785]-Bishop grading s ystem ( Appendix 
22.5). Subjects meeting criteria of laboratory TLS or ≥ Grade 1 TLS, will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] (per 
investigator’s discretion for laboratory TLS), provided with vigorous intravenous hydration and 
appropriate therapy (ie , rasburicase where available) as needed to reduce hyperuricemia, until 
correction of electrolyte abnormalities.  In the case of la boratory TLS and Grade 1 TLS, 
lenalidomide will be continued at the same dose without interruption or dose reduction. Subjects with ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_156688] their dose interrupted and will resume lenalidomide at the next 
lower dose level when electrolyte abnormalities are corrected (ie , Grade 0). If lenalidomide is

professional (including but not limited to, nurses, pharmacists, and physicians).  These healthcare professionals will be trained by [CONTACT_137826].  Once 
trained these healthcare staff will counsel patients prior to  study drug being dispensed to ensure  
that the patient has complied with all requirements including use of birth control and pregnancy 
testing (FCBP) and that the patient understands the risks associated with lenalidomide.  This step 
will be documented with a completed lenalidomide Education and Counseling Guidance 
Document ( Appendix 22.6),  and no drug will be dispensed until this step occurs. Counseling 
includes verification with the patient that required pregnancy testing was per formed and results 
were negative. A  Lenalidomide Information Sheet  (Appendix 22.6) will be supplied with each 
study drug dispense.  
Celgene will instruct the Investigator(s) on the return or destruction of unused study drug.  If any 
study drug is lost or damaged, its disposition should be documented in the subject ’s CRF and 
source documents.  Celgene will provide instructions for the return of study drug supplies at the 
end of the study.

15.1. Assessments  
• Clinical laboratory evaluations:  
− Hematology: white blood cell (WBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), 
platelet count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC),  and absolute lymphocyte count 
(ALC) 
− Chemistry: calculated (method of Cockroft -Gault) creatinine c learance (screening 
only), potassium, calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, AST/SGOT, ALT/SGPT, and uric acid  
• Pregnancy testing for FCBP: serum or urine b eta-human chorionic gonadotropin 
hormone (β -HCG) pregnancy testing w ith a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL is to be 
done on FCBP only 
− FCBP should be monitored during the course of the study and after the end of 
study therapy to:  
o Ensure that pregnancy tests are performed during the course of the study and 
after end of study therapy and are negative ( see specifics in Appendix 22.6).  
o Ensure the patient continues to practice abstinence or remains on adequate 
contraception ( see specifics in  Appendix 22.6).  
o If a FCBP becomes pregnant treatment should be stopped and the patient referred to the appropriate physician 
• Male patients should be monitored during the course of the study and 28 days after 
the end of study therapy to: 
− Ensure they commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual contact [CONTACT_137790] a condom during sexual contact [CONTACT_4490] a FCBP 
− If a female partner of a male patient becom es pregnant she should be referred to 
an appropriate physician 
• Concomitant medications  
• AEs by [CONTACT_137773] 3.0 with modifications recommended by [CONTACT_137827]   
 
• Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interest and should be included as part of the assessment of adverse events throughout the course of the study.  Investigators are to report any second pri mary malignancies as serious adverse 
events regardless of causal relationship to study drug, occurring at any time for the duration of the study, from the time of signing the informed consent up to and including the survival follow up phase.

17.1. Statistical Overview 
The objective of the statistical analysis will be to compare the efficacy and safety of 
lenalidomide versus placebo as maintenance therapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory 
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) having achieved PR or better after second -line 
therapy. 
Overall survival (OS) will be the primary endpoint for the protocol following amendment #10.  
This analysis wil l be performed at the completion of the study.  It is estimate d that at least [ADDRESS_156710] died  at the time of analysis  (yielding 80% power to 
detect a 61.3 % improvement in median OS for a two-sided test at 0.025 level allowing for one 
interim analysis ).   
17.2. Study Population Definitions 
17.2.1. Intent -to-Treat Population  
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population, which 
will include all subject s who were randomized. 
17.2.2. Safety Popul ation 
All randomized subjects who receive any study drug will be included in the safety analyses. 
17.2.3. Subgroup Analyses  
In addition to analyses that include all subject s, analyses will be performed to compare 
treatments within the following stratification subgroups: 
• Response to second -line induction chemotherapy (PR, CRi or CR versus 
MRD-negative CR) 
• Age (≤ 70 years versus > 70 years)  
• Presence of at least one of the following poor prognostic factors:  11q deletion, 17p 
deletion, unmutated IgV H or β2M > 4.0 mg/L  (Yes  versus No  versus Unknown) 
Additional subgroups may be examined, as needed based on regulatory and clinical requests. 
17.3. Efficacy Evaluation 
17.3.1. Primary Endpoint  
Overall Survival (OS) 
Overall survival is calculated as the time from randomization to death from any cause.  OS will 
be censored at the last date that the subject  was known to be alive for subject s who were alive at 
the time of analysis and for subject s who were lost to follow -up before death was documented.

Confidential and Proprietary 85 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  [ADDRESS_156711] dose date of the anti -cancer therapy.  
17.3.2. Secondary Endpoint  
Progression Free Survival 2 (PFS2)  
PFS is defines as the time from randomization to the second objective disease progression, or 
death from any cause, whichever occurs first.  Patients alive and for whom a second objective disease progression has not been observed should be censored at the last time known to be alive 
and without second objective disease progression.  In situations where OS and PFS2 cannot 
reliably  be determined, it may be possible to rule out significant lack of efficacy of further 
treatments by  [CONTACT_137828].  For this an alysis, an event is 
defined as second  objective disease progression, or death from any cause, or the start of the CLL 
therapy after next line treatment, whichever occurred first (EMEA guideline 13 DEC 2012).  
Various schemes will be assessed for missing data imputation if needed.  
17.3.3. Efficacy Analyses 
Kaplan -Meier product limit methods will be used to estimate the survivorship functions for the 
time-to-event endpoints (eg, OS , and PFS2 ).  A two -sided log- rank test stratified by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_156712] were: 
H
0:  F A(t) =  F P(t) for all t  
Versus  
H1:  F P(t) ≠ FA(t) for all t  
where F P is the survivorship function for placebo and F A is the survivorship function for 
lenalidomide. Median OS will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier estimates, and the 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) will be computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.  Hazard ratio will be 
calculated using Cox model stratified for the 3 strata (ie, response to secon d-line induction 
chemotherapy, age, and presence of at least one prognostic factor ) to account for the stratified 
randomization.  The C ox model will also  be used to identify prognostic factors.  
Cross -tabulations will be provided by [CONTACT_137829]. 
17.4. Background and Demographic Characteristics 
Subjects’ age, weight, height, and other continuous demographic and baseline variables will be 
summarized using descri ptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum), 
while performance status, gender, race, and other categorical variables will be summarized with 
frequency tabulations for each treatment group separately and pooled over both treatment

18.1. Monitoring  
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after 
the study.  Before the study is initiated at a site visit o r at an investigator meeting, all aspects of 
the study are reviewed with the investigator(s) and the staff.   Prior to enrolling subject s into the 
study, a Celgene representative will review the protocol, CRFs, procedures for obtaining informed consent, record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and reporting of AEs with the Investigator(s).  Monitoring 
will include on -site visits with the Investigator(s) and his/her staff as well as any appropriate 
communications by [CONTACT_2319], fax, or telephone.  At each monitoring visit, the facilities, study drug 
storage area, CRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study documentation will be 
inspected/reviewed by [CONTACT_137830].  
The monitor will review CRFs for completion and  accuracy.  Accuracy will be checked by 
[CONTACT_137831] a direct comparison of the entries made onto the CRF against the appropriate source documentation.  Any resulting discrepancies 
will be reviewed with the  Investigator(s) and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary corrections will be 
made directly to the CRFs or via queries by [CONTACT_737](s) and/or his/her staff. Monitoring 
procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria , and 
documentation of SAEs and the proper recording be verified.  Additional monitoring activities may be outlined in a study-specific monitoring plan. 
18.2. Audits and Inspections  
In addition to the routine monitoring procedures, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance unit exists within Celgene.  From time to time, representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research activities in accordance with Celgene standar d operating procedures ( SOPs ) to 
evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and regulations. 
The Investigator(s) is required to permit direct access to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, CRFs, and applicable suppor ting records of subject participation for audits 
and inspections by [CONTACT_26057]/Independent Ethic Committees ( IRB/IECs ), 
regulatory authorities (eg , FDA, EMA, Health Canada) and company authorized representatives.  
The Investigator(s) should make every effort to be available for the audits and/or inspections.  If 
the Investigator(s) is contact[CONTACT_137832], he/she 
should contact [CONTACT_27740]. 
18.3. Investigator(s) Responsibilities 
Investigator respons ibilities are set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH) 
guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in the US Code of Federal Regulations.  Celgene or a representative will contact [CONTACT_137799] -investigators who in turn 
will select their staff.  The investigator must give the monitor access to relevant records to confirm the above.

Confidential and Proprietary 89 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  The Investigator(s) is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a record of all subjects who sign an Informed 
Consent Form and are screened for entry into the study.  For those subjects who fail screening, the reason(s) for exclusion must be recorded in the subject ’s source documents and in the IVRS 
system.  
No procedure/assessment/measurement/test other than those outlined here, or in the schedule of study assessments, is to be performed without the prior written approval of Celgene, or unless 
deemed by [CONTACT_093](s) as necessary for the subject ’s medical care.  Investigator(s) and/or 
authorized designee(s) must enter study data onto CRFs supplied by [CONTACT_27718].  The data on the 
CRF will be recorded in an anonymous manner to protect the subject’s identity by [CONTACT_2329] a unique 
identifier that will prevent personal identifiable information.  
The Investigator(s), or a designated member of the Investigators’ staff, must be available at some 
time during monitoring visits to review data and resolve any queries and to allow direct access to 
the subject’s records (eg, medical records, office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and study related charts) 
for source data ve rification.  The CRFs must be completed as soon as possible after the subject ’s 
visit but no later than prior to each monitoring visit and be made available to the Celgene 
representative(s) so that the accuracy and completeness may be checked.

The protocol for this study has been designed in accordance with the general ethical principles 
outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki (Appendix 22.2).  The review of this protocol by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC and the performance of all aspects of the study, including the methods used for 
obtaining informed consent, must also be in accordance with principles enunciated in the 
declaration, as well as ICH Guidelines, Title  21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 
[ADDRESS_156714]/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC).  A signed and dated statement that the protocol and informed consent 
have been approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC must be given to Celgene before the study initiation.  The 
names and occupations of the chairman and the members of the IRB/IE C must be supplied to 
Celgene.  
The Investigator(s) will be responsible for preparing documents for submission to the relevant IRB/IEC and obtaining written approval for this study.  The approval will be obtained prior to the initiation of the study.  
A copy of the IRB/IEC approval for the protocol and the Informed Consent is to be provided to Celgene. The approval for both the protocol and informed consent must specify the date of approval, protocol number and version, or amendment number. 
The Investigator(s) is responsible for notifying the IRB/IEC of any serious deviations from the 
protocol, or anything else that may involve added risk to subjects.  
Any advertisements used to recruit su bject s for the study must be reviewed and approved by 
[CONTACT_137800]/IEC prior to use.  
19.2. Protocol Amendments  
Any amendment to this protocol that seems appropriate, as the study progresses (eg, affects 
safety or efficacy) will be agreed upon between the coordinating and/or principal investigator(s) and the Celgene study physician.  Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/IEC for written approval before the implementation of the amended version.  The written signed approval from 
the IRB/IEC should refer specifically to the investigator(s) and to the protocol number and title 
and mention any amendment numbers that are applicable.  Celgene does not require that amendments that are administrative in nature receive IRB/IEC approval, but will be submitted to 
the IRB/IEC for information purposes.  If local IRB/IEC procedures require approval of 
administrative amendments, then study sites should follow local IRB/IEC regulations.  
19.3. Informed Consent 
The Investigator(s) must obtain informed consent of a subject or his/h er designee prior to any 
study related procedures as per Good Clinical Practices (GCP) as set forth in the 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 and ICH guidelines.

microfiches; photographic negatives, microfilm, or magnetic media; x -rays; patient files) , and 
records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved 
in the clinical study are complete, accurate, filed and retained.  
20.2. Data Management 
Data will be entered into the clinical database as per Celgene SOPs. These data wi ll be 
electronically verified through use of on-line checks during data entry, and through programmed edit checks specified by [CONTACT_6098].  Discrepancies in the data will be brought to the attention of the clinical team, and investigational site personnel, if necessary, in the form of a 
Data Clarification Form (DCF).  Resolutions to these issues will be reflected in the database.  An 
audit trail within the system will track all changes made to the data.  A quality control audit will be performed per Celgene SOP(s).  
20.3. Retention of Records 
The investigator(s) must maintain records of all study documents and supporting information relating to the conduct of the study.  This documentation includes, but is not limited to, 
protocols, case report forms, advertising for subject participation, adverse event reports, subject 
source data, correspondence with health authorities and IRBs/IECs, informed consent forms, investigator(s) curricula vitae, monitoring visit logs, laboratory reference ranges, laboratory 
certification or quality control procedures, and laboratory director curriculum vitae.  Subject files 
and other source data must be kept for the maximum period of time permitted by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307], 
institution or private practice specified below.  The study monito r must be consulted if the 
investigator(s) wishes to assign the study files to someone else, remove them to another location or is unable to retain them for a specified period.  
For studies conducted in the [LOCATION_002] under a US Investigational New Drug (IND), the 
investigator(s) must retain the study records for a minimum of 2 years after a marketing 
application for the indication is approved or for 2 years after the IND is withdrawn.  If no application is filed, or if the applic ation is not approved for the indication, the records are to be

23.1. Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence occurring at 
any dose that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study.  It may be a new 
intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject ’s health, including laboratory test values (as specified by [CONTACT_65801]), 
regardless of etiology. Any medical condition that was present prior to study treatment and that remains unchanged or improved should not be recorded as an AE.  If there is a worsening of that medical condition , this should be considered an AE.  A diagnosis or syndrome should be 
recorded on the AE page of the electronic Case Report Form rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. 
All AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_737](s) from the time of signing of informed consent 
form to [ADDRESS_156719]’s source documents.  
Abnormal laboratory values defined as adverse events  
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the laboratory abnormality is 
characterized by [CONTACT_39132]: 
• Results in discontinuation from the study. 
• Requires treatment, modification/interruption of study drug dose, or any other therapeutic intervention.

Serious adverse event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE which:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (ie, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689][s] the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE) 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject ’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Confidential and Proprietary 100 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  • Constitutes an important medical event 
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or disability, but may jeopardize the subject  or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be considered serious. 
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interest and must be reported as serious adverse events.  This includes any second primary malignancy, regardless of causal relationship to study medication, occurring at any time for the duration of the study, from the 
time of signing the ICF up to and including any follow-up, observation and/or survival follow-up period.  In this study, subjects will  be followed until all subjects in the study have been followed 
for at least [ADDRESS_156721]  randomization , October 2020  (or have died/become lost to 
follow -up before 5 years) .  Events of second primary malignancy are to be reported using the 
SAE re port form and must be considered an “Important Medical Event” even if no other serious 
criteria apply; these events must also be documented in the appropriate page(s) of the CRF and 
subject's source documents.  Documentation of the diagnosis of the second primary malignancy 
must be provided at the time of reporting as a serious adverse event (eg, any confirmatory histology or cytology results).    
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65777]: were planned before entry into the clinical study; are for elective treatment of a condition unrelated to the studied indication or its treatment; occur on an emergency outpatient basis and do not result in admission (unless 
fulfilling other criteria above); are part of the normal treatment or monitoring of the studied 
indication and are not associated with any deterioration in condition. 
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE pages of the CRF and the SAE Report Form must be 
completed. 
For each SAE, the Investigator(s) will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to study drug, action taken regarding study drug, and outcome. 
Classification of severity  
For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator(s) must assess the severity of the event.  
The severity of AEs will be graded based upon the subject ’s symptoms according to National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common T erminology Criteria (CTCAE, Version 3.0) with the 
exceptions recommended by [CONTACT_137805]:  
Grade 1 = Mild  
Grade 2 = Moderate  
Grade 3 = Severe  
Grade 4 =  Life Threatening or disabling AE 
Grade 5 =  Death

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 101 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  The following exceptions will be made as recommended by [CONTACT_137837]*: 
Grade# Decrease in Platelets* or Hb° (nadir) 
From Pretreatment value (%)  Absolute n eutrophil count/μ L@ (nadir) 
0 No change to 10%  ≥ 2,000  
1 11% - 24% ≥1,500 and < 2,000  
2 25% - 49% ≥1,000 and < 1,500  
3 50% - 74% ≥ 500 and < 1,000  
4 ≥ 75%  < 500  
* Platelet counts must be below normal levels for grades 1 -4.  If, at any level of decrease the platelet count is < 
20,000/μL, this will be considered grade 4 toxicity, unless a severe or life -threatening decrease in the initial 
platelet count (eg, 20,000/μL) was present pretreatment, in which case the patient is not evaluable for toxici ty 
referable to platelet counts.  
° Hb levels must be below normal levels for grades [ADDRESS_156722] be 
performed before any given transfusions.  The use of erythropoietin is irrelevant for the grading of toxicity, but 
should be documented.  
# Grades: 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe; 4, life -threatening; 5, fatal.  Death occurring as a result of toxicity at any 
level of decrease from pretreatment will be recorded as grade 5.  
@ If the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reaches  less than 1,000/μL, it should be judged to be grade 3 toxicity.  
Other decreases in the white blood cell count, or in circulating granulocytes, are not to be considered, since a 
decrease in the white blood cell count is a desired therapeutic end point.  A  gradual decrease in granulocytes is not 
a reliable index in CLL for stepwise grading of toxicity.  If the ANC was less than 1,000/μL prior to therapy, the 
patient is not evaluable for toxicity referable to the ANC.  The use of G -CSF is irrelevant for the grading toxicity, 
but should be documented.  
Grade [ADDRESS_156723] of CC-5013- CLL -002, all Grade 4 
laboratory abnormalities will be  reported to Celgene Drug Safety as SAEs at the discretion of the 
investigator and recorded in the CRF as SAEs, however those that are not deemed by [CONTACT_137807] a diagnosis or syndrome will not reported to the Health Authorities  in 
an expedited manner.  Laboratory values will be captured within the study database and will be 
reviewed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_23638] (provided that it is determined that any 
observed individual abnormalities or patterns of abnormalities do not warrant prompt 
communication to Health Authorities) will be reported to  Health Authorities  in periodic safety 
reports. 
Please note that all ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_156724] be reported as an Adverse 
Event on the AE page of the CRF.   
Classification of R elationship/Causality of adverse events (SAE/AE) to study drug  
The Investigator(s) must determine the relationship between the administration of study drug and 
the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:  
Not suspected : The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study drug 
administration makes a causal relationship unlikely or 
remote , or other medications, therapeutic interventions, or

observed event 
Suspected:  The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study drug 
administration makes a causal relationship possible,  and other 
medications, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions 
do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
Monitoring and reporting of adverse events 
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study.  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all of the following parameters: the subject ’s clinical symptoms; laboratory, 
pathological, radiological, or surgical findings; physical examination findings; or other appropriate tests and procedures.  
Immediate reporting of serious adverse events 
Any AE that meets the criterion for a SAE requires the completion of a SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE pages of the CRF.  The Investigator(s) is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  This applies to all SAEs, regardless of 
relationship to study drug, that occur during the study, those made known to the Investigator(s) 
within [ADDRESS_156725] ’s treatment discontinuation visit, and those made known to the 
investigator(s) at anytime that are suspected of being related to study drug.  
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interes t and must be reported as 
serious adverse events.  This includes any second primary malignancy, regardless of causal relationship to study medication, occurring at any time for the duration of the study, from the 
time of signing the ICF up to and including any follow-up, observation and/or survival follow-up period.  In this study, subjects will be followed until all subjects in the study have been followed 
for at least [ADDRESS_156726]  randomization , October 2020 (or have died/become lost to 
follow -up before 5 years).   Events of second primary malignancy are to be reported using the 
SAE report form and must be considered an “Important Medical Event” even if no other serious criteria apply; these events must also be documented in the appropriate page(s) of the CRF and 
subject's source documents.  Documentation of the diagnosis of the second primary malignancy 
must be provided at the time of reporting as a serious adverse event (eg, any confirmatory histology or cytology results).    
Grade 4 hematologic abnormalities are expected in patients with CLL, and are also observed in patients receiving lenali domide.  The investiga tor will use their judge ment to classify the 
seriousness of laboratory abnormality events.  Laboratory values will be captured within the 
study database and will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_23638] (provided that it is 
determined that any observed individual abnormalities or patterns of abnormalities do not warrant prompt communication to Heath Authorities) will be reported to Health Authorities  in 
periodic safety reports.  
The SAE must be reported  (ie, within 24 hours of the Investigators’ knowledge of the event) to 
the Celgene Safety by [CONTACT_6972].  An initial written report (prepared by [CONTACT_737](s) using  
the SAE Report Form provided by [CONTACT_27718]) is to be faxed to the Safety Monitor (see below for contact [CONTACT_3031]).

sent to Celgene.  
The Investigator(s) is responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board/Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC) of the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow -up 
information about the event. The Investigator(s) must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_137762], 
including correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/IEC, on file.  All SAEs that have not 
resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study must be followed until 
either the event resolves completely, stabilizes/resolves with  sequelae, or returns to baseline (if a 
baseline value is available).  
Pregnancies  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject or the female partner of a male subject  occurring while the 
subject is on study drug, or within [ADDRESS_156728] instructed to return any unused portion of the study drug to the investigator(s).  The pregnancy, 
suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to the Celgene Safety Monitor 
immediately by [CONTACT_137808].  
The female should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist experienced in reproductive 
toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. 
The Investigator(s) will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Safety of the outcome of the pregnancy as a follow-up to the initi al SAE report.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE (ie, 
spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including that in an aborted 
fetus]), the Investigator(s) should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs (ie, report the event 
to Celgene Safety by [CONTACT_31950] 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event). 
In the case of a li ve “normal” birth, the Celgene Safety Monitor should be advised by [CONTACT_137809] 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event. All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_156729] to

related to the in utero exposure to the study drug should also be reported to Celgene Safety by 
[CONTACT_31950] 24 hours of the Investigators’ knowledge of the event. 
If the female is found not to be pregnant, any determination regarding the subject’s continued 
participation in the study will be determined by [CONTACT_737](s) and the Celgene Medical 
Monitor.

Criteria for females of childbearing potential (FCBP) 
This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been naturally 
postmenopausal (amenorrhea f ollowing cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) 
for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 
consecutive months).  
Counseling 
For a female of childbearing potential, lenalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following are met (ie, all females of childbearing potential must be counseled concerning the following 
risks and requirements prior to the start of lenalidomide study therapy):  
• She understands the potential teratogenic risk to the unborn child  
• She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, 4 weeks before starting study treatment, throughout the entire duration of study treatment, dose interruption and 28 days after the end of study treatment 
• She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures 
• She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need to notify her study doctor immediately if there is a risk of pregnancy 
• She understands the need to commence the study treatment as soon as study drug is dispensed following a negative pregnancy test 
• She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing based on the 
frequency outlined in this protocol (Section  22.6.2 ) 
• She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions 
associated with the use of lenalidomide  
The investigator must ensure that for females of childbearing potential:  
• Complies with the conditions for pregnancy risk minimization, including confirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding 
• Acknowledge the aforementioned requirements

following are met (ie, all females NOT of childbearing potential must be counseled concerning 
the following risks and requirements prior to the start of lenalidomide study therapy):  
• She acknowledges that she understa nds the hazards and necessary precautions 
associated with the use of lenalidomide  
Traces of lenalidomide have been found in semen.  Male patients taking lenalidomide must meet 
the following conditions (ie, all males must be counseled concerning the following risks and 
requirements prior to the start of lenalidomide study therapy):  
• Understand the potential teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant 
female or a female of childbearing potential  
• Understand the need for the use of a condom even if he has had a vasectomy, if 
engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing 
potential.   
Contraception 
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP ) enrolled in this protocol must agree to use two reliable 
forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual 
contact [CONTACT_137810]: 1) for at least 28 days before starting study drug; 2) while participating in the study; 3) dose interruptions; and 4) f or at least 
[ADDRESS_156732] include one highly effective method and one 
additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider of 
contraceptive meth ods if needed. The following are examples of highly effective and additional 
effective methods of contraception:   
• Highly effective methods:  
− Intrauterine device (IUD) 
− Hormonal (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injections, implants) 
− Tubal ligation  
− Partner’s vasectomy  
• Additional effective methods:  
− Male condom  
− Diaphragm 
− Cervical Cap  
Implants and levonorgestrel- releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk 
of infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics 
should be considered particularly in patients with neutropenia.

3. Objectives  
              Decreasing pain and narcotic requirements in the elderly population following hip fracture could 
be associated with improved outcomes and the prevention of complications. Our goal is to conduct a 
multi -center prospective randomized control trial to determine if liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_534873]:  
 
1. Determine the effectiveness of Exparel to reduce narcotic requirements and pain post 
operatively after hip fracture treatment .  Excess narcotic use in the elderly population is associated with 
a host of complications often magnified by [CONTACT_534910], including in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_321821], increased length 
of stay, nausea, constipation, urinary retention, respi[INVESTIGATOR_534874].  Decreasing narcotic 
usage in this group of patients following hip fracture can possibly reduce such complic ations.  Patients will 
receive standard of care medical treatment and be randomized to intra -operative Exparel vs. placebo 
injections. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965], complications, pain score, and length of stay will be assessed in the post -
operative period.  
• Hypothe sis:  We hypothesize that total morphine requirements and pain scores will be decreased 
in this group following the administration of exparel in the geriatric hip fracture fracture population.  
 
2. Determine the effectiveness of Exparel  to reduce delirium in post -operative hip fracture 
patients .  In hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534875], including prolonged 
length of stay, poor participation in rehabilitation, and falls.  Use of a locally administered lip osomal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_534876], thus resulting in decreased epi[INVESTIGATOR_534877].  
We will assess delirium utilizing Con fusion Assessment Method (CAM) scores in the post -operative period 
at regularly scheduled intervals and compare average scores between the treatment / standard of care 
group.  
• Hypothesis :  We hypothesize that total epi[INVESTIGATOR_534878].  
 
3. Determine if Exparel is cost -effective in hip fracture patients .  The costs associated with 
increased narcotic usage, prolonged stay, resources, and complications can be significant.  The use of 
liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_534879].  We will 
conduct an economic analysis evaluating total inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534880], medication requirements, and resources associated with co nsultations and diagnostic 
evaluations. These costs will be compared against the cost of Exparel administration to evaluate the net 
cost effect of the intervention.  
• Hypothesis :  We hypothesize that the net cost of inpatient care will be decreased when comp ared 
to standard of care.  
H00013594  
[ADDRESS_694580] -operative confusion and delirium are relatively common15,16, 
there is the potential for treatments that decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_534881].  
Exparel (liposo mal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) and long -acting local anesthetics have been used extensively in 
hip replacement surgery and have not been shown to be associated with any increased risks17-23. In the 
case of patients with displaced femoral neck fractures treated with arthroplasty, the surgical techniques 
are identical to tho se being used in this study. Exparel has also been used in trauma surgery24 as well as 
foot and ankle surgery25 without any increased described risks, although its use explicitly in hip fractures 
has not been published. However, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_534882], but there is a paucity 
of data on this subject, which is the rationale for this study.  
                We hypothesize that in pa tients with osteoporotic fragility fractures of the hip, patients receiving 
intraoperative long -acting local anesthetics will have decreased pain and decreased post -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_534883], leading to less delirium and decreased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534884].

6. Study -Wide Number of Subjects  
                 This is a multi -center study being conducted in conjunction with the University of Kentucky. The 
total recruitment goal is [ADDRESS_694581] shown an average morphine 
sulfate equivalent of 3.5 +/ - 0.52 mg/d in the first 3 postoperative days26. That same study showed a 33% 
reduction in morphine equivalents (3.5 mg/d vs 2.1 mg/d). Assuming a similar effect size, this study would 
require only 8 patients group to be powered to 80% with a significance lev el of 0.05. With a target 
recruitment goal of [ADDRESS_694582] differences as low as 0.42 mg/d (a 
12% effect size). Assuming a 10 -20% loss to follow -up, we aim to recruit a total of 60 patients studywide 
(i.e. 30 at each si te). 
 
7. Study -Wide Recruitment Methods  
                 Recruitment methods will be the same at both University of [LOCATION_005] and University of 
Kentucky. Refer to 24. Recruitment Methods  for details of recruitment methods at University of 
[LOCATION_005].  
 
8. Study Timelines  
• Duration of an individual subject’s participation in the study  
An individual subject’s participation in the study begins at enrollment and ends after the [ADDRESS_694583] -
op follow -up period.  
• Duration anticipated to enroll all subjects  
From rec ent internal data review, we treat between 250 -300 hip fractures annually at UMMMC. We 
anticipate 10 -25% of patients will be both eligible and willing to enroll in the study, so to enroll 30 
patients should take 6 -12 months.  
• Estimated date for the investig ators to complete this study (complete primary analyses)  
Primary analysis should be completed once the final cohort of patients complete their [ADDRESS_694584] 13 -14 months after initiation of enrollment.  
 
H00013594

9. Study Endpoints  
• Primary Outcome Variables : Total morphine equivalents in the post -operative period for 24, 48, and 
72 hours, CAM score and average Pain Visual Analog Scale  
• Secondary Outcome Variables :  Length of stay, discharge disposition, timing and participation with 
inpatient physica l therapy, complications and 30 day readmission.  
 
10. Procedures Involved  
• Patient identification : Patients will be identified on morning intake rounds by [CONTACT_534911].  
• Screening/Enrollment : The research staff will review the charts to identify patients meeting the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients will be approached for study participation and enrolled in the 
study prior to surgery. For potential participants, the r esearch staff will interview the patients, confirm 
willingness to participate and inclusion/criteria.  
o We will utilize a Mini -COG (Screening for Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults)27.  A score of 
<4, whi ch has been shown to have high sensitivity for dementia screening will define cognitive 
impairment and will preclude enrollment.  
o At time of enrollment, preoperative demographics will be recorded which will include age, 
sex, comorbidities, current use of an ti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_23935]/anti -depressive medications for pain control, 
type of surgical approach, pre -ambulatory status and implant class.  
o After this review and screening, the patient will be given the opportunity to ask researchers 
questions about the study. It will be reiterated to all patients during preoperative discussions 
that their enrollment status in no way will affect their ability to get adequate post -operative 
pain control.  
• Randomization : Randomization will be done through the research pharmacy. Participant s will 
undergo block randomization (block size: 10) through a computer -generated algorithm.  
• Treatment : Surgical treatment will be performed according to the attending surgeon and is 
independent of the study. At the conclusion of surgery, they will receive  a subcutaneous injection of 
either Exparel placebo. Patients will receive operative treatment of the hip fracture per the 
operating surgeon.  At the conclusion of surgery, Exparel will be given in 20cc doses, diluted with 
40cc of normal saline to make 60c c of total injection volume. The injection solution contains a total 
of 266mg free base bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (equivalent of 300 mg bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]). The research pharmacy will 
prepare the injection solution to contain either Exparel or placebo solution. In intra -capsular 
arthroplasty cases, the solution will be injected circumferentially into the capsule, surrounding 
musculature, and subcutaneous layer. In cases with extra -capsular fractures treated with sliding hip 
screws or cephalomedullary nails, the solution wil l be administered in the deep tissue and muscles 
around the fascial incisions as well as in the subcutaneous layer. At the time of medicine or placebo 
administration, the operating room circulating nurse will create a log entry for Exparel 
administration i n the medication administration record (MAR). This is the section of the medical 
record where all medications must be recorded, and will be consulted prior to delivery of any other 
local anesthetic agents, which will serve to limit the additional exposures  and minimize the risk of 
toxicity.  
• Post -operative inpatient care : While admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], patients will receive medical care per 
routine, including a standardized post -operative pain control regimen. Post -operatively, all patients 
will receive a u niform pain control protocol consistent with the current standard of care. We have 
worked with our anesthesia team to create a consensus -driven protocol to ensure patients are 
H00013594  
[ADDRESS_694585] the following 
data from inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
o As a part of the research study regiment, delirium will be assessed using the Confusion 
Assessment Metho d (CAM)28, which will be administered [ADDRESS_694586] -
operative day 1, 2 and 3 between 8AM -12PM, when a provider is called to the bedside to 
evaluate the patient for confusion, and also  by [CONTACT_534912] (Q12).  
o Adverse events will be monitored and recorded during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534885]. The 
adverse events monitored a nd recorded will include: alteration of mental status, respi[INVESTIGATOR_41826], wound complications, fixation -related complications.  
o The following information will be accessed via the electronic medical record after discharge:  
▪ Total morphine equivalents post -surgery, including and excluding recovery unit 
administration of narcotics in the immediate post -operative period.  
▪ Pain Visual Analog Score (VAS) score, which is obtained Q4 by [CONTACT_75462].  
▪ Timing and participation with ph ysical therapy will be recorded looking at time until 
first therapy evaluation, and level of mobilization achieved  
▪ Length of stay, discharge disposition  
• Post -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274376] -up: Follow up after discharge will be done according to each individual surgeon’s  
practice per their standard of care. It typi[INVESTIGATOR_4755] a follow up appointment at [ADDRESS_694587] -op period, CAM score, average pain VAS, length of stay, discharge disposition, 
timing/participation with inpatient physical therapy and adverse complications, data concerning [ADDRESS_694588] corresponding to “orth otrauma 
(\\ummhcnas03)”. Upon conclusion of the study, the data will be stored in a password encrypted file that 
only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_286476].  
 
12. Data Management  
Following initial enrollment, each patient will be assigned a unique patient identifier. All electr onic 
documentation containing total morphine equivalents, visual analogue scores and all other medical 
information will be associated with this unique patient identifier during analysis. All protected health 
information will be stored in a separate, passwo rd-protected research file that will not be accessed 
regularly. Following our secondary analysis, all personal health information will be removed from our 
electronic files and destroyed in accordance with patient privacy guidelines.  
Data obtained at UMMMC during the study will be recorded and stored using Redcap software 
that will be maintained at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534886]. The University of Kentucky will be responsible 
for their own data infrastructure. Upon conclusion of the study, the University  of Kentucky will share de -
identified data (with information relating to the study endpoints) with the University of [LOCATION_005] 
H00013594  
[ADDRESS_694589] -operatively and 
any issues with medication effects, wound healing, or other  medical complications will be logged as 
adverse events. Blinding will only be broken for unexpected complications potentially related to 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_534887] (e.g. wound complications, or cardiac issues possibly attributable to 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] a dministration). The research team will meet monthly to monitor data collection and 
handling.  During this time, study staff will also review adverse events logs and pain scores.  
 
14. Withdrawal of Subjects  
We do not anticipate any situation in which a subject  would be withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_534913].  We anticipate analyzing the data via an intention to treat analysis 
and thus would include data from all subjects initially enrolled, even if they developed an intolerance o r 
medical contraindication to continuing the study.  
However, a subject may choose to withdraw from the study on their own accord, at any time, for 
any reason. Contact [CONTACT_534914] [INVESTIGATOR_173003]. If a subject 
chooses to withdraw, any and all data that was previously collected will be included in the analysis; 
however, we will cease any further data collection. All pe rsonal health information collected prior to a 
patient’s withdrawal from the study will be destroyed in accordance with patient privacy laws. In addition, 
any paper documents obtained will be destroyed in accordance with standard HIPPA guidelines. Upon 
being notified of a patient’s decision to withdraw from the study, researchers will no longer contact [CONTACT_534915], administer in -office surveys, or access their medical information online.  
15. Risks to Subjects  
Surgical risks are described to the pati ent prior to surgery and are part of standard of care 
procedures for hip fracture surgery.  There are no additional surgical risks to patients who participate in 
this study.  
The medications used post -operatively are commonly used for treatment of pain foll owing 
surgery and carry the same risks when taking these medications for postoperative  care. These represent 
H00013594  
[ADDRESS_694590].  
Although the treat ment arm in this study involves randomization to liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 
(Exparel), standard bupi[INVESTIGATOR_534888] -operatively in the treatment of hip fracture patients 
in our institution. The major risks associated with Exparel administration r elate to the administration of 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_534889] (rather than its liposomal formulation). They include allergic reaction, and potential 
cardiovascular or central nervous system toxicity. Per the FDA labeling, risks that occur with greater than 
or equa l to 10% frequency include nausea, constipation, and vomiting.  
There is also a risk of a breach of confidentiality. All research team members are appropriately 
trained and understand the importance of confidentiality.  
 
16. Potential Benefits to Subjects  
The addition of long -acting local anesthesia could potentially benefit patients by [CONTACT_534916], reduced opi[INVESTIGATOR_357193], and a resultant decrease in medical complications. 
As noted above, nerve blocks in hip fractures have been assoc iated with a 33% decrease in opi[INVESTIGATOR_15834]26, 
and regional anesthesia in ankle fractures has similarly been shown to decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_534890] 60%29. 
In arthroplasty, long -acting local anesthesia has been shown as effective as regional anesthesia for pain 
control, and is associated with decreased narcotic use and even shortened length of stay17,19-21,30,31. It is 
possible that hip fracture patients could not only realize similar benefits, but could actually see increased 
benefit in terms of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] -related complication reduction, given the increase medical frailty of this 
population6,13-16. 
 
17. Vulnerable Populations  
The osteoporotic hip fracture population is comprised almost exclusively  of geriatric patients, 
which could be considered a vulnerable population. We will formally use the mini -COG as a screening tool 
to exclude patients with baseline cognitive impairment. Additionally, patients unable to consent for 
themselves will be exclude d. As such, only cognitively intact patients will be included in the study. 
Whenever possible, we will also discuss involvement in the study with the patient’s family (provided the 
patient gives permission for us to discuss with them) to ensure that the de cision to participate in the study 
is made with appropriate consideration and that the entire family is comfortable with involvement.  
 
18. Multi -Site Research  
This study is being conducted in conjunction with the University of Kentucky, which is a busy 
academ ic (level 1) trauma center with a similar hip fracture volume to UMMMC. Funding is divided evenly 
between both centers, and both have equivalent recruitment goals. The two principal investigators, Eric 
Swart and Paul E. Matuszewski, are close colleagues wh o remain in constant communication and will 
maintain coordination to ensure that:   
• All sites have the most current version of the protocol, consent document, and HIPAA authorization.  
• All required approvals are obtained at each site (including approval by [CONTACT_779]’s IRB of record).  
• All modifications are communicated to sites and approved (including approval by [CONTACT_779]’s IRB of 
record) before the modification is implemented.  
• All engaged participating sites safeguard data as required by [CONTACT_534917] s ecurity policies.  
• All local site investigators conduct the study appropriately.  
H00013594  
2018 -03-15 
 
• All non -compliance with the study protocol or applicable requirements is reported in accordance 
with local policy.  
• All sites are informed of problems, interim results, and the study closure.

Not applicable  
 
20. Sharing of Results with Subjects  
To maintain the double -blinded nature of the study, the both researchers and subjects will not be 
aware of which treatment group a subject has been randomly assigned to. At the conclusion of the study, 
following de -identification and data analysis, results  of this data collection may be shared with patients 
who have participated in this research as it becomes available, if they request it verbally or in writing.  This 
will only occur after final data analysis, if a subject inquires.  
 
21. Setting  
Research subje cts will be identified, recruited and followed post -operatively as inpatients at the 
University Campus of UMass Memorial Medical Center (UMMMC). They will be followed post -discharge 
at the Ambulatory Care Center (ACC). Data analysis will primarily occur in  locked, private offices at in one 
of two secure research offices located at the University Campus.  
 
22. Resources Available  
UMass Memorial is the largest health system in central [LOCATION_005]. It consists of three 
separate ca mpuses, Hahnemann, Memorial, and University campus. The Orthopedics Department has 
locations on all three campuses that each provide a dedicated research space, which contain computers 
with access to password -protected research drives.  
The Principle Invest igator (PI) will be responsible for overseeing the study and ensuring 
consistency throughout the project. The orthopedic PI [INVESTIGATOR_534891]. Recruitment and consent will be performed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_534892]. Each member of the research staff has passed the CITI exam on ethical conduct of research and 
have received training and supervision regarding patient confidentiality and study protocol. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_534893] f periodically to review each role and ensure adequate training for the 
respective positions. Upon enrollment of each patient, the corresponding surgical team will be counseled 
concerning the details of the study and their role, prior to admitting the pati ent into the OR.  
The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534894] a protocol is 
in place to ensure appropriate randomization, blinding, and treatment occurs for the study -related 
portion (injection of Exparel vs. placebo at t he conclusion of the operation).  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_534895] /IRB communication as well as 
data review and assistance with follow -up patient coordination as needed. There are no anticipated 
adverse consequences asso ciated with this study, however, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_534896]. The 
research subjects will be provided with appropriate contact [CONTACT_534918].

23. Prior Approvals  
Not applicable  
 
24. Recruitment Methods  
No formal external recruitment methods will be used for this study, as hip fracture patients are 
universally admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_534897]. Patients will be identified, 
screened, and approached for enrollment in the study as noted above (see 8. Study Timeline ). After review 
and screening, the patient will be given the opportunity to ask researchers questions about the study. It 
will be reiterated to all patients during preoperative discussions that their enrollment status in n o way 
will affect their ability to get adequate post -operative pain control. There will be no financial 
compensation in return for participation in this study.  
 
25. Local Number of Subjects  
The local recruitment goal at University of [LOCATION_005] is 25 patie nts (Refer to 6. Study -
Wide Number of Subjects)  
 
26. Confidentiality  
As part of our design, researchers will have access to patients’ names and phone numbers in order 
to collect the required data. Upon enrollment, each patient will also be assigned a unique i dentifier. All 
patient personal information will be stored in a master list that links the patient’s identifying information 
to their medical record number, which will be maintained in a separate, locked file that only approved 
research personnel will have  access to. During the data collection period, researchers will not directly use 
this master list and, instead, will draw upon information from a separate that contains only the patient’s 
first name, phone number, and unique patient identifier  
 
All paper d ata collection documents are kept in locked file cabinets within locked offices that are 
accessible only to the project investigators and staff. All online databases are password protected to guard 
against unauthorized access and only approved research per sonnel will be granted access.  
 
27. Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects (HIPAA)  
All eligible subjects will identified by [CONTACT_534919].  After this point, only approved research personn el will have access to patients’ private 
health information. All research will be stored electronically on secure research drives or locked offices as 
described above.  
Only health information related to their orthopedic injury and surgery will be reviewed for the 
purposes of this study. Other unrelated personal health information will not be accessed or used in any 
way. All subjects will sign a HIPAA authorization form for use of any protected health information to be 
used for research purposes, as stated a bove.  
 
H00013594  
2018 -03-15 
 
28. Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
There will be no additional compensation for research related injury as all 
treatments/medications are approved for postoperative pain management. Patients would be treated for 
any complications of surgery including non -union or fractures that may be slow to heal using approved 
methods by [CONTACT_534920].  The patient would be responsible for 
all costs associated with this treatment.  
 
29. Economic Burden to Subjects  
Altho ugh considered standard of care and typi[INVESTIGATOR_534898], the cost of the study 
medication (Exparel) will be paid for by [CONTACT_534921]. All other treatment costs are within the standard 
of care and the expenses will be paid for by [CONTACT_534922]. There is no additional 
post -operative follow -up required for this study beyond the surgeon’s standard follow -up routine. There 
will be no financial compensation in return for participation in this study.  
 
30. Consent Process  
We wil l obtain consent in accordance with the guidelines from the HRP -802 INVESTIGATOR 
GUIDANCE: Informed Consent ( http://www.umassmed.edu/ccts/irb/investigator -guidance/ ). The 
consenting pr ocess will take place in the University Campus of UMass Memorial Medical Center 
(UMMMC) as previously described. All research personnel administering consents will be provided with 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_534899]. All subjects 
have the option to withdraw from the study at any time point by [CONTACT_59554]. 
Consent will only be obtained by [CONTACT_534923].  
Patients will be given ample time to review the contents of the consent in private. The patient will 
be approached about the study as soon as they are identified to give them adequate time to review the 
study information prior to surgery. A researcher  will then be available to answer all questions regarding 
the patient’s participation in the study, including but not limited to all risks and benefits. The patient may 
refuse to participate at any time during the consenting process or over the course of t he study.  
 
31. Process to Document Consent in Writing  
The consent will be documented in accordance with the guidelines detailed previously in the HRP -
803 INVESTIGATOR GUIDANCE: Documentation of Informed Consent. The patient will receive a copy of 
this consent  for their personal records during the enrollment process. This consent has been largely 
modeled after the Template Consent Document (HRP -502) and provides answers to many anticipated 
questions. Each signed consent will be stored in a locked cabinet in a s ecure research office that only 
approved study personnel are able to access.  
 
32. Drugs or Devices  
Exparel (liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) is FDA approved, with a labeled indication of “single -dose 
infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical  analgesia”. As such, this study represents on -label 
use of the medication. Use of Exparel post -operatively in this patient population does not involve a novel 
route or dosage, and is not being used in a patient population that would increase the risks. Ex parel is 
H00013594  
2018 -03-15 
 
routinely used during arthroplasty surgery at our healthcare system Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_35905] a population 
with a similar (although not identical) age profile and medical comorbidity profile. Additionally, this 
medication was routinely used at other in stitutions that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_534900].  
We will maintain coordination with the research pharmacy to store, handle and administer the 
drug, in accordance with the study proc edure. The IDS will be responsible for drug preparation and 
accountability. Refer to 8. Study Timelines  for details on the study procedure. Placebo will consist of 
normal saline. Exparel is not a clear/transparent solution, so per discussion with the IDS, blinding will be 
performed by [CONTACT_534924].  
Devices used for fixation of the hip fracture are determined by [CONTACT_534925], and are independent of involvement in this study.

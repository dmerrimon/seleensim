Enhancing Community Capacity to Improve 
Cancer Care Delivery: The Effect of a Lay Health 
Worker Intervention on Patient-reported 
Symptoms, Healthcare Use, Total Costs of Care, 
and End-of- life Care Delivery  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
November 16, 2016 
 
 
1. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  
a. Brief Summary 
Undertreated patient symptoms and resulting acute care use require approaches that improve symptom -burden. Previously a a lay health worker (LHW) -led symptom screening 
intervention was developed for patients with advanced cancer. This intervention will be expanded to all patients with cancer and the LHW will be trained to  refer patients to 
palliative care and behavioral health.  
 
b. Objectives  
This intervention will evaluate the effect on symptom -burden, survival, healthcare use, and 
total costs.  
 
2. STUDY ENDPOINT (S) 
The primary outcome s are change in symptoms using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment 
Scale (ESAS) and Personal Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ -9). Secondary outcomes include 
incidence of Emergency Depart ment visits, incidence of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], number of 
participants with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_749577], total health care costs, and number of participants with 
acute care facility death.

the intervention. Outcomes will be  compared outcomes to patients in the year prior (control 
arm)

Lay Health Worker Expanded Intervention  
Identifying Patients 
vAll patients with newly diagnosed cancer, e xcept non- melanoma skin cancer, non- metastatic thyroid
cancer , and prostate cancer not requiring Medical Oncology  will be included in the lay health worker
program
1)Patients will be categorized as either "Active" or "Inactive" based on the following criteria:
1)Active: All metastatic cancer patients and any non metastatic cancer patient on active
chemotherapy
2)Inactive: Patients who are not on chemoth erapy and are undergoing routine follow -up/surveillance
3)Three months after a non- metastatic patient has completed adjuvant chemotherapy, he/she will be
transitioned from an "active" to "inactive " status  unless trigger event occurs
Patient Engagement  
ØLAY HEALTH WORKER  will contact [CONTACT_749591]
ØLAY HEALTH WORKER  will schedule an initial oncology consultation appointment with the patient
within [ADDRESS_1024936]
ØLAY HEALTH WORKER  will i nvite and encourage the patient to include anyone in the conversation
such as family/caregiver and encourage the patient to include anyone who may potentially be
attending future oncology appointments with the patient.
ØIf necessary, the LAY HEALTH WORKER  will offer to reschedule the call to accommodate
patient’s request  for others to be present during conversation.
§LAY HEALTH WORKER  will provide contact [CONTACT_749592] a list of all the appropriate triggers to the patient and the care circle .
oTriggers  Include:
ØDisease progression
ØUnexpected news regarding treatment effectiveness/side effects
ØPotential change of treatment
ØED visit for cancer or cancer symptom control
ØIf for any reason patient does not feel comfortable with current goals ofcare plan

Ø The health worker is here to support the patient throughout this process of receiving 
education and making decisions  
Ø Provide educational materials regarding symptom assessment and referral services.  
Offer the patient the option to review educational material in their home (confirm home 
address).   
 
v Identify symptom control resources, which the oncologist may later prescribe as appropriate 
(including palliative care resources). 
Ø Note:  Here is a good place to address palliative care and begin the intake/ESAS. In 
addition, connect the patient with individual and group -based opportunities (support 
groups at the Cancer Institute) for emotional support involving interaction with trained 
professionals and other people undergoing similar health challenges  
 
v Invite and encourage the patient to include anyone in the conversation such as 
family/caregiver and encourage the patient to include anyone who may potentially be attending future oncology appointments with the patient.  Ask patient “are there any members of your family that you think will be part of your care?’  
§  Note : If necessary, offer to reschedule the call to accommodate patient’s request.  
v Provide ESAS (**Please see referral to symptom call center algorithms and Palliative Medicine)   
Ø Note:   The ESAS will be measured at routine intervals throughout the patient’s journey 
in the symptom control call center as well  based on the risk stratification categories 
listed above .   
Ø During the phone conversation use validated techniques using the PHQ9 to screen 
patients for need of psycho/social supportive services and refer to palliative care or 
psychosocial services.   
 
Educational Materials  
v All cancer patients will be educated on the general topi[INVESTIGATOR_749578], radiation, and surgical 
approaches to treating cancer.   
Ø LAY HEALTH WORKER  will discuss available handouts and reading materials with patients during the 
initial phone conversation  
Ø Front office staff will provid e patients with handouts for their specific diagnosis, 
chemotherapy and symptom management (constipation, diarr hea, nausea, etc.) upon 
check out

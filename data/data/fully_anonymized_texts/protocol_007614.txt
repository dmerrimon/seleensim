1. SYNOPSIS  
 
Title of Study: Phase II trial of individualized lung tumor stereotactic ablative 
radiotherapy (SABR)  
Study Phase:  II 
Study Center(s):  Stanford University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_490751]:   
Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has emerged as an important and effect ive new 
treatment modality for lung tumors, but optimal dose regimens have not been fully 
established. Significant toxicity can be observed  with the most commonly used dose 
regimens, implying that developi[INVESTIGATOR_490752]- specific factors could be of clinical benefit.  
Primary Objective(s):   
a. Evaluate local tumor control with individually optimized lung tumor 
SABR. Tumor control will be assessed by [CONTACT_4654], PET-CT, and if 
appropriate, biopsy.  The trial will focus on three cohorts: 1) patients with 
limited primary NSCLCs  (T1aN0M0, T1bN0M0, T2aN0M0, T2bN0M0, 
or T3N0M0) non- small cell lu ng cancer ; 2) patients with a history of 
NSCLC  who have new limited primary NSCLC lesion(s); and 3) patients 
with more advanced lung cancer or lung metastases from a variety of 
different cancers.  
Secondary Objective(s):   
b. Evaluate the toxicity of individually optimized lung tumor SABR. 
Pulmonary, esophageal, chest wall, skin, vascular, cardiac/pericardial, and 
neurologic (brachial plexus/ recurrent laryngeal/myelitis) toxicity  will be 
scored by [CONTACT_12397] 4.0 criteria.  
c. Evaluate the feasibility of anatomically optimized audio -visual 
biofeedback (AVB) -coached breath -hold technique assisted by [CONTACT_490764][INVESTIGATOR_490753] ( FFF) in a 
subset of patients. Feasibility will be assessed based on:  
i. The proportion of patients able to reproduce an anatomically-
optimized breath -hold with AVB -coaching during treatment. 
ii. The reduction in treatment delivery time compared to gated free -
breathing treatment.  
d. Determine progression free, metastasis free , and overall survival in 
patients treated with individually optimized lung tumor SABR.  
e. Examine new biomarkers in lung tumor SABR patients. 
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the therapeutic ratio  of lung tumor SABR can be 
increased by (i) individual dosing based on tumor volume, and (ii) technologies to 
optimize the treatment anatomy by [CONTACT_490765] a nd 
critical normal organs at the time of treatment delivery.   
Study Design:   
 8 We hypothesize that therapeutic ratio can be increased by:  
i. Individualized dosing based on tumor volume. Our retrospective 
institutional data indicate that single fraction SABR is effective 
and safe for small volume pulmonary tumors but more intensive 
regimens are required to control larger tumors.  
ii. Technologies to optimize the treatment anatomy by [CONTACT_490766]. We will incorporate anatomically 
optimized AVB- coached breath -hold technique during image-
guided gated Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_490754] a subset of patients , and 
evaluate its dosimetric impact compared to gated treatment during 
normal free -breathing. 
We propose a prospective clinical trial to confirm the improved 
therapeutic ratio of individually optimized lung tumor SABR. 
Primary and Secondary Endpoint(s):  
 Primary Endpoint 
a. Local tumor control of individu ally optimized lung tumor SABR.  This will 
be evaluated separately in  the three different patient groups . 
 
Secondary Endpoint 
b. Toxicity of individually optimized lung tumor SABR. 
c. Feasibility of anatomically optimized AVB -coached breath -hold technique 
assisted by [CONTACT_490767][INVESTIGATOR_490755] a subset of 
patients . Feasibility will be based on the proportion of patients able to 
reproduce an anatomically- optimized breath -hold with AVB-coaching 
during treatment and the reduction in treatment delivery time compared to 
gated free -breathing treatment.   
d. Progression free, m etastasis free , and overall survival in patients treated 
with individually optimized lung tumor SABR.  
e. Correlate plasma biomarkers with outcomes of lung tumor SABR patients 
(optional).  
Number of Patients:  The target accrual is 246 patients over 4 years  (about 260 patients 
will be enrolled in the OnCore database due to study dropouts. NOTE: In a collaborative 
effort, some patients will be accrued at Shantou, CUHK, and Hokkaido Universitie s in 
China and Japan. We expect no more than [ADDRESS_630957] Eligibility Criteria:

Study Procedures:  
 
i. Simulation: For a subset of patients, [ADDRESS_630959] separation between the target(s) and the specified organs 
at risk will be chosen for planning. Plan comparison w ith the

individually optimized lung tumor SABR.  
 
 
5. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
5.1 Study Disease: Lung Cancer  
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, accounting for over  1.[ADDRESS_630961] often diagnosed at advanced stages [1]. 
Howev er, early stage non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is often surgically curable with the 
appropriate resection, preferably lobectomy [2]. Unfortunately, a significant f raction of patients 
with early stage NSCLC cannot tolerate surgery owing to medic al comorbidities. Similarly, 
while patients with pulmonary oligometastasis from malignancies at other sites may b enefit 
from surgical resection [3], many have medical or technical contraindications to pulmonary 
resection [4]. 
 
5.2 Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for Lung Cancer  
In such patients, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), also called ster eotactic body 
radiation therapy ( SBRT), has recently emerged as an important treatment option [5, 6] .  A 
landmark prospective phase II clinical trial conducted by [CONTACT_490768], RTOG 0236, found that SABR resulted in outstanding local control (LC) and overall 
survival (OS) rates of 98% and 56% at 3 years in a cohort of strictly medically inopera ble 
patients with peripherally located stage I NSCLC [7]. While treatment was well tolerated 
overall there was nevertheless a moderate incidence of significant (grade 3 -4) toxicities. A 
prospective multi -institutional phase I/II trial of SABR for patients with 1 -3 pulmonary 
metastases demonstrated similarly excellent 2 -year LC of 96% [8]. 
Analyses of the dose-response relationships in SABR for both primary and metastati c lung 
tumors have demonstrated the importance of dose intensity [9-11], identifying a biolo gically 
effective dose (BED) of ≥[ADDRESS_630962] not been stratified by [CONTACT_490769]. An earlier report  from our 
institution of the initial results of a phase I dose escalation study using sing le fraction SABR 
for primary and metastatic lung tumor  demonstrated 1 year LC of 91% using doses of >20 Gy 
[12]. A subsequent expanded analysis revealed that the critical factor for LC wa s tumor 
volume, such that in the dose range of 15-30 Gy in a single fraction, 11 month LC was 93-
100% for tumors up to 12 mL but only 47% for tumors >12 mL [13]. Based on these 
observations we adopted a volume-adapted dosing strategy for lung tumor SABR in whic h 
patients with small tumors (<12 mL) were treated with single fraction regimens with BED  
<100 Gy while larger tumors (≥12 mL) were treated with more dose -intensive multi -fraction 
 
13 of 46 regimens with BED ≥[ADDRESS_630963] recently retrospectively analyzed lung tumor patients treated with the vo lume -adapted 
strategy. Median follow -up in this study was 13.5 months. LC at 12 months for smaller tumors 
treated with lower dose, single fraction regimens was 91.4% and for larger tumors treated with 
multi -fraction, higher dose regimens 92.5% (p=0.24). For primary lung tumors only (excluding 
metastases), LC was 92.6% and 91.7%, respectively (p=0.58). RC, freedom from DM and O S 
did not differ significantly between the groups. Rates of radiation pneumonitis, chest  wall 
toxicity, and esophagitis were low in both groups, but all grade 3 toxicities developed in Gr oup 
2 (p=0.02). 
Based on this experience, we propose a prospective phase [ADDRESS_630964] cohort (1A) will 
consist of patients with Stage I non -small cell lung cancer. The second cohort (1B) will consist 
of patients with multiple primary non -small cell lung cancer. The third cohort (II) will consist 
of patients with lung metastases from a variety of different cancers.  
 
5.3 Audio -visual Biofeedback   
In addition, unique technological features of the Varian TrueBeam STX system for S ABR, 
particularly the very rapid treatments afforded by [CONTACT_490770][INVESTIGATOR_490757] 
(FFF) mode, make possible novel treatment approaches. While margins can be reduc ed by [CONTACT_490771][INVESTIGATOR_125344], the long treatment delivery times using conventional dose r ates and 
field arrangements necessitate treating during natural free breathing. However, f ast treatments  
could in theory be completed in a small number of breath holds, which would then not be 
restricted to the natural breathing range but could be at extremes of tidal volume. It wo uld then 
be possible to select a degree of breath hold that is anatomically -optimized, creating the 
greatest separation between the target and critical organs at risk. Of note, at 1400 MU/min in 
6X FFF mode, a 25 Gy fraction could be delivered in less than 3.5 minutes of beam-on time, or 
~[ADDRESS_630965] of the 
anatomically -optimized approach compared to conventional free -breathing treatment gated at 
natural end- exhale.  
 
5.4 Rationale for Study  
 
 
14 of 46 Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has emerged as an important and effect ive new 
treatment modality for lung tumors, but currently many different dose regimens are used and 
optimal regimens remain to  be established. Significant toxicity can occur  with the most 
effective published regimens, indicating that the therapeutic ratio could  be further improved. 
 
We hypothesize that therapeutic ratio can be increased by:  
 
i. Individualized dosing based on tumor volume. Our institutional data indicate that 
single fraction SABR is effective and safe for small volume pulmonary tumors but 
more intensive regimens are required to control larger tumors.  
ii. Technologies to optimize the treatment anatomy by [CONTACT_490772]. We w ill 
incorporate anatomically optimized AVB -coached breath -hold technique during 
image -guided gated Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_490758], and evaluate its dosimetric impact 
compared to gated treatment during normal free -breathing. 
 
We propose a prospective clinical trial to confirm the improved therapeutic ratio  of 
individually optimized lung tumor SABR.  At our institution about [ADDRESS_630966] been 
investigated in patients with lung tumors, including protein, DNA, and miRNA biomarkers. 
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a particularly intriguing biomarker in this patient population [14].  
Tumors continually release DNA into the circulation through incompletely understood 
mechanisms that appear to involve both apoptosis and necrosis [15].  Previous studies ha ve 
indicated that NSCLC patients have statistically significantly higher levels o f cfDNA in the 
circulation than unaffected controls [16]. Furthermore, cfDNA levels have been shown to 
decrease after effective treatment in a variety of tumors, indicating that they can be used to 
assess dynamics of treatment response [15]. 
 
We plan to measure plasma levels of cfDNA in patients prior to initiating treatment an d at each 
follow -up visit. We hypothesize that changes in cfDNA concentration will be predictive  of 
outcome in this group of patients. 
 
Additional biomarkers may also be assessed.  
 
 
 
 
15 of 46 6. PARTICIPANT SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT PROCEDURES  
 
6.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 
- Limited primary NSCLCs  (T1aN0M0, T1bN0M0, T2aN0M0, T2bN0M0, or T3N0M0) 
or metastatic lung tumors with no evidence of uncont rolled extrathoracic metastases . 
- Up to [ADDRESS_630967] a sum of 
orthogonal diameters greater than 15 cm. 
- Both peripheral and central tumors are accepted for this trial.  
- Age >  = 18 years old  
- Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this 
trial. 
- Note: Patients may be enrolled more than once (eg, for a new tumor) 
 
6.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 
- Evidence of uncontrolled extrathoracic metastases  
- Contraindication to receiving radiotherapy 
- Age < 18 years old. Children are excluded because  lung malignancies rarely occur in this 
age group.  Furthermore, treatment requires a great deal of patient cooperation i ncluding 
the ability to lie still for several hours in an isolated room.  
- Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded; as well as women of child -bearing 
potential who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of birth control 
(hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) to avoid pregnancy for the 
duration of the study.  Male subjects must also agree to use effective contraception fo r the 
same period as above.  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant 
while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immedi ately. 
- Prior radiation therapy is allowed but there should not be overlap with the prior high dose 
regions unless approved by [CONTACT_490773].

7. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
7.1 Study Design/Schedule  
 
• This is a prospective phase II study.  
• Patients with primary lung cancer or metastasis to the lung with no evidence of 
uncontrolled extrathoracic metastasis will be enrolled on this study.  
 
16 of 46  
7.2 Procedures: SABR Administration and Radiation Treatment Planning  
 
7.2.1 Pre-SABR Tests, Procedures , and Planning 
 
The following will be completed prior to S ABR : 
 
a)   Medical history and clinical examination.  
b) CBC  (optional).  Additionally, up to [ADDRESS_630969]. 
Diehn’s laboratory; blood may also be collected at post -treatment follow -up visits.  
At most, the lesser of 50 ml or 3 ml per kg will be collected for research purposes in 
an 8 week period. For specific information regarding collection and processing, see 
Section 8 Correlative Studies .   
c) Pathologic confirmation of malignancy whenever possible .  (This will generally be 
accomplished using CT-guided or bronchoscopic biopsies .)  If consent is provided by 
[CONTACT_102], tumor tissu e for research may be obtained. If pathologic confirmation is 
not possible, a target lesion must be a n on-calcified pulmonary nodule or lymph node 
that is present on at least 3 imaging studies (can include simulation scan). The nodul e 
must have increased in size or proportion of solid component on CT and/or show 
increased  FDG uptake on PET over at least 2 imaging studies. 
d)   FDG -PET/CT and thoracic CT scan with contrast (recommended).  
e)   Signed informed consent document.  
f) Permission from patient for future postmortem examination (optional).  
 
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_630970]. The fiducials will be used as surrogates for targeting the daily tumor position 
during treatment.  The fiducials will be placed directly into the tumor and/or perip hery 
under CT guidance.  Fiducials may be implanted prior to enrollment as this is an  acceptable 
standard of care procedure for any patient receiving SABR for lung tumors . 
 
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_630971] (4- D CT) and PET -CT will be acquired in the 
treatment position.  
 
 
7.2.4 Treatment planning  
 
The treating physicians will contour the gross tumor volume (GTV) on axial CT sl ices 
using lung windows for visualizing tumor/lung interfaces and mediastinal windows f or 
tumor/soft tissue interfaces, with the aid of fused PET. No explicit expansio n for 
 
17 of 46 microscopic extension will be added to form the clinical target volume (CTV), i.e.,  
CTV=GTV. Breathing -induced tumor motion will be assessed using the 4-D CT data and 
managed by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_125344], dynamic tumor tracking, or motion -inclusive technique, and 
the internal target volume (ITV) will be designed accordingly. A 0.5 cm setup margin  will 
be added to the ITV to form the final planning target volume (PTV).  
 
Treatment will be delivered using any suitable linear accelerator with 
image -guidance capabilities.  Dose calculations should be heterogeneity 
corrected using an accurate algorithm (pencil beam not acceptable).  
7.2.5  SABR  Treatment Delivery:  
Presciption doses for p eripheral tumors  (except colorectal cancer metastases) : 
Peripheral tumors are tumors that do not meet the definition for central tumors described  
below.  Volume- adapted dose prescriptions for peripheral tumors will be as follows:  
 
Tumor volume Peripheral dose 
(covering 95% of 
PTV)  Maximum dose 
(centered in GTV) 
of at least : 
<=10  25 Gy / 1 fraction 30 Gy /1 fraction 
>10 and <=30 50 Gy / 4 fractions 60 Gy / 4 fractions 
>30 54 Gy / 3 fractions 64.8 Gy / 3 fractions 
 
Prescription doses for peripheral colorectal cancer metastases : 
Retrospective analyses of our own data as well as published results from othe r institutions 
indicated that colorectal cancers appear to be relatively radioresistant. Particula rly, we 
noted high rates of local failure in colorectal cancer metastases to the lung  in tumor that 
received 25 Gy in one fraction. Therefore, volume- adapted dose prescriptions for 
peripheral colorectal cancer tumors will be as follows:  
 
Tumor volume Peripheral dose 
(covering 95% of 
PTV)  Maximum dose 
(centered in GTV) 
of at least : 
<=10  50 Gy / 4 fraction  60 Gy /4 fraction  
>10 and <=30 50 Gy / 4 fractions 60 Gy / 4 fractions 
>30 54 Gy / 3 fractions 64.8 Gy / 3 fractions 
 
Central tumors : 
Central tumors are defined as having their GTV within or touching the zone of the 
proximal bronchial tree  or near critical central structures. The zone of the proximal 
bronchial tree is defined as a volume 2 cm in all directions around the proximal bronchial 
tree (carina, right and left main bronchi,  right and left upper lobe bronchi, intermedius 
bronchus, right middle lobe bronchus, lingular bronchus right and left lower lobe bronchi). 
[See figure below] For the purposes of this protocol central tumors inc lude those within 2 
 
18 of 46 cm of the zone of the proximal bronchial tree . Alternatively, tumors whose PTV overlaps 
major vessels  (aorta or superior vena cava) , esophagus, heart, trachea, pericardium, or 
brachial plexus will also be considered central . 
 
Prescription doses  for central tumors (except colorectal cancer metastases) : 
Volume- adapted dose prescriptions for central tumors will be as follows:  
Tumor volume 
(mL)  Peripheral dose 
(covering 95% of 
PTV)  Maximum dose 
(centered in GTV) of 
at least: 
<=10  40 Gy / 4 fraction s 48 Gy / 4 fraction s 
>10 and <=30 50 Gy / 4 fractions 60 Gy / 4 fractions 
>30 60 Gy / 8 fractions  72 Gy / 8 fractions  
  
Prescription doses  for central colorectal cancer metastases : 
Volume- adapted dose prescriptions for central colorectal cancer tumors will be as 
follows:  
Tumor volume 
(mL)  Peripheral dose 
(covering 95% of 
PTV)  Maximum dose 
(centered in GTV) 
of at least : 
<=10  50 Gy / 4 fraction s 60 Gy / 4 fraction s 
>10 and <=30 50 Gy / 4 fractions 60 Gy / 4 fractions 
>30 60 Gy / 8 fractions  72 Gy / 8 fractions  
 
 
Prescription Dose Constraints and Conformality 
 
19 of 46 Prescription Isodose Surface Coverage : The prescription isodose surface will be  chosen 
such that 95% of the target volume (PTV) is conformally covered by [CONTACT_490774] (PTV V95%RX = 100%).  The global maximum dose point should be 
within the PTV  and ideally within the GTV.  The maximum dose within the GTV should 
be at least 120% of the prescription dose (as indicated in tables above).  The minimum dose 
to the GTV should be at least 100% of the prescription dose (specifically, no more than 
0.035 mL of the GTV should receive less than 100% of the prescription dose, with a 
tolerance of 2.5%).  
Conformality para meters: Treatment plans should be as conformal as possible.  For tumors 
located far from critical structures, a very conformal distribution should be ob tained.  For 
tumors very close to critical structures, dose distributions may be somewhat asy mmetric, 
with a sharper fall -off on the side(s) of the tumor that are closest to the critical structure(s) 
at risk. The following conformality criteria must be met:  
 
GTV volume 
(mL)  Ratio of Prescription Isodose 
Volume to the PTV Volume  Maximum Dose @ 2 cm from 
PTV (in % of dose prescribed)  
 Ideal  Required  Ideal  Required

>30 <1.2 <1.5 <72 <[ADDRESS_630972] dose constraints to critical structures based on the numbe r of 
fractions prescribed. E xceeding these dose limits by [CONTACT_726] 5% constitutes an 
unacceptable  protocol deviation. 
Single fraction treatment : 
Critical structures with absolute  volume and  absolute  point dose limits : Exceeding any 
of these limits constitutes a major protocol violation.

7.3 Duration of Follow- Up 
 
Upon completion of SABR , study follow up will include  serial  imaging (CT scans and/or 
PET/CT if possible and as deemed  necessary) , detailed medical history , physical examination 
and quality of life assessment every  3 months for 1 year (+/- 4 weeks) .  There after all patients 
are considered to  be off study treatment and will be followed for progression and survival 
outcomes collected during standard of care visits .  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_490759], 
 
25 of 46 history and physical examinations every 6 months for 2 years, then annually. Follow up 
intervals may also be more frequent as indicated clinically.  A complete blood count  (CBC) 
(optional) , tumor marker studies (optional) , history/physical, CT and/or PET/CT (optional) will 
be performed at each follow -up interval until death. PFTs (optional) with DLCO and FEV -[ADDRESS_630974]-SABR then once annually. Separate samples of blood 
may be drawn at the time of follow -up visits, studies, and/or laboratory draws and retained for 
research efforts to develop novel blood biomarkers . 
 
Patients will remain enrolled on this protocol until there is evidence that their dis ease has 
progressed either locally or distantly. Patients whose disease has progressed either locally or 
distantly and get treated for the progression during the [ADDRESS_630975].  Additionally, patie nts 
who are unable to cooperate with obtaining the protocol studies will be withdrawn.  Patie nts in 
whom usable imaging studies are not attainable or who can’t be reproducibly positioned a t the 
time of treatment will also be withdrawn.  Withdrawals will be replaced to achiev e the target 
accrual.  
 
7.5 Alternatives  
 
This study is optional, so the only alternative is to not participate in this study. 
 
7.6 Compensation 
 
Patients will not be paid. Costs of protocol studies will be paid through protocol funding, a nd 
patients will not incur additional costs due to their participation.  
 
 
8. CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 
8.1 Analysis of patient plasma for biomarker development.  
 
Collection of Specimen(s) (optional):  
 
Patients will elect whether they want to participate in this portion of the  study on the consent 
form.  
 
Blood Samples 
 
a)  Blood (EDTA preserved) for research purposes may be drawn prior to radiation treatment 
and at follow -up visits, studies, or blood draws.  For each collection, up to 5 0 ml will be drawn 
(purple/violet tubes).  
 
 
26 of 46 b)  Immediately, after collection, blood will be centrifuged at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes a t 4°C 
and plasma collected. The supernatant will be aliquoted for storage at -80°C.  The pel let 
containing (white and red blood cells) will also be stored in a separate tube at -80°C. 
 
Tumor Biopsy Tissue Samples 
 
a) Consent for obtaining tumor samples:  All patients with a presumed diagnosis of ma lignancy 
within the lung can give consent or decline consent to obtain an additional tumor tissu e for 
research purposes.  In this situation, the research biopsy should be obtained only after a  final 
diagnosis (preliminary if determined by [CONTACT_490775] y) of 
malignancy has been reached by [CONTACT_10063].  Once a preliminary/final diagnosis h as been 
obtained, fiducials can be placed into the tumor for tumor tracking.  In the event the patient 
already has a confirmed pathologic diagnosis of cancer in the lung, a repeat biopsy p rocedure 
(usually CT- guided) may be performed to obtain tissue with/or without simultaneous 
placement of fiducials.  
 
b)  Tumor sample processing:  Fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1520] (FNA) and core biopsies  (if possible) of 
tumor tissue will be immediately placed into small twist tubes that can be stored at -80°C.  
Sample tubes are immediately immersed into a canister of liquid nitrogen with forcep s/tube 
holder until completely frozen.  Samples are then transferred into a -80°C freezer for storage.  
 
c) Consent for use of left over diagnostic specimens: All patients with a presumed  diagnosis of 
malignancy within the lung can give consent or decline consent to allow left over biol ogical 
materials from diagnostic procedures (e.g. paraffin -embedded tissues, DNA, frozen tissues) to 
be used for research purposes.  
 
 
8.2 Coding of specimens for privacy protection  
 
At the time of enrollment each patient will be given a specific confidential identifica tion 
number (IDN). Specimens will be stored under the patient’s IDN. The information c an be 
shared with other investigators listed on this protocol. Study data will be main tained in 
password protected computer files (protected online database). Only research person nel will 
have access to this information.

11. DATA REPORTING/REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Institutional Review of Protocol  
 
The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant informatio n related to 
the study (e.g. advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewe d and approved by 
[CONTACT_162795] (SRC).  Any 
changes made to the protocol will be submitted as a modification and will be approved by [CONTACT_159004].  The Protocol Director will disseminate the protocol amend ment 
information to all participating investigators.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_630981] Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be the  
monitoring entity for this study. The DSMC will audit study -related activities to determine  
whether the study has been conducted in accordance with the protocol, local standard opera ting 
procedures, FDA regulations, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  In addition, the DSMC  will 
regularly review serious adverse events and protocol deviations associated with t he research to 
ensure the protection of human subjects.  Results of the DSMC audit will be commun icated to 
the IRB and the appropriate regulatory authorities at the time of continuing review,  or in an 
expedited fashion, as needed. 
 
11.2.1   Data Monitoring Plan for International Sites  
 
The data monitoring plan for the iSABR international sites  has six components:  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Local GCP and human subjects protection training  
 
The coordinators at each site will undergo training in Good Clinical Practice a nd human 
subjects protection and will email their completion certificates to the Stanford coo rdinator.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Local delegation logs 
 
 
[ADDRESS_630982] coordinator .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Initial OnCore and Redcap training session via BlueJeans  
 
The Stanford coordinator will create a BlueJeans training session on how to regis ter 
patients in OnCore and fill out case report forms (CRFs) in Redcap. The BlueJea ns training 
session will be held before each site starts enrolling patients on the study. All si tes will fill 
out the forms in English. Important:  When the local coordinator is working in OnCore or 
Redcap, he or she will only be able to see local data, not Stanford data or data from th e 
other international sites.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Regular training on protocol amendments  
 
Any time an amendment is made to the iSABR protocol, the Stanford coordinator will 
communicate the change to all sites via email or a BlueJeans session if needed. The sites 
will then have the amended protocol approved by [CONTACT_1036]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Remote monitoring during the study  
 
As described earlier in this document, all data recording and storage will be  in English. 
However, at Shantou medical documentation is in Chinese and at Hokkaido it is in 
Japanese. At CUHK, some medical documentation may be in English. Coordinators at al l 
three sites will attach source documents in Redcap so that the Stanford coordinato r can 
monitor and verify that patients have been screened correctly for eligibility and  that the 
data is correct and complete. At Shantou and CUHK, the source documents will be 
translated into English first before they are sent to Stanford. The cost of the 
translations will be absorbed by [CONTACT_490777] (SOW). Conversely, Hokkaido will send us their source documents fir st and 
they will be translated by [CONTACT_490778][INVESTIGATOR_307]. We will b ill 
Hokkaido for the actual cost of the translations. Interpreter Services has given th e 
Stanford coordinator a rough quote: 40 pages of Japanese source documentation wil l 
be translated for $1500, and 80 pages of Chinese source documentation will be 
translated for $3800.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SAE Reporting  
 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported by [CONTACT_490779] (a ) the local 
IRBs and (b) the Stanford coordinator. The Stanford coordinator will provide the 
international sites with SAE reporting paperwork. Once SAE paperwork has bee n delivered 
 
[ADDRESS_630983] coordinator will submit it to the Cancer Clinical Trials Office  
(CCTO) to be recorded in OnCore.  
 
11.3 Data Management Plan 
 
The Protocol Director, or his/her designee, will prepare and maintain adequ ate and accurate 
participant case histories with observations and data pertinent to the study.  St udy specific Case 
Report Forms (CRFs) will document treatment outcomes for data analysis.   Case rep ort forms 
will be developed using paper documents . CRFs will be kept in a locked cabinet , only 
accessible to the research team.  
 
11.3.[ADDRESS_630984] is managed via three components: 
 
a. OnCore  
Patients are registered and reported to the NCI through OnCore, a web-based 
database application. Patients are registered in OnCore within 5 days after sig ning 
the consent form. Patients are numbered consecutively.  
 
b. Redcap  
Case report forms (CRFs) are filled and stored electronically in Redcap, a web -
based database application. Patients are numbered consecutively using the same 
numbers as in OnCore. The CRFs include a Baseline Evaluation Form, 
Registration Form, Treatment Summary Form, and Follow -Up Form. One 
Follow- Up Form is filled out for each patient follow -up visit, so several Follow-
Up Forms are filled out for each patient over the course of the study. The Follow-
Up Form records local, regional, and distant control provided by [CONTACT_490780]. It also records any adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_102]. Common 
adverse events such as esophagitis and pneumonitis are recorded using radio 
buttons. Other adverse events can be typed into a Comments box.   
 
c. Document binders  
Key documents are stored as hardcopy in patient binders. Key documents include: 
A. The signed informed consent form 
B. The eligibility checklist and source documents required to prove eligibility 
(history and physical, pathology, and CT or PET/CT scan) as well as 
documentation of optional tests used as baseline measures (pulmonary 
function tests, complete blood count)  
C. The Treatment Summary written by [CONTACT_1963]  
D. Follow-up visit notes written by [CONTACT_1963] 
E. Documentation of any serious adverse events (SAEs)  
 
 
[ADDRESS_630985], the 
Treatment Summary Form captures key information from the physician’s 
Treatment Summary, and the Follow -Up Forms capture key information from the 
follow -up visit notes.  
 
11.3.[ADDRESS_630986] PI [INVESTIGATOR_490761] (no email account included) so they can use OnCore and Redcap. In 
order to access OnCore using their SUNet ID, the coordinators will also need to se t up (1) 
Virtual Private Network (VPN) access and (2) dual -step authentication. The instructions 
for setting these up are in a separate document.  
 
11.3.3  Overview of Data Management for the International Sites  
 
When the iSABR study expands to the three international sites (Shantou, CUHK, and 
Hokkaido), the same three components of data management will be used as described 
above.  
 
a. OnCore  
The NCI requires multi -site patients to be reported in OnCore: even though they 
are not Stanford patients, they are involved in Stanford’s research activities . The 
Stanford clinical research coordinator (CRC) will provide training in OnCore to 
the research teams as described in the data monitoring plan, above . Patients will 
be registered in OnCore at the international sites within [ADDRESS_630987]. The numbering scheme will be as follows 
for the three sites:  
 
• SHAN -001, SHAN -002, SHAN -003…. for Shantou University patients 
• CUHK -001, CUHK-002, CUHK-003…. for Chinese University at Hong 
Kong patients 
• HOKK -001, HOKK-002, HOKK-003…. for Hokkaido University patients 
 
b. Redcap  
Redcap has a Data Access Groups (DAGs) feature that allows separate teams to 
share a database without viewing each other’s data. The Stanford coordinator will 
provide training in Redcap to the PIs and coordinators as described in the data 
monitoring plan, above . The numbering scheme will be the same as in OnCore:  
 
• SHAN -001, SHAN -002, SHAN -003…. for Shantou University patients 
• CUHK -001, CUHK-002, CUHK-003…. for Chinese University at Hong 
Kong patients 
 
32 of 46 • HOKK -001, HOKK-002, HOKK-003…. for Hokkaido University patients 
 
Note that in Redcap it will be necessary to manually enter the international ID in 
the “International ID” field at the top of the Baseline Evaluation Form. The ID 
number that is auto -generated by [CONTACT_490781].  
 
NOTE: Coordinators at the international sites will upload source documents 
into Redcap so that these documents can be translated at Stanford to monitor 
whether information has been recorded correctly in the Redcap database. 
See “Remote monitoring during the study,” above.  
 
c. Document binders  
Document binders will be kept at the international sites for international patients  
enrolled on the iSABR study. Whenever a new patient is enrolled at a subsite, a 
document binder will be created for that patient just as it is at Stanford. Th e 
Stanford coordinator will instruct the international research teams on how to 
create a patient binder.  
 
 
11.4 Evaluation for Adverse Events 
 
Toxicity will be scored according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0 (Appendix II).  
 
Serious adverse events (SAE’s) will be reported to the Stanford PI [INVESTIGATOR_171238], and  DSMC as per the 
Cancer Clinical Trials Office Standard Operating Procedure for SAE reporting.  All SAEs will be 
reported while on study and will be monitored for up to one year after the last dose of the study 
treatment is given.   
 
Definition of adverse event:   any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease 
temporally  associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure regardless of whether it  
is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure (attribution of un related, unlikely, 
possible, probable, or definite).   
 
Definition of serious adverse event:   any adverse experience that results in any of the following 
outcome: death, a life- threatening experience, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4967], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity , or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life  
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse eve nt when, based 
upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Definition of unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others (UPs):    events 
(including internal or external events, death, life -threatening experiences, injuries, breaches of 
 
33 of 46 confidentiality, or other problems) that occur any time during or after the research s tudy, which 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_138669]:  
 
1. Unexpected - not in the consent form, protocol, package insert, or label; or 
unexpected in its frequency, severity, or specificity, AND  
2. Related to the research procedures – caused by, or probably caused by [CONTACT_138684], or, if a device is involved, probably caused by, or associated with the device, 
AND  
3. Harmful – caused harm to participants or others, or placed them at increased risk of 
harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm).  
 
 
Definition of reportable information:   
 
1. New information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of th e 
research, in terms of severity or frequency.  
2. Complaints that are unresolved by [CONTACT_5051], or that indicates incr eased or 
unexpected risks.  
3. Unanticipated adverse device effect.  New information about the effect on hea lth or 
safety.  
 
 
   Adverse events:  
 
Pulmonary, esophageal, chest wall, skin, vascular, cardiac/pericardial, and b rachial 
plexus/neurologic toxicity will be scored by [CONTACT_12397] 4.0 criteria. 
 
The following grade 3 or higher adverse events will be reported to the protocol dire ctor. 
These will be reported as definitely, probably, or possibly related to treatment:  
 
• Grade 3 -5 Cardiac Disorders  
- Pericardial effusion  
- Pericarditis  
- Restrictive cardiomyopathy  
 
• Grade 4 -5 Gastrointestinal Disorders  
- Dysphagia

12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS: TYPE AND NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTAL   
SUBJECTS  
 
 
35 of 46 12.1 Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
 
Primary Endpoints:  
Local tumor control of individually optimized lung  
  tumor SABR.  
 
 Secondary Endpoints:  
Toxicity of individually optimized lung tumor SABR  
12.1.[ADDRESS_630989] delivery using gated Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_490755] a subset of patients. Feasibility  will be 
assessed based on:  
(1) The proportion of patients able to reproduce an anatomically-
optimized breath -hold with AVB -coaching during treatment. 
(2) The reduction in treatment delivery time compared to gated free -
breathing treatment.  
12.1.[ADDRESS_630990] to accrue per month with primary lung cancer or can cer 
metastatic to lung.  
 
Accrual will occur over 48 months, at the rate of approximately 5-6 per month.  
 
12.2.2  Sample Size Justification  
 
This protocol targets three cohorts of patients: 1) patients with an initial diagnosis o f 
limited primary NSCLCs (T1aN0M0, T1bN0M0, T2aN0M0, T2bN0M0, or T3N0M0) 
(i.e. no prior history of non- small cell lung cancer); 2) patients with a prior history of 
non-small cell lung  cancer who have new limited primary NSCLC lesion (s); and 3) 
patients with more advanced lung cancer or lung metastases from a variety of diffe rent 
cancers. The three cohorts will be analyzed separately. A sample of size [ADDRESS_630991] 80% power to reject a rate of local control of 80%, if 
the true rate is 90%.   Once cohorts [ADDRESS_630992] a large r 
margin of error.   Approximately 86 subjects in cohorts 1 and 3 will be enrolled to allow 
for a 5% drop -out rate.   Cohort 2 has been slower to accrue and we wish to conclude this 
phase of the study without waiting for full enrollment.  
 
Specifically, proportions estimated on the basis of 82 subjects in each of cohorts 1 a nd 3 
carry a margin of error (90% confidence interval) of 10 percentage points. If we obs erve 
a rate of local control of 90%, we will be able to exclude, with 95% confidence, a true 
 
36 of 46 rate less than 82%. Likewise, if the observed rate of grade 2+ toxicity is 30% , we will be 
able to exclude, with 95% confidence, a true rate of 39%; if we observe a rate of 15 % 
grade 3+ toxicity (12/82), we will be able to exclude, with 95% confidence, a true rate of 
23%.  Precision for c ohort [ADDRESS_630993] no more than 1 0 patients to be enrolled at 
each of these sites. Accrual at these sites will not increase the total number of pati ents 
enrolled and will not change the statistical analysis.  
 
 
 
 
12.3 Analysis populations  
 
Analysis will be carried out in all patients who complete protocol  procedures. 
 
 
12.4  Plan of Analysis 
 
Local control at 12 months will be estimated along with a one-sided lower 95% confid ence 
bound to allow an informal assessment of the null hypothesis that the proportion is lar ger than 
80%.  Patients with distant progression before local failure will be censored one  day after the 
last imaging study; patients who die before local control will be censored at the  time of death.  
These definitions are used for comparability.  Cumulative incidence estimates fo r local failure 
and other failure type will also be presented. 
 
Time to event data (local control, PFS, time to progression) will be evaluated us ing Kaplan -
Meier estimates with 95% confidence intervals at multiples of 12 months base d on 
Greenwood’s formula with a log transform.  Confidence intervals for median times to event, if 
relevant, will be constructed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.  
 
Biomarkers (e.g. cfDNA) will be summarized using medians and interquartile ranges; c hanges 
in biomarkers will be assessed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.  Correlation o f biomarkers 
with local control and progression will be evaluated informally using a Wilcoxon r ank sum test 
on patients with and without the event of interest. If feasible, these analyses w ill be 
supplemented by [CONTACT_490782]. 
 
Proportions (e.g. proportion of patients with grade 4 or higher toxicity) will be estimat ed along 
with 95% exact confidence intervals.  Patient clinical and demographic character istics will be 
reported with the appropriate summary statistic (mean, range, proportion etc.). Adve rse events 
will be tabulated by [CONTACT_51753].

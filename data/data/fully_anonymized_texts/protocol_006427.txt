I. Introduction 
 
This study, Toxicant Exposure and Harm Perceptions in Cigarette Smokers Who 
Use or Do Not Use E - Cigarettes is funded by [CONTACT_124346].gov.   
 
Document Purpose  
 
This document is intended to detail all relevant study protocols and procedures . Given 
rapid advancement in the understanding of the effects of smokers switching to electronic cigarettes, particularly on toxicant exposure (our primary outcome), we considered how to maximize the sci entific contribution of the project. The body of work 
on the use of electronic cigarettes for risk reduction has been conducted with the general population and is now moving into vulnerable populations who carry a substantial disease burden from smoking. T he investigative team is uniquely positioned 
to create progress in the field by [CONTACT_124347]. A commitment was made at the San Diego site to enroll L atinx smokers and to offer the study in 
Spanish in order to address the research questions with an under -studied population. 
NIH prior approval and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was granted to add the University of Kansas Medical Center as a st udy site to enroll African American 
smokers. This change enhances the ethnic diversity of enrolled participants as well as expands the science on risk reduction. The second study site (University of Kansas 
Medical Center) agreed to rely on the IRB of the primary institution (CSUSM).  
 
Additionally, because this project was funded on the first round, reviewer comments were addressed in the implementation of the study protocol post -proposal. These changes 
impacted inclusion/exclusion criteria and the length of  the intervention period. There were 
no changes to aims, hypotheses, or sample size.  
 The following Project Summary reflects our implemented protocol and contains an 
updated premise reflecting the ethnic minority population focus.  
  Project Summary  
This pr oposal addresses a critical gap in the research regarding the use of electronic 
cigarettes (ECs) for harm reduction by [CONTACT_124348]. Smokers cite reducing 
perceived harm from smoking as a leading reason for using ECs, and ECs have been suggested by [CONTACT_124349] a potential harm reduction vehicle for smokers who 
cannot or will not achieve smoking cessation. The National Academies of Science concluded that ECs pose significantly less exposure to toxicants and less short -term 
health risks than combustible cigarettes. However, smokers with less education and from ethnic minority backgrounds are less likely to switch to exclusive EC use. Socioeconomic disparities in switching to ECs will perpetuate a greater burden of tobacco- related death 
and disease among disadvantaged populations. As a human behavioral EC study in which toxicant exposure via the tobacco- specific nitrosamine, NNAL, a highly potent 
pulmonary carcinogen will be measured, this project addresses a critical barrier in the 
PROJECT SWITCH Protocol  
NIH PROJECT #5SC3GM122628- 02; CLINICALTRIAL.GOV IDENTIFIER: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
field and advances science on the widely used practice of EC use for harm reduction 
among the two largest ethnic minority groups in the US, Latinx  and African Americans. 
Furthermore, this will be among the first studies to determine how uptake of ECs affects cogn itive-perceptual factors involved in sustained tobacco use, such as risk perceptions, 
utility of smoking, self -efficacy to quit, and tobacco dependence  among under -
represented minority smokers . This study is directly relevant to the NIH’s mission to 
addres s cancer risk factors and supports the long -term objective to reduce the disease 
burden of tobacco use. In the current proposal, Latinx  (n=90) and African American 
(n=90) cigarette smokers will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to an EC group ( n=60 per 
racial/ethnic group; N =120) or an assessment -only control group ( n=30 per racial/ethnic 
group; N=60). Those randomized to EC will receive a 6- week supply of a fourth generation 
EC starter kit with their choice of liquid flavor from a standard list.  Those randomized to 
assessment only ( n=60) will not be provided with an EC. Tobacco consumption in both 
groups will be assessed at weeks 0 (baseline), 2, and 6. Changes in toxic exposure (NNAL, a primary lung carcinogen and the primary outcome) and carbon monoxide (CO) 
will be measured from baseline to week 6.  Planned covariates include study s ite, gender, 
income, tobacco dependence score, and mental health symptoms.  
 Aim 1.  To characterize the toxic exposure of cigarette smokers randomized to the 
EC group compared to cigarette smokers randomized to assessment -only controls  
Hypothesis 1: It is hypothesized that toxicant exposure from baseline to week 6 
will be significantly lower in the EC group compared to the assessment -only group. 
Hypothesis 2: It is hypothesized that change in cigarette consumption in the EC 
group from baseline to week 6 will be associated with reduction in toxicant 
exposure from baseline to w eek 6.  
 Aim 2. To assess the effects of uptake of e- cigarettes on perceptions of harm a nd 
utility of products  
It is hypothesized that from baseline to week 6, the EC as compared to control arm a) will have decreased perceptions of harm to their health from current tobacco use, b) will increase positive utility of EC and increase negative uti lity of cigarette 
products, and c) will have decreased expectations of the difficulty of quitting cigarette smoking.  
 
Aim 3. To understand patterns of tobacco product consumption among smokers 
switching to electronic cigarettes  
Changes in tobacco product consumption (cotinine- verified), subjective effects of 
smoking, and levels of tobacco dependence from baseline to week [ADDRESS_139783] experienced difficulty in quitting cigarettes and for whom EC use as a harm reduc tion strategy has been considered. The 
study will enhance the research environment at the PI’s university which is classified as

IV. Participant Recruitment  
Recruitment will utilize  online sources including  Craigslist and Facebook, as well as radio 
advertisements, newspaper advertisement s, flyers, information cards, clinic referrals, 
participant referrals, and community  outreach. Enrolled participants will be  encouraged 
to refer other smokers to the study  and provided material such as information cards, pens, 
and t -shirts  to facilitate referrals .   
 
Sample Size . We estimated our sample requirements using power analyses for primary 
aims to characterize the reduction in toxic exposure of cigarette smokers randomized to the e-cigarette  group compared to cigarette smokers randomized to assessment -only 
controls (Aim 1:H1) from baseline to week [ADDRESS_139788] larger effects ( d=-0.67) on primary outcomes (NNAL) for 
the ~40% of smokers able to switch more completely relative to smokers partially switching ( d=-0.16). With no change expected in control, we powered primary outcomes 
for end- of-treatment analyses using an average of effects given 30% of switching 
smokers with large and 70% with small effects. With a median effect of - 0.37 ( SD=0.11) 
across 1000 data sets, simulations revealed that the planned design would provide 
greater than 0.82 power for detecting the treatment differences with a sample of 180 subjects, with an allowance for up to 20% attrition. For Aim1: H2 we will have power to detect moderate effects of changes in cigarette consumption on change in toxicants. In published effects of differences in consumption levels on nitrosamines,  77 differences in 
consumption (20 vs 10 cig/day) reflected mean difference in log NNAL of 2.60- 2.35=0.[ADDRESS_139789] sizes with d =0.48 after 10 weeks 78. We estimate adequate power >0.80 given 
expected cigarette reductions. Changes in cognitive measures (Aim 2) including decreased perception of harm, average differences  in utility of combustible and EC, and 
increased self -efficacy for quitting are expected to be moderately associated with EC use.

Informed Consent.  The informed consent  will be  reviewed by [CONTACT_124350]. The participant will be  given time to read the informed consent 
form and ask questions. I t will be  made clear in the consent form that the participant has 
the option to take more time to consider their desire to participate in the study and 
reschedule at a later date, or to decline to participate at any point . The study beg ins once 
the participant signs the consent  form, indicating understanding of the procedures, 
requirements, and consent.   
 Incentives. Participants will be compensated for their time during the lab visits at 
escalating  increments of $20 at baseline, $40 at week 2, and $60 at week 6,  totaling up 
to $120. Participants in the e- cigarette group are  instructed  that full compensation is 
contingent upon bringing back their used and unused pods to their next visit. At week 2 
and week 6, $[ADDRESS_139795] the opportunity to participate in a follow -up phone assessment six 
months after enrollment, entailing an additional $20 compensat ion.  
 
Study E-cigarettes.  Participants in the e- cigarette group will be  provided  JUUL , a 
nicotine- salt based  e-cigarette  (see Figure 2).  Participants will have  the flavor selection 
of Virginia tobacco, cool mint, menthol, or mango pods containing .07 mL nicotine (5% 
nicotine). Pod use will be  tracked using the Pod Count F orm, requiring participants to 
bring to lab visits all used, unused, and partially used pods. Pods will be distributed based on cigarette use, and determined using the Pod Count Calculation Form. Education about 
switching w ill be  verbally provided to the e -cigarette group . Participants  will engage in 
motivational enhancement -based action planning  and will receive JUUL usage  
instructions.  Participants  in the e -cigarette group  will be provided a compatible wall 
adapter to ensure proper charging , a device car rying case , Q-tips to clean the device as 
needed, and a gallon Ziplock bag to store used pods.

VII. Participant Retention  
Participant retention will be  maintained by [CONTACT_2329] a variety of contact [CONTACT_124351], text, email, physical letter in the mail, and reaching out to emergency contacts. No 
more than six contact [CONTACT_14386], of various forms, will be made. Contact[CONTACT_124352] a letter will be  the last efforts made to contact [CONTACT_124353]. Additionally, participants will be  sent postcards reminding them of the day 
and time of their next lab visit, and  appointment reminder cards will be given out at the 
baseline and week [ADDRESS_139796] pre-determined time windows. The week 2 visit can  be scheduled up 
to one week before or after the originally scheduled date of two weeks after the baseline 
visit. The week 6 visit can  be scheduled up to four weeks before or after the originally 
scheduled date of six weeks after the baseline visit.  Ripple  protocol details the 
scheduling protocol.

CO measurement.  Exhaled breath samples will be  taken at all visits for carbon monoxide 
(CO), a by -product of smoke, using a Bedfont Micro+ Smokerlyzer. At baseline , CO 
measurement w ill be  taken to confirm eligibility . A carbon monoxide level over 5ppm 
verifie s smoking  status. A carbon monoxide level 5ppm or lower at baseline makes a 
person ineligible to participate in the study.  Participants will be allowed the opportunity to 
re-screen two weeks later.  
 
Blood pressure.  Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be  measured for screening 
purposes and throughout the study using a digital blood pressure cuff. If, at the baseline or week 2  visit, a participant’s systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 160 mm 
Hg or their diastolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 105 mm Hg, they will not be eligible to participate or continue participating in the study. Pulse will also be measured but not as an exclusion criteria. Participants who are ineligible at baseline due to uncontrolled blood pressure will be allowed the opportunity to re- screen two weeks later.  
 
Height and weight.  A medical scale will be  used for a one- time measure of height. 
Weight will be  measured at baseline and week 6 visit, with shoes removed.  
 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]. Lung function will be  measured at all lab visits using a  Discovery -2 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_124336]. At each session, participants will complete a minimum of three 
maneuvers (depending on the quality) consisting of a strong exhale and a strong inhale.

Saliva sampling. Saliva sampling i s an exploratory addition to this study and w ill be taken 
from ten San Diego participants at baseline and week 6. The decision to take saliva 
sampling in San Diego resulted in an increase from the or iginal n=90 to an n=94. Samples  
will be frozen and transported the testing facility  on dry ice.  
 
Nasal swab sampling. Nasal swab sampling is  an exploratory addition to this study and 
will be  taken from twenty Kansas City participants at baseline and week 6. The decision 
to take nasal swab sampling in Kansas City resulted in an increase of two participants for 
a final n =92. Samples  will be frozen and transported the testing facility  on dry ice . 
 
Urine sampling.  Urine will be  collected at all lab visits and refrigerated  until aliquoting . 
Participants will be  instructed to provide at least half of the specimen cup of urine (about 
60mL). Participants will be offered water at the beginning of lab sessions  to help facilitate 
sampling . 
 
Urine will be  processed by [CONTACT_124354], each [ADDRESS_139798] for NNAL and will receive no additional 
treatment. Both samples will be  frozen and stored at - 20 °C before shippi[INVESTIGATOR_124342].  
 A urine log will provide the following information for each urine sample: (1) participant ID (2) st udy time point (3) date: mm/dd/yyyy (4) testing for: NNAL or cotinine. Each lab visit 
will produce two samples stored for further testing.

At each lab visit, participants will receive compensation and sign a receipt . At the end of 
the study, participants will be given a referral to the [LOCATION_004] Smokers’ Helpline (1-800-
NO-BUTTS) or Kansas Tobacco Quitline (1- 800-QUIT -NOW) .  
 
 XI. Study Questionnaires  
Surveys  will contain items on demographics, smoking measures, tobacco measures, 
physiological measures, and psychosocial assessments.  Given the possibility of low 
literacy among participants, surveys will be  verbally administered along with visual  cue 
cards.    
XII. Data Management  
Missing data will be  minimized through extensive training of research staff in addition to 
follow -up with participants. Data will be  entered into REDcap electronically  and paper 
forms  (biological measures  and pod count form s) will be stored in participant files . Paper 
forms with identifiable information such as consent and contact [CONTACT_7059] a separate, locked location. TLFB data will be entered into excel, with paper calendars 
and data entry forms stored in participant files.  REDcap entry will happen after the lab 
session and will be  audited and checked by [CONTACT_124357]. REDCap is a secure,  
HIPAA- compliant,  web-based application designed to support data capture for research 
studies. All protocol -specified data will be  linked by [CONTACT_124358], assigned at 
randomization. Paper files will be  stored on site in a locked filling cabinet and any forms 
with identifying information (consent form and contact [CONTACT_124359]) will be  kept in a separate 
location. Data is only  accessible to personnel involved with this research. Access is 
limited by [CONTACT_124360].  
  
XIII. Recording and Reporting of Adverse Effects  
Development of any adverse effects will be  monitored closely by a project manager such 
that fields capturing adverse events will be  reviewed daily . At each study visit, participants 
will be  asked about the development of any  other,  new, or worsening symptoms . At each 
visit and each phone call after the initial visit , participants in the e- cigarette condition will 
be asked if they were  experiencing any barriers to switching to e- cigarettes or any 
concerns about switching. This open- ended format is intended to capture any unexpected 
adverse events. Unexpected serious adverse events will be  reported to the CSUSM IRB 
and assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_124345] e- cigarette use, and if so, reported to 
the NIH and FDA. Participants will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_124361], problems using their e- cigarette, or if any adverse events develop.

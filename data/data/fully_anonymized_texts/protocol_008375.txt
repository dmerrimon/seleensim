Confidential and Proprietary 5 13 October 2017 the 4 -week double -blind treatment phase of Study SEP361-201. 
Subjects who m eet the entry criteria will transition immediately from Study SEP 361-201 (at Visit  7; 
assessments perf ormed at Study SEP361-201 Visit 7 will serve as the Baseline assessments for the 
present study). Informed consent will be obtained from all subjects befor e any study procedures are 
performed for the present study. 
Subjects will attend an initial visit on Day  1 (same day as Visit  7 of study SEP361-201). Subjects may 
be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_830220], if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_11856]. 
During the treatment period, clinic visits will occur as shown in the following figure, during which the 
procedures outlined in Table  [ADDRESS_1152203] 
4 weeks, then every 4  weeks thereafter up to week  26. Telephone calls will be made by a member of 
the clinical research staff to the subjects between scheduled study visits (between Weeks 1 and 2, and 
at Weeks 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 25) to monitor clinical symptoms and adverse events. If subject appears to be symptomatic, an unscheduled visit will be made as early as possible.  Subjects 
who discontinue early from the study or complete study will be required to complete the follow-up visi t 
7 days (±  2 days) post last dose of study drug. 
Study Sc
hematic 
Note: Titration up to 7 5 mg/day is permitted (but not required) on Day 4 for reasons of efficacy as an unscheduled visit.
All 
subjects will receive open -label SEP-363856 50 mg/day from D ay 1 through Day 3. Beginning on 
Day 4, flexible dosing ranging from 25 to 75 mg/day is permitted, if deemed clinically necessary (for 
reasons of safety, tolerability, or efficacy) by [CONTACT_737]. On Day  4, subjects are permitted (but 
not required) to titrate up to 75  mg/day for reasons of efficacy . Thereafter, if a dose increase is 
necessary to optimize efficacy  it should occur at regular scheduled study visits based on Investigator 
judgement. Day  4 dosing changes will occur at an unscheduled visit. T hereafter, an increase in dose 
should occur at weekly intervals in increments of one dose level at a time to a maximum dose of 75 mg/day. Dose reduction for tolerability purposes is allowed  at any time during the study. 
Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study by [CONTACT_830252], ECGs, vital signs, AEs, clinical laboratory parameters, C -SSRS, body weight, and BMI. 
Subjects who have any new significant findings or worsening of findings for suicidal ideation or behavior upon completion of the C-SSRS at any time during the study must be referred to the 
investigator for follow -up evaluation. 
Subjects who meet any discontinuation/withdrawal criteria will be terminated from the study. Upon 
termination from the study, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_830221] [ADDRESS_1152204] be approved by [CONTACT_1689]. 
Effectiveness will be evaluated using the PANSS total and subscale scores, as well as CGI -S, BNSS , 
and MADRS scores.  
Subjects will provide information on subjective drug effects via administration of the DEQ. In addition, effects on movement disorders will be measured using the AIMS, BARS and SAS scales. Subjective 
effects on sleep will b e measured by [CONTACT_830253].  Effects on cognition will be assessed by [CONTACT_830254] (C BB) and the CogState Schizophrenia Battery (CSB), and a functional

Statistical Methods:  
The analysis of the long -term safety and tolerability, and efficacy will be based on the safety 
population, which includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug during the 26- week 
OL exte nsion period.  
The primary analysis for the study is to assess the incidence of AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to 
discontinuation. AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation will be summarized by [CONTACT_830255], and AEs by [CONTACT_6657]. AEs will 
be further summarized by [CONTACT_110204]. The summary of AEs will be 
limited to those AE occurring on or after the first dose (of the 26 -week OL ex tension period) of study 
drug. 
Absolute values and changes from DB Baseline of Study SEP 361-201 and OL Baseline of Study 
SEP361-202 in clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, glucose and lipid 
panel, prolactin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA
1c)) and in clinical ev aluations (vital signs, body 
weight, BMI, blood pressure [supi[INVESTIGATOR_135456]], heart rate [supi[INVESTIGATOR_135456]], 12- lead ECGs) 
will be summarized descriptively. Changes in physical examinations will also be summarized 
descriptively. The frequency and severity of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior using the C- SSRS 
will be provided . 
Clinical response to 4  weeks of treatment with SEP-363856 is defined as meeting both of the following 
criteria: (1) a decrease in PANSS total score of ≥ 20% from baseline, and (2)  a CGI -S score ≤ 4. For 
subjects assigned to double-blind SEP-363856, clinical response will be evaluated using the Day [ADDRESS_1152211] the OL baseline of study SEP 361-202. 
Relapse will be identified programmatically using the pre-defined criteria among subjects who demonstrated a clinical response to 4  weeks of treatment with SEP- 363856. The rate of relapse will be 
calculated as the proportion of subjects with a relapse in the 26 -week OL extension period, along with 
the 95% confidence interval. The time -to-relapse will be summarized descriptively and will also be 
presented by a Kaplan -Meier plot.  
Descriptive statistics will be presented  on the change in PANSS total and subscale scores, change in 
CGI-S score, change in BNSS total score, and change in MADRS  total score. Changes from DB 
Baseline of Study SEP361-201 and OL Baseline of Study SEP361-202 will be presented. The 
proportion of subjects who achieve a response, defined as a 20% or greater improvement in PANSS 
total score from the baseline, and calculated using (1) the DB Baseline of Study SEP361-201 for 
subjec ts assigned to double-blind SEP-363856,and (2) the OL Baseline of Study SEP361-202 for 
subjects assigned to double-blind placebo, will be calculated . 
Sample Size:  All subjects who complete the 4 -week double-blind treatment period of Study 
SEP361-201 are el igible  to enroll. It is anticipated that approximately 180 subjects will enter this 
open -label extension study.

4.1. Background  
Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a mixture 
of positive symptoms (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and thought and movement disorders), negative symptoms (eg, flat affect, anhedonia, alogia, and avolition), and cognitive deficits (eg, 
impaired memory, attention, and planning/organizing). Mood symptoms such as depression, 
anxiety, hostility, a nd excitement can also be present in patients with schizophrenia ( Patel -2007; 
NIMH -2010). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_120681], schizophrenia remains one of the most challenging 
diseases to treat due to its variable nature, the heterogeneity of clinical response, the side effects of treatment, and its association with high morbidity and mortality ( Lehman -2004; Tandon-2008; 
NIMH -2010). 
Schizophrenia has an estimated population prevalence of approximately 1% (estimated 2.4 million adults), with a diagnosed prevalence of 0.51% in the [LOCATION_002] ( Narrow -2002; 
Wu-2006). It affects both genders equally (NIMH -2010) typi[INVESTIGATOR_830230], with the peak ages of onset in the early to mid 20s in men and late 20s in women (APA-2000). It is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors 
(Minzenberg-2008). Dopaminergic, serotonergic and glutamatergic systems are believed to play 
a role in schizophrenia ( Kuroki-2008; Kim-2009).  
The current standard of care for the treatment of schizophrenia is the use of second generation antipsychotics or “atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709]” (Lehman 2004; Kreyenbuhl-2009; NIMH -2010; 
Meltzer -2011; Nakamura -2009). These “atypi[INVESTIGATOR_8593]” are thought to have fewer extrapyramidal 
side effects compared to first generation antipsychotics or “typi[INVESTIGATOR_16709]” (eg, haloperidol) ( Leucht-2009; Naber -2009 ). However some patients respond poorly to both atypi[INVESTIGATOR_830231]/cognitive impairment ( Keefe -2006; Webber -2008 ). Very few patients return to 
Baseline (pre psychosis) function ( Schultz-1999;  Pearlson -2000; Kapur-2001). In addition, some 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_830232] a variety of other side effects, including weight gain, metabolic syndrome, sedation , QTc prolongation, extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia ( Davis -2004; 
Lieberman -2005; Newcomer -2007; Leucht 2009), which may lead to significant medical 
problems as well as contribute to poor compliance and treatment discontinuation. The large sc ale 
NIMH -CATIE schizophrenia study found that 70% to 80% of outpatients discontinue 
medications because of lack of efficacy or occurrence of side effects (Lieberman 2005) often 
leading to relapse of symptoms and need for rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ( Ascher -Svanum-2010; 
Munro-2011; Morken-2008). Clearly, an unmet need exists for new, effective, and well- tolerated 
treatments .

schizophrenia (positive and negative symptoms), cognition and depression. The molecular target 
responsible for the profile effects has not been completely elucidated, but may include actions at

Confidential and Proprietary 24 13 October 2017 studies showed that SEP-363856 suppressed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in a dose 
dependent manner. In nonhuman primate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
experiments, similar to risperidone, pretreatment with SEP -[ADDRESS_1152224] been completed (SEP361-101, SEP361-103, SEP361-105, 
SEP361-106, and SEP361-108). One Phase 1 study has been clinically completed (SEP361-104). 
The first in human clinical study, a single ascending dose study (SAD; Study SEP361-101), was designed to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and PK of a 
single oral dose of SEP-363856 in normal , healthy, adult male subjects.  
Study SEP361-103 was a randomized, double-blind, plac ebo-controlled, crossover 
polysomnography (PSG) study that investigated the e ffect of a single oral dose (50  mg and 
10 mg) of SEP -363856 on REM sleep suppression and PK in healthy adult male subjects. A 
single 50 mg oral dose of SEP-363856 suppressed REM s leep in all subjects (increased latency 
to REM sleep and reduced time spent in REM sleep) and increased NREM sleep stage 2 (N2), and NREM sleep stage 3 (N3) (deep or slow wave sleep). A single oral [ADDRESS_1152225].  
Study SEP361-105 was a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, SAD study assessing the 
safety, tolerability, and PK of SEP-363856 in male and female subjects with schizophrenia. 
Study SEP361-106 was a 2 part, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple 
ascending oral dose (MAD) and open- label study in male and female schizophrenic patients 
assessing the safety, tolerability, and PK of SEP-363856 in the target patient population. Results 
from this study demonstrate an acceptable safety and tolerability profile of SEP -363856 up to 
28 days in schizophrenia patients. Additionally, in Part 2, treatment with SEP -363856 at 
75 mg/day for 28  days demonstrated improvement in efficacy m easures (PANSS total score, 
CGI-S) compared with Baseline. Furthermore, ad hoc subgroup analyses showed a signi ficantly 
greater decrease from Baseline in PANSS total scores at the end of the 28 -day treatment period 
in subjects who had less frequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_830233]. 
Study SEP361-104 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose study of the 
effects of SEP -363856 (50 mg) and amisulpride (400 mg) on BOLD- fMRI signal in healthy adult 
male and female subjects with high or low schizotype characteristics . Subjects with high 
schizotype characteristics and patients with schizophrenia share many similar features including positive, cognitive, negative and anhedonia symptoms, although in high schizotypes the features 
present in an attenuated form. In this study, fMRI was used in combination with a validated 
monetary incentive delay (MID) task to examine the single dose effects SEP -[ADDRESS_1152226] processing. During the anticipation/motivational phase of the task, SEP-[ADDRESS_1152227] amisulpride. During the

Taken together the overall pattern of activity during MID task performance support specific 
hypotheses for the potential of SEP-363856, a novel MoA molecule, to improve positive and 
negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Overall, the known molecular pharmacology profile, animal model evidence, and clinical experience in healthy adult male and female subjects, adult 
male and female subjects with high and low schizotype characteristics, and patients with 
schizophrenia provide further support to evaluate SEP-363856 as a potential treatment for schizophrenia. 
This is an open-label extension study to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
flexibly -dosed SEP -363856 (25, 50 or 75 mg) over 26 weeks of treatment in adult subjects with 
schizophrenia who completed 4 weeks of double- blind treatment Study SEP 361-201. 
4.3. Risk-Benefit Assessme nt 
Overall, in previous clinical studies SEP -363856 was generally safe and well tolerated. The 
pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profiles observed in adults from completed clinical studies support evaluation of dose levels of 25 to  75 mg /day in adults with schizophrenia.

Subjects who meet the entry criteria will transition immediately from Study SEP 361-201 (at 
Visit 7; assessments performed at Study SEP 361-201 Visit 7 will serve as the Baseline 
assessments for the present stud y). Informed consent will be obtained from all subjects before 
any study procedures are performed for the present study.  
Subjects will attend an initial visit on Day  1 (same day as Visit  7 of study SEP361-201). Subjects 
may be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_830235], if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_3786]. During the treatment period, clinic visits will occur as shown in the following 
figure, during which the procedures outlined in Table [ADDRESS_1152231] 4  weeks, then every 4  weeks thereafter up to week 26. Telephone 
calls will be made by a member of the clinical research staff to the subjects between scheduled study visits (between Weeks 1 an d 2, and at Weeks 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 25) to 
monitor clinical symptoms and adverse events. If subject appears to be symptomatic, an 
unscheduled visit will be made as early as possible. Subjects who discontinue early from the 
study or complete study will be required to complete the follow-up visit 7 days (±  2 days ) post 
last dose of study drug.

Note: Titration up to 7 5 mg/day is permitted (but not required) on Day 4 for reasons of efficacy as an unscheduled visit.  
 
All subjects will receive open -label SEP-363856 50 mg/day from Day  1 through Day 3. 
Beginning on Day 4, flexible dosing ranging from 25 to 75 mg/day is permitted, if deemed 
clinically necessary (for reasons of safety, tolerability, or efficacy) by [CONTACT_737]. On Day  4, 
subjects are permitted (but not required) to titrate up to 75  mg/day  for reasons of efficacy . 
Thereafter, if a dose increase is necessary to optimize efficacy it should occur at regular scheduled study visit based on Investigator judgement. Day 4 dosing changes will occur at an 
unscheduled visit. Thereafter, an increase in dose should occur at weekly intervals in increments of one dose level at a time to a maximum dose of 75 mg/day. Dose redu ction for tolerability 
purposes is allowed at any time during the study.

Effectiveness will be evaluated using the PANSS total and subscale scores, as well as CGI -S, 
BNS S, and MADRS scores. 
Subjects will provide information on subjective drug effects via administration of the DEQ. In 
addition, effects on movement disorders will be measured using the AIMS, BARS and SAS  
scales. Subjective effects on sleep will be measured by [CONTACT_830253]. Effects on cog nition will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_830261]  (CBB) and the CogState Schizophrenia Battery ( CSB) , 
and a functional outcome measure (UPSA- B total score).  
Blood samples for determination of plasma SEP -363856 and SEP -363854 concentrations will be 
collected at Visit 2E, 5E, 8E, and 11E. POPPK  analysis will be performed using plasma 
SEP-363856 concentrations; the results of which will be reported separately.  
Subjects who meet any discontinuation/withdrawal criteria will be terminated from the study.

7.2. Treatment Assignment and Blinding  
This is an open- label study. All subjects will receive flexible dosing with SEP-363856 (25, 50, or 
75 mg /day).  
7.2.1. Emergency Unblinding Procedures  
This is an open- label study . 
7.3. Rationale  
7.3.1. Rationale for the Study Design 
This is an open-label extension study to further evaluate the long- term safety and tolerability of 
flexibly -dosed SEP -363856 (25, 50 or 75 mg ) over 26 weeks of treatment in adult subjects with 
schizophrenia who completed 4  weeks of double- blind treatment in Study SEP361-201. 
Long -term effectiveness  of SEP-363856 will also be evaluated. 
7.3.2. Rationale for the Dosages 
In the present study, dosing of SEP -363856 at 25, 50, or 75 mg /day for 26 weeks will be utilized  
based on observed safety and tolerability in previous studies. Dosages of 50 or 75 mg /day were 
evaluated in Study SEP 361-201. Selection of this dose range was guided by [CONTACT_830262] (MTD) determined for single doses of SEP -363856 administered to heal thy adult 
subjects in Study SEP 361-101 (50 mg); the MTD determined for single doses administered to 
adult subjects with schizophrenia in Study SEP 361-105 (75 mg ); by [CONTACT_830263] (Studies SEP361-103 and SEP 361-104 [50 mg ]) which 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.[ADDRESS_1152234] CNS activity). Study SEP361-108 in narcolepsy subjects  also 
demonstrated CNS activity (i.e., REM  suppression) at 25 and 50 mg . In addition, dose selection 
is supported by [CONTACT_830264] m the 7 -day (10  – 75 mg ) and open 
label 28 -day (75 mg ) MAD study (Study SEP361-106, Parts 1 and 2) in adult subjects with 
schizophrenia. 
7.4. Prevention of Missing Data  
In an effort to minimize the number of subjects who are terminated from the study prior to s tudy 
completion, the following study design and conduct elements are implemented: 
• allowance of a dose reduction (from 75 to 50 mg /day or from 50 to 25 mg /day) for drug 
tolerability purposes 
• allowance of some concomitant psychotropic medications during stud y participation  
• train the study centers on the importance of continued follow-up and on the informed 
consent process, ensuring subjects understand the commitment they are making, 
including the intent to complete the trial 
• monitor data collection for adherence during the study 
Please see Section  15.[ADDRESS_1152235] meet all of the following inclusion criteria:  
1. Subject must give written informed consent and privacy authorization prior to 
participation in the study and able to comply with the protocol, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. Separate consent will be obtained from a caregiver or legal guardian if 
required by [CONTACT_1769].  
2. Subject has completed Study SEP361-[ADDRESS_1152236] at Visit 7 of Study 
SEP361-201; females who are post- menopausal (defined as at least 12  months of 
spontaneous amenorrhea) and those who have undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy will be exempted from the pregnancy test. Female subject of reproductive potential agrees to remain abstinent or use highly effective  and reliable contraception 
throughout the study and for at least [ADDRESS_1152237] dose of study drug has been taken (See Section  21 Appendix II Highly Effective Contraceptive procedures). In the 
Investigator's judgment, the subject will adhere to this requirement. 
5. Male subjects with female partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree to avoid fathering a child and use highly effective methods of birth control from screening until at 
least [ADDRESS_1152238] not meet any of the following exclusion criteria:  
1. Subject answers "yes" to "suicidal ideation" Item  4 (active suicidal ideation with some 
intent to act, without specific plan) or Item 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) on the C- SSRS assessment at Visit  7 of Study SEP361-201. Subjects who 
answer "yes" to this question must be referred to the Investigator for follow-up evaluation. 
2. Subject has a clinically significant abnormality including physical examination, vital 
signs, ECG, or laboratory test at Visit [ADDRESS_1152239] has a positive urine drug screen (UDS) or breath alcohol test at Visit [ADDRESS_1152240] is at high risk of non-compliance in the Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].

visit is  presented in Table 2. 
11.1. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics (date of birth, sex, ethnicity, race), height, and medical and psychiatric history 
collected at Visit [ADDRESS_1152249] all medications used to treat sch izophrenia in the eCRF. Also, the following 
parameters will be recorded for all concomitant medications: drug name, route of administration, 
total daily dose, unit, frequency, start/stop dates, indication, and whether the medication was 
started after last dose of study drug . The prior and concomitant medications will subsequently be 
coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO- DD).  
11.3. Efficacy Assessments  
11.3.1. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 
The PANSS is an interview -based measure of the severity of psychopathology in adults with 
psychotic disorders. The measure is comprised of 30 items and 3  scales: the Positive scale 
assesses hallucinations, delusions, and related symptoms; the Negative scale assesses emotional 
withdrawal, lack of mo tivation, and similar symptoms; and the General Psychopathology scale 
addresses other symptoms such as anxiety, somatic concern, and disorientation. An anchored 
Likert scale from 1  - 7, where values of 2 and above indicate the presence of progressively mor e 
severe symptoms, is used to score each item. Individual items are then summed to determine 
scores for the 3  scales, as well as a total score. A Composite scale score (Positive scale score 
minus Negative scale score) can also be calculated to show the rel ative valence of positive and 
negative symptoms. Total time required for the PANSS interview and scoring is approximately 30 – 40 minutes ( Guy-1976, Kay-1994;  Opler -1992; Perkins-2000). PANSS raters will be 
required to meet specific training and education criteria before they are certified to rate for this study. In addition, raters will receive specific training and education regarding all of the assessments prior to study initiation.  
11.3.2. Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS)  
The BNSS  is a rating scale to measur e the current level of severity of negative symptoms in 
schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder . The measure is comprised of 13 individual items  and 
5 domain scores (blunt ed affect , alogia, avolition, anhedonia, and asociality ). The 5  domain 
scores provide a summary score and the 13 individual items provide a composite total score 
(ranging from 0  to 78). Each of the items are scored  on a Likert -type 7-point scale from 0 - 6, 
where values of 0  indicates symptom is absent and a value of 6 means the symptom is a severe 
form. The number of items varies per domain. BNSS  raters will be required to meet specific 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 42 13 October 2017 training and education criteria before they are certified to rate for this study. In addition, raters 
will receive specific training and education regar ding all of the assessments prior to study 
initiation.  
11.3.3. Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)  
The MADRS is a clinician -rated assessment of the subject’s level of depression. The measure 
contains 10 items that measure apparent and reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep and 
appetite, difficulty concentrating, lassitude, inability to feel, and pessimistic and suicidal 
thoughts. Each item is scored in a range of 0 to  6 points, with higher scores indicating increased 
depressive symptoms. The Structured Interview Guide for the MADRS (SIGMA) 
(Williams -2008) will be used for the administration of the MADRS assessment. T he MADRS 
will be administered by a qualified rater at the site.  
11.3.4. Clinical Global Impressions – Severity Scale (CGI -S) 
The CGI-S is a clinician -rated assessment of the subject’s current illness state on a 7 -point scale, 
where a higher score is associated with greater illness severity. Following a clinical interview, 
the CGI-S can be completed in 1  to 2 minutes. The CGI -S will be admin istered by a qualified 
rater at the site.  
11.3.5. CogState Brief Battery (CBB) and CogState Schizophrenia Battery (CS B) 
The CBB will be completed at Visit 1E (ie, Baseline, which is the same day as Visit 7 of Study 
SEP361-201). The CBB assesses four domains. The D etection test (Attention Domain) measures 
speed of performance. The mean of the log10 transformed reaction times for correct responses 
are utilized to determine the score. Lower scores correspond to better performance. The 
Identification test (Information Processing Domain also measures speed of performance. The 
mean of the log10 transformed reaction times for correct responses are utilized to determine the 
score. Lower scores correspond to better performance. The One Card Learning test (Visual 
Learning Domain) measures accuracy of performance. Arcsine transformation of the proportion of correct responses are utilized to determine the domain score. Higher scores correspond to 
better performance. The One-back Memory test (Working Memory Domain) measures Arcsi ne 
transformation of the proportion of correct responses is  utilized to determine the domain score. 
Higher scores correspond to better performance. 
The CSB will be completed at Visit 7E (Week  12) and Visit 11E (Week  26). The CSB includes 
the four domains of the CBB and three additional domains. The Internal Shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_183140] (Verbal 
Learning Domain) measures the t otal number of correct responses made in remembering the list 
on three consecutive learning trials. Higher scores correspond to better performance. Groton Maze Learning (Problem Solving Domain) measures the t otal number of errors made in 
attempting to learn the same hidden pathway on five consecutive trials . Lower scores correspond 
to better performance. Social Emotional Cognition (Social Cognition Doma in) measures 
accuracy of performance. A rcsine transformation of the proportion of correct responses is 
utilized to determine the domain score. Higher scores correspond to better performance.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) 
The AIMS is a clinician -rated assessment of abnormal movements consisting of unobtrusive 
observation of the subject at rest (with shoes removed) and several questions or instructions 
directed toward the subject. Using a severity scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (severe), clinicians 
rate dyskinesia in several body regions, including the facial area, extremities, and trunk. There are two items related to dental status, as well as three global i mpression items assessing overall 
severity, incapacitation, and the subject’s awareness of abnormal movements ( Guy-1976; 
Munetz-1988). The AIMS raters will be required to meet specific credential and educational criteria before they are certified to rate f or this study. The AIMS will be administered by a 
qualified rater at the site.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) 
The BARS is a rating scale geared toward assessment of neuroleptic -induced akathisia, though it 
can be used to measure akathisia associated with other drugs as well. The BARS consists of four 
items, including one item assessing objective restlessness, two items targeting subjective restlessness (awareness and related distress), and one global clinical assessment item. All items are anchored an d utilize a 4 -point scale, except for the global rating which has a 6 -point scale 
(from absence of akathisia through severe akathisia). The subjective and objective items are summed to yield a total score. The BARS can be administered in about 10 minutes (Barnes -1989; Barnes -2003). The BARS will be administered by a qualified rater at the site.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Simpson- Angus Scale (SAS)  
The SAS is a clinician -rated assessment of neuroleptic-induced Parkinsonism consisting of 
10 items. Items are anchor -based, rated on a 5-po int scale, and address rigidity, gait 
(bradykinesia), tremor, glabellar tap, and salivation ( Siddiqui-2009; Simpson-1970). The SAS 
will be administered by a qualified rater at the site.  A modified version of the SAS will be 
utilized for this study ( SAS). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS) 
The C-SSRS is a tool designed to systematically assess and track suicidal adverse events 
(suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation) throughout the trial. The strength of this suicide classification system is in  its ability to comprehensively identify suicidal events while limiting 
the over-identification of suicidal behavior. The scale takes approximately 5 minutes to 
administer. The C- SSRS will be administered by a trained rater at the site. Subjects with Type  4 
or 5 suicidal ideation during the study will be discontinued from the study and referred to a 
mental health professional ( Posner-2007). For all visits the “Since Last Visit” version of the 
C-SSRS will be used.

Confidential and Proprietary 55 13 October 2017 12. SAFETY R EPORTING
12.1. Definitions 
12.1.1. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related . 
Untoward medical occurrences that occur between the time of signing the ICF and first drug 
administration are pre -treatment events. Those that occur after first adminis tration of study drug 
are considered AEs.  
An AE can , therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease occurring after the administration of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product. AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. A Es will be 
collected from after first administration of study drug to the last study visit. 
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE 
and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
12.1.2. Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
•Results in death.
•Is life-threatening.
•Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].
•Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity.
•Is a congenital anomaly  or birth defect.
•Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject  or may require a
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions  that do
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .
The term "severe" is often used to describe the severity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, 
or severe myo cardial infarction)  (see Section  12.3); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
"serious," which is based on subject /event out come or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject 's life or functioning as defined by [CONTACT_29967]. 
During the study, if a subject  has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (eg, elective surgery) that was 
scheduled befor e the study entry, ie, before informed consent for an event/condition that 
occurred before the study, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29919] a therapeutic intervention and not the 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 56 13 October 2017 result of a SAE. However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it should be reported 
as an AE (or SAE, if the event/condition results in a serious outcome such as prolongation of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
Life-threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred. This definition does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death.  
SAE criteria information will be captured on the CRF. 
12.2. Objective Findings 
Clinically significant abnormal objective findings (eg, clinical laboratory value, ECG value, and 
physical examination observation) will also be recorded as  AEs. 
When a clear diagnosis is available that explains the objective findings, this diagnosis will be 
recorded as the AE, and not the abnormal objective finding (eg , viral hepatitis will be recorded as 
the AE, not transaminase elevation). If a definite diagnosis is not available, then record the sign (eg, clinically significant elevation of transaminase levels) or symptom (eg, abdominal pain) as the AE.  
Clinical laboratory test results will be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. The Investigator must 
determine the clinical significance of all out of range values. Clinical laboratory test with possibly drug- related or clinically relevant abnormal values of uncertain causalit y may be 
repeated. Any abnormal values that persist should be followed at the discretion of the Investigator. Laboratory reports will be initialed and dated on all pages by [CONTACT_737]. 
Clinical Laboratory Tests Outside the Normal Range: Any value outside the normal range will be 
flagged for the attention of the Investigator or appropriate designee at the study center. The 
Investigator or appropriate designee will indicate whether or not the value is of clinical 
significance. If the result of any test (or repeat test, if done) from the samples taken is indicated 
as clinically significant and is not covered by [CONTACT_725983]  8.1, the subject will 
not be allowed into the study. Additional test ing during the study may be done if medically 
indicated. If a clinically significant abnormality is found in the samples taken after dosing, 
during the study, and/or at the Follow-Up Visit, this should be recorded as an AE and the subject 
will be followed until the test(s) has (have) normalised or stabilised.  
All on -site ECG tracings and ECG over -read reports will be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. The 
Investigator must determine the clinical significance of all abnormal ECG s. ECG with possibly 
drug- related or clinically relevant abnormal findings of uncertain causality  may be repeated . Any 
abnormal ECGs that persist should be followed at the discretion of the Investigator. ECG 
tracings will be initialed and dated on all pages by [CONTACT_737]. 
12.3. Collection and Recording of Adverse Events  
All pre -treatment events and AEs must be recorded in the subject’s study records/source 
documents in accordance with the Investigat or’s normal clinical practice. All pre -treatment 
events and AEs/all AEs must be recorded on the CRF.  
All AEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization of the condition, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 57 13 October 2017 Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity , frequency , seriousness,  action taken with the

STUDY/DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY DRUG
13.1. Criteria for Subject Termination/Study Drug Discontinuation  
Subjects may be discontinued from the study drug at any time for any of the following reasons: 
•Adverse event  (specify)
•Lack of efficacy (specify)
•Withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130] (specify)
•Non-compliance with study drug (specify )
•Protocol deviation (specify)
•Death
•Progressive disease
•Pregnancy
•Other (specify)
If at any time during the course of the study, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the subject may 
no longer safely participate due to a change in medical status (eg, experiences an AE, becomes 
pregnant), the subject must be discontinued from the study drug. Subjects discontinued from 
study drug will be discontinued from the study. 
The reason and information on the epoch for study drug discontinuation will be recorded on the 
appropriate CRF. In case of death, the date of death should be captured on the CRF. 
13.2. Clinical Assessments after Study Drug Discontinuation  
Subjects who have not received study drug will not be followed up on leaving the study. For subjects who have received  study drug and prematurely discontinue from the study treatment 
(i.e., do not complete through Visit 11E), every effort should be made to complete the final 
evaluation procedures, in accordance with the early termination (ET) visit described in 
Section  11.6.9. 
All subjects who discontinue from the study early will complete a follow up visit 7  (±2) days 
after th e last visit to assess any post  study discontinuation adverse effects as described in  
Section  11.6.10. 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 61 13 October 2017 14. STUDY TERMINATION
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the s tudy at this study center or at multiple centers  
for safety  or administrative reasons at any time  while safeguarding that early termination doe s 
not compromise subjects’ safety or well- being . In particular, a study center that does not recruit 
at an acceptable rate may be closed . Should the study be terminated and/or the study center 
closed for whatever  reason, all documentation and study drugs pertaining to the study must be 
returned to the Sponsor or its representative.  
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], clinical observations suggest it may be unsafe to continue, 
the Investigator may terminate part or the entire study after consultation with the Sponsor. 
In the event of s tudy or site termination, subjects will undergo final evaluation procedures, in 
accordance with the early termination (ET) visit described in Section  11.6.[ADDRESS_1152266] one dose of the extension study treatment, and 
completed or discontinued the study (including reasons for discontinuation).  
15.3.2. Drug Exposure and Compliance  
Drug exposure and compliance during the open- label extension  period will be summarized for 
the safety population.  
Exposure (in days) wil l be calculated as: last extension study dose date - first extension study 
dose date + 1. Exposure will be summarized both as a continuous variable (i.e. mean days) and 
categorically :  
•Number and percentage of subjects with extens ion study drug exposure ≥ 1, ≥ 7, ≥ 14,
≥ 28, ≥ 56, ≥ 84, ≥ 112, ≥ 140, ≥ 168, and ≥ 182 days ;
•Number and percentage of subjects with extension study drug exposure for 1 - 6,
7 - 13, 14 - 27, 28 - 55, 56  - 83, 84 - 111, 112 - 139, 140 - 167, 168 - 181, and
≥ 182 days
Percent com pliance will be calculated as: (number of capsules  taken / number of capsules  should 
have been taken ) × 100%. Percent compliance will be calculated by [CONTACT_830270] -label extension period, and will be summarized both as a continuous variable (ie,  
mean percentage)  and categorically (i.e. number and percentage of subjects in each compliance 
category: non-compliant < 75%, 75% - 125%, non- compliant > 125%, and missing compliance). 
Mean  daily dose will be calculated for the entire open -label extension period as the cumulative 
dose (mg) of SEP -363856 divided by [CONTACT_376898] (in days), where cumulative dose 
is the sum of all doses a subject received during the open- label extension period. Modal daily 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.[ADDRESS_1152267] time (in terms of number of 
days)  among all doses taken . Both mean  daily dose and modal daily dose will be summarized.  
15.3.3. Important Protocol Deviations 
Important protocol deviations (IPDs) will be identified and documented based on a review of 
potentially IPDs. The potentially IPDs will be identified through programmatic checks of s tudy 
data, as well as through review of selected data listings. The potentially IPDs to be reviewed 
include, but are not limited to, subjects who: 
•Did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria  for the open-label extension study.
•Received any disallowed concomitant medication  during the open- label extension
period.
Individual IPDs will be presented in a data listing. The number and percentage of subjects with 
IPDs will be summarized for the safety population by [CONTACT_830271]. 
15.3.4. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics data will be summarized for the safety population. 
Selected data (e.g. PANSS total scor e, CGI -S score, etc. ) will be summarized  at both the

study SEP 361-202. 
Medical history will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  
version 18.[ADDRESS_1152268] one condition in each system organ class  (SOC) 
and preferred term  (PT). 
15.3.5. Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy data will be summarized descriptively for the safety population. 
The absolute values of PANSS total score and subscale scores (positive, negative, and general 
psychopathology), CGI-S score, BNSS total score, and MADRS total score at both the DB baseline of study SEP361-[ADDRESS_1152269]-baseline extension visit, based on both the DB baseline of study SEP361-201 and the OL 
baseline of study SEP361-202. 
PANSS total score and CGI -S score data will also be separately summarized by [CONTACT_551], 
gender, race, and geographic region (i.e. US sites vs. non-US sites). Additional subgroup factor s 
and details of the subgroup analysis will be provided in SAP. The proportion of subjects who achieve a response, defined as a 20% or greater improvement (i.e. 
decrease) in PANSS total score from the baseline at the end of the 26 -week open -label extension  
period, will be calculated based on: (1) the DB baseline of study SEP361-201 for subjects assigned to double-blind SEP-363856, and (2) the OL baseline of study SEP361-202 for subjects

preferred term will be include d in the summaries by [CONTACT_926].
•For summaries by [CONTACT_53429] , AEs will be grouped as “related” or
“not related.” AEs assessed as “possible,” “probable,” or “definite,” will be grouped
as “related.” If a subject reports more than one AE within the same treatment
regimen, SOC and PT, and any are related, it will be s ummarized as related.
Summaries of SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation will also be provided. A listing of AEs, 
as well as a listing of death s, SAEs , or AEs leading to discontinuation, will be presented. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
Clinical laboratory parameters will be summarized by [CONTACT_520140], and by [CONTACT_830274]. Both the

Confidential and Proprietary 66 13 October 2017 of extension study drug; or with a start date prior to, and an end date on or after, the date of the 
first dose of extension study drug, or marked as ongoing, will be considered concomitant 
medications. Medications tha t ended prior to the date of the first dose of extension study drug 
will be considered prior medications. Medications that started after the date of the last dose of 
study drug will not be considered concomitant, but will be considered post- treatment. Prio r and 
Concomitant medications will be summarized for the number and percentage of subjects using each medication and by [CONTACT_830276] y population. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Suicidality Measure  
Frequency and severity of suicidal ideation and suicida l behavior as measured by [CONTACT_941] C-SSRS 
scale will be summarized for each visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rate of Relapse and Time to Relapse 
The relapse will be assessed in subjects who demonstrated clinical response to 4  weeks of

16.1. Data Collection/ Electronic Data Capture (EDC)  
The results from data collected during the study (except clinical laboratory test results)  will be 
recorded in the subject’s  electronic CRF.  Data will be entered into source documents prior to 
being transcribed into the CRF. This transcribing will be done once a subject has been enrolled at  
baseline (Visit 1E) . Data for screen failures will not be collected. The study centers will use an 
EDC system that is compliant with relevant FDA regulatory requirements per  21 code of federal 
regulations (CFR) Part  11. Password protected access to the EDC system will be via a secure 
website. Data queries and data corrections will be handled through the same system. All 
transactions within the EDC system are fully documented within an electronic  audit trail. Each 
set of completed CRFs must be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by [CONTACT_479685].

well as IRB /IEC approval. 
Before recruitment and enrollment, each prospective subject will be given a full explanation of 
the study, allowed to read the approved informed consent form and be provided ample time and 
the opportunity to ask any questions that may arise. Once all questions have been answered and 
the Investigator is assured that the prospective subject understands the implications of 
participating in the study, the prospective subject will be asked to give consent to participate in 
the study by [CONTACT_830278]. As part of the consent process, each prospective 
subject must consent to direct access to his/her medical records for study-related monitoring, 
auditing, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspection. It should be clearly explaine d to each 
prospective subject that participation in each and every clinical visit and assessment is expected.  
The subject may be discontinued from study drug, but that does not necessarily negate the expectation that the subject will continue to participate in the study through the final visit/assessment.  The Investigator will provide a copy of the signed informed consent form to 
each subject , and will record the date of the informed consent on the CRF. 
If an amendment to the protocol changes the subject participation schedule in scope or activity, or if important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent, 
the informed consent form must be revised, submitted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The revised informed consent form must be used to obtain consent from a subject currently enrolled in the s tudy if he or she is affected by [CONTACT_29991]. The revised 
informed consent form must be used to obtain consent from any new subjects who are enrolled into the study after the date of the approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_29928].

October 21, [ADDRESS_1098254] with a threshold two -sided p<0.05. Differences in categorical 
variables were analyzed with Person’s Chi -square or Fisher’s exact  tests, as appropriate based on 
sample sizes. Kaplan -Meier curves using log- rank tests were con structed to graphically display 
time-to-outcome events. Predictor variables were assessed for time-dependent association with 
endocarditis  outcome in univariate Cox proportional hazards regression model. The proportional 
hazards assumption was assessed graphically with log -log plots with plots for significant  
associations.  
Following the initial analysis using Cox regression, classification a nd regression tree (CART) 
methodology was utilized to classify the population into various risk categories for the primary 
outcome (infective endocarditis). Using the CART methodology, pre -specified variables were 
entered in the model and subsequent order/ splitting was determi ned by [CONTACT_796117]. V alidation of the final CART was 
determined by [CONTACT_20750], including receiver operating char acteristic (ROC) curve analysis 
of the predicted probabilities, the number of correctly classif ied subjects within the primary  
cohort as well as cross -validation using a training sample split.

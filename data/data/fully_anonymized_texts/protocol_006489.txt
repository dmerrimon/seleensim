STUDY 
OBJECTIVE(S)
: 
The goal of this study is to evaluate 
surgical site complications (SSCs) 
in subjects undergoing a revision of 
a failed total knee arthroplasty 
(TKA) when closed incision negative 
pressure therapy (ciNPT) is used 
to manage the closed incision, as
 compared to standard of care 
dressing. 
STUDY 
DESIGN: 
This is a post-market, prospective
, randomized, open-label, multicenter, 
controlled study.  
Subjects randomized to the ciNPT 
treatment arm will have a Prevena™ 
Dressing placed over the sutured inci
sion immediately after surgery. 
Negative pressure therapy will 
be delivered by [CONTACT_679549].A.C.

Plus™ [ADDRESS_919370]
ions for Use (IFU) document of the 
selected Prevena
TM 
Dressing but no shorter than five days post-surgery. 
Subjects randomized to the standard of
 care treatment arm will receive 
Aquacel
®
 Ag Surgical incision dressing,
 or another equivalent silver-
impregnated dressing, up to the maxi
mum number of days specified in 
the IFU but no shorter than five days pos
t-surgery, not inclusive of other 
negative pressure wound therapy devic
es or dressings for the duration 
of the study. Subjects will be regula
rly evaluated for SSCs through 90 
days after the TKA revision.  
PRIMARY 
ENDPOINT: 
The primary endpoint is the subject 
incidence of Investigator-assessed 
surgical site complications 
within [ADDRESS_919371]-18       
Page 3 of 72 
SECONDARY 
ENDPOINTS: 
The two secondary endpoints for this
 study are the 90-day subject 
incidence of Investigator-assessed surg
ical site infection (superficial or 
deep) and the 90-day subject incidence of Investigator-assessed deep 
surgical site infection. 
SAFETY 
ENDPOINT: 
The safety endpoint is the subjec
t incidence of adverse events. 
NUMBER OF 
SUBJECTS  
PLANNED and 
DURATION OF 
PARTICIPATIO
N: 
The study will randomize approx
imately 440 subjects from 
approximately 15 sites in a 1:[ADDRESS_919372] is as follows:

revision (Day 0)
o
TKA revision
o
Treatment Period: According 
to the IFU document included
with the selected dressing but
 no shorter than five days
post-surgery.
o
Post Operation and Follow-
up: through [ADDRESS_919373] is 134 days.
 
NUMBER OF 
STUDY SITES: 
It is anticipated that approximately 
15 study sites in North America will 
participate and each site will random
ize and treat subjects in both 
treatment groups.

STUDY 
EVALUATION/
VISIT 
SCHEDULE: 
Subjects will be seen during Screening (no more than 30 days before 
TKA revision), at the TKA revision, at
 the weekly study treatment visits 
(a minimum of 5 days to a maximu
m number of days indicated in the 
Instruction for Use document for t
he selected dressing), the Midterm 
Follow-up visit (day 30 to 45), the 
Long Term Follow-up visit (day 90 to 
104), or as initiated by [CONTACT_679551] 
(Unscheduled). All subjects will be followed for 90 days for outcomes 
regardless of the tr
eatment received. 
SAMPLE SIZE 
AND 
STATISTICAL 
METHODOLO
GY: 
The incidence rates of SSC are different for septic and aseptic revisions; 
the assumed SSC rate is 33% for 
septic and 6.9% for aseptic. This 
study plans to enroll at least 50% 
septic revisions overall. These 
enrollment rates lead to an assumed pooled SSC rate of 20% in the 
standard of care dressing arm.  
Assuming an overall type [ADDRESS_919378] 80% power to detect a 
difference of 10% (50% reduction) 
in SSCs in the ciNPT arm with 199 
subjects in each treatm
ent arm, with one interi
m analysis at about 50% 
of the evaluable subjects for a total 
of [ADDRESS_919379]. With an estimated 5%
-10% loss, a non-binding interim 
analysis for superiority at approximat
ely 50% of the evaluable subjects 
using O’Brien-Fleming method fo
r monitoring boundaries, the planned 
sample size will be inflated for potentia
l loss of follow-up for a total of 
440 subjects.

1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Background Negative Pressure Wound Therapy 
Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) was 
first introduced for the treatment of acute 
and chronic open wounds more than [ADDRESS_919395] to wound healing, as 
evidenced by [CONTACT_679553]
d. NPWT is used in treating both open and closed wounds. 
Problems associated with wound 
healing frequently lead to in
fection, wound dehiscence, 
and additional procedures. 
Hyldig 
et al.
 performed a meta-analysis combining t
he results from ten randomized clinical 
trials (RCTs) which compared NPWT agai
nst standard post-operative dressings among 
[ADDRESS_919396] one of the following wound 
complications:  dehiscence, infect
ion, or seroma. Most trials 
included in the meta-analysis 
were published in a peer-reviewed journal, how
ever, three trials contributing 697 patients 
(64%), provided the results used in the 
meta-analysis via personal communication.  
While the results of the meta-analysis show
ed NPWT to be effective in reducing the risk 
of seroma formation (relative risk and 95% C
I: 0.48 [0.27,0.84]) and would infection (0.54 
[0.33,0.89]) compared to t
he standard dressings, the effe
ct on wound dehiscence did not 
reach statistical significance (0
.69 [0.47,1.01]). The results 
of this meta-analysis should 
be interpreted cautiously. Heterogeneity among 
the studies included in the meta-analysis 
prevents general conclusions or recommendati
ons across all closed surgical incisions. 
Also, the majority of the patient-data (64%) 
included in the meta-a
nalysis came from un-
published results communicated dire
ctly with the st
udy authors.  
In a multi-center, prospective RCT in pati
ents with high-risk lower extremity fractures 
(calcaneus, pi[INVESTIGATOR_44768], and tibial plateau) Stannard 
et al.
 showed a lower frequency of infection 
and dehiscence among fractures in patients random
ized to the NPWT group (14 [9.9%] 
and12 [8.5%]) compared to the fractures in 
patients randomized to
 the standard post-
operative dressing group (23 
[18.8%] and 20 [16.4%]).
2
 The study population consisted 
of 249 patients; [ADDRESS_919397] of care.  
In a prospective, single-center study of
 obese patients undergoing cardiac surgery via 
sternotomy, patients a
llocated to NPWT had a lower rate of infection (4%) than those 
treated with standard of care
 (16% p-value= 0.0266)
[ADDRESS_919398] of care. 
4;[ADDRESS_919399] led 
to the development 
of devices that 
simplify and provide options for the applic
ation of NPWT, such as ActiV.A.C.
® 
Therapy 
Unit in conjunction with the Prevena™ Peel
 & Place Dressing and the Prevena Plus™ 
Customizable™ Dressing for closed incisions. 
Closed incision negative pressure therapy 
(ciNPT) is now used as an adjunct therapy in 
all types of closed incisions, including 
incisions resulting from knee replacement surgery. 
1.2. Total Knee Arth
roplasty and Revision 
Replacement of a knee joint with a prosthesis
, or Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA), is an 
increasingly common surgical procedure in 
the [LOCATION_002]. In a study using the 
Nationwide Inpatient Sample, US Census dat
a, and National Health Expenditure data 
from [ADDRESS_919400] the 
growth trends for these proc
edures in the [LOCATION_002] 
(2014).
6
 As a large percentage of the populati
on ages, the number of these procedures 
is expected to increase.  
A TKA may fail for a variety of reasons causi
ng pain, swelling, stiffness, and instability. 
When a TKA fails, a second surgery (revision) 
may be performed, where some or all parts 
of the original prosthesis are replaced.
 The most common reas
ons for TKA revision 
include infection, aseptic loosening, instab
ility, mechanical complications, wear, and 
fracture. 
7-11
 The 2014 annual report from the Amer
ican Joint Replacement Registry 
(AJRR) considered TKA revisions for 6
39 patients and finds that infection and 
inflammatory reaction (27.2%) were the most
 frequently reported caus
es of TKA revision 
and that among revisions with complete data, 
43% occurred within [ADDRESS_919401] primary 
TKA. Although the revision has the same goal
 as the primary TKA – to relieve pain and 
improve function – revision surgery is long
er and more complex, requires extensive 
planning, and requires the us
e of specialized implants and 
tools to achieve the desired 
result.  
Among patients undergoing orthopedic 
surgeries, including TKA and revisions, published 
literature shows that pat
ients with multiple co-morbidities,
 such as obesity, diabetes, 
dyspnea, hypertension, and smok
ing are at an even higher risk 
for infections than patients 
without co-morbidities.
11-13
 Infections can cause prolo
nged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], can create 
significant burden on the healthcare system, and c
an result in substantial morbidity and 
quality of life (QoL) deterioration for the patient. 
14
 
A reduction in the occurrence 
of these negative and costly out
comes by [CONTACT_679554] (ciNPT) would hav
e a significant benefit for TKA revision 
patients.

1.3. Review of Medical Li
terature – ciNPT  in TKA 
A retrospective study of revision TKAs and 
total hip arthroplasties (THAs) with 138 
patients (30 treated with ciNPT and 108 patient
s with antimicrobial 
dressings) undergoing 
procedures by a single surgeon, found that 
patients treated with ciNPT developed fewer 
overall wound complications (6.7% vs. 26.9%) 
and fewer surgical site infections (3.3% 
vs. 18.5%) as compared to patients whose 
wounds were treated using antimicrobial 
dressings.
15
   
The authors concluded that ciNP
T decreases the incidence of surgical site complications 
– including dehiscence, suture granuloma,
 prolonged drainage, and surgical site 
infections – and may have the potential to lower the need for another reoperation in this 
population of TKA and TH
A revision patients. 
1.4. Conclusion 
Surgical Site Complications (SSCs) aris
ing from aseptic and septic TKA revisions, 
particularly surgical site infection, are well 
documented in the literat
ure, with patient co-
morbidities further impacting the rate of 
SSCs. The use of ciNPT has been shown to 
reduce complication rates related to closed surgic
al incisions in a variety of indications. 
An interest in exploring the benefits of ciNP
T in orthopedic closed incisions is growing, 
such as impact on deep infection and dehisc
ence. There is a need for higher level 
evidence from a large, randomized, well-co
ntrolled study. This study will assess how 
ciNPT impacts the rate of
 SSCs and the components in patients undergoing TKA revision 
after primary TKA compared to the rate of co
mplication associated with standard of care 
surgical wound dressings. 
1.5. Study Products 
The following devices and dressings
 will provide the ciNPT system
 used for this study in 
comparison to standard of care (SOC) surgic
al dressings. The system consists of any

 that has been surgically closed with sutures 
or staples. 
1.5.1. Regulatory status 
The Prevena Plus™ Incision Management System
 was cleared by [CONTACT_679555] a 510(k) clearance affirming that the system 
is substantially equivalent in terms of 
indication and technology to the predicate
 device, the Prevena™ Incision Management 
System. The system’s indications, contra
indication, warnings, precautions, and 
instructions for use can be found in t

 System is int
ended to manage the 
environment for surgical incisions that cont
inue to drain following sutured or stapled 
closure by [CONTACT_117354] a closed environment and removing exudate via the application of 
negative pressure wound therapy.  
1.5.2. Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Units 
The Therapy Unit creates a negative pressure va
cuum of the closed surgical incision and 
causes exudate to be pumped into
 a collection canister attached to the unit. The Therapy 
Units described in this section were des
igned to be used in conjunction with any 
Prevena
TM 
Dressings used in this study immediatel
y after the dressing is applied to the 
subject’s closed incision. 
Both Therapy Units are lightwe
ight, portable, electric and battery-powered devices that 
the surgeon will attach to the dressing immediat
ely after it is applied to the subject’s 
closed incision. Subjects will maintain the T
herapy Unit after being discharged from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The unit will be programmed to deliv
er continuous 125 mmHg negative pressure 
for the duration of t
he ciNPT treatment.

pregnancy status in female subjects of 
child-bearing potential will be 
conducted during screening and prio
r to surgery, if the 
screening visit and the TKA revision occur on di
fferent days. If the subject’s pregnancy 
test is positive, she will not be eligible for 
randomization, will discont
inue from the study, 
and will be considered a screen failure. 
4.9. Randomization a
nd Subject Numbering 
Subjects who sign an informed consent will be 
assigned a unique subject identifier. The 
identifier will be unique to the subject. Study dat
a will be reported according to this unique 
subject identifier. 
Subjects who satisfy all inclus
ion criteria and none of
 the exclusion criteria will be eligible 
for randomization which will occur in the operati
ng room after the TKA revision procedure 
has been completed and the surgical incision
 has been closed. Randomization to study 
treatment will be centralized, 
electronic, and web-based. 
Subjects will be randomized in 
a 1:1 ratio (ciNPT vs. SOC) stra
tified by [CONTACT_679567] (s
eptic vs. aseptic). For details, 
see section 8.4.3.   
If a screened subject does not meet
 inclusion criteria or meet
s any exclusion criteria, the 
subject will not be randomized and wil
l be considered a screen failure.

for use included with the product. Total treat
ment time should no
t exceed the maximum 
number days indicated in the IFU 
document included with the Prevena
TM 
Dressing applied 
immediately follo

For the delivery of negative pressure, an ActiV.A.C.
® 
or Prevena Plus
TM
 125 Therapy Unit 
will be attached to the dressing tubing and ciNP
T will be initiated in the operating room. 
The ActiV.A.C.

Unit must be set to 
125mmHg of continuous n
egative pressure. If the 
dressing leaks and a seal cannot 
be maintained, replacement of 
the initial ciNPT dressing 
is acceptable and wi

The Investigator will 
evaluate the subject for all co
mplications at each visit, regar
dless if the subject has a 
documented SSC event.  
For all SSC events, the date of onset will be
 recorded. Not all reported adverse events 
that are surgical complications will 
meet the criteria 
for an SSC event.  
Subjects with a documented SSC event will c
ontinue to be assessed through the Long

3. Full thickness skin dehiscence, defined as a 
separation of the closed incision at least 
through the subcutaneous tissue or
 deeper and at least one mm wide. 
4. Seroma or hematoma requiring drainage or 
surgery. The fluid accumulation will be 
classified as hematoma (bloody fluid) or sero
ma (clear or serous fluid) after drainage. 
The drainage may be percutaneous, an open te
chnique at the bedside, or open 
surgical drainage. 
5. Skin necrosis is defined as the presence of
 necrotic tissue/skin eschar at the incision 
site that requires intervention with antib
iotics, excision, and/or re-operation.

Specifically, the following do not
 qualify as criteria for meet
ing the National Healthcare 
Safety Network (NHSN) definition: 
o
 Diagnosis/treatment of cellulitis (redne
ss/warmth/swelling), by [CONTACT_5071], does 
not meet the last criterion for super
ficial incisional SSI. Conversely, an 
incision that is draining 
or that has organisms ident
ified by [CONTACT_679570]-
culture based testing is not considered a cellulitis. 
o
 A stitch abscess alone (minimal infla
mmation and discharge confined to the 
points of suture penetration). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Special Reporting Instru
ctions for Continued Drainage  
It is typi[INVESTIGATOR_21885] a closed incision to drain up
 to 72 hours after surgery. However, if the 
closed incision continues to drain at the time 
of dressing removal (> 
5 days) as determined

hours. Subjects will answer these questions prio
r to the TKA revision, at the earlier of 
discharge or 24 hours (± 2 hours) after the 
TKA revision, and at the weekly study 
treatment visits. Subjects will document whet
her they completed the assessment before 
or after consultation with the Investigator. At 
the weekly study treatm
ent visits, the subject 
will record whether the pain assessment wa
s performed before or after the dressing 
removal.  
4.13. Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) Assessments 
4.13.1. Knee Injury and Osteoart
hritis Outcome Score (KOOS)  
The KOOS is a 42-item disease-specific
 patient reported out
come (PRO) measure 
designed to assess short-term and long-te
rm symptoms and function in subjects with 
knee injury and osteoarthritis. The KOOS
 has been validated for several orthopaedic 
interventions including total knee replacement.

 The KOOS consists of five subscales: 

 Knee-related Quality of Life,  

 Function in Sport and Recreation,  

 Function in Daily Living,  

 Pain, and  

 Other Symptoms. 
Intended for use over short-term
 or long-term intervals to 
assess changes from visit to 
visit, subjects will be asked to complete t
he KOOS questionnaire on their own at the 
Screening, weekly study treatment visits
, Midterm Follow-up, and the Long Term Follow-
up visits.  
Subjects will record whether they completed t

7. SAFETY AND 
ADVERSE EVENTS 
7.1. Definitions 
7.1.1. Adverse Event (AE) 
Any untoward medical occurrenc
e, unintended disease or inju
ry, or untoward clinical 
signs (including clinically si
gnificant abnormal laboratory findi
ngs) in subjects, users or 
other persons, whether or not related to
 the investigational medical device. 
7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An AE is considered serious if it resu
lts in any of the 
following outcomes:  
o
 Death; 
o
 Life-threatening; 
o
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (ini
tial or prolonged);  
o
 Persistent or significant incapacity or 
substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions 
o
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
o
 Required intervention to prevent 
permanent impairment or damage  
o
 Other important medical events ma
y be considered serious when, based 
upon appropriate medical j
udgment, they may jeopar
dize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical interv
ention to prevent on
e of the outcomes 
listed in this definition. 
Any planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] 
a pre-existing condition, or
 a procedure r
equired by [CONTACT_12695], without serious deterioration in
 health, is not considered an SAE.

7.2. Classification 
7.3. Relationship to Study Treatment 
The Investigator will assess t
he relationship of the AE as: 
o
Related 
to the study product:  any adver
se event for which there is a
reasonable possibility that the study
 product caused the adverse event.
o
Not Related 
to the study product:  when is 
determined that there is no
relationship between the adverse event
 and the use of the study product.
7.4. Severity 
The study investigator will assign severity as follows: 
o
Mild
; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; c
linical or diagnostic observations
only; no intervention indicated
o
Moderate
; minimal, local or non-invasi
ve intervention indicated;
o
Severe
 or medically significant but not
 immediately life- threatening;
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_679547]; disabling;
7.5. Expectedness 
All SAEs will be classified 
for expectedness by [CONTACT_679574]:

of incidence in the study 
or product documentation. 
The Sponsor will provide the Inve
stigator with the classificati
on of the event based on the 
information reported by [CONTACT_185385].   
7.6. AE Reporting Procedures 
The Investigator is responsible for monitoring 
the safety of all subjects enrolled in the 
study, and reporting AEs as descr
ibed in this protocol.   
7.7. AE Collection/Reporting Period 
The AE collection/reporting per
iod will begin after the 
subject has been randomized. 
Investigators should assess for AEs at each vi
sit. In addition, study subjects should be 
instructed to report any AE that they 
experience to the Investigator.    
All AEs, regardless of perceived relation
ship to study product, will be reported and 
recorded on the appropriate CRFs in a timely
 manner. In addition, the worsening of a 
medical condition previously reported in the 
medical history should also be recorded as 
an AE.  
The reporting of all AEs is to continue for t
he duration of the study 
or until the patient 
receives an alternative therapy, whichever occurs first. Any SAE that occurs after 
treatment with alternativ
e therapy is to be reported only 
if the Investigator or treating 
physician assesses the SAE as rela
ted to the study treatment. 
The AE description will include t
he nature of the exper
ience (AE term), th
e start date, the 
end date, the severity of each sign or sy

8. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
8.1. Endpoint Definitions for Analysis 
8.1.1. Primary Endpoint 
– Subject Incidence SSC 
The primary endpoint is the incidence of surgic
al site complications (SSCs) within [ADDRESS_919451] of care surgical 
dressing. The SSC endpoint includes any o
ccurrence of superficial SSI, deep SSI, 
dehiscence, seroma, hematoma,
 skin necrosis, or conti
nued drainage as outlined in 
section 4.11.1. For this endpoint t
here are three possible outcomes: 
o
 “Occurred”, which is assigned if the 
subject had one or more occurrences 
of any complication and the onset dat
e of the complication was between the 
time of the TKA revision and 
not later than 90 days after; 
o
 “No occurrences”, which is assigned if the subject had no known 
occurrences of a complication within
 [ADDRESS_919452] once on or after the 90
th
 day following the TKA revision; 
o
 “Incomplete follow-up”, 
which is assigned if the 
subject had no occurrences 
of the complication within [ADDRESS_919453] experiences one occurrence of any
 of the six complic
ations, the primary 
outcome will be considered “Occurred”.  
For each component of the SSC, 
the start date of the comp
lication will be recorded in 
order to calculate the 
number of days from the revision 
surgery until occurrence of the 
event. If the complication did not occur, the 
number of days will be calculated using the 
last assessment which confirmed the 
subject to be comp
lication-free.  
8.1.2. Secondary Endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Subject Incidence SSI 
This secondary endpoint is t
he incidence of any SSI (superfi
cial or deep) within [ADDRESS_919454]-18       
Page 55 of 72 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Subject Incidence Deep SSI 
This secondary endpoint is t
he incidence of deep SSI within 90
 days of TKA revision in 
subjects treated with ciNPT as compared to 
SOC dressing. Deep SSI
 is a component of 
the primary endpoint and specific 
instructions for ascertainm
ent are described in section 
4.11.1. Subjects will be categor
ized using methods similar to those described in section 
8.1.1. 
8.1.3. Exploratory Endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pain Assessment 
The pain assessment consists 
of two self-administered que
stions used to evaluate the 
severity of a subject’s pain in the past 24 hour
s. Both questions are measured from 0 (no 
pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine).   
Subjects will respond using t
he integer value. Subjects w
ho have withdrawn prior to the 
scheduled assessments will be categor
ized as “Discontinued study prior to assessment”; 
otherwise subjects who do not have an assessment
 recorded at a particular visit will be 
summarized as “Assessment not done”.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Knee Injury and Osteoarthrit
is Outcome Subscale Score (KOOS) 
The KOOS instrument is a pat
ient-reported questionnaire to 
assess short-term and long-
term symptoms and functions.  
The KOOS consists of 42 items asked on a 
5-point Likert scale. The items will be 
converted to numeric values and summariz
ed into five domain scores: Knee-Related 
Quality of Life, Function in Sport and Recreati
on, Function in Daily Living, Pain, and Other 
Symptoms. The subscales are scored separ
ately and interpreted separately. Each 
subscale score will be normalized from 0 (e
xtreme symptoms) to 
100 (no symptoms).  
All efforts will be made to ensure the subjects
 complete the entire assessment at each 
scheduled visit. Each subscale will be scored us
ing the most recent KOOS Users Guide 
and Scoring Instruction manuals which out
line methods for imputing missing data.
18;19
  
 For the subscale scores, four possi
ble outcomes will be summarized and listed: 
o
Normalized numeric subscale score;
o
Assessment done but incomplete (suffici
ent number of items not complete);
o
Discontinued study prior to assessment;
o
Assessment not done

8.2. Analysis Sets 
The following analysis sets will be used: 
o
ITT Analysis Set – The ITT (intention-to
-treat) Analysis Set will consist of all
randomized subjects. Subj
ects will be analyzed according to the treatment
allocated at randomization.
o
Safety Analysis Set – The Safety Analysis Set will consist of all randomized
subjects who received any study-related treatment procedures. It is
expected that all randomized subjects 
will be treated. All safety results will
be presented based on the Safety Analysis Set. Subjects will be analyzed
according to the study treatment t
hey received immediately following the
TKA revision.
o
Modified ITT (mITT) Analysis Set – This 
set will include subjects in the ITT
Analysis Set with the following: 1) an SSC on or before [ADDRESS_919460]-TKA
revision or 2) no known occurrence of an SSC within [ADDRESS_919461] once on or after the 90
th
 day following
the TKA revision. Subjects will be anal
yzed according to their randomized
treatment assignment.
o
Per-Protocol Analysis Set – This will 
include subjects in the mITT Analysis
Set and had no disqualifying protocol 
deviation(s) that would impact the
interpretation of the primary endpoint. The disqualifying protocol
deviation(s) for exclusion from this
 set will be defined and documented in a
blinded fashion prior to the final dat
abase lock by [CONTACT_679576]. Subjects will be analyzed according to their randomized
treatment assignment.
o
Modified Per-Protocol (mPP) Analysis Se
t – This will include subjects in the
Per-Protocol Analysis Set excluding any
 subjects that received prohibited
therapy as described in section 4.
15 or any subjects that received
alternative therapy following t
he study treatment period.
8.3. Planned Analysis and Data Summaries 
8.3.1. General Analysis Techniques 
In general, continuous variables will be summar
ized by [CONTACT_679577] (n), the 
mean, median, standard deviati
on, minimum, and maximum 
values. For categorical variables, the number and
 
percentage of subjects that are in each 
category will be provided. Unless otherwise s
pecified, the denominat
or for percentages 
will be all relevant subjects in
 a particular analysis, including those for whom data are not 
available, i.e., “not report
ed” or “not available” will g
enerally be considered a separate

category and included in the 
displays of data, with the 
denominator for percentages 
including these subjects. Subjects will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_679578] (e.g., 
ciNPT and SOC).   
8.3.2. Subject Disposition 
Summaries of disposition will be tabulat
ed by [CONTACT_1570]. The number and 
percentage of subjects in each analysis 
set will be described, as
 will the number (and 
percentage, if relevant
) of subjects who: 
o
 provided informed consent; 
o
 failed screening, and reas
on for failing screening; 
o
 were randomized; 
o
 were randomized and treated; 
o
 discontinued early from the study fo
r any reason, along with the reason for 
discontinuation (if the r
eason is adverse event, the system organ class and 
preferred term); and 
o
 completed the study as planned.  
Subject disposition also will be descri
bed in a flowchart (CONSORT diagram
22
).
 
8.3.3. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic characteristics (
age, sex, race, and ethnicity), baseline characteristics, and 
other disease characteristics,
 will be summarized according to the general techniques in 
section 8.3.1. Subjects in t
he Safety, ITT, mITT, Per-Proto
col, and/or mPP Analysis Sets 
will be summarized within each 
treatment group and overall. 
 
8.3.4. Analysis of
 Primary Endpoint 
The analyses described in this section will 
be performed for the overall primary endpoint, 
“Any Surgical Site Complication (SSC)”, wit
hin 90 days of TKA revision, and repeated for 
each type of complication. 
The proportion of subjects with each possible 
result – “Occurred”, “N
o occurrences”, or 
“Incomplete follow-up” will be r
eported, using the mITT Analys
is Set as the denominator. 
See section 8.1.1 for definit
ions of these outcomes. 
The comparative analysis of the 
primary endpoint will only cons
ider subjects in the mITT 
Analysis Set, i.e., subjects with “Incomplet
e Follow-up” will be excl
uded. The proportions 
KCI
An
Acelity
Company
KCI.PREVENA.2017.[ADDRESS_919463]-18       
Page 59 of 72 
of subjects with “Occurred”
 will be calculated within each 
treatment group and compared 
between treatment arms using a Cochran-Mant
el-Haenszel (CMH) p-
value stratified for 
type of revision (aseptic vs. septic). Th
e difference between t
he proportions (ciNPT – 
SOC) and asymptotic 95% conf
idence interval will be comput
ed. At the final analysis, a 
two-sided significance level adjusted for t
he interim efficacy analyses and potential 
sample size recalculation (e.g., 
α
 = 0.048 if interim look is at 
t
=0.50 and no sample size 
adjustment is made) will be used to com
pare the SSC proportions between the two 
treatment arms. 
Supportive/exploratory analyses of the pr
imary efficacy endpoint, SSC, may include: 
o
analyses comparing the treatment 
groups for the septic and aseptic
revisions;
o
analyses comparing the treatment gr
oups for age, BMI, 
race/ethnicity,
material used in the revision, and sex subgroups;
o
analyses comparing the heterogeneity 
of the treatment groups across
clinical sites;
o
multivariable analyses comparing t
he treatment groups with covariate
adjustment where possible covariates 
might include (but not limited to) age,
BMI, sex, type of revision (aseptic or
 septic), and subject co-morbidities;
o
Fisher’s exact test present
ing the unstratified p-value;
o
A repeat of any analysis above using t
he Per-Protocol and/or mPP Analysis
Sets;
and other exploratory anal
yses as deemed appropriate. 
8.3.5. Analysis of 
Secondary Endpoints 
Any SSI (superficial or deep) and Deep SSI 
will be analyzed in a similar fashion as the 
primary endpoint described in se
ction 8.3.4. Superficial and 
Deep SSI will be analyzed 
separately and jointly; individual infection components will be summarized descriptively.  
8.3.6. Exploratory Endpoints 
In general, analyses will be performed on subjects
 in the ITT and/or mPP Analysis Sets 
using methods outlined in section 8.3.1. T
he number of subjects 
in each treatment arm 
at each scheduled visit with adequate assessment
s will be summarized for each visit. 
Assessments performed outside the scheduled visit windows may not be included in the 
models but will be listed separately. The patte
rns of missing data will be presented using 
KCI
An
Acelity
Company
 
 
  
KCI.PREVENA.2017.[ADDRESS_919464] errors or deviati
ons will be presented to provide a measure 
of variability. Complete details for all endpoint
s will be outlined in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan. 
8.3.7. Analysis of Safety Endpoint 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_2939]. For 
each coded medical term, t
he proportion of subjects w
ho experience at least one 
treatment-emergent: 
o
 adverse event(s); 
o
 adverse event(s) related to treatment; 
o
 serious adverse event(s); 
o
 serious adverse event(s) related to treatment; 
o
 adverse event(s) leading to treat
ment/study discontinuation; or 
o
 serious adverse event(s) leading to treatment/study discontinuation 
will be reported. Subject incidence of TEAEs by
 [CONTACT_926] (mild, moderate, severe) will also 
be presented. Events will be r
eported by [CONTACT_679579]. 
A listing of death(s), subjects who died of
 any cause during study, will be presented. 
8.4. Additional Statistical Details 
8.4.1. Hypothesis 
This study will assess whether closed incision
 negative pressure therapy (ciNPT) reduces 
the surgical site complications (SSCs) 
compared to standard of care (SOC) among 
subjects who undergo a total knee arthroplasty
 (TKA) revision. The primary endpoint is 
measured by [CONTACT_679580] 90 days of TKA revision among 
subjects in the mITT Analysis Set; the corre
sponding null and alternat
ive hypotheses are: 
Null:   
∆
ciNPT-SOC
 = 0
 
   Alternative:   
∆
ciNPT-SOC
 
≠
 [ADDRESS_919465]-18       
Page 61 of 72 
where 
∆
ciNPT-SOC
 is the difference in the proportion 
of subjects in the ciNPT group 
population with at least one SSC – proportion of subjects in 
the SOC dressing group with 
at least one SSC.
8.4.2. Sample Size Determination 
The primary endpoint of this study
 is the subject incidence of
 SSC as defined in section 
4.11.1. The incidenc
e rates of SSC are differ
ent for septic and aseptic revisions; the 
assumed SSC rate is 33% for septic and 6.9% 
for aseptic. This study plans to enroll at 
least 50% septic revisions overall. Thes
e enrollment rates lead to an assumed pooled 
SSC rate of 20% in the SOC dressing arm.  
Assuming an overall type [ADDRESS_919466] 80% power to detect a differ
ence of 10% (50% reduction) in SSCs in the 
ciNPT arm with 199 subjects in each treatment
 arm, with one interim analysis at about 
50% of the evaluable subjects for a total of 
[ADDRESS_919467]. 
With an estimated 5%-10% loss, a non-bi
nding interim analysis for superiority at 
approximately 50% of the ev
aluable subjects using O’
Brien-Fleming method for 
monitoring boundaries, the planned sample size 
will be inflated for pot
ential loss of follow-
up for a total of 440 subjects.
 
8.4.3. Randomization 
Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria 
will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to either the ciNP
T or SOC dressing treatment 
arm. The randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_679581]
 (septic versus aseptic).   
For each stratum, a randomization schedul
e including randomization numbers and 
treatment assignments will be 
generated and maintained centrally in the web-based 
clinical database management syst
em. Once randomized, a subj
ect’s assignment cannot 
be altered or changed; a subject should not be randomized twice.  
8.4.4. Open-Label Study Reporting Results  
In order to reduce operational bias that 
can be introduced during the analysis, while the 
study is ongoing summary statisti
cs by [CONTACT_679582] 
a small analytical group at t
he Sponsor not involved in the 
daily operations of the study. 
Treatment groups will be 
masked in the summary outputs (tables, listings, and figures) in 
order to reduce the inference should results be inadvertently accessed. The limited results 
of the interim analysis will be shared with Invest
igators and IRBs as necessary to conduct 
the study.  
Upon study completion, the full results will be 
shared with all invest
igators and clinical 
sites.

8.4.5. Interim Analysis 
An interim analysis may be conducted at information-time 
t
=0.5, i.e., when approximately 
half the planned study subjects [n=200] hav
e had their primary endpoint assessed. The 
interim analysis will be performed at the 
α
=0.0052 level; if the p-
value for the primary 
endpoint is < 0.0052, the study
 will be stopped and null hypothes
is rejected. Otherwise, 
the final analysis will be conducted at 
α
=0.048 (i.e., by [CONTACT_2164] a 95.2% confidence 
interval) to preserve overall Ty
pe I error rate at 5%. These 
α
 values were chosen using 
an O’Brien-Fleming 
α
-spending function assuming 
t
 = 0.5. The alpha levels that will be 
used at the interim and final 
will be calculated according the precise information time at 
the interim analysis.   
If warranted, based on the unblinded interim re
sults, the final sample size may be 
increased using appropriate statisti
cal methodology as described in Chen.
23
 The increase 
to the final sample size would only occur 
if the interim results 
had conditional power of 
success 
≥
 50%, would be subject to t
he restrictions in Chen, and would not be considered 
statistically binding.  
At the interim analysis, the ra
te of SSC for septic and as
eptic revisions will be examined 
to confirm assumptions of t
he sample size calculations.
24
 In addition, the rate of SSC will 
be independently assessed for s
eptic and aseptic revisions at the interim analysis to 
determine if a modification of enr
ollment from a 1:1 ratio of 
septic:aseptic revisions to 
focus on enrollment for either revision type 
is needed. This type of
 adaptive enrichment 
design will be further detailed in t
he interim statistical analysis plan.
[ADDRESS_919469]
ans and Changes in Analyses 
Statistical Analysis Plans (SAPs) containing 
full details of the statistical analyses and 
execution will be prepared for both the interim analysis and the final analysis. The interim 
SAP (iSAP) will be finalized prior to conducting 
interim analysis. The final SAP (fSAP) will 
be finalized prior to locking the study databa
se and the final analysis. Any changes from 
the planned analyses in this protocol, the 
iSAP, and/or the fSAP will be noted in the

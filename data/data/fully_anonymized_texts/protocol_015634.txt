TRACTOR Migraine Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] – Protocol version 10. 4 dated 11/20/[ADDRESS_935821]:  
 
We recently demonstrated a dramatic reduction/elimination of migraine symptoms in 13 of 
15 patients with right to left shunt treated with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (off -label, unblinded) for one 
month.   We have treated an additional [ADDRESS_935822] proven to be 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] “resistant”.  Common genetic differences of the CYP2C19 enzymes preclude both 
the break down of the clopi[INVESTIGATOR_689858] -drug to its 
active metabolite.  PRU blood testing while taking clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (Platelet Reactivity Testing) in some of the headache -non-responders has proven a failure to inhibit platelet reac tivity.  
 In some of these non -responders, we tried prasugrel, another thienopyridine which is 
metabolized differently than clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745].  Four of five prasugrel patients had a 
reduction/elimination of headache symptoms similar to that seen in the initial clopi[INVESTIGATOR_689859], with PRU -proven platelet inhibition, confirming an unspecified role of P2Y12 
inhibition.    
Brilinta/ticagrelor , a newer P2Y12 inhibitor, is not a thienopyridine and is therefore 
metabolized independently of the CYP2C19 pathway.  Bec ause Brilinta/ticagrelor  has a 
lower reported bleeding risk than prasugrel, we are preparing a multi- center, randomized, 
blinded trial with Brilinta/ticagrelor  for refractory migraineurs.  However, before investing 
in this large trial, we must ensure that Brilinta/ticagrelor’s P2Y12 inhibition has a similar 
headache effect to that of the thienopyridines.  For that reason, we propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_689860]/ticagrelor in [ADDRESS_935823] refractory chronic migraine, according to 
International Headache definitions.  
   
STUDY PURPOSE AND RATIONALE:  
 
More than 40 million Americans > 12 years of age suffer with migraine headache (MHA).1 
Current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_689861].  In the subset of MHA patients with preceding aura (MHA+), 40% have 
a patent foramen ovale (PFO), an open flap in the atrial septum that allows right to left 
shunting (RLS).2,[ADDRESS_935824] which MHA patient will be nefit 
(demonstrated in the MIST Trial12), there is yet no justification for PFO closure as a 
therapeutic option for MHA. 
 
TRACTOR Migraine Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] – Protocol version 10. 4 dated 11/20/[ADDRESS_935825] current theories involve a central role of activated platelets, which contribute to 
paradoxical embolization of micro- clots or platelet- released vasoactive substances.13  
 Recently, we demonstrated a dra matic reduction or elimination of migraine headache 
symptoms in 13/15 severe migraineurs, with RLS, using clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (a P2Y12 thienopyridine platelet inhibitor).
 14   In subsequent clinical (off -label) use of the drug, we 
have seen efficacy in over 70% of patients.  A large, multicenter randomized clinical trial is 
planned and will be required to prove that this effect is reproducible, and not the result of a 
placebo effect.  
 One difficulty in using clopi[INVESTIGATOR_689862] a randomized trial, is the nearly 25% incidence 
of patients who are unable to metabolize clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745].  This is due to genetic polymorphisms 
in the Cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are required to break down clopi[INVESTIGATOR_689863] -
drug to its active metabolite.
15   Some of our MHA non -responders had normal platelet 
function while taking clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], proven with platelet reactivity testing (VerifyNow PRU Test – Accumetrics Inc.  San Diego, CA)).    
 Five of these patients were subsequently treated with prasugrel (another P2Y12 
thienopyridine platelet inhibitor, metabolized via a different pathway than clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]) 
with complete elimination of headache symptoms in four (unpublished data).  While 
prasugrel is also used frequently in patients with coronary artery disease who are 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_689864], it has a higher risk of bleeding complications, which makes it less 
attractive for a headache study.
16   
 
Brilinta/ticagrelor is a third P2Y12 inhibiting agent, which is not a thienopyridine drug and 
does not require in vivo metabolism to be active.17 We are currently in the process of 
establishing a multi -center, randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled, cross -over 
trial (The TRACTOR Migraine Trial) using Brilinta/ticagrelor , to establish the principle that 
P2Y12 inhibition will treat headaches in pa tients with RLS.  However, we have yet to treat 
any migraine patients with this drug.  Therefore, before undertaking this large study, our 
goal is to provide evidence that P2Y12 inhibition with a non -thienopyridine agent will yield 
the same headache relief.   
 
BACKGROUND: 
 
In 2000, in a seminal paper, Wilmshurst et al.
4 reported unanticipated improvement or 
elimination of MHA symptoms after transcatheter device closure of an atrial communication (PFO or atrial septal defect) in a group of divers who had pre viously suffered 
decompression illness
 and/or stroke.   Subsequent worldwide observational (retrospective) 
studies reported significant improvement or elimination of migraine symptoms in at least 
70% of patients who had had a PFO closed for prevention of r ecurrent embolic stroke4-11.   
 At that time it was proposed that the RLS, common to all of these patients, was in some way triggering the headaches.   This tied in nicely to observations of increased migraine 
prevalence in patients with cyanotic congenita l heart disease
18, [ADDRESS_935826] chronic RLS 
due to congenital malformations or to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) 
TRACTOR Migraine Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] – Protocol version 10. 4 dated 11/20/[ADDRESS_935827] was a double blinded, rand omized, sham -controlled study of PFO closure in 147 
patients with severe epi[INVESTIGATOR_689865]+ and a documented PFO with moderate or large RLS.  
MHA - patients, those with chronic daily migraine and those with a history of stroke, were 
excluded.  The results of thi s controversial study ultimately showed no benefit to PFO 
closure, casting uncertainty on the causative role of the PFO.  
 Wilmshurst et al.
21, noted an increased frequency of MHA+ symptoms in the first few weeks 
after PFO closure.  This effect was mitigated by [CONTACT_689895][INVESTIGATOR_8278].  The development of MHA after PFO closure in patients with no prior history of 
headache, and the elimination of those symptoms with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], strongly suggested a 
mechanistic role for platelet activation in the pathogenesis of MHA in some patients.  The 
authors speculated that the observed benefit of using clopi[INVESTIGATOR_689866]’s blockade of ADP binding to its platelet surface receptor (P2Y12), a mechanism 
different from that of asp irin.   
 Nozari et al.
13, studied the impact of cerebral microembolization in mice, using PET scan 
imaging to demonstrate cortical- spreading depression (CSD), after carotid artery injections 
of air and particulate matter.  CSD has been strongly linked to sy mptoms of MHA+ in 
humans22-24.   Their work clearly demonstrated the potential of cerebral microembolization, 
from a right to left shunt, to trigger migraine without causing stroke.   
 A group from the Netherlands noted that there was an improvement of migraine symptoms, 
and a reduction in rescue medication use on warfarin,
 25, 26  but there has been no further 
investigation of this relationship since 2004.27    
 
We formulated our study hypothesis, in part, based upon our experience with a handful of 
stroke patients treated with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], due to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_79948].  Several returned 
reporting reduction/elimination of migraine symptoms.   
 As a result, [ADDRESS_935828] been able to decrease or eliminate other migraine prophylactic agents 
(i.e. topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]).  Four responders have continued on clopi[INVESTIGATOR_689867], while the other [ADDRESS_935829] statistical significance of the results/adverse events, and a placebo effect could not be ruled out.  A s discussed above, 
headache elimination was seen in four of five patients on prasugrel who were unresponsive to clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], and proven by [CONTACT_689896]/utilize the clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745].    
 
 
 
  
TRACTOR Migraine Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] – Protocol version 10. 4 dated 11/20/2015  
 5 STUDY DESIGN AND STATISTICAL PROCEDURES: 
 
We propose a prospective, open- label, single -arm  pi[INVESTIGATOR_689868] 40 subjec ts to assess 
the hypothesis that P2Y12 inhibition with Brilinta/ticagrelor  (90 mg PO twice a day) 
reduces epi[INVESTIGATOR_619154]/or chronic migraine  headache symptoms in patients with right t o left 
shunt.   There will be no randomization or blinding of therapy.  The study drug will be 
provided, free of charge, by [CONTACT_24352], Astra -Zeneca.  All subjec ts will be treated 
with the same medical regimen, and will be treated at Columbia Univer sity Medical Center  
or one of Principal Investigators external offices.  All subjec ts will have an initial visit that 
will include the completion of a screening questionnaire (inclusion/exclusion criteria), informed consent, transcranial Doppler screening, laboratory blood testing  by [CONTACT_48571] 
(approximately 15 cc of blood = 1 tablespoon) , and instruction on the use of the daily 
headache log  (see Appendix 1, Appendix 2).  Over the next 28 days, the subjects will receive 
an e -mail/text reminder daily with a link to complete the headache log (see below).  A t a 
second study visit, following completion of the first baseline month, the study staff will 
review the subject’s headache log material, will release those subjects with insufficient 
headache days in the screening month, will assign  the remaining/eligible subjec ts to either 
the epi[INVESTIGATOR_689869], will distribute  the study drug, will administ er the 
Brilinta/ticagrelor loading dose, and will review the medication’s proper use.  After 7 days 
of treatment with Brilinta/ticagrelor, while still on therapy, subjec ts will be sent for 
additional laboratory testing (PRU test  < 10 cc of blood by [CONTACT_48571] ).  At the completion 
of the 28 days  (+7 days)  on Brilinta/ticagrelor, each subjec t will have  a follow -up study visit  
within [ADDRESS_935830] study visit, headache logs will 
be reviewed with the study staff, results will be discussed, remaining medications and 
empty bottles will be returned, and adverse events  will be reviewed.  Headache frequency 
while on Brilinta/ticagrelor will be compared with the documented baseline for each subject.  If the Brilinta/ticagrelor therapy was effective  (> 50% reduction in monthly 
headache days), the subject could elect to con tinue therapy for an additional two months , 
while continuing to complete daily h eadache logs .  
 Data collected from  these [ADDRESS_935831] s will be evaluated to assess the feasibility of 
conducting a randomized, placebo -controlled, doubl e blinded study in this p opulation.    
  
TRACTOR Migraine Trial Definitions  
 
Headache Definitions :  
(From: the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD -II) 
http://www.ihs -classification.org/en/)  
 
• Migraine without aura:  Requires all of the following symptoms: a) recurrent 
headaches (at least 5 lifetime attacks); b) untreated or unsuccessfully treated headache duration of 4 to 72  h; and c) at least two of the following pain 
characteristics: unilateral, pulsating, moderate or severe intensity, or aggravated by [CONTACT_59549] p hysical activity. In addition, the migraine attacks are associated with at 
least one of nausea/vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia. Finally, other causes of headache must be excluded.   
 
• Migraine with aura:  Recurrent disorder manifesting in attacks of r eversible focal 
neurological symptoms that usually develop gradually over 5- [ADDRESS_935832] 
TRACTOR Migraine Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] – Protocol version 10. 4 dated 11/20/2015  
 6 for less than 60 minutes. Headache with the features of migraine without aura 
usually follows the aura symptoms. Less commonly, headache lacks migrainous 
featur es or is completely absent.  
 
• Acephalgic Migraine:   Migraine aura without subsequent head pain.   
 
• Epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730] : migraine headaches as defined above, with history  of 0 to 14 
headache days per month.  
 
• Chronic migraine:   migraine headaches as defined above, with history  of 15 or more 
headache days per month.   
 
Adverse Events Definitions:  
• Adverse Event:   Any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study  including intercurrent illnesses or injuries , 
whether or not it is considered therapy related.  Adverse events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_689870], 
or non -serious. Any adverse event will be considered “study -related” if it occurs in 
the time between the first dose of the study medication and [ADDRESS_935833] dose 
of the medication.  
 
• Serious Adverse Event:    Any adverse event that:  
o is fatal  
o is life-threatening requiring immediate intervention  
o requires or prolongs existing hosp ital stay  
o results in persistent or significant disability or incapacit ation  
o requires intervention to prevent the above and/or permanent impairment or 
damage  
 
Non -serious Adverse Event:   any other adverse event that does not meet criteria for 
a serious adve rse event . 
 
Definitions of bleeding events are based on  the PLATO Trial protocol28, a previously 
published study comparing Brilinta/ticagrelor to clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745].   
 
• Major Life -Threatening Bleeding  includes: 
o Any Fatal Bleed  
o Intracranial Hemorrhage  
o Intrapericar dial bleed with  cardiac tamponade  
o Bleeding resulting in  hypovolemic shock  or severe hypotension that 
requires pressors or surgery  
o Clinically overt or apparent bleeding associated with decrease in hemoglobin  >5 g/dL  
o Bleeding requiring transfusion of ≥4 U whole blood or PRBCs  
• Other Major Bleeding  includes:  
o Bleed causing clinically significant disability (e.g., intraocular bleed with 
permanent vision loss)  
TRACTOR Migraine Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] – Protocol version 10. 4 dated 11/20/2015  
 7 o Clinically overt or apparent bleeding associated with decrease 
in hemoglobin  >3 g/dL, but < 5 g/dl 
o Bleeding requiring transfusion of ≥2, but < 4 U whole blood or PRBCs  
 
• Minor Bleeding  includes a ny bleeding requiring medical intervention but not 
meeting the criteria for major bleeding  
  
Working Study Definitions:  
• Migra ine Headache Day:   any study day in which headache symptoms occur.  If a 
single headache lasts from the end of a calendar day into the beginning of the next, it 
would be considered a single headache day provided the event lasted less than [ADDRESS_935834] more than 24 hours, it would be considered 2 
Headache Days; more than 48 hours would be considered to be three days, etc.  Aura 
alone (“Acephalgic migraine”) will not be considered a headache.  The subject  must 
experience headache pain. 
 
• “Responder” to Therapy :  >50% reduction in the average number of monthly 
headache days during the month of therapy compared with participant’s own 
baseline.  
 
• “Non -responder” to Therapy :  <50% reduction in the number of monthly headache 
days during the mo nth of therapy compared with participant’s own baseline.  
 
• Platelet Inhibition :  This is a functional definition based on Platelet Reactivity. PRU 
Test Result (VerifyNow PRU Test, Accumetrics Inc. San Diego CA) of < 140, while on therapy, will be considered  a “positive” inhibitory effect of the medication.  PRU 
results of 1 41 – 160 will be considered a borderline response.  PRU results > 1 61 
will be considered a negative response.  
  
Primary Study Endpoints:  
 
• Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  A subject  will be considered to have achieved the 
primary efficacy endpoint (a “Responder”) if she/he has >50% reduction in the 
number of monthly headache days during the month of therapy compared with participant’s own baseline .   If there is < 50% reduction in the number of m igraine 
days, she/he will be considered a Non -Responder.  
 
• Primary Safety Endpoint: Major bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (as defined above) or other life -
threatening adverse event (see below), while taking  the Brilinta/ticagrelor .  
  
Secondary Study Endpoints:  
 
• Secondary Efficacy Endpoints will be assessed as follows:  
o Absolute reduction in headache days as a continuous response variable.  
o Absolute reduction in headache intensity as a continuous response variable . 
TRACTOR Migraine Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] – Protocol version 10. 4 dated 11/20/2015  
 8 o Quantitative c omparison of the number of monthly uses of re scue 
medications in the roll -in versus the treatment phase  
o Comparison of time to headache resolution after rescue medications.  If < 2 
hours to resolution, will be considered a “successful” intervention.  Will 
compare the percentage of successful intervent ions in the baseline and 
treatment phases.  
 
• Secondary Safety endpoints:   Non -life threatening adverse events to 
Brilinta/ticagrelor , including:  
 
o Minor bleeding  
o Allergic reactions  
o Shortness of Breath  
o Rash  
o Extreme fatigue  
o Any other symptom requiring the par ticipant to withdraw from the study 
prior to completion of the one month medication administration  
 
Subject Recruitment , Eligibility  and Screening:  
 
Study subjects will be recruited from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based cardiology and headache clinic at 
Columbia University Medical Center, and through the private offices of the study physicians.

Transcranial Doppler Screening:  
The presence of a right to left shunt, as defined by [CONTACT_689898] 
(described below) is a requirement for receiving the study drug under the TRACT OR 
Migraine protocol.  As the incidence of a right to left shunt is ~ 25% in the migraine population, in order to find [ADDRESS_935835] s will need to be screen ed.  It is anticipated that few, if any 
of those identified with a right to left shunt will be excluded on the basis of subsequent 
laboratory testing or baseline migraine screening.  
TRACTOR Migraine Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] – Protocol version 10. 4 dated 11/20/[ADDRESS_935836] 
completed her/his participation in the study and will be referred back to her/his referring 
physician for on -going conventional treatment of migraines.  
 Those part icipants identified with a right to left shunt will be assigned a Patient Study 
Number.   This number will be used for maintaining participant confidentiality and as 
identification for entering demographic and baseline headache log information in the 
TRACTO R Migraine Trial Database.  This number will continue with the participant 
throughout her/his participation in the trial, and will be used in any correspondence, Executive Committee meetings, or reports of adverse events.   
 
Once assigned a Patient Study Number, the subjec t will undergo baseline laboratory 
screening, consisting of:  
 
• Complete Blood Count:  Hemoglobin/Hematocrit, White Blood Count  
• Platelet Count  
• Chemistry panel, including Na+, K+, Cl- , HCO3 -, BUN, creatinine and creatinine 
clearance, and total bilirubin  
• Urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential to be done at the time of enrollment (or within one week prior to enrollment)  Transcranial Doppler Screening:  
When a participant meets basic inclusion/exclu sion criteria, she/he will be 
screened with a Power M -Mode Transcranial Doppler (TCD) examination as 
described by [CONTACT_464922].29 An ultrasound probe will be placed over the 
patient’s temple and an arterial tracing will be obtained.  She/he will receive a  
small intravenous line, through which two boluses of normal saline will be injected.  Each participant will undergo initial testing in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], 
with the head of the bed at a [ADDRESS_935837] and one with Valsalva.  These results of the transcranial Doppler exam will be described as follows:  
 
   • 
 Grade 0: No embolic events.  
   •  Grade 1: 1 –10 cerebral embolic events.  
   •  Grade 2: 11 –30 cerebral embolic events.  
   •  Grade 3: 31 –100 cerebral embolic events.  
   •  Grade 4: 101 –300 cerebral embolic events.  
   •  Grade 5: Greater than 300 countable dis crete events.  
   •  Grade 5+: Overwhelming events (“curtain” effect). 
 
A Spencer Grade > 2, either at rest or with Valsalva release, will be used as 
criteria for the presence of a right to left shunt.  
TRACTOR Migraine Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] – Protocol version 10. 4 dated 11/20/[ADDRESS_935838] be completed within 60 days of the enrollment date, and 
demonstrate the following:  
 
• Negative urine pregnancy test  
• Platelet count > 100,000  / µL 
• Normal renal function with creatinine clearance > 60 cc/min  
• Total bilirubin < 3.[ADDRESS_935839] agree that she/he will continue all baseline headache and non- headache 
medications without change for the two months duration of the study (see below).  Rescue/abortive headache therapy will be allowed as needed (see below).   
 Once all o f the above criteria have been fulfilled, the subject will continue to the baseline -
monitoring phase of the clinical trial (Phase 1).  
 All participants will complete a Quality of Life Survey (MSQ 2.1) at the outset of the study, 
upon completion  of study vi sit 3 , and upon completion of the continued access phase (if 
applicable) . 
 
 
TRACTOR Migraine Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] – Protocol version 10. 4 dated 11/20/2015  
 12   
Allowed Headache Medications :   
 
Most of the participa nts who will be eligible for the TRACTOR Trial will already 
have tried, or will be taking prophylactic migraine headache medication.  During the TRACTOR Trial, to best isolate the effect of the Brilinta/ticagrelor , all 
participants will be asked to continu e their headache medications at baseline 
dosage, throughout the duration of the trial.  This would include any of the drugs in 
the following categories:  
 
• Beta Blockers  
• Calcium Channel Blockers  
• Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors  
• Skeletal Muscle Relaxants  
• Fatty Acid Derivative Anticonvulsants  
• Anti -adrenergic agents  
• Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors 
• Vitamin Supplements  
 
Should the need arise to change the dose, or discontinue one of the medications for any reason, a protocol deviation report will be f iled.  All medications for non -
headache indications should be continued as well.  
 
Participants who are treated with Botox injections, may be considered for the 
TRACTOR  Migraine Trial, but should be warned of the small additional risk of 
bleeding at the sit e of the injection while on blood thinner therapy.  This should be 
discussed with the potential participant, as part of the informed consent process.  
The study coordinator  will be responsible for documentation of these discussions.  
 During the TRACTOR Tri al, there will be no restrictions on abortive/rescue 
medications for migraine epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], among the categories of drugs as follows:  
 
• Opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]  
• Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]  
• Non -steroidal anti -inflammatories  
• Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]  
• Tylenol  
• Triptans  
• Caffeine  
• Ergotamines  
• Butalbitals  
• Anti -emet ics 
• Muscle Relaxants  
The use of abortive/rescue therapy will be documented in the daily headache log.   
 
TRACTOR Migraine Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] – Protocol version 10. 4 dated 11/20/2015  
 13 Headache Tracking and Treatment Phases :   
 
Baseline- Monitoring Phase (Phase 1) :  The subject  will track her/his  headaches daily for 
28 days through an  online survey tool (REDCap , licensed through Columbia University) , to 
establish a baseline headache frequency.  Each day, the subject  will receive a text 
message /e-mail  reminder to complete the daily headache log.  The message will contain a 
link to log into the survey tool.  During  this phase, subject s will answer questions  including 
presence or absence of headache symptoms, severity of headache symptoms, duration of 
symptoms, impact on daily activities, and use of rescue medication.  Any headache lasting 
more than [ADDRESS_935840] ’s data  to make sure the subject  meets c riteria 
for minimum headache days, and has been consistently performing the daily log.  If the 
number of he adache days is insufficient, the subject ’s participation will be completed.    If 
the subject  logs at least 6 headache days in the month, she/ he will continue in the study.  If 
the participant has been assigned to the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_689875], but has >14  headache 
days in the screening month, or if the participant has been assigned to the Chronic arm of 
the study, but has <15 headache days in the screening month, she/he will NOT be 
reassigned, but will remain in the assigned group for analysis.  The subjec t will then be 
treated with Brilinta/ticagrelor for a [ADDRESS_935841]  period (Phase 2). The length of the test 
period will depend on the timing of the participant’s  follow -up visit after beginning 
treatment.   The protocol window is 28+7 days.  
 
Treatment Phase (Phase 2) :  The subject  will return for a follow -up visit to receive her/his 
medication  within 1 week of completing the 28 day headache log.  A loading dose of 
Brilinta/ticagrelor 180 mg will be administered in the office.  Thereafter, for 28 -35 days, a 
Brilinta/ticagrelor [ADDRESS_935842] her/his  headache activity.  If she/ he fails to login  
for two consecutive days , the study coordinator will place a follow -up phone call.   PRU 
testing will be done a minimum of 7 days after the initiation of treatment, but before the 
medication is completed .  A follow -up visit  will be  arranged between day 28 and day 35   
days of monitoring to review efficacy, compliance , and side effects , to return unused 
medication,  and to allow continued access to Brilinta/ticagrelor if indicated.   A second 
Quality of Life survey will be completed . 
 Continued Access Phase (Phase 3):  If the subject  has a beneficial response to the 
Brilinta/ticagrelor (> 50% reduction in the average number of monthly headache days 
compared with the baseline), she/he will be offered continued access to the medication t o 
complete an additional [ADDRESS_935843] month of treatment  (Phase 2), the medication will be discontinued and participation in 
the study  will be completed.  If the subject elects to discontinue the Brilinta/ticagrelor, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a beneficial response, participation in the study will be completed.   
  
Outcomes Assessment/Statistical Analysis  
 
TRACTOR Migraine Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] – Protocol version 10. 4 dated 11/20/[ADDRESS_935844]  compliance rate with use of daily online 
questionnaires will be determined.  Drop- out rate s, related to medication side effects  will 
also be assess ed.   
 
1. Statistical Considerations and Analysis Plan:  
This is a prospective, open label single -armed trial designed to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of Brilinta/ticagrelor  (90 mg twice daily) used off -label, in a young healthy 
population, for the treatment refractory migraine  headache. The primary endpoints ar e: 
 
• Efficacy – Response to treatment defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in chronic 
headache during a three month period of therapy, compared with baseline.  
• Safety – Bleeding events and adverse medication reactions measured over the 
[ADDRESS_935845] s will be treated in this initial feasibility trial , 20 with epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730], 
20 with chronic migraine .   We will assess the number of “Responders” in each study  
group.  Responsiveness will be compared with the measured PRU while on therapy.  The 
results of this trial will be descriptive only.  It is not anticipated that the number of 
subject s enrolled will provide statistically analyzable results.   
 However, if treatment were to be seemingly beneficial, these data could form the 
foundation for the development of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_492339], blinded, prospective trial in a 
larger cohort as mentioned above.  
 The safety analysis set will include all subject s who receive at least one dose of study 
medication.  This will be the primary analysis set for all safety endpoints which will include major bleeding complications, and adverse drug reactions.   Bleeding outcomes, 
in this younger, healthier cohort will be compared with the previously published PLATO Trial
21. 
 Any participant  who completes her/his  daily headache logs for at least two weeks, but 
not the full month of the study period, will be classified according to her/his current 
response status (LOCF), regardless of whether or not he/she  completed the required 
therapy.  
 2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
The secondary endpoints, which will be reported, are as follows:  
• Absolute reduction in headache days as a continuous response variable.  
• Comparison of the use of rescue medications in the roll- in versus the 
treatment phase and “successful” interruption of MHA (< 2 hours to resolution) with rescue therapy.  
• Non -major bleeding side effects of the medication

 15STUDY PROCEDURES : 
All potential subjects must have migraine headache documented b y a Neurologist.  All 
potential subjects must have a d ocumented RLS by [CONTACT_114904] D oppler (see details above) 
prior to being a candidate for inclusion into the treatment gro up.  All potentia l subjects will 
undergo baseline blood work testing and a urine pregnancy test if indicated.  All subjects 
will take a migraine specific Quality of Life Survey (see below ) at the start of the study and 
at visit #3 and at the conclusion of the continued access phase  of the study (if applicable) . 
All subjects will complete a dai ly headache log (see below), us ing the REDCap Survey Tool.  
Each subject will monitor headaches for the first month (28 day s) while on her/his baseline 
medication, and will monitor head aches while also taking Brilin ta/ticagrelor 90 mg twice 
daily for the second month (28-35  days).  All subjects will und ergo PRU blood testing a 
minimum of 7 days after the start of the Brilinta/ticagrelor th erapy (but prior to its 
completion).  A subject may be eligible for two additional mont hs of Brilinta/ticagrelor 
therapy, with on-going headache monitoring, if she/he has a pos itive response to the 
medication.  
STUDY DRUG : 
Description: 
Brilinta/ticagrelor,, the first of a new class of oral anti-pla telet agents 
(cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidines), is a non-competitive, P2Y12 r eceptor antagonist.   
Following a loading dose of 180 mg , the drug will be administer ed in its current FDA 
approved (2011) dosage of 90 mg twice daily. 
 
Figure 1  
 
Approved Uses: 
Brilinta/ticagrelor is currently FDA approved as a prescription  medicine for patients who: 
xHave had a recent heart attack o r severe chest pain that happen ed because their heart 
wasn’t getting enough oxygen 
xHave had a heart attack or chest pain and are being treated wit h medicines or 
procedures to open blocked arteries in the heart 
 
Formulation/Dosage to be Used: 
Brilinta tablets for oral admini stration contain 90 mg of ticag relor and the following 
ingredients:  mannitol, dibasiccalcium phosphate, sodium starch  glycolate, hydroxypropyl 

TRACTOR Migraine Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] – Protocol version 10. 4 dated 11/20/2015  
 16 cellulose, magnesium stearate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, titanium dioxide, talc, 
polyethylene glycol 400, and ferric oxide yellow.
TRACTOR Migraine Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] – Protocol version 10. 4 dated 11/20/2015  
 17 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits : 
Based on the known safety profiles of the clinically approved medication, Brilinta/ticagrelor 
will be given by [CONTACT_1966], in a dose of 90 mg twice daily.   There are small, but known risks of this medication, particularly related to bruising and bleeding (see package insert).  Since the 
potential benefits of the therapy is unknown in this application, the standard clinical dosing 
was selected.  
 There are several important pharmacologic differences between Brilinta/ticagrelor and the 
thienopyridines:  
 
• Unlike the thienopyridines, Brilinta/ticagrelor binds reversibly to P2Y12  
• Unlike the thienopyridines, in vivo metabolism is not required to have this effect.   
• In pharmacodynamics  studies, Brilinta/ticagrelor provided more potent and faster 
onset of platelet inhibition than clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], without a significant increase in the 
overall risk of major bleeding.
28 
 Several side effects, not seen with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_104880], were seen wi th the use of 
Brilinta/ticagrelor .   
 
• Dyspnea
30-32 was usually mild and self -limiting with no change in pulmonary 
function tests.  In PLATO it was seen in 14% of patients, compared with 8% of 
patients on clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]. 28     
• Bradyarrhythmia, particularly si nus pauses occurred in 5.8% of patients on 
Brilinta/ticagrelor and on 3.6% of patients on clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]28 with no clinically 
reported dizziness, syncope, pacemaker need or cardiac arrest.  This effect is likely related to the drug’s delay of adenosine metabo lism and re -uptake.   
• Increased serum levels of uric acid:  as uric acid is a break -down product of 
adenosine, this is also likely related to higher levels of adenosine.   
• Increased serum creatinine:  These changes were not clinically apparent.  Elevated 
adenosine levels also may explain this effect.    Adenosine alters renal 
hemodynamics by [CONTACT_689899], and lowering the 
glomerular filtration pressure.   
 Packaging of Study Drug: 
Brilinta/ticagrelor will be provided to the s tudy by [CONTACT_689900] .  The receipt, storage and dispensing of the investigational medication will be 
handled by [CONTACT_689901].  Medication 
bottles will be labeled as per federa l and state regulations.   
 Storage and Distribution : 
The Clinical Trials materials will be distributed at controlled room temperature, in an 
insulated shipp er with a temperature monitor by [CONTACT_38227].  The Research Pharmacy at 
Columbia University Medical  Center will store all materials at controlled room temperature 
(15°C to 25 °C) in a secured limited access area.  
 
Return/Destruction of Study Drug: 
Unless the study is stopped early due to side effects, it is anticipated that subjects will use 
all drug s supplied by [CONTACT_20767].  Any unused drug will be returned at Study Visit #3.   Any 
TRACTOR Migraine Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] – Protocol version 10. 4 dated 11/20/2015  
 18 returned drug will be collected by [CONTACT_689902].   
 
STUDY INSTRUMENTS: 
 
Quality of Life Survey:   
The MSQ – 2.1 Survey (M igraine Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire – Version 2.1) will be 
used as an assessment of the impact of the headaches on participants’ lives at the outset of 
the TRACTOR Migraine Trial, and at the completion of the medication month  (Phas e 2).  
This survey will be completed with the study coordinator at the initial visit, at the completion of Phase 2, and at the completion of the continued access phase if applicable. 
MSQ- 2.1 is a validated tool for the assessment of migraine participants t o medical therapy
23. 
 
Headache Log Recordings:  
 
Participants will be responsible for tracking headache symptoms daily.  The daily headache 
log is a simple questionnaire adapted from the validated Migraine Disability Assessment 
(MIDAS) questionnaire24 and t he validated 24 hour period migraine -specific quality of life 
questionnaire (24 -h MQoLQ)25.  The first question will determine if the participant has had 
headache symptoms within the previous [ADDRESS_935846] completed the headache log for the day.  If headache symptoms 
were present, additional questions will determine the duration of the symptoms, their severity, the response to rescue medication (if used), and the degree of disability related to 
the headache.  
 
Participants will receive a daily text message/e -mail reminder, with a link to the Headache 
Log via the REDCap  Survey tool .  When clicked, the link will take the subject directly to the 
daily log questions  (either through a computer or through a smart phone).  Each link is valid 
for only one use.  All headache log data will be stored on a HIPAA compliant, secure server at Columbia University Medical Center, for later analysis.  
 
 
STUDY SUBJECTS:  
Patient s ages 18 – [ADDRESS_935847] meet all 
Preliminary Inclusion and Preliminary Exclusion criteria and will then be offered 
participation in the trial.  Once identified, all potential participants will be consented by [CONTACT_1268]/Research team at Columbia University Medical Center.  Subject s will 
then be screened with a transcranial Doppler study to determine the presence or absence of a right to left shunt.  All subjects with right to left shunt, who meet subsequent laboratory 
criteria will proceed with the protocol until a total of [ADDRESS_935848] s are treated with 
Brilinta/ticagrelor and [ADDRESS_935849] s with chronic headaches are treated with 
Brilinta/ticagrelor .   
 
 
  
TRACTOR Migraine Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] – Protocol version 10. 4 dated 11/20/2015  
 19 RECRUITMENT:  
Subjects will be recruited from the investigator s’ clinic and private patient population s.   
Study information, which will be pre -approved by [CONTACT_4707], will be 
available to both referri ng physicians and to the subject s in printed format and on -line.  
Local physicians interested in referring subject s to the study will be able to set up 
appointments for their patients directly through the office of the Principal Investigator.  
 
Patients  will be approached for participation  by [CONTACT_689903]/his office visit at Columbia University Medical Center  or the external office of the 
Principal Investigator .  The investigator  will discuss the study with her/him  in order to 
ascert ain whether or not she/he might be interested in participation.  
 
A member of the research team will review patient information to see if she/he meet s the 
initial inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study .  All of the information the treatment team 
member reviews to screen potential participants has been obtained by [CONTACT_49885] 
(NP’s, PA’s and physicians) for clinical purposes.  Some examples of the type of information 
reviewed include  the patient’s age, their medication list, drug allergies, le ngth of migraine 
history, migraine frequency, etc.  If the patient is found to fit study criteria, the consent 
process begins.  
  
INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS:  
Patients who meet Preliminary criteria will be consented by a member of the treatment 
team.  At the f irst screening visit, patients will sign a Screening Consent, which will give the 
investigators permission to perform the Transcranial Doppler Study and blood work to 
assure their eligibility.  Once it is determined that a right to left shunt is present, t he 
complete consent for the TRACTOR Migraine Headache Study will be completed.  A ll 
questions regarding the study will be answered and the patient will have the opportunity to 
discuss any research related issues.  No time limit will be defined and sufficie nt time will be 
given to the patient to con sider participation.  The patien t will be give n the opportunity to 
consult with others including family members, referring physician, etc.  If she/he is  
interested in participating, written consent will be obtained either at that time or at any 
subsequent date . 
 
 
SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS: 
 
Definitions of Adverse Events (see above):  
 Recording of Adverse Events:  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_689876] (SAE); an electronic Adverse Event Report Form will be completed.  
 Adverse Event Reporting Period:  
Serious Adverse Events, after assessment by [CONTACT_1704], are to be reported to all other investigators (Executive Committee) within 48 hours.  The Investigator will convene 
the Executive Committee to review/adjudicate the event, with reporting to the 
IRB/FDA/[COMPANY_008]  as required.  Non -serious adverse events will be recorded in the 
participant study record, reviewed by [CONTACT_689904], and will be reported to the 
IRB/[COMPANY_008]  as required.   
TRACTOR Migraine Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] – Protocol version 10. 4 dated 11/20/2015  
 20  
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events:  
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_689877], as well as 
the local authorities and ethical committees, of any serious adverse events as per local requirements.   Serious adverse events that do not require expedited reporting need to be 
reported to [COMPANY_008] quarterly either as individual case reports or as line -listings.  
 
Any SAE that is unexpected and for which ther e is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the adverse event  will be considered a “Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R), and will be reported to the FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 .  This 
report will be submitted to the FDA as  soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days 
from participant notification, and unexpected fatal or life -threatening serious adverse 
reactions ( SARs ) will be submitted no later than 7 calendar days from the initial 
notification. Events that are considered to be “Unanticipated Problems” or UPs, will be 
submitted promptly to CUMC IRB, but no later than [ADDRESS_935850] knowledge of the UP.  
 All Serious Adverse Event reports will be reviewed/adjudicated by [CONTACT_3433] e Executive 
Committee with reporting to the IRB/FDA as required.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_689878] (SAE) information to each of 
the study investigators.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting forms will be  used to identify and track each Adverse Event during 
the study.  The form will capture the nature of the event (e.g. Bleeding, Shortness of Breath, etc.), the likelihood that the AE was related to the study medication, the need for treatment 
related to th e AE, the type of treatment required, and the clinical outcome of the AE.  Each 
AE will be classified as an anticipated or unanticipated issue with the study medication.  Any bleeding AE will be further characterized (separate report form) as a major life -
threatening bleed, major non -life threatening bleed or minor bleed.   Additional s eparate 
report forms are available in the event of a subject mortality during the study.  All AE’s will be reported as safety endpoints in the final study report.  
 If a parti cipa nt, or the female partner of a male participant  should become pregnant during 
the study (with or without an adverse event), the pregnancy will be followed to delivery (no matter how the pregnancy ends, spontaneous abortion, elective abortion, pre or term 
delivery etc.) and the outcome of the pregnancy will  be documented and reported as 
appropriate (to both FDA and to [COMPANY_008]).  Any congenital anomaly or birth defect, in the offspring of a patient (male or female) who was taking the study drug when p regnancy 
occurred, will be reported to the IRB, to the FDA and to [COMPANY_008] as an SAE.   
 
If a patient should take  a dose of a drug in excess of that specified in the protocol 
(overdose), the patient should be evaluated for any  AE or SAE .  The outcomes o f any such 
overdose will be  report ed to the FDA and A straZeneca as appropriate.  Note that overdoses 
with or without associated symptoms should be collected and sent to [COMPANY_008] alone.

 21 CONFIDENTIALITY OF STUDY DATA:  
Any information collected during this study that c ould  identify the subject  by [CONTACT_689905].  All research study information will be kept in the form of e lectronic files, 
which  will be password protected and stored on an encrypted server.  A code will be used to 
identify  subjects but this code will be linked to the subjects’ identity.  The code and the 
subjects’ identity will be included in the same password protected electronic file and stored 
on an encrypted server.  
 
 
PRIVACY PROTECTIONS:  
Measures such as those describe d in the 
confidentiality section  will be taken to 
keep subject  data secure, however, 
complete confidentiality cannot be promised.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_689879], 
unanticipated problems, such as a stolen computer may occur, although it is 
highly unlikely.   We will not share any 
identifiable data outside of the research team.  
  
POTENTIAL RISKS:  
Brilinta/ticagrelor will be used off -label.  
There is no prior report of its use in the migraine headache population.  Risks are 
extrapolated from the well- studied acute  coronary syndrome population.   
  
Bleeding Risks:  
From the PLATO  Trial28 annualized rates of bleeding are summarized in Table [ADDRESS_935851] 30 days.  This suggests that if the 
TRACTOR population were the same as the PLATO Trial, a risk of a majo r bleeding event 
would be expected in ~ 2.2% of patients on a 30 day course of the medication, with a 
potential life -threatening bleed occurring in ~ 1%.   
 
However, PLATO included only patients with acute coronary syndromes.  As a result, the 
average patient age was [ADDRESS_935852] a much 
higher propensity for causing bleeding in the older population.  In addition, all patient s in 
the PLATO trial were on dual antiplatelet therapy (with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]), which also increases the 
bleeding risk.   In the TRACTOR Migraine Trial subject s will not be taking aspi[INVESTIGATOR_689880].  The bleeding risks in PLATO were statistically higher, but not  clinically 
different from that in the clopi[INVESTIGATOR_689881].  We had no bleeding complications in a 
similar migraine population, in our published clopi[INVESTIGATOR_689882].14 
 
Other Potential Risks:  
In PLATO28 there were no serious  clinical risks associated with  the other observed side 
effects of the drug .  Dyspnea was self -limited and mild in most.  Elevation of serum uric acid 
and creatinine was not a clinically important issue, and in the TRACTOR Migraine Pi[INVESTIGATOR_689883]

 Outcomes in the TRACTOR Migraine Trial will be compared to historical data from prior 
studies and drug manufacturing data to identify any new, unexpected adverse events or outcomes.   The Executive Committee of the Trial will review all reports of adverse events.  
  
POTENTIAL BENEFITS:  
This is an observational study of the off- label use of Brilinta/ticagrelor as a primary therapy 
for treatment of migraine  headache.  In a previous  study of 15 patients with severe migraine 
treated with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]14, >80% had improvement or complete resolution of symptoms. It 
is unknown if Brilinta/ticagrelor will benefit any individual subject.  
 
 
ALTERNATIVES:  
Subjects may choose not to participate in this study .  Subjects may continue to work with 
their Neurologist using other preventive headache therapi[INVESTIGATOR_689885] A, 
beta -blockers, topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], divalproex/sodium valproate, calcium channel blockers, and 
others  including non- medication management.33,34 
  
WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS:  
 
There may be circumstances in which a participant may need to withdraw from the 
TRACTOR Migraine Trial.  These may include either Serious or Important Adverse Events 
(as listed above), a change in health status (including need for urgent surgical or medical 
intervention, or unanticipated pregnancy), or non -compliance with the protocol.  Non -
compliance would be defined as recurrent failure to take the medication as directed, failure 
to kee p protocol appointments, or repeated failure to enter headache log information 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_689886].   
 
Any other serious adverse event, which might require discontinuation of the study drug, 
would require documentation of the issue by [CONTACT_259368] , with formal consultation 
with the Principal Investigator.  An electronic Patient Withdrawal Form would need to be completed by [CONTACT_079].  Any adverse event leading to subject withdrawal 
will require documen ted discussion by [CONTACT_19305], and a follow- up 
assessment by [CONTACT_259368] , to confirm the participant’s return to baseline health 
status.  
 Once withdrawn from the TRACTOR Migraine Trial for medical reasons, all efficacy data 
collected t o date will be maintained, but no further data will be collected.  A ny participant  
who completes the daily headache logs for at least two weeks while on treatment , but who 
does not complete the full four weeks  of the study period, will be classified accord ing to 
their current response status (LOCF), regardless of whether or not they completed the required therapy  (see Outcomes Assessment) .  
 
Should a participant choose to withdraw consent for the TRACTOR Migraine Trial, at any 
time during the monitoring per iod, for reasons other than an adverse event, the participant 
must contact [CONTACT_458], who will complete an electronic Patient Withdrawal 
TRACTOR Migraine Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] – Protocol version 10. 4 dated 11/20/[ADDRESS_935853] patient, and will review all safety data on an on -going basis and all 
SAE’s within [ADDRESS_935854] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_689887]:  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  
Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the 
following:  
 
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this 
study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the abili ty to use all information collected prior to the revocation of 
subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the 
subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
 Source Documents:  
All source data, whether participant  demographic information, notes from participant  office 
visits, or participant  entered headache log information will be stored in a database on a 
HIPAA compliant, secure server at Columbia University Medical Center.  Transcranial 
Doppler studies will be recorded and stored in both .pdf and original format.  Pharmacy 
records covering distribution medication will be kept at the Study Research Pharmacy .

STUDY MONITORING, AUDITING AND INSPECTING  
 
Monitoring Plan :  
 
The Principal Investigator /IND Sponsor (PI) will ensure that the study protocol is followed, 
the data is accurate and the research subjects are safe. Safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978], or by [CONTACT_689907], as soon as it is received.  Safety data will also be monitored by [CONTACT_341309] (EC), which will review safety data and make recommendations regarding continuation, termination, or modification of the study. The EC  will formally 
review the safety data, enrollment, and clinical outcome data after the first [ADDRESS_935856] 
been treated and will review all serious adverse events within 48 hours.  
 A dedicated Study Coordinator will review 100% of source documentation /data collected  
for accuracy, including all safety data. The regulatory binder, along with other essential 
study documents, will also be reviewed to ensure that it is complete and up to date. The first 
review will occur after the first subject  is enrolled and will continue weekly with new 
enrollments. Any discrepancies will be discussed with relevant study personnel for 
clarification and/or correction.  
 The Study Coordinator will be responsible for the monitoring and day -to-day running of the 
trial.  Her/his responsibilities will include:  
 
• scheduling all appointments for Transcranial Doppler 
• obtaining consent for participant s on the  day of their initial visit

Trial Schedule:   (see attached TRACTOR Migraine Trial Flow Sheet in Appendix 2 ) 
 
Study V isit #1:  At the time of the first visit, study coordinator/investigators will 
discuss trial and subject eligibility for participation based on 
migraine headache frequ ency.   The coordinator will collect all 
demogra phic information required for the study.   Participant will 
receive explanation of the additional testing required for trial participation.  After patient has been given an opportunity to ask 
questions, a screening consent will be signed to perform this testing.  
Participant will receive a Patient Study Number.  Transcranial 
Doppler study will be performed.  If negative for right to left shunt, participant  will be sent  back to the referring  physician  for on -going 
clinical care.  If positive for right to left shunt ( Spencer Grade > 2) 
participant  will be eligible to continue in the trial .  The trial will be 
explained in detail, incl uding participant  responsibilities, and the 
patient will receive written study materials.  A complete TRACTOR Migraine Headache Trial consent will be signed.  The participant will 
receive a test e- mail/text message and must  demonstrate the ability 
to answer the headache log questions.  A Quality of Life Survey will 
be taken.  Laboratory  screening  is done .   End of visit.  
  
   
Study P hase 1:  
(28 Days)  Within 72 hours of the laboratory evaluation, participant will be notified of results of laboratory testing and ability to continue 
participation.  She/he will begin to receive daily reminders (e -
mail/text message) to log -in to answer the  headache log questions.  
A follow -up appointment will be scheduled within 7 days of the 
completion of 28 days of headache monitoring.   
 Study Day 29:  Headache log entries will be reviewed by [CONTACT_689911].  
 Study Visit #2 :   Must  occur within seven  days of completion of baseline headach e 
log. Particip ant will return to receive her/his medication.  She/ he 
will receive a loading dose of 180 mg of Brilinta/ticag relor and an 
additional [ADDRESS_935863] medication dose. 
 
Study Phase 2 :   Participant will receive remind er text message/e -mail to t ake daily  
(28-35 Days)  study medication, and to l og-in to answer the headache log 
questions.  Participant will take Brilinta/ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily 
for 28 -35 days.  Participant will receive instructions for PRU testing .

PRU Testing:    Participant will go to local laboratory or to study center for blood  
(> 7 days on drug)  testing of platelet inhibition.  
 
Study Visit #3:  Within [ADDRESS_935864] has had a clinical benefit, 
options for on -going therapy with additio nal headache log entries 
will be discussed.  Participant will c omplete a follow -up Quality of 
Life questionnaire .  
 Continued Access  If eligible, p articipant will continue to take Brilinta/ticagrelor for an 
(56-63 days) :  additional 2 months.  She/he will continue to receive daily  
e-mail/text message  reminders to log -in to record headache data.   
 
Study Visit #4 : Within 7 days  of the 56
th day of study medication, participant will 
return to meet with  the study coordinator to review the results of 
the therapy , to return unused medication, and to review any adverse 
events .  Participant will c omplete a follow -up  Quality of life 
questionnaire .    Study is complete.

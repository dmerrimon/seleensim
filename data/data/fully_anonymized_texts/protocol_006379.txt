substantially in the modern therapeutic era, this disease is still characterized by a ge nerally 
incurable clinical course.1,2  While follicular lymphoma (FL) prognosis is known to be 
influenced by [CONTACT_165216], modifiable prognostic and predictive factors for 
this disease in the modern treatment era have been difficult to elucidate.  Other less common 
indolent non -Hodgkin lymphomas include marginal zone and small lymphocytic lymp homas, 
these often present in a similar fashion to follicular lymphoma, are treated in a similar way, 
and have similar outcomes.3,[ADDRESS_191604] common presentation of indolent lymphomas in 
the [LOCATION_002] is “low tumor burden” disease, defined as asymptomatic disease, non-bulky  
lymphadenopathy, and no cytopenias, which is the subject of this study .  Although patients 
with low tumor burden disease may be observed for a period of time without treatment, two 
recent large randomized trials have sugg ested single agent rituximab is an attractive 
therapeutic option for these patients, and this approach is supported by [CONTACT_18430][INVESTIGATOR_165193].5-7  In a registry study conducted in the [LOCATION_002] between 2004 
and 2007, single agent rituximab was frequently utilized for patients with low tumor burden 
follicular lymphoma.8  A randomized trial from the [LOCATION_008] compared early 
administration of rituximab to observation, and follow -up to date demonstrates significantly 
improved progression -free survival, and longer time to chemotherapy initiation fo r the patients 
treated with rituximab.9 A recently published [LOCATION_002] Intergroup trial (“RESORT” trial) 
enrolled patients with low tumor burden follicular a nd other indolent lymphomas, and 
demonstrated the safety and efficacy of 4 weekly doses of single agent rituximab, with 
approximately 40% of patients responding to treatment and then remaining progression -free 
after [ADDRESS_191605], and even skin cancer.14,15  Obtained mostly 
through sun exposure , but also available from food sources and dietary suppleme nts16, 
vitamin D in humans is metabolized in the liver to 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), and further 
metabolized in the kidney to its active form, 1,25 -dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2D).17  
However,  there is evidence that many cell types, including immune cells, also express both 
the 1 -α-hydroxylase needed to activate vitamin D and the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) 
ILyAD Trial

Version Date: July 1, 2020  to which 1,25(OH) 2D binds.17,18  This extra -renal activation of 25(OH)D and binding of the VDR 
by 1,25(OH) 2D leads to transcriptional regulation of hundreds of downstream target genes 
contain ing the vitamin D response elements (VDREs)19, and results in autocrine and p aracrine 
effects biologically relevant to both cancer prevention and slowed progression of existing 
tumors, including regulation of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis and 
differentiation.[ADDRESS_191606] cancer;26,[ADDRESS_191607] that increased 
sun exposure (our major source of vitamin D) is protect ive against lymphoma,  though the 
literature to date is thus far weak or null with regard to an association between vitamin D status 
and risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_165194].[ADDRESS_191608] of 1,25(OH)D on

differentiation and antiproliferative effects on lymphoma cell lines in vitro. 30,31 Season of 
diagnosis has been demonstrated to be associated with overall survival in patients with diffuse 
large B -cell lymphoma in Sweden, with improved overall survivals in patients diagnosed in the 
summer, controlled for age,  stage, performance status, extranodal sites, and year of 
diagnosis, possibly secondary to higher vitamin D level during the summer months.32 
 
Moreover,  survival benefit with vitamin D sufficiency among patients with newly diagnosed 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCBL)33,[ADDRESS_191609] chemotherapy of patients with DLBCL, patients 
with vitamin D deficiency, defined as </= 8 ng/mL and sufficient vitamin D levels more than 8 
ng/mL treated with rituximab had 3 -year event -free survival (EFS) of 59% and 79% and 3 -
year overall survival (OS) of 70% and 82%, respectively. These differences were significant 
in a multivariable analysis adjusting for standard risk factors w ith a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.1 (P 
= .008) for event -free survival  and 1.9 (P = .040) for OS, and were validated in an independent 
group of patients.[ADDRESS_191610] 1000 patients treated at 
Mayo clinic with aggressive lymphomas, after adjusting for known prognostic factors and 
treatment, 25(OH)D insufficient patients (defined as </=25 ng/ml) with DLBCL had inferior 
event -free survival (HR 1.41) and OS (HR 1.99).37  Furthermore, in patients at Mayo clinic with 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, another indolent B -cell lymphoproliferative dis order, with a 
median follow -up of 3 years, time to treatment initiation (HR 1.66; P = .005) and OS (HR 2.39; 
P = .01) were shorter for 25(OH)D -insufficient patients using yet another threshold to define 
insufficiency. In their validation cohort, after a me dian follow -up of 9.9 years, time to treatment 
(HR 1.59; P = .05) and OS (HR 1.63; P = .06) were again shorter for 25(OH)D -insufficient 
patients.[ADDRESS_191611] is largely absent on lymphoma cell lines, and in clinical samples of

treatment along with CHOP -based chemotherapy.  Antibody -dependent cell -mediated 
cytotoxicity (ADCC) is the major mechanism of rituximab action in patients with follicular 
lymphoma.43 Using an LDH release assay with rituximab as the antibody and the CD20+ Daudi 
cell line as the target, improved rituximab -mediated cellular cytotoxicity was observed in  blood 
samples of healthy patients with vitamin D deficiency after vitamin D substitution compared 
with the deficient state.[ADDRESS_191613] on tumor -
associated macrophages has been shown to activate anti -lymphoma activity.  In a laboratory 
model of Burkitt lymphoma, treatment of anti -inflammatory M2 macrophages with vitamin D 
induces production of cathelicidin (an  anti-microbial peptide), and triggers anti -lymphoma 
activity.[ADDRESS_191614] demonstrated that vitamin D modulates the activity of

outcome in patients with lymphoma treated with rituximab.  Indeed, in a small clinical study of 
34 patients with indolent lymphomas, asymptomatic patien ts were treated with 1 microgram 
daily of oral alfacalcidol, a vitamin D analogue. Complete response was observed in four 
patients and a partial response in four patients with an overall response rate of 24%. Median 
duration of response was 14 months. Dise ase stabilization was observed in ten additional 
patients (29%) and in the sub -group of patients with follicular, small -cleaved cell -lymphoma 
the overall response to treatment was 29%.[ADDRESS_191616] chemotherapy (CHOP: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine 
and prednisone) plus anti -CD20 therapy, and routinely followed for outcomes per clinical trial 
protocol, we reported a significant association betwe en low vitamin D levels and FL outcomes 
in two independent cohorts of patients.[ADDRESS_191617] association reported to date of a pre -
therapy prognostic factor in follicular lymphoma.47  In the SWOG cohort of patients, with a 
median follow -up of 5.4 years, vitamin D deficient patients had significantly inferior 
progression -free survival (HR 2.00, p=0.011) and OS (HR 3.57, p=0.003) as com pared to 
those with higher levels.  The magnitude and significance of these associations remained after 
analyses were stratified by [CONTACT_165217] (IPI), BMI, quarter 
of enr ollment (3/4 vs. 1/2), latitude (≥35°N vs. <35°N), and a quarter by [CONTACT_165218].  Similarly, in the LYSA cohort, after median follow -up of 6.6 years, vitamin D deficient 
patients had significantly inferior progression -free survival (HR 1.66 p =0.013) as compared to 
those with higher levels.  The magnitude of these associations remained after analyses were 
adjusted for prognostic index (FLIPI), BMI, quarter of enrollment (3/4 vs. 1/2), latitude (Europe

observed association in two independent cohorts of patients, and the lack of multiple 
comparisons inherent in our study  design indicate these findings are unlikely secondary to 
chance.  
 
These data strongly support a randomized trial  to evaluate whether vitamin D supplementation 
improves outcome in patients with indolent lymphoma treated with rituximab.  
 
 STUDY DESIGN  
 
 Overv iew 
We are conducting a  multicenter, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled Phase 
III clinical trial : ILyAD ( Indolent Lymphoma And vitamin D)    
 
Specific treatment groups ( 2:[ADDRESS_191619] allocation ): 
 
 Arm A: rituximab weekly x 4  (intravenous 375  mg/m2 or subcutaneous 1400  
mg) + cholecalciferol (vitamin D3 ) 2,000 IU daily for 3 y ears*   
 
 Arm B: rituximab weekly x 4  (intravenous 375  mg/m2 or subcutaneous 1400  
mg) + placebo  daily for 3 y ears* 
 
 *or until lack of response at Week 13 , new treatment  or progre ssive disease thereafter  
 
Anticipated enrollment period:  We anticipate meeting enrollment goals within 30 months . 
 
Follow -up period:  Patients will be treated and followed on study for 3 years or until 
disease progression. Patients should be followed for su rvival until study closure.  
 
Participating sites:  University of [COMPANY_002]ster, Cornell, Emory, MD Anderson, Washington 
University , University of Miami , University of Iowa . 
 
 Rationale for Study Design  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_165195]  D deficiency is negatively correlated 
with outcome in patients with numerous cancers, rigorous prospective randomized 
evaluation of vitamin D as an anti -neoplastic agent is lacking. Our study evaluates a 
novel approach to the treatment of indolent B -cell lymphoma through a randomized, 
placebo -controlled, double -blind trial which will definitely address whether modification 
of vitamin D levels through supplementation can improve outcomes.   
 
 Rationale for Dosage  of Rituximab and Vitamin D  (Cholecalciferol)  
Weekly intravenous rituximab administration at 375 mg/m2, for four weeks, has been 
established as a safe and effective therapy in low -tumor burden follicular lymphoma .10,[ADDRESS_191620] been FDA -approved, t he route of administration is left 
to the  investigator ’s discretion and standard institutional practice.   
 
Current recommended dietary allowance f or vitamin D ranges from 600 -800 IU in 
adults .50  However, recent literature suggests that be nefits of vitamin D in cancer may 
necessitate higher doses .16  A dose of 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is a 
standard daily dose that is readily available over the counter.  This dose is chosen in an 
ILyAD Trial     
Page 12 of 38 
Version Date: July 1, 2020  attempt to supplement serum 25(OH)D levels in subjects  while maintaining a substantial 
margin of safety below the upper level of intake (4,000 IU) at which point the potential 
risk for harm begins to increase .50 Our chosen dose of 2,000 IU has been shown to 
effectively raise 25(OH)D levels over a prolonged period of administration without 
evidence of toxicity in previous studies ,51 and this strategy and dose of vitamin D has 
been utilized in many prospective clinical trials, including ongoing NIH studies.52-56 
Moreover, the 2000  IU dose reversed vitamin D deficiency in over 80% of patients in a 
recently published dose -response study.[ADDRESS_191621] similar vitamin D area under the 
curve levels compared with bolus intravenous supplementation ,58 and is chosen in this 
study for patient convenience given the planned prolonged administration.  Our choice 
for 3 years of vitamin D therapy is based upon previous studies demonstrating the safety  
of this approach,59 and the observation that time to maximal response with rituximab is 
variable.  Moreover, to the degree that vitamin D supplementation may affec t the indolent 
lymphoma microenvironment, we feel a prolonged exposure will maximize potential 
beneficial effects.  
 
 End of Treatment  (EOT)  
Subjects that have not achieved a res ponse  to treatment  at Week [ADDRESS_191622] had 
disease progression  thereafter (or new  treatment for lymphoma or systemic treatment 
for another cancer in the absence of progression) should stop taking study drug. These 
subjects should remain on study and be followed for survival only. Subjects that have 
had increased calcium above normal re ference ranges * should stop taking study drug 
but continue on study with the planned study pr ocedures accordin g to Table 2. End of 
treatment s tudy blood  should be collected  if the EOT vi sit occurs at a visit where blood 
has not already been collected.  
  
*At the discretion of the investigator, albumin -corrected calcium or ionized calcium result s may 
be used to confirm true hypercalcemia. If albumin -corrected or ionized calcium levels exceed 
the laboratory reference range, the subject should be taken off stud y drug as described above.  
   
 End of Study  
Subjects should remain on study for survival follow -up after the completion of 
procedures in Table 2. Subjects should be followed for survival until study closure .  
 
 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RESEARCH POPULATION  
 
 Subject Characteristics  
Two hundred  ten subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 2:1 fashion;  140 treated 
and 70 controls .  
 
a. Gender and Age of Subjects: Children will not be enrolled in this trial, as the 
pediatric presentation of follicular lymphoma is extremely uncommon, and has a 
unique natural history. Both men and women ≥ [ADDRESS_191623] 45% women and 55% men, 
which is the approximate sex distribution for NHL in the Un ited States.   
 
b. Racial and Ethnic Origin:  At each participating center, we are not excluding any 
persons on the basis of racial background. The incidence of follicular lymphoma is 
highest in whites, followed by [CONTACT_121854] -Americans, then African -Americans; w ith

NOTE:  While we are collecting study serum at baseline, 25(OH)D values will not be released 
until study analysis.  We have chosen to not limit study participation based on baseline 
serum 25(OH)D levels for a wide variety of reasons, including: 1) The maximum 
25(OH)D level in our previous study of Follicular Lymphoma patients was 63 ng/ml46, 
minimizing our concern for potential toxicity with our chosen dose of 2000 IU daily; 2)

namely osteoporosis requiring prescription treatment; 3) 25(OH)D levels vary 
substantia lly by [CONTACT_165221]50; 4) 25(OH)D levels are also known to vary by [CONTACT_165222]50,62; 
5) our intention in designing this study is to be as inclusive as possible to maximize 
generalizability; and 6) Baseline 25(OH)D is an important potential effector mod ifier that 
we plan to evaluate in secondary analyses.  Moreover, we are planning to evaluate 
clinical calcium levels at [ADDRESS_191627]’s continued participation should be discussed with the principal investigator

 All enrolled patients will be strong ly encouraged to enroll in the LEO consortium study 
as well , and over 90% of eligible patients at the participating institutions are enrolling in 
this companion study.  Through the LEO consortium, tissue and blood from these 
patients will be banked for fut ure analyses; baseline epi[INVESTIGATOR_165197] -
up patient -reported outcome measures, including quality of life instruments will be 
collected.  Patient -reported quality of life is being captured longitudinally (baseline, 1, 2, 
and 3 years) via valid ated FACT -G and FACT -Lym instruments. LEO enrollment is not 
required for participation in the ILyAD study.

substantially in the modern therapeutic era, this disease is still characterized by a generally 
incurable clinical course.1,2  While follicular lymphoma (FL) prognosis is known to be 
influenced by [CONTACT_165216], modifiable prognostic and predictive factors for 
this disease in the modern trea tment era have been difficult to elucidate.  Other less common 
indolent non -Hodgkin lymphomas include marginal zone and small lymphocytic lymphomas, 
these often present in a similar fashion to follicular lymphoma, are treated in a similar way, 
and have sim ilar outcomes.3,[ADDRESS_191629] common presentation of indolent lymphomas in the [LOCATION_002] is “low tumor 
burden” di sease, defined as asymptomatic disease, non-bulky  lymphadenopathy, and no 
cytopenias, which is the subject of this study .  The inclusion criteria define this population.  
 
 To minimize risk of vitamin D therapy, patients with osteoporosis requiring prescrip tion 
treatment, known symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia (> normal), 
history of calcium -related nephrolithiasis, or creatinine > 1.5 X normal will be excluded.

 Study Procedures and Schedule  
 
At screening, patients will be reviewed for eligibility. A PET/CT scan is required within 8 weeks  
prior to beginning study drug. A physical exam should be pe rformed a nd local labs  drawn 
within 4 weeks to determine calcium and creatinine levels. LDH and hematology labs should 
be obtained as needed to determine FLIPI [INVESTIGATOR_165199]. Hepatitis B serology testing is strongly recommended as per institutional practice; 
patients who are positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen or core antibody will be allowed on 
study as long as appropriate prophylaxis measures are taken as per institutional practice.  
These will be documented on  the case report forms.

Vitamin D or Placebo will be dispensed through the URMC Clinica l Materials Services Unit 
(CMSU)  to the study sites .  Subjects will receive a 3 -month supply of medication, with 
instructions to take one capsule  daily.  If a dose is missed, it s hould be made up as soon as 
possible on the same day with a return to the normal schedule the following day.  If doses are 
missed  for a day (or several days), dosing should  restart at the usual dose without an  attempt 
to ‘make -up’ any missed doses. Empty bo ttles or  leftover capsul es should be returned at the  
next clinic visit. Rituximab or approved biosimilar will be administered as per institutional 
practice.

documented in the study REDCap database. Study drug can be shipped directly to subje cts 
as dictated by [CONTACT_5737], state or federal  guidance and/or local or subject preference.  CT scans 
will be performed (of C/A/P and neck if previously involved) annually at year 1, year 2 and 
year 3.  Calcium will be checked annually . If at any time calcium i s above  the institutional limit 
of normal *, patients will be taken off study  drug but should remain on study with assessments 
every 3 months for 3 years or until progression . 
 
*At the discretion of the investigator, albumin -correct ed calcium  or ionized cal cium result s may 
be used to confirm true hypercalcemia. If albumin -corrected  or ionized calcium levels exceed 
the laboratory reference range, the subject should be taken off  study drug as described above. 
Subjects may continue taking study drug if albumin -corrected or ionized calcium levels are 
within the normal laboratory reference range.

 Assessment of Subject Compliance    
Study drug will be  dispensed at  Day 1.  Subject s should  return all unused pi[INVESTIGATOR_165201].  W e will also be able to retrospectively assess compliance with 
vitamin D levels at 13 weeks, 12 months and end of study.  
 
 Data & Specimen Banking  for Future Research Use  
No samples will be stored or banked for future research.  
 
In accordance with the Nation al Institutes of Health Genomic Data Sharing policy, anonymized 
genomic sequence  data derived from saliva samples and tumor biopsies will be shared by 
[CONTACT_165226] , dbGaP,  a controlled -access 
data reposito ry funded by [CONTACT_4289] . Prior to submitting the data , direct  identifiers will be removed  
according to the standards set forth in the HHS Regulations for th e Protection of Human Subjects 
and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountabil ity Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule to ensure that 
the identities of research subjects cannot be readily ascertained with the data. A  random code 
will be assigned to the data  before sending it to the repository. The University of [COMPANY_002]ster will 
maintain the key to the code and study ide ntifiers . Controlled -access data in NIH -designated data 
repositories are made available for secondary research only after investigators have obtained 
Internal Review Board approval  to use the requested data for a particular project . The genotype 
data will be made publicly available no later than the date of initial publication . Consent to share 
the data  and future use of data  will be obtained from each subject with IRB approval and prior to 
submission to the dbGaP.  
 
 Genetic/Genomic Research Activities  
At ba seline, we will collect germline DNA in all patients with a saliva sample, using Orag ene DNA 
self-collection kits (DNA Genotek, Ottawa, Canada).  Whole exome sequencing will be conducted 
in the URMC Genomics Research Center.  Genomic DNA (gDNA) is extracte d from Saliva 
samples using the PrepIT -L2P purification kit (DNA Genotek).  Extracted gDNA is quantified by 
[CONTACT_165227] -iT assay (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA) and DNA quality determined 
with Agilent TapeStation 2200 (Agilent Technologies, Sa nta Clara, CA).  For SNP genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_8375], samples are processed using the GRC’s standard WES operating procedure utilizing 
SureSelectXT Whole Exome v5 (+UTRs) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) based on 
previously published methods. Briefly, 500ng  of genomic DNA is sheared with Covaris S2 
(Covaris, Woburn, MA) to an average peak size of 250bp followed by [CONTACT_165228], poly adenylation, 
ILyAD Trial     
Page 20 of 38 
Version Date: July 1, 2020  Illumina adaptor ligation, and purification with AmpureXP (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA).  Library 
amplification is car ried out with 250ng of purified DNA with 4 cycles of PCR followed by 
[CONTACT_165229] (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA).  Exome probe hybridization capture is 
performed per manufacturer’s protocols.  Exome target enriched samples are quantified using 
the Qu bit Flourometer (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) and library sizing is assessed with the high 
sensitivity Bioanalyzer 2100 DNA assay (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).  Whole exome 
libraries are normalized, pooled and 2x100 pair end sequencing is performe d with the HiSeq2500 
(Illumina, San Diego, CA).  
 
A subset of  up to 65 subjects with available banked formalin fixed paraffin  embedded  (FFPE) 
diagnostic  biopsy samples will be used to study whether vitamin D deficiency is correlated with a 
low immune tumor  infiltration pattern defined by [CONTACT_4002] -L2 expression and RNA sequencing, and 
whether this is a biomarker  of response to supplementation .  RNA will b e isolated  using RNeasy 
FFPE RNA purification kit (Qiagen) and quality control will be performed using Bioanaly zer 2100 
RNA assay (Agilent Technologies) to determine  quality and quantity.  S amples will be analyzed 
for PD -L2 expression using a Taqman real -time assay in combination with several endogenous 
control targets with qPCR (Thermofisher).  Preliminary analysi s will be conducted by [CONTACT_165230] -delta -Ct analysis as well as with using the HTqPCR R package to 
determine statistically significant PD -L2 relative expression between low vs high vitamin D. RNA 
sequencing (RNA -Seq) will be us ed to measure lymphoma relevant gene expression as well as 
genes expressed in immune infiltrating cells, macrophages and stro mal cells . This panel will 
include immune effector (CD137, CD4, CD7, TNF -alpha) immune checkpoint (PD -1, PD -L1, PD -
L2, TIM3, FOXP3)  and macrophage (CD68) molecules. Total RNA will be subjected to ribosomal 
RNA depletion rather that polyA enrichment using TruSeq Total RNA -Seq library (Illumina, Inc.).  
Illum ina libraries will be sequenced  on the NovaSeq [ADDRESS_191640] enrichment analysis.  To 
determine gross diversity for the infiltrating immune cells we will use CIBERSORT63 to identify 
and characterize the immune populations from the bulk RNA -Seq data.  We will focus on the 
genes that are predictive of immune infilt ration, such as known genes representing cytotoxic T -
cells, tumor associated macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic  cells.  
 
Up to 12 samples  ([ADDRESS_191641] decile of 
Vitamin D levels ) will be selected for  additional  gene expression analysis  by [CONTACT_165231] . 
Slide -mounted tissue sections will be incubated with morphology markers and a cocktail of high -
plex oligo -labeled RNA probes corresponding to over 1600 immune -oncology RNA targets 
(Cancer Transcript ome Atlas , NanoString Technologies ). This new high -plex RNA expression 
profiling panel provides a more informed view of the cancer transcriptome, with particular 
attention to immune -oncology b iology . The morphology markers allow the generation of a 
fluorescent image of the tissue morphology to guide region of interest selection. After imaging 
the slides, regions of interest (ROI) are selected. ROIs are exposed to ultraviolet illumina tion, 
leading to release of oligos into the aqueous layer above the tissue slice. The oligos are collected 
via microcapi[INVESTIGATOR_165202] a microtiter plate. Oligos are 
hybridized to optical barcodes to permit digital qua ntification of analytes from the selected ROIs. 
Digital counts are incorporated into the image data for each ROI to create highly multiplexed, 
spatially resolved expression datasets.  
 
We will identify malignant B cells from microenvironmental cells using p rotein and gene 
expression profiles. The cellular composition of the non -malignant microenvironment will be 
characterized in the scanned slides using de novo clustering procedures recently developed and 
describe d for single cell RNAseq data. We will explor e spatial relationships of each cell

The patient  and/or their health plan/insurance company will need to pay for some or all of the 
costs of treating their cancer in this study.  Rituximab is commercially available.  All restaging and 
follow -up assessment s are standard of ca re, and therefore, taking part in this study will not cost 
the patient or their insurance company more than the cost of getting regular cancer treatment.  
 
Administration of the study drug (cholecalciferol or placebo) will be  provided free of charge.  The 
parts of the research consisting of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_165203] , central study drug assays, saliva

 SAFETY AND REPORTABLE EVENTS  
 
 Adverse Event Definition  
An adverse event is any symptom, s ign, illness, or experience which develops or worsens during the 
course of the study, whether or not the event is considered related to study drug.  
 
 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is defined as any adverse medical experience that results in  any of the 
following outcomes:  
 death;  
 is life -threatening;  
ILyAD Trial     
Page 23 of 38 
Version Date: July 1, 2020   requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
 requires medica l or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.  
 
 Recording Adverse Events  
At each subject visit the site study staff will assess adverse events by [CONTACT_165236].  At each study visit, the subject 
should be questioned directly regarding the occurrence of any adverse experience since his/her last 
visit.   
 
All adverse events, whether observed by [CONTACT_737], elicited from or volunteered by [CONTACT_423], 
should be documented.  Each adverse event will include a brief description of the experience, the date 
of onset, the date of resolution, the duration and type of experience, the severity, the relationship to 
investigational product (i.e., drug or device), contributing factors, and any action taken with respect to 
the study drug/device.  
 
The following attribution scale will be used:  
 
- Definite: AE is clearly related to the investigational agent  
- Probable: AE is likely related to the investigationa l agent  
- Possible: AE is possibly related to the investigational agent  
- Unlikely: AE is doubtfully related to the investigational agent  
- Unrelated: AE is clearly not related to the investigational agent  
 
Adverse events, both serious and non -serious, and  deaths that occur during the patient’s study 
participation will be recorded in the source documents and in the REDCap database. Laborato ry 
abnormalities determined  to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_165237].  
Events will be mo nitored from the first dose of study treat ment until 30 days following the completion 
of study  dosing  or withdraw al from participation. All SAEs should be monitored until they are resolved 
or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chroni c condition or intercurrent 
illness(es).  
 
 Responsibilities for Re porting  Adverse Events  
All serious adverse events sh ould be reported in the REDCap d atabase within [ADDRESS_191645] will review these reports and  
determine if further action is required.  
 
Serious Adverse Events that are determined to be  related AND unexpected re quire expedited reporting  
to the REDCap database in addition to notificati on by [CONTACT_20143] : [EMAIL_3336] .  
 
The Coordinating Center  will report these events to the DSMB in addition to send ing a formal 
notification describing the  event  to all investigators. Eac h investigator must then notify h is or her IRB 
of the  event according to local regulations .

We have carefully selected the 2,000 IU daily dose of cholecalciferol to maintain a substantial margin 
of safety below the upper level of intake (4,000 IU) at which point the potential risks for harm begin to 
increase.  However, to ensure safety of continued supplementation, calcium levels will be checked at

vitamin D or placebo.  A DSM B will be charged with ensuring safety of patients enrolled on this trial.   
 
Saliva samples for DNA analysis and FFPE tumor biopsy samples  for gene expres sion will be labeled 
with study number only, and will be kept in a locked lab.  Although there are presently no known medical 
conditions associated with the genetic polymorphisms under study, participants will be informed during 
the informed consent proces s that they will not receive the results of this genetic testing  or the gene 
expression , nor will the results be entered into their medical record.  
 
 Potential Benefits to Subject  
Subjects enrolled in this trial have the potential of receiving vitamin D sup plementation.  If they are 
vitamin D insufficient at study entry, we anticipate that they will reach sufficiency with the 
supplementation doses provided.   This could  benefit their bone health, and should our hypothesis 
prove true, these subjects will also  enjoy an improved progression -free survival period.  There will be 
no financial compensation of subjects for participation in this research.  
 
 Alternatives to Participation  
Patients are eligible for standard of care treatment regardless of whether they pa rticipate in this study , 
which may include observation without therapy, or single agent rituximab treatment, as per enrolling 
physician .  
 
 CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA AND INFORMATION STORAGE  
 
Study specific forms within RED Cap will be used for web -based data m anagement.   Information abstracted 
from patient care records is obtained for research purposes only.  Privacy is maintained by [CONTACT_165239], which require formal review by [CONTACT_165240].  Procedures are in place for maintaining confidentiality of all 
information collected as part of this study.  Access to medical records and the REDCap study database is 
limited to the investigative staff.  Data are managed by [CONTACT_165241].  
All reports are of a summary nature and no individual patients are identified.  Non -computerized medical 
records are kept in a locked filing cabinet.  Access to personal identifiers is based on a “need to know” 
basis, and this access is reviewed and documented by [CONTACT_165242].  In order to maintain the treatment 
blind, only one staff statistician at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster and the study drug allocation team at URMC 
CMSU will be aware of treatment assignment . 
 
11.1. Data Management Procedures  
CRF completion guidelines for eCRF data entry will be provided. Study  specific data management 
procedures will be maintained in the data management plan. Queries resulting from edit checks and/or 
data verification proced ures will be posted electronically in the eCRF.  
 
11.2. Access to Source Data  
The investigator will permit the PI [INVESTIGATOR_165205] e satisfactory. 
Appropriate measures to protect patient confidentiality are to be employed during monitoring. The 
CRFs and related source documents will be reviewed in detail by [CONTACT_165243]. Original 
source documents or certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_165206]. This review includes inspection of data 
acquired as a requirement for participation in this study and other medical records as required to 
confirm information contained in the CRFs, such as past history, secondary diagnoses, disease 
assessment records, adverse events, and concomitant medications. Other study records, such as 
correspondence with the sponsor and the IRB/IEC and screening and drug accountability logs will also 
be inspected. All source data and study records must also be available for inspection by

11.3. Accuracy and Reliability of Data  
Steps to be taken to assure the accuracy and reliability of data include:  
• The selection of qualified investigators and appropriate  study centers.  
• Review of protocol procedures with the investigators and associated personnel prior to the study.  
• Remote monitoring where permitted by [CONTACT_165245] . 
• CRFs will be reviewed for accuracy and completeness by [CONTACT_165246] r(s) 
• Any discrepancies will be resolved with the investigator or designees as appropriate.  
 
11.4. Data Handling  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of 
the data reported  in the CRFs and in all required reports. Data reported on the CRF that is derived 
from source documents should be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies should 
be explained. Any change or correction to a CRF will be maintained in an audit trail within t he electronic 
data capture system. Data handling procedures for this trial have been designed to permit data 
changes so that they are documented by [CONTACT_165247]. Data changes may only be made by [CONTACT_165248].  
 
11.5. Investigator Record  Retention  
The investigator shall retain stud y drug disposition records  and all source documentation  (such as  
laboratory reports, inpatient or office patient records) for the maximum period required by [CONTACT_165249] . If the investigator withdraws from the study (due 
to relocation, retirement, etc.), the records shall be transferred .

 DATA ANALYSIS AND MONITORING  
 
 Sample Size  Determination  
We expect 70% of our enrolled patients to have follicular lymphoma, and 30% to have other indolent 
subtypes; based upon results of RESORT we estimate the 3 -year event -free survival (EFS)  in our 
contro l arm to be 40%. We hypothesize that cholecalciferol  supplementation will reduce the relative 
hazard of lack of response, progression or death by 45%. For our planned study, HR = 0.55 
corresponds with an increase in 3 -year EFS from 40% to 60.41%.  Assum ing a 10% loss to follow -up, 
a 2:1 randomized trial with 14 0 patients in the treated  group  and 70 patients receiving placebo , or a 
total of 210 randomized patients (with an expected 88 events, 50 and 38 respectively), provides 81% 
power to detect HR = 0.55 at  a two -sided α = 0.05 significance level. As HR ranges from 0.50 -0.60 
(and 3 -year EFS varies from 57.71 -63.25 in the treatment arm), power varies from 69 -90%.  
 
 Planned Statistical Analysis  
Lack  of response to treatment at week 13  (time of the first respons e assessment) will be counted as 
an event , as will initiation of a new treatment, and thus the term event -free survival (EFS) more 
accurately describes the primary endpoint and will be used in place of progression -free survival (PFS). 
Event -free survival w ill be defined as the time from randomization to  an event of progression , death , 
no response to treatment at week 13, or initiation of a new treatment in the absence of progression. 
EFS will be  right-censored by [CONTACT_165250] -up. The primary anal ysis will include all treated 
subjects, data will also be  analyzed in an intent -to-treat fashion.  P FS and EFS over three years are 
ILyAD Trial     
Page 28 of 38 
Version Date: July 1, [ADDRESS_191646] endpoint s for studies in indolent lymphoma, and PFS is the  endpoint which resulted in the 
approval of rituximab ma intenance in the high tumor burden setting of this disease.64 Randomization 
in our trial will be stratified by [CONTACT_165251] -IPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005]47 within FL, resulting in 3 strata: FL -
high, FL -intermediate/low, non -FL. Within each stratum, participants will be 2 :1 block -randomized with 
random block sizes to maintain  treatment:control balance and preserve blinding. Since participants will 
be monitored by [CONTACT_165252] [ADDRESS_191647] ratio (HR) for treatment would be expected to be biased toward the 
null value of 1, since a standard continuous time Cox model would inappropriately use random ordering 
of progressions and deaths between monitoring times that would be a function of the random visit dates 
for each participant. The primary analysis will be based on a stratified grouped relative risk (Cox) model, 
stratified by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_191648] functions for FL -
high, FL -intermediate/low, and non -FL. This offers a stronger adjustment than a parametric adjustment 
for the strata, as the proportional hazards assumption is relaxed.   
 
Although it is unnecessary t o adjust for covariates in a randomized clinical trial, and thus it is also not 
critical to optimally model their functional forms, precision and power can be improved by [CONTACT_165253]. The primary histology -strati fied grouped Cox model will 
be further parametrically adjusted for the following 2 covariates: enrolling site (5 -df for 6 sites) and 
participant age at randomization ([ADDRESS_191649]). Given the planned 
parametric adjustment for pre-specified covariates, inference will be based on the robust sandwich 
estimator of variance, in order to guarantee control of the Type I Error rate, even if the model is 
misspecified. The primary analysis will be based on a [ADDRESS_191650] 95% confidence interval (CI) and associated robust Wald  p-value 
will be reported. As a secondary analysis, th e histology -stratified grouped Cox model will also be fit 
without any parametric adjustments for site or age, with no need for a robust sandwich estimator of the 
variance of the treatment effect. The likelihood ratio test of the treatment effect from this reduced model 
is thus asymptotically equivalent to a stratified logrank test but with the advantage that the model also 
yields an estimated HR along with 95% CI. Kaplan -Meier EFS curves by [CONTACT_165254] a graphical summary, recognizing th at they fail to account for strata or covariates, and thus do not 
correspond directly with the primary analysis model. EFS data will not be coarsened to 3 -month 
intervals for the purposes of Kaplan -Meier curve estimation.  
 
Secondary endpoints will include  response at 13 weeks (binary), and overall survival (time from 
randomization to death from any cause, right -censored by [CONTACT_165255] -up).  Planned subset 
analyses will include correlative endpoints by [CONTACT_7631] (see below) , and a subset analysis of patients 
with follicular lymphoma.  Additional planned subset analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_4321] (given some 
data on differential outcome by [CONTACT_4321]66 in follicular lymphoma treated with rituximab), and based u pon 
vitamin D status and PTH levels, detailed below . 
 
Correlative study: Vitamin D and PTH:  
Starting with the grouped histology -stratified Cox model used to test for treatment effect in Aim 1, 
adjusted for site and age, we will further adjust for baseline Vitamin D level and its interaction with 
treatment. Baseline vitamin D level will be modeled via a parametric cubic spline with [ADDRESS_191651] 10 -df more than the prima ry analysis model. We will plot the estimated HR for treatment 
as a function of baseline vitamin D level, along with pointwise 90% robust confidence intervals (CI; 
Figure 4) so we will have 95% confidence that the true HR falls below the upper bound. Basel ine 
ILyAD Trial     
Page 29 of 38 
Version Date: July 1, 2020  vitamin D levels for which the estimated treatment HR > [ADDRESS_191652] effective. Baseline vitamin D levels for which 
the entire 90% robust CI (95% upper bound) for t he treatment HR < [ADDRESS_191653] effective. Since it is possible that 
the treatment effects depend more on achieved rather than baseline vitamin D level, we will repeat 
these analyses at 13 -weeks.  As an alternative, lower order (pi[INVESTIGATOR_165207], linear, and constant) 
splines will be explored in secondary analyses since they might improve stability via reduction in 
parameters from [ADDRESS_191654] imated for those 
with PTH values in the normal range. Rather than fit separate models to each subgroup (which 
implicitly allows interactions of baseline PTH with all variables in the model), the primary analysis 
model will be enriched by [CONTACT_165256] r for baseline PTH > ULN, along with its interaction with 
treatment, resulting in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_165208] (histo) spline model with a single knot. This dichotomous 
interaction model will have just 2 -df more than the primary analysis model. The HR for treatmen t in 
elevated and normal baseline PTH groups will be reported ( along with robust  90% CI) and compared 
via a 0.[ADDRESS_191655] of interaction.  We will also plot the HR for treatment as a 
function of all possible dichotomization thresholds, a nd display the HR corresponding to subgroups 
excluding low PTH (in one graph) and excluding high PTH (in a separate plot), for all definitions of 
“low” and “high”.  Nominal robust 90% CI will be plotted to depi[INVESTIGATOR_165209]. 
 
Correlative study: Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_165210] 
D related genetic variants will be considered: 1) VDR BsmI: W/W: 0, W/V:1, V/V:2; 2) VDR TaqI: W/W:0, 
W/V:1, V/V:2; 3) VDR F okI W/W: 0, W/V:1, V/V:2; 4) DBP phenotype: DBP1F:0, DBP2:1, DBP1S:2. 
As is common in many SNP analyses, we plan to assume the additive model structure, whereby [CONTACT_165257] (0,1,2) genetic variant will be modeled linearly in the log -hazard. This implicitl y assumes that 
the HR for 2 vs. 1 is identical to the HR for 1 vs. 0, and thus the HR for 2 vs. 0 is the square of that for 
1 vs. 0. By [CONTACT_165258] 1 -df on the functional form of the genetic variant, and estimating a common 
“per allele” HR, we will maxim ize power for genetic variants for which (a) the additive assumption is at 
least approximately true or (b) there are very few subjects at level 2 (so the additive assumption is 
nearly indistinguishable from the dominant model comparing 0 vs. 1+). The inter action of treatment 
with each genetic variant will be modeled similarly with [ADDRESS_191656] of the treatment indicator 
and the count (treated as if it were continuous).  
 
The primary histology -stratified grouped relative risk model from Aim 1, adjus ted for site and age, will 
be enriched by [CONTACT_165259] (measured by [CONTACT_165260] -matrix). This genetic variant main -effect model will have [ADDRESS_191657] one of the four genetic variants. This testing paradigm is more efficient and 
powerful than separately testing each interaction term and then Bonferroni -correcting the four separate 
p-values for multiple comparisons, as it accounts for dependence between variants. But if we find 
ILyAD Trial     
Page 30 of 38 
Version Date: July 1, [ADDRESS_191658] 90% CI. This is analogou s to our investigation in Aim 2.  Moreover, 
we will also compare EFS by [CONTACT_165261] N=140 treated patients, using a grouped relative 
risk model, replacing the treatment indicator by [CONTACT_165262].  
 
Furthermore, we plan to perform whole exome sequencing (WES) and apply specializations of the 
Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT) to explore effects of additional variants.  Variants of interest 
in a region (e.g. a gene) are combined through a kernel function and then related to outcome s. While 
the kernel provides flexibility in choosing how variants are related to outcome s, the optimal kernel 
depends on the true, unknown nature of the underlying biology. Therefore, we will use multi -kernel 
SKAT (MK -SKAT), which controls the Type I error while mai ntaining high power by [CONTACT_165263]; this approach has been shown to be useful in smaller WES studies. 
These SKAT -based methods could identify potentially meaningful genes worthy of further study.  
 
Correlative study: Tumo r Gene Expression   
The primary aim of the tumor gene expression study  is to assess the relationship between vitamin D 
level at baseline and PD -L2 (as a marker of immune infiltration) . The outcome will be continuous PD -
L2 (possibly transformed, e.g. by [CONTACT_26500]), linearly modeled as function of co ntinuous baseline Vitamin D. 
The first step will be to estimate the density of each variable using kernel density estimators. If the 
distribution of PD -L2 appears strongly skewed, PD -L2 will be transformed (e.g. via log or square root) 
to a more approximat ely symmetric distribution. Vitamin D levels are expected to be approximately 
normal, but that will be investigated as well, and transformations considered. Following potential data 
transformation, the relationship between the variables will be visualized using a scatterplot with the 
least squared line superimposed. Inference will be based on a [ADDRESS_191659] of correlat ion. A 
sample size of 56 (50 -65) patients with complete data will provide 85% (80 -90%) power to detect R2 = 
15% (NCSS PASS v15) . 
 
We conjecture that we will be able to identify malignant B cells from healt hy cells using protein and 
gene  expression profiles  in the spatial genomics analysis .  We will characterize the cellular com position 
of non -malignant cells  in the scanned slides usi ng de novo clustering procedures developed for single 
cell RN A-Seq data. We will explore spatial relations hips of each cell subpopulation  by [CONTACT_165264].  We will explore spatial correlation between cell 
subpop ulations using spatial cross -correlograms.  
 
 
 Data and Safety Monitoring  
For the current randomized double blind Phase III trial, we have assembled an independent Data and 
Safety Monitoring Board and will follow the  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) acc ording to the 
procedure guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_165265] .  The DSMP 
and DSM B procedure guidelines are designed to a dhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) based on 
Code of Federal Regulations, FDA policy, International Conference on Harmonization guidelines, and 
institutional RSRB policies.  Compliance with GCP ensures that safety of human subjects is not 
compromised, th e study is carefully conducted, protocol is strictly adhered to, and adverse events are 
properly reviewed and reported.  According to GCP guidelines, responsibility for the protection of 
human subjects and proper conduct of clinical trials is shared among the principal investigator, clinical 
trial sponsor, institutional RSRB, and the independent DSMB.   
 
 
ILyAD Trial     
Page 31 of 38 
Version Date: July 1, 2020  Overall Framework for Safety Monitoring  
 
Regular assessment of data quality (audit reports and accrual progress reports) and toxicities will enable 
the DS MB to assess whether significant risks are occurring that would warrant study closure.  Study 
progress reports will be reviewed to determine whether accrual projections are being met and to determine 
if the trial should be continued based upon the likeliho od of timely completion. Cumulative reports of 
adverse events including SAE’s previously reported for expedited review and any new serious or non -
serious adverse event are also reviewed.  Discussion of these results will be held during a closed session 
of the DSMB Meetings in order to maintain confidentiality.    
 
 Data Quality Control:   We will utilize both auditing/quality assurance review and review of accrual and 
cumulative events to ensure that our patient data are of the highest quality. Reports of th ese quality control 
activities will be reviewed in monthly meetings with the study PI, study manager, and study statistician, 
and will also be submitted and discussed at the semi -annual DSMB meetings.  These two reports will also 
be submitted with recommen dations for follow -up or corrective action to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_165211]. The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_165212], communicates as needed with the study sites, implements corrective action, and 
notifies the Chair of the DSMB of these actions.  
 
Internal Audit / Quality A ssurance Review:  Data monitoring assures the quality of study execution at the level 
of the investigator.  The primary objective of our trial audit plan is to verify the accuracy of the data by 
[CONTACT_165266].  We will be subject to review from 
our local URMC Research Subjects Review Board.  In addition, our study team (the program manager) 
will be responsible for auditing the participating sites, in person, once each during the three -year 
recruitment p eriod. The audit procedure is a formal, comprehensive, source document review.  Ten percent 
or a minimum of 3 charts from each site will be selected for review in advance of the audit visit. The audit 
will be scheduled at a mutually agreed upon time.  The following elements will be reviewed:  
 
1. Source document verification of eligibility, response, treatment compliance, and toxicity.  
2. Regulatory review of IRB compliance and external reporting requirements.  
3. Drug accountability and handling.  
4. Complete ness and quality of data.  
5. Compliance with reporting procedures (including adverse events requiring expedited 
reporting).            
      
In advance of the visit, each participating sites will prepare for the scheduled audit by [CONTACT_165267].  The following items are considered (but not limited to) 
source documentation:  
 Inpatient and outpatient medical records (progress notes, diagnostic reports, laboratory data, 
etc. 
 Study flow sheets, data forms that ar e signed and dated where indicated  
 Appointment books, calendars  
 Enrollment tracking forms  
 Subject diaries, calendars  
 Drug dispensing logs  
 Informed consents and IRB documents (including initial IRB study approval, annual re -
approvals with study progress rep orts, study amendment approvals, etc.)

storage and records.  All records regarding the disposition of investigational study agents (including co pi[INVESTIGATOR_165213], return receipts and the NCI Drug Accountability Records) must be made available to the audit 
team.  
 
The auditors will review specific data related to the research and regulatory requirements.  The 
exercise will consist of reviewing and  evaluating:  
 conformance to IRB and informed consent requirements  
 the pharmacy and use of NCI Drug Accountability Record Forms  or the institutional equivalent  
 individual patient cases.  
 
At the conclusion of the audit visit, the audit team will conduct an exit interview with the responsible 
investigator(s) and staff. Preliminary findings will be discussed and recommendations made.  This interview 
allows an opportunity for immediate feedback and/or clarification of any deficiencies found by [CONTACT_77811].  
 
Where permitted the program manager  may be granted remote access to subject electronic medical records. 
Source document review and data verification will be performed remotely in addition to the in -person visit.

relative risks and complexity of our clinical trial.   
 
Interim Analysis : No interim analyses are planned for this trial, and there is no planned sample size re -
estimation.  
 
Individuals and Groups Responsible for Trial Monitoring  
a) PI: [INVESTIGATOR_165215], review AE an SAE grading 
and attribution, and will communicate all DSMB recommendations to the pa rticipating sites.  
b) Trial Manager: will be responsible for daily accrual and safety monitoring, preparing 
summary reports for DSMB meetings (together with the statistician), and monitoring of data 
and regulatory integrity through site audits.  
c) Data and Safet y Monitoring Board: Monitoring activities will be conducted by [CONTACT_165268].  We have 
assembled a Board which includes clinical trials experts, a biostatistician, and clinician s 
knowledgeable about the disease and treatment under study.   All members are from outside 
the institution.  Members will be tasked with viewing themselves as representing the interest 
of patients and not that of the institutions.  Investigators directly i nvolved with the conceptual 
design or analysis of the particular trial will not serve on the DSMB.

response  
(all of the following)  
Lymph nodes and  
extralymphatic sites  Score 1, 2, or 3 with or without a residual mass 
on 5-point  scale.  
 
It is recognized that in Waldeyer’s ring or 
extranodal sites with high physiologic uptake or 
with activation within spleen or marrow (eg, 
with c hemotherapy or myeloi d colony -
stimulating factors), uptake may be greater 
than normal mediastinum and/or liver. In this 
circumstance, complete metabolic response 
may be inferred if uptake at sites of initial 
involvement is no greater than surrounding 
normal tissue even if the tissue has high 
physiologic uptake.  
 Target nodes/nodal masses must regress

assay approach will be used for the detection of 
binding and neutralizing antibodies to AGN -
151607 in human serum. In tier 1, serum samples will be screened using a validated 
enzyme-l inked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 
The positive samples will subsequently be 
immune depleted to confirm that the antibodies were specifically binding to AGN -151607 and 
then titered to assess the magnitude of antibodies 
present. In tier 2, only samples that  are 
considered positive in the ELISA will be tested 
for neutralizing antibodies to AGN -151607 using

Brief Title : Botulinum toxin type A (AGN-151607) for the prevention of post- operative atrial 
fibrillation in patients undergoing open- chest cardiac surgery  
Study Rationale : 
Post- operative atrial fibrillation ( POAF ) occurs at high rates despi[INVESTIGATOR_31740]-of- care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_522732], eg, medical/procedural interventions, extended 
length of stay in the intensive care unit ( ICU) and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Nonclinical 
studies have demonstrated that injections of botulinum toxin type A into discrete regions of the heart can  prevent atrial fibrillation ( AF) and [ADDRESS_678091] demonstrated that botulinum 
toxin type A injections can prevent POAF with no noted safety issues.

CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 1925-201-[ADDRESS_678118]-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. 
AGN-151607 will be injected intraoperatively into discrete targets of the heart, namely the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_522736]. The administration  of AGN-151607 is 
intended to neuromodulate the ganglionic plexi in these regions, thus lower ing the risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_335911]. 
Atrial fibrillation  (AF) is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with uncoordinated atrial activation 
and, consequently, ineffective atrial contraction ( January 2014). Characteristics on an 
electrocardiogram (ECG) include:  
1) Irregular R -R intervals  
2) Absence of distinct P waves  
3) Irregular atrial activity   
AF is a common complication of cardiac surgery, occurring post- operatively in  30% to 60% of 
patients undergoing coronary artery by[CONTACT_8053]/or cardiac valve surgical procedures, with an 
unchanged incidence over past decades ( Mostafa  2012).  
POAF is associated with recurrent AF, longer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959] (including in intensive- care 
settings), increased healthcare costs (in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212052]-discharge), higher risk of stroke, and 
increased mortality ( Arsenault 2013; Kertai 2014; LaPar 2014; Mathew 2004); all of which 
reflect an increased clinical burden due to POAF, including the need for medical/procedural interventions.  
Cardiac surgery via median sternotomy (open-chest or “open- heart” surgery) yields access to the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_522728], ie, the cardiac autonomic ganglionic plexi, which contain a rich network of 
nerves. These autonomic nerves have been targeted in several, customarily used ablative 
procedures to attenuate AF , both post-operative and more broadly. Surgical and catheter- based 
interventions (eg, ablations, surgical excisions of tissue) of the autonomic nervous tis sue near the 
left atrial ostia of the pulmonary veins, including the epi[INVESTIGATOR_522728], have demonstrated positive results in the prevention of recurrent AF ( Katritsis  2011; Katritsis  2013; 
Pokushalov 2013; Gillinov 201 6). 
Based on 1) the effectiveness of ablative and surgical intervention on cardiac autonomic nerve foci, 2) the general safety of these procedures involving tissue disruption, and 3) a goal to avoid 
permanent destruction of cardiac tissue, temporary neuromodulation has been hypothesized to be an effective approach as preventative therapy of POAF in cardiac surgery patients. Pursuant to 
this hypothesis, several recent nonclinical and clinical studies were performed, showing that 
neuromodulation with botulinum toxin type A, injected into discrete epi[INVESTIGATOR_522737]- chest surgery, reduces the incidence of POAF ( Tsuboi 2002; Oh 2010; Oh 2011; 
Pokushalov 2015; Lo  2016; Waldron 2019).  Nonclinical proof ‐of-concept studies have shown 
that injections of botulinum toxin type A into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_522738]- chest 
cardiac surgical procedure, and using a rapid atrial pacing model of atrial arrhythmia, led to

2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are at a high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_335911] . POAF  is associated 
with a number of negative outcomes, such as need for medical/procedural interventions, 
extended length of stay in the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Treatment with one- time 
injections of AGN-[ADDRESS_678119] potential for benefit. In addition, the injection of botulinum toxin type A into discrete epi[INVESTIGATOR_522739] 2 separate clinical trials, with up to 3 years of follow-up reported (Pokushalov 2015; Waldron 2019; Romanov 2019).  Injections of AGN-[ADDRESS_678120] -marketing experience with 
BOTOX. BOTOX experience is considered relevant to the current program, having a similar dose range and other similarities with AGN -151607, as outlined in the IB.  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and expected AEs  of 
AGN-151607 may be found in the IB.

Objectives  Endpoints  
Tertiary/Exploratory  
 

CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 1925-201-[ADDRESS_678150] (DSMB) will meet throughout the course of this 
study. 
4.1.1. Clinical Hypotheses  
Injection of AGN-[ADDRESS_678151]-of- care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as  
beta-blockers. P articipants who experience POA F during the trial will be treated as per 
investigator judgement and local standards of care. All medications and procedures will be 
recorded.  AF symptoms and quality of life outcomes will be collected through patient reported 
assessments.  
4.3. Justification f or Dose  
There are 2 doses of AGN -151607 which will be tested: [ADDRESS_678152] dose planned for this study is 250 U (50 U per epi[INVESTIGATOR_522741]) of AGN-151607. 
The dose was selected based on prior clinical experience. There have been [ADDRESS_678153] injected 50 U per fat pad of botulinum toxin type 
A (non- AGN-151607) in cardiac-surgery participants. One of these trials injected a total of 
250 U of BOTOX ( 50 U into 5 epi[INVESTIGATOR_522728]; Waldron 2019) and the other injected a total 
of 200 U of Xeomin (50 U into 4 epi[INVESTIGATOR_522728]; Pokushalov 2015; Romanov 2019).  In both 
studies, these doses were found to be sa fe and well -tolera ted. 
The lower dose planned for this study is 125 U (25  U per epi[INVESTIGATOR_522741]) of AGN -151607. 
This dose was selected to determine whether a lower dose would provide a similar efficacy and 
safety profile as the higher dose.  
4.4. End of Study  Definition  
The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study or last scheduled procedure shown in the schedule of activities (SoA , Section 1.3) for the last 
participant in the study globally . A participant is considered to have completed the primary and 
secondary efficacy part of the study if he/she has completed the Day 60 (Visit  9). A participant is 
considered to have completed the full study if he/she has completed the Day 367.

5.4. Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as participant s who consent to participate in the clinical study but are 
not subsequently randomly assigned to study intervention/entered in the study. A minimal set of 
screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure 
participant s to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials  (CONSORT) publishing 
requirements and to respond to queries from r egulatory authorities. Minimal in formation 
includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any AE . 
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failures ) may not 
be rescreened  unless authorized by [CONTACT_456].

6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability  
1. The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study intervention received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study intervention. 
2. Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study intervention, and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study intervention. All study intervention must be stored 
in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in 
accordance with the labeled  storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and 
authorized site staff . 
3. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation , and final disposition records).  
4. Further guidance and information for the pre- and intra-operative handling of study interventions, and for the final disposition of unused study interventions, will be provided by [CONTACT_456]. 
All unused study intervention and  used kits  should be returned to the sponsor or designee at the 
termination of the study. Unit counts will be performed when the study intervention is returned, and all study intervention must be accounted for. Accountability logs for destroyed materials 
should be maintained at the site to ensure all study intervention is accounted for. Study 
intervention may be destroyed on site if required by [CONTACT_5737]/institutional policies after sponsor approval of destruction process and documentation. 
Details on the reconstitution and handling of AGN-151607 can be found in the Pharmacy 
Manual . 
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
At screening, each participant who provides informed consent will be assigned a number that 
will serve as the participant identification number on all study documents.  
An automated Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) assigns the participant’ s identification 
number and th is will be used to manage the randomization and intervention  assignment based on 
a centralized randomization list prepared by [CONTACT_522775] s. The randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_654] (< 65, ≥ 65 years) and type of surgery (presence/absence of valve surgery). 
Within each stratification group, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the 
intervention groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. Before the study is initiated, the log-in information and 
instructions for the IWRS will be provided to each site. 
Investigators will remain blinded to each participant’s assigned study intervention throughout the 
course of the study.  
At each study site, a designated staff member will serve as the independent drug 
reconstitutor (IDR). This person will be responsible for study intervention preparation.  
The IDR will prepare the study intervention as described in  the Pharmacy Manual.  The 
investigator will inject the reconstituted study intervention according to the study intervention 
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 1925-201-[ADDRESS_678169] team personnel will be prohibited from accessing the unmasked interim results.   
Blinding is critical to the integrity of the clinical trial.  The IWRS will be programmed with 
blind-breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, the investigator has the sole responsibility 
for determining if unblinding of a participant’s study intervention assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the 
investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make every effort to 
contact [CONTACT_1152] a participant’s study intervention assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the participant. If a participant’s study intervention 
assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within [ADDRESS_678170] that specifies the amount of study 
intervention administered to each participant and the date of administration.  
6.5. Concomitant Therapy  
The use of any concomitant medication, prescription or over-the-counter, including vitamins, 
and/or herbal supplements, is to be recorded in  the participant’s  records at each visit along with 
the reason the medication is taken . 
6.5.1. Prohibit ed Interventions  and Washout Before the Study  
Participants must discontinue any of the medications listed in Table 6-2 for the specified period  
prior to  surgery . Other medications being used at screening may be continued. 
Table 6-2 Prohibited Medications with Required Washout Period 
Drug Class /Treatment  Washout Required Prior to Surgery

6.5.2. Permitted Interventions  
Any medication or vaccine (including over- the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, 
and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving at the time of enrollment or receives 
during the study must be recorded along with: 
• Indication 
• Dates of administration including start and end dates 
• Dosage information including dose, route of administration, and  frequency  
Therapy considered necessary for the participant’s welfare may be given at the discretion of the 
investigator. If the permissibility of a specific medication/intervention is in question, please contact [CONTACT_456]. 
The sponsor or designee should be contact[CONTACT_63193]. 
6.5.3. Rescue Medicine or Procedure  
There will be no rescue medication provided by [CONTACT_522776].  
Standard -of-care will be used at investigator discretion. The study site will supply medication s 
that will be obtained locally , eg, antiarrhythmics  drugs, anticoagulants (eg, anti -vitamin 
K agents , heparin) and rate-control medication  (eg, esmolol, me toprolol, diltiaz em). 
Standard -of-care is allowable at any time during the study. The date and time of any  medication 
administration , as well as the name, indication, and dosage regimen of the medication  (ie, dose, 
route of administration, and frequency), should be recorded. An intervention to treat an arrhythmia is allowed during follow-up as clinically warranted in the 
judgement of the treating physician and/or site-based investigator physician. 
6.5.4. Prohibited Interventions  During the Study  
Please refer to Section  6.5.1 for prohibited interventions during the washout period prior to 
surgery . 
Administration of aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission 
(eg, curare -like compounds) should only be performed with caution for [ADDRESS_678172]  one of the following 
outcomes prior to discharge: 
1) If treated with warfarin, participant must have achieved a target International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0 
2) If “bridged” with low molecular weight heparin, participant can be discharged with an INR of less than 2.0 
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 1925-201-008 Amendment 1

7. Discontinuation of Study Intervention and Particip ant 
Discontinuation/Withdrawal  
A premature discontinuation will occur if a participant who signs the ICF and is dosed ceases 
participation in the study, regardless of circumstances, before the completion of the protocol-defined study procedures. 
Notification of early participant discontinuation from the study and the reason for 
discontinuation will be made to the sponsor and will be clearly documented. 
The sponsor should be consulted in advance of withdrawal whenever possible. Every effort 
should be made to retain participants in the study until completion as much as possible. Participants who are withdrawn from the study may not be re-enrolled but will be asked to 
undergo all early withdrawal activities. Definitions of the standard terms are provided in 
Appendix 5, Section 10.5. 
Reasons for discontinuation from the study intervention and/or the study may include the 
following commonly used or other acceptable terms :

7.1. Discontinuation of  Study Intervention  
Not applicable for a one- time intervention. 
7.2. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
• A participant  may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator  for safety, behavioral, compliance, 
or administrative reasons. 
• If the participant  withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
• If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. The investigator should follow-up with the sponsor so that any samples can be destroyed .  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 1925-201-008 Amendment 1 
AGN-151607 
47 
• See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and follow-up and 
for any further evaluations that need to be completed. I n case of early discontinuation, 
attempts will be made to follow -up with the participant. 
7.3. Lost to Follow -up 
A participant  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298]. 
The following actions must be taken if  a participant fails to return to  the clinic for a required 
study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_78778] m issed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the participant  on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant  wishes to and/or should continue in the 
study. 
• Before a participant  is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635]  (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary , a certified letter to the pa rticipant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent 
methods). These contact [CONTACT_9145]’s medical record . 
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study.

8. Study Assessments and Procedures  
• Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA (Section 1.3).  
• Visits 4, 5, 6, and [ADDRESS_678173] to be performed each day until discharge. 
• Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. 
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the parti cipant should continue in the study.  
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required  for study conduct.  
• All screening evaluations  must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
partici pants meet all eligibility criteria.  
• Study visits after the index surgery may be conducted at the participant’s home or other 
designated location in accordance with local ethics and/or IRB regulations, as well as with 
sponsor approval.  
• Procedures conducte d as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, chest 
X-ray or echocardiography ) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for 
screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol- specified criteria and 
were performed within the time frame defined in the SoA. However, testing of blood samples (including during unscheduled visits or samples for which local laboratory values are already available) should be conducted by [CONTACT_2237].   
• Local laboratory results are required only in the event that the central laboratory results are 
not available in time for either study intervention administration and/or response evaluation. 
Local laborat ory results collected at the screening visit  can be used to determine participant’s  
eligibility  if central laboratory results are not available. If a local sample is required, it is 
important that the sample for central analysis is obtained at the same time. Additionally, if the local laboratory results are used to make either a study intervention decision or response evaluation, the results must be entered into the e CRF.

8.1.2. Primary Efficacy Assessments  
The primary efficacy assessment will measure the occurrence of POAF (ie, 30 -second cutoff for 
continuous AF) during the first  [ADDRESS_678180]-surgery ( Table 8-1).  
8.1.3. Secondary Efficacy Assessments  
Secondary endpoints will include assessments of the occurrence of POAF according to different 
definitions of AF (ie, different timing cutoffs for continuous AF), time to first occurrence of POAF,  percentage of time spent in A F (AF burden), and percentage of participants with at least 
[ADDRESS_678181]- surgery . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Percentage of Time Spent in Atrial Fibrillation  
ECG patches will continuously monitor for all occurrences and durations of AF through Day 30 
(Table 8-2 ). Based on this information, an analysis will measure the total time spent in AF 
divided by [CONTACT_522778]. The resulting calculation will represent the percent of time each part icipant has spent in AF during the first  [ADDRESS_678182]- surgery  (AF burden).

AF = atrial fibrillation; ECG = electrocardiogram  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Symptomatic Post-operative Atrial Fibrillation  
The occurrence of POAF is often associated with the onset of particular  symptoms, such as 
dizziness, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], and fatigue. All participants will be wearing ECG patches with the ability 
to mark the da te and time that a symptom is experienced by [CONTACT_458024] a button on the ECG 
patch itself ( Table 8-3).  While the participant is wearing the ECG patch , if symptoms of AF 
occur, the actual symptom will be documented by [CONTACT_522767] a symptom diary. Participants will be instructed by [CONTACT_522779].

when they experience a symptom and then log the symptom in a diary. The information will be used to identify cases of symptomatic POAF. 
AF = atr ial fibrillation; ECG = electrocardiogram; POAF = post -operative atrial fibrillation  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinically I mportant T achycardia in Atrial Fibrillation  
Clinically important tachycardia in AF is defined as heart rate ≥  [ADDRESS_678184] 2 minutes. 
The occurrence of clinically important tachycardia in AF is often associated with the need for 
pharmacologic or procedural interventions and is therefore likely to be associated with higher 
resources utilization. Evidence for c linically important tachycardia in AF will be acquired using 
ECG patches and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_522745]. 
8.1.4. Additional  Efficacy Assessments  
Additional efficacy endpoints will include assessments of the occurrence of POAF, time to first 
occurrence of POAF,  percentage of time spent in AF (AF burd en), and percentage of participants 
with at least one event of symptomatic AF , based on continuous monitoring of all occurrences of 
AF during the first 7 days following Day 60, Day 90, Day 180, Day 270 and Day 360 visits , as 
described in Section 8.1.1, and Section 8.1.3.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Need for Medical Intervention  
If POAF occurs in cardiac-surgery participants, it is at the discretion of the investigator whether 
to intervene with customary, accepted treatments of pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265]/or medical 
procedures ( Table 8-4).  Such interventions will be captured as additional endpoints, and will 
support assessing the potential burden caused by [CONTACT_522780].

Table 8-8 Patient Reported Outcomes  
Assessment  Timing  Measurement  
AFEQT  Screening, Day  30, 
Day 90, Day  180, (or 
early discontinuation if 
necessarya) • A questionnaire to assess Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) 
in patients with AF . AFEQT evaluates QoL across 3 domains: 
symptoms, daily activities and treatment concerns.  
The questionnaire uses 20 questions on a 7- point Likert scale to 
measure the overall AFEQT score and treatment satisfaction.  
• The estimated time to complete the AFEQT questionnaire is 
approximately 5 to 10 minutes.  
AFSS  Screening, Day  30, 
Day 90, Day  180, (or 
early discontinuation if 
necessarya)  • A self -reported, disease -specific quality of life instrument used to 
capture subjective and objective ratings of disease burden in patients with AF. The AFSS consists of 19 items . It contains a 
visual analogue scale, 4 items on AF frequency, duration and 
severity that are used to calculate AF burden, 4 items on health care 
utilization, and 7 items regarding the severity of specific symptoms .  
• The estimated time to complete the AFSS is 5 to 10 minutes.  
DASI  Screening, Day 30, Day 90, Day 180, (or early discontinuation if 
necessary
a) • A 12 -item, self -administered questionnaire which provides a 
standardized assessment of functional status that uses the patient’s ability to perform a set of common activities of daily living to gauge functional capacity.  
• The estimated time to complete the DASI questionnaire is approximately 5 minutes . 
EQ-5D-5L Screening, Day  30, 
Day 90, Day 180, (or 
early discont inuation if 
necessarya) • A standardized measure of health -related quality of life comprised 
of 5 dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort , and anxiety/depression. The scores on these 
5 dimensions can be converted to a single summary index number 
(utility) reflecting preferability compared to other health profiles.  
• The estimated time to complete the EQ -5D-5L questionnaire is 
approximately 5 minutes . 
SF-12v2  Screening, Day  30, 
Day 90, Day 180, (or early discontinuation if 
necessary
a) • A 12 -item, self -administered health survey standardized across age, 
disease, and treatment group to measure. Eight health domain scales 
contribute to the scoring of both the Physi cal and Mental 
Component Summary measures.  
• The estimated time to complete the SF- 12v2 questionnaire is 
approximately 5 to 10  minutes . 
AF = atrial fibrillation;  AFEQT = Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality -of-life Questionnaire; AFSS = University of Toronto

55 
8.2. Safety Assessments  
Planned timepoints for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA. 
8.2.1. Physical Examinations 
• A physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the cardiovascular, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal and neurological systems.  
• Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses.  
8.2.2. Vital Signs  
• BP and pulse measurements will be assessed in a resting  position with a completely 
automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available.  
• BP and pulse measurements should be preceded by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_678195] for t he 
participant in a quiet setting without distractions ( eg, television, cell phones). 
• Vital signs will be measured after [ADDRESS_678196] readings should be averaged to give the measurement to be recorded in the eCRF.  
8.2.3. Electrocardiogram s 
• Sites or designee shall transmit all study -required ECGs obtained to the ECG vendor. If 
multiple ECGs have been obtained for the same participant  on the same date, the first 
readable ECG shall be entered as the v isit ECG, and all others shall be entered as 
unscheduled. All readable ECGs received by [CONTACT_522781], 
cardiologist over- read. The sponsor will receive all ECG data, including vendor cardiologist 
assessments, in the data transfer, including those ECGs that could not be evaluated. 
• On Visit 2, Day 1, two  12-lead ECGs will be performed ; 1 before surger y and 1 after surgery . 
• A 12- lead ECG will be obtained in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662] -recumbent position as outlined in the 
SoA (see Section  1.3) using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and 
measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals.  
• The X- axis speed will be a standard 25 mm per second; the ECG tracing will be kept at the 
study site . Measurements will be recorded for the following parameters in lead II or lead III: 
heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and QTc. All ECGs will be clinically interpreted by [CONTACT_9940]-investigator.

8.2.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments 
• See Appendix 2, Section  10.2, for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and the 
SoA for th e timing and frequency. 
o The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRF. The 
laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying 
disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_522782]’s condition. 
• All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significant during participation in the study should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer 
considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_093]. 
o If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable 
by [CONTACT_093], the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified. 
o All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2, Section 10.2, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA. 
o If laboratory values from non-protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are 
considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_093] (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the e CRF.  
8.2.5. Pulmonary Function Testing  
Study part icipant pulmonary function will be assessed at the s creening visit and Day 30 using 
forced procedures and compared across all 3 study groups (refer to study reference guide ). Note, 
if local policies contraindicate or prohibit PFT assessments due to potential for viral spread or 
microbial precautions, then the PFT is not required after explicit approval from the sponsor. If 
PFT assessments are not prohibited by [CONTACT_427]/policies, then the PFTs should be 
conducted. 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_522755] c onducted by a pulmonologist, pulmonary technician, respi[INVESTIGATOR_375558], nurse, and/or other appropriate personnel trained in this procedure, following the 
American Thoracic Society (ATS) Standardization of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_487384] ( Miller, 2005). To 
demonstrate reproducibility of results, participants will be required to perform at least 3 acceptable spi[INVESTIGATOR_522756] a maximum of 8 attempts . The results of all respi[INVESTIGATOR_522757]. 
The assessments will include the following: 
1. Forced vital capacity (FVC) measured from a maximal forced exhalation  
2. Forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_12194] (FEV)  in 1 second (FEV
1), 3 seconds (FEV 3) and 6 seconds 
(FEV 6)

8.2.7. Immunogenicity Assessments  
Blood samples will be collected from all participants prior to dosing on Day 1 and at the Day 30 
and Day 90 follow-up visits. A 2- tier assay approach will be used for the detection of binding 
and neutralizing antibodi es to AGN-151607 in human serum. In tier 1, serum samples will be 
screened using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The positive samples will subsequently be immune depleted to confirm that the antibodies were specifically binding to 
AGN-151607 and then titered to assess the magnitude of antibodies present. In tier 2, only samples that are considered positive in the ELISA will be tested for neutralizing antibodies to AGN-151607 using a validated assay. 
Samples may be stored for a maximum of 2  years (or according to local regulations) following 
the last participant’s last visit for the study at a facility selected by [CONTACT_522783]-151607. 
8.3. Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 3, Section  10.3. 
AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_442335], when appropriate, by a caregiver. 
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following 
up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study intervention or study procedures, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study (see Section 7). 
8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse E vent and Serious 
Adverse E vent Information 
All AEs/ SAEs from the signing of the ICF until the Day  367 follow-up visit/ early 
discontinuation visit will be collected at the timepoints specified in the SoA (Section  1.3), and as 
observed or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_19288]. 
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study intervention, but after obtaining 
informed consent, will be recorde d as an AE.  
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in Appendix 3, Section  10.3. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor 
within 24 hours of it being available. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE information after conclusion of the 
study participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any 
time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. 
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3, 
Section  10.3. Assessment of causality to both the study intervention and the study procedures are 
required for reporting each SAE. For the purpose of causality assessment, “study procedure” on 
the SAE reporting form means the procedure of injecting the study intervention into the 
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 1925-201-008 Amendment 1 
AGN-151607 
58 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_522728]. It does not include any other study procedures (eg, the open -chest surgery 
and related procedures). Therefore, the check box on the SAE f orm titled “Causal Relationship to 
Study Procedure” should only be checked if, in the investigator’s judgement, the SAE was 
related to the in jection procedure into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_522728]. The cardiac surgery procedure that 
the study participant is undergoing ( eg, CABG and/or valve repair/replacement) and any other 
procedures the participants  may have during the study are NOT considered the s tudy procedure 
for the purpose of SAE reporting causality assessment . 
8.3.2. Method of Detecting A dverse E vents and Serious A dverse E vents 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences . 
8.3.3. Follow- up of Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
After the initial AE /SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs /SAEs and non- serious AEs of special interest (as defined 
in Section  8.3.6)] will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3).  
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_325740]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include 
additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  
If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow-up period, the investigator will provide the sponsor with a copy of any postmortem findings, if done, including histopathology. 
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed e CRF.  
The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of receipt of 
the information. 
8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
• Prompt notification by [CONTACT_522784] e safety of participants and the safety of a 
study intervention under clinical investigation are met. 
• The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements relat ing to safety 
reporting to the regulatory authority, institutional review board s (IRBs)s/independent ethics 
committee s (IECs) , and investigators. 
• Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R s) accor ding to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and 
forwarded to investigators as necessary. 
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 1925-201-008 Amendment 1 
AGN-151607 
59 
• An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE  or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs ) from th e sponsor will review 
and then file it along with the IB  and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to 
local requirements.  
8.3.5. Pregnancy  
• Details of all pregnancies in female participants and female partners of male participants will 
be collected aft er the start of study intervention and until Day  60. 
• If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 7, Section  10.7. 
• Abnormal pregnancy outcomes ( eg, spontaneous or elective abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
8.3.6. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AE  of special interest (AESI) for botulinum toxin type A, is possible distant spread of toxin 
(PDSOT). See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for further details.  
8.3.7. Medication Errors  
Medication error refers to any unintended error in the dosing and/or administration of the study intervention as per instructions in the protocol. Medication errors generally fall into 4 categories as follows: 
• Wrong study drug 
• Wrong dose (including dosing regimen, strength, form, concentration, amount) 
• Wrong route of administration  
• Wrong participant (ie, not administered to the intended participant) 
Medication errors include occurrences of overdose and underdose of the study intervention. 
Overdose: Unintentional administration of a quantity of the study intervention AGN-151607 
given per administration that is above the maximum recommended dose according to the 
protocol for the study intervention. An overdose for this study will be any dose of AGN-151607 exceeding the higher assigned dose specified in the protocol (ie, more than 250 U) 
Underdose: Unintentional administration of a quantity of the study intervention AGN-151607 
given per administration that is under the minimum recommended dose according to the protocol. An underdose for this study will be any dose of AGN -151607 less than the lower 
assigned dose specified in the protocol (ie, less than 125 U).  
8.4. Treatment of Overdose  
For this study, any dose of AGN-151607 greater than an assigned dose specified in the protocol will be considered an overdose. 
Sponsor does not recommend specific intervention  for an overdose.

In the event of an overdose, the investigator/treating physician should: 
1. Contact [CONTACT_8650].  
2. Closely monitor the participant for any AE /SAE and laboratory abnormalities. 
8.5. Pharmacokinetics  
PK parameters are not evaluated in this study. 
8.6. Pharmacodynamics  
PD parameters are not evaluated in this study. 
8.7. Genetics  
Genetics are not evaluated in this study. 
8.8. Biomarkers and Other Assessments  
Collection of samples for biomarker research is also part of this study. Blood samples will be 
collected from all participants  in this study as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). These samples 
will be used to test for immunogenicity and will also include biomarkers involved in the 
inflammatory process and in the autonomic nervous system. The biomarkers to be analyzed will 
be listed in the SAP.  
• Samples will be tested for  assessment of biomarkers  to evaluate their association with the 
observed clinical responses to study intervention. 
Samples may be stored for a maximum of 2 years  (or according to local regulations)  following 
the last participant’s last  visit for the study at a facility selected b y the sponsor to enable further 
analysis of biomarker responses to AGN-151607. 
8.9. Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economic s 
Medical resource utilization and health economics  parameters are evaluated in this study  
(Section  8.1.3 and Section  8.1.5). 
Medical resource utili zation and health economics  data, associated with medical encounters, will 
be collected by [CONTACT_70449]-site personnel or designee for all participants 
throughout the study. Protocol-mandated procedures, tests, and encounters are excluded.  
The data collected may b e used to conduct exploratory economic analyses and will include: 
• Number and duration of medical care encounters, including surgeries, and other selected 
procedures (inpatient and outpatient) 
• Duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (total days or length of stay, including duration by [CONTACT_54006] [eg, ICU]) 
• Healthcare resource utilization  (eg, setting, provider, reason for visit) 
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 1925-201-[ADDRESS_678197] or analysis of variance (ANOVA) techniques for compar isons between treatment 
groups, and paired t- tests for within -group comparisons. Ordinal variables will be analyzed using 
Wilcoxon rank-sum or Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) tests for pairwise comparisons 
between groups, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for w ithin-group comparisons. Time- to-event 
data will be analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models or the Kaplan- Meier nonparametric 
model. Nominal variables will be analyzed using Pearson's chi-square test or, if 25% or more of the cells have expected cou nts less than 5, Fisher's exact test. 
The analyses will include 3 treatment groups: Placebo, 125 U, and 250 U of AGN-151607. Each 
dose level of AGN-151607 (125 U and 250 U) will be separately compared to placebo. All  
treatment comparisons will be made at the α = 0.05 level (2-sided). To control for multiplicity in 
comparing [ADDRESS_678198] comparing the high dose to placebo. The low dose will be compared to 
placebo only i f the comparison to the high dose is found to be statistically significant. Details 
regarding adjustment for multiple comparisons for other efficacy variables will be discussed in the SAP.   
9.2. Sample Size Determination  
A sample size of 100 randomized particip ants per intervention group will provide approximately 
80% power to detect the treatment difference between each of the AGN -151607 doses (assumed 
equally effective) and placebo for the primary efficacy endpoint. The power calculations are based on the following assumptions: 
• The expected incidence of early postoperative AF within [ADDRESS_678199]-surgery will be 47.8% in the placebo group and 27.8% in each of the AGN-151607 groups. This assumption is based on the results observed in the Pokushalov study ( Pokushalov 2015) and the Duke 
University  Medical Center clinical trial discussed in Section  2 (Waldron  2019) .  
• Two-sided Mantel -Haenszel test statistic and a significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_678200].  
Calculations will be performed using commercial software PASS 2008 ( Hintze 2008).  
Assuming that approximately 10% in each intervention group will drop out early from the study, a total of approximately [ADDRESS_678201] of participants as defined  below : 
• The modified intent- to-treat (mITT) population will consist of all randomized participants 
who received study intervention and had at least [ADDRESS_678202]- surgery . 
Analyses will be based on randomized intervention . 
• The safety population will consist of all participants who received study intervention. 
Analyses will be based on actual intervention received .

Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive intervention in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

10.7. Appendix 7: Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy 
Information  
Definitions : 
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile  (see below) . 
Women in the following cate gories are not considered WOCBP:  
1. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: 
• Documented hysterectomy  
• Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
• Documented bilateral oophorectomy 
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant ’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
2. Postmenopausal female  
• A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may be us ed to confirm a post menopausal state in  women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the nonestrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to 
continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. 
Contracept ion Guidance : 
Male Participants  
Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to ONE of the following during the protocol- defined timeframe in Section 5.1:  
• Are abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle (abstinent on a long- term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent  until after Day 60 of the 
study 
• Agree to use a male condom  with spermicide  when having penile-vaginal intercourse with a 
woman of childbearing potential who is not currently pregnant 
In addition, male participants with pregnant or breastfeeding partners must also agree to remain abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse until after Day [ADDRESS_678251] refrain from donating sperm until after Day 60 of the study.  
Female Participants  
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 1925-201-008 Amendment 1 
AGN-151607 
85 
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use a 
method of contraception (highly effective or acceptable birth control methods) consistently and 
correctly . Highly effective contraceptive methods are described  in Table 10–2. 
Table 10–2 Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods  
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependenta  
Failure rate of <  1% per yea r when used consistently and correctly   
 Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
• Oral  
• Intravaginal  
• Transdermal  
 Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
• Oral  
• Injectable  
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independenta  
Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Etonogestrel implant (ie, Nexplanon®) 
Bilateral tubal occlusion  
Intrauterine copper contraceptive (ie, ParaGard®) 
 Vasectomized Partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male 
sexual partner of the WOCBP .  
 Sexual Abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the participant.   
a Typi[INVESTIGATOR_35818]. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical 
studies.  
 
Acceptable birth control methods that result in a failure of more than 1% per year include: 
• Progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the 
primary mode of action 
• Male or female condom with spermicide  
• Cap, diaphragm, or sponge with s permicide  
• Nonhormonal intrauterine device 
• A combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide 
(double barrier methods) are also considered acceptable 
Pregnancy Testing : 
• WOCBP should only be included after a negative highly sensitive urine pregnancy test at 
screening and also a negative urine test on Day 1. 
• Additional pregnancy testing is not required during the study intervention period. 
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol 1925-201-008 Amendment 1 
AGN-151607 
86 
• Local urine testing will be standa rd unless serum testing is required by [CONTACT_112249]/IEC.  
Collection of Pregnancy Information: 
Male Participants with Partners Who Become Pregnant  
• The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male participant’s 
female pa rtner who becomes pregnant after the start of study intervention and until Day 60. 
This applies only to male participants who receive study intervention. 
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner 
directly, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and 
submit it to the sponsor within 24 hours  of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The female 
partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the 
status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor. Generally, the follow-up 
will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or  absence of 
anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
Female Participants Who Become Pregnant  
• The investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who becomes 
pregnant after the start of study intervention and until Day 60. Inf ormation will be recorded 
on the appropriate form and submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours  of learning of a 
participant’s pregnancy. The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. The investigator will collect follow-up information on the participant and the neonate, and the information will be forwarded to the sponsor. Generally, follow-up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication will be reported as an AE  or SAE . A spontaneous or elective abortion is always considered 
to be an SAE  and will be reported as such. Any poststudy pregnancy- related SAE  
considered reasonably related to the study intervention by [CONTACT_55901] 8.3.4. While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE  through 
spontaneous reporting.  
• Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will be withdrawn from the study.

Assessment  A procedure used to generate data required by [CONTACT_536796]  A study treatment  used as a comparator to reduce assessment bias, 
preserve blinding of investigational drug, assess internal study validity, 
and/or evaluate comparative effects of the investigational drug  
Enrollment  Point/time of patient entry into the study; the point at which informed 
consent must be obtained (i.e. prior to st arting any of the procedures 
described in the protocol)  
Investigational drug  The study treatment  whose properties are being tested in the study; this 
definition is consistent with US CFR 21 Section 312.3 and is synonymous 
with “investigational new drug.”  
Investigational treatment  Drug whose properties are being testing in the study as well as their associated placebo and active treatment controls (when applicable). This 
also includes approved drugs used outside of their indication/approved dosage, or that  are tested in a fixed combination. Investigational treatment 
generally does not include other study treatments administered as 
concomitant background therapy required or allowed by [CONTACT_217925]/dosage  
Medication nu mber  A unique identifier on the label of each study treatment  package which is 
linked to one of the treatment groups of a study.  
Other study treatment  Any drug administered to the patient as part of the required study 
procedures that was not included in the investigational treatment  
Subject Number  (Subject No.)  A unique identifying number assigned to each patient/healthy volunteer 
who enrolls in the study  
Phase  A subdivision of the study timeline; divides stages into smaller functional 
segments such as screening, baseline, titration, washout, etc.  
Premature patient withdrawal  Point/time when the patient exits from the study prior to the planned completion of all study treatment administration and/or assessments; at 
this time all study treatment administ ration is discontinued and no further 
assessments are planned, unless the patient will be followed for progression and/or survival  
Randomization number  A unique treatment identification code assigned to each randomized 
patient, corresponding to a specific  treatment arm assignment  
Stage related to study tim eline A major subdivision of the study timeline; begins and ends with major 
study milestones such as enrollment, randomization, completion of 
treatment, etc.  
Stage in cancer  The extent of a cancer in the body. Staging is usually based on the size of the tumor, whether lymph nodes contain cancer, and whether the cancer 
has spread from the original site to other parts of the body  
Stop study participation  Point/time at which the patient came in for a final  evaluation visit or when 
study treatment  was discontinued whichever is later  
Study treatment  Includes any drug or combination of drugs in any study arm administered to the patient (subject) as part of the required study procedures, including 
placebo and active drug run- ins. 
In specific examples, it is important to judge investigational treatment 
component relationship relative to a study treatment combination; study 
treatment in this case refers to the investigational and non-investigational 
treatments in  combination.  
Study treatment  discontinuation Point/time when patient permanently stops taking study treatment  for any 
reason; may or may not also be the point/time of premature patient 
withdrawal

1.2 Overview of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway and its role in cancer   
Smoothened (Smo) is a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) –like molecule that positively 
regulates the Hedgehog (Hh) signal trans duction pathway. Normally, the activity of Smo is 
repressed by [CONTACT_873420] -membrane receptor Patched (PTCH). Upon Hh ligand (Sonic Hh, 
Indian Hh or Desert Hh) binding to PTCH, its inhibitory effect on Smo is attenuated and the 
pathway becomes activated, lead ing to the release of Gli transcription factors from a complex 
of cytosolic inhibitory proteins. Active Gli transcription factors are translocated into the nucleus to induce Hh target genes, which control cell proliferation, survival and differentiation.  
The Hh signaling pathway plays a critical role in the embryonic development and 
homeostasis of many human organs and tissues. Genetic alterations in the Hh pathway are linked to the development of several human tumors ( basal cell carcinoma (BCC), 
medullobl astoma (MB) and rhabdomyosarcoma). Aberrant Hh signaling without evidence of 
genetic defects has also been linked with other tumors, such as pancreatic cancer, small cell lung cancer, gastro- intestinal tumors, ovarian cancer  and prostate cancer .  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_873404]1 and SMO typi[INVESTIGATOR_873405] ( Daya-Grosjean 2005) .   
1.2.[ADDRESS_1219898] progressed into clinical  trials in a wide variety of cancers.  
Vismodegib (GD C0449; [COMPANY_002])  has  being evaluated in clinical trials in basal cell carcinoma, 
medulloblastoma (recurrent and refractory in adults and young patients), ovarian cancer, 
advanced pancreatic cancer, advanced sarcoma, advanced breast cancer, advanced esophagea l 
junction and SCLC. Vismodegib is now FDA -approved for use in patients with BCC. XL -139 
(Bristol Myers-Squibb) is currently undergoing testing in combination with chemotherapy in 
SCLC, gastric/esophageal, multiple myeloma and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML ). 
Recently, clinical trials have been initiated with PF -04449913 ([COMPANY_007]) and IPI 926 ( Infinity) 
in combination in CML and in metastatic pa ncreatic cancer, respectively.  
The anti -tumor activity of Smo inhibitors ha s recently been demonstrated in patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic BCC and recurrent medulloblastoma ( von Hoff et al 2009,  
Scales and Sauvage 2009 , Siu L EORTC -NCI-AACR  2009, Ahnert JR ASCO 2010, Ahnert 
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 8 of 37 JR ESMO 2010, Rudin et al ESMO 2010)  and in superficial BCC in patients with Gorlin 
syndrome (De Rie et al 2010 ). Vismodegib is now FDA -approved for patients with BCC 
including Gorlin syndrome.

with multiple types of cancer.  
1.3.1  Pharmacodynamics 
LDE225 potent ly inhibits both human and mouse Smo at low nanomolar concentrations (11 
and 12 nM, respectively) in competitive binding in vitro  assays. In a single dose 
pharmacokinetic –pharmacodynamic (PK -PD) study, 20 mg/kg  LDE225 resulted in >90% 
inhibition Gli1 mRNA expression in tumor samples that was sustained for over 24 hrs. Daily 
multiple doses of LDE225 (20 mg/kg QD) caused >90% tumor regression in genetically 
defined in vivo  MB xenograft models characterized by [CONTACT_873421].  
1.3.2  Nonclinical pharmacokinetics and met abolism  
LDE225 was well absorbed with good oral bioavailability , ranging from 68 to 100% in the 
mous e, rat, dog, and monkey after PO  administration  either in  the form of a solution or a 
phosphate salt suspension. The compound showed low to moderate plasma clearance relative  
to blood flow in mouse, rat, dog and monkey. LDE225 exhibits high protein binding 
(approximately 98% in mouse, rat, dog and human plasma), independent of  concentration. 
The compound was extensively distributed into tissues and  its volume  of distribution (V ss) at 
steady -state was greater than total body water (1.9 -7.0 L/kg). LDE225 exhibited high protein 
binding (approximately 98% in mouse, rat, dog and human plasma), independent of 
concentration. In rats, ~85% of LDE225 related radioactivity was eliminated into the feces, 
and renal excretion was minor, accounting for <3.0% of the administered dose.  
Clearance of LDE225 is primarily hepatic by [CONTACT_097]3A4. LDE225 was extensively 
metabolized, with the major metabolic pathway being via mono - or di -oxygenation, 
demethylation, and oxidation leading to carboxylic acid formation, dealkylation, and 
dehydrogenation monohydroxylation. The elimination of me tabolites is mainly through  bile. 
Studies with human liver microsomes demonstrated that LDE225 is a c ompetitive inhibitor of 
CYP2B6 (IC 50 0.5 µM; Ki 0.045 µM), and CYP2C9 (IC 50 5 µM; K i 1.7 µM), but showed very 
little or no inhibition of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C8, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 or  3A4/5 at concentrations of 
up to 100 µM. No apparent time -dependent inhibition of major CYP450 enzymes was 
observed. LDE225 is neither a substrate nor an  inhibitor of P -glycoprotein (P -gp) or multi-
resistance protein 2  (MRP2); but it has shown inhibitory effects on breast cancer resistance 
protein (BCRP), with an estimated IC 50 value of 1.5 µM. The potential of LDE225 and its 
metabolites to undergo covalent binding to cellular macromolecules was found to be low. 
The results of toxicokinetics (TK)  studies with LDE225 indicated that systemic exposure  after 
oral administration , as measured  by C max and AUC, was not linear and in general  was less 
than dose -proportional in both rats and dogs.  There was drug accumulation after once daily 
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 9 of 37 repeat oral doses, which was more pronounced and dose -dependent in dogs.  There was an 
apparent gender differ ence in exposure in rats following multiple dosing, with female rats 
exhibiting higher exposure than male rats. Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure  for more 
details on the non- clinical toxicity , toxicokinetics  and safety of LDE225.  
1.3.[ADDRESS_1219900] inhibitors, were on bone  and consisted of thinning or closure of growth 
plates in the sternum and femur and decreasing proliferating chondrocytes in the chostochondral junction of ribs. In addition, decreases i n bone alkaline phosphatase were 
observed in dogs [Investigator Brochure]. The observations were more pronounced in rats, 
which is a species where the growth plate does not close.  Similar observations have been 
reported for other Smo inhibit ors  in animal studies (e.g. Gli- Luc transgenic mice, IHH 
transgenic mice) includ ing thinning and early closure of the growth plate, shortened bones, 
inhibition of tooth growth and abnormal bone structures, particularly the femur and tibia (Maeda 2007, Kimura 2008).  This is likely due to the role of the Hh pathway in bone 
development, particularly in the early stages of bone formation and growt h (Kimura 2008).  
These effects are not likely to occur in the adult cancer patient population intended for the clinical studies due to the maturity of their skeletal system.  However, it anticipated that Smo 
inhibition may likely affect the development of bones and teeth in growing children. Hence, monitor ing for these effects will be required during therapy with Smo inhibitors  in children. 
Preclinical cardiovascular safety pharmacology data do not in dicate a clinical risk for QTc 
prolongation.  There is also no indication of effects on the central nervous and respi[INVESTIGATOR_873406]. Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure  for more details 
on the non- clinical toxicity and saf ety of LDE225.

escalation study [CLDE225X2101]  in patients with advanced solid tumors  including 
medulloblast oma that have progressed despi[INVESTIGATOR_873407]. The primary objective was  to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and potential 
efficacy of continuous once daily oral administration. The MTD for once daily administrat ion 
of LDE225 wa s 800 mg. Data provided here are obtained from an active clinical trial

Preliminary antitumor activity and evidence of disease stabilization has been observed with 
LDE225 treatment. Nine (9) adult patients with recurrent MB have been treated in the phase I 
study CLDE225X2101.  Of these, three ( 3) patients achieved confirmed partial tumor 
responses at 200 mg QD (by [CONTACT_393]), 800 mg QD (by [CONTACT_393]) and 1500 mg QD (by [CONTACT_6789] -
PET)  and remained on treatment for approximately 6, 8 and 10 months, respectively . The 
remaining patients progressed after 1 to 4 months on study therapy (see Table 1 -3).

100 mg to 3000 mg, C max and AUC 0-24h on Cycle 1 Day 15 increased approximately dose -
propor tionally up to 400 mg and less than dose proportionally above 400 mg. After twice -
daily  (BID) administration of LDE225 from 250 mg to 750 mg, C max and AUC 0-12h on Cycle 
1 Day 15 also increased approximately dose -proportionally in this dose range. BID dosin g 
results in higher systemic exposures compared with the equivalent once daily regimen. The 7-
day PK run -in phase implemented in this phase 1 study was not long enough to allow for 
accurate estimation of the half -life using non- compartmental methods. Based on available 
data as of December 8, 2011, steady -state was achieved in a limited number of patients, after 
2 weeks to 6 cycles of repeated dosing with an accumulation ratio of 6-  to 90- fold based on 
Cmin . The estimated effective half -life, calculated based on the C min accumulation from these 
patients , ranged from 4 days to 62 days (median 19 days). The inter -subject coefficient of 
variation for Day 15 AUC and C max is 33 to 106% and 39 to 113%, respectively, across the 
dose range of 100 mg to 3000 mg/day. A t the recommended phase II dose of [ADDRESS_1219905] coefficient of variation for Day 15 AUC 0-24h and C max is 50.0% and 54.5%, in [ADDRESS_1219906] shown evidence of potent target modulation, as measured by [CONTACT_324203]1 mRNA, in a dose - and

Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 13 of 37 From a tissue acquisition perspective, the presurgical setting is ideal for the study of novel 
drug effects  on both normal and neoplastic prostate tissues.  In addition, our data (and that of 
other  investigators)  suggest that the H edgehog pat hway is active in men with high -risk 
localized prostate cancer and thus this cohort represents an appropriate population for study of Hh pathway inhibitors.  Specifically, p revious work has suggested  that pathwa ys 
characteristic of metastatic disease might be active in high -grade localized tumors ( Ross et al. 
2011). Expanding on this work, we characterized gene expression profiles from tumors of clinically and pathologically matched men with localized high -grade disease who had no 
preoperative treatment and either experienced rapid metastasis following extirpative surgery 
or no metastases for a 5 -year period. Analysis of functional annotation of differentially 
expressed genes in these two groups demonstrated enric hment for embryonic stem cell 
pathways among the localized tumors of men who would experience metastasis (adjusted P<0.0001) and a 3.7- fold increase in Sonic Hh  expression in these tumors (adjusted P <0.035) .  
These data and that of others suggest  up-regula tion of Hh signaling in localized prostate 
cancer  with metastatic potential ( Tzelepi [CONTACT_2297]. 2011, Chen et al. 2010, Kim et al. 2011).  
 
We believe that com pletion of this pharmacodynamic  (pre-surgical ) trial will guide future use 
of LDE225 in prostate cance r.  Furthermore, knowl edge of molecular responses to H edgehog 
signaling inhibition in prostate cancer could help better select patients  and the timing  for 
treatment with LDE225 or with combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
2 Objectives  and E ndpoints  
 
We pro pose to determ ine the effects of LDE225 on neoplastic prostate tissue from men at 
high risk of systemic disease progression, by [CONTACT_178537] -surgical core- biopsy specimens 
to tumor tissue  harvested at the time of prostatectomy .  In addition to assaying drug- related 
on-target effects (i.e. GLI expression changes) we pro pose to determine the effects of Smo 
inhibition on the prostate cancer transcriptome.  
Primary Objective  
 
(1) To determine the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of LDE225 on resected prostate 
tissue fr om men underg oing radical prosta tectomy for high -risk localized prostate 
cancer  (as measured by [CONTACT_873422]1  mRNA expression). 
Secondary Objectives  
 
(1) To determine whether presurgical treatment with LDE225 can exert a pathological 
effect on high -risk tumors ( i.e. increase apoptosis, decrease proliferation) .  
 
(2) To evaluate whether presurgical treatment with LDE225 diminishes the risk of PSA 
recurrence following prostatectomy.  
 
(3) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of LDE225 in the presurgical setting.  
Exploratory Objectives

3.1 Overview and  study design  
 
This pharmacodynamic/phase 0 trial is designed as a randomized two -arm (LDE225 vs. 
observation groups ) open -label prospective clinical trial in men with localized high -risk 
prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy.   
 
Activation of the Hedgehog pathway is most reliably indicated by [CONTACT_873423]1  transcription factor.  Qua ntitiative RT -PCR (qRT -PCR) provides the most reliable 
means to assess changes in GLI1  expression upon exposure to drug and will be used as our 
primary readout. Our intent will be to examine the fold change in GLI1  expression in each 
man follo wing exposure  to drug (comparing pre -operative needle biopsy tissue to surgical 
tissue obtained from the same man’s prostatectomy specimen).   Because the effects of surgery 
and fluctuations in hedgehog signaling in the prostate are unknown, GLI1 expression will also be compared between biopsies and prostatectomy specimens for men without drug exposure.  
As treatment with LDE225 may alter the gene expression of other Hedgehog pathway members and affect separate signaling pathways , as an exploratory goal , we will perform 
genome -wide expression analysis using the GeneChip Human Exon 1.0ST Array 
(Affymetrix) and will confirm fluctuations in selected genes of interest.  
 
High -risk patients will be identified based on their core- needle biopsy features, PSA levels, 
and clinical  stage. Eligible men ( NCCN high -risk (Gleason sum > 8, or PSA >20 or clinical 
stage >T3 with no evidence of metastatic disease) will undergo a repeat prostate biopsy  at 
Johns Hopkins with multiple (up to 12) cores taken from the area of their primary lesion. This 
tissue will  be frozen fresh and used for analysis of Gli1  mRNA expression  and array analysis  
as well as mounted for pathological analysis and IHC analysis of proliferation (Ki -67) and 
apoptosis (cleaved caspase- 3) markers . 
 
After obtaining baseline laboratory and clinical values (including an ECG, PSA, hematologic , 
and renal and hepatic panels), men will receiv e oral LDE225 800 mg /day or observation daily 
for 4 weeks (±3 days) prior to prostatectomy. Patients will have a clinical visit and an ECG 
and laboratory testing will be performed at 2 weeks and then again at 4 weeks, including a 4 -
week pre- prostatectomy measurement of PSA and a blood sample to deter mine plasma 
LDE225 levels by [CONTACT_29864] -MS/MS. Previous studies using other oral Hedgehog inhibitors indi cate 
that 4 weeks will allow time for steady -state levels of drug in the plasma and for inhibition of 
Gli1 expression ( LoRusso et al. 2011).  
Men will undergo radical prostatectomy ( with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy  as 
appropriate) , at which point two 250- mg biopsies of prostate tissue will be obtained, frozen 
and stored for analysis ( including Gli1  expression, genome -wide expression analysis, intra -
prostatic LDE225 levels, Ki -67, and  cleaved caspase- 3) with the remainder of the prostate 
tissue then being formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) and cross -sectioned for analysis 
as per our standard institutional procedures. 
 
Relative fold -changes in mRNA expression of Gli1 will be determined by [CONTACT_873424][INVESTIGATOR_873408]1. IHC comparisons between diagnostic biopsy specimens and prostatectomy 
specimens will be made by [CONTACT_873425] (stain ing intensity × 
percentage cell involvement).

Study Schema  
3.1.1  Investigational treatment  
The investigational study drug used in this t rial is LDE225, which is supplied as oral capsules.  
3.1.2  Treatment arms  
This will be a randomized 2- arm trial.  A rm 1 will receive LDE225 by [CONTACT_1966] 800 mg daily 
for 4 weeks ( + 3 days) ;  Arm 2  will receive no treatment (observation)  prior to prostatectomy . 
3.1.3  Treatm ent duration  
Patients will continue on LDE225 therapy  for 4 weeks ( ±3 days)  in Arm 1 , or until they 
experience a treatment toxicity requiring discontinuation.  
Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 17 of 37 3.1.4  Treatment assignment/randomization 
Patients will be randomized ( 1:1) to treatment with LDE225 or observation, with a total 
sample size of 22 patients ( i.e. 11 per group ). 
 
3.[ADDRESS_1219912] in prostate cancer .  For this reason, we 
believe that a phase 0 ( pharmacodynamic)  trial would be instrumental in  determining whether 
further larger clinical studies should be carried out with LDE225 in prostate cancer.    
 
From a tissue acquis ition perspective , a pre -surgical trial involving b iopsy tissue collection 
and tissue  at prostatectomy would be ideal for determining whether LDE225 has effects on its 
in vivo  target and  additionally to measure genome -wide alterations caused by [CONTACT_873426].  
 
Based on our pre -clinical data (and that of other groups)  we believe that men with NCCN high 
risk prostate cancer are the best candidates for this trial  due to relative enrichment in baseline 
Hedgehog pathway activation in this subgroup ( Ross et al. 2011, Tzelepi [CONTACT_2297]. 2011, Chen et 
al. 2010, Kim et al. 2011).  Becau se the temporal variability of H edgehog pathway activity 
and the effects of surgical treatment on pathway activation are largely unkn own, we believe 
that a control/ observation arm is critical to the study.

Protocol Version 3 : October 6, 2015  
Page 24 of 37 5.1.5  Permitted concomitant therapy  
Medications required to treat adverse events  and manage cancer symptoms , concurrent stable 
disease ( e.g., controlled hypertension)  and s upportive care age nts such as erythropoietin, 
granulocyte growth factors, or blood transfusion, and pain medications  are allowed . The 
patient needs to notify the investigational site about any new medications he/she takes after 
the start of  the study medication . All medications (other than study drug) and significant non-
drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including physical therapy and blood transfusions) administered after the patient starts treatment with study drug must be listed on the CRF.  
5.1.6  Permitted concomitant therapy requiring caution a nd/or action  
LDE225 is an inhibitor of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP ) in vitro . Therefore  
substrates, especially those with a narrow therapeutic range, should be used with caution. BCRP substrates include zidovudine, pantoprazole, cimetidine, sul fasalazine, nitrofuratoin, 
mitoxantrone, methotr exate, topotecan, imatinib, and irinotecan . However, the use of  statins is 
generally  prohibited during this study  (except for pravastatin) . 
In vitro  drug metabolism studies reveal that the metabolism of LDE225 is mediated by 
[CONTACT_097]3A4 and also a potent inhibitor of CY P2C9 and CYP2B6. C linical studies have not yet 
been performed to confirm the potential effect of LDE225 on substrates drugs metabolized by 
[CONTACT_097]2C9 in patients. Also, it is not known the potential effe ct of low and moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors and inducers on LDE225 clearance. Therefore, investigators, at their discretion, may administer concomitant medications known to be metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C9 and CYP2B6, except drugs which have narrow therapeutic index/sensitive substrates for these two  isoforms 
and statins . Caution is advised when LDE225 is co- administered with drugs that are moderate 
inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4. Patients receiving such medications must be monitored 
closely for any potentiation of toxicity or decrease of clinical benefit due to any individual 
concomitant medications, and may require dose titration or  adjustment . 
5.1.7  Prohibited concomitant therapy  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Other investi gational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_873410].  Anticancer 
therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic or radiation therapy, and surgery) other than 
the study treatments must not be given to patients while the patient is on the study medication. If such agents are required fo r a patient then the patient must be discontinued from the 
treatment portion of the study . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers  
No clinical studies have been performed to confirm if LDE225 is a sensitive CYP3A4 
substrate, hence concomitant use of strong CY P3A4 inhibitors  and inducers  is not permitted .  
Patients receiving concomitant medications known to strongly inhibit and/or induce 
CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_1219946] of drugs that are inducers, and inhibitors of CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_1219947]  of medications has been generated by [CONTACT_873427]

& - statins  – If it is essential that the patient takes a statin to control hyperlididemia [see Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] ], then only pravastatin  may be used with extra caution. Prav astatin has the lowest potential of 
cause rhabdomyolysis compared with other statins (3 cases/ 6 millions of prescription from 1994 to 
2002) ( Evans et al. 2002) and the lowest risk for drug- drug interactions with LDE225, as it is primarily 
transformed in t he liver cytosol by [CONTACT_324227], not by [CONTACT_097]2C9 or CYP3A4. ( Evans et al. 2002)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Warfarin and coumadin derivatives 
Therapeutic doses of warfarin sodium  (Coumadin®) or any other coumadin -derivative  
anticoagulants are not permitted  since LDE225 is a competitiv e inhibitor of CYP2C9 based 
on the in vitro  data. An alternative, therapeutic anticoagulation may be accomplished using 
low-molecular weight heparin . 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Drugs that may increase risk of rhabdomyolysis   
Selected drugs that may increase risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when used 
concomitantly with LDE225 should be avoided. Such drugs should be discontinued for at least [ADDRESS_1219949] compi[INVESTIGATOR_873412] -drug interaction with LDE225 through inhibitory effects on CYP3A4 (enzyme

6.2 Assessment s 
6.2.1  Efficacy  assessments 
The primary measures of efficacy in this  trial are pharmacodynamic measured by [CONTACT_873430]1 expression by [CONTACT_16641] -PCR.  In addition, efficacy will also be evaluated in secondary 
endpoints which will compare tumor stage, grade, surgical margin rates and tumor proliferation / apoptosis between t reatment and observation arms.  The proportion of patients 
with undetectable PSAs at three mont hs will also be assessed in  the two groups. 
6.2.[ADDRESS_1219956] of monitoring and recording all adverse events  (AEs) , 
including se rious adverse events, the monitoring of hematology , blood chemistry, ECG and 
the regular monitoring of vital signs, and physical condition as shown in corresponding tables .  
All patients will receive CK level monitoring at baseline, day 14 and day 28 with additional levels drawn in patients report symptoms of rhabdomyolysis during the study.  For details on AE collection and reporting, refer to the Safety section in the protocol .   
In addition, we will pay particular attention to peri- operative adverse even ts (intraoperative 
bleeding, increased operative time, increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], increased postoperative infections, wound breakdowns, etc.).  These will be monitored by [CONTACT_873431][INVESTIGATOR_873414] -operative clinic notes.  
6.2.3  Pharmacokineti cs 
Plasma LDE225 trough levels ( PK) will be measured at baseline and on the day of 
prostatectomy using LC -MS/MS . 
6.2.4  Biomarkers  
For analysis of Gli1  expression, RNA will be purified using the RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen) and 
then cDNA will be synthesized  according to standard procedures.  Quantitative  PCR will then 
be performed using the Taqman system with primers for Gli1 and the reference gene HPRT1 .  
Applied Biosystems software will be used to calculate threshold cycle values (and thus relative expression levels) . Normalized changes in Gli1  expression between  each patient pre - 
and post -operatively and between each group (observation versus treat ment arm) will be made 
with 2 -sided pairwise comparison s considering P <  0.[ADDRESS_1219957] alterations upon exposure to LDE225 and will do so in an unbias ed

adverse events if they worsen after starting study treatment (any procedures specified in the 
protocol). Adverse events occurring before starting study treatment but after signing the informed consent form are recorded. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute AE s 
only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require therapy, and are recorded.  
Information about all serious adverse events will be collected and recorded on the FDA MedWatch 3500a F orm. To ensure patient saf ety each serious adverse event must also be 
reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition which:  
1. is fatal or life -threatening  
2. required or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543]  
3. results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity

5. is medically significant, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes liste d above.  
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314]:  
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition. 
• treatment, which was elective or pre- planned, for a pr e-existing condition that did not 
worsen  
• treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the

down- regulation of Gli1 in the t reatment arm compared to  the observational arm.   
8.1 Sample size considerations , and analysis of the primary endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint is a ≥50% reduction in Gli1 mRNA (or protein) expression following treatment with LDE225. This study will compare prostatectomy Gli1 expression levels to presurgical biopsy Gli1  expression levels in the same patients ( i.e. intra -patient changes) . In 
the control group ( observation), we expect <10% of patients to show a ≥50% Gli1  
downregulation (null hypothesis), while in the LDE225 group we would hypothesize that >50% of patients would demonstrate a ≥ 70% Gli1 downregulation (alternative hypothesis). 
Using a 2 -sided alpha ( α) of 0.10 and a beta ( β) of 0.20 (power = 80%), a sample size of 11 
men/arm  (total = 22 men) would be required to observe a difference in the primary endpoint 
from <10% (in the control  arm) to ≥ 70% (in the LDE225 arm).  
8.2 Analysis  of the secondary endpoints  
 
• Apoptotic markers.  Caspase 3 staining (and/or TUNEL assay results) will be expressed 
as the mean staining percentage in tumor samples, and reported separately for each treatment group. Standard deviations, 95% confidence intervals, and ranges will also be reported where appropriate. Means will be compared across treatment arms using two -way ANOVA.  
 
• Proliferation markers.  Ki-[ADDRESS_1219964] deviations, 95% 
confidence intervals, and ranges will also be reported where appropriate. Means will be compared across treatment arms using two -way ANOVA.  
 
• Pathological complete respons es (pCR).  This will be defined as an absence of tumor 
identification on standard histological analysis of the resected prostate specimens. The proportion of patients achieving a pCR will be compared between treatment arms using the Mantel -Haenszel test.

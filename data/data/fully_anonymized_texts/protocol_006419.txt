combination of Exenatide extended release and dapagliflozin or placebo on ketogenesis, 
glucagon and lipolysis.  
In the acute effects study, qualified patients will come fasting to the research center. 
Review of study procedures and vitals will be performed. Insulin infusion (pump) will be 
 Page 7 of 53 IRB Version: SEPT 2019  stopped and  basal  blood, urine and adipose tissue biopsy samples will be obtained . 
Placebo s, exenatide (5µg) or dapagliflozin (10mg ) (with appropriate placebos)  or 
combination of exenatide and dapagliflozin  will be administered, according to a 
randomized fashion, and blood samples will be collected every 30 min for up to 8 hours 
after starting the treatment. Urine will be collected every hour up to 8 hours  and a second 
adipose tissue biopsy will be collected at 6 hours  after the start of the treatment.  Additional 
blood samples will be collected at 1, 2, 4 and 6 and 8 hour marks for MNC isolation.  Plasma 
and mononuclear cell (MNC) fractions will be prepared from the blood samples. The 
patient will then come ba ck at the 24 hour mark for a fasting blood and urine collection. 
The long term study will then commence. Exenatide extended release  or dapagliflozin

Response:  
Insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes was started soon after the discovery of 
insulin. Majority of such patients are still not at their glycemic targets. Clearly, therefore, 
it is necessary to look for means of further improvement. Novel approac hes with GLP -1 
receptor agonists (GLP -1RA) like liraglutide and with sodium -glucose transport protein -2 
(SGLT2) inhibitors, have recently provided additional strategies for the treatment of this 
condition when used in combination with insulin (1-5). Initial studies with either liraglutide 
or dapagliflozin, (5-7) an SGLT2 inhibitor, have been successful but have still not allowed  
patients to  be at their  target level of glycemic control . We have, therefore, pi[INVESTIGATOR_28519] ‘triple therapy’, combining insulin, GLP -1RAs and SGLT -2 inhibitors.  
 
While the search for new and novel strategies for glycemic control in type 1 diabetes is of 
great significance, it is also important to evaluate these new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_28520] 1 diabetes such as Di abetic Ketoacidosis 
(DKA). DKA is an important complication and cause of mortality and morbidity in type 1 
patients. The decreased ratio of insulin to glucagon in insulin deficient subjects promotes 
ketogenesis (8). In patients with type [ADDRESS_27781] of hyperglycemia 
 Page 8 of 53 IRB Version: SEPT [ADDRESS_27782] of insulin and GABA from the β cell on α cell are absent. 
Thus, plasma glucagon concentrations are elevated and in combination with insulin 
deficiency, lead to lipolysis, increased plasma FFA concentrations and an increa sed fatty 
acid supply to the liver. Thus, both fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis are enhanced (9).     
 
Data from recent studies, including our own (2), show that GLP -1RA can lower blood 
glucose concentrations in  patients with type [ADDRESS_27783] prandial 
excursion of glucagon, it also suppresses fasting plasma FFA concentrations (Fig 1). In this 
context, it is important that the deleti on of the glucagon receptor protects both from 
hyperglycemia and ketosis following a high dose of streptozotocin in mice (10). Therefore, 
it is possible that GLP -[ADDRESS_27784] by [CONTACT_28551] -absorption 
in the renal tubules and thus inducing the excretion of 60 -100 grams per day of glucose in 
urine (7). They have been studied extensively for use in type 2 diabetes however; there is 
still paucity of data regarding any benefits in type [ADDRESS_27785] like in patients with type 2 diabetes with improved glycemic indices. Indeed, 
Mudaliar et al (3) demonstrated that use of remogliflozin  in patients with type [ADDRESS_27786] glucose 
load and glucose improvements were sustained for up to 10 hours. Perkins et al (6) studied 
use of 8 weeks of empagliflozin in type 1 diabetes and demonstrated significant reduction 
in HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, the rate of hypoglycemia and the daily insulin dose. 
Mean urinary excretion of glucose increased and significant weight loss  was observed. 
Cherney et al (1) also demonstrated significantly increased glucose excretion and fall in 
HbA1c despi[INVESTIGATOR_28521] 25mg daily for [ADDRESS_27787] remarkable 
feature of the se clinical epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] s was that the patient’s glucose levels were normal but the 
ketoacidosis was florid. She was treated with intravenous insulin and fluids following 
which DKA reversed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375].  
 
These two  intriguing DKA epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] s lead us to ask several mechanistic questions. Why 
should the addition of an SGLT2 inhibitor lead to DKA while glycemia improves further? 
There are several possibilities. Firstly, there is the possibility that the aggressive reduction 
in the insulin dose d ue to restoration of normoglycemia by [CONTACT_28552] 9 of 53 IRB Version: SEPT [ADDRESS_27788] led to systemic insulinopenia in spi[INVESTIGATOR_28522] (which 
is being maintained by [CONTACT_28553]2 inhibition), thus resulting in 
uncontrolled ketogenesis and euglycemic DKA. The second possibility is that SGLT2 
inhibitors are known to induce hyperglucagonemia which on the one hand, increases 
gluconeogenesis (11, 12) and on the other, also promotes ketogenesis. The hyperglycemic 
effect of gluconeogenesis is more than neutralized by [CONTACT_28554]2 
inhibitors but the potential ketogenic effect probably adds on to that induced by 
[CONTACT_28555]. It should also be mentioned that S GLT2 inhibitors increase appetite and 
carbohydrate intake in patients with type [ADDRESS_27789] of an SGLT2 inhibitor is not known.  
 
Therefore, we embarked on this study to investigate in detail the mechanisms involved in 
ketogenesis, lipolysis and glucagon changes in patients with type 1 diabetes treated with 
dapagliflozin or By[CONTACT_28556] (exenatide extended release, a long  term acting GLP -1 RA) for 
[ADDRESS_27790] of an SGLT -2 inhibitor and 
Exenatide extended release  on ketogenesis.  
 
Preliminary data:  
Effect of liraglutide on glucose, glucagon, Ketogenesis and FFA I type 1 diabetes  
Sixty -three patients with type 1 diabetes were randomized to placebo (17) or liraglutide 0.6 
mg (18), liraglutide 1.2 mg (13) and liraglutide 1.8 mg (15) treatment for 12 weeks. There 
was a statistically significant decrease in average blood glucose concen trations in patients 
randomized to 1.2 and 1.8 mg groups as compared with placebo. HbA1c fell by 0.78% in 
1.2 mg group (7.84±0.17% to 7.06±0.15% (p<0.0001) and by 0.42% in 1.8 mg group 
(7.41±0.15 to 6.99±0.15 (p=0.001). Basal and bolus insulin doses fell i n both 1.2 and 1.8 
mg groups. Fasting plasma FFA fell significantly in the 1.8mg group from 0.55±0.07 to 
0.45±0.05mM, (p<0.05, Figure 1A). There was no significant change in fasting levels of 
glucagon following any treatment compared to placebo group while at the end of 12 weeks, 
the area under curve (AUC) for the HFHC meal induced increase in glucagon was lower 
by 47±12% and 72±12% in the 1.2mg and 1.8mg groups, respectively (p<0.05 for both as 
compared to 0 week response, Figure 1B). Overall the suppressi ve effect of liraglutide on 
postprandial glucagon was dose dependent. There was no significant change in fasting or 
postprandial concentrations of ketone bodies (acetoacetate  acid and β -hydroxybutyrate) 
following liraglutide treatment.

Dapagliflozin as Additional Treatment to Insulin and Liraglutide in Patients with Type 
1 Diabetes Mellitus: Preliminary Observations  
 We have now investigated whether the addition of dapagliflozin, to insulin and liraglutide 
would improve glycemia further. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 10 patients on 
continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) treated with this combination. T hey were 
under treatment with insulin and had received liraglutide for 11±2 months (baseline 
HbA1c: 8.01±0.22 %; mean age: 56±4 years; mean age of diabetes diagnosis: 29±5 years; 
mean BMI: 29±1 Kg/m2; mean body weight: 86.4±4.5 kg; mean BP: 125/75±3 mm Hg) . 
In all patients, dapagliflozin was started at a dose of 5 mg daily and was increased to 10 
mg daily 7±1 days later. At the end of 12±1 weeks of dapagliflozin therapy, mean HbA1c 
fell by 0.66±0.22% (p=0.0004); mean glucose fell by 28±2mg/dl from a baselin e of 172±9 
mg/dl (p=0.016,); the daily carbohydrate intake increased from 166±3g to 196±4g (p= 
0.04); mean body weight and BMI fell from 87±5 Kg to 85±5 Kg and 29±1 to 28±1Kg/m2, 
respectively (p=0.02). Total insulin dose remained unchanged at 0.7±0.1 u/Kg daily. There 
was no additional hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dl). One patient developed diabetic ketoacidosis 
(DKA) in spi[INVESTIGATOR_28523] 48 hours of increasing the 
dose of dapagliflozin to 10 mg. The dose of insulin in this patient  had declined from 0.45 
to 0.39 u/kg (total dose: 32.9 to 28.5 units). Carbohydrate intake had increased from 50 to 
95g daily. Along with improved glycemic control there was a significant increase in FFA 
(from 0.34±0.04 to 0.59±0.11mM, p<0.05), β -hydroxybu tyrate (from 0.11±0.02 to 
0.39±0.09mM, p<0.05) and acetoacetate (from 0.32±0.09 to 0.53±0.11mM, p<0.05) at the 
end of follow -up period compared insulin and liraglutide alone. Dapagliflozin intake for 1 
2weeks also increased glucagon concentrations by 35 ±13% (from 91 ±12 to 114±19pg/ml , 
p<0.05 , Figure 3)

dapagliflozin  (10mg) , exenatide  (5µg), a combination of exenatide and dapagliflozin or 
placebo under insulinopenic condition and the long term effect under basal conditions 
before and after  [ADDRESS_27806] 60 patients in cohort 1. For co hort 2,w e will 
evaluate the acute effects of a single dose of dapagliflozin  (10mg) , exenatide  (5µg), or a 
combination of exenatide and dapagliflozin  under insulinopenic condition and the long 
term effect under basal conditions before and after  12 weeks treatment with dapagliflozin, 
Exenatide extended release, or a combination of Exenatide extended release and 
dapagliflozin  on Ketogenesis.   
In the acute effects study, qualified patients will come fasting to the research center. 
Review of study procedures and vitals will be performed. Insulin infusion (pump) will be 
stopped and  basal  blood, urine and adipose tissue biopsy samples will be obtained . 
Placebo s, exenatide (5µg) or dapagliflozin (10mg ) (with appropriate placebos)  or 
combination of exenatide and dapagliflozin  will be administered, according to a 
randomized fashion  and cohort assigned , and blood samples will be collected every 30 min 
for up to 8 hours after starting the treatment. Urine will be collected every hour up to 8 
hours  and a second adipose tissue biopsy will be collected at 6 hours after the start of the 
treatment. Additional blood samples will be collected at 1, 2, 4 and 6 and 8 hour marks for 
MNC isolati on. Plasma and mononuclear cell (MNC) fractions will be prepared from the 
blood samples. The patient will then come back at the 24 hour mark for a fasting blood and 
urine collection. The long term study will then commence. Depending on the cohort, 
Exenatide extended release or dapagliflozin (along with appropriate placebos) or a 
combination of both drugs will be started and continued for 12 weeks according to original 
randomization of day 0. In the long term study, dapagliflozin (or the appropriate placebo)  
will be started at 5mg dose and will be titrated to 10mg/day after 5 days. Fasting blood and 
24hr urine samples will be collected at 1, 4 and 8 weeks. At 12 weeks, the 2nd acute effects 
testing study will be repeated as described above.  
 
Drug Blinding:  
 Page 21 of 53 IRB Version: SEPT 2019  All drugs used and their matching placebos will be provided by [CONTACT_28562]. Drug or placebo assignment will be mailed separately. A designated 
coordinator/investigator (or University Pharmacy) who is not participating in the study will  
receive the drug/placebo assignment cods and will be responsible for relabeling the drugs 
and placebos containers/vials according to Good Manufacturing Practice and in 
compliance with FDA regulations and local guidelines. Relabeled drug/ placebos will be 
dispensed by [CONTACT_28563] -generated randomization log generated 
using Microsoft –Excel randomization feature. Records of drug and placebo assignment 
will be kept with the independent investigator/coordinator (or UB Pharmacy) in a se cure 
place (locked office or enclosure) or on password protected computer and folder (if digital) 
For each patients and in at every dispensing visit, 2 drugs and/or placebos combo will be 
dispensed to maintain blinding of both patient and study team. For e xample, patients in the 
dapagliflozin only arm will receive dapagliflozin active drug tablet and exenatide (acute 
study) and exenatide extended release (long term) matching placebos.  
 
Drugs will be stored in a locked cabinet or locked temperature controlled refrigerator at 4C 
at the research facility of the Diabetes and Endocrinology Center of WNY. IND application 
for use of all drugs (dapagliflozin, Exenatide extended release and exena tide) in type 1 
diabetes will be submitted to FDA and no study procedure will start before all local and 
federal approvals are obtained.  
 
Visit 1 (day -7): 
Qualifying patients will be scheduled for first this visit within 2 weeks of screening visit. 
Their insulin pump will be downloaded  or log of MDI/carbohydrate intake will be 
collected  and appropriate insulin adjustments will be made by [CONTACT_28564]  70-180 mg/dl if possible at all times 
without having additional hypoglycemia (less than 70 mg/dl) . Urine collection container 
will be provided with instruction to collect urine starting 24 hours before coming for their 
next visit.  
  
 
Visit 2 (day 0):  
Qualifying subjects will be asked to come for the visit in a fasting state  (10-12hr fasting) . 
They will be fasting for the entire visit. 24hr urine will be collected, vitals and fingerstick 
blood glucose and ketones (β -hydroxybutyrate) using the Precision Extra glucose and 
ketones meter (Abbott Laboratories) and urine Ketostix (Bayer) will be measured . For MDI 
patients, b aseline blood, spot urine, and adipose tissue will be collected . The remainder of 
this visits’ procedures apply only to pump patients.  If, ketones measure positive in blood 
or in urine (≥0.4 mM in blood or >+1 in urine) or fasting blood glucose <70 or >250 mg/dl, 
the acute testing will not take place and patient will be rescheduled . An IV port will be 
placed in order to obtain blood samples throughout the duration of the visit. Insulin infusion 
will be stopped , and b aseline blood, spot urine, and adipose tissue will be collected . These 
samples will constitute the baseline for all study measurements. One of the treatment arms 
will be administe red to the patient  depending on their cohort  (placebo OR exenatide 5µg 
subcutaneous (same site will be used in 2nd acute study at end of study) injection OR 
dapagliflozin 10mg (two 5mg) oral tablets OR combination of exenatide 5µg AND 
 Page 22 of 53 IRB Version: SEPT 2019  dapagliflozin 10mg (two 5mg) with appropriate placebos in a randomized fashion). 
Subjects will be fasting throughout the  first 6 hr of  the visit. Blood (10ml) will be collected 
every 30 min and spot urine every 1hr for up to 8 hours. Additional blood samples (20ml) 
will be collected at 1, 2, [ADDRESS_27807] calculator of the insulin 
pump after entering the grams of carbohydrates and blood glucose (Bolus wizard matches 
the bolus insulin dose based on individual p atient’s insulin to carbohydrate ratio and 
correction factor for high blood glucose). Patients will be monitored for at least 2hr before 
discharging from center (8hr time point). The subject’s blood glucose and ketones (β -
hydroxybutyrate) levels will be mo nitored every 30 minutes and ketones will be also 
measured in urine using Ketostix every hour to ensure safety. If the BG concentrations 
exceed 400 mg/dl or blood β -hydroxybutyrate exceeds 2.5mmol/l (or +3 (80mg/dl) or 
greater in urine) anytime during the 360 minutes following single dose/doses with or 
without clinical signs and symptoms of DKA like nausea and vomiting then STAT lab 
sample for CMP will be collected  along with  research blood sample . Spot urine and adipose 
tissue biopsy will be collected  only if deemed feasible by [CONTACT_28565]. B asal insulin will be restarted; bolus insulin as per 
the bolus wizard calculator will be administered and a meal provided. Patient will be 
discharged only after all laboratory parameters return to pretesting levels with no clinical 
symptoms of DKA .  
 
This will  now mark the end of the acute testing phase and the beginning of the 12 weeks 
treatment phase.  If the HbA1c is ≥7.5%; then no reduction will be made in dose of insulin 
while if the HbA1c ranges from 7 -7.5% then the basal and pre -prandial insulin doses will 
be reduced by 5%.  All patients will be instructed on how to give the single subcutaneous 
injection of Exenatide extended release  (2mg weekly)  or Exenatide extended release 
placebo  (for those in cohort 1), or open label drugs (for those in cohort  2), which will be 
administered at home the next day. Patients will also be provided with 12  oral tablets of 
either 5mg placebo or 5mg dapagliflozin (depending on their group assignment  and 
cohort ) and instructed to consume [ADDRESS_27808] 4 days and 2 
tablets (10 mg) on days 5, 6 and 7 (and for the rest of the 12 weeks thereafter) and to 
return to the center on day 7. Urine collection container will be provided and patients 
instructed to collect 24hr urine before their next visit. The patients will be trained to 
recognize the symptoms of DKA and to self -test ketones daily and if they develop any 
symptoms consistent with DKA, including nausea, vomiting, fatigue, confusio n, or 
shortness of breath. Information sheet about above information will be provided to 
participants. Patients will be instructed to measure ketone bodies in urine samples daily 
with Ketostix (Bayer) and record it in diary provided. If ketone bodies in urine measure 
+2 or greater (>4mM in urine), patients are required to notify the research center. The 
investigators will collect all necessary information  and advise the patient of any steps to 
mitigate the risk of DKA or to visit the closest emergency depar tment and to inform 
emergency staff of their participation in a research study.

Procedures:  
 
1. Ketone bodies measurements: Serum  and plasma samples will be collected from 
whole blood within 30 min  and stored at -80C till analysis . Spot and 24 hr  urine 
samples will be centrifuged and clear supernatant stored at -80C till analysis. 
Plasma and urine s amples will be analyzed for ketone bodies using commercially 
available  kits for β -hydroxybutyrate (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) and for 
acetoacetate (Biovision, Malpi[INVESTIGATOR_8946], CA).  Patients will be instructed to measure 
ketone bodies in u rine samples daily with  Ketostix (Bayer).  
2. MNC isolation: Blood samples (30 -40ml) is collected in Na -EDTA and carefully 
layered on Lympholyte medium (Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby, ON) according 
to manufacturer’s instructions. Samples are centrifuged and two bands separate out 
at the top of the RBC pellet. The M NC band was harvested and washed twice with 
Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS). This method provides yields greater than 
95% MNC preparation.

alcohol. A sterile drape will be placed around the appropriate area. 3 cc of 1% 
lidocaine will then be administered subcutaneously. After adequate anesthesia has 
been achieved, approximat ely 20 -50cc of 0.5% lidocaine will be injected in the 
adipose tissue. Dose of lidocaine will not exceed 4.5mg/kg body weight. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_28528] a 3 -holed cannula (Tulip Instrumentation, 
length: 15cm, diameter: 2.1mm) fixe d to a 10mL syringe. More than one attempt at 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_28529]. 
After getting adequate fat tissue (500mg -3g), the puncture site will be pressed for 
at least ten minutes before the patient r ises up from supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] (to minimize 
bruising). The study subjects will then be discharged home. The adipose tissue will 
be centrifuged to remove blood and fluid contaminants. The upper adipose tissue 
will be collected into a separate sterile tube, wa shed twice with cold sterile 
Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and centrifuged to remove the PBS. The adipose 
tissue sample will be weighed and approximately 500 mg transferred to a separate 
tube for analysis. Total RNA, nuclear extracts and total cell lysat es will be prepared 
from the adipose tissue.  
4. Quantification of HSL and SGLT2 Expression: The mRNA expression is 
measured in MNC by [CONTACT_937] -PCR: Total RNA was isolated from MNC and adipose 
tissue using commercially available RNAqueous® -4PCR Kit (Ambion, Austin, 
TX). One µg of total RNA is reverse transcribed using Advantage RT -for-PCR Kit 
 Page 25 of 53 IRB Version: SEPT 2019  (Clontech, CA). Real Time RT -PCR was performed using Stratagene Mx3000P 
QPCR System (La Jolla, CA), Sybergreen master mix (Qiagen, CA) and gene 
specific primers (Life Technologies, MD).The specificity and the size of the PCR 
products are tested by [CONTACT_1583] a  melt curve at the end of the amplifications and by 
[CONTACT_28567] a 2% agarose gel. All values were normalized to the expression of a 
group of housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_28530], ubiquitin C and cyclophilin A.  
5. Western blotting:  MNC total cell lysates are prepared by [CONTACT_28568] 
150 μL of lysis buffer (10mM Tris -HCl, 150mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X and 
proteases and phosphatases inhibitors). After 30 min incubation on ice, samples are 
centrifuged at [ZIP_CODE] Xg for 10 min, supe rnatants are collected and total protein 
concentrations are determined. Sixty μg of total cell lysate are boiled in 2X SDS 
buffer (100 mM Tris -HCl, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.06 % bromophenol blue and 
200 mM DTT), proteins separated by [CONTACT_451] -PAGE and then transferred to PVDF 
membrane. Polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies against SGLT2 and HSL, (Abcam, 
Cambridge, MA) and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) will be used and the 
membranes are developed using super signal, chemiluminescence reagent  (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_28531], IL). Densitometry is performed using molecular analyst software

17.0 Data Management  and Analysis  
17.1 Describe the data analysis plan, including any statistical procedures.   This 
section applies to both quantitative and qualitative analysis.  
Response: DATA ANALYSIS  
This is a prospective study to evaluate ketogenic stress before and after 12 week 
treatment with dapagliflozin and exenatide/By[CONTACT_28556]. The similarities in baseline values 
between the study groups will be compared using appropriate parametric tests. 
Transfo rmations of the data on order to meet statistical assumptions may be considered.  
All statistical analysis will be carried out using SPSS software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, 
Illinois) based on intention to treat principle.  Data will be presented as mean± standard 
error. Data will not be imputed to replace missing data and only observed data will used 
to run the mixed model for repeated measurement (MMRM) analysis.  The primary 
endpoint  of the study is to detect a significant difference in the percent change in beta -
hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetic acid (total ketone bodies) in the plasma samples 
following 12 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment compared to placebo. Fasting samples 
collected at weeks 0, 1, 4, 8 and 12 will be used for this comparison with values at week 
0 considered as baseline.  The statistical analysis will be done using MMRM  with 
assigned α value of 0.05. There is no previous data on effects of dapagliflozin alone on 
ketone bodies generation in T1D but our preliminary data on 12 weeks treatment with 
 Page 32 of 53 IRB Version: SEPT 2019  dapagliflozin in patients with T1D using insulin and liraglutide shows more than a 2 fold 
increase in total ketone bodies.  
The secondary end points include the comparison of the acute changes in AUC 0hr-6hr of 
ketone bodies (plasma and urine), FFA and glucagon between dapagliflozin, exenatide, 
combination of both and placebo before and after [ADDRESS_27824] RMANOVA.

objectives and jus tify a conclusion.  
Response: Conservatively estimating a difference in the change from baseline in ketone 
bodies generation between the dapagliflozin and placebo of 50%, with standard 
deviation of no more than 50%, a sample size of 20 patients per group (assuming a drop -
out rate of 15 %) should provide adequate power (  = 0.2) to detect a significant 
difference (  = 0.05). A total of 80 patients will be recruited for the study.

to bring back any unused research drug and or device. If necessary, they will be 
asked to complete an end of study visit for their safety.   
21.[ADDRESS_27831] the reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, hazards, or 
inconveniences to the subjects  related to their participation in the research. 
Consider physical, psychological, social, legal, and economic risks.   Include 
a description of the probability, magnitude, duration, and reversibility of the 
risks.  
NOTE:  Breach of confidentiality is always a risk for identifiable subject data.  
Response: Risks Associated with Administration of Intravenous (IV) line, adipose 
tissue and blood collection:  
All subjects will be informed of the complication of administration of intravenous (IV) 
line, which includes mild bruising at the site of IV line, which should resolve in few days. 
They will also be informed about the possibility of infiltration of the IV line at the time of 
 Page 39 of 53 IRB Version: SEPT [ADDRESS_27832] side effects such as low blood pressure or heart rate 
and allergic reaction to lidocaine including swelling of  the throat.  Serious risks associated 
with IV puncture or adipose tissue biopsy may also include infections and thrombosis. If 
any of these serious side effects is observed, the patients will be asked to call us 
immediately or seek immediate medical help.  
 
Risks Associated with Administration of study drugs:  
All subjects will be referred to By[CONTACT_28556] (extended release exenatide) and dapagliflozin 
labeling safety information, and will be provided a copy of the package insert of the 
medication. Discussion of the potential side effects and the different warning an d 
precautions will take place at the time of signing the informed consent and prior to 
treatment. Patients will be informed they must not discontinue their insulin during the 
study.  
Potential side effects of GLP -[ADDRESS_27833] and SGLT -2 inhibitors include hypotension, nausea, 
polydipsia, polyuria, dehydration, reduced GFR. Patients will be provided guidance on 
potential side effects and how to properly manage and report it.  The potential benefits 
including improved glycemia, improved BP, potential renal protection, improved quality 
of life (QOL) will most probably overcome the potential side effects.  
By[CONTACT_28576]. Some of these tumors were 
cancer. It is not known if By[CONTACT_28577] a type of thyroid cancer 
called medullary thyroid cancer in people. This will be discussed in details wi th all 
participating subjects. Exenatide is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family 
history of MTC and in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 
2).  
Injection -site reactions: Serious injection -site reactions, with or without bumps (nodules), 
have happened in some people who use BY[CONTACT_28578]. Some of these injection -site 
reactions have required surgical intervention. Report any injection site reactions incl uding 
nodules to study investigators.  
 
All the known adverse effects with SGLT -2 inhibitors will be discussed with patients 
before the start of the study as follows: -  
• Intravascular volume contraction and symptomatic hypotension can occur after 
initiating SGLT -2 inhibitors.  
• Impairment in Renal Function - SGLT -2 inhibitors increases serum creatinine and 
decreases eGFR. Elderly patients and patients with impaired renal function may be more 
susceptible to these changes.  
• Genital mycotic Infections - SGLT -2 inhibitors increases the risk of genital mycotic 
infections. Patients with prior history were more likely to develop genital mycotic 
infections.  
 Page 40 of 53 IRB Version: SEPT 2019  • Bladder Cancer - Across 22 clinical studies, newly diagnosed cases of bladder cancer 
were reported in 10/6045 patients (0.17%) treated with Dapagliflozin and 1/3512 patient 
(0.03%) treated with placebo. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug 
was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 4 cases with 
dapagliflozin and no cases with p lacebo. There were too few cases to determine whether 
the emergence of these events is related to Dapagliflozin.  
• The dapagliflozin tablets and matching placebo contain lactose, which may cause 
discomfort in lactose -intolerant individuals.  
There is a risk of DKA, as shown by [CONTACT_28579], when 
SGLT2 inhibitors were used in type [ADDRESS_27834] observed euglycemic ketoacidosis. This has led us to analyze the 
occurrence of DKA. We found that the patients, who developed DKA, had had their insulin 
doses reduced to less than or equal to 0.5 units/Kg body weight. Thus, this phenomenon is 
in part due to insulinopenia and in part due to effects of SGLT2 inhibitors at th e hepatic 
level, which are anti -insulin in nature, like increased gluconeogenesis. On the basis of our 
data, we shall also not allow the dose of insulin to fall below 0.5 units/Kg body weight. 
Furthermore, we shall use only the lower dose of dapagliflozin (5mg) in patients who 
exhibit significant ketonuria with the lower dose.  
Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to study drugs or placebo ingredients or other 
interventions may accrue in rare cases. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_28549]. Our site and staff are trained and 
equipped to assist patients with such reactions. Severe conditions that are not satisfactory 
managed in site will be trans ferred to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28550].  
 
  
 
 
21.2 Describe procedures performed to lessen the probability or magnitude of 
risks, including procedures being performed to monitor subjects for safety.  
Response:  
Safety data (vitals, CBC, CMP, urinary markers) will be collected at screening, during and 
at end of the study.  STAT CMP will be done when glucose or ketones exceeds 400mg/dl 
and 2.5mM, respectively or any signs of DKA is observed during the acute testing phase.  
If, ketones measure positive in blood or in urine (≥0.4 mM in blood or >+1 in urine) or 
fasting blood glucose <70 or >250 mg/dl, the acute testing will not take place and patient 
will be rescheduled. Injection  site reactions, mycotic infections and complications of IV 
and biopsy collection will also be monitored, volume control and hypoglycemia will be 
monitored and collected at every visit.  Physical examination will be performed at 2, 4, [ADDRESS_27835] 3 time during the study. The patients, however, will be instructed to 
 Page 41 of 53 IRB Version: SEPT 2019  report any adverse event or safety related information via phone as soon as it occurs. All 
safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_11637] -investigators within 1 -2 days of collection.  
 
If the BG concentrations exceed 400 mg/dl or blood β -hydroxybutyrate exceeds 2.5mmol/l 
(or +3 (80mg/dl) or greater in urine) anytime during the 360 minutes following single 
dose/doses with no clinical signs and symptoms of DKA like nausea and vomiting then  
blood sample, spot urine and adipose tissue biopsy will be collected immediately, basal 
insulin will be restarted; bolus insulin as per the bolus wizard calculator will be 
administered and a meal provided.  Patients will be instructed to come back at the 2 4-hour 
mark.  
 
Patients will be instructed to measure ketone bodies in urine samples daily with Ketostix 
(Bayer) and record it in diary provided. If ketone bodies in urine measure +2 or greater 
(>4mM in urine), patients are required to notify the research center.  
 
The lower dose of 5µg exenatide will be used for the acute effects testing part of the study. 
This will help to reduce the risk of GI side effects which commonly happen when first 
starting exenatide and is increased with the higher dose. Such side effects including 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, feeling jittery, dizziness, headache, acid stomach, 
constipation, and weakness  may lead to, in addition to increase risk and discomfort to 
patients, increased drop -out rates and erroneous results. This is in part is ba sed on our 
experience conducting these acute single dose studies.  
 
21.[ADDRESS_27836] risks to the subjects that 
are currently unforeseeable.

- Dapagliflozin and its matching placebo tablets will be supplied in bottles.  
- Exenatide extended release vials 2.0 mg/vial and matching placebo will be 
provided in one month kits containing:  
• One carton containing 4 vials of active or placebo powder  
• One carton containing 4 prefilled syringes with diluent, 5 vial adaptors and 
8 needles.  
- Exenatide for acute study with matching placebo will be provide in vials (3ml) of 
0.25mg/ml for subcutaneous injection using 0.3ml Ultra -thin BD needles. The 
lower dose of 5µg exenatide will be used for the acute effects testing part of the 
study. This will help to reduce the risk of GI side effects which commonly happen 
when first starting exenatide and is increased with the higher dose. Such side 
effects including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, feeling jittery, dizziness, headache,

  6 2  INTRODUCTIO N 
 
2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
Background:  Hispanic women and children who become overweight or obese are at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_48075], type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease later in life. Interdisciplinary interventions which 
target Hispanic women and their 3 -5-year old children to im prove nutrition and physical activity behaviors, 
manage adiposity and weight in mothers, and prevent excessive adiposity and weight gain trajectory in their 
children offer promise to break the intergenerational cycle.  
Methods:  Using a randomized two -group , repeated measures experimental design, the goal of the proposed 
study is to investigate the efficacy of a [ADDRESS_50741] to help overweight and obese Hispanic mothers and 
their children improve adiposity, weight (trajectory for children), health behaviors (nutrition and physical 
activity), and  self-efficacy We will partner with two federally qualified health departments in Durham and 
Chatham counties, North Carolina to enroll participants. We will partner with community centers to deliver the 
intervention. A total of 294 Hispanic women with a B MI>25 kg/m2 and 294 Hispanic 3 -5-year old children with a 
>25th BMI percentile will be enrolled over 4 years and randomized to the experimental or equal attention control 
group. Data will be collected at Time 1 (0 months [baseline]) to Time 2 (9 months [co mpletion of the 
intervention]) and Time 1 to Time 3 (15 months [after [ADDRESS_50742] from the study staff]). Data 
collected will include adiposity in mothers and children and weight (primary outcomes: BMI in mothers and BMI 
percentile in the chil dren). Secondary outcomes will include health behaviors and self -efficacy in the mothers 
and in the children. We will also evaluate the cost of delivering the program for public health departments. We 
will use general linear mixed models to test the hypoth eses.  
Discussion:  Decreasing overweight and obesity in Hispanic women and slowing adiposity and weight gain 
trajectory in young Hispanic children is urgently needed to decrease morbidity, mortality, and future health care 
costs.  
2.2 BACKGROUND   
 
There is an urgent need to prevent excessive adiposity and weight gain trajectory in Hispanic children. 
Overweight ( BMI > 85th and < 95th percentile)  and obesity ( > 95th percentile)  are prevalent in both genders, 
affect all ages, and cross all ethnic groups, though minority children from families with lower incomes and less 
education are particularly high -risk [1]. The prevalence of overweight and obesity in 2 -to-19 year old Hispanic 
youth is 38.9%, non -Hispanic Black youth is 35.2%, and non -Hispanic White youth is 28.5% [1]. Obesity 
increases risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_48076], type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [2, 3]. Childhood obe sity 
is estimated to cost $[ADDRESS_50743] medical costs in the [LOCATION_002] (U.S.) [4, 5].  
 
There are currently 55.3 million Hispanics living in the U.S. [6]. In 2014, Hispanics accounted for 9% of the 
population in N.C. [6]. Overweight and obesity in Hispanic mothers and their children involve a complex 
interplay between acculturation, the food environment, the built environment, the influence of media, and a lack 
of support  [7]. Many Hispanic men work long hours, while mothers stay home to care for their children without 
close family support [7]. Greater acculturation is significantly associated with increased consumption of fast 
foods and decreased moderate -to-high intensity exercise [8, 9]. Many communities where Hispanics li ve lack 
access to healthy affordable food and have only one -third as many supermarkets as other communities [10]. 
Confronted with an abundance of low cost, calorie -dense, high fat food, and limite d access to fresh produce. 
Hispanics increase their intake of calories and fat and decrease their intake of fruits and vegetables [7, 11].

Protocol   2019 -06-19

Transportation, infrastructure, and safety issues limit Hispanic mothers’ and children’s options for physical 
activity. Mothers engage in less physical activity than in their home country where most did not own cars, 
televisions, or computers and they were  more likely to include physical activity in their everyday life [7, 11]. 
Hispanic parents also report barriers to their children’s physical activity [12], including neighborhood safety and 
transportation problems [12]. Hispanic children (25.9%) are less likely than non -Hispanic White children 
(46.6%) to be involved in organized physical activity  outside of school [12]. The media also contributes to the 
lack of healthy eating and physical activity. In 2015, advertisers spent more than $7.8 billion on restaurant, 
food, and beverage advertising targeting Hisp anic households [13]. Hispanic children spend more time 
watching television than non -Hispanic White children (321 minutes per day versus 216 minutes) [14], and the 
number of hours spent watching television is positively associated with overweight and obesity [15, 16].  
 
Mothers influence children’s nutrition and physical activity behaviors by [CONTACT_48126], structuring 
children’s activities, and selecting content and portion sizes of meals [17-20]. Mothers have more  influence 
when children are in the preschool stage than in later stages of development [21]. Four year olds are able to 
pay attention to activities, think in logical steps, have good language skills, run, jump, skip, and socially and 
emotionally they start to share, cooper ate and take turns [22]. We propose to teach mothers strategies to 
improve their own nutrition and physical activity behaviors, build their self -efficacy, and learn how to help their 
children eat healthier and increase physical activity. We will focus on 3-5-year-olds because our pi[INVESTIGATOR_48077] [23]. 
 
Nutrition and physical activity programs used in the general population that were found to be most effective 
incorporated both behavioral and cognitive strategies and included parental involvement [19, 24, 25]. To date, 
we have found no interventions that have been developed to help overweight or obese Hispanic mother s 
manage their weight and prevent excessive adiposity and weight gain trajectory in their young children using a 
culturally and language tailored intervention.  We propose to test the efficacy of a nutrition and physical activity 
education, copi[INVESTIGATOR_48078], and physical activity intervention ( Healthy Mothers -Healthy Children 
Intervention) tailored to Hispanic mothers and using an age -appropriate nutrition and physical activity 
intervention for their 3-5-year-old children (Color Me Healthy) [26]. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_48079], cognitive restructuring, assertiveness training and conflict resolution to improve self -efficacy 
[27-31]. We will provide support as mothers they increase their self -efficacy and practice new nutrition and 
physical activity behaviors and help their children eat healthier and increase phys ical activity.  
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_50744] (IRB) approval was obtained from The University of North Carolina at  
Chapel Hill (UNC -CH). Using a randomized two -group, repeated measures experimental design, the goal of 
the proposed study is to investigate the efficacy of a [ADDRESS_50745] to help overweight and obese Hispanic mothers improve 
adiposity, weight, health behaviors and self -efficacy and their 3 -5-year old children improve their adiposity and 
weight gain trajectory. We will partner with two federally qualified health departments in two North Carolina 

Healthy Mothers -Healthy Children   Version 2  
Protocol   2019 -06-19

  8 counties to enroll Hispanic women and their 3 -5-year old children and we will partner with community centers 
to delive r the intervention.  
 
Inclusion criteria for mothers will be age 18 years or older; self -identification as Hispanic heritage; limited  
English proficiency and little acculturation, as measured by [CONTACT_48127] a 
score from 1.00 to 2.99; ability to understand spoken Spanish; a BMI >25kg/m 2; residence with the child; 
consent to join the study and consent for their child to join the study. Inclusion criteria for children will be age 3 -
5-years; ability to understand spoken Spani sh; a BMI > 25 th percentile for age and gender; and mother’s 
consent for them to join the study. Health care providers will not be asked to give permission for either mothers 
or children to join the study. Mothers will fill out a health history questionnai re to ascertain if they have a heart 
murmur, congenital heart disease, family history of sudden death, difficulty walking or exercising or history of 
psychological problems that would prevent participation in group classes. A sports physical will be conduc ted 
by a bilingual nurse practitioner on all mothers during baseline data collection to ensure that they have no 
medical problems that would prohibit physical activity. If a mother answers yes to any of these health history 
questions or the nurse practitio ner finds a heart murmur or any other concerns, she will be excluded from the 
study and referred to a health care provider. Dyads will be enrolled in eight cohorts over four years. Each 
cohort will be enrolled over a [ADDRESS_50746] the time to 
attend class with their child. After enrollment and baseline assessment, dyads will be randomized to either the 
intervention or control group using a computer -generated randomization table, stratifying by [CONTACT_1717], 
overweight (<30 kg/m 2) and obese (>30kg/m 2), and utilizing blocking to help ensure balance between the 
groups. Mothers will be informed of their group ass ignment by [CONTACT_756].  
 
Data will be collected at Time 1 (Baseline [0 months]), Time 2 (Post Intensive Intervention and  
Continued Support [9 months]), and Time 3 (6 -Months after Completion of Continued Support [15 months]).  
Data collected will include adiposity (primary outcome) in mothers and children (waist circumference, triceps 
and subscapular skinfolds), weight status (primary outcome) in the mothers (body mass index [BMI]) and  
BMI percentile in the children, health behaviors in the mothers  (Adult Health Behavior Questionnaire,  
Lifestyle Health Promoting Profile II, 3 day 23 -5-Hour Food Recall, and 7 day Accelerometer) and in the 
children (3 day 24 -Hour Food Recall and 7 day Accelerometer). Self -Efficacy in the mothers (Eating Self - 
Efficacy  Scale and Exercise Self -Efficacy Scale) will also be measured. We will also evaluate the cost of 
delivering the program for public health departments. Data analysis will use general linear mixed models to test 
the hypotheses. Both intervention and control  group mothers will each receive $50 after each data collection  
and $5 each time they come to class or data collection to help with transportation costs . 
 
The mothers in the Healthy Mothers -Healthy Children Intervention group will receive a 12 week Intensi ve 
Intervention and 6 months of Continued Support. The Intensive Intervention will include 60 minutes of nutrition 
and exercise education and copi[INVESTIGATOR_48080] a 45 minute physical activity class and a home -based 
physical activity program each wee k for 12 weeks. The Continued Support classes for the mothers in the 
intervention group will include 60 minutes of classroom discussion regarding problems they are having with 
nutrition and physical activity for themselves and their children and a 45 minut e physical activity class monthly 
for 6 months. The children in the intervention group will receive an Intensive Intervention (105 minutes total), 
which will include 60 minutes of Color Me Healthy classes and 45 minutes of free play weekly for 12 weeks. 
The Continued Support classes for the intervention children will include a review of the Color Me Healthy 
classes and 45 minutes of free play monthly for 6 months. Each weekly or monthly class for mothers and 
children is a total of 105 minutes.  
 
The equal attention control group mothers will receive English as a Second Language (ESL) classes for  
[ADDRESS_50747]. Santos ’s previous studies. It is not anticipated that the classes or data collection will 
cause any adverse ef fects, but participants will be encouraged to identify any concerns to the study staff.  
Identifying data will be kept s eparate from questionnaires and locked in the PI’ s filing cabinets and locked 
office. All adult and child participants will continue to receive routine medical care from their health care 
providers throughout the study. Referral to their health ca re provid er will be made if any adverse effects are 
self-identified There are no known social or legal risks for the women who consent to participate for themselves 
and consent for their children in this study.  
 
Adequacy of Protection a gainst Risks  
 
We will hire on ly bilingual staff, and all recruitment and intervention materials and instruments will be in  
Spanish. Two months before enrollment, the bilingual project manager will give a prese ntation to staff at both 
public health departments and place Spanish languag e posters and brochures in each waiting room.  
The posters and brochures will describe the benefits of good nutrition and physical activity and state the 
eligibility criteria for study participation. We will also put ads in local Spanish language newspapers  and 
announcements on the local Spanish language radio station with our toll free number. Bilingual RAs will be  
available in the waiting rooms on clinic days to share information about the  study with mothers of Hispanic 
heritage. Face -to-face information classes worked well in our feasibility and  pi[INVESTIGATOR_48081] -Healthy Children   Version [ADDRESS_50748] a private telephone screening and ask mothers’  height and weight 
and their child’s gender, birthdate, height, and weight, ca lculate  BMI for mothers and BMI percentile for 
children and ask the questions on The Short Acculturation Sc ale for Hispanics [52]. If both mother and child 
meet the study criteria, an appointment will be made to meet at  the community center to confirm eligibility ; the 
bilingual RAs will measure height and weight and con firm BMI and BMI percentile. If eligible, the RA will 
explain, in Spanish, the study, requirements of participa nts, and the risks and benefits of particip ating, and 
random assignment; and all questi ons will be answe red. Only the mother and one 3 -5 year-old child will be 
eligible to join the study. Childcare will be availabl e for other children the mother brings with her in addition to 
her 3 -5-year-old child. Data collection with mothe r-child dyads wi ll occur in the morning or early afternoon 
when the mother’s older children will b e in school. Physiological data collection will be done in a private room. 
Bilingual RAs will collect the following data in the same order: health history questionnaire, spor ts physical, 
height, weight, waist circumf erence, triceps and subscapular skinfolds. The mothers will fill out their 
questionnaires in a group with a  bilingual RA who will read all questionnaires in Spanish. Data collection will 
take [ADDRESS_50749] any further questions or concerns  
 
Confidentiality will be protected through a coding mechanism. The names of all participants will be removed 
from the data and a code number as signed. Each participant’s ide ntifying data will be separated from the study 
data, and the key identifying code numbers and the participant’s  identification will be kept by [CONTACT_48128] a 
locked file cabinet in a locked office that only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_17446] p rojec t manager will have access to. Data will be 
reported in aggregate form without identifying information by s ite or individual. All research study personnel will 
be trained in IRB and HIPAA guidelines to maintain the security and confidentiality of the data.  Mothers will be 
made aware of the precautions that the research team will take in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_48082]. All identifying 
information will be destroyed at the e arliest possible time following completion of the study. Publications arising

opportunity for physical activity. The equal attention control grou p will receive English as Second  
Language classes and the equal attention control group children will receive free play while their mothers are 
in class. Collection of data on mother’s weight, adiposity, health behavior, and self -efficacy and children’s 
weight and adiposity outcomes should provide information for women to share with their health care providers 
regarding efforts they are making to improve health behaviors in themselves and with their children.  
 
2.3.3  ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
 
See 2.3.1 above for assessment of potential risks and benefits  
3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS   
  
Aim 1:  Test the efficacy of the intervention in slowing adiposity and weight  gain trajectory and improving health 
behaviors (nutrition and physical activity) in 3-5-year-old Hispanic children from Time 1 (0 months [baseline]) to 
Time 2 (9 months [completion of the intervention]) and Time 1 to Time 3 (15 months [after [ADDRESS_50751] from the study staff]).  
Aim 2:  Test the efficacy of the intervention  in decreasing adiposity and  weight and improving health behaviors 
and self -efficacy in overweight or obese Hispanic mothers from Time 1 to Time 2 and from Time 1 to Time 3.  
Primary outcomes  include slowing of c hild adiposity ( waist circumference and triceps and subscapular 
skinfol ds) and weight gain ( BMI percentile) trajectory and a decrease in mother’s adiposity and weight (BMI). 
We hypothesize  that intervention group childr en will slow the trajectory of adiposity and weight gain and 
intervention group mothers will decrease adiposity and weight significantly more than the control group.  
Secondary outcomes  include c hild and mothers health behaviors (nutrition and physical activity) and mother’s 
self-efficacy (nutrition and physical activity). We hypothesize  that intervention group children and mothers will 
improve health behaviors and mothers will improve self -efficacy significantly more than the cont rol group.  
Aim 3:  Identify the media tors through which the intervention influence s the trajectory of adiposity  and weight 
gain in children  and decrease in adiposity and weight in mothers. We hypothesize that h ealth behaviors and 
self-efficacy may mediate a diposity and weight loss in mothers and nutrition and physical activity behaviors in 
children may  mediate  a slower adiposity and weight gain trajectory.   
Aim 4:  Calculate the cost of implementing the interventi on for public health departments  and the costs  for 
mothers participating, from Time 1  to Time 2 and compare these costs to the outcomes of the intervention 
(cost -effectiveness) and the potential economic benefits of these outcomes (cost -benefit analysis) . We 
hypothesize  that the intervention is primarily focused on knowledge and behaviors in an at -risk population and 
may be cost -effective in comparison wi th other approaches to managing overweight and obesity.

category benefit equally from t he intervention in adiposity, weight, health behaviors, and self -efficacy.     
[ADDRESS_50752] en and a 45 minute physical activity class monthly 
for 6 months. The children in the intervention group will receive an intensive intervention (105 minutes total), 
which will include 60 minutes of Color Me Healthy classes [26] and 45 minutes of free play weekly for 12 
weeks. The continued support classes for the intervention children will include a review of the Color Me 
Healthy classes [26] and 45 minutes of free play monthly for 6 months. Each weekly or monthly class for 
mothers and children is a total of 105 minutes. The equal attention control group mothers will receive English 
as a Second Language (ESL) classes for 105 minutes for 12 weekly classes and then monthly classes for 6 
more months. The equal attention control group mothers will receive homework assignments to help them 
practice their English language skills. The homework handouts will be at the same frequency as the Healthy 
Mothers -Healthy Children Intervention  group mothers. The equal attenti on control group children will receive 
105 minutes of free play for 12 weekly classes and then 6 monthly free play classes.   
Data will be collected at Time 1 (0 months [baseline]), Time 2 (9 months [completion of the intervention]) and 
Time 3 (15 months [after [ADDRESS_50753] from the study staff]). Time 2 data will determine the 
magnitude of the intervention eff ects after the intensive interven tion and continued s upport; Time [ADDRESS_50754] length of time for follow -up in weight reduction 
studies, and gives mothers and children the time necessary to make changes in health behaviors [19]. 
4.2 SCIENTIFIC R ATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
The study design will use a two -group randomized repeated measures study design to evaluate the efficacy of 
the intervention with 294 dyads of overweight or obese Hispanic mother s and their 3 -5 year old children.  
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR INTERVENTION  
The intervention was pi[INVESTIGATOR_48083] -to-face in this population and was found to be feasible and acceptable.

  13 A participant is considered to ha ve completed the study if she and her child has completed Time 1 (baseline), 
Time 2 (9 months) and Time 3 (15 months) data collection.  
5 STUDY POPULATION  
 
Settings.  The study will build upon established partnerships between The University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill, the Chatham County Health Department and Durham County Health Department. Bilingual 
research assistants (RAs) will distribute brochures, give mothers information about the study, answer 
questions and enroll mother -child dyads. This approach  worked well in previous studies [32, 33]. In 2015, the 
Chatham County Health Department provided 82,314 medical visits and 42% (34,572) were provided to 
Hispanic adult s and children and the Durham County Health Department provided 78,123 visits and 46% 
(35,936) were provided to Hispanic adults and children. In 2015, the Durham County Health Department had 
650 Hispanic mother and 4 -year old child dyads and the Chatham Co unty Health Department had 800 
Hispanic mother and 4 -year old child dyads (Total = 1,450; Mean = 725). A total of 78% of Hispanic mothers 
are overweight or obese [34]. Thus it is anticipated that approximately 78% of the mothers at both sites will 
meet inclusion criteria (n = 1,131), and 50% (n = 565) will agree to participate with their 4 -year-old child. Of 
those who agree to participate (n = 565), approximately 70% (n = 396) will score a 1.00 -2.99 on the Short 
Acculturation Questionnaire for Hispanics establishing low acculturation [35]. These numbers are adequate to 
meet our projected enrollment of [ADDRESS_50755] done in previous studies (see Letters of Support). The public 
health departments and community centers are situated in the communities where participant s live and they 
are either within walking distance from their homes or on bus lines, increasing the probability of successful 
recruitment and retention for the proposed study. In previous studies, the mothers drove to the community 
centers together [23]. The centers have classrooms and playgrounds.  
 
Sample.  Inclusion criteria for mothers will be age 18 years or older; self -identification as Hispanic; limited English 
proficiency; l ittle acculturation, as measured by [CONTACT_48129] [35] with a score from 
1.00 to 2.99; ability to understand spoken Spanish; a BMI >25kg/m2; residence with the child; consent to join the 
study and  consent for their child to join the study. Inclusion crite ria for children will be age 3 -5-years; ability to 
understand spoken Spanish; and a BMI > 25th percentile for age and gender. Health care providers will not be 
asked to give permission for mother -child dyads to join the study. Mothers will fill out a health history 
questionnaire to ascertain if they have a heart murmur, congenital heart disease, family history of sudden death, 
difficulty exercising or psychological problems that would prevent partic ipation. A sports physical will be 
conducted by a bilingual nurse practitioner on all mothers during baseline data collection to ensure that they 
have no medical problems. If a mother answers yes to any of these health history questions or the nurse 
practi tioner finds a heart murmur or any other concerns, she will be excluded from the study and referred to a 
health care provider. Dyads will be enrolled in eight cohorts over four years. Each cohort will be enrolled over a 
1-month period.  
5.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA  
 
Inclusion criteria for mothers will be age 18 years or older; self -identification as Hispanic; limited English 
proficiency; little acculturation, as measured by [CONTACT_48129] [35] with a score 
from 1.00 to 2.99; ability to understand spoken Spanish; a BMI >25kg/m2; residence with the child; consent to 
join the study and consent for their child to join the study. Inclusion crite ria for children will be age 3 -5-years; 
ability to understand spoken Spanish; and a BMI > 25th percentile for age and gender.  
5.[ADDRESS_50756] no medical problems. If a  mother answers yes to any of these health history questions or 
the nurse practitioner finds a heart murmur or any other concerns, she will be excluded from the study and 
referred to a health care provider.  
5.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS  
N/A 
5.[ADDRESS_50757] Spanish language posters and brochures in each waiting room. The 
posters and brochures will describe  the benefits of good nutrition and physical activity  and state the eligibility 
criteria for study participation. We wi ll also put ads in local Spanish language newspapers and announcements 
on the local Spanish language radio station with our toll free number. Bilingual RAs will be available in the 
waiting rooms on clinic days to share information about th e study with Hisp anic mothers . Face -to-face 
information classes  worked well in our feasibility and pi[INVESTIGATOR_48084]  a sufficient 
number of participants each week  [23]. If mothers are interested, the RAs will privately record their name [CONTACT_48166] d schedule them for an enrollment screening telephone call . This technique also worked 
well in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], wh ich included mother -child dyads  with limited English p roficiency [23]. Of 82 mother -
child dyads approached in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], 68% ( n = 56) consented to participate  over 1 month [23].  We plan to enroll 
approximately [ADDRESS_50758] a private telephone screening and ask mothers’ height and weig ht 
and their child’s gender, birthdate , height, a nd weight, calculate BMI for mothers and BMI percentile for 
children and ask the questions on The Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanics [35]. If both mother and child 
meet the study criteria, an appointment will be made to meet at the community center to confirm eligibility; the 
bilingual RAs will measure height and weight and confirm  BMI and BMI percentile.  If eligible, the  RA will 
explain, in Spanish , the study, requirements of participants, and the risks and benefits of participating , and 
random assignment; and all questions will be answered . Only the mother and one 3-5-year-old child will be 
eligible to join the study. Childcare will be available for other children the mother brings with her in addition to 
her 3 -5-year-old child. Data collection with mother -child dyads  will occur in the morn ing or early afternoon  
when the mother’s older children will be in school. Physiological data collection will be done in a private room. 
Bilingual RAs will collect  the following data in the same order:  health history questionnaire, sports physical, 
height, weight, waist circumference, triceps and subscapular skinfolds. The mothers will fill out their 

Healthy Mothers -Healthy Children   Version [ADDRESS_50759] attrition rates ranging from 10 %-30% [19]. To strengthen retention, 
our classes will be interactive, with culturally and linguistically tailored content developed  to engage and 
sustain  the interest  of the mother -child dyads.  Mothers who miss class will be offered a make -up class over the 
phone, and reminded when the next class will be held. Additional incentives will  include c hildcare for other 
children who accompany mothers and their 3-5-year-olds to cla ss and  recipe s and handouts in Spanish on 
how to improve their children’s  nutrition and physical activity behaviors . Mothers will be asked for telephone 
numbers of several family members and permission to call the m if we cannot reach the m. We will  be as fl exible 
as possible in scheduling enrollment  and data collection appointments and provide tokens of appreciation suc h 
as birthday cards and a quarterly  newsletter with updates on the study. Mothers in both groups will receive $25  
after each data collection. These approaches proved successful in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_48085] t study with Hispanic mothers with 
limited English proficiency, where attrition was only 9% -15% [23] and those mothers  who stopped coming had 
moved out of the state. We will make every effort to keep our attrition rate lower than the projected 15%. If 
retention rates drop below 85%, we will contact [CONTACT_48130].

6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S)  ADMINISTRATION .   
 
6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION  OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  DESCRIPTION  
Intensive Intervention for Mothers  
The intensive intervention classes are based on the classes from our Family Partners for Health study, 
adapted for Hispanic mothers with limited English proficie ncy and their 3 -5-year-old children [23, 36, 37]. 
Classes will be run by a bilingual interventionist and will be 60 minutes long with 1 8-19 mothers. We chose 18 -
19 mothers since the enrollment is rolling and these mothers will be enrolled together and this cohort approach 
worked well in our previous studies [23, 37]. Classes will include nutrition and physical activity education and 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_48086], assertiveness training, cognitive restructuring, and conflict 
resolution around problems of nutrition and physical activity for mothers and t heir children. The nutrition 
classes will include content on understanding calories, protein, carbohydrates and fat, making healthy 
substitutes that are culturally acceptable, choosing healthy foods when eating out at a favorite fast food 
restaurant, using  actual menus, and understanding how portion control can make a difference for them and 
their children using food models and food labels in Spanish. Mothers will receive information on how to shop as 
economically as possible and how to shop at local farmer s’ markets, which are geographically close to the 
mother’s homes, where they may have better access to fresh fruits and vegetables. At the end of each class, 
mothers will be asked to set a nutrition or physical activity goal for the coming week for themsel ves and their [ADDRESS_50760] days of the week with their 3 -5-year old child. Missed physical activity classes will 
not be made up. Mothers in the intervention group will be encouraged to develop their own home -based 
physical activity program using suggesti ons given in the physical activity class and a home -based physical 
activity handout in Spanish given after each physical activity class ti increase their and their child’s physical 
activity. The handouts will be reviewed with the mothers and physical activ ities demonstrated by [CONTACT_48131].  
 
Intensive Intervention for Children  
 
The children’s classes will include a [ADDRESS_50761] 1 teacher and 3 teacher assistants to 
ensure safety. The Color Me Healthy [26] curriculum, which consists of 12 classes in Spanish, was purchased 
and used for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] [23]. All of the classes are at a [ADDRESS_50762] will give mothers a Color Me Healthy [26] 
handout in Spanish that includes strategies for feeding their children healthier meals and snacks and 
increasing their daily physical activity. While their mothers are in physical activity class, the children will have  
45 minutes  of physical activity (supervised free play) in a playground at the community center or dance and 
actively play with the bilingual interventionist if it is raining.  
 
Continued Support  for Mothers and Children  
 
During continued support, intervention mother -child dyads will return to the community center for classes once 
a month for [ADDRESS_50763] to review a class from the Color Me Healthy  [26] 
curriculum for [ADDRESS_50764] will call and ask how the mother and child are doing and give the date of the next class. 
Continu ed support classes will not be made up.  
 
Equal Attention Control Group  
 
Mothers  in the control group will receive English as a Second Language (ESL) classes taught by [CONTACT_48132]; they will receive the same number of contacts and time as the intervention group mothers (105 
minutes weekly for 12 weeks and 105 minutes mon thly for 6 months). The ESL classes will be offered because 
when exit interviews were conducted after the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] [23], mothers were asked if they “were not in the 
intervention  group, what type of classes would they want?” The mothers (90%) wanted ESL classes to improve 
their English. Providing these classes to the control group most likely will improve enrollment and retention. 
Children in the control group will have free play while their mothers are in class and will receive the same number 
of contacts and times as the children in the intervention group (105 minutes weekly for 12 weeks and 105 minutes 
monthly for 6 months). The control classes will be held on separate days of t he week from the intervention 
classes in the same community centers. Data will be collected from the mother -child dyads in the control group 
at Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3; and the mothers will receive $[ADDRESS_50765] completed Time 3 data. Attrition rates in our previous studies were equal in the intervention and control 
groups and ranged from 9% to 15% [23]. 
6.1.2  ADMINISTRATION  AND/OR DOSING  
 
See 6.1.[ADDRESS_50766] structured the fidelity of the intervention using the NIH five category Treatment Fidelity Framework 
[38]. For category one, treatment design , both the intervention and control condition will receive different 
content but will be the same length, number, and duration of contact [CONTACT_48133]. The bilingual interventionists 
will have experience teaching health interventions, and the theoretical model is clearly articulated. For category 
two, training , the bilingual interventionists  will be trained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_48087]. 
For category three, delivery of the intervention , integrity will be assessed by [CONTACT_48134] a checklist to score classes based on pre -
identified content, and drift will be defined as teaching less than 80% of protocol content. If drift occurs, the 
bilingual interventionists  will be retrained until the pro tocol is followed consistently. W e will also  use a list of 
behavioral indicators to assess the interventionists ’ skills in facilitating classes, engaging mother -child dyads, 
role playing, problem solving, providing positive feedback, and goal setting. Retraining will be prov ided if 
proble ms are found. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]  [23], we had little difficulty in maintaining consistency of the intervention. 
The bilingual interventionists  will collect data on attendance at e ach class, reasons for non -attendance, and 
make -up classes  provided. Category four, receipt of treatment , will be evaluated during the class by [CONTACT_48135]. Category five, enactment o f 
intervention skills , will be evaluated during the six monthly continued support classes by [CONTACT_48131].  
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS : RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
 
After enrollment and baseline assessment, dyads  will be randomized to either the intervention or control group 
using a computer -generated randomization table , stratifying by [CONTACT_1717], overweight (25 – 29.9 kg/m2) and 
obese ( >30 kg/m2), and utilizing blocking to help ensure balance between the groups . Mothers w ill be informed 
of their group assignment by [CONTACT_756]. We have not included fathers, as in previous studies in this population, 
because the majority of fathers work 6 days a week and cannot attend class [7, 23]. Data collection research 
assistants will be blinded to group status.

Principal  Inves tigator  – Hudson Santos , PhD, RN 
Study Overvi ew 
The overall goal of this project is to determine whether a nutrition and physical activity education, copi[INVESTIGATOR_48088], exercise program, and a home -based exercise program will decrease adiposity  and weight, and 
improve health behaviors and self -efficacy in mothers  of Hispanic heritage and slow excessive adiposity and 
weight gain in their 4 -year old children.  The DSMP  outlined below  for the proposed study will  adhere  to the 
protocol  approved by [CONTACT_48136] (UNC -CH) Institutional Review Board  (IRB) 
and the National Institutes of Health  (NIH)  and the National Institute of Nursing Research  (NINR) .  
  
SECTION A. Monitoring Entity  
 
Considering the study rationale, population, procedures, and the risk: benefit profile as outlined, the overall risk 
level for participation in this study is classifi ed as no more than minimum risk.  
 
1)  Individual Roles and Responsibilities  
 
An Exec utive Committee  will be formed  to oversee the conduct of the study.  The committee  will be comprised  of 
nine members:  [CONTACT_48167]  (Principal Investigator [PI]) and the Study Investigators, Drs. Ammerman, Crandell, 
Evenson,  Faith, Peragallo -Montano, Perreira, Perrin, and Waters . The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_48089],  which  will 
meet monthly  to review  the activities  of the  study  including  management,  personnel,  recruitment,  performance,  
and any emer ging problems.  
 
The Independent  Monitor  (ISM) for this study  will be  [CONTACT_48168]. [CONTACT_48169]  has been  the Inaugural Assist ant 
Director  for Operations  of the Office  of Human  Research  Ethics at UNC -CH, which was preceded  by [CONTACT_48137]  (SON)  IRB. [CONTACT_48169]  is not associated  with this research  
project  and thus works  independently  of the PI . [CONTACT_48169]  is not one of the key personnel involved  in this grant.  
She is qualifi ed to review  the participant  safety  data generated  by [CONTACT_48138] .  
 
B. Procedures for Safety, Risk, and Confidentiality  
 
1) Monitoring Study Safety  
 
From the initial screening of participant s by [CONTACT_48139] (GCP) and regulations 
pertaining to the Conduct of Human Participant Research to weekly cont act with participants to internal 
monthly quality control audits and protocol fidelity monitoring to the real -time review of adverse events (AE) 
and serious adverse events (SAEs) by [CONTACT_978], Study Investigators and the ISM, the study will be carefully 
overs ighted.

  21 Drs. Santos , Ammerman, Crandell (Study Statistician), Evenson, Faith , Lynn (ISM) Peragallo -Montano, Perreira, 
Perrin , and Waters will revi ew the data for this study quarterly . We will examine participant accrual and  
adherence to the protocol regarding demographics and inclusion and exclusion criteria, and compliance of 
treatment, AE and SAE rates quarterly, and report regarding statistical power implications of dropouts and 
missing data annually.  
 
Data  on compliance  to the intervention  will be collec ted weekly  by [CONTACT_21124] ( PM) and reviewed  
quarterly  by [CONTACT_941] S tudy Investigators,  Study S tatistician,  and the ISM. Compliance  on the part of participants  will 
be evaluated  by [CONTACT_48140].  If intervention attendance  drops  
below 85%,  the mothers  who have  stopped  coming  will be called to ask for feedback.  Using information  gained  
from these  phone  interviews,  the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_48090]  a meeting  with the Study Investigators and the ISM to discuss  
methods  for improving  compliance.  
 
As in previous studies, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_48091] a system to 
ensure the verification of source data compliance. The source data will include original records necessary for 
the reconstruction and evaluatio n of the clinical trial. It will be clear who documented the data, documentation 
will be readable, signatures identifiable, contemporaneous, original copy, accurate and consistent, long -lasting 
and durable, available and accessible, complete, consistent, c redible, and corroborated. All data will be first 
checked by [CONTACT_48141] (RAs) at different times. REDCap will be used as our Re search 
Electroni c Data Capture System. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_48092] u sed it in previous studie s and 
REDCap i s supported by [CONTACT_11604] -CH. The REDCap database creation will be oversighted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Crandell ( Study 
Statistician). [CONTACT_48170] will run comparisons  and trained RAs  will compare against source data and make 
corrections as needed. A data log book w ill be created to establish an audit t rail for compliance as the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_48093] .  
 
Drs. Santos , Ammerman, Crandell, Evenson, Faith, Peragallo -Montano, Perreira Perrin, and Waters  will 
personally conduct and supervise the study. We will regi ster the study in ClinicalTrials.gov. We will follow the 
protocol and ensure all study staff follow the protocol. All staff assisting with the study will be informed of their 
obligations. We will ensure informed consent, approval and reporting. We will rep ort to the NIH/NINR Program 
Officer, [CONTACT_48171], any AEs or SAEs. We will maintain adequate records and make them available for 
inspection. We will ensure initial and continuing review by [CONTACT_11604] -CH IRB and will report all changes to research 
and involving  risks to subjects, and not make any changes without IRB approval except where necessary to 
eliminate immediate hazards. All of the study team are CITI trained and follow the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
Guidelines.  
 
2)   Minimizing Research -Associated Risk  
 
Diligent study safety monitoring will be conduct ed by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_48094]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_48095] a 
schedule of selected cases to ensure compliance with IRB requirements. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_48096] c losely with the IRB in previous studies providing the data requested for audits as required. Risks to 
human subjects will be minimized through the utilization of establish protocols that have worked well in 
previous studies. We are aware that AEs and SAEs may occur and an Adverse Event Monitoring C ommittee 
will monitor their occurrence and the overall risk of the study to both m others and their children.  
 
Mothers  who express fatigue during sessions will be excused from the session and another time convenient for 
them will be scheduled to  make up the content. If a mother  expresses fatigue during data collection, the data 
collection session will be terminated immedi ately, and a follow -up appointment scheduled. No mothers 
expressed fatigue in the PI ’s previous studies. It is not anticipated that the classes or data collection will cause 
any adverse effects, but participants will be encouraged to identify any concerns to the study staff. All mothers 
and their children  will continue to receive routine medical care from their health care providers throughout the 
study. Referral to their health care provider will be made if any adverse effects are self -identified There are  no

3)  Protecting Confidentiality of Participant data Participant Screening and Enrollment  
 
All data from participants screened for the study will be entered into  the REDCap  electronic study database. 
Designated research staff will collect, gather, and enter required data ( written informed consent, Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) authorization, medical history and demographics) onto 
study data forms. Screened patients who do not meet study eligibility will have specific screening data entered 
into the study database. The collected data will be helpful in examining the patient population and feasibility of 
enrollment criteria and will include gender, age, race and reason for exclusion. All dates will be shifted and 
other Personal Health Information (PHI) will be removed from the study database upon study completion. All 
data obtained from this study will be used for research purposes only and will comply with Federal HIPAA 
regulations.   
 
Written  informed consent  will be obtained from each  participant  at entry  into the study.  Informed  consent  is 
obtained  by [CONTACT_48143]. The  participant  will be read the study  consent  form in Spanish. The  bilingu al 
PM or trained  bilingual  RA will meet  with the participant to  review  the form,  to confirm  the participant’s  
understanding  of the study,  and to answer  any questions that  the participant  might  have. Once  the participant  
demonstrates  understanding  of the study  and agrees  to participate  in the study,  the consent  will be signed  in the 
presence  of the bilingual PM or bilingual  RA. The IRB will oversight yearly renewal of consent forms and the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_48098].  
 
Confidentiality will be protected through coding mechanism s. The names of all participants will be removed from 
the data and a code number assigned. Each participant’s identifying data will be separated from the study data, 
and the key identifying code numbers and the participant’s identi fication will be kept by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a password 
protected computer in a locked o ffice that only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_48099]. Data will be reported in

in IRB and HIPAA guidelines to maintain the security and confident iality of the data. Mothers will be made aware 
of the precautions that the research team will take in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_48082]. All identifying information 
will be destroyed at the earliest possible time following completion of the study. Publicatio ns arising from the 
study will not contain personal information. All data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_10609], with no potential for individual 
participants to be identified.  
 
Case Report Forms. All proposed study specific case report forms (source documents) for data collection will 
be desi gned by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_48100] (eCRFs) for use in the study’s REDCap database. These study specific eCRFs source 
documents (study logs fo r correspondence, contacts , compensation and other forms such as pre -eligibility 
screens) will be coded by [CONTACT_47991]’s unique study identification number for all data collected including 
study instruments will be maintained in the par ticipant research record that will be made accessible to study 
monitors. Completed instruments that require a signature [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a paper CRF will be scanned and uploaded into 
the study database as well as maintained on file in accordance with UNC -CH policies and a pplicable Federal 
Regulations for the Conduct of Human Participant Research.

committee  will meet  every  [ADDRESS_50772]. Lynn  (Chair  and ISM ). 
 
2)  Reviewing.  Adverse events wil l be assessed and graded as follows.  
 
Expected/Anticipated —Identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current protocol, informed consent, 
investigator brochure, or with other current risk information.  

Healthy Mothers -Healthy Children   Version 2

  24  
Unexpected/Unan ticipated —Not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current protocol, informed 
consent, investigator brochure, or with other current risk information.  
 
More Prevalent —Occurs more frequently than anticipated or at a higher prevalence than expe cted.  
 
Serious —Results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48101], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, cancer, overdose, or causes a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.  
  
The relationship of AE to study particip ation will be determined by [CONTACT_48146].  
 
Unrelated —There is not a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641], 
device or intervention.  
 
Possibly Related —The adverse event may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641], device, or intervention,  however 
there is insufficient information to determine the likelihood of this possibility.  
 
Related —There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may h ave been caused by [CONTACT_33641], device 
or intervention.  
  
3)  Reporting.  The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_48102]/NINR ([CONTACT_48172]) and UNC -CH’s IRB in compliance with their requirements.   
 
Any AE will be reported by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_48103]. An incident 
report will be created and sent by [CONTACT_48147] [INVESTIGATOR_48104]. Ammerman, Crandell (Study Staistician), 
Evenson, Faith , Lynn (ISM) Peragallo -Mont ano, Perreira, Perrin , and  the PM. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_48105] -up with the 
mother and child and will prepare a report. The AEs will be reviewed every three months and a report prepared 
for the Human Participants Committee and [CONTACT_48173] at NIH/NINR. Process notes will be kept concerning any 
decision s.  
 
Any SAE or deaths  that occur  during  the study  will be reported  by [CONTACT_48148]. Lynn  (ISM ) and to NIH/NINR  ([CONTACT_48171]) . 
An incident report  will be sent by [CONTACT_48149] [INVESTIGATOR_48104]. Ammerman, Crandell, Evenson, Faith , 
Peragallo -Montano, Perreira, Perrin , and  the PM. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_48105]-up imme diately  with the mother  and child  to 
investigate and  prepare  a report  for all members  of the Human  Participants  Committee and  comply  with all 
regulations  regarding the reporting  of SAEs . If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_48106],  [CONTACT_48174]  will be on-call in the PI’s 
absence.  The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_48107]. Perreira  in the PI’s absence will be responsible  for complying  with all regulations  
concerning  the reporting  of a SAE and will prepare a full report for NIH/NINR.  It is not expected  that the 
committee  will be involved in the decision  to terminate  the intervention  for a study  participant  related to any 
adverse  event. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_48108] ([CONTACT_48171]) and [CONTACT_48169] (I SM). Process  notes will be kept concerning  any decisio ns. 
 
4)  Examples of Poten tial Reportable Adverse Events. An AE is reportable is it meets all of the following 
criteria: 1) is unexpected 2) is related and/or possibly related, and 3) is serious and/or suggests that the 
research places subjects or others at a greater risk of physic al or psychological harm than was previously 
known or recognized. Additionally, pe r UNC -CH’s  policy all participant deaths, protocol deviations, complaints 
about the research, and breaches of confidentiality are reportable events.  
 

Healthy Mothers -Healthy Children   Version 2  
Protocol   2019 -06-19 
 
NIH Behavioral and Social Intervention Clinical Trial Protocol Template v3.0 - 20180827  
  25 An example of an AE wou ld be that a 3 -5-year old child decreases from the 25th percentile (normal or healthy 
weight) to below the 5th percentile (underweight) at the next data collection. The steps to be taken i nclude 
withdrawing the child and their mother  from the study . The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_48109]. Perrin (Pediatrician), 
[CONTACT_48169] (ISM), the IRB Contact [CONTACT_9702], and Program Officer [CONTACT_48173] at NIH/NINR. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_48110] 4 -year old child evaluated 
and ensure that follow -up was received.  
 
An example of an SAE would be the death of a participant from acute renal failure, which although would be 
viewed as unexpected and unrelated to the intervention is nonetheless a reportable serious event.  No further 
steps would be taken except to review, grade and report the event.  
 
5) Safety  Review  Plan . Study  progress  and safety  will be reviewed  monthly  (and more  frequently  if needed).  
Progress  reports, including participant  recruitment,  retention/attrit ion, and AEs will be provided  to [CONTACT_48175]  (ISM) 
following  each  of the monthly  reviews.  An annual  report  will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_48111] a list and summary  of 
AEs and SAEs . In addition,  the annual report  will address  (1) whether adverse  event  rates  are consistent  with 
pre-study  assumptions;  (2) reason  for dropouts  from the study; (3)  whether  all participan ts met entry  criteria;  (4) 
whether  conti nuation  of the study  is justified on  the basis  that additi onal data are needed  to accomplish  the 
stated  aims  of the study; and (5) conditions  whereby  [CONTACT_48150].  The annual  
report  will be signed  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Lynn  (ISM) and will be forwarded  to the IRB and NIH/NINR.  The IRB will review 
progress  of this study  on an annual  basis. 
 
SECTION D. Multi -Site Monitoring and Compliance  
This is not a multi -site study.  
  
SECTION E. Assessment of External Factors  
The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_48112] a semiannual assessment of external factors through a review of literature related to new 
developments in the areas of wound management, pain, exercise and other approaches that may have an 
impact on the safety of participants or on the ethic s of the study.  
  
SECTION F. Interim Analysis  
The PM will generate semi -annual qualitative interim analysis reports on data obtained during phone call and 
returned end -of-study surveys to understand issues related to the uptake, usability, and adoption of this 
platform among this population. We will evaluate the screening and enrollment procedures, barriers to 
participation and retenti on, acceptability, technology problems encountered if any, and user feedback from the 
participants and providers . This information gained from this structured process will be used to both guide the 
refinement of the current protocol and to inform the design of a larger efficacy trial. There are no planned 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_8441].

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
Aim 1:  Test the efficacy of the intervention in slowing adiposity and weight  gain trajectory and improving health 
behaviors (nutrition and physical activity) in 4 -year-old Hispanic children from Time 1 (0 months [baseline]) to 
Time 2 (9 months [completion of the intervention]) and Time 1 to Time 3 (15 months [after [ADDRESS_50774] from the study staff]).  

Healthy Mothers -Healthy Children   Version 2  
Protocol   2019 -06-19 
 
NIH Behavioral and Social Intervention Clinical Trial Protocol Template v3.0 - 20180827  
  27 Aim 2:  Test the efficacy of the intervention  in decreasing adiposity and  weight and improving health behaviors 
and self -efficacy in overweight or obese Hispanic mothers from Time 1 to Time 2 and from Time 1 to Time 3.  
Primary outcomes  include slowing of c hild adiposity ( waist circumference and triceps and subscapular 
skinfol ds) and weight gain ( BMI percentile) trajectory and a decrease in mother’s adiposity and weight (BMI). 
We hypothesize  that intervention group childr en will slow the trajectory of adiposity and weight gain and 
intervention group mothers will decrease adiposity and weight significantly more than the control group.  
Secondary outcomes  include c hild and mothers health behaviors (nutrition and physical activit y) and mother’s 
self-efficacy (nutrition and physical activity). We hypothesize  that intervention group children and mothers will 
improve health behaviors and mothers will improve self -efficacy significantly more than the control group.  
Aim 3:  Identify the  media tors through which the intervention influence s the trajectory of adiposity  and weight 
gain in children  and decrease in adiposity and weight in mothers. We hypothesize that h ealth behaviors and 
self-efficacy may mediate adiposity and weight loss in mothers and nutrition and physical activity behaviors in 
children may  mediate  a slower adiposity and weight gain trajectory.   
Aim 4:  Calculate the cost of implementing the interventi on for public health departments  and the costs for 
mothers participating, from Time 1  to Time 2 and compare these costs to the outcomes of the intervention 
(cost -effectiveness) and the potential economic benefits of these outcomes (cost -benefit analysis) . We 
hypothesize  that the intervent ion is primarily focused on knowledge and behaviors in an at -risk population and 
may be cost -effective in comparison wi th other approaches to managing overweight and obesity.  
Exploratory Aim: Determine whether intervention group mothers  in the overweight v ersus obese BMI 
category benefit equally from t he intervention in adiposity, weight, health be haviors, and self -efficacy.     
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
 
A total of 250 mother -child dyads, or 125 dyads in each randomized group, are expected to complete the 
study. However, we will enroll 294 mother -child dyads (n = 588 participants) or 147 dyads per group, to take 
into account a 15% attrition rate. Our previ ous studies with Hispanic mothers with limited English proficiency 
and their children have had attrition rates ranging from 9% to 15% [23, 33]. Power calculations were performed 
with POWERLIB20 SAS/IML modules, which incorporate methods described in Muller [39]. These methods 
calculate power for a general linear multivariate model that includes repeated measures data structures, of 
which a two -group longitudinal design is a special case. Power was calculated on the use of a separate 
multivariate model for each outcome addressed in the aims, incorporating measurements at all available time 
points. Effect size estimates were based on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] [23], where estimated within -subject correlation and 
standardized mean difference were .25 and .53, respectively, for mothers’ BMI and .30 and .59, respectively, 
for children’s BMI per centiles. For each outcome, power was computed for a test of the time by [CONTACT_48151] a two -sided significance level of .05. For an analyzable sample of 125 mother -child dyads per 
group (total of 250 mother -child dyads), calculated statistical power exceeds 95% for both the test of children’s 
BMI percentiles in Aim [ADDRESS_50775] of mothers’ BMI in Aim 2; if the within subject correlations and 
standardized mean differences are lower than observed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_48113] .20 and .45, respectively, statis tical 
power will nonetheless exceed 80%. A formal power analysis was not conducted for Aim 3 because the focus 
is on estimation (rather than testing) of direct and indirect mediation effects. Nonetheless, based on Shrout and 
Bolger [40], a sample size of 80 to 85 should provide power in the 70% to 85% range to detect medium effects 
of the intervention on the mediator (e.g., mat ernal self -efficacy), and the mediator on the outcomes (e.g.,

  28 mother’s BMI) with a two sided .[ADDRESS_50776] deviations, minimums, medians, and maximums will be determined for each continuous 
variable; frequencies and percentages will be tabulated for each categorical variable. Preliminary analyses will 
be performed to determine whether, despi[INVESTIGATOR_48114], the intervention and control groups were unbalanced 
on gender, age, or income. Any variable with an imbalance between the groups at baseline will be examined to 
determine whether it is related to any of the outcome variables.  If significant relation ships are identified, the 
variable will be included as a covariate in the models for the affected outcome(s) as a potential confounder. An 
intent -to-treat analysis will be used in which all subjects are included in the analysis and analyzed according to 
their initial randomized assignment.

Aim 1:  To test the efficacy of the intervention in decreasing trajectory of adiposity and weight gain in [ADDRESS_50777] longitudinal differences between the intervention and 
control group means for each outcome ac ross the study period. Mixed effects models, with a random intercept 
to account for between -mother or between -child differences, will be used f or repeated measures analyses  of 
each outcome (child BMI percentile, waist circumference, and triceps and subscap ular skinfolds).  The 
dependent variable will be will be the outcome at each of the three time points; the model will include time point 
(categorical), intervention group, and the interaction between the two.  A test of this interaction will serve as the 
overall test of intervention effect, and step -down tests will be conducted to compare Time [ADDRESS_50778] changed from Time 2 to Time 3, using a Hochberg 
correction to account for multiple compa risons  [41, 42]. Results will be summarized t hrough  the least -squares 
means for each group  at each time point and the mean difference and corres ponding 95% confidence interval .  
 
Aim 2:  To test the efficacy of the intervention in decreasing adiposity and weight in mothers, we will fit mixed 
models an alogous to those described for Aim 1 with each of the primary outcomes (mother’s BMI and adiposity 
measures: waist circumference, and triceps and subscapular skinfolds) and secondary outcomes ( child health 
behaviors: nutrition and physical activity, mother’s health behaviors: nutrition and physical activity, and 
mother’s self -efficacy: nutrition and physical activity).  
 
Aim 3:   To identify the mediators through which the intervention influences weight management in mother -child 
dyads , the ap proach  of Shrout and Bolger [40] will be employed. This method, based on bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] , builds 
on establis hed mediation test ing procedures, such as the Baron and Kenny approach [43] and the Sobel test 
[44]. Mediation analyses test pathways by  [CONTACT_48152] (X) is theorized to influence the 

Healthy Mothers -Healthy Children   Version 2  
Protocol   2019 -06-19 
 
NIH Behavioral and Social Intervention Clinical Trial Protocol Template v3.0 - 20180827  
  29 mediator (M), whic h in turn influences the outcome (Y). Models will be conceptualized for each measure of 
weight and adiposity  for mothers identified in Aim 1 ( Y) and for  each proposed mediator (M), relative to the 
randomized intervention group (X). For each model, an effec t ratio  (defined as the ratio of the indirect effect to 
the total effect, yielding the proportion of the effect that is mediated)  and its bootstrapped distribution will be 
computed to assess the strength of mediation. Mediators (M) to be tested are improvements in health 
behaviors and self -efficacy. For example, we will analyze the effect of the intervention on change in maternal 
self-efficacy from baseline to Time 2, and, in turn the effects of this change in maternal s elf-efficacy at Time 2 
on change in maternal BMI at Time 3.  
 
Sensitivity analyses for Aims 1 -3. Site will be included in all the models, and we will look for evidence of 
differential effects across cohort or site. The primary analyses use all available da ta, but if there is evidence of 
differential missingness by [CONTACT_1570], we will use imputation methods as a sensitivity analysis.  
 
Aim 4:  We will calculate the incremental cost -effectiveness of the intervention, carried out from society’s 
perspective  as:  
j ij i
ijE EC CCE−−=
 
Where C is cost over the time period of the study; E is effectiveness measured by [CONTACT_48153] s; i refers to the 
intervention and j refers to the control group.   We will calculate cost -effectiveness for the pr incipal outcomes of  
the study; including cost per unit of BMI reduction, and cost per un it of improvement on the nutrition and 
physical activity self -efficacy scales. We will carefully track and calculate the costs of the program intervention 
activities and the control group  activities, in order to measure the differences between the costs in the two 
groups. These costs will include hiring interventionists for all aspects of the Healthy Mothers -Healthy  
Children intervention. We will track the time invested in the program by [CONTACT_48154] (opportunity cost) relative to the mothers’ average income.  
 
Exploratory Aim: Analyses will be  performed on weight status, adiposity, health behavior, and self -efficacy to 
explore whether the intervention effects for mothers are similar for  those who are overweight (BMI 25-
29.9kg/m2) and those who are obese ( BMI >30 kg/m2). The mixed models describ ed for Aims 1 and 2 will be 
implemented for each of the weight status, adiposity, health behavior, and self -efficacy variables, with the 
addition of four explanatory variables to each model: an indicator for the obese group , the interaction between 
this indicator and the indicator variable for group membership, the interaction bet ween this indicator and time, 
and the three -way interaction among the group indicator, obese indicator, and time. The hypothesis test for the 
three -way in teraction as well a s the obesity indicator by [CONTACT_48155]. For each outcome, differences 
will be calculated to test the effects of the intervention versus c ontrol group at each follow -up point separately 
for each BMI range. Similar analyses will be performed with groupi[INVESTIGATOR_48115] 25th-84.9th percentile 
(normal  weight ), 85th-94.9th percentile (overweight) and >95th percentile (obese).

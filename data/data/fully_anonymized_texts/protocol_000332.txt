test at a 0.10 significance level.  
 
  
SCCC -[ZIP_CODE]: STU 122017 -043 and protocol version #  [ADDRESS_321117] common non -cutaneous head and neck malignancy 
affecting an estimated 13,430 patients in 2016 in the [LOCATION_002]. [1] Over 75% of la ryngeal 
cancers involve the true vocal cords or the glottic larynx, with over 90% of these cancers detected 
at early -stages (defined as carcinoma in situ  and cT1 -T2 tumors) when they are potentially 
curable using a single -modality.  Local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_263986] -stage glottic 
larynx cancer, as rates of nodal involvement and metastatic disease are less than 5%. [2-4] 
Treatment outcomes with radiation or surgical approaches for early -stage glottic cancer yield 
local control rates for Tis and T1 tumors typi[INVESTIGATOR_37497] 90%, and for T2 tumors 70 -80%, 
with ultimate local control rates exceeding 90% after surgical sa lvage. [2, 5]  
 
Treatment Options  
 
 There are multiple voice -preserving local treatment options for early -stage glottic 
laryngeal cancer in the current NCCN guidelines. [6] These include conventional or minimally 
hypofractionate d radiation therapy, transoral oral laser microsurgery (TLM) or open CO2 laser 
surgery, and hemilaryngectomy.  Radiation therapy delivered in a small dose per fraction to the 
glottic larynx remains a common treatment for Stage Tis, T1, and T2 glottic tumor s. Among 2338 
patients treated with T1 glottic cancers in the Linked SEER -Medicare data files from 1991 -2009, 
47% were treated with radiation alone, 39% with local surgery and radiation, and 14% with local 
surgery alone. [7] Treatment with r adiation therapy is typi[INVESTIGATOR_85514] 2 to 2.25 Gy daily 
fractions over 5.5 -7 weeks. [8, 9]  Endoscopic surgery via CO2 laser ex cision involves the removal 
of the gross tumor with a [ADDRESS_321118] while 
achieving reasonable voice outcomes. [10] Hemilaryngectomy is another surgical v oice 
preservation option particularly for selected Stage T2 lesions where the involved vocal cord and 
paraglottic space are removed, with additional resection of the ipsilateral arytenoid and/or anterior 
commissure if involved. [10, 11]  
 
Radiation Therapy Technique  
 
 Classically, early glottic larynx cancers were treated with an opposed lateral technique, 
were [ADDRESS_321119] -based planning both 3D conformal radiation 
therapy (varying radiation fields to offer  a more conformal dose distribution) and intensity 
modulated radiation therapy (IMRT; inverse radiation planning designed to limit the dose to 
specific organs while maximizing dose to a target), radiation treatment for early glottic larynx 
cancers has beco me more complex.  
 
Carotid Sparing Radiation Therapy  
 
 Treatment using opposed lateral technique often includes both carotid arteries in the 
field, delivering a high dose to a ~[ADDRESS_321120] suggested an increase in late risk of ischemic events following radiation therapy of 
head and neck cancers. [12, 13]  Because of the concern of unnecessary and potentially avoidable 
radiation therapy to the carotid arteries, dosimetric studies of early glottic larynx cancer began to 
emerge which demonstrating  a significantly reduced radiation dose to the carotids with 3D 
conformal radiation planning and further dose reduction to the carotid arteries with IMRT. [14-17] 
Following these studies, many groups have begun to report outcomes with IMRT for treatment of 
early larynx cancers and all groups, thus far, have reported local control rates of >80%. [18-20]

5  Hypofractionate d radiation therapy  
 
 Hypofractionated laryngeal irradiation initially began during World War II due to a 
shortage of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263987], the cure 
rates were similar between 5 week and 3 week treatmen t courses. [21] In a more contemporary 
radiation setting, a randomized phase III clinical trial from Japan showed promising outcomes 
with a mildly hypofractionated radiation approach of 56.25 -63 Gy in 2.25 Gy daily fractions for 
early stage glottic larynx cancer.  The trial demonstrated an improved local control, of 92% vs. 
77% at 5 years in favor of hypofractionation compared with conventional 60 -66 Gy in 2 Gy daily 
fractions; the toxicity outcomes were similar with both approaches. [9] As a result of this trial, 63 
(T1)-65.25 (T2) Gy in 28 -29 fractions is one of the two recommended radiation regimens for early 
glottis cancer in the U.S. [22] These trials support the feasibility of moderate hypofractionation in 
the current clinical landscape. Extreme hypofractionation remains a possibility to improve both 
patient convenience and treatment cost.  
 In fact, we have completed a phase I dose -escalation trial of larynx stereotactic body 
radiotherapy (SBRT), and the results will be detailed throughout this discussion.  
 
1.2 Study Agent(s)/Therapy(ies) Background and Associated Known Toxicities  
 
Radiotherapy is well established and a recommended treatment for treatment of early 
glottic larynx cancer by [CONTACT_94497]. Additionally, a few separate groups have reported outcomes 
with hypofractionated radiation regimens with minimal late grade 3 or greater toxicities.

machine.  
 
A few considerations are necessary when considering treatment with highly focal 
radiotherapy, with or without extreme hypofractionation:  
 
 Does focal treatment of the glottic larynx reduce dose to surrounding organs 
while offering similar rates of local control rates compared with treatment of the 
entire larynx?  
 Can hypofractionated radiation therapy be delivered with acceptable acute and 
late toxicities?  
 What treatment dose and fractionation is appropriate for the phas e II portion of 
this trial?  
 What radiation modality is the best option for delivery of dose -escalated, focal 
glottic larynx cancer?  
 
Local control and organ sparing with a highly focal treatment  
 
 Based on data supporting focal IMRT technique for limiting radiation dose to the carotid 
arteries, a few academic groups have investigated a more focal radiation field by [CONTACT_264014], rather than unnecessarily radiating the entire larynx in every 
case. This highly -focuse d radiation therapy offers potential advantages, in both the ability to limit 
radiation dose to the uninvolved vocal cord, arytenoids, laryngeal cartilages, pharynx, spi[INVESTIGATOR_263988], while allowing for dose -escalated radiation therapy to t he disease itself.  
 
 A group from the Erasmus medical center recently published a report where they treated 
[ADDRESS_321124] scans for setup. [23] The clinical target volume (CTV) 
included the entire cord from a 1mm axial -sliced planning scan, as well as the maximal intensity 
projection from a 4D respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] -gated CT scan. For tumors involving the anterior commissure 
(AC), the entire AC was i ncluded in the CTV. From the CTV, the group expanded 3mm 
circumferentially and 5mm superior -inferior for all but the initial 4 patients. With the reduced 
treatment volumes, they employed a higher dose per fraction at 3.63 Gy x 16 fractions and 
reported 100 % local control at 2 years with no grade 3 or greater late toxicities. There was only 1 
case of laryngeal edema in an actively smoking patient, and it fully resolved with steroids. 
Importantly, 78% of patients on this study were characterized as smoking. I n addition, the median 
planning target volume (PTV) size was 10.[ADDRESS_321125] 2 dose levels (Figure 1) while substantially limiting the radiation dose 
delivered to nearby [CONTACT_250011] (Table 1). The [ADDRESS_321126] dose arm (4 2.5 Gy 
in 5 fractions) have not experienced any local failures thus far.

 From the phase I portion of our study , there have been only 3 cases of grade 2 or 
greater soft tissue necrosis. Because of these small numbers, statistical comparisons are not 
informative. The three cases are briefly summarized below:  
 
 Active smoking male with a large volume irradiated (17 cc) on dose level 2 (45 Gy in 10 
fractions), required a tracheostomy and gastrostomy due to necrosis 5 months after 
treatment. He subsequently experienced  a local failure.

STU122017 -043, Sher, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_29, 02 -07-22   
8  Active smoking male with a large volume irradiated (21.3 cc) on dose level 3 (42.5 Gy in 
5 fractions). He required a feeding tube and had profound dysphonia [ADDRESS_321130] foods and communicate over the phone.  
 
 Non-smoking male with a relatively small volume irradiated (4.9 cc) on dose level 3 (42.5 
Gy in 5 fractions). He spent [ADDRESS_321131] 
completely recovered with conservative measures.  
 
In summary, 2 of 7 patients with large volume PTVs (10 cc or higher) developed  
symptomatic necrosis, and 2 of 6 active smokers developed symptomatic necrosis. Of note, 5 
additional patients quit within 1 month of starting radiotherapy, and none developed a 
complication.  
 
 From a voice quality perspective, the Voice Handicap Index results were excellent, such 
that only two patients (out of 30) experienced a worsening of their VHI score. In both cases, the 
ipsilateral arytenoid dose was 31% higher than the prescription dose in the first cohort. Although 
these numbers are very small, we are extrapolating this result to minimize the arytenoid d ose in 
the future and keep it within 102% of the prescription dose.  
 
Radiation Dose and Fractionation for the current study  
 
 The goal of treatment with radiation therapy is to deliver as high of a dose as possible to 
the target (tumor), while minimizing the dose to the normal tissues where late -side effects can 
drastically affect patient quality of life. Radiation dose delivered  in the tissues can be accurately 
calculated using a universal survival curve (USC), which includes both the linear quadratic model 
and the multitarget model. To estimate the tumoricidal dose and late -toxicity dose delivered by 
[CONTACT_264015], a biologically effective dose (BED) is typi[INVESTIGATOR_263989] 
[28].

 Given that patients with a larger PTV and active smoking history were at greater risk for 
toxicity (albeit encompassing only 3 patients in total) in our study , we have the refore decided to 
treat this population with the Dutch regimen. In particular, patients with:  
 
 PTV greater than or equal to 10 cc  
 Smoking within 1 month of registration  
 
will be treated with daily SBRT at a dose of 58.08 Gy in 16 fractions. Because patient s with small 
tumors from the phase I portion of the trial had minimal toxicity with treatment, we propose to 
continue the dose of 42.5 Gy in 5 fractions for tumors less than 10 cc.  
 
Radiation Therapy Delivery  
 
 There are a number of different techniques u sed to deliver highly -focal, inverse planned 
radiation therapy. The Erasmus group used a static -field IMRT approach. [23] Static -field IMRT is 
a commonly used approach where the beam angles are pre -chosen and then the radiation 
delivery is inversely plan ned by [CONTACT_264016]. The downside of static -field IMRT is that [ADDRESS_321132] (CBCT) scan, the Cyberknife uses orthogonal 
x-rays to verify target position. Because the larynx isn’t clearly visible using orthogonal x -rays, it 
must be tracked using fiducial markers. Fiducial markers placed either on the skin or 
subcutaneously outside of the larynx might not accurately represent where the larynx is located, 
especially if the patient has substantial external neck motion (i.e. substantial neck motion when 
breath ing). The second limitation of using Cyberknife technology is the prolonged treatment time 
compared with other techniques. In the phase I portion of our study, the median treatment time on 
the Cyberknife was [ADDRESS_321133] treatment mask, provided there are suitable alternatives available, and 
it allows for more time where a mobile structure like the larynx can move out of the tracked 
treatment field (i.e. with swallowing).  
 
 A third option for treating a focal larynx cancer is with the use of volumetric modulated arc 
therapy (VMAT), which is essentially an IMRT treatment delivered from nearly 360 degrees 
around the patient. This allows for many more beam angles than static fiel d IMRT and it also 
allows for a much quicker treatment. One group recently compared 2 -arc VMAT with a typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 8 -
field IMRT plan for early stage larynx cancer and reported that both target volume coverage and 
homogeneity were comparable between VMAT and IMR T, while VMAT was superior for carotid -
artery sparing. Additionally, VMAT delivery time was significantly faster than with IMRT (3 -5 
minutes vs. 5 -10 minutes). [29] Another study supports the substantially reduced treatment time 
with arc therapy vs. IMRT. [30] Because of the promising results with VMAT treatment delivery, 
either modality (i.e. CyberKnife or VMAT) is acceptable for treatment on this protocol.

 Summary points  
 
1. Local control rates using a highly focal radiation target appear to be as good as 
conventional radiation therapy (≥80%)  
 
2. Highly focal radiation therapy targeting only the involved site  of disease plus a small 
margin delivers an extremely low dose of radiation dose nearby [CONTACT_264017] I studies.  
 
3. A reduced dose to nearby [CONTACT_264018], such as esophagitis 
and stroke from carotid atherosclerosis and could reduce the decline in voice function 
from contralateral cord dose. However, long -term follow -up of voice quality of life 
following focal larynx radiation therapy is not yet available from the phase I portio n of 
this trial.  
 
4. Hypofractionated radiation therapy appears to be safe, although there were three 
cases of soft tissue necrosis in the phase I trial. Current smoking status and larger 
PTV volume (> 10cc) all had qualitatively higher rates of necrosis.  
 
5. Based on the phase I study, we propose using a dose of 42.5 Gy in 5 fractions for 
low-risk tumors: tumors with a PTV < 10cc, no recent smoking, and disease limited to 
the vocal process. This provides both an adequate tumoricidal dose, and a limited 
dose to n ormal tissues. Remaining patients will be irradiated using the Dutch [ADDRESS_321134] imaging 
during treatment, to determine the optimal patient -specific PTV margin.

All subjects experiencing an adverse event, regardless  of its relationship to study 
therapy, will be monitored until:  
 the adverse event resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute the adverse 
event return to baseline;  
 there is a satisfactory explanation other than the study therapy for the changes 
observed; or  
 death.

human research study participant, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal 
physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, clinical eve nt, or disease, temporally  
associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not it is considered 
related to the subject’s participation in the research.   
Adverse events encompass clinical, physical and psychological harms. Adverse e vents 
occur most commonly in the context of biomedical research, although on occasion, they 
can occur in the context of social and behavioral research. Adverse events may be 
expected or unexpected.  
Acute Adverse Events  
Adverse events occurring in the time  period from the start of treatment, through [ADDRESS_321170] specialty 
categories relevant to study endpoints: radiation oncology, medical oncology, and 
otolaryngology. The queried encoun ters will be limited in scope based on categorization of 
events; namely, encounters that related to any head and neck or gastrointestinal event or 
problem.  
Severity  
Adverse events will be graded by a numerical score according to the defined NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) and version number 
specified in the protocol. Adverse events not specifically defined in the NCI CTCAE will 
be scored  on the Adverse Event log according to the general guidelines provided by [CONTACT_264021].   
 Grade 1: Mild  
 Grade 2: Moderate  
 Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening  
 Grade 4: Life threatening conseq uences  
 Grade 5: Death related to the adverse event  
 
Serious Adverse Events  
OHRP and UTSW HRPP  define serious adverse events as those events, occurring at 
any dose, which meets any of the following criteria:  
 results in death;  
 is life -threatening (places t he subject at immediate risk of death from the event as 
it occurred);  
 results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]1,2 or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
 results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
 results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or

22  based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Note: A “Serious adverse event” is by [CONTACT_264022]. Serious adverse events may or may not be related to the research project. A 
serious adverse event determination does not require the event to be related to the 
research. That is, both events completely unrelated to  the condition under study and 
events that are expected in the context of the condition under study may be serious 
adverse events, independent of relatedness to the study itself. As examples, a car 
accident requiring >24 hour inpatient admission to the hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_263996] a serious 
adverse event for any research participant; likewise, in a study investigating end -stage 
cancer care, any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263997] -specified 
period of monitoring for adverse and serious adverse even ts would be a serious adverse 
event, even if the event observed is a primary clinical endpoint of the study.  
1Pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114579]. Note: If 
events occur during a pre -planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263998], those events should be evaluated and/or reported as SAEs.

For example: a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114582] a patient is adm itted for observation or minor 
treatment (e.g. hydration) and released in less than 24 hours. Furthermore, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_264001] a routine AE or in an expedited report.  
7.2.2  Unant icipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]):  
The phrase “unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others” is found, but not 
defined in the HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46, and the FDA regulations at 21 CFR 
56.108(b)(1) and [ADDRESS_321171], which is defined in 21 CFR 812.3(s). Guidance from 
the regulatory agencies considers unanticipated problems to include any incident, 
experience, or outcome that m eets ALL three (3) of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity or frequency given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research 
protocol and informed consent docum ent; and (b) the characteristics of the subject 
population being studied;  
    AND  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there 
is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_3459]);  
 AND  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized. Note: According to OHRP, if the adverse event is serious, it would always 
suggest a greater risk of harm.

STU122017 -043, Sher, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_29, 02 -07-22   
23 All adverse events will be followed up according to good medical practices.  
 
7.3 Steps to Determine If a Serious Adverse Event Requires Expedited Reporting to the 
SCCC DSMC  
Step 1 : Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE v 4).  
 
Step 2 : Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v 4. 
 
Step 3 : Determine whether the adverse event is related  to the protocol therapy.  
Attribution categories are as follows:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE may NOT be  related  to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
Note : This includes all events that occur within the acute adverse events reporting period 
as defined in section 7.2.1. Any event  that occurs during the late adverse event period as 
defined in section 7.2.1 and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the treatment 
must also be reported accordingly.  
 
Step 4 : Determine the prior experience of the adverse event.  
Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent. An adverse event is considered unexpected, for expedited 
reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not 
listed in: 
 the current known adverse events listed in the Agent Information Section of this 
protocol (if applicable);  
 the drug package insert (if applicable);  
 the current Investigator’s Brochure (if applicable)  
 the Study Agent(s)/Therapy(ies) Background and Associated Known Toxicities 
section of this protocol

10.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
 
The general perception in the radiotherapy co mmunity is that radiotherapy for early stage 
glottic larynx  cancer leads to a local control probability of approximately 95%.  Given 
there are some T2 patients on the study (bigger tumors), we use the 2 -year local control 
rate of 90% rather than 95% with t he non -inferiority margin of 15%. The hazard rates for 
2-year local control probabilities of 90% and 75% are 0.0527 and 0.1438, respectively. 
With a sample size of 25 patients, this study has more than 80% power to detect a non -
inferiority against an upper  hazard ratio bound of 2.73 (=0.1438/0.0527) using a log -rank 
test at a significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_321175] rate is 0.0527. Patients will be accrued for a period of 3 years with 2 -year 
follow -up. Thi s assumes that a local control outcome inferior to 75% would obviate the 
potential benefit of highly focal radiation treatment.  
 
Our prior phase I study included a nearly identical patient population and took just over 3 
years to complete; however, this pr otocol has [ADDRESS_321176] the present proposal to be 
completed in 2.5 to 3 years.

It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance 
with federally mandated regulations. The IRB must approve the consent form and 
protocol.  
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the 
applicable regulatory requirement(s),  and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
  
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the subject will be given a full 
explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. 
Each consent form must include all the relevant ele ments currently required by [CONTACT_10000]. Once this essential information has been 
provided to the subject and the investigator is assured that the subject understands the 
implications of participating in the study, th e subject will be asked to give consent to 
participate in the study by [CONTACT_10001] -approved consent form.  
 
Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be 
signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_264028].  
 
For patients with cognitive impairment or other limited decision making capacity, the 
subject and/or their LAR will be given a full explanation of the study and will be given the 
opportunity to review the consent form. Consent form may be signed by [CONTACT_264029]/or legal guardian if investigator determines that subject is willingly able to sign and 
complete proto col specific procedures for the duration of the study.  Safeguards and/or 
precautions that will be taken to minimize risks/harms during the conduct of the study for 
individuals with cognitive impairment or other limited decision making capacity include, 
but is not limited to:  
 Extra time to review to the ICF (e.g. phone call over the phone with the patient or 
LAR, then present ICF and give days to weeks for full consideration of all 
benefits and risks)

treating research physician and the patient’s primary caregiver, to discuss the 
protocol treatment and discuss the trial’s impact to the patient’s ongoing care. 
This will require a signed medical release waiver  
 Discuss the option of h aving a social worker involved as needed not only for the 
patient and LAR to receive resources as needed, but also to advise the research 
team of any potential risks/harms to the patient due to the patient’s impairment 
and its progression

We will use this system in the future event of collaboration with other departments.  
 
New subjects will receive a secondary number beginning with [ADDRESS_321179] should be numbered usin g the schema provided above. 
Upon registration, the registrar will assign the additional registration/randomization code 
according to the numbering schema outlined above, which should then be entered as the 
patient study id in Velos upon updating the statu s to enrolled.  
 
The numbering schema should clearly identify the site number; the sequential number of 
the subject enrolled as well as the status of the subjects enrolled so that the number of 
subjects consented versus the number of subjects actually enrol led may be easily 
identified.  
11.5 Data Management and Monitoring/Auditing  
 
REDCap is the UTSW SCCC institutional choice for the electronic data capture of case 
report forms for this and all SCCC Investigator Initiated Trials. REDCap will be used for 
SCCC -[ZIP_CODE]: STU 122017 -043 and protocol version #  [ADDRESS_321180].  
 
Trial monitoring will be conducted no less than annually and refers to the review of trial 
related activity and documentation performe d by [CONTACT_114650], which includes but is not 
limited to accuracy of case report forms, protocol compliance, timeliness and accuracy of 
Velos entries and AE/SAE management and reporting. Documentation of trial monitoring 
will be maintained along with other proto col related documents and will be reviewed 
during internal audit.  
 
Toxicity reviews will be performed at the end of study. These reviews will be documented 
by [CONTACT_76846]/or the UTSW Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC) 
Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).   
 
 
The UTSW Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC) Data Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) is responsible for monitoring data quality and patient safety for all 
UTSW SCCC clinical trials.  As part of that responsibility, the DSMC rev iews all serious 
adverse events and UPI[INVESTIGATOR_264011] a quarterly basis.  The quality assurance activity for the Clinical Research 
Office provides for periodic auditing of clinical research documents to  ensure data 
integrity and regulatory compliance.  A copy of the DSMC plan is available upon request.  
 
The SCCC DSMC meets quarterly and conducts annual comprehensive reviews of 
ongoing clinical trials, for which it serves as the DSMC of record. The Qualit y Assurance 
Coordinator ( QAC ) works as part of the DSMC to conduct regular audits based on the 
level of risk. Audit findings are reviewed at the next available DSMC meeting.  In this 
way, frequency of DSMC monitoring is dependent upon the level of risk.  R isk level is 
determined by [CONTACT_264031] a number of factors such as the phase of the 
study; the type of investigational agent, device or intervention being studied; and 
monitoring required to ensure the safety of study subjects based on the associ ated risks 
of the study. Protocol -specific DSMC plans must be consistent with these principles.  
11.[ADDRESS_321181] requires alternative treatment, the study shall be 
conducted exactly as described in the approved protocol.  
11.6.1  Exceptions (also called sing le-subject exceptions or single -subject waivers): 
include any departure from IRB -approved research that is not due to an 
emergency  and is:  
 intentional on part of the investigator; or  
 in the investigator’s control; or  
 not intended as a systemic change (e.g. , single -subject exceptions to eligibility  
[inclusion/exclusion] criteria)  
 Reporting requirement : Exceptions are non -emergency deviations that require prospective  
IRB approval before being implemented. Call the IRB if your request is 
urgent. If IRB approval is not obtained beforehand, this constitutes a major 
deviation.  For eligibility waivers, studies which utilize the SCCC -DSMC as the 
DSMC of record must also obt ain approval from the DSMC prior to submitting 
to IRB for approval.

31 11.6.2  Emergency Deviations: include any departure from IRB -approved research that 
is necessary to:  
 avoid immediate apparent harm, or  
 protect the life or physical well -being of subjects or others  
 Reporting requirement : Emergency deviations must be promptly reported  
to the IRB within 5 working days of occurrence.  
11.6.3  Serious Noncompliance  (formerly called major deviations or violations ): 
include any departure from IRB -approved research that:  
 Increase risk of harm to subject; and/or  
 Adversely affects the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects (any of which may 
also be an unanticipated problem); and/or  
 adversely affects the integrity of the data and research (i.e., substantially 
compromises the  integrity, reliability, or validity of the research)  
 Reporting requirement : Serious Noncompliance  must be promptly 
reported to  the IRB within 5 working days of discovery . 
11.6.4  Continuing Noncompliance : includes a pattern of rep eated noncompliance (in 
1 or more protocols simultaneously, or over a period of time ) which continues 
after  initial discovery, including inadequate efforts to take or implement corrective 
or prevent ative action within a reasonable time frame.   
 Reporting requirement* : Continuing Nonc ompliance must be promptly 
reported to the IRB within 5 working days of discovery.  
 
11.6.5    Noncompliance  (that is neither serious nor continuing; formerly called 
minor deviations) any departure from IRB -approved research that:  
 Does not meet the definition of serious noncompliance or continuing 
noncompliance  
 Reporting requirement* : Noncompliance that is  neither serious nor 
continuing  should be tracked and summarized the next IRB continuing review, 
or the notice of study closure - whichever comes first.  
 
*Reporting Requirements reflect UTSW HRPP/IRB guidelines; participating sites should follow 
the reporting guidelines for their IRB of record

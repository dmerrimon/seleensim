Name [CONTACT_7481]: _________________________________________________________ Age: ___________ 
 
The following is given to you to tell you about this research study.  Please read this form with care and ask any 
questions you may have about this study.  Your questions will be answered.  Also, you will be given a copy of this 
consent form.   
 
You do not have to be in this research study. You can stop being in this study at any time.  If we learn something new that 
may affect the risks or benefits of this study, you will be told so that you can decide whether or not you still want to be in this 
study.    
     
1. What is the purpose of this study?  
 
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you are experiencing chronic low back pain. Use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_238652] (commonly referred to as “pain medications”) for treating chronic pain has increased dramatically, but so has the 
controversy regarding their side effects and potential for abuse when used for long periods. The effectiveness of opi[INVESTIGATOR_786163], such as morphine and hydrocodone, can vary widely between individuals.  Our previous research indicates 
that one factor influencing responses to pain medications is the body’s level of natural opi[INVESTIGATOR_268367] (often referred to as 
“endorphins”).  The overall purpose of this research study is to determine whether aerobic exercise training decreases 
chronic back pain intensity by [CONTACT_786179][INVESTIGATOR_268367], and whether these changes in turn reduce the 
amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_786164].  A total of 100 chronic low back pain 
patients will participate in this study at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.   
 
2. What will happen and how long will you be in the study? 
 
All procedures described below will be for research purposes only. 
 
You will only be allowed into the study if you are not taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_786165] a daily basis (for example, Morphine, 
Oxycontin, Tylenol #3, Vicodin, Ultram, etc.). This is because individuals who take opi[INVESTIGATOR_786166]-prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_158263] (including heroin) may experience side effects (such as 
sweating and nausea) when the study medication, naloxone, is administered. Naloxone is an FDA-approved opi[INVESTIGATOR_786167]. In this study Naloxone is being given for research purposes only; this use of naloxone is considered 
investigational and not FDA-approved. You will receive naloxone during two laboratory sessions while participating in this 
study.  Naloxone should have no noticeable side effects if you do not have a recent history of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561], and are 
not taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_786168] a daily basis. The other study drug, morphine, is an FDA-approved opi[INVESTIGATOR_22388]. 
It can produce side effects including sedation, somnolence (sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]), nausea, brief vomiting, euphoria (feeling good) , 
and s lowing of your breathing rate. The dose used in this study will be based on your weight and represents a relatively low 
dose which should help limit any negative side effects.  If you take opi[INVESTIGATOR_786169]-needed basis, you will 
be asked not to take any of these medications for 3 days before each laboratory session, in order to avoid altering your 
sensitivity to the experimental procedures used in the study (described below). You will also be asked not to take opi[INVESTIGATOR_786170] [ADDRESS_1081277] be asked to attend a baseline screening session during which you will undergo a screening to confirm that you 
are eligible to participate in the study, and complete several questionnaires. This will involve providing information on your

All procedures described below will be for research purposes only. 
 
You will only be allowed into the study if you are not taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_786165] a daily basis (for example, Morphine,

2 of 9 pain condition, your medical history, medications you are taking, and a brief examination to document the nature of any 
chronic pain. You will also be asked to complete several questionnaires asking about general information (for example, age, 
gender, etc.), your activity and exercise levels, your chronic pain and how it affects your life, and psychological factors that 
can affect pain and responses to pain medications.  These psychological factors include anger-related factors, depression, 
anxiety, and how you cope mentally with pain. Information obtained from these questionnaires will be used to help interpret 
the laboratory results of this study, and for guiding future related studies. You will only be asked to complete these 
questionnaires during the initial baseline screening session. At the end of your baseline screening session, you will be given 
a personal digital assistant (PDA) containing an electronic pain diary.  You will be asked to complete this brief electronic 
pain diary twice per day (at 9am and 6pm) for [ADDRESS_1081281] tell the study doctor or nurse about all the 
medications you are taking before you start the study and before taking any non-study medications while you are in the 
study.    
 
Next, you will be asked to attend a series of 3 study sessions scheduled over an approximately 10 day period at the same 
time of day, during which you will receive naloxone, morphine , or placebo [an inactive substance]). A ll laboratory sessions 
will each last about 3.5 hours (or less). All laboratory procedures will be conducted while you are seated upright in a 
comfortable chair. Nursing staff (supervised by [CONTACT_15490]) will be present during all procedures, and emergency 
medical supplies will be available on site. You will be asked about recent medication use, and if necessary, will be 
rescheduled.  All study drugs will be administered by a trained clinical research center staff nurse under physician 
supervision. You will receive placebo during one of the sessions, naloxone (a temporary blocker of your body’s natural 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]) during one of the sessions, and morphine (an opi[INVESTIGATOR_786171]) during one of the 
sessions. You will have an equal likelihood of receiving the placebo, the naloxone, or the morphine first, with the order of 
medications determined using a procedure similar to flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin. Both you and the research nurse will be unaware of the 
specific medication you have been assigned on each visit, although this information will be available if necessary. Because 
of the side effects of morphine and because we do not know which study session you will be assigned to receive morphine, 
you will need to arrange for someone to drive you home from all three study sessions and refrain from driving for 
at least [ADDRESS_1081282]. Then a venous cannula (similar to an i.v. like 
you might get in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) will be placed in your nondominant arm by [CONTACT_54340]. In the first and fourth sessions 
only, a 4ml blood sample (about 1 teaspoon) will then be obtained from this cannula to assess levels of natural 
cannabinoids (chemicals produced naturally by [CONTACT_786180]) that may 
impact on pain and medication responses.   Following blood sampling, you will complete a questionnaire to describe your 
current low back pain intensity.  You will then receive 4 infusions of the medication that has been assigned for that 
laboratory session, each approximately 20 minutes apart .  During the session in which you receive morphine, you will 
r
eceive small doses of morphine in all 4 infusions.  During the naloxone session, you will receive naloxone during 2 of the 4 
infusions.  In the placebo session, you will receive placebo in all 4 infusions.   
 
Ten minutes after each dose of medication is received (to allow peak drug activity to be achieved) , you will be asked to 
complete a brief questionnaire to describe your chronic back pain intensity. Then, you will undergo a thermal pain task to 
assess heat pain threshold and tolerance. This task will involve repeated brief applications of a computer-controlled heat 
stimulus to several areas of your non-dominant forearm. The equipment used in this task is safe and only produces heat at 
[ADDRESS_1081283] becomes painful (your heat 
pain threshold), and three brief trials during which you will be asked to indicate when your heat pain tolerance has been 
reached. For each trial, as soon as your tolerance is reached, the equipment will rapi[INVESTIGATOR_786172], ending the pain stimulus. Immediately upon completion of the final heat pain tolerance trial, you will be asked 
to rate the quality and intensity of the pain you experienced, as well as any drug-related side effects.  These same thermal 
pain task procedures will be repeated after all 4 of the drug infusions.

[ADDRESS_1081285] three laboratory sessions, you will next be randomly assigned (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin) to either the 6-
week aerobic exercise training group or the no-intervention control group.  You will have an equal chance of being assigned 
to either group.  If you are assigned to the no-intervention control group, you will be asked to maintain the same activity 
level throughout your study participation that you maintained prior to beginning the study.  After completing your study 
participation, you may engage in any additional exercise activities if you choose to.  You will also complete a brief (less than 
15 minutes) assessment regarding your pain, function, and emotional state over the phone on a weekly basis.  If you are 
assigned to the aerobic exercise training intervention, you will be asked to participate in 3 aerobic exercise sessions 
supervised by a certified personal trainer per week for 6 weeks (18 sessions total).  Exercise in these sessions will be of 
progressively increasing intensity over the [ADDRESS_1081286] your preferred form of aerobic exercise from the following options: treadmill 
walking/running, stair steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the elliptical machine, or stationary cycling. Your back pain, heart rate, and perceived level 
of exertion will be monitored by [CONTACT_786181], with activities adjusted during 
each session to help you increase your level of aerobic conditioning while minimizing any exacerbations of back pain.  Each 
week during this exercise intervention period, you will also be asked to complete a brief (less than 15 minutes) assessment 
regarding your pain, function, and emotional state over the phone.   
 
After the intervention period, regardless of which group you are assigned to, you will be asked to  return for [ADDRESS_1081287]-treatment follow-up assessment, you will again be 
asked to complete a 5-day electronic diary monitoring period using procedures identical to those described above.   
 
Giving samples for genetic research is your free choice and you may be in the study even if you do not want your samples 
used or stored for genetic research. There will be a separate section at the end of this form where you can indicate whether 
or not you would like to participate in this genetic part of the study.  
 
Your participation in the study will end after the sixth laboratory visit. 
  
 
3. Costs to you if you take part in this study: 
 
There is no cost to you for taking part in this study. All procedures described above are solely for the research  
purposes of this study. However, you are still responsible for paying for the usual care you would normally receive  
for the treatment of your illness. This includes treatments and tests you would need even if you were not in this  
study. These costs will be billed to you and/or your insurance.  
 
 
4. Side effects and risks that you can expect if you take part in this study:  
 
You may find completing questionnaires regarding your pain and psychological state to be mildly distressing. This level of 
distress is likely to be similar to what would occur if you were discussing these issues with your physician or a family 
member.   
 
You may find certain aspects of the evaluation of your pain-related symptoms to be mildly uncomfortable .   
 
You will experience brief, moderate intensity acute pain upon application of the thermal pain stimuli that will be used for 
assessment of your natural pain control systems and your responses to morphine. However, you have total control over the 
duration of your exposure to these pain stimuli because you stop each task by [CONTACT_786182]: 11/06/2018

Study Title:  Reduced Opi[INVESTIGATOR_786162]/Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: Vanderbilt University School of Medicine  
 
[ADDRESS_1081289] is expected to be minimal.   
 
You will experience very brief, mild pain upon insertion of a cannula (for study drug administration) during each study 
session. This event is similar to what you have likely experienced at some point during medical treatment when bloo d 
samples were drawn, or if you have ever received an IV while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. Insertion will be performed by a trained nurse or 
physician to minimize discomfort associated with insertion of the cannula. There is a risk of infection and local inflammatio n 
at the site of cannula insertion. Precautions will be taken to insure that such risks are minimized.   
 
The following risks relate to the medications to be used in the study. The medication used for opi[INVESTIGATOR_188261], naloxone, 
has been used clinically for decades for treatment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_786173]. It is not an 
experimental or new drug, and is FDA-approved for those purposes. Previous studies indicate that it is safe for individuals 
who are not opi[INVESTIGATOR_252190], do not have liver disease, and do not have cardiovascular problems. Potential subjects 
experiencing these types of problems will be excluded from this study to insure a maximal level of safety with drug 
administration. Individuals taking daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], even if not dependent, will also be excluded from the study to avoid 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_786174]. In some individuals, naloxone may increase pain sensitivity to the acute pain 
tasks somewhat, but again, you may terminate these tasks if you reach your tolerance limit. Based on previous studies, 
naloxone is expected to have limited if any direct effects on your back pain intensity, and therefore, there appears to be little 
risk of exacerbating your chronic pain condition. Even if such changes do occur, the brief half-life of naloxone (on average, 
approximately 45-60 minutes) insures that any pain exacerbation will be of short duration.  With the exception of possible 
effects on pain sensitivity, naloxone is not known to be associated with other clinically significant effects in healthy 
individuals who are not opi[INVESTIGATOR_786175].   
 
The other study drug, morphine, is an FDA-approved opi[INVESTIGATOR_786176] a very long history of use in standard clinical 
practice. It can produce dose-dependent side effects including sedation, somnolence (sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]), allergic reactions (which 
may be life threatening), itching, nausea, vomiting, euphoria (feeling good), hallucinations, vision changes, urinary retention, 
constipation, and slowing of breathing rate. The dose used in th is study will be adjusted to your weight, and the total dose 
you will receive represents a relatively low dose within the normal range of dosages used in standard clinical practice. This 
should help limit any negative side effects. The effects of morphine can last for four hours or more.  You will be kept under 
observation in each study session until all side effects remit to the point where it is safe for you to leave.  You will need to 
arrange for someone to drive you home from the appointment and refrain from driving for at least 6 hours after the study 
drug was given.  If morphine side effects are severe, these effects will be immediately reversed by [CONTACT_786183].   
 
As part of this study, you may be assigned by [CONTACT_786184] a 6-week aerobic exercise intervention as described 
above.  To maximize safety with this type of exercise, individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease are excluded from 
participating in this study.  The intensity of this aerobic exercise training will start low but progressively increase over the 6-
week intervention period .  It is possible that you may experience short-term increases or decreases in your chronic pain 
following your exercise sessions.   Safety and possible discomfort associated with these increases in exercise intensity will 
be minimized via close monitoring by a certified personal trainer of your heart rate, perceived exertion levels, and your back 
pain during exercise.  Exercise intensity will be adjusted as appropriate to maximize your level of conditioning while 
minimizing exacerbation of your back pain.  In addition, you will be able to choose your preferred form of exercise from 
several available options.

In the event new information becomes available that may affect the risks or benefits associated with this study or your 
willingness to participate in it, you will be notified so that you can make an informed decision whether or not to 
continue your participation in this study. 
 
6.   Payment in case you are injured because of this research study: 
 
If it is determined by [CONTACT_92949] a direct result of the tests or treatments that 
are done for research, then you and/or your insurance will not have to pay for the cost of immediate medical care provided 
at Vanderbilt to treat the injury.  There are no plans for Vanderbilt to pay for the costs of any additional care. There are no 
plans for Vanderbilt to give you money for the injury.  
 
7.   Good effects that might result from this study:   
 
a) The benefits to science and humankind that might result from this study are an improved understanding of endogenous 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_786177], and how these changes impact on 
responsiveness to opi[INVESTIGATOR_73409].  This study has the potential to significantly advance knowledge regarding 
mechanisms underlying individual differences in responsiveness to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], and how these mechanisms can be 
manipulated through non-drug interventions in a way that may reduce reliance upon high-dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_786178].  
   
b) If you are assigned by [CONTACT_786185], you may 
experience a decrease in the intensity of your low back pain as a result.  Any improvement might be temporary, but would 
be more likely to continue if you continue to engage in similar exercise activities.   
 
8.   Other treatments you could get if you decide not to be in this study: 
   
T
his is not a study designed to determine the effectiveness of a new treatment for back pain.  Exercise interventions like 
those used in this study are available through most physical therapy providers and personal trainers.   
 
9.   Payments for your time spent taking part in this study or expenses  
 
If you are assigned to the exercise condition, you will be compensated for your time with $75 for the baseline screening 
session and electronic diary monitoring period, $100 for each completed laboratory session (6 sessions if you complete the 
full protocol), $30 for each completed exercise session (up to 18 sessions), $30 each week for completing phone follow- up 
questionnaires, and $75 for the follow-up electronic diary monitoring period, all paid by [CONTACT_786186].  If you are assigned to the control condition, you will be compensated for 
your time with $75 for the baseline screening session and electronic diary monitoring period, $100 for each completed 
laboratory session (6 sessions if you complete the full protocol), $30 each week for completing phone follow- up 
questionnaires, and $75 for the follow-up electronic diary monitoring period, all paid by [CONTACT_786186].   We may ask you for your Social Security Number and address before you 
are compensated for taking part in this study.  You may receive up to $ 1,470 for taking part in this study.  This amount may 
be taxable and will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service.  Your payment cannot be processed until the PDA 
electronic diary provided to you has been returned.  If you lose this device, its’ replacement cost ($150) may be deducted 
from your final compensation.

The purpose of this study is to look at genes (DNA) and how they affect health and disease. Genes are the instruction 
manual for your body. The genes you get from your parents decide what you look like and how your body behaves. 
They can also tell us a person’s risk for certain diseases and how they will respond to treatment.   
 
You are being asked to give a blood sample for genetic research.  What we learn about you from this sample will not be 
put in your health record.  Your test results will not be shared with you or your doctor.  No one else (like a relative, boss, 
or insurance company) will be given your test results.  Your sample will only be used for research at Vanderbilt 
University and will not be sold.  Health insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic 
information that comes from this research.  
 
A single blood sample of about ½ teaspoon will be obtained through the cannula already inserted in your arm as part of 
the study for extraction of genetic samples. 
 
One risk of giving samples for this research may be the release of your name [CONTACT_691848]/or the results of the tests run on your samples. This may cause problems with insurance or getting a job.  
 
Health insurance companies and group health plans may not use your genetic information when making decisions 
regarding your eligibility or premiums. Employers with [ADDRESS_1081295] DNA that will be kept for an unknown length of time (maybe years) for future

2 of 9 pain condition, your medical history, medications you are taking, and a brief examination to document the nature of any 
chronic pain. You will also be asked to complete several questionnaires asking about general information (for example, age, gender, etc.), your activity and exercise levels, your chronic pain and how it affects your life, and psychological factors that can affect pain and responses to pain medications.  These psychological factors include anger-related factors, depression, 
anxiety, and how you cope mentally with pain. Information obtained from these questionnaires will be used to help interpret 
the laboratory results of this study, and for guiding future related studies. You will only be asked to complete these 
questionnaires during the initial baseline screening session. At the end of your baseline screening session, you will be given a personal digital assistant (PDA) containing an electronic pain diary.  You will be asked to complete this brief electronic pain diary twice per day (at 9am and 6pm) for [ADDRESS_1081299] tell the study doctor or nurse about all the medications you are taking before you start the study and before taking any non-study medications while you are in the study.    
 
Next, you will be asked to attend a series of 3 study sessions scheduled over an approximately 10 day period at the same 
time of day, during which you will receive naloxone, morphine , or placebo [an inactive substance]). A ll laboratory sessions 
will each last about 3.5 hours (or less). All laboratory procedures will be conducted while you are seated upright in a 
comfortable chair. Nursing staff (supervised by [CONTACT_15490]) will be present during all procedures, and emergency 
medical supplies will be available on site. You will be asked about recent medication use, and if necessary, will be 
rescheduled.  All study drugs will be administered by a trained clinical research center staff nurse under physician 
supervision. You will receive placebo during one of the sessions, naloxone (a temporary blocker of your body’s natural 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]) during one of the sessions, and morphine (an opi[INVESTIGATOR_786171]) during one of the 
sessions. You will have an equal likelihood of receiving the placebo, the naloxone, or the morphine first, with the order of 
medications determined using a procedure similar to flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin. Both you and the research nurse will be unaware of the 
specific medication you have been assigned on each visit, although this information will be available if necessary. Because 
of the side effects of morphine and because we do not know which study session you will be assigned to receive morphine, 
you will need to arrange for someone to drive you home from all three study sessions and refrain from driving for 
at least [ADDRESS_1081300]. Then a venous cannula (similar to an i.v. like 
you might get in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) will be placed in your nondominant arm by [CONTACT_54340]. In the first and fourth sessions 
only, a 4ml blood sample (about 1 teaspoon) will then be obtained from this cannula to assess levels of natural 
cannabinoids (chemicals produced naturally by [CONTACT_786180]) that may 
impact on pain and medication responses.   Following blood sampling, you will complete a questionnaire to describe your 
current low back pain intensity.  You will then receive 4 infusions of the medication that has been assigned for that 
laboratory session, each approximately 20 minutes apart .  During the session in which you receive morphine, you will 
receive small doses of morphine in all 4 infusions.  During the naloxone session, you will receive naloxone during 2 of the 4 
infusions.  In the placebo session, you will receive placebo in all 4 infusions.   
 
Ten minutes after each dose of medication is received (to allow peak drug activity to be achieved) , you will be asked to 
complete a brief questionnaire to describe your chronic back pain intensity. Then, you will undergo a thermal pain task to 
assess heat pain threshold and tolerance. This task will involve repeated brief applications of a computer-controlled heat 
stimulus to several areas of your non-dominant forearm. The equipment used in this task is safe and only produces heat at 
[ADDRESS_1081301] becomes painful (your heat pain threshold), and three brief trials during which you will be asked to indicate when your heat pain tolerance has been 
reached. For each trial, as soon as your tolerance is reached, the equipment will rapi[INVESTIGATOR_786172], ending the pain stimulus. Immediately upon completion of the final heat pain tolerance trial, you will be asked 
to rate the quality and intensity of the pain you experienced, as well as any drug-related side effects.  These same thermal pain task procedures will be repeated after all 4 of the drug infusions.

You will have an equal chance of being assigned to either group.  If you are assigned to the no-intervention control group, you will be asked to maintain the same activity 
level throughout your study participation that you maintained prior to beginning the study.  After completing your study 
participation, you may engage in any additional exercise activities if you choose to.  You will also complete a brief (less than 
15 minutes) assessment regarding your pain, function, and emotional state over the phone on a weekly basis.  If you are assigned to the aerobic exercise training intervention, you will be asked to participate in 3 aerobic exercise sessions supervised by a certified personal trainer per week for 6 weeks (18 sessions total).  Exercise in these sessions will be of progressively increasing intensity over the [ADDRESS_1081304] your preferred form of aerobic exercise from the following options: treadmill 
walking/running, stair steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], the elliptical machine, or stationary cycling. Your back pain, heart rate, and perceived level 
of exertion will be monitored by [CONTACT_786181], with activities adjusted during 
each session to help you increase your level of aerobic conditioning while minimizing any exacerbations of back pain.  Each week during this exercise intervention period, you will also be asked to complete a brief (less than 15 minutes) assessment 
regarding your pain, function, and emotional state over the phone.   
 
After the intervention period, regardless of which group you are assigned to, you will be asked to  return for [ADDRESS_1081305]-treatment follow-up assessment, you will again be 
asked to complete a 5-day electronic diary monitoring period using procedures identical to those described above.   
 
Giving samples for genetic research is your free choice and you may be in the study even if you do not want your samples 
used or stored for genetic research. There will be a separate section at the end of this form where you can indicate whether

3. Costs to you if you take part in this study: 
 There is no cost to you for taking part in this study. All procedures described above are solely for the research  
purposes of this study. However, you are still responsible for paying for the usual care you would normally receive  
for the treatment of your illness. This includes treatments and tests you would need even if you were not in this  
study. These costs will be billed to you and/or your insurance.  
 
 
4. Side effects and risks that you can expect if you take part in this study:  
 
You may find completing questionnaires regarding your pain and psychological state to be mildly distressing. This level of 
distress is likely to be similar to what would occur if you were discussing these issues with your physician or a family 
member.    
You may find certain aspects of the evaluation of your pain-related symptoms to be mildly uncomfortable .   
 
You will experience brief, moderate intensity acute pain upon application of the thermal pain stimuli that will be used for 
assessment of your natural pain control systems and your responses to morphine. However, you have total control over the 
duration of your exposure to these pain stimuli because you stop each task by [CONTACT_786182]: 11/06/2018

Study Title:  Reduced Opi[INVESTIGATOR_786162]/Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: Vanderbilt University School of Medicine  
 
[ADDRESS_1081307] is expected to be minimal.    
You will experience very brief, mild pain upon insertion of a cannula (for study drug administration) during each study 
session. This event is similar to what you have likely experienced at some point during medical treatment when bloo d 
samples were drawn, or if you have ever received an IV while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. Insertion will be performed by a trained nurse or 
physician to minimize discomfort associated with insertion of the cannula. There is a risk of infection and local inflammatio n 
at the site of cannula insertion. Precautions will be taken to insure that such risks are minimized.    The following risks relate to the medications to be used in the study. The medication used for opi[INVESTIGATOR_188261], naloxone, 
has been used clinically for decades for treatment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_786173]. It is not an 
experimental or new drug, and is FDA-approved for those purposes. Previous studies indicate that it is safe for individuals 
who are not opi[INVESTIGATOR_252190], do not have liver disease, and do not have cardiovascular problems. Potential subjects 
experiencing these types of problems will be excluded from this study to insure a maximal level of safety with drug administration. Individuals taking daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], even if not dependent, will also be excluded from the study to avoid 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_786174]. In some individuals, naloxone may increase pain sensitivity to the acute pain 
tasks somewhat, but again, you may terminate these tasks if you reach your tolerance limit. Based on previous studies, 
naloxone is expected to have limited if any direct effects on your back pain intensity, and therefore, there appears to be little 
risk of exacerbating your chronic pain condition. Even if such changes do occur, the brief half-life of naloxone (on average, 
approximately 45-60 minutes) insures that any pain exacerbation will be of short duration.  With the exception of possible 
effects on pain sensitivity, naloxone is not known to be associated with other clinically significant effects in healthy 
individuals who are not opi[INVESTIGATOR_786175].   
 
The other study drug, morphine, is an FDA-approved opi[INVESTIGATOR_786176] a very long history of use in standard clinical 
practice. It can produce dose-dependent side effects including sedation, somnolence (sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]), allergic reactions (which 
may be life threatening), itching, nausea, vomiting, euphoria (feeling good), hallucinations, vision changes, urinary retention, 
constipation, and slowing of breathing rate. The dose used in th is study will be adjusted to your weight, and the total dose 
you will receive represents a relatively low dose within the normal range of dosages used in standard clinical practice. This should help limit any negative side effects. The effects of morphine can last for four hours or more.  You will be kept under observation in each study session until all side effects remit to the point where it is safe for you to leave.  You will need to 
arrange for someone to drive you home from the appointment and refrain from driving for at least 6 hours after the study 
drug was given.  If morphine side effects are severe, these effects will be immediately reversed by [CONTACT_786183].   
 
As part of this study, you may be assigned by [CONTACT_786184] a 6-week aerobic exercise intervention as described 
above.  To maximize safety with this type of exercise, individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease are excluded from participating in this study.  The intensity of this aerobic exercise training will start low but progressively increase over the 6-
week intervention period .  It is possible that you may experience short-term increases or decreases in your chronic pain 
following your exercise sessions.   Safety and possible discomfort associated with these increases in exercise intensity will 
be minimized via close monitoring by a certified personal trainer of your heart rate, perceived exertion levels, and your back 
pain during exercise.  Exercise intensity will be adjusted as appropriate to maximize your level of conditioning while 
minimizing exacerbation of your back pain.  In addition, you will be able to choose your preferred form of exercise from 
several available options.

In the event new information becomes available that may affect the risks or benefits associated with this study or your 
willingness to participate in it, you will be notified so that you can make an informed decision whether or not to continue your participation in this study. 
 
6.   Payment in case you are injured because of this research study: 
 
If it is determined by [CONTACT_92949] a direct result of the tests or treatments that 
are done for research, then you and/or your insurance will not have to pay for the cost of immediate medical care provided 
at Vanderbilt to treat the injury.  There are no plans for Vanderbilt to pay for the costs of any additional care. There are no 
plans for Vanderbilt to give you money for the injury.  
 
7.   Good effects that might result from this study:   
 
a) The benefits to science and humankind that might result from this study are an improved understanding of endogenous 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_786177], and how these changes impact on 
responsiveness to opi[INVESTIGATOR_73409].  This study has the potential to significantly advance knowledge regarding 
mechanisms underlying individual differences in responsiveness to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], and how these mechanisms can be 
manipulated through non-drug interventions in a way that may reduce reliance upon high-dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_786178].  
   
b) If you are assigned by [CONTACT_786185], you may 
experience a decrease in the intensity of your low back pain as a result.  Any improvement might be temporary, but would 
be more likely to continue if you continue to engage in similar exercise activities.   
 
8.   Other treatments you could get if you decide not to be in this study: 
   
This is not a study designed to determine the effectiveness of a new treatment for back pain.  Exercise interventions like 
those used in this study are available through most physical therapy providers and personal trainers.   
 
9.   Payments for your time spent taking part in this study or expenses  
 If you are assigned to the exercise condition, you will be compensated for your time with $75 for the baseline screening 
session and electronic diary monitoring period, $100 for each completed laboratory session (6 sessions if you complete the 
full protocol), $30 for each completed exercise session (up to 18 sessions), $30 each week for completing phone follow- up 
questionnaires, and $75 for the follow-up electronic diary monitoring period, all paid by [CONTACT_786189].  If you are assigned to the control condition, you will be compensated for 
your time with $75 for the baseline screening session and electronic diary monitoring period, $100 for each completed 
laboratory session (6 sessions if you complete the full protocol), $30 each week for completing phone follow- up 
questionnaires, and $75 for the follow-up electronic diary monitoring period, all paid by [CONTACT_786186].   We may ask you for your Social Security Number and address before you 
are compensated for taking part in this study.  You may receive up to $ 1,470 for taking part in this study.  This amount may 
be taxable and will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service.  Your payment cannot be processed until the PDA

manual for your body. The genes you get from your parents decide what you look like and how your body behaves. They can also tell us a person’s risk for certain diseases and how they will respond to treatment.   
 
You are being asked to give a blood sample for genetic research.  What we learn about you from this sample will not be put in your health record.  Your test results will not be shared with you or your doctor.  No one else (like a relative, boss, or insurance company) will be given your test results.  Your sample will only be used for research at Vanderbilt University and will not be sold.  Health insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic 
information that comes from this research.  
 
A single blood sample of about ½ teaspoon will be obtained through the cannula already inserted in your arm as part of 
the study for extraction of genetic samples. 
 
One risk of giving samples for this research may be the release of your name [CONTACT_691848]/or the results of the tests run on your samples. This may cause problems with insurance or getting a job.  
 
Health insurance companies and group health plans may not use your genetic information when making decisions 
regarding your eligibility or premiums. Employers with [ADDRESS_1081313] DNA that will be kept for an unknown length of time (maybe years) for future 
research.  The sample will be destroyed when it is no longer needed. 
 
Your samples will be used for research only and will not be sold or used to make products that could be sold  
for money. 
  
You will not receive any benefit as a result of the tests done on your samples.  These tests may help us learn more about 
the causes, risks, and treatments of chronic pain, or how to prevent this and other health problems.  
  
Giving samples for research is your free choice and you may be in the study even if you do not want your samples used or 
stored for gene research. 
 
 
At any time, you may ask to have your sample destroyed.  You should contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Stephen Bruehl at [ADDRESS_1081314]. South, Nashville, TN 372 12, ([PHONE_16402] to have your sample destroyed and no longer 
used for research.  We will not be able to destroy research data that has already been gathered using your sample.  Also, if 
your identity was removed from the samples, we will not be able to locate and destroy them.   
 There will be no costs to you for any of the tests done on your samples.  You will not be paid for the use of your samples.

 1.0 PURPOSE OF THE INVESTIGATION  
1.1. Background  
Surgical mesh used for hernia repair is classified by [CONTACT_4760] a Class II m edical device, which 
means that new surgical meshes receive “clearance” for mar keting via the 510(k) process.  In 
order for a new surgical mesh to receive clearance, it is required to demonstrate substantial 
equivalence to a predicate device.  The process is designed to assure safety and efficacy of new 
Class II devices without requiring over -burdensome clinical data.  It fosters the advancement of 
technology and allows new manufacturers to enter the marketplace in an expeditious fashion 
without introducing unreasonable risk to the public.  Because clinical data is not required for a 
company to receive 510(k) clearance of a device, and because clinical trials can be extremely 
costly, there is a scarcity of prospective safety and efficacy -driven trials for new surgical meshes.  
The relative lack of clinical data for the many types of surgical mesh on the market today can 
make it diffic ult for surgeons to select the best  mesh  for a given procedure.  
 
Hiatal hernia repair may be done with or w ithout the use of mesh; however, the SAGES 
Guidelines Committee  states that “t he use of mesh reinforcement of large hiatal hernia repairs 
leads to decreas ed short term recurrence rates” (2) .  The Committee also identifies a  need for 
longer -term results.  Extending the focus from large hiatal hernias to small ones, Schmidt et al. 
performed a retrospective review of 70 patients with 1 -5 cm hiatal hernias and reported a 
recurrence rate of 16% (5 /32) in the suture cruroplasty group, compared with a recurrence rate of 
0% (0/38) in the group with crural rei nforcement with absorbable mesh (3) .  Their research 
points to the value of using biologic mesh in even small hiatal  hernia repairs.   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_68867] c oncerns related to the use of synthetic mesh in hiatal hernia repair including  
erosion, dysphagia, and stricture, Wassenaar et.al. studied 73 subjects who had laparoscopic  
hiatal hernia repair with biologic mesh, with a median follow -up time of 45 months  totaling 530 
patient years , and found no evidence of stricture, ulceration, or erosion in any of the patient s.  
Given the absence of major complicati ons and the high (>90%)  overall  satisfaction with the 
operation, this research underscores the value of biologic mesh for hiatal hernia repair  (4).   
Miromatrix Medical has devel oped MIROMESH ® - a new, noncrosslinked, acellular mesh 
derived from the highly vascularized porcine liver .  MIROMESH received FDA 510(k) 
clearance with an indication for reinforcement of soft tissue  on March 31, [ADDRESS_75333] is  the only technology available to fully 
decellularize solid organs while maintaining their structure and vasculature,  thereby [CONTACT_68875] a highly vascularized, full -thickness biological mesh for hernia repair. The 
substantial vascularity and favorable tissue composition of this  biological mesh differentiate it 
from the thin, dense (primarily skin) tissues currently on the market that rely on immersion 
decellularization .  
This study will serve to provide clinicians with high- quality clinical data  in order to provide 
them with a higher degree of confidence when selecting M IROMESH for hiat al hernia repair.

  MIROMESH PM -[ADDRESS_75339] charts to rule out any 
obvious study exclusion criteria prior to introducing the study to the patient.   
 
Prior to the hernia repair surgery, t he Principal Investigator (or a trained and qualified delegate) 
will introduce the study and review the full set of study c riteria with the patient.  If the patient 
meets all study criteria, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_68869] -approved consent form 
with the patient.  The patient will be encouraged to ask questions and will have all of their 
questions addressed to th eir satisfaction before deciding whether or not to be in the study.  A 
copy of the consent form will be made available to the subject to take home for review and 
discussion with family members.  If the patient agrees to participate in the study, (s)he will sign 
the consent form and will be provided with a signed copy for their records.  Upon signing the 
consent form, the patient will be considered “enrolled” as a study subject.  Refer to section 6.0 
for additional details about the consent process. 
2.5.2  Surgical  treatment  
Antibiotics will be administered prophylactically according to the physician’s standard practice.   
 
All study subjects will receive the  FDA cleared MIROMESH  study device as part of their 
laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair surgery.  Prior to use, the study device (s) will be soaked for a 
minimum of 2 minutes using a sterile basin and room temperature sterile saline or room 
temperature sterile lactated Ringer’ s solution to cover the mesh.   
The hernia sac shoul d be dissected away from mediastinal structures and excised whenever 
possible.  The gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) will be returned to a tension- free 
infradiaphragmatic position with the intra -abdominal esophagus measuring at least [ADDRESS_75340]’s anatomy and defect , and should then be 
placed in an onlay fashion to reinforce primary crural closure .  A small space of at least 0.[ADDRESS_75341] 
of the mesh with the esophagus  (4) (5).  Mesh fixation may be achieved with glue, tacks , or 
sutures, or any combination thereof.  Care should be taken that fixation methods do not breach 
the aorta or pericardium when applied low on the left crus or near the apex of the crura anteriorly  
(2).  Fundoplication will be performed at the discretion of the investigator and the degree of wrap 
will be documented for study records.   
Subjects should not be placed on the  immunosuppressant drug  rapamycin  for at least [ADDRESS_75342]-surgery, as it has been shown to inhibit vascularization and incorporation of surgical mesh 
(6).

  MIROMESH PM -[ADDRESS_75350] Surveys  
Miromatrix Medical Inc. has entered into an agreement with OptumInsight Life Sciences, Inc. to 
use the SF -36v2™ survey for this study.  SF -36v2™ is a 36- question quality -of-life survey that 
is common ly used in research, including hernia studies. It measures eight domains; four of these 
are related to physical heath, and four are related to mental health.  The physical health domains 
include physical functioning, physical role, bodily pain, and general  health.  The mental health 
domains include vitality, social functioning, emot ional role, and mental health.  Investigators 
may use and administer the Survey Materials only through investigational sites, only on behalf of 
Miromatrix Medical Inc., only duri ng the Study Term (June 11, 2015 to March 31, 2018) and 
only for the Approved Purpose (MIROMESH PM -2).  Investigator sites may not use the Survey 
Materials for any other purpose.   Refer to Appendix C for additional details. 
 
The GERD Health Related Quality of Life (GERD -HRQL) survey  will serve  as a measurement 
tool for  this study due to the close relationship between hiatal hernia and gastroesophageal reflux 
disease ( GERD ) symptoms.  The survey provide s a quantitative method of measuring  GERD 
symptom severity .  There are 51 possible scores, imparting the instrument  with a high level of 
precision; and because of the response anchors, the instrument cannot have a floor effect.  A  
study by [CONTACT_68876].  The GERD -HRQL has been shown to be 
reliable, valid, and practical for  the assessment of sympt om severity in gastroesophageal reflux 
disease (7).   
 
In addition to the GERD -HRQL survey, subjects will be asked to complete symptom Visual 
Analog Scales (VAS) to assess the following hernia -related symptoms: regurgitation, chest pain, 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, postprandial pain, cardiovascular, and pulmonary.  Subjects 
will be asked to indicate their symptoms over the previous 7 days by [CONTACT_740] a line on a 10- cm 
scale, with 0 representing ‘no effect on life’ and 10 representing ‘extreme effect on life’.   
 
2.5.5  Hernia recurrence  
Hernia recurrence is defined as a >2 cm protrusion of an organ through the esophageal opening 
in the diaphragm  as identified on UGI  (x-ray with barium contrast ).  This definition is consistent 
with the definition of hernia recurrence for a previous study  (8).  Recurrent hernias will be 
measur ed according to the distance from the apex of the hiatus to the posterior decussation of the 
left and right crus.  Classification categories for reporting purposes will be as follows:  
1) No evidence of recurrence  
2) ≤2 cm organ protrusion above diaphragm  
3) Between  2 and 4 cm organ protrusion above diaphragm  
4) >[ADDRESS_75351] will be  
discontinued from the study .

considered a failure.  
 
Secondary endpoints:  
• Assessment of hernia recurrence requi ring surgical reoperation at one year  post procedure 
for subjects that rec eived implant of the mesh  
• Assessment of quality of life and symptomatic hernia recurrence using the SF-36, GERD-
HRQL , and symptom  questionnaires at 2 week s, 2 months , 6 months, 1 year, 18 months, 
and 2 years  
• Assessment of hernia recurrence >[ADDRESS_75353] procedure in comparison to discharge imaging .   
• Assessment of device -related and procedure- related adverse events over time 
• Procedure characteristics for the hiatal hernia repair surgery will include at a minimum:  
− Length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
− Procedure time  
− Implant success  
2.6.2  Sample size determination  
This trial is an observational trial designed to gather long -term data for assessing performance of 
the Miromatrix Biological Mesh  (MIROMESH ®). Up to [ADDRESS_75354] symptoms and quality of life .  There is no sample size calculation, but a sample size of 
30 is “rule of thumb” generally accepted as an adequate sample size for preliminary summaries.   
While the exact rate of success (no recurrence of hernia requiring success) is unknown t o this 
study population, Table 3  below provides expected 95% confidence int erval widths for various 
sample sizes and success using the binomial approach.  Using worst case scenario in the 
binomial distribution of 50%, the worst expected CI width will be in the 29- 37% range with 
sample size of 30 to 50 subjects.

The greater than minimal risk designation (as defined in 45 CFR Part 46) is solely due to the x -
ray imaging required at the discharge, 1- year, and 2 -year visits.  Some of this imaging 
(specifically the discharge x -ray) may be considered standard of care at  certain facilities.  
An x -ray of the upper GI tract provides an average radiation dose of 6 mSv.  This amount of 
radiation is comparable to the natural background radiation for 2 years, with an additional 
lifetime risk of fatal cancer from the examination  estimated at 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 1,0001.  
Subjects in this study will be exposed to three such doses, all approximately one year apart. 
Anticipated risks of receiving the study device are the same regardless of whether a patient 
decides to participate in the study .  Known risks related to surgical mesh for hiatal hernia repair 
include, but are not limited to  (9): 
 
• Infection  
• Pain 
• Adhesions  
• Erosion/migration  
• Compromised sterility  
• Bleeding  • Mechanical failure  
• Foreign body reaction  
• Seroma 
• No in -growth  
• Mesh shrinkage  
• Hematoma  
There is a small risk of  loss of confidentiality  due to study participation .  
3.2 Adverse event reporting  
For the purposes of this study, reportable adverse events will be limited to all events related to, 
or possibly related to, the study device and/or procedure .  There may be adverse events which 
meet the SAE definition but are not related to the device or procedure; such events will not be 
collected in this study.  The sponsor will determine if an event meets Medical Device Reporting 
(MDR) require ments .  All MDR r eportable events will be reported to FDA as detailed in section 
3.2.5. 
3.2.1  Adverse event definitions 
Adverse Event: Any  untoward medical occurrence associated with  the use of  a device in 
humans, whether or not considered device related.

  MIROMESH PM -[ADDRESS_75358]: An adverse event caused by [CONTACT_68878].   
Serious adverse effect:  An adverse effect is considered “serious” if, i n the view of either the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death  
• a life -threatening AE  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• a persistent or s ignificant disability or permanent damage  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage . 
 
Life-threatening adverse effect:  Any adverse effect that places the subject, in the view of either 
the investigator or the sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the effect as it occurred .  It does 
not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 
MDR -reportable event: events that manufacturers become aware of that reasonably suggest 
that one of their marketed devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or 
has malfunctioned and the  malfunction of the device or a similar device that they market would 
be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur . 
3.2.[ADDRESS_75359] information  
Clinical study subjects will be routinely ques tione d about adverse event s at study visits.  
3.2.3  Recording and assessing of adverse effects  
All observed or volunteered reportable adverse ef fects (serious or non- serious) will be recorded 
in the subjects’ case histories.  S ufficient information will be pursued and/or obtained so as to 
permit 1) an adequate determination of the outcome of the effect (i.e., whether the effect should 
be classified as a serious adverse effect ) and; 2) an assessment of the casual relationship bet ween 
the adverse effect and the study device .    
Adverse ef fects believed  to be associated with the study device will be followed until the effect 
(or its sequela e) resolves or stabilizes at a level accept able to the investigator  or until stud y 
completion, whichever is sooner .  
3.2.4  Causality and severity assessment  
The investigator will promptly review reportable adverse effects to determine 1) if there is a 
reasonable possibility that the adverse effect was caused by [CONTACT_68879] ; and  2) if the adverse effect meets the criteria for a serious adverse effect . 
3.2.[ADDRESS_75360] -reportable events  to the FDA’s Center for Devices 
and Radiological Health  according to the table below .

a clinical trials registration policy as a condition for publication.  The ICMJE defines a clinical 
trial as any research project that prospectively assigns human subjects t o intervention or 
concurrent comparison or control groups to study the cause -and-effect relationship between a 
medical intervention and a health outcome.  Medical interventions include drugs, surgical 
procedures, devices, behavioral treatments, process -of-care changes, and the like.  Health 
outcomes include any biomedical or health- related measures obtained in patients or participants, 
including pharmacokinetic measures and adverse events. The ICMJE policy requires that all 
clinical trials be registered in a public trials registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov , which is 
sponsored by [CONTACT_1055].  The sponsor will  register th is trial on 
ClinicalTrials.gov  in order for the research results to  be considered for publication in ICMJE 
member journals.

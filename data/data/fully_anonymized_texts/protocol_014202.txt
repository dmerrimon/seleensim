 CONFIDENTIAL   page [ADDRESS_1014134] on a patient's vision and quality of life.  Reducing intraocular pressure currently is the only proven treatment for 
glaucoma.  
Treatment for open -angle glaucoma (OAG) traditionally has started with 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_11228].  Development of more effective medications has increased the popularity of this approach as initial treatment compared to more invasive incisional or drainage device surgery. Furthermore, the more benign medica tion treatments preserve the ocular 
tissues in the event that more invasive surgical approaches are eventually required. 
The various topi[INVESTIGATOR_11229], β -adrenergic receptor antagonists (β -blockers), carboni c anhydrase 
inhibitors (CAIs), α -adrenergic receptor agonists (α -agonists), and 
prostaglandin analogues (PGA s).  The PG As are a class of ocular hypotensive 
agents that have been proven effective in lowering IOP in subjects with OAG or OHT.  Other a dvantage s of this class of medications is that the systemic 
side effects associated with α -agonists (e.g., dry mouth, drowsiness) 
and  β - blockers (e.g., depression, fatigue, bradycardia) do not appear to be 
associated with PG As.  Furthermore, the ocular side effe cts typi[INVESTIGATOR_11230] a-agonists (e.g., allergic reactions), and cholinergic agents (e.g.,  reduced  vision), do not seem to manifest with the use of PGA s. 
However , PGAs have been shown to be associated with side effects such as 
ocular hyperemia, iris hyperchromia, periorbital atrophy, increased eyelash 
growth, general ocular surface discomfort and headache.

Screening Procedure:  
After providing informed consent, prospective subjects will be evaluated 
against the S creening criteria.  At Visit 1 (Screening), all subjects must meet 
all entry criteria.  
Subjects who qualify at Visit 1 (S creening ) may be scheduled for Visit 2 
(Operative Exchange Day 0 ) on a separate day.   
The eye previously implanted with a Travoprost Intraocular Implant in the 
GC-009 study (study eye) will be  assessed at Visit 1 (S creening ).  The subject 
may then be scheduled for study treatment.   Subjects will be trea ted 
unilaterally, only the implanted eye (study eye) will go through the study 
treatment.  The fellow eye will be treated outside the parameters of the study 
per investigator discretion using their standard of care options.

 8.5 Safety Analyses 
8.5.1 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse events (AEs) in the study eye will be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) nomenclature. Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) are defined as those AEs that occur after the initial treatment at Visit 2 (Operative Exchange Day 0) .   
AEs that occur on the date of the procedure are classified as either intra -
operative or post- operative. Post-operative AEs are considered to be TEAEs. 
Intra-operative AE s and TEAEs will be summarized separately and presented  
in separate listings .  
A line listing of serious adverse events will be provided. 
 
8.5.2 OTHER SAFETY MEASURES  
Details of analyses for other saf
 ety measures (see Section 5.2) will be  provided
 
in the SAP.  
 
8.6 Inter
im Analyses 
N
o interim analyses are planned.  
 
9 ADVERSE EVENTS   
An Adverse Event ( AE) is defined as any untoward and unintended medical 
occurrence (e.g., sign, symptom, disease, syndrome, intercurrent illness) that 
occurs in a study subject, regardless of the suspected cause during the study. Adverse events will be clearly documented on the study source document and 
monitored throughout the course of the study.   
Events occurring after signing the informed consent but prior to the implant o 
procedure should be documented in the medical history.  Events observed during or after the initial implant or exchange procedure until the final study visit, are to be recorded as AEs if they are in the study eye and deemed related to the implant or procedure.  
Any clinically significant change in a subject's condition after receiving the 
study treatments , regardless of causality, is to be considered an adverse event, 
unless the change is determined to be a continuation of a pre- existing 
condition that is documented in the subject's medical history.  If an adverse 
event occurs,  an AE form must be completed.   
 CONFIDENTIAL   page 25 of 35 
 An AE includes any of the following:  
• An exacerbation or an unexpected increase in frequency or intensity of a 
pre-existing condition, including intermittent or epi[INVESTIGATOR_11238] 
• New conditions or illnesses detected or diagnosed after the implant procedure 
• A suspected interaction with any  of the study treatments  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
any of the study treatments or a concomitant medication  
• Any clinically significant laboratory finding that was not present prior to 
receiving any of the st udy treatments  
An AE does NOT  include any of the following: 
• Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of any pre -existing conditions, 
including the disease under study (OAG and OHT). 
• Medical or surgical procedure, (e.g., colonoscopy or hernia repair).  The condition that led to the procedure may be an AE, if not present in medical history. 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11239] (social o r convenience admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
• Pre-existing co nditions or diseases that were present before receiving any 
of the study treatments that do not worsen or that are chronic but stable 
• Changes in a chronic condition or disease that are consistent with natural 
disease progression.  (These medical conditions should be adequately 
documented).   
• Lack of efficacy of the study treatment for the condition being investigated.   
 
AEs will be graded on a 3-point scale and reported in detail as indicated on the CRF:  
Mild : easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with normal everyday activities  
Moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities  
Severe:  incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities  
 
 CONFIDENTIAL   page 26 of 35 
 The relationship of each AE to study treatment should be determined by [CONTACT_11258]: 
 
Definitely Unrelated : the event is clearly related to other factors such as the 
subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject  
 
Unlikely Related : the event is most likely produced by [CONTACT_11259]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject ; and 
does not follow a known response pattern to the study medication  
 
Possibly Related : the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
the time of drug administration; and/or follows a known response pattern to the study medication; but could have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject  
 
Probably Related : the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
the time of drug administration; and /or follows a known 
response pattern to the study medi cation; and is not likely 
to have been produced by [CONTACT_11260]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject  
 
Definitely Related : the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence f rom 
the time of drug administration; and follows a known response pattern to the study medication; and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1014155], or precaution.  Any adverse event is considered a serious adverse event if it results in any of the f ollowing outcomes: 
- Death  
- Life- or sight- threatening  
- Required admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11240]  (emergency room visits that do not result in admission 
to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11241]) 
- A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
- A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 CONFIDENTIAL   page 27 of 35 
 The terms “mild,” “moderate,” and “severe” are measures of intensity; thus a 
severe AE is not necessarily serious.   For example, nausea of several hours 
duration may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious.  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening,  or 
require admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11242] a serious adverse drug 
experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  A life -threatening event is any 
event that places the subject at substantial risk of death from the event as it occurred; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  A sight -threatening event is any event that 
places the subject at risk of permanently losing vision in either eye as a direct result of the event. 
 
Serious adverse events must be reported to Glaukos immediately (preferably within 24 hours of knowledge of the event ). 
Email:   
When new significant information (including the outcome of the event) is obtained, t
he investigator should inform Glaukos as soon as possible.  
Depending on the nature of the AE, Glaukos may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_11245] s of the subject.  If the subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11244] a study- treatment related serious adverse event, a copy of the discharge 
summary must be forwarded to Glaukos as soon as possible. 
 
9.2 Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adve rse event is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed, or is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or protocol.   
Unexpected adverse events must be reported to Glaukos immediately 
(preferably within 24 hours of knowledge of the event).    Email:   
When new significant information (including the outcome of the event) is 
obtained, t
he investigator should inform Glaukos as soon as possible.  
Depending on the nature of the AE, Glaukos may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_11245] s of the subject.  If the subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11244] a study- treatment related unexpected adverse event , a copy of the 
discharge summary must be forwarded to Glaukos as soon as possible. 
 

 CONFIDENTIAL   page 28 of 35 
 9.3 Suspected, Unexpected, Serious, Adverse Reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
A Suspected , Unexpected , Serious, Adverse Reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R) is a ny AE for 
which there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
Travoprost Intraocular Implant and the AE, and which is assessed as both unexpected and serious.  An unexpected adverse reaction, i.e. any untoward and unintended response to any o f the study treatments , is one for which the 
nature and severity is inconsistent with the applicable reference safety 
information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure).  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1014156] (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) .  Prior to undergoing any study related change in their 
treatment or any study related procedures, a subject  must understand, sign, 
and date the appropriate IRB- approved Informed Consent Form.  The signed 
and dated Informed Consent Form will be retained with the study records, and a copy of the signed Informed Consent will be given to the subject.

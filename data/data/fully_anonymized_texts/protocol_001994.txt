WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of propranolol on adult smokers. Propranolol is 
approved by [CONTACT_137493] a commonly prescribed beta-blocker medicine 
used to treat heart or circulatory conditions, such as high blood pressure and arrhythmia. Propranolol is 
not approved for use to help people quit smoking. In this study, this medication is being investigated to 
examine potential effects on smoking behavior. You are being asked to be in this study because you are 
an adult right-handed smoker who has no plans to quit smoking during the course of this study. The 
drugs that you will be given include propranolol and/or a placebo (a capsule that contains no active 
drug). We will measure your brain activity while you are in a MRI machine after you have taken these 
drugs. You will return back to the office on a separate day and complete some additional tasks after 
taking another dose of the medication.  
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?
Approximately 75 people between the ages of 18 and 55 will be recruited for this study at Duke 
University Medical Center. 
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY?
If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to sign and date this consent form prior to any tests or 
procedures. Then, you will have the following tests and procedures to make sure that you are eligible. 
The first visit will last around 2.5-3 hours. 
General Information: We will need to know your name, age, date of birth, sex, race, address, 
medical history, phone number, and social security number. We will need your social security 
number to process your participant payment. If you choose not to provide your social security 
number, we will not be able to reimburse you for your participation.
Urine Sample Collection: The urine sample will be used to test for drugs of abuse. Some 
prescription drugs can also be detected by [CONTACT_137494]. If you test positive for any of 
the drugs measured by [CONTACT_137495], you will not be allowed to participate in this study. 
Expi[INVESTIGATOR_137489]: Breath samples will be used to measure the CO (carbon monoxide) 
and alcohol in your exhaled breath.
Medical History: You will provide information about your medical history.
Physical Exam: Participants will undergo a full physical exam by [CONTACT_137496]. This will include blood pressure readings and EKG. A 
blood sample will be drawn and submitted for analysis. 
Nicotine Use History: You will provide detailed information about your current and past use 
nicotine. You will also identify places where you do smoke, as well as places where you do not 
smoke.
Psychiatric Screen: You will undergo a psychiatric evaluation for symptoms for psychiatric 
disorders 
MRI Safety Questionnaire: This questionnaire will help determine it if is safe for you to enter the 
MRI scanner.
Mock scanner: You will enter a mock MRI scanner to assess if you do feel comfortable in order 
to complete a real MRI session

allowed to complete the scan. Afterwards, you will be administered either propranolol or a placebo 
medication. A placebo is an inactive substance given in the same forma sat the active drug, propranolol. 
You will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to receive either propranolol or placebo. You 
have a [ADDRESS_156199] about 2.5 hours. 
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THIS STUDY?
All subjects will have a total of 5 visits (1 screening visit, 1 training visit, 1 camera return session, a 
fMRI session, and laboratory session). This study can be completed within 2 – 4 weeks based on 
availability and schedule preferences.

WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?
For Women of Childbearing Potential: 
Being a part of this study while pregnant may expose the unborn child to significant risks, some of 
which may be currently unforeseeable. Therefore, pregnant women will be excluded from the study. If 
you are a woman of childbearing potential, a blood pregnancy test will be done (using 2 teaspoons of 
blood drawn from a vein by [CONTACT_79825]-stick), and it must be negative before you can continue in this study. 
Urine pregnancy tests will also be conducted prior to receiving the study medications. These tests must 
be negative before you can continue in the study. If sexually active, you must agree to use appropriate 
contraceptive measures for the duration of the study. Medically acceptable contraceptives include: (1) 
surgical sterilization (such as a tubal ligation or hysterectomy), (2) approved hormonal contraceptives 
(such as birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patches, implants or injections), (3) barrier methods (such as a condom or 
diaphragm) used with a spermicide, or (4) an intrauterine device (IUD). Contraceptive measures such as 
Plan B (TM), sold for emergency use after unprotected sex, are not acceptable methods for routine use. 
If you do become pregnant during this study or if you have unprotected sex, you must inform your study 
physician immediately. 
Risks of Blood Drawing:
Risks associated with drawing blood from your arm include momentary discomfort and/or bruising.
Infection, excess bleeding, clotting or fainting are also possible, although unlikely. The total amount of 
blood drawn for the entire study will not exceed 4 teaspoons (20 ml).
Propranolol Side Effects:
The primary risk associated with this study are the side effects associated with the study medication. 
Common side effects include hypotension, bradycardia (slow heart rate), cold extremities, transient 
fatigue, sleep disturbance, drowsiness, agitation and irritability, dizziness, and Raynaud’s phenomenon 
(e.g. coldness/numbness in the fingers and toes). 
Most of the side effects are minor and resolve quickly on their own. In order to minimize risks, we do 
ask that you give your medical history and completely and accurately as possible. We will monitor these 
risks by [CONTACT_137497]. 
Effects of Nicotine Withdrawal:
You may experience the following symptoms when you abstain from smoking for the two periods (one 
for 24-hours and another for 6-hours) in the study: cravings for nicotine, anxiety, irritability, 
restlessness, mood changes, nervousness, disruptions of you sleep, drowsiness, trouble concentrating, 
increased appetite, headaches, muscular pain, constipation and fatigue. These may begin almost 
immediately after you stop smoking.

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imagining (fMRI) Risks: 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a magnet and radio waves to make diagnostic medical images 
of the body. There have been no ill effects reported from exposure to the magnetism or radio waves used 
in this test. However, it is possible that harmful effects could be recognized in the future.
A known risk is that the magnet could attract certain kinds of metal. Therefore, we will carefully ask you 
about metal within your body (this includes certain dyes found in tattoos). If you have metal within your 
body, tell us immediately, since it will be dangerous for you to be in an MRI machine. If there is any 
question about potentially hazardous metal within your body, you will be excluded from participating in 
this research study. We will also keep the MRI locked so that no one carrying metal objects can enter 
while you are in the scanner.
The study involves entering a large room in which a magnet is present. You will be placed on a narrow 
bed and then slid into a small tunnel approximately 6 feet in length and 25 inches in diameter. You will 
be asked to lie still for about one hour on this bed and will hear loud noises during this time. Some 
people who are claustrophobic (afraid of being in cramped places like closets or crowded elevators) may 
experience extreme anxiety when placed in a MRI machine. You may be asked to have a harmless 
monitoring device applied during the study. During the study, you will have voice contact [CONTACT_137498]. 
There may be risks, discomforts, drug interactions or side effects that are not yet known. 
Psychiatric Assessment Risks:
This is a research study that involves questions that ask about your mental state which may cause discomfort. 
As researchers, we do not provide mental health services. It is possible that we will not view your responses 
for several days, weeks, or months after you complete the surveys. Therefore, we will not know of any 
immediate risks that you may have for harming yourself or others, including suicidality. Should you decide 
you need assistance at any time while enrolled in this study, please contact [CONTACT_39635] ([PHONE_3090]) 
or principal investigator ([PHONE_3091]) for clinic referrals, or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-
[PHONE_113]).
Confidentiality:
The information obtained as a result of your participation in this research will not be included in your 
medical record by [CONTACT_3647]. Information from which you may be personally identified will be 
maintained in a confidential, locked file at DUMC or on a secured department server accessible only to 
the study. Information will not be disclosed to third parties except with your permission or as may be 
required by [CONTACT_2371]. There is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to keep 
your information confidential; however, this cannot be guaranteed. Some of the questions we will ask 
you as part of this study may make you feel uncomfortable. You may refuse to answer any of the 
questions and you may take a break at any time during the study. You may stop your participation in this 
study at any time.

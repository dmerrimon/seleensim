neuroendocrine  tumors (WDNETs) 
Study Centers:  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) 
Trial Phase: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_605158]: Well differentiated  neuroendocrine  tumors  (WDNETs) 
Trial Type: Two-arm  randomized  design 
Type of control: No treatment control 
Route  of administration: Each patient  on study will receive  three  injections of  intr amuscular  (IM) octreotide  
LAR and three injections of deep subcutaneous  (subq) lanreotid e 
Trial blinding: No trial blinding 
Numbe r of trial subjects:  50 patients
Estimated duration of trial: Approximately [ADDRESS_801300]’s last visit 
Study Design:  
 
 
This will be a two-arm, randomized,  pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] [ADDRESS_801301]-of-care  
SSA by [CONTACT_605171] (i.e. octreotide LAR before  lanreotid e,  or lanreotide  before octreotide LAR). 
Randomization  will occur centrally at MSKCC on day of protocol  enrollment.  Our nursing staff will administer    
all injections; octreotide LAR will be manually prepped  in cli nic just prior to injection, and lanreotide will be sent  
from pharmacy  in a prefilled syringe. Patients will receive  t hree monthly injections of one SSA (drug A),   
followed  by [CONTACT_605172] (drug B) . 
 
The study participation period for each patient is 6 months fro m the date of beginning  treatment. There will be  
4 time periods: 
 
1. Pre-treatment  evaluation  on day of protocol enrollment  at wh ich time a baseline questionnaire will be  
completed. 
2. SSA injections #1, 2, and 3 (with drug A) every  28 (+/- 3) day s with numeric pain score (0 to 10)  
obtained in clinic and by [CONTACT_605173]. 
3. SSA injections #4, 5, and 6 (with “drug B”) every  28 (+/- 3) d ays. 
4. End of study evaluation  after SSA injection #6, at which time a preference  questionnaire  will be  
completed by [CONTACT_16983]. 
 
After completion of this study, if patients are recommended  to  continue SSA therapy, they will continue on  
octreotide LAR moving  forward  which is on MSK formulary  with out restrictions. 
 
We anticipate accrual of 1 to 2 patients per month, with accrua l to this study completed in 24 to 36 months.

2.1 OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC AIMS Overview:  Octreotide  LAR has been used  
since the early  1990’s  to slow tumor growth.  The original  r egistration  was for control  of  
hormone-related  symptoms,  however  prolonged  progression-fre e  survival  (PFS) has been  
shown in a randomized,  double-blind,  plac ebo-controlled  trial.  However,  octreotide  LAR  
has not been specifically  registered  with the FDA for this sp ecific  purpose. 
 
Based on the more recently  published  registration  trial,  la nreotide  has been specifically 
FDA-approved  for tumor control  of well differentiate d  NETs.   NCCN guidelines  regard  these  
two agents  as equally  acceptable  treatment  options. However ,  the average  sales price  
(ASP) of one dose of octreotide  LAR is $3362,  while the ASP o f lanreotide  is $6157.  These  
shots are given  every  4 weeks. So the annual  costs are $43,7 06  versus  $80,041,  or 
$36,[ADDRESS_801302] of lanreotide  relative  t o octreotide  LAR is not warranted,  
and on the GI Oncology  Service  we use octreotide  LAR unless there  is a specific   
contraindic ation  which favors  lanreotide.  Both agents  are on the MSK formulary  (lanreotide  
available  with restrictions) . 
 
A major marketing  point of lanreotide  is the claim that the i njection  is more comfortable  for  
patients.  Octreotide  is given  as an intramuscular  injection ,  while lanreotide  is given  as a  
“deep subq injection,”  altho ugh  the designation  of “deep”  s ubq is uni que  to this agent  and  
is not well defined. We hypothesize  that patients  will find l ittle  or no subjective  difference  
between  these two injections.  A demonstration  of this is lik ely  to have a significant  impact  
on the treatment  of NETs in practice in this country  and abro ad.   There is considerable  
interest  in this  topic and this study within  the NET communi ty.

secondary objectives, as there are no validated questionnaires available to address these issues  
for this patient population. 
 
 Primary objective:  To compare injection  site pain  experience d with octreotide LAR and  
lanreotide. 
 Primary endpoint: Comparison of m ean pain score over the first three injections of either  
octreotide LAR or lanreotide. 
 Secondary objectives: 
o To evaluate if patients have a preference for octreotide LAR or  lanreotide. 
o To evaluate patient willingness to pay for preferred SSA therap y. 
o To quantify amount of time spent by [CONTACT_605174]. 
 Secondary endpoints: 
o Patient-reported preference of octreotide LAR vs lanreotide ass essed after six  
months of therapy by [CONTACT_447]-treatment questionnaire. 
o Patient-reported willingness to pay for preferred therapy, asse ssed by [CONTACT_447]-  
treatment questionnaire. 
o Nursing-reported measurement of time spent preparing SSA inject ions in clinic. 
 
3.1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
3.2 Well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (WDNETs)  
 
WDNETs are an uncommon and heterogeneous group of neoplasms tha t arise throughout the  
body, most commonly in the lung and gastrointestinal tract.1  These tumors are s ubdivided into  
carcinoid tumors and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (panNETs) ; panNETs are the second  
most common tumor of the pancreas, and represent 1-2% of all pa ncreatic neoplasms.2,[ADDRESS_801304], and  
panNETs develop from the endocrine tissues of the pancreas (i.e . islets of Langerhans). This  
group of WDNETs is both morphologically and clinically distinct  from high grade neuroendocrine  
carcinomas, tumors that are characterized by [CONTACT_605175]-based chem otherapy.[ADDRESS_801305] been no significant changes in survival from this disease.5,6 
Although the majority of WDNETs are slow growing, after the dev elopment of metastatic disease  
(most commonly, in the liver), median survival ranges from [ADDRESS_801306] patients with  
liver metastases will die from disease.7 A subset of carcinoid tumors (less than 10%) and  
panNETs (just over 30%) are functional tumors and produce clini cal syndromes due to excessive  
hormone secretion. Functional carcinoid tumors classically rele ase serotonin and can cause  
“carcinoid syndrome.” The release of serotonin can cause hot re d flushing of the face, severe  
diarrhea, and wheezing; rarely, the deposition of serotonin in the heart can cause cardiac  
disease.8  Functional panNETs are classified by [CONTACT_605176], and include  
insulinoma (secrete insulin and cause hypoglycemia), gastrinoma  (secrete gastrin and cause

Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which is characterized by [CONTACT_605177]), glucagonoma  
(secrete glucagon and cause hyperglycemia), and vasoactive inte stinal polypeptide (VIPoma,  
secrete VIP and cause severe secretory diarrhea).3,9-11   Non-functional WDNETs are tumors that  
do not secrete hormones or the products they secrete do not cau se a clinical syndrome;  
examples include pancreatic polypeptide, chromogranin A, ghreli n, neurotensin, subunits of  
chorionic gonadotropin, and neuron-specific enolase.11  Metastatic disease is a common  
presentation for the majority of patients with WDNETs, especial ly those with non-functioning  
tumors given the absence of clinical symptoms that would warran t earlier clinical evaluation.7 
Asymptomatic patients diagnosed with advanced, metastatic WDNET s are often monitored  
initially, however with time, often their disease will progress  and require treatment. The typi[INVESTIGATOR_605159] , symptoms from hormone  
secretion for functional tumors, high tumor burden, or progress ion of disease under observation.9 
Given the heterogeneous clinical presentations and complex spec trum of aggressiveness of  
WDNETs, their treatment is challenging, and requires multimodal ity management with surgeons,  
interventional radiologists, medical oncologists, endocrinologi sts and gastroenterologists. 
There are multiple systemic therapy options available for the t reatment of metastatic WDNETs.  
These systemic options include SSA, targeted agents, and sometimes (usually in the setting of  
grade transformation) cytotoxic chemotherapy. SSA is often the first choice for treatment, and  
there are currently two options (both listed on NCCN guidelines ): octreotide LAR or lanreotide. Of  
note, lanreotide is the only SSA that is approved by [CONTACT_605178]-functional gastroenteropancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs), based on  the results of the CLARINET  
study (see Section 3.2.2). However, it is believed that octreot ide LAR and lanreotide are  
biochemically similar, and at MSK, given the much higher retail  price/institutional drug cost of  
lanreotide (see Section 3.2.3), lanreotide is not routinely off ered to our patients. Lanreotide is  
currently available on the MSK formulary with restrictions ; specifically, use of lanreotide requires  
approval from the P&T Chair or designee, and is restricted to p atients receiving anticoagulation,  
or a personal history of bleeding from the intended injection s ite, or insufficient soft tissue mass. 
To date, no investigation has previously been undertaken to loo k at differences in one SSA   
versus the other. While it is believed that both octreotide LAR  and lanreotide are biochemically  
similar and likely offer similar control of disease, these drug s differ in terms of mode of  
administration, and it has been suggested that this difference may impact patient experience and  
drug preference. The purpose of this study is to investigate th e patient experience with these two  
SSA; we hypothesize that there is unlikely to be a meaningful d ifference, as octreotide LAR is  
administered IM,  and lanreotide is administered “deep subq.” H owever, if there is a meaningful  
difference in patient experience, with lanreotide being preferr ed by [CONTACT_1962], we believe it could  
justify the higher cost of this drug to the institution and imp act our use of lanreotide at MSK, when  
treating patients with WDNETs. We are limiting this study to pa tients with non-functional tumors to  
maintain a homogenous patient population, and to eliminate othe r biases that could impact patient  
experience. 
3.3 Somatostatin analog therapy  
 
Somatostatin and its synthetic analogs (i.e. octreotide and lan reotide) bind to G-protein couple  
receptors on the cell surface to exert their effects. There are  five known subtypes of somatostatin 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 17-422 A(6) 
Approval date: 20-Apr-2020 
Page 10of 28 
  
receptors, SST1-SST5, and binding of somatostatin to these rece ptors can inhibit the release of  
hormones and secretory proteins and also stall tumor growth, of fering cytostatic control. 
The majority of WDNETs express somatostatin receptors (most com monly SST2) on their surface  
and are octreotide avid on SSA scintigraphy (i.e. OctreoscanTM).12,[ADDRESS_801307] line, as they are well tolera ted, treat functional symptoms (in  
those tumors that are hormone secreting), and have been demonst rated to have an anti-  
proliferative, cytostatic effect on the growth of tumor. 
3.3.[ADDRESS_801308] study of SSA in patients with carcinoid  
syndrome, 25 patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors were tre ated with short-acting octreotide  
(150 mcg subq three times a day); 18/25 (72%) patients experien ced a decrease of 50% or more  
in their urinary 5-HIAA levels, and 7/24 (29%) patients who rep orted flushing experienced  
complete relief of treatment, while 4/25 (16%) patients who rep orted considerable diarrhea  
experienced complete relief. In many subsequent studies, both p artial and complete relief of  
carcinoid syndrome symptoms has been demonstrated in the majori ty of patients studied.14-[ADDRESS_801309] a more limited role in controlling their hormone - 
related symptoms. In particular, when initiating SSA therapy on  insulinomas, close monitoring of  
glucose levels is required, as there can be transient worsening  of hypoglycemia; hypoglycemia  
can occur as nearly half of insulinomas do not express SST2 and  SSA therapy can blunt a  
compensatory glucagon response.[ADDRESS_801310] a role in controlling tumor growth of non-functional as we ll as functional tumors. As  
previously discussed, observation alone is generally pursued fo r patients with asymptomatic,  
advanced, unresectable WDNETs and small volume disease, as dise ase may remain indolent for  
months to years; SSA therapy is subsequently initiated when the re is evidence of clinically  
meaningful tumor progression. 
The earliest studies investigating a cytostatic role for SSA in cluded patients with many types of  
NETs. In one phase II trial, 34 patients with advanced NETs wer e treated with octreotide as  
antineoplastic therapy after clear objective disease progressio n; with a median follow-up of 29  
months, the median survival for this patient population from th e start of octreotide therapy had not  
been reached.24 In this study, 17/34 (50%) patients had disease stabilization f or a minimum of two  
months based on CT imaging. In another prospective study, 21 pa tients with metastatic GEP-  
NETs were treated with short-acting octreotide 200 micrograms t hree times a day; no patients

Approval date: 20-Apr-[ADDRESS_801311] favorable response  was stability of disease in  
5/21 (24%) patients.[ADDRESS_801312] randomized data to support an antiproliferative role for octreotide in the treatment of  
NETs came from the phase III PROMID study; this study included only midgut NETs and not  
panNETs.26  In this study, 85 patients were randomized to either placebo or  octreotide LAR 30 mg  
IM every month until progression of disease or death. The prima ry endpoint was time to tumor  
progression (TTP), and the investigators observed a significant  difference in TTP in the octreotide  
LAR and placebo groups (14.3 months versus 6 months, p=0.000072 ). In clinical practice and by  
[CONTACT_94983], physicians were extrapolating the use of octre otide in midgut tumors to use in  
panNETs but no prospective randomized data exist.[ADDRESS_801313] of SSA in GEP- NETs.[28]   
In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study i n patients with low or intermediate  
grade, well or moderately differentiated NETs (45% panNETs), 20 4 patients were randomized to  
receive an extended-release aqueous-gel formulation of lanreoti de (Autogel) at a dose of 120 mg  
or placebo once every 28 days for 96 weeks; the primary endpoin t was progression-free survival  
(PFS), defined as time to disease progression or death. The aut hors observed that lanreotide was  
associated with significantly prolonged PFS in comparison to pl acebo (median not reached versus  
median of 18 months, p<0.001).There were no significant differe nces between the two groups in  
quality of life or overall survival. The most common adverse ev e n t  was diarrhea, which was more  
prevalent in patients receiving lanreotide (26% in the lanreoti de group and 9% in the placebo  
group). The CLARINET study confirmed that in comparison to plac ebo, lanreotide is safely  
tolerated and significantly prolongs PFS in patients with metas tatic NETs; based on these   
findings, lanreotide is the only SSA that is FDA-approved for t umor control in non-functional 
GEP-NETs. 
 
Of note, while lanreotide is the only SSA FDA approved for cyto static tumor control in the  
treatment of NETs (given the trial design of CLARINET and PROMI D),  octreotide LAR is believed  
to have similar efficacy in controlling tumor growth based on t he available data and identical  
mechanism of action of the two drugs.28  Per NCCN guidelines, either octreotide LAR or lanreotide  
are listed as treatment options for cytostatic control of octre otide avid disease. 
3.3.3 Octreotide LAR vs lanreotide: similarities and differences  
 
Both octreotide LAR and lanreotide are [ADDRESS_801314] many similarities biochemically, they d iffer in three key ways:  
preparation, mode of administration, and cost, which may influe nce patient experience and  
preference for drug.

the very high volume of RN/nurse-only visits for SSA injections  in our clinics providing care to   
NET patients, and the time requirements necessary to prepare oc treotide LAR injections in  
specific, we now have a weekly clinic led by [CONTACT_605179]. The amount of time spent by [CONTACT_605180] r injection administration has never  
been quantified in a prospective fashion. 
Mode of administration: Octreotide LAR is administered IM while lanreotide is administered deep  
subq . It has been reported that up to 50% of patients receive injec tion site pain with octreotide  
LAR (with up to 5% developi[INVESTIGATOR_605160]). [Reference: Octreotide LAR drug  
manual - [COMPANY_001]] In comparison, about 20% of patients receivi ng lanreotide report injection site  
pain.[Reference: Lanreotide drug manual - Ipsen] This “injectio n site pain” has never been  
quantified from the patient’s perspective. However, on this lim ited data, it is assumed that  
lanreotide is less painful for patients, and may be the preferr ed SSA by [CONTACT_1962]; these  
assumptions have not been studied to date. 
Cost: There is also a cost difference between octreotide LAR an d lanreotide, with an average  
sales price (as of October 2016) of approximat ely $3362 each mo nth for a typi[INVESTIGATOR_605161] (20 mg) and $6157 each month for a typi[INVESTIGATOR_605162] (120  
mg).[Reference: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Manu facturer reporting of Average  
Sales Price data]. Given the results of CLARINET, over the peri od of time a patient may be on  
lanreotide (>2 years), this cost differential in retail price o f lanreotide could easily exceed $67,[ADDRESS_801316]   
soared from approximately $170 per  month of therapy in the 1970 s, to $10,000 per month as of 
2014.29  Through prior investigation, it has been shown that these highe r drug costs can result in  
decreased adherence, increased bankruptcy, as well as personal sacrifice.30,31(National Survey of  
Households affected by [CONTACT_495752]) Looking specifically in advanced  cancer patients, it has been  
demonstrated that 1 in 4 patients abandoned their cancer drugs when out-of-pocket costs  
exceeded $500 – a “ side effect” of cancer treatment the American Society of Clinical Oncology  
(ASCO) has termed “financial toxicity.” 
In prior experience at MSK, when two drugs have demonstrable eq ual efficacy but real cost  
differences (for example in colorectal cancer: ziv-aflibercept and bevacizumab, cetuximab and  
panitumumab), we have recognized and acknowledged that there ar e not two equivalent  
regimens (i.e. offering all options and leaving the decision of  which drug to use to the treating  
physician); rather, we have recognized there is really only one  appropriate regimen, and neither  
ziv-aflibercept nor cetuximab are on our formulary and availabl e for use by [CONTACT_605181]. 
Similarly, at this time, in an effort to control and limit cost s, octreotide LAR is available on MSK

opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], an improvement in patient experience could change the value of lanreotide (if lanreotide  
is in fact preferred by [CONTACT_539230]), and impact our decision to use lanreotide without restrictions  
at MSK. For this reason, we have developed this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], to  evaluate the question “does  
patient experience impact choice for a particular SSA?” Given o ur belief that there is minimal  
difference in patient experience between an IM and deep s ubq injection, we hypothesize that  
there will not be a difference in patient experience between th e two SSA to justify our inclusion of  
lanreotide onto the MSK formulary without restrictions. 
In order to answer the above question and study our hypothesis,  this pi[INVESTIGATOR_605163], to qu antify the toxicity that may impact  
experience and drive patient drug preference. Through a questio nnaire we have developed  
specific for this study (Appendix C), as there are no available  validated questionnaires, patients  
will indicate their level of preference for these injections. I n addition, we will study “financial  
toxicity,” and collect data on patient willingness to pay for a  preferred drug. 
Ultimately, we believe that the findings from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_605164]. The data collected

4.3 Intervention  
 
This will be a two-arm randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 50 patients wh o will be randomized to  
receive octreotide LAR followed by [CONTACT_605182] (n=25) or lanreot ide followed by [CONTACT_605183] (n=25). Patients presenting with advanced WDNETs, recommend ed to begin SSA  
therapy by [CONTACT_30155], will be eligible to participate. Pat ients will receive a total of 6  
months of SSA therapy on trial, three octreotide LAR injections  and three lanreotide  
injections; the injections will be separated by 28 (+/- 3) days . For the purposes of this  
study, these drugs will be referred to as “drug A” (drug given in months 1 to 3) and “drug  
B” (drug given in months 4 to 6). Our nursing staff will admini ster all injections in the  
outpatient clinic setting; octreotide LAR will be manually prep ped in clinic just prior to  
injection, and lanreotide will be sent from pharmacy to clinic in a prefilled syringe. 
On day of trial enrollment, after signing informed consent, pat ients will complete a baseline  
questionnaire (Appendix A). This baseline questionnaire w ill assess financial burden of  
health care, and whether a patie nt is concerned, prior to beginning any treatment, about  
pain or discomfort with the SSA injection. 
The study participation period for each patient is 6 months fro m the date of beginning  
treatment and includes 4 time periods (pre-treatment evaluation  on day of protocol  
enrollment, monthly injections of drug A for three months, mont hly injections of drug B for  
three months, and an end of study evaluation after injection #6  at which time a preference  
questionnaire will be completed).  At the first three visits wh en patients receive drug A, a  
pain score will be collected (0 to 10 numeric scale). Please re fer to Appendix B for the  
post-treatment questio nnaire that patients will complete immedi ately after injection, and to  
Appendix D for the diary patients w ill complete at home prior to returning for their next  
injection. As is standard practice at our institution, prior to  every SSA injection, a baseline  
pain score using this same scale will be obtained by [CONTACT_605184].  
The end of study preference questionnaire (A ppendix C) w ill evaluate which drug patients  
preferred and how much they preferred a certain drug. The prefe rence questionnaire will  
also evaluate the topic of financial burden and willingness to pay, asking patients to  
quantify how much extra money per injection they believe their preferred drug is worth.

9.1 PRIMARY OUTCOMES  
 
The following are tests and/or measures to be carried out durin g this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]:  
For patients: 
1. Baseline questionnaire: This questionnaire is provided in Appendix A and w ill be 
completed in clinic by [CONTACT_605189]. This questionnaire assess es financial burden of  
health care, and whether a patient is concerned, prior to begin ning any treatment,  
about pain or discomfort with the SSA injection. 
 
2. Post-treatment questionnaire (after the first 3 injections): Patients will rate, on a  
numeric scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being “No pain” to 10 being “W orst pain ever” the pain  
or discomfort experienced with the SSA injection (Appendix B). Patients will rate their  
pain following injection by [CONTACT_605190]. 
 
3. Pain Score Diary: Patients will rate, on a numeric scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being  “No 
pain” to 10 being “Worst pain ever” the pain or discomfort expe rienced with the SSA  
injection (Appendix D). Patients w ill rate their pain at home each day prior to returning  
to clinic for their next injection. 
 
4. Preference questionnaire: This questionnaire is provided in A ppendix C. This  
questionnaire asks 2 questions to evaluate level of preference for drug A or B, and  
how much extra money per injection a patient feels the preferre d drug would be worth.

Page 19of 28 
  
For nursing: 
 
1.   Time for injection preparation: Nurses will use a stopwatch to measure the amount  
time they spend preparing octreotide LAR and lanreotide injecti ons. Start time will be  
the time the RN opens the package of the drug; octreotide LAR i njections will be  
prepared in the room while the patient is undergoing nursing as sessment. The end   
time will be as soon as the nurse discards the needle in the sh arps container. A secure  
data spreadsheet will be maintained on the MSK server to collec t this information for  
each monthly injection for enrolled patients. Coordination of t his study objective will be  
by [CONTACT_605191], RN, Co-PI [INVESTIGATOR_47472]. 
 
 
 
10.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY  
 
In the absence of serious toxicity or complications, all patien ts will continue on study for 6 months  
(through completion of post-treatment questionnaire. In the abs ence of adverse event(s), patients  
may continue on study until one of the following criteria appli es: 
 
 Progression of disease warranting switch off of SSA therapy 
 Development of an intercurrent medical condition or need for co ncomitant treatment that  
precludes further participation in the trial 
 Unacceptable toxicity or any adverse event that precludes furth er participation in the trial 
 The investigator removes the patient from the trial in the best  interests of the patient 
 Patient death 
 Study completion or discontinuation for any reason 
 Patient withdraws consent to continued participation in the tri al or is lost to follow up 
 
If consent is withdrawn, the subject can continue to receive SS A therapy off of protocol under the  
care of his/her treating physician, however the subject will no t receive any further study  
observation.

Approval date: 20-Apr-[ADDRESS_801323] to accrue 2-3 patients per month, with accrual completed  in 24 months. This study is a  
two-arm randomized design, in which patients will be randomized  to the order in which they 
receive octreotide LAR and lanreotide in six separate monthly i njections (randomization described  
in section 12.2). 
Twenty-five patients will receive three monthly injections of o ctreotide LAR followed by [CONTACT_605192], and 25 patients will receive three monthly injections of lanreotide  
followed by [CONTACT_605193]. The stu dy participation period for each  
patient is 6 months from the date of beginning treatment and includes 4 time periods (pre-  
treatment evaluation on day of protocol enrollment, monthly inj ections of drug A for three months,  
monthly injections of drug B for three months, and an end of st udy evaluation after injection #6 at  
which time the preference questionnaire will be completed). Inj ection site pain will be assessed  
after each of the first 3 injections (with drug A) using a nume ric 0 to 10 pain scale. For the primary  
objective of this study, all patients are expected to be includ ed (i.e. all patients are expected to  
have data for the first 3 injections). In the unlikely event th at patients drop-out before we get the  
data for the entire 6 months of this protocol, any patients tha t are removed will not be evaluable   
for our secondary objectives. 
Primary objective: To compare injection site pain experienced with octreotide LAR and 
lanreotide. 
 
Primary endpoint: Comparison of mean pain score over the first three injections o f either  
octreotide LAR or lanreotide., With [ADDRESS_801324] 80%  
power to detect a mean score difference of 1.[ADDRESS_801325] will be used to compare the two groups in terms o f their pain scores averaged over  
the 3 time-points. To account for correlation between the pain scores obtained after injections 1,   
2, and 3, as a secondary analysis for the primary objective, re peated measures ANCOVA  
(adjusting for the baseline pain score) and/or Friedman’s test will also be employed. In this study,  
mean pain score will be calculated among all non-missing data. 
 
Secondary objecti ves: 
 
1. To evaluate if patients have a preference for octreotide LAR or  lanreotide. 
 
2. To evaluate patient willingness to pay for preferred SSA therap y.

3. To quantify amount of time spent by [CONTACT_605194]. 
 
 
Secondary endpoints:  
 
1. Patient-reported preference of octreotide LAR versus lanreotide  assessed after  
six months of therapy by [CONTACT_447]-treatment questionnaire (Appendix  C). Patients  
will be asked their level of preference for either drug A or B with a Likert scale  
(i.e. no preference for one drug over the other, mild preferenc e for drug A,  
strong preference for drug A, mild preference for drug B, stron g preference for  
drug B). Preference of one drug over the other will be summariz ed 
descriptively. 
 
2. Patient willingness to pay extra for preferred therapy measured  in question  
format in the preference questionnaire (7 choices: $0, $1-50, $ 51-100, $101-  
200, $201-500, $501-1000, more than $1000). We w ill summarize patient  
willingness to pay (how much extra money per injection they bel ieve the  
preferred drug is worth) using descriptive statistics after rev iew of the answers  
provided in the preference questionnaire. We will use this data  to evaluate  
whether or not the level of preference has a relationship to th e amount of  
money people are willing to pay for a preferred therapy. This r elationship will be  
assessed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Due t o small sample  
sizes this analysis is exploratory in nature. 
 
3. Measurement of time nurses spend preparing octreotide LAR injec tions in  
clinic. We will summarize the average (with range) of time spen t preparing  
either octreotide LAR or lanreotide injections for the patients  included in this  
study.

(PPR) system, and randomized to order octreotide LAR lanreotide (n=25) or lanreotide 
octreotide LAR (n=25) using the Clinical Research Database (CRD Bi-Multicenter). If a 
patient is pending registration based on limited available info rmation, randomization will  
occur after all completed documentation is received. A patient may be registered as  
pending for up to 30 days from the initial registration submiss ion to PPR. Randomization  
will be completed at MSKCC and accomplis hed by [CONTACT_605196] r andom permutated  
block. Since this is an unblinded study, all study investigator s may view randomization in  
the CRDBi-Multicenter. 
13.1 DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUES  
 
A Research Study Assistant (RSA) will be assigned to the study.  The responsibilities of the  
RSA include project compliance, data collection, abstraction an d entry, data reporting,  
regulatory monitoring, problem resolution and prioritization, a nd coordinate the activities of  
the protocol study team. 
 
The data collected for this study will be entered into a secure  database (Clinical Research  
Database, CRDB). Source documentation will be available to supp ort the computerized  
patient record. 
 
13.2 Quality Assurance  
 
Weekly registration reports will be g enerated to monitor patient accruals and completeness  
of registration data. Routine data quality reports will be gene rated to assess missing data  
and inconsistencies. Accrual rates and extent, and accuracy of evaluations and follow-up  
will be monitored periodically throug hout the study period and potential problems will be  
brought to the attention of the study team for discussion and a ction. 
 
Random-sample data quality and protocol compliance audits w ill be conducted by [CONTACT_209870], at a minimum of two times per year, more frequently if in dicated.

Benefits: While on study, participating patients may identify a  more preferable SSA drug  
and have the opportunity to receive this drug moving forward. I t is also possible that from  
the results of this  pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will be able to characteri ze, in broader terms, patient  
preference for SSA therapy. This information may guide both pat ients and clinicians in the  
future when they are making a similar therapy decision (i.e. wh ether to begin octreotide LAR  
or lanreotide when needing to start a SSA). 
Risks: N one beyond side effects/toxicities associated with SSA, which are s tandard-of-care  
therapy for WDNETs. 
Costs: The patient will be responsi ble for the costs of standar d medical care, including all  
drug and drug administration fees and all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], eve n for complications of  
treatment. Patients will be notified of the co-pay  associated with octreotide LAR and  
lanreotide and will have this information available prior to si gning consent to this trial, as  
patients will have varying co-pays for these drugs that may imp act their decision to enroll  
on this trial. 
 
Incentives:  No incentives will be offered to patients/subjects  for participation in the study. 
 
Alternatives/options for treatm ent: Patients may be eligible fo r other investigational studies,  
standard treatment options (including SSA off of trial), or foc us on palliative care options.

14.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting  
 
 
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following outcomes: 
 Death 
 A life-threatening adverse event 
 An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] p rolongation of existing  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruptio n of the ability to conduct  
normal life functions 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be  life threatening, or  
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based u pon medical  
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may re quire medical or  
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81539] a planned procedure/disease treatm ent is not considered an  
SAE. 
 
SAE r eporting is required as soon as the participant signs consent. SAE reporting is  
required for 30-days after the participant’s last investigation al treatment or intervention.  
Any events that occur after the 30-day period and that are at l east possibly related to  
protocol treatment must be reported. 
 
If an SAE r equires submission to the IRB office per IRB SOP RR- 408 ‘R eporting of Serious 
Adverse Events’, the SAE report must be sent to the IRB within 5 calendar days of           
the event. The IRB requires a Clinical Research Dat abase (CRDB) SAE report be  
submitted electronically to the SAE Office as follows: 
For IND/IDE trials: Reports that include a Grade 5 SAE should b e sent to   
[EMAIL_440] .  All other reports should be sent to [EMAIL_2141] . 
 
For all other trials: Reports that include a Grade 5 SAE should  be sent to   
[EMAIL_440] .  All other reports should be sent to [EMAIL_203] . 
 
The report should contain the following information:  
Fields populated from CRDB: 
 Subject’s initials 
 Medical record number 
 Disease/histology (if applicable) 
 Protocol number and title

 The date the adverse event occurred 
 The adverse event 
 The grade of the event 
 Relationship of the adverse event to the treatment (drug, devic e, or intervention) 
 If the AE was expected 
 The severity of the AE 
 The intervention 
 Detailed text that includes the following 
o A explanation of how the AE was handled 
o A description of the subject’s condition 
o Indication if the subject remains on the study 
 If an amendment will need to be made to the protocol and/or consent form 
 If the SAE is an Unanticipated Problem 
The PI’s signature [CONTACT_605200] t he completed report.  
For IND/IDE protocols: 
The CRDB SAE report should be completed as per above instructions.  If a ppropriate, the  
report will be forwarded to the FDA by [CONTACT_193094].

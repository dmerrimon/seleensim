Document Version Date Summary of Changes and Rationale
Amendment 5 29May 2019 To address the recommendations made by  
[CONTACT_2165] (FDA) 
following review of the protocol (ordered 
as they  first appear in the protocol) : 
1.Details of the randomization plan have 
been added in Section 4.3 
Randomization Criteria to clarify  that 
the randomization will be administered 
using center -based permuted blocks.
2.
In Section 9.2.1, the definition of Full 
Analy sis Set (FAS) was clari fied and 
details w ere added on major protocol 
violations that would preclude 
inclusion in the Per Protocol Anal ysis 
Set (PPAS).
3.Added a summary  of the proposed 
sensitivity  anal yses for the co -primary  
endpoints in Section 9.2.[ADDRESS_531129] been incorporated 
as follows: 
1.Since atopic dermatitis has a natural 
history  of chronic remissions and 
flares, subjects may  be inappropriatel y
disqualified during periods of 
remission, and may  become eligibl e 
when re -screened during a flare 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  For subjects who are 
screen -failure due to not meeting the 
disease severity  inclusion criteria, 
re-screening may  be considered.  This 
re-screening should onl y occur after 
discussion with [COMPANY_007] Medical Monitor 
(or designee) . The following sections 
of the protocol are affected: Protocol 
Summary , Study  Design and Section 3,

Page 18PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Background an d Rationale:
Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a common, chronic, inflammatory
skin disorder characterized by [CONTACT_74053], intense pruritus, and a general deterioration
in quality of life.  Over the past 50 years, AD has become more prevalent, especiall y in 
industrialized, temperate countries such as the [LOCATION_002] (US).1,[ADDRESS_531147] 
common, chronic, relapsing childhood derm
atoses, impacting 15 -30% of all children in the 
US and many  have disease that persists into adulthood with a lifetime prevalence of those 
affected in childhood reported to be 34%.3  Earlier reports indicated tha t, in up to 70% of 
cases, the disease greatl y improves or resolves b y late childhood, however more recent 
findings suggest that disease activit y remains manifest for a prolonged period of time.  Based 
on a total of 7157 patients enrolled in the Pediatric E czema Elective Registry  (PEER) study , 
comprising a total of 22,[ADDRESS_531148] well into the second decade of life and likely  longer.4  At ever y age, more 
than 80% of PEER study subjects had s ymptoms of AD and/or were using medication to treat 
their AD.
Of the currentl y available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], none offers a cure; therefore, the main aims of existing 
treatments are to reduce the occurrence of acute f lares, to increase the time between relapses, 
and to reduce pruritus and the resulting sleep disturbance.5,6
Non-
medicated topi[INVESTIGATOR_420900].  Medi cated t opi[INVESTIGATOR_420901] (TCS) (eg, betamethasone, clobetasol,
fluocinonide), topi[INVESTIGATOR_22726] (TCI) (eg, pi[INVESTIGATOR_031], tacrolimus), and coal 
tarpreparations.  TCS are limited in terms o f the treatment duration (eg, corticosteroid use is 
limited to 2 to 4 weeks) and the body region of treatment, due to consistent skin toxicities, as 
well as having risks associated with their broad immunosuppressive actions.   TCI  have a 
limited role as a s
econd -line treatment, due to their limitations in the duration and the bod y 
region of treatment, inhibition of tumor surveillance in the skin, and safet y concerns with 
malignancies.  Crisaborole was approved as a medicated topi[INVESTIGATOR_420902] 2016 
by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for use in patients with mild to moderate AD.  
Additional treatments generall y reserved for severe AD include phototherapy (eg, ultraviolet 
A
light [UVA] with or without psoralen, ultraviolet B light [UVB] narrowba nd or 
broadband) and s ystemic agents (eg, corticosteroids, cy closporine, recombinant interferon 
gamma (IFN -), mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate [MTX], azathioprine, intravenous
immunoglobulin).7
There are a l imited number of approved s ystemic treatments for moderate to severe AD and 
in the [LOCATION_003], the only  approved s ystemic drugs are corticosteroids and dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458].  
Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], an injectable human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin (IL) - 4 and -13,
was appro ved by  [CONTACT_69391] 2017 and received marketing authorization in Europe in 
September 2017, for the treatment of moderate to severe AD.  Treatment with sy stemic 
corticosteroids has known and well documented adverse effects.
  Treatment with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420903], allergic reactions, ey e and ey elid inflammations and 
cold sores.  Another potential limitation of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420904]-04965842
B7451029
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019
Page 19of antidrug antibodies, which may  result in loss of efficacy  over time and the development of 
safet y concerns such as serum sickness -like reactions.   Furthermore, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420905], which may  not be a method of administration tolerated well by  
[CONTACT_16983].  During a 1
-year, randomized, double -blinded study  with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], in the 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg every 2 weeks (marketed maintenance dose) plus TCS group, the 
estimated difference from placebo of the Investigator's Global Assessment ( IGA)response 
rate and Eczema Area and Severity  Index ( EASI )-75 response rate w ere 26% and 46%, 
respectivel y.  The placebo response rate for IGA and EASI -75 was 12% and 23%, 
respectivel y
.[ADDRESS_531149] the potential risk of injection site reactions.  Unlike dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], PF - 04965842 
is a small molecule and there is no anticipated immunogenicit y for PF -04965842, a nd so it is 
unlikely  to generate antidrug antibodies.
Key cytokines implicated in the pathophy siology of AD include IL-4,IL-5,IL-13,IL-31,
and IFN -, and require Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) for signal transduction; this suggests that 
selective JAK1 inhibitors that modulate the activity ofthese cytokines represent a 
compelling approach to the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases such as AD.8
PF-04965842 is an orall y bioavailable small molecule that selectivel y inhibits JAK1 by  
[CONTACT_74055] (ATP) binding site.  PF -[ADDRESS_531150] other kinases: 28- fold selectivity over JAK2, >340 -fold over JAK3

-fold over tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), as well as a good selectivit yprofile over the 
broader range of human kinases. The selective inhibition of JAK1 will lead to modulation of 
multiple cy tokine pathway s involved in the pathophy siology of AD, including
IL-4,IL-5,IL-13, IL -31 and IFN -.  Data from a Pha se2b proof of concept (POC) study  
(B7451006) that evaluated subjects with moderate to severe AD have shown positive 
efficacy , as well as an acceptable safet y profile, sufficient to support further clinical 
development in a larger Phase 3 program.

Page 23Study Design
This is a randomized, double -blind, double -dummy , placebo -controlled, parallel -group, 
multi-center study  to assess the efficacy  and safety  of PF -04965842 100 mg or 200 mgQD 
and dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (as per label) compared with placebo in adult subjects on background topi[INVESTIGATOR_420912] y, with moderate to severe AD.   This study  will provide a direct comparison of both 
doses of PF -[ADDRESS_531151] meet the eligibility  criteria at 
both screening and baseline.  In addition, subjects are required to use non -medicated topi[INVESTIGATOR_420912] y (ie, emollients) at least twice dail y for the last [ADDRESS_531152] also be 
willing and able to use standardized background topi[INVESTIGATOR_52201] y, as per protocol guidelines, 
throughout the duration of the study .  Subjects may  be re -screened once if they  fail the 
screening evaluation for reasons related to incidental transit ory conditions .  Subjects for 
whom screen failure is related to failing the dise ase severit y (including extent of disease) 
inclusion criterion and who subsequently  experience worsening AD, which in the 
investigator’s judgement would make them eligible for participation, may  be considered for 
re-screening. Such cases should be discussed with the [COMPANY_007] Medical Monitor (or designee)
to determine if re -
screening is appropriate.
Subjects who continue to meet eligibility  criteria at baseline will undergo Day 1 assessments 
and be randomized in a 4:4:4:1:1 ratio to receive 10 0mg or 200 mg of PF -04965842 QD 
with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] -matching placebo administered every  other week, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg 
administered every other w eek (with a loading dose of 600 mg at baseline) with 
PF-04965842-matching placebo administered QD, or one of [ADDRESS_531153].   At Week 16 in the treatment period, all 

PF-04965842

Page 24subjects will cease injectable dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420913].  This is to facilitate the 
washout of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (for a total of 6 weeks; as the final dose of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420914] W eek14) prior to eligible subjects entering the long- term 
extension study , in which all subjects will receive PF -[ADDRESS_531154] the 
option to enter a long -term extension (LTE) study, B7451015, in which all subjects will 
receive PF -04965842 active treatment.  Subjects discontinuing early  from treatment, or who 
are otherwise i neligible for the LTE study , will undergo a 4- week follow -up period in study  
B7451029.

Statistical Methods
A total sample of 700 subjects, with 200 randomized to PF -04965842 200 m g QD, 
200subjects randomized to PF -04965842 100 mg QD, 200 subjects randomized to 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24767] 50 subjects each randomized to two sequences of matching placebo for 
16weeks followed b y (a) PF -04965842 100 mg QD and by  (b) PF -04965842 200 mgQD 
(4:4:4:1:1 randomization) is planned.  The two placebo sequences will be combined for 
purposes of analy ses at all visits up to and including Week 16, which will result in a 
2:2:2:[ADDRESS_531156] 96% power to detect a difference of at 
least 20% in IGA response rate between either dose of PF
-04965842 and placebo, assuming 
the placebo response rate is 12% at Week 12.  This will also provide at least 99% power to 
detect a difference of at least 30% in EASI -75 response rate between eithe r dose of 
PF-04965842 and placebo, assuming the placebo response rate is 23% at Week 12.
Both co -primary  endpoints must achieve statistical significance to meet the primary  
objective.
In addition, this sample size will also provide at least 92% power to de tect a difference of at 
least 
15% in the proportion of subjects with a 4points improvement in the severit y of 
Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS )between PF -04965842 and dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], assuming the 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420915] 18% at Week 2.
The T ype-I error rate is set at 5% (two -sided).  The family wise Ty pe-I error rate (for testing 
the co- primary  and key  secondary  endpoints) will be strongl y controlled at 5% using a 
closed-testing method based on a sequential, iterative Bonferroni- type approach.  This is 
described in further detail in Section 9.2.2 of the protocol and in the statistical anal ysis plan 
(SAP).
The study  has been sized to help gain sufficient safety  data to be able to effectivel y evaluate 
the benefit -risk of PF -04965842 in conjunction with the other studies in the clinical 
development program, therefore the power for the co
-primary  endpoints is relatively  high.   
This sample size will also help ensure adequate power is maintained for testing all the 
co-primary  and key  secondary  endpoints for both doses of PF -04965842 via the multiple 
testing procedure.
For analy sis of the co- primary  endpoints, the (Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel) test adjusted by  
[CONTACT_420980] y group (moderate and severe) will be use d.  If a subject withdraws 
from the study , then this subject will be counted as a non-responder for endpoints after 
withdrawal. 

PF-[ADDRESS_531157] model with repeated measures (MMRM) will be 
used.  This model will include the factors (fixed effects) for treatment group, disease severity  
group, visit, treatment -by-visit interaction, and relevant baseline value.  Within the 
framework of MMRM, the treatment at each time point will be derived from the MMRM 
model.
All subjects who receive investigational product (safet y population) will be included in the 
safet y analyses.  All the safet y data will be summarized descriptively through appropriate 
data tabulations, descriptive statistics, categorical summaries, and graphical presentations.

T-SPOT®.TBtest should be considered exclusionary. If the test results are  indeterminate, the test should be repeated.  If the result of the repeat test is 
indeterminate, subjects may be screened using the Mantoux/[COMPANY_003] ski n test with [COMPANY_007] Medical Monitor approval.  See Section 7.3.[ADDRESS_531165] injection will be administered by [CONTACT_420981]/trainer and used to train the subject on correct inje ction technique.  The second 
injection will be administered by [CONTACT_423] (or caregiver, if  applicable) under observation of the unblinded administrator/t rainer.
s. When not at the site, subjects (and caregiver, if applicable) will be encouraged to administer investigational product in the  morning whenever possible; 
however, on study visit days, subjects (and caregiver, if applic able) are to be instructed to refrain from dosing at home, and are to administer investigational 
product in the clinic under observation.  If any issues with in jection technique are observed, the unblinded administrator/tra iner must retrain the subject (or 
caregiver, if applicable) appropriately.
t. Subjects who complete EOT will be assessed for eligibility fo r participation in long-term extension study B7451015 as noted in Section 6.2.[ADDRESS_531166]'s primary care physician (PCP)  should be informed, and 
the subject referred to a mental health professional, either by  [CONTACT_22834].
 
 
 
w. Pruritus and Symptoms Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (PSAAD ) will be conducted to assess the severity and frequency of pru ritus, symptoms and sleep 
and collected daily in a subject eDiary during the screening pe riod and from Day 1 through the End of Study visit in selected c ountries (See Section 7.10.8 ).  
At the Screening visit, site staff will dispense the eDiary and  review instructions for completion of the subject eDiary for t he PSAAD questionnaire.  
Subjects will be asked to record their assessment in their eDia ry once a day before taking the investigational product.  At ev ery visit, the study coordinator 
will review the eDiary for completeness and counsel the subject  on how to complete the items in the daily eDiary, if needed.
 
y. The contraception check is an opportunity to confirm that con traception, if required, is used consistently and correctly.
z. A serum sample will be collected at baseline but analyzed onl y if the subject has a suspected viral reactivation. 
aa. For China, Republic of Korea, and Taiwan only: Subjects who a re HBsAg negative, HBcAb positive, and HBsAb positive at Screen ing will have reflex 
testing for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) DNA.  Subjects who have HBV  DNA above the lower limit of quantification (LLQ) are excluded. S ubjects who have 
HBV DNA negative or below LLQ may be randomized, but will have HBV DNA testing repeated at Week 12 and Week 20 End of Treatment (EOT) visit, 
or Early Termination (ET) visit, whichever is sooner (See Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  A single HBV DNA test result above the LLQ for a subject re quires immediate 
and permanent discontinuation from treatment.  Refer to Section 6.4 .  For Japan only: In addition to HBsAg and HBcAb, HBsAb testin g will be performed at 
Screening for all subjects rather than as a reflex test. Subjec ts with negative results for HBsAg, HBcAb and HBsAb may be elig ible. Subjects who are 
HBsAg negative, HBcAb negative and HBsAb positive and provide d ocumentation of prior HBV vaccination may be eligible and will n ot require HBV 
DNA monitoring during the study. Subjects who are HBsAg negativ e, HBcAb negative and HBsAb positive without documentation of p rior HBV 
vaccination AND subjects who are HBsAg negative, HBcAb positive , and HBsAb positive at screening will have reflex testing for H BV DNA.  Subjects 
who are HBV DNA negative or below LLQ may be randomized but wil l have HBV DNA repeated at Week 12 and Week 20 End of Treatment ( EOT) visit, 
or Early Termination (ET) visit, whichever is sooner (See Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  A single HBV DNA test result above the LLQ for a subject re quires immediate

1.1.Mechanism of Action/Indication
PF-04965842 isaJanus kinase 1(JAK1) inhibitor that is being investigated as a treatme nt for 
patients with Atopic Dermatitis (AD). 
The Janus kinase (JAK) family , including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and ty rosine kinase 2 (TYK2), 
is a group of cy toplasmic ty rosine kinases that mediate signal transduction via interactions 
with Ty pe1 and Ty pe2 cytokine receptors critical for leukocy te activation, proliferation, 
survival and function.  Cy tokine receptors demonstrate restricted association with JAKs such 
that different receptors or receptor classes preferentially  utilize a given JAK dimer or trimer 
combination to transduce their signal.  JAK1 pairs with JAK3 to mediate -common cy tokine 
signaling and also with JAK2 or TYK2 to transmit the signals of additional cy tokines 
important in inflammation and immune responses including interleukin (IL) -4, -5, -6, -13,
-
21, -31, interferon gamma (IFN- ), and interferon alpha (IFN -).  JAK2 homodimers are 
critical for the signaling of hematopoietic cy tokines and hormones including ery thropoietin 
(EPO), thrombopoietin (TPO), IL
-3, granulocy te-macrophage colon y-stimulating factor 
(GM -CSF) and prolactin.
Key cytokines implicated in the pathophy siology of AD include IL-4,IL-5,IL-13,IL-31,
and IFN -,andrequire JAK1 for signal transduction; this suggests that selective JAK1 
inhibitors that modulate the activity ofthesecytokines represent a compelling approach to 
the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases such as AD.9
IL-12 and IL -23 are dependent on TYK2 and JAK2 for transmitting their signals.  Following 
cytokine activat ion, receptor -associated JAKs are phosphory lated and in turn phosphory late 
specific sites on the receptor intracellular domain.  Phosphory lation of specific sites on the 
intracellular domain of the receptor allows for the recruitment of signal transducers and 
activators of transcription (STATs) that can subsequently  be phosphory lated by  [CONTACT_74061].  
Phosphory lated STAT molecules are released from the receptor, translocate to the nucleus 
where they  bind to specific sites on the deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) a nd regu late gene 
transcription.

AD have shown positive efficacy , as well as an acceptable safet y profile, sufficient to support 
further clinica l development in a larger Phase 3 program.

1.2.1. Drug Development and Rationale
PF-04965842 is being developed as an oral treatment for patients with moderate to severe 
AD based on its mechanism of action, and the clinical results obtain ed in Phase 1 and 
Phase 2 studies.  The clinical development program for PF -04965842 includes healthy  
volunteers, subjects with psoriasi s and subjects with AD.

1.2.2. Atopic Dermatitis
Atopic dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema, is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin 
disorder characterized by [CONTACT_74053], intense pruritus, and a general deterioration in 
the quality  of life.  Over the past [ADDRESS_531169] common, 
chronic, relapsing childhood dermatoses, impacting 15 -30% of all children in the US and 
many  have disease that persists into adulthood 
with a lifetime prevalence of those affected in 
childhood reported to be 34%.3  Earlier reports indicated that, in up to 70% of cases, the 
disease greatly  improves or resolves by  [CONTACT_74054], however more recent findings suggest 
that disease a ctivity  remains manifest for a prolonged period of time.  Based on a total of 
7157 patients enrolled in the Pediatric Eczema Elective Registry  (PEER) study , comprising a 
total of 22,[ADDRESS_531170] well into the second decade of life and likely  longer.4  At every  age, more than 80% of 
PEER study  subjects had sy mptoms of AD and/or were using medication to treat their AD.  
In 833 AD patients who we re aged 20 years or older when they  visited the clinic and 45 years 
or older when they  responded to a follow
-up questionnaire, 59% responded that they  had 
defined persistent AD at some time during the last [ADDRESS_531171] a continued decrease in 
prevalence with older age.11  Adult- onset AD does also occur, though it is less common.  The 
prevalence of AD in adults is estimated to be 10 %.12Recent studies have indicated that 
adults with AD are more likely  to smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, and have a sedentary  
lifesty le, potentiall y associated with increased co morbidities, such as asthma and 
cardiovascular disease.[ADDRESS_531172] been associated with the Ty pe2 helper T cell (TH2) phenoty pe, 
showing dominance of IL -4, -5, -13, and - 31 secretion.8,14,15Recent research showed that a 
small increase of Ty pe1 helper T cell (TH1)- associated genes has been also detected in acute 
phase.[ADDRESS_531173] the development of atopic skin lesions, chronic 
lesions show either the coexistence of both IL -
4-producing TH2 and IFN--producing TH1 
cells or TH1 
dominance.[ADDRESS_531174] had AD 
chronicall y or intermittently  since chil dhood.  Recent evidence also supports IL -31’s role in 
pruritus and inflammation in AD.8,15
Non-
medicated topi[INVESTIGATOR_420900].  Medicated t opi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_420924] (eg, betamethasone, clobetasol, fluocinonide), TCI 
(eg,pi[INVESTIGATOR_031], tacrolimus), and coal tar preparations.  TCS are limited in terms of the 
treatment duration (eg, corticosteroid use is limited to 2 to 4 weeks ) and the body  region of 
treatment, due to consistent skin toxicities, as well as having risks associated with their broad 
immunosuppressive actions. TCI have a limited role as a second line treatment, due to their 
limitations in terms of the duration of treatment and the body  region of treatment, inhibition 
of tumor surveillance in the skin, and safety  concerns with malignancies.  Crisaborole was 
approved as a medicated topi[INVESTIGATOR_420925] 2016 by  [CONTACT_420982].  Additional treatments generall y reserved for severe AD include 
phototherap y (eg, ultraviolet Alight [UVA] with or without psoralen, ultraviolet Blight 
[UVB] narrowband or broadband) and s ystemic agents (eg, corticosteroids, cy closporine, 
recombinant IFN-, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate [MTX], azathioprine, intravenous 
immunoglobulin).4  Of the currently  available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], none offers a cure; therefore, the 
main aims of existing treatments are to re duce the occurrence of acute flares, to increase the 
time between relapses, reduce pruritus and the resulting sleep disturbance.5,6
There are a limited number of app roved s ystemic treatments for moderate to severe AD, and 
in the [LOCATION_003], the only  approved s ystemic drugs are corticosteroids and dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]. 
Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], an injectable human monoclonal antibody
 targeting interleukin (IL) - [ADDRESS_531175] ion site reactions, allergic reactions, ey e and ey elid inflammations and 
cold sores.  Another potential limitation of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420926], which may  result in loss of efficacy  over time and the development of
safet y concerns such as serum sickness -like reactions. Furthermore, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420905], which may  not be a method of administration tolerated well by  
[CONTACT_16983].  During a 1- year, randomized, double -blinded study  with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], in the 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg every 2 weeks (marketed maintenance dose) plus TCS group, the 
estimated difference from placebo of the IGA response rate and EASI-75 response rate were 

PF-04965842

Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019
Page 3726% and 46%, respectively .  The placebo response rate for IGA and EASI -75 was 12% and 
23%, respectively .[ADDRESS_531176] drawbacks related to the duration of use due to the potential 
for local and s ystemic side effects (eg, corticosteroid use is limited to 2 to 4 weeks) and to 
the body  regions of use (eg, mid -high potency  corticosteroids are not approved for use on the 
face and/or intertriginous areas).  For AD patients not responding to medicated topi[INVESTIGATOR_420927] , on- and off -label use of sy stemic agents, which include oral 
corticosteroids or oral immunosuppressants, remain the last viable treatment option.  
Systemic therapy  options are associated with p otentially  severe adverse effects and require 
careful monitoring.  The risk of toxicity  and side effects remain a concern when s ystemic 
agents are used.  For these reasons, the use of these agents is limited to short courses or 
intermittent therapy .
PF-
[ADDRESS_531177] the potential risk of 
injection site reactions.  Unlike dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], PF -04965842 is a small molecule and th ere is no 
anticipated immunogenicity  for PF -04965842, and so it is unlikely  to generate antidrug 
antibodies
.
As mentioned above, a variet y of pro -inflammatory  cytokines such as IL -4, IL-5, IL-13, 
IL-31 and IFN -, have been suggested to have a role in the p athogenesis of AD.  Man y of 
these pathogenic cy tokines use the JAK1 for signaling.  Therefore, JAK1 is an attractive 
therapeutic target for AD.
1.2.3. Non-Clinical and Phase 1 Data

Page 381.2.4. Phase 2b in AD (B7451006)
B7451006 was a Phase 2b proof -of-concept trial in adults (ages 18-75) with moderate to 
severe AD investigating doses of 10, 30, 100, and 200 mg PF -
04965842 or placebo taken 
once dail y for up to 12 weeks.  The primary  endpoint in this study  was the proportion of 
subjects achieving an IGA score of clear (0), or almost clear (1), and a 2-point improvement 
from baseline at Week 12.  The baseline was defined as the IGA score on Day 1 pre -dose. 
At Week 12, IGA response rates of PF -04965842 100 mg and 200 mg dose groups were 
significantl y greater than placebo in patients with moderate to severe AD.  The IGA response 
rates of the 200 mg and 100 mg groups were 44.5 % and 27.8%, respectively.  The IGA 
response rate in the placebo group was 6.3% and the estimated differences from placebo in 
the 200 mg and 100 mg groups were 38.2% (P=0.0032) and 21.5% (P=0.0184), respectively .  
The percent change from baseline (% CFB) i n EASI  scores at Week 12 were significantly  
higher for both the 200 mg and 100 mg groups compared to placebo.  The estimated percent 
change from baseline in EASI  score was 
-35.2% in the placebo group, -82.6% in the 200 mg 
group and 
-59.0% in the 100 mg gro up.  At Week 12, the proportion of subjects achieving 
EASI -75 response was 15.6% in the placebo group, 63.7% in the 200 mg group and 41.6% in 
the 100 mg group.  The difference from placebo was 41.8% (P <0.0001) for the 200 mg group 
and 26.0% (P=0.0043) in t he [ADDRESS_531178] 4 points improvement in the severity  of Pruritus NRS from baseline 
(Pruritus NRS 4) of PF -04965842 100 mg and 200 mg dose groups was greater than placebo.  
The estimated pro portion of Pruritus NRS 4 responses at Day 15 were 69.8%, 41.1% and 
15.7% for [ADDRESS_531179] through 
12 weeks of treatment.  Response rates at Week 12 for the 10 mg and 30 mg groups were not 
significantl y different from placebo.  A key differentiating feature for the JAK1 inhibitor is 
rapid resolution of itch associated with AD.  Significant separation from placebo was 
achieved for the Pruritus NRS score as earl y as 2 days after initiation of treatment for the 
200mg dose group.
Overall, the results demonstrated dose -dependent increases in responses at Week 12for key  
efficacy  endpoints (IGA, EASI  and Pruritus NRS score).
PF-04965842 appeared generall y safe and well tolerated in this study.  Overall, adverse 
events ( AE)s and Serious Adverse Events (SAE )s were numericall y higher in subjects 
receiving PF -[ADDRESS_531180] common AEs were in the infections and infestations, skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders and gastrointestinal disorders s ystem organ class (SOC), and the majority  of the 
AEs were m ild.  There were 2 cases of herpes zoster, one in the 10 mg group (not treatment 
related), and one in the 30 mg group (treatment related).  There were dose -dependent 
decreases in platelet counts observed in the study , which plateaued at Week 4.  Further 
details of the clinical Phase 2 development program can be found in the IB.

Page 391.3.Summary of PF -04965842 Clinical Pharmacokinetics
PF-04965842 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_420928]/suspension 
administration over the dose range 3 mg to 200 mg with time to maximum absorption (T max) 
ranging between 0.55 to 0.77 hours (B7451001).  Median T maxat doses of 400 mg and 
800mg were 1.5 and 3.9 hours, respectively , which indicated the slower absorption 
compared to lower doses.  PF -04965842 showed a monopha sic decline at dose <100 mg with 
biphasic profiles at doses 100mg.  Observed peak plasma PF -04965842 concentrations 
(Cmax) following the single- dose administration generall y increased in proportion to the dose 
from [ADDRESS_531181], both area under the plasma concentration- time curve from 
time zero extrapolated to infinity  (AUC inf) and area under the plasma concentration time 
profile from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC last) were dose proportional 
in the range of 3 mg to 200mg, while a greater than proportional increase was observed at 
doses of 400 and 800 mg.  The arithmetic mean terminal phase half -life (t ½) was 1.9 to 
4.9hours.
Following QD administration over the dose range 30 mg to 400 mg and 100 mg and 
200mgtwice a day  (BID) for 10 days, median T maxranged between 0.50 to 0.77 hours 
(B7451001).  After attainment of C max, the disposition of PF- [ADDRESS_531182] dose and an arithmetic mean terminal phase t ½between 2.8 to 5.0 hours.  
Although C maxgenerally  increased in proportion to the dose up to 100 mg given twice dail y 
(BID), it increased more than the dose increased at 400 mg QD and 200 mg BID. 
The same 
trend was also observed for area under the plasma concentration- time curve (AUC tau) over 
the dosing interval (tau =12 or 24 hours).  The observed accumulation ratio (R ac) following 
200mg BID was 2.0 and 2.5 for AUC tauand C max, respectivel y.  R acwas 1.1 to 1.5 at other 
doses.  Therefore, the results showed that drug concentration accumulation is minimal after 
repeated oral administration at lower doses consistent with the prediction from t ½.  Urinary  
recovery  of PF -04965842 was low, with <5% of the dose recovered unchanged in urine 
across all doses and regimens in all cohorts.
At a single 800 mg dose, the geometric mean percent coefficient of variation (%CV) 
Cmax(ng/mL) was similar in Western (n=5; 3819 (26)) and Japanese subjects 
(n=10; 3660 (48)).  However, geometric mean AUC inf(ng*hr/mL) was 26% higher in 
Western subjects (n=5; [ZIP_CODE] (35)) than that observed in Japanese subjects 
(n=9; [ZIP_CODE] (43)) (B7451001).  Geometric mean (%CV) C maxand AUC taufollowing 
multiple -dose administration of 20 0mgBID were 17% and 56% higher, respectively , in the 
Western subjects (n=5) than in Japanese subjects (n=6). 
Co-administration of 400 mg (4 x 100 mg) of the tablet with food resulted in equivalent 
geometric mean AUC infbetween fasted and fed conditions and a small mean decrease 
(<5%) in C max.  The magnitude of decrease in C maxwas not considered to be clinically  
important.  Overall, PF -04965842 can be administered with or without food.

Population pharmacokinetics (PK) analysiswas conducted by  [CONTACT_420983] 1 
studies (B7451001, first -in-human study , and B7451004, relative bioavailability  study ) in 
healthy  subjects and the proof -of-concept study  (B7451006) in AD patients.  A total of 
[ADDRESS_531183] -order absorption.  The estimates of 
systemic clearance/fraction of dose absorbed (CL/F) and volume of distribution/fraction 
absorbed (V/F) were 44.8 L/hr and 147 L with inter individual variability  (IIV) values 
of63% and 35% (expressed as % CV) respectively .  Clearance (CL/F) of AD patients was 
estimated to be ~38% lower than that of health y subjects; residual variability  was estimated 
to be higher in A D patients compared to the value in healthy  subjects (66% vs. 36% CV).  
Baseline bod y weight, race, age and sex were tested as covariates on clearance and did not 
appear to impact the PK o f PF-04965842.
1.4.Summary of Benefits and Risks
There was clinicall y me aningful benefit demonstrated in the Phase 2b Proof of Concept study  
in adult patients with moderate to severe AD.  The potential risks of treatment include those 
that were noted in Phase 2b and/ or those based on the pharmacology  of JAK inhibitors and 
include viral reactivation, serious and opportunistic infections, hematopoietic effects 
(including reduced platelet count), and malignancy  and immunoproliferative disorders 
Further information is available in the IB.  Appropriate risk evaluation and mitigatio n 
strategies have been incorporated into this protocol.
Overall, there is a favorable benefit- risk profile to support the continued development into 
Phase 3 of PF -04965842 in the treatment of patients, 12 years of age and older, with AD for 
both the 100 mgand 200 mg dose.
1.5.Dose Selection Rationale
Dose selection for Phase 3 was based on efficacy  and safety  of PF-04965842 from a 
dose-ranging Phase 2b study , B7451006 that evaluated a 20 -fold dose range (10 mg to 
200mgQD) in adult subjects with AD.  The 200 mgQD dose as a monotherapy  is expected 
to provide efficacy  similar to that of currently  approved sy stemic treatments (eg cy closporine, 
systemic corticosteroids and dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]) in moderate to severe AD, based on dose -response 
modeling of IGA response in the Phase 2 study , and was therefore selected as the high dose 
for evaluation in Phase 3 studies.  Additionally , adose of 100 mg QD was selected for 
Phase 3 evaluation .  The 100 mg dose is expected to differentiate from the higher dose in 
terms of efficacy , safety and sy stemic exposure .  In this study , the efficacy  and safet y of the 
100mg dose will be evaluated in combination with background topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588] .  Both 
100mg and 200 mgQD doses demonstrated acceptable safet y and tolerability  in the Phase 2 
study .  Further details are available in the IB.  The dosing regimen of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420929]

This is a randomized, double -blind, double -dummy , placebo -controlled, parallel -group, 
multi-center study  to assess the efficacy  and safety  of PF -04965842 100 mg or 200 mg QD 
and dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (as per label) compared with placebo in adult subjects on background topi[INVESTIGATOR_420912] y, with moderate to severe AD.  This study  will provide a direct comparison of both 
doses of PF -04965842 with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420930].  This study  will also 
provide data which will estimate the relative efficacy of both doses of PF -04965842 and 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458].   The treatment duration is 20 weeks.  A total of approximately  700 subjects will 
be enrolled from approximately 270 sites globall y.  There is a primary  efficacy  assessment at 
Week 12, and key  secondary  efficacy  assessments at Week 2 and Week 16.  Efficacy  and 
safet y endpoints will be asse ssed throughout the entire study .A study  design schematic is 
presented in Figure 1.
Figure 1.Study Design Schematic
aAt Week 2 and Week 16, key secondary endpoints are measured.
bAt Week 12, prim ary endpoints are measured.
cAt Week 20, eligible subjects will enter the B7451015 long -term extension study; ineligible subjects w ill 
instead enter the 4 -week off- treatm ent follow -up period in B7451029. 
Note: Standardized background topi[INVESTIGATOR_420932] .
After providing informed consent, subjects will be assessed for stud y eligibility  at the 
screening visit.  Subjects will undergo screening within [ADDRESS_531186] s are required to use non -medicated topi[INVESTIGATOR_420912] y (ie, emollients) at least twice dail y for the last [ADDRESS_531187] also be

throughout the durati on of the study .  Subjects may  be re -screened once if they  fail the 
screening evaluation for reasons related to incidental transitory  conditions.   Subjects for 
whom screen failure is related to failing the disease severit y (including extent of disease) 
inclusion criterion 3and who subsequently  experience worsening AD, which in the 
investigator’s judgement would make them eligible for participation, may  be considered for 
re-screening. Such cases should be discussed with the Pfi zer Medical Monitor (or designee) 
to determine if re -
screening is appropriate.
Subjects who continue to meet eligibility  criteria at baseline will undergo Day 1 assessments 
and be randomized in a 4:4:4:1:1 ratio to receive 100 mg or 200 mg of PF -04965842 Q D 
with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] -matching placebo administered every  other week , dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg 
administered every  other week (with a loading dose of 600 mg at baseline) with 
PF-04965842-matching placebo administered QD , or one of two sequences of 
PF-
04965842- matching placebo administered QD with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] -matching placebo 
administered every
 other week from Day 1, for [ADDRESS_531188].  At Week 16 in the treatment period, all 
subjects will cease injectable dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420933].  This is to facilitate the 
washout of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (for a total of 6 weeks; as the final dose of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420934] 14) prior to eligible subjects entering the long- term 
extension study , in which all subj ects will receive PF -[ADDRESS_531189] the

Male subjects are not required to use contraception.
All female subjects of childbearing potential who are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], 
sexually  active and at ri sk for pregnancy  with their partner(s) must agree to use a highly  
effective method of contraception consistentl y and correctly for the duration of the active 
treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_531209] of contraception methods (see below) an d will confirm that the 
subject has been instructed in its consistent and correct use.  At time points indicated in the 
Schedule of A ctivities, the investigator or designee will inform the subject of the need to use 
highl y effective contraception consistently  and correctl y and document the conversation and 
the subject’s affirmation in the subject’s chart (subjects needs to affirm their consistent and 
correct use of at least 1 of the selected methods of contraception).  In addition, t he 
investigator or designee will instruct the subject to call immediately  if the selected 
contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy  is known or suspected in the subject or 
the partner.
Highl y effective methods of contraception are those that, al one or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and 
include the following:
1.Established use of hormonal methods of contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation (eg, ora l, inserted, injected, implanted, transdermal) provided the subject 
plans to remain on the same treatment throughout the entire study  and has been using 
that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness.
2.Correctl y placed co pper-contai ning intrauterine device (IUD).
3.Male condom or female condom used WI TH a separate spermicide product (ie, foam, 
gel, film, cream, or suppository ).  For countries where spermicide is not available or 
condom plus spermicide is not accepted as high ly effective contraception, this option 
is not appropriate.
4.Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the post -vasectom y ejaculate.
NOTE : Vasectomized partner is a highly  effective birth control method provided that 
partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP)
trial participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of 
the surgical success.

The contraception check is an opportunity  to confirm that contraception, if assigned, is used 
consistently  and correctly .  It also facilitates cont inual reassessment of childbearing potential 
in women.  This allows for implementing necessary changes to contraception; for example, 
investigators may  need to ensure alternative contraceptive methods if new concomitant 
disease contraindicates a selected m ethod of contraception, or if a subject is demonstrably  no 
longer of child bearing status (as per protocol) then they  will no longer require contraception.  
Continual reassessment of contraceptive needs is imperative.
For countries in the EU:
Highl y effecti ve methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and 
include the following:
1. Established use of hormonal methods of contraception as sociated with inhibition of 
ovulation (eg, oral, inserted, injected, implanted, transdermal) provided the subject 
plans to remain on the same treatment throughout the entire study  and has been using 
that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of tim e to ensure effectiveness.
2.Correctly placed copper -containing intrauterine device (IUD).
3.Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the post -vasectom y ejaculate.
NOTE: Vasectomiz ed partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that 
partner i s the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that the 
vasectomi zed partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success.
4.Bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8820] y or bilateral tubal occlusive procedure 
(provided that occlu sion has been confirmed in accordance with the device’s label).
NOTE: Sexual abstinence, defined as completel y and persistently  refraining from all 
heterosexual intercourse (including during the entire period of risk associated with the study  
treatments) m ay obviate the need for contraception ONLY if this is the preferred and usual 
lifesty le of the subject.

Page 584.4.2. Vaccine and Exposure to Infections Guidelines
[IP_ADDRESS]. Subject Specific Recommendations
It is recommended that all subjects should be up- to-date with respect to standard of care 
vaccinations (as defined by  [CONTACT_74066] ) or AD guidelines.  Vaccination of 
subjects with live attenuated vaccines is prohibited within the [ADDRESS_531210] udy, and for 6 weeks following completion 
of the study .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Guidance Regarding Household Contact [CONTACT_74068] -
Related Exposure
Current routine household contact [CONTACT_420986] s may pose a risk during treatment and for 6 weeks following 
completion of the study .  Some of these vaccines include varicella (“chickenpox”) vaccine, 
oral polio vaccine, and the inhaled flu vaccine.  Following vaccination with live component 
vaccines, the virus may  be shed in bodily  fluids, including stool, and there is a potential risk 
that the virus may  be transmitted.  General guidelines for immunosuppressed subjects 
suggest that exposure (through routine contact) should be avoided following vaccination (of 
others) with these vaccines for the stated time period:
a.Varicella or attenuated typhoid fever vaccination for 4 weeks following vaccination;
b.Oral polio vaccination for 6 weeks following vaccination;
c.Attenuated rotavirus vaccine for 10 days following vaccination ;
d. FluMist(intranasal flu vaccine) for 1 week following vaccination ;
Subjects should avoid exposure to recently  vaccinated or infected persons and contact [CONTACT_420987] y should they  develop signs or sy mptoms of infections.
4.4.3. Surgery
During the study , no electiv e surgery  should occur without first consulting with the [COMPANY_007] 
Medical Monitor or designee.  Preferabl y, elective surgery  should occur before the study  or 
be delay ed until participation in the study  is completed.
The [COMPANY_007] Medical Monitor or designee sho uld be notified if a subject requires surgery  
(including dental surgery) during the study  to determine whether the subject should 
discontinue from the study and/or discontinue investigational product prior to the surgical 
procedure.  In general, planned su rgical procedures should not be performed unless the 
investigational product has been discontinued for at least 28 days (unless otherwise advised 
by [CONTACT_74070]).  The [COMPANY_007] Medical Monitor or designee should 
be notified as soon as possible if a subject undergoes a surgical procedure without first 
informing the stud y staff.

5.STUDY TREATMENTS 
The study  treatments are as follows:
Orally  administered 100 mg of PF -04965842 QD with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] -matching placebo 
administered b y subcutaneous injection every other week (two injections at baseline ; 
to dummy  the loading dose) from Day 1 to Week 16, followed b y orall y administered 
100mg of PF -04965842 QD until Week 20.
Orally  administered 200 mg of PF -04965842 QD with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] -matching placebo

04965842 QD until Week 20.
Treatment duration will be 20 weeks (with the blind maintained throughout).
Subjects who do not enroll into the long -term extension study , B7451015, will enter a 
4-week follow -up post - treatment period.
For the purposes of this study , and per International Council for Harmonisation (I CH) 
guidelines, in vestigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active 
ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference/comparator in a clinical trial, 
including a product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or 
packag ed) in a way  different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved 
indication, or when used to gain further information about an approved use (I CH E6 1.33).
5.1.Allocation to Treatment
Allocation of subjects to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an I nteractive 
Response Technology  (IRT) sy stem.  The site personnel (study  coordinator or specified 
designee) will be required to enter or select information including but not limited to the 
user’s identification (ID) and password, protocol number, the subject number and the date of 
birth of the subject.  The site personnel will then be provided with a treatment assignment 
and dispensable unit (DU) or container number when investigational product is being 
supplied via the I RT.  The I RT s ystem will provide a confirmation report containing the 
subject number and DU or container number assigned.  The confirmation report must be 
stored in the site’s files.
There is a [ADDRESS_531211] information and further
details on the use of the IRT.
NOTE : The IRT is the source of the subject number.  The IRT s ystem will provide the 
subject number at the end of the first IRT subject transaction.
5.2.Breaking the Blind
Investigators, subjects and the sponsor study  team will be blinded as to treatment group. At 
each site, an unblinded administrator/trainer will administer the first dose of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420943] (or caregiver, if applicable) in proper injection 
technique.  At all times, treatment and randomization information will be kept confidential 
and will not be released to the investigator, the study  staff, or the sponsor’s study  team until 
following the conclusion of the study , with the excep tion described in this section.

PF-[ADDRESS_531212] be full y documented and entered on the Case Report Form (CRF).  Whenever 
possible, the investigator should contact [CONTACT_74075].  If the blind is 
broken, the investigator should promptly  inform the [COMPANY_007] Clinician or Medical Monitor.  
The subject for whom the blind has been broken will be discontinued from the study  and 
undergo the earl y termination (ET) procedures.
5.3. Subject Compliance
There are viscosit y differences between dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420944], and as such 
there is a potential for functional unblinding of the administrator/trainer; who may  notice the 
difference in viscosit y and/or may have previous experience administering dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458].
Although no administrator/trainer will know the treatment allocation of subjects, as a risk 
mitigation against functional unblinding affecting study  integrit y this administrator/trainer 
will only  administer injectable investigational product (I P), or observe/train subjects 
administering injectable IP, w ill be isolated from all other study  activities, and will be treated 
as if unblind. Throughout the protocol, these individuals will be referred to as "unblinded 
administrator/trainer" in order to make this clear distinction from other site personnel.
When investigational product is administered at the research facility , it will be administered 
under the supervision of the unblinded administrator/trainer onl y. From the Day [ADDRESS_531213] bo to take 
home with them for self -administration on non
-study  visit day s. Subjects will be dispensed 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420945] -matching placebo at the Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8 and 
Week 12 visits for self -administration (or administration by  a caregiver , if applicable) at the 
site.  Subjects will also be dispensed dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420945]- matching placebo at Week 4, 
Week 8, and Week 12 visits to take home with them for self -administration (or 
administration by  a caregiver, if applicable) at Week 6, Week 10, and Week 14, respectivel y.  
If the subject is unwilling/unable to self
-administer the injectable investigational product or 
arrange for a caregiver to administer the injectable investigational product, then it is 
permissible for site to arrange for the s ubject to return to the site for administration by  [CONTACT_420990]/administrator.   Subjects will be directed to bring an y used and unused 
syringe cartons to visits following administration at home. Study  sites will provide subjects 
with a sharps con
tainer for disposal of used s yringes. Subjects will return this sharps 
container to the stud y site at the final visit for disposal.
Subjects will be issued an electronic dosing diary  (eDiary ) and will be educated to record the 
time of their dosing, once they  have taken the investigational product.  Subjects will also use 
the eDiary  to record their daily  use of standardized background topi[INVESTIGATOR_420946], as required and as per protocol guidelines in Section 5.9.1, beginning at 
screening through the EOS visit.

PF-[ADDRESS_531214] should be administered in the morning.  Subjects should be instructed 
that if an oral dose is inadvertently missed then it should be taken as soon as remembered, 
but not within 12 hours of the next scheduled dose.  If an injectable d ose is missed, subjects 
(or caregivers, if applicable) should be instructed to administer the injection within [ADDRESS_531215]’s original schedule.  If the missed dose is 
not administered within 7 days, subjects (or caregivers, if applicable) should be instructed to 
wait until the next dose on the original schedule.
Investigational product may be temporarily  withheld for a maximum of 14 days at 
investigator's discretion due to abnormal laboratory tests or adverse even t. See Appendix [ADDRESS_531216] . Doses not taken 
for the reasons mentioned above do not constitute protocol deviations or medication errors 
and should not be considered dosing errors, but should be noted in the dosing log with the 
reason for reduced drug consumption.
Other than for the above reasons, the following compliance cases will be considered 
medication errors and will be discussed with the spons or for possible withdrawal from the 
study :
Subjects interrupting oral investigational product for more than 4 consecutive day s or 
for a total of mo re than 7 days between visits;
Subjects administering >8 tablets in one day  or administering 4table ts/day  for 
4consecutive day s;
Missed dose of injectable investigational product is not administered within 7 days of 
the originall y scheduled dose; 
Subjects administering >1 prefilled s yringe every 2 weeks, with the exception of the 
initial loading dose of two prefilled syringes on Day 1;
Subjects who have an overall compliance of <80% or >120% between visits.
Compliance with background topi[INVESTIGATOR_52201] y guidelines inSection 5.9.[ADDRESS_531217] and ensure steps are taken 
to improve compliance. In addition, if the compliance deviation reaches the thresholds 
defined above, it should also be recorded as a medication error ( see Section 8.4.4).
5.4.Investigational Product Supplies
5.4.1. Dosage Form(s) and Packaging
Blinded PF -
04965842 and its matched placebo will be provided as 100 mg tablets for oral 
administration.  The 100 mg tablets and their matching placebos will be supplied in separate 
bottles and labeled according to local regulatory  requirements. When received by  [CONTACT_420991], PF-04965842 and matching placebo will be in containers that will sufficiently  
blind all site staff to content within the bottles (ie, active versus placebo).
Blinded active comparator (dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]) will be provided as 300 mg/[ADDRESS_531218] 
(or caregiver, if applicable) should be instructed to maintain the product in the containers 
provided through out the course of dosing and return the containers to th e site at the next 
study  visit.
5.5.Administration
The treatment period is [ADDRESS_531219], PF -04965842 or its matching placebo, will be administered for 
20weeks .  Subjects will be dispensed two (2) bottles of oral investigational product at the 
Day 1, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 16 visits.  Subjects will be given clear dosing 
instructions to take one tablet from each bottle, once dail y, preferabl y in the morning
whenever possible , at approximately  the same time of day .  On study  visit day s, subjects (and 
caregivers, if applicable) are to be instructed to refrain from dosing at home, and are to 
administer investigational product in the clinic under observation .
Subjects will sw allow the oral investigational product whole, and will not manipulate or 
chew the medication prior to swallowing.  Oral investigational product may  be taken with or 
without food, other than on study  visit day s where fasting is required. Injectable 
investi gational product, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420913], will be administered for 
16weeks with the final injection planned for Week 14.  Subjects will be dispensed prefilled 
syringes containing injectable investigational product at the Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, 

PF-[ADDRESS_531220] will be administered at the site on 
Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8 and Week 12 under the observation of the unblinded 
administrator/trainer, and at home by [CONTACT_423] (or caregiver, if applica ble) at Week 6, 
Week 10, and Week 14.  The unblinded administrator/trainer will instruct the subject (or 
caregiver, if applicable) on the proper aseptic technique to administer a subcutaneous 
injection when using the prefilled syringes.  The first injectio n at the Day 1 visit will be 
administered b y an unblinded administrator/trainer and used to train the subject (or caregiver, 
if applicable) on correct injection technique.  The second injection will be administered by  
[CONTACT_423] (or caregiver, if applicab le) immediately  following the first injection, under the 
observation of the unblinded administrator/trainer.  If an y issues with technique are observed, 
the unblinded observer must retrain the subject appropriatel y.  All injections should be 
administered i n accordance with the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420947].
The investigator should assign the responsibility  of unblinded administrator/trainer to a 
member of the stud y site staff who will not participate in an y other stud y-related activities, 
ensuring that all other site staff do not risk becoming functionally  unblinded. Contact 
[CONTACT_420992]/trainer and study  subjects should be kept to a minimum.  
The unblinded administrator/trainer must not take any  action that may  potentially  reveal 
treatment assignment to the subject or site staff. The investigator, site staff, and any  study  
participants other than the unblinded administrator/trainer must not be allowed to know the 
investigational product assigned to an y stud y subject and must not be allowed to see the 
treatment records.
At Week 16, subjects previously  receiving only  placebo will receive PF -[ADDRESS_531221] party  provided for use in this study  
are: 
a.pre-filled s yringes for subcutaneous i njection of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (manufactured by  
[CONTACT_13225] -Regen eron followed by  [CONTACT_420993]  a third 
party ); 
b.pre-filled s yringes for subcutaneous injection of matching placebo. 
2. Instructions for medical device use are provided in the Dosin g Instructions.

PF-[ADDRESS_531222] be detected, documented, and reported b y the 
investigator throughout the study  (see Section 8.4.5 ).
5.7.Investigational Product Storage 
The investigator, or an approved representative, eg, pharmacist, will ensure that all 
investigational products are stored in a secured area with controlled access under required 
storage conditio ns and in accordance with appl icable regulatory  requirements.
Investigational product should be stored in their original container and in accordance with the 
labels.  See the Investigational Product Manual (IP Manual) for storage conditions of the 
product.
Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD will be superseded b y the storage conditions 
stated on the product label.
Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures fo r all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room
-temperature products).  This should 
be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study .  Even for 
continuous- monitoring sy stems, a log o r site procedure that ensures active evaluation for 
excursions should be available.  The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum 
temperature is checked each business day  to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last 
evaluation and to provid e the site with the capability  to store or view the minimum/maximum 
temperature for all non- working day s upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the 
temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, 
should be regularl y inspected to ensure they  are maintained in working order.
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to [COMPANY_007] upon 
discovery .  The site should actively  pursue options for returning the product to the storag e 
conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage 
requirements, including any  actions taken, must be doc umented and reported to [COMPANY_007].
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used 
until [COMPANY_007] provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.  It will 
not be considered a protocol deviation if [COMPANY_007] approves the use of the investigational 
product after the temperature excursion.  Use of the inves tigational product prior to [COMPANY_007] 
approval will be considered a protocol deviation.  Specific details regarding information the 
site should report for each excursion will be provided to the si te in the I P Manual.
Receipt of materials, door opening and clo sing, and other routine handling operations where 
the products are briefl y out of the temperature range described in the labeling are not 
considered excursions.
Site staff will instruct subjects on the proper storage requirements for take home 
investigatio nal products.

PF-[ADDRESS_531223] supplies.  All investigational products will be 
accounted for using a drug accountabilit y form/record.  To ensure adequate records, all drug 
supplies will be accounted for in the drug accountability  inventory  forms as instructed by  
[CONTACT_74076] b y the accounting of unused investigational product retur ned b y 
the subjects.  At the end of the clinical trial, all drug supplies unallocated or unused by  [CONTACT_74077], or destro yed in an approved 
manner unless otherwise authorized by  [CONTACT_4618].  In either case, th e forms must identify  the 
investigational product, including batch or code numbers, and account for its disposition on a 
subject -by-subject basis, including specific dates and quantities.
All bottles of oral investigational product must be brought back to the site at every  visit for 
inspection by  [CONTACT_74078]/unused oral investigational product must be 
returned to the investigator by  [CONTACT_420994](s).
Subjects will be directed to bring an y used and unused sy ringe carton s to all visits for 
inspection by  [CONTACT_7893].  Study  sites will provide subjects with a sharps container for 
disposal of used sy ringes.  Subjects will return this sharps container to the study  site at the 
final visit for disposal.
5.8.1. Destruction of Invest igational Product Supplies
The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused investigational 
product (eg, at the site).  If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the 
investigator must ensure that the mat erials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable 
environmental regulations, institutional policy , and any  special instructions provided by  
[CONTACT_4618], and all destruction must be adequatel y documented.
5.9. Concomitant Treatment(s)
Subjects will abstain from all concomitant medications as described in Section 4.2and
Appendix 3of the protocol.  Medications that are taken in the Screening/Washout period 
(after informed consent is obtained and before the first dose of investigational product) will 
be documented as prior medications.  Medications taken after the first dose of investigational 
product has been administered will be documented as concomitant medic ations.  All 
concomitant medications taken during the study  must be recorded in study  records with 
indication (if atopic dermatitis), reference to an y associated adverse event, dose, and start and 
stop dates of administration.  Subjects will be queried abo ut concomitant medication 
(including topi[INVESTIGATOR_74030], over- the-counter and prescription medications 
and treatments, and vaccinations) at each study  visit.  Any  new concomitant medications or 
dose changes to current concomitant medication s should be evaluated for potential new or 
worsening adverse events.

and according to the Investigator’s usual practice: 
Non-medicated Topi[INVESTIGATOR_160794]
Non- medicated topi[INVESTIGATOR_420948], or other additives which could a ffect AD (eg, hyaluronic acid, urea, ceramide or 
filaggrin degradation products)
: must be applied at least twice dail y to all body areas 
affected with AD, throughout at least the final 7 days prior to Day 1 and throughout 
the remainder of the study .
Medicated Topi[INVESTIGATOR_160794]
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_24946] (TCS) must be applied once dail y to areas with active lesions, 
starting on Day  1 (Baseline) and throughout the study, acc ording to the guidance 
below:
Medium potency  TCS (eg, Triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream or fluocinolone 
acetonide 0.025% ointment) must be applied to body  areas with active lesions that 
are suitable for the use of medium potency  TCS.  Subjects must be cli nically  
monitored for toxicity  to topi[INVESTIGATOR_420949].
After lesions are under control (clear or almost clear), treat once dail y for a 
further 7 days, then stop;
If lesions return then resume treatment with medium potency  TCS, but use the 
approach described above upon lesion resolution.
Low potency  TCS (ie, hydrocortisone 1% cream) must be applied to body  areas of 
thin skin (face, neck, intertriginous, and genital areas, areas of skin atroph y, etc.) 
with active lesions instead of med ium potency  TCS or to body  areas where 
continued treatment with medium potency  TCS is considered unsafe.  Subjects 
must be clinically  monitored for toxicity  to topi[INVESTIGATOR_420950]. 
After lesions are under control (clear or almost c lear), treat once dail y for a 
further 7 days, then stop;
If lesions return then resume treatment with low potency  TCS, but use the 
approach described above upon lesion resolution.

amounts not known to be associated with adverse effects (such as h yper-vitaminosis).
Unless a prohibited medication or treatment, subjects may  be administered any other 
medications necessary  for the treatment of concomitant medical disorders as deemed 
necessary  by [CONTACT_74079].  Following Day 1, addition of concomitant medications 
or an y change in the dosage should be limited to those considered medicall y essential.
A subject who is receiving a permitted concomitant me dication for an y reason must be on a

PF-[ADDRESS_531248] withdrawal from the study :
If a subject has a clinically significant, treatment -emergent, abnormality  at the time of 
withdrawal from the study, the [COMPANY_007] Medical Monitor (or des ignee) should be notified and 
every  effort should be made to arrange follow -up evaluations at appropriate intervals to 
document the course of the abnormalit y.  All abnormal laboratory events of clinical 
significance should be followed until the laboratory  values have returned to normal or 
baseline levels or are deemed clinically  stable.  Follow -up for abnormal laboratory  findings 
and adverse events by  [CONTACT_74081] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.  
Refer to Appendix 4for Guidelines for Monitoring and Discontinuation. 
Withdrawal of consent :
Subjects who request to discontinue receipt of study  treatment will remain in the study .  If 
this request occurs at a scheduled visit, an end of treatment visit should be performed and the 
subject should enter into the follow -up period, with an end of study  visit scheduled for 
4weeks after the end of treatment visit.  If the request occurs outside of a scheduled visit 
(eg,via telephone contact) the subject should be scheduled to return to site for an end of 
treatment visit within one week, and the subject should enter into the follow -up period, with 
an end of study  visit scheduled for [ADDRESS_531249] or also from study  procedures and/or 
posttreatment study  follow -up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page.  In the event that 
vital status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being m easured, publicly  available 
information should be used to determine vital status only  as appropriatel y directed in 
accordance with local law.
Lost to follow- up: 
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing 
status.  This includes follow- up with persons authorized by  [CONTACT_74084].  Lost 
to follow -up is defined by  [CONTACT_53981] y to reach the subject after a minimum of [ADDRESS_531250]’s medical records.  If it is 
determined that the subject has died, the site will use locally  permissible methods to obtain 
the date and cause of death.  I f the investigator ’s use of a third- party representative to assist 
in the follow -up portion of the study  has been included in the subject’s informed consent, 
then the investigator may use a sponsor- retained third -party representative to assist site staff 
with obtaining the subject’s contact [CONTACT_168077]-[ADDRESS_531251]’s medical records.
Subjects may  withdraw from the study  at any  time at their own request, or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety (see also the 
Withdrawal From the Study  Due to Adverse Events section) or behavioral reasons, or the 
inability  of the subject to comply  with the protocol -required schedule of study  visits or 
procedures at a given study site.  Subjects that discontinue study  treatment will remain in the 
study  and must have their end of trea tment visit within [ADDRESS_531252]’s medical record.  In an y circumstance, every  effort 
should be made to docume nt subject outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire 
about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational 
product(s), request that the subject return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with 
the subject regarding an y unresolved AEs.
If the subject withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -required tests and procedures are 
completed as described.  However, it is anticipated that from time to time th ere may  be 
circumstances outside of the control of the investigator that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test.  In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the 
safet y and well -being of the subject.  When a protocol -require d test cannot be performed, the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that 
he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.  The 
study  team will be informed of these incidents in a timely  manner.
For samples being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and 
shipment instructions and contact [CONTACT_19987] . 

PF-[ADDRESS_531253] 25 mIU/mL, will be performed at screening.  A urine pregna ncy test with a sensitivity 
of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed at every site visit inc luding the End of Treatment 
(EOT) and follow-up visits to confirm the subject has not becom e pregnant during the study, 
and at the follow-up visit. 
A negative pregnancy test result is required before the subject  may receive the investigational 
product.  Pregnancy tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual  cycle is missed during the 
active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy is otherwi se suspected).  Pregnancy 
tests may also be repeated if requested by [CONTACT_420996] (IRBs)/ethics 
committees (ECs) or if required by [CONTACT_427]. 
Urine pregnancy tests must be sensitive to at least 25 mIU/mL an d will be conducted with the 
test kit provided by [CONTACT_420997].  Subjects who have missed a menstrual period or  who show an indeterminate 
or positive result on the urine test may not further progress i n the study until pregnancy is 
ruled out using further diagnostic testing (eg, a negative quant itative serum pregnancy test
conducted at a certified laboratory).
In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy, the subject will  be withdrawn from 
administration of investigational product but may remain in the  study.
CCI
PF-[ADDRESS_531254].  Unscheduled safet y assessments may be performed at an y time 
during the study to assess any perceived safet y concerns.  Investigators and [COMPANY_007] Clini cians 
(or designees) will review individual subject data throughout the conduct of the study  to 
ensure subjects’ well -being.
7.3.1. Vitals Signs
Vital signs (sitting blood pressure, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_420964]) will be 
measured (pre-dose, if app licable) after [ADDRESS_531255] as indicated in the Schedule of 
Activities. 
Body temperature will be collected using the t ympanic or oral methods and the same method 
should be used consistently  throughout the study . 
Blood pressur e (BP) will be measured using a standard calibrated blood pressure measuring 
device.  A BP device that uses multiple cuff sizes based on the arm circumference is the 
required t ype of device.  The appropriate cuff size for the subject must be used to ensure
accurate measurement.  The arm circumference at the midpoint of the length of the upper arm 
should be measured to determine the appropriate cuff size in accordance with the 
specifications of the BP measuring device.  The same properly  sized and calibrated blood 
pressure cuff will be used to measure blood pressure each time. 
Subjects should be seated in a chair, back supported, and arms bared (free of restrictions such 
as rolled-up sleeves, etc.) and supported at heart level.  Measurements should be taken on the 
same arm at each visit (preferabl y non -dominant).  Subjects should refrain from smoking or 
ingesting caffeine during the [ADDRESS_531256]. 
Heart rate should be measur ed at approximately the same time as BP for a minimum of 
30seconds.  When the timing of BP and pulse (heart) rate measurements coincides with a 
blood collection or other study  procedure, BP and pulse (heart) rate should be obtained first.
7.3.2. Medical History, Physical Examination, Height, and Weight
Complete AD disease history  includes collection of details of AD at Screening: AD 
diagnosis, the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_12969], s ystemic treatments and other treatments for AD.  
Medical history  in addition to AD histor y including disease duration will be collected at 
screening.  Medical history  also includes history  of alcohol and tobacco use.  Smoking status 
and average weekl y alcohol consumption (units/week) will be collected, where a unit 
contains 12 g of pure alcohol, an amount equivalent to that contained in 5 oz/150 mL (a 
glass) of wine, 12 oz/360 mL of beer, or 1.5 oz/[ADDRESS_531257] wearing shoes.  Height (inches or centimeters) 
and weight (lb or kg) will be measured and recorded in the source document at th e screening

seeSchedules of Activities .
Complete phy sical examinations must be performed by  [CONTACT_093], sub -investigator or a 
qualified health professional per local guidelines.  Complete phy sical examinations consist of 
assessments of general appearance; skin; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat (HEENT); mouth, 
heart; lungs ; breast (optional); abdomen; external genitalia (optional); extremities; neurologic 
function; and ly mph nodes.
Targeted ph ysical examinations must be performed by  [CONTACT_093], sub -investigator or a 
qualified health professional per local guidelines a nd should include skin, heart, lungs, and 
abdomen and examination of body  systems where there are s ymptom complaints by  [CONTACT_1560]. 
Complete and Targeted phy sical examinations are performed at various time points, 
seeSchedules of Activities.
7.3.3. Chest X -Ray
Chest radiograph (posterior -anterior and lateral views) or other appropriate diagnostic image 
(ie, c omputed tomography [CT] or m agnetic resonance imaging [MRI ]) with no evidence of 
current, active TB or previous inactive TB, taken at screening or within [ADDRESS_531258] be located and available in the source documentation.
7.3.4. Tuberculosis Testing
At the time of screening, all sub jects will undergo tuberculosis (TB) testing unless performed 
within 12 weeks of Day 1.  QuantiFERON-TB Gold I n-Tube Test is the preferred testing 
method.  If the test results are indeterminate, the test should be repeated.   If the 
QuantiFERON-TB Gold I n-Tube test cannot be performed, or if the results of the repeat test 
are indeterminate, then subjects may  be screened using the Purified Protein Derivative ([COMPANY_003]) 
Tuberculin Skin Test (Mantoux method) with approval of the [COMPANY_007] Medical Monitor. 
In addition to TB testing as specified in this clinical protocol, a chest X- ray will be 
performed to aid in TB status determination. 
QuantiFERON-TB Gold I n-Tube is an in vitro diagnostic test using a peptide cocktail 
simulating ESAT -6, CFP -10and TB 7.7 proteins t o stimulate cells in heparinized whole 
blood.  Detection of interferon -gamma b y Enz yme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay  (ELISA) is 
used to identify  in vitro responses to these peptide antigens that are associated with 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.  Quant iFERON-TB Gold In -Tube is an indirect test 
for M.tuberculosis infection (including disease) and is intended for use in conjunction with 
risk assessment, radiography  and other medical and diagnostic evaluations.

PF-04965842
B7451029
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019
Page 90A blood sample (approximately  3mL) will be collected at screening for QuantiFERON-TB 
Gold I n-Tube testing.  Following sample processing, the sample will be shipped to the 
sponsor’s designated reference laboratory  for testing.  The procedure for processing and 
preparing the sample for shipment is described fully  in the laboratory  manual, which will be 
provided to investigators.
A negative [COMPANY_003] test can be substituted for the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In -Tube test only  if 
the central laboratory  is unable to perform the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test or
cannot determine the results to be positive or negative and the [COMPANY_007] Medical Monitor 
approves it, on a case -by-case basis.
Japan only : While QuantiFERON®is the preferred testing method, the T-SPOT®.TBtest is 
also 
acceptable as the screening TB test .  Like QuantiFERON®, the T -SPOT®.TBtest is an in 
vitro diagnostic test for M.tuberculosis 
infection; however, it differs in that it uses a peptide 
cocktail of ESAT -6 and CFP -10 proteins to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 
T-SPOT®.TBtesting w ill be performed at the site’s local laboratory .  Borderline results from 
the T- SPOT®.TBtest should be considered exclusi onary .  If the T- SPOT.TBtest results are 
indeterminate, the test should be repeated.  If the result of the repeat test is indetermin ate, 
subjects may
 be screened using the Mantoux/[COMPANY_003] skin test with [COMPANY_007] Medical Monitor 
approval.
Purified Protein Derivative ([COMPANY_003]) Test
If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In- Tube test or the T -SPOT®.TBtest (Japan only ) cannot be 
performed, or if the results c annot be determined to be positive or negative, then subjects 
may be screened using the Purified Protein Derivative ([COMPANY_003]) Tuberculin Test (Mantoux 
method), with the approval of the [COMPANY_007] Medical Monitor. 
Subjects must have the [COMPANY_003] test administered and e valuated b y a health care professional

In the event of a suspec ted opportunistic infection, effort should be made to identify  the 
pathogen utilizing laboratory  or other methods appropriate to the clinical situation. 
In case of a suspected viral skin infection (eg, herpes zoster and herpes simplex or eczema 
herpeticum ), a specimen for viral DNA may  be analy zed locally  for confirmation and results 
provided to the adjudication committee to support evaluation. 
For subjects with a past history  of oral or genital HSV and a presentation consistent to prior 
infections, furth er laboratory  anal ysis may  be performed at the discretion of the investigator. 
7.4.Skin Type Assessment
As part of baseline characteristics, a skin ty pe assessment will be done at the Day 1 visit 
using the Fitzpatrick Skin Ty pe assessment (Refer to Appendix 5).  This is used to classify  a 
person’s skin ty pe by  [CONTACT_74088] (ie, burning or tanning).
7.5.Assessment of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior 
Subjects meeting exclusionary  results as described in 
Section 4.2 on the C -SSRS or PHQ -8 
should be excluded from participation; it is recommended the subject’s primary care 
physician (PCP) should be informed, and the subject referre d to a mental health professional, 
either b y the PCP or the investigator according to their usual practice.
7.5.1. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)
The Columbia Suicide Severit y Rating Scale is a validated tool for investigative staff to use 
to eva luate suicidal ideation and behavior ( Appendix 15).18  At the screening visit, if there 
are “y es” answers on items [ADDRESS_531261]’s eligibility based on the ans wers.
7.5.2. Patient Health Questionnaire - 8 items (PHQ -8)
The Patient Health Questionnaire –8 items ( Appendix 16) is a patient -reported questionnaire 
consisting of [ADDRESS_531262]’s depression level.  
At Screening Visit, if PHQ -8

7.8. Efficacy Assessments
7.8.1. Rater Qualifications
Clinical evaluations of atopic dermatitis will be performed by a n experienced and qualified
dermatologist (board certified or equivalent). An experienced a nd qualified 
non-dermatologist physician or experienced medical professional  with experience in the
conduct of AD clinical trials may be permitted to perform the cl inical evaluations of atopic
dermatitis when designated by [CONTACT_420999].  T he evaluator must receive and 
document protocol specific and applicable efficacy assessment s cales training prior to 
performing these evaluations.  To assure consistency and reduce variability, the same
evaluator must assess all dermatological clinical evaluations f or any individual subject
throughout the study whenever possible ; a back-up experienced and qualified,

The Investigator’s Global Assessment of atopic dermatitis is scored on a 5 -point scale (0 -4), 
reflecting a global consideration of the ery thema, indu ration and scaling.  The clinical 
evaluator of atopic dermatitis will perform an assessment of the overall severity  of atopic 
dermatitis and assign an IGA score and category  as described in Table 2.  The assessment
will be a static evaluation without regard to the score at a previous visit.

The IGA will exclude scalp, palms, and soles from the assessment/scoring.
7.8.3. SCORAD
SCORAD is a validated scoring index for atopic dermatitis, which combin es extent (0 -100), 
severit y (0-18), and subjective sy mptoms (0 -20) based on pruritus and sleep loss, each scored 
using a visual analog scale (0 -10). 
Extent (A, maximum score of 100%)
To determine extent of AD, rule of 9 is used to calculate bod y surface a rea affected by  [CONTACT_421000] 
a percentage of the whole body  surface area.  Body  surface area as percentage of total body  
surface area for each body  region is as follows:
Head and neck 9%; 
Upper limbs 9% each; 
Lower limbs 18% each; 

PF-04965842
B7451029
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019
Page 97Anterior trunk 18%; 
Back 18% ; 
1% for genitals. 
The score for each bod y region is added up to determine the BSA affected by  [CONTACT_22802] (A), which 
has a possible maximum score of 100%. 
Severity (B, maximum score of 18)
A representative area of AD is selected.  In this area, the severit y of each of the following 
signs is assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) or severe (3). 
Erythema (reddening);
Edema (swelling)/papulation;
Oozing/crusting; 
Excoriation (scratch marks);
Skin thickening (lichenification); 
Xerosis (dry ness) (this is ass essed in an area where there is no inflammation).
The severit y scores are added together to give 'B' (maximum score of 18).
Subjective Symptoms (C, maximum score of 20)
Subjective sy mptoms, ie, itch and sleep loss, are each scored by  [CONTACT_421001] a visual analog scale (VAS) where “0” is no itch (or no sleep loss) and “10” is the 
worst imaginable itch (or sleep loss).  The value for each should reflect the average on a 
[ADDRESS_531266] 3 days/nights.  These scores are added to gi ve 'C' (maximum score 
of20). 
SCORAD Total Score
The SCORAD for an individual is calculated b y the formula: A/5 + 7B/2 + C (can range 
from 0 to 103).
7.8.4. Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)
The EASI quantifies the severit y of a subject’s atopic dermatitis b ased on both severity  of 
lesion clinical signs and the percent of BSA affected.  EASI is a composite scoring b y the 
atopic dermatitis clinical evaluator of the degree of ery thema, induration/papulation, 
excoriation, and lichenification (each scored separat ely) for each of four body  regions, with

Lesion Severity by [CONTACT_74092]: The basic characteristics of atopic dermatitis 
lesions -erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification- provide a means for 
assessing the severit y of lesions.  Assessment of these four main clinical signs is performed 
separately  for four body  regions: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (includi ng axillae and 
groin) and lower limbs (including buttocks).  Average ery thema, induration/papulation, 
excoriation, and lichenification are scored for each body  region according to a 4- point scale:

The EASI will exclude scalp, palms, and soles from the assessment/scoring.
Percent BSA with Atopic Dermatitis: The number of handprints of skin afflicted with 
atopic dermatitis in a body region can be used to determine the extent (%) to which a bod y 
region is involved with atopic dermatitis ( Table 4).  When measuring, the handprint unit 
refers to the size of each individual subject’s hand with fingers in a closed position.

The EASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0  to 72.0, with higher scores 
representing greater severity of atopic dermatitis.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Body Surface Area – Efficacy (BSA Efficacy)
BSA Efficacy will be derived from the sum of the BSA in handpri nts across 4 body regions 
assessed as part of the EASI assessment ( Table 4 ).  Handprint refers to that of each 
individual subject for their own measurement.  The BSA Efficacy  ranges from 0 to 
100%, with higher values representing greater severity of atopic  dermatitis.  Since the scalp, 
palms, and soles will be excluded from the BSA (Efficacy) asses sment, the maximum 
possible value will be less than 100%.

In selected countries, subjects will complete the PROs at the c linic prior to other clinical 
activities and investigational product administration.  The PRO s should be checked for 
completeness by [CONTACT_421002].  Compliance with scheduled PROs activities will be monitored.  Delegated site 
staff will oversee the administration of PROs at site visits to  ensure protocol compliance.  
Subjects are given a handheld device to complete the Pruritus N RS, PSAAD  
 according to the Schedule of Activities .  Delegated site staff will review 
compliance at each visit and counsel as appropriate.  If a subj ect has repeated 
non-compliance, the subject should be re-trained on the device.   If a subject is unable to 
complete the PROs on the handheld device due to documented diff iculty using the 
technological devices or other limitation, the subject will be permitted to enter or remain in 
the study.  In the event of electronic malfunction, a replaceme nt device will be shipped to the 
site. 
Examples of the validated paper versions of Patient Reported Ou tcomes instruments are 
included in the Appendices of this protocol.  In instances wher e an electronic device is used 
to collect the PRO data, the electronic version may differ slig htly in format or wording 
compared with the paper version to facilitate electronic implem entation.

8.1. Requirements
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording safet y events on the CRF and for 
reporting safety events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adve rse Event (SAE) Report Form 
to [COMPANY_007] Safety.  These requirements are delineated for 3 type s of events: (1) SAEs; 
(2) non-serious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the in vestigational product under 
study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational expos ure. 
Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE 
Report Form to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety Within [ADDRESS_531273] under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposureAll (regardless of whether 
associated with an AE), 
except occupational 
exposureExposure during pregnancy, 
exposure via breastfeeding, occupational exposure (regardless of whether associated with an AE)
All observed or volunteered events regardless of treatment grou p or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported  as described in the following 
paragraphs.
Events listed in the table above that require reporting to Pfiz er Safety on the CT SAE Report 
Form within [ADDRESS_531274] be made immediately, irrespe ctive of the extent of available 
event information.  This timeframe also applies to additional n ew (follow-up) information on 
previously forwarded reports.  In the rare situation that the i nvestigator does not become 
immediately aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigat or must report the event 
within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of hi s/her first awareness of the 
event.CCI
PF-[ADDRESS_531275] pursue and obtain adequate informa tion both to 
determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
(see the Serious Adverse Events section below).  In addition, the investigator may  be 
requested b y [COMPANY_007] Safety  to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion.  
This information is more detailed than that recorded on the CRF .  In general, this will include 
a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assess ment of 
the case and independent determination of possible causalit y.  An y information relevant to 
the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided.  I n the case of a 
subject death, a summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible 
to [COMPANY_007] Safety .  An y pertinent additional information must be reported on the CT SAE 
Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory  data) are to 
be sent to [COMPANY_007] Safet y ONLY upon request.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y non -serious AE that is 
determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by [CONTACT_74094].  To assist 
in the determination of case seriousness, further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study .
8.1.1. Additional Details on Recording Adverse Events on the CRF
All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  It 
should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the 
same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical 
terminology  and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report 
Form for reporting of SAE information.
8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  
reported b y the stud y subject.  In addition, each study subject will be questioned about the 
occurrence of AEs in a non -leading manner.
8.1.3. Withdrawal from the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also the Subject 
Withdrawal section)
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF. 
When a subject withdraws from the study  because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on 
theCRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the 
Requirements section above.

Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019
Page 1068.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information
The time period for actively  eliciting and collecting A Es and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each subject begins from the time the subject provides informed consent, which 
is obtained before the subject’s participation in the study  (ie, before undergoing any  
study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including a 
minimum of 28 calendar days; except as indicated below after the last administration of the 
investigational product.
For subjects who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure 
status is determined.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_007] Safety
All SAEs occurring in a subject during the active collection period are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form.
SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are r eported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety .
Follow up by  [CONTACT_421005] a level acceptable to the investigator, and 
[COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Non -serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF
During the active collection period, both non-serious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the 
CRF.
Follow -up by  [CONTACT_47610] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concur s with that assessment.
8.1.5. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such 
an assessment in accordance wit h the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.  An 
investigator’s causalit y assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generall y the facts 
(evidence) o
r arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.  If the 
investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then 
the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as 
defined b y the sponsor.  If the investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not 
related” to investigational product, this should be clearl y documented on study  records. 

PF-[ADDRESS_531276] SAE Report Form and in 
accordance with the SAE reporting requirements.
8.1.6. Sponsor’s Repor ting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.
8.2.Definitions
8.2.1. Adverse Events
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a study  subject administered a product or 
medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment 
or usage.  Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant signs and sy mptoms;
Changes in ph ysical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease; 
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , AEs may  include signs and s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error;

B7451029
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019
Page 108Occupational exposure.
8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings
Abnormal objective test findings should be recorded as AEs when an y of the following 
conditions are met: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing (outside of an y protocol -specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
recording as an AE.
8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Or that is considered to be:
An important medical event.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediate ly life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as se rious.

PF-04965842
B7451029
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019
Page 109Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.2.4. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_420969] y initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31009] , or any  prolongation of an existing admission.  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg , from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit is assessed for medical importance.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593];
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (eg, caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/sa me-day/ambulatory  procedures).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_74039].  Examples include:
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
developme nt of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
workup of a persistent pretreatment laboratory  abnormality );
Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);
Protocol-specified admission during a stud y (eg, for a procedure required by [CONTACT_43038] y 
protocol);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE;

PF-04965842
B7451029
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019
Page 110Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject.
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reporte d as SAEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE.  For example, an acute 
appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE 
requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the 
AE.
8.3.Severity Assessment
If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the adjectives MILD, 
MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE.  For purposes of 
consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual fun ction.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as se rious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, listed above.
8.4.Special Situations
8.4.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study.  All SAEs will be reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  by [CONTACT_74096], and will be handled as SAEs in 
the safet y database. 
8.4.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury  (as determined by  [CONTACT_20023]) are termed “tolerators,” while th ose who show transient liver injury , but adapt 
are termed “adaptors.”  In some subjects, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more 
serious potential outcome.  These subjects fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to 
progressive and serious l iver injury , commonly  referred to as drug -induced liver injury  
(DILI).  Subjects who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of 
normal ( ×ULN) should be monitored more frequently  to determine if they are an “adaptor” 
or are “susce ptible.”
In the majority  of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 ×ULN) by  [CONTACT_74097].  The increase in TBili ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y occurs while AST/A LT is/are still elevated 
above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample).  

PF-[ADDRESS_531277]/ALT values might have 
decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a p otential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal 
elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below 
are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be 
considered important medical events, ev en before all other possible causes of liver injury  
have been excluded.
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the subject’s 
individual baseline values and underl ying conditions.  Subjects who present with the 
follow ing laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) 
cases to definitivel y determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory  values:
Subjects with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values within the normal range who 
subsequently  present with AST OR AL T values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value 
>2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value 
<2×ULN or not available;
For subjects with baseline AST OR ALT OrTBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, 
depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AND >3
× ULN; or >8 × ULN (whiche ver is 
smaller).
Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from 
baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN or if the value reaches >3 ×ULN 
(whichever is smaller).
Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed 
individually  based on clinical judgment; any  case where uncertainty  remains as to whether it 
represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor.
The subject should return to the investigator site and be evalu ated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within [ADDRESS_531278] and AL T and TBili, labor atory  tests should 
include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl 
transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile 
acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or prot ein adduct levels.  
Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an 
anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous 
analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology .  A detailed 
history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y 
itself or as a co -formulated product in prescription or over- the-counter medications), 

PF-04965842
B7451029
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019
Page 112recreational drug, supplement (herbal) us e and consumption, family  history , sexual history , 
travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history  
of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be 
collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging 
(eg, biliary  tract) may  be warranted. 
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria of AST/AL T and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no 
other reason for the liver function test (LFT) abnormalities has y et been found.  Such 
potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability 
of all the results of the investigations p erformed to determine etiology of the LFT 
abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology .
8.4.3. Exposure to the Investigat ional Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and 
Occupational Exposure
Exposure to the investigational product under study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding and 
occupational exposure are reportable to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within 24 hours of investigator 
aware ness.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  (EDP) occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of tre atment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product .
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direc t contact 
[CONTACT_4490] a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product pr ior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy . 
If a subject or subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the subject’s 
treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report th is information to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of 
whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information 
regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant wom an (eg, a subject 
reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by [CONTACT_31061][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) to [COMPANY_007] Safety  using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective

Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019
Page 113of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awa reness of the exposure.  The 
information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for 
information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural 
integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural 
integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless 
pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are 
reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported to [COMPANY_007] Safet y as SAEs 
follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_531279] ;
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  [CONTACT_456].  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, 
the investigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of 
Information Form to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the 
source documents that the subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of 
Information Form to provide to his partner.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Breastfeeding
Scenarios of exposure during breas tfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of 
an associated SAE, to [COMPANY_007] Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the 
CT SAE Report Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a [COMPANY_007] 
drug specifi cally  approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in 
accord with authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such 
a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breas tfeeding.

Page 1148.4.3.3. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurr ence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated 
SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrol led in the study , the 
information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy  of the completed CT SAE Report 
Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.4.4. Medication Errors 
Other exposures to the investigational product under study  may  occur in clinical trial settings, 
such as medication errors.

Medication errors may  result from the administration or consumption of the investigational 
product b y the wrong subject, or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. 
Medication errors include :
Medication errors involving sub ject exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject;
Refer to Section 5.[ADDRESS_531280].
Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medication 
error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page.
In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately .
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error is recorded on the medication error pag e of the CRF and, if 
applicable, an y associated AE(s), serious and non -serious, are recorded on an AE page of the

8.4.5. Medical Device Incidents (Including Malfunctions)
Medical devices are being provided for use in this study  for the purposes of subcutaneous 
injection of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420970].  In order to fulfill regulatory  reporting 
obligations worldwide, the investig ator is responsible for the detection and documentation of 
events meeting the definitions of incident or malfunction that occur during the study  with 
such devices.
The definition of a medical device incident can be found in Appendix 17.
NOTE: Incidents fulfilling the definition of an AE/SAE will also follow the processes 
outlined in Section 8 of the protocol.
[IP_ADDRESS].
Time Period for Detecting Medical Device Incidents
Medical devi ce incidents or malfunctions of the device that result in an incident will be 
detected, documented, and reported during all periods of the study  in which the medical 
device is used.
If the investigator learns of an y incident at an y time after a participant has been discharged 
from the study , and such incident is considered reasonably  related to a medical device 
provided for the stud y, the investigator will promptly  notify  the sponsor.
The method of documenting medical device incidents is provided in Appendix 17.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Follow -up of Medical Device Incidents
All medical device incidents involving an AE will be followed and reported in the same 
manner as other AEs (see Section 8).  This applies to all participants, including those who 
discontinue study  intervention.
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow- up includes an y supplemental 
investigations as indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality  of the incident .
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally  completed form with all 
changes signed and dated by  [CONTACT_093].
[IP_ADDRESS]. Prompt Reporting of Medical Device Incidents to Sponsor
Medical device incidents will be reported to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_531282] and Medical Device Complaint Submission Form will be 
completed.

The investigator will promptly  report all incidents occurring with any  medical device 
provided for use in the study  in order for the sponsor to fulfill the legal responsibility  to 
notify  appropriate regulatory  authorities and other enti ties about certain safety  information 
relating to medical devices being used in clinical studies.
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements (eg, the head of the 
medical institution), will comply  with the applicable local regul atory  requirements relating to 
the reporting of incidents to the I RB/EC.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study  
is outlined here and further detailed in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be 
maintained by  [CONTACT_456].  The SAP may  modify  what is outlined in the protocol where 
appropriate; however, any  major modifications of the co -primary  endpoint definitions or their 
analyses will also be reflected in a prot ocol amendment.
9.1.Sample Size Determination
A total sample of 700 subjects, with 200 subjects randomized to PF -04965842 200 mgQD, 
200subjects randomized to PF -04965842 100 mg QD, 200 subjects randomized to 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24767] 50 subjects each randomized to two sequences of matching placebo for 
16weeks followed b y (a) PF -04965842 100 mg QD and by  (b) PF -04965842 200 mgQD 
(4:4:4:1:1 randomization) is planned. The two placebo sequences will be combined for 
purposes of analy ses at all visits up to and including We ek16, which would essentially  result 
in a 2:2:2:[ADDRESS_531283] 96% power to detect a 
difference of at least 20% in IGA response rate between either dose of PF -04965842 and 
placebo, assuming the placebo response rate is 12% at Week 12.  This will also provide at 
least 99% power to detect a difference of at least 30% in EASI -75 response rate between 
either dose of PF- 04965842 and placebo, assuming the placebo response rate is 23% at 
Week 12.
For a given dose (PF -04965842 200mg QD or 100 mg QD), both co -primary  endpoints must 
achieve statistical significance to meet the primary objective.
In addition, this sample size will also provide at least 92% power to detect a difference of at 
least 
15% in the proportion of subjects with a  4points improvement in the severit y of 
pruritus NRS between PF -04965842 and dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], assuming the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_420915] 
18% at Week 2.
The T ype-I error rate is set at 5% (two -sided). The family wise Ty pe-I error rate (for testing 
the co- primary  and key  secondary  endpoints) will be strongl y controlled at 5% using a 
closed-testing method based on a sequential, iterative Bonferroni- type approach as outlined 
below.

PF-[ADDRESS_531284] ively evaluate 
the benefit -risk of PF -04965842 in conjunction with the other studies in the clinical 
development program, therefore the power for the co- primary  endpoints is relatively  high.   
This sample size will also help ensure adequate power is maintai ned for testing all the 
co-primary  and key  secondary  endpoints for both doses of PF -04965842 via the multiple 
testing procedure.
9.2.Efficacy Analysis
9.2.1. Analysis Sets 
The primary  anal ysis population for efficacy  data will be the Full Anal ysis Set (FAS) defined 
as all randomized subjects receiving at least one dose of investigational product.  The 
primary  efficacy  endpoint and the key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints will also be anal yzed for 
the Per -Protocol Anal ysis Set (PPAS) defined as a subset of FAS who had no major protocol 
violations.  Major protocol violations would consist of not meeting inclusion criteria or 
meeting exclusion cr iteria or not having taken the correct randomized treatment for at least 
80% of the assigned amount or not having adhered to standardized background topi[INVESTIGATOR_420912] y guidelines or having taken a protocol- prohibited concomitant medication or any  
other major protocol violation as determined b y the clinical team or medical monitor prior to 
database lock.  The subjects excluded from the PPAS will be determined and documented 
before the study  is un -blinded.  For all anal yses, baseline value will be based on observations 
collected pre -dose. 
It is expected that the FAS as defined he re will be identical to a true intent to t reat (ITT) 
analysis set (randomized and dispensed study  medication) because the first dose is 
administered in -clinic. Nevertheless ,any differences from ITT in terms of the number of 
subjects will be noted and summarized.
9.2.2. Testing Procedure for Multiple Comparisons
The famil ywise T ype-I error rate for testing the co -primary  and key  secondary  endpoints will 
be strongl y controlled at 5% using a sequential, Bonferroni -based iterative multiple testing 
procedure. 
The procedure will first test the co -primary  endpoints (I GA and EASI -75 at Week 12 for 
200mgQD vs placebo) at the 5% level.  If this hy pothesis is not rejected, then all subsequent 
hypotheses will not be considered statistically  significant.  If this hy pothesis is rejected, then 
testing for statistical significance will continue for the co- primary  endpoints (IGA and 
EASI -75 at Week 12) for the 100 mg QD vs placebo comparison. If this hypothesis is not 
rejected, then all subsequent hy pothes es will not be considered statistically  significant .  If 
this hy pothesis is rejected, then testing may  continue as follows:
A series of h ypotheses related to the severit y of pruritus at Week 2 will be tested at 
the 2.5% level in the order specified in Sequ ence A.  If all h ypotheses in Sequence A 
are rejected, then the unused alpha level of 2.5% will be passed on to the testing for 
the Week 16 endpoints in the order specified in Sequence B at a 5% significance level 

PF-04965842
B7451029
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019
Page 118(see figure be low).  All subsequent h ypotheses from any point where a h ypothesis 
cannot be rejected will not be considered statistically  significant .
If any hypothesis in Sequence A cannot be rejected at the 2.5% level, then testing for 
statistical significance will st op along this sequence but will continue for the 
hypotheses related to the Week 16 endpoints in the order specified in Sequence B at 
the 2.5% level.  If all hy potheses in Sequence B are rejected, then the unused alpha 
level of 2.5% will be passed back for testing the hy potheses in Sequence A at the 
5%level.  All subsequent hy potheses from an y point where a h ypothesis cannot be 
rejected will not be considered statisticall y significant .

The figure above illustrates the procedure sho wing the sequence of the tests.
9.2.3. Analysis of the Primary Endpoints 
The co -primary  endpoints will be analy zed using the (Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel) test 
adjusted by  [CONTACT_421006] (moderate andsevere) and for a given dose both 
must achieve statistical significance to meet the primary  objective.  The difference between 
each active group and the placebo group in the proportion of subjects achieving IGA 
response (similarly for EASI -75) along wi th its 95% confidence interval (using the normal 
approximation for the difference in binomial proportions) will be reported.  If a subject 
withdraws from the study , then this subject will be counted as non -responder for endpoints 
after withdrawal.

B7451029
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019
Page 119Additi onal secondary  analy ses will utilize missing at random (MAR) and missing not at 
random (MNAR) approaches.   Missing observations will be multiply  imputed using a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_420971] d ata 
mechanism is MAR or more generall y, is MNAR. A longitudinal logit
-normal mixed model 
will be fit using only  the observed data. Under the MAR framework, imputations will be 
based on the posterior predictive probability  of response obtained from the posterior 
distribution under the mixed model. Under an MNAR framework, imputations f or the active 
treatment groups will be based on a linear combination of the posterior predictive probability  
of respon se for the active group and the placebo group . For eac h such complete d dataset, the 
estimates of the proportions and Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) -weighted difference of 
proportions between each active dose group and placebo will be obtained and Rubin’s rule 
will be used to combine the multiple estimates and standard errors across the imputed 
datasets and provide p -value s.
9.2.4. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
The key  secondary  endpoints which are summarized as proportions such as EASI -75, and the 
proportion of subjects achieving a 4 -point improvement from baseline in the severit y of 
Pruritus NRS measure will be anal yzed using the same method as for the co- primary  
endpoints.  This would also apply  to an y other binary  endpoint in the study , such as the 
response based on subjects reported with PtGA of AD of clear (0) or almost clear (1) and 
2point improvement from baseline over [ADDRESS_531285] model with repeated measures (MMRM) 
wil
l be used.  This model will include the factors (fixed effects) for treatment group, disease 
severit y group, visit, treatment -by-visit interaction, and relevant baseline value.  Within the 
framework of MMRM, the treatment difference will be tested at the p re-specified primary  
time point, Week 12, as well as at the other time points by  [CONTACT_7206] -specific contrasts from 
the MMRM model. 
9.3.Safety Analysis
The safet y data will be summarized in accordance with [COMPANY_007] Data Standards.  All subjects 
who receive inve stigational product (safet y population) will be included in the safet y 
analyses.  All safety  data will be summarized descriptively  through appropriate data 
tabulations, descriptive statistics, categorical summaries, and graphical presentations.  Safety  
endpoints for the study  include:
Treatment -emergent AEs and SAEs;
Withdrawals from active treatment due to AEs;
Serious infections, defined as an y infection (viral, bacterial, and fungal) requiring

lipid profiles);
Vital signs;
ECG parameters if applicable.
Change from baseline on laboratory  data and vital signs will be additionally  summarized.
9.4.External Data Monitoring Committee 
This study  will use an external data monitoring committee (E- DMC ).  The E -DMC will be 
responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safet y of subjects in the study  according to the 
charter.  The recommendations made by  [CONTACT_941] E -DMC to alter the conduct of the stud y will be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007] for final decision.  [COMPANY_007] will forward such decisions, which may  include 
summaries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of safet y data that are not endpoints, 
to regulatory  authorities, as appropriate.  Composition o f the E -DMC and processes under 
which the E -DMC operates will be documented in the E -DMC charter.
9.5.Safety Adjudication Committees
To help assess the specific, complex safet y events related to malignancies, cardiovascular 
events, and opportunistic infection (including eczema herpeticum and other infections of 
special interest) in this study , Safet y Adjudication Committees, consisting of clinical experts 
in each of the relevant clinical areas, will be set up to harmonize and standardize 
assessments.  In order to allow for an unbiased safety  assessment, the members of these 
committees will be blinded to treatment assignment.  Further information about the Safety  
Adjudication Committees can be found in their respective charters, including a specific 
description o f the scope of their responsibilities, a plan where communication timelines are 
defined, and the exact process and definitions used by  [CONTACT_74098] y events that they will adjudicate.  Other safety  events for adjudication may  be id entified 
and included in the remit of the Safet y Adjudication Committees as appropriate.
9.6.Week [ADDRESS_531286] in the study  has the opportunity  to complete the 
Week 16 visit.  The Week 16 Analy sis will constitute as the final anal ysis for the co- primary  
and key  secondary  endpoints, and the overall family -wise Ty pe1 error will be controlled as 
specified i n Section 9.2.2 . The conclusions with regards to the co -primary  endpoints and the 
secondary  endpoints will be based on this anal ysis, and hence the overall family -wise Ty pe
1 
error for this study is maintained. The results from the Week 16 Anal ysis will not be used to 
make decisions for modifying the stud y design or for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_271436] y.  Access to the 
database containing individual treatment group assignments will be restricted to the sponsor 
study  team at the time of Week 16 Anal ysis.  Study  sites, investigators and subjects will not 
be unblinded.  

PF-04965842
B7451029
Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019
Page 121The purpose of the Week 16 Analy sis is to accelerate final reporting timeline. The final 
clinical study  report ( CSR) for the stud y will be based on the results from the Week [ADDRESS_531287] to ensure that 
the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate.  The 
investigator and in stitution will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate 
regulatory  authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  This 
verification may  also occur after study  completion.
During stud y conduct and/or after study  completion, the investigator site may  be subject to 
review b y the IRB/EC, and/or to quality  assurance audits performed by  [CONTACT_4618], or companies 
working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by  [CONTACT_8901].
The investi gator(s) will notify  [COMPANY_007] or its agents immediately  of any  regulatory  inspection 
notification in relation to the study .  Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] 
or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will a llow [COMPANY_007] or its 
agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection.  The investigator site and 
investigator will promptly resolve an y discrepancies that are identified between the stud y 
data and the subject's medical records.  The investigato r will promptl y provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_74040].  Before response submission to the regulatory 
authorities, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an opportunity  to review 
and comment on responses to any  such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Repor t Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be com pleted for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].  The investigator shall ensure that the 
CRFs/DCTs are securel y stored at the study site in encrypted electronic and/or paper form 

PF-[ADDRESS_531288] protected or secured in a locked room to prevent access by  
[CONTACT_421007] d parties.
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they  are accurate, authentic/ original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the 
data contained on the CRFs are true.  A ny corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153833].  In these
cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF may  also serve as the source document.  In these cases, a document 
should be available at the investigator site and at [COMPANY_007] that clearl y identifies those data that 
will be recorded on the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory authorities or [COMPANY_007], the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the ident ity of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed 
informed consent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safet y reporting forms, source documents, 
and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The records should 
be retained b y the investigator according to the ICH guidelines, according to local 
regulations, or as specified i n the clinical study  agreement (CSA), whichever is longer.  The 
investigator must ensure that the records continue to be stored securel y for so long as they are 
retained.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007], such as another 
investigator, another institution, or an independent third party  arranged b y [COMPANY_007]. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_531289] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before dispos ing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.

PF-[ADDRESS_531290]/Ethics Committee
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent docu ments, and other relevant documents, 
eg,recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] I RB/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circum stance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, legal and regulatory  
requirements, and the general principles set forth in the I nternational Ethical Guidelines for 
Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of 
Medical Sciences 2002), ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and the Declaration of 
Helsinki.
12.3. Subject Information and Consent
All parties will comply  with all applicable laws, including laws regarding the implementation 
of organizational and technical measures to ensure protection of subject personal data.  Such 
measures will include omitting subject names or other directl y identifiable data in an y 
reports, publications, or other disclosures, except where required b y applicable law. 
The personal data will be stored at the study  site in encry pted electronic and/or paper form 
and will be password protected or secured in a locked room to ensure that only  authorized 
study  staff have access.  The study  site will implement appropriate technical and 
organizational measures to ensure that the personal data can be recovered in the event of 
disaster.  In the event of a potential personal data breach, the study  site shall be responsible 
for determining whether a personal data breach has in fact occurred and, if so, providing 
breach notifications as required by  [CONTACT_2371].
To protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of 
personal data, when study  data are compi[INVESTIGATOR_168024], subject names will be removed and will be replaced b y a single, specific numerical 
code, based on a numbering s ystem defined by  [CONTACT_4618].  All other identifiable data transferred 
to [COMPANY_007] or other authorized parties will be identified by  [CONTACT_20007], subject- specific code.   
The investigator site will maintain a confidential list of subjects who participated in the 
study , linking each subject’s numerical code to his or her actual identity .  In case of data 
transfer, Pf izer will maintain high standards of confidentiality  and protection of subjects’ 
personal data consistent with the Clinical Study  Agreement and applicable privacy  laws.

PF-[ADDRESS_531291] be reviewed and approved by  [CONTACT_161699] r, approved by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC 
before use, and available for inspection. 
The investigator must ensure that each study  subject is fully  informed about the nature and 
objectives of the stud y, the sharing of data relating to the stud y and possible risks associate d 
with participation, including the risks associated with the processing of the subject’s personal 
data.  The investigator further must ensure that each study  subject is fully  informed about his 
or her right to access and correct his or her personal data a nd to withdraw consent for the 
processing of his or her personal data. 
The investigator, or a person designated b y the investigator, will obtain written informed 
consent from each subject before any  study -specific activity  is performed.  The investigator 
will retain the original of each subject's signed consent document.
12.4. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable

Medical Device Incident Definition
A medical device incident is any  malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics 
and/or performance of a de vice as well as an y inadequacy in the labeling or the 
instructions for use which, directly or indirectl y, might lead to or might have led to 
the death of a participant/user/other person or to a serious deterioration in his/her 
state of health.
Not all inci dents lead to death or serious deterioration in health.  The 
nonoccurrence of such a result might have been due to other fortunate 
circumstances or to the intervention of healthcare personnel.
It is sufficient that:
An incident associated with a device ha ppened.
AND
The incident was such that, if it occurred again, might lead to death or a serious 
deterioration in health.
A serious deterioration in state of health can include an y of the following:
Life-threatening illness;
Permanent impairment of body  func tion or permanent damage to bod y structure;
Condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above;
Fetal distress, fetal death, or an y congenital abnormality  or birth defects.

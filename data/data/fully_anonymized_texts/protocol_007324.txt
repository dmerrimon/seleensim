Protocol version: 02March2020 [ADDRESS_1137426] in cancer incide nce and sixth in cancer mortality in 
men. Prostate cancer growth is dependent on androgens, and depleting or blocking 
androgen action has been a mainstay of treatment for ove r 6 decades. Hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_820698]-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, and rogen receptor antagonists, 
ketoconazole, and estrogenic compounds. Tumors that progres s despi[INVESTIGATOR_820699]-resist ant. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_820700], castration-resist ant progression generally represents a 
transition to the lethal variant of the illness, and mo st patients ultimately succumb to this 
disease. The median survival of castration-resistant di sease is currently approximately 12 
months. 1 
 
Results of clinical investigations and studies on the molecula r profiles of these progressing 
tumors show that the androgen receptor (AR) remains funct ional and that the tumors should 
respond to strategies directed at the androgen receptor si gnaling axis. Overexpression of the 
AR has been documented in upwards of 50% of castration- resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) 
specimens and is believed to contribute to tumor progress ion. [ADDRESS_1137427] imulate androgen receptor 
signaling in the setting of AR overexpression, therefore exa cerbating or accelerating 
castration-resistant tumor growth. The decline in serum  levels of prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) seen upon discontinuation of these agents is consisten t with the agonist effects 
(“anti-androgen withdrawal syndrome”). 
 
In clinical practice, treatment of advanced prostate c ancer is therefore limited by [CONTACT_820726]-androgen therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Most  patients receive two or more 
hormonal manipulations and are then offered chemotherapy as they continue to progress. A 
randomized trial in metastatic castration-resistant p rostate cancer comparing docetaxel 
administered every three weeks vs. docetaxel weekly, vs.  mitoxantrone has shown a modest 
survival benefit for docetaxel every [ADDRESS_1137428] fruit of 
this labor and has recently been shown to substantial ly improve survival in patients with 
castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). 4-6  
 
This result provides proof of principle for the importan ce of targeting AR in prostate cancer 
therapy and produces an urgent need to clarify mechanism s that account for  response or 
eventual resistance to enzalutamide, which are largely unknown . A thorough mechanistic 
Protocol version: 02March2020 4 understanding of the molecular basis for enzalutami de’s clinical performance will be an 
enormous asset in optimizing the use of the drug. S uch understanding can yield rationally 
designed strategies to expand and extend the utilit y of the drug. Strategies to overcome 
resistance through novel interventions that interru pt emerging mechanisms of resistance are 
a particularly compelling long-term outcome. Equall y compelling are strategies to extend 
initial response by [CONTACT_820727].  
 
The purpose of this study is to determine mechanism s by [CONTACT_820728]-androgen enzalutamide. 4,5  This study provides a tremendous 
opportunity to leverage the molecular analytic reso urces of a recently funded Stand Up to 
Cancer (SU2C)/Prostate Cancer Foundation (PCF)/Amer ican Association for Cancer 
Research (AACR) Dream Team grant.  This Dream Team intends to deploy a broad array 
of analytical strategies to comprehensively clarify  the molecular basis of treatment 
resistance in prostate cancer.  A cartoon summarizi ng the major analytic efforts is shown 
below: 
 
 
 
2.2 Study Agent(s) 
 
Enzalutamide is a novel small molecule AR antagonis t selected for its activity  
against prostate cancer cells with overexpressed an drogen receptor. 5 Enzalutamide binds 
more tightly to the AR than does bicalutamide. Unli ke bicalutamide, Enzalutamide also 
inhibits AR function by [CONTACT_820729] (DNA) binding. Enzalutamide h as no known agonist activity when 
the androgen receptor is overexpressed.  Enzalutami de reduces androgen receptor-
dependent PSA release in bicalutamide-resistant pro state cancer cells. 
 
In a mouse xenograft model of castration-resistant prostate cancer using an androgen 
receptor overexpresssing cell line,  Enzalutamide t reatment resulted in a dose-dependent 
reduction in tumor volume (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 fo r mid- and high-dose groups vs. 

Protocol version: 02March2020 5 vehicle, respectively). 5  Enzalutamide treatment decreased tumor volume, result ing in 
unmeasurable tumors in 1/7 animals in the low-dose group an d 3/[ADDRESS_1137429] on tumor growth. 5 
 
In addition to the human AR, the targets for which measura ble binding was 
detected included the human progesterone receptor with a 50% inhibitory concentration 
(IC50) of 10–25 μM and the rat gamma amino butyric acid-gated chloride channel 
(IC50 = 2.6 μM; Ki = 2.1 μM [1.0 μg/mL]). Binding of  Enza lutamide at 25 μM to the 
human progesterone receptor was too weak to derive a inhi bition constant (Ki) value. No 
significant binding was detected with the remaining 70 recepto rs. 
 
The tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and antitumor activity of  Enzalutamide were 
studied in a multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation  study of  Enzalutamide in 140 patients 
with castration-resistant prostate cancer. 4 Patients were treated with  Enzalutamide at doses 
of 30–600 mg/day until disease progression or intolerable side effects developed. 
 
The antitumor activity of  Enzalutamide was assessed by  [CONTACT_447]-therapy changes in PSA, soft 
tissue and osseous disease, and circulating tumor cell ( CTC) count. PSA declines of ≥ 50% 
from baseline were observed in 62% of chemotherapy-naïve and 51%  of post-
chemotherapy patients. [ADDRESS_1137430]-
chemotherapy patients. 4 
 
Among the chemotherapy-naïve patients, there was evidence of  radiographic control (no 
progression) in 80% of patients with evaluable soft tiss ue disease and 63% of patients with 
bone lesions. [ADDRESS_1137431]-chemotherapy patients, there was evidence of  radiographic 
control in 65% of patients with evaluable soft tissue dis ease and 51% of patients with bone 
lesions. [ADDRESS_1137432]-chemot herapy patients. 4 
Enumeration of CTCs demonstrated that 91% of patients wit h favorable pretreatment 
counts (i.e., < 5 CTCs/7.5 mL of blood) maintained favora ble post-treatment counts, while 
49% of patients converted from unfavorable pretreatment co unts (i.e., ≥ 5 CTCs/7.5 mL of 
blood) to favorable post-treatment counts. 
 
At the highest dose of 600 mg/day, two of three subjects had  dose-limiting toxicities 
(seizure, rash, respectively). 4 One witnessed seizure at 360 mg/day and a possible seizur e at 
480 mg/day were also reported. No deaths and no other drug- related serious adverse events 
were reported. Fatigue was the most frequently repor ted adverse event, with dose-
dependent increases of Grade 3 fatigue (2% at 150, 10% at 240, 21%  at 360, and 20% at 
480 mg/day groups). The dose of 240 mg/day was defined as th e maximum tolerated dose.  
 
Enzalutamide was absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_820701], with maximum plasma 
concentration (Cmax) occurring approximately 30 minutes to 4 hours  after dosing. The t1/2 
in patients was approximately 1 week (range 3 to 13 days) and did not appear to be affected 
by [CONTACT_346037].  Enzalutamide plasma concentrations exhi bited a low degree of inter- and 
intra-subject variability and increased linearly with  dose. The PK remained linear with 
time, and there was no evidence of inhibition or autoinductio n of metabolism during 
chronic administration. In accordance with a 1 week t1/2, i t took approximately 1 month to 
reach steady state. The daily fluctuation in steady-stat e plasma concentrations (i.e., the 
difference between Cmax and minimum plasma concentration  [Cmin]) was low, and PK 
profiles approximated a constant infusion. At 160 mg/day, mea n plasma concentrations 
fluctuated between 12 μg/mL (Cmin) and 15 μg/mL (Cmax).

  2.3 Study and Dose Rationale 
 
 Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is the principal molecul ar signaling driver of prostate 
cancer progression and dissemination. 2,[ADDRESS_1137433] been proposed; they range from somatic receptor 
mutations of the receptor, receptor splice variants, t o a variety of up-stream alterations 
ranging from persistent endocrine ligand production, to par acrine or even autocrine ligand 
production, alterations in receptor cofactors, ligand- independent receptor activation, and 
others. 10-[ADDRESS_1137434] 
fruit of this labor and has recently been shown to sub stantially improve survival in patients 
with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). 4-6  
 
This result provides proof of principle for the importan ce of targeting AR in prostate cancer 
therapy and produces an urgent need to clarify the mecha nisms of response and resistance 
to MDV-3100, which are largely unknown. A thorough mechanistic unde rstanding of the 
molecular basis for MDV-3100’s clinical performance will b e an enormous asset in 
optimizing the use of the drug. Such understanding can yield ra tionally designed strategies 
to expand and extend the utility of the drug. Strategies to  overcome resistance through 
novel interventions that interrupt emerging mechanisms of resistance are a particularly 
compelling long-term outcome. Equally compelling are strateg ies to extend initial response 
by [CONTACT_820730].  
 
For our study, we will treat patients with 160mg PO QD of Enzalutamide. This is the FDA-
approved dose used in the recent randomized, placebo-control led phase III study that 
demonstrated a five month improvement in overall survival. 6 This dose was well-tolerated. 6

5.0 TREATMENT PLAN 
5.1 Enzalutamide 
 
All patients will receive Enzalutamide 160 mg (four 40 mg ca psules) administered orally 
once daily.  Enzalutamide can be taken with or without f ood.  Capsules are to be swallowed 
whole. Patients will record daily drug administration in a  drug diary for tracking purposes 
(see Appendix F for diary.) Treatment adjustments will b e at the discretion of the treating 
physician and are not a part of this study. See Section  6.0.  
 
5.2 Tumor Biopsy at Study Entry and at Disease Progression  
 
All subjects will undergo a tumor biopsy of a metastatic  site at study entry (prior to 
initiation of Enzalutamide) and after the time of progr ession. NOTE: Every effort should be 
made to biopsy NEW lesions if possible. Every effort s hould be made to perform the 
progression biopsy prior to discontinuation of Enzalutam ide treatment. 
 
The tumor biopsies for this study will be collected and  shipped via the established 
procedures described below from the University of Californi a, San Francisco, Stand Up to 
Cancer biopsy protocol CC#125519 (OHSU protocol #9204) -Radiolog ically Guided 
Biopsies Of Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate  Cancer To Identify Adaptive 
Mechanisms of Resistance. 
 
All subjects participating in this protocol will also b e enrolled in the study referenced 
above. A separate consent will be obtained for this. 
 
In all subjects, an image-guided (CT or ultrasound) core bone or soft tissue biopsy will be 
performed (please see Appendix B for more details about this procedure). Patients will be 
consented to the appropriate procedure prior to biopsy.  All screening imaging for patients 
will be reviewed for eligibility/feasibility of the tum or biopsy. Lesions will be chosen based 
upon the strength of the evidence suggesting the presence of metastasis and with the goal of 
minimizing patient risk. New soft tissue or bone lesions o f existing lesions with 
documented radiologic progression should be prioritized fo r biopsy. If the Radiologist in 
charge of the procedure cannot identify a lesion amenable f or biopsy, the patient will be 
considered a screening failure. 
 
The biopsies will be performed in an interventional r adiology suite with radiological 
guidance (typi[INVESTIGATOR_255924]) in accordance with the  standard operating procedure in 
Appendix B  and institutional standards. CT or MRI will confirm de signated lesions 
immediately prior to biopsy. Once the target lesion(s) identified, six (6) to eight (8) biopsies 
will be performed. Preferably, a 16 gauge Bonopty TM  needle or biopsy needle with an 
equivalent 16g bore will be used to biopsy the metastat ic lesion. If the lesion is a bone 
metastasis, the Bonopty needle will be passed through the  cortical bone and into the target 
lesion. Optimal results are obtained when the biopsies are performed on medulary bone 
directly adjacent to blastic lesion. Soft tissue biops ies should be taken so that a core of 
Protocol version: 02March2020 11  approximately 10 to 20 mm in length is obtained. Core biops ies will be extracted: [ADDRESS_1137443] (Optimal Cutting Temperature compound used for  frozen sections), covered 
with additional OCT, and kept on dry ice or at -80  C (see Appendix B). 
 
Please see Appendix B  for the handling of these tissues. 
 
5.3 Definition of Progression for Biopsy upon Progression  
 
Radiographic progression: 
a)  Soft tissue progression: by [CONTACT_393] v1.[ADDRESS_1137444] 
time after Week 12 does not require confirmation. 
and/or 
 
b)  Bone scan progression: The appearance of ≥ [ADDRESS_1137445] be confirmed 
by a second bone scan performed 6 or more weeks later. T he confirmatory 
bone scan should show > [ADDRESS_1137446] time after the 
Week 12 reassessment should be confirmed by a second asse ssment performed 
6 or more weeks later. Confirmatory scans should show > 2 new lesions 
compared to the prior reassessment. 
 
c)  If the investigator’s clinical assessment based on patie nt symptoms, laboratory data, 
and radiographs suggests the patient may still be clinic ally benefitting the patient may 
continue on treatment beyond protocol defined radiographic pr ogression.. Every 
attempt should be made to obtain a biopsy when the decisi on is made to discontinue 
Enzalutamide. 
 
Clinical progression 
d)  Clinical progression at investigator’s discretion.  If cli nical progression is the only 
trigger for biopsy, tumor assessment by [CONTACT_114478]/ abdomen/pelvis and Bone scan 
should be obtained prior to biopsy. (The CT and Bone scan  does not need to be 
repeated if scans were done within 30 days.)  
 
Note that PSA progression alone does not meet criteria f or the progression-triggered 
biopsy. However, if the investigator plans to change thera py due to PSA progression a 
biopsy may be obtained.  
 
Every attempt should be made to obtain the progression b iopsy. If in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_820705]’s progression biopsy cannot be pe rformed the reason will be 
documented and the subject will continue to be followed pe r protocol.  
 
5.4 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Gu idelines 
 
Patients should receive supportive care. This includes antibiotics, anti-emetics, pain 
Protocol version: 02March2020 12  medications, and bone targeted therapy. Growth factors ( GCSF or Erythropoietin) or 
transfusion with blood products are allowed as long as these  cytopenias are not felt to be 
related to Enzalutamide. Please also see section 8.2.  
 
 5.5 Banking of Specimens for Potential Future Research  
 
Specimens collected and any serum/plasma will be banked f or future research under the 
“Master Protocol for Cancer Research Specimen Bank a nd Database” (OHSU IRB 2816), 
and will be used to search for biomarkers of response and resistance to therapy.  Future 
research may include genetic research. 
 
  5.6 Duration of Treatment 
Subjects will remain on Enzalutamide treatment until afte r progression-triggered biopsy, 
unacceptable toxicity (including any seizures), any adver se event that is intolerable to the 
subject and cannot be ameliorated by [CONTACT_820734] m edical intervention or that in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_820706], 
withdrawal of consent or if the physician feels it is i n the best interest of the subject to 
discontinue therapy. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_1137447] an adverse event(s) related to study trea tment (biopsy or Enzalutamide) 
will be followed until resolution or stabilization of t he adverse event. Subjects who 
discontinue Enzalutamide treatment prior to confirmed ra diographic progression will be 
followed for progression free survival and overall survival .  All subjects will be followed 
for overall survival. See Section 10.3

Subjects requiring > 28 consecutive days of drug interrupt ion will meet criteria for study treatment 
discontinuation. 
 
Dose Modifications 
If a patient experiences a seizure, permanently discont inue study drug treatment. 
 
For < Grade 3 AEs that are not seizures that are probab ly or definitely related to 
enzalutamide, a dose reduction to 120mg is allowed. A further dose reduction to 80mg for 
< Grade [ADDRESS_1137448] ent despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] 120mg dose reduction is 
allowed. If a patient experiences a ≥ Grade 3AE that is not a s eizure and is probably or definitely 
related to study treatment , withhold dosing until symptoms improve to Grade 1 or baseli ne. Once 
the adverse event resolves to Grade 1 or baseline, the study d rug should be dose reduced to 120mg 
if treatment is resumed. A further dose reduction to 80mg  is allowed if symptoms recur.  
 
 
7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

Enzalutamide 
The most common adverse drug reactions (≥ 5%) reported in  patients receiving 
Enzalutamide in the randomized clinical trial were asthenia /fatigue, back pain, diarrhea, 
arthralgia, hot flush, peripheral edema, musculoskeletal  pain, headache, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_42977], muscular weakness, dizziness, insomnia, lower res pi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], spi[INVESTIGATOR_820707]: 02March2020 13  compression and cauda equina syndrome, hematuria, paresthes ia, anxiety, and 
hypertension. Grade 3 and higher adverse reactions were repo rted among 47% of 
Enzalutamide-treated patients and 53% of placebo-treated patients. Discontinuations due to 
adverse events were reported for 16% of Enzalutamide-trea ted patients and 18% of 
placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction  leading to treatment 
discontinuation was seizure, which occurred in 0.9% of the E nzalutamide-treated patients 
compared to none (0%) of the placebo-treated patients.  
 
Table below shows adverse reactions reported in the randomiz ed clinical trial that occurred

8.[ADDRESS_1137455] description: Enzalutamide (MDV3100) will be prescrib ed at 160mg per day. 
Enzalutamide will be provided as liquid-filled soft gelat in capsules for oral administration. 
Each capsule contains 40 mg of Enzalutamide as a solution in  caprylocaproyl 
polyoxylglycerides.  
 
Route of administration: Oral, daily.  
 
8.1.1 Laboratory Abnormalities  
In the randomized clinical trial, Grade 1-4 neutropenia occ urred in 15% of patients 
on Enzalutamide (1% Grade 3-4) and in 6% of patients on place bo (no Grade 3-4). 
The incidence of Grade 1-4 thrombocytopenia was similar in  both arms; 0.5% of 
patients on Enzalutamide and 1% on placebo experienced Gra de 3-4 
thrombocytopenia. Grade 1-4 elevations in ALT occurred in 10% of patients on 
Enzalutamide (0.3% Grade 3-4) and 18% of patients on placebo ( 0.5% Grade 3-4). 
Grade 1-4 elevations in bilirubin occurred in 3% of pati ents on Enzalutamide and 
2% of patients on placebo. 
 
8.1.2 Infections  
In the randomized clinical trial, 1.0% of patients trea ted with Enzalutamide 
compared to 0.3% of patients on placebo died from infecti ons or sepsis. Infection-
related serious adverse events were reported in approxima tely 6% of the patients on 
both treatment arms. 
 
8.1.3 Falls and Fall-related Injuries 
In the randomized clinical trial, falls or injuries rel ated to falls occurred in 4.6% of 
patients treated with Enzalutamide compared to 1.3% of p atients on placebo. Falls 
were not associated with loss of consciousness or seizu re. Fall-related injuries were 
more severe in patients treated with Enzalutamide and i ncluded non-pathologic 
fractures, joint injuries, and hematomas. 
Protocol version: 02March2020 18   
8.1.4 Hallucinations 
In the randomized clinical trial, 1.6% of patients trea ted with Enzalutamide were 
reported to have Grade 1 or 2 hallucinations compared to 0. 3% of patients on 
placebo. Of the patients with hallucinations, the majo rity were on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-
containing medications at the time of the event. Hallucin ations were visual, tactile, 
or undefined. 
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_1137456] to the fetus and the po tential risk for pregnancy loss. 
Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid becoming  pregnant during 
treatment with Enzalutamide. 
 
It is recommended that women who are pregnant or who may b e pregnant should 
wear gloves if they need to touch or handle Enzalutamide ca psules.  
 
8.2 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
 
8.2.1 Drugs that Inhibit or Induce CYP2C8 
Concomitant use of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitors gemfibrozil o r trimethoprim 
[Bactrim]) is excluded in this protocol.  
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_1137457] that MDV3100 may ha ve the potential to 
induce CYP3A4 and to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CY P2C19, 
CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5; therefore, concomitant medications th at are substrates of 
any of these enzymes should be used with caution, and rel evant monitoring should 
be considered, especially for substrates known to cause s eizure, because the 
possibility of drug-drug interactions cannot be fully excl uded. Since the 
metabolism of MDV3100 is not known, caution should be taken for t he 
concomitant use of strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP e nzymes and alternative 
products used when available. 
 
Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (itraconaz ole) increased the 
composite AUC of enzalutamide plus Ndesmethyl enzalutamide by  1.[ADDRESS_1137458] not 
been evaluated in vivo . Co-administration of Enzalutamide with strong CYP3A4 
inducers (e.g., carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, phenytoin, ri fabutin, rifampin, 
rifapentine) may decrease the plasma exposure of Enzalut amide and should be 
avoided if possible. Selection of a concomitant medication  with no or minimal 
CYP3A4 induction potential is recommended. Moderate CYP3A4 ind ucers (e.g., 
Protocol version: 02March2020 19  bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin) and St. John’s Wort may also 
reduce the plasma exposure of Enzalutamide and should be avoided if possible  
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_1137459] of Enzalutamide on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes 
Enzalutamide is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and a moderate CYP2C 9 and CYP2C19 
inducer in humans. At steady state, Enzalutamide reduced the plasma exposure to 
midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate ), and omeprazole 
(CYP2C19 substrate). Concomitant use of Enzalutamide with narrow therapeutic 
index drugs that are metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 (e.g., alfenta nil, cyclosporine, 
dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], quinidine, s irolimus and 
tacrolimus), CYP2C9 (e.g., phenytoin, warfarin) and CYP 2C19 (e.g., S-
mephenytoin) should be avoided, as Enzalutamide may decrease t heir exposure. If 
co-administration with warfarin cannot be avoided, conduct addi tional INR 
monitoring. 
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_1137460] of Other drugs on Enzalutamide  
In a drug-drug interaction trial in healthy volunteers, a single 160 mg oral dose of 
Enzalutamide was administered alone or after multiple ora l doses of gemfibrozil 
(strong CYP2C8 inhibitor). Gemfibrozil increased the AUC0-i nf of Enzalutamide 
plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide by 2.2-fold with minimal effect  on Cmax. The 
results are summarized in Figure 1.  
 
NOTE: Gemfibrozil and trimethoprim (Bactrim) are prohib ited during study 
treatment.  
 
In a drug-drug interaction trial in healthy volunteers, a single 160 mg oral dose of 
Enzalutamide was administered alone or after multiple ora l doses of itraconazole 
(strong CYP3A4 inhibitor). Itraconazole increased the AUC0-i nf of Enzalutamide 
plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide by 1.3-fold with no effect on Cm ax. The results are 
summarized in Figure 1. 
 
The effects of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 inducers on the exposure of  Enzalutamide 
have not been evaluated in vivo . 
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_1137461] of Enzalutamide on Other Drugs  
In an in vivo phenotypic cocktail drug-drug interaction trial in pat ients with 
castration-resistant prostate cancer, a single oral dose of the CYP probe substrate 
cocktail (for CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) was adm inistered 
before and concomitantly with Enzalutamide (following at lea st 55 days of dosing 
at 160 mg daily). The results are summarized in Figure 2. R esults showed that in 
vivo , at steady state, Enzalutamide is a strong CYP3A4 inducer  and a moderate 
CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inducer. Enzalutamide did not cause clinicall y meaningful 
changes in exposure to the CYP2C8 substrate. 
 
Protocol version: 02March2020 [ADDRESS_1137462] inhibition of m ultiple CYP enzymes 
including CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5; 
however, subsequent clinical data showed that Enzalutami de is an inducer of 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 and had no clinically meaningfu l effect on 
CYP2C8 (see Figure 2). In vitro , enzalutamide caused time-dependent inhibition of 
CYP1A2. 
 
In vitro studies showed that enzalutamide caused induction of CYP3A4 and that 
enzalutamide is not expected to induce CYP1A2 at therapeuti cally relevant 
concentrations. In vitro , enzalutamide, N-desmethyl enzalutamide, and the major 
inactive carboxylic acid metabolite are not substrates f or human P-glycoprotein. In 
vitro , enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide are inhibitors of  human P-
glycoprotein, while the major inactive carboxylic acid  metabolite is not. 
 
8.2.6  The following medications are prohibited within 4 weeks of study drug 
administration (Day 1):  
 
Flutamide (Patients who never had a PSA decline with the mo st recent anti-
androgen therapy or in whom response to the most recent a nti-androgen was for <3

9.0 BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE, AND SPECIAL STUDIES  
Gene expression analysis 
 
Biopsy Samples  
 
Radiology-guided biopsies will be handled and processed b y the study investigators and their 
assigned staff. Biopsies will be collected in the radi ology suite. As biopsies are performed, two will 
be placed in 10% NB formalin solution for eventual decalcif ication (if required) and paraffin 
embedding and four to six biopsies will be placed immedia tely on pre-frozen pallets of OCT. The 
placement of biopsies on previously frozen OCT rapi[INVESTIGATOR_820713]. 
 
The frozen sample will be labeled with the patient’s  unique, coded number and taken directly or 
shipped by [CONTACT_820737]. Phillip Febbo at UCSF (See Appendix 
B for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_21382]).  
 
Samples have to be shipped Monday through Thursday, and Sat urday delivery is not allowed. 
Avoid shippi[INVESTIGATOR_820714] a UCSF holiday without prior approval by [CONTACT_180184].  
 
Frozen tumor biopsies will be cryosectioned and a slide stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin 
(H&E) for histological evaluation. If cancer is present , additional slides will be made and tissue 
subjected to laser capture microdissection for RNA and DNA isolation. 
 
The two biopsies placed in NB formalin will be shippe d to the Thomas laboratory at OHSU for 
processing and further work up ( Appendix B for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_21382]). Paraffin embedded biopsies will 
undergo surface decal (using Immunocal, from Decal Chemical Co rp). Hematoxylin and Eosin 
(H&E) staining will be performed to confirm the presenc e of prostate cancer and document the 
extent of involvement. FFPE samples will be paraffin-embe dded and stored at 4° C in airtight 
containers to minimize oxidation of proteins within the b locks.  
 
Unstained sections will be cut and subsequently used for  immunohistochemical staining. DNA will 
be extracted from the FFPE tissues (from unstained slides o r tissue cores or LCM depending on the 
Protocol version: 02March2020 22  amount to tumor present) for downstream sequencing on the  Ion Torrent panel. We anticipate that 
240 of the 300 samples (80%) will demonstrate histologically identi fied prostate cancer.  
 
The H&E stained slides for both the frozen and the paraf fin-embedded biopsies will be sent to the 
Huang lab at UCLA for digital scanning and central pathologi cal review to determine the presence 
or absence of tumor and the approximate percentage of t umor in each biopsy. 
 
Determination of AR Activity 
 
Preparation of RNA and DNA  
 
Frozen biopsies will be processed for RNA analysis using laser capture microdissection and 
RNA amplification using adaptations of previously publishe d methods 20 . Briefly, 8 micro 
frozen sections are obtained from each biopsy specimen  and stained with H&E. Sections 
will be loaded into the Aperio Digital Imaging system a nd reviewed by [CONTACT_820738] (Drs. Thomas and Huang) and Dr. F ebbo to establish the presence 
or absence of prostate cancer and identify the biopsi es most likely to provide sufficient 
tumor for RNA analysis. Multiple sequential 8 micron bi opsies are performed prior to rapid 
H&E staining and dehydration with sequential immersion in xylene. The air-dried slides are 
put into a LCM system and prostate cancer cells are i dentified and collected. Cell material 
selected for analysis is dissolved in RNA or DNA isolat ion buffer and RNA and DNA are 
isolated separately using standard commercially availab le kits. RNA and DNA are 
quantified using the RiboGreen or Pi[INVESTIGATOR_773370] (Invitro gen, Inc) and RNA quality is 
assessed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 Pi [INVESTIGATOR_500124] (Agilent, Inc). 
Samples with sufficient RNA and RNA with clear 18S and 28S bands present on the 
bioanalyzer are amplified and labeled with biotin usi ng the NuGen WT Ovation kit (NuGen 
Inc). Amplified and labeled target is again quantified  and 2.[ADDRESS_1137466] un-detectable 18S and 28S p eaks on the Agilent 
Bioanalyzer or a RIN < [ADDRESS_1137467] an 18S peak. If RNA quantity is 
below that assessable by [CONTACT_820739] s, the specimen will be processed 
for microarray analysis and quality assessment of the microarray data will be used to 
determine technical success. Samples resulting in insuffic ient probe creation (an 
insufficient amount for hybridization) following RNA ampli fication with NuGen WT 
Ovation, will be re-extracted once and RNA amplification  repeated. If two RNA 
amplifications failed, the sample will be considered a technical failure. Once samples are 
hybridized, array-based exclusion criteria include stan dard QC measures for Affymetrix 
platforms (e.g. %present, 3'/5' ratios), and outliers in relation to the normalization dataset, 
as determined by [CONTACT_820740] (PCA). 
 
Application of the AR Signature  
 
[CONTACT_820758] d ata using established 
methodologies 21 . Briefly, prior to statistical modeling, LNCaP cell l ine gene expression 
data is filtered to exclude probe sets with minimal va riation (lowest 10% of genes based 
upon standard deviation of expression across the 10 sample s used to create signature). 
Protocol version: 02March2020 23  When predicting the AR activity of tumor samples, gene sele ction and identification is 
based on the training data from the LNCaP cell line, and then metagene values are 
computed using the principal components of the expression dat a. Bayesian fitting of binary 
probit regression models to the training data then permit s an assessment of the relevance of 
the metagene signatures in within-sample classification 22 , and estimation and uncertainty 
assessments for the binary regression weights mappi[INVESTIGATOR_820715]. Given 
the LNCaP training set of expression vectors (of values  across metagenes) representing two 
biological states (AR active and or inactive), a binary probit regression model, of predictive 
probabilities for each of the two states (high vs. low ) for each case is estimated using 
Bayesian methods 21,22  producing estimated relative probabilities – and asso ciated measures 
of uncertainty – of AR activity across the prostate can cer samples. 
 
Determination of Adaptive Pathway Activity  
 
Adaptive pathway activity will be determined using both i mmunohistochemistry and integrative 
pathway analysis with PARADIGM. Histological sections f rom the fixed, paraffin-embedded 
biopsies containing tumor will be used for ICH. RNA and  DNA from the image-guided biopsies 
will be processed for RNA-sequencing and array compar ative genome hybridization (aCGH) which 
will be used by [CONTACT_820741]. 
 
Immunohistochemistry for selected Adaptive Pathways  
 
Four immunohistochemcial markers will be performed to det ermine the activity of select 
adaptive pathways including: (1) nuclear AR staining 23 \24 ; (2) PTEN protein 25,26 ; (3) 
phosphorylated hsp27 27 ; and (4) N-cadherin 28 . IHC quantification will be performed with 
automated digital image analysis algorithms to rigorously an d systematically measure 
staining intensities, using the inFORM image analysis so ftware (CRi/Caliper Life Sciences, 
Hopkinton, MA) 29 . Established qualitative assessments will only be used i f staining 
characteristics preclude automated image analysis, and will be performed by [CONTACT_820742]. 
 
aCGH Analysis  
 
aCGH analysis will be performed on tumor biopsies and  CTCs. Briefly, 0.5 ug of each 
genomic DNA will be fluorescently labeled by [CONTACT_820743], which employs Cy3 and Cy5 labeled ran dom nanomers (TriLink 
Biotechnologies), a heat fragmentation step at 98° C for 10 minutes, and amplification with 
Klenow fragment 5’-3’exo- (NEB). Five micrograms of each Cy 5-labeled sample will be 
co-hybridized with 5 ug of Cy3-labeled human male referenc e DNA (Promega) on Agilent 
SurePrint G3 Human Catalog CGH 4x180K (Part No. G4449A) following the hybridization 
and washing conditions from the Agilent Oligonucleotide Array- Based CGH for Genomic 
DNA Analysis Protocol v6.2. Arrays will be scanned with  the Agilent DNA Microarray 
Scanner, and quantified with Feature Extraction [IP_ADDRESS]. CGH  processed signal will then 
be uploaded into Biodiscovery Nexus software, where the qual ity will be assessed and data 
visualized and analyzed for copy number variation to b e used for pathway analysis and to 
determine if tumor biopsies and CTCs in the same patient  share genetic events. 
 
RNA-sequencing  
 
We will apply a newly developed strategy to perform RNA  sequencing from minute 
amounts of total RNA 30 . LCM collected material will be lysed with 5 μl Pre lude Lysis 
Buffer (NuGen, San Carlos, CA); subjected to cDNA synthe sis and amplification without 
Protocol version: 02March2020 24  transfer (NuGen, Ovation RNA-seq with some modifications to the standard protocol); 
selected for size and processed using the mixed cDNA st andard library preparation 
performed using TruSeq protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA ). Paired-end sequencing will 
be performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000. RNA-seq is generat ing very high quality data 
and may replace RNA microarrays for the determination  of AR signature [CONTACT_21398]. 
 
Tumor DNA-sequencing  
 
We will use next generation sequencing to detect potentially  actionable mutations with 
patient specimens as well as perform whole exome sequencing  to identify activating 
mutations and other genetic events. Genomic DNA from individua ls will be extracted from 
collected blood samples (germ line) and tumor biopsies; sonicated to approximately 50 - 
200 bp fragments; and used to make a library for paired-end  sequencing (Illumina) or for 
sequencing within the OHSU CLIA laboratory (Ion Torrent sequencing). using established 
protocols 31 .  
 
We will use whole genome sequencing or Sanger sequencing of cfDNA from blood and 
DNA from the tumor biopsy specimens. This will enable us to identify molecular features 
(mutations, including but not limited to the AR, copy numbe r alterations, and gene fusions) 
that may predict resistance or early progression despit e enzalutamide treatment. 
 
As RNA- and DNA-sequencing can provide similar molecular information as RNA 
microarrays and aCGH, respectively, it is our expecta tion that sequence-based analysis will 
likely displace array-based analysis during the study. T he molecular platform deemed to 
provide the best data for pathway analysis (AR and ada ptive pathways) will be used by 
[CONTACT_431]. 
 
Integrative Pathway Analysis to Associate Adaptive Pathway s  
Pathway analysis will be both hypotheses driven based upon previously identified adaptive 
pathways as well as unbiased (using pathway analyses to  associate biological mechanisms 
to drug resistance). RNA-seq and aCGH data (as well a s any additional molecular analyses) 
will be imported into MedBook. Using the molecular data g enerated from patient samples, 
we will use a software program called PARADIGM for i ntegrative pathway-based analysis. 
 
Adaptive Pathway Activity Analysis  
PARADIGM analysis is well suited to the detection of si gnificant alteration in adaptive 
pathways, and additional key known cancer pathways. The cur rent SuperPathway database 
contains over 16,000 features covering 5,500 proteins (roughly 25% of t he genome), which 
are heavily cancer-oriented since the construction of the d atabase was built from NCI’s 
Pathway Interaction Database (PID), Reactome, and Bio Carta. Future additions will come 
from KEGG and WikiPathways. Using clinical and molecular  data in MedBook, our team 
will apply PARADIGM analysis to determine which adaptive  pathways are relatively 
active in each individual biopsied. 
 
Unbiased Pathway Analysis  
In order to identify novel mechanisms underlying eventual disea se progression or 
resistance, we will expand our pathway database to in clude predicted interactions by 
[CONTACT_820744]. We have developed the Diff erential Pathway 
Signature [CONTACT_256012] (DPS) to integrate pathway analysi s with clinical response or gene 
mutation. The DPS method is built on many tools: PARADIGM 32 , Significance Analysis 
of Microarrays (SAM) 33 , Cluster 34 , and Java Treeview. PARADIGM is used to integrate 
gene expression and DNA-based events (copy number variat ion, fusion, mutation etc) into 
Protocol version: 02March2020 [ADDRESS_1137468] score. These scores are called IPLs (inferred pathway levels). 
PARADIGM inferred pathway features are preferable over  gene expression since 
PARADIGM integrates knowledge from both RNA-seq and aCGH.   
 
PARADIGMs output, a relative measure of pathway activitie s within and across samples as 
continuous variables, will be used to determine the distrib ution of pathway activity and the 
association with clinical features. 
 
10.0 STUDY PROCEDURES AND SCHEDULE OF EVENTS 
10.1 Screening/ Visit 
 Medical history 
 ECOG performance status 
 A complete physical exam including vitals (blood pressure, hear t rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], 
temperature and weight)

procedure or day of progression visit when enzalutamide is  discontinued.) 
 
10.3 Follow-up 
After discontinuing enzalutamide, a follow-up PSA should be drawn prior to initiating the 
next therapy (ideally, 2-3 weeks after discontinuing enzalutam ide treatment) in those 
patients who are agreeable. In those who have not initiat ed a new treatment of their prostate 
cancer (radiation, local surgery, or systemic therapy) by 6 weeks, a PSA should be drawn 
then in patients who are agreeable. 
 
After termination of study participation, subjects will be followed using these guidelines:  
10.3.1. If a patient discontinues Enzalutamide treatment f or any reason other than 
Radiographic Progression or Clinical Progression as def ined in section 5.2, the patient will 
continue to be followed until criteria for Radiographic o r Clinical Progression is met. 
Tumor evaluations should follow the same schedule as on study (every 12 weeks).  The 
patient will also be followed for stabilization or res olution of any study-related toxicities.  
 
After progression, all patients will be followed by t elephone, doctor visit, or medical record 
review every 12 weeks for survival status.

Protocol version: 02March2020 [ADDRESS_1137471] 
11.1 PSA Response PSA Changes 
 
11.1.1 PSA Response: A ≥ 50% reduction at 12 weeks after th e initiation of therapy vs. 
baseline. Baseline PSA will be defined as the measurement obtained immediately 
prior to initiation of Enzalutamide on Day 1 of study.   
 
11.1.2 Waterfall plots will be used to report the percen tage change in PSA from baseline 
vs. 12 weeks after starting Enzalutamide treatment for e ach patient. Waterfall plots 
will also be used to report the maximal PSA decline at any point on study for each 
patient.  Baseline PSA will be defined as the measuremen t obtained immediately 
prior to initiation of Enzalutamide on Day 1 of study.   
 
11.1.3 PSA Progression (per PSAWG2 guidelines) 35 :  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] If PSA has declined from baseline, progression is  defined as time from 
start of therapy to first PSA increase that is ≥ 25% an d ≥ 2 ng/mL above 
the nadir, and which is confirmed by a second value 3 or m ore weeks 
later 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] If there is no decline from baseline, progression is defined as PSA 
increase ≥ 25% and ≥2 ng/mL after [ADDRESS_1137472] PSA value that was confirmed by a 
second equal or lower measurement. (Thus the nadir PSA is the second 
lowest PSA value measured.)  
 
11.1.4 Stable PSA: Does not meet criteria for response or  progression.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_1137473] – Solid Tumors 
 For the purposes of this study, subjects should be re-e valuated for response every 12 weeks.   
 
Objective radiographic response and progression will be e valuated in this study using the 
new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_820746] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228-247, 2009].  Changes in the 
largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor l esions and the shortest 
diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the  RECIST criteria. 
 
11.2.1 Definitions 
 
Evaluable for toxicity:  Any subject, who undergoes a biops y, whether or not he 
receives subsequent study drug treatment, will be analyz ed for toxicity related to 
the biopsy. 
 
Evaluable for objective response:  Only those subjects who have measurable 
disease present at baseline, have received at least one c ycle of therapy, and have 
had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluab le for response.  These 
subjects will have their response classified according t o the definitions stated 
below.  (Note:  Subjects who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end 
of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.) 
Protocol version: 02March2020 29   
Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response:  Subjects who have lesions present at 
baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions  of measurable disease, 
have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had  their disease re-evaluated 
will be considered evaluable for non-target disease respon se.  The response 
assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivoc al progression of the 
lesions.  
 
11.2.2 Disease Parameters 
 
Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as tho se that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be r ecorded for non-nodal 
lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as >[ADDRESS_1137474] x-ray, as >[ADDRESS_1137475] scan, or >[ADDRESS_1137476] 
be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of ce ntimeters). 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might 
not be considered measurable.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarge d and 
measurable, a lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_1137477] scan 
(CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline 
and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease:  All other lesions (or sites of di sease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 
mm short axis), are considered non-measurable disease.  Bone  lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effu sions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdomi nal masses (not followed 
by [CONTACT_462]), are considered non-measurable. 
 
Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximu m of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs,  should be identified as target 
lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions  should be selected on 
the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) , be representative of all 
involved organs but, in addition, should be those that lend t hemselves to reproducible 
repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occ asion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circum stance the next largest 
lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be sel ected.  A sum of the 
diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal l esions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the basel ine sum diameters.  If lymph nodes 
are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is  added into the sum.  The 
baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to furt her characterize any objective 
tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease . 
 
Non-target lesions:  All other lesions (or sites of dis ease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identi fied as non-target lesions 
and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not 
required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each 
should be noted throughout follow-up.  
 
11.2.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
Protocol version: 02March2020 30  All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric  notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed  as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before t he beginning of the 
treatment. 
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique shoul d be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at ba seline and during follow-up. 
Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by c linical examination unless 
the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assess able by [CONTACT_461]. 
Conventional CT and MRI:  This guideline has defined measura bility of lesions on 
CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is  [ADDRESS_1137478] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion 
should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also accep table in certain situations (e.g. 
for body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent  contrast, spatial, and 
temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisi tion variables involved in 
MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspic uity, and measurement.  
Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globa lly.  As with CT, if an MRI is 
performed, the technical specifications of the scanning se quences used should be 
optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of diseas e.  Furthermore, as with CT, 
the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was u sed at baseline and the 
lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse s equence.  It is beyond the 
scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MR I pulse sequence parameters 
for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, t he same type of scanner should be 
used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to 
prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with bre ath-hold scanning techniques, 
if possible. 
 
11.2.4 Radiographic Response Criteria 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target les ions.  Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-
target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the s um of the diameters 
of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline 
sum diameters. 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in t he sum of the diameters 
of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest 
sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that 
is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative 
increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression). 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qua lify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
Protocol version: 02March2020 31   
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target l esions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph 
nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis). 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
subject to be considered in complete clinical 
response. 
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s ) 
and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above 
the normal limits. 
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non-target 
lesions.  Unequivocal progression  should not 
normally trump target lesion status.  It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, not 
a single lesion increase.  
 
Although a clear progression of non-target lesions only is exceptional, the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_820716], and 
the progression status should be confirmed at a later t ime by [CONTACT_36465] (or principal investigator). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Radiographic Response 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded f rom the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded s ince the treatment 
started).  The subject's best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria .

*** In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non-tar get lesions may be accepted as disease progression. 
Note: Subjects with a global deterioration of health status  requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of 
disease progression at that time should be reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

Locally initiated studies will be audited by [CONTACT_820749].  Newly approved 
studies may be audited any time after enrollment has be en initiated.  Each OHSU Knight 
approved treatment protocol will be audited on an annual b asis in accordance with the Knight 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.  
  
It is the responsibility of each participating site’s  principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_820717] s, FDA regulations, and NIH 
policies. It is also the responsibility of each site’s principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_820718]’s policies and

Protocol version: 02March2020 [ADDRESS_1137485] will be excluded from the study on  the basis of racial or 
ethnic origin. Male and minority volunteers will be recruit ed for this study from the 
general population and 100% men will be studied.  
 
The racial and ethnic composition of the study should rep resent that of the state of 
Oregon (see Table 1). If the prevalence of the disease b eing studied is consistent 
across race, ethnicity and gender, then these figures can be used to calculate 
projected enrollments in Table 2. If the disease being  studied does not  affect both 
genders or all races and ethnicities equally (e.g., cervica l cancer only affects women 
and Black males are more likely than White males to have prostate cancer), then this 
information should be taken into account when calculati ng the projected enrollment. 
The OHSU General Clinical Research Center has links to  various sources of

12.8.2 Inclusion of Children 
This protocol does not include children for the following rea son: Prostate cancer 
does not affect children under the age of 18.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_1137486] t o enroll 36 patients over the period of 
three years, with an approximate of 12 patients per year.   All subjects will be treated with 
Enzalutamide and followed on protocol until disease progress ion or intolerance. Two tumor 
biopsies may be conducted: the first biopsy at baseline b efore Enzalutamide treatment for all 
enrolled patients, followed by [CONTACT_820750].  
 
 13.2 Primary and Secondary Objectives and Endpoints 
   
Primary Objective and Primary Endpoint 
To assess the correlations between baseline molecular fe atures and pathways and PSA 
change (</> 50% decline) at 12 weeks vs. baseline . 
 
Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives are:  
 
To measure PSA change at 12 Weeks and at each study visit vs. baseline after enzalutamide 
Protocol version: 02March2020 36  treatment.  
 
To measure objective response defined in Section 11.1.1 after  enzalutamide treatment 
 
   To assess the correlations between the baseline molec ular features and pathways and 
Progression-Free Survival (defined as time from Day [ADDRESS_1137487] documented radiographic progression or clinical pr ogression- See Sec 5.3), Disease-
Specific Survival (defined as the time from Day 1 of study  drug to date of death from 
prostate cancer), and Overall Survival (defined as time  from Day 1 of study drug treatment 
to date of death from any cause). 
    
   To assess the correlations between the baseline molec ular features and pathways and time 
to PSA progression (see Sec 11.1). 
 
To identify molecular features and cellular pathways p resent in tumors from men with 
metasatic CRPC that are progressing despi[INVESTIGATOR_820719]. 
 
To explore correlation between baseline molecular feat ures and pathways and changes in 
Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) counts defined in Sec 11.3.1.  
   
To explore correlation between baseline molecular feat ures and pathways and objective 
response defined in Section 11.1.1.  
 
To assess the correlations between the baseline molecula r features and pathways and 
degree of PSA decline at [ADDRESS_1137488]  confirmed disease 
progression prior to 12 weeks of therapy. For the seconda ry endpoint of time to PSA 
progression, evaluable patients will include those for whom PSA data are available at 
follow-up timepoints on study. For the secondary endpoint of mechanisms at disease 
progression/drug discontinuation, evaluable patients will  include those patients for whom 
data from genomic studies and IHC tests are available from  both the pre-treatment and 
post-treatment biopsy samples. Any patient who undergoes a  biopsy, whether or not he 
receives subsequent study drug treatment, will be analyz ed for safety. 
 
 13.4 Statistical Analysis Plan 
 
Analysis for Primary Objective 
 
The proportion of patients with or without a >50% decline in PSA values at 12 weeks will 
be reported with 95% exact confidence interval  
 
Protocol version: 02March2020 37  Simple Logistic regression model will be used to evaluate t he association between PSA 
responseand each of the potential molecular biomarker p redictors, including (gene 
expression signatures, copy number alterations, mutations , IPLs (integrated pathway levels 
and IHC measurements). All continuous variables with ske wed distributions will be log 
transformed and centered before incorporation. Based on the logistic regression model, a 
receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve will be generated and the area under the curve 
(AUC) will be calculated with its 95% confidence interval.   The ROC curve will also be used 
to help determine an optimal cutoff for each molecular pre dictor for a most accurate 
prediction of PSA response..  
Depending on the actual number of patients who are Enzalutami de-responsive or resistant, 
a multivariable logistic model may be developed, starting with all covariates that have a p-
value < 0.25 from the Simple Logistic regression model.  The  model selection will be based 
on the Akaiki Information Criteria (AIC), and the c-index will be reported with the final 
model. If the number of patients who are Enzalutamide res ponsive or resistant is not big 
enough (less than 10 for each 1 degree of freedom in the model ) for the multivariate 
modeling, we will leave the multivariate modeling procedure for future studies.  
 
Analysis for Secondary Objectives 
 
We will use Random Forests classification to identify mol ecular features and pathways 
present in patients with disease progression or who discontinue Enzalutamide treatment.  
Analyses will be conducted in R using the randomForest libr ary.  Forests will be created 
with at least 10,001 trees (odd number ensures fully deter ministic model) and otherwise 
default settings.  We will perform 50 replicates with fi ve-fold CV and step of 0.9 on a log 
scale. The number of predictors with minimum mean CV error across the replicates will be 
chosen as the optimal predictor number.  We will ass ess performance by [CONTACT_820751]-of-bag ( OOB) testing. The OOB testing is 
based on the fact that each tree in the forest is built  on a random 2/3 subset of patients and 
the remaining 1/[ADDRESS_1137489] set for that tree. 
 
The association between molecular predictors and surviv al outcomes (e.g., PFS, DSS and 
OS) and time on treatment will be assessed using cox re gression model. In addition, 
Kaplan-Meier plots will be used to graphically illust rate the survival distributions for PFS, 
DSS and OS across the strata of categorical molecular  predictors. Logistic regression model 
will be used to assess the association between molecul ar predictors and response rate. 
Linear regression model will be used to assess the associa tion for changes in CTC counts 
from baseline and maximal PSA observed while on study.

power calculations cannot be used to determine the number of  samples (ie, patients) 
required because the assumptions of independence and normalit y do not hold. 37   An 
alternative approach is to model this problem as a learn ing curve in which the classification 
error is characterized as an inverse power-law 38 : error = an - + b, where error is the 
expected error rate given n training samples, a is the  learning rate,  is the decay rate and b 
is the Bayes error, or minimum error achievable.  This  approach has been applied to several 
cancer classification problems, and estimates for the  variables can be found in the 
literature. [ADDRESS_1137491] used the average values from 7 c ancer datasets to 
estimate a,  and b.  If we let a = 0.736,  = 0.65 and b = 0.001, we can estimate the error 
for various sample sizes.  We estimate that we can a chieve an error rate of ~0.08 with 30

BIOPSY PROCEDURE 
 
The tumor biopsies for this study will be collected and  shipped via the University of 
[LOCATION_004], San Francisco, protocol CC#125519 (OHSU protoco l #9204) -Radiologically 
Guided Biopsies Of Metastatic Castration Resistant Pr ostate Cancer To Identify Adaptive 
Mechanisms of Resistance. 
 
Critical to the application of the AR signature, is the coll ection of prostate cancer tissue for genomic 
analysis. Due to the nature of metastatic prostate can cer, most biopsies will be from bone. Bone biopsies 
present unique challenges with respect to the collection and processing. However, regardless of collection 
technique, rapid freezing of the biopsy material is cri tical to subsequent success. As part of the trial, we  will 
provide kits to each site enrolling patients so as to fa cilitate a standardized collection of tissue.  
 
Patients are positioned by [CONTACT_820754]. This is based on the judgment of the interventional  radiologist and may be restricted in some 
centers due to the availability of supportive services.  
 
During the image-guided biopsy procedure we recommend the fol lowing general rules when choosing a 
metastatic site and a specific location within the meta static tumor for biopsy:  
 
1. If the patient has bone only disease, the pelvis is the p referred site for biopsy.  
2. Any biopsy kit capable of obtaining core biopsies from  bone is acceptable. The Bonopty Coaxial 
biopsy system with eccentric drill ( http://www.vasocare.co.kr/product04-
5.html ). http://www.vasocare.co.kr/product04-5.html ) is a recommended system. Internal diameter 
is 1.3mm. This is the smallest for collection of usable m aterial.  
3. In the bone, extremely blastic lesions seldom yield usable  material. Yields are greater if biopsies are 
performed in marrow of abnormal signal intensity dire ctly adjacent to blastic lesions. Often, we 
pass the needle tangential to the blastic lesion in the ma rrow space for our most successful 
collections.  
4. In soft tissue, do not biopsy from regions of metastatic  lesions that appear necrotic on CT or MRI 
due to extremely poor yield.  
5. It is important that excessive compressive force is no t required or used to expel the biopsy from the 
biopsy needle. This obscures cellular morphology. If it is  difficult to expel the biopsy from the core 
needle, alternative biopsy kits should be used.  
 
Please follow the directions below when processing the biop sy material:  
 
Required Materials  
 
Included in Kit:  
• Disposable cryo-molds 15x15x5mm  
• Sakura Tissue-Tek OCT compound  
• Metal plate or tray  
• Sarstedt black permanent marker  
• Tissue-Tek Mega-Cassettes  
• Styrofoam cooler (part of shipment box, a new box wil l be returned once the biopsies arrive at UCSF)  
• Container of neutral buffered formalin (2 provided, keep extra, an additional vial will be included with 
the new box)  
Protocol version: 02March2020 43  *Keep all remaining materials after procedure is compl eted for use on future biopsies unless otherwise 
noted  
 
Not Included (should be available on site)  
• Dry Ice (pellet form, smaller pellet size works b est)  
• Syringe needle (core manipulation; ≤19g)  
• Forceps (fine toothed)  
 
Protocol for Biopsies  
1.  Prepare a cold working surface by [CONTACT_820755] s tyrofoam cooler container roughly half full 
of dry ice. Shake the container to form a fairly even la yer.  
 
2.  Place the metal sheet or tray into the cooler and allow i t to cool below -10°C. Temperatures below 
this point will freeze OCT compound quickly, facilitat ing the block formation. Having a flat 
metallic surface is also important.  
 
3.  Prior to heading to the collection, place several cryomold s on the cold metal surface allowing them 
to cool down prior to the biopsy.  
 
4.  Label [ADDRESS_1137495] becomes opaque in each cryomold, the tissue bl ock is ready to be transferred to the 
labeled cold cassette.  
 
Protocol version: 02March2020 [ADDRESS_1137496] be collected for paraffin embedding. 
This core should be placed in the container of neutral buf fered formalin. Close the jar tightly, and 
return to the zip-lock bag.  
 
12.  Package the biopsies into the provided insulated box. The cold cryo cassettes should be placed in 
dry ice in the insulated section of the box, and the form alin vial contained within the zip-lock bag 
should be placed outside of the insulated region of the box.  The appropriate spot for the formalin 
vial will be labeled.  
 
13.  Include with the shipment, the sample shipment log (Appendix K) that should include comments 
regarding core quality (long cylindrical core, bone shard s, mostly blood clot, etc), the quantity of 
cores and any irregularities in the freezing process. The technician performing the collection should 
be sure to note their unique patient ID, the biopsy da te, and the time of the procedure as well.  
 
14.  Prior to any shipments, the study coordinator and designat ed laboratory staff at UCSF and OHSU 
must be notified. Notification should come in the form of  email at least 2 – [ADDRESS_1137497]; this should be sent to 
[EMAIL_15602] and [EMAIL_15603] and [EMAIL_15604] .  
 
15.  Mail by [CONTACT_820756] d on the provided shippi[INVESTIGATOR_12673]. Unless 
special arrangements are made, do not ship on Fridays, S aturdays, or Sundays.    
Protocol version: 02March2020 [ADDRESS_1137498] ure at each time point dictated by [CONTACT_820757] (see 10.4). All supplies listed in this appendix,  with the exception of the 2ml cryovials supplied by 
[CONTACT_54830], are to be obtained locally by [CONTACT_17210]-site. 
 
Draw 10ml whole blood into an EDTA (lavender top) vacutainer tu be. Process blood as soon as possible. It 
is recommended that the resulting plasma is frozen withi n one (1) hour of blood draw, and that no more 
than two (2) hours elapse from collection to freezing. 
 
Centrifuge whole blood at 1,000g for [ADDRESS_1137499] 1ml of the resulting plasma into each of the f our (4) provided Cryovials. Be sure that the cells from 
the buffy coat are not removed with the plasma phase. Ca p and label each Cryovial with patient study ID, 
type of sample (plasma), date of collection, and time point (e.g. day 1, week 12, off-study, etc.). 
 
Freeze and store the samples in an upright position at -80°C until shippi[INVESTIGATOR_820720]. Samples 
may be stored on site and batch shipped to OHSU. Please  alert the OHSU study coordinator listed below of 
any planed shipments to ensure proper receipt.   
 
Follow these instructions to ensure proper transport/r eceipt of samples: 
 
 Samples may only be shipped Monday through Thursday via overni ght delivery. Do not ship 
samples on Fridays as OHSU is unable to receive packages  on Saturdays.  
 Place the frozen samples and some absorbent material i n a plastic biohazard bag and seal the bag. 
 Samples must be shipped in a Styrofoam insulated shippi [INVESTIGATOR_7788]. 
 Place enough dry ice  to cover the bottom of the Styrofoam container, place bagge d samples on top 
of dry ice, then cover with 7 to 10 pounds of dry ice. 
 To ensure timely delivery, the package MUST  be properly labeled to indicate the presence of dry 
ice and biological specimens. Consult a local shippi[INVESTIGATOR_820721].
